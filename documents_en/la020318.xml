<HD>Blading to Scenery Makes Exercise Roll Right Along</HD>

<LD>What I wanted was a light workout--with scenery. The beach, I
thought, would be a good place to start, since it is the very essence
of Southern California scenery. And then I settled on in-line skating
because it seemed like a good way to cruise the beach and exercise at
the same time.</LD>
<LD>   The first thing I needed was a pair of skates. I have old ones
somewhere in the garage, but my teenage daughter, who is now taller
than I am, borrowed them a while back and broke a strap. So I scouted
the Internet and came across Perry's Cafe and Sports Rentals, one of
several rental places near the Santa Monica Pier.</LD>
<LD>   And there I met Gal Paz, who besides fitting renters runs a skate
school and gives both private and group lessons in the fine art of
blading. Paz, who immigrated from Israel eight years ago, teaches 21
different skating techniques that range from simply standing on
wheeled feet to doing figure-eights. Skates these days, he said, can
climb to $250, even higher for five-wheeled speed versions that are
the dragsters of the in-line world, which numbers 24 million people
in this country alone, according to the National Sporting Goods Assn.</LD>
<TE>   "The more expensive ones give you a better frame and better fit,"
he said. "You pay for comfort and speed."</TE>
<TE>   He said, though, that the average blader can buy a perfectly
acceptable pair of skates for about $100, the purchase price of the
skates he was renting me for the next two hours. And what about other
equipment? I asked.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest mistake is not having protective gear," he said. "A
lot of people fall down, and it's easy to break a wrist. The most
important thing to have are the wrist guards."</TE>
<TE>   I'd brought my own wrist guards along and put them on after
strapping on my skates. But not anticipating any serious hills, I
left the rest of my padding in the car, which in retrospect was
probably ill advised for a 50-something guy. Standing, I could feel
the effects of not having skated in a while. I wobbled slightly as I
pushed off and started to pick up speed. Years back, one of my
favorite forms of exercise was to skate along the bike path that
paralleled the Truckee River in the Sierra, keeping up with my kids,
who rode their bikes. I knew I could not maintain that kind of pace
and, in fact, did not want to.</TE>
<TE>   For this exercise, the goal was not to cruise at top speed but to
try to stay within my heart rate zone, which is a maximum of 142
beats per minute. I had noticed in two recent adventures in exercise
(ocean kayaking off Catalina and cycling in the San Gabriel
Mountains) that my heart rate had exceeded that maximum almost the
entire time. As I headed south for the Santa Monica Pier, I watched
my heart rate and, of course, the small army of bikers and skaters
that makes this place a people-watcher's paradise.</TE>
<TE>   As I reached the pier, I noticed that my rate already was past
150. I slowed down, and presently the heart rate dipped back within
the zone. With some experimentation, it became clear that any real
exertion was going to shoot it back up. So I took it easy, enjoying
the cool breeze and the wide sidewalk that leads to Venice. When I
got there, about 15 minutes into my skate, I was taken aback by the
sea change in the street life.</TE>
<TE>   As it happens, I hadn't been to Venice in more than 20 years, so I
slowed to take in the scene as well as to avoid various dogs, street
preachers and comedians, jewelry hawkers, wannabe artists and other
peddlers. And then, once through it all, the path ended abruptly at a
parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   I took to the street, cruising along Pacific Avenue until I found
the spot where the sidewalk picked up again on the sand. That ended
as well when I came upon the entrance to Marina del Rey. Consulting
my watch, I decided to head back along a slightly different route.</TE>
<TE>   I took a street that paralleled the marina, then doubled back to
the boardwalk. I was crossing a street when I felt myself losing
balance and had to do some serious arm-flailing to keep from landing
on my back. A woman turning onto the street looked alarmed even after
I'd regained balance and most of my composure.</TE>
<TE>   I headed back through Venice, which was even more crowded in the
late afternoon. My only incident of note was being passed by a
speedskater decked out in expensive racing gear who looked at me
almost sympathetically before zipping down the sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   By the time I returned to Perry's, I had been skating for an hour
and 39 minutes. Unfortunately, my best efforts to stay in my heart
rate zone had not been as successful as I had hoped. I was in it for
only 40 minutes. The good news was that my heart rate averaged 143,
only a beat higher than my maximum.</TE>
<TE>   As I peeled off my skates, Paz asked me how it had gone.</TE>
<TE>   Couldn't be better, I replied, glancing at the dozens of skaters
and bikers who glided by on the sidewalk, with sand and ocean as the
backdrop.</TE>

<HD>Why Dogs and People Don't See Eye to Eye</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSIE MESTEL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a recent hike at dusk, my two dog companions ran ahead while I
found my feet slamming the ground and my eyes near-skewered by
face-high branches because I couldn't see well in the fading light.
The dogs seemed to see every last twig and leaf and clearly didn't
get what my problem was.</LD>
<LD>   Dog and human eyes are more similar than different: They're round,
filled with gelatin-like liquid and kitted out with retina, lens and
the rest. And dogs get glaucoma and cataracts as humans do, says Paul
E. Miller, a veterinarian and dog eye expert at the University of
Wisconsin School of Medicine. Some dogs are even shortsighted. (And
some get fitted with contact lenses, such as a circus dog Miller knew
that needed the lenses to continue to do its tricks after cataract
surgery.)</LD>
<LD>   But dog and human eyes are distinct in several key ways, Miller
says:</LD>
<TE>   * Dogs have only two kinds of color-sensing cells (called cones)
in their eyes: one that's most sensitive for yellow-ish hues and
another for blues. This was figured out, in part, by tests in which
dogs had to distinguish between different-colored discs to get yummy
treats. "The best analogy is that they're similar to a person who has
red-green color blindness," Miller says. They can detect red and
green, but can't distinguish between them.</TE>
<TE>   Humans, normally, have three cone types, so our world has more
hues than a dog's world does. (People used to think that dogs saw
only in shades of gray.)</TE>
<TE>   * Dogs have fewer cones than people and a lot more rods, which
merely distinguish light from dark. Rods function better than cones
when it's dark, which explains why when dusk rolls down, the world
looks more gray. Dogs' extra dose of rods allow them to see four to
six times better than people in dim light. This helps dogs and their
wolf relatives hunt at night, dawn and dusk.</TE>
<TE>   * Dogs, unlike us, have a layer under their retina called the
"tapetum," a reflective coating that further increases the animals'
visual acuity at night. (Reflection from the tapetum is why the eyes
of dogs, cats and a range of night critters gleam back at you in the
dark.) Should a ray of light shoot through their retina without
getting sensed by the rods and cones, it bounces back up and gets
another chance to be absorbed.</TE>
<TE>   But there's a downside to the tapetum. The bouncing-back trick
makes the exact source of the light ray more ambiguous--and as a
consequence dogs only have about 20:75 vision. In other words, "a
sign that a human could read from 75 feet a dog could read from 20
feet," Miller says. If, of course, a dog could read.</TE>
<TE>   "People ask, 'Well, how come when I'm across the street my dog
barks, but when I walk across the street he starts wagging his tail
and feels all sheepish that he barked at me?'" Miller says. "Well, it
relates to this 20:75 vision." Your dog may simply not recognize you
that far away.</TE>
<TE>   Dogs, by the way, do get eye tests. But this doesn't involve
growled responses to pictures of cats or postal carriers or anything
like that. There are physical ways to detect shortsightedness, such
as by measuring the eyes' ability to focus (the same methods used in
children who can't talk).</TE>
<TE>   * Dogs detect moving images better than still ones, but not as
well as we do.</TE>
<TE>   And they can't focus on objects that are too close. Although a
normal child can see--pretty sharply--an image as close as four
inches, for a dog crispness starts to decline at about 20 inches.
"That's why I think that when dogs really want to investigate objects
near them, they smell them," Miller says.</TE>
<TE>   These days, he says, dogs with vision problems can get treated
much as humans can--glaucoma drugs, cataract surgery and more--in
fact, he works closely with his colleagues in medical ophthalmology.
Certain breeds are particularly prone to vision problems because of
inbreeding.</TE>
<TE>   American cocker spaniels are prone to glaucoma, for instance, and
German shepherds have a tendency to nearsightedness. German shepherd
guide dogs, meanwhile, have a much lower nearsighted rate-probably
because the ones with vision problems were kicked out of guide dog
school because they couldn't perform the tasks well enough.</TE>

<HD>If Toilet Training Is Trying, Maybe It's Just Too Early</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANNE PARTIE LANGE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Learning to use the potty is a demanding challenge for a toddler. It
requires a range of skills that don't all develop at once. Nor are
the skills acquired as early as many experts thought. New research
shows that most children aren't ready to move from diapers to
training pants until after the child's second birthday, or about six
months later than is often recommended. The study, published in
Pediatrics, the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, should
reassure many parents who are frustrated by their toddler's apparent
lack of progress.</LD>
<LD>   For the first time, researchers have pinpointed 11 "readiness
skills" needed for toilet training, and they have learned about some
specific differences between the sexes. For girls, the first skill
learned is usually controlling their bowels all night. The average
age for this milestone in the 126 girls studied was 22.1 months. For
boys, the earliest skill acquired is understanding "potty words."
Among the 141 boys studied, the average age for learning the lingo
was 24.5 months, which is later than it is mastered by girls.</LD>
<TE>   With few exceptions, girls achieve all the toilet training skills
earlier than boys. But new data suggest that boys and girls take the
same amount of time to accomplish toilet training. "Girls just start
earlier," says researcher Timothy R. Schum, associate professor of
pediatrics at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Most kids are ready to begin toilet training between 24 and 30
months, he says.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Antidepressant Trials May Not Reflect Real World</TE>
<TE>   When a doctor gives you a prescription, the assumption is that the
drug has been proved to work in people similar to you. But this is
often not true of antidepressants, concludes a study in the American
Journal of Psychiatry. Clinical trials of antidepressants have such
stringent criteria for those on whom the drugs are tested that
researchers believe the results may not apply to many depressed
people in the real world.</TE>
<TE>   The people who participate in drug studies are moderately to
severely depressed, whereas those who are prescribed antidepressants
represent a range of depression, including mild forms of the
disorder, says researcher Mark Zimmerman, associate professor of
psychiatry and human behavior at Brown University in Providence, R.I.
Most of the studies also fail the reality check by excluding people
with a history of drug or alcohol abuse. And several exclude those
with eating or anxiety disorders. These problems often accompany
depression, says Zimmerman.</TE>
<TE>   Zimmerman and his colleagues reviewed the standards used to
include and exclude study subjects in 31 antidepressant trials. Then
they applied the most commonly used criteria to 364 patients treated
for depression at Providence's Rhode Island Hospital. About 85% of
them failed to meet the criteria and would not have qualified for an
antidepressant trial. Yet 90% of those whose medical charts were
available had been prescribed antidepressants by psychiatrists.</TE>
<TE>   Showing that drugs help a select group of people with depression
doesn't mean they will be any better than a placebo for people with a
milder form of the condition or whose illness is complicated by other
problems, says Zimmerman. "And if these drugs aren't working better
than placebo, then the people taking them are potentially being
exposed to side effects unnecessarily."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Severe Sweating Condition May Have Genetic Cause</TE>
<TE>   People who perspire uncontrollably are often too embarrassed by
their condition to admit it to anyone, including their doctors. We're
not talking about an occasional nervous sweat, but rather sweating
nearly all the time--a condition known as hyperhidrosis. Now that
researchers at UCLA have found that the syndrome runs in families,
they hope people understand their problem is a medical one that
they've probably inherited and so will be more willing to seek
treatment.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers investigated the family histories of 49 people
with hyperhidrosis, and their systematic review was published in the
Journal of Vascular Surgery. The study revealed a genetic pattern.
Children of people who sweat too much have a one-in-four chance of
having the problem. A parent of a child with hyperhidrosis has a
one-in-10 chance of having it.</TE>
<TE>   Samuel S. Ahn, director of UCLA's Endovascular Program, estimates
that as much as 5% of the population has hyperhidrosis--not 1%, as
was previously thought.</TE>
<TE>   For now, surgery to snip the nerve that triggers palm sweating is
100% effective. But Ahn, who is a pioneer of the technique, hopes
that one day gene therapy will offer an easier cure.</TE>

<TE>   Study Shows Herb Can Be Effective Against Impotence</TE>
<TE>   Yohimbine, an herb believed to be helpful for impotence, hasn't
been entirely replaced by Viagra. Web sites are devoted to it, and
supplements are sold at convenience stores. Still, controversy
surrounds the natural remedy.</TE>
<TE>   The American Urological Assn. says yohimbine isn't effective and
shouldn't be recommended to treat erectile dysfunction. But the
authors of a study published recently in the Internal Journal of
Impotence Research beg to differ. "Our data suggest that yohimbine
treatment should be revisited," they said.</TE>
<TE>   A decade ago, yohimbine proved helpful for psychologically caused
impotence, but it didn't seem effective when the problem was organic,
meaning caused by a health problem or a medication. According to
researcher Andre T. Guay, director of the Center for Sexual Function
at the Lahey Clinic Northshore in Peabody, Mass., the problem with
the earlier studies was that they included smokers. More recently,
smoking has been identified as a risk factor for impotence. So the
Lahey Clinic researchers decided to investigate yohimbine in
nonsmokers.</TE>
<TE>   Only 18 40- to 80-year-old men with organic impotence were
included in this research, but measurements of the drug's effects on
them was objective and precise. The men allowed themselves to be
tested with instruments that measured their nighttime erections on
several occasions at home. They also completed detailed
questionnaires and kept a log of their sexual activity. They took 5.4
mg of prescription yohimbine three times a day for four weeks. Then
the dose was doubled for four weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Half of the men responded and half didn't, but in those who did,
improvement was significant. They were able to have intercourse more
than 75% of the time they tried. By definition, those with erectile
dysfunction fail half the time, says Guay.</TE>
<TE>   According to Guay, the drug had negligible side effects. Now, he
says, research comparing yohimbine to placebo in nonsmokers needs to
be done.</TE>
<TE>   Yohimbine may turn out to be best for men with mild impotence and
few health risk factors, the Lahey clinic team reports. It might also
be useful in combination with drugs that don't quite do the trick
alone. Yohimbine is different from the over-the-counter type,
sometimes called yohimbe. "Those sold without a prescription are
usually an extract or an alkaloid, and there's no way of knowing how
much of the active ingredient you're actually getting," Guay says.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Two Nutrients Show Anti-Aging Promise in Early Studies</TE>
<TE>   Have you had your L-carnitine today? What about your alpha-lipoic
acid? If you didn't, you could be missing out on nutrients that may
make you feel more energetic, maybe even younger. At least that is
what animal experiments are beginning to show.</TE>
<TE>   When L-carnitine and alpha-lipoic acid were added to the food and
water fed to old laboratory rats for a month, they had more energy
and scored higher on memory tests than rats that didn't get the
pick-me-ups. According to three studies recently published in the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the animals on the
experimental diets were peppier, and their memory and ability to
learn, pay attention and explore were improved. Now studies are
underway to see if supplements of the nutrients also help rats live
longer.</TE>
<TE>   "What happens to old rats may not happen to old humans," says the
studies' author, Bruce N. Ames. Still, he's encouraged enough to have
initiated human clinical trials using natural lipoic acid and
L-carnitine.</TE>
<TE>   As the body ages, hundreds of each cell's energy factories, or
mitochondria, slow down, explains Ames, who is professor of molecular
and cell biology at UC Berkeley. The two nutrients he studied appear
to jump-start these cellular power plants. Alpha-lipoic acid, which
is an antioxidant, gets rid of the destructive free radicals. And
L-carnitine boosts the activity of a particular enzyme essential to
the mitochondria. Restoring youth to the mitochondria increases the
cell's metabolism, and it produces even more of its own anti-aging
antioxidants.</TE>
<TE>   Ames believes it's very difficult for people to consume enough of
these micronutrients in their diets, but he isn't recommending health
food store supplements just yet. For one thing, he says, they contain
a synthetic mixture of lipoic acid, only half of which is active. UC
Berkeley has a patent on a supplement that combines natural
alpha-lipoic acid and L-carnitine. One clinical trial of the pill has
been completed, though the results have not yet been analyzed, and
two other studies are planned.</TE>

<LD>Helga Refaie, who sees both an herbalist and an acupuncturist, takes
ginkgo biloba to keep her memory sharp, glucosamine with shark
cartilage to combat arthritis, rose hips extract to boost her immune

<LD>   "I see my regular doctor to find out what I have, but I never take
his prescriptions. I take the diagnosis straight to my herbalist. My
doctor would laugh at me, of course. He'd tell me I was wasting my
money. It's always been my belief that herbal supplements are much
better. Other medications have side effects, which are sometimes

<HD>Drops Are Easier Fix for Lazy Eye</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARI ROAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Successful treatment of amblyopia, or lazy eye, in children requires
that a patch be worn over the good eye for all or part of the day,
forcing the lazy eye to work. But many kids resist this.</LD>
<LD>   Now research from the National Eye Institute has found that eye
drops work as well as a patch and are easier to use. The drops,
containing the drug atropine, are placed in the good eye, dilating
the pupil and temporarily causing blurry vision in that eye. This
forces the child to use the amblyopic eye, improving vision in it.</LD>
<LD>   In the study, published last week in the Archives of
Ophthalmology, 215 children under age 7 used a patch and 204 received
atropine. Although the lazy eye initially improved faster in the
patch group, both groups had similar success rates after six months
of treatment--79% for the patching group and 74% for the atropine
group.</LD>
<TE>   The study is sure to be welcome news for parents whose young
children resist wearing a patch. As many as 3% of children have
vision impairment due to amblyopia, and compliance with treatment is
crucial. Unless the defect is treated in early childhood, the
condition can persist into adulthood.</TE>
<TE>   "The daily burden to administer treatment for amblyopia falls on
the parent," says Dr. Michael Repka, study chairman. "Since patching
and atropine work equally well, the choice of treatment can be made
by the eye care professional in consultation with the parent."</TE>
<TE>   The study will continue for another year to determine whether
either approach has any longer-term advantages.</TE>
<TE>   Atropine, which is used once a day, costs about $10 for a
six-month supply. Children using atropine need to wear sunglasses
outdoors to offset light sensitivity.</TE>

<HD>Heart Attack Patients Faring Better at California Hospitals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hospitals in California are doing a better job of keeping heart
attack patients alive, according to a state report. The number of
heart attack patients who died within a month of being admitted to a
California hospital declined from 15.1% in 1991 to 12.1% in 1998, the
most recent year for which data is available.</LD>
<LD>   The report is the latest in a series of state-mandated studies on
hospital care begun in 1991. Known as the California Hospital
Outcomes Project, the studies are intended to encourage hospitals to
improve patient care and to make comparative information available.</LD>
<LD>   From 1996 to 1998, about 5,000 of the state's 40,000 heart attack
patients died within 30 days of reaching the hospital. Data for the
1998-to-2000 period should be available before the end of this year,
said David Carlisle, director of the state's Office of Statewide
Health Planning and Development.</LD>
<TE>   The report found that 304 hospitals statewide in the study, or
76.4%, had the expected rate of heart attack deaths. The data is
"risk-adjusted,'' meaning that the authors take into account the fact
that some hospitals--academic centers, for example--tend to care for
sicker patients than others.</TE>
<TE>   The report's value, said Carlisle, lies in identifying those
hospitals that are outliers. The report found that 32 hospitals, or
8%, did better than expected, with fewer deaths. And 42 hospitals, or
10.6%, did worse than expected, with more deaths than expected.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the latest data are several years old, the reports,
when taken together, help track how well hospitals handle heart
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Some hospitals have been doing well consistently for several
years,'' Carlisle said. "Some have been doing the opposite."</TE>
<TE>   Among hospitals with superior performance in the last three
reports were several in Los Angeles County: Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center, Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, St. John's Health Center,
Temple Community Center and UCLA Medical Center; and one in San Diego
County, Kaiser Foundation Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Louise White, vice president of the Heart Institute at Long Beach
Memorial, attributed her hospital's highly rated heart care to having
ER nurses dedicated exclusively to cardiac patients, having
cardiologists ready to care for them, and having lab, operating rooms
and intensive care units at the same location. In addition, she said,
nearly all heart attack patients quickly undergo angioplasty to open
blocked vessels.</TE>
<TE>   Hospitals that performed worse than expected in the last three
reports include Kern Medical Center in Bakersfield in Kern County;
Memorial Hospital of Gardena in Los Angeles County; Chino Valley
Medical Center and San Antonio Community Hospital in San Bernardino
County; and Scripps Memorial Hospital-East County in El Cajon, San
Diego County.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Royce Johnson, chairman of the department of medicine at Kern
Medical Center, described heart attack deaths there as "extremely
rare," saying he'd seen "only a couple in the last couple of years."</TE>
<TE>   He said the hospital might have scored badly in the reports
because of two factors other than the quality of care it provides.
Although some heart attack patients may only pass through its
emergency room before being sent to other hospitals that can offer
specialized cardiac care such as angioplasties, the deaths are still
tallied as part of Kern Medical Center's total. Second, he said, his
hospital often is the last stop for very sick nursing-home patients
who can't be resuscitated. Report authors acknowledged that their
data did not account for the higher death rate at hospitals that
treat more do-not-resuscitate patients than others.</TE>
<TE>   Carlisle said the study has two key messages for consumers: that
not all hospitals are the same, with similar technology or surgical
proficiency, and that patients with heart disease, or people with
risk factors might want to closely examine which hospital their
doctors or health plans have relationships with in their geographic
area.</TE>

<HD>Removal of Uterus Still Common</HD>
<DH>Surgery: Despite the availability of alternative
treatments, the rate of hysterectomies holds steady, frustrating
health and consumer groups.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARI ROAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The charge that too many women have hysterectomies was first leveled
at the medical profession 50 years ago. It appears little has
changed.</LD>
<LD>   A new report from the federal government shows that the rates have
remained stubbornly steady since the 1980s, when criticism caused a
moderate decline. The surgery to remove a woman's uterus is the
second-most common surgery in the United States, following only
caesarean section.</LD>
<LD>   The numbers frustrate many health experts and consumer watchdogs
because several alternatives to hysterectomy became available in the
last decade.</LD>
<TE>   "Education about hysterectomy and the alternatives is a huge
issue," said Carla Dionne, executive director of the National Uterine
Fibroids Foundation, a consumer group. "Women don't know which option
is best for them, and the problem is compounded by gynecologists not
knowing what the options are."</TE>
<TE>   According to the new analysis by the Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality, or AHRQ, 5.6 women per 1,000 had hysterectomies
in 1997, the most recent year for which statistics are available,
compared with 5.5 per 1,000 in 1990. The study examined only
hysterectomies for noncancerous conditions, such as fibroids,
menstrual disorders, endometriosis and uterine prolapse, which occurs
when the uterus drops into the vaginal canal due to weakening of
supporting tissue.</TE>
<TE>   Using these figures, about 600,000 U.S. women have a hysterectomy
each year. One in three American women will have a hysterectomy by
age 60, a rate that is three to four times higher than Australia, New
Zealand and most European countries, according to the AHRQ.
Hysterectomy rates even vary widely within the United States, with
rates almost twice as high in the South as in the Northeast.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot of data out there on appropriate and inappropriate
uses of hysterectomy and on alternative treatments," said Dr. Claudia
Steiner, a coauthor of the study at the AHRQ. "When should those
things start impacting hysterectomy rates? I don't think anyone knows
that--or even knows what is the right rate."</TE>
<TE>   The difference in hysterectomy practices between the United States
and similarly modernized countries suggests that the operation may
not be necessary in vast numbers of cases. But American doctors and
patients appear satisfied with hysterectomy despite the fact that the
surgery usually entails several days in the hospital, a 2% to 10%
chance of a serious complication (including a death rate of 1 per
1,000 women), a long recuperation, possible long-term side effects
including sexual dysfunction and bladder and bowel problems, and the
sudden onset of menopause when the ovaries are removed along with the
uterus.</TE>
<TE>   Hysterectomy costs from $6,800 to $9,300 depending on which
technique is used, according to the AHRQ.</TE>
<TE>   "Hysterectomy works very well to treat the problem it's used for,"
said Dr. Michael Broder, an assistant professor of obstetrics and
gynecology at UCLA. "So what is the impetus to do something
different? Medicine is a very conservative field and tends not to
move unless it's shoved."</TE>
<TE>   In a study published in 2000 of 497 women undergoing hysterectomy
in Southern California HMOs, Broder found that--in 70% of the
surgeries--either the causes of women's symptoms were not fully
explored or less-severe alternatives were not tried first. He
estimates that in about 30% of hysterectomies, the patient's symptoms
were minimal and surgery was unnecessary.</TE>
<TE>   Medications such as birth control pills, hormones or pain
relievers could have been tried for some patients, Broder said.</TE>
<TE>   Even in cases of fibroids--noncancerous growths in the uterus that
can cause pain and bleeding--many doctors favor hysterectomy over an
established, less radical surgery called myomectomy, said Dr. William
Parker, a Santa Monica gynecologist and author of "A Gynecologist's
Second Opinion." Myomectomy is surgery to cut away the fibroids
without removing the uterus. At least one-third of hysterectomies are
performed to treat fibroids.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a matter of comfort for the doctor," Parker said.
"Hysterectomy is easier. Myomectomy takes a little longer. But the
data show there is not a higher complication rate. Often there is no
good reason not to do a myomectomy."</TE>
<TE>   Even fewer doctors appear interested in the newer, less invasive
alternatives to hysterectomy. These include uterine artery
embolization for fibroids and endometrial ablation for bleeding
disorders. In the embolization procedure, the arteries that carry
blood to the fibroids are blocked; in ablation, the lining of the
uterus is removed.</TE>
<TE>   With hysterectomy so entrenched, doctors may not have the
opportunities or willingness to learn the new procedures, Dionne
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it will take a long time for the new technology to
trickle down to all the gynecologists practicing in isolation," she
said. "The gynecologists are comfortable with what they're doing, and
there is little to make them offer anything that is outside their
comfort zone until it becomes so widespread."</TE>
<TE>   Women are most likely to hear about alternatives to hysterectomy
if they live in large urban areas or seek care through an academic
hospital, Dionne said.</TE>
<TE>   "We tell patients you have to get to a teaching institute to have
the greatest chance to hear about one of the newer techniques. But
there aren't that many teaching institutes."</TE>
<TE>   Endometrial ablation was introduced more than 15 years ago to help
women with heavy menstrual bleeding, but Parker said it wasn't simple
enough to attract much support.</TE>
<TE>   However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1997 approved a
simpler ablation device, and three similar devices were approved last
year. With the new technology, the lining of the uterus can be
removed using freezing, heat or electrical current and with minimal
doctor involvement and training.</TE>
<TE>   Another alternative to emerge in the 1990s, uterine artery
embolization for the treatment of fibroids, has also been slow to
catch on. The minimally invasive procedure is performed by
interventional radiologists, and some women may never hear about it
from their gynecologists.</TE>
<TE>   Some gynecologists may simply be unfamiliar with the procedure;
others may opt for a treatment they can perform themselves. According
to a new survey by the Society of Cardiovascular and Interventional
Radiology, only 1% of women ages 35 to 50 have heard of uterine
artery embolization to treat fibroids.</TE>
<TE>   Another problem with many of the alternatives is that it's hard to
predict who will be helped in the long term and who will still end up
needing a hysterectomy, Steiner notes. More studies are needed on the
alternative methods to examine their long-term benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "Emotionally, what drives women to hysterectomy is the possibility
of facing another surgery if the alternative doesn't work," Dionne
said. "With a hysterectomy it's a done deal. The problem is taken
care of."</TE>
<TE>   But most experts agree that too many women aren't offered a choice
between hysterectomy and alternatives. Dionne's organization, which
has a Web site at www.nuff.org, is working on a project to refer
women to doctors who agree to explain all the options.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the numbers on hysterectomy are going to change
unless patients band together and drive it," she said. "The whole
mind-set has to change. Somewhere between patient demand and
physician training, it's got to change."</TE>
<TE>   The study, published last month in the journal Obstetrics &amp;
Gynecology, did find that more doctors are using a less severe method
to perform hysterectomy. Laparoscopically assisted vaginal
hysterectomy, in which the uterus is removed through the vagina with
the aid of viewing instruments inserted in the abdomen, now accounts
for 9.9% of all hysterectomies--up from 0.3% in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Still, 63% of hysterectomies are still performed using a large
abdominal incision, while the number of surgeries performed through
the vagina, called vaginal hysterectomy, remained unchanged at about
23%. Any type of vaginal hysterectomy usually involves a shorter
hospital stay, lower complication rate and faster recovery time than
abdominal hysterectomy, Steiner said.</TE>
<TE>   "Vaginal hysterectomy clearly has been shown to have advantages to
women," she said. "It's good we did see more vaginal hysterectomy
overall. But we still don't do it as much as other countries."</TE>

<TE>   Treatment Options</TE>
<TE>   Here are the primary treatment options for women considering
hysterectomy, the conditions for which each is used, and the
associated risks and considerations.</TE>
<TE>   Hysterectomy (surgery to remove uterus through abdominal
incision): Used to treat uterine cancer, fibroids, menstrual
disorders, endometriosis, uterine prolapse; resolves problem in most
cases, but has the risks associated with major surgery; eliminates
childbearing potential and can cause long-term problems with bladder,
bowel and sexual function.</TE>
<TE>   Vaginal hysterectomy (surgery to remove uterus through vagina):
Used to treat same conditions as above, except for endometriosis and
when fibroids are large; resolves problem in most cases, but
eliminates childbearing potential; can cause long-term problems with
bladder, bowel and sexual function.</TE>
<TE>   Laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy (surgery to remove
uterus through vagina with laparoscope): Treats same conditions as
traditional hysterectomy, except when tumors are large or pelvic
adhesions are present; resolves problem in most cases, but eliminates
childbearing potential; can cause long-term problems with bladder,
bowel and sexual function.</TE>
<TE>   Myomectomy (surgery to remove fibroid tumors): Can be done with
abdominal incisions or laparoscopy or through cervix; preserves
fertility; can be major surgery depending on method, and fibroids can
recur. Only for selected patients.</TE>
<TE>   Endometrial ablation (procedure to remove lining of uterus):
Treats abnormal bleeding with freezing, heat or electrical current
that destroys tissue; is minimally invasive but may not resolve
problems. Only for selected patients, including those who have not
reached menopause and whose childbearing is completed.</TE>
<TE>   Uterine artery embolization (procedure to cut off blood supply to
fibroids): Is minimally invasive and preserves childbearing
potential, but may not resolve problem; risks include infection and
other complications. Only for selected patients.</TE>
<TE>   Medication (depending on the condition--hormones, oral
contraceptives, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and

<LD>Watching a friend or family member struggle with a serious illness is
painful for everyone, but it's especially difficult if you're a
child.</LD>
<LD>   "It's hard for a kid to know what's OK to feel," says Dr. Margaret
Stuber, a psychiatry professor at UCLA.</LD>
<LD>   Children can have many reactions, the most common ones being grief
and anger.</LD>
<TE>   Though it's natural to be sad and worried about the patient,
especially in the case of an ill parent, some kids also become mad
that regular routines have been disrupted. A birthday party or
holiday celebration may be canceled, for example, because Mom or Dad
is in the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to find someone to talk to about all your
feelings, who's not going to be hurt by them," Stuber says. "It's
perfectly normal to feel angry, but it's not a good idea to yell at
the person who's sick."</TE>
<TE>   She recommends talking to another relative, a friend, religious
leader, teacher or school counselor, especially if the feelings are
interfering with your studies. For some kids, school is a comfort,
the one place where life still is normal; others have trouble
concentrating on their work.</TE>
<TE>   Also, kids are sometimes embarrassed about how their sick family
member looks and may not know how to handle questions from curious
friends. In this case, Stuber suggests asking a teacher to help
explain the situation to the class.</TE>
<TE>   Visiting a patient in the hospital may be stressful for children.
Having a grown-up tell you what to expect can be helpful, so you know
ahead of time what you will see.</TE>
<TE>   Some kids are anxious that they will have to entertain the sick
person or have to help them feel better, but Stuber emphasizes that's
not a kid's responsibility. And kids shouldn't worry about buying
flowers or presents.</TE>
<TE>   "Just your being there and showing that you care about them is
going to be a wonderful gift," says Stuber.</TE>

<LD>The slick brochure for the new $13-million cardiac center at Mission
Hospital promises that "at Mission, you can be sure your heart is in
the right place." It includes testimonials from former patients,
including one woman who says she decided to undergo bypass surgery at
the Mission Viejo facility "because the people there were so
wonderful."</LD>
<LD>   As hospital marketing goes, Mission Hospital's pitch for its new
cardiac center is fairly typical: heavy on feeling and light on
facts. Kristin Brocoff, a spokeswoman for Mission, said the hospital
hopes to become the "premier provider of cardiovascular services in
south Orange County." Specifically, Mission hopes that its
state-of-the-art facility will help attract hundreds more patients
during the next few years--some of whom might otherwise have gone to
competing hospitals in the area.</LD>
<LD>   Cardiac services bring prestige and, usually, nice profits for
hospitals. In California, for example, the average hospital charge
for open-heart surgery is about $78,000, although insurers often
negotiate significant discounts. At some hospitals, only maternity
services contribute a bigger chunk of revenue than heart programs.</LD>
<TE>   To hospital executives, cardiac services also look like a
financial winner as the nation's population grows older. The federal
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality estimates that one in
every four hospital stays includes at least one cardiovascular
procedure.</TE>
<TE>   But the expansion of heart programs at Mission and other hospitals
in California raises some issues about health-care costs and quality.
Do we really need so many hospitals chasing the same heart patients?
Does the cost of new facilities, with their staffs and latest
technology, drive up the cost of health care? And because research
shows a connection between the frequency of hospital procedures and
medical quality, are all California hospitals performing enough heart
procedures to ensure good outcomes?</TE>
<TE>   Americans have always bought toothpaste, cars and most everything
else based on advertising pitches and testimonials like the ones for
Mission. Health care, it can be argued, is different. If you choose
Crest and don't like it, you can switch to Colgate. But when you
undergo bypass surgery, you can't move to another hospital to finish
the operation if things go wrong. If you make a bad decision about
health care, the results can be with you for life.</TE>
<TE>   "There are differences in quality out there. All providers are not
the same," said Loel Solomon, deputy director for health-care quality
at the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development in
Sacramento. "Consumers need to understand that their decisions
matter."</TE>
<TE>   Mission's brochure notes that the hospital performs nearly 300
heart surgeries each year. But are 300 heart surgeries a year a lot
or a little, a patient might well ask. OSHPD data show that most of
the state's hospitals perform fewer coronary artery bypass grafts, or
CABG, procedures than necessary to achieve superior outcomes.
Research shows that "hospitals that do less than 500 bypass surgeries
a year have, on average, much higher mortality rates than hospitals
that do more of these procedures," says Dr. Mark Chassin, an expert
on health quality at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in New York City.
"The problem in California is that there is a proliferation of very
low-volume hospitals and a correspondingly higher mortality rate."</TE>
<TE>   In New York, for example, state regulations require that CABG
surgery be performed only at hospitals that do the highest number of
these operations. Death rates from the procedure are among the lowest
in the nation. California has no such regulations. That means that
California hospitals can build new cardiac centers without having to
demonstrate to the state that there is an unmet need for the service.</TE>
<TE>   According to the OSHPD report, only 18% of California hospitals
performed more than 500 CABG operations in 1997 and 1998, the period
studied. More than half did fewer than 200 to 300 procedures, the
minimum range recommended by the American College of Cardiology. One
facility, Beverly Hospital, which serves the Greater Los Angeles
area, performed only 37 procedures. Mission Hospital performed 297
procedures, a similar number to three competing hospitals in south
Orange County, but well below the quality yardstick of 500 annual
procedures cited by Chassin.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone anticipating open heart surgery should know how many
procedures the hospital has performed, as well as its death rates
from CABG surgery, which allows an apples-to-apples comparison among
hospitals. You can find this information on OSHPD's Web site at
www.oshpd.state.ca.us.</TE>
<TE>   OSHPD also has comparisons that show how well hospitals have cared
for heart attack patients. And a survey issued in August by the
California Healthcare Foundation and the California Institute for
Health Systems Performance shows how hospitals stack up when it comes
to patients' satisfaction with their hospital experience. Call (888)
430-2423 for copies of guides to hospitals in your region. A
California law approved last year also moves in the direction of
putting more information in patients' hands. The law, which takes
effect in 2005, requires hospitals in the state to submit data
showing outcomes for coronary artery bypass surgery, as well as the
performance of individual surgeons.</TE>
<TE>   Though many doctors and hospitals are uncomfortable with the idea
of being compared publicly with each other, the new law should help
chip away at a culture that says medical decisions are too complex
for patients to understand.</TE>

<LD>Question: You recently mentioned an elliptical machine but didn't
explain what it is. Also, is a rowing machine appropriate for someone
with low-back problems?</LD>
<LD>   CATHERINE GRANT WIEDER</LD>
<LD>   Cerritos</LD>
<TE>   Answer: An elliptical machine simulates walking, stepping, cycling
and skiing using an elliptical motion with low or no impact. It's
designed for all levels and can offer a good workout without
stressing joints. However, the term "elliptical machine" is
broad--not all machines are cross-trainers, and not all offer a
full-body workout.</TE>
<TE>   As for back problems, an elliptical machine should provide a safe,
low-impact aerobic workout (provided you don't increase the
elevation). I'd also recommend a recumbent bike or treadmill. Hold
off on the rowing machine--the motion could stress your lower back.</TE>

<LD>Anemia Lifeline</LD>
<LD>   www.anemia.com</LD>
<LD>   Overview: Lifeline is meant as a basic resource for people
suffering from anemia--a condition in which blood doesn't adequately
supply the body with oxygen, causing fatigue, weakness and often
dizziness. Sponsors include the National Kidney Foundation and Amgen,
the maker of one of the top-selling anemia drugs.</LD>
<TE>   What works: The site is organized the way we think: It starts with
the symptom (anemia) and works backward to explain causes. These
include vitamin deficiencies, drug side effects, kidney disease and
cancer. Lifeline also provides a few basics about hemoglobin levels,
which help in diagnosing the condition. But beyond this the site is,
well, anemic. There is little about the science behind the condition.</TE>

medicine.</DH>

<LD>Dr. Stephen E. Straus has never tried acupuncture. He has never gone
to a chiropractor, nor has he ever swallowed a Chinese herb. Millions
of Americans have used complementary medical approaches, but Straus
is not one of them.</LD>
<LD>   Some might find this unusual, since it is Straus who leads the
federal government's research effort aimed at finding out what works
and what doesn't in this controversial medical field. Straus
describes his abstinence as more the result of his robust physical
condition than a product of his inherent scientific skepticism. "I
have no symptoms," he says. "I'm healthy."</LD>
<LD>   And he points out that his personal skepticism is an essential
part of doing science. "Otherwise," he says, "there wouldn't be any
point to studying things." This has been the core of his approach to
his job as director of the National Center for Complementary and
Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), part of the National Institutes of
Health. Many observers believe his perspective finally may bring
credibility to the field and to a federal research effort that, by
all accounts, got off to a rocky start when it began 10 years ago.</LD>
<TE>   Alternative medicine--or "complementary" medicine--has been the
subject of debate for many years. Although nontraditional therapies
such as acupuncture and herbs have been embraced by consumers, many
mainstream doctors continue to scorn them. To be sure, it is possible
that many alternative therapies actually work, even if scientists
don't know exactly why. It is also possible that many do not work.
And there is growing concern that some therapies may even be
dangerous, especially nutritional supplements and herbs that remain
largely unregulated for safety and effectiveness by the federal
government.</TE>
<TE>   But as these therapies gain acceptance with the public, more
physicians, hospitals and medical schools have begun to embrace them
in recent years. Acupuncture, chiropractic, biofeedback and herbal
remedies, for example, are routinely used. Some health insurers cover
them, though most don't.</TE>
<TE>   By all measures, alternative medicine stands on the cusp of
respectability--as the mainstream medical world waits for the science
to come in.</TE>
<TE>   That's where Straus' center will play a crucial role. Its mandate
is to oversee rigorous studies that will prove or disprove the worth
of many of these alternative approaches. So far, the center has
produced few significant findings, as only in the past few years has
it embarked on the type of large-scale research studies that are
likely to make headlines; most of those studies are not yet
completed. Their outcome could have a profound influence on future
medical practice and health care policies in this country.</TE>
<TE>   "If it is clearly demonstrated that these [alternative] approaches
work, then they will be rapidly incorporated into many medical
practices," said Dr. William Roper, dean of the University of North
Carolina School of Public Health and a former director of the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "It has the potential to
change medicine in dramatic ways."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. David Kessler, dean of Yale University's medical school,
echoes that sentiment. "At some point, all therapies move along the
spectrum from experimental to the mainstream," said Kessler, a former
commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. "If the data
are there, it makes no difference what the origins of the therapies
are, or their active ingredients--they will be accepted and move into
the mainstream."</TE>
<TE>   The center was created by Congress in 1992 at the urging of Sen.
Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), a devotee of alternative treatments. The goal
was to draw attention to the field and study alternative medical
approaches. But the relatively small office had a tiny budget and no
real authority to fund credible research on its own.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, it became a controversial symbol of the friction between
alternative-medicine advocates and those seeking to debunk the field.
Straus' two predecessors had a difficult time reconciling these
tensions and struggled with the office's inability to promote or
support legitimate research without the blessing of other institutes.</TE>
<TE>   At Harkin's urging, and in the face of opposition from Dr. Harold
Varmus, then director of the NIH, Congress elevated the office to a
center in the fall of 1998. The Clinton administration chose Straus,
a stranger to the world of alternative medicine, as the first
director.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Director Has History  in Traditional Science</TE>
<TE>   Straus, 55, is the quintessential NIH insider whose background is
deeply grounded in traditional science. He has degrees from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Columbia University College
of Physicians and Surgeons. As a researcher, he has spent roughly 23
years at NIH, studying AIDS, Lyme disease and chronic fatigue
syndrome, among other illnesses. Straus was widely criticized by
chronic fatigue syndrome advocates for suggesting, at one point, that
the condition had a psychological component. He was chief of the
laboratory of clinical investigation at the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases before taking his current assignment.</TE>
<TE>   His selection was such a surprise that people in the field of
alternative and complementary therapies weren't even sure how to
react. "There was a watch-and-wait from the academic university
world, wondering: Would he be allowed to do good science?" said Dr.
Brian Berman, a professor at the University of Maryland School of
Medicine in Baltimore and director of the school's program on
complementary medicine. "At the same time, he was very concerned that
we would perceive him as the enemy. He has tried to be very clear
with us that NIH is about doing excellent science."</TE>
<TE>   Some proponents of alternative medicine were nervous about what
Straus might do. But in more than two years since assuming leadership
of the center, Straus eased many of their initial concerns. He has
launched credible studies of popular alternative remedies, involved
other institutes in the research process and seems committed to
learning more about the field, observers say.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel like he's done a lot to professionalize the center and
get good people there to run the research," said a Harkin spokesman
who asked that his name not be used. "Research on complementary and
alternative medicine faces an even higher hurdle in terms of scrutiny
by the medical field, and that makes it all the more important to
have the work be unquestioned science. He has made that a big focal
point for the center."</TE>
<TE>   Berman agrees, saying Straus rose to the challenge of a difficult
job. "I was amazed with how quickly he grasped the issues," he said.
"And he really is trying to bring this into the mainstream."</TE>
<TE>   In this country, medical practice depends heavily on scientific
results. Without them, treatments are slow to move into routine
practice and won't be covered by health insurance. This is true for
nontraditional remedies as much as for anything else, despite the
fact that an oft-cited survey taken five years ago estimated that at
least 42% of Americans use some form of alternative treatments.</TE>
<TE>   People "need and deserve answers," said Straus. "Studies take a
long time, but we have established the right base." While most NIH
research is aimed at discovering new science, "here we're grappling
with things people are using today, and have been for thousands of
years, and looking at them through the lens of contemporary science,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike its precursor, the center has a hefty budget of nearly $105
million and autonomy, including the power to initiate research on its
own, although most of the major studies are being conducted in
collaboration with other institutes.</TE>
<TE>   When the Office of Alternative Medicine was created 10 years ago,
it was a "coordinating" office located within the NIH director's
office. Coordinating offices are established by Congress and do not
have the capability to issue grant announcements or fund research
grants. Their role is to coordinate research in a particular area.
Institutes and centers, however, actually can issue research grants.</TE>
<TE>   Center funding for the current fiscal year is $104.6 million, plus
more than $100 million from other institutes for collaborative
studies--a total of roughly $220 million.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, the center is sponsoring a range of research
into the effects of supplements, botanicals and other products
already in popular use, among them ginkgo biloba, saw palmetto, and
glucosamine and chondroitin.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the NIH center-funded research includes:</TE>
<TE>   * The first U.S. multi-center study to investigate glucosamine and
chondroitin, two dietary supplements widely marketed as natural
remedies for osteoarthritis. In September 1999, the center, in
collaboration with the National Institute of Arthritis and
Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, awarded a research grant to the
University of Utah to test the efficacy of the combination for knee
pain associated with osteoarthritis.</TE>
<TE>   * A collaboration with the National Institute on Aging on a
six-year trial of an extract of ginkgo biloba to see if it can help
prevent age-related dementia. Researchers from the University of
Pittsburgh School of Medicine are coordinating the study, which will
enroll 3,000 individuals in four clinical centers.</TE>
<TE>   * A research project involving 15 cancer centers to study the
impact of complementary therapies on the disease. The most recent
grants included $8 million to Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore
and the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   * A broad study to examine the so-called placebo effect, in which
patients experience health benefits if they think they are taking a
drug, even when it turns out to be a medically worthless dummy pill.
This study is still in the design phase.</TE>
<TE>   Straus sees endless possibilities and says he is particularly
interested in research about the so-called mind-body connection. He
cites a Stanford University hypnosis study, in which body changes
actually could be measured. Study participants underwent hypnosis and
were hooked up to a PET scanner, which measures blood flow in the
brain. The researchers then asked participants to view pictures in
black and white and color. When the subjects viewed the black and
white pictures, they were told that it was really in color, and
researchers actually saw increased blood flow to the specific
portions of the brain that process color. Blood flow decreased when
the people were shown color pictures but told they were looking at
black and white images.</TE>
<TE>   "What was important was what people perceived," Straus said.
"These kinds of studies help inform us of the tools we can bring to
bear in the practice of medicine."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the center's research results are years away; however, the
findings from a study on St. John's wort for depression, which began
three years ago, are scheduled for publication in a scientific
journal within a few months.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Center Has Encountered Some Bumps in the Road</TE>
<TE>   But the path to scrupulously designed clinical trials has not been
entirely smooth. Like the rest of NIH, the center must grapple with
input from Congress, whose members often believe they should have a
say about how money is spent by government-funded agencies. Harkin,
for example, was not entirely pleased with the design of the St.
John's wort study, believing that it did not take into account that
most consumers use the herb to treat mild to moderate depression, not
more severe forms, says his aide. "This [study] won't give the vast
majority of the people using it information on what they are using it
for," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the center is sponsoring a five-year, $1.4-million study of
a regimen promoted by New York physician Nicholas Gonzalez using
pancreatic enzymes, coffee enemas and dietary supplements to treat
pancreatic cancer. The treatment piqued the interest of Rep. Dan
Burton (R-Ind.), who four years ago urged the National Cancer
Institute to study it.</TE>
<TE>   Straus insists that the study is valid. "The center studies
[alternative] therapies that Americans are using and those where
preliminary results suggest that a particular therapy may work," he
said. "In the case of the Gonzalez nutritional regimen, this was not
politically thrust on the NIH by Congress."</TE>
<TE>   The center decided to study the Gonzalez regimen in a small but
prospective study because the preliminary data suggested that it
prolonged life in patients who would otherwise die of pancreatic
cancer, he said. The disease kills nearly 30,000 Americans each year.</TE>
<TE>   Straus, not specifically addressing the Gonzalez study, feels that
some avenues are worth exploring scientifically if consumers are
using them, "even if ultimately they are shown not to work."</TE>
<TE>   The University of Maryland's Berman agrees. "I know there are
people who say the center is funding frivolous studies, and that it's
all political, but I haven't seen that," said Berman, a researcher
whose arthritis work is being funded by the center. "This field is
about alternative and complementary therapy. So some people might say
none of it should be evaluated."</TE>
<TE>   Straus points out that Congress also has asked the center to
pursue studies many regard as scientifically sound. For example,
lawmakers asked the NIH center to study the value of cranberry in
preventing urinary tract infections. Cranberry is a preventive remedy
most women have known about and used for years by drinking its juice.
Many women, including some female physicians, swear by it.</TE>
<TE>   "But there's no proof," Straus said. "Congress asked us to do it,
and we'd already decided months earlier to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Straus acknowledges that when he took this job he knew little
about the field in which he now plays a key role. "What I knew about
complementary and alternative medicine was what I'd read," he said,
"and what my patients told me about."</TE>
<TE>   Now, he says, he finds his new world of research exciting.
"Science is about measurement.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not enough for someone to testify he or she feels better. We
need to measure it and understand it. That's what it is all about."</TE>

<LD>A century ago Americans expected to lose their teeth by middle age.</LD>
<LD>   Now, of course, dentures and old age don't have to be synonymous.
With declines in tooth decay since the 1970s and an emphasis on
prevention, fewer people are toothless today than a generation
ago--30% of adults 65 or older compared with 46% two decades ago,
according to the U.S. Surgeon General's report on oral health in
America. Periodontal disease, commonly called gum disease, is the
main cause of tooth loss in adults after age 35. It is an insidious
bacterial infection of the gum and the bone, which holds teeth in
place.</LD>
<LD>   Growing evidence shows that a healthy mouth should be much more
than a cosmetic concern. Bacteria in the mouth and the byproducts of
the infection they cause can travel into the bloodstream to other
parts of the body. Research published in the Journal of
Periodontology in 1998 revealed that periodontal infection might
contribute to the development of heart disease; increase the risk of
premature, underweight births; and pose a threat to people whose
health already is compromised because of diabetes and respiratory
diseases.</LD>
<TE>   There is a two-way street between periodontal disease and
diabetes. "Diabetics are much more likely to have advanced
periodontal disease when they don't have their blood sugar under
control," said Dr. Kenneth Bueltmann, president of the American
Academy of Periodontology, an organization of dentists specializing
in diagnosis and treatment of tissues surrounding the teeth. "And
diabetics with periodontal disease have a harder time controlling
their blood-sugar level."</TE>
<TE>   Osteoporosis, a bone disorder found chiefly in post-menopausal
women, also is a factor in tooth loss.</TE>
<TE>   Women with untreated osteoporosis tend to have less resistance to
periodontal disease and experience more bone and tooth loss,
Bueltmann said. The mouth teems with bacteria, which cause no problem
until the bacteria start to colonize and form dental plaque, a
sticky, colorless film that constantly forms on the teeth. It's the
plaque that causes tooth decay and gum disease.</TE>
<TE>   "The bacteria in the mouth need a minimum of 24 to 48 hours to
colonize in enough numbers that they start to produce the acid and
enzyme systems that destroy the hardest part of your body, tooth
enamel, and/or gums," said Dr. Richard Price, a Boston-area dentist
and a consumer advisor for the American Dental Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The recommended artillery is a soft-bristled toothbrush and dental
floss. Flossing between the teeth at least once a day and a thorough
brushing two to three times a day scatter the bacteria so they cannot
build dental plaque, Price said. The mildest form of gum disease is
gingivitis, marked by gums that redden, swell and bleed easily. It's
reversible with professional treatment and proper brushing and
flossing.</TE>
<TE>   Untreated gingivitis can progress to periodontitis, in which the
plaque forces the gum to detach from the tooth, forming pockets that
become infected. When the pockets deepen, more gum tissue and bone
are destroyed. Eventually, teeth can become loose. Dentists often
treat mild cases of gum disease, but severe cases are referred to a
periodontist.</TE>
<TE>   "First we get after the causative factors, the bacterial plaque,
by good home care and by removing the tartar [hard deposits] where
it's irritating the gums and also causing more inflammation and
infection," Bueltmann said. "As you lose bone around the teeth, these
hard deposits start to creep down into the pocket that forms around
the teeth. The pocket becomes deeper and much harder to clean."</TE>
<TE>   A periodontist will clean around the teeth using a meticulous,
delicate process called hand scaling and root planing that can
require up to an hour for each quarter of the mouth. Even before
treatment is started, a periodontist will want to rule out systemic
problems such as diabetes, Bueltmann said.</TE>
<TE>   That might require a physical exam if a patient has not had one in
a long time. Patients also are counseled about risk factors. "We
advise patients to stop smoking and eat well," Bueltmann said.
"Proper diet is important. Calcium and vitamin C intake are
important.</TE>
<TE>   "Those with calcium deficiencies have twice the incidence of
periodontal disease and more bone loss. Resistance isn't as great and
they lose bone quicker. Those with vitamin C deficiencies tend to
have more inflammation." Smoking, he said, lowers resistance to gum
disease. Pack-a-day cigarette smokers have a four times greater risk
of advanced gum disease compared with nonsmokers.</TE>
<TE>   If periodontal disease is caught early enough, the deep cleaning
and proper home care will considerably reduce the disease process.
When patients do not respond to that conventional treatment,
antibiotics sometimes are used. Some are squirted into the pockets to
reduce the infection, or patients may take them orally.</TE>
<TE>   If cuffs around the teeth are too deep to keep clean, a surgical
treatment can reduce them to a more shallow level. The gums are freed
(or cut) and repositioned to tighten them back to the teeth,
Bueltmann said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Various Options for Saving Loose Teeth</TE>
<TE>   If the teeth are loose, there still are options, depending on how
severe the situation is.</TE>
<TE>   Bueltmann said that sometimes the teeth are loose not only because
of bone loss but also because the bite pressure on those teeth is too
heavy. "If the tooth is high on the bite, you can adjust it by
shaving on the tooth to get it hitting evenly with the others."</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to keep teeth from becoming looser, a retainer,
called a bite guard appliance or night guard, can be worn while
sleeping. Generally worn over the upper teeth, he said, it keeps the
upper teeth--usually the ones to loosen most--from being ground on.
"When the teeth are loose, there's a tendency to grind and clench
more while sleeping, making them even looser."</TE>
<TE>   One way of replacing teeth is with dental implants. The
artificial, metallic implant is placed in the bone socket where the
root of the tooth used to be, and the bone tightens up around the
implant. "An artificial crown is placed on top of the implant,
restoring chewing and aesthetics. It's a very effective way of
replacing missing teeth, providing there's enough bone remaining to
place the implant in," Bueltmann said.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Sab Mukherjee, head of periodontics at the University of
Illinois College of Dentistry, called dental implants, which have
about a 20-year history, "one major advancement in dentistry to
replace lost teeth. The success rate is extremely good so far."
Periodontics also have advanced to the point at which bone can be
regrown in certain cases of bone loss around teeth.</TE>
<TE>   Bueltmann said new biotech treatments encourage bone cells to grow
and reattach to the roots of the teeth. Products waiting in the wings
include "bone morphogenic proteins" that can be placed in isolated
areas with a sponge applicator, releasing a growth factor that
enables bone to regenerate. It is being tested on humans.</TE>
<TE>   Dentists are learning more about susceptibility to gum disease,
and evidence has accumulated showinggenetics play a major role in the
onset and severity of the disease. A study published last fall in the
Journal of Periodontology showed that in 64 pairs of identical and 53
pairs of fraternal twins, 48% to 59% of the differences in two
measures of periodontal disease (gum-attachment loss and depth of
pockets) could be attributed to genetics.</TE>
<TE>   When correlating eight clinical measures for gum disease among the
two types of twins, all eight measures were statistically significant
in identical twins while only two measures were statistically
significant in fraternal twins. Asked if some degree of periodontal
disease is inevitable as one ages, Bueltmann said: "It's preventable,
so it's not inevitable. It's not related to age. Healthy individuals
can have healthy teeth and gums. Statistically, older people tend to
get more disease because they've had more opportunity to have it. But
it's definitely preventable."</TE>

<HD>How Diet Plays a Role in Asthma Attacks</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>AMANDA URSELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some 14.6 million Americans have asthma, a chronic lung problem that
causes difficulty breathing, and 5,000 people die from it each year.
Most sufferers know the disorder requires medical management, but too
few realize that it is not just the symptoms that can be tackled but
also many of the causes.</LD>
<LD>   Attacks can be triggered by internal factors such as stress and
infections and external factors such as dust, pollen, tobacco smoke
and pollution. Whatever the cause, the end result is the same--the
lung's airways swell and tighten, restricting airflow. When this
happens, cells lining the lungs' bronchial tubes release the chemical
histamine, which causes inflammation and production of excess mucus,
making breathing even more difficult. Avoiding smoky rooms, areas
with high pollen counts and air pollution, plus finding ways to
combat stress, are sensible ways to tackle such underlying causes of
asthma. But a person's diet may also reduce or increase the
likelihood of an attack.</LD>
<TE>   Research has shown that fewer attacks occur in populations that
consume large amounts of fruits and vegetables and that asthmatics
with low levels of vitamin C in their blood have more problems with
wheezing. Scientists suggest this relationship could be attributed to
the delicate balance between oxidants and antioxidants in the lung.
It is the introduction of excess oxidants, via smoke and pollutants,
for instance, that is at the root of an attack.</TE>
<TE>   Vitamin C is the major antioxidant present in the lining of the
lungs and appears to reduce the risk of symptoms. Papaya, guava,
black currants, green, red and yellow peppers, broccoli,
strawberries, kiwi fruit and oranges are not only rich in this
vitamin but seem to prevent the release of histamine. Quercetin, a
plant nutrient present in onions, apples, kale, broad beans, leeks,
tea and berries, has a similar effect, mopping up oxidants and
lessening inflammation by blocking histamine. The anti-inflammatory
properties of omega-3 fatty acids found in oily fish such as salmon,
mackerel and tuna, may also be helpful.</TE>
<TE>   Just as certain foods may help control asthma, others should be
avoided when trying to reduce attacks. At the top of the list come
foods containing "sulfites," a term referring to a variety of
additives used in food to prevent browning. They may be listed on
food labels as sulfur dioxide, sodium sulfite, sodium or potassium
bisulfite or sodium or potassium metabisulfite. Whichever the form,
in sulfite-sensitive asthmatics, consumption can spark intense
reactions.</TE>
<TE>   Although no longer permitted for use in ingredients in restaurant
salad bars, sulfites can be found in many packaged foods including
dried fruits, dehydrated potatoes and fruit juices, gelatin,
maraschino cherries, lemon juice, salad dressings and sauces from dry
mixes, shrimp and canned seafood soups, pickled products and canned
or dried soups.</TE>
<TE>   Milk and eggs have also been linked to asthma attacks, especially
in children. If this is suspected, a careful exclusion diet must be
followed under the guidance of a registered dietitian to diagnose the

<HD>When Impotence Threatens Sex Life--and Marriage</HD>
<DH>A couple's book chronicles how they reclaimed and redefined
intimacy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHLEEN KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Keith Laken was 49 years old, doctors discovered he had prostate
cancer. Faced with the prospect of an operation that could cause
permanent impotence, Keith announced to his wife that he would rather
die. Over the next months, the couple argued intensely over what to
do next. Virginia Laken, his wife of 25 years, insisted sex didn't
matter, certainly not as much as life. Keith claimed that erectile
dysfunction would make him as good as the walking dead. Ultimately,
he chose life. He had a radical prostatectomy in February 1995. The
operation did save his life but nearly ruined his marriage.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakens chronicle their experience and offer graphic details
about their struggle in "Making Love Again: Hope for Couples Facing
Loss of Sexual Intimacy" (Ant Hill Press, 2002). The book was written
by Virginia Laken and is interspersed with their individual journal
entries.</LD>
<LD>   "The book is so graphic and so gutsy," said Dr. James Talcott,
director of the Center for Outcomes Research Massachusetts General
Hospital Cancer Center in Boston. "The Lakens very nicely
recapitulate the dynamic of initially responding to the threat of
death from cancer and doing everything you can to prevent it and then
dealing with the complex issues of how our identity--wrapped up in
who we are sexually--is affected."</LD>
<TE>   The Lakens, who live in Minnesota, hope to help some of the 10
million to 15 million U.S. men who suffer from impotence. According
to the Lakens' research, 1 out of 20 men do not seek help because
they are either too embarrassed or prefer to avoid sex rather than
seek treatment. "As we got healthy, we felt very sorry that there
were so many couples who had given up on sexual intimacy and never
pursued it again," said Virginia, a business communications
consultant. "We wrote the book for people who want to give up. I
think couples struggling with erectile dysfunction need to hear it
from people who have been through it and succeeded."</TE>
<TE>   The book takes place over the three years following Keith's
surgery, a time when the Lakens were forced to redefine the ways they
communicated, how they made love and the roles they played in
initiating sex.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter what you lose, a loved one or a physical capability,
there is a certain amount of anger which then turns to mourning,"
said Keith, 56, an executive manager for Watlow Electric Corp. He
felt emasculated and worried that he would be perceived as weak and
ineffective.</TE>
<TE>   "I was angry because I wasn't quite sure I had been presented with
all my treatment options by doctors or all my options in the sex
department," he said. "I was angry about the paucity of information
about what is good sex for someone [like me]."</TE>
<TE>   About four months after the surgery, it became clear that Keith
would not regain spontaneous erectile function. They experimented
but, eventually frustrated by limitation, Keith withdrew from
physical intimacy. "I realized the hopelessness of ever getting it
back to what it was before the surgery," he said. "It started to sink
in."</TE>
<TE>   For a while, penile injections, which restore erectile functioning
for sustained periods, helped. (Viagra did not work for him.)</TE>
<TE>   "The injections jump-started our sex life again," said Virginia.
But soon Keith--like most men who use them--grew tired of them. He
announced to Virginia that he no longer desired sex. "For me, that
was the most painful moment," said Virginia, who is 55. "We had been
married almost 30 years at that point, and Keith had always been a
very sexual person. I had taken it for granted that he was turned on
every time [he] saw me naked. Then like a light switch turning off,
he said 'I don't need it anymore.' It made me realize how
unattractive I felt."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakens grew distant, and eventually stopped trying to be
physically intimate. After nearly three months of no physical
intimacy, the Lakens decided that their relationship was unraveling.
It had been a little over a year after the surgery and they had
stopped even touching one another.</TE>
<TE>   In a stab at marital preservation, the couple discussed having
"sex dates" at least once a week with a no-rejection rule. Virginia
accepted that she would have to be the initiator. They agreed to
redefine sexual intimacy to mean "giving each other physical
pleasure, which may or may not lead to orgasm but will maintain their
human connection."</TE>
<TE>   But first they saw a psychologist who helped Keith deal with the
emotional issues inextricably bound up with his sexual identity. "The
psychologist affirmed that I still had a libido because I told him I
think about sex about 90 seconds of every minute and that was a real
confidence builder," said Keith. "The other thing I realized was I
didn't want to be a victim, and I didn't want people to pity me.... I
went back to taking control of my life. I moved the topic from the
brunt of locker-room jokes in my mind to being in control and getting
on top of my game with it. This turned it around for me.</TE>
<TE>   "The no-rejection rule was the best way to get back into the
relationship," he added. "Virginia coaxed me back into sexual
intimacy."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakens' therapy effectively bridged the months-long physical
and emotional chasm that had chilled their relationship. Keith
started using the injections again, which became smoother and less
cumbersome with practice.</TE>
<TE>   But most important, said Keith, was the realization that erectile
dysfunction is a couples' issue, not just a man's issue. "When I
said, 'I am not interested in sex anymore,' I opened up a big wound
for my wife," he said. "That was the first time I had rejected
Virginia. If she had gone along when I said sex didn't matter to me
anymore, life might have turned out differently."</TE>
<TE>   Today, sex may not be spontaneous, but the Lakens, who speak to
support groups for couples, say it is much richer and more satisfying
than before. "In hindsight, we realized more clearly what had
happened when we looked at our sexual relationship today compared to
the way it was," said Virginia. "We couldn't rebuild it until we let
it go completely. Some of it from the past we could keep. Some of it
we couldn't. We were forced to reinvent our sexual identity as
individuals and as a couple."</TE>

<LD>NEGOTIATING WITH THE DEAD</LD>
<LD>   A Writer on Writing</LD>
<LD>   By Margaret Atwood</LD>
<TE>   Cambridge University Press</TE>
<TE>   220 pages, $18</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Almost anyone can write, but relatively few people actually become
professional writers. In the Canada of the 1940s and 1950s, as
Margaret Atwood remembers it, anyone with aspirations in that
direction was regarded with suspicion: not for nothing did Canadian
writer Alice Munro title one of her story collections "Who Do You
Think You Are?" Unappreciated by their fellow countrymen, aspiring
authors also worried about being considered too provincial by the
wider world: After all, everyone knew that real writers lived in
places like London or New York.</TE>
<TE>   All that has certainly changed, and Atwood has been a highly
visible part of that change. In 2000, the internationally known poet
and novelist took up Cambridge University's invitation to deliver a
series of six lectures on the rather general subject of writing and
being a writer.</TE>
<TE>   The six essays contained in "Negotiating With the Dead" grew out
of those six lectures. The result is an engaging book--erudite yet
informal, playfully witty yet down-to-earth.</TE>
<TE>   Atwood's focus is on what it feels like to be a writer. She
consults her personal experience, she reports what other writers have
told her, and, of course, she looks at what famous writers, past and
present, living or dead, have had to say on the subject.</TE>
<TE>   The first essay draws on her youthful experiences. With humor
borne of hindsight, she recounts some of the ways in which she
naively hoped to earn a living by her pen (composing romance novels
turned out to be harder than she'd reckoned). She describes how she
felt on composing her first poem while crossing the football field on
her way home from high school. She recalls how surprised she was in
college to discover the previously unsuspected existence of arty
coteries right under her nose. She also remembers wondering, as she
observed the uneven quality of the work recited at coffeehouses and
published in literary journals, how on earth a budding author could
tell whether her work was really any good.</TE>
<TE>   For the writer inhabits, at the very least, two worlds: the world
of imagination and language in which writing is done and the world in
which one needs to make a living and a name for oneself.</TE>
<TE>   If not endowed with extra-literary sources of financial support,
how do writers make their livings? "The money factor," Atwood rightly
notes in her essay on that topic, "is often underplayed in
biographies of writers, the biographer being as a rule much more
fascinated by love affairs, neuroses, addictions, influences,
diseases, and bad habits generally.... When I found I was a writer at
the age of sixteen, money was the last thing on my mind, but it
shortly became the first." Yet the true value of a work of art, she
reminds us, is not determined by the marketplace. Nor, on the other
hand, is a writer's high-minded indifference to such grubby concerns
a guarantee of the high quality of her work.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Louis Stevenson's Jekyll and Hyde, Robert Browning's Childe
Roland, Oscar Wilde's Dorian Gray, Lewis Carroll's Alice, Jorge Luis
Borges' dual persona in "Borges and I" are among the presiding
spirits of Atwood's essay on the double-ness of being a writer. On
the one hand, there's "the person when no writing is going
forward--the one who walks the dog, eats bran for regularity, takes
the car in to be washed ... --and that other, more shadowy and
altogether more equivocal personage who shares the same body, and
who, when no one is looking, takes it over and uses it to commit the
actual writing."</TE>
<TE>   The soul who would not harm a fly in real life may, in her
capacity as a writer, create fictional scenes of heinous crimes or
heart-rending tragedies. Another, even more unavoidable, kind of
double-ness seems intrinsic to the very process of writing anything
down: The words on the page come to have an existence of their own,
even as the person who inscribed them there goes on to develop and
change.</TE>
<TE>   Another essay examines the question of the writer's moral
responsibilities. Though the aesthetic doctrine of l'art pour l'art
urged artists to free themselves from moralistic concerns and devote
themselves entirely to their art, Atwood points out that it is also
true that "like it or not--language has a moral dimension built into
it." If a novelist tells a story, readers will make moral judgments
about what happens in it. Here again, Atwood has no firm and simple
answer to the questions she airs, but she discusses these perennial
conundrums with vivacity, verve and common sense.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, if one discerns a certain lack in her general approach, it
is not that she is sometimes inconclusive, but rather that she
sometimes sounds a little too glib and pleased with her performance,
more interested in strutting her stuff than in truly engaging the
questions she raises.</TE>
<TE>   The magical, intense relationship between two people who may never
have met--the writer and the reader--is the subject of Atwood's
penultimate essay, while her closing chapter is a meditation on what
she sees as the writer's journey to the underworld in search of
creative material. And for the reader, too, she points out, "A book
is another country. You enter it, but then you must leave; like the
Underworld, you can't live there." Atwood's riffs on writing not only
will delight readers who are fans of her fiction but also may serve
to cheer fledgling writers as they set out on their imaginative
journeys.</TE>

<HD>In Twilight Years, She Is Shining</HD>
<DH>Julia Cunningham is going strong in her 80s with a
sought-after collection of poetry and a children's book that's
selling briskly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHLEEN SHARP</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Julia Cunningham basks in the winter sun, dressed in a soft stir of
blue wool, surrounded by her stuffed totems: a furry fox, two moles
and a much-respected wolf. At 80-something, the poet and children's
author looks grandmotherly, but she possesses the intense gaze and
unabashed wonder of a young girl. "It's like a miracle," she says,
referring to her recent run of luck.</LD>
<LD>   Cunningham's lush children's book, "The Stable Rat and Other
Christmas Poems" (Greenwillow Books, 2001), is selling briskly after
garnering a dozen excellent reviews; the New York Times called it
"powerful" and "stirring." Her book of grown-up poems, "The Shadow
Heart" (Fithian Press, 2000), is a collector's item now that it is
out of print after two runs. A production company just purchased the
rights to her 1962 classic "Macaroon," the tale of a girl whose
parents are perpetually absent.</LD>
<LD>   And this fall, Random House will reissue Cunningham's 1965 work
"Dorp Dead," the groundbreaking book that critics said introduced a
sinister psychological reality into the children's book genre. Nearly
all of Cunningham's 22 books center on abandoned, sometimes abused,
children who endure psychological isolation before their spiritual
release. Animals and allegory inhabit her fables, which seem grim but
never hopeless.</LD>
<TE>   Take the protagonist in "Dorp Dead." The orphan Gilly--a poor
speller--is apprenticed to a carpenter who tries to cage him. Gilly
saves himself from the psychotic man through his love for his dog,
his connection to nature and the mysterious Hunter. When Gilly
finally escapes, he leaves the carpenter a note to "Dorp Dead!"</TE>
<TE>   "I remember when 'Dorp Dead' was the most talked-about book in the
business," said Janet Schulman, vice president of Random House
Children's Books. "It's an uplifting story that is beautifully
written, but it's like a dark, gothic mystery. I think it will
resonate with today's young adults."</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham regularly visited California schoolchildren for
decades, until she began losing the use of one leg. "I can't tell you
how many letters I've gotten from children who want to hear how
Gilly's doing," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Cunningham is notoriously reclusive with adults. Yet when the
talk shifts to writing, she becomes open and preternaturally young.
She wears her hair like a 9-year-old: bobbed at the chin with bangs
pinned back with a barrette. Her face is wrinkled, but her complexion
is soft and downy. Her blue eyes shine like minnows, and she's sporty
in pleated skirts and white anklets. She prefaces her sharp
observations with a polite "Perhaps you'll agree with me..."</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham says she's self-educated, and her friends joke about
her "orphanology" degree. She has mined her childhood pain to
construct her brutally--and beautifully--honest narratives. "Kids
understand everything as long as it's true," she explained.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Spokane, Wash., around 1920, Cunningham was packed around
in a bureau drawer as her family moved. Her grandfather owned one of
the first banks in Montana, and "he used to collect gold dust from
the miners" as payments and deposits. Her mother was raised in
privilege. The family left the West for New York, where Cunningham's
father worked as an engineer.</TE>
<TE>   Life was idyllic until Cunningham turned 6. That's when she beheld
her last true Christmas--"a tall candlelit tree hovering over a
magical model village ... the last gift of a father who was to
disappear...." He walked out on his wife and three children. For the
next two Yuletides, Cunningham watched for his return. At 9, she gave
up waiting and fell seriously ill. The girl eventually recovered but
was never quite the same.</TE>
<TE>   "I would become a pretender," she wrote in a 1986 memoir. So began
the poet's incubation. Her mother moved the family like nomads for
years. During the Depression, Cunningham and her family "lost every
cent" after the family bank collapsed. The teenager went to work in
New York, first as a bank clerk, then as a magazine editor. Her
favorite post was at the Metropolitan Museum, where she was
surrounded by friends--and "that vast and fascinating group of
everybodies called The Public."</TE>
<TE>   After many years, she finally saved enough money to travel to
France--just as her mother had done as a youth. In 1951, Cunningham
lived for a year with a French war widow. Amid the cobbled streets
and castle cellars, she was reborn: "That's when my English prose
arrived." She wrote a story about Andrew, a tenderhearted rat who
tangles with gangsters in Paris. That became 1961's "Dear Rat," which
one reviewer called a splendid spoof of the hard-boiled detective
tale. "Little did he know that the laughter and love within the book
were really a parade through my homesick self," she later wrote in
the memoir.</TE>
<TE>   Houghton Mifflin didn't know what to do with her work, so it
published her in the children's genre. "I was so fortunate," she
said. By 1959 she moved to Santa Barbara, where she fell in with a
bohemian group.</TE>
<TE>   Playwright Don Freeman and his wife, artist Lydia Freeman, invited
her to their parties. Cunningham met Channing Peake, the gifted
muralist, and his wife, photographer Katy Peake; writer Clyde Bulla,
"one of the last gentlemen"; and William Saroyan, "who didn't care
much for women," she said. "It was a dazzling time."</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham was published steadily: "Burnish Me Bright" (1970) won
a New York Times Outstanding Book Award; "The Treasure Is the Rose"
(1973) was a finalist for the National Book Award; "Come to the Edge"
(1977) earned a Christopher Award. She supplemented her book
royalties by working at the Tecolote Book Shop in Santa Barbara
before it moved to its Montecito location.</TE>
<TE>   But in 1986 Cunningham opened an envelope from Pantheon. Her
longtime publisher was discontinuing its line of children's books,
including a dozen of her novels. "That just about killed me," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   For the next 15 years, Cunningham continued writing every day.
"Some people complain because they get interrupted when they write,"
she said. "But if you want to write,  ... do it." She produced
hundreds of poems and several books and sent out her manuscripts
regularly, like prayers.</TE>
<TE>   One of the publishers she sent submissions to, Greenwillow Books,
an imprint of HarperCollins, contacted her in 2000. "Do you have any
more poems?" publisher Virginia Duncan inquired. Cunningham
immediately sent nine joyful pieces about animals and spirit. "I
adored them," said Duncan, who published them all in the stunning
"Stable Rat."</TE>
<TE>   These days Cunningham sits in the twilight of life, marveling at
her career's renaissance. "Isn't it strange how I've ended up here?"</TE>
<TE>   Her question rings up to the shelves, where the fox, the rat and
other furry creatures squeal their silent hosannas.</TE>

<HD>Critics Aim to Bounce Dodge Ball Off the Schoolyard</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It sounds like a classic California story: Adults concerned about
self-esteem and unchecked competition legislate all the
rough-and-tumble out of childhood.</LD>
<LD>   In this case, there is a movement afoot to ban dodge ball, a
staple of the playground for generations. Dodge ball, it seems, is
bad. There are liability concerns, critics say, and the game provides
a poor cardiovascular workout. The real deal-breaker, though, is that
the game can hurt children's feelings, not to mention their teeth.</LD>
<LD>   But there's a twist. This isn't a California story at all.
California has been out-Californiaed by the East Coast. What began as
an outcry from a Connecticut educator resulted in recent years in a
handful of school districts in New York, Virginia, Maryland, Maine,
Ohio and Texas prohibiting the game on their campuses.</LD>
<TE>   School officials know of no California school district that has
officially banned the game. Most local districts, like Los Angeles
Unified School District, leave it up to individual schools whether
they let kids make human targets out of their classmates.</TE>
<TE>   The man taking aim at dodge ball--a.k.a. murder ball, killer ball,
bombardment--is Neil Williams, chairman of the physical education
department at Eastern Connecticut State University in Willimantic.
The professor, who has been called a "wuss" more than once over this
debate, admits that as a youth he was an excellent dodge ball player.
He loved the game, in which his arm strength and quickness often left
their mark on his less agile classmates.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until he became a physical education teacher years later
that he underwent a radical conversion. His moment of epiphany came
when he coaxed an overweight girl with John Lennon-style glasses and
a rosy complexion out of the back of the room to join in a dodge ball
game. Within minutes, a young boy slammed her in the face with the
red rubber ball.</TE>
<TE>   "He hit her so hard, it broke her nose. There was blood streaming
down her face," remembers Williams. "Most of the kids stood around
laughing. And I thought to myself, 'What am I doing setting up an
activity where this is not only possible, but predictable?'"</TE>
<TE>   Flash forward to the present and Williams has assembled a
formidable stockpile of arguments to eliminate schoolyard dodge ball.
Physical education shouldn't be about producing varsity athletes as
it has been for decades, says Williams, but should be about
encouraging students to find activities that promote fitness
throughout their lifetime. With this emphasis, simply on a practical
level, dodge ball fails the test.</TE>
<TE>   "As physical educators, we can do so much better for the students
than dodge ball. You don't need a bachelor's degree to teach that,"
says Williams. "Dodge ball is really the last refuge of a lazy
physical education teacher."</TE>
<TE>   On a human values level, the game drops the ball as well, Williams
says. Say what you want about the "fun" of the game, but everyone who
has ever played knows those who regard the game as an opportunity to
hurt people. At its base, the game encourages the strong to victimize
the weak, he says, not exactly a practice schools should be
fostering.</TE>
<TE>   "Schools preach the value of harmony, community and cooperation,"
says Williams, who half-jokingly placed dodge ball, musical chairs
and duck, duck, goose in something he calls the Physical Education
Hall of Shame. "But then those same schools let the big kids loose to
see if they can hit the skinny nerd in the head with a hard, red
rubber ball."</TE>
<TE>   But defenders of the game say that's precisely why the game
shouldn't be banned, but trumpeted. Getting picked on and eliminated
from competition, that's life. Dodge ball teaches lessons about how
to deal with winning or losing. Let's not overprotect our children,
who are tougher and more resilient than educators think. Dodge ball
is no more harmful to a child's psyche than a snowball or
water-balloon fight, contend defenders.</TE>
<TE>   Some parents "want their Ambers and their Alexanders to grow up in
a cozy womb of noncompetition, where everybody shares tofu, and
Little Red Riding Hood and the big, bad wolf set up a commune," wrote
Rick Reilly, a columnist for Sports Illustrated. "Then their kids
will stumble out into the bright light of the real world and find out
that, yes, there's weak and there's strong and teams and sides and
winning and losing."</TE>
<TE>   But Williams counters he has no problem with competition.</TE>
<TE>   "I can think of a million ways to instill the spirit of
competition into students that doesn't involve hurtling an object at
someone's head," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Dodge ball has many variations; while, to be considered genuine,
it must feature a human target, rules can be changed to protect the
innocent. At Ivanhoe Elementary School in Los Angeles, for example,
students are forbidden from hitting other players in the head with
the ball. Further, if play is deemed too aggressive by adult
supervisors, either the individual student may be temporarily
suspended from playing the game or the game may be halted altogether,
says principal Mary Jane Collier.</TE>
<TE>   "On rare occasions we have to take an entire class out and say,
'Sorry, you're not getting it,'" said Collier.</TE>
<TE>   One Ivanhoe second-grader said he was taken out of a dodge ball
game a couple of months ago after pegging another student in the
chest with the ball. The student who was hit cried. "I felt bad,"
said the boy. When asked later what he liked about the game, the boy
said: "I like hitting people with the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Added his second-grade friend: "I like what he likes, but I like
dodging the ball too."</TE>
<TE>   Even as momentum grows to ban dodge ball for kids, adults are
picking up the game. Vanity Fair recently dubbed it an "in" sport.
The game has spawned a couple of short films--one a comedy, one a
drama--that have made the rounds at small film festivals in recent
years. And lately, a new reality-based television show called
"Ultimate Dodgeball" is being shopped around Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   The National Amateur Dodgeball Assn. was formed in 2000 in
Schaumburg, Ill. The city's parks and recreation department founded
the organization when it was looking for an event suitable for the
community and discovered dodge ball had no national sanctioning body.</TE>
<TE>   The organization, which heralds dodge ball as a splendid
cardiovascular workout and all-around good time, sponsors a number of
tournaments for fourth-graders to adults.</TE>
<TE>   The first year of the tournament, there were 33 teams; this year
the group is expecting more than 100, according to Bill DePue,
co-director of the association.</TE>
<TE>   "With proper supervision, the right equipment and age-appropriate
rules, dodge ball is a lot of fun," said DePue. "We want to see the
popularity of this game continue to increase."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation
raised $90,000 with its first celebrity dodge ball tournament, held
behind the back lot of Warner Bros. Studios. The cutthroat group from
the television show "Survivor"--featuring, among others, host Jeff
Probst and Ethan Zohn--took home the coveted first-place trophy.</TE>
<TE>   Like any true California story, the last words belong to the
celebrities. So here, a few takes on the controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Stone, co-creator of "South Park": "Of course they want to
ban it, it's fun.... Kids, especially boys, need to be able to get
out their aggression in a constructive, supervised atmosphere."</TE>
<TE>   David Spade, the fragile star of TV's "Just Shoot Me," decided not
to play after arriving. "I support the ban. It's rough when you're
young to get taken out of the game in front of the girls. When I was
walking here I heard the balls hitting the fence and it sounded like
the soundtrack to 'Apocalypse Now.'"</TE>
<TE>   Kip Madsen, a production assistant on "The Late Late Show With
Craig Kilborn": "The ban is a product of too many moms with too much
time on their hands. Even if you get hit in the face, it doesn't hurt
that much. It builds character."</TE>
<TE>   Zohn, the winner of the third "Survivor" crown: "I've heard of the
bans. I'm surprised there weren't protesters here when we arrived."</TE>

<HD>We, the Victims Too</HD>
<DH>Gunter Grass' new novel looks at a side of history mostly
ignored: German suffering during WWII.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>In a mere 216 pages, German author Gunter Grass has delivered a
blockbuster novel, shed a reputation for resting on 40-year-old
laurels, reconciled left and right factions long at odds over the
Nazi past and exposed a World War II tragedy virtually buried for
half a century.</LD>
<LD>   Like most explorations of Germany's 20th century history, "Im
Krebsgang" (Crabwalking), is more a political evolution than a
literary event.</LD>
<LD>   But even for its genre, the latest work by the Nobel laureate has
provoked an unexpectedly passionate outpouring about the need for
Germans to air their stories of suffering and victimization while
staying mindful of the greater horrors they inflicted.</LD>
<TE>   The novel, which sold more than 300,000 copies in its first four
weeks, tells the harrowing story of the January 1945 sinking of the
Nazi cruise ship Wilhelm Gustloff.</TE>
<TE>   The vessel was packed with about 10,000 Germans, most women and
children fleeing the Red Army as it committed rapes and murders on
the eastern front in revenge for Nazi atrocities earlier in the war.
But the ship also carried German army recruits and wounded soldiers.
So it was judged a legitimate target and torpedoed by a Soviet
submarine whose commander was under threat of court-martial and
needed a dramatic score to save his stripes.</TE>
<TE>   As many as 9,000 Germans died in the icy Baltic Sea, half of them
children, whose frozen corpses Grass describes as having capsized
from the weight of their heads, leaving a carpet of bobbing life
preservers from which only tiny legs protruded.</TE>
<TE>   The last voyage of the Gustloff, for which there was no accurate
passenger list because of the desperate stampede to get on board, was
the deadliest disaster in the history of sea travel. The toll was six
times that of the Titanic. But it was neither the first nor the last
evacuation vessel to be sunk with staggering loss of life in the
chaotic closing months of the war as 15 million Germans living in
Eastern Europe were driven out or fled westward to the shrunken
German state.</TE>
<TE>   More than 2.5 million Germans died of exposure, hunger, exhaustion
and injuries inflicted as they trudged westward ahead of the Red
Army. For months after the Third Reich's fall in May 1945, surviving
exiles--like Grass' fictional heroine, Tulla Pokriefke--took shelter
in tar-paper shacks, surviving on roots, pigeons and insects until
the Allied-orchestrated recovery got underway.</TE>
<TE>   With the exception of a 1950s film on the Gustloff and a few
poor-selling memoirs by survivors of the westward exodus, the ordeal
endured by millions of Germans never made its way to public
consciousness until Grass' novel.</TE>
<TE>   "Society wasn't ready to deal with this subject until now," says
Erika Steinbach, head of the Assn. of Exiles, a powerful right-wing
political lobby with 2.5 million members that represents survivors of
the exodus.</TE>
<TE>   "The notion of Germans as victims has always been avoided for fear
of appearing revanchist, but it is very important for these events to
be brought into the public discussion," says Steinbach, a refugee
from the German-held city of Danzig, now the Polish port of Gdansk.
"The whole 20th century history of Europe was one of exile and
repression, from the Armenian massacres to Stalin's expulsion of the
Volga Germans to the ethnic cleansing of the Balkans."</TE>
<TE>   Steinbach praises Grass for returning to the themes that brought
him renown with the Danzig trilogy: "The Tin Drum" (1959), "Cat and
Mouse" (1961) and "Dog Years" (1963). When Grass won the 1999 Nobel
Prize for literature, critics grumbled that he hadn't produced
anything notable for years and had instead devoted himself to leftist
politics.</TE>
<TE>   He also was accused of turning his back on fellow exiles. Grass
was born in Danzig and joined his exiled family in West Germany after
internment in an Allied prison for serving the last months of the war
in Hitler's army.</TE>
<TE>   The defensive tendency to first step backward before moving
forward, crab-like, is the leitmotif of Grass' novel. The
narrator--divorced journalist and self-styled loser Paul
Pokriefke--tells the tale of the Gustloff tragedy through the
experiences of his mother, Tulla, and son, Konrad. Tulla gave birth
to Paul as she was being rescued from a lifeboat and the Gustloff was
disappearing into pitch-black waters. Konrad, infected by his
grandmother's oft-told story, seeks release and revenge in brooding
far-right Internet chat rooms and ends up jailed for killing a
cyberspace adversary.</TE>
<TE>   Deviating from a path that always skirted the plight of exiles,
Grass appears to concede in his new novel that ignoring German
suffering helped foster the resentment that has given rise to
neo-Nazi groups.</TE>
<TE>   Literary analysts agree.</TE>
<TE>   "Germans have for years avoided talking about the exiles or any
other aspects of wartime history in which they were the victims,"
says Harald Jaehner, literary critic for the daily newspaper Berliner
Zeitung and son of an exile. "Look at the bombing of Dresden [by U.S.
warplanes during World War II], which was really an assault on the
civilian population. It has gotten only scant attention over the
years despite the massive destruction and loss of life."</TE>
<TE>   Jaehner says he knew nothing of the Gustloff sinking until Grass'
book came his way for review ahead of last month's launch. But in
retrospect, he says he understands why the tragedy has been slow to
emerge.</TE>
<TE>   "The Gustloff was the embodiment of Nazi ambition and power," he
says of the ship launched in 1937 and named after a Nazi organizer
who was assassinated by a Jewish student. "It was designed to show
off the new German: fit, well cared-for and successful."</TE>
<TE>   State of the art at the time of its launch, which was attended by
Hitler, the Gustloff initially took about 1,500 passengers at a time
on five-day excursions to view the Norwegian fiords.</TE>
<TE>   The publication of "Crabwalking," which has drawn profuse and
uniform accolades from critics, has prompted broadcast documentaries
on the Gustloff and extensive interviews with survivors. An English
translation of "Crabwalking" is expected on the market late this
year.</TE>
<TE>   "When an old leftist like Grass shows he can rethink the positions
he has held for a lifetime, it encourages a broader social dialogue,"
Jaehner says. "We're now looking at the whole dysfunctional literary
approach we've had to the past, and I don't think this would have
happened if the book wasn't written by someone of Gunter Grass's
stature."</TE>
<TE>   Most of Grass' work since the Danzig trilogy has been dismissed by
critics, although his popularity carried even the widely panned 1995
work "Too Far Afield" beyond the 300,000 sales mark, albeit over
seven years. Germany's intellectual weekly Die Zeit denounced it as
"unreadable," and leading literary critic Marcel Reich-Ranicki tore
it in half on his monthly televised book program--an image that made
the cover of Der Spiegel magazine.</TE>
<TE>   This time Reich-Ranicki says he has been moved to tears by the
Gustloff story, and his effusive praise is likely a major catalyst
for the soaring book sales.</TE>
<TE>   "Bookstores are complaining they can't keep it on the shelves,"
said Claudia Glenewinkel, a spokeswoman for Grass' publisher, Steidl
Verlag. "To go from zero to runaway bestseller in so short a
time--this has never happened to us before."</TE>
<TE>   Tapping into the unexpectedly powerful resonance the book has had,
Steidl Verlag is taking part this month for the first time in the
annual Leipzig Book Fair. "Crabwalking" is mostly set in former East
Germany and may appeal even more to eastern readers who know little
about their wartime and early postwar history.</TE>
<TE>   As the opening passage of the novel, Grass asks on behalf of the
narrator: "Why only now?" He answers that question in the intricately
woven generational saga in portraying young Konrad's fate as the
price of covering up painful history.</TE>
<TE>   The reclusive, 74-year-old Grass has given few interviews since
the book's release, but he told the weekly Die Woche he considered
the exiles' tales to be "a heavy remnant" untouched by his previous
novels and one that needed to be confronted as Germany comes to grips
with its dark history.</TE>
<TE>   He describes the previous hesitation of German writers as fear of
appearing to diminish the wartime horrors perpetrated by their
nation. But now, he says, his countrymen have developed "the widely
practiced bad habit" of equating discussion of the subject with
detracting from the suffering of Holocaust victims.</TE>
<TE>   Says Die Zeit of Grass' conversion: "It is a surprise that borders
on a miracle."</TE>

<LD>What do you think life was like in Colonial America? Kids didn't
watch television or surf the Internet, because these technologies
weren't invented yet. But they did read books and play with toys.
There were other similarities to life today. Even 250 years ago, this
country was a place where people of different religious, ethnic and
cultural backgrounds came in search of freedom and opportunity, just
as they continue to do in 2002.</LD>
<LD>   One person who found opportunity in Colonial America was a Jewish
silversmith named Myer Myers. The objects he created tell us much
about how people in this new nation lived and what they valued. Take
a look at the image shown here and see what you can tell about it.</LD>
<LD>   * What do you think the object is made of?</LD>
<TE>   * What was it used for?</TE>
<TE>   * Who might have owned something like this in Colonial America?</TE>
<TE>   Did you guess that it is made of silver? It was probably used in a
home owned by well-to-do people. It is called a "dish ring" and was
placed on a dining table to hold a bowl containing hot food. Myers
made this dish ring for Samuel and Susannah Cornell. Their initials
are engraved in the heart.</TE>
<TE>   You can learn more about toys and games from Colonial America and
even create some of your own at "Yankee Doodle Makes Toys," a
workshop for children ages 4 and older at 2 p.m. Sunday at the
Skirball Cultural Center. A family tour of the exhibition "Myer
Myers: Jewish Silversmith in Colonial New York" follows the workshop.</TE>

<HD>Online Class Reunions: Lost Loves Are Found, Gumshoes Stick
Around</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Roberts loved getting e-mails from people in his distant past.
That's why he signed up for Classmates.com in the first place, to get
in touch with long-lost buddies from high school.</LD>
<LD>   But this e-mail exchange was different.</LD>
<LD>   It started with an innocuous enough question: After high school
graduation in Las Vegas, N.M., had Roberts spent time in Pueblo,
Colo., in 1969?</LD>
<TE>   Yes, he typed. Why?</TE>
<TE>   Sit down, the next e-mail warned him.</TE>
<TE>   And on the next line: I think you are my father.</TE>
<TE>   High-school-reunion Web sites --which, for a small fee, enable
users to get in touch with former classmates--have become much more
than places to plan the 20th anniversary of your graduation.</TE>
<TE>   As people flock to sign up, the reunion sites have grown into
giant databases on tens of millions of high school graduates in the
United States, available to anyone with a modem. Classmates.com, the
largest of such sites, has 28 million registered members. And
Reunions.com, which recently bought up two large sites,
Highschoolalumni.com and PlanetAlumni.com, has registered more than 7
million.</TE>
<TE>   Opportunities abound.</TE>
<TE>   A private investigator tracks down a suspect--then follows a whim
and finds the woman who will become his wife. Adopted children track
down birth parents. A 63-year-old widower reconnects with his lost
love.</TE>
<TE>   The sites' magnitude and many uses worry privacy specialists,
since people who post personal information often don't realize
they're opening themselves up to something beyond a conversation with
an old acquaintance.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the sites were originally created to help alumni find
scattered classmates and act as an information clearinghouse for
reunions.</TE>
<TE>   Generally, it's free to join and to give the sites information to
post about yourself so that old classmates can find you. You also can
view information about other classmates, which often includes such
tidbits as how many kids they have or what they do for a living.</TE>
<TE>   If you want to make contact via e-mail, the sites will forward
your message (they don't give out e-mail addresses) if you pay an
annual fee--$36 in Classmates.com's case, $14.95 at Reunions.com.</TE>
<TE>   And some users have realized that that may be a small price to pay
for a new way to search the past.</TE>
<TE>   Private eyes sometimes turn to the reunion services when
traditional methods fail, said Anne Fields, vice president of
investigative services for the California Assn. of Licensed
Investigators, though she thinks it's one of the less effective
tools. In one case, she said, an investigator needed to locate a
woman with a common name who had been a witness in a case going to
trial. The investigator went on a reunion site and began e-mailing
people with the woman's name.</TE>
<TE>   The witness replied.</TE>
<TE>   It's easy for people to be misled by such e-mails. For one thing,
they're posted as coming from the reunion site. As a result, the
recipients generally assume the sender is a not-very-memorable
classmate, and they might give out information they would never give
a bank or government agency.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Nunez, a fraud investigator for an insurance industry firm,
signed up for several sites for those very reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "You get a lot of good leads," he said. "Knowing where someone
came from is always a good start."</TE>
<TE>   During one of his forays onto the sites, for example, he was able
to reach a relative of someone he was searching for, and from there,
tracked the man down.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even Nunez, the hard-boiled investigator, was unable to resist
the siren song of high school romance.</TE>
<TE>   While he was on Classmates.com last year, a whim led the gumshoe
away from his cases and to the high school he attended in Fullerton
in the late '70s.</TE>
<TE>   One name jumped out at him. Robin Matthews. The proverbial girl
next door. He e-mailed her.</TE>
<TE>   She wrote back. She still lived in Fullerton; Nunez at that time
lived about 90 minutes away, in San Diego. The two arranged a lunch
date.</TE>
<TE>   "When she came out and I saw her ... I don't know how to put it.
It's like I'm 16 again," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nunez has since moved to Fullerton, and the couple plan to marry
this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Lighthearted though that story turned out to be, it makes privacy
experts shudder. Not everyone is as delighted to be found as Robin
Matthews.</TE>
<TE>   "The site gives private investigators and stalkers a real handle
on how to find you," said Beth Givens, director of the San
Diego-based Privacy Rights Clearinghouse. "People's enthusiasm blinds
them to the long-term privacy implications. You're giving quite a bit
of information about yourself and you might not realize that that may
be used sometime in the future for an unrelated purpose."</TE>
<TE>   Company officials counter that the sites actually go to great
lengths to protect privacy. It's up to users to decide how much
information they want to provide, and they can remove themselves
anytime they want. Nunez suggests a dose of Internet common sense: "I
would not put an address or a phone number. That's just plain
foolishness."</TE>
<TE>   But Givens said many people aren't as savvy as the investigator.
In a moment of excitement, they very well might list their home
address, thinking only old friends would see it.</TE>
<TE>   At Classmates.com's Seattle headquarters, company officials said
they initially were startled to hear of private investigators and
adopted children trolling through their site. And though they
expected love connections, they had no idea that so many lonely
hearts would find happiness in the arms and e-mail accounts of
long-ago crushes.</TE>
<TE>   Both Classmates.com and Reunions.com say they are in talks with
Hollywood about the possibilities of developing television shows
dramatizing the Internet love connections, using stories sent to the
sites by happy users who want to express gratitude or rave about a
love connection or a found friend. The sites often feature such
stories on their pages to lure more paying customers.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at both sites say they have the rights to the stories,
because all users sign off on those rights at the time they connect
to the service. Details of how profits would be apportioned from the
stories have yet to be worked out.</TE>
<TE>   On Classmates.com, Dan Daniels, a 63-year-old Oregon widower, told
the story of an e-mail that arrived one day, asking whether he had
once dated a girl named Bobbie back in the 1950s. When he sent an
affirmative reply, Roberta Gregory, also widowed, e-mailed back. A
month later she flew up from Southern California to see her old
boyfriend.</TE>
<TE>   When he saw her in Portland International Airport, Daniels said,
he felt the breath leave his body. At age 62, Bobbie Gregory still
looked fabulous. Since that visit, the two have gone on a cruise and
spent time admiring each other's grandchildren. (They have 28 between
them.) A wedding is planned.</TE>
<TE>   "I never expected it," Daniels said. "I thought I blew my chances
with her 45 years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Kirsten Miller and John Roberts told another kind of love story on
the Classmates.com site.</TE>
<TE>   Given up for adoption in 1970, Miller had always been curious
about her birth parents.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, she found her birth mother. But all the woman could tell
Kirsten about her father was that his name was John Roberts and that
he often sported a letterman's jacket from Las Vegas High School in
New Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   After a five-month relationship back in '69, the two had split
amicably. Soon after, Roberts left his job in Pueblo, Colo., with no
forwarding address.</TE>
<TE>   Kirsten's mother had no way to contact him when she discovered she
was pregnant.</TE>
<TE>   And finding him all these decades later seemed even more daunting;
John Roberts is a common name, and most databases offered thousands
of possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   In the spring of 2001, as Miller was poring through Classmates.com
looking for her own high school friends, she got the idea of
searching for her birth father through the site.</TE>
<TE>   She clicked on the page for the high schools in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   And there was the name John Roberts and a photograph. Was she
imagining it, or could she see a resemblance? Miller whipped out her
credit card and paid the membership fee so she could send him an
e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts in adoption searches wince at that kind of story.</TE>
<TE>   "I would never advise it," said Joe Soll, director of New
York-based Adoption Crossroads, which helps adoptees embark on
searches for their birth parents. Receiving e-mails over high school
sites is potentially alarming to birth parents, he said. What's more,
e-mail is easy to ignore; would an unanswered message mean a birth
parent is avoiding you, or just that your missive has gone off into
the ether of cyberspace?</TE>
<TE>   Yet stories of happy beginnings fuel the desire to try.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts remembers exactly how he and Miller connected. He was home
in Santa Fe, cooking bacon for a Mother's Day brunch for his family.
Like many users of alumni Web sites, he had developed a habit of
getting in touch with half-forgotten faces from the past, and midway
through the morning, he ducked into his home office to check his
e-mail. There was the note from Miller.</TE>
<TE>   He brushed the tears from his face and strode into the dining room
to tell his family.</TE>
<TE>   Father and daughter met a few months later. Another meeting is
planned for later this year.</TE>
<TE>   Classmates.com sent the pair free mugs and T-shirts.</TE>

<LD>Mrs. Chappelle left her class in Room 120 unexpectedly when she broke
her leg. She wouldn't be able to come back until next fall.</LD>
<LD>   The first substitute teacher they got to replace her didn't seem
to get along too well with kids. "Now you children just stay over on
your side of the room and I will stay on mine. I think you got some
sneeze on me!" she said. That substitute lasted only until the
afternoon when she ran into the hallway holding her nose and mouth.</LD>
<LD>   The next substitute teacher was a man. He was so busy reading a
book he kept in his briefcase he didn't notice what was going on in
the classroom. He lasted only two days until Mr. Dawkins, the
principal, caught Alfred Winters chasing Maria Lopez into the hallway
covering her face yelling, "Now you're getting sneeze on me!"</LD>
<TE>   The next day Principal Dawkins walked into Room 120 with a giant.
He said, "I brought Mr. Thomas in to wrestle with all the problems in
this classroom."</TE>
<TE>   Jerome Haskins whispered, "That's where I've seen him before.
That's Thomas the Giant. He's a star of the World Wrestling League!"</TE>
<TE>   "That's impossible," Maria said. "They wouldn't let a wrestler
teach second grade."</TE>
<TE>   "We're such a bad class, they'd figure that if we kept being bad,
a wrestler could just sit on us!" Alfred said.</TE>
<TE>   "Or he might get really angry and body slam us all into the
reading carpet," Jerome said.</TE>
<TE>   "Children!" Mr. Dawkins said as he clapped his hands together.
"You're not paying attention. Are you ready to--"</TE>
<TE>   "Wrestle?" Jerome asked.</TE>
<TE>   "No. Are you ready to meet your new teacher? Say hello to Mr.
Thomas." Then the principal stepped out of the room.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday: Is Mr. Thomas really a wrestler?</TE>
<TE>   Dolores Johnson's latest book, "We Play Music," was just released

<LD>A comet that apparently was last seen in 1661 will be at its
brightest during the next few weeks, astronomers say. Throughout the
Northern Hemisphere, comet Ikeya-Zhang is visible low in the Western
sky just after sunset. In early April, it will appear in the predawn
sky as it begins to loop past Earth on its return trip to the outer
reaches of the solar system.</LD>
<LD>   The comet is named for the two amateur astronomers who
independently spotted it Feb. 1. If it is, indeed, the 1661 comet, it
is returning after a 341-year orbit.</LD>

<HD>Mars Spacecraft Device Works Again</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An instrument carried by the Mars Odyssey spacecraft to measure
Martian radiation began gathering science data Wednesday, seven
months after it suddenly stopped communicating with flight
controllers, NASA said. Engineers who had been trouble-shooting the
problem since late February finally reestablished communication with
the device, which stopped working in August.</LD>
<LD>   The problem is believed to involve a memory error in the
instrument's on-board software, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
said. Roger Gibbs, the Odyssey project manager at JPL, said that
fixing communications with the instrument means that the spacecraft's
entire payload is now working.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: How does a frost-free freezer work?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Ice builds up in a freezer when water vapor in the air
condenses on the cooling coils and freezes. A frost-free freezer has
three components to enable it to melt the accumulated ice regularly:
a timer, a heating coil and a temperature sensor. About every six
hours, the timer turns on the heating coil, which melts any ice,
letting it evaporate. As the ice melts, the temperature starts to
rise and the sensor shuts the heater off.</LD>

<HD>Fooling Ourselves With the Help of Higher Authorities</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>K.C. Cole</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You can fool all of the people some of the time and some of the
people all of the time, but the easiest person to fool is yourself.
Especially when the products of your own wishful thinking are also
being peddled by higher authorities.</LD>
<LD>   So it struck me as particularly apt that I took a class of
students last week to the Museum of Jurassic Technology in Culver
City--while the Enron mirage was dissolving; while dubious claims for
the production of fusion energy graced the cover of the journal
Science; while Harvard biologist E.O. Wilson was in town trying to
turn people's attention to wholesale extinction of life; while
military planners were blithely bringing back nuclear weapons as
instruments of foreign policy.</LD>
<LD>   The struggle of science has always been somehow to get outside
ourselves, so we can see the world objectively. The struggle has
always been doomed. "We each live our mental life in a prison-house
from which there is no escape," wrote the British physicist James
Jeans. "It is our body; and its only communication with the outer
world is through our sense organs--eyes, ears, etc. These form
windows through which we can look out on to the outer world and
acquire knowledge of it."</LD>
<TE>   The windows are cloudy, of course, veiled by expectations,
distorted by frames of reference, disturbed by our very attempts to
look. Especially when we stand so close that we can't see through the
fog of our own hot breath, our own smudgy fingerprints.</TE>
<TE>   This is the sort of thinking bound to trail you like a wake out of
the Museum of Jurassic Technology. If you haven't been there, I'm not
going to recommend it. It will make you laugh, but it will also upset
you. It will leave you wondering if you just didn't get it, or if you
got it too well, or if someone was pulling your leg, or if you were
pulling your own. You will wonder what thoughts are yours, and which
are planted, and why we are so exceedingly well-wired to believe
official pronouncements--especially when they are obscure, pompous
and make us feel a little stupid.</TE>
<TE>   Probably just as artist/creator David Wilson intended.</TE>
<TE>   For example, this funky piece of performance art might bring to
mind--as it did for one of my students--Enron. How could so many
people, so many accountants and investors and regulators and business
journalists, believe so completely in so much thin air? At least in
part because the "authorities" convinced us it was OK to do so and,
worse, convinced each other.</TE>
<TE>   The mind creates reality as well as muddles it. That is how
placebos work. As a friend likes to say, far more insidious than an
emperor without clothes are clothes without an emperor. Authorities
should always be stripped.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists have thin patience for mere veneers, which is why many
physicists complained loudly last week when the prestigious journal
Science touted on its cover a breakthrough in tabletop fusion
technology--despite the widespread skepticism of the scientific
community, despite failure to duplicate the results. Not that there
was no there there. Just maybe there was. But tentative truths do not
deserve such royal window dressing. The authority of science (or
Science) is too powerful to toss around lightly.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, as Jeans pointed out, our view is always partly cloudy.
The closer we are, the harder it is to see. The greatest danger is
believing we can ever completely separate ourselves from our
surroundings.</TE>
<TE>   Consider, as Wilson does, the whole absurdity of talking about the
environment as if it were something apart from ourselves, a
special-interest lobby, remote and foreign, like "outer space" or
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly, we are the environment.</TE>
<TE>   As Wilson points out in "The Future of Life," when humanity passed
the 6-billion mark, "we had already exceeded by as much as a hundred
times the biomass of any large animal species that ever existed on
land." We consume and exhale stuff in such huge quantities that we
have already changed the air, the water, the continents. By the end
of this century, we may well have extinguished half the species of
plants and animals that ever lived.</TE>
<TE>   We take comfort in the thought that extinction happens only to
exotic creatures--big scary dinosaurs and tiny insignificant fish.
Not in our backyards. The truth is, we are in serious danger of
extinguishing almost everything, not excluding ourselves. And we
can't stop if we can't see. Self-referential systems are a bear. This
sentence is false. Or not.</TE>
<TE>   The authorities aren't helping. Instead, some authorities are
telling us that we should be ready to use nuclear weapons--which do
not merely destroy cities but vaporize them--to make the world safe
from terror.</TE>
<TE>   Somebody please get the Windex.</TE>

<HD>A Clearer Cosmic Picture</HD>
<DH>Radio Telescope in Mexico Will Be Able to See Galaxies So
Distant They Offer Glimpses of the Universe's Beginnings</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RAFAEL AGUIRRE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>CERRO LA NEGRA, Mexico</DL>
<LD>A new peak is rising from this snow-capped volcano--an immense,
fabricated cone of reinforced concrete that soon will support the
world's largest radio telescope, able to see back nearly to the
beginning of time.</LD>
<LD>   It has taken 14 years to conceive, design and build so far, and it
will be at least two more years before a 160-foot-diameter antenna
dish is installed. Then, not far from where Mexico's pre-Columbian
cultures emerged as leading astronomers, the telescope will start
collecting and analyzing radio waves from the most distant galaxies.</LD>
<LD>   The $88-million telescope, located 15,000 feet up on the summit of
the extinct Cerro La Negra volcano in Puebla state, is a joint effort
of Mexico and the United States.</LD>
<TE>   Both countries stand to benefit from this cross-border
cooperation: Mexico will gain critical scientific and technological
knowledge; the U.S. team will get bargain-priced, top-notch construc-
tion skills as well as one of the most pristine atmospheric settings
in the world, free of vapor and dust and ideal for capturing the most
distant electromagnetic waves.</TE>
<TE>   The participants include Mexico's National Institute of Astronomy,
Optics and Electronics, the University of Massachusetts and
government agencies such as the U.S. Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency.</TE>
<TE>   After six years of planning, construction started in 2000. The
original target date for completion was 2002, but several obstacles
have pushed back the date by two years.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason for our delay is mainly the enormous engineering
challenges that we have faced, which were startling and encouraging
at the same time," said Emmanuel Mendez, director of the project. For
one, he noted, the uneven soil forced scientists to drive special
pillars 60 feet down into the earth to create a sufficiently strong
foundation for the huge superstructure.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Analyzing Aspects of Early Galaxies</TE>
<TE>   The 46-foot-high concrete cone now visible on the mountain peak is
the "basement" that will support a 2,000-ton steel structure on which
the antenna dish will be assembled. The antenna will be able to move
on two axes, one parallel and one perpendicular to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   The telescope will help scientists analyze three main aspects of
early galaxies and solar systems: the molecular composition of dust
and gas clouds out of which galaxies are born; the dynamics in which
dust and clouds build stars, solar systems and galaxies; and how
galaxies evolve.</TE>
<TE>   The instrument will collect electromagnetic emissions with
wavelengths between 1 and 4 millimeters.</TE>
<TE>   Those wavelengths are important because they, in effect, pass
through the clouds of dust and gases that block radiation in the
visible part of the spectrum.</TE>
<TE>   In very distant and early galaxies, "a high amount of star
formation is obscured because of dust," said David Hughes, a
cosmologist at the National Institute of Astrophysics and Optics in
Puebla, Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "Optical observation can only suggest it, because you do not see
the optical light coming out from young hot stars," he added. "In the
millimeter telescopes, what you see is optical radiation absorbed by
dust and re-emitted at millimeter wavelengths."</TE>
<TE>   No other millimeter telescope in the world will enable observers
to reach such distant sites with such resolution. There are two other
major millimeter telescopes: the James Clerk Maxwell Submillimeter
Telescope in Hawaii, which has a 33-foot dish, and the 100-foot IRAM
in Spain's Sierra Nevada region. With its 160-foot dish, the Puebla
telescope should out-see both of them.</TE>
<TE>   The existing millimeter arrays "are sensitive enough to detect"
very distant galaxies, "but their resolution is not good enough to
actually pick up individual ones," said Richard Hughes, astronomer at
the University of Manchester in Britain. "To distinguish any more,
you have to have a bigger telescope that has more resolution so you
can actually see the individual objects."</TE>
<TE>   The galaxies the new telescope is designed to see are so far away
that the electromagnetic radiation reaching us has been traveling
almost from the beginning of the universe.</TE>
<TE>   "We will be looking at the universe at the earliest stage that it
is possible to observe, seeing it as if it were a baby," said Judy
Young, an astronomer at the University of Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Learning More About Our Solar System</TE>
<TE>   With its ability to observe distant processes of star formation,
the giant radio telescope will also be useful for studying the
history of our galaxy and solar system.</TE>
<TE>   "To understand how many stars with planets there are, and the
chance of finding other solar systems, we have to follow the whole
picture from gas and dust into planets," said Paul Goldsmith, an
astronomer at Cornell University who has been part of the project
since 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Achieving the extra resolution that will make such observations
possible is not just a matter of the Puebla telescope's greater size,
but also its advanced technology. For example, each of the 180
carbon-fiber reflecting panels that will form the telescope's dish
will be electronically operated to form a perfect parabolic shape.</TE>
<TE>   "Even with its nearly 2,000-square-meter area, the deviation
caused by wind will never be more than two-tenths of a millimeter,"
or the thickness of a piece of paper, said Alfonso Serrano, a Mexican
astronomer and chief scientist for the project. "This is an amazing
achievement, even given the low winds atop the hill."</TE>
<TE>   The machinery and instruments have been built on both sides of the
border, injecting new expertise into Mexico's technological arsenal
while allowing U.S. scientists to stretch their budgets.</TE>
<TE>   "Mexican low wages and excellent labor skills have made this
project possible. Building this telescope in Europe or the U.S. would
have been unaffordable," said Roberto Tepichi, chief engineer in
charge of the carbon-fiber panels.</TE>

<HD>Not a Single Exposure for Kodak</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Call it one of those Kodak moments ... or, to be accurate, one of
those Kodak un-moments.</LD>
<LD>   The Kodak Theatre in Hollywood will play host on Sunday to the
entertainment world's biggest awards show: the Academy Awards. But
when cameras zoom in on the stars making their way up the red carpet
into the theater along Hollywood Boulevard, the name "Kodak" won't be
in evidence.</LD>
<LD>   The Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences plans to cover up
the name and instead unfurl its own banner announcing the 74th annual
Academy Awards. The academy is making the move even though it
regularly mentions the Kodak Theatre in its press releases.</LD>
<TE>   So, why the cover-up?</TE>
<TE>   Academy spokesman John Pavlik explains that the decision actually
predates Kodak's arrival at the venue. When the academy was
negotiating with developers to stage its glitzy Oscar show in the
heart of Hollywood, it stipulated that it be allowed to string up its
own banner, just as it has done over the years at previous Oscar
venues such as the Los Angeles Music Center and the Shrine
Auditorium.</TE>
<TE>   "At the Shrine, as you walked up to the front door, all across the
front of the building last year it said '73rd Annual Academy
Awards,'" Pavlik said. "Kodak came into the picture long after it had
been determined that we would put our banner up [at the new site]."</TE>
<TE>   Pavlik explained that the academy has nothing against Kodak, but
was concerned that the theater might be named after a corporation
with which the academy wants no association.</TE>
<TE>   Like the Enron Theater?, Pavlik is asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," he said, laughing at the mention of the scandal-plagued
Texas energy company. "We wouldn't want the Oscar show coming from
the Enron Theater."</TE>

week are being watched by industry observers trying to gauge her
star's trajectory.</LD>
<LD>   "She has not done any headlining dates to speak of, so it's not
the most conservative thing to put her in theaters and large clubs at
this point," notes Gary Bongiovanni, editor in chief of Pollstar, a
concert industry trade publication. "Usually with an artist like
this, you would start off with small-club runs. We'll find out if she
can sell tickets on her own. There's always that intangible factor
where this might be somebody people like to hear on the radio but
it's hard to say whether they will want to pay for a ticket."</LD>
<TE>   Pink's sophomore album, "Missundaztood," is poised this week to
crack the 2-million mark in the U.S., and the disc has been a steady
presence for 16 weeks in the top 10 of SoundScan's weekly tallies of
the nation's bestsellers. Her sound, grounded in R&amp;B but with an
increasingly eclectic mix of other sounds, has also earned critical
success: Her hit "Get This Party Started" landed at No. 5 on a
Village Voice poll of the best singles of 2001 that surveyed more
than 600 music critics.</TE>
<TE>   Pink will be in Los Angeles later this month to film a video for a
new single, "Just Like a Pill." Videos have played a large part in
establishing her name in R&amp;B and pop, but the solo concert stage is a
new frontier for her. Mark Schimmel, senior vice president of
marketing and artist relations for Arista Records, Pink's label, said
the young singer is ready to prove herself.</TE>
<TE>   Pink's tour starts May 2 in Phoenix and closes on June 28 in Los
Angeles at the Wiltern Theatre. After that, she will return to the
touring life in support of Lenny Kravitz.</TE>

<LD>"Synergy" is an especially overused word in the entertainment
industry, and sometimes networks stretch it in unusual ways, trying
to make one plus one add up to three.</LD>
<LD>   So it is that the cable channel ABC Family will promote Sally
Field's new ABC series "The Court" by running a six-hour marathon
Sunday that consists of episodes from the actress' earlier series
"Gidget" and "The Flying Nun."</LD>
<LD>   Of course, once Field became a movie star, she spent a good deal
of time trying to create distance from those earlier TV roles. In
fact, Field's famous 1985 Oscar acceptance speech for "Places in the
Heart"--the one in which she enthused, "I can't deny the fact you
like me!"--was prefaced by saying that she "wanted more than anything
to have your respect."</LD>
<TE>   "The Court," which casts Field as a new Supreme Court justice, is
a far cry from those comedies. The drama will premiere March 26 and
is one of three new series ABC is introducing next week, determined
to capitalize on the promotional platform provided by Sunday's
telecast of the Academy Awards.</TE>
<TE>   Field's role as Sister Bertrille lasted from 1967 to 1970, while
"Gidget" ran for a single year, ending in 1966.</TE>

<HD>Moviegoers of All Ages Warm Up to 'Ice Age'</HD>

<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Ice Age" froze out the competition at movie theaters as the animated
film about prehistoric pals debuted with a whopping $47.9 million, a
record for a movie opening in March.</LD>
<LD>   Opening in second place was the video-game adaptation "Resident
Evil" with $18.2 million, while the Robert De Niro-Eddie Murphy buddy
comedy "Showtime" premiered at No. 3 with $15.4 million, according to
estimates Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Powered by "Ice Age," the overall weekend box office soared to
levels normally seen only in the busy summer or holiday seasons.</LD>
<TE>   The top 12 movies grossed $124.2 million, up 71% from the same
weekend a year ago and up nearly 50% from a week ago.</TE>
<TE>   "It's summer in March," said Paul Dergarabedian, president of
box-office tracker Exhibitor Relations.</TE>
<TE>   "Ice Age" had the third-best debut ever for an animated film,
behind "Monsters, Inc." at $62.6 million and "Toy Story 2" at $57.4
million. Last year's top animated film, "Shrek," grossed $42.4
million in its first weekend and went on to gross $267.7 million, the
No. 2 all-time animated film behind "The Lion King."</TE>
<TE>   The previous best March debut was for "Liar Liar" in 1997 with
$31.4 million. That number is more in line with what distributor 20th
Century Fox expected to take in with "Ice Age" over opening weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, it exceeded our expectations," said Tom Rothman, Fox
studio chairman. "It's a big number, and the key to that is simple:
We got everybody. The movie got adults and young teens as well as
families."</TE>
<TE>   While parents with children accounted for most of the crowds, 30%
of "Ice Age" moviegoers were nonfamily audiences, with a lot of
teenage boys, said Bruce Snyder, head of distribution for Fox.</TE>
<TE>   "Normally, those teens are a little too old, a little too hip for
an animated film, but this one looked clever to them. It didn't seem
childish," Snyder said.</TE>
<TE>   Set during a deep freeze 20,000 years ago, "Ice Age" features a
woolly mammoth voiced by Ray Romano, a sloth (John Leguizamo) and a
saber-toothed tiger (Denis Leary) who form an unlikely band returning
a human baby to its tribe.</TE>

<HD>'Knight Life' Jousts With Medieval History</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHILIP BRANDES</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Getting killed in battle and having your spouse chosen for you
notwithstanding, life in the 12th century had its perks, as we
quickly discover when a tuneful trio of shapely "wenches who visit
the trenches" regale an armored army with a bluesy opening
lyric--fronted by a well-endowed singer who campily identifies
herself as "Maiden Form."</LD>
<LD>   Groaners like these prove the pun is mightier than the sword as
"Knight Life" at the Granada Theatre in Santa Barbara shows us a
kinder, goofier side of the Middle Ages. In the course of an
unapologetically lowbrow evening, this new musical from the Music
Theatre of Santa Barbara gleefully rewrites history, infusing the era
of jousts, crusades and courtly intrigue with women's liberation,
fast-food logos and even the birth of rock 'n' roll.</LD>
<LD>   It sounded like a good idea on parchment, and there is a wealth of
comic potential here. But in its present form this sprawling,
unwieldy octopus of a show is a far cry from the Broadway-style
musicals it seeks to emulate.</LD>
<TE>   In adapting "Knight Life's" book and lyrics from a project
originally conceived as a TV sitcom, Robert Sternin and Prudence
Fraser (who created "The Nanny") recall the whimsical irreverence of
historical parodies such as "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" and Mel
Brooks' "Robin Hood: Men in Tights." To realize their vision, they
enlisted talent with impeccable credentials, including pop songwriter
Jeff Barry to write the music, and veteran stage director Michael
Michetti, who helped them reshape a season's worth of story lines
into a promising first effort.</TE>
<TE>   The story revolves around the very progressive Princess Katherine
(Kirsten Benton), who would rather be a soldier than a demure maiden.
Benton's strong singing puts real passion into Katherine's chaffing
at the chauvinistic shackles of chivalry. In the best fairy tale
tradition, Katherine falls in love with a peasant, William of the
Field (Paul J. Green), and is not about to let class differences
stand in their way (only the prospect of becoming "Mrs. Fields" gives
her pause).</TE>
<TE>   Opposing their union is Katherine's stepmother, the gold-digging
Queen Cecile (Rende Rae Norman) who fears for her own position as her
husband's deteriorating health forces him to spend "more and more
time in the little king's room." Norman's brassy torch number about
the hazards of being "Middle Aged in the Middle Ages" proves one of
the few songs that come across as a fully realized show tune in a
score that relies on sparse staccato rhythms to punctuate.</TE>
<TE>   To secure power, Cecile plots to marry Katherine to her foppish,
equally unscrupulous nephew Geoffrey (camped to the hilt by Chad
Borden). They conspire to get William out of the way with a
trumped-up claim that he's already been betrothed by his dead father.</TE>
<TE>   After a big show about honoring his commitments, William promptly
ducks out on his bride-to-be by embarking on a crusade to avoid going
through with the arranged marriage, which doesn't do much to enlist
sympathy for an already paper-thin character.</TE>
<TE>   Even more muddled is the way Katherine becomes completely passive
despite her carefully established independent spirit. She has nothing
to do with the eventual resolution of a second-act threat from a
menacing leather-clad Dark Knight (an amusing Eric Martsolf)--that
comes through a left-field subplot involving Geoffrey's identical
twin lifted from Mark Twain's "The Prince and the Pauper."</TE>
<TE>   Lenny Wolpe provides a well-delivered punch line in the
unintentionally existential predicament of a Shakespearean-style
court jester trapped in a Three Stooges universe--how do you provide
comic relief from wall-to-wall comic relief?</TE>
<TE>   Lee Martino's tight, muscular choreography succeeds particularly
well in the opening number--a "Stomp"-inspired cacophony of knights
and their armor. And in the epilogue, a superb rocker spearheaded by
Rana Davis' Maiden Form, the entire ensemble cuts loose and achieves
what the show should have been all along. All that needs work is the
stuff in between.</TE>

<HD>Master Chorale Sings Salonen's Songs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL CARIAGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Wildly broad-ranging" is how Grant Gershon described his latest Los
Angeles Master Chorale program, in a pre-concert talk at the Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion on Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   And so it was. But not chaotic. This was an eclectic, balanced
musical agenda, in four languages, titled "Expressions of Love." And,
overall, it pleased thoroughly.</LD>
<LD>   Novelty characterized the program, without disorienting the
listener. The U.S. premiere of two strikingly sensuous choral love
songs by Esa-Pekka Salonen was the centerpiece, surrounded by
unfamiliar works by familiar composers. The mix became invigorating,
the evening short.</LD>
<TE>   Salonen's "Two Songs to Poems of Ann Jaderlund" capture the
listener through seductive tone-clusters, attractive melodic cells
and an unflagging sense of musical continuity.</TE>
<TE>   They were written during Salonen's yearlong sabbatical from the
Los Angeles Philharmonic for the 75th anniversary of the Swedish
Radio Choir.</TE>
<TE>   In the performance, Gershon switched the order of the two pieces
without informing the audience. But only those who tried to follow
the printed words may have been confused; the pleasures here were in
hearing the compelling sounds of the singing, not in monitoring the
Swedish text. At the end, conductor Gershon shared bows with the
composer, the popular L.A. Philharmonic music director.</TE>
<TE>   Seldom-heard music by Lili Boulanger, "Les Sirenes" and
"Renouveau," and Francis Poulenc, his "Eight French Songs" from
1945-46, provided a contrast of styles with unfamiliar part songs in
German by Schubert (for men) and Schumann (for women). Lightness and
buoyancy marked all the performances, introduced genially by
Gershon's witty comments.</TE>
<TE>   The singing, often admirable for purity of tone and clear
enunciation, was not consistently polished, however. And balances
between sections could be haphazard. Here were effective performances
sometimes lacking the full, handsome sound usually associated with
this ensemble.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the evening, Gershon appropriately shared his bows with
Vicki Ray, the chorale's resourceful, sensitive and virtuosic
pianist.</TE>

<HD>Teka Blends Guitar Skills With Her Velvety Vocals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brazilian singer-guitarist Teka spends most of her time in the Santa
Barbara area, making occasional forays into Los Angeles every month
or so. When she does, the event is well worth seeking out--she is one
of Brazil's most appealing contributions to Southland music.</LD>
<LD>   In her Saturday night late set at Spazio in Sherman Oaks, she
displayed a range of talents that clearly stamped her as an artist
with potential reaching well beyond her local gigs. Start with the
fact that she is a fine guitarist with a velvety sounding voice, then
add an innate musicality that touched every aspect of her
performance.</LD>
<LD>   But what made Teka's work even more convincing was the manner in
which she joined her instrumental and vocal skills. Like Joao
Gilberto, she brought everything into a unified expression, combining
her vocal lines and rhythmic guitar accompaniments into a single,
elegantly buoyant musical blend.</LD>
<TE>   In the case of bossa nova era hits such as "Samba de Uma Nota So"
and "O Barquinho," Teka updated the familiar lines with brisk,
jazz-oriented backing from bassist Randy Tico, drummer Kevin Winard
and trumpeter-keyboardist Jeff Elliott. Her approach to jazz and
ballad classics was even more intriguing, investing them with the
ineffable spirit of Brazil. Toots Thielemans' jazz classic
"Bluesette," for example, was delivered over a simmering,
samba-tinged undercurrent of rhythm; the long, floating melody of
Kurt Weill's "Speak Low" became--in Teka's arching interpretation--a
tune that might easily have surfaced on the sunny beach at Ipanema.</TE>
<TE>   Tico's bass playing and Winard's drumming were particularly vital
supplements to Teka's singing, empathetically interacting with her
subtle shifts of emphasis. Elliott's role was somewhat more
enigmatic. Seated at the front of the stage, doing a one-man-band
stunt of simultaneously playing trumpet or flugelhorn with one hand
and a keyboard instrument with the other, his presence was a frequent
distraction. His first-rate brass instrument solos, had they been
offered as a less obtrusive, more supportive complement to Teka's
performance, would have made for a far more balanced musical
presentation.</TE>

<HD>Yorke Project Matches Mood to Movement</HD>

<AU>JENNIFER FISHER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the El Portal Center for the Arts in North Hollywood on Friday,
the Yorke Dance Project presented five works by three choreographers
who have in common experience performing with the Lewitzky Dance
Company. In various styles, they explored the relationship between
mood, movement and music in straightforward terms, sometimes
following narrative clues provided by lyrics, sometimes matching a
dancer's movements to an instrument's path.</LD>
<LD>   Looking strongest was "Tailored," a Baroque-inspired premiere by
Yolande Yorke-Edgell, the artistic director who founded the company
in 1997. Set to Alessandro Marcello's Concerto in D minor and full of
balletic lilt, it featured four barefoot women, dressed in costumes
that suggested 18th century formal wear. With careful buoyancy, they
seemed to be moving through still air, combining delicately placed
formal steps with the motif of one arm rising gently and settling
into a classical curve.</LD>
<TE>   Yorke-Edgell's other premiere, "Promesse," also aimed for a
musically inspired lyricism, but this time, the choreography seemed
overwhelmed by the score. Michael Mizeraney and Roger Gonzalez Hibner
kept stretching into shapes of some sort, but who could keep their
eyes from drifting to tenor Bruce Sledge and baritone Eli Villanueva,
guests from the Los Angeles Opera, singing exquisitely, swaying
slightly and filling every molecule of air with Bizet's famously
compelling duet from "The Pearl Fishers"? You could tell by the title
that no flow was intended in John Kennedy's "Di si nt e gr ate,"
which covered the familiarly fragmented ground of "postmodern cool"
(jittery gestures, menacing walks, abrupt transitions). Whereas Diana
MacNeil's "Once Each Time" existed within the holistic traditions of
historical modern dance, creating an emotional landscape with
sensuous curves, diagonal stretches and rapid rebounding. MacNeil's
ensemble ably negotiated scenes that embellished the haunting
score--musings on life and death by Samuel Barber in "Hermit Songs."</TE>

<HD>Serkin Juxtaposes Schoenberg and Beethoven</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD S. GINELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This season, Peter Serkin has been busy playing the complete solo
piano works of Arnold Schoenberg--which can be polished off in less
than an hour--in several American states. At the Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion Friday night, though, he chose to perform most, but not all,
of the canon, even though the remaining pieces would have taken only
about 10 more minutes to play.</LD>
<LD>   Serkin reportedly did so partly out of deference to Leonard Stein,
who played the whole cycle in Pasadena last November, and partly to
emphasize a direct juxtaposition of two massive figures who haunted
German music in their respective centuries, Schoenberg and Beethoven.</LD>
<LD>   Originally, Schoenberg was to have occupied the first half and
Beethoven the second. But by concert time, the order had been changed
so that atonal or 12-tone Schoenberg gave way to late-period
Beethoven in each half--a more balanced lineup that yielded at least
one startling conclusion.</LD>
<TE>   Serkin's view of Schoenberg's Three Piano Pieces, Opus 11, was
mellow, hazy, short on textural clarity and long on trance-like
stillness. He paced the second piece very broadly, much slower than
the composer's indicated timing, with its morbid repeating figure in
the bass almost melting away entirely.</TE>
<TE>   He applied the same deft, delicate conception to Schoenberg's
brittle Five Piano Pieces, Opus 23--which wafted distantly into the
hall even at fortissimo volume levels--and to Beethoven's Bagatelles,
Opus 126, where he emphasized the elevated, contemplative moods and
sanded away the mercurial tantrums of these marvelously quirky little
self-portraits.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, Serkin seemed to introduce a third figure into the
dialogue. He made both composers sound like Debussy.</TE>
<TE>   In the second half, Serkin expanded his palette, giving
Schoenberg's Suite for Piano, Opus 25, a more volatile, sharply
defined, even humorously paranoid character.</TE>
<TE>   But he reverted to his earlier meditative state in Beethoven's
Sonata No. 30, which shortchanged the Prestissimo movement, but
suited the profound closing variations just fine. It was as if
Beethoven were providing reassurance after Schoenberg's prickly takes
on Baroque dance forms.</TE>

<HD>Prince Diabate a Masterful Kora Player</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Guinean musician Prince Diabate has been described as the prince (as
in royalty, not the rock star) of the kora, as well as the Jimi
Hendrix of the instrument. In his performance at the Getty Center's
Harold M. Williams Auditorium on Saturday, the former description was
more applicable than the latter.</LD>
<LD>   The colorfully garbed instrumentalist and singer, a descendant of
a long line of Malinke djelis, is clearly a masterful kora player
with the capacity to extract an astonishing array of sounds and
melodies from his utterly unique instrument. The kora combines
elements of the harp and the lute, and in Diabate's hands it was
especially effective when he was using its multi-stringed sounds to
accompany his singing of spirited traditional songs.</LD>
<LD>   The Hendrix label was less apparent. True, Diabate had his kora
hooked up through some electronic amplification and sound control
devices that allowed him to create some wah-wah effects. It was
fascinating to hear the full range of the soft, acoustic sounds of
the kora via the amplification, but the electronic manipulation added
little more than superficial references to rock guitar
sounds--utterly unnecessary for Diabate's playing, which was powerful
and engaging on its own terms.</LD>
<TE>   There was, in addition, an extraordinary sense of celebration
about the performance, with the six musicians backing
Diabate--especially Famoro Diabate on the xylophone-like balafon and
Aziz Faye on percussion--providing a galvanizing musical surge, and
Rujeko Masango adding some wildly energetic dancing. By the time the
concert reached its spirited climax, the stage was filled with
audience members working out their own dance steps, and Diabate and
his players were surrounded by fluttering dollar bills offered, in
traditional African style, by appreciative listeners.</TE>

<DH>As fans bypass experimental acts for star sets, UCLA learns
a lesson at All Tomorrow's Parties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Given the creative emergence of rock in the '60s with the songwriting
genius of Bob Dylan and the artistic flowering of the Beatles,
universities and other high culture institutions have been shamefully
slow to recognize the music as an art form.</LD>
<LD>   There may be an occasional university class on Dylan's lyrics or
the sociology of Deadheads, but there is little of the examination or
celebration routinely awarded classical music and jazz.</LD>
<LD>   So the All Tomorrow's Parties festival, which brought more than 50
artists and more than 10,000 fans to the UCLA campus over the
weekend, was a landmark pop moment that raises enormous hopes for
future programs on the Westwood campus.</LD>
<TE>   Regarding the slowness of institutions to embrace modern pop,
David Sefton, director of UCLA Performing Arts and the guiding force
behind the weekend event, said before the start of Friday's program:
"It seems like it's only with a great deal of age that anything gets
picked up on. Rock 'n' roll, or as I call it, modern music, reflects
all sorts of sophisticated cross-cultural reference points, all of
which lends itself to serious artistic consideration. But very few
people will tangle with that world. I think it's a mixture of
ignorance and fear."</TE>
<TE>   Featuring artists chosen by the New York art-rock band Sonic
Youth, the festival demonstrated there was nothing to fear and much
to learn by exploring modern music--though there were some birth
pains. The programs, which ran from Thursday through Sunday, offered
more than 30 hours, and it was a learning experience for organizers
and fans.</TE>
<TE>   The first question is whether pop audiences here are as
adventurous as assumed by the organizers, including Barry Hogan, who
founded All Tomorrow's Parties two years ago in England.</TE>
<TE>   On the positive side of that question, fans turned out for a
program that offered performances by dozens of musicians, many of
them little known and linked only because they are admired by Sonic
Youth. The curators' tastes run from the visceral punk energy of the
Stooges to experimental sonic exercises that seek to find emotional
insights and truths in feedback and distortion rather than
traditional song/vocal structures.</TE>
<TE>   But the fans Friday showed little interest in many of the
festival's more experimental features. For the most part, they just
wanted to see the "stars," including a rare solo appearance by Pearl
Jam singer-songwriter Eddie Vedder, and a reunion of the seminal '70s
guitar band Television.</TE>
<TE>   The festival organizers apparently assumed that the fans, whose
tickets allowed them to move freely among the different venues, would
divide naturally. Half, they figured, would go to 1,800-seat Royce
Hall, where Vedder and Television performed and where seats were
unreserved, and the rest to the slightly larger Ackerman Grand
Ballroom, which was home to less familiar and more experimental acts
such as Bardo Pond and U.S. Maple.</TE>
<TE>   But the fans almost all headed for Royce, causing the human
equivalent of a freeway SigAlert outside the hall. With the room
packed, 1,000 or so fans at one point simply listened to Vedder's set
on speakers outside.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Television was ready to begin an hour later, there
were still 500 fans in line, and Sefton took the bold step of asking
the audience to make room for those outside by leaving their seats
and crowding into the area in front of the stage.</TE>
<TE>   The same imbalance occurred Saturday, only in reverse. This time
the crowd flocked to Ackerman, where the lineup, including techno
star Aphex Twin and heralded rockers Sleater-Kinney, was the prize.
Royce Hall, meanwhile, was less than one-third full early in the
evening, when the stage was turned over for long stretches to
musicians reflecting Sonic Youth's experimental tastes.</TE>
<TE>   Even Big Star, the wonderful '70s band whose music combines the
sweet innocence and harmonies of the Beach Boys and the sharpness of
the Kinks, and Wilco, one of the most respected of today's
alt-country outfits, couldn't lure fans away from Ackerman on
Saturday. There were hundreds of empty seats for both bands' sets.</TE>
<TE>   Still, All Tomorrow's Parties got a promising start, with some
memorable moments. Unfortunately for those who couldn't get in, one
of those involved Vedder.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to the emphasis on avant-garde electronic
instrumentation shown by so many of the acts, Vedder walked on stage
carrying only a ukulele, which he used (alternating occasionally with
guitar) to accompany himself on a couple of Pearl Jam tunes,
including the lively "Soon Forget" and a generous selection of mostly
tender and affecting new numbers.</TE>
<TE>   It was a warm and involving performance that also went against the
sort of "anti-personality" ethic of so many of the musicians who
appeared at the festival. Besides obliging when a fan asked him to
sing "Happy Birthday" to a friend, Vedder also closed his set with a
good-natured salute to one of his rock 'n' roll heroes, the Who.</TE>
<TE>   After placing his ukulele on the stage floor, he leaped into the
air, a la Pete Townshend, and then came down on top of the
instrument. He then handed the crushed ukulele to a fan in the front
row.</TE>
<TE>   Television later demonstrated why it is among the most respected
and inventive guitar-driven bands, with Tom Verlaine and Richard
Lloyd displaying a smart, fluid interaction that has influenced
hundreds of musicians, including U2's Edge. The set's momentum was
broken by constant guitar tuning, but the underlying brilliance of
the band was apparent.</TE>
<TE>   But Friday's most captivating moment may have been over at
Ackerman, where L.A.'s punk veteran Mike Watt, Dinosaur Jr. guitarist
J Mascis and former Stooges Ron and Scott Asheton put on a grand
tribute to the Stooges that included guest vocals by Vedder and Sonic
Youth's Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon on such songs as "No Fun" and
"I Wanna Be Your Dog."</TE>
<TE>   If more fans had seen that liberating blast of energy and emotion
(the room was only about half full), they might have been more
willing to sample Sonic Youth's more esoteric tastes by moving
between the more sedate Royce Hall setting and the more lively
Ackerman. Still, it's likely that fans were intrigued enough by some
artists to check them out in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Among likely candidates for more examination among the Royce
crowd: Cat Power, a singer whose almost painfully introverted manner
on stage added to the hauntingly personal nature of her music Friday,
and David Pajo, who performs under the name Papa M and mixed sweet
and melancholy elements in a richly moving and distinctive manner
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   While Sonic Youth's past ties to All Tomorrow's Parties made it a
natural choice to serve as guide the first time out, Sefton would
most likely have an easier job of getting fans to look below the
"star" level by asking some classic Southern California bands--such
as X, Los Lobos or the Blasters--to select the talent. Because of
their long-standing bonds with these bands, fans here might be more
willing to check out their recommendations. The opportunities are
immense.</TE>
<TE>   Best of all, it looks like we finally have, in Sefton, a patron
for rock 'n' roll in academia.</TE>

<LD>Today's topic is endangered species.</LD>

<LD>   The Hairy-nosed Wombats of the media.</LD>
<TE>   That's right, serious TV journalists who think of news as
something more than a cheap thrill or juicy sound bite. We take them
for granted until they're threatened with extinction.</TE>
<TE>   You know of Operation Anaconda II, ABC's campaign to squeeze
serious news from 11:30 p.m. and enthrone CBS late-night star David
Letterman in the time slot occupied by "Nightline" for 22 years
because his show makes even more money and has the younger audience
that advertisers most covet. You know that Letterman, after getting
his deal sweetened, has decided to stay at CBS, meaning "Nightline"
will presumably remain intact, with Ted Koppel as boss and primary
anchor, until ABC checks out the availability of Howard Stern.</TE>
<TE>   The original story broke while I was off doing something else, and
by now has been reported in laborious detail everywhere but on the
Food Channel and Qatar's Al Jazeera.</TE>
<TE>   So I was going to pass on it, until tuning in last week to a
segment of "TalkBack Live," CNN's daytime news chat,
audience-participation hour whose jagged lobotomy scar is glaringly
visible as it regresses daily from dumb to dumber. Watching it drove
home to me the wisdom of preserving "Nightline" in its present form
and Koppel as a force for serious journalism in a TV environment
where the "TalkBack Lives" appear to be prevailing.</TE>
<TE>   In a segment scrunched between discussions of Andrea Yates and
sluggers Tonya Harding and Paula Jones putting on the gloves,
"TalkBack Live" asked viewers: "What Drives War Correspondents?"</TE>
<TE>   It's always a good question, but especially now given what
happened to Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl (although he
was in Pakistan when targeted for murder) and Italian photojournalist
Raffaele Ciriello, who was killed last week while covering a clash
between Israeli troops and Palestinian gunmen in the West Bank city
of Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, "Nightline" tackled something similar the previous night
in a crackling good discussion preceded by a tape package on the
increasing peril reporters face in war zones. Said ABC's John Donvan
about Afghanistan: "In this war against terrorism, there is no safe
haven, no government to guarantee protection for journalists, no one
is an official guest."</TE>
<TE>   "TalkBack Live" weighed in the next day. It went briefly to CNN's
Ben Wedeman in Ramallah for an update and report on dangers to
journalists there before recently installed host Arthel Neville moved
on to Newsweek photo chief Sarah Harbutt and another guest with a
familiar face. Not a journalist who'd served abroad under fire, but
someone with even greater knowledge and expertise to impart.</TE>
<TE>   Actress Andie MacDowell.</TE>
<TE>   How is it that MacDowell knows so much about dangers to
journalists in combat situations? Well, she didn't memorize her lines
as the wife of one in the just-released movie "Harrison's Flowers"
for nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Recalling CNN's ardent promotion of a recent Monica Lewinsky
documentary on HBO (both are owned by AOL Time Warner), I immediately
suspected "Harrison's Flowers" of being produced by another of the
news network's corporate kin, Warner Bros. Why else, except for
self-serving reasons, would it grant the movie this free publicity
under the banner of serious analysis? Try stupidity.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, "Harrison's Flowers" is from Universal.</TE>
<TE>   Which means that instead of being unethical, CNN was being dense.
It means MacDowell was booked because someone at celebrity-minded CNN
actually believed she'd have something to contribute to this topic
beyond advertising the next day's opening of her movie.</TE>
<TE>   So roll that clip of "Harrison's Flowers," and let's hear from
Andie, whose husband on the big screen is an American photojournalist
who goes missing and is reported dead in Yugoslavia in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Neville: "Wow, some powerful scenes there." And later, after a
lengthy exchange with MacDowell: "Andie, you know what? I have got to
take a break for a news break right now, but I definitely want to
hear some more about this movie, because those scenes do look
amazing."</TE>
<TE>   A bit later, after Harbutt noted that 47 journalists had died in
the Balkans during this period, the still-amazed Neville made the
movie the basis for a question to her about combat journalists
possibly getting cold feet.</TE>
<TE>   Deep into the segment, she asked MacDowell if she thought her
movie provided "a pretty good look inside the life of the family of a
photojournalist who covers war-torn families."</TE>
<TE>   McDowell had to admit that it did.</TE>
<TE>   Just as television sometimes covers conflicts almost as cinematic
extravaganzas--giving them dramatic titles and intro music to set a
mood--this, too, was an example of news and entertainment being
juxtaposed misleadingly for the purpose of putting on a good show.
And if only it were an isolated case.</TE>
<TE>   Not that "Nightline" and Koppel don't go slumming themselves from
time to time. Or that everyone who winced at CBS wanting to bump it
for Letterman even regularly watches Koppel's show in an era when
knee-jerk talk radio and talk TV have the day's headlines pretty much
hashed over before the sun sets.</TE>
<TE>   But that is usually space-filling blather, whereas Koppel has
always been a master interviewer and even mid-range "Nightline" a
thoughtful alternative to ABC, a network whose commitment to news
under its Disney masters appears to be waning as it seeks ways to
recover from its overall ratings doldrums. And, as many are asking,
when do NBC and CBS follow?</TE>
<TE>   So carry on, Arthel Neville and others teeter-tottering up as the
other end crashes to the ground. As in Afghanistan, there is no safe
haven. Late-night comics are not an endangered species on TV, but
serious journalists appear to be.</TE>

<HD>It's a Jungle Out There for Serious News Shows</HD>
<DH>Television* Operating on survival instinct, the staff of
'Nightline' proposes format changes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>In an interview with The Times published days before the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, "Nightline" anchor Ted Koppel proclaimed himself a
realist. What he didn't realize at the time was that he might also be
prescient.</LD>
<LD>   "If nobody watches what we do, if the ratings dry up ... the
advertisers will go away, and it won't be long before the network
says, 'Sorry, Ted, we're going to put a comedy show in there,'"
Koppel said.</LD>
<LD>   ABC did indeed explore whether it could "put a comedy show in
there" with its unsuccessful bid for David Letterman. Now, however,
with Letterman remaining at CBS, all eyes are on "Nightline" as it
fights to retain its place--and justify its viability--in today's
crowded TV news marketplace, including a proposal that would expand
the series to an hour per night.</LD>
<TE>   While the journalistic community generally circled the wagons in
defense of "Nightline," some critics grumbled that the show has
slipped in recent years. The program initially thrived on a live
topic-of-the-day format, sometimes chosen just an hour or two before
air time. It took advantage of then-new technology, hooking up guests
from all over the globe, then subjecting them to Koppel's pointed
skills as an interviewer.</TE>
<TE>   More recently the show's sense of urgency has shifted toward
mini-documentaries and taped segments that offer more analysis than
verbal sparring with Koppel. In addition, the host reduced his
workload, regularly anchoring only three nights a week.</TE>
<TE>   "Nightline" executives declined to be interviewed, but they have
argued repeatedly that those changes were made to keep the show fresh
and to differentiate it from the pack at a time when TV offers more
news than ever.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, far from being marginalized by the competitive changes
that have occurred, the "Nightline" team envisions expanding its
presence, having presented ABC with a proposal late last year--before
the Letterman story erupted--to take over the half-hour occupied by
the troubled panel-discussion show "Politically Incorrect With Bill
Maher."</TE>
<TE>   Chris Matthews, host of MSNBC's "Hardball," is among those who
feel "Nightline" has lost its punch. Speaking at a cable industry
function last week, he said, "Koppel was great back in the old days
when he did, like, Gary Hart interviews." Letterman, Matthews said in
a side-swipe at Koppel's anchoring schedule, "is live every night....
He doesn't mail it in. He doesn't do it with somebody substituting
for him."</TE>
<TE>   "['Nightline'] is not irrelevant; it's allowed itself to become
nonrelevant," said Jeff Gralnick, a former ABC News executive who is
now a consultant. The mini-documentaries the show has been offering,
he noted, "are good, but they are just not what the audience that ABC
needs [to reach] wants."</TE>
<TE>   The criticisms have stung the "Nightline" team, because most of
the changes were made consciously to make the show stand apart from
the din of cable news and prepare for the future.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the impression some ABC executives have tried to foster
that Koppel works only three days a week, supporters say his schedule
is designed to let him work just as hard on other projects, reporting
and anchoring six weeklong series per year and two prime-time
specials.</TE>
<TE>   Koppel has used that time to examine the Clinton presidency,
America's drug problems, the vastly underreported war in the Congo
and a series on gay life that was postponed after Sept. 11 but will
air eventually. The show routinely looks at topics most other news
programs ignore, such as race relations or, two years ago, the
possibility of an anthrax attack.</TE>
<TE>   One longtime industry executive suggested that "Nightline" erred
by walking away from topical shows simply because the program can do
a better job covering a subject in a half-hour than a cable news
channel often does in four hours. After Sept. 11, "Nightline"
reverted to a newsier format, but the program's philosophy remains
that focusing on stories everyone else is covering comes at the
expense of more complex issues.</TE>
<TE>   Koppel's revised schedule, under a five-year contract signed in
December 2000, was also a deliberate attempt to cultivate a team that
could take the show well beyond his tenure. Chris Bury was made the
main substitute and the show expanded its credits to include
correspondents Bury, John Donvan, Michel Martin and Dave Marash. The
thought, executives said, was to make the show more of an ensemble,
similar to the crew on CBS' "60 Minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Money has been another issue where Koppel's team has tried to be
realistic. To pay for expensive trips such as the one to the Congo,
outside partners such as PBS' "Frontline" have been brought in.
"We're trying to demonstrate [to Disney] that people in the news
division get it" about the need to rein in costs, executive producer
Tom Bettag has said.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, "Nightline" approached ABC executives long before the
recent brouhaha regarding Letterman and proposed taking over the
money-losing half-hour occupied by "Politically Incorrect," which
follows "Nightline." Under the proposal, the first half-hour would
remain dedicated to serious news, while the second would be hosted by
Koppel and have a softer edge, focusing on more profiles, popular
culture and the arts, attempting to appeal to the younger viewers
watching TV at that hour.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the pitch to ABC was that the best programming to follow
news is news. Moreover, by using facilities already in place for
"Nightline," costs for the second half-hour would be lower than for a
show with a separate infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   Koppel has remained publicly silent other than writing a newspaper
commentary about the program's relevance and issuing a harshly worded
statement asking for a stronger commitment from Disney.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with CNN on Friday, Walt Disney Co. Chairman
Michael Eisner hinted that ABC executives were engaged in talks about
"what ['Nightline'] is going to be and how long it is going to be"
but didn't get more specific, saying only, "We would be disappointed
if [Koppel] were not at ABC."</TE>

<LD>Sex, thy middle name is River North Chicago Dance Company. Talk about
bodies in motion. This 13-member troupe gives new meaning to the word
exhibitionism. And what stuff was on display. Under the artistic
direction of Frank Chaves, the company ran riot in a nine-part
program of old and new works at Cal State L.A.'s Luckman Theater on
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Which isn't to say that all the choreography was as dynamic as the
dancers; it wasn't. But for a high-octane, pop culture
preen-and-parade-on-stage experience, this company packs a Britney
Spears-type punch, with jazz, modern, salsa and ballroom blending in
a commercial blur.</LD>
<LD>   Chaves' works, however, proved the least successful: "Love Will
Follow" (2001) saw six couples in Fred and Ginger mode, sans passion;
"The Two Sides of Tes--and Then Some" (2000) first had five men vying
for the delectable Molly Cofman, before stripping down to towels and
then briefs for an enigmatic all-male ballet that could have been
dubbed "Bathhouse." Notable for his fine form (and pierced nipple)
was Tony Peyla.</LD>
<TE>   Co-artistic director emeritus Sherry Zunker's "Vent" (1998)
provided heat, as Brittany Blumer and Cofman moved with slinky
aggression.</TE>
<TE>   "A Mi Manera" (2001), choreographed by Ginger Farley, Kevin Iega
Jeff and Zunker, showcased Shannon Elliott, Cofman and James Gregg's
whipping turns, while Ashley Roland's structured improvisation,
"Beat" (2001), gave Lara Tinari a chance to maniacally shine.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Ezralow's "Pulse" (2000), an exercise in lyrical
floor-sliding, was typical of the evening's slick, albeit
superficial, sensationalism.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>

<LD>The scene was decidedly festival-like inside UCLA's cavernous
Ackerman Grand Ballroom during Saturday's installment of the
eclectic-music celebration All Tomorrow's Parties. A guy randomly
handed out CDs of his material. Some people danced, while others lay
on the floor and vibed on noise rock, free jazz, hip-hop and
electronica. One group even briefly got a game of Hacky Sack going.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, as this third in the four-night event continued
exposing listeners to the sounds inside the collective head of
festival curators Sonic Youth, the lineup offered more in the way of
cacophony than sing-alongs.</LD>
<LD>   Still, hotly anticipated appearances by Japan's Boredoms and
techno veteran Aphex Twin underscored the event's forward-looking
sensibility.</LD>
<TE>   Certainly when the Velvet Underground (one of whose songs gave the
festival its name) first did its thing, few realized the impact it
eventually would have on mainstream and avant-garde music alike.
Considering how many mostly young people filled Ackerman, with more
waiting outside in a long line, it was possible to imagine a world in
which some of this music could become pop.</TE>
<TE>   Early on, Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore joined L.A. experimental
music fixture Nels Cline, along with percussionist William Winant and
reed player Mats Gustaffson, in a thunderously dissonant free-jazz
turn. (Also playing early was experimental rock act Bride of No No.)
Later, Chicago saxophonist Fred Anderson picked up the free-jazz
thread less discordantly with numbers that alternately expanded into
space and smoothly snapped back into a groove.</TE>
<TE>   Despite stances against commercialism in rap, hip-hoppers Madlib
and Cannibal Ox were more conventional than expected, complete with
the usual throw-your-hands-in-the-air/buy-the- album concert cliches.
Backed by a deejay, Harlem duo Cannibal Ox lamented materialism, but
their efforts to rev up the crowd seemed a bit half-hearted, although
the hall's acoustics often made them hard to understand. Later,
L.A.'s Madlib offered a more sonically dynamic turn, abetted by a
large supporting cast of rapper pals and the adeptly inventive deejay
Peanut Butter Wolf.</TE>
<TE>   The closest the nine-plus-hour program ever got to pop was punk
trio Sleater-Kinney. Its angular, emotionally raw tunes with feminist
messages were hardly mainstream, but the songs did have structure and
sometimes even hooks. Not so for Boredoms, but the Japanese quartet
did eschew its more violently noisy tendencies in favor of an
intriguing tribal-industrial drum-and-bass sound propelled by three
drummers and spiked with leader Yamatsuka Eye's keyboards and
occasional keening vocals.</TE>
<TE>   Not that you really needed hooks to reel in this crowd. Pretty
much a fragment of a beat was enough to get folks flailing about with
happy abandon. An astonishingly large number of people craned their
necks to watch Japanese ambient-noisemaker Merzbow concoct droning
soundscapes on his laptop and other equipment. And that rare set by
Aphex Twin? It mostly featured him capering onstage in a mask and
white robe to a recorded track. Which may be the future of music, but
... let's hope not.</TE>

<HD>Seeing the Southland as a Colorful Shangri-La</HD>
<DH>Art* 'Holiday' in Laguna, based on one of the largest
California Regional collections, shows the sunbathers, sailboats and
sunlight that painters delighted in portraying.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The sun-drenched scenes of azure skies, billowing sails and foamy
surf, painted during the 1930s and 1940s in California, recall a
golden era for art collector E. Gene Crain.</LD>
<LD>   "I've lived here in Southern California since 1942, and I love the
beauty and Shangri-La quality it used to have," Crain said. "These
artists taught me how to love the land."</LD>
<LD>   The first major exhibition showcasing paintings from his
collection opened Sunday at the Laguna Art Museum. "California
Holiday: The E. Gene Crain Collection" comprises 90 works.</LD>
<TE>   Crain, 68, began collecting in 1964 after he was introduced to
painter Rex Brandt. Through Brandt, he met other artists. The young
lawyer practiced in Corona del Mar. He soon began acquiring artwork,
at times exchanging legal advice for it. He eventually amassed one of
the largest private collections of California Regional art in the
United States--1,000 works on canvas and paper.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know one end of a brush from another," Crain said. The
walls of his law office and home are filled with hundreds of
paintings, hung from floor to ceiling. "The artists added a dimension
to my life that I would not have ever had. I bought their paintings,
initially, because I thought that was what would bring them closer to
me."</TE>
<TE>   Brandt, Phil Dike and Millard Sheets--the artists dominant in the
show--were key figures of the American Scene movement in Southern
California. They also were the ones with whom the collector kept the
closest, most-enduring ties; Crain gave his son the middle name
Brandt."His friendship with them meant more to him than their works,"
said Janet Blake, the museum's collections curator, who was also the
curator of Crain's personal collection for two decades. She and Susan
Anderson are co-curators of the new exhibition, which displays works
in oil, acrylic, gouache and mixed media.</TE>
<TE>   Watercolor was the most popular and most defining medium of
artists in the California School, including Barse Miller, Phil
Paradise, Joan Irving, Fletcher Martin and Milford Zornes. Light,
portable and quick to dry, the water-based paints allowed artists who
mastered special techniques to work outdoors.</TE>
<TE>   "Watercolor is a tricky medium, because it has certain demands and
a mystique quality," said Claremont resident Zornes, 94, one of the
few surviving artists of the movement. Two of his paintings, the 1935
"Moonlight and Horses" and the 1945 "Alcatraz," are in the show.</TE>
<TE>   "Painting watercolor on a humid or overcast day is different than
painting on a dry, hot day when you get crisp, hard edges," Zornes
said. "Cloudy days give you soft edges. It's like the paint has a
life of its own."</TE>
<TE>   The works are arranged by subject matter and include cityscapes,
rural settings and beach scenes.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of the works in the collection and exhibition relate to how
this part of the world is a great place to live, with sailboats,
sunlight, people playing--a quintessential California festive beach
scene," Blake said.</TE>
<TE>   The signature piece, "California Holiday," was painted by Dike in
1933 when he was 35. He captured a bird's-eye view of a bustling
cove, filled with tanned sunbathers amid sloping bluffs. In the
background, the viewer sees sailboats in Newport Harbor.</TE>
<TE>   Each painting triggers a memory for Crain.</TE>
<TE>   "Surfriders" is one of the few oil paintings Brandt completed
before he learned he was allergic to the medium, Crain recalled. The
1962 watercolor, "Yacht Race," was the first painting Crain bought.
The motif of the sun and ocean are central to Brandt's paintings,
Crain said. "Rex told me that when he grew up in Riverside, every
afternoon at a certain time, he could step outside and smell the sea
breeze coming through the canyons."</TE>
<TE>   Crain remembers how Dike was a well-versed poet on paper. But when
it came to giving his paintings titles, the artist couldn't find the
words. "Phil loved the interaction between the edge of the sea and
the land," Crain said, referring to Dike's blue and beige layers of
colors, representing the ebb and flow of the shoreline in a work
titled simply "Malibu Set # 4." "He always had a lot of trouble
naming his paintings," Crain said, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   Through Sheets' eyes, Crain saw beauty in both lush green and
parched brown countryside. "Paradise Cove" and "Abandoned" are
landscape paintings that seemingly "come alive" with animal-like
features, Crain explained. Sheets is known for his opaque,
acrylic-like use of watercolors, Blake said.</TE>
<TE>   One of Crain's favorite tales t is how he rummaged through a
community art sale at the former Pasadena Museum. The museum was
permanently closing its doors and wanted to sell some of its
collection. There on a table, priced at 25 cents, was Sheets' 1933
"Beer for Prosperity." Crain bought it.</TE>
<TE>   Crain treasured these artworks regardless of their price.</TE>
<TE>   "They painted as if Southern California was truly a paradise
island, sheltered from extreme heat and cold," Crain said. "And they,
themselves, were young, merry, vigorous with boundless energy--just
happy to be alive and active. It was reflected in their work."</TE>
<TE>   In their long, prolific careers, the painters saw their beloved
vistas change with the coming and passing of the war, the development
boom and the onset of smog and other pollutants. "There was a lot of
camaraderie. We envied one another, appreciated one another, inspired
one another and showed together, but that all changed after the war
came," Zornes said. The artists' styles also began to change as they
explored more abstract concepts and forms.</TE>
<TE>   Modernism played a role.</TE>
<TE>   "It had an impact on artists who painted in a representational
way. They no longer received favorable attention, except from their
loyal followers," Blake said.</TE>
<TE>   Crain never wavered in his dedication to his favorite artists.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to chronicle their careers from their first painting to
their last," he said. "It chronicles a time and place in history that
takes me back to what Southern California was like at the time, and
the scenes that inspired them to paint."</TE>

<HD>Little-Known Artists Get SXSW's Spotlight</HD>
<DH>Despite gloomy talk in the industry, acts such as Clinic
and Norah Jones make a case for the future.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS RIEMENSCHNEIDER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>AUSTIN, Texas</DL>
<LD>Though industry insiders spent each day of the 16th annual South by
Southwest Music Conference "crying doom and gloom," as keynote
speaker Robbie Robertson had predicted would happen, the thousand or
so bands that performed Wednesday through Sunday told a different,
happier story.</LD>
<LD>   Not since the early '90s, when SXSW was still largely an
indies-only convention, did so much attention get paid to bands about
which people know so little.</LD>
<LD>   The event's nighttime showcases of rock, hip-hop, blues, Latin and
country came off as cures, or at least treatments, for the daily
diagnoses of what's ailing the slumping record industry. Whatever is
wrong, SXSW--which originated as a showcase for new bands and evolved
into a schmoozathon that was used even by veteran acts to hype new
product--proved that it's not due to any lack of young, meaningful
talent.</LD>
<TE>   New names such as Norah Jones, Clinic, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs,
Starsailor and Tift Merritt grabbed a big chunk of the buzz, which
was no small feat considering that queen attention-grabber Courtney
Love also came to town.</TE>
<TE>   "The music industry is utterly failing," the singer said during a
panel discussion in which she dished dirt on top record-label
executives and defended her multimillion-dollar lawsuit against
Universal Music Group.</TE>
<TE>   Like keynote speaker Robertson, she did not perform in Austin, but
did go out to the clubs. Robertson was among the many who took in the
conference's undeniable It Girl, jazz-pop balladeer Jones. A
dark-haired beauty raised in the Dallas area, the singer-pianist was
stuck in an undersized venue above an Indian restaurant for her
sanctioned showcase. Demand was such that she played five other sets
throughout the conference at places including coffeehouses and record
shops, somehow creating a laid-back, comfortable vibe at each of them
with songs from her Blue Note debut, "Come Away With Me."</TE>
<TE>   Liverpool's Clinic (which plays the Troubadour in West Hollywood
on Tuesday) performed in surgical masks and scrubs, which was only a
distraction to their retro art-rock sound.</TE>
<TE>   Brooklyn's Yeah Yeah Yeahs were led by an outlandishly dressed
Karen O. Sporting and featured a lineup of guitar and drums but no
bass--only one reason their stomping, blues-punk sound earned
comparisons to current indie darlings the White Stripes.</TE>
<TE>   Along with many "the next Strokes" buzzes (New York's the Walkmen
seemed to come closest), there was also a sea of "next Radiohead"
entries. Starsailor (which comes to the El Rey Theatre in L.A. on
Tuesday) earned the nod mostly because they're British, but their
packed showcase at the Austin Music Hall showed more of a sweet,
dreamy take on Anglo pop.</TE>
<TE>   Equally radio-friendly but also a stellar live act was Merritt,
whose debut on the "O Brother"-blessed Lost Highway label is due out
in June. The North Carolina singer-guitarist came off as a Sheryl
Crow for the Americana music crowd.</TE>
<TE>   The conference was almost devoid of big-name performers, a sharp
contrast to past years when acts such as Johnny Cash, Tom Waits,
Patti Smith and the Black Crowes used SXSW to promote new albums.</TE>
<TE>   The most familiar acts--Jonny Lang, Neil Finn, Marcy Playground,
Luna, They Might Be Giants--all seemed to be ones that got lost in
the major record-label downsizing of recent years. Their prime-time
sets were pretty much ignored, like used cars parked at the front of
a dealer's lot.</TE>
<TE>   One mid-'90s holdover that did generate a buzz was L.A.'s Eels.
Led by bearded, shrouded frontman E, the sonically languid folk-pop
act opened its set with a truly freakish version of Missy Elliott's
"Get Ur Freak On" that stole the show, and perhaps the whole
conference.</TE>
<TE>   About 6,000 registered participants attended this year, down 15%
from 2001. That's the first decrease ever, and the business side of
SXSW maintained a glum atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   Panelists debated the reasons why record contracts and radio
airplay are all so terrible, the only general agreement being that
indeed they are terrible. Even Love joked about the serious tone
among the business types at the conference.</TE>
<TE>   "And I had always heard that SXSW was where you guys all came to
cheat on your husbands and wives," she quipped.</TE>

<HD>Marquez Sets Flamenco Sizzling</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Compania Espanola de Antonio Marquez arrived in Southern California
over the weekend trailing some of the strangest rave reviews ever
published about flamenco dancing.</LD>
<LD>   One Italian critic, for instance, called Marquez "the last
Narcissus," and another lamented that his dancing showed how
Spaniards, "our Latin-Mediterranean cousins," have kept "all of those
mythical sexual and sensual qualities of seduction that seem so
important to us and that we have partially lost."</LD>
<LD>   On the current tour, one American reviewer dubbed Marquez "the
Spanish counterpart of Irish American superstar Michael Flatley," and
another spent inordinate review space describing how Marquez's
trousers fit in the back.</LD>
<TE>   Everyone seemed to recognize that a true phenomenon had arrived,
and you could see why at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts
on Saturday. But whatever Marquez's new status as international sex
bomb may convey, it was a relief to find him sustaining the technical
and dramatic excellence he had displayed locally six years ago as a
guest artist with National Ballet of Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Whether fully dressed or with shirt ripped open, in showpiece
solos focused on percussive heel work or sexy duets with company
women, his fine proportions, sensitive musicality, wondrously
expressive hands and remarkable ability to put his full weight behind
every shift of position yielded performances of memorable power and
authority.</TE>
<TE>   Add to these qualities his full-out intensity--plus an ability to
communicate his feelings about what he's doing--and you have the star
presence that reviewers fall over themselves describing.</TE>
<TE>   Six musicians and 10 dancers joined Marquez in Cerritos, with
changes of lighting within a piece suggesting time passing and the
development of relationships even in choreography that otherwise
looked abstract. Marquez is a distinctively bold theater artist and,
following his lead, his company projected a forceful, passionate
style to the last balcony.</TE>
<TE>   In Jose Granero's "Reencuentros," recorded music by Emilio de
Diego launched a chain of male solos that evolved into an ensemble
statement before the women arrived for the first of many depictions
of blocked desire. Marquez's intimate duet with Leticia Calatayud,
for instance, propelled the rejected Trinidad Artiquez into a major
solo with castanets, and then one of the brief partnerships
dominating the rest of the piece.</TE>
<TE>   Marquez returned for a spirited trio with Calatayud and Dolores
Perez, but, as a whole, the choreography used traditional flamenco
technique to highlight the formal spatial divisions and sexual
politics of corps dancing.</TE>
<TE>   Far more experimental in its vocabulary, Javier La Torre's
"Movimiento Flamenco" used music by company guitarist Diego Franco,
putting the musicians at the back of the stage and beginning with the
familiar sight of flamenco dancers seated in a semicircle of chairs,
clapping along with solos performed in front of them.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, this traditional format morphed into inventive, unorthodox
uses of the chairs and the infusion of contemporary movement into the
flamenco language. Marquez's second solo, in particular, proved
surprisingly buoyant, with all the up-from-the-floor motion
representing a reversal of classic flamenco priorities. His dodgy,
spasmodic hip action, and a steamy duet with Artiquez that ended with
him on top of her on the floor, also violated norms.</TE>
<TE>   His "Zapateado" solo, however, demonstrated his mastery of the
intricate rhythmic patterns and meticulous variations in attack that
define flamenco artistry. Beginning and ending with taped orchestral
music by Sarasate, it reached its zenith in the unaccompanied central
section: complex cycles of accelerating tapping steps, ending with
air turns, a knee drop and a hand suddenly slammed onto the floor.</TE>
<TE>   In its generosity of scale and feeling as well as its outstanding
technical command, it was prime Marquez: star dancing that renews a
great cultural heritage.</TE>

California Center for the Arts, 340 N. Escondido Blvd., Escondido;

<HD>'Baby Bob' Blessed With Gift of Gab</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SACHS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tonight at 8:30, CBS is hoping that a 6-month-old chatterbox can do
for its Monday-night lineup what he couldn't quite pull off for a
fledgling Internet firm.</LD>
<LD>   The character "Baby Bob" earned major smiles awhile back as the
"talking" pitchbaby for Freeinternet.com, trading quips with Laker
star Shaquille O'Neal in a couple of particularly memorable spots. So
charming was the lad's digitally bestowed gift of gab that plans were
hatched to build a sitcom around the concept, even as the dot-com was
steadily sinking into bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   "Bob's" arrival in prime time turns out to be a happy event
indeed. Crisp writing in the amusing premiere by executive producer
Michael Saltzman and sure direction from Rob Schiller ease fears that
the series might rest on a gimmick alone. But as gimmicks go, this
one is a beauty, with cutting-edge effects that give Bob an
expressiveness some actors can only dream of.</LD>
<TE>   It also helps that "Baby Bob" is surrounded by a family of pros,
with Adam Arkin as Walter Miller, the boy's father; Joely Fisher as
mom Lizzy; Elliott Gould as Walter's dad, Sam; and Holland Taylor as
Lizzy's mother, Madeline.</TE>
<TE>   In tonight's episode, "First Words," Lizzy and Walter are
understandably floored upon discovering their pride and joy's way
with words. (Bob's 40-something voice is given just the right touch
of bent whimsy by Ken Campbell, who handled the same role in the
commercials.)</TE>
<TE>   And in time-honored sitcom tradition, the jittery Millers
immediately begin plotting how to prevent word from getting out about
their precocious child.</TE>
<TE>   The final scene shows just how difficult this will be. But what
may be an ongoing aggravation for the Millers should provide good fun
for viewers still mourning the end of the "Look Who's Talking"
franchise.</TE>

<HD>Voices of Innocence</HD>
<DH>In this year's Oscar-nominated documentaries, filmmakers
chronicle how conflict is viewed from the piercing perspectives of
children.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RACHEL USLAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A powerful epiphany has just overtaken Sanabel, the lively
Palestinian girl featured in the Oscar-nominated documentary
"Promises." She has discovered how to solve the Middle East violence
that has been her reality for as long as she's been alive.</LD>
<LD>   "Arabs and Jews should meet," she tells her friends at the
Deheishe refugee camp.</LD>
<LD>   "But Netanyahu ... " Araj interrupts, with the name of the
then-prime minister, a hard-line conservative.</LD>
<TE>   "Not politicians; I want children to meet," Sanabel explains. "No
Palestinian child ever tried to explain our situation to the Jews."
Sanabel is convinced. Araj, pessimistic. Both demonstrate why all
five of this year's documentaries nominated for an Academy Award
either focus on or memorably feature children.</TE>
<TE>   Whether uncensored or shy, pensive or programmed, children exhibit
both the resistance to and absorbance of the troubled times they've
inherited. And when seeking to personalize the complicated and
disturbing issues of our world, these nominated filmmakers have found
powerful sources in the often candid speech, or even just the face,
of a child.</TE>
<TE>   For Deborah Dickson, co-director of one of the nominees, "LaLee's
Kin: The Legacy of Cotton," the strong presence of children among the
documentaries does not come as a surprise.</TE>
<TE>   "Children are, by definition, innocent, so when bad things happen
to them, we feel it more acutely," Dickson says. "They should be able
to grow up in a normal way. And if they're robbed of that, whether
through poverty or war or bad parenting or racism, then you're
robbing them of who they really could be. Children are our hope for
the future, or they're not."</TE>
<TE>   Arnold Schwartzman, vice chairman of the academy's documentary
committee, sees the central role of children in the nominated
documentaries as a coincidental, but understandable, result of one of
the genre's central goals.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people really go for the documentaries that send strong
messages and will hopefully change the world for the better in some
respect," he says. "And I think if you want to change a situation,
you start with the young people."</TE>
<TE>   Illuminating an Underground Culture</TE>
<TE>   For countless children in Romania, any hope of change seems
distant at best. "Children Underground," the first feature film of
Edet Belzberg and winner of the Special Jury Prize at Sundance,
follows five orphans and runaways living in a subway station in
Bucharest--a city where an estimated 20,000 children live on the
streets.</TE>
<TE>   In telling their stories, the camera is unflinching, showing beds
made of cardboard, squabbles over the drug aurolac, an addictive
industrial paint that can be purchased over the counter, tears from
being beaten by aggressive passersby, and occasional visits from
social workers, who know the children by name and take them to a
shelter to be deloused, but can't do anything more.</TE>
<TE>   It's a downward spiral of a story, and Belzberg, who spent much of
1998 with the children, knew her film would present a viewing
challenge. But, she says, she owed it to them to shed light
underground.</TE>
<TE>   "The more I saw what they endured, the stronger my conviction grew
that people have to see what's happening here," she says. "I was very
clear about what I was doing and they wanted their story to be told.
They no longer wanted to be nameless, voiceless creatures. I think
instinctually they knew what was happening to them was wrong."</TE>
<TE>   For children growing up in the Mississippi Delta, a place where
cotton is still king and boys not yet in kindergarten know the word
"penitentiary," their instincts are up against a legacy that's been
"programmed for poverty," as co-director Susan Froemke says.</TE>
<TE>   In a trailer with no running water and a junkyard as a playground,
62-year-old LaLee Wallace is raising an ever-changing number of
grandchildren and great-grandchildren, depending on which of her 11
children are in a position to care for their own. Every day, without
fail, the resilient matriarch provides food, shelter and clothing,
even a little play time. In between, she preaches the value of
family, hard work and getting on the school bus each morning.</TE>
<TE>   Filmed by Sundance's 2001 cinematography winner Albert Maysles in
his direct and unobtrusive style, "LaLee's Kin" spends a great deal
of time lingering on the faces of the children, watching to see what
lessons they take in. For as often as LaLee and school superintendent
Reggie Barnes try to pass their wisdom along, they're still fighting
a lasting legacy. And though "LaLee's Kin" shows a future that's
certainly precarious, it's also a future with small but crucial hope.</TE>
<TE>   "Murder on a Sunday Morning" also examines a precarious future,
that of 15-year-old Brenton Butler, who walked out of his door one
morning to find himself charged with murder.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier that day--May 7, 2000--a female tourist had been killed
during an armed robbery at her Jacksonville, Fla., motel. Within 90
minutes, police spotted Butler in the area, and although he was
younger and smaller than the suspect had been described, they brought
him to the victim's husband, an eyewitness. The husband identified
Butler immediately, and with that, the investigation was done.</TE>
<TE>   Director Jean-Xavier de Lestrade and producer Denis Poncet had
been in Jacksonville researching the court system when a hearing for
Butler caught their attention.</TE>
<TE>   "The face of Brenton Butler was amazing to me. He seemed to be
lost. He was searching for his parents, who weren't there that day,"
De Lestrade says. "I didn't know at the time if he was innocent or
guilty [but] I really wanted to tell how he got there."</TE>
<TE>   To relay that story, De Lestrade films both inside and outside the
courtroom, contrasting images of detectives sweating on the witness
stand with those of public defenders Patrick McGuinness and Ann
Finnell tracking down the truth in their spare time.</TE>
<TE>   The inaccuracies they discover raise serious questions about the
thoroughness and tactics of law enforcement officials.</TE>
<TE>   But the filmmakers also never forget the film's emotional core. As
Butler sits in the courtroom, hearing himself called a liar and a
killer, the camera often lingers on his silent facade, allowing the
audience to imagine what emotions it's concealing.</TE>
<TE>   Putting Faces on Conflicts</TE>
<TE>   In his 25 years as a photojournalist for Time, Life, and several
other publications, James Nachtwey, the protagonist of "War
Photographer," has captured enough of the world's horrors to create
"his own library of suffering in his head," as one of his editors
says. A countless number of these images involve children crawling
over abandoned tanks or placing flowers on body bags with no parents
in sight.</TE>
<TE>   But Nachtwey never seeks out children to make a scene more
emotional, says the documentary's producer, director and editor,
Christian Frei. He seeks out the humanity and truth amid the horror,
and children are part of both.</TE>
<TE>   Frei, who followed Nachtwey for two years through Indonesia,
Kosovo and the West Bank, filmed the photographer at work as
unobtrusively as possible, with a miniature camera attached to
Nachtwey's camera and a one-man crew of cinematographer Peter
Indergand. "War Photographer" also uncovers how Nachtwey thinks, a
character study that's not only key to the film's central questions
about the media's role but also to Nachtwey's continued existence as
a photographer.</TE>
<TE>   "The worst thing is to feel that ... I am benefiting from someone
else's tragedy," Nachtwey explains. "It is something I have to reckon
with every day because I know that if I ever allow genuine compassion
to be overtaken by personal ambition, I will have sold my soul."</TE>
<TE>   Youngsters Don't Mince Words About Strife</TE>
<TE>   Not far from where Nachtwey was tear-gassed in the West Bank, a
group of children tosses a tire playfully down a hill, in an opening
scene from "Promises." A few scenes later, another tire rolls down
screen--this time, in flames.</TE>
<TE>   During the documentary, the audience gets an intimate view of
seven children--four Israelis and three Palestinians, all of whom
live in and around Jerusalem. Shot during a time of relative peace,
the film follows filmmaker B.Z. Goldberg as he visits the homes of
the children, all of them bright, articulate and full of personality.</TE>
<TE>   Although the oldest is 13, all have opinions about the conflict,
formed by what they've heard from their parents and what they see
every day.</TE>
<TE>   Co-director and producer Justine Shapiro said she was instantly
impressed by the first child they met, 8-year-old Moishe, and that
"even if they are parroting their elders, they're still saying things
on camera that elders never would."</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people challenged our decision to work with such young
kids. 'You're making a film on such a difficult, complex, tense
issue, how can you leave it in the hands of young kids?'" Shapiro
said.</TE>
<TE>   "But we just had ... to believe that if we were being blown away
by these kids, audiences would be too. I think a lot of people tend
to underestimate just how much children can teach us."</TE>

<HD>Andersen Lawyer Says Firm to Seek a Speedy Trial</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Attorney says the government indicted the
entire company for the deeds of 'a few misguided people.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Andersen's lawyer said Sunday that a speedy trial might
allow the accounting firm to stay in business, backing away from the
company's earlier claims that federal charges would be a "death
penalty" for the firm.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen said in a March 13 letter to the Justice Department that
the indictment over shredding documents related to audits of bankrupt
energy trader Enron Corp. was tantamount to a "death penalty on the
firm."</LD>
<LD>   "It was referred to as a death penalty because they were asking us
to plead guilty and a guilty plea would have been a serious problem
for the company," Stanley Brand, an Andersen lawyer from Brand &amp;
Frulla, said on ABC's "This Week." "Hopefully the company can get
this part of it behind them and go forward."</LD>
<TE>   The obstruction-of-justice charges filed last week accuse
Andersen, Enron's auditor for 16 years, of illegally shredding "tons"
of Enron-related documents. Andersen says senior management played no
role in the shredding and the company will plead not guilty in an
arraignment Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Brand said Houston lawyers for Andersen, the fifth-largest
accounting firm in the U.S., plan to ask prosecutors to complete the
trial in 60 to 80 days. He said the company continues to do its work
while it fights the charges.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the accounting firm's largest clients, including Sara Lee
Corp., Merck &amp; Co. and Costco Wholesale Corp., have dropped Andersen
as their auditor. Last week, the accounting firm was suspended from
doing business with the U.S. government.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment says the document shredding occurred in Portland,
Ore., London and Chicago, as well as in Houston, Enron's home. Enron,
which filed for bankruptcy protection Dec. 2, is accused by critics
of hiding losses in partnerships that ultimately unraveled, wiping
out $68 billion in the market value of its shares.</TE>
<TE>   The government says Andersen partners who worked on Enron's audit
began shredding documents in Houston on Oct. 23, after learning of a
Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into Enron's
accounting.</TE>
<TE>   In a five-page defense of its actions released Friday, Andersen
accused the government of misstating facts and alleging criminal
wrongdoing without basis.</TE>
<TE>   "It came as a great shock to us that the government would indict
an entire company--85,000 employees, in effect-- for something that a
few misguided people had done," Brand said.</TE>
<TE>   In its defense, Andersen said the shredding occurred before
Andersen received a subpoena. The firm also noted the government
didn't allege the involvement of Andersen management in Chicago.</TE>

<HD>Day of Decision for HP</HD>
<DH>Compaq, Employees Prepare for Change Regardless of Outcome</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>HOUSTON -- Workers at Compaq Computer Corp. fancy themselves as
belonging to the same breed of shoot-from-the-hip wildcatters who
built this Texas oil town.</LD>
<LD>   So it's no surprise to them that Compaq is regarded as the brash,
less refined partner in its proposed $22-billion marriage to
Hewlett-Packard Co., the blue-blooded technology company with an
impeccable Silicon Valley pedigree.</LD>
<LD>   What does surprise the 63,000 employees here and elsewhere is the
portrayal by merger opponents of Compaq as an outdated company that
would drag down HP's fortunes.</LD>
<TE>   That's not the Compaq they know.</TE>
<TE>   As HP struggles with a high-profile family feud between scion
Walter Hewlett and Chief Executive Carly Fiorina, Compaq employees
largely are forging ahead. Whichever way Tuesday's vote of HP
shareholders goes, Compaq's workers said they are ready.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a general can-do attitude around here," said Marius Haas,
a Compaq vice president in charge of e-commerce systems. "What will
happen tomorrow? It doesn't matter. Bring it on."</TE>
<TE>   Some workers already have taken second jobs in case the merger
goes through and their units are shut down. Others are bracing for
the restructuring that inevitably will occur if the union falls apart
and Compaq remains a separate company.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people have something lined up, just in case," said Mike
Waybourn, who works in Compaq's manufacturing plant and has a second
job in construction. "That way, if we get laid off, we'll have
something to fall back on."</TE>
<TE>   Compaq executives make no secret of their plans to further reduce
costs, regardless of Tuesday's vote.</TE>
<TE>   "All of us are going to continue to have to become more
efficient," Compaq Chief Executive Michael Capellas said. "The whole
industry is going to have to go through another phase of realigning
their cost structure. I think we got out ahead of it, but I don't
think anybody's done. That's just the nature of what we've got ahead
of us."</TE>
<TE>   Turmoil and change are nothing new for the 20-year-old computer
company founded in a downtown Houston pie shop. In the last few
years, Compaq has undergone two mergers and then faced the worst
downturn in the brief history of the computer industry. It laid off
9,500 workers and emerged from a brutal price war with a $785-million
loss in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Each experience taught the company lessons, executives and
rank-and-file workers said.</TE>
<TE>   "Compaq is about change," said Audrey Dozier-Piazza, who has been
at Compaq 16 years. "I'm on my third CEO, my 12th office. Everything
just continues to get better each time. While I believe in the
merger, I believe more in Compaq."</TE>
<TE>   Its mergers with Tandem Computers and Digital Equipment Corp., for
instance, resulted in deep culture clashes when units were
integrated. As a result, Compaq and HP already have evaluated which
overlapping divisions are the strongest between the two companies.
The weaker ones will be axed immediately and their employees laid
off--eliminating the messiness of marrying two cultures.</TE>
<TE>   "We learned that you've got to integrate faster," said Michael
Winkler, executive vice president of global business units for
Compaq. "You have to have a clear product road map on Day 1. We
didn't do that with Digital. We didn't take action on reducing the
head count early enough."</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of whether the company merges with HP, Compaq
executives and workers know they have to do a lot more than cut staff
to compete in a tight market against the likes of Dell Computer Corp.
and IBM Corp.</TE>
<TE>   About 40% of Compaq's $34-billion annual revenue comes from PC
sales. But because the PC market has deteriorated into a low-profit,
low-growth business, Compaq has ventured into greener pastures,
including servers, storage machines and services.</TE>
<TE>   The company boasts a 30% share and the No. 1 position in servers
that cost less than $25,000, according to figures by market
researcher IDC. Last year, it toppled EMC Corp. as the largest
supplier of storage devices. And it rang up $7.8 billion in revenue
from services last year, up 4% from 2000, despite double-digit drops
in the PC and storage markets.</TE>
<TE>   Although these are the markets where Compaq likes to highlight its
achievements, it is still saddled with a money-losing PC business
that accounted for $587 million in red ink last year. Like it or not,
Compaq cannot afford to ditch PCs. Customers that buy servers and
other higher-margin products from Compaq often start by ordering PCs
and work their way up. So when Compaq lost its No. 1 position in the
PC business to Dell last year, the blow was hard felt.</TE>
<TE>   "Compaq's heritage is as a PC company," said Martin Reynolds, an
analyst with Gartner Inc., a technology consulting firm based in
Stamford, Conn. "This is not a component of their business that they
can walk away from. They have to fix it. If they don't, a good chunk
of their services business--the part that fixes and maintains the
PCs--will fall. They'll be chased into a niche."</TE>
<TE>   Capellas said the PC market can be lucrative once it includes
gadgets that connect to the Internet such as the iPaq, Compaq's
hand-held computer.</TE>
<TE>   "If you view the business as a simple PC beige-box business, then
it's a pretty stable business," Capellas said. "If you view it as ...
next-generation devices being the reception points of new forms of
data with new forms of audio streaming and video streaming, then it's
actually a business that will have at least one more wave and
probably more."</TE>
<TE>   Compaq workers take pride in the company's ability to react
quickly--from painful actions such as shutting down plants to buying
companies that it thinks will help it reach new customers. But for
employees like Antonio Humphreys, who has worked in the company's PC
unit for two years, it's that fast pace that drew them to Compaq in
the first place.</TE>
<TE>   "My wife and I both work here," Humphreys said. "Do we think about
what would happen if we were to be laid off? Sure. It's one of the
major topics of discussion. But once we get to work, we've got a job
to do, and we do it.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to work at Shell Oil, and I wanted to work in a much more
proactive culture. Oil and gas is stodgy and slow-paced.... This is
fast-paced. It's like being on a bullet train after you've been on an
oil tanker."</TE>

system but said the backup system had been implemented and all its
customers now have access to their funds.</LD>
<LD>   Bank of America said Saturday that 1.1 million direct deposit

<HD>Merger Between Aloha, Hawaiian Called Off</HD>
<DH>Airlines: Proposed deal would have given the combined
carrier control of most flights among the state's islands.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HONOLULU</DL>
<LD>The planned merger of Hawaiian Airlines Inc. and Aloha Airlines,
which generated widespread opposition from employees, stockholders
and consumers, has been called off, a Hawaiian spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   "It's clear that the parties will not be able to satisfy the
conditions of the merger agreement," Hawaiian spokesman Keoni Wagner
said late Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Aloha and Hawaii unveiled the proposed merger in December, saying
it was necessary for the financial health of both companies. A
deadline of April 18 had been set for its completion.</LD>
<TE>   Those opposed to the merger of the state's only two interisland
air carriers said it would lead to higher prices and poorer service.</TE>
<TE>   Class-action lawsuits seeking to block the merger were filed in
state court on behalf of several groups, including employees and
shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, Hawaii's three Republican state senators asked the
Justice Department to block the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Hawaiian Chairman John W. Adams announced earlier Saturday that
the airline rejected a deadline extension requested by TurnWorks
Inc., a Texas-based company working to merge the two carriers.</TE>
<TE>   In response to the announcement, Aloha spokesman Stu Glauberman
said, "Aloha is aware of the decision by Hawaiian Airlines, and will
issue comments at the appropriate time."</TE>
<TE>   "TurnWorks is extremely disappointed," the company said through a
public relations firm in Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   The merger was to create a new company, Aloha Holdings Inc., to be
headed by Greg Brenneman, TurnWorks' chairman and chief executive. He
helped lead Continental Airlines Inc. to its turnaround as its
president and chief operating officer.</TE>
<TE>   Hawaiian Airlines, which has a market value of $141.7 million and
is the larger carrier, and the closely held parent of Aloha had said
they need to combine because the global economic slowdown and the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks hurt demand for travel to Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   The merger would have given the combined carrier control of most
flights among the state's islands.</TE>
<TE>   Under the terms of the proposed combination, the new company,
Aloha Holdings Inc., would have been 52% owned by Hawaiian Air's
shareholders and 28% owned by Aloha Air Group Inc. shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining 20% would have been held by Brenneman.</TE>
<TE>   Hawaiian Air, which put itself up for sale in May 2000, offers
about 140 daily flights, employs 3,100 workers and operates 29
aircraft. Aloha Air Group, which also is the parent to Island Air,
operates about 180 daily flights, with about 3,000 employees and 23
aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 27 routes the carriers fly, their service overlaps on 13
within the Hawaiian islands.</TE>
<TE>   To address regulatory concerns, the companies had said the new
Aloha Holdings would limit some fare increases.</TE>

<LD>One of the most intensely fought proxy battles in years will come to
an end Tuesday in a college auditorium in Cupertino, Calif., when the
last Hewlett-Packard Co. shareholders will vote on HP's planned
$22-billion acquisition of Compaq Computer Corp.</LD>
<LD>   As many as 2,000 investors are expected at the special meeting to
witness the final fireworks between HP Chairwoman and Chief Executive
Carly Fiorina and founder's heir Walter Hewlett, the HP director who
is leading the multimillion-dollar war of mailings, newspaper ads and
telephone solicitations against the merger.</LD>
<LD>   Over the last three months, 900,000 HP investors have been
bombarded with arguments, expert endorsements and personal attacks
from each side, and Tuesday will be their last day to decide between
the vision of Fiorina and that of Hewlett.</LD>
<TE>   But what they decide may not be known for weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Fiorina, the first outsider picked to lead the storied but
slow-moving Silicon Valley stalwart, will gavel the meeting and make
her closing argument to the audience, stressing that Compaq will give
HP a commanding position in many markets for technology hardware and
the scale to compete with the likes of IBM Corp. in consulting and
other services.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally at such meetings, the opposition is given a shorter
time to make its case, but HP and Hewlett still were negotiating
logistics over the weekend. "It's their show," said Hewlett spokesman
Todd Glass.</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett and more than a dozen of his allied lawyers, proxy
solicitors and publicists will be there in any case. They say no
technology merger even close to the size of HP and Compaq has ever
worked and that Compaq is mired in the personal computer business,
where it is unprofitable and losing market share to Dell Computer
Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The soap opera showdown pits a charismatic former marketing
executive who vowed to quicken HP's pace against Hewlett, a
philanthropist, academic and software engineer who says his father
would never have planned a business combination that called for the
elimination of 15,000 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   It also is a referendum on investor confidence in the computer
industry, where more than a decade of steady growth in PCs gave way
last year to a downturn.</TE>
<TE>   The vote comes during an intensely nervous time in Silicon
Valley--so nervous that San Jose's Tech Museum of Innovation tonight
will host Intel Corp. Chairman Andy Grove and computer-law guru
Lawrence Lessig at a discussion entitled "Is the Information
Revolution Dead?"</TE>
<TE>   The less certain HP investors are about the future health of the
PC industry, the more likely they are to vote Compaq down. (Compaq's
shareholders, set to vote Wednesday, are more likely to back the deal
whatever their feelings on the industry.)</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett's foundations and those affiliated with the family of HP
co-founder David Packard, which are not PC industry fans, have
pledged to vote their combined 18% stake in HP against the deal.</TE>
<TE>   By the weekend, Hewlett's just-say-no campaign had attracted at
least an additional 4% of HP shares held by institutions that have
announced their position, including such pension funds as CalPERS.
Fiorina has won the public backing of about 9% of the shares,
including those voted by some of the company's biggest investors.</TE>
<TE>   With the majority unannounced, Tuesday's outcome is up for grabs.
HP, however, may have the edge in projecting confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "We are feeling good. We are looking forward to Tuesday," said
company spokeswoman Rebeca Robboy. "We continue to receive strong
indications of support," including votes received by HP's proxy
solicitation firm from investors who haven't commented publicly.</TE>
<TE>   Neither side would say how many proxy cards they have taken in
from supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Many employees and retirees, and even some major mutual funds, are
likely to vote in person Tuesday after hearing the debate.</TE>
<TE>   But almost anything could happen from that point on: The results
may well be too close to call because of two procedural wild cards.</TE>
<TE>   The first variable is how many HP shares are voted out of the
1.94billion outstanding.</TE>
<TE>   Since the winner will be determined by the majority of the shares
that are voted, neither side needs to receive 51% of all possible
proxies to feel confident of winning. Instead, they need to estimate
the turnout, likely to be at least 85%, and make sure they have 51%
of that figure. If it gets close, the actual turnout could be
important, and that might not be known for some time.</TE>
<TE>   The second variable is double or even triple voting. Each side has
sent out multiple proxy cards, and shareholders can change their
minds and send in replacement votes until Tuesday. Only the last vote
counts.</TE>
<TE>   So even though one side may have a majority, it needs to judge how
much of a cushion it needs to cover any late vote switchers.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on the institutional vote, either side may--may--be able to
make a determination of a preliminary decision," Robboy said.</TE>
<TE>   But the bottom line is that any announcement of victory by either
side that comes Tuesday, unless the vote is a blowout, is likely to
be a judgment call that could prove wrong when official results come
in several weeks from now.</TE>
<TE>   The official, certified vote is still far off. The proxies voted
at the meeting and those collected by the solicitation firms will be
handed off Tuesday to IVS Associates Inc.. The firm will take the
cards to its offices in Newark, Del., and begin counting privately,
probably under guard, said IVS Principal Michael Barbera.</TE>
<TE>   Even those results are subject to challenge, which could force a
recount. And there's always the chance of litigation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's possible it will end up like Florida," Hewlett spokesman
Glass said.</TE>

<HD>Big Deals Signal Demand for IPOs</HD>
<DH>Securities: The pace of new filings picks up sharply, and
analysts expect this week's offers to bring in $6.1billion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With multibillion-dollar deals expected this week from Citigroup
Inc.'s Travelers insurance unit and Nestle's eye-care giant Alcon,
the market for initial public stock offerings shows signs of snapping
out of an 18-month rut.</LD>
<LD>   Companies have raised just $2.9billion so far this year by selling
new stock to the public, compared with $4.5 billion in the same
period a year earlier, based on data from research Web site IPO.com.
But analysts expect this week's four IPOs to bring in $6.1billion,
thanks mainly to two mega-deals: Travelers Property Casualty Corp. is
expected to raise $3.7 billion--making it one of the 10 biggest
offerings ever--while the Alcon deal is estimated at $2.3billion.</LD>
<LD>   The pace of new filings has picked up sharply in recent weeks as
the stock market and the economy have shown signs of stability.
Thirty-six firms have filed to go public this year, up from 23 in the
same period last year, according to IPO.com.</LD>
<TE>   "The IPO market needs a strong equity market and a healthy economy
to thrive," said Marc Baum, chief executive of New York-based IPO
Group Inc., which runs IPO.com. "Investors are beginning to feel more
comfortable about the way things are going."</TE>
<TE>   Most of this year's IPOs have fared reasonably well with
investors. But the speculative frenzy that led to huge first-day
price run-ups in 1999 and early 2000--before the bear market
began--shows no sign of returning. That's a good thing, analysts say:
Underwriters and investors are more choosy and prudent these days, so
better-quality deals are getting done.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1999 and 2000, we lived through this blip where all kinds of
companies that shouldn't have gone public took advantage of the stock
market bubble," Baum said. "Now there's a much bigger gantlet that
companies must run through before making their appearance on the
public stage."</TE>
<TE>   This year, only six companies have been yanked from the calendar
of upcoming deals, versus 62 by this time in 2001, a further
indication that investor demand for IPOs is firming, Baum said.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that three deals shelved in 2000 or 2001--Printcafe
Software Inc., medical supplier Kyphon Inc., and DVD lender Netflix
Inc.--are back on the calendar for this spring.</TE>
<TE>   The warm reception investors gave online payment firm PayPal Inc.
a month ago also has given the IPO market a confidence boost, Baum
said. PayPal surged more than 50% in its trading debut, and although
the stock has since dipped, it closed Friday at $17.87, up 37.5% from
its offer price.</TE>
<TE>   Internet-related IPOs were the darlings of the late 1990s bull
market, when many rocketed more than 100% in their trading debuts as
investors clamored for anything with dot-com in its name. But the
sector has been ice-cold for the last two years. PayPal was the first
Net-related IPO in nearly a year.</TE>
<TE>   Though PayPal is unprofitable--an echo of the bubble era--it's
also a "real business in a real area that needs to be served," and
its losses have been narrowing, Baum said.</TE>
<TE>   But the most encouraging trend, he said, may be the array of
business sectors represented by IPOs these days.</TE>
<TE>   Anteon International Corp., which had a solid trading debut last
week with a 16.1% gain, is one of three defense-related companies to
have gone public this year. Meanwhile, several airlines, including
JetBlue Airways Corp. and the regional subsidiaries of Continental
Airlines Inc. and Northwest Airlines Corp., have filed for IPOs.</TE>
<TE>   "We're beginning to see a broad range of stuff, always a sign of a
healthy IPO market," Baum said. "Would anyone have thought we'd be
seeing airline IPOs six months after Sept. 11?"</TE>
<TE>   Although the Travelers and Alcon deals are likely to be huge, Baum
said the performance of those stocks is unlikely to yield clues about
the future strength of the IPO market.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always an appetite for high-quality names, especially
now," he said, noting that established companies such as Kraft Foods
Inc. have been one of the IPO market's few bright spots since the
tech bubble burst. Kraft's shares are up 21.5% since its IPO in June.</TE>
<TE>   Other blue-chip companies considering major IPOs include General
Electric Co., according to a report Friday in the Wall Street
Journal. GE might sell a 20% stake in its property and casualty
reinsurance unit, Employers Reinsurance Corp., to the public and spin
off the rest to investors, the report said, although the conglomerate
declined to comment.</TE>

<HD>Pensions Are Losing Popularity</HD>
<DH>Retirement: With many employers having to contribute this
year, smaller plans are at risk.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The traditional corporate pension, which gives workers a guaranteed
paycheck in retirement, has rarely looked more attractive--or been
more endangered, pension experts say.</LD>
<LD>   The Enron Corp. scandal and two years of back-to-back losses in
401(k) accounts have raised questions about the wisdom of shifting
the responsibility for retirement saving to workers.</LD>
<LD>   But far from enjoying a renaissance, traditional corporate pension
plans are falling even further out of favor with employers.</LD>
<TE>   For the first time in years, many companies will have to
contribute money this year to pension funds that until recently had
been bursting with returns from a booming stock market.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the recession has increased pressure on
companies to cut costs.</TE>
<TE>   Pension experts believe this double squeeze will persuade more
companies to shut down their pensions and discourage others from
starting new plans.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll see more plan freezes and plan closures," said pension
expert Steve Vernon of consultant Watson Wyatt. "Some of the
companies that are already cash-strapped won't be able to tolerate
these [contribution] increases."</TE>
<TE>   No one is predicting the extinction of traditional pensions, which
cover some 36 million workers nationwide. The big, unionized
industrial companies are unlikely to abandon their plans, pension
experts said. But smaller plans are on the endangered list. And
workers without pensions aren't likely to get them in the future.</TE>
<TE>   The decline of the corporate pension could mean more workers
reaching retirement age without enough money to retire, consumer
advocates warn.</TE>
<TE>   They point to disasters such as that at Enron--where workers lost
$1 billion in 401(k) accounts heavily invested in the company's
stock--as evidence that workers may not be the best stewards of
retirement money.</TE>
<TE>   "Ideally, the 401(k) should be a supplement to a traditional
pension plan, not a substitute," said Karen Friedman, director of
policy strategy for the Pension Rights Center.</TE>
<TE>   Traditional pensions enjoyed a heyday after World War II and the
Korean War, when wage controls forced employers to add benefits to
compete for scarce workers.</TE>
<TE>   But pensions lost ground with the decline of the manufacturing
sector, where defined benefit plans typically are part of
union-negotiated compensation packages, said Alicia Munnell, director
of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. Traditional
pensions also were pushed out, Munnell said, by employers' rush to
401(k) plans.</TE>
<TE>   In 1975, 43% of corporate employees were covered by a traditional
pension, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute. By
2000, that proportion had dropped to 20%.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to 401(k)s, in which workers invest their own money
(often with some match from the company) and bear all the investment
risk, traditional pensions are entirely funded by the employer, who
is required to make up for any shortfalls if the plan doesn't have
enough money to pay promised retirement benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Those promises also are backed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corp., a quasi-government agency that steps in if employers go
bankrupt, default or fail to adequately fund their plans. The agency
collects premiums from companies to cover this risk and sets
guidelines for how much money employers must contribute to their
plans.</TE>
<TE>   The contribution amount varies from year to year, depending partly
on how well the plans' investments perform. In good years, such as
the late 1990s, companies might not make any contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Earnings at companies in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 were boosted by
an average of 5% to 7% during the stock market boom of the late '90s,
said Ronald Ryan of pension tracker Ryan Lab Inc. At IBM Corp., for
example, pension fund profit since 1986 exceeded expectations by more
than $5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   But two years of poor stock returns have "ravaged" pension plan
finances, which will force companies to pony up more money to keep
their pensions fully funded, Ryan said. Ryan, like many other
analysts, thinks hefty pension contributions will lead to reduced
corporate earnings, lower credit ratings for companies and increased
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. insurance premiums in coming years.</TE>
<TE>   Some companies already have reported that their pension earnings
have dropped sharply, including General Electric Co., General Motors
Corp., IBM and tractor maker Deere &amp; Co., which said its pension plan
lost $1 billion last year. While these companies don't expect to have
to contribute to their pension plans in the near future, J.C. Penney
Co. said last month that pension expenses would cost the company 25
cents a share in 2003. That compares with earnings of 85 cents to 95
cents that the retailer expects this year.</TE>
<TE>   Congress provided companies some relief from the pension crunch
earlier this month when lawmakers, as part of the economic stimulus
bill, loosened minimum funding requirements for the plans. Employers
had complained that the requirements, which tie pension funding to
the 30-year Treasury bond, had been unfairly inflated as the
government bond hit record lows.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the relief, though, most of the nation's biggest
companies will still have to contribute to their plans, pension
consultants said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really the plan assets that drive the swings in funding,"
said pension expert Lee Straate of Milliman USA, "and obviously we've
seen some pretty significant decreases in assets in the past few
years" because of stock market losses.</TE>
<TE>   Many companies will be forced to make contributions equaling 3% to
5% of their payrolls this year, said Vernon of Watson Wyatt. Those
facing the biggest contributions, he said, are companies that have
contributed nothing to their plans for years--in some cases more than
a decade. "It's going to be a jolt," Vernon said.</TE>
<TE>   Some companies could freeze or close their plans rather than bear
the increased costs, said Ron O'Hanley, president of Mellon
Institutional Asset Management. In a plan freeze, current workers
keep whatever pension benefit they've accrued, but they don't earn
additional benefits, and new employees aren't allowed into the plan.
In a plan closure, new hires are excluded from joining the plan but
current workers continue to accrue benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Few employers are likely to shut down their plans completely,
pension experts said, because such terminations are costly and
require paying out accrued benefits to workers.</TE>
<TE>   Most plan closures and freezes in recent years have been because
employers were trying to avoid future costs, rather than deal with
current expenses, pension experts said. For example, Frontier Corp.,
then the fifth-largest long-distance provider, froze its plan in 1996
because it was concerned about future liabilities. The plan was later
transferred to Citizen Communications Co., which bought parts of
Frontier from Global Crossing Ltd.</TE>
<TE>   Cost isn't the only factor in employers' decisions to close
pension plans or their failure to start new ones, said pension
attorney Dianne Bennett, author of a book on pension plan taxation.
Many employers are convinced that workers don't appreciate the plans.</TE>
<TE>   Employers complain that employees--particularly younger
workers--don't understand the benefits of a traditional pension or
don't believe they'll be at one job long enough to benefit.</TE>
<TE>   Workers typically begin to accrue pension benefits after five
years, but they often must stay at their employer for 15 years or
more to get full benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Only 6% of workers surveyed by the Employee Benefit Research
Institute in 1997 and 1999 ranked traditional pension plans as a
vital benefit, compared with 25% who called 401(k) plans essential.</TE>
<TE>   "A defined benefit plan doesn't mean as much to employees as a
401(k), [even though the 401(k)] might be worth less in the long
run," Bennett said. "If you're an employer and your employees don't
appreciate [the pension], it's hard to justify the expense."</TE>

<HD>Fed Could Pave Way to a Rate Increase</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stock and bond markets face a big test this week as Federal Reserve
policymakers gather to take what may be their first step toward
tighter credit in the reviving economy.</LD>
<LD>   The Fed, scheduled to meet Tuesday, is expected to keep its
benchmark short-term interest rate at the current 40-year low of
1.75%.</LD>
<LD>   But in their official statement after the meeting, Fed Chairman
Alan Greenspan and peers are widely expected to shift their "bias" on
rates to neutral--paving the way for higher rates later this year.</LD>
<TE>   The central bank, which slashed short-term rates 11 times last
year to ease the economy's pain in the first recession since 1991,
has increasingly signaled that it believes the economic downturn is
over. Indeed, this month Greenspan declared that a recovery is "well
underway."</TE>
<TE>   But he and other Fed officials also have been careful to say that
they believe the economy still is fragile and that the rebound may
not be robust.</TE>
<TE>   For that reason the Fed is expected to go slow in raising rates,
even though some economists say that at 1.75%--the Fed's target for
the so-called federal funds rate, the overnight loan rate among
banks--money costs are at artificially low levels.</TE>
<TE>   In a nod to the economy's turnaround, however, the Fed is likely
to change its official bias on rates to neutral. That would mean the
Fed sees the risks to the economy as evenly balanced between growth
that is too strong (possibly threatening higher inflation) and growth
that is too weak, or negative.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last year the central bank has viewed the primary risk as
one of further economic weakness.</TE>
<TE>   A Reuters news service poll of major Treasury bond dealers Friday
found that 19 of 24 dealers expect the Fed to change its bias to
neutral at Tuesday's meeting.</TE>
<TE>   But the earliest any of the dealers expect a rate increase by the
Fed is May. And most believe the central bank will seek to avoid
raising rates before late summer, to give the economy ample time to
get going.</TE>
<TE>   Stock and bond markets will be looking closely at the Fed's choice
of words in Tuesday's statement for signs that policymakers may be
considering a rate increase sooner rather than later, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   The stock market in recent weeks has largely embraced the idea
that the economic revival is real and that the Fed won't snuff it
out.</TE>
<TE>   Last week the Dow Jones industrial average hit its highest levels
since June, closing Friday at 10,607.23. The Dow is up 5.8%
year-to-date.</TE>
<TE>   Among broader indexes, the rally in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 in
recent weeks has left it up 1.6% this year.</TE>
<TE>   The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite, however, remains in the
red, down 4.2% year-to-date after slumping 3.2% last week to close
Friday at 1,868.30.</TE>
<TE>   In the bond market, yields on longer-term Treasury issues have
surged in recent weeks, taking their cue from strong economic data.</TE>
<TE>   The yield on the 10-year T-note, a benchmark for mortgage rates,
rose last week to its highest level since midsummer. It closed Friday
at 5.33%.</TE>
<TE>   Investors often begin to bail out of Treasury bonds--pushing
yields higher--well before the Fed raises short-term rates, analysts
note. But some argue that a weak economic recovery could put a low
ceiling over both the Fed's key short-term rate and over long-term
bond yields for most of this year.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, business and consumer borrowers could benefit if the
Fed keeps its key rate at 1.75% for now: Most banks peg their prime
lending rates 3 percentage points above the federal funds rate. So
the prime now is 4.75%. Many consumer loan rates, such as home equity
credit line rates, are pegged to the prime.</TE>

<LD>Jurors begin deliberations this week in a $300-million wrongful death
case accusing Philip Morris Cos. of misleading an Oregon woman who
died of lung cancer after smoking low-tar cigarettes.</LD>
<LD>   Michelle Schwarz, a smoker of low-tar Merit cigarettes who died in
1999 at age 53, "suffered injury and death as a direct result of her
reliance on the defendant's misrepresentation," Lawrence Wobbrock,
the attorney representing her family, told jurors during closing
arguments last week.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers for Philip Morris maintained that Schwarz was well aware
of the risks of smoking but chose to continue anyway.</LD>
<TE>   Schwarz's husband, Richard, and other family members claim the
mother of two believed the low-tar brand was a less dangerous
alternative to regular cigarettes.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The two top executives of troubled global fiber-optic network carrier
Global Crossing Ltd. will testify before a congressional panel
investigating the company's collapse.</LD>
<LD>   Global Crossing said in a statement that Chief Executive John
Legere and Chief Financial Officer Dan Cohrs will appear before the
subcommittee on oversight and investigations of the House Committee
on Financial Services on Thursday .</LD>
<LD>   The panel's chairwoman, Rep. Sue W. Kelly (R-N.Y.), said the
purpose of the hearing was "to examine the effects of the Global
Crossing bankruptcy on investors, financial markets and employees,"
the company said.</LD>
<TE>   The company, based in Hamilton, Bermuda, but operated from Beverly
Hills, filed for bankruptcy protection Jan. 28.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing, which operates a high-speed communications
network linking 200 cities in 27 countries, has been the target of an
investigation by securities regulators and the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   A former finance executive who is suing Global Crossing over his
dismissal has alleged that the company engaged in misleading
transactions that boosted revenue on paper through largely worthless
capacity swaps with other telecommunications companies.</TE>
<TE>   Last week the House Energy and Commerce Committee requested
documents from the company relating to accounting issues and insider
stock sales.</TE>

<HD>U.S., Canada Move to End Lumber Dispute</HD>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Negotiations between the United States and Canada to end a
multibillion-dollar brawl over lumber trade moved forward as the
countries swapped proposals for a new tax to control wood shipments,
sources close to the talks said.</LD>
<LD>   With a self-imposed Thursday deadline for a deal fast approaching,
the two governments were expected to have continued negotiations
through the weekend.</LD>
<LD>   The trade dispute has become such an irritant in U.S.-Canadian
relations that it was discussed at length during a recent White House
meeting between President Bush and Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. has accused Canada of unfairly subsidizing the sale of
about $6 billion of wood shipped to the U.S. each year, about
one-third of the U.S. market.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, preliminary duties averaging about 32% were approved
by the Commerce Department last year.</TE>
<TE>   Canada denies the charges. But hoping to end the duties and
continued uncertainty over the lucrative U.S. market for wood used in
home building, Canada has been looking for a deal.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides are hoping to wrap up their talks within the next few
days, before Thursday's deadline for a final decision by the Commerce
Department on the punitive duties.</TE>

<LD>The Enron Corp. debacle has persuaded 72% of 401(k) investors to
change their behavior in some way, although only 27% said they are
diversifying their portfolios more, according to a survey conducted
for brokerage Charles Schwab &amp; Co.</LD>
<LD>   In the survey, conducted by telephone Feb. 7 to 11, 33% of the 620
investors polled said they now avoid companies they don't understand,
and 31% said they do more research before investing. Also, 22% said
they pay more attention to financial advisors as a direct result of
energy giant Enron's meltdown, and 15% said they worry more about
their investments. The survey's margin of error is plus or minus 4
percentage points.</LD>
<LD>   Enron filed for bankruptcy protection Dec. 2, wiping out billions
of dollars of investors' equity and the 401(k) retirement funds of
workers who had invested heavily in company stock. Financial planners
said the company's crash vividly demonstrates the need for 401(k)
investors to diversify.</LD>

<HD>Shaw Bros. Returning Action to Hong Kong</HD>
<DH>Film: After completion of the new Movie City production
complex, the studio plans to release about 20 titles a year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY KUHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>HONG KONG</DL>
<LD>At the center of an ambitious bid to revitalize one of Asia's great
movie capitals, the venerable Shaw Bros. Studios is emerging from two
decades of dormancy to build Hong Kong's largest movie studio.</LD>
<LD>   Coupled with the release on video this year of classic Shaw Bros.
films--long awaited by a loyal cult following--the studio's
reemergence could help put in perspective Hong Kong cinema's
popularity and influence in Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   Whether the ventures will be successful financially or herald the
revival of Hong Kong's long-depressed film industry remains to be
seen. The local cinema, which launched Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan to
international stardom, has succumbed to competition from pirated
video and television, and theatrical releases here often are
unprofitable.</LD>
<TE>   The expanding media empire of Run Run Shaw, the firm's 94-year-old
patriarch, will require new content, especially new movies.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw Bros. and its sister company, TVB, Hong Kong's largest
terrestrial television broadcaster, recently won one of five
potentially lucrative government licenses to launch pay-TV services
in this former British colony. They already have cable and
satellite-TV systems aimed at Chinese-language communities in Asia,
Europe and North America.</TE>
<TE>   The new Movie City, being built at Tseung Kwan O on the eastern
end of the Kowloon Peninsula, is expected to cost more than $100
million and include more than 450,000 square feet of state-of-the-art
sound stages, post-production facilities and screening rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw Bros. will hold a 35% share in the project, with a consortium
of investors holding the rest. After completing the facility in 2005,
Shaw Bros. plans to release about 20 new films a year.</TE>
<TE>   During its 1960s and '70s heyday, Shaw Bros. had the largest
privately owned movie studio in the world, churning out 40 movies
annually. Some directors made three or four films a year.</TE>
<TE>   The tight production deadlines and budgets and experienced crews
of Hong Kong's film industry helped it to rank second to Hollywood in
film exports. The box-office take of American movies in Hong Kong
cinemas did not surpass that of local films until 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The Shaw Bros. organization traces its roots to Shanghai in the
1920s, when Runje, Runme and Run Run Shaw, sons of a wealthy textile
merchant, began producing silent movies through their Unique Film
Productions Co.</TE>
<TE>   They later moved their operations to Singapore. By the late 1930s,
they had a circuit of more than 100 cinemas across Southeast Asia, as
well as several amusement parks and dance halls.</TE>
<TE>   The new Movie City will not be far from Movie Town, Shaw Bros.'
home. Movie Town represented Shaw Bros.' effort during its golden
years to match Hollywood production standards. At the time, the
facility was the best in Asia, and a glossy studio look, with ancient
Chinese towns and ornate courtroom settings, became a hallmark of
Shaw Bros. films.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw Bros. needs to make new movies in part because last year it
sold a film library of some 800 movies--the world's largest
Chinese-language film collection--to the Malaysian media conglomerate
Usaha Tegas Sdn. Bhd., also known as UTSB.</TE>
<TE>   Celestial Pictures, UTSB's Hong Kong subsidiary, is busy restoring
original prints, brightening faded colors and filling in broken
frames in preparation for their release this summer on DVD and other
video formats. Celestial is negotiating with potential video
distributors.</TE>
<TE>   UTSB plans to use the library as the foundation of a
Chinese-language movie channel, to be distributed to Chinese
communities worldwide. The channel plans to begin operations this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Celestial plans to issue 20 remastered movies a month, "enough for
a Shaw Bros. rack" in video stores, said Shirley Chung, Celestial's
corporate affairs general manager. This would include box sets for
Shaw's various genres, including historical dramas, ghost stories,
swordplay epics and erotic films.</TE>
<TE>   "The Shaw Bros. library is so rich in genre, you could study it
for ages," Chung said.</TE>
<TE>   Watching the old Shaw Bros. films is bound to prompt comparisons
with movies being made in Hollywood by Hong Kong directors and
actors, many of whom got their start at Shaw Bros. studios.</TE>
<TE>   The foremost example probably is veteran action-film director John
Woo, whose themes of heroism and loyalty and carefully composed
action shots owe much to Chang Cheh, his mentor. Chang directed more
than 60 martial arts films for Shaw Bros. during its golden era,
including "The One-Armed Swordsman" in 1967 and "Five Deadly Venoms"
in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, a retrospective look at Shaw Bros. "old school" martial
arts films shows off one of Hong Kong's greatest strengths:
synthesizing the cultures of East and West.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1960s and '70s, Run Run Shaw was determined to create a
new style of martial arts movie. He wanted his "martial arts century"
to deliver more realistic action and psychological detail than
earlier Chinese films, which reflected the influences of Peking opera
in their action and character portrayal.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw advised his directors on which new foreign films to watch for
ideas. Chang, for example, was quick to absorb the techniques and
styles of such directors as Sam Peckinpah and Akira Kurosawa.</TE>
<TE>   One of Chang's martial arts choreographers, Lau Kar-Leung, went on
to direct some of Shaw's most popular films, including the 1978 cult
favorite "36th Chamber of Shaolin."</TE>
<TE>   These directors, said film scholar David Bordwell at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison, created a film language that
"communicated the qualities of grace and force so effectively that
you almost feel the kinetic impact, not just from the martial arts
moves but also through the framing and cutting" of the film.</TE>
<TE>   Without the budgets or technology for flashy special effects, the
Shaw films relied on their actors' physical prowess and directors'
resourceful camera work and hiding of wires and trampolines.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at the old pictures, you have to wonder how we made
them, without computers or anything," said Lawrence Wong, director of
film production and a veteran of numerous Shaw Bros. classics.</TE>
<TE>   Fight scenes in "old school" kung fu movies typically used long,
carefully composed shots, giving a clear view of the martial arts
techniques, with their staccato rhythm of explosive punches, kicks
and blocks.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Bordwell said, many Hollywood directors "will hire a Hong
Kong choreographer, but then shoot and cut the scene in a way that's
just visual gibberish--when the Hong Kong filmmakers come over to
America, mostly I think their work is not as interesting, partly
because of those shooting routines."</TE>
<TE>   Also lacking in the current Hong Kong-influenced cinema are
traditions of lore and literature, on which the Shaw Bros. movies
drew. Although exotic and unfamiliar to Western audiences, the
references are well known to Chinese viewers.</TE>
<TE>   These sources include epic novels such as "Outlaws of the Marsh,"
the classic sleuthing tales of Judge Bao and the martial arts dramas
of modern author Louis Cha. They also drew on history, from the
Shaolin Temple and anti-Manchu secret societies to the Boxer
Rebellion of 1900.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese viewers also quickly recognize the codes of loyalty and
honor among fighters of the "martial forest," as well as the Taoist
philosophy that the superior warrior wins without fighting, defusing
conflicts without having to unleash his mastery of martial technique.</TE>
<TE>   Although the use by many martial arts films of these cultural and
ethical contexts was sometimes exploitative--an excuse for bloody
combat--it also arguably is a redeeming feature amid otherwise
gratuitous violence.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. movies that use martial arts choreography contain little or
no reference to discipline, humility or other aspects of the "martial
virtues" or the hard work needed to build martial skills. Characters
in American films just "know kung fu," as Keanu Reeves discovers
after he has the skills programmed into him in "The Matrix."</TE>
<TE>   This cultural disconnect, aggravated by the hilariously bad
dubbing endemic to the genre, contributed to martial arts movies'
reputation among mainstream foreign audiences as little more than
gore and kitsch--in other words, cult fare.</TE>
<TE>   The cult status, Bordwell said, was reinforced by distribution
patterns. During the 1970s, the movies played mostly at inner-city
theaters and other down-market venues under the radar of mass
audiences and critics, cross-fertilizing other genres and
subcultures, from "blaxploitation" and horror films to rap and reggae
music.</TE>

<HD>Payment Will Depend on Timing of Vacation Accrual</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: Although my company's employee manual says that employees
are not allowed to accumulate more than three weeks of vacation, my
paycheck shows that I have accrued much more vacation time.</LD>
<LD>   I'm getting ready to leave the firm and am wondering if I am going
to have trouble getting paid for all of the unused vacation.</LD>
<LD>   --S.P., Thousand Oaks</LD>
<TE>   Answer: You may have problems if your employer's policy expressly
provides a three-week limit for accumulated vacation.</TE>
<TE>   It depends on whether you have been allowed to accumulate more
than three weeks because of a clerical error or whether you
accumulated the extra vacation pay before the three-week limit on
accumulation was put into place.</TE>
<TE>   If it is just a clerical mistake, you probably will not be able to
collect. But if you accumulated this vacation pay before your
employer placed a maximum on vacation accruals, you may be entitled
to receive the additional vacation pay.</TE>

<TE>   Employer Must Refund Overpaid Disability Tax</TE>
<TE>   Q: My sole employer for 2001 has withheld too much for the state
disability insurance tax, which means I paid more than the maximum
amount for the year.</TE>
<TE>   My employer says I need to request a credit for the overpaid SDI
amount on my 2001 state tax return. I say my employer needs to refund
the overpaid amount to me.</TE>
<TE>   Who's correct?</TE>
<TE>   --J.S., Sunnyvale</TE>
<TE>   A: You are correct. When one employer withholds excessive amounts
for the state disability insurance tax, that employer must refund the
amount that was overpaid.</TE>
<TE>   When excessive SDI amounts are withheld by two or more employers,
you would claim a credit on your state tax return. See the
instructions for Line 41 in your 2001 California personal income tax
return.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, the maximum wages subject to the disability insurance tax
were $46,327. The maximum SDI tax on this amount was $416.94.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 11.9 million California employees pay the tax, which is
intended to provide short-term benefits for non-work-related
illnesses or injuries, as well as pregnancies.</TE>
<TE>   Some employers fail to pay attention to the maximum amount that
can be taxed. Correcting the mistake should be relatively easy even
if it carries over to a new calendar year. Corrective entries should
be made by the employer when reporting SDI payments to the Employment
Development Department.</TE>
<TE>   You acted properly in calling the overpayment to your employer's
attention. The sooner you let the employer know, the quicker the
company can correct the problem.</TE>
<TE>   You should not face retaliation for complaining about an improper
wage deduction.</TE>

<TE>   Find Another Way to Curb Tardiness</TE>
<TE>   Q: To encourage staff to arrive on time, we would like to
institute a policy docking employees half an hour if they are more
than six minutes late.</TE>
<TE>   Promptness is critical because the employees supervise children.</TE>
<TE>   Is such a policy legal? If not, is there another way to try to
curb the tardiness without termination or other disciplinary action?</TE>
<TE>   --M.C., Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   A: Such a policy would not be legal.</TE>
<TE>   The law protects the right of nonexempt employees to be paid for
all the time they work. Therefore, even though your goal is perfectly
reasonable and is important for your business, you may not achieve it
by docking employees for more than the time they actually are late.</TE>
<TE>   As you suggest, however, it certainly would be legal to discipline
and even discharge employees who fail to show up for work on time.</TE>
<TE>   Another legal option would be to make tardy employees wait an
additional period before allowing them to start work. This would
encourage them to arrive on time, but it does not sound like it would
be consistent with your need to provide timely child supervision.</TE>

<LD>Executive Roundtable is a weekly column by TEC Worldwide, an
international organization of more than 7,000 business owners,
company presidents and chief executives. TEC members meet in small
peer groups to share their business experiences and help each other
solve problems in a round-table session. The following question and
answer is a summary of discussions at a recent TEC meeting in
Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Question: I run a $20-million professional services firm that
recently undertook a major information technology project. Thanks to
constant changes--on our part as well as the software vendor's--we've
gone way over budget and missed deadline after deadline.</LD>
<TE>   After six months and nearly half a million dollars, there's still
no light at the end of the tunnel.</TE>
<TE>   My employees are frustrated, the project team has lost all
credibility and I'm at wit's end. Should I pull the plug and start
over or forge ahead and try to salvage what I can from the situation?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Keep repeating to yourself, "Technology makes our lives
easier, technology makes our lives easier." Then take a deep breath,
step back and try to figure out what went wrong.</TE>
<TE>   The first step, said Suzanne Frindt, a principal in the consulting
firm of 2130 Partners in Villa Park, involves determining the cause
of the delays.</TE>
<TE>   Do you have clearly defined goals for the project? If so, have you
clearly communicated those goals to your vendor?</TE>
<TE>   Equally important, does your vendor have the experience and
expertise to deliver the goods and help you achieve your goals?</TE>
<TE>   If you can't answer yes to these questions, you're doomed from the
start.</TE>
<TE>   Next, look at your project management process. Do you have one
person in charge of the project or are you attempting to manage by
committee?</TE>
<TE>   Too many cooks in the kitchen will ruin any chances for success.
If it's one person, does this manager have any experience handling IT
projects or are they learning on the job?</TE>
<TE>   More important, does this person have enough time to commit to the
project or is he or she attempting to squeeze it onto an already full
plate?</TE>
<TE>   Managing a large IT project requires a major investment of time
and energy. When nobody pays attention to the big picture, things can
easily get out of control.</TE>
<TE>   Do you have a series of timelines and deadlines to measure
progress on the project?</TE>
<TE>   Are you sticking with the original plan or constantly trying to
add new bells and whistles?</TE>
<TE>   Finally, how many people have access to the software vendor and
permission to approve changes?</TE>
<TE>   Nothing slows down an IT project like having half a dozen people
running to the vendor with new changes and work orders every day.</TE>
<TE>   Once you have pinpointed the causes of the delays, said Mark Van
Ness, Chief Executive of Sperry Van Ness in Irvine, then you can
decide whether to move forward or scrap the project altogether.</TE>
<TE>   "Go back to your original plan," he said, "and ask the following
questions: Why did we set out down this path in the first place? What
did we hope to accomplish? Does our initial plan solve the problem we
originally wanted to solve? Can we still accomplish those goals with
this vendor?</TE>
<TE>   "If your answer is yes, get very clear agreement from your staff
and the vendor that you will complete the project according to plan.</TE>
<TE>   "Break the project down into specific phases and set mandatory
deadlines to accomplish each phase. Get a firm commitment from the
vendor on how long each phase will take and how much it will cost.</TE>
<TE>   "Make sure only one person--preferably the project manager--has
access to the vendor, and have that person sign off on every phase,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Most important, set the expectation that once you complete the
project, everyone will have to live with the new system a while
before you start tinkering with it again. Otherwise, it will never
end."</TE>
<TE>   When should you pull the plug? When things get so out of hand that
it becomes impossible to accomplish your original goals, or when the
amount of time and money required to complete the project endangers
other strategic priorities, or if both occur, said Jim Muse, CEO of
Muse Presentation Technologies in Santa Ana.</TE>

<HD>Judge Narrows Wording of British Telecom Claim</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An initial ruling by a U.S. judge has narrowed what British Telecom
can say to prove its claim to have invented hyperlinking, in a
high-profile case that could give BT rights to demand royalties on
Internet use.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Colleen McMahon of the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York issued an opinion last week that only partially
accepted the wording of BT arguments that its 1970s patent should
cover modern Internet linking methods.</LD>
<LD>   The judge cast doubt on the relevance of some of the patent's
concepts to the decentralized network of computers now called the
Internet, in an interpretation of arcane computing concepts that
could be decisive in a jury trial.</LD>
<TE>   BT's first target is Prodigy, the oldest online access service,
which is now a unit of SBC Communications Inc. If the bid is
successful, BT has said it is ready to try to force other U.S.
Internet access providers to pay royalties on behalf of millions of
subscribers.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Morpheus MusicCity, a service that allows users to trade copyrighted
songs and films, has quietly added an anti-piracy feature to its
site, its first move to protect some artists from unlawful downloads
of their music.</LD>
<LD>   Beginning in April, StreamCast Networks, the U.S. company that
operates the popular site, will add technology to erase a downloaded
song from a computer after the user listens to it a certain number of
times.</LD>
<LD>   But it will apply the anti-piracy measure to benefit only artists
who do business with Morpheus as it seeks to become a major venue to
promote lesser-known, unsigned acts. Users would sample songs but
ultimately would have to buy them.</LD>

<HD>MSC.Software to Buy Mechanical Dynamics</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Simulation software maker MSC.Software Corp. of Santa Ana is expected
to announce today that it will buy Mechanical Dynamics Inc. for
$116.6 million in cash.</LD>
<LD>   Ann Arbor, Mich.-based Mechanical Dynamics specializes in software
and services that allow engineers in the automotive, aerospace, rail,
general machinery and other industries to make and test virtual
prototypes of their designs. The acquisition would expand
MSC.Software's offerings into the product life-cycle management
market.</LD>
<LD>   MSC.Software is fighting an attempt by the Federal Trade
Commission to undo two of its previous acquisitions on the grounds
that they allowed the company to corner the market for Nastran
engineering software, which is used to simulate conditions for
aerospace and auto designs.</LD>
<TE>   This acquisition would not affect that case because Mechanical
Dynamics is in the market for "virtual prototyping, which is a
totally different ballgame," company spokesman Todd Evans said.</TE>
<TE>   MSC.Software would pay $18.85 for each share outstanding of
Mechanical Dynamics, a 57% premium over Friday's closing price of
$12.01 in Nasdaq trading.</TE>

<HD>Galileo May Put Europe Back in Orbit</HD>
<DH>The European Union is pushing ahead with a $3-billion rival
to GPS despite U.S. opposition with military overtones.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GEITNER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>A bust of Christopher Columbus stands proudly outside the office of
the head of the European Space Agency, a reminder of Europe's grand
tradition of exploration and the riches it can bring.</LD>
<LD>   Nowadays, space is the new frontier, and Europe has mostly ceded
its trailblazing role to the powerful nation in the New World whose
settlement Columbus initiated. But that doesn't mean the treasure
hunt is over.</LD>
<LD>   European leaders are pushing ahead with commercial ventures to
exploit outer space, despite sometimes blunt U.S. opposition with
military overtones.</LD>
<TE>   Having already snared half the global market for commercial space
launches with its Ariane rockets, Europe is set to give the go-ahead
for a $3-billion rival to the U.S.-run global positioning system.</TE>
<TE>   A decision to release $392 million in development funds is
expected at a meeting of European Union ministers in Brussels this
month.</TE>
<TE>   That would resuscitate Galileo, a project tied up for a year by
money woes that recently came under attack by the Pentagon, which
controls GPS and--some Europeans believe--is loath to lose its
monopoly.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials insist they're not trying to dictate to Europe.
They point out that GPS, which also is undergoing an upgrade, is
already available worldwide--for free.</TE>
<TE>   "The United States sees no compelling need for Galileo," said
Ralph Braibanti, the U.S. State Department official leading talks
with the EU on the project.</TE>
<TE>   Yet perceived attempts at U.S. interference may have helped rescue
Galileo. Just as it seemed the plug was about to be pulled a few
months ago on cost grounds, the debate shifted to geopolitics.</TE>
<TE>   French President Jacques Chirac warned that Europe risked "vassal
status" if it didn't keep up in the space race.</TE>
<TE>   EU Transport Commissioner Loyola de Palacio of Spain spoke of the
dangers of others "calling the shots."</TE>
<TE>   "Is it essential for Europe that we have our strategic
independence or not?" the head of the European Space Agency, Antonio
Rodata, asked in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Germany had been the key holdout but finally decided to come on
board in late February.</TE>
<TE>   Swaying the cash-strapped German government was the "considerable
political, strategic and economic importance" of Europe having its
own system.</TE>
<TE>   The European Space Agency, which is separate from the EU, was set
up in 1975 with the express mission of helping Europe catch up with
the U.S. and Soviet space programs. It has a long history of
cooperation with NASA in scientific missions.</TE>
<TE>   The agency provided the solar panels and one of the main
instruments on the Hubble telescope, for example, and built a probe
for NASA's Cassini spacecraft en route now to Saturn.</TE>
<TE>   But to remain competitive in the 21st century, Europe believes it
must do more than just provide "bits and pieces" to NASA projects.</TE>
<TE>   This month the space agency launched its own $2-billion Earth
observation satellite to aid climate change research. It also was the
originator of commercial moneymakers such as the Ariane launchers and
Eutelsat, which produces communications satellites.</TE>
<TE>   According to the agency, each euro of taxpayer money spent since
the 1970s on the Ariane rockets has produced a three- or fourfold
return on investment in the form of increased economic activity.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important that we master this technology to create
opportunity in Europe," Rodata said.</TE>
<TE>   The space agency and the European Commission, the EU's head
office, announced plans for Galileo in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Private investment would help defray the cost of building and
launching 30 satellites, backers say. With six more satellites than
GPS, Galileo could provide added value and greater accuracy.
Royalties from decoder chip sales and revenues from customers would
start pouring in once the system is operational in 2008.</TE>
<TE>   An independent study by PricewaterhouseCoopers saw the strongest
commercial potential of Galileo in so-called location-based mobile
technologies, where Europe already leads the United States. Such
services allow cell phone users to track down the nearest pub, for
example, or zero in on friends.</TE>
<TE>   But the study also said EU governments probably would have to bear
the costs of getting Galileo up and running.</TE>
<TE>   That has worried some, notably Britain and the Netherlands, which
managed to garner enough votes to postpone releasing development
funds in December.</TE>
<TE>   EU spokesman Gilles Gantelet dismisses such concerns as a pretext
and instead blames unfair U.S. lobbying.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before the December vote, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense
Paul Wolfowitz wrote EU colleagues questioning the "security
ramifications for future NATO operations" if Galileo goes ahead.</TE>
<TE>   His concern was that Galileo signals could interfere with the
next-generation GPS signals intended for military use.</TE>
<TE>   Galileo backers say such technical problems can be resolved. And
although Galileo will not be operated by the military, as GPS is,
they insist security concerns are not being ignored.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials are less sure.</TE>
<TE>   "There's some tough issues that have to be worked out," Braibanti,
the State Department official, said from Washington. "The jury is
still out as to whether a solid basis for cooperation still exists."</TE>

<HD>Turn That CD Into an MP3</HD>
<DH>RipFlash by PoGo Products gets around copy protection.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM HEID</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two years ago, the online music scene was a rowdy rave. Start-ups
such as Napster Inc. were tripping on the ecstasy of venture capital,
and people who would never try to pilfer a compact disc from the
local record store were downloading MP3 tracks as fast as their
Internet connections would permit.</LD>
<LD>   Napster's party isn't quite over, but it has reached the phase in
which the janitor is sweeping the floor. Napster's days as a den of
music thieves are over after aggressive pursuit by the recording
industry and resulting successes in the courts.</LD>
<LD>   Napster is trying to reinvent itself as a music-subscription
service, but the process is going slowly. This month the company laid
off 10% of its work force--its second round of layoffs in six months.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, as decentralized swapping services such as Gnutella
continue to thrive, record companies are experimenting with
copy-protection schemes that would prohibit music lovers from
converting their audio CDs into MP3 tracks.</TE>
<TE>   Their plans face opposition from consumers and lawmakers--and they
may well be futile, thanks to a new portable MP3 player that also can
record audio in MP3 format.</TE>
<TE>   PoGo Products' $198 RipFlash looks like an ordinary MP3 portable.
It's petite, about the size of a half-inch-high stack of business
cards. Its display screen is tiny and its menu system is awkward.
This is no Apple Computer Inc. iPod. Nor does it have the iPod's
5-gigabyte hard drive, but it does contain a generous 128 megabytes
of memory and a slot that can hold an additional 128 MB.</TE>
<TE>   If the RipFlash were a conventional, playback-only MP3 portable,
it would be left in the dust by half a dozen products. But what sets
this device apart is its ability to record. Next to the RipFlash's
headphone jack is an audio-input jack: Connect the included cable to
any audio source and you can record audio in MP3 format.</TE>
<TE>   Connect the RipFlash to your stereo system and you can create MP3
tracks from your favorite vinyl albums. The RipFlash even can detect
the pauses between songs and make each song a separate MP3 file.</TE>
<TE>   Connect the RipFlash to your computer's speaker jack and you can
record streaming audio programs. Take those archives of National
Public Radio's "Fresh Air" with you on the road.</TE>
<TE>   There's even a business angle to the RipFlash. The device has a
tiny microphone and a voice-recording mode, so you can use it to
record meetings, dictation or notes. You can listen to voice
recordings using headphones or the RipFlash's built-in speaker.</TE>
<TE>   So how does the RipFlash thwart CD copy-protection schemes? It
lets you record the audio output of your stereo. You might not be
able to record off a protected CD using MP3 software, but you can
play the CD on your stereo. And if you've connected the RipFlash to
your stereo, you can record your system's analog audio output in MP3
format. Once those formerly protected tracks are in the RipFlash, you
can move them to a PC--and, yes, swap them on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Audio purists might argue that the RipFlash's MP3 tracks are a
generation away from the original, since they aren't created directly
from the digital data on the CD. Who cares? MP3 compression results
in audio degradation anyway. A track recorded using the RipFlash
still sounds better than an audiocassette version of the same track.</TE>
<TE>   The RipFlash includes software for Windows PCs only. The device
doesn't work with the Mac operating system, although I did use it
successfully with Connectix Corp.'s VirtualPC, which lets Macs run
Microsoft Corp.'s Windows.</TE>
<TE>   The RipFlash wasn't designed to bypass music-protection schemes.
It's simply a tiny audio recorder that happens to record in MP3
format. But the fact that it can be used to circumvent protection
technologies illustrates the futility of copy protection. This rave
isn't over yet.</TE>

<HD>Compaq Combo</HD>
<DH>CEO sees a strong future in partnership as the industry
shifts to standardization.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's been a rocky year for Michael Capellas, the affable 47-year-old
chief executive of Compaq Computer Corp.</LD>
<LD>   A week after Compaq announced plans to merge with Hewlett-Packard
Co. in order to better weather the biggest downturn in the computer
industry, terrorists struck Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   Business spending on technology, already reduced, virtually ground
to a halt. A brutal price war with Dell Computer Corp. left Compaq
battered. The Houston computer company emerged from 2001 with a 21%
drop in sales and a record $785-million loss.</LD>
<TE>   Capellas, blind in one eye since childhood, is used to adversity.
When told he was too scrawny to be a linebacker for his high school
football team in Warren, Ohio, Capellas trained until he became not
only the team's linebacker but also its co-captain.</TE>
<TE>   Now Capellas heads a company considered the junior partner in a
hotly contested $22-billion merger whose fate will be decided this
week by shareholder vote.</TE>
<TE>   Question: Make the case for why HP and Compaq should merge.</TE>
<TE>   Answer: The market has shifted. Customers are now looking for
partners who can survive. They want fewer strategic partners, and
they want partners who can serve them from end to end.</TE>
<TE>   The second part of that equation is that we know that the industry
is moving to build things using more standard building blocks.
Standard microprocessors, standard operating systems.</TE>
<TE>   The enterprise market is made of six building blocks. We're very
strong in three. They're very strong in three. It happened to not be
the same three. So you have an almost perfect complementary fit.</TE>
<TE>   Compaq is very strong in fault-tolerant supercomputing. HP is very
good in the data center. Compaq is extremely strong in
industry-standard servers. Compaq has the No. 1 market share position
in storage. HP has got a full offering in management software. Compaq
has not traditionally played there.</TE>
<TE>   So if you look at being able to create a complete enterprise play
that can run against IBM, there is no other combination in the
marketplace.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: What's the future of the PC industry?</TE>
<TE>   A: I personally am absolutely bullish on the personal computer
space, and I think the market is being incredibly shortsighted.</TE>
<TE>   We are, in fact, at the end of a three-year period of hyper-growth
in the business. As we go through the readjustment of the whole
Internet space, we are at a low period. But that does not talk about
future demand.</TE>
<TE>   So, point No. 1 is that people will continue to find new and
innovative uses for the Internet. That will happen and it will be
illogical to think otherwise, particularly as we stream more content
up there. Two, the Internet will reach more and more countries. So
there will be a global expansion in Internet access.</TE>
<TE>   We used to think about putting complex devices in businesses and
simple devices at home. Then the pattern turned. Commercial users are
now looking for simpler devices and ease of manageability. For the
consumer, there is the integration of the Internet with the next
generation of content, with music being the killer content. We will
stream video into all kinds of devices, from cellular phones to
automobiles.</TE>
<TE>   So, simple devices at work. Very rich, media-intensive devices in
the home. The PC becoming the center of education, becoming the
center of home entertainment. It's all about the next generation of
Internet access.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: What kind of growth do you see in the PC business this year?</TE>
<TE>   A: Even in a down market like this year, you'll probably see a 10%
growth in units. And you'll get strong double-digit growth over the
next five years.</TE>
<TE>   The interesting question is: What are we going to call a PC? When
you have a jukebox at home that stores all your music and connects to
the Internet, is that a PC? When you have a navigation system in your
car that has content streaming into it, is that a personal computer?
When your telephone has multiple functions, is that personal
computing?</TE>
<TE>   If you view the business as a simple PC beige box business, then
it's a pretty stable business. If you view it as all the
next-generation devices being the reception points of new forms of
data with new forms of audio streaming and video streaming, then it's
actually a business that will have at least one more wave and
probably more.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: What will happen if the merger is called off?</TE>
<TE>   A: We have not backed off an inch in doing the structural programs
that we set out to do to improve our basic business model. We've done
a really good job in redefining our distribution business, reducing
inventories, building product road maps for industry-standard servers
and storage. These are the two fastest-growing segments of the
information technology industry.</TE>
<TE>   We've taken tremendous pains to take our cost structure down. We
took out over 9,500 jobs last year, which means we went into this
year with a much more competitive cost structure. We believe the
future of the PC business is a pretty exciting business, but it's got
to go through a transformation, and we can absolutely be one of the
lead players in it.</TE>
<TE>   But we also know we have some more work to do. So our task is to
build on those pillars of fault-tolerant computing, industry-standard
computing, next-generation Internet access. We are either No. 1 or
No. 2 in every market we participate in.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Several institutional investors have said they will vote
against the merger because they believe it will distract the two
companies from their core businesses. Can you rebut?</TE>
<TE>   A: We all know that whenever you go through mergers you have to
act quickly and there is a period of distraction. We also know that
this whole industry is going to go through an unbelievable
transformation, and even individual companies that aren't going
through mergers are going to have to remake themselves.</TE>
<TE>   And so there's no question that there will be a period of time
where we will have to work hard at some merger activities. These
include things like completely rethinking our product road map, which
everybody needs to be doing regardless of whether they are doing a
merger. They are things like reducing our cost base, which everybody
needs to be doing. And they are things like reacting to customers who
have very different buying patterns, which everybody needs to be
doing.</TE>
<TE>   Am I going to oversimplify the fact that mergers are not tough?
Absolutely not. They are tough. But whenever you do anything to
really change the game, you go through a few changes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: How do you deal with the perception that Compaq is being
swallowed by a larger company and will lose out in the integration
process?</TE>
<TE>   A: We went into this from Day 1 with it being a 60-40 merger. But
when you get down to it, people will be judged by their merits. This
is a very strong-willed group of people. Both companies are going to
end up having market leadership in virtually every important function
of the IT business.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the day, you're talking in excess of an $85-billion
company. We are going to create more opportunities. So you're looking
at the opportunity. There are no shortages of opportunity for good
people. It's an opportunity for really good people to shine.
Obviously, there will be hard decisions to be made, but I think the
company will be well represented. I worry about a lot of things, but
that's not one of them.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: What does keep you up at night?</TE>
<TE>   A: The general economy. It's tough to go into a merger when there
is still a huge uncertainty about where in fact the economy is going.</TE>
<TE>   I worry about the customer reaction. You can't ignore the fact
that there is a very difficult proxy fight.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody entered into this anticipating it. Obviously, it came as a
surprise and late in the game. I worry about the effects of a
prolonged proxy fight on our customers and on our employees.</TE>
<TE>   This is a very resilient organization, but there's no question
that this has been very difficult on people. I worry about what that
means. A lot of energy has been spent on a proxy fight that we could
have spent on market strategy, and I am somewhat concerned about
that.</TE>

<HD>Verizon, Cingular to Offer New Internet Services</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>BEDMINSTER, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Verizon Wireless Inc. and Cingular Wireless, the two largest U.S.
mobile-phone companies, plan new fast Internet and
phone-personalization services, aimed at attracting more customers
and boosting sales to current subscribers.</LD>
<LD>   Verizon, starting today in San Diego, will begin letting customers
install games, ring tones and other programs using software from
Qualcomm Inc. The service will be offered nationwide starting in May.
Customers will pay for programs they download on a per-use or
per-month basis.</LD>
<LD>   By the end of June, Cingular will expand fast Web access, known as
general packet radio service, to California and New York. The service
is now offered in Seattle, Las Vegas and areas of Tennessee, Georgia
and the Carolinas. By year-end, it will be available in seven more
cities, as well as in Connecticut, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin
Islands.</LD>
<TE>   Verizon Wireless now offers fast Internet service on the East and
West coasts. The company and its rivals Sprint PCS Group and AT&amp;T
Wireless Services Inc. expect that as Web access speeds improve,
customers will use their mobile phones more often for e-mail,
entertainment and tapping into corporate databases. As users spend
more time online, transmitting information, listening to music and
exchanging messages, monthly bills will rise.</TE>
<TE>   Persuading users who normally browse the Web on large, color
computer monitors to do the same on small, black-and-white telephone
screens will be a challenge for carriers, said Ken Hyers, a senior
analyst at In-Stat/MDR.</TE>
<TE>   "In the U.S., a wireless phone is something that you use to call
somebody, nothing more," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Phones with color screens and the ability to receive graphics,
custom screen savers and ring tones will be critical to adoption of
the new messaging and Internet-based services Verizon Wireless and
Cingular are introducing, said Dylan Brooks, senior analyst at
Jupiter Media Metrix.</TE>
<TE>   Customers who want to use the Verizon service will need a new
phone from Kyocera Corp. or Sharp Corp. The Sharp phone has a color
display.</TE>
<TE>   The Qualcomm software enables Verizon Wireless customers to browse
an online mall, buying entertainment services, games and other
content by pressing keys on their phones. Programs are transmitted
and installed on users' phones over the air, and minutes spent
retrieving programs are deducted from subscribers' monthly buckets.</TE>
<TE>   Qualcomm's technology also makes software programs compatible with
multiple phones and operating systems, eliminating the need for
developers to write more than one version of a game or application.</TE>
<TE>   Cingular will continue upgrading its network after the transition
to general packet radio service is complete, with work beginning in
the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Verizon Wireless is a venture of Verizon Communications Inc.,
based in New York, and Britain's Vodafone Group. Cingular, based in
Atlanta, is a venture of BellSouth Corp. and SBC Communications Inc.</TE>

<HD>Why Your Vote Often Means So Little</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSS K. BAKER</AU>
<BD>Ross K. Baker is a political science professor at
Rutgers University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was once a region of the country known as the "Solid South," a
vast quadrant that stretched roughly from the Potomac to the Rio
Grande, in which Republican members of Congress were as scarce as
polar bears.</LD>
<LD>   The legacy of the Civil War and the residual loathing of
Republicans who were the party of the victorious North produced
elections in which the real contests took place in the primaries, and
Democratic incumbents were reelected with monotonous regularity.</LD>
<LD>   So reliably safe were Democratic seats in Congress that the
party's Southern incumbents amassed the years of seniority that
conferred on them the powerful committee chairmanships.</LD>
<TE>   Now incumbency has become so entrenched in the two major parties
and in all quarters of the country that many voters lack any real say
in who represents them. Democratic and Republican House incumbents
alike share a semi- perpetual easement on their seats that more
nearly resembles hereditary entitlement than the competitive politics
we associate with a democracy.</TE>
<TE>   How did this happen? Blame redistricting, the process by which
politicians carve up territory in response to the rise, fall or
redistribution of their population as reported by the census.</TE>
<TE>   And don't expect any changes with the current redistricting, which
is almost complete. By some estimates, fewer than 10% of the 435
House seats will end up fostering competitive elections.</TE>
<TE>   In each of the 50 states, elected politicians can be trusted to
put themselves first. In census after census, roughly 90% of all
House seats end up so strongly Democratic or Republican that any
challenge from the opposing party is largely futile.</TE>
<TE>   For example, this year in California, a state with 53 House seats,
only one--the seat now occupied by Rep. Gary Condit, who lost the
Democratic primary--is deemed competitive. The influential Cook
Political Report, which tracks congressional races, estimates that
nationally only 55 House seats are in play, a number the report says
will almost certainly decrease by election day.</TE>
<TE>   This anemic level of party competition does not stop incumbent
House members from furiously raking in campaign contributions. The
combination of favorable redistricting for those currently holding
seats in the House and their nonstop fund-raising contributes to what
has come to be known as "the incumbent advantage."</TE>
<TE>   That is quite some understatement.</TE>
<TE>   I have nothing against incumbents. Among them are some of the
ablest and most admirable individuals in public life.</TE>
<TE>   But deprived of occasional challenge and competition, even those
who walk in the footsteps of Henry Clay and Daniel Webster can come
to view their jobs as an inalienable birthright.</TE>
<TE>   The hyper-empowerment of incumbents renders the candidates who
challenge them among the most pitiable figures in American politics,
unless they are possessed of unlimited personal wealth or incredible
luck.</TE>
<TE>   Even those attributes may be insufficient to dislodge
well-entrenched incumbents whose party claims the lion's share of a
district's voters.</TE>
<TE>   This year, because both parties are so evenly divided--Republicans
in the House outnumber Democrats by only 11--the fall elections
promise to produce a stalemate.</TE>
<TE>   Both political parties will pour vast sums of money into the tiny
minority of House races in which there is a real contest, and the
2002 congressional elections will come to resemble the bloody battle
on the Western Front in World War I, where hundreds of thousands of
troops slugged it out in the trenches with a net gain of territory
measured in yards.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the squandering of treasure on these few competitive seats is
the least of the unfortunate results of the redistricting.</TE>
<TE>   The severest toll is taken by the political system itself. In a
district where the incumbent is endowed with a hefty partisan
majority, a substantial number of voters of the other party are
effectively disenfranchised.</TE>
<TE>   The rotation in office that Andrew Jackson defined as a central
element in a democracy should come about through elections.</TE>
<TE>   That so many of those elections have become mere formalities does
us little credit and promotes a passive and apathetic citizenry.</TE>

<HD>New Nuclear Policy Makes for a Safer World</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARRY M. BLECHMAN</AU>
<BD>Barry M. Blechman was assistant director of the U.S.
Arms Control and Disarmament Agency from 1977 to 1980.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush administration's new nuclear policy has received a great
deal of criticism over its suggestion that U.S. nuclear weapons play
a role in deterring hostile nations that don't possess nuclear
weapons but are armed with other kinds of weapons of mass
destruction.</LD>
<LD>   The criticism--that the new policy lowers the bar for use of
nuclear weapons--is misplaced. In fact, by linking U.S. nuclear and
conventional precision strike capabilities, the policy narrows the
role of nuclear weapons in U.S. defense policy, reduces the
circumstances in which they might be used and sets the stage for even
deeper cuts in nuclear forces.</LD>
<LD>   The planned reduction in nuclear warheads deployed with
operational submarines, bombers and land-based missiles--from about
6,000 to between 1,700 and 2,200--is quite an accomplishment. It will
decrease the cumulative risk of technical mishaps and unauthorized or
inadvertent launches, and it should reassure the Russians politically
by moving the U.S. to a force level that Russia appears to be seeking
itself.</LD>
<TE>   Critics of the new policy have complained that many of the
warheads coming off U.S. forces will be placed in reserve rather than
dismantled immediately. Getting 4,000 warheads off alert is very
important in its own right. It would take time to put the weapons
back on missiles or into active bomber inventories. Given the
international furor that would accompany such a move, no president
would take it without very serious reason.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, having the option to beef up U.S. forces is only
sensible given the uncertainties of world events. As Secretary of
Defense Donald Rumsfeld has said, when it comes to international
threats "the only surprise is that we're surprised when we're
surprised."</TE>
<TE>   Weapon and stockpile requirements are reviewed periodically. If
international developments continue favorably, either further
reductions in operational weapons or the destruction of stockpiled
weapons would certainly be possible.</TE>
<TE>   The new policy recognizes that Russia is no longer our enemy, and
there is no longer a need to plan for massive attacks against that
nation. It would move the U.S. away from a single, integrated
operational plan for nuclear attacks to "capabilities-based
targeting." Instead of massive, society-destroying nuclear strikes,
the U.S. would plan to have capabilities to conduct limited nuclear
strikes aimed at specific objectives. In its classified form, the
policy mentioned nations for which planners need to prepare such
options, causing a furor. The only thing new here from previous
administrations is that the names of the nations leaked out.</TE>
<TE>   In its most important development, the new defense policy pairs
U.S. nuclear forces with precise, conventional strike capabilities.
In this formulation, the new policy greatly circumscribes the
potential role of nuclear weapons. Recognizing the immense
capabilities of modern aircraft and missiles armed with conventional
weapons, the new policy implies that for the first time in 50 years
the U.S. may not have to respond to nuclear threats in kind. We may
be able to defeat such threats by attacking enemies with conventional
weapons, relying on missile defenses to stop any threatening forces
that survive. This is a huge change in thinking, allowing for even
more nuclear-force reductions as conventional strike and missile
defense capabilities advance.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials have a way to go before the new policy is
fulfilled. They have to work closely with the U.S. Strategic Command
to ensure that the planned changes in targeting are implemented
properly. The nuclear departures of more than one previous
administration have been thwarted in their implementation phase. And
the administration will have to move expeditiously to set in place
the transparency measures and other arrangements to reassure the
Russians and others that the shift from negotiated arms control
agreements to unilateral reductions in forces is not a subterfuge.</TE>
<TE>   These steps notwithstanding, the new policy is a major
accomplishment and an important advance toward ending nuclear
dangers.</TE>

<HD>Indian Tribes Win the Jackpot in Campaign Finance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED DICKEY</AU>
<BD>Fred Dickey is a journalist in Southern California who
has written extensively on this issue.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Voters hoping for federal campaign finance reform need to be leery of
two groups of politicians: those opposing reform and those favoring
it. Those pushing for greater fairness in elections mainly want it
for the other guy.</LD>
<LD>   John McCain comes to mind. An icon of rectitude to those who
follow him on cleaning up elections, he is also the main protector of
one of the most voracious buyers of congressional influence: the
casino-operating Indian tribes. Why? One possibility: In 2000 he
received $42,900 from gambling tribes--almost twice that of the
next-highest recipient--while serving as chair of the Indian Affairs
Committee in the Senate.</LD>
<LD>   Political influence of the tribes nationwide has grown enormously
since casino doors were opened wide by the Cabazon court case in 1987
and the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988.</LD>
<TE>   In May 2000, the Federal Election Commission ruled that tribes are
limited to contributions of $1,000 per candidate per election--which
seems like a fair limit on "hard money," i.e. money that can be given
to individual candidates. But the FEC, in a ruling that makes one
want to seek logic therapy for bureaucrats, also did not impose a
ceiling on how much the tribes could give.</TE>
<TE>   That means that every tribe in the U.S.--and there are 556 of
them--can give $1,000 to every candidate for all 535 House and Senate
seats. For two-candidate races in the general election, for example,
that adds up to more than $1 million per tribe. The tribes' combined
contribution power is almost $600 million.</TE>
<TE>   That is a hammer no sensible politician who might think of
opposing the tribes would want to be hit with. If, for example, a
lawmaker voted against gambling interests, a large group of tribes
could combine to drown his or her career in a river of cash.</TE>
<TE>   Under the "reform" legislation that is expected to gain final
passage this week, that rule will remain in place, except that the
$1,000-per-candidate amount will double to $2,000.</TE>
<TE>   Campaign finance reform was promoted to honestly address
unfairness in campaign spending so that no special interest could
"buy" legislative favor. Today there are few special interests richer
than the gambling tribes. They have spread casinos across the nation
that generate an estimated $12 billion annually. And they have a
great motive to spend wildly to influence lawmakers because the
tax-free monopolies many enjoy and the regulations under which they
operate depend on favors from Congress.</TE>
<TE>   The rules on tribes are different from those on groups such as
Planned Parenthood or the National Rifle Assn., which organize
political action committees dependent on personal donations from
constituents under tight regulations. Tribes, however, can fall back
on their treasury for contributions. Some of that money can originate
from federal funds channeled to them. In other words, they can
convert tax dollars to political contributions. But the serious money
comes from casino profits. This means that individuals and groups
seeking to oppose the expansion of casinos must do so with one hand
tied by laws that severely limit what they can spend.</TE>
<TE>   California now has 46 casinos and 16 on the way. Nationally, there
are 289. During the 1994 election cycle, gambling tribes gave more
than $600,000 to federal candidates and political parties. In 1996
they gave close to $2 million and during 2000 nearly $3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Tribes also are increasing pressure to annex urban land to
reservations to locate new casinos closer to the hubs of cities.
Throughout California, disputes are breaking out as counties and
citizens living close to reservations protest the environmental and
infrastructure strains caused by high-traffic casinos. But Congress
has made it the law that the tribes cannot be sued or held
accountable for damages.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer told the National
Congress of American Indians that, in view of some recent court cases
that have gone against the tribes, their best course of action would
be to seek legislative help from Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Breyer had it right. If tribes want to continue with the
under-regulated, tax-exempt ka-ching machines that casinos represent,
it will mean bending Congress in their favor, and money will always
make that happen.</TE>
<TE>   If those who would oppose them are handicapped by provisions
ignored by the proposed campaign finance reform, then those opponents
will have the same chance of prevailing as they have of winning a
slot machine jackpot.</TE>

<LD>Just how dumb do they think Americans are, these U.S. senators who
voted against a major energy security measure on the pretense of
protecting soccer moms and preserving the pickup truck? Do these
leaders, Democrats and Republicans, want us to believe that making a
sport-utility vehicle get more miles per gallon would force mothers
to drive their shin-guard-clad darlings around in golf carts? That
fuel-efficient pickups would endanger the family farm?</LD>
<LD>   The Democrats bear much of the blame, both because they control
the Senate and because they are usually the first to brag of their
support for the environment. Nineteen Democrats from auto-producing
or farm states joined the GOP in rejecting the measure by Sens. John
F. Kerry (D-Mass.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) to raise the average
auto fleet mileage standard to 35 miles per gallon by 2015, saving a
million barrels of oil a day. They voted instead to let the
Department of Transportation set new standards in the future--as if
that will happen.</LD>
<TE>   The current standard for autos is 27.5 mpg but only 20.7 mpg for
light trucks, a category that includes SUVs. The auto makers and
industry labor unions claimed that higher standards would keep them
from making safe vehicles and put hundreds of thousands out of work.
These are the same arguments that were mounted in 1975 when mileage
standards were imposed and 15 years ago when they were increased.
They were wrong then and are wrong now. What is surprising is that so
many lawmakers should reiterate such nonsense on the Senate floor.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Christopher Bond (R-Mo.) actually said, "I don't want to tell
a mom in my state she should not get an SUV because Congress decided
that would be a bad choice." And Sen. Zell Miller (D-Ga.) said his
successful move to exempt pickup trucks from future mileage standard
increases was a vote for "the working man . . . a vote for rural
America."</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, both
California Democrats, didn't buy those lines and supported Kerry and
McCain. Alas, Wednesday's follies may even be outdone soon when the
Senate is told that the real path to American energy independence is
drilling for oil in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Expect
someone to say it's all for the sake of the caribou.</TE>

<LD>The Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, passed by Congress
in 1987, governs how Washington doles out more than $1 billion each
year to local groups helping the indigent. Last month, the Bush
administration suggested that the focus of the act be narrowed to a
sharply defined population: the people who chronically live on city
and suburban sidewalks, under bridges and in temporary shelters, most
of whom suffer from mental illnesses, drug addictions or both. Last
week the administration put a deadline on moving these people off the
streets and into productive lives: 10 years. It's a noble goal and it
can be met.</LD>
<LD>   In a reflection of the bitter political infighting that keeps so
many of this nation's streets looking like open-air asylums, the
National Coalition on Homelessness dismissed the administration's
policy as "misguided'' for failing to portray homelessness "as
primarily an economic condition, not a medical condition." It is
certainly true that in this rich nation there are far too many poor
people for whom decent housing is all but impossible to find. But
today, when budget deficits are leading states to slash social
services, the McKinney Act simply cannot afford to cure all social
ills. The coalition should keep fighting for money to build housing
for poor people, but the administration should reject its insistence
that the McKinney Act provide the bankroll.</LD>
<TE>   When people are allowed to stake out public sidewalks as places to
sleep, smoke crack and scream at imagined demons, communities'
resolve turns to hopelessness. The cynicism that follows can infect a
nation. The Bush administration's still-fresh resolve is evidenced in
its appointment of Philip Mangano, a 54-year-old former Hollywood
music executive, to coordinate initiatives now strewn across 15
federal agencies. If Mangano is as smart as his record as an advocate
for the homeless in Massachusetts suggests, he'll find plenty of
places to trim wasted cash and bureaucracy. He'll also see that it
would be a mistake to fix parts of the McKinney Act that aren't
broken.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, officials of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, which oversees implementation of the act, argue that
they should concentrate only on their "core mission": housing. But
studies have shown that the act is successful--and
economical--precisely because it offers not just a bed but
counseling, job training and other "supportive services" that can
help people stay off the streets.</TE>
<TE>   Also questionable is the administration's suggestion that money be
distributed not to agencies that have proved themselves effective, as
is now the case, but be based on an area's average income. Santa
Monica, with lots of rich people to balance out its penniless street
dwellers, could suffer. And money meant to move mentally ill or
substance-abusing people into apartments and jobs could get diverted
by small-town politicians obsessed with potholes.</TE>
<TE>   The term "homeless" has grown so fuzzy that it might as well be
scrapped. But the McKinney Act's original vision of easing people off
the street and into productive lives by encouraging self-sufficiency
has never been more important.</TE>

<LD>The Los Angeles Unified School District does not have $6.3 million to
throw around. Yet that appears to be just what the school board did
last week when it awarded a $6.3-million adult literacy contract to a
start-up company with little more to recommend it than a tie to state
Sen. Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles).</LD>
<LD>   As it turns out, some board members said they thought that Reality
Based Learning of California was the same company as Reality Based
Learning of Redmond, Wash., a firm with an established record in
elementary literacy. The company the board voted for is instead a
different company that has a mailing address at the Los Angeles law
office of J. Arnoldo Beltran, a Polanco ally.</LD>
<LD>   The vote may not stand because during the school board meeting
Polanco said he had spoken individually to board members. That
prompted a lawyer for the district to raise the possibility of a
violation of the state law governing public meetings and advise the
board to postpone action. It didn't, and now the LAUSD inspector
general, Don Mullinax, has been asked to investigate. Good.</LD>
<TE>   Supt. Roy Romer insists that the LAUSD has turned a corner and
cites the thorough checks and balances added by the board to ensure
that the Belmont Learning Complex is completed and operated safely at
a reasonable cost. The board did not apply that same thoroughness
before its vote on Polanco's pitch.</TE>
<TE>   Now members say they were misled and are likely to overturn the
decision Tuesday. They shouldn't have made it in the first place.
Such shenanigans certainly do not shore up confidence that the
district has broken from its bad old days of you-scratch-my-back,
I'll-scratch-yours.</TE>

<LD>Re "Biology Class Rite Hits a Nerve," March 13: C.S. Lewis states:
"In justifying cruelty to animals, we put ourselves also on the
animal level. We choose the jungle and must abide by our choice." It
is an outrage that schools are rushing into the jungle by
reintroducing the dissection of mammals, despite the availability of
software programs that far more effectively teach the very objectives
in biology that the archaic dissection method used to teach. I firmly
agree with Dr. Jerry Vlasak's statement: "No surgeon in this country
learns how to be a surgeon by dissecting animals." A good doctor is
first and foremost compassionate.</LD>
<LD>   Dissection and vivisection tend to enable students to be anything
but! Lewis calls the Darwinian approach that humans are superior to
all other forms of life a sentiment and challenges: "Try to base it
on logic and see what happens!"</LD>
<LD>   Worst of all, dissection and vivisection keep deserving students
out of the biology class because either they or their parents are
morally opposed to dissection. Please help inspire our students
wishing to become doctors to be compassionate and logical by keeping
dissection and vivisection out of our school and college curricula,
both public and private.</LD>

<LD>As a parent of two small children, I was truly saddened by the death
of the two young girls in Anaheim struck by a car in front of their
elementary school (March 13). This could have been my son's school.
Every morning I witness dangerous situations between cars and
children that have the potential for the same tragedy.</LD>
<LD>   I regularly see parents double-parking and dropping off their
children in the middle of the street to cross, cars running through
stop signs and crosswalks being completely disregarded. I have
brought these issues up to the principal several times and have yet
to see any resolution. It's time that school officials become more
proactive to assure the safety of our children and work with local
officials to resolve this problem. Without immediate action, it is
not a question of if more children will be hurt or killed, it is a
question of when.</LD>

<TE>   I am a parent of school-age children who is increasingly concerned
about my children's safety at our public schools. When we drop off or
pick up our children there are hundreds of parents doing the same
thing. Usually we fight for the few spots that are available; some
parents double-park or let their children run between cars.</TE>
<TE>   Something has to be done before more children are injured. I have
repeatedly suggested a simple solution: Tiering the school beginning
and ending times. Grades K-3: start at 8 a.m., end at 2 p.m. Grades
4-6: start at 8:15 a.m., end at 2:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Spend a few hours at a local elementary school at the dismissal
bell and you would be shocked at the seriousness of this problem.
Please, no more children dying for just attending classes at our
public schools. We have got to act!</TE>

<TE>   Six hundred seventy-five children dead, 20,000 injured nationally
in pedestrian incidents each year (March 14). Many of these accidents
happen when kids are going to and from schools. Please, let's look at
these sad facts and do something effective to stop these deaths and
injuries.</TE>
<TE>   One suggestion I have is to train and assign parking police to
each school. Use them as crossing guards during pick-up and drop-off
times. Allow them to ticket the parents double-parked dropping off
kids. Their presence in uniform would probably remind drivers not to
speed through school zones. Most communities have parking enforcement
police working right in the neighborhood. Would this help save lives?
Help law enforcement's public image? I think so.</TE>

<LD>Re "Oil Doesn't Grow on Trees," Commentary, March 14: David Goodstein
argues that the best reason to cut fossil fuel use and replace it
with renewable energy sources is that we are fast running out of oil.
But Goodstein ignores the fact that new technology is constantly
improving our ability to find and extract oil.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, the best reason to take the path Goodstein advocates is
that the environmental consequences of burning fossil fuels are so
dire--ecological degradation associated with extraction (hence the
debate over near-shore and Arctic drilling), ground-level air
pollution and, most important, the link between carbon dioxide
emissions and global warming.</LD>
<LD>   Even forward-looking energy companies realize that the era of
fossil fuels is coming to an end, not because they can't find more
oil and natural gas but because they realize society can no longer
tolerate the downwind price.</LD>

<TE>   Goodstein's article on our running out of oil sooner rather than
later is one of many on the subject. One can imagine that at the
present rate of consumption that day is indeed sooner.</TE>
<TE>   The front page of this same edition reports "Senate Kills Stiffer
Fuel Standards." Energy proposals being kicked around by lawmakers
tend to favor greater consumption. Didn't Vice President Cheney say
last November that "conservation may be a sign of personal virtue"?
Our leaders certainly must be privy to data that tell them of the
disappearing oil supply. The Senate vote leans on the side of the
auto and oil industries and ignores the problem of eventual oil
depletion. Selfishness and greed are alive and well in America with
the aid of our government. The sad thing is they don't appear to care
about the future. Go tell that to the children.</TE>

<TE>   As the Senate votes down higher fuel-efficiency standards for
vehicles, we again hear the political mantra from Sen. Christopher S.
Bond (R-Mo.): "I don't want to tell a mom in my state she should not
get an SUV because Congress decided that would be a bad choice."</TE>
<TE>   Looking on the streets of L.A. and vicinity for the mythic SUV
soccer mom and her five kids, I found that about nine-tenths of the
SUVs had one person per vehicle and almost all of the rest had two.
One SUV was full--of teenagers at the beach. Yet I have never heard a
politician say, "I don't want to tell a surfer dude in my state. . .
. "</TE>
<TE>   The most common motive for buying an SUV is not room or safety but
lifestyle faddishness. If motor scooters became as trendy, we'd find
our beloved soccer mom putt-putting along with her brood piled up
behind her like an acrobatic troupe.</TE>
<TE>   David Eggenschwiler</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   How can our senators purport to want to reduce America's
dependence on foreign oil and yet fail to impose higher fuel economy
standards? They, in complicity with the White House, have
successfully and severely undermined the U.S.'s only real potential
for oil independence, an independence that can come only in the form
of raising CAFE standards.</TE>
<TE>   While proponents of drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge insist on leeching 3.2-billion barrels of oil from ANWR's
permafrost, raising the fuel economy of cars, light trucks and SUVs
to 40 mpg would provide 2.5-billion barrels of oil a day, as much as
the U.S. imports from OPEC. Our Senate has bowed to the wanton,
selfish interests of the auto industry and turned a blind eye to the
real problem.</TE>

<LD>I applaud City Controller Laura Chick's scrutiny of the Department of
Water and Power's bills ("Controller Rejects DWP Bills as
Extravagant," March 14). But it's troublesome to think that some
independent caterer who accepted the DWP as a client is losing money
that is legitimately owed. Pay the bill for services rendered but
dock the paychecks of those involved at the DWP to cover it. By not
paying the bill, the DWP isn't suffering, but you sure are harming
the vendor who contracted in good faith. That's simply bad business.</LD>

<HD>Nuclear Posture Review Blasts All Reason</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As a Vietnam combat veteran I'm disgusted that you gave one inch of
space to the immoral, lying architect of Lyndon Johnson's war effort
("A Pretty Poor Posture for a Superpower," Commentary, March 13).
While I was there (1966) we fought with both hands tied behind our
backs. We entered North Vietnamese airspace at the same time every
day, presumably to be sure they were ready for us.</LD>
<LD>   Robert McNamara kept us from destroying key targets--which helped
to prolong the war and ensure more needless American and South
Vietnamese deaths. He kept South Vietnam from even faking an invasion
of the North; thus the North Vietnamese could thrust all available
forces into the South with impunity.</LD>
<LD>   He and his virtual co-conspirators, Jane Fonda and Tom Hayden,
should all be in the dock for treason.</LD>
<TE>   Bill Spillane</TE>

<TE>   The thought of President Bush's new Nuclear Posture Review fills
me with so much more terror than the possibility of a terrorist
attack.</TE>
<TE>   Alison Broadbent</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   McNamara and Thomas Graham Jr. presciently note that if Bush and
his nuclear advocates are allowed to play out their game, "We will
live in a far more dangerous world, and the United States will be
much less secure."</TE>
<TE>   I would only add that it is becoming increasingly obvious that
this is precisely what Bush wants. Everything he does destabilizes
the economic, political and environmental equilibrium of the planet.
This administration moves us into a "fuzzy" World War III,
antagonizes the rest of the world and completely embarrasses the
sensible people of the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The only beneficiaries of these senseless acts are, at least in
the near term (the Bush myopic "vision" at its best), the far-right
wing, big business and Pentagon hawks. Perhaps Bush's assumption is
that there will be no tomorrow, so let's give today to the rich and
not worry about what comes next.</TE>

<HD>Clinton Administration Partners in Pardons</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Roger Clinton Said to Be Deeply Tied to Pardons," March 13: Wow.
After a full year's investigation, is this litany of innuendo and
suggestions the best that Bill Clinton attack dog Rep. Dan Burton
(R-Ind.) could come up with?</LD>
<LD>   The White House was besieged by pardon requests. Gasp! Clinton
made some bad decisions. Impeach him! Oh, wait, they already did
that. Former Deputy Atty. Gen Eric Holder denies that his desire to
be attorney general was connected to his involvement in the [fugitive
financier Marc] Rich pardon. But Burton states this incentive is
"more believable" than what Holder is offering. Whew! That would
certainly stand up in a court of law.</LD>
<LD>   Rita Lavelle, a former Reagan administration Environmental
Protection Agency official, testifies that Roger Clinton tried to get
her to cough up big bucks in exchange for a pardon. Oh, she was
convicted of perjury in the 1980s.</LD>
<TE>   Finally, there's proof that thorn-in-their-siblings' sides Roger
Clinton and Hugh Rodham used their relationship to Bill Clinton to
their advantage. George W. has been been to Florida numerous times
since his inauguration to lobby for his brother Jeb on the taxpayers'
dime.</TE>

<HD>Conejo Students Lend Their Ears to Bard's Works</HD>
<DH>Arts: Touring program brings Shakespeare to elementary
grades. Sessions include a performance staged by professional actors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZIE ST. JOHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's not every day that fifth-graders shout "thou," "thee" or
"beseech" during class, but at Westlake Elementary School the subject
was William Shakespeare and his plays.</LD>
<LD>   Professional actors Kevin Moran and Anne Patrichio asked about the
playwright's distinctive language last week as part of a workshop for
kindergarten through fifth-grade students who were studying
Elizabethan England as part of the Shakespeare Educational Tour.</LD>
<LD>   For the third year, Kingsmen Shakespeare Company and the Thousand
Oaks Arts Commission have brought the Bard's works into the
classrooms of the Conejo Valley Unified School District.</LD>
<TE>   During this three-week tour, Moran, Patrichio and four other
thespians are spending their mornings at 16 elementary schools giving
20- to 45-minute workshops in classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Students learn about the history of Shakespeare and perform scenes
from his plays. After lunch, the actors perform an original play
featuring scenes from various works of Shakespeare for an assembly of
third- through fifth-graders. The children get involved by performing
sound effects, such as a woman crying or the din of thunder and
lightning.</TE>
<TE>   "The students love it," said fifth-grade teacher Sue Boyce. "It's
not that they become experts on Shakespeare, but it exposes them to
him."</TE>
<TE>   One goal of the tour, which ends Tuesday, is to make Shakespeare
less intimidating by studying the author before students develop
preconceived notions about how difficult it is to understand his
writing.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the time to do it because kids this age don't have any
inhibitions," said Michael Arndt, co-founder and artistic director of
the Kingsmen Shakespeare Company.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven-year-old Caitlyn Christensen said the workshop made her
want to study more of the Bard's plays.</TE>
<TE>   "I really liked learning about the language he used," said
Caitlyn, who played the parts of Viola and Cesario in scenes from
"Twelfth Night."</TE>
<TE>   Justin Rosenberg, 11, added that he enjoyed learning about the
different themes of love, comedy and drama.</TE>
<TE>   The educational tour was the brainchild of Arndt; associate
artistic director Lane Davies, the company's other founder; and
Thousand Oaks Arts Commission member Patrick McMinn.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the community's growing interest in the theater troupe's
annual performances at California Lutheran University and the
Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza, the trio devised the educational tour
as a way to bring the Bard's works to another audience.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually it's the art programs that are the first to be cut from
schools because they are considered frills. With this program it is
integrated into the regular curriculum," McMinn said. "The great
thing about this program is that there are a number of disciplines to
come out of it, like poetry, history and literature."</TE>
<TE>   To prepare for the workshop and assembly, students studied
Shakespeare several weeks before the tour reached their school.</TE>
<TE>   Arndt said district schools are asked in September whether they
want to participate. The cost is $1,000 per school, with the Thousand
Oaks Art Commission and Kingsmen Shakespeare Company each
contributing $6,000 to cover the production costs.</TE>
<TE>   Though the program is only offered to Conejo Valley Unified
schools, Arndt and McMinn want to expand it to other districts.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a very unique situation here," said Arndt, who has taught
drama at Cal Lutheran for 20 years. "In England it's the norm to
study Shakespeare from a young age. We hope this program will instill
that same interest."</TE>

<HD>For Bianca, 7: 'See You in Heaven'</HD>
<DH>Grief: More than 200 attend memorial service for one of two
girls crushed by a car at their Anaheim school.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 200 friends and relatives paid their respects Sunday to
little Bianca Perez, 7, one of two girls who were killed last week in
front of their Anaheim elementary school when a car jumped a curb and
pinned them against a wall.</LD>
<LD>   "This was our chance to say goodbye and support the family," said
Centralia Elementary Principal Cindy Chaffee, among those who
attended the memorial service at Victory Baptist Church in Anaheim.</LD>
<LD>   Anaheim police said the traffic investigation into what happened
may take weeks.</LD>
<TE>   They say they have no answers yet on how Maria Juarez, 50, of
Anaheim jumped the curb at a pick-up and drop-off zone, crushing
Bianca and first-grader Nidia "Liz" Curiel, 6, at the school Tuesday.
Police say they believe Juarez accidentally hit the gas pedal instead
of the brake.</TE>
<TE>   They are also investigating whether the vehicle had a mechanical
failure or whether Juarez was distracted just before the tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   At the service, the Rev. Win Boediarto spoke in English, which was
translated to Spanish for the ethnically mixed crowd. At one point, a
boy in a white shirt and dark slacks walked up to the podium and
handed one of the church leaders a note.</TE>
<TE>   Written in a child's scrawl, it sought permission for one of
Bianca's classmates, Edmund Levale, 7, to sing a hymn to her. But
first he asked a favor. "I have music sheets but I need your piano
player," the boy's note said.</TE>
<TE>   After someone stepped forward to accompany him on the piano,
Edmund leveraged all the courage he could and returned to the podium
with his grandmother, Anna Buttel, and one of her grandsons, Aaron
Uele, 11.</TE>
<TE>   "I live right across from the school where it happened," Buttel
said. "I heard the commotion and everything."</TE>
<TE>   She said she and her grandsons sing in the choir at their church
and left early Sunday to offer their respects to Edmund's classmate,
whom he liked a great deal. Midway through the hymn, Edmund was taken
with emotion as he used a shirt sleeve to wipe away tears.</TE>
<TE>   The title of the hymn, Buttel said, was "Where Is Heaven?"</TE>
<TE>   When they finished, everyone, including Bianca's parents, Alma and
Ramon Perez of Buena Park, who were in the first row, applauded.</TE>
<TE>   Those who knew Bianca say the little girl, with the dark bangs and
bright smile, seemed to make those around her happier.</TE>
<TE>   Bianca had transferred to Centralia from Fairhaven Elementary
School in Santa Ana a week before she was killed. Her second-grade
teacher from Fairhaven, Miranda Martinez, attended the service.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember Bianca's last day with us," Martinez said. "We were
reading on the lawn, and we had gotten pizza. This was such a shock.
When I heard about it, I thought, 'My Bianca.'"</TE>
<TE>   Jose Mora, a relative, said he sought solace by writing a poem for
Bianca, "Hermosa Florecita"--Beautiful Little Flower--which he shared
at the microphone.</TE>
<TE>   "Bianca loved being at church more than anything else," Mora said.
"Sometimes it takes a life to bring light into a dark world."</TE>
<TE>   The service included a multimedia program with pictures of Bianca
as an infant, then toddler, then young girl in a blue dress with a
pair of white barrettes in her hair. It ended with a simple sentence:
"See you in heaven."</TE>
<TE>   With that, the mourners filed out, many offering condolences to
the girl's parents. Then, Ramon Perez picked up the couple's other
daughter, Emily, 2, and with his wife followed the small, white
casket adorned with red, white and pink roses out of the church.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral services for Bianca are scheduled for today at 10 a.m. at
Hilgenfeld Mortuary in Anaheim. Burial will be at Forest Lawn
Memorial Park in Cypress.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service for Liz Curiel is scheduled for Tuesday at 9
a.m. at La Iglesia Luz del Mundo in Santa Ana.</TE>

<HD>Oversight Still Lacking in Donations of Bodies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DIRMANN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just months after a 1999 scandal at UC Irvine, where an employee
improperly dismembered and sold cadavers donated to the school,
legislators scrambled to halt the black market trade in body parts
for medical research.</LD>
<LD>   The state legislative analyst wrote in June 2000 that backers of a
bill by Assemblyman Ken Maddox (R-Garden Grove) believed it "restores
confidence in ... donor programs and ensures that no more grieving
families are exploited." Gov. Gray Davis signed the bill later that
year.</LD>
<LD>   But today, another scandal is unfolding involving the illegal sale
of body parts that highlights gaping holes that still exist in the
oversight of bodies willed to science. In a case so grisly it rivals
the one unfolding in Georgia, a Lake Elsinore man is accused of
dismembering at least 81 bodies left with him for cremation and
selling off the parts to medical schools.</LD>
<TE>   No agency is responsible for regulating so-called "willed-body"
programs run by colleges and medical research institutes to acquire
human bodies or body parts for dissection. Not the Department of
Consumer Affairs, which licenses crematories. Not even the Department
of Health Services. Instead, the programs run largely on the honor
system.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point in regulatory matters, you just have to rely on the
person doing the right thing," said Kevin Flanagan, spokesman for the
Cemetery and Funeral Services division of the Department of Consumer
Affairs.</TE>
<TE>   But many people with relatives whose bodies were treated
improperly say that's not good enough.</TE>
<TE>   "They inspect restaurants and make sure there aren't roaches or
things that can hurt the public," said Mike DiMeglio, whose
stepfather's remains were supposed to be cremated by Pacific
Cremation Care in Lake Elsinore but instead, investigators say, were
sold to research facilities. "Why aren't they out there inspecting
just as closely what's happening at these crematories? What does it
take to get their attention?"</TE>
<TE>   Lawmaker Says Laws Still Weak</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough), who lobbied to place
funeral home and cremation regulation under the jurisdiction of the
Department of Consumer Affairs in 1996, acknowledged the laws are
still weak.</TE>
<TE>   "We've done quite a bit already," Speier said. "But obviously,
there are still problems."</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Cremation Care owner Michael Brown had for years passed a
state review of his crematory, where inspectors made sure that ovens
reached proper temperatures and that a logbook of activity was being
kept. During a surprise inspection in September 2000, inspectors
found four minor violations and fined Brown $2,500.</TE>
<TE>   From the same site, Brown also ran Bio-Tech Anatomical, which
received and shipped out cadavers donated for science.</TE>
<TE>   After a former employee complained, investigators identified 81
bodies that they allege were illegally carved up for sale, earning
$365,000 from March 2000 to February 2001. Only a portion of the
bodies were actually cremated and returned to families, authorities
contend.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem was that [Brown sold] more body parts than were
donated," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Karen Gorham. "And if his business
had been properly monitored, that couldn't have happened."</TE>
<TE>   Brown has pleaded not guilty to 156 counts of embezzlement and
unlawful mutilation of human remains. If convicted, he faces 100
years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Released on $150,000 bail, Brown could not be reached, and his
lawyer did not return calls. Attorney Rick Layon has said Brown is
guilty of nothing more than poor record keeping.</TE>
<TE>   Investigation of the Lake Elsinore case "entailed hundreds of
interviews, hundreds of boxes of documents seized, and took hundreds
of hours to piece together," Gorham said.</TE>
<TE>   On March 2, 2001, investigators served a search warrant on the
business, seizing 74 cadavers, 128 body parts and more than 100 boxes
of office records.</TE>
<TE>   To sort through it all, investigators built a database to match
names with recovered body parts.</TE>
<TE>   The most difficult task, however, was the notification of family
members.</TE>
<TE>   Often, relatives were presented with Polaroid pictures and asked
to identify warts or moles on various body parts. Detectives, for
example, asked Mary Rodriguez to identify the severed head of her
stepfather, 66-year-old William Hillyer, a former San Diego resident.
Too distraught to handle the task, she deferred to her brother.</TE>
<TE>   "You just can't imagine how devastating this all is," Rodriguez
said. "You literally have to go through the grief process all over
again."</TE>
<TE>   "I feel so betrayed," said DiMeglio, whose stepfather, a former
Murrieta resident, was sent to Pacific Cremation Care last year. The
Korean War veteran had fatally shot himself after learning he had
terminal lung cancer. He left behind a $150 check to cover the
balance on a credit card bill, and an $850 check for cremation costs.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the thought of Ronald King's body pulled apart and scattered
across the country was more than DiMeglio could bear. He wept and
waited several days before finding the courage to break the news to
his adult daughters.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, to them, this was Grandpa," said DiMeglio, his voice
becoming thick with emotion. "When you are in such a desperate place,
when you are feeling so vulnerable, you just don't think someone is
going to do this. If you can't trust somebody helping you through a
death in your family, who can you trust?"</TE>
<TE>   Families now are uncertain if the ashes returned to them are
indeed of their loved one. Others are waiting for remains still in
the custody of authorities holding them for evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we face the prospect of having to lay [William] to rest
properly this time and, in a way, apologize for not being able to do
it right the first time," Rodriguez said.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, sheriff's investigators flew to universities in San
Francisco, Utah, Kentucky and North Carolina to recover body parts.
Brown also sold cadavers to Cypress College in Orange Country, court
documents show.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities, state legislators and officials with the Department
of Consumer Affairs said the facilities that bought the parts did not
violate any laws.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers are under no obligation to verify that vendors are
dealing in properly donated tissue, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Court records indicate that at the time Brown engaged in the sale
of body parts, he was struggling with deep financial problems.
Federal and county tax judgments of $23,252 have been filed against
Pacific Cremation Care. And in 1994, Brown's wife, Victoria, filed
for bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   Case Similar to UC Scandal</TE>
<TE>   The case closely mimics a 1999 scandal at UC Irvine, when the head
of the school's Willed Body Program, Christopher Brown, was fired for
alleged wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, who is not related to Michael Brown, allegedly sold body
parts to out-of-state researchers without university knowledge,
returned the wrong ashes to family members, and improperly charged
relatives for the return of ashes after bodies were used for
research.</TE>
<TE>   A university audit also revealed Brown overcharged the school
hundreds of dollars by inflating the bills from a private cadaver
transportation company, owned by a business associate of Brown's.</TE>
<TE>   Brown was fired from the university, but no criminal charges were
filed. Still, the case spurred state lawmakers to create laws that
were supposed to tighten regulation of willed-body programs.</TE>
<TE>   At the urging of the Orange Country District Attorney's Office,
which investigated the UC Irvine case, Assemblyman Maddox wrote a
bill calling for better documentation of willed bodies, made it a
crime to knowingly return the wrong cremated remains to family
members, and allowed remains cremated after they were used for
medical research to be returned to relatives at no charge.</TE>
<TE>   It also required coroners to receive consent on any body or body
part released for scientific purposes.</TE>
<TE>   That bill was augmented in August 2000 with one from former
Assemblyman Martin Gallegos (D-Baldwin Park), who put the oversight
of live organ transplants under the jurisdiction of the Department of
Health Services. Gallegos also ordered Health Services officials to
study the body parts industry and report back with a list of
recommended changes. But that report isn't due until January 2003,
said Kevin Reilly, deputy director for prevention services at the
California Department of Health Services.</TE>
<TE>   "We are still assessing what problems exist," Reilly said.
"Certainly we are aware of the situation in Riverside County, and
that should influence some of our decision-making about future
regulations."</TE>

<HD>High Desert Schools Fear Student Flood</HD>
<DH>Education: Even if a measure to build new facilities
passes, it may not be enough to handle an enrollment surge at
secondary campuses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Though his Lancaster office is miles from the coast, Larry Freise is
obsessed with what he calls the "tsunami" threatening the High
Desert.</LD>
<LD>   The tidal wave he's worried about is made up of students. Freise,
the attendance coordinator for Antelope Valley Union High School
District, has been keeping an eye on a recent increase in elementary
and middle school students--a statistical swell that is moving toward
the high schools with disaster-movie certainty.</LD>
<LD>   The 19,000-student high school district, which grew by about 450
students this school year, will grow by 1,200 next fall and many
thousands more over the next five years, he projects.</LD>
<TE>   The wave, Freise said, "is about to crash right on our district."</TE>
<TE>   These are the baby boomers' children, part of a nationwide
population bulge statisticians call the "boomer echo."</TE>
<TE>   Officials in the Antelope Valley district--which already teaches
more than a third of its students in trailers--are expecting to be
hit especially hard. While a tax-weary electorate rejected a
$91-million school construction bond in 1999, a new crop of young
families was moving to the desert in the late 1990s as the region
rebounded from a period of recession and foreclosure. According to
2000 census figures, the three fastest-growing cities in Los Angeles
County in the 1990s--Palmdale, Lake Los Angeles and Acton--were in
the Antelope Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The desert transplants, who came for the wide-open spaces and
affordable four-bedroom houses, are finding that the public high
schools are already packed tight, and facing a crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Amanda Petryshyn is a junior at Highland High School. Until she
began an independent-study program, she was one of 3,000 students on
a campus built for 2,100. Amanda said the crush of bodies at the
beginning of the school year caused so many scheduling problems that
she and others spent up to three weeks with gaping holes in their
school days. After a week, Amanda's mother intervened and she finally
filled in two missing classes on her schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "There were just too many students at the beginning of the year,"
Amanda said.</TE>
<TE>   On March 5, residents voted on a $103-million bond measure, which
would provide funds for at least one new 3,000-student high school
and a number of smaller campuses. Whether Measure V passed remains
unclear.</TE>
<TE>   Bond supporters are claiming victory, albeit somewhat tentatively.</TE>
<TE>   The current vote count gives the "Yes" side about 57%; passage
requires 55%. But an unknown number of absentee ballots are still
uncounted, and the registrar's official certification of the tally is
not expected until April 2.</TE>
<TE>   A similar measure failed in 1999 with 63% voting in favor. But
that package required a two-thirds majority. The threshold was
lowered when Proposition 39 passed two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Early on, there was concern about the school board's decision to
name two of the proposed schools after R. Rex Parris, a local lawyer
and Republican activist, and state Sen. William J. "Pete" Knight, who
has drawn criticism from gay and Latino groups for actions they have
deemed homophobic and racist.</TE>
<TE>   But the protests never surfaced. Eventually, more concern was
generated by revelations that a school board member, Darrel Brown,
was dating the district spokeswoman while he voted on her promotion.
Though the Los Angeles County district attorney's office found that
Brown had violated no laws, he resigned in January, and critics
howled that the district couldn't be trusted with its finances.</TE>
<TE>   Many bond supporters said they held their noses while voting yes.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed it, I guess," said Mary Spiva, a Palmdale resident. "We
definitely needed those schools."</TE>
<TE>   At the very least, the bond--which would add $29 each tax year per
$100,000 of residents' assessed home value--will pay for the
3,000-student Pete Knight High School and the Parris Continuation
School, both in Palmdale, as well as two small schools for expelled
students, and modernization work at a number of campuses, Freise
said.</TE>
<TE>   District officials also are hoping a proposed multibillion-dollar
statewide school bond package will make it to the ballot in November,
providing matching funds and allowing them to build an eighth
full-size high school.</TE>
<TE>   That would take care of some of the crowding problems, Freise
said, but not the tsunami.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole time we've got [thousands] more students coming," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Amanda Petryshyn's mother, Claudia, said the schools were fine
when she moved to the area 13 years ago. Freise estimates there were
about 30 trailer classrooms then. Today, the district has about 300
temporary classrooms, with 100 more planned for the next two years.</TE>
<TE>   Freise figures the Antelope Valley's chief lure--affordable
housing--helped prospective parents overlook the squeeze on campuses.</TE>
<TE>   "If the schools are a little crowded, they can put up with it," he
said. "They don't care. They still have a big house."</TE>

<HD>Breast Cancer Survivors on a Crusade</HD>
<DH>Marin County: They wonder why the area has such a high
death rate. Environmental hazards are suspected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>On her regular hikes along the rugged Marin County coast, Fern
Orenstein considers the roiling Pacific and ponders a troubling
reality: In this lush and health-conscious corner of California, too
many of her friends are falling prey to breast cancer.</LD>
<LD>   "How could such a beautiful place be associated with so much
death?" she asks.</LD>
<LD>   In a 1999 study by the National Cancer Institute, breast cancer
death rates in Marin were among the highest 10% of counties in the
nation. The rate is also among the highest in California, according
to the Northern California Cancer Center.</LD>
<TE>   Those figures are not necessarily a surprise. Breast cancer rates
rise with age, and Marin County's residents are substantially older
than average. Rates of the disease are also higher among women who
have never had children or who had their first child late in
life--characteristics often found in women living in this collection
of affluent suburbs.</TE>
<TE>   But for many women, those statistical explanations for the disease
do not suffice. Some find them deeply frustrating.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to take a close look at our environment," Orenstein
said. "For all those scientists who have written off the idea of a
cancer cluster, I say, 'You go tell that to a community where six
women in a three-block area have come down with the disease.'"</TE>
<TE>   Over the last six years, Orenstein, 43, and several other Marin
breast cancer survivors have waged a crusade to track what they see
as a medical mystery.</TE>
<TE>   Like residents of Love Canal a generation ago--and women in
similar locales with high cancer rates, such as New York City's Long
Island suburbs--these women suspect their community suffers from
serious environmental problems. But no one, from their doctors to
local medical researchers, has been able to explain it to their
satisfaction.</TE>
<TE>   With no scientific backgrounds, working from their kitchens and
living rooms, they formed a nonprofit group that has taken part in
several ambitious cancer studies, sought and received continued
academic research support and worked to raise awareness about the
disease in local and state politics.</TE>
<TE>   For the 11 board members of the Marin Breast Cancer Watch, their
push for answers has taken on a fresh edge: Two of the group's
original five members, including founder Francine Levien, died of
breast cancer last year.</TE>
<TE>   "We see ourselves as these Nancy Drews, desperately tracking down
every possible clue to find out what is happening," said Roni Peskin
Mentzer, group president.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, Mentzer was diagnosed with cancer. It was the year she
became engaged.</TE>
<TE>   "I was shocked," said the 56-year-old furniture designer. "I had
regular mammograms, routine checkups. Suddenly, I had breast cancer,
enduring a lumpectomy, radiation and chemotherapy."</TE>
<TE>   Even then, the thought of becoming a cancer activist was the
furthest thing from her mind: "The only group I'd ever joined was the
local Rotary Club."</TE>
<TE>   After her recovery, she and Orenstein joined with other local
cancer survivors--including a physical therapist, a doctor and a
saleswoman--who wanted to learn more about the situation in Marin.</TE>
<TE>   First, they approached local hospitals about conducting a study of
Marin, but were told they needed to enlist an epidemiologist to
oversee their research and make sure they adhered to scientific
methods. After months of rejection by other experts, they met
Margaret Wrensch, an epidemiologist at the UC San Francisco School of
Medicine, who agreed to help.</TE>
<TE>   They began combing the medical literature on breast cancer and met
with Wrensch to discuss their findings in what Orenstein calls
"Epidemiology 101" classes.</TE>
<TE>   Mentzer attended a world breast cancer conference in Toronto.
Other group members sponsored speeches and other events to raise
money to hire a support staff. They applied for grants.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought this was going to be a one-time thing, that they'd say,
'Oh, this is too hard. We can't do this,'" recalls Wrensch, who was
paid a stipend from grant money that the group received. "Here were
these women who would not become intimidated. They were all affected
by this disease and they wanted to understand it."</TE>
<TE>   The group focused on what it saw as a gap in breast cancer
research: whether a woman's adolescent experiences influenced her
risk later in life.</TE>
<TE>   With a $500,000 grant from UC Berkeley, they launched a study to
compare the teenage experiences of 300 Marin County breast cancer
patients with 300 local women without the disease.</TE>
<TE>   Members helped design a questionnaire to assist study participants
in recalling long-forgotten elements of their childhoods. They soon
plan to release the first data from the three-year study, which
examined family and social connections, along with physical health
factors such as smoking, drinking and diet.</TE>
<TE>   Working with a research collaborative involving local universities
and laboratories, they also focused on a question that baffles many
local women: Is there something in Marin's soil, air or water causing
the disease?</TE>
<TE>   Group members are helping design a database to track local
carcinogens. Working on tips from other residents, they're
investigating whether World War II munitions were buried at local
landfills. They've researched submerged containers of radioactive
materials sunk off the coast, and hope to look at emissions from oil
refineries across San Francisco Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Bobbie Head sees three to five new breast cancer patients each
week at her Marin County practice, and agrees that it makes sense to
investigate such possible causes as diet and childhood medical
history. But she does not believe the county suffers from a
particular environmental problem. "I live here and I have a
daughter," she said. "If I thought it was that dangerous, I'd leave."</TE>
<TE>   Experts say alcohol consumption, early puberty, late age at first
full-term pregnancy and late menopause are among the known risk
factors for breast cancer. Still, those factors are found in fewer
than 50% of women diagnosed with the disease, according to another
recent National Cancer Institute study.</TE>
<TE>   Members of Marin Breast Cancer Watch and the San Francisco-based
Breast Cancer Fund recently testified at a legislative hearing in
Sacramento to examine the connection between chemicals and breast
cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Jeanne Rizzo, executive director of the Breast Cancer Fund, says
Marin Breast Cancer Watch and its community-based research could one
day be a national model. "They are a serious group, and we have
funded some of their studies," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're uncovering information that will be useful well beyond
Marin County. Not only that, they're showing the rest of the nation
that everyday women can get involved in solving a problem, adding
community data that will bring a more informed result."</TE>
<TE>   Mentzer's search for answers has allowed her to turn the tables on
a disease that almost killed her. "When I was in chemotherapy, I
always saw my cancer as this serial killer who lurked behind every
tree, playing havoc with my life," she said. "But since I've become
an activist, I'm now stalking the stalker. And that in itself is a
victory."</TE>

<HD>Chapel's Details Show Faith Meeting Design</HD>
<DH>Architecture: After a long dispute, all parties agree on
the shape of All Faiths on the Chapman University campus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four years ago, a "ground blessing" celebrated plans to build an
interfaith chapel on the campus of Chapman University in Orange.</LD>
<LD>   Conservative Christians protested.</LD>
<LD>   Then university officials looked at the plans and complained the
chapel would be too expensive and too small.</LD>
<TE>   Then city officials rejected a revised plan as too modern for the
early 20th century style of Orange's downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the City Council in January approved another revised plan
for the 12,000-square-foot Wallace All Faiths Chapel--the final
chapter in a lesson on the difficulties of finding the nexus between
faith and architecture.</TE>
<TE>   The new chapel is inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright's Unity Temple, a
Prairie-style church that houses a Unitarian Universalist
congregation in Oak Park, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   Architect David Martin said a walk through the chapel will
resemble a journey: gradually moving from the material world to the
spiritual world, using nature, water, air and light to guide
worshipers.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to choreograph architectural experiences to
reinforce a sense of spirituality," Martin said. "Instead of walking
in the door and seeing the whole story revealed immediately, it
unfolds like a film or a book."</TE>
<TE>   Martin uses a series of steps and ramps, the position of windows,
a fountain and a trellis of wisteria to draw people inside. "In every
religion, water is a symbol for birth or a reawakening," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Chapman, with 3,200 undergraduates and 1,100 graduate students,
offered the challenge of fitting into a distinct environment. The
campus is about three blocks north of the Orange traffic circle, the
center of town that residents call the plaza.</TE>
<TE>   A one-mile square around the plaza, with its with neo-classical
brick buildings, is listed on the National Register of Historic
Places. Moving away from the downtown, there are a number of
Victorian and Craftsman homes built in the early 20th century.</TE>
<TE>   The university is affiliated with the Disciples of Christ, a
Protestant group founded in the United States in the 19th century
that now claims about 850,000 members worldwide and urges members to
base their faith on a personal interpretation of the Bible.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign to raise funds for the chapel began a decade ago. The
largest contribution came from George Fisher, chairman of Eastman
Kodak Co., and his wife Ann, a Chapman alumna. The chapel will be
named after Ann's parents. Her father, the Rev. Ray Wallace, was a
Disciples of Christ minister.</TE>
<TE>   The 1998 "ground blessing" that heralded the chapel included Jews,
Muslims, Mormons and Wiccans. The Juaneno Indians provided a tobacco
blessing.</TE>
<TE>   But at the same time, a group of conservative Christians protested
elsewhere on campus that non-Christians would be using the chapel and
vowed not to worship there.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, university officials rejected a more traditional
plan for the chapel by architect Fay Jones, calling it too expensive
at $8 million and too small, with a capacity of 125.</TE>
<TE>   They turned to Martin, designer of Camarillo's award-winning Padre
Serra Parish Church, as well as Chapman's law school and the Argyros
Forum student union.</TE>
<TE>   Although Martin had designed several other churches, the all-faith
nature of the Wallace chapel required a different character.</TE>
<TE>   His original design called for a cylindrical structure. But last
year, after a 3 1/2-hour debate, the Orange Planning Commission voted
it down, saying it was too modern for the historic district.</TE>
<TE>   It was literally back to the drawing board. The design of the
building was squared off, and the facade was changed from sandstone
and stucco to beige and brown bricks to blend in with the rest of Old
Towne.</TE>
<TE>   The new plan, which retained many of the characteristics of the
first design, including its 250-seat capacity, was approved by the
City Council in January and by the city's design review committee in
February. It also has received the support of preservationists.</TE>
<TE>   "It still picks up the feel of the original while looking more
traditional on the outside," said Kris Olsen, Chapman's director of
construction management.</TE>
<TE>   The chapel will cost nearly $6million, about $1.5 million more
than the old plan, reflecting the price of the brick and other
development costs.</TE>
<TE>   The roof will be made of zinc, which weathers to a soft gray and
resembles the lead used on the older roofs.</TE>
<TE>   The inside will consist of four slightly arching walls. The chapel
will be without any permanent religious symbols. Objects used in
services, such as crosses and sacred writings, will be stored in
closets.</TE>

<HD>J. Charles, 91; Cheery 'Waving Man'</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joseph W. Charles, a gentle spirit who brightened the commute of
motorists in Berkeley for 30 years, died Thursday of heart failure at
an Oakland hospital. He was 91.</LD>
<LD>   Charles earned his nickname "Waving Man" for his practice of
standing on a busy Berkeley street corner to wave a cheerful hello
and offer words of encouragement to motorists in passing cars.</LD>
<LD>   By the time he retired in 1992, for health reasons, Charles had
been featured in newspaper and television reports worldwide.</LD>
<TE>   For a city better known for making political waves, the charming
and unassuming Charles was a beacon of goodwill.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the heart of Berkeley," said Julie Conger, an Alameda
County Superior Court judge and longtime friend. "He was just a
wonderful, wonderful man."</TE>
<TE>   Charles began his routine in 1962, a custom that started
informally with a casual wave to a neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   At first, he said, he got some stares and his wife wanted to know
"if I was crazy." But, gradually, his cheerful waves and benediction
"You keep smiling" became a staple of the morning drive.</TE>
<TE>   In 1971, Charles retired from his regular job at the Oakland Naval
Supply Center, but he still rose each day at 6:30 a.m. to take up his
post on Martin Luther King Jr. Way.</TE>
<TE>   Although he became a Berkeley landmark, Charles wasn't a native
Californian.</TE>
<TE>   He was born in Lake Charles, La., and moved to the Bay Area in the
1940s, part of the migration of southern blacks in search of work in
the booming shipyards of World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Charles' legacy, said his friends, will be his smile, his wave and
his often-repeated exhortation to "Have a good day!"</TE>

<HD>Couple Hurt in Police Pursuit</HD>
<DH>Accident: Out on daily walk to Beverly Center, they are
struck by a car trying to elude officers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DIRMANN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After 57 years of marriage, Anna and Henry Polivoda still enjoyed
their daily walks to the Beverly Center.</LD>
<LD>   She is 76. He is 79. They married shortly after World War II, a
celebration of survival for living through the Holocaust in Poland.
In recent years, they led happy, healthy and independent lives.</LD>
<LD>   Their afternoon walks were proof of that.</LD>
<TE>   But on Sunday, they were recovering in adjoining intensive care
units after being struck the day before by a car during a high-speed
pursuit outside the mall. It happened just after 2 p.m. Saturday,
when a man speeding away from police raced through the crosswalk at
the mall's entrance at Beverly and La Cienega boulevards and slammed
into the couple.</TE>
<TE>   Stephany Yablow, speaking from the hospital, said that before the
accident her mother was very active--gardening, baking and hanging
her laundry out to dry. "My dad is almost 80, but has never been in
the hospital," she said. "And now this."</TE>
<TE>   The Polivodas were listed in fair condition Sunday at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   Anna Polivoda suffered a head injury, a broken thumb and a leg
broken so badly that doctors thought for a while they would have to
amputate.</TE>
<TE>   Henry Polivoda suffered a broken leg and a severe concussion that
has left him disoriented, Yablow said.</TE>
<TE>   Police arrested the driver, 23-year-old Tremine Tillman of Van
Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   An unidentified man and woman in Tillman's car fled after the
accident.</TE>
<TE>   A Los Angeles Police Department spokesman was unsure why officers
initially tried to stop Tillman as he drove near La Brea Avenue and
Washington Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   But after noticing the patrol car's lights and sirens, the suspect
allegedly picked up speed and began careening down side streets,
smashing into as many as 12 cars until he reached the Beverly Center,
police said.</TE>
<TE>   After the car hit the Polivodas, its occupants jumped out and ran
into the crowded mall. Dozens of officers swarmed the Beverly Center,
locking it down for two hours and trapping thousands of customers
inside.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, police said, they were able to capture only Tillman,
spotted by customers as he ran outside Bloomingdale's.</TE>
<TE>   Tillman was initially booked on suspicion of felony evasion,
though more charges could be added, including causing injuries while
evading arrest, said Sgt. Jesse Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Yablow said her parents were expected to recover, but fears that
they may suffer lingering health problems.</TE>
<TE>   She said it's a terrible twist of fate for a couple who have
overcome so much adversity in their lives. Her father escaped into
Russia to hide from the Germans during World War II, and her mother
nearly died in the Auschwitz concentration camp.</TE>
<TE>   The couple moved to America in the 1960s to raise their two
daughters.</TE>
<TE>   He became a successful tailor. She took on work as a seamstress.</TE>
<TE>   While remembering her parents' struggles, Yablow paused to vent
her anger at police, who she said contributed to the accident by
engaging in a pursuit in an area congested with people.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand the LAPD [has] a job to catch wrongdoers," Yablow
said. "But they should not do so at the expense of people's lives.
And now that it's hit home, I am going to make it a mission to change
pursuit policies."</TE>
<TE>   LAPD officials defended their actions, saying the officers who
initiated the pursuit were no longer involved when the accident
happened.</TE>
<TE>   Heavy traffic caused the police cruiser to lose the car it was
pursuing, Williams said. Only a police helicopter was still involved
in the chase at the time of the collision, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are talking about a vehicle you are in pursuit of, you
see the vehicle and you are behind it," Williams said. "And that just
wasn't the case here."</TE>

<HD>Don't Cut Teachers, Programs, Voters Say</HD>
<DH>Education: Survey finds most in county prefer to solve
budget woes by reducing administrators.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County voters agree that if public schools need to make budget
cuts, they should begin with administrators and not teachers and
programs, according to a survey to be released today.</LD>
<LD>   The poll, conducted by Pacific Opinions, an Irvine-based research
company, found that despite the money woes facing many school
districts, 49% of registered voters believe public schools are in
"very good shape" or in "somewhat good shape" when it comes to
finances, while 29% believe the schools are faring poorly. The rest
are not sure.</LD>
<LD>   The poll comes at a time when many districts are beginning to plan
budgets for next year, and some are issuing dire warnings about
potential budget cuts.</LD>
<TE>   Those polled with children in public schools were far more likely
to see budget problems.</TE>
<TE>   "Parents are seeing the schools on a daily basis," said Christian
Collet, president of Pacific Opinions and a visiting professor of
political science at UC Irvine. "They know the plasters are coming
off the walls."</TE>
<TE>   The survey was conducted by telephone in English and Spanish from
Feb. 11 to 18 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.3
percentage points, Collet said. Researchers questioned 540 registered
voters. One quarter, or 120 respondents, have children in public
schools.</TE>
<TE>   If those surveyed had no consensus on the financial state of
Orange County public schools, they agreed even less on other
problems.</TE>
<TE>   Overcrowding was mentioned most often, with 18% of responses,
followed by lack of funding, quality of teaching and campus safety.</TE>
<TE>   The survey represents the opinions of registered voters rather
than county residents as a whole. However, Collet said, voters are
more likely to have a say in future education policy.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of consensus on a single education issue in Orange County
means "the debate and how it will emerge publicly is up for grabs,"
Collet said. "Republicans will hammer away at bureaucracy and wasted
money and lack of standards, and Democrats will hammer at lack of
funding and overcrowded schools."</TE>
<TE>   The poll reflected such divisions. Democrats were more likely than
Republicans to say overcrowding was the biggest problem in schools
and to express confidence in the way school administrators manage
finances.</TE>
<TE>   One area where most seemed to agree was where to make cuts if
needed. All groups--Democrats, Republicans and those with or without
children in public schools--said they would be more willing to trim
administrative positions than teachers' and programs.</TE>
<TE>   More than two-thirds said that if cuts were necessary, they would
be prepared to cut administrative positions. A third said they could
tolerate increases in elementary class sizes and 26% said they would
do without arts and music programs. Only 12% said they would be
willing to cut teacher salaries.</TE>
<TE>   Capistrano Unified Faces $6 Million in Trims</TE>
<TE>   That is a daunting finding for Capistrano Unified School District
Supt. James Fleming, who faces the task of announcing to his board of
trustees tonight that it will need to cut about $6 million from next
year's budget. Capistrano already has cut nearly $6.5 million from
its expenses in the current fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   Fleming wasn't surprised that voters were most willing to cut
administrative posts.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand where the parents are coming from," he said. "You
know your child's teacher and most are doing a good job, and the
sympathy is understandable."</TE>
<TE>   With the state predicting a $12-billion budget deficit and
districts facing ever-increasing costs in special education,
health-care benefits and other areas, Fleming said, the pinch is all
too real.</TE>
<TE>   The chief of the 45,000-student district said officials will have
to consider increasing class sizes in kindergarten through third
grades, among other measures.</TE>
<TE>   Fleming said he will suggest the formation of review groups
comprising employees and parents and invite the district unions and
PTAs to discuss areas for downsizing.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be a heavy-duty financial task," he said. "There will be
a lot of reality checks."</TE>

<HD>A New Power Struggle at El Toro</HD>
<DH>Supervisors: Spitzer- Coad proposal would rein in
redevelopment authority. Post-election study of the base's future is
also being urged.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Orange County supervisors want to reel in the powerful El Toro
airport agency and order a massive study on what to do with the
former El Toro Marine base.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors Todd Spitzer and Board Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad,
usually at opposite ends of the airport battle, have proposed moving
the El Toro Local Redevelopment Authority under the county's chief
executive, rather than the Board of Supervisors, which has been
polarized for years with three members supporting an airport and two
opposed.</LD>
<LD>   Having authority chief Gary Simon report to County Executive
Officer Michael Schumacher effectively would force much
decision-making to take place before issues reach the board. Simon,
whose mission had been to build an airport at El Toro, has had the
ear and support of the three-member, pro-airport majority.</LD>
<TE>   The proposal to bring the authority under the CEO will be
considered by supervisors Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer and Coad also are asking for a thorough study of El Toro's
future in light of voters' approval of Measure W, which rezoned the
base to prevent an airport and instead use the land for a park and
other compatible development.</TE>
<TE>   The day after the March 5 election, the Navy announced its intent
to put the 4,700-acre base up for public sale, even as it has said it
would consider local plans for a park and other compatible uses. The
Navy, eager to complete the transfer of the base, which has been
closed since 1999, said it plans to decide what to do with the
property by April 23.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal to rein in the redevelopment authority is being
viewed as a power play by Spitzer, whose opposition to an airport
often has resulted in his crossing swords with Simon.</TE>
<TE>   Their conflict came to a head in January, when thousands of
postcards promoting the airport were shipped to a post office a day
after a judge ordered the county to stop using public funds to
promote an airport.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer contends that Simon told him no mailers were pending.
Simon has said he told Spitzer there were postcards in the mail
"pipeline." Now when the two talk, Spitzer tape-records their
discussions.</TE>
<TE>   In his job as executive director, Simon earns about $182,000 a
year overseeing an agency of 29 employees, whose task is to plan the
switch from military base to civilian use. It also is charged with
maintaining and maximizing base assets, such as stables, a golf
course and agricultural leases while the county leases the land from
the Navy.</TE>
<TE>   The authority now must shift its emphasis from planning for an
airport to developing it in accordance with Measure W. Spitzer says
his proposal is an effort to speed that process.</TE>
<TE>   But Supervisor Chuck Smith, who supported an airport, called
Spitzer's proposals a "knee-jerk" reaction after the election and a
veiled attempt to fire Simon.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to let the dust settle a little," Smith said, adding that
he believes Simon has done a good job and that any attempt to get rid
of him now would be a waste of valuable county time and money because
of the Navy's pending decision on transferring or selling the base.</TE>
<TE>   "Spitzer has tried to fire Gary [Simon] before but didn't
succeed," Smith said, adding that he nonetheless had no problem
merging Simon's planning agency into the executive office run by
Schumacher.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Tom Wilson said he favors the move too. Supervisor Jim
Silva was out of town and could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The merger would give Simon more time to meet with supervisors and
make him more accountable, Wilson said. Simon's agency now is a
separate entity, but while he reports directly to the board, he can
confer with only two supervisors at a time because having a third
board member present would be a violation of the Brown Act.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer, who denied he was seeking Simon's dismissal, said that if
the agency answers to Schumacher, Brown Act provisions wouldn't
apply. He said he is only trying to bring greater oversight,
especially now that the county cannot use revenue from John Wayne
Airport for base planning.</TE>
<TE>   About $11.8 million in John Wayne funds had been earmarked for El
Toro planning for fiscal year 2001-02.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't spend [John Wayne Airport] money anymore, and the CEO is
the one who oversees the general fund," Spitzer said. "I want the CEO
to explain if we can afford to take the next step on El Toro,
whatever that may be."</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer said he also was trying to fast-track the decision-making
process, noting that Simon wanted to wait until April 16 to convene a
special meeting of the board, which also sits as directors of the
redevelopment authority.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to wait seven weeks to give direction. It's
imperative we do it immediately," Spitzer said. "I hope people don't
look at this as a defensive posture of staking out their turf, but
instead, the board saying we have a responsibility to get answers."</TE>
<TE>   Simon, who was hired in January 2001, said that during his
contract negotiations, the possibility of various El Toro options was
raised.</TE>
<TE>   "I would be pleased to lead the team from aviation to
nonaviation," Simon said in an interview. "The citizens of Orange
County will see the same high level of work, dedication and
commitment to the Measure W plan that we put into the aviation plan."</TE>
<TE>   But whether the county will even get control of the base is
undecided.</TE>
<TE>   "The county doesn't own it, and we could say to the military,
'It's yours,'" Coad said. "But we need to know our options, and we're
bringing many departments in so there will be a complete picture."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>A fire raged for hours at the Haslett Warehouse, a historic landmark
on Fisherman's Wharf, destroying the fourth floor and roof.</LD>
<LD>   The fire was contained Sunday, but firefighters continued to watch
for flare-ups.</LD>
<LD>   The fourth floor and roof of the 198,000-square-foot building were
destroyed, although the brick facade still stands, Fire Capt. Pete
Howes said.</LD>
<TE>   Firefighters were keeping people away in case of collapse. The
building was built about 1907 and was undergoing renovations.</TE>
<TE>   The Kimpton Hotel and Restaurant Group had signed a 57-year lease
with the National Park Service, which owns the Haslett Warehouse, to
transform it into the Argonaut Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a disappointing circumstance," said Tom LaTour, chairman and
chief executive of the Kimpton Group. He said the hotel's opening day
will probably be pushed back to mid-2003. LaTour said he has no idea
how much the damage will cost to repair.</TE>
<TE>   The warehouse is adjacent to the Cannery shopping center, which
remained closed Sunday. Some of the 30 shops and restaurants were
damaged and would remain closed until cleanup was finished, said Kris
Kremers, marketing director for the center.</TE>
<TE>   There were no reports of injuries. Most businesses on the wharf
were closed when the fire broke shortly before midnight, city fire
Lt. Eric Richardson said.</TE>
<TE>   Fire investigators did not immediately determine a cause.</TE>

<HD>New GED Exam Is Causing Testiness</HD>
<DH>Education: Early reports indicate some find the 'harder by
design' equivalency test daunting. The scoring process causes delays.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA LEFF</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A revamped version of the national high school equivalency exam that
tens of thousands of Californians take each year is making its debut
across the state, bringing anxiety over its difficulty, new testing
procedures and scoring delays, adult-school officials say.</LD>
<LD>   The General Educational Development, or GED, exam is designed to
give adults who never completed high school another shot at earning
their diplomas. For the first time since 1988 and only the third time
in its 60-year history, the test was revised this year to keep up
with evolving high school graduation requirements and the demands of
the modern workplace.</LD>
<LD>   "It certainly is different, very different, but it's also harder
by design," said Lyn Schaefer, director of test development for the
GED Testing Service at the American Council on Education, the private
organization that administers the exam.</LD>
<TE>   "The knowledge that just about every state was evaluating their
graduation standards prompted us to look at the [old] test and ask,
'How well does this match up with what high school students are going
to be doing in the 21st century?'"</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard resident Daniel Govea, 25, knows that the GED test he plans
to take later this month is more rigorous than the one he would have
faced 11 weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   Seven years after he dropped out of high school in the last
semester of his senior year, however, and with the promise of a
$2-an-hour-raise at the optician's shop where he works if he passes,
Govea is determined to keep studying until he has a GED certificate.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been easier to pass before, but I'm pretty
confident that I'll still be able to pass it," said Govea. "What I
really wish is that I would have just graduated from high school."</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Edmunds, associate analyst for the California GED Office,
said it is too early to say what effect the harder exam is having on
passing rates. Preliminary results show that test-takers are
struggling the most with the math and writing portions, just as they
did with the old test, she said.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the main problem the new test has created is a scoring
backlog that has increased the amount of time test-takers have to
wait for their results--and, if they passed, their diplomas--from
about two weeks to a month or longer.</TE>
<TE>   New Scoring System Is Delaying Results</TE>
<TE>   In the past, testing sites were permitted to do some preliminary
scoring on their own. But when the new test was launched, the state
simultaneously moved to a centralized scoring system that has slowed
down an information pipeline that was already overtaxed, Edmunds
said.</TE>
<TE>   She said state officials are working to speed up the processing of
scores and, in certain emergency situations, have been able to give
candidates whose futures rest on whether they pass the GED at least
verbal confirmation on their standing.</TE>
<TE>   "In some cases, it can mean the difference between financial aid
or not, and it can mean the difference between getting a job or not,"
Edmunds said.</TE>
<TE>   "For the person taking the exam, it means whether they can get on
with their life, or if they are going to be stuck where they are."</TE>
<TE>   The most radical change in the test, or at least the one that is
causing the most apprehension, is the move to a two-part math section
that places a much greater emphasis on algebra. On the first half,
students may use a scientific calculator, a tool that has never been
permitted before, and one-fifth of the math questions requires them
to write in the correct response instead of selecting a
multiple-choice answer.</TE>
<TE>   Other updates include a shift toward questions that assess both
practical knowledge and analytical ability. On the nonfiction section
of the reading test, for example, students are more likely to find a
job training manual than a theater review, while everyday items such
as recipes and nutritional content labels form the basis of word
problems on the math segment.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the essay portion has taken on more weight in the
overall scoring of the test.</TE>
<TE>   Although the overhauled exam became effective Jan. 14, most
testing sites throughout Southern California have only recently
started administering it. The Los Angeles Unified School District,
for instance, which operates the state's largest GED testing center
at a facility downtown, offered it for the first time in late
February. The Simi Valley Adult School has scheduled its first
testing session for late March.</TE>
<TE>   Edmunds, of the state GED Office, said difficulty in obtaining
student workbooks, practice tests and other preparation materials has
forced many adult schools to postpone their initial testing dates.</TE>
<TE>   "Teachers and agencies that are preparing people for the test
really felt like they didn't have the materials necessary to get them
ready," Edmunds said, adding that the materials became widely
available only in early February.</TE>
<TE>   According to adult-school officials, the delays have not created
huge backlogs of thwarted test-takers, in part because so many people
opted to take the old GED exam before it was retired on Dec. 31.
Edmunds estimates that close to 70,000 people took the GED in
California last year, a 20% jump over the number of test-takers in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   The rush of candidates was prompted by the GED Testing Service's
announcement that test-takers who may have passed one or more
sections of the old test wouldn't be permitted to roll over their
scores once the new exam was introduced.</TE>
<TE>   Coupled with publicity over the new test's increased rigor,
virtually every test site in the region saw a flurry of last-minute
test-takers.</TE>
<TE>   "We sent out letters starting in June to anybody who has taken the
GED with us during the last 10 years, and in September we had this
huge rush," said Linda Sugino, GED testing examiner at the Oxnard
Adult School. "I was testing almost every day through November and
December, and we had full houses every night."</TE>
<TE>   As they have introduced the new exam, some sites have opted to
reduce the number of test-takers they will accommodate at one time.</TE>
<TE>   Spreading 7 1/2-Hour Test Over 2 or More Days</TE>
<TE>   Last year, for instance, L.A. Unified's testing center offered the
GED to groups of 40 to 50 people. For its first several testing
sessions, the center is limiting its candidate pool to half that
many, mostly to give examiners a chance to become familiar with the
new format, said chief GED examiner Ann Jackson. Some test sites,
including the downtown Los Angeles site, have started spreading the 7
1/2-hour test over two or more days.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Macri, chief GED examiner at the Simi Valley Adult School,
said an eight-page pre-test demographic survey that the GED Testing
Service is requiring for research purposes made it less feasible to
allow test-takers to complete the entire battery in one sitting.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it is too much to do in one day for the students," Macri
said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at schools that have gained some experience with the new
test say the switch has gone smoothly.</TE>
<TE>   Sugino, of the Oxnard Adult School, recently received her first
round of scores and said she was pleasantly surprised by the results,
which were comparable to those for the old test.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a bit leery because of the new testing form," Sugino said.
"But they did well, better than I was expecting."</TE>

<HD>George Fresolone, 48; Mob Informant</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>George Fresolone, an organized crime turncoat who wore a hidden
microphone to his own Mafia initiation and helped prosecutors indict
leaders of the Philadelphia-New Jersey mob, has died. He was 48.</LD>
<LD>   Fresolone, who co-wrote the 1994 book "Blood Oath," about the
inner workings of the mob, died of a heart attack Wednesday at an
undisclosed location where he had been living under the federal
witness protection program.</LD>
<LD>   "As far as I know, he was never sick and never complained about
chest pains," his co-author, Robert J. Wagman, told the Star-Ledger
of Newark, N.J.</LD>
<TE>   Two of Fresolone's children found his body in the hallway of his
home, said Bill Newsome, who was in the New Jersey State Police for
more than 25 years and worked with Fresolone. No foul play was
suspected, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Fresolone bought a home
after being relocated under the witness protection program. He went
to work for a maintenance contractor and eventually bought the
business.</TE>
<TE>   "Blood Oath" detailed Fresolone's time inside organized crime,
including his teenage years in Newark's Ironbound section; his
decision to become an informant; and the tape recordings he made
while wearing a body wire for investigators in 1989 and 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the information he helped gather led to the 1991
racketeering indictments against 38 reputed mobsters, including now
imprisoned Nicodemo "Little Nicky" Scarfo, then the reputed
Philadelphia-Atlantic City mob boss. During a yearlong investigation
of the Colombo, DeCavalcante, Gambino, Genovese, Luchese and Scarfo
mob families, Fresolone recorded more than 400 conversations and his
own initiation into the Scarfo gang.</TE>
<TE>   Fresolone later wrote that the mob's failure to provide for his
wife and children while he served state time on a bookmaking
conviction was a major factor behind his decision to turn state's
evidence. His testimony led to 40 convictions and pleas, though not
every defendant was sent to prison, Newsome said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the most effective cooperating witness we ever had,"
Newsome said. "He was a home run for us."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Fresolone accused the popular HBO series "The
Sopranos," which is set in New Jersey, of stealing ideas on a mob
initiation ceremony from his book. HBO denied the claim.</TE>

<HD>Volunteers Are Backbone of Home-Building Group</HD>
<DH>Ventura County: Hundreds have helped Habitat for Humanity
move low-income families into houses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARRI KARUHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After 40 years as an executive in the aerospace industry, Milton
Radant thought it was time to give back to the community.</LD>
<LD>   In 1996, he started volunteering for Habitat for Humanity of
Ventura County, using his skills in research and development to find
vacant land for construction of affordable homes. He now scours maps
and drives local roads, contacting landowners and government agencies
to see if they are willing to donate property.</LD>
<LD>   The Simi Valley man also makes sure that the land can be built
upon--that there are no easement problems and that a site is close to
schools for future owners with children.</LD>
<TE>   "It's like trying to solve a mystery. Is it for sale? Is it not?
Is it really suitable? Where is the person with the money?" said
Radant, 69, chairman of the site selection committee. "The enjoyment
is trying to connect all those pieces together and getting a deal. I
get my kicks out of that process."</TE>
<TE>   Radant is among 300 volunteers who help make the local
organization tick. They pour concrete, hammer nails and install
drywall. They operate backhoes and dump trucks, and hire contractors
to perform specialized tasks, such as installing vinyl flooring and
rain gutters. They also run ReStore, a retail store in Oxnard that
sells new and used building materials.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1983, volunteers have helped 23 low-income families move
into their own homes in Piru, Camarillo, Oak View and Thousand Oaks.
The group is building a home in Santa Paula, and construction is
underway on a 22-home subdivision in Piru.</TE>
<TE>   The group also plans to build homes in Simi Valley and Oxnard,
where officials recently agreed to donate 12,500 square feet of land
for the construction of two or three homes at C Street and Robert
Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   The land in Oxnard, appraised at $54,000, contains several old
water wells that are no longer in use. Oxnard officials declared the
land surplus and deeded it to the organization--a move expected to
help the city meet a state-mandated goal of providing 492 affordable
housing units by 2005.</TE>
<TE>   City officials say the donation is worth it.</TE>
<TE>   "Many families are overcrowded, living with relatives or families.
Some are living in garages," said Ernie Whitaker, Oxnard's housing
rehabilitation program manager. "What we're trying to do is create
housing so people can move out of those crowded conditions."</TE>
<TE>   Annette Houchin oversees the local chapter, managing its finances
and building contracts and performing other administrative duties.
She has been with the organization five years, working her way up
from office manager to executive director.</TE>
<TE>   Her goal is to build seven homes this year--a target she said is
attainable.</TE>
<TE>   "If it wasn't for the volunteers, and donations, we would fail,"
said Houchin, 38.</TE>
<TE>   The local chapter raises about $500,000 annually in
donations--money that goes toward labor and construction not donated
by the community. Most volunteers contact the chapter directly to
offer their time. They include college students, corporate
executives, retired contractors and members of the nearby naval base.</TE>
<TE>   Elden Sandy, a retired electrical engineer from Camarillo, wanted
to keep busy and do something creative after he retired in 1997. He
signed up with Habitat for Humanity, and now works as the group's
volunteer construction coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   "I always had a dream to be a philanthropist, but the financial
end of it didn't work out for me," said Sandy, 60. "Here, I am able
to do that with my time, which is probably just as good."</TE>
<TE>   The average cost of a house ranges from $63,000 for a
three-bedroom home to $70,000 for five bedrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Families must meet certain requirements to be eligible. They must
go through rigorous background and credit checks, as well as personal
interviews to show they can meet a 20-year mortgage commitment.</TE>
<TE>   A family of four cannot have a household income of more than
$35,900, while a family of three cannot earn more than $32,300.
Families also must show they are living in substandard housing.</TE>
<TE>   Those selected get a 20-year interest-free mortgage with monthly
payments of about $450. A $750 down payment is required to move in.
They also must attend a series of workshops on how to balance a
checkbook, the dangers of credit card debt, and performing small
repairs.</TE>
<TE>   Future owners must also volunteer at least 500 hours to help build
their homes.</TE>
<TE>   Connie Gutierrez, a mother of three daughters, helped paint and
dig trenches for her three-bedroom house in Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, she was forced to move out of a house she had shared with
her husband. The homemaker and mother had no savings or professional
training. So she went on welfare and attended classes at Golden State
College in hopes of becoming an optician.</TE>
<TE>   For the next three years, Gutierrez and her daughters, then ages
4, 5 and 9, bounced from apartment to apartment, subletting a single
room in already cramped, sometimes lice-infected living conditions.
They shared a bed and prepared their meals in a microwave. Gutierrez
read them the Bible and took them to the beach when she could,
reassuring her children that somehow their situation was only
temporary.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, with the help of Habitat, she was able to move her family
into their own home.</TE>
<TE>   "I find it amazing that strangers were willing to help me that
way. These people didn't want anything," said Gutierrez, 38, a credit
reporting specialist for a mortgage company. "It was a miracle."</TE>
<TE>   Anyone interested in volunteering or donating money to Habitat for
Humanity of Ventura County can contact the organization at (805)
485-6065.</TE>

<LD>An unattended piece of luggage left at the Los Angeles International
Airport forced an evacuation that lasted nearly two hours Sunday
afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   A Los Angeles Police Department bomb squad was dispatched to the
airport at 12:29 p.m. to examine the contents of a green backpack
left inside the lower level of the airport's Terminal 1, said Gabby
Pacheco, an airport spokeswoman.</LD>
<LD>   As the bomb squad worked, the lower level of the terminal, which
mainly houses Southwest Airlines, was cleared. Scores of people were
led outside the building. Passengers leaving airplanes landing at the
terminal were moved to the back of the concourse.</LD>
<TE>   Shortly after 2 p.m., the evacuation was called off when police
found no explosives in the backpack.</TE>

<DH>Housing: City program assists low-income, first-time buyers
in securing loans with only a small down payment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Construction worker Robert Olmos sat on his throne--a beige
couch--and nodded in approval as he surveyed his new domain. At 52,
for the first time in his life, he is a homeowner.</LD>
<LD>   "I've been in apartments all my life, and now it's like I won the
lottery," said Olmos, who recently took ownership of a Pacoima
condominium on Osborne Street. "Now I can say this is mine."</LD>
<LD>   But it wouldn't have been his without HOMEWORKS!, a city program
designed to help low-income, first-time buyers purchase and
rehabilitate homes, condos and townhouses.</LD>
<TE>   Olmos rented the two-bedroom, two-bath condominium for five years
and the landlord had offered to sell it to him several times. But
Olmos, who makes about $30,000 a year, could never afford to purchase
the $98,000 unit. He had tried traditional lenders but never
qualified.</TE>
<TE>   Then his nephew told him about Los Angeles Neighborhood Housing
Services, a nonprofit lender and community developer dedicated to
building stronger neighborhoods through homeownership.</TE>
<TE>   "He came to the Pacoima office and said he wanted information
about buying a home," said Jorge Valle, a coordinator at the housing
services. "I told him about some programs that might help him. He was
a little skeptical."</TE>
<TE>   But thanks to Neighborhood Housing Services, and HOMEWORKS!, which
the agency helps administer, Olmos qualified for a loan to
purchase--and an additional $20,000 for improvements.</TE>
<TE>   That's not all. Olmos will pay no interest. He will be required to
repay in full only if he sells the house or refinances within 30
years.</TE>
<TE>   "Like any traditional lender, we evaluate the client's credit
history, income, employment and residency status," said Jerry Munson,
senior credit officer of Neighborhood Housing Services, headquartered
near USC. "People who normally couldn't afford to, now can have a
house."</TE>
<TE>   The program began in 1997, and three years later the loan maximum
was increased from $35,000 to $75,000. Since then, 30 loans have been
approved throughout the city. To qualify, a family of four cannot
have an annual income of more than $44,100, which is 80% of the
county's median family income.</TE>
<TE>   The buyer must pay a 3% down payment and closing costs. But if the
buyer attends eight hours of home buyers' education courses, only 1%
is required. Olmos' down payment was less than $900.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the best thing since sliced bread," said Doug Smith of the
Los Angeles Housing Department. "We make home buyers' dreams come
true for people who normally could not afford to buy a home."</TE>
<TE>   Six other lenders are part of the HOMEWORKS! program: Allwest
Mortgage in North Hollywood, Cal Fed Bank in Bell Gardens, California
Bank and Trust in Torrance, Family Savings Bank in the Crenshaw
district, Hawthorne Savings in Gardena and Irwin Mortgage in Long
Beach and Carson. The purchased properties must be in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't understand why more people don't know about this
program," Olmos said.</TE>
<TE>   Word of mouth about the loans is slowly spreading, Valle said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like there's a rich uncle out there and no one knows about
him," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Being a homeowner, it makes you want to be more involved in the
community," said Olmos. "It's not like you're just passing through.
Now I'm stuck here in Pacoima. But that's a good thing."</TE>

<HD>Bakersfield to Put Its Trust in God</HD>
<DH>City Hall: After a spirited church-state debate, council
votes to post the U.S. motto.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTINA BOXALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BAKERSFIELD</DL>
<LD>BAKERSFIELD -- Sometime in the next few months, letters proclaiming
"In God We Trust" will be affixed to the brick-and-metal walls of
City Hall.</LD>
<LD>   That the City Council of church-filled Bakersfield decided to
place the national motto on a public building is no surprise. "We are
doing something great tonight," the councilwoman who suggested the
posting said when it was overwhelmingly approved a few weeks ago.</LD>
<LD>   More remarkable has been the public debate that accompanied her
proposal, the letters to the local paper condemning it and the fact
that it was not supported by the mayor, a well-known business owner
who has lived here most of his 61 years.</LD>
<TE>   The dissension reflects the changing nature of a town that is
deeply rooted in oil, agriculture and the Bible Belt--but now also
has a Hindu temple and a mosque. It mirrors as well some national
uncertainty over how and where to draw the line between church and
state.</TE>
<TE>   Even as President Bush laces his speeches with references to God
and the battle against evil, a Central Valley city proud of its
conservatism and religious faith cannot completely agree on whether
to attach the Lord's name to its main municipal building.</TE>
<TE>   "I was brought up in a Christian home. I certainly believe in
God," Mayor Harvey Hall said recently, sitting in his City Hall
office a few feet from a large color photograph of himself with
George W. and Laura Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "But as mayor I felt it was necessary to put my personal feelings
aside and comment on what I thought best for the people of
Bakersfield," he said. "This is a divisive issue. We had segments of
a number of faiths on both sides."</TE>
<TE>   Hall did not vote on posting the motto. As mayor, he only casts a
vote when there is a tie on the council. This matter passed 6 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   Strong Opinions on Both Sides</TE>
<TE>   City Hall received about 1,200 signatures in favor of the
proposal, and more than a dozen residents appeared before the council
to urge approval.</TE>
<TE>   But there was also passionate disagreement.</TE>
<TE>   About 10 residents spoke against the posting at the council
meeting. And the Bakersfield Californian has printed a slew of
letters on the topic, many of them strongly worded protests.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really interesting to see supporters argue for the motto
with such fanaticism. But why?" wrote one man. "Because they want
nothing more than to impose their religious ideas in any way
possible. Do not say it promotes unity. It is a lie."</TE>
<TE>   Wrote another: "Putting signs up with God's name on government
buildings cheapens religious values, rather than sanctifying them."
Others described the motto placement "an appalling idea," and an
"insidious and unprincipled proposal."</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Jacquie Sullivan, author of the proposal, said she
was surprised by the opposition. "We're a conservative community,"
she said. But she is also sure most of the people of Bakersfield will
be happy to see the phrase on City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   After all, she and others point out, "In God We Trust" has been
the national motto since the 1950s and been stamped on American coins
since the Civil War. Religious wording is chiseled into the stone of
federal buildings in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "I listen to a Christian radio station," said Sullivan, a real
estate agent. "I heard about a year ago that back East they have
these mottos. It's very obvious the [nation's] framers depended on
God."</TE>
<TE>   A new Michigan law encourages placement of "In God We Trust" on
public buildings.</TE>
<TE>   The Virginia legislature just passed a bill requiring the state's
public schools to post the phrase in a prominent place. Some school
boards in Florida have done the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan said she was somewhat shaken by criticism that the
posting is divisive, but she has been applauded by many.</TE>
<TE>   "We are so concerned in not wanting to exclude, we have given up a
lot of our heritage and the right to hold firm and stand firm for
what the majority believes in," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Praise, Pillory for Dissenter</TE>
<TE>   Sue Benham was the only council member to vote against the motto
placement.</TE>
<TE>   Some townspeople have thanked her, said she deserves a medal for
her courage, scolded her that she will not receive God's blessing and
warned her she will never be reelected.</TE>
<TE>   A part-time public defender who has lived in Bakersfield since
1980, Benham has been in office less than two years. She said that if
her vote costs her reelection, she can live with it. "It would be OK
because I really believe in the principle of keeping religion and
civil matters separate."</TE>
<TE>   The motto, she said, "represents a mainstream Christian viewpoint.
And because it does, it's inappropriate to place on a civic building.
I felt there was a downside, excluding good citizens in our
community."</TE>
<TE>   Bakersfield's 247,000 residents are still predominantly Christian.
But as the city grows, it is becoming more diverse. The legacy of
Dust Bowl immigrants has been diluted by new arrivals from outside
the region and the country.</TE>
<TE>   Along with Baptist, Assembly of God and Pentecostal churches,
Bakersfield has a Hindu temple, a Sikh temple and an Islamic center.</TE>
<TE>   When more than 5,000 people gathered in town for a prayer service
for the victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Muslim, Sikh and
Hindu clergy spoke along with Christians and Jews.</TE>
<TE>   The Muslim, Hindu and Sikh communities did not join in discussion
of whether City Hall should bear God's name. Indeed, in an interview,
Sayed Rashed, imam of the Bakersfield Islamic Center, said local
Muslims have no objection to installing the motto. "I support it. I
wish everybody believes in God."</TE>
<TE>   The broadening spectrum of local faiths and ethnicities was
nonetheless a factor in the debate.</TE>
<TE>   When the motto proposal emerged, said the Rev. Jenell Mahoney of
the First Congregational Church, "It felt a little bit like
sensitivities to other perspectives were kind of challenged."</TE>
<TE>   She said she spoke against it, "not wanting to do anything that
would drive the community apart."</TE>
<TE>   At the Canyon Hills Assembly of God, one of the largest churches
in town, with 2,000 members, Associate Pastor Steven Vinson fished a
coin from his desk drawer and held it up. He said he could not
understand objections to posting a religious phrase imprinted on the
national currency.</TE>
<TE>   "The only group it would be a challenge for is atheists, maybe
agnostics. And that represents a very small segment of society....
It's part of our heritage."</TE>
<TE>   He said he was a bit amazed the motto became an issue in
Bakersfield: "Even in this city, we're probably not as conservative
as we were 20 years ago. "</TE>

<HD>Community, Landless Tribe in Dispute</HD>
<DH>Housing: Indians want to buy acreage, build homes.
Neighbors fear a loss of rural lifestyle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WINDSOR, Calif.</DL>
<LD>The tiny Lytton Band of Pomo Indians suffers from an identity crisis.</LD>
<LD>   With no reservation, few assets and a staggering unemployment
rate, the Native American nation of 230 must hold tribal meetings in
shabby rented community centers. Traditionally private outdoor
ceremonials are staged in a public park, where tourists gawk and snap
pictures.</LD>
<LD>   One of a dozen landless California tribes, the Sonoma County band
says this lack of spiritual center has caused members to drift from
their culture like smoke from a fire.</LD>
<TE>   All they want is to buy 50 acres and build four dozen homes, a
cultural center and ceremonial lodge to re-root a way of life that
dates back centuries in this wooded region an hour north of San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "Land represents something sacred among Indians," said tribal
Chairwoman Margie Mejia. "Without land of your own, there's no place
to practice your culture. You become nothing but a stepchild, a black
sheep."</TE>
<TE>   Yet people already living near where the Lyttons want to build
fear an identity crisis of their own.</TE>
<TE>   Residents say the development would violate Sonoma County's
low-density general plan, bringing a host of environmental problems
to an area prized for its rustic character.</TE>
<TE>   They say local officials are being bullied into considering the
development out of a politically correct notion that the federal
government wrongly seized other land from the Lyttons 43 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Residents such as Deborah Bailey say the housing development would
amount to a public eyesore.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to live next to an Indian reservation, at least not
like the ones I've seen," she said. "They're not very pretty. There's
garbage, abandoned refrigerators and old vehicles strewn all over."</TE>
<TE>   It's a conflict as old as the West: a divisive struggle over the
control of land, in this case complicated by an undercurrent of race
and the specter of casino gambling.</TE>
<TE>   To pay for the housing development, the Lyttons hope to turn a
defunct card room in nearby Contra Costa County into a Las
Vegas-style casino.</TE>
<TE>   Windsor residents fear that the Lyttons won't stop there. Once the
tribe gains control of any Sonoma County property, they say, it can
declare the land sovereign territory and build whatever it
pleases--including another casino.</TE>
<TE>   Residents collected 2,000 signatures against the Lytton
development and gained support from the Windsor Town Council.
Everyone knows, however, that the final decision will come from the
federal Bureau of Indian Affairs. And that angers resident Ed
Amormino, who fears that the tribe will be favored.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody will stand up for us," said the 64-year-old computer
software executive. "Not our congressman or anyone else. They're all
afraid of appearing anti-Indian, so they're playing politics."</TE>
<TE>   Windsor Mayor Sam Salmon admits feeling some "white man's guilt."</TE>
<TE>   "We forget this was once their land," Salmon said of the tribe.
"Instead, we grouse about them wanting to build casinos on what
little stake they have left."</TE>
<TE>   Mejia acknowledges that the Lytton proposal exceeds community
density standards. But she says residents are using the issue as a
convenient roadblock.</TE>
<TE>   "White settlers didn't consider the Indian general plan when they
moved here. They steamrolled right over it," she said. "General plans
have been broken in the past--just not by Indians."</TE>
<TE>   And she bristles at criticism over the tribe's funding.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish we didn't have to run a casino to buy this land," she
said. "But you tell me what other way a tribe with no assets can make
that kind of money. If they gave us back the vineyard land, we
wouldn't need to build a casino."</TE>
<TE>   Crippled by double-digit unemployment, many of the tribe's
families rent apartments, but some resort to homeless shelters or
even sleeping in their cars. Only one owns a house. Especially
embarrassing, the Lyttons say, is that the tribe cannot properly care
for its elders.</TE>
<TE>   The 45-year-old Mejia has emerged as the tribe's emotional center.
A former congressional aide, she has used her political acumen to
solicit financial backing and legal counsel and to hire a public
affairs firm to help make the Lyttons' case.</TE>
<TE>   She says the lack of land touches a nerve that makes the Lyttons
"sad to the point of anger." When meeting with other tribes, Mejia
blanches when the question inevitably comes: "So where exactly is
your land?" She is determined to soon respond: "Windsor."</TE>
<TE>   "These people don't know what they're up against," she said of the
residents. "My grandmother used to say that my tongue was so sharp it
could cut my lip. And I'm not backing down on this."</TE>
<TE>   'We Don't Owe These People Anything'</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors reject Mejia's claim to any Sonoma County land,
questioning the recognition of her ancestors as a legitimate tribe:
"We don't owe these people anything," fumes resident Roger Branscomb.</TE>
<TE>   The roots of the clash date back to the 1930s when Bert Steele,
Mejia's great-grandfather, and another family worked a 50-acre parcel
in the fertile Alexander Valley. Known as the Lytton Rancheria, the
land was held in trust by the federal government as part of a Native
American reparations effort.</TE>
<TE>   But that changed in 1959, when the Eisenhower administration
pursued a new policy of "assimilating" tribes into mainstream white
culture: As a result, the Lyttons and dozens of other small tribes
statewide were stripped of their federal recognition.</TE>
<TE>   The Lyttons' land was taken out of trust and deeded to several of
Steele's surviving ancestors. Federal officials also pledged to
install sewage systems and electricity--a promise that Mejia says
wasn't kept.</TE>
<TE>   What happened next remains unclear. But within a few years, the
land was either sold or lost in bankruptcy or foreclosure. Mejia says
rancheria proceeds went to pay back taxes that the tribe was never
told it was responsible for.</TE>
<TE>   After the Lyttons and other tribes sued the U.S. government over
their loss of recognition, a federal court reinstated their tribal
status--with the Lyttons settling their case in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   But gone for good was the Alexander Valley land--now home to some
of the region's most valuable vineyards. Mejia can only drive past
the battlefield rows of grapes and wistfully recall the past.</TE>
<TE>   She says the tribe deserves some leeway in replacing the land it
lost.</TE>
<TE>   A Philadelphia financial backer who is assisting the Lyttons in
their Contra Costa casino effort has purchased an option on 50 Sonoma
County acres near a winding two-lane country road just outside
Windsor. Although the Lyttons decline to reveal the asking price for
the parcel, similar land sells for as much as $40,000 an acre. The
property has emotional value, they say, because of its proximity to
Steele's old Alexander Valley land.</TE>
<TE>   Different Version of Local History</TE>
<TE>   Everyone agrees that the West has a long history of short-changing
Native Americans over land. But California has among the poorest
records for preserving property for its Native American population,
said Carole Goldberg, director of UCLA's joint degree program in law
and American Indian studies.</TE>
<TE>   For their part, Windsor residents tell a different story about the
Alexander Valley land.</TE>
<TE>   They believe the Lytton descendants sold the parcel outright and
that it was not lost to pay taxes. They say Mejia and others
concocted claims of tribal status to take advantage of the Indian
Gaming Act of 1988, which allows Native Americans to establish
gambling only on property they owned before that year.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Rawlins, a retired Navy captain, says he researched archival
records to uncover what he calls the Lyttons' secret.</TE>
<TE>   "They were never a legal Indian tribe," he said. "A tribe is
defined as a group of Native Americans with a government structure.
The people who lived on this land were two families, that's all. Two
families doesn't make an Indian tribe."</TE>
<TE>   Rawlins says the Lyttons were only recognized as a tribe by the
1991 government settlement, giving them no claim to Sonoma County
land before 1988.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a real tear-jerker to cry about being Indians without land,"
he said. "These people are a bunch of opportunists, using a clever
ploy to cash in on public sympathy."</TE>
<TE>   Tribal attorney Tony Cohen says the 1991 federal settlement
identifies the families who lived on the Alexander Valley land in
1959 as a bona fide tribe. Those residents who question the Lyttons'
government status, he says, are showing what little they know about
Native American history.</TE>
<TE>   "They only think of Indian tribes by what they see in the movies,"
he said. "These California Indian bands were often small family
groups without a formal tribal structure. But they still met the
government's definition of what constitutes a tribe."</TE>
<TE>   As proof that they have no plans to build a casino in Windsor,
Cohen says the Lyttons will formally agree to never bring casino
gambling to the site. Before the federal government can approve
putting the Sonoma County land into trust for the Lyttons, he says,
there must be a public hearing on the environmental issues and on
balancing the Lyttons' need for housing versus the development's
effect on the county general plan.</TE>
<TE>   But Cohen added a caveat: "If the [Contra Costa County] casino
plan dies, that doesn't mean the Lyttons won't look somewhere else in
Sonoma County to develop a casino--just not on the Windsor land."</TE>
<TE>   With the help of its Philadelphia backers, the Lyttons are poised
to buy a card club in the Contra Costa County city of San Pablo,
which could bring $150 million in annual profits that would be used
to develop the Windsor site.</TE>
<TE>   'Non-Indians Just Don't Care ... '</TE>
<TE>   An act pushed through Congress in 2000 by Rep. George Miller
(D-Martinez) opened the door for the business to be declared tribal
trust land. The bill stipulated that the tribe could develop the San
Pablo casino even though it didn't own the land before 1988.</TE>
<TE>   "The move came as a result of the government's illegal termination
of the Lyttons' tribal status," tribal lawyer Cohen said. "Because if
the Lyttons weren't terminated as a tribe, they would have owned land
somewhere else [on which] to open a casino."</TE>
<TE>   The Lyttons are awaiting the result of a lawsuit filed by Bay Area
card club owners and also must negotiate a compact--or regulatory
agreement--with Gov. Gray Davis before they can operate slot machines
on the site.</TE>
<TE>   They also hope to receive a decision from the Bureau of Indian
Affairs on the Windsor development early next year.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the leader of another Sonoma County tribe summed up the
Windsor debate this way:</TE>
<TE>   "You can sing the blues about our horrible history all you want,
but non-Indians just don't care," said Greg Sarris of the Coast Miwok
Indians. "Their only concern is whether you'll bring gambling to
their backyard."</TE>
<TE>   When Mejia visited her proposed community recently, a woman yelled
obscenities from a passing car. But the Lyttons' leader remains
unfazed.</TE>
<TE>   "At stake here is the pride and quality of life of my people," she
said. "Each time a tribal member brings in a new baby for me to hold,
I tell myself: 'This child needs a culture. This child needs a place
to call its own.'"</TE>

<LD>Luis "Kid Azteca" Villanueva Paramo, 89, whose crushing left hook
helped him hold Mexico's welterweight title from 1932 until 1949,
died Saturday in Mexico City. The cause of death was not announced.</LD>
<LD>   Villanueva Paramo began his professional career in 1930 and
compiled a record of 199 wins, 39 losses and four draws before
retiring from the sport in 1957.</LD>
<LD>   He began his career fighting for prizes of 45 cents in pool halls
and saloons in some of the Mexican capital's poorest neighborhoods.</LD>
<TE>   When he was 29, Villanueva Paramo won Mexico's welterweight title.
He successfully defended the title more than 60 times over the next
17 years, finally relinquishing it voluntarily when he began training
to move up one classification and fight as a junior middleweight in
1949.</TE>
<TE>   Villanueva Paramo last stepped into the ring on March 18, 1956, at
age 51. He was knocked out in the fifth round. He retired the next
day.</TE>
<TE>   He was inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame in 1992.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Metropolitan Timotheos, 63, the Greek Orthodox leader of Corfu, who
took part in landmark Greek Orthodox talks recently at the Vatican,
died of a heart attack Friday, according to church officials in
Athens.</LD>
<LD>   Born Timotheos Trivizas on Corfu, an island in the Ionian Sea, he
was ordained a deacon in 1962 and studied theology in Britain,
Greece, Italy and the United States.</LD>
<LD>   He served as head secretary of the Holy Synod--the Greek Orthodox
Church's governing body--for three years before his election as
metropolitan of Corfu in 1984.</LD>
<TE>   Timotheos was part of a Greek Orthodox delegation that held
unprecedented meetings with Pope John Paul II and other Vatican
officials on global issues, such as bioethics and religious freedom.</TE>
<TE>   The Roman Catholic Church and some Orthodox leaders are trying to
heal a nearly 1,000-year schism between the two branches of
Christianity. The pope has visited some mostly Orthodox nations,
including Greece last year.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Delvina Dahlheimer, 113, believed to be Minnesota's oldest resident
and one of the oldest people in the world, died Wednesday at a
nursing home in Elk River, Minn.</LD>
<LD>   The daughter of French-Canadian settlers who came to Minnesota in
the mid-19th century, Dahlheimer, whose maiden name was Morrisette,
was born on Dec. 31, 1888, on a small farm in Otsego Township, south
of Elk River.</LD>
<LD>   She was married to Phillip Dahlheimer for more than 60 years, and
was a widow for almost 30 years. Her husband was 85 when he died.</LD>
<TE>   Delvina and Phillip Dahlheimer raised seven children, who in turn
produced 34 grandchildren, 102 great-grandchildren and 65
great-great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   At 100, she still picked her own berries and climbed a stepladder
to wash windows, her children said. For her centennial birthday, she
made herself a party dress and invited people over to dance.</TE>
<TE>   As she approached her final birthday last New Year's Eve,
Dahlheimer was asked by a nurse how she had managed to live so long
and so well.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing ever bothered me," she said.</TE>

<HD>After Mix-Up, Hertzberg Ponders Noble Thing to Do</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATT MORRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It had to be true, because there it was, in a Los Angeles Times
newspaper ad, right? "Hon. Robert Hertzberg, Nobel Prize Winner."</LD>
<LD>   The emeritus Assembly speaker, a Democrat from Sherman Oaks, has
made peace a few times in Sacramento, where people may think the
rancor approaches that of the Middle East. But a Nobel?</LD>
<LD>   The full-page ad congratulated a veterans group for its recent
award dinner, and listed entertainment and political figures among
its attendees and honorees, from Gray Davis to Gregory Peck.</LD>
<TE>   A man named Robert Muller was also listed as a Nobel Prize winner,
and that's a lot closer to the mark: He founded the Vietnam Veterans
of America Foundation and co-founded the International Campaign to
Ban Landmines, the ICBL. The 1997 Nobel Peace Prize went to Jody
Williams, the campaign's coordinator, and the ICBL.</TE>
<TE>   Hertzberg has not yet gotten a congratulatory call from his fellow
fictional Nobel laureate, actor Russell Crowe, who isn't a
mathematician but plays one in a movie. But Hertzberg's 12-year-old
son was the first to congratulate him, running in and giving his dad
a hug. And Hertzberg's friends have been calling and sending copies
of the ad, a correction for which was published a day or so later.</TE>
<TE>   With term limits nudging Hertzberg out of Sacramento this year,
this mix-up has gotten him to thinking about "reinventing myself....
Now I'm gonna do something bold and dynamic so I'm worthy of my
newfound honor." Maybe keep the Valley from leaving L.A.? Now that's
Peace Prize-worthy, but the people talking up Hertzberg as a possible
mayor of a new Valley city, despite his protestations against that
notion, would be so disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   What the ad giveth, it also taketh away: It misspelled the name of
the county sheriff as "Lee Bacca."</TE>
<TE>   E-Mail 'Alert' Takes Aim at Laura Chick</TE>
<TE>   E-rumors, the eighth plague of L.A. City Hall!</TE>
<TE>   First, one from something calling itself, blandly and anonymously,
"Action Alert" (no names) demanded that Angelenos "stop racism in the
city controller's office!"</TE>
<TE>   The e-mail zipping around town asked recipients to phone or e-mail
Controller Laura Chick "to stop headline-grabbing at the expense of
our community."</TE>
<TE>   "Community" in this case is shorthand code for minority groups,
and the racism bit--Chick supposedly criticizing "events by or for
people of color," including the L.A. Marathon, Magic Johnson
Foundation, Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and
others--doesn't stand up to study.</TE>
<TE>   Chick is not taking on the groups named in the e-mail. She is,
rather, investigating the semi-independent and semi-rich Department
of Water and Power, a city agency she is tempted to call the
Department of Wasteful Practices. It writes many checks to lots of
groups and events besides the ones named in the e-mail: a 75-G annual
membership to the Coliseum Commission for VIP suites, tickets and
promotional signs, $4,747 for food for the DWP's best customers,
$15,000 to feed a party to rename the DWP headquarters after the late
council President John Ferraro, and 100 thou for 24 tickets to next
month's soiree for Project Restore, the City Hall rehab project.</TE>
<TE>   Chick's office says it's received more "you go, girl!" e-mails
than any "action alert!" complaints. And Chick--sounding like the new
sheriff in a corrupt frontier town, a scenario beloved of western
movie writers--says taking on the DWP has evidently riled up some
folks.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there are a variety of ways that people involved in this
are trying to silence me.... This is an anonymous message that is
absolutely without any truth or substance, and in my mind is just one
more way that attempts are being made to silence me or scare me off."</TE>
<TE>   A Missive Misses the Mark Widely</TE>
<TE>   On a different floor, and with less sinister undertones....</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Jack Weiss is not moving to Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   The first-term councilman, who's barely lowered his hand from the
swearing-in last summer, has been caught by surprise by this e-mail
and others like it:</TE>
<TE>   "The word among the talky-talks is that Jack's wife wants to live
in Seattle, and they'll be moving there in a year," the e-mail goes.
"So, are you quitting and moving to Seattle? ... If not, somebody's
sure trying to undermine you and your rising star."</TE>
<TE>   This was all the buzz of the vote-counting room in the L.A. County
registrar-recorder's offices in Norwalk during the down-to-the-wire
wait for results in the city's 2nd District council runoff March 5,
the e-mail said. And sources? The e-mailer had it confirmed by
someone who heard it "absolutely" from someone who used to work for
veteran Rep. Howard Berman's political operation and now works for a
Los Angeles school board member.</TE>
<TE>   Practically gospel.</TE>
<TE>   The truth: Weiss has a field deputy named Ken who is getting
married this summer to a woman who lives in Seattle and Ken might
just possibly move up there--but that is one long stretch to Weiss
"absolutely" leaving town.</TE>
<TE>   Weiss' wife, Leslie Kautz, e-mailed her husband drolly that she
appreciated his willingness to go anywhere with her, "given its
potentially negative impact on your career.... I wouldn't move to
Seattle (or anywhere) on a bet! (Mammoth? now that's another story)."</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * With Wendy Greuel apparently beating Assemblyman Tony Cardenas
in L.A.'s 2nd District council election, Sacramento politicians are
now 0 for 8 in recent elections trying to win L.A. municipal office.</TE>
<TE>   * Coattails already? Bill Simon's shellacking of fellow Republican
Richard Riordan in California's gubernatorial primary is also getting
him credit for helping to pass Orange County's Measure V, creating a
new county charter that fills even brief vacancies on the Board of
Supervisors by election rather than leaving them to gubernatorial
appointment.</TE>
<TE>   * Biotech bigwig Tina S. Nova has been named chairwoman of
California's Democratic Leadership Council, the Golden State's
franchise on the "New Democrat" group that helped to move Bill
Clinton into the White House.</TE>
<TE>   * Former Clinton White House press aide Chad Griffin, who also
worked for Rob Reiner's cigarette tax initiative, will head the
celebrity-studded Rally to Save Ahmanson Ranch campaign to stop
Washington Mutual's swanky 3,050-house and retail development in the
Simi Hills of Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   * A House subcommittee on military officers' abuse of government
credit cards, a group chaired by California Republican Steve Horn,
was told that a former Navy worker in San Diego used her credit card
to spend nearly $12,000 on goods, including a computer, gift
certificates and clothes, before walking away from the debt--and
right into a better job at the Pentagon. She was never asked to repay
the government, and the U.S. attorney in San Diego declined to
prosecute, Iowa Republican Sen. Charles Grassley told the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   * Absentee ballots may have made the difference in Santa Barbara
County, obviating the need for a November runoff and evidently giving
the 50%-plus margin of victory to Sheriff's Cmdr. Jim Anderson over
retired Undersheriff Dave Dorsey and two other candidates for county
sheriff.</TE>
<TE>   * Former Atty. Gen. Janet Reno will be in L.A . on March 26 at a
Century City fund-raiser for her campaign to unseat President Bush's
brother as governor of Florida.</TE>
<TE>   * A New England Journal of Medicine story about a study of
California's prescription drug discount program for Medicare
beneficiaries reported that many elderly do not get the benefit of
the program, and said the study was conducted in part by enlisting
"Medicare beneficiaries with acting experience" to test 500
pharmacies.</TE>
<TE>   * D.C. alert: L.A. attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. opens a branch
in the nation's capital.</TE>
<TE>   You Can Quote Me</TE>
<TE>   "Richard Gere is here!"</TE>
<TE>   --A spokeswoman for Newport Beach Republican Congressman Chris
Cox, rushing to get off the phone. The actor, a devotee of Buddhism
and the Dalai Lama, had stopped by to chat up Cox, who shares Gere's
interest in Tibet, but not his ability to leave the opposite sex
completely rattled. Gere had testified at a congressional hearing
about religious freedom there.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With term limits nudging him out of Sacramento, emeritus Assembly
Speaker Bob Hertzberg says the mix-up has him thinking about
"reinventing myself."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Santa Claus, stay out: Gifts from lobbyists or just folks are
proving to be such Trojan horses for politicians that on office doors
throughout the state Capitol (some but not all), signs are popping up
with some variant of "Thanks but no thanks," or "Thanks on these
conditions.... " On the door of L.A. Democrat Rod Wright's office,
above: "We appreciate the generosity of all gifts brought to this
office. We'll also gladly accept all gifts that we can legally
receive that other members refuse." Below, La Canada Flintridge
Democrat Carol Liu's is in the just-say-no vein: "Though we
appreciate your generosity, we are not able to accept gifts. Thank
you." Ah, but campaign contributions may be another kettle of fish

<HD>Paul Runyan, 93; Golf Pro, Two-Time PGA Champion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paul Runyan, a two-time PGA Championship winner who earned the
nickname "Little Poison" for his devastating short game that often
bested longer-driving opponents, died of pneumonia Sunday at
Eisenhower Medical Center in Palm Springs. He was 93.</LD>
<LD>   One of the few surviving players of the first Masters tournament
in 1934, Runyan was a golf instructor at a Palm Desert course until
the last few weeks of his life.</LD>
<LD>   Runyan, who won an estimated 50 tournaments in his career, played
in an era that included some of the legendary names in the game,
including Byron Nelson, Gene Sarazan and Sam Snead.</LD>
<TE>   When the first Masters--then called the Augusta Invitational--was
held, he was coming off a year in which he won nine tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   Runyan tied for third with Billy Burke at 286, two shots behind
winner Horton Smith and one behind Craig Wood. The purse was $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   In 1934, he won six tournaments and the first of his two PGA
championships by beating Wood--his former tutor--1-up on the 38th
hole. (The PGA was a match-play event until 1958). Runyan was the
tour's leading money winner that year, with $6,767 after finishing 12
times in the top three.</TE>
<TE>   In 1938, he bested the longer-driving Snead for his second PGA
championship, winning 8 and 7 in match play.</TE>
<TE>   Runyan was fifth in the U.S. Open in 1941, and finished sixth in
the same tournament 10 years later.</TE>
<TE>   He played on the Ryder Cup teams in 1933 and 1935, losing in the
first but winning in both foursomes and singles two years later.</TE>
<TE>   In his later years, Runyan played on the Seniors Tour. He was
runner-up in the U.S. PGA Seniors in 1959, and won it in 1961 and
1962.</TE>
<TE>   When he wasn't playing in major tournaments, Runyan could be found
at local courses. He was the golf professional at Annandale Golf Club
in Pasadena, La Jolla Country Club, Sahalee Country Club outside
Seattle and Green Gables in Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   He was a noted teacher and expert at helping golfers with elements
of their short games.</TE>
<TE>   "If you [have] master putting, chipping and short-pitching, you've
got golf 65% to 80% whipped," he said at a mini-clinic last year.</TE>
<TE>   Former PGA champion Gene Littler, who grew up playing in La Jolla,
recalled Runyan as a player who was full of energy.</TE>
<TE>   "He would work in the shop, run out to the practice tee, run back
to the shop," Littler told Associated Press. "I never saw him walk."</TE>
<TE>   "I saw him play some marvelous shots around the green," Littler
added. "I learned a lot from him."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Hot Springs, Ark., Runyon would make money as a boy by
shagging golfers' stray shots, making a quarter for every ball he
found. As he grew older, he would sneak away from his chores on his
family's dairy farm to hone his skills on a neighboring golf course.</TE>
<TE>   By age 13, he was caddying, and he turned pro at 17. He caught on
as an assistant to club pro Craig Wood at Forest Hills Golf Course in
White Plains, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Thirteen years later, Runyan defeated Wood for his first PGA
championship.</TE>
<TE>   As he neared the age of 90, Runyan was still shooting in the
mid-70s on the 6,418-yard, par 70 Annandale course.</TE>
<TE>   "Ninety-nine percent of the time, I beat my age," he said. "I can
still have a terrible game and beat my age."</TE>
<TE>   Runyan is survived by two sons and two grandsons.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral arrangements are pending.</TE>

<HD>Mauling Death Creates an Activist</HD>
<DH>Law: To honor her late partner, Sharon Smith presses rights
issues for gays and lesbians.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Around lunchtime, Diane Whipple called Sharon Smith at her office.
Come home early, she said, so we can spend the afternoon together.
Not long after 4p.m., Sharon cleaned up her desk and called Diane to
say she was on her way. The answering machine picked up. She called
three more times while driving through San Francisco traffic. Why
isn't she answering? Where is she?</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Sharon Smith still honors her partner Diane Whipple's tender
request: Think about me every hour, on the hour.</LD>
<TE>   Smith doesn't stop thinking about her. She thinks of Whipple when
she goes running, when she sees a lacrosse game, when she looks out
her window at the San Francisco Bay. "Every single thing I do, I miss
her," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Smith tries to focus on the seven years they spent together and
not on Jan. 26, 2001--the night Whipple died after being attacked by
their neighbors' two large Presa Canario dogs outside their apartment
door.</TE>
<TE>   She keeps her television off, for fear of being reminded of the
gruesome images that still haunt her. She rereads Whipple's love
letters and meets with a grief counselor.</TE>
<TE>   And she keeps busy, spending more time in the public eye than she
ever imagined she would. In the last 14 months, Smith has appeared on
national television and has spoken at rallies and marches about gay
and lesbian rights.</TE>
<TE>   She testified before a San Francisco grand jury that later
indicted the dogs' owners, attorneys Marjorie Knoller and Robert
Noel, in her partner's mauling. Closing arguments are scheduled to
begin today in the criminal trial, which is entering its fifth week
in Los Angeles County Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   Smith also helped gain passage of state legislation allowing
same-sex partners to sue for wrongful death, a right historically
given only to surviving spouses, parents and children. She filed
civil suits against Knoller and Noel, who lived two doors down from
her and Whipple, as well as the owners of the apartment building. And
she started a foundation in Whipple's name.</TE>
<TE>   "When I think about everything that happened in 2001, I think 10
years must have passed," said Smith, 36, who is on leave from her job
as a regional vice president at the brokerage firm Charles Schwab.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said Whipple, 33, was a fighter, and Smith knew she had to
fight too.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted everyone to know that our relationship was real," she
said. "My loss is real. I'm going to hold them accountable. I am not
going to just sit here quietly and just let this go."</TE>
<TE>   Smith had never been involved in San Francisco's politically
active gay and lesbian community. But that changed. Everything
changed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Eight blocks from the apartment, Sharon saw flashing lights,
ambulances, fire engines, television vans. Police cars blocked the
garage. She double parked and sat in the car for a second,
overwhelmed by the commotion. Then she jumped out and looked up. In
the top corner unit, the lights were off and the television was on.
"Oh my God. It's her."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Whipple and Smith met through a friend in 1994. They hit it off
right away and moved in together in Palo Alto a few months later.
They vacationed frequently, traveling to Hawaii, Puerto Rico and
Europe. During one trip, they exchanged rings in a private ceremony.
If same-sex couples could marry legally in California, they would
have, Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   A few years later, Whipple was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. It
was one of the toughest times for both of them, Smith said, but it
strengthened their bond.</TE>
<TE>   They moved into an apartment in the Pacific Heights neighborhood
of San Francisco in May 1999, where they lived with their two cats,
Bootie and Shadow. Whipple liked the neighborhood but didn't consider
herself a city person and wanted to someday buy a house in the more
spacious and rural Marin County, just over the Golden Gate Bridge.</TE>
<TE>   "I probably heard that 100 times," Smith said. "Her dream house
would have had a running trail right outside."</TE>
<TE>   They both came from the East Coast, but they planned to spend the
rest of their lives in California. They had talked about raising
children together.</TE>
<TE>   Raised by her grandparents in Manhasset, N.Y., Whipple attended
Pennsylvania State University on a lacrosse scholarship. After
graduation, she played on the World Cup lacrosse team, then trained
for the 1996 Olympics track and field team, but didn't qualify.</TE>
<TE>   Feeling pressure from her family to get a job, Whipple tried a few
sales positions but decided to coach lacrosse, first at a private
high school and then at St. Mary's College in Moraga, a suburb east
of San Francisco. She was more than a coach, Smith said. "She didn't
just clock in and out. It was an extended family."</TE>
<TE>   Smith was raised with her two sisters in Maryland and graduated
from Longwood College in Virginia in 1987. Two years later, she
accepted a job at Charles Schwab in Washington, D.C., and has been
with the company since, working long hours to make her way up to an
executive position in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Both women loved dining out, hiking and going to movies. But they
weren't alike in every way.</TE>
<TE>   Whipple always remembered her friends' birthdays, while Smith
relied on an electronic organizer for important dates. The fun-loving
and silly Whipple lived for the moment while the more even-tempered
and focused Smith planned ahead, intending to retire at 45.</TE>
<TE>   "Sharon was the serious workaholic and Diane liked to goof off and
have a good time," said Sarah Miller, Whipple's friend and assistant
lacrosse coach at St. Mary's. "They kind of had a happy medium; they
complemented each other really well."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sharon was trying desperately to get anybody's attention. What
happened? Somebody said there was a robbery. The apartment manager
said Diane was bitten by a dog and was in critical condition. What
did that mean? Did she lose an arm? Will she have to give up
lacrosse? Something didn't seem right. A dog bite doesn't match up
with this scene.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The tragedy could have easily resulted in Smith, a private, quiet
person, turning inward as she grieved, said Smith's sister, Janet
Batchelder.</TE>
<TE>   "She could have stayed home and cried," said Batchelder, who
marched in San Francisco's gay pride parade with her sister. "She
could have buried her face in the sand. She didn't."</TE>
<TE>   Batchelder said she was surprised to see Smith become a
spokeswoman and advocate for lesbians.</TE>
<TE>   A week after the attack, Smith met with an attorney who told her
she could sue for wrongful death only if she were a parent or legal
spouse. That seemed unbelievable and unfair, Smith said. The attorney
told her that was the law. Smith replied, "Well, let's change the
law."</TE>
<TE>   A San Francisco assemblywoman already had proposed a bill to
expand the rights of gays and lesbians. So last spring, Smith stood
before the state Legislature and spoke out for the rights of same-sex
partners to file wrongful-death suits. Gov. Gray Davis signed the
controversial bill into law in October.</TE>
<TE>   Many lesbians started seeing Smith as a symbol of courage and
strength, said Kate Kendell, executive director of the National
Center for Lesbian Rights. Smith responded to her loss with a quiet
determination rather than anger, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no doubt that Sharon's grace and dignity and her very
honest and moving comments about her situation really have struck a
chord," said Kendell, who is also representing Smith in the civil
suits.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said Whipple is her constant inspiration--both for political
advocacy and in her personal life. Since the mauling, Smith, who
moved to a new apartment, has spent more time with family and
friends. Last summer, she went skydiving in Whipple's honor.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   At San Francisco General Hospital, a surgeon said Diane had lost
all her blood in the apartment hallway and didn't have a pulse for 23
minutes. But Diane was alive and Sharon wanted to see her. The doctor
showed the way to the intensive care unit, where Diane lay bandaged.
She was barely recognizable. She's staying alive just long enough for
me to see her and say goodbye.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said she was relieved when the trial started in Los Angeles,
where it had been moved because of publicity in the Bay Area.
Batchelder saved money for a year and left her family in Colorado to
be with Smith during the trial.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to be there for her," said Batchelder, 44. "She's pretty
independent, but she's come to depend on me more in the past year."</TE>
<TE>   Smith has had the judge's permission to be in the courtroom on
some days, and those have not been easy. She had to leave during
opening statements when photographs of Whipple's wounds were shown.
Then, last month, she took the witness stand, telling jurors that one
of the dogs had bitten Whipple a month before the fatal attack.</TE>
<TE>   During cross-examination, the defense attorney representing
Knoller asked Smith a question that she can't get out of her head:
"Do you consider that had you made a complaint, Diane Whipple might
be alive today?"</TE>
<TE>   Smith said later that she hated that question, especially because
she did wonder for months if there was anything she could have done
to prevent the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Now Smith anxiously awaits the outcome of the trial. She plans to
stay in Los Angeles until the jury reaches a verdict.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller, 46, who was charged with second-degree murder,
involuntary manslaughter and keeping a mischievous dog, faces 15
years to life if convicted. Her husband, Robert Noel, was charged
with the two lesser counts and could face a sentence of four years.
Their dogs, Bane and Hera, have been destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   Smith knows exactly what she will do when the trial is over.
Whipple had told Smith where she wanted her ashes spread: her high
school and college lacrosse fields, the Atlantic and Pacific oceans
and a mountain. All that's left is the mountain.</TE>
<TE>   When she gets home, Smith will drive to one of their favorite
spots, Mt. Tamalpais in Marin County. There, she will think of
Whipple and toss her ashes onto the mountain.</TE>
<TE>   "I owe it to her to live life as if she were here and move
forward," Smith said. "And she will be with me. She will always be
with me."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A woman, her young daughter and another girl were injured Sunday
afternoon when they were caught in the cross-fire of a drive-by
shooting in Pacoima, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The three were sitting in a parked car in the 10900 block of
Glenoaks Boulevard when a car pulled up alongside and shots were
fired at a house next to them, said Officer Don Cox of the Los
Angeles Police Department.</LD>
<LD>   The 25-year-old mother was shot in the shoulder, and shrapnel hit
her scalp. Her 2-year-old daughter suffered a bullet wound to her
chin. The two were hospitalized in serious condition. An 8-year-old
girl also suffered shrapnel wounds and was treated at the scene and
released to her family, Cox said.</LD>
<TE>   Police maintained a perimeter around the neighborhood Sunday
evening in hopes of catching the gunman or finding the car. Cox said
there were no suspect or vehicle descriptions.</TE>

<HD>Helping Women Get a New Start After Prison</HD>
<DH>Service: Through her sober living program, an ex-addict
offers a home in Watts for just-released inmates who are reclaiming
their lives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's easy to spot the women just released from prison.</LD>
<LD>   They emerge at the downtown Los Angeles bus station weary from the
long ride, some still wearing their prison denim. They carry their
belongings in garbage bags or in cardboard boxes.</LD>
<LD>   Hovering not too far away are the neighborhood drug dealers and
pimps, like vultures circling kills.</LD>
<TE>   "Do you wanna get high?" they ask. "Do you wanna come home with
me?"</TE>
<TE>   For a woman just released from prison--a woman like Susan
Burton--sometimes the offers don't seem so bad.</TE>
<TE>   Burton, now 50, made the trip back home from prison six times, and
on each bus ride she would dream of a new life far from drugs and the
street. But the temptation to get high and make quick money always
proved too hard to resist.</TE>
<TE>   She would never make it past the bus station. "Everytime I left
there, I left with a firm resolution not to be back, but I couldn't
beat the odds," Burton said.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, in 1997, she found the help she needed. She sobered up
and began working as a nurse for an elderly woman. The woman allowed
Burton to live in her home. Burton put money away for two years
before having enough to make a down payment on a modest three-bedroom
house in Watts.</TE>
<TE>   In late 1999, Burton opened the house to women with nowhere else
to go upon release from prison. A New Way of Life Reentry Home, the
name she gave to this program, provides women with housing, food and
social services until they are able to stand on their own.</TE>
<TE>   Upon their release, "these women are in the absolute
worst economic shape," said Marilyn Montenegro, a clinical social
worker who volunteers her time at A New Way of Life. "A landlord won't
rent to them; they have a bad credit report; they don't have the money
for first and last month's rent."</TE>
<TE>   The women are given $200, known as "gate money," upon release from
prison and often spend much of it for a bus ticket home. If they
don't have any family or support system, they can be left with little
more than $100 with which to start life anew.</TE>
<TE>   "They're often back in jail within the next week or so, or they're
on their parents' doorstep or their friends' doorstep making them
miserable," said Doris Mahlum, district administrator at the state
Department of Corrections.</TE>
<TE>   That's what happened to Barbara Matthews.</TE>
<TE>   "I got off the Greyhound, and there they were, asking me if I
wanted to smoke something," said Matthews, 53. "I went straight down
there [the downtown bus station] and relapsed."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't long before Matthews was back in jail, busted for trying
to sell cocaine to a plainclothes officer on skid row, where she had
lived among the city's homeless. In prison, Matthews, who cannot read
or write, had a friend type a letter to Burton asking for help.
Burton visits state prisons once a month to tell women about her
home.</TE>
<TE>   "We met and she said, 'I got your bed,'" Matthews said. "For
somebody who didn't know me to help me like that, well, I just
thought it was sweet as pie."</TE>
<TE>   Many of Burton's women come to her with no money and a host of
medical and psychological problems. A large percentage of the 68
women, ages 18 to 56, who have slept in her bunk beds are known as
dual-diagnosed cases, meaning they suffer from drug addiction and
some sort of mental illness requiring mental health services.</TE>
<TE>   And then there are the women who simply need help getting their
lives back in order. The ones who must learn to get a Social Security
card, a birth certificate, a driver's license. The ones who are
eligible for government assistance but are overwhelmed by all the
paperwork. The ones hoping to reconnect with estranged family
members.</TE>
<TE>   The women in Burton's home must pay rent, go to school or work and
attend regular 12-step meetings. Rent is $400 a month and includes
room, meals, transportation and some clothing.</TE>
<TE>   For six months after their release, the Department of Corrections
sponsors some of the women who have undergone drug treatment programs
in prison, Burton said. Others are sponsored by Walden House, a
nonprofit organization that provides social services to drug and
alcohol addicts. Burton says that many of the women who reach out to
her do not have the money to pay right away, but that they usually
work something out.</TE>
<TE>   Rent goes toward the $1,000 mortgage payment,
utilities, insurance, food and paying their cook, Ora "Mitzi" Bozart.
There are 10 beds at A New Way of Life. Eight of them are currently
occupied.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, Burton was sleeping on a futon in a small room of
the house. But a fellowship from the California Wellness Violence
Prevention Program in December has allowed her to take home a modest
monthly salary of $800, which she uses to rent an apartment down the
block. The grant gives A New Way of Life $6,000 four times a year.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County there are 400 to 500 sober living programs,
according to the Sober Living Network, a coalition of such facilities
in Southern California. Few are designed specifically for women
emerging from prison, said Donna Williams, president of the South
Central Sober Living Coalition, to which Burton belongs.</TE>
<TE>   Sober living facilities offer a structured environment for
recovering alcoholics and drug addicts. Unlike Burton's program, most
traditional sober living programs are hesitant to take clients with
mental health problems, said social worker Montenegro. And few
programs are willing to serve women who can't pay.</TE>
<TE>   Burton takes in women regardless of whether they have been in drug
treatment, recognizing that it can be difficult to get into a
treatment program while in prison. As long as they're committed to
their recovery, Burton says, she can work with them.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the women relapse, Burton said it's important to
understand that a relapse is often part of the recovery process.
That's why she gave Matthews a second chance five weeks ago. Matthews
left the house and got high on cocaine, but recognized her mistake
and called Burton from the L.A. Mission.</TE>
<TE>   "I personally understand what that's like," Burton said. "We all
make mistakes. Sometimes people slip, but that doesn't mean they're
not worthy of the support."</TE>

<HD>New GED Is Putting Takers to the Test</HD>
<DH>Education: The revised exam is harder, creating anxiety for
those seeking a high school certificate. Scoring backlog causes
delays in getting results.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA LEFF</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oxnard resident Daniel Govea, 25, knows the GED test he plans to take
later this month is much more difficult than the one offered last
year.</LD>
<LD>   But Govea, who dropped out of high school seven years ago, is
determined to get his certificate even if it means more studying.</LD>
<LD>   "It would have been easier to pass before, but I'm pretty
confident that I'll still be able to pass it," he said. "What I
really wish is that I would have just graduated from high school."</LD>
<TE>   For the first time since 1988, the General Education Development
exam has been revised to keep up with evolving high school graduation
requirements. The GED is taken by more than 50,000 Californians
annually seeking a second chance at earning a high school diploma.</TE>
<TE>   The revamped exam is bringing anxiety over its increased
difficulty, new testing procedures and scoring delays, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   The test "certainly is different, but it's also harder by design,"
said Lyn Schaefer, director of development for the GED Testing
Service at American Council on Education. "The knowledge that just
about every state was evaluating their graduation standards prompted
us to look at the [old] test and ask, 'How well does this match up
with what high school students are going to be doing in the 21st
century?'"</TE>
<TE>   The change causing the most apprehension is the move to a two-part
math test that places a greater emphasis on algebra. On the first
half, students may use a calculator, which was not permitted before,
and some math questions now require students to work through problems
rather than choosing a multiple-choice answer.</TE>
<TE>   There are also more test questions that assess both practical
knowledge and analytical ability. On the nonfiction section of the
reading test, for example, students are more likely to find a job
training manual than a theater review, while items like recipes and
nutritional content labels are part of word problems on the math
segment. And the written essay portion has taken on more significance
in overall scoring.</TE>
<TE>   Although the new test was instituted Jan. 14, most adult schools
and test centers throughout Ventura County and Southern California
have only recently started administering it.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Unified School District, for instance, which
operates the state's largest GED testing center, offered it for the
first time two weeks ago. Simi Valley Adult School has scheduled its
first testing session later this month.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Edmunds, associate analyst for the California GED Office,
said difficulty in obtaining student workbooks, practice tests and
other preparation materials forced delays at many schools.</TE>
<TE>   Many people opted to take the old GED exam before it was retired
on Dec. 31. Edmunds estimates that nearly 70,000 people took the GED
in California last year, a 20% jump over the number of test-takers in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   The GED Testing Service warned test-takers who may have passed one
or more sections of the old test that they would not be permitted to
roll over their scores once the new exam was introduced. Coupled with
publicity over the new test's increased rigor, virtually every test
site in the region saw a flurry of last-minute test-takers.</TE>
<TE>   "We sent out letters starting in June to anybody who has taken the
GED with us during the last 10 years, and in September we had this
huge rush," said Linda Sugino, GED testing examiner at Oxnard Adult
School. "I was testing almost every day through November and
December, and we had full houses every night."</TE>
<TE>   Some test sites have started spreading the 7 1/2-hour test over
two or more days as part of the changeover. Bill Macri, chief GED
examiner at Simi Valley Adult School, said a new eight-page, pretest
demographic survey made it less feasible to allow test-takers to
complete the entire exam in one sitting.</TE>
<TE>   But officials say the switch to the new test has gone smoothly.
Sugino recently received her first round of scores and says she was
pleasantly surprised by the results.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a bit leery because of the new testing form, but they did
well, better than I was expecting," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Edmunds, of the California GED Office, says it is too early to say
what effect the more difficult exam is having on passing rates.
Preliminary results show that test-takers are struggling the most
with the math and writing portions, just as they did with the old
test, she said.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the main problem the new test has created is a scoring
backlog that has increased the amount of time test-takers have to
wait for their results--and, if they passed, their diplomas--from
about two weeks to a month or longer.</TE>
<TE>   Edmunds said state officials are working to speed up the
processing of scores and in certain emergency situations, have been
able to give candidates whose futures rest on whether they passed at
least verbal confirmation on their standing.</TE>
<TE>   "In some cases, it can mean the difference between financial aid
or not, and it can mean the difference between getting a job or not,"
Edmunds said. "For the person taking the exam, it means whether they
can get on with their life."</TE>

<HD>Welfare Plan Could Squeeze State Budget</HD>
<DH>Finances: The Bush proposal would force recipients to work
more, boosting the demand for state-funded child care.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration's plan to bolster work requirements for
welfare recipients could cost California hundreds of millions of
dollars even as the state faces a huge budget shortfall, welfare
advocates say.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush's plan, floated last month, would require more
welfare recipients to hold jobs and work longer hours. In proposing
the changes, Bush said he is seeking "to return an ethic of work to
an important place in all American lives."</LD>
<LD>   Critics contend that it would increase the demand for child-care
assistance at a time when California can ill afford new expenses.</LD>
<TE>   "We think the effect [of the Bush proposal] on Stage 1 child care
could be as much as $400 million annually," said David Carroll,
project director for the California Budget Project, a nonpartisan
advocacy group for the poor.</TE>
<TE>   Participants in CalWORKS, the state's welfare-to-work program, use
Stage 1 child care when they enter the program, which provides cash
grants and services to needy families.</TE>
<TE>   Welfare Reform Test to Expire</TE>
<TE>   Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson cited the high
cost of the war on terrorism and declining welfare rolls during a
hearing last week in Washington as reasons that the president's
proposal does not include additional federal funding for child care.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush proposal comes as the nation's six-year experiment in
welfare reform is set to expire this year and Congress begins a fresh
review of the federal government's welfare policy.</TE>
<TE>   In California, Gov. Gray Davis wants to overhaul the state's child
care programs because he is concerned that CalWORKS has resulted in a
flood of new high child-care costs. The costs, he contends, are
depriving needy families who have never been on welfare of government
help with their child-care bills.</TE>
<TE>   There are 200,000 to 300,000 poor children now on waiting lists
for subsidized care through the state's traditional programs. To
serve more children, Davis has proposed increasing co-payments for
child care and lowering state reimbursements to child-care providers,
among other changes.</TE>
<TE>   Critics fear that the changes will erode care and cause some
families to go back on welfare. The Bush proposal, they add, will
only make matters worse.</TE>
<TE>   Deeper Cuts Are Feared</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Fuller, a UC Berkeley professor of education and public
policy, said that unless Congress demands that Bush bolster federal
funding for child care, the state could be forced to make deeper cuts
in reimbursement rates or loosen quality standards.</TE>
<TE>   "With no new federal money to serve the additional moms that have
to work, that would probably mean a second big hit on quality,"
Fuller said.</TE>
<TE>   The state independent legislative analyst's office is trying to
gauge the amount of new costs associated with Bush's plan. That
report is expected next month.</TE>
<TE>   "There could be substantial costs to implementing the Bush
proposal in California," said Todd Bland, social services director
for the analyst's office.</TE>
<TE>   State officials are whittling away at a projected $17.5-billion
shortfall in the state budget. So far, they've addressed about $4
billion of the problem through spending cuts and budget adjustments,
and by refinancing the state's debt.</TE>
<TE>   California faces the prospect of ongoing operating shortfalls of
$7billion in each of the two fiscal years starting in July 2003,
according to the analyst's office.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Bush plan, seven in 10 welfare recipients would be
required to hold jobs by 2007, up from the current three in 10.
Recipients would also be required to work 40 hours a week, up from
30.</TE>
<TE>   The budget project's Carroll said that the 40-hour week would
require 24 hours of direct work and that the remaining 16 hours could
be spent in programs meant to aid a recipient's long-term job
prospects.</TE>
<TE>   Patricia Craig, who lobbies in Washington for the County Welfare
Directors Assn. of California, said the Bush plan could force
counties to cut employment services designed to help recipients hold
jobs, such as transportation assistance and counseling for substance
abuse, and plow those funds into child care.</TE>
<TE>   California could face penalties if Bush's plan is approved and the
state fails to meet its provisions, said Shervin Boloorian, a
legislative analyst with the California Institute for Federal Policy
Research, a think tank that advises the state's congressional
delegation.</TE>
<TE>   "In a year where we're threatened with a budget crunch, this is
probably the last thing that people on assistance want to hear,"
Boloorian said.</TE>

<HD>William Witney, 86; B-Movie Action Director</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>William Witney, the Republic Pictures action director who made the
studio's greatest cliffhanger serials during its B-movie heyday in
the 1930s and '40s and introduced the now-standard practice of
choreographing fight scenes, died Sunday in a nursing home in
Jackson, Calif. He was 86.</LD>
<LD>   Witney, who had been in ill health since suffering a stroke in
1995, died of complications from that stroke and several subsequent
ones.</LD>
<LD>   A specialist in outdoor action and stunt direction, Witney
directed or co-directed 23 of Republic's best-known serials between
1937 and 1946, including "The Lone Ranger," "Spy Smasher," "Perils of
Nyoka," "Drums of Fu Manchu," "Adventures of Captain Marvel,"
"Zorro's Fighting Legion" and "Dick Tracy vs. Crime, Inc."</LD>
<TE>   Witney also directed 27 Roy Rogers westerns from 1946 to 1951, a
period in which he diminished the musical content of the Rogers films
in favor of more serious story lines.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody considers Bill Witney the greatest action director in B
movies," said Boyd Magers, editor and publisher of Western Clippings
magazine.</TE>
<TE>   "He just knew how to put things together for the screen--the
fights, the wagon wrecks, the falls off the cliffs, whatever; they
were just expertly done," Magers said.</TE>
<TE>   Witney's Republic serials served as the inspiration for Steven
Spielberg's "Indiana Jones" movies. And director Quentin Tarantino, a
Witney fan, has praised his rough and believable action scenes and
visual style in films such as "The Golden Stallion" with Rogers and
"Stranger at My Door," a western starring Macdonald Carey.</TE>
<TE>   "I've found directors of some of these movies who I'm really into,
but William Witney is ahead of them all, the one whose movies I can
show to anyone and they are just blown away," Tarantino told the New
York Times in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   In an era dominated by John Ford, Howard Hawks and other legendary
directors of "A" pictures, Witney was not publicly heralded during
his prime.</TE>
<TE>   "The people in the industry knew what he was doing, but being at
Republic, you didn't get the notoriety directors got at the major
studios," Magers said.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Lawton, Okla., in 1915, he moved with his family to
California when he was an infant. After graduating from Coronado High
School, he enrolled in a small school in San Diego to help him cram
for his entrance exams for the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, where
he had an appointment for 1934.</TE>
<TE>   But after a 1933 trip to Hollywood to visit his sister, he never
made it to Annapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Witney's brother-in-law was a serial director for Mascot Pictures,
a Poverty Row production studio that specialized in cliffhanger
serials. Witney became an office boy at the studio.</TE>
<TE>   After Mascot merged into the newly formed Republic Pictures two
years later, he was promoted to script clerk and then to film editor.</TE>
<TE>   In 1937, while Witney was working on the Utah location of the "The
Painted Stallion," the serial's director was removed and Witney was
asked to take over the project. He was 21.</TE>
<TE>   Witney's most frequent co-director on the serials was John
English, who preferred directing the interior dialogue scenes and
having Witney handle the action scenes.</TE>
<TE>   "John was a boudoir man," Witney recalled years later. "I'm an
outdoor man and a good horseman. So even though I could do good
boudoir stuff, when we worked together, I mostly shot the action and
outdoor scenes."</TE>
<TE>   Witney also worked frequently with legendary stuntman Yakima
Canutt, best known for a stunt in Ford's "Stagecoach," in which he
plays an Indian who leaps from a running horse to the lead horse of
the coach team, is then shot and dragged beneath the racing coach.</TE>
<TE>   The legendary stunt was nothing new to Witney.</TE>
<TE>   "We did that in serials 10 times with Yak," Witney said. "It was
Yak who brought the idea to Ford...."</TE>
<TE>   Witney learned to choreograph screen fights after watching
choreographer-turned-director Busby Berkeley rehearse a dance number
at Warner Bros.</TE>
<TE>   As related in his 1996 memoir, "In a Door, Into a Fight, Out a
Door, Into a Chase," Witney said he was never satisfied with the way
movie fights were shot.</TE>
<TE>   In those days, the stuntmen more or less had a free-for-all as
they mixed it up in front of the camera.</TE>
<TE>   "The fights always seemed to be OK for the first punch," Witney
wrote. "Then the stuntmen were always out of place for the next
punch. By the time three or four minutes had passed, the stuntmen
were out of breath, scattered all over the set and seemed to be
staggering around waiting for someone to hit them."</TE>
<TE>   Then Witny watched Berkeley at work filming a sequence with 40
dancers.</TE>
<TE>   "He was lining up all the girls for just one little movement,"
Witney recalled in an interview. "He got it perfect. Then he sent
them back to rehearse another little movement, shot it, and then
maybe a few close-ups later to put in between those shots."</TE>
<TE>   Borrowing Berkeley's method, Witney began filming fight sequences
by breaking them into shorter segments, changing camera angles and
including close-ups for greater audience impact.</TE>
<TE>   Stuntmen today continue the tradition begun by Witney, but now
they are under the direction of stunt coordinators.</TE>
<TE>   "Doing the choreography ahead of time actually speeded up and got
much better-looking fights and were better for editing," said Loren
Janes, a veteran stunt coordinator who has worked with Witney.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill was a fabulous director with a great sense of action and
what it takes to do it," Janes said. "He had close contact directly
with the stuntmen and got a lot of ideas from them. He just had a
natural sense of action and where to put the camera, and he
understood the physical aspects and the danger, and knew what was
possible and wasn't."</TE>
<TE>   After serving in a Marine combat photography unit in World War II,
Witney returned to Republic, where he directed his last serial, "The
Crimson Ghost," in 1946, and took over directing 27 Roy Rogers
westerns.</TE>
<TE>   "He changed the whole complexion of Roy's pictures," Magers said.
"Roy's pictures had been very musical, 'Oklahoma'-oriented and had
gotten away from the action content, and when Bill came along in the
late '40s to direct Roy's pictures, he really put a life back in them
and just rejuvenated Roy and gave him a whole new life on the
screen."</TE>
<TE>   In the '50s, Witney directed nine westerns with singing cowboy Rex
Allen and dozens of episodes of Republic's television series such as
"Stories of the Century" and "Frontier Doctor," starring Allen.</TE>
<TE>   After Republic ceased production in 1956, Witney moved to American
International Pictures, where he directed "The Bonnie Parker Story"
starring Dorothy Provine in 1958; and "Paratroop Command," a
realistic World War II adventure.</TE>
<TE>   Also Worked in Television</TE>
<TE>   He also worked steadily in television, his credits including "Sky
King," "Zorro," "Bonanza," "Tales of Wells Fargo," "Laramie," "The
Virginian," "The Wild Wild West" and "The High Chaparral."</TE>
<TE>   Witney's first wife, Maxine Doyle Witney, died in 1973 after 35
years of marriage. Remarried in 1977, Witney and his wife, Beverly,
moved to the northern California town of Pioneer.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife; a son, John of Truckee, Calif.; and a
stepson, Larry Trouba of San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial services are pending.</TE>

<HD>The Letterman Fiasco Holds a Lesson for Disney</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM ROSENSTIEL and BILL KOVACH</AU>
<BD>Tom Rosenstiel and Bill Kovach are the authors of "The
Elements of Journalism: What Newspeople Should Know and the Public
Should Expect" (Three Rivers Press, 2002).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the sake of argument, put the public interest aside. Forget that
broadcast airwaves are public property.</LD>
<LD>   Strictly in economic terms, the Walt Disney Co. got lucky when it
failed to woo David Letterman to join ABC. The public nature of the
Letterman embarrassment has granted Disney something rare in
business--a second chance.</LD>
<LD>   It is a moment not unlike the one General Electric, another
nonbroadcaster, had a decade ago after the network it owns, NBC,
faked news footage of exploding pickup trucks on "Dateline." The
humiliation shook GE into approaching the network business
differently--starting with news. That turnaround is now the key to
the NBC's fortunes.</LD>
<TE>   Disney could have a similar awakening. To meet its fiduciary
responsibility to shareholders, Disney should either recognize that
it does not understand the broadcast TV business and drastically
change the way it manages ABC. Or it should divest itself of the
network while it still has marketable value.</TE>
<TE>   Don Hewitt, the longtime CBS executive, once noted that a
broadcast television network is sometimes a cathedral, sometimes a
sports stadium, sometimes a dinner table, sometimes a fireside.
Implicit in that insight is that, to succeed, broadcast networks must
excel at offering viewers a broad and rich brand--sports, comedy,
drama, news, spectacle and more.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike cable "narrowcasters," to amass the kind of audiences
required in advertising-based broadcasting, ABC, CBS and NBC must do
it all and do it well. They are to television what Yahoo is to the
Internet or a big metropolitan newspaper is to a community.</TE>
<TE>   Building this kind of franchise brand requires a long-term
strategy. This is what the record suggests Michael Eisner and his
Disney executives do not understand, even if they pay lip service to
it.</TE>
<TE>   For example, ABC's scorecard in sports has been uneven at best. It
lost the U.S. Open in golf and missed the rise of NASCAR (Fox and NBC
cashed in). Its answer to the decline of "Monday Night Football" was
to hire a comedian. Contrast that with the way Fox quickly
established brand with its own sports division.</TE>
<TE>   In news, Disney acquired the best of the three network news
divisions, then thinned the ranks of experienced hard-news reporters
in favor of big-ticket anchors. It has further devalued news by
placing in charge a non-newsperson, lawyer David Westin, who lacks
influence with Eisner and the news staff.</TE>
<TE>   It also walked away from plans to create a cable news network,
which, as NBC's MSNBC has shown, could have become a key to ABC's
economic health.</TE>
<TE>   When Disney took over, ABC news programs were No. 1 in evenings
and Sundays and strong in mornings, and its prime-time magazines were
both more serious and more successful. Now it lags behind NBC in
every category. In entertainment, after failing to create its own
hits, Disney copied a British game show, "Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire," and when it took off made the mistake of airing it four
nights a week. When inevitably it wore out, the entertainment
division was left with its brand cheapened and its schedule without
other hits.</TE>
<TE>   In attempting to steal Letterman from CBS, Eisner and company saw
a similar quick fix, a publicized raid on a rival network that would
fill a hole in its late-night balance sheet created by losses at
"Politically Incorrect," a show it stole from Comedy Central.</TE>
<TE>   Disney soared under Eisner by restoring and then nurturing its
historic brand--animated features and theme parks. Network television
has bedeviled him. ABC makes sense on paper for Disney, but it has
handled the network as if it were fundamentally a platform for
marketing and distributing Disney products.</TE>
<TE>   But it's not too late. It took the "Dateline" fiasco to turn
around NBC. Disney can use the Letterman fiasco as a similar
watershed.</TE>
<TE>   If it doesn't, it will fail not only its stockholders but the
American public, which owns the airwaves, and should just sell the
network to a company that gets it.</TE>

<LD>Mitch Albom of the Detroit Free Press, tongue firmly planted in
cheek, says he's craving more televised "celebrity" boxing matches
after watching Tonya Harding beat up on Paula Jones last week:</LD>
<LD>   "I want Darva Conger next. Linda Tripp after that. Jenny McCarthy
should be in the wings, alongside Gennifer Flowers, Downtown Julie
Brown, Lorena Bobbitt and that witchy woman from 'Survivor.'</LD>
<LD>   "On the men's side, the dressing room should be packed. I'm seeing
... Kato Kaelin, Fabio, Tom Arnold, Macaulay Culkin, Boy George, and,
most definitely, Carrot Top.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm thinking 'Gladiator' here. We grab all these
desperately-clinging-to-the-last-rung-of-celebrity types and let them
battle to the death. That way, when it's over, we only have one
annoying, low-talent person on our hands.</TE>
<TE>   "And we drop a safe on him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Albom: "I have written endlessly about our trash culture
society, fiddling while the rest of the world burns. I have
encouraged reading, listening to music, talking to family,
exercising, even chanting at the edge of a riverbed--anything as an
alternative to the E! Channel, 'Access Hollywood' or the Psychic
Friends Network.</TE>
<TE>   "And what happens?</TE>
<TE>   "Fox puts six has-beens in a ring and has a ratings smash."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia question: What former Wilmington Banning High basketball
standout holds the record for most assists in a NCAA men's tournament
game?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Back to normal: In the aftermath of Sept. 11, New York's baseball
teams were greeted warmly even in normally hostile cities such as
Boston, where Red Sox fans put aside their hatred for the Yankees one
night by singing along to Frank Sinatra's "New York, New York" when
prompted by the public address announcer.</TE>
<TE>   Six months later, it appears as if booing the Yankees and Mets
will once again be acceptable.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course they will boo," Yankee outfielder Shane Spencer said.
"It will really be back to normal when we get booed at home."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Healthy behavior: Duke's basketball fans are known as the Cameron
Crazies, named after the school's indoor stadium, and regularly live
up to their nickname by camping out all night to buy tickets,
painting their faces blue and white, and passing an occasional body
from one section of seats to the next.</TE>
<TE>   Not to worry, says professor Dan Wann, a psychologist at Murray
State who has studied fan behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "They're just finding ways to increase their association with a
winner," Wann said. "We know we're known by the company we keep. It
is reflected in glory. We bask in the glow of our team's success."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Mark Wade of Nevada Las Vegas, 18, against Indiana
in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Terrell Taylor, whose last-second three-point basket
lifted Creighton to a double-overtime upset over Florida in the first
round of the NCAA tournament Friday, wears No. 23 in homage to his
idol, Michael Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   But Taylor's worship of Jordan doesn't end there.</TE>
<TE>   He owns a version of every pair of Air Jordans ever made, and last
he checked, there were 25 posters of Jordan in his bedroom back home
in Bridgeport, Conn. He's also got the wristbands, socks, hat and a
Jordan tattoo.</TE>
<TE>   "It's ridiculous," Taylor acknowledged.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Real Sports With Bryant Gumbel"</LD>
<LD>   Where: HBO, tonight, 10.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Curt Schilling of the Arizona Diamondbacks has a chilling story to
tell. And he and wife Shonda tell it to correspondent Jim Lampley on
this edition of "Real Sports."</TE>
<TE>   It's not only that Shonda, who is pregnant with the couple's
fourth child, was diagnosed with a serious type of skin cancer a year
ago. It's not only Schilling had a cancer scare himself in 1998 when
a lesion developed on his gums. And it's not only that Schilling's
father, Cliff, died of a heart attack in 1988 in front of Curt not
long after being diagnosed with lung cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Schilling story is so chilling because, after all that, he can't
quit chewing tobacco.</TE>
<TE>   "On a golf course a buddy said, 'Oh you can have one [chew].
You've haven't done it in a year, you won't go back,'" Schilling
said. "A week later I was full-blown addicted again. Hands down it's
the only thing that's consistently beaten me."</TE>
<TE>   Asked how big the problem is, Schilling says: "It's a very big
problem because if I don't find a way to beat it, it'll probably be
something that will eventually end up killing me. It's the hardest
thing I've ever had to do."</TE>
<TE>   Shonda says of her battle with Stage 2 melanoma: "What dumbfounded
me is that it could kill me."</TE>
<TE>   She has undergone five surgeries, enduring more than 30 incisions
to remove cancerous growths. Having moved to Phoenix in January,
Shonda must wear special clothing the sun can't penetrate, and the
couple's children aren't allowed to play outside until the sun sets.</TE>
<TE>   Another of the four segments centers on Lee Benson, a 6-foot-11
pro basketball prospect who is a freshman at Brown Mackie College in
Salina, Kan. Benson, 28, is on parole after serving time for his
involvement in a drug-related murder in Dayton, Ohio.</TE>

<KH>Chris Dufresne SECOND THOUGHTS</KH>
<HD>On This Knight, We're Having Some Leftovers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>A recap of events while reviewing my NCAA bracket--the pods must be
crazy!--and thinking how nice it is a guy can cobble together almost
an entire column using only Bob Knight leftovers.</LD>
<LD>   News item: Southern Illinois turns Texas Tech's first-round NCAA
game into "Long Day's Journey into Knight."</LD>
<LD>   Second thought: You don't think God has a sense of humor? At the
same time Knight's team was getting bounced out of the NCAA
tournament on Friday night in Chicago, actor Brian Dennehy was on
stage a few blocks away at the Goodman Theater starring in Eugene
O'Neill's classic "Long Day's Journey Into Night," the Pulitzer
Prize-winning play about one torturous day in the life of a
dysfunctional family. Dennehy's stellar career has taken on a
familiar theme. He won a Tony Award for his portrayal of Willy Loman
in Arthur Miller's "Death of A Salesman," then starred as the
controversial Knight in the low-brow ESPN movie, "A Season on the
Brink," and transitioned smoothly into the O'Neill role of James
Tyrone, patriarch of a dysfunctional family. (Make your own
comparisons as this relates to Knight and the Indiana basketball
family.)</LD>
<TE>   And while Knight's act closed after one night in Chicago,
Dennehy's "Journey" is sold out through April 6.</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, in both "A Season on the Brink" and O'Neill's
classic tale of despair, Digger Phelps plays the part of himself.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Southern Illinois player says playing against Bob
Knight's team was not what he expected.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Don't get Saluki forward Jermaine Dearman wrong.
He enjoyed beating Texas Tech in Friday night's first-round game and
said he admired the hall-of-fame coach. "He is the General," Dearman
said, "one of the best coaches out there. But I was kind of waiting
to see if he would kick a chair, that would have been great to see in
person, but I guess he's gotten older and wiser."</TE>
<TE>   News item: Knight is a perfect gentleman during his short
tournament stay.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: He didn't rant, rave, throw a chair or a tantrum.
Knight seemed to go out of his way to be normal. This was in contrast
to 1997, after his Indiana Hoosiers suffered a first-round defeat to
Colorado in Winston Salem, N.C. Knight was so ticked off after the
defeat he refused to board the team bus and instead walked several
miles back to the hotel in a driving rainstorm. How do I know? I got
wind of the story from a security guard and hopped in my rental car
in pursuit.</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, I caught Knight in my headlights. He was walking
briskly down the middle of the road, in a bad part of town, with his
cap pulled down tightly on his head. I considered offering Knight a
ride--"Hey, what's up, Knight?--but opted to trail him from a
distance until he made it safely to town.</TE>
<TE>   That's the fascinating thing about Knight: you can't take your
eyes off him.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Knight admits he has really grown as a coach this year.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: What Knight actually said was, "I gained about
seven pounds."</TE>
<TE>   News item: Melanie Davis becomes first woman to officiate an NCAA
tournament game.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Davis worked Saturday's Illinois-San Diego State
game and did a fine job. "That's the first game I've had with a lady
referee," Illinois Coach Bill Self said. "She demanded as much
respect as anybody we've had all year. I didn't think twice about
it."</TE>
<TE>   Gee, you think it was coincidence that the NCAA did not assign
Davis to the later game in Chicago, Texas Tech vs. Southern Illinois?</TE>
<TE>   News item: Fresno State basketball Coach Jerry Tarkanian announces
his retirement.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: In a related cost-cutting move, the NCAA announced
that 10 investigators will take early retirement.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Gonzaga loses first-round tournament game.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: See? This proves the selection committee was right
in giving the Zags a No. 6 seeding instead of a No. 3</TE>
<TE>   Dumb argument. Had Gonzaga received the seeding it deserved, it
might have won its first-round game and still be playing. That's the
whole idea of seeding, right?</TE>
<TE>   News item: New York Yankees release Ruben Rivera after he steals
teammate Derek Jeter's glove.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Rivera said what he did was a "rookie" mistake.
Wrong. Missing a bunt sign is a rookie mistake. Not advancing a
runner to second, making the first or third out at third base,
letting tobacco juice drip on your jersey--those are rookie mistakes.
Last time I checked, heisting valuables from a someone was a crime.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Southeastern Conference Commissioner Roy Kramer
announces his retirement.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: In his 12 years at the helm, Kramer turned the SEC
into a money-making machine, presided over the most sanctioned
conference in the country and was the godfather and creator of
college football's dreaded bowl championship series.</TE>
<TE>   The question now is whether the BCS will survive without Kramer's
support. The BCS has produced nothing but outrage the last two
seasons. In 2000, Oklahoma and Miami were No. 1 and No. 2 in both the
writers' and coaches' polls but Florida State edged Miami in the
complicated BCS standings and got to play for the national title.
Same story this year, when Miami and Oregon were No. 1 and No. 2 in
both polls but Nebraska advanced to the national title based on its
No. 2 BCS ranking.</TE>
<TE>   Kramer's retirement could push college football toward a playoff.
There is already talk the BCS bosses are going to dump the computer
component in next year's formula, which would be a blow for nerds
across America.</TE>
<TE>   No word yet on Kramer's successor. I say load the credentials of
the top 10 candidates into the BCS computer and see what it spits
out.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Denver Nugget guard Tim Hardaway suspended two games
and fined $10,000 for tossing a television monitor.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Funny, I did the same thing after watching Tonya
Harding-Paula Jones and was only assessed a living-room technical.</TE>

<HD>Woods Is on the Way to Thirtysomething</HD>
<DH>Golf: He becomes youngest player with 30 victories after
winning by four at Bay Hill.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tiger Woods began his march to the Masters in style, hitting smart
shots and playing bogey-free golf down the stretch in the Bay Hill
Invitational at Orlando, Fla., for his first victory this year, a
four-stroke margin that felt a lot tighter.</LD>
<LD>   Phil Mickelson only raised more questions about his game--and his
decisions.</LD>
<LD>   In a duel between the top two players in the world rankings, the
26-year-old Woods became the youngest player in PGA Tour history with
30 victories, closing with a three-under-par 69 on Sunday to win at
Bay Hill for the third consecutive year.</LD>
<TE>   "It was quite a fight out there," Woods said after finishing at
13-under 275. "I tried to hang in there and give myself a lot of
looks at birdie and not make any bogeys. You needed to play smart,
and I was able to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson could hardly say the same.</TE>
<TE>   Leading by one stroke, he bogeyed four of the last five holes,
including a questionable decision to go for the green on the par-five
16th hole from under the trees.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't easy, but it wasn't impossible," Mickelson said.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, it decided the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson said he had no shot to the fairway because the ball
would have run into rough on the other side. He saw an opening, 198
yards to the pin on a brick-hard, elevated green, 180 yards to clear
the water.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to catch it a little thin to get underneath the branches,"
he said. "I caught it a little too thin. I don't feel like the play
was bad. I just didn't execute it."</TE>
<TE>   The ball never had a chance, splashing in the middle of the pond.
He walked off with bogey and a two-stroke deficit, then bogeyed the
last two holes and tied for third.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to use this as a negative," Mickelson said. "I
played some good golf today, and just didn't finish it."</TE>
<TE>   Woods became the first player to win three consecutive titles at
three tournaments, having already accomplished the hat trick at
Firestone and the Memorial.</TE>
<TE>   "In this day and age, that's an amazing thing," tournament host
Arnold Palmer said. "But he continues to do amazing things."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Campbell of New Zealand holed a 42-foot chip on the 18th
for birdie to close with a 71 and finish second at 279, his best
finish on the tour.</TE>
<TE>   Len Mattiace, who played in the final group with Woods, had a 73
and tied for third at 280 with Rocco Mediate (70), John Huston (72)
and Mickelson.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, Woods rode the momentum of his first victory of 2001
into history--first The Players Championship, then his second victory
in the Masters to become the first player to sweep the four
professional majors.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not life or death," Woods said about winning before he gets
to Augusta. "It's more important for the media than for me."</TE>
<TE>   He's more interested in his game, and there are still some kinks
to smooth over.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The turning point Sunday was No. 14. Mickelson hit at the flag,
which was at the front of the green, and the ball hopped hard and
wound up behind the green. He flubbed his chip to 20 feet and made
bogey, about the time Woods got up-and-down for birdie on the
par-five 12th.</TE>
<TE>   It was a two-shot swing that gave Woods the lead, and he refused
to surrender it.</TE>

<HD>Quigley Weathers Well, Captures Siebel Classic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In conditions that turned even the best senior golfers into models of
inconsistency, the Siebel Classic in Silicon Valley was won by the
most consistent one of all.</LD>
<LD>   Dana Quigley made a 10-foot par putt on the final hole, holding
off Fuzzy Zoeller and Bob Gilder on Sunday for a one-stroke victory
in the rain-soaked tournament at San Jose.</LD>
<LD>   While many of the second-round leaders skidded off the leaderboard
on the damp fairways and soggy greens, the rain didn't much bother
Quigley, a New Englander playing in the 174th consecutive senior
event for which he was eligible.</LD>
<TE>   "I actually liked it better this way than the last two days, with
all that wind," said Quigley, who finished at four-under 212. "I told
my wife this morning on the way to the golf course that these were
good conditions for me."</TE>
<TE>   With a one-under 71 in the final round, Quigley got his sixth
Senior PGA Tour victory, fending off Zoeller and Gilder in a steady
downpour at Coyote Creek Golf Club.</TE>
<TE>   Quigley played a bogey-free round for which he needed all of the
all-weather consistency he learned growing up in Rhode Island.</TE>
<TE>   "I've learned to be a mudder," said Quigley, who finished at
four-under 212. "I've got a horrible, choppy little golf swing, and
if I put on a lot of clothes, I've still got a horrible, choppy
little golf swing. The cold doesn't bother me."</TE>
<TE>   Quigley, who has six top-10 finishes in eight starts this season,
has won at least one event in five of his six years on the tour. He
won $210,000, matching the biggest paycheck of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Rachel Teske birdied the second playoff hole to beat defending
champion Annika Sorenstam in the Ping Banner Health at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam blew a four-shot lead in regulation. She started with a
double bogey on the first hole and had bogeys on the last two,
finishing at four-over 76.</TE>
<TE>   "I threw it away," she said. "I mean, Rachel played very steady.
She was there at the right time. But I don't normally finish
bogey-bogey. I normally don't shoot 76 on Sundays."</TE>
<TE>   Teske carded a 71, tying Sorenstam at eight-under 280.</TE>
<TE>   Each parred the first playoff hole, Teske after blasting out of a
fairway bunker and into another bunker behind the green. She hit a
wedge to within four feet and saved par.</TE>
<TE>   On the next, Teske's approach shot landed six feet from the cup,
and she holed it after Sorenstam's first putt from about 13 feet
stopped short.</TE>
<TE>   It was Teske's fifth career victory and second in two seasons. She
won the Evian Masters in France last year.</TE>

<DH>Horse racing: Medaglia d'Oro makes bloodstock agent look
good in winning debut for Frankel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When bloodstock agent Mark Reid--a former trainer--talks, Bobby
Frankel listens.</LD>
<LD>   Reid's recommendations have been golden for Frankel, the hall of
fame trainer on a seemingly endless roll, and owner Ed Gann.</LD>
<LD>   The man who helped engineer the private purchases of You, a
multiple-stakes winning 3-year-old filly, and Labamta Babe, who won
the Santa Catalina in January before being injured, has found another
gem.</LD>
<TE>   Medaglia d'Oro, a 3-year-old son of El Prado, made quite a splash
in his first race for Frankel and Gann.</TE>
<TE>   Five weeks removed from a maiden victory at Oaklawn Park in his
second career start, Medaglia d'Oro, an 8-1 shot, stunned U S S
Tinosa, 2-5 favorite Siphonic and three others in the $250,000 San
Felipe Stakes on Sunday at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Ridden by Laffit Pincay Jr., Medaglia d'Oro made the lead
immediately, dropped back a bit when challenged by U S S Tinosa and
Siphonic, but took over again with about an eighth of a mile to run
and drew off.</TE>
<TE>   At the finish, he had 21/2 lengths on U S S Tinosa, the 3-1 second
choice, and it was another 31/2 lengths back to Siphonic.</TE>
<TE>   Once considered California's best hope for the Kentucky Derby,
Siphonic had the excuse of a bad start when a distant second in the
Santa Catalina, but there were no visible alibi Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he just got tired,'' said trainer Dave Hofmans. "He was
rubber-legged and just did not finish. We'll scope him to see if
anything went wrong and re-evaluate where we are going from here.''</TE>
<TE>   Where Medaglia d'Oro is going is either Kentucky or New York. Not
currently nominated to the Triple Crown races, the colt will be
before the deadline at the end of the month and will likely make his
next start in either the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct or the Blue Grass
Stakes at Keeneland. Both races are April 13.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Gann has said he wants to get to the Kentucky Derby,'' said
Frankel. "He keeps putting up the money and I keep training the
horses.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a big, big horse and very easy to train. I told Laffit to
try to make the lead, but don't kill him while you're doing it. He
said when [Siphonic and U S S Tinosa] came to him around the turn, he
backed off of him and then he finished well. I thought maybe Siphonic
wasn't 100% and it seemed he wasn't.''</TE>
<TE>   Making his first start of the year, Mayakovsky, the 7-10 favorite,
won the $200,000 Gotham Stakes on Sunday at Aqueduct, beating 2-1
second choice Saarland by nearly four lengths despite drifting out
badly nearing the wire.</TE>
<TE>   A 3-year-old son of Matty G trained by Patrick Biancone for owner
Michael Tabor, Mayakovsky completed the mile in 1:34 4/5 and will
probably make his next start in the Wood Memorial. He was ridden by
Edgar Prado.</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Paul Aguirre was fined $1,500 by Santa Anita stewards
Ingrid Fermin, Pete Pedersen and Tom Ward for violation of a
California Horse Racing Board rule prohibiting trainers from betting
on a horse they are competing against.</TE>
<TE>   According to Pedersen, Aguirre cashed for consolations on a pick
six ticket on Feb. 23 that included Skywriting, the winner of the
seventh race that day, but not Courtesan, a mare he trains who
finished ninth at 11-1.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For the first time in years, Sterling Marlin starts every race
thinking he can win. Even from the last starting spot in the field.</LD>
<LD>   Marlin extended his dominating start to the season Sunday, coming
from the 43rd starting position to win the Carolina Dodge Dealers 400
at Darlington, S.C., taking over the lead after an 11-car accident
that sent Tony Stewart to the hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Stewart was airlifted to a hospital after complaining of
lower-back pain and numbness and tingling in his left foot. Tests
were negative, a track spokeswoman said.</LD>
<TE>   The victory was Marlin's second this year and the 10th of his
career.</TE>
<TE>   Marlin, the series points leader, qualified 11th for the race but
was forced to start in the back after his team changed the engine in
his Dodge Intrepid.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew we had a problem and couldn't take a chance with it,"
crew chief Lee McCall said. "So we put our best motor in and started
in the rear and watched Sterling drive that thing up through traffic
all day long."</TE>
<TE>   Marlin cut through the field the entire race but didn't move to
the front until Stewart, the race leader, and Jeff Gordon were
collected in the late-race accident.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Elliott Sadler finished second and Kevin Harvick was third.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart collided with Buckshot Jones on Lap 227, sending Stewart's
Pontiac into the wall. Gordon hit him from behind.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Park, out six months while he recovered from a brain injury
suffered in a wreck at the same track in September, crashed while
leading. He got his car back on the track but finished 39th.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Winner Helio Castroneves and teammate Gil de Ferran turned the
tables on IRL champion Sam Hornish Jr., finishing 1-2 in the Copper
World 200 at Avondale, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   Hornish won the season-opening race two weeks ago, followed by
Castroneves and De Ferran.</TE>

<TE>   Tony Pedregon won in funny car, Darrell Alderman won in pro stock
and Craig Treble won in pro stock motorcycle.</TE>
<TE>   Ralf Schumacher teamed with Juan Montoya to give Williams-BMW a
1-2 finish in the Malaysian Grand Prix at Sepang.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Schumacher, Ralf's brother and the event's two-time
defending champion, started from the pole but finished third.</TE>

beating second-place Erik Schlopy by 2.76 seconds. Casey Puckett was
third.</TE>
<TE>   Sarah Schleper won the women's national slalom title for the
second consecutive year. Caroline Lalive was second and Julia Mancuso

<HD>Fullmer Touches Base</HD>

<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Looking to fill a gaping hole in their lineup at designated hitter,
the Angels acquired Brad Fullmer in an off-season trade with the
Toronto Blue Jays.</LD>
<LD>   Fullmer's bat was the attraction, but he made sure he brought his
first baseman's glove to spring training. And with the Angels' first
base situation changing almost daily because of injuries or
suspensions, Fullmer started on defense for the second time this
spring in Sunday's 7-6 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers.</LD>
<LD>   "Brad is a guy we have to keep in touch at first base," Angel
Manager Mike Scioscia said. "We would not consider him a long-term
answer, but you want to have that option."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Wooten, who was scheduled to share the first base job with
Scott Spiezio, injured his right thumb last week and will be examined
today in Los Angeles. He is expected to undergo surgery Tuesday and
could sit out four months. Spiezio was suspended for the first six
games of the regular season for his role in two brawls with the San
Diego Padres on March 9.</TE>
<TE>   Fullmer, 27, was a first baseman for most of his professional
career, which began after he was selected by the Montreal Expos in
the second round of the 1993 draft out of Van Nuys Montclair Prep. He
has a .987 fielding percentage in 241 major league games at first
base.</TE>
<TE>   "I can play the position," said Fullmer, who did not have to
handle a ground ball Sunday but had five putouts, including two nice
stretches on double plays. "Maybe with Wooten getting hurt, I'll play
it a little more. Whatever they need."</TE>
<TE>   Fullmer, who batted .274 with 18 home runs and 83 runs batted in
last season, hit a single off the wall in center field, walked twice
and hit a fly ball to left field against the Brewers. He is seven for
39 with one home run and four runs batted in this spring.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm doing about the same as I've done in the past during spring
training," Fullmer said. "Usually, I get it going the last couple
weeks."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ramon Ortiz pitched six innings, the longest outing by an Angel
pitcher this spring. Ortiz gave up five runs and five hits, struck
out eight and walked one. He gave up four runs in the fourth inning,
including consecutive home runs by Geoff Jenkins and Richie Sexson.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike other members of the staff, Ortiz is not experimenting with
new pitches this spring. He said if the season started today, he
would be ready.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With third baseman Troy Glaus still nursing a strained abdominal
muscle, Spiezio started at third base. Spiezio, who is appealing his
suspension, drove in four runs with a sacrifice fly and a three-run
homer.... Glaus took batting practice for the first time since
Thursday, but did not play.... Angel and Padre players who were
suspended or fined for their roles in the two brawls March 9 will
have their appeals heard within the next 10 days, said Bob Watson,
baseball's dean of discipline. Watson said the appeals would be heard
by Bob DuPuy, baseball's chief operating officer. Watson suspended
Spiezio for six games, Glaus for two games and fined Angel pitcher
Aaron Sele. In the past, players often were able to delay suspensions
until their teams traveled to New York. "They're not going to get a
two- or three-month free ride," Watson said.... Watson was the
general manager of the Houston Astros when the team made Cal State
Fullerton's Phil Nevin the first player chosen in the 1992 draft.
Watson was also the general manager when the Astros traded Nevin to
the Detroit Tigers in 1995. Nevin went on to play for the Angels
before he joined the Padres. After he was fined for his role in the
brawl Nevin said: "It's a classic case of having people in charge who
haven't played the game, or if they have played the game, they've
forgotten what it's like to play the game." Said Watson, who played
19 seasons in the major leagues: "He's gotten to be a little better
player. It sounds like he hasn't changed much as a talker."</TE>

<LD>If the Clippers sounded down about losing to the Lakers on Friday and
to Seattle on Saturday, that was OK with Coach Alvin Gentry. He
doesn't want them to mask their emotions "to the point where we're a
stoic, go-through-the-motions type of team."</LD>
<LD>   Gentry's message after the losses was to get over it, but he's
also aware it might not be as easy for his youthful team as for a
more veteran club.</LD>
<LD>   "When you have a young team, emotions run high sometimes," he
said. "Everything is a learning experience."</LD>
<TE>   After Saturday's loss to the more energetic, more efficient
SuperSonics, power forward Elton Brand said, "We needed a win, but we
didn't play like it. We've got to move on and get ready for" tonight,
when the Clippers play the Houston Rockets at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   It's not difficult to figure out why the Clippers have lost
consecutive games. Look at their shooting percentages. They made 33
of 88 shots against the Lakers and 33 of 86 against the SuperSonics
for a combined 37.9%, well off their season average of 44.1%.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Race in Center Wide Open</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said he is "a little closer" to determining
his starting center fielder, though he refused to pick a favorite
among Marquis Grissom, Dave Roberts, McKay Christensen and Tom
Goodwin.</LD>
<LD>   But with a little more than two weeks to go before the April 2
season opener against San Francisco, it appears Grissom and Roberts
have moved slightly ahead of Christensen and Goodwin in a race that
is still wide open. Left fielder *</LD>
<LD>   Brian Jordan could also see significant time in center.</LD>
<TE>   "Can I give you a name [of a favorite]? No. Have I ruled some
things out? Yes, I have," Tracy said. "I've seen some things I like
and some things I don't particularly care for. I know this--you can't
win without defensive strength up the middle. Consistent defense
doesn't go into slumps. If you're not good defensively, that can lead
to disaster."</TE>
<TE>   None of the four has stood out defensively, because none has
really been challenged. Most plays in center field this spring have
been routine. Outfield coach John Shelby said if the season started
today, "I don't know who I'd pick."</TE>
<TE>   This much is clear: If Grissom wins the job, he will not bat
leadoff. Grissom, more of a power threat than an on-base threat, is
batting .379 with three doubles. If he plays center, second baseman
Mark Grudzielanek, shortstop Cesar Izturis or possibly catcher Paul
Lo Duca could bat leadoff.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts is batting .409 with six walks and four stolen bases. He
stole second on a pitchout in the Dodgers' 5-4 exhibition loss to the
New York Yankees Sunday. Christensen is hitting .360 with two walks
and a stolen base, and Goodwin is hitting .227 with three walks and a
stolen base.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hideo Nomo looked sharp Sunday, giving up one run on four hits,
striking out four and walking none in four innings against the
Yankees. The right-hander threw 67 pitches, 41 for strikes,
displaying what pitching coach Jim Colborn said were his best sliders
and forkballs of the spring.</TE>
<TE>   Though Kevin Brown is the preferred opening-day starter, the
Dodgers appear to be aligning Nomo for a possible opening-day start.
Nomo's next game was pushed back to Saturday, the same day Brown is
scheduled to pitch. That would put Nomo--and Brown--on course to make
their final exhibition appearances March 28 and pitch again five days
later on April 2.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, however, is recovering from elbow surgery and may not be
ready to open the season with the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   David Taylor, a 19-year-old pitcher who received a $175,000 bonus
to sign with the Dodgers last year, was released Sunday for breaking
team policies. A 6-foot-5, 195-pound right-hander, Taylor was a
third-round pick out of South Lake High in Clermont, Fla. He went 0-1
with a 3.00 earned-run average in three games for the Class-A Gulf
Coast League Dodgers in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "He was well thought of and drafted in a respectable round," said
Bill Bavasi, the Dodger director of player development. "But we have
high standards, and some kids can't handle them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Roberto Kelly, who hit .133 in 10 spring games and had
no chance of winning a bench spot, was released Sunday, in order to
give the veteran time to catch on with another team.... Catcher Koyie
Hill had quite a thrill Sunday, blasting a 450-foot home run off
Yankee ace Roger Clemens in the fifth inning. Jordan also had two
hits, including a run-scoring double in the first. The Yankees won
when catcher Todd Greene, a former Angel, hit a three-run homer off
Jeff Williams in the eighth.</TE>

<LD>The St. Louis Blues, who are seventh in the Western Conference
playoff race, meant business Sunday. The Ducks were in their way. So
the Blues ran them over.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Dallas Drake clobbered the Ducks' Patric Kjellberg at St. Louis'
blue line in the first period. Kjellberg did not return because of
what Duck officials called a sore neck. He will be re-examined today.</LD>
<TE>   The Blues' Keith Tkachuk, who returned after missing eight games
with a deep thigh bruise, slammed defenseman Niclas Havelid into the
boards so hard it dislodged a glass pane in the second period.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Alexander Khavanov dropped Andy McDonald with an elbow in the
second period. McDonald needed five stitches on his lower lip and
missed a few shifts.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Eastwood leveled German Titov in front of the Duck bench in
the second period. Titov was dazed for a minute, but continued to
play.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're getting run on the boards all night, you don't make
good decisions," Duck defenseman Oleg Tverdovsky said. "You're in a
hurry because you know you're going to get hammered."</TE>
<TE>   Duck defenseman Ruslan Salei scored in the second period and
assisted on McDonald's first-period goal. It was the second
multi-point game of Salei's career.</TE>

<HD>Power Play Becomes a Man-Disadvantage</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Ducks give up short-handed goal in third period
that turns into game-winner in St. Louis' 3-2 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Words that describe a season on the blink.</LD>
<LD>   "We were playing fine until we got the five-minute power play,"
Mighty Duck Coach Bryan Murray said.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, the Ducks went on the power play for five minutes and St.
Louis scored. Instead of the Ducks dominating, the Blues were on
their way to a 3-2 victory Sunday in front of an announced 12,702 at
the Arrowhead Pound.</LD>
<TE>   Words that capture a moment.</TE>
<TE>   "I had the pass picked off," Duck defenseman Jason York said. "It
bounced off my stick, right through my legs and right on that guy's
stick."</TE>
<TE>   That guy was Mike Eastwood, who slipped behind York and barreled
into the Duck zone to score the game-winner 13 minutes 32 seconds
into the third period.</TE>
<TE>   Words that Duck fans have heard too often.</TE>
<TE>   "We're close," as General Manager Pierre Gauthier has uttered on a
few occasions.</TE>
<TE>   Sure they are. The Ducks are proud that they have a near .500
record (17-19-4-3) since Dec. 1. But nine other Western Conference
teams have better records in that time, including the Blues.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis didn't waste breaks. They hit like their season depended
on it. They smothered the Ducks in the third period, allowing only
four shots.</TE>
<TE>   Murray didn't even wait for a question after the game.</TE>
<TE>   "All the good we've been doing didn't happen tonight," said
Murray, whose team is 10-6-1 in its last 17 games. "If our good
players don't play better than that, we don't win."</TE>
<TE>   The core of Murray's frustration is a power play that is
consistent.</TE>
<TE>   Consistently bad. The Ducks are last in the NHL on the power play.
They have one goal in their last 25 chances.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes your job is to simply loft it at the net," Murray said.
"If you don't get the perfect slap shot, that's fine, just get it
through the net."</TE>
<TE>   But the Ducks with a man-advantage are an accident waiting to
happen. And it happened.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks were leading, 2-1, when Alexander Khavanov was sent off
on a five-minute major for elbowing Andy McDonald. The Ducks got one
shot. The Blues got one goal.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Finley skated circles around two Duck players, then fed
Dallas Drake in the slot. Drake had all the time he needed to line up
his game-tying goal.</TE>
<TE>   "It was ugly," Duck captain Paul Kariya said. "It's 2-1 there. If
we get a goal, it makes them really desperate. On a five-minute power
play, you should just be bombing away and we're not doing that."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks lost a 1-0 first-period lead on a bad bounce. Duck
goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere easily deflected a Mike Van Ryn shot.</TE>
<TE>   However, the puck hit defenseman Keith Carney and bounced into the
net.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks lost a 2-1 lead when they flailed and failed on the
second period power play.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks lost the game when York lost Eastwood.</TE>
<TE>   "A defense in neutral zone can never let a forward get behind
him," Murray said. "That's the golden rule in hockey."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the hockey lore also holds that a team with a
man-advantage actually has an advantage. The Ducks had four power
plays, during which they managed just two shots.</TE>
<TE>   "What else is new, huh?" defenseman Oleg Tverdovsky said. "We
tried to make fancy plays in the neutral zone instead of getting the
puck in."</TE>

<HD>Hewitt Walks Open Road</HD>
<DH>Commentary: How the No. 1 player carries his ranking may
say the most about his legacy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL DWYRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIAN WELLS</DL>
<LD>So, we have met the future of men's tennis. He is blue-eyed, blond,
wears his cap backward, says "mate" and "bloody" a lot and looks as
if he'd be perfect in the Olympic halfpipe.</LD>
<LD>   Lleyton Hewitt may be 21 years old, but the youngster from
Australia, who made a shambles of Tim Henman and the final of the
Pacific Life Open Sunday, is, in men's tennis terms, a youngster.</LD>
<LD>   Like it or not, he is the leader of the new generation of the
sport. He is fast and young and tireless and quick and plays with no
conscience or fear, things that creep into one's game with age and
soreness.</LD>
<TE>   The ATP tour has been running an ad campaign for the last few
years titled "New Balls Please." It was an attempt to promote the
newcomers, and it was taken by some as a slap at Pete Sampras and
Andre Agassi, veterans who had done so much for tennis and weren't
exactly playing as if they were ready to buy condos in Sun City and
play golf five times a week.</TE>
<TE>   Now, it appears that the only sin the ATP committed with its
campaign was starting a year or so early.</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt is here. He is the leader of the pack that includes Andy
Roddick, Roger Federer, Marat Safin, Juan Carlos Ferrero, James Blake
and Mardy Fish and a few more we haven't heard enough from yet to
know.</TE>
<TE>   If you tend to cling to the past, like some aging tennis writers
you might know, get over it. (Where have you gone, Pete and Andre? A
nation turns its lonely eyes to you.)</TE>
<TE>   The 1990s were wonderful for tennis, but the '90s are over.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, there are moments left for Sampras and Agassi, but not
as many as there are for the likes of Hewitt, who is living the
Carpenters' song. He has only just begun.</TE>
<TE>   There are a lot of things to say about Hewitt's 6-1, 6-2 trouncing
of Henman, a very fine player from England who must have felt as if
he got hit by a truck.</TE>
<TE>   * Henman's main weapon is his serve-and-volley game. Henman didn't
hold serve once in the first set.</TE>
<TE>   * Henman approached the net 38 times and lost the point 20 times.</TE>
<TE>   * Henman won only 39 points, Hewitt 61.</TE>
<TE>   * Hewitt had five double faults and 19 unforced errors and none of
that mattered in the least.</TE>
<TE>   In past years, the final in this event was always best-of-five
sets. Television dictated this year's to be best-of-three. For once,
television got it right, even though the estimated crowd of 12,000 on
a day that was finally the kind of warm-and-blue Palm Springs
postcard weather that people here have come to take for granted, kept
pushing Henman to extend the match. Sadly, another set would have
been cruel and unusual punishment for the 27-year-old from London.</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt is No. 1 in the world, and he's not just hanging on to that
rank.</TE>
<TE>   "The scary thing is," Henman said, "he'll probably improve."</TE>
<TE>   Since he demolished Sampras in last year's U.S. Open final, 7-6
(4), 6-1, 6-1, Hewitt has run up a 33-4 record, including his last 11
in a row, a title match in San Jose two weeks ago against Agassi and
his 6-2, 6-4 win over Sampras here Saturday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Watching Hewitt's dissection of Henman, No. 11 in the world, made
it clear that Sampras and Agassi are still pretty good.</TE>
<TE>   Agassi had two match points on Hewitt in the San Jose final, a
three-setter, and Sampras, playing in a swirling wind that destroys
his service toss, was much more in contention than Henman.</TE>
<TE>   But there is no denying the current air of invincibility about
Hewitt, who will be huge favorite to win the next tour stop at Miami,
which is, like Indian Wells, one of the ATP's nine Tennis Masters
Series events.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is there any denying that, despite the excellence of his
back-court game and the lure of his invincibility, Hewitt has a way
to go before he invades the public consciousness like Sampras and
Agassi, and those before them. Hewitt has one Grand Slam title, the
thing that ultimately counts most in tennis. Sampras has 13, Agassi
seven.</TE>
<TE>   Getting there is a process. The more Hewitt wins, the more he is
exposed to the press and public. How he handles himself in those
situations will go a long way toward determining his legacy.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, he has a tennis game and little image beyond that. But
at 21, neither Sampras nor Agassi, nor many players, were ready for
the cover of Time magazine.</TE>
<TE>   The veterans of this sport, the ones who leave the best memories,
are reminiscent of the famous line once written about an aging
athlete who had mishandled public relations until the twilight of his
career. Of him, it was written: "He didn't learn to say hello until
it was time to say goodbye."</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt's future is the great sports cliche. It is all ahead of
him. He has the athletic skills, the drive, even the apparent
toughness and strength despite being 5 feet 11 and 150 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Learning to say hello has nothing to do with backhands and
forehands, but everything to do with his place in the future of
tennis. As the leader of the new pack, here's hoping Hewitt figures
that part out as well as he has his cross-court angles.</TE>

<HD>Georgia Left Stinging by Southern Illinois</HD>
<DH>East: A fuming Harrick sees 19-point lead evaporate as
Salukis reach first Sweet 16.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>It was dog eat dog, Bulldogs vs. Salukis, a vicious court-yard scrap
that left one school in the Sweet 16 and the other yapping.</LD>
<LD>   Trailing by 19 points in the first half, No. 11 Southern Illinois
staged a frenetic rally and then held off No. 3 Georgia, 77-75, in a
second-round East Regional game before a crowd of 21,525 at the
United Center.</LD>
<LD>   Southern Illinois (28-7) advances to face Connecticut Friday in an
East Regional semifinal game at Syracuse, N.Y.</LD>
<TE>   This was not your typical good-game, handshake finish. It ended
with Georgia Coach Jim Harrick chasing referee Mike Wood out of the
building after a controversial call helped decide the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   Harrick's bone to pick?</TE>
<TE>   Georgia trailed, 73-71, when Southern Illinois forward Jermaine
Dearman rebounded his own miss in the closing seconds and started to
dribble out the clock.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia (22-10) needed to foul to stop the clock and Jonas Hayes
aggressively wrapped his arms around Rolan Roberts, a 42% foul
shooter, with 14.3 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Woods, though, ruled the foul was intentional, giving Roberts two
shots and Southern Illinois possession of the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Harrick went ballistic.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts made only one of two shots, but Southern Illinois retained
possession, forcing Georgia to foul again on the in-bounds play.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Korn made both foul shots to give the Salukis a five-point
lead.</TE>
<TE>   Harrick was still hot about the call afterward.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a big call, a huge call in this game, let me tell you
that," Harrick said.</TE>
<TE>   Harrick complained that he has seen that play "15 times this year"
in which the intentional foul was not called.</TE>
<TE>   "If they're going to call it, they ought to call it all the time,"
Harrick said.</TE>
<TE>   Harrick did pause to say that he thought Southern Illinois "played
brilliantly."</TE>
<TE>   Dearman led the Salukis with 26 points and eight rebounds, while
Jarvis Hayes had 26 points and 11 rebounds to lead Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   It was a pretty good weekend for Saluki Coach Bruce Weber.</TE>
<TE>   Friday, he defeated Coach Bob Knight, winner of three national
titles, then notched a victory against Harrick, winner of one.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's win marked the first time the Salukis have won a
second-round game in the NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Weber, in his fourth year at Southern Illinois after a long career
as a Purdue assistant, boldly challenged his team to make an NCAA run
to the Sweet 16.</TE>
<TE>   "It probably sounded crazy last spring," Weber said of the goal,
"and now the Salukis are going to be there."</TE>
<TE>   Southern Illinois, at No. 11, is the second-lowest seeded team
remaining in the tournament but proved beyond doubt its tournament
worthiness with tenacious victories against Texas Tech and Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   After Friday's game, Knight said no team had played better defense
against his team this year. Harrick sort of downplayed Southern
Illinois' prowess at Saturday's news conference, which caught the
attention of a few Salukis.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts, a transfer from Virginia Tech, recalled similar talk when
he was a Hokie and Harrick coached at Rhode Island.</TE>
<TE>   "He seemed kind of cocky back then," Roberts said of Harrick. "I
knew he wasn't going to respect us."</TE>
<TE>   Harrick was fit to be tied over the controversial call, kicking a
chair at one point. But he probably should have kicked himself after
his Bulldogs squandered a huge first-half lead. Georgia led, 30-11,
with 8:44 left and then went to sleep at the switch and on the
switches.</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, Southern Illinois, an at-large selection from the
Missouri Valley Conference, whittled the lead down to 38-35 at the
half, tied the score at 41-41 on Dearman's follow shot with 17:46
left and didn't trail again after freshman guard Darren Brooks'
left-handed scoop shot put the Salukis up, 50-48, with 14:14 left.</TE>

<HD>Illinois' Win Self-Fulfilling</HD>
<DH>Midwest: Williams scores all 20 of his points in second
half of 72-60 win over Creighton.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Illinois Coach Bill Self wasn't happy with Frank, to be perfectly
frank.</LD>
<LD>   And after a scoreless first half Sunday, Self let his star guard,
Frank Williams, know it.</LD>
<LD>   "Coach kind of jumped me in the locker room," Williams said.</LD>
<TE>   Maybe the tongue-lashing will earn Self a motivational award.</TE>
<TE>   Williams scored 20 second-half points to lead No. 4 Illinois to a
72-60 win over No. 12 Creighton in a second-round Midwest Regional
game at the United Center.</TE>
<TE>   With the victory, Illinois advances to Madison, Wis., next week to
meet top-seeded Kansas in a Midwest Regional semifinal. It will be a
rematch of last year's semifinal in Dayton, Ohio. Illinois won that
game, 80-64.</TE>
<TE>   Illinois had to be afraid of looking ahead against Creighton,
which pulled off a double-overtime win against Florida and had
notions of making it a weekend double.</TE>
<TE>   Creighton scrapped and hustled and played tough enough Sunday to
hang well into the second half, closing the gap to 46-44 with 13:55
left on two Michael Lindeman free throws.</TE>
<TE>   "The collar could have gotten a little tight," Self said, "but it
didn't happen."</TE>
<TE>   It didn't happen because Williams awoke from his slumber and took
over the game.</TE>
<TE>   In one creative, eight-minute burst, he knocked down consecutive
three-point shots, passed to teammate Brian Cook for a basket, scored
on a reverse layup and beat his man off the dribble for another
basket.</TE>
<TE>   On the last basket of the streak, with 4:13 left, Illinois had
extended its lead to 15 points at 64-49 and began to look ahead to
Friday's matchup against Kansas.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, after missing his only two shots in the first half,
finished with 20 points and five assists. The question afterward was
why he turns his game on and off like a faucet.</TE>
<TE>   Self wanted to know too.</TE>
<TE>   The halftime message?</TE>
<TE>   "I told him he's a lot better than what he's playing," Self said.</TE>
<TE>   It's sort of been the story of Illinois' up-and-down season. When
the Illini dropped to 4-5 in Big Ten play in early February, Self
wondered if the team would win another game.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, sort of like a local team that plays in Westwood, Illinois
(26-8) tends to lift its level of play when it needs to.</TE>
<TE>   The Illini routed San Diego State in a first-round game and did
just enough to get by Creighton, which finished 23-9.</TE>
<TE>   Illinois got just enough offense and had enough defensive stoppers
to hold down the Bluejays' top scorer, Kyle Korver.</TE>
<TE>   Self rotated Williams and Cory Bradford on Korver, who finished
with 14 points but was held to six shots.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't get Kyle enough shots," Creighton Coach Dana Altman
lamented.</TE>
<TE>   Illinois shot 55.6% from the field, 63.6% in the second half, yet
Self said his team is going to have to play better against Kansas.</TE>
<TE>   "They've got the total package," Self said.</TE>
<TE>   "But our guys usually play well when the stage is bright."</TE>

<HD>Ronning Ready for a New Role</HD>
<DH>Hockey: A teacher for young players in Nashville, veteran
acquired by Kings for his offensive abilities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cliff Ronning has had easier weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Last Tuesday, he was honored by the Nashville Predators after
playing in his 1,000th NHL game a few nights earlier. Two days later,
the Predators' all-time leading scorer pledged his allegiance to the
fourth-year expansion franchise, telling reporters he and his family
were happily settled in Nashville and that he hoped to play in the
Predators' first playoff game, whenever that might be.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday, the Predators traded him to the Kings for seldom-used
defenseman Jere Karalahti and a third- or fourth-round pick in the
2003 draft.</LD>
<TE>   "It's always emotional, and it's tough," Ronning, 36, said Sunday
after arriving in El Segundo, "but as a professional athlete this is
part of the game....</TE>
<TE>   "In Nashville, I was pretty well doing what I was asked to do, and
that was trying to help get young kids to develop as players and find
out what it takes to win, and also to contribute. And for the most
part that was happening, but I guess they're going in a different
direction.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very fortunate to come to a team like the Kings that has
great players. I'm just hoping to possibly chip in and help out those
core players."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings are counting on it. On Sunday, Coach Andy Murray had
Ronning's playoff statistics posted on a bulletin board: 76 points in
101 games.</TE>
<TE>   Ronning, though, hasn't participated in the playoffs since 1998.
He's looking forward to making his return next month.</TE>
<TE>   "There's still, obviously, some work to be done," said the veteran
forward, who will make his King debut tonight against the San Jose
Sharks. "But this team's played great and if I can help out in any
way, I'm looking forward to the challenge."</TE>

<TE>   Update--Since the morning of Dec. 9, when the first-place Sharks
held a 14-point lead over the last-place Kings in the Pacific
Division race, the Kings are 25-8-5-2, the Sharks 22-14-3. The teams
play again Saturday at Staples Center, by which time the Sharks' lead
could be history.</TE>

<KH>LAKER REPORT</KH>
<HD>West Is Getting Serious Offers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jerry West expects to enter into serious negotiations with at least
three NBA teams in the coming days, according to a source close to
the former Laker vice president, in the hopes of resuming his
basketball operations career.</LD>
<LD>   Three teams are "actively pursuing" West, the source said, and
formal, specific discussions will begin shortly.</LD>
<LD>   The Atlanta Hawks could offer their club presidency, as could two
other organizations, another from the Eastern Conference and one from
the Western Conference.</LD>
<TE>   "These teams are very aggressively in it right now," the source
said. "The pace has been picked up in the last couple of days."</TE>
<TE>   West, who resigned as vice president of the Lakers after the
2000-01 season to become a consultant, could be part of another
organization--for the first time in his professional career--"as
early as next month," the source said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his ties to Los Angeles and the Lakers, and the emotional
toll his final years managing the team took on his health, West
apparently yearns for another challenge. West will be 64 in May, and
he believes the Laker future is safe with General Manager Mitch
Kupchak, who served beneath West for about 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   There has been some question if West could ever be serious enough
to leave the comfort of Southern California, along with the franchise
with which his jersey hangs on the wall, to rebuild another,
particularly in the midst of such a dominant run by the Lakers. West,
apparently, has worked through that.</TE>
<TE>   "He will take a job if the deal is right," according to the
source, "and he would move away from Los Angeles."</TE>

<HD>Terps Go to Flex Offense</HD>
<DH>East: Dixon scores 29 as top-seeded Maryland shows its
muscle in 87-57 rout of Wisconsin.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEN DAVIS</AU>
<BD>HARTFORD COURANT</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The pass never had a chance. Wisconsin's Kirk Penney realized that as
soon as the ball left his hands. Wisconsin was setting up its offense
30 feet from the basket when Penney tried to lob the ball cross-court
to a teammate on the left wing.</LD>
<LD>   It was one of those moments Juan Dixon anticipates better than any
other guard in college basketball. The Maryland All-American thrives
on being the first in the arena to notice an opportunity. Dixon left
his man, intercepted the pass in full stride and raced to the basket
for an uncontested layup.</LD>
<LD>   It was vintage Dixon on a day when top-seeded Maryland (28-4)
flexed its muscles for the entire NCAA tournament to see. Before an
appreciative crowd of 18,789 at the MCI Center Sunday, Dixon scored
29 points to become Maryland's all-time leading scorer and led the
Terps to an 87-57 victory over No. 8 Wisconsin (19-13).</LD>
<TE>   Dixon's steal and layup came in the middle of a 22-5 Maryland run
that opened the second half and propelled the Terps into the East
Regional semifinals. The Terps, two wins away from consecutive Final
Four appearances, play Kentucky Friday in Syracuse. Connecticut meets
Southern Illinois in the other semifinal.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon made it known he has no intention of slowing down until he
has a national championship ring.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great accomplishment, especially in my situation," Dixon
said of moving past Len Bias into the top spot on the Maryland
scoring list with 2,172 career points.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people wondered who would be Maryland's two guard after
Steve Francis left. Coach [Gary Williams] gave me a great
opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Maryland, which got big contributions from Chris Wilcox (18
points) and Lonny Baxter (16 points, four blocks), turned a 38-30
halftime lead into a 60-35 bulge with that run in the first eight
minutes of the second half. Forward Byron Mouton sparked Maryland's
defense by holding Penney, the Badgers' leading scorer, to nine
points and just seven shots.</TE>
<TE>   Forward Charlie Wills (17 points) led Wisconsin, which was held to
35% shooting and turned the ball over 14 times. Maryland finished
with its largest margin of victory in NCAA play.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever you smell blood, it just comes in bunches," Wisconsin
Coach Bo Ryan said of Maryland's defense. "It's just an emotional
thing that takes its toll. It was very difficult for us to get
re-energized after their big explosion."</TE>
<TE>   Dixon had 12 of the 22 points in that explosion.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, with 4:03 left in the first half, he hit a three-pointer
that pushed him past Bias, who scored 2,149 points from 1983-86.</TE>

<HD>Webber, Bibby Spark Kings of the Road</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Sacramento Kings proved they can win on the road too.</LD>
<LD>   Chris Webber scored 31 points and Mike Bibby scored 18 of his 22
points in the second half to lead the Kings over the Toronto Raptors,
116-113, on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Webber, playing with a dislocated right index finger, had 15
rebounds.</LD>
<TE>   Sacramento improved to 47-18, 17-15 away from Arco Arena with a
4-1 record on this trip.</TE>
<TE>   "We're relying too much on our home games but a road trip like
this helps," Bibby said.</TE>
<TE>   Vince Carter, who finished with 22 points, fouled out with 3:07
remaining for the Raptors, who have lost 16 of 17 games. Toronto has
lost nine in a row at home.</TE>
<TE>   Webber said it didn't matter that Carter fouled out.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a lot of guys in the league are more worried about Dell
Curry coming off a screen than Vince Carter," Webber said. "I was
more worried about Dell Curry at that point."</TE>
<TE>   Toronto Coach Lenny Wilkens said it could be too late to make the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be, but we're not going to give up," Wilkens said. "It
doesn't look good, but why quit?"</TE>
<TE>   Doug Christie had 18 points for the Kings, including a three-point
play that gave Sacramento a 113-109 lead with 25.3 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto's Morris Peterson missed a three-point attempt and Webber
followed with two free throws, giving Sacramento a 115-109 lead with
20.7 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   "I never believed we weren't a road team," Sacramento Coach Rick
Adelman said. "We have beaten some good teams on the road like
Seattle and San Antonio. Our problem has been that we haven't been
consistent on the road."</TE>
<TE>   Bibby had 11 points in the third quarter as Sacramento took a
three-point lead into the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Orlando 105, Philadelphia 103--Pat Garrity's running jumper with
16.7 seconds left at Philadelphia lifted the Magic to its sixth
consecutive victory over the 76ers.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando won for the fifth time in a row and moved one game ahead
of Philadelphia for the fifth spot in the Eastern Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy McGrady had 29 points and 13 assists for Orlando. Garrity
scored 18 points. Allen Iverson had 39 points and 10 assists for the
76ers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Utah 96, Minnesota 89--Karl Malone returned to the lineup with 27
points and 12 rebounds at Minneapolis and the Jazz extended the
Timberwolves' losing streak to seven games.</TE>
<TE>   John Stockton had 22 points and eight assists for the Jazz, which
ended a five-game losing streak against the Timberwolves.</TE>
<TE>   Wally Szczerbiak led the Timberwolves with 33 points.</TE>
<TE>   Malone returned after sitting out the Jazz's victory at Detroit on
Friday because of flu.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 104, New York 99--Wesley Person scored 29 points at
Cleveland for the Cavaliers, who had dropped six of eight.</TE>
<TE>   Kurt Thomas scored a career-high 33 points for New York.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Indiana 85, Atlanta 68--Reserve Austin Croshere scored 19 points
at Indianapolis, and the Pacers limited the Hawks to a season-low
point total.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacers won their fourth in a row, their longest winning streak
since late December, and got their most lopsided victory since
beating the Clippers by 18 points Feb. 23.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 87, Memphis 76--Kerry Kittles scored 19 points for the
Nets, who ended a seven-game road losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Pau Gasol had 18 points and nine rebounds for the
Grizzlies, who have lost three in a row and 12 of 14.</TE>

<HD>Fraschilla Steps Down</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fran Fraschilla resigned as New Mexico's basketball coach after a
season marked by player discord, fan discontent and a record of
barely .500.</LD>
<LD>   Athletic Director Rudy Davalos said Fraschilla quit during a
meeting Saturday night. Fraschilla, the former Manhattan and St.
John's coach, became New Mexico's coach in April 1999.</LD>
<LD>   "The nature of Lobos basketball is high expectations," Fraschilla
said Sunday at a news conference. "Our fans deserve a great team....
I feel like I let Rudy down."</LD>
<TE>   Last week, New Mexico (16-14) finished its third straight season
in the NIT. Minnesota beat the Lobos, 96-62, in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   In Fraschilla's three seasons, the Lobos finished 55-41, including
21-21 in the Mountain West Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Davalos said New Mexico will honor the remaining two years of
Fraschilla's contract but declined to say how much that will cost the
school. He said a search for a new coach has begun.</TE>
<TE>   "It's time for the school to move on and for me to move on,"
Fraschilla said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, point guard Marlon Parmer quit the team after a
30-point loss to Utah, raising to nine the number of players who left
the program since Fraschilla was coach.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CBS broadcaster Eddie Fogler apologized to the father of Georgia
players Jarvis and Jonas Hayes after scrawling profane remarks on a
telestrator during the Bulldogs' loss to Southern Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   During a commercial break late in the second half, Fogler drew a
circle around a camera shot of James Hayes. Fogler also scrawled two
profanities on the telestrator, along with "me."</TE>
<TE>   CBS said the national television audience never saw the remarks,
which were removed before the network got back from commercial. But
they were seen on dozens of United Center monitors throughout the
arena.</TE>
<TE>   The Hayes twins played their first season for Georgia after
transferring from Western Carolina after the 1999-2000 season.</TE>
<TE>   Fogler--who was coaching at South Carolina at the time of their
transfer--said he wrote the comments in jest because James Hayes
didn't call him to let Fogler know the brothers were available.</TE>
<TE>   CBS said it averaged a 6.8 overnight rating with a 15 share for
its second-round tournament coverage on Saturday, a 10% increase from
a year ago. The featured Duke-Notre Dame game Saturday got a 7.0/17.
In Los Angeles, Channel 2 averaged a 3.4/8 for Saturday's coverage, a
13% increase. Friday's UCLA-Mississippi game earned a 4.2/7.</TE>

<HD>Red Wings Keep Rangers in a Slump</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Detroit Red Wings are rolling toward the playoffs with the
league's best record. On Sunday, they left the struggling New York
Rangers in their wake.</LD>
<LD>   Darren McCarty's goal with 2:08 to play was the game-winner and
the Red Wings beat the slumping Rangers, 5-3, at Madison Square
Garden.</LD>
<LD>   McCarty picked up the rebound of Nicklas Lidstrom's blue-line slap
shot and whipped it past Mike Richter, off both posts and into the
net for his fourth goal this season and a 4-3 Detroit lead.</LD>
<TE>   The victory, their 10th in 12 games, gave the Red Wings a
league-high 104 points and a 16-point lead in the race for the best
overall record, which ensures home ice throughout the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   But Lidstrom said the Red Wings, despite being the only team to
have clinched a playoff berth, are taking nothing for granted.</TE>
<TE>   "We're pretty much playing every game against teams that are
battling for playoff berths," he said. "It makes us come out and play
a strong game as well. We have to be ready to play these teams."</TE>
<TE>   The Rangers lost their third in a row and remained in ninth place
in the Eastern Conference, one point behind eighth-place Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 5, Nashville 4--Martin Skoula scored two power-play goals
at Nashville and the Avalanche improved to 9-2-1 in its last 12
games.</TE>
<TE>   The Predators lost their fourth in a row and their fifth
consecutive at home.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 2, Minnesota 2--Ladislav Nagy scored twice for Phoenix and
Marian Gaborik responded with two goals for the Wild at St. Paul,
Minn.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 2, Florida 0--Zdeno Chara and Daniel Alfredsson scored
power-play goals and Patrick Lalime made 28 saves for the Senators at
Ottawa, Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa has won four of five to tie Toronto for second in the
Northeast Division with 83 points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo 2, Tampa Bay 2--Sheldon Keefe scored the tying goal for
the Lightning with 2:10 left in the second period at Tampa, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Vancouver 3, New Jersey 2--Todd Bertuzzi's behind-the-back pass
set up Mattias Ohlund's power-play goal with 1:56 left in overtime at
East Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   The Canucks won their fourth in a row on the road and moved into a
tie with Dallas for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western
Conference.</TE>

<LD>They were buried beneath the weight of heavy expectations, piled high
in drifts of snow.</LD>
<LD>   March came, and green blades sprouted from the earth.</LD>
<LD>   For UCLA, Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri, if winter comes, can
spring be far behind?</LD>
<TE>   All four were ranked in the top 10 before the season began: No. 3
Illinois, No. 4 Kentucky, No. 5 UCLA and No. 8 Missouri.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the season ended, UCLA and Missouri were nowhere to be
found, and Illinois and Kentucky were barely hanging on in the top
15.</TE>
<TE>   Theirs are the tales of rejuvenation in the NCAA tournament, and
they make up a quarter of the Sweet 16.</TE>
<TE>   Scrutiny certainly goes with these programs.</TE>
<TE>   But these are not stories of the unjustly maligned.</TE>
<TE>   Illinois, Missouri and UCLA each lost a game by at least 20
points, and Kentucky's record included a sweep by Georgia and a
13-point loss to Vanderbilt.</TE>
<TE>   Missouri's Travon Bryant, a McDonald's All-American at Long Beach
Jordan High now preparing to play the Bruins on Thursday in San Jose,
knows the drill.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, year-in and year-out, you hear Steve Lavin's going to be
out of there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And yet here he is. Those fans who so recently howled now raise
their arms in triumph.</TE>
<TE>   If the first weekend of the NCAA tournament taught us anything, it
is that the gaps among the teams are no longer so wide.</TE>
<TE>   Who finds it beyond imagining that Kent State and Southern
Illinois made the Sweet 16?</TE>
<TE>   They belong, as much as Gonzaga did the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   And did you notice, despite seven first-round upsets and five in
the second round, only Creighton's double-overtime upset of Florida
was the sort of buzzer-beater that meant Terrell Taylor's shot would
be replayed again and again?</TE>
<TE>   What that says is it's possible for a so-called mid-major to win
without needing a prayer.</TE>
<TE>   Kent State, after all, has defeated Indiana, Oklahoma State and
Alabama in the last two tournaments under different coaches, though
guard Trevor Huffman remains the constant.</TE>
<TE>   The other lesson is that if you are from a major conference, you
will get so many chances to rescue your season there is no excuse if
you don't.</TE>
<TE>   Butler, rolling on in the National Invitation Tournament, got no
such latitude.</TE>
<TE>   Teams from the major conferences did. Missouri was one of the last
at-large teams in and UCLA might have been sweating if not for
victories over Kansas and Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   Now the Bruins and Tigers are liberated from the grip of
conference opponents who understand how to play them, and their
strengths emerge again, honed by their brushes with failure.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's Cedric Bozeman grew up before everyone's eyes in the upset
of top-seeded Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Missouri's Kareem Rush became only one option in the Tigers'
tournament games, and not the entire focal point.</TE>
<TE>   In the battle for conference supremacy, the Big 12 emerged in
front after two rounds, with four teams in the Sweet 16: Kansas,
Oklahoma, Missouri and Texas.</TE>
<TE>   But the Pacific 10 was only one behind, with Oregon, Arizona and
UCLA. (The Pac-10 had four in 2001.)</TE>
<TE>   It would be hard to claim the renewal of the Pac-10 tournament
hurt the league, with the lone exception of USC's first-round loss to
North Carolina Wilmington--in its own time zone, no less.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans more likely fell victim to ego fatigue than tired
legs.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona did just fine after defeating USC in the title game, and
it faced a potentially giant-slaying performance by UC Santa
Barbara's Mark Hull, who made eight of 11 threes and didn't miss
until the second half.</TE>
<TE>   The Atlantic Coast Conference, Big Ten and Big East each put two
teams in the Sweet 16.</TE>
<TE>   The vaunted Southeastern Conference has the same number as the
Mid-American and the Missouri Valley. Only one.</TE>
<TE>   What lies ahead?</TE>
<TE>   A rematch of the 1995 UCLA-Missouri game that Tyus Edney won with
his dizzying fullcourt drive to keep the Bruins alive on the way to
their 11th title.</TE>
<TE>   There also will be a replay of last season's Sweet 16 game between
Kansas and Illinois--an 80-64 Illinois victory for which Kansas
desperately wants revenge.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA will be favored to reach the Elite Eight, where it could run
into Arizona but more likely will face second-seeded Oklahoma</TE>
<TE>   Even Duke, this season, is allowed to tread lightly.</TE>
<TE>   There is no talk of the greatest team ever--the sort of business
that surely has contributed to the Blue Devils' stunned and frozen
looks in the final moments of the 1999 championship loss to
Connecticut.</TE>
<TE>   Who among these 16 teams can't win? Only Kent State, Southern
Illinois and perhaps Texas seem to be true longshots.</TE>
<TE>   Duke, Kansas and Maryland share the favorite's role.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA, Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri?</TE>
<TE>   They are still trying to force themselves into full bloom before
their hour is past.</TE>

<HD>Sooners, McGhee Tattoo Xavier</HD>
<DH>West: Outside shooting from burly 6-8 forward counteracts
Musketeers' inside game in 78-65 win.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>Don't let the size and tattoos fool you. Even though Oklahoma's
6-foot-8 Aaron McGhee looks like a bruiser in the paint, he's just as
comfortable lofting jumpers.</LD>
<LD>   McGhee stayed out of an inside battle with Xavier big man David
West, preferring to knock down outside shots, and led the Sooners to
a 78-65 victory Sunday to send them to the Midwest Regional
semifinals.</LD>
<LD>   McGhee scored 11 of Oklahoma's first 18 points and finished with
25 points on eight-for-16 shooting. Oklahoma (29-4) won its 10th
consecutive game, and 14th in its last 15. The Sooners will play
Arizona (24-9) in San Jose on Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   West, a second-team All-American, scored only one field goal in
the first 17 minutes, but Romain Sato, who finished with 28 points
and eight rebounds, kept Xavier (26-6) afloat. He scored 16 of the
Musketeers' first 18 points, then scored again to get Xavier within
two before West got into a groove.</TE>
<TE>   West, who finished with 18 points and eight rebounds, scored the
team's next 10 points, tying the score, 40-40, but the Musketeers,
who tied it up three more times, never led.</TE>
<TE>   McGhee sank two free throws with 11:15 left to put Oklahoma up for
good, then started building the lead--and getting the Oklahoma crowd
into it with a short jump shot in the lane over West.Oklahoma's Ebi
Ere added 20 points, including several right after Xavier tied it,
and seven rebounds.</TE>

<HD>Silence Is Not Golden for Cal</HD>
<DH>South: A nearly 11-minute scoring drought sends Bears to a
63-50 loss to Pittsburgh.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>There are dry towns and dry humor. Dry ice and dry toast.</LD>
<LD>   But rarely has anything been as dry as the nearly 11-minute,
second-half spell endured by California against Pittsburgh on Sunday
in an NCAA South Region game.</LD>
<LD>   The Bears made not a single field goal or free throw during the
drought, a four-point lead became a 12-point deficit, and eventually
a 63-50 rout.</LD>
<TE>   "In a second-round NCAA tournament game, to hold a team for no
points for 11 minutes, that says something good about our defense,"
Pittsburgh Coach Ben Howland said. "We have really tough kids."</TE>
<TE>   So does Cal (23-9), which responded to the pro-Pittsburgh crowd of
17,015 at Mellon Arena by playing the role of roughneck villain. If
every elbow, shove and kick delivered by the Bears counted as a
point, they would be headed to the South Regional in Lexington,
Kentucky, to face No. 10-seeded Kent State.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, it will be the resurgent No. 3-seeded Panthers (29-5),
who have won two NCAA tournament games for the first time since 1974.
And they have their eyes even farther down the road.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to go down to Kentucky thinking about making it to
the Elite Eight and, hopefully if we play again on Saturday that
victory would put us in the Final Four," guard Brandin Knight said.</TE>
<TE>   Knight had seven assists and scored 11 points, but it was guard
Julius Page who made the big baskets for the Panthers, scoring 17
points on seven-of-10 shooting. Page also made key shots in
Pittsburgh's first-round victory over Central Connecticut State.</TE>
<TE>   More impressive was the Panther defense, which held Cal to 31%
shooting from the field. The Bears made only four of 24 three-point
tries.</TE>
<TE>   "Our guys love to play good defense because they love to win,"
Howland said. "Defense equates to winning. We weren't great
offensively, but our defense kept us in there."</TE>
<TE>   Cal, trying to become the fourth Pacific 10 Conference team to
advance to the Sweet 16, trailed by one at halftime. The Bears took a
30-28 lead on Shantay Legans' three-point basket two minutes into the
second half and extended it on a layup by Solomon Hughes.</TE>
<TE>   Then the spigot went dry. The Bears missed 17 consecutive
field-goal attempts and mixed in four turnovers while Pittsburgh
scored 16 points in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Cal would get no closer than nine points afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Legans led Cal with 13 points but made only four of 12 shots. Joe
Shipp, who scored 20 points in the Bears' first-round victory over
Pennsylvania, had 11 points on four-of-11 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought that at one point we were down six or eight points and
we tried to hurry ourselves back into the game," Cal Coach Ben Braun
said. "Pitt did a great job playing physical, that's what they do. In
the second half the crowd picked up when they went on that run. But
that's how you control games."</TE>

<LD>Coach Michael Sage and his Riverside Poly High team can still taste
the disappointment from last year, but they still have this season to
make up for it. And next.</LD>
<LD>   The Bears shot a team score of four-over-par 364 last year in the
Southern Section Eastern Divisional tournament. They finished third
behind Palm Desert and La Quinta and did not advance to the section
finals. The Bears lost two seniors from that team--Will Park is at UC
Irvine and Darrell McCoy is at the Air Force Academy--but still have
plenty of talent.</LD>
<LD>   Juniors Josh Wooding, Phil Telliard and Ian Hjulberg all qualified
for the section individual finals last season and Wooding, the 2001
Ivy League individual champion, tied for seventh. Senior Clay
Nicodemus also returns and all four were members of a team that won
the 2000 Eastern Divisional, finished fourth that year in the section
team championships and was third in the season-ending CIF-Southern
California Golf Assn. Championship.</LD>
<TE>   "Last year was disappointing after what we did in 2000," Sage
said. "Especially since we played so well in the divisional."</TE>
<TE>   Had the Bears shot 364 at any of the other five divisional
tournaments, they would have won. That score was three shots better
than the 367 they shot in the 2000 divisional.</TE>
<TE>   But playing at Cimarron Golf Resort in Cathedral City put Poly at
a disadvantage because La Quinta played several home matches at that
course.</TE>
<TE>   "La Quinta shot 18 strokes better that day than they had all
year," Sage said.</TE>
<TE>   The Bears (6-0) appear too strong for that to happen again. They
are averaging just over 386 with sophomore Jason Fair making a
contribution. He was the medalist after shooting one-under 35 at
Quail Ranch Golf Club last week. Riverside Poly has won seven
consecutive Ivy League titles and eight of the last nine. They should
be unchallenged in league.</TE>
<TE>   "We're young," Sage said. "But if Jason can stay consistent and we
can find a solid sixth, we should be right there at the end."</TE>
<TE>   Telliard, the 2000 league individual champion, has sat out several
matches with bronchitis and likely will have his tonsils removed, but
he should return at full strength in plenty of time for the playoffs,
Sage said.</TE>
<TE>   The Riverside Poly Classic Tournament of Champions will not be
contested for the first time in 35 years because Sage could not work
out suitable dates with the Victoria Club, site of the tournament.
The club is aerating its greens and will not allow play in early
April, when the tournament is traditionally played.</TE>
<TE>   Brea Olinda, which missed the section finals last season by one
stroke, figured to have a strong team with five starters returning,
but depth has been a problem, Coach Ken Lutz said.</TE>
<TE>   Juniors Chris Heintz and Chris Moores and senior Ryan Wright lead
the Wildcats and junior Ryan Frank is also back, but junior Nick
Wilson is probably out for the season because of academic
ineligibility.</TE>
<TE>   "We need two players to develop over the season," Lutz said.
"Right now our top four guys have to carry us and that's a lot of
pressure at the top. If one of them has a bad day, the team has a bad
day."</TE>
<TE>   One of those days came last week in a match with Esperanza.</TE>
<TE>   Brea Olinda lost, 388-408.</TE>

<HD>WUSA Team Unlikely in L.A. Anytime Soon</HD>
<DH>Women's soccer: Commissioner says eight-team league is in
no hurry to expand.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It might be "three or four years" before Los Angeles gets a Women's
United Soccer Assn. team, Tony DiCicco, the league's commissioner,
said Sunday night.</LD>
<LD>   DiCicco, who coached the U.S. women's national team to its 1996
Olympic gold medal in Atlanta and to its 1999 World Cup victory at
the Rose Bowl, said the WUSA's immediate concern is to consolidate
its position as one of the top women's leagues in the world.</LD>
<LD>   Interviewed at halftime of an exhibition game between the San Jose
CyberRays and the San Diego Spirit that ended in a 2-2 tie in front
of 3,337 rain-soaked fans at Cal State Fullerton's Titan Stadium,
DiCicco said the league, which opens its second season April 13, will
expand from its present eight teams, but is not rushing to do so.</LD>
<TE>   "Our major focus for this season is to improve on some of our high
points from last year," DiCicco said. "I honestly believe the level
of play will be better. The average American player is a lot better,
so that makes the games better.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to add to our attendance [WUSA averaged 8,051 fans a game
in its inaugural season] so that we again exceed our expectations.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to improve our television ratings. We're on PAX every
Saturday at 4 p.m., starting April 13. I think that will help us,
simply because we'll have continuity [of coverage].</TE>
<TE>   "The other piece of the puzzle we need to improve on this year is
the business plan. We think we've revamped the business plan to the
point where it can work and now we've got to hit the target numbers
[in terms of attendance, TV ratings and sponsorship] or get close to
them.</TE>
<TE>   "Once we stabilize that, I think we need to expand. For sure, we
need to look at Southern California, which means [Cal State]
Dominguez Hills [in Carson, where the Galaxy is building a
27,000-seat stadium] or here [Cal State Fullerton].</TE>
<TE>   "Even here we're probably far enough from San Diego to have a
separate market and a great rivalry. Orange County is a great women's
and girls' soccer area.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the West Coast [for expansion], it's L.A., it's
Portland, it's Seattle. There might be a couple of other options out
there....</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "What I've seen of the talent pool [coming up through the college
ranks], I think we can get to 12 teams over the next three or four
years and feel pretty comfortable about keeping the level up."</TE>
<TE>   The level was high Sunday. Shannon MacMillan gave the Spirit the
lead in the ninth minute. Katia tied it six minutes later and a goal
by Tisha Venturini-Hoch put the defending champion CyberRays ahead in
the 37th minute.</TE>
<TE>   Shauna Rohbuck earned the Spirit a tie by scoring from an acute
angle 16 minutes from the final whistle.</TE>

<HD>Erskin's Game Powers Texas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>Deginald Erskin hit jump shots, tapped in misses and dunked with
authority. The Texas forward didn't miss a shot, and his teammates
weren't too bad either.</LD>
<LD>   Then, Erskin didn't touch the ball for much of the second half.
And the Longhorns watched their lead dwindle.</LD>
<LD>   But it was Erskin's three-point play with 1:52 left that helped
Texas stave off Mississippi State's rally and spring a 68-64 upset
Sunday in the Midwest Regional.</LD>
<TE>   The No. 6-seeded Longhorns (22-11) play No. 2 Oregon in the round
of 16 in Madison, Wisc., on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Texas jumped out to a 23-point lead against third-seeded
Mississippi State (27-7), thanks largely to Erskin's seven-for-seven
opening. The 6-foot-6 junior finished with 17 points.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in the right place and right time," Erskin said. "T.J.
[Ford] got me the ball and I was able to contribute. It feels good to
be able to do that."</TE>
<TE>   But he had a 12-minute scoring drought in the second half until
making a basket while being fouled by Mississippi State forward Mario
Austin with 1:52 left and the Bulldogs within two points. Erskin made
the free throw to put the Longhorns ahead, 64-59.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the difference in the game," Texas Coach Rick Barnes said
of Erskin. "Our players will tell you he's the hardest player on the
team to guard."</TE>
<TE>   Royal Ivey made four free throws in the final 26 seconds to seal
the win.</TE>
<TE>   Texas heads to the final 16 for the first time since 1997.</TE>

<LD>FIRST LOOK</LD>
<LD>   UCLA (21-11) vs. Missouri (23-11)</LD>
<LD>   West Regional semifinals at San Jose, Thursday, 7:15 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   STORY LINE</TE>
<TE>   Both started the season with high expectations--UCLA with a No. 5
ranking, Missouri at No. 8 in the first Associated Press Top 25
poll--but struggled in conference play (both finished sixth) and
finished unranked with the same number of losses (11). This will be
the first game between the schools since the 1995 NCAA tournament,
when Tyus Edney drove the length of the court in 4.8 seconds and
scored over two Missouri defenders at the buzzer to give UCLA a 75-74
victory. The Bruins went on to win their 11th national championship.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HOW THEY GOT HERE</TE>
<TE>   UCLA, the West's eighth-seeded team, had a first-round laugher,
80-58 over Mississippi, then showed what all the preseason hype was
about in rallying from an 11-point deficit in the second half and
defeating top-seeded Cincinnati, 105-101, in double overtime.
Missouri, a No. 12-seeded team, jumped out to big early leads and
dominated No. 5 Miami, 93-80, and No. 4 Ohio State, 83-67.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   COMMON OPPONENTS</TE>
<TE>   Alabama and Kansas. UCLA was at its best against these
nonconference opponents. The Bruins, accused before the Dec. 8 game
at Alabama of being soft on defense, buckled down and held the
Crimson Tide to 29.7% shooting and forced 17 turnovers in a 79-57
victory at the Arrowhead Pond. A month later at Pauley Pavilion, UCLA
beat Kansas at its own game--piling up points in transition and
outshooting the Jayhawks (52.6% to 41%) in an 87-77 victory. Missouri
defeated Alabama, 75-68, in Columbia, Mo., on Nov. 20, with neither
team playing particularly well (both shot 41%). The Tigers were no
match for Kansas in the first of two Big 12 meetings, losing, 105-73,
as the Jayhawks shot 61.9%. In the rematch at Columbia, Missouri made
10 of 24 three-point shots but still had trouble with Kansas in
transition and lost, 95-92.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   STYLE OF PLAY</TE>
<TE>   UCLA and Missouri are a virtual mirror image--deep and athletic
teams that like to play it fast and loose. Both have much-maligned
young coaches (Steve Lavin and Quin Snyder) still learning their
trade, perimeter shooters with sweet strokes (forwards Jason Kapono
and Kareem Rush), streaky long-range shooters (guards Clarence
Gilbert and Billy Knight), big men who disappeared in stretches of
the regular season but have come on strong in the tournament (6-9,
275-pound Arthur Johnson and 6-11, 240-pound Dan Gadzuric) and
erratic young point guards (Cedric Bozeman and Wesley Stokes).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   X FACTORS</TE>
<TE>   For UCLA, it's Matt Barnes. The senior power forward has an
inside-outside game that could give the Tigers fits. For Missouri,
it's Rush. He was expected to join bother JaRon at UCLA in 1999 but
myriad problems kept that from happening. How will this--and the 21
stitches he took in his lip after getting hit by a stray elbow in the
first round--affect his play?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHAT TO EXPECT</TE>
<TE>   An entertaining, fast-paced game that could perhaps come down to a
late coast-to-coast dash to the winning basket by Stokes--like Edney,
a product of Long Beach Poly High.</TE>

<HD>Bozeman, Walcott Become Strong Point</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>Cedric Bozeman wore ice on his ankle and a cool grin on his face.
Ryan Walcott shook the shower water from his head as if he wanted to
make sure he wasn't dreaming.</LD>
<LD>   The two freshman point guards, UCLA's supposed Achilles' heel in
an NCAA tournament normally dominated by backcourt veterans, had
prevailed over seniors twice in three days.</LD>
<LD>   They held Jason Harrison of Mississippi scoreless Thursday and
pestered Steve Logan of Cincinnati on Sunday. Logan came in averaging
22 points and had experts saying he deserved the national
player-of-the-year award.</LD>
<TE>   He left with his career behind him and memories of Bruin freshmen
in his face.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Bozeman nor Walcott committed a turnover, and UCLA had a
season-low nine, a stunning total against a Bearcat defense
considered one of the best in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Walcott, who played 22 minutes, said he hardly slept Saturday
night, and his single-minded focus made the game a nightmare for
Logan, who made only six of 18 shots and committed four turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole night I was thinking about Logan," Walcott said. "I
imagined stopping him, then went out and did it."</TE>
<TE>   Bozeman, who had eight points and four assists in 39 minutes,
suffered a mild ankle sprain halfway through the second overtime, but
said the injury will not keep him from playing Thursday in a Sweet 16
game against Missouri.</TE>
<TE>   He is excited about the matchup not only because the Bruins remain
alive but because one of his best childhood friends, sophomore Wesley
Stokes, is a Tiger guard.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked about playing together," Bozeman said. "Now we'll
battle it out."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rico Hines might have played his last game for the Bruins. The
senior guard suffered a strained knee in the first half and played
only four minutes.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to the bench with the knee wrapped, standing on
crutches that he used as a prop, waving them in glee as his teammates
closed in on victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll see what the doctors say and maybe I can make it back," he
said. "This was such a great game, I haven't even really thought
about myself yet."</TE>
<TE>   An MRI exam will be conducted today.</TE>
<TE>   If Hines is unable to play, it will mean more minutes for freshman
Dijon Thompson, who is playing well. Thompson scored 10 points
against Cincinnati and 16 against Mississippi.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the first round against Boston University, Cincinnati Coach Bob
Huggins notched the 500th victory of his 21-year career, which
includes stints at Walsh College and Akron.</TE>
<TE>   Against UCLA, he suffered his 100th defeat in 13 years with the
Bearcats.</TE>
<TE>   The game might have been his last at Cincinnati. There is
speculation that he will fill the opening at West Virginia, his alma
mater, and that Mountaineer boosters are patching together a
lucrative offer.</TE>
<TE>   Huggins admitted he has many close friends at West Virginia and
that the idea of returning home appeals to him. But he said he feels
loyalty to Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a great bunch of guys who come to work every day," he
said. "They are tremendously committed to what we want to be as a
team. I'm not going to cheat those guys."</TE>

<DH>Charting the Lead: A look at the Bruins' lead or deficit by
the minute</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE PUCIN</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What happened: Cincinnati played hard from the start. The Bearcats
won the opening tip and scored the first basket before the Bruins
finished tucking in their shirts. The Bearcats went on an 18-4 run to
take a 24-11 lead. While UCLA concentrated on stopping Cincinnati's
leading scorer, Steve Logan, Leonard Stokes, the other guard, was
tearing apart the Bruin zone defense. Stokes had 10 points in the run
and 16 in the half, including four-for-seven shooting from
three-point range. The Bearcats were solving UCLA's zones for open
jump shots and easy offensive-rebound layups. Cincinnati led, 47-37,
at halftime after leading by as many as 13. Bruin senior Rico Hines,
a defensive presence, injured his knee and would not play again.</LD>
<LD>   Not in the box score: UCLA's Cedric Bozeman got nailed with a
three-second call in the lane on a fastbreak. Coach Steve Lavin never
used his five-man platoon substitution, which had worked well in the
first round against Mississippi.</LD>
<LD>   Winning numbers: Cincinnati's 17 second-chance points and 13
offensive rebounds. UCLA players were unable to figure out how to get
any rebounds while playing their zones.</LD>
<TE>   Wrong number: UCLA's leading scorers Jason Kapono and Matt Barnes
were a combined one for six from the field with no rebounds and two
points and played 15 minutes between them.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: UCLA--Dan Gadzuric 16, Billy Knight 8.
Cincinnati--Stokes 18, Jamaal Davis 9.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: UCLA--Gadzuric 6. Cincinnati, Donald Little 6,
Stokes 5.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What happened: UCLA played without fear and with new energy.
Barnes scored his first points of the game with 19:34 left, a 12-foot
jumper from the baseline, and less than a minute later, Kapono made
his first three-pointer. As UCLA kept substituting, the Bearcats
began to tire and the Bruins were able to score on fastbreaks. Still,
UCLA was behind by 65-54 with 9:20 left when the Bruins managed what
amounted to a six-point play. Barnes made a three-pointer, the ball
bouncing around for a moment before dropping. Little, trying to
position himself for the rebound, was called for a foul so UCLA
retained possession. The disorganized Bearcats forgot Barnes was
still out by the three-point line, unguarded. Barnes hit another
three-pointer. In five seconds the Bruins had cut an 11-point deficit
to five.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: Kapono picked up his fourth foul with 11:45
left in the second half, just after he had shot an airball. But he
never got his fifth foul.</TE>
<TE>   Winning number: Barnes and Kapono were a combined 11 for 24 from
the field for 25 points, and they added five rebounds, 10 assists and
three steals.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong number: After outrebounding UCLA by 10 in the first half,
the Bearcats were outrebounded by UCLA, 20-18, in the second half.
After having 13 offensive rebounds in the first half, the Bearcats
had only five in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: UCLA--Barnes 16, Kapono 9. Cincinnati--Logan 13,
Stokes, 12.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: UCLA--Gadzuric 6, Barnes 4. Cincinnati--Stokes
5, Little 4.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What happened: The Bruins seemed blessed when Knight shot an
airball but Kapono sneaked around two defenders, scored on the
rebound, was fouled and made the free throw for an 85-81 lead. The
Bearcats seemed blessed when Stokes made his fifth three-pointer of
the game to put Cincinnati ahead, 90-88. The Bruins seemed blessed
when Cedric Bozeman banked in the tying basket with 38.9 seconds left
and even more blessed when Cincinnati's Immanuel McElroy missed a
three-pointer, barely, and Little missed two tip-ins. In the second
overtime: With UCLA leading, 94-93, Bozeman missed a little runner in
the lane that rimmed out. Even worse, Bozeman slipped and twisted his
ankle. Immediately after, UCLA scored on a three-point play to go
ahead, 97-93.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: Logan couldn't get a shot in the first
overtime. Second overtime: On UCLA's first possession after Bozeman
left, Barnes had to heave a desperate three-point attempt as the shot
clock expired. The rebound went over Gadzuric's head and into the
arms of Knight, who made a layup and a free throw after getting
fouled.</TE>
<TE>   Winning number: UCLA had 21 assists in the game, Cincinnati 13.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong number: After scoring nine points in the first half,
Cincinnati forward Davis didn't score again.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorer (1st OT): UCLA--Kapono 6. Cincinnati--Stokes 6.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounder (1st OT): UCLA--Kapono 3. Cincinnati--Jason
Maxiell 3.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorer (2nd OT): UCLA--Knight and Dijon Thompson 4.
Cincinnati--Leonard, Logan and Field Williams 3.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounder (2nd OT):UCLA--Barnes 3. Cin.--Maxiell 2.</TE>

<LD>Aside from the occasional "ooh" and "aah," 31 of Caron Butler's 34
points passed without comment as his Connecticut Huskies battled
North Carolina State Sunday in an NCAA second-round East Regional
game.</LD>
<LD>   The other three, however, elicited controversy in the Huskies'
77-74 escape from the Wolfpack at the MCI Center.</LD>
<LD>   With 11 seconds left and Connecticut leading 72-71 after a 14-5
Wolfpack run capped by Marcus Melvin's three-pointer, N.C. State's
Julius Hodge was called for a foul on Butler, who had tried to hit a
three-pointer as the shot clock expired.</LD>
<TE>   It was difficult to hear the whistle, which may have come late
and, according to Hodge, may have come unnecessarily. Though Hodge
appeared to make contact with Butler's arm during the shot, he
wondered about the accuracy, as well as the timing.</TE>
<TE>   "If a call like that comes at the end, it needs to be called
throughout the whole game," said Hodge. "It's hard to take, but
that's the way it goes."</TE>
<TE>   "I know I was fouled," said Butler, who had 20 of his points over
the final 10:45 and also had nine rebounds and four assists. "Julius
was doing a great job of defending me, and I freed myself by making a
crossover.... I pulled up and he hit me on the forearm and the rest
is history."</TE>
<TE>   Butler hit all three free throws for a 75-71 lead and after Ilian
Evtimov's three-pointer pulled N.C. State to within 75-74 with 4.3
seconds left, Butler hit two more free throws and though Hodge's
35-footer seemed on line to send the game to overtime, the shot hit
the rim.</TE>
<TE>   Led by Butler, and with 18 points from Tony Robertson, the Huskies
(26-6) moved into the East semifinals against Southern Illinois in
Syracuse, N.Y.</TE>

<HD>Texas Ends Gauchos' Dream</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kala Bowers scored 20 points and keyed a pivotal second-half run with
two three-point shots Sunday night as Texas defeated UC Santa
Barbara, 76-60, in a women's NCAA East Regional second-round game at
Austin, Texas.</LD>
<LD>   The victory sends fourth-seeded Texas (22-9) to a regional
semifinal Saturday at Raleigh, N.C., against top-seeded Duke. One of
the dominant women's programs of the 1980s, Texas will play in the
round of 16 for the first time since 1990.</LD>
<LD>   Kayte Christensen and Lindsay Taylor each scored 13 points for
12th-seeded UC Santa Barbara (26-6), whose 22-game win streak ended.</LD>
<TE>   It was a complete turnaround for Bowers and Heather Schreiber, who
combined for five points in Texas' first-round victory over Wisconsin
Green Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Against the Gauchos, the freshman forwards were six for nine from
three-point range and 12 for 22 from the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Schreiber finished with 19 points.</TE>
<TE>   With the score tied, 39-39, and 14 minutes left, Bowers keyed a
10-0 Texas run over the next three minutes with bookend three-point
shots from the corners and a fastbreak layup on a long pass from Asha
Hill to put Texas up, 49-39.</TE>
<TE>   The Gauchos outrebounded Texas, 41-31, but shot only 34% from the
floor.</TE>
<TE>   They committed 27 turnovers, which Texas turned into 28 points. UC
Santa Barbara was only three for 16 from three-point range.</TE>
<TE>   Jess Hansen, the hero of the Gauchos' first-round upset of
Louisiana Tech with 13 points and the game-winning basket, was only
two for nine from the floor against Texas for six points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Drake 76, Baylor 72--Senior guard Stephanie Schmitz, who scored 19
points, put seventh-seeded Drake in front, 74-70, with a three-point
basket en route to the upset of second-seeded Baylor at Waco, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "I love those situations," Schmitz said. "I wanted the ball in my
hands, and I feel like I have control. My teammates trust me with the
ball and taking control."</TE>
<TE>   Trailing, 74-72, Baylor's Jessika Stratton missed a three-point
attempt with 16 seconds left, and Schmitz grabbed the rebound.</TE>
<TE>   Fouled in the backcourt, the point guard sank both ends of a
one-and-one with seven seconds remaining to help put away the victory
for Drake (25-7).</TE>
<TE>   Carla Bennett, who scored 19 of her season-high 29 points in the
second half, led Drake in scoring.</TE>
<TE>   Danielle Crockrom paced Baylor (27-6) with 28 points and 10
rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Drake will next play at Raleigh, N.C., against the winner of
today's Cincinnati-South Carolina game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Duke 76, Texas Christian 66--Alana Beard had 24 points and 11
rebounds, and Monique Currie scored 22 as top-seeded Duke (29-3) beat
eighth-seeded Texas Christian at Durham, N.C., for the Blue Devils'
20th consecutive victory.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Devils advanced to the round of 16 for the fifth
consecutive year. They will face fourth-seeded Texas (22-9) in
Raleigh, N.C. The Longhorns beat 12th-seeded UC Santa Barbara, 76-60,
Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   Duke's Beard extended her streak of scoring at least 20 points to
eight games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kati Safaritova scored 24 to lead Texas Christian.</TE>
<TE>   MIDWEST REGIONAL</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee 89, Notre Dame 50--Kara Lawson scored 16 points, and
Brittany Jackson added 10 for the second-seeded Lady Vols (27-4), who
ended Notre Dame's run as defending champion.</TE>
<TE>   The seventh-seeded Irish (20-10), 0-14 against the Lady Vols,
couldn't match Tennessee's pressure or quick shooting. The loss was
Notre Dame's worst of the season, surpassing a 27-point defeat at
Connecticut on Jan. 21.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee will next play at Ames, Iowa, against the winner of
today's Brigham Young-Iowa State game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

round-of-16 appearance in 20 years with the victory at Manhattan,
Kan.</TE>
<TE>   The lead changed 17 times before Koehn capped an 8-1 run that gave
the Wildcats their biggest lead at 65-57 with 8:47 left.</TE>
<TE>   Sixth-seeded Arkansas (20-12) cut it to a three-point deficit with
three minutes left, but Kansas State responded with eight consecutive
points.</TE>
<TE>   Shameka Christon's 19 points led Arkansas.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas State will next play at Milwaukee against the winner of the

<HD>The 'H' May Be Silent, but Horry Makes Himself Heard</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's time for the annual Robert Horry column, only this time it's way
ahead of schedule.</LD>
<LD>   Usually he's like the Wolf in "Pulp Fiction": He comes out of
nowhere, takes care of business and then busts out. That's the way
Horry operates in the playoffs. You sleep on him all season, and he
steps in at the biggest moments of the year.</LD>
<LD>   Laker Coach Phil Jackson called in the Wolf a little early this
year. Samaki Walker went to the sideline with an elbow injury on Feb.
19, Horry stepped into the starting lineup and proceeded to boost his
averages in all the major stats and help the Lakers to a run that has
now reached 12 victories in 14 games.</LD>
<TE>   He's had a little to do with most of them and had a lot to do with
the latest, an entertaining 105-103 "W" over the Dallas Mavericks
Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   Have some of this stat line: 19 points, eight rebounds, three
assists two steals and four blocked shots. Oh, and the game-winning
three-pointer.</TE>
<TE>   "Robert Horry stands in my mind as the guy that hurt us," Maverick
center Raef LaFrentz said.</TE>
<TE>   "Playoff time, usually, you get excited to see Rob on the court,"
said Laker forward Rick Fox, who's been enjoying a resurgence himself
since he shaved his head last week. "Because his focus is one of
experience. He's been at a championship level four times [twice with
the Houston Rockets, twice in L.A.]. He's as good as an All-Star when
he's on the floor [that] time of year.</TE>
<TE>   "Rob prepared himself a little differently this year. He's played
huge on both ends of the floor. More importantly, he's maintained his
health. I'm excited to know he's playing that way already in March. I
was waiting for April."</TE>
<TE>   The only problem is Horry might have to relinquish his title as
the Lord of Leisure. He's been my hero because he has accomplished so
much in his career with such little apparent effort.</TE>
<TE>   Watch him. He won't even waste trips past the halfcourt line if he
has the feeling it wouldn't be worth his while.</TE>
<TE>   But when it matters most he always comes through. Like his
three-pointer that sealed Game 3 of the NBA Finals and all but
finished the Philadelphia 76ers for the series last year.</TE>
<TE>   Some people see his wait-till-June label as a knock on Horry.
What's wrong with it?</TE>
<TE>   Karl Malone has been called the greatest power forward in history,
but you could spend the rest of your life looking through the video
library at NBA Entertainment without finding as many clutch
postseason plays by the Mailman as Horry has produced for the Lakers
and Rockets.</TE>
<TE>   Horry's rep doesn't bother him too much.</TE>
<TE>   "It does a little bit and it doesn't. I could have the reputation
of fading, like some other players," Horry said. "Sometimes it makes
me upset, because it makes me look like I don't do [anything] the
whole season. But I'd rather have that kind of reputation than not
being able to show up."</TE>
<TE>   No one can say he didn't show up this season. What he did was show
up in better shape. He changed his summer conditioning program. He
did more cross-training. He did boxing workouts. He even tried
wrestling with his trainer, but found that was too painful.</TE>
<TE>   He hasn't been slowed by the nagging injuries that usually afflict
him. And he's been able to respond when the Lakers need him.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in great shape," Horry said. "I'm working hard on the weights
in the off days, just trying to keep my body healthy and keep
everything running smoothly."</TE>
<TE>   As a starter he averaged 10.6 points, 8.7 rebounds and 3.7 assists
in 36 minutes coming into Sunday (compared to his overall numbers of
6.6 points, six rebounds and 2.7 assists).</TE>
<TE>   He played 41 minutes Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   Like a hockey coach sending his checking line out against the
opposition's top scorer, Jackson wanted Horry to be on the court to
guard Dallas' Dirk Nowitzki. Nowtizki played 44 minutes, which meant
Horry wound up with 41 minutes of time.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm fine," Horry said. "At one point, he tried to take me out, I
told him not to take me out."</TE>
<TE>   Horry was the only Laker who defended the pick-and-roll well, and
the Mavericks went hard with that play. And with Dallas using
LaFrentz and Wang Zhi Zhi to pull Shaquille O'Neal away from the
basket, Horry became their defensive presence in the middle.</TE>
<TE>   "Robert Horry is one of the best defensive basketball players in
the game," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   He swatted a Steve Nash layup after Nash dribbled the length of
the court in the final seconds of the third quarter. That preserved a
four-point Laker lead.</TE>
<TE>   And Horry got the last word in a great finishing exchange of
three-pointers at the end of the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   With the Lakers down by one, the ball went inside to O'Neal, who
passed out to an open Horry. In typical fashion, he calmly knocked
down the shot.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the type of person. I just sit back and let it come to me,"
Horry said.</TE>
<TE>   To finish his night, he even knocked away the rebound toward the
other end of the court after Michael Finley missed what could have
been the game-winning three-point shot.</TE>
<TE>   The fans at Staples Center erupted. Earlier, those fans chanted
his name as he shot free throws.</TE>
<TE>   "That probably won't happen again," Horry said.</TE>
<TE>   At least, not until the playoffs.</TE>

<HD>Laker Victory Is a Thriller</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: In a back-and-forth, exciting game, L.A.
holds on for 105-103 win over Dallas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Phil Jackson, who doesn't ask often and maybe never before April,
stood at the end of a perfectly taut basketball game on Sunday night
and called it "one of those times we stepped into our shoes as
champions."</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers had pondered the re-manned Dallas Mavericks for more
than 47 minutes, ran with them, shot with them, and then had taken
one last stride, made one last 25-footer, and were 105-103 winners at
Staples Center, by the width of a rim.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Horry's three-pointer with 45.8 seconds left, and
subsequent three-point misses by Nick Van Exel and Michael
Finley--the Mavericks' 39th and 40th three-point attempts--were the
difference in a game that seethed with playoff drama.</LD>
<TE>   Finley's reached the top of its arc as the buzzer sounded, as the
crowd gasped, as owner Mark Cuban leaned, and then front-rimmed the
Mavericks' hope to take a win away from Los Angeles, where they have
lost to the Lakers in 23 consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   Twice-defending champions and beginning to sense that time of year
again, the Lakers tightened their rotation, gathered around the men
who led it last season--Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, Rick Fox,
Derek Fisher and Horry--each of whom scored at least 14 points
against the Mavericks, and won for the 12th time in 14 games.</TE>
<TE>   So they began a three-week run against polished, playoff-bound
teams such as the Mavericks by making three late threes, two by Horry
and one by Fisher, and getting three late defensive stops, the last
when Finley missed an open, pull-up three-point try off a Steve Nash
pass. The same teams play again on Tuesday night, in Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   "I really thought that last shot was going in," Maverick Coach Don
Nelson said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was in rhythm, in the open court and it would have been a
fitting ending."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Horry, who scored 19 points and took eight rebounds and
could be in the starting lineup for good--Jackson is mulling that,
even with Samaki Walker's healthy return--clenched his fist, and so
did more than a few of his teammates. They smiled and grabbed each
other, emboldened by a win when the Mavericks had felt so capable
they set a Laker opponent record for three-pointers (15) and tied the
record for attempts.</TE>
<TE>   "On the floor at that point, five guys had rings," Fox said. "Some
more than two, you know? It was about putting the guys out there
who've been executing this offense the last few years."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal had 28 points and nine rebounds. Perhaps exhausted by 42
minutes of screen-and-roll defense, he slipped out of the building
without addressing any of it. Bryant scored 14 points, but had 11
assists and nine rebounds, later saying, "You could kind of feel it
once the game started, one of those triple-double nights. It was fun
to play in a game like that."</TE>
<TE>   Finley scored 21 points and Nash and Nick Van Exel each scored 20.</TE>
<TE>   But, after making on 10 of 19 three-point attempts in the first
half, the Mavericks perished on the same sword in the second, when
they missed 16 of 21.</TE>
<TE>   Even then, growing colder by the possession, the Mavericks forced
three ties and six lead changes in the fourth quarter alone.</TE>
<TE>   "We beat them at their game tonight," Fox said. "That was not the
game plan."</TE>
<TE>   Neither, apparently, was it the Mavericks', at least not according
to their new guard, recently paroled from Denver. "We shot way too
many three-pointers," Van Exel said. "Eventually, you're going to
have to take the ball to the basket. Teams don't give you
three-pointers; they welcome your three-pointers. There's no way you
can win a championship shooting three-pointers."</TE>
<TE>   Jacked by the meeting of two of the three 46-game winners in the
NBA, of the leaders of the Pacific and Midwest divisions, the folks
at Staples Center cried for defense, and chanted for Horry, and stood
and screamed when Bryant went over his shoulder to feed O'Neal for a
third-quarter dunk.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd was as stirred as a Laker crowd can be before May, and
so it swooned for Horry's eclectic game and Bryant's unselfishness
and O'Neal's thunder, and it cringed at the darting and shooting
backcourt of Nash and Van Exel, at the screen-and-rolls that forced
O'Neal to be nimble and smart.</TE>

<HD>Cincinnati Was Behind the Eight-Ball</HD>

<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>They are the best eighth-seeded team in the history of the NCAA
tournament, the best 11-loss team, maybe the best team left. Really.</LD>
<LD>   They are your UCLA Bruins and you love them, you hate them, you
love them again and they're on their way to San Jose, so deal with
it.</LD>
<LD>   There were so many plays, so many players doing so many glorious
things with a basketball. There were great athletes improvising,
changing their body positions in midair, turning passes into shots
and shots into passes, jumping, climbing to the sky, to the ball, to
the Sweet 16, to a sweet week, a sweet season, a sweet reward.</LD>
<TE>   UCLA, seeded eighth in the NCAA West Regional, and Cincinnati,
seeded No. 1, were playing two overtimes, 50 minutes, of frantic,
frenzied basketball at Mellon Arena.</TE>
<TE>   It is what happens when a tremendously talented team dithers and
dallies during the regular season, loses 11 games, slinks into the
tournament on a two-game losing streak and forces the selection
committee to drop them low in the draw.</TE>
<TE>   You get a Final Four game in the round of 32. You get Cincinnati,
a team with a 31-3 record, walking off the court as losers in an
upset, yet not ashamed because, really, the better team won. If the
Bearcats and the Bruins played 10 times, the Bruins would win seven
or eight.</TE>
<TE>   "They are," Cincinnati Coach Bob Huggins said, "as talented an
eight seed ever in the history of the NCAA tournament and they got us
today."</TE>
<TE>   Yes they are and yes they did. Villanova won the 1985 title as a
No. 8, but those Wildcats didn't have half the talent of UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   And they might very well be the best team left. Maryland looks
tough and Oklahoma was impressive Sunday in beating Xavier, but who
else? Duke barely goes four deep. UCLA goes 10. Arizona? Beat 'em.
Kansas? Beat the Jayhawks too.</TE>
<TE>   Here's the team that can't lose in the second round of this
tournament but can't beat Ball State in the second round of the Maui
Invitational. Sometimes the Bruins are fearless, sometimes they are
frightful.</TE>
<TE>   Is there any team in the country as talented, one through 10, as
UCLA, Huggins was asked? "If the truth were known," Huggins said,
"those other two guys, the ones who didn't play [John Hoffart and
Josiah Johnson, the 11th and 12th Bruins], you could probably count
them too. They are very talented, very skilled. I mean their power
forward [Matt Barnes] had 17 points and 11 assists. That hasn't
happened since Magic [Johnson], has it?"</TE>
<TE>   There was one play, one crazy, unexplainable play full of bad
planning and desperate scrambling that sums up this season's UCLA
team.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins, having built a 94-90 lead in the second overtime, had
just given up a three-point play to Cincinnati's Leonard Stokes.
Freshman point guard Cedric Bozeman, who seemed to have figured out
what it takes to be a big-time college point guard, slipped and hurt
his ankle on the next play.</TE>
<TE>   After a Cincinnati miss and UCLA still leading, 94-93, backup
point guard Ryan Walcott dribbled aimlessly, the Bruins stood around
nonchalantly and waited for 34 seconds to tick off the 35-second shot
clock.</TE>
<TE>   Then Barnes heaved a wobbly, desperate three-point prayer that was
lucky to draw iron. Dan Gadzuric stretched and jumped and stretched
some more and just managed to keep alive the rebound so that it
landed in the hands of senior guard Billy Knight. In one motion,
Knight scooped the ball into the basket. And was fouled. And made the
free throw. With 1:27 left.</TE>
<TE>   Everything you hate about UCLA happened on that play. No plan, no
order, no sense of urgency, no concept of time or space. And
everything you love too. The cockeyed recovery, the scrambling
improvisation.</TE>
<TE>   "What can you do?" Cincinnati's star guard Steve Logan said.
"They've got lots of quick guys with long arms and they keep coming
at you. I don't think we'd get away with playing like that, but it
works for them. That's the toughest No. 8 seed I've ever seen. What
can you do?"</TE>
<TE>   That's both the beauty and the baffling annoyance of this UCLA
team. What can you do? Can you hate them when they are so good, when
Barnes can make pinpoint passes to Gadzuric for alley-oop dunks, when
Bozeman can penetrate and make bank shots, when freshman Dijon
Thompson comes into the game in overtime and floats through the lane
launching high, looping, wispy jump shots that seem to flutter in the
breeze and fall silently through the net?</TE>
<TE>   Can you love them when they let Bearcat forwards jump over two and
three of them for offensive rebound after offensive rebound, letting
Cincinnati take two, three, four, five shots a possession, when they
let a Cincinnati guard, not Logan but Leonard Stokes, keep shooting
uncontested jump shots until he has scored 18 points in the first
half and looks as surprised as anyone?</TE>
<TE>   "Resiliency is the most important thing you can teach young
people," Lavin said, "because in life you fall down a lot and you
have to bounce back."</TE>
<TE>   It almost sounds as if all this is planned, as if Lavin has
concocted a blueprint that leaves his players on their own to learn
or not, to win or lose and get knocked down on purpose so that they
have to get back up. Is this possible?</TE>
<TE>   And now the Bruins--the older ones such as Barnes, Gadzuric,
Knight and Kapono, and even the young ones, Bozeman and Thompson,
T.J. Cummings, Andre Patterson, Walcott--will always get back up
because they are so used to falling down.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of regulation, after UCLA had the ball for 31 seconds
and had Bozeman drive, finally, to the basket only to have his shot
blocked out of bounds, there were 3.4 seconds left and the ball
remained with the Bruins. On some teams, the coach would gather his
players and diagram the play. On this team, the players ran yelling
toward the bench and holding up fingers, one or two. They were
telling the coach what to call. There was a timeout. Lavin drew up a
play. Barnes shot an airball three-pointer, having to arc it over a
Bearcat forward.</TE>
<TE>   So what? The Bruins just bounced back resiliently and kept
playing. On to the Sweet 16.</TE>

<HD>Hewitt's Hit and Run Title</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Top-ranked Aussie finishes first set in 28 minutes
en route to routing Henman, 6-1, 6-2.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIAN WELLS</DL>
<LD>If you blinked, it would have been easy to miss Lleyton Hewitt
dropping to his knees in celebration. This was no lingering Bjorn
Borg-type emotive moment. For Hewitt, there was no basking, just
briskness.</LD>
<LD>   After all, it made complete sense. The top-seeded 21-year-old
Australian did everything quickly Sunday in the Pacific Life Open
final, where speed was the theme:</LD>
<LD>   Hewitt running down nearly everything in sight, forcing Tim Henman
to hit a second and even a third volley to secure a point. Hewitt
running away with the first set in 28 minutes, committing only five
unforced errors. Hewitt running off with his 11th consecutive win and
his second title in his last two tournaments, as he defeated No.
9-seeded Henman of Britain, 6-1, 6-2, in 1 hour 21 minutes before an
estimated 12,000 spectators.</LD>
<TE>   It felt as though the on-court trophy ceremony lasted longer than
the first set.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, an overtime of the NCAA basketball tournament game
seemed shorter.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to thank you and apologize to you. I'm sorry I didn't
make it longer, but my opponent had something to do with it," Henman
told the fans.</TE>
<TE>   He had plenty of company. In the tournament, Hewitt beat Carlos
Moya, Jan-Michael Gambill, Thomas Enqvist and Pete Sampras in
straight sets, making the last three matches seem rather pedestrian.
Hewitt dropped one set--to Andrei Pavel of Romania in the second
round--in six matches, prevailing in windy, sandy conditions, and
quite simply, his confidence has been unwavering since winning the
U.S. Open in September.</TE>
<TE>   "I step on the court and I believe I can win every time," Hewitt
said. "That's a good thing to have, especially when you're playing
against the caliber of a Henman or a Sampras or Enqvist."</TE>
<TE>   Beforehand, Henman was looking at Hewitt's results and determining
which players have had success against him in recent months. After
the U.S. Open, Hewitt won the season-ending championships in Sydney,
becoming the youngest player to reach No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   "The attacking type of players, whether it's Sampras, [Patrick]
Rafter, myself, there hasn't been a great deal of success," Henman
said. "Different styles of players, [Nicolas] Lapentti has beaten him
a couple of times. Magnus Norman has beaten him a couple of times.
Those are the types of people that stay in the rallies, perhaps don't
do so much, but when they get an opportunity, they can sort of hit
winners without having to come to the net and give him a target."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Hewitt has ways of dealing with those types. He stays in
the point, relying on his groundstrokes and has a unique way of
resetting a rally, turning defense into offense with a single shot.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been able to do that when I had to," said Hewitt, who won
his first Masters Series title.</TE>
<TE>   "After I lost the first set against Pavel, I was able to go back
to that and try to step it up again. It was really the only time I
had to do it throughout the week, when I was in a little bit of
trouble."</TE>
<TE>   He prefers a target and Henman obliged. Hewitt was so dominating
that Henman held serve only once despite serving above 60% until near
the end. He broke Hewitt twice, once in the second game, and again in
the second, to pull to 2-3.</TE>
<TE>   The decision, fueled by television, to play a best-of-three set
final, rather than the usual best-of-five, looked appropriate the way
this final unfolded. The last time it was best-of-three was in 1984
when the tournament was held at La Quinta. Hewitt would have liked
best-of-five, but did not think much of the 10:30 a.m. start time.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough," he said. "Sooner or later, you have to start looking
at the players and what's best in the players' interest. I know TV is
a big part of it, but you have to draw the line somewhere.... I've
been waking up early anyway. It wasn't a huge, huge problem for me. I
played a lot of 10 o'clock matches actually this week."</TE>
<TE>   The way Hewitt is competing, he could play at 8 a.m. or 11 p.m. He
has won 18 matches in a row in the U.S., going back to the Open, but
seems almost embarrassed at the concept of domination.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a little surprising, I think, for anyone to start doing it
at the age of 20," he said. "But 'dominating,' that's a big word. I
wouldn't say dominating."</TE>
<TE>   He blushed when it was suggested he might go undefeated the rest
of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll lose a match sometime," he said. "Can't tell you when it's
going to be.... Maybe through Miami, hopefully. The rest of the year,
I've got to play on clay, then play on grass.</TE>
<TE>   "Sooner or later, you're going to have a slip-up, I'm sure. That's
why Sampras and [Andre] Agassi's never done it either."</TE>
<TE>   Australian Open champions Mark Knowles of the Bahamas and Daniel
Nestor of Canada added another title to their impressive resume,
defeating Roger Federer of Switzerland and Max Mirnyi of Belarus,
6-4, 6-4, in the doubles final.... The announced attendance for
Sunday's final was 13,393 and total attendance for the event was
213,792, organizers said. It was a 2.5% increase over 2001. Last
year's total was 208,596. The numbers are tickets sold.</TE>

<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>Matt Barnes draped his arm around Jason Kapono, blanketing his
shoulders as completely as UCLA covered sharpshooter Steve Logan and
smothered the cacophony of criticism 3,000 miles west.</LD>
<LD>   There were 1.6 seconds left in the second overtime, it was clear
the Bruins were bound for their fifth Sweet 16 in six years, and the
two veterans spoke the same words in unison.</LD>
<LD>   "We're supposed to win games like this," they said.</LD>
<TE>   Great minds or not, exultant basketball players apparently think
alike.</TE>
<TE>   It took a collective effort for the Bruins to muster the thrilling
105-101 double-overtime upset of Cincinnati on Sunday and move on to
San Jose, where they will face No. 12-seeded Missouri on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   After combining for only two points in a first half dominated by
top-seeded Cincinnati, Barnes and Kapono scored 34 in the last 20
minutes. Barnes also had a career-high 11 assists and three steals.</TE>
<TE>   Center Dan Gadzuric performed with raptor-like intensity, scoring
a career-high 26 points and grabbing 13 rebounds amid the
board-crashing Bearcats, who had 20 offensive rebounds but only seven
after halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Often fumble-fingered freshmen point guards Cedric Bozeman and
Ryan Walcott were as sure-handed as maternity nurses, never turning
over the ball. They also shared defensive duties on Logan, holding
the two-time Conference USA player of the year to six-for-18
shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Guard Billy Knight scored 12 points and made the key play in the
second overtime, turning an offensive rebound into a three-point play
for a 97-93 lead with 1:27 left.</TE>
<TE>   And freshman Dijon Thompson added another stirring chapter to his
late-season coming-of-age story, making a jump shot in the lane with
14 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Like author Michael Chabon's "Wonder Boys," the Bruins arrived
here seeking identity and inspiration. They quickly became mysteries
of Pittsburgh, perplexing even Cincinnati Coach Bob Huggins, who
could not understand why the Bruins were seeded No. 8.</TE>
<TE>   "That was as talented a No. 8 as there's been in the history of
the tournament," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently he didn't see UCLA's recent losses to California or
Arizona State. But those pathetic efforts, like nearly all the
clunkers of Coach Steve Lavin's six seasons, were rendered
meaningless by a nationally televised display of heart and
determination at Mellon Arena.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA (21-11) trailed by 13 points eight minutes into the game, by
10 at halftime and by nine with nine minutes left in regulation.
Sparked by Barnes' two three-point baskets in a five-second span, the
Bruins caught the Bearcats, 71-71, four minutes later and finished
regulation tied, 80-80.</TE>
<TE>   The first overtime ended 90-90 and UCLA led the second overtime
from the moment Barnes fed Kapono for a basket on the first
possession. It was the Bruins' first double-overtime NCAA tournament
game since their loss to North Carolina State in the 1974 semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   "Guts and grit did it," Kapono said. "We stayed upbeat the whole
time. Coach Lavin stayed up and the whole team did. Somehow we knew
we'd win."</TE>
<TE>   Lavin and Mike Krzyzewski of Duke are the only coaches to lead
their teams to the Sweet 16 five times in the last six seasons.
Mentioning Lavin in the same sentence as the esteemed Coach K might
strike some as sacrilegious, but the UCLA coach's relentless rah-rah
approach was never more effective.</TE>
<TE>   While Huggins screamed at his players on their way to their seats
during timeouts, Lavin led cheers. Maybe Huggins' words made more
sense, maybe his instructions more technically correct, but one team
felt the freedom to trust its instincts and perform confidently down
the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   That team was not Cincinnati (31-4).</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe we'll get the luck in one of these tournaments," said
Huggins, whose team fell in the second round for the fifth time in
six seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati was a victim of its own dominant regular season. Only
four Bearcat victories were by margins of fewer than 10 points and
the players seemed to tighten as the clock wound down.</TE>
<TE>   Guard Leonard Stokes was sensational most of the game, scoring 39
points, but he panicked with 33 seconds left in the second overtime,
launching an off-balance three-point shot that missed, then fouling
Barnes seconds after he grabbed the rebound.</TE>
<TE>   Barnes made one foul shot and UCLA led, 100-93. Even three-point
baskets in the last 10 seconds by Logan and Field Williams couldn't
erase that deficit.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins, in contrast, drew strength from earlier narrow
victories over UC Irvine, USC and Arizona, as well as wisdom from
heartbreaking losses to Villanova, Arizona State and Oregon. Eight of
their previous nine games were decided by fewer than nine points,
making this finish almost de rigueur.</TE>
<TE>   "We beat each other up all year in the Pac-10 and that made us
tournament-tested," Barnes said. "The wars we had every Thursday and
Saturday prepared us for this."</TE>
<TE>   Barnes and Kapono each had to operate with four fouls in crunch
time. Barnes was called for his fourth with the score 85-85 in the
first overtime and Kapono's came much earlier, with 11:45 left in
regulation.</TE>
<TE>   The two veterans had plenty of energy in the extra periods because
they each played only eight minutes in the first half, Kapono because
of foul trouble and Barnes because he missed all five of his shots
and had three turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati appeared in control, thanks to Stokes' strokes and a
25-15 rebound advantage in the first half. But Barnes and Kapono each
scored early in the second half, signaling that UCLA would not go
down without a fight.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a rough first half," Barnes said. "When Jason and I were
struggling early, Dan and our young guys kept us in it.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked about it at halftime. For us to make a run we knew the
two of us had to get it going in the second half."</TE>
<TE>   And beyond, through two overtime periods, straight into another
Sweet 16.</TE>

<HD>Church Attack in Pakistan Kills Two Americans</HD>
<DH>Asia: Grenade assault in capital's diplomatic enclave claims five,
including U.S. Embassy official and her daughter. Dozens are hurt.</DH>

<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>An unidentified attacker rushed into the Protestant International
Church here Sunday and hurled several grenades, killing five people,
including two Americans, and leaving more than 40 people injured.</LD>
<LD>   It was the second assault on a Christian church in Pakistan since the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Killed in Sunday's attack, which occurred shortly before 11 a.m., were
a U.S. Embassy personnel official, Barbara Green, and her daughter,
Kristen Wormsley, 17, a high school senior. Green's husband, Milton, who
works in the embassy's information management department, was
hospitalized along with the couple's son, Zack, a fifth-grader, whose age
was not released but whose injuries were described as minor.</LD>
<TE>   The other fatalities included an Afghan, a Pakistani and a person of
unknown nationality, who Pakistani security officials said had been
"blown to pieces." Sources close to the investigation of the bold attack
at the church frequented by Americans and other foreign diplomatic
families said they were looking into whether the unidentified dead person
might have been the attacker and whether he was assisted by others.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush denounced the killings, saying they "cannot be
tolerated."</TE>
<TE>   "I am outraged by the terrorist attack that took place today in
Islamabad, Pakistan, against innocent civilians," he said in a statement
issued Sunday morning by the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, who was at Camp David, Md., added: "We will work closely with
the government of Pakistan to ensure those responsible for this terrorist
attack face justice."</TE>
<TE>   Western officials seemed split on whether the unidentified victim was
a member of the congregation or a perpetrator. The remains, described as
"a head and two legs" by investigating officials leaving the mortuary
where they were taken, might be of an African or a Pakistani "of very
dark complexion," sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Local hospitals and the U.S. Embassy said that at least 13 Americans
were among those wounded in the attack. The strong percussions of the
grenades, which one witness said might have been homemade, left blood on
the floor, walls and ceiling of the sparse church, where portable chairs
were scattered and long white curtains left dangling through shattered
windows.</TE>
<TE>   The church is less than a mile from the U.S. Embassy in the Pakistani
capital, in a heavily guarded diplomatic enclave that is protected by
guards and road barriers. Sunday services there have drawn a regular
crowd of about 60 people.</TE>
<TE>   Officials were quick to point to Muslim extremists as culprits in the
attack, hinting that they had hurled the explosives in response to
President Pervez Musharraf's recent crackdown on fundamentalist groups
and his alliance with the United States in the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The blasts came a little more than two weeks after U.S. forces began
their largest ground assault on Al Qaeda hide-outs in Afghanistan and
amid rising threats and attacks on U.S. citizens in the region, including
the abduction and execution of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl
in Pakistan and a drive-by shooting in front of the American Center in
Calcutta in January.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, the embassy here issued a warning to Americans living and
working in the area of the port city of Karachi, about 700 miles to the
south, sparked by what one official called "generalized threats."</TE>
<TE>   "There is a hard lesson to be drawn from this," Wendy Chamberlin, U.S.
ambassador to Pakistan, said after the attack.</TE>
<TE>   "President Bush and President Musharraf and other courageous leaders
were absolutely right to take on the terrorists, no matter where they
are, to say, 'No more.' We will not give in to those who hate. These
terrorists will not win in the United States, and they will not win in
Pakistan," Chamberlin said.</TE>
<TE>   But as of 3 p.m. Sunday in Islamabad, investigators said they did not
have a clear idea of who the assailant might be. There had been no claim
of responsibility, they said.</TE>
<TE>   The attack came in the middle of the pastor's sermon on a warm Sunday
morning. Some of the worshipers, many of them aid workers and teachers,
said they had been evacuated from Pakistan right after the Sept. 11
attacks and had returned just weeks ago to what had been judged a safer
environment than it was in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   How the attacker evaded the heightened security of the diplomatic
enclave was not clear, but one theory being investigated by Pakistani
police was that at least one assailant arrived by bicycle, using the
small paths that crisscross the "jungle area" around the compound.</TE>
<TE>   Western officials said the church had little security. One official
said that the security measures it did have were "easy to penetrate and
relatively porous."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Womble, 40, of Brandon, Fla., was sitting three rows from the
back of the church, which was divided into three seating sections, when a
man he described as in his early 20s rushed in from the right rear side
with two grenades in each hand and hurled them toward the middle section.
At least two exploded.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure he knew what he was doing," said Womble, who said he
works for a nongovernmental group whose name he did not wish to reveal.
Womble, who said his ears were still ringing from the blasts, suffered
facial cuts and shrapnel wounds in the legs. He said the attack came in
the middle of a sermon on "forgiveness and restoration," and he then
smiled ironically from his bed in the emergency room of Shifa
International Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "I grabbed my wife and my 6 1/2-year-old son, who was sitting between
us, and we hit the floor, and I covered her with my body," he said. "The
grenade landed seven rows up, and there was a big explosion. My first
thought was that maybe I had died. But I was all right. Then I checked my
wife, and she was hurt. But I couldn't find my son. He had been sitting
crying in between us, and he had been blown two rows back. I got him and
laid him next to his mother. He had shrapnel wounds to the head. I didn't
know whether he'd been shot, but he was conscious."</TE>
<TE>   Both wife and son were hospitalized and were awaiting surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Kate Mitchell, 42, a British citizen who teaches at the American
School in Islamabad, said she was sitting toward the left front of the
church when she heard "small noises like firecrackers" coming from the
rear. She saw people standing up, then heard some explosions.</TE>
<TE>   "I unconsciously reached for my little boy," she said from her
hospital bed. "I saw some grenades sliding across the floor to our side
of the church, and suddenly I felt searing pain and my lung collapsed.
When I looked over, my husband had a hunk of meat on his back."</TE>
<TE>   But she described an even harsher drama playing out before her.
Sitting nearby, she said, were the Greens, whose son was in her
fifth-grade class. He was distraught watching his sister and mother
bleeding beside him, Mitchell said.</TE>
<TE>   "I was saying, 'Zack, it's OK.' But I was covered in blood, so I don't
know how much comfort I offered. I was trying to get my fourth-grade son
to comfort him. I didn't realize it was his sister who was dying," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, she said, the girl was carried out of the church by her
severely wounded father. The Greens were evacuated to the Polyclinic
hospital, where U.S. security personnel from the embassy guarded them.</TE>
<TE>   "Neither the mother or the daughter died immediately," said an
official who knew them. "They lingered."</TE>
<TE>   Reaction to the attack came quickly within Pakistan, with Musharraf
condemning it as a "ghastly act of terrorism." The government formed a
special committee to investigate, with the military taking the lead, said
Pakistani security officials who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday afternoon, Interior Minister Moinuddin Haider, who had been
in Karachi, arrived in Islamabad to visit some of those wounded in the
attack.</TE>
<TE>   The first patients he visited at Shifa hospital were Denis Sherbeck,
43, and his wife, Christina, 38, who described themselves as Christian
missionaries from the Chicago area. They had been wounded by shrapnel
from the grenades.</TE>
<TE>   Denis Sherbeck had led the singing and the prayers during the service,
and it was he who had picked the theme of "forgiveness and restoration,"
choosing Psalm 103, to focus on God's mercy and forgiveness, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "And we do forgive them," he told a reporter after the Pakistani
official left his room. "Like Jesus hanging on the cross said, 'Forgive
them, for they don't know what they're doing.' And they really don't know
what they're doing."</TE>

<HD>Cheney Finds Israeli Issue Trumps Iraq</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DOHA, Qatar
</DL>
<LD>The crown prince of Bahrain gave Vice President Dick Cheney a brief
but public lecture Sunday over the U.S. decision to focus on Iraq while
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict continues to spiral. Cheney acknowledged
the Middle East violence "is a preoccupation for everybody in this part
of the world."</LD>
<LD>   The comments by Prince Salman ibn Hamed Khalifa and the vice
president's response demonstrated the difficulties Cheney has encountered
as he has sought to rivet the Middle East's attention on Iraq and the
Bush administration's desire to expand the war on terrorism. The
government of Bahrain is rarely at odds with that of the United States.</LD>
<LD>   There was one bright moment in Cheney's day. He visited a secure,
undisclosed location in neighboring Qatar--and disclosed it, drawing
attention to something that has largely been kept quiet by both nations:
that Qatar is letting the U.S. Air Force use a base here.</LD>
<TE>   The move underscores the Qataris' willingness to cooperate publicly
with the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   But for most of the day, the vice president was confronted with
reminders of the political difficulties and security threats the U.S.
faces in the region. First, he had to make a secretive change in aircraft
that he was using; then he had to deal with a report on the Arabic Al
Jazeera television network that Saudi officials had used the word
"confrontational" to describe Cheney's meeting in the city of Jidda on
Saturday night with Crown Prince Abdullah, the de facto ruler of Saudi
Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney took issue with the characterization of the meeting, saying at
a news conference in Bahrain that "the only people in the meeting were
the crown prince and myself plus an interpreter, and I have his notes."</TE>
<TE>   He said the meeting was "very good, very productive" and "one of the
warmest sessions I've ever had, frankly, in Saudi Arabia."</TE>
<TE>   He announced that Abdullah will visit with President Bush. A White
House aide said Bush had given the crown prince an open invitation to
visit his ranch in Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney also decried speculation about his work across the region. "I
think a lot of it has been uninformed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   White House officials traveling with Cheney would not say whether he
was hearing messages in private that suggested an easing of the caution
that Arab leaders are expressing in public toward any military action
against Iraq, which U.S. officials believe is developing weapons of mass
destruction.</TE>
<TE>   The vice president began Sunday in Jidda, flew east to Bahrain and
completed the day in this emirate just southeast of Bahrain on the
Persian Gulf.</TE>
<TE>   The day produced the most vivid demonstration yet of the gap between
the Bush administration and leaders in the region over how hard to push
for military action to weaken Iraq's weapons program while the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict rages.</TE>
<TE>   Salman, the Bahraini crown prince, said his nation feels as strongly
about the Iraqi weapons program as does the United States.</TE>
<TE>   But the prince, who was educated at American University in Washington
and spoke comfortably in English, warned: "The people who are dying
today, on the streets . . . are [dying] not as a result of any Iraqi
action. The people that are dying on the streets today are dying as a
result of an Israeli action."</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, he said, Israelis are dying as a result of actions taken by
Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "So the perception of threat in the Arab world really focuses around
that issue, and we are preoccupied by it," he said. "Deeply so."</TE>
<TE>   The importance of reaching a "just settlement" between the Israelis
and Palestinians has never been greater, he said, "because it holds up
and it precludes and it confuses all the other issues which are of
concern to all of us, specifically weapons of mass destruction."</TE>
<TE>   Cheney has said that the violence between Palestinians and Israelis
was not dominating a trip originally focused on widening the war against
terrorism. But it will be the central issue today when Cheney meets with
President Bush's Middle East envoy, retired Marine Corps. Gen. Anthony C.
Zinni, as soon as the vice president arrives in Israel. Cheney also will
meet with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and possibly with
Palestinian leaders.</TE>
<TE>   A senior White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
said Cheney will not engage in negotiations while in Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   Underlying the vice president's discussions throughout the region is a
skittishness among Arab leaders about appearing too close to the U.S. at
a time when many people in their nations believe Washington is waging war
on Islam. The leaders fear that a U.S.-led military operation against
Iraq would be too destabilizing and cause a welling of sympathy for Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   The United States is seeking support to broaden the war on terrorism
beyond Afghanistan, and in particular to turn back what it says is
Hussein's program to develop weapons of mass destruction and to maintain
his chemical munitions.</TE>
<TE>   When Cheney arrived in Doha, his plane set down at Al Udeid Air Base,
rather than at Doha International Airport as originally planned.</TE>
<TE>   There is a large U.S. military presence at the Qatari air base,
including at least several thousand troops. There is also a large
complement of U.S. aircraft, including F-16 fighters, JSTAR
reconnaissance aircraft, and KC-10 and KC-135 aerial tankers, which keep
Navy and Air Force fighters on patrol over the Afghan war zone.</TE>
<TE>   It has been used periodically since the 1991 Persian Gulf War, for
among other missions the enforcement of the "no-fly" zone over southern
Iraq. The Qatari contribution had been kept for the most part under
wraps.</TE>
<TE>   That ended when Cheney arrived at the sand-swept facility, where
gritty dust covers the rolls of barbed wire, the tents in which the
troops live and virtually everything else exposed to the elements.</TE>
<TE>   It was at the air base that the first American fatality within the
broad Afghan war theater occurred. Master Sgt. Evander Earl Andrews of
Mountain Home, Idaho, was killed in a construction accident Oct. 10.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking at Camp Andy, a tent city named after the sergeant, Cheney
said the decision by this nation to disclose the degree of its
cooperation with the U.S. "shows real resolve on the part of the
Qataris."</TE>
<TE>   The vice president is in the latter stage of a 12-nation, 11-day trip
that began Mar. 10 in London and has taken him across the Middle East.
The security-imposed secretiveness that has marked much of Cheney's
travels was no more apparent than on Sunday as he flew over Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   After a farewell ceremony Sunday morning in Jidda, the vice president
entered the blue and white Boeing 747, with "United States of America"
painted across the fuselage, that he is using as Air Force Two. But
moments after he boarded, reporters traveling with him were told to board
a nearby cargo jet. Cheney showed up within seconds aboard the waiting
gray Air Force C-17.</TE>
<TE>   The aircraft is capable of limited evasive maneuvers and quick
descents to land.</TE>
<TE>   The Boeing jet landed in Manama, Bahrain. Moments later, the transport
plane arrived and the vice president stepped down from it.</TE>
<TE>   White House officials would not say why the switch in travel
arrangements had been made.</TE>

<HD>Albuquerque Battles to Leave Arsenic in the Water</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALBUQUERQUE
</DL>
<LD>In this desert metropolis, where it is glaringly apparent that well
water brings life, most townspeople refuse to believe that the arsenic in
it can also bring death.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm born and raised here, and I'm still here," said Mayor Martin
Chavez, echoing the sentiments of many of his constituents. "My
grandparents lived long lives here. We've been here for several hundred
years, and we're just fine, thank you."</LD>
<LD>   Just the same, the Environmental Protection Agency has given the city
four years to slash its elevated arsenic levels and adhere to the new
federal standard.</LD>
<TE>   The agency says the new limit of 10 parts per billion will cut
residents' risk for certain forms of cancer by more than half. But many
people here say the rule will do little more than cost the city $150
million, and Albuquerque and the state of New Mexico are suing to block
it.</TE>
<TE>   Most drinking water nationwide contains little or no arsenic. But
about 4,000 water systems, mostly small ones in the arid West, deliver
drinking water exceeding the standard to their 12 million customers,
according to the EPA.</TE>
<TE>   Although Albuquerque faces a particularly stiff challenge, places
sprinkled throughout the nation are grappling with how to meet the new
federal requirement by 2006. Some, including Park City, Utah, as well as
about 500 California communities, are worried about the cancer risk and
doing their best to comply. Others, such as El Paso, are fighting the
government in federal court.</TE>
<TE>   In Albuquerque, volcanoes and lava flows are responsible for the
highest arsenic levels in the nation for a big city. The arsenic level is
as high as 48 ppb, barely under the old ceiling of 50 ppb and nearly five
times the new one.</TE>
<TE>   In many neighborhoods here, according to a recent National Academy of
Sciences report, the people who drink the water from birth face a
7-in-1,000 risk of developing lung or bladder cancer from it. In some
areas, the risk is as great as 10 in 1,000. Meeting the new limit would
reduce the cancer threat citywide to 3 in 1,000, according to the science
academy.</TE>
<TE>   John Stomp, who is in charge of the city's water system, disputes
those estimates. At the very least, he intends to press the EPA for more
time to meet the standard. And he will seek permission to deliver some
water with arsenic levels exceeding the new standard after it has taken
effect.</TE>
<TE>   "We're one of the poorest states there is," Stomp said. "We don't have
a lot of state money floating around to help us. Even if we did, the
state money isn't going to go to Albuquerque. It's going to go to all the
rural communities that are going to be affected."</TE>
<TE>   In most circumstances, the EPA seeks to limit cancer risks to 1 in
10,000 or 1 in 1 million. But the Bush administration faced a public
relations disaster when it decided to reconsider the new, tougher
standards that the Clinton administration had put in place. Faced with an
outraged Congress, it quickly backtracked and adopted the Clinton
standard. When President Bush was asked by a reporter last summer whether
there were any actions he wished he could do over, Bush singled out the
flip-flop on arsenic.</TE>
<TE>   Albuquerque's Democratic mayor has felt no such public pressure to get
tough on arsenic.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not aware of people dropping off from arsenic poisoning,"
Chavez said. "If there was a demonstrable health effect, there would be a
different response."</TE>
<TE>   Chavez's attitude is widely shared here. A drought has heightened
appreciation for the well water that sustains the town in its beautiful
but parched landscape.</TE>
<TE>   "People are more concerned about not having water at all than about
what is in it," said Pam Caulfield, a sixth-grade teacher.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Rep. Heather Wilson, a New Mexico Republican, fought
against the tougher arsenic standard, arguing that it would actually
threaten public health by forcing some rural water systems to close.
"We'll go back to having untreated water with wells," she said during a
House floor debate.</TE>
<TE>   The staff of Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) says the office has received
mail opposing the new standard but none supporting it.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Webb, director of the water utility in suburban Rio Rancho, says
he doesn't believe the tough new standard is necessary. And he has a
further message for Washington: "If you want us to meet it, you pay for
it."</TE>
<TE>   A consulting firm has estimated that it would cost Rio Rancho $40
million to comply with the new standard, or $2,000 for each of the water
utility's customers.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, EPA Administrator Christie Whitman repeatedly said
Washington must help communities, especially small ones such as Rio
Rancho, that face huge bills. The EPA is spending $20 million over two
years to develop cost-effective technology. But the EPA's 2003 budget
proposal does not seek any additional funds to help communities purchase
or operate those technologies.</TE>
<TE>   Albuquerque cannot count on new federal money to offset any of the
$150 million that is the estimated cost of complying with the new federal
regulations. "I'm mad as can be," Chavez said. "It's clearly an unfunded
mandate."</TE>
<TE>   What makes the challenge especially great in Albuquerque is that there
is no central water facility where arsenic treatment could take place.
Instead, the city's water is stored in 45 beige water tanks that are
nestled in neighborhoods throughout the city.</TE>
<TE>   The water in some tanks has an average arsenic level as low as 2 ppb;
in others, the average is 29, with occasional levels as high as 48. To
meet the new 10 ppb standard citywide, Albuquerque expects to have to
install treatment equipment at 20 of these facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Further complicating the picture for Albuquerque is a huge public
works project that should begin supplying the city with drinking water
from surface water diverted from the Colorado River by 2006. If that
water flows as scheduled, the city would be able to stagger the
installation of the treatment equipment, spreading out the cost over
several years. But if the surface water project is stalled by a lawsuit
or another delay, then the city will need all of the treatment equipment
in place by the Jan. 23, 2006, deadline.</TE>
<TE>   Jeanne Bassett, a local environmentalist who has been the most
outspoken on the issue, attributes the public's attitude to a lack of
leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "I would blame elected officials for not being responsible for
articulating why arsenic is dangerous," Bassett said. "Their excuse that
it's always been there is not good enough. Lead has always been here and
so has mercury. It doesn't mean we want to digest them."</TE>
<TE>   The Sandia and Isleta pueblos, Native American reservations that
border Albuquerque to the north and the south, agree. They have waged a
decade-long battle to force the city and its bedroom communities to clean
up the waste water they discharge into the Rio Grande, including the
elevated levels of arsenic.</TE>
<TE>   On the northern fringe of Albuquerque, dense housing developments
yield abruptly to a vast desert landscape and the threshold of the Sandia
Pueblo.</TE>
<TE>   In the reservation's modest administrative buildings, a large aerial
photograph shows three discharge points from treatment plants that send
waste water flowing into the Rio Grande and through the reservation. The
Sandia Pueblo relies on this water for irrigation, fishing, recreation
and ceremonial practices, but some of those uses have been stopped
because of arsenic and other contaminants.</TE>
<TE>   "We have used and lived off the river for centuries," said Stephanie
Poston, a spokeswoman for the Sandia Pueblo. "A survival of a people is
at risk."</TE>
<TE>   Albuquerque is not the only place struggling against the new arsenic
standard. Nebraska, El Paso and a group of small Western water systems
are also suing the EPA over the standard.</TE>
<TE>   In El Paso, city officials want an extension of several years past
2006. They also want an exemption from a requirement that water systems
tell customers about the increased cancer risk posed even by water that
meets the new standard.</TE>
<TE>   But some communities with high arsenic levels, including Park City,
reacted to the new standard by moving faster to treat their water. "We've
taken an aggressive approach," said Jerry Gibbs, Park City's public works
director. "Our City Council has already authorized us to install new
arsenic treatment to have online by late next fall."</TE>
<TE>   Park City's goal is to reduce the arsenic level to half of the EPA's
new standard. That way, the city would not have to warn its citizens of
the cancer hazard posed by the water. It would also be ready if
Washington finds that it had underestimated the health risks and sets an
even stricter standard.</TE>
<TE>   "When you spend $1 million to put a system in," Gibbs said, "you don't
want to be set up where you're pulling that out to put another one in
after a few years."</TE>
<TE>   About 500 of the 4,000 water systems that fall short of the new
federal standard are in California. There is no widespread skepticism or
resistance to taking the arsenic out of the drinking water, and the state
plans to provide financial help to communities that clean their water.</TE>
<TE>   "Cultural views are different in the Southwest from California," said
David Spath, chief of the division of drinking water and environmental
management for the state Department of Health Services. "There is an
agreement here that there is a risk."</TE>

<HD>In HP Proxy Fight, Even Small Investors Are King</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Suddenly, Charlie Howell is a popular guy in corporate America. In
the last few weeks he has received numerous letters from titans of the
business world seeking his blessing.</LD>
<LD>   Howell is no deep-pocketed financier or influential analyst. But he
owns 100 shares of Hewlett-Packard Co. stock.</LD>
<LD>   And in the bitter fight over the proposed merger of HP and Compaq
Computer Corp., the votes that Howell's 100 shares represent are critical
to HP executives pushing the $22-billion merger as well as to heir Walter
Hewlett, who opposes it.</LD>
<TE>   "It used to be I would get one routine mailing a year around the
annual meeting asking me to ratify candidates for the board and vote
against shareholder proposals," said Howell, 45, who was a writer and
producer on the "Pinky and the Brain" cartoon. He bought the shares in
1998.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I get all these letters and proxies saying vote this way or vote
that way and how important it all is. Now they love me."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, they love his votes, because this is the rare proxy battle
that may not be decided solely by institutional investors and their large
blocks of stock. In this fight, the big players are divided over the
wisdom of the merger, so the fate of the deal rests with small investors
such as Howell, who make up the bulk of HP shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   "It does come down to the retail investor, meaning the individual
stockholders," said Sarah Teslik, executive director of the Council of
Institutional Investors, which has not taken a position on the merger.</TE>
<TE>   The last major proxy battle that ended up being decided by individual
stockholder votes was the 1999 challenge to Venator Group Inc. (formerly
Woolworth) by its largest stock owner, Greenway Partners.</TE>
<TE>   That fight, won by Venator, did not get nearly as much public
attention.</TE>
<TE>   The most effective way to get to individual stockholders is through
direct mail. "They are not as easy to reach as the big investors," Teslik
said, "so the paper flies."</TE>
<TE>   It can get personal. Institutional investors have staffs of analysts
to dispassionately evaluate big deals solely on the numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Individual stockholders, though, sometimes make decisions based on
less tangible factors. Howell, for instance, was turned off by the tone
of the some of the HP letters.</TE>
<TE>   The first mass mailing was sent by Walter Hewlett, who is the son of
company co-founder Bill Hewlett and a member of HP's board. He told the
company's 900,000 stockholders in a letter dated Jan. 13 that he thinks
the proposed merger would "significantly diminish the value of your
investment in Hewlett-Packard."</TE>
<TE>A Bombardment of Green and White Cards</TE>
<TE>   The company struck back three days later with an attack on Hewlett,
describing him as "a musician and academic. . . . Walter has never worked
at the company or been involved in its management. His motivations and
investment decisions are likely to be very different from your own."</TE>
<TE>   The battle was on.</TE>
<TE>   "I started getting letters and packages, one after the other, from
both sides," said Dick Harmon, a retired public relations executive in
San Juan Capistrano. He has 400 HP shares.</TE>
<TE>   "We would get green cards and white cards, and then we got a beautiful
blue, white and yellow book from HP called 'A Case for Change,' " said
Harmon, 78.</TE>
<TE>   The green cards were proxies from Walter Hewlett, allowing his chosen
slate to vote against the merger at the annual meeting. The white cards
were the HP proxies.</TE>
<TE>   A shareholder can sign and send in several cards, but the last one
received is the one that counts.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why we sent several of the green proxies out," said Todd
Glass, a Walter Hewlett spokesman. "If they signed a white one, we hoped
they would later get one of our letters and decide to send in the green
card."</TE>
<TE>   But does it take so many letters and proxy cards to get the point
across? "It's silly. Anyone who is going to respond will respond after
the first one or two," said shareholder Dave Powell, 51, of Gardena.</TE>
<TE>   More important to many stockholders was the cost of sending out
proxies--some investors had received as many as six from HP and five from
Hewlett--plus additional letters.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a 3-inch stack of the stuff," said Carol Darnell, 58, a
database analyst for Hertz Corp. in Oklahoma City who has about 600
shares. She works on and even "loves" HP computers, but not the
expenditures by the company in the proxy fight. "I got one yesterday that
was sent overnight mail and two or three in the last week. And each of
the proxies have return postage on them."</TE>
<TE>   She didn't care about the funds Hewlett was spending in his effort.
"It's his money," said Darnell, "but the money the company is spending is
my money as an investor."</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Hewlett-Packard, who would not disclose how much the
company has spent on the campaign, said shareholders should not blame the
company for the expense.</TE>
<TE>   "The shareholders have Walter Hewlett to thank for the cost we've
endured since much of the spending was geared toward setting the record
straight and correcting his misleading information," said Rebeca Robboy
of HP.</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett has spent about $32 million on the battle, including the
proxies, letters and newspaper ads, Glass said.</TE>
<TE>Personal Attacks Viewed as a Turnoff</TE>
<TE>   The tone of the letters from HP often has been accusatory, which has
been a turnoff for Howell. He said he understands the company's trying to
boost Chief Executive Carly Fiorina, but not at the expense of the
company heir.</TE>
<TE>   "They try to make him out to be a flake," he said. "And they refer to
him as 'Walter.' It bugs me. I don't think he ever referred to her in his
letters as 'Carly.' "</TE>
<TE>   Howell has sent in a green proxy card, voting no to the merger, and
said the letters from both sides helped him decide. Powell and Darnell
also sent in green cards.</TE>
<TE>   An HP employee in Kansas City who did not want his name used said he
was influenced by the letters to vote yes even though he does not like
the current management of the firm.</TE>
<TE>   "The more I read of Walter Hewlett's writing, the less I could trust
him. He never gave me anything of substance," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, barring any voting problems or court challenges, the
matter will finally be brought to rest. Howell is looking forward to it,
even if the vote doesn't go his way.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, either side could be right," he said, "and if the merger
goes through I'll be rooting for it to succeed. I own the stock."</TE>

<HD>Making Builders Do More</HD>
<DH>Developers that receive public dollars increasingly are being
called on to deliver fixes for civic problems as part of their deals.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The light industrial park that Randall Roth plans for a weed-strewn
corner of the San Fernando Valley will yield more than sturdy new
buildings and freshly paved parking spaces.</LD>
<LD>   Roth also will pay for a youth center and drainage improvements.
Tenants will hire locally, and Roth has promised that 70% of jobs at the
site will pay the city's living wage--a substantial premium over minimum
wage.</LD>
<LD>   The extras are among a long list secured by a coalition of residents
and labor and community activists. It is the third Los Angeles
neighborhood benefits deal negotiated in the last year, placing the city
at the front of a burgeoning national movement to demand more in return
for the billions of dollars in annual economic development subsidies.</LD>
<TE>   For decades, government economic development strategies were aimed
largely at promoting business expansion, with the assumption that jobs
and other benefits would follow. Now, those receiving public dollars
increasingly are being called on to deliver improved wages, health
benefits, subsidized housing, child-care centers and parks.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, the new demands are causing some grumbling among
developers. Saddling their projects with more fixes for civic problems
drives up the cost and frequently sends them looking for even more public
subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a cost that could be too high," said Larry Kosmont, a
consultant whose Los Angeles-based Kosmont Cos. is working a dozen
development deals across California, each with a proposed public subsidy
of $5 million to $15 million.</TE>
<TE>   But community groups, increasingly supported by politicians, say it's
payback time.</TE>
<TE>   Cities hungry for jobs and higher sales taxes long have offered free
land, tax breaks, sidewalks, street lights and power hookups to entice
new development. Billions more has been spent on sweeteners to prevent
companies from border-hopping to neighboring cities or states.</TE>
<TE>   States paid more than $26 billion in grants, tax abatements,
low-interest loans and other incentives in 1996, said political scientist
Kenneth P. Thomas, a fellow at the Center for International Studies,
University of Missouri-St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   More recent nationwide data are not available, but Thomas said the
figure has ballooned. Last year, California alone devoted nearly $8
billion to state economic development incentives, according to the
nonprofit California Budget Project, an advocacy group for low- and
middle-income residents. And local governments across the country
probably spend billions more, Thomas said.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the deals have come with few strings attached, but that's
beginning to change.</TE>
<TE>   At least nine states (California is not among them) have passed laws
demanding a detailed accounting of subsidies meted out to private
industry, in some cases requiring disclosure of the number and quality of
jobs created. Also on the rise are "clawbacks," which require companies
to return the money if they don't hold up their end of the deals, said
Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, a Washington-based
advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   Government also is increasingly imposing wage requirements when public
dollars are used. About 60 counties and cities across the
country--including the city of Los Angeles--have living wage ordinances
that apply to public contracts.</TE>
<TE>   And a California law that went into effect in January significantly
broadens requirements that union wages be paid for construction jobs that
receive even modest public assistance.</TE>
<TE>Communities Have More Leverage</TE>
<TE>   Even where direct subsidies are not involved, government controls
other resources that can spell profit for developers. And that has
cracked the door open to some hardball negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   For Roth's development in Sun Valley, the city will sell the dormant
Branford landfill and a neighboring lot to Roth for $2.25 million and
spend a little more than half a million in taxpayer dollars on cleanup
and other costs, city documents show.</TE>
<TE>   The land sale was not a giveaway. But combined with the needed public
stamp of approval, it gave Los Angeles City Councilman Alex Padilla and
community groups leverage to insist on something more than a new office
park.</TE>
<TE>   "There wasn't a lot of leverage on the part of the city but . . .
there was enough," said Lizette Bravo, an organizer with the nonprofit
Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy, or LAANE, which devised the
community negotiating strategy and has brokered three such deals here.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla, who represents the northeast Valley, recruited LAANE to head
the community negotiating effort.</TE>
<TE>   In the two other recent Los Angeles deals--the Staples Center
expansion and a North Hollywood retail and residential complex--tens of
millions of dollars in anticipated public subsidies gave community groups
the leverage to push their wish lists.</TE>
<TE>   LAANE is working with organizations in San Diego, Oakland and San Jose
to launch similar campaigns in those cities and hopes ultimately to push
for statewide public investment guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   The group also is pushing Los Angeles to require that community needs
be addressed wherever subsidies flow. The goal, said LAANE Executive
Director Madeline Janis-Aparicio, is to "take our limited public
resources and use them to deal with huge problems," such as poverty,
child care and housing.</TE>
<TE>   LAANE first rolled out the tactic in Los Angeles in 1998 with
TrizecHahn's retail, hotel and entertainment complex at Hollywood
Boulevard and Highland Avenue.</TE>
<TE>Street-Level Organizing Efforts Find Success</TE>
<TE>   The project's $90-million subsidy through the city's Community
Redevelopment Agency gave LAANE its entree to negotiate. The developer
agreed to some local hiring and training, and about 1,000
workers--roughly half--earn the premium hourly living wages of $7.99 with
benefits or $9.24 without, LAANE said.</TE>
<TE>   But the neighborhood played no role in the process. And wage
provisions did not apply to retail tenants.</TE>
<TE>   Next came a street-level organizing effort and an even bigger target:
the L.A. Arena Land Co., developers of Staples Center and a planned
downtown hotel and entertainment district.</TE>
<TE>   Together with more than two dozen community groups, five labor unions
and 500 immigrant residents of the neighborhood's worn-down apartment
buildings, LAANE helped secure a deal that includes affordable housing,
local hiring and a park. At least 70% of the estimated 5,500 permanent
jobs will pay living wages.</TE>
<TE>   And the agreement--negotiated with the assumption that the hotel could
require as much as $75 million in public help--is binding even if the
properties change hands.</TE>
<TE>   LAANE's San Fernando Valley operation--the Valley Jobs Coalition--also
influenced development of a 17-acre North Hollywood project.</TE>
<TE>   The $218-million project--a housing, office and retail complex east of
Lankershim Boulevard and adjacent to the North Hollywood Red Line
station--received final council approval in December. The public price
tag: nearly $44 million.</TE>
<TE>   But for those dollars, the neighborhood also will get subsidized
housing units, a child-care center, local hiring and training and a
promise that 75% of the estimated 1,800 jobs at the site will pay the
living wage.</TE>
<TE>   Developer J.H. Snyder Co. also agreed to allow union organizing and
donated $10,000 to a local day laborers program for training.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not building an island," said Snyder partner Clifford P.
Goldstein. "To be successful, everyone in the area has to benefit."</TE>
<TE>   Padilla had tracked LAANE's efforts with interest, and last summer he
turned his eye to Roth's proposed SunQuest Business Park. Roth needed
land from the city, and Padilla let him know he wanted community perks in
exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Each neighborhood's needs are different, and when LAANE organizers
knocked on 400 doors in neighboring Pacoima and Arleta to call a meeting
last summer, a wish list started taking shape.</TE>
<TE>   Residents near the 33-acre property wanted protection from diesel
truck fumes. They wanted trees and better drainage and a say in the
project design. They wanted decent-paying jobs. And they wanted a teen
center.</TE>
<TE>   "If you ask for a little, you don't get anything," said Maria Trinidad
Navarro, a Guadalajara-born mother of three who lives near the site and
negotiated with the help of a translator. "We felt the power that we had
with unity."</TE>
<TE>   That call is being echoed across the country.</TE>
<TE>   One New York organization is tracking the more than $2 billion in city
and state funds that have been channeled to big corporations since 1994
to keep them from leaving Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   In Chicago, the Neighborhood Capital Budget Group is pushing to
channel redevelopment dollars into housing and job training for
low-income residents, instead of cycling them all back to private
developers.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been a galvanizing of public opinion that 'Hey, the rich
are getting richer and . . . a lot of it is because the general coffers
of society are subsidizing private developers,' " said Jacqueline Leavy,
the group's executive director. "People are beginning to say, 'What's in
it for us?' "</TE>
<TE>Some Say Benefits Will Strain Public Purse</TE>
<TE>   California cities are catching on too. Since its timber industry was
decimated a decade ago, Redding has lured manufacturers with special
perks. Now, it is considering tying those deals explicitly to job
quality.</TE>
<TE>   Companies that pay above Shasta County's average wage would be
eligible for subsidies in direct proportion to their own generosity.
Those that pay less wouldn't get a cent.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a little phrase up here that successful economic development
should not be hinged on the number of W-2s we help create but on the
numbers on the W-2s we help create," said Redding's economic development
director, Michael Mitchell.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some developers complain that they are being pressed to foot
the bill for problems beyond their control.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't work. You could get a half-million in public benefits that
end up costing you $6 million," said Tom Gilmore, who has developed
downtown loft housing with the help of state funds. "When you say, 'As
long as government dollars are involved, why don't we also feed starving
children in Afghanistan?' you take your eye off the ball, which is to do
housing and redevelopment."</TE>
<TE>   Of particular concern is a controversial California law that took
effect this year. The measure, sponsored by state Sen. Richard Alarcon
(D-Sylmar) and backed by construction unions, requires that "prevailing"
wages--which parallel union wages--be paid on all construction jobs that
receive even the slightest public help.</TE>
<TE>   Developers and advocates of affordable housing say it will make it
even harder to finance projects that benefit low-income neighborhoods.
And that will prompt a call for even fatter public handouts.</TE>
<TE>   Even the head of the city's redevelopment agency--which strongly
backed the North Hollywood community concessions--said the benefits
wrested from developers ultimately strain the public purse.</TE>
<TE>   The needed public subsidy for Snyder's project grew during the last
year from $32 million to $44 million, said agency Administrator Jerry
Scharlin, partly because of the burgeoning list of community benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "In this case, the stars lined up. We had the money," Scharlin said.
"In other places, by adding these burdens, you ultimately drive away
development. I worry about the ultimate success of this."</TE>

<HD>Esteemed Priest Calls for Accountability</HD>
<DH>Scandal: South Pasadena parish applauds criticism of church
leaders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a searingly blunt sermon that led to a standing ovation, one of
the Southland's most prominent priests exhorted the Roman Catholic Church
on Sunday to summon the "raw courage" to openly address the problem of
clergy sex abuse.</LD>
<LD>   That painful process would lead to the church's purification, said
Msgr. Clement J. Connolly, who served as secretary to Cardinals Francis
McIntyre and Timothy Manning before taking the reins at Holy Family
Church in South Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   Connolly, a priest for 38 years, told his congregations at all six
Masses that church leaders had failed the people in neglecting the
problem, which he said had caused irreparable wounds to victims, damage
to the priesthood and feelings of betrayal, anger and shame among many
Catholics. He said once-unquestioned church leaders must now be
accountable to the people, and he asked parishioners to accept his
remarks Sunday as "part of me being accountable as a pastor."</LD>
<TE>   "We have let this malignancy grow and allowed it to reach the awesome
proportions it has today," Connolly said of the sex-abuse problems. "Not
to speak about it now would be to compound and continue the malfeasance."</TE>
<TE>   Roman Catholic leaders in Southern California have yet to give a
public accounting of their handling of priestly abuse cases. Church
sources maintain that Cardinal Roger M. Mahony in recent weeks dismissed
or forced the resignations of a number of priests who were involved in
molestation incidents but continued to work for the archdiocese. However,
the archdiocese has declined to confirm those actions. It has issued two
general statements on the problem of abuse, apologizing to victims and
explaining church policies.</TE>
<TE>   While leaders of the Los Angeles archdiocese and the Diocese of Orange
settled a major priest-molestation lawsuit last year, a case earlier this
year in Boston focused unprecedented national attention on the practice
in some dioceses of moving priests in sexual-abuse cases to other
churches rather than firing them. In many cities, scores of new victims
have come forward, and dioceses have begun reexamining their policies.</TE>
<TE>Mahony's Efforts Called 'Honest'</TE>
<TE>   In remarks after Mass, Connolly declined to dwell on the failures of
church leaders and said that Mahony, who presides over 5 million
Catholics in 292 churches in the region, was making a "sincerely honest"
effort to deal with the issue. The Los Angeles Police Department is
investigating whether any of the departed priests had committed a crime,
and officers have said the archdiocese has promised to cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   The publicity has also led to what may be an unprecedented
conversation between priests and their parishioners on the sensitive
issue of clergy sexual abuse. Los Angeles archdiocese spokesman Tod
Tamberg said priests throughout the Southland are reporting that they
have begun to speak about the issue regularly to parishioners. Some
churches have reportedly started small discussion groups to share their
emotions over the crisis. A recent letter to the faithful from Mahony on
the issue, in which he called child abuse criminal and "seriously
sinful," has inspired some priests, such as Connolly, to preach homilies
on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Tamberg said Connolly's call to hope amid despair was starting to
reverberate throughout the archdiocese. He said there was an emerging
conviction that "somehow we'll get through this and be a stronger
church."</TE>
<TE>   In his sermon, Connolly put the message this way: "What's happening is
good for the church," he told parishioners. "Bad for its image, maybe,
but good for the church. In some miraculous way . . . through the growing
of the Holy Spirit in the church, we will find our way to a new day in
which there is more honesty, courage, faith and accountability."</TE>
<TE>   According to new archdiocesan policies, any priest found guilty of
sexual misconduct with minors will be dismissed and encouraged to leave
the priesthood. Mahony also ordered all priests in public ministry last
week and this week to attend workshops to review archdiocesan
sexual-abuse policies, receive advice on how to maintain "healthy
boundaries" and learn the legal requirements of reporting suspected child
abuse.</TE>
<TE>   In his public remarks, Connolly, 62, said the current crisis presented
perhaps the greatest challenges he has ever faced. He traced the
evolution of the priest as the once "uncontested oracle of the moral
order" to a figure whose iconic standing today has been "badly damaged,
perhaps even destroyed" by the scandals.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a new age when the servant-priest stands before people and asks
for their blessings," said Connolly, who was ordained in Ireland in 1964
and has built Holy Family into a 4,000-family congregation with a
$4-million annual budget that includes more than 80 ministries, a school,
pastoral center and youth center.</TE>
<TE>   Then the monsignor appealed to his flock: "Pray. Pray for your
priests."</TE>
<TE>   His remarks drew tears and sustained applause. Although one
parishioner described it as "spin control," others hailed what Claudia
Fosselman called Connolly's "courage and tenderness" in urging open
debate and an embrace of victims as a "precious part of the church."</TE>
<TE>   Diana Casares Bell, a South Pasadena attorney, said her faith has been
strengthened by the scandals rather than shaken.</TE>
<TE>   "I see the church doing the right thing," she said. "I think these
corrective and healing steps will unify the church."</TE>

<HD>'Pat' Weaver, Pioneer at NBC-TV, Dies at 93</HD>
<DH>Media: Creator of 'Today' and 'Tonight' programs lessened the
control of advertisers over shows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sylvester L. "Pat" Weaver, a visionary television executive whose
programming innovations, including NBC's "The Tonight Show" and "Today"
show, continue to flourish half a century after their introduction, has
died. He was 93.</LD>
<LD>   Weaver died Friday night of pneumonia at his home in Santa Barbara,
but his death was not reported until late Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   During his tenure at NBC, which lasted from 1949 to 1955, Weaver
dreamed up programming formats that became staples of the medium,
including the first network morning program, "Today," which recently
commemorated its 50th anniversary; and the prime-time special, a term
Weaver derived from the word "spectacular."</LD>
<TE>   In a 1999 interview, Weaver, the father of actress Sigourney Weaver,
said he had been "hired to guide television into what it had a chance of
becoming."</TE>
<TE>   "I think Pat was one of the programming geniuses of television and
really started many of the programming forms that live on today," said
Thomas Sarnoff, the son of NBC founder General David Sarnoff, who
elevated Weaver to president of the network in 1953.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps as notable as the programs he conceived, however, was the
manner in which Weaver changed the television business itself.</TE>
<TE>   Breaking from the formula that governed radio, he diminished
advertisers' control over program content by moving NBC toward a model in
which the network produced its programs and then sold time to multiple
sponsors. Before then, a single advertiser oversaw each show, with
networks providing little more than facilities and advertising agencies
supplying the programming.</TE>
<TE>   Weaver described the revised approach as a "magazine concept," because
advertisers in print bought space without dictating editorial content.
Other networks eventually adopted the practice, which by the 1960s became
the industry standard.</TE>
<TE>   "I consciously said it would be better if we build a television
service that was not [advertising] agency-run, because there you must do
what the client wants, and while a lot of the public interest will be
covered, they still won't want to do a lot of things that ought to be
done," Weaver explained in the book "Live TV."</TE>
<TE>   Weaver came to that conclusion after working as an advertising
executive himself before joining NBC as a vice president. Only a few
million people had television sets at that time, and CBS dominated the
nascent medium, with eight of the top 10 programs.</TE>
<TE>   Under Weaver, NBC launched such memorable series as "Your Show of
Shows," the sketch comedy starring Sid Caesar. The network also began
running "spectaculars"--drawing a huge audience, for example, with Mary
Martin in "Peter Pan"--which Weaver saw as a way to create excitement,
inspire more families to buy TV sets and challenge the "robotry of habit
viewing."</TE>
<TE>   The executive also championed educational programs that came to be
known as "operation frontal lobes," reflecting his conviction, as he
stated in 1951, that one of television's goals should be "enlargement of
the horizon of the viewer." In more recent years, Weaver lamented the
near-absence of such programs on the major networks.</TE>
<TE>   Not all Weaver's innovations were immediately hailed by his
colleagues. Many NBC-affiliated stations at first resisted plans for
"Today," which some labeled "Weaver's Folly" before its launch in 1952.</TE>
<TE>   The show, hosted by Dave Garroway, became a huge success, as did "The
Tonight Show," which made its debut two years later with Steve Allen as
host.</TE>
<TE>   NBC's current chairman, Bob Wright, called Weaver "the first major
creative force in television programming and one of the most innovative
executives in the history of television. Pat's influence on NBC is still
seen by millions of viewers every day, from the 'Today' show to 'The
Tonight Show' and much else in between."</TE>
<TE>   Tall and flamboyant, Weaver was described in Robert Metz's book, "CBS:
Reflections in a Bloodshot Eye," as "an inveterate memo writer whose
outpourings to his staff soon lined the shelves of his office in 40 bound
volumes."</TE>
<TE>   Weaver ultimately headed NBC for only two years before he was replaced
by Sarnoff's son, Robert, and subsequently returned to advertising.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1960s, he also headed an early foray into pay cable,
Subscription Television Inc., but the venture failed, in part due to the
combined efforts of broadcasters to block it.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think he enjoyed the problems of running a company as much as
he did creating shows," said Thomas Sarnoff, who is president of the
Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences' charitable foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Los Angeles, Weaver was the son of a well-to-do owner of a
roofing manufacturing business. Weaver graduated from Los Angeles High
School and went on to Dartmouth, where he majored in philosophy and
graduated magna cum laude.</TE>
<TE>   He wanted to write fiction and did so on a post-college trip to Europe
and Egypt, but the stories didn't sell, and Weaver returned to Los
Angeles. He found work at an advertising agency before taking his first
job in broadcasting, at radio station KHJ, where he wrote, sold ads,
produced and directed programs and even acted in some radio dramas.</TE>
<TE>   Weaver worked in radio in San Francisco before landing in New York,
working briefly at NBC before moving to the ad agency that was planning
and producing comedian Fred Allen's radio program. He quickly became
supervisor for the agency's radio division.</TE>
<TE>   In his 1994 autobiography, "The Best Seat in the House," Weaver
recalled how he became Allen's on-air foil when, as the producer of
Allen's show "Town Hall Tonight," he turned to two men talking in the
control booth and asked them to leave.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my first show, and you're bothering me," Weaver said, only
later discovering that the two men he ousted were Deke Aylesworth,
president of NBC; and Lee Bristol, president of Bristol-Myers, the
program's sponsor.</TE>
<TE>   According to Weaver, the incident cemented his relationship with
Allen, who would periodically put him on the program as a villain, "Mr.
Weaver of Young &amp; Rubicam," when he lampooned advertising agencies.</TE>
<TE>   In early 1941, Weaver did some work for the government organizing the
broadcasting of anti-fascist radio programs to South America. After Pearl
Harbor, Weaver went into the Navy, where he spent two years in command of
an escort vessel. He also produced the radio program "Command
Performance," for the armed forces overseas.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, he went back to work for ad agencies before joining NBC
in 1949.</TE>
<TE>   Weaver was one of the first inductees into the television academy's
Hall of Fame and was again honored as a TV pioneer at the 50th annual
Emmy Awards in 1998, taking the stage alongside his daughter Sigourney.</TE>
<TE>   "No other person has shaped and molded the look of television more,"
John Mitchell, the then-president of the academy, said when Weaver
received the organization's prestigious Governors Award in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   Weaver remained active well into his 80s and has been involved in
charitable organizations, among them as a fund-raiser in the fight
against muscular dystrophy.</TE>
<TE>   The oldest of four children, his younger brother, Winstead "Doodles"
Weaver, was a comedian and actor featured with the Spike Jones orchestra,
while his sister, Sylva Weaver Rowland, was fashion editor at the Los
Angeles Times in the 1930s.</TE>
<TE>   Weaver and his wife, Elizabeth, marked their 60th wedding anniversary
in January. In addition to his wife and daughter, he is survived by a
son, Trajan, five grandchildren and a great-grandchild.</TE>

<HD>Anaconda Winds Down as Troops Scout Al Qaeda, Taliban Stragglers</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BAGRAM AIR BASE, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Five hundred American and Canadian troops remained in the mountains
of eastern Afghanistan on Sunday, looking for caves that might still be
hiding Taliban or Al Qaeda fighters, as the U.S. military said its 16-day
operation in the area was winding down.</LD>
<LD>   Against a background of giant Chinook helicopter rotors stirring up
the dust of this air base north of the capital, Kabul, soldiers back from
days of searching for armed extremists in the Shahi Kot valley said they
had successfully flushed out and killed at least five enemy fighters
Thursday and Friday.</LD>
<LD>   They also said that more caves and firing positions were being found
that had been used by Al Qaeda and the Taliban. Evidence indicated that
their foes were experienced, well-armed and professional soldiers, the
troops said.</LD>
<TE>   Operation Anaconda, the largest battle of the war in Afghanistan, was
proclaimed an unvarnished success by the U.S. military even though fewer
than expected bodies of Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters had been found in
the Shahi Kot area and there was a strong suspicion among America's
Afghan allies that many of the terrorists managed to escape.</TE>
<TE>Hundreds of Terrorists Killed, U.S. Major Says</TE>
<TE>   "We have destroyed their command and control. We have destroyed their
caches [of weapons]. We have killed hundreds of the Al Qaeda terrorists
who now will not be around to kill innocent men, women and children,"
said Army Maj. Bryan Hilferty, spokesman for the 10th Mountain Division,
briefing reporters here.</TE>
<TE>   And even though the operation was winding down, he emphasized, "the
hunt continues."</TE>
<TE>   Hilferty said U.S. and Canadian troops still in eastern Afghanistan
were on high ground and Afghan allies were on the floor of Shahi Kot
valley, which until last week was the largest known stronghold for
Taliban and Al Qaeda die-hards in the nation. About 20 caves had been
uncovered, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that it was St. Patrick's Day, Hilferty vowed: "Just as St.
Patrick is renowned for ridding Ireland of snakes, we will continue to
rid Afghanistan of the Al Qaeda and Taliban snakes."</TE>
<TE>   Even though the U.S. forces and their Afghan allies had declared the
valley taken Wednesday, several small groups of Al Qaeda fighters were
discovered after they came out of hiding.</TE>
<TE>   Soldiers of the 10th Mountain Division said that they killed at least
one Taliban member Thursday and that, before dawn Friday, four Talibs
were spotted and eventually killed in a firefight with Afghans allied
with the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Canadian Pvt. Shane Scofield of Lower Sackville, Nova Scotia, said his
company had scoured parts of the mountains Thursday and Friday. On seeing
an enemy cave, he said, the soldiers would fire a shoulder-launched
rocket-propelled grenade round to kill anyone inside and to detonate any
mines or booby traps. After looking for sensitive intelligence materials,
they would use C-4 explosive charges to block the cave's entrance.</TE>
<TE>Holdouts Could Be Buried Alive</TE>
<TE>   Although they did not see any enemy troops, Scofield said, "the
possibility that some were buried alive is high. There could be hundreds
buried in there. There is just no way of knowing."</TE>
<TE>   Scofield's companion, Cpl. Chris Desjardins, called it nerve-racking
work walking for hours without rest over the unfamiliar terrain in thin
high-altitude air, looking out both for enemies and for mines and booby
traps.</TE>
<TE>   "You're a little nervous at first, obviously, but you get into your
mission. You have to know if you screw up, you might die or someone else
might die," said Desjardins. But "once the adrenaline kicks in, you fall
back on your training."</TE>
<TE>   "It felt good to be out there doing a job," said Cpl. Landon Perry,
another Canadian, who had emblazoned his cap with the letters
F.A.T--Fight Against Terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Army Lt. Andrew Exum, 24, of Chattanooga, Tenn., said that based
on what he had seen, the Army had been up against professional soldiers,
not teenage dropouts. He described the enemy as "battered, but they know
what they are doing."</TE>
<TE>   Exum, who had come back from the field Friday, said his platoon had
blown up the entrance to a natural "spider hole"--a small cave with a
small opening to offer fighters protection.</TE>
<TE>   The platoon also came upon and destroyed a large firing position that
may have been used by snipers and mortar teams, he said. It was
surrounded by a low stone wall, he said, and contained stockpiles of
food, ammunition and medical supplies.</TE>

<HD>Cleric's Killing Sends Colombia Into Mourning</HD>
<DH>S. America: Archbishop had denounced rebels, paramilitaries, drug
dealers and corrupt politicians. Slaying marks milestone in war.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia
</DL>
<LD>This country plunged into mourning Sunday for the archbishop of
Cali, Isaias Duarte Cancino, whose slaying marked a savage new milestone
in its internal conflict.</LD>
<LD>   Duarte was killed late Saturday as he left a mass wedding at a church
in a poor neighborhood of Cali, Colombia's third-largest city. Two men
approached and shot him four times at point-blank range, according to
witness and police accounts. Another priest was injured.</LD>
<LD>   Thousands of mourners waited hours to pass by the 63-year-old Duarte's
body as it lay in a glass-topped coffin in Cali's cathedral. In his
weekly address in Rome, Pope John Paul II condemned the killing, saying
the outspoken prelate had paid a "high price" for his work for peace.</LD>
<TE>   "This conflict has become so degraded that it has reached the level of
pure barbarity," said Father Gersain Paz, a spokesman for the diocese.
"Who would strike out against someone so beloved?"</TE>
<TE>   The identity of the assailants remained unknown Sunday, though
speculation focused on drug traffickers. The list of suspects was long.
Duarte was blunt and harsh in his attacks on the perpetrators of
Colombia's violence. In recent months, he had taken on drug dealers,
left-wing guerrillas and corrupt politicians.</TE>
<TE>   President Andres Pastrana called an emergency security council meeting
in Cali to coordinate efforts to find the killers. The government offered
a reward of more than $400,000 for information leading to their arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Alvaro Uribe, the leading candidate in upcoming presidential elections
and a close friend of Duarte, said the killing was a tragedy for the
country.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a grave and irreplaceable loss," said Uribe, who canceled
campaign appearances for the day.</TE>
<TE>   No matter who killed Duarte, the slaying of a top church figure is a
sign of growing desperation among the many armed groups in Colombia's
conflict.</TE>
<TE>   The 38-year-old war pits government and right-wing paramilitary forces
against leftist rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia,
known by its Spanish initials as the FARC, and the National Liberation
Army, or ELN.</TE>
<TE>   In the background are drug dealers and common criminals who account
for the bulk of the nation's violence. Of about 27,000 homicides each
year in Colombia, only about 15% are due to the war. The rest stem from
feuds, drug assassinations and other crimes.</TE>
<TE>   But only rarely have church leaders been killed, especially one as
high-ranking and well-known as Duarte. Church leaders were protected even
during the depths of the battles between drug lord Pablo Escobar and the
Colombian government in the early 1990s. The last killing of a church
figure in memory was the ELN's torture-slaying of a bishop in
northeastern Colombia about 12 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   In Latin America, where the Roman Catholic faith runs deep, the death
of a church figure has often marked a turning point in a nation's
violence.</TE>
<TE>   The 1980 slaying of Archbishop Oscar Romero by right-wing assassins in
El Salvador first gave notice of the growing brutality of the country's
civil war, raising questions in Congress about U.S. support.</TE>
<TE>   And the bludgeoning death of Bishop Juan Jose Gerardi of Guatemala in
1998 produced an outcry that resulted in the first successful
prosecutions of members of that country's feared intelligence service.
Gerardi had denounced the military as responsible for the vast majority
of the more than 200,000 deaths in the country's civil war.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we are in a complicated situation now," said Ana Teresa
Bernal, the director of one of Colombia's largest peace groups. "We can
only hope that this murder does not lead to more retaliations and
violence."</TE>
<TE>   Duarte gained fame after being appointed in 1988 as bishop of
Apartado, an impoverished city near the Caribbean coast that has been the
scene of some of Colombia's most brutal fighting in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   In the region around Apartado, all sides fought over territory and
access to the Caribbean, a lucrative transportation route for the drugs
that both the paramilitaries and the rebels use to finance their
activities. Duarte was critical of both groups, winning respect even from
those he criticized.</TE>
<TE>   One of those was Carlos Castano, the leader of the paramilitaries. In
a recent autobiography, Castano called Duarte a friend and said that the
archbishop had helped set up meetings between Castano and top government
leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "If there has ever been a priest that has been balanced in this war,
it was him," Castano recounted in his book. "Don't doubt that he
internationally condemned the guerrillas and us. He criticized both
sides."</TE>
<TE>   The mention stunned Duarte, who in a recent interview said he was
considering leaving the country.</TE>
<TE>   After Duarte became Cali's archbishop in 1995, he found himself in the
midst of yet more violence. In 1999, rebels from the ELN staged two
spectacular mass kidnappings, including one in which they seized 144
churchgoers after Mass in a wealthy section of Cali.</TE>
<TE>   Duarte was uncompromising in his condemnation, excommunicating
everyone who perpetrated the attack. Only weeks ago, he characterized
guerrillas and paramilitaries as "cowards" for assaulting civilians.</TE>
<TE>   But his undoing may have come last month, when he suggested that
several congressional candidates were financing their campaigns with drug
profits. He declined to give any names, but the nation's attorney general
opened an investigation into the charges.</TE>
<TE>   Police and government officials said Sunday that they had not ruled
out any suspects but that the killers were most likely affiliated with
drug dealers, perhaps working to protect the identity of one of the
politicians.</TE>
<TE>   Paz, the diocese spokesman, said Duarte knew that assassination was a
possibility. Despite police urging, he traveled without bodyguards
because he was fearful they would lose their lives in an effort to
protect him.</TE>
<TE>   "In a country like ours, where violence is everywhere--paramilitaries,
guerrillas, common criminals--there is always violence," Paz said.
"Everything he did was a risk."</TE>

<HD>U.N. Forum in Mexico to Focus on Poverty, Free Trade</HD>
<DH>Conference: Bush, Fox will meet on bilateral issues. Protests are
expected during week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY
</DL>
<LD>Devising a kinder, gentler brand of globalization tops the agenda
for a weeklong U.N. forum on development opening today in the
northeastern city of Monterrey, where more than 50 world leaders will try
to promote a "fully inclusive and equitable global economic system."</LD>
<LD>   The meeting's host, Mexican President Vicente Fox, and President Bush
will hold their own summit Friday at which Fox plans to press for
immigration reform, border aid and other concessions. Fox's campaign to
legalize 3 million illegal migrants in the United States was interrupted
by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The U.N. International Conference on Financing for Development will
run through Friday with the goal of producing a game plan for reducing
poverty and spreading the benefits of free trade more evenly around the
world.</LD>
<TE>   The conference comes amid growing opposition to free trade and
globalization in many quarters. Critics say a decade of open markets and
liberalized investment rules has not eased poverty and social inequality
in developing countries and has only made rich nations richer.</TE>
<TE>   In a Sunday column in the Mexico City newspaper Reforma, Mexican
novelist Carlos Fuentes likened the benefits of globalization to Mt.
Everest, calling them a summit that many poor countries cannot even see,
much less attain.</TE>
<TE>   This disenchantment was demonstrated by weekend marches at the
European Union's meeting in Barcelona, Spain. Tens of thousands of
demonstrators poured into the streets, a turnout that was typical of what
seems to occur now wherever world leaders convene.</TE>
<TE>   Protests are expected this week in Monterrey, although Mexican Foreign
Minister Jorge Castaneda said in a briefing with reporters last week that
he hopes the demonstrations will be "nonconfrontational."</TE>
<TE>   The United Nations and Mexico sought to accommodate globalization foes
by permitting an alternative four-day summit for nongovernmental
organizations that closed Sunday in Monterrey. However, a similar move by
Canada at the Quebec City hemispheric summit in April did not discourage
subsequent rioting.</TE>
<TE>   Among the proposals put forth by globalization foes are that developed
nations forgive billions in debts owed by the world's poorest countries
and that rich nations dedicate a portion of their economic output to
helping the neediest ones.</TE>
<TE>   Although no broad-based development fund is likely to come out of the
forum, wealthier nations have begun to get the message. Bush recently
pledged to give $5 billion in additional foreign aid to poor countries
over the next several years.</TE>
<TE>   In January, U.N. members approved a document recognizing the need for
a "new partnership between developed and developing nations" to further
economic growth. How that proposal--to be ratified by the world leaders
Friday--will be put in practice remains to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   The document also imposes demands on poorer countries to ensure
democracy, the rule of law, and human and women's rights.</TE>
<TE>   Castaneda said the Sept. 11 attacks created a new impetus for wealthy
nations to do more to reduce poverty because of the "link between poverty
and exclusion and fanaticism, the pond in which the [terrorist] fish
swim."</TE>
<TE>   After an executive session of world leaders Friday, Fox and Bush are
scheduled to huddle for three hours discussing a range of goals each has.
Mexico wants water for the Rio Grande Valley, U.S. immigration reform and
help in financing border infrastructure projects. The United States wants
more Mexican cooperation and data sharing in security efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Fox's bargaining position was strengthened by the capture March 9 in
Puebla, outside Mexico City, of perhaps the world's most wanted drug
trafficker, Benjamin Arellano Felix, Castaneda said. The arrest was proof
that Mexico is living up to its promise to the United States to get tough
with drug mobsters, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Chances are good that Mexico and the United States will unveil a
border security agreement after the summit. Details of the pact were
worked on during a visit to Mexico this month by Homeland Security
Director Thomas J. Ridge.</TE>
<TE>   The security agreement may include high-tech measures to speed the
flow of cross-border visitors and commerce, which has been slowed by the
added security and tougher inspections since Sept. 11.</TE>

<LD>Rwandan-backed rebels who threw peace efforts into disarray by
seizing a town in eastern Congo said they were ready to hand it over to
the United Nations to try to revive reconciliation talks.</LD>
<LD>   The capture of Moliro by the Congolese Rally for Democracy threatened
to derail negotiations aimed at ending three years of war that have
claimed 2 million lives, mainly through hunger and disease.</LD>
<LD>   Peace talks in South Africa were suspended last week after the
government protested the seizure of Moliro and France accused the rebels'
Rwandan backers of deploying their own troops in the fighting.</LD>
<TE>   The U.N., which has troops monitoring the cease-fire in Africa's
biggest war, has not entered the town.</TE>

Mecca. Fifty others were injured.</LD>

<LD>Portugal's Social Democrats drove the Socialists from power as
voters swung right and gave conservative parties a majority in parliament
for the first time in seven years.</LD>
<LD>   The Social Democrats pledged to cut corporate taxes, slash spending
and sell off some state companies to revive the economy. But their narrow
victory margin means they may have to negotiate a coalition with the
rightist Popular Party.</LD>
<LD>   Social Democrats won 40.12% of the vote compared with 37.85% for the
Socialists. The Popular Party, which opposes immigration and abortion,
received 8.75%. The Social Democrats won 102 seats in parliament and the
Popular Party got 14, giving them together a slim majority in the
230-seat body.</LD>

<LD>The urine of women who take the contraceptive pill is changing the
sex of male fish and could also be making Englishmen less fertile, a
newspaper reported.</LD>
<LD>   Fears for the sperm count, in decline for decades, arose after
Environment Agency research showed that half of all the male fish in
low-lying English rivers were changing sex as a result of water
pollution, the Independent on Sunday said.</LD>
<LD>   The research showed that an "exquisitely potent" form of the female
hormone estrogen, found in the urine of women taking contraceptive pills,

<HD>U.S. Push for Truce Continues in Mideast</HD>
<DH>Conflict: Gunman kills Israeli teen, and troops enter central
Bethlehem. American envoy prods two sides to meet and says violence won't
deter him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEL AVIV
</DL>
<LD>U.S. efforts to achieve a cease-fire in Israeli-Palestinian
fighting gained momentum Sunday despite a Palestinian shooting attack
that claimed the life of an Israeli teenager, a suicide bombing in
Jerusalem and an Israeli incursion into Bethlehem.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli and Palestinian security officials held talks Sunday night at
the urging of U.S. envoy Anthony C. Zinni, who said he was determined not
to let violence undermine his efforts to quell the fighting that has
raged here for nearly 18 months.</LD>
<LD>   "These attacks will not deter my efforts to continue to work with both
sides to bring the Israeli-Palestinian confrontation to an end," the
retired Marine Corps general said in a statement released by the U.S.
Embassy in Tel Aviv after the shooting in the central Israeli town of
Kfar Sava. "At the same time, it is critical that the Palestinian
Authority take responsibility and act against terror and punish those
responsible. Now is the time to get a cease-fire."</LD>
<TE>   A senior Palestinian official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the security meetings were technical talks on Israel's withdrawal
from all Palestinian-controlled territories as a prelude to a cease-fire.</TE>
<TE>   In Bahrain, Vice President Dick Cheney said he hoped the U.S. mission
will bear fruit by the time he lands here for talks today.</TE>
<TE>   Hours before Zinni held his third meeting in four days with
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat in the West Bank city of
Ramallah, a Palestinian opened fire with a pistol on a main street in
Kfar Sava.</TE>
<TE>   The attacker fired two clips at passersby, many of them teenagers from
a nearby high school who were on their lunch break. Amar Shakhshear, 25,
shot Noa Orbach, 18, to death and wounded 15 other people before he was
gunned down by bystanders and police officers. The Al Aqsa Martyrs
Brigade, a militia linked to Arafat's Fatah movement, later said he was a
member but had acted on his own.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to Israel Radio, the dead girl's brother, Amit Orbach,
captured the growing sense of helplessness Israelis feel in the face of
recent bombings and shootings.</TE>
<TE>   "My brother is getting out of the army today after being a warrior in
Lebanon," Orbach said. "Nothing happened to him there, and here a girl
goes to school and doesn't come home."</TE>
<TE>   Two hours after the shooting, a Palestinian carrying a bomb threw
himself at a municipal bus in Jerusalem's French Hill neighborhood,
blowing himself to pieces and slightly wounding several people. Islamic
Jihad, a militant Islamic group, took responsibility for the attack.</TE>
<TE>   The force of the blast hurled part of the bomber's body through the
front windshield of the bus, Jerusalem police spokesman Gil Kleiman said.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw the No. 22 bus waiting for the red light," witness Eran Maor
said. "There was a big explosion. I saw smoke rising from the bus, and I
saw people in shock. Many of them were covered with bits of flesh. I
think the flesh belonged to the terrorist."</TE>
<TE>   The shooting and bus bombing came after two days of relative quiet but
as Israeli security agencies warned that more attacks were imminent. In
the north, the mayor of Nahariya, on the coast near the border with
Lebanon, took the unusual step of canceling school for the day and
telling residents to stay inside because of warnings of a possible
infiltration from Lebanon.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Israeli troops and tanks briefly rolled into the center of
Bethlehem in the West Bank, waging fierce gun battles with Palestinian
fighters near the Church of the Nativity, on the site where Christians
believe Jesus was born, and killing a gunman affiliated with the Al Aqsa
Martyrs Brigade before withdrawing.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian officials have said they will not hold cease-fire talks
with the Israelis until they withdraw from all Palestinian-controlled
territories. Israel launched a massive military offensive in Palestinian
cities, villages and refugee camps just over two weeks ago, saying it
wanted to break the back of the "terrorist infrastructure" and inflict
casualties as the prelude to a cease-fire.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement issued Sunday night, the Israeli Defense Ministry said
the security talks being held were between field-level commanders and
were meant "to begin a process of cooling things down."</TE>

<HD>Zimbabwe Leader Sworn In</HD>
<DH>Africa: Robert Mugabe, calling for unity, takes office for a fifth
term after disputed election.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN M. SIMMONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HARARE, Zimbabwe
</DL>
<LD>Sounding a note of reconciliation in the wake of a bitterly
contested election, veteran President Robert Mugabe was sworn in here
Sunday for another six years at a ceremony boycotted by Western diplomats
and the country's political opposition.</LD>
<LD>   Addressing senior ruling party officials and dignitaries from
neighboring African nations, Mugabe called on all Zimbabweans to unite,
regardless of their politics, but made no mention of a possible coalition
government.</LD>
<LD>   "Our country beckons us to join hands in a formidable unity of purpose
as we vigorously engage in our various national endeavors," Mugabe, 78,
said as he began his fifth term in office.</LD>
<TE>   In power since Zimbabwe won independence from Britain in 1980, Mugabe
was declared the winner of this month's election Wednesday after three
days of voting that international and local observers condemned as
massively flawed.</TE>
<TE>   His inauguration came as Presidents Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and
Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, who were due to arrive in Harare today,
stepped up diplomatic efforts to prevent Zimbabwe's possible suspension
from the Commonwealth, the association of Britain and its former
territories, because of the election's perceived irregularities.</TE>
<TE>   Official results gave Mugabe 56% of the vote, compared with 42% for
Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic
Change, or MDC, who called the election "daylight robbery."</TE>
<TE>   "The position of our national executive is that the official election
result is illegitimate and does not reflect the true will of the people
of Zimbabwe," said MDC Secretary-General Welshman Ncube.</TE>
<TE>   Mugabe used his swearing-in as another opportunity to launch a
scathing attack on Britain, accusing it of trying to impose a government
on the southern African nation and vowing that "never again shall
Zimbabwe be a colony."</TE>
<TE>   "We have dealt a stunning blow to imperialism," said Mugabe, whose
ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front, or ZANU-PF, has
accused Tsvangirai of being a stooge of Western powers. He added: "You
certainly have been able to see how Britain and its white allies have
blatantly sought to ensure that this last presidential election be won by
their protege."</TE>
<TE>   Opposition leaders said the often antagonistic tone of the president's
speech proved that he and his party were only halfheartedly extending a
hand of friendship.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly ZANU-PF is unrepentant," Ncube said. "They are still in their
combative mood. They are blaming everybody for their own incompetence.
There is absolutely nothing reconciliatory about that. It's the old
ZANU-PF on the warpath against so-called imperialism and on the warpath
against people who have rejected ZANU-PF."</TE>
<TE>   Ncube said the MDC had dismissed any idea of taking part in a
coalition government because that would serve to endorse what the
opposition party and others view as Mugabe's stolen victory.</TE>
<TE>   "A government of national unity that accepts the results of the
election, that would put him in power for another six years, is not
something that we are in a position to negotiate about," Ncube said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the opposition might be willing to join a "national
transitional government," which would use a determined period of time to
work on a new constitution and pave the way for another presidential
election.</TE>
<TE>   Without such a scenario in the cards, analysts said, it would be up to
Mugabe to deal with Zimbabwe's pressing social and economic issues.</TE>
<TE>   Inflation has soared to an annualized rate of about 117%, and
unemployment has topped 60%. A severe shortage of maize, the main diet
for ordinary Zimbabweans, has left more than 500,000 in need of food
assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Mugabe "has to respond to the crisis in his country and embark on a
program of reform," said Richard Calland, a senior political analyst at
the Institute for Democracy in South Africa. "What our polling shows is
that Zimbabweans are sick and tired of worsening levels of poverty and
unemployment, and they want a government that can put them in a position
that would allow the economy to grow."</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Mugabe promised to do just that by creating more jobs,
increasing agricultural production, promoting black empowerment and
speeding the government's controversial land reform program, which seeks
to wrest land from the white minority for the resettlement of landless
blacks.</TE>
<TE>   "The land reform program must proceed with greater speed and strength
so the losses and drawbacks of the current drought-ridden season can be
overcome," he said.</TE>
<TE>   White commercial farmers own an estimated 70% of Zimbabwe's best
farmland. Proponents of land reform say those farmers have had it too
good for too long.</TE>
<TE>   "They make a lot of money," said Sam Moyo, an independent local
political analyst who has written extensively on land reform. "They don't
need to sit on all of that land to make that money. It's better to
redistribute it, so that other people use it and make money and become
self-subsistent."</TE>
<TE>   "Realistically, the only way that Mugabe is going to deliver on the
land issue is with international support, and he is going to have to do
that through South Africa," said Francis Kornegay, program coordinator at
the Center for Africa's International Relations at the University of
Witwatersrand in South Africa.</TE>
<TE>   A regional economic powerhouse that still commands respect from the
West, South Africa is seen by analysts as the key to helping Zimbabwe get
back on the path of good governance. If it failed to do that and Zimbabwe
became a rogue state, South Africa would probably share the negative
consequences, including a halt in international financial engagement in
the continent, the analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a contagion effect," Calland said. "Perceptions are very
important in business, and the international investor community tends to
adopt quite a crude analysis."</TE>
<TE>   "The South African government may not like it, but the reality is that
it will be harder to aid the continent if Americans perceive that South
Africa and the region [are] unwilling to stand up for democratic
principles," Republican U.S. Rep. Ed Royce of Fullerton said in a
statement last week.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Mugabe thanked African nations that endorsed his reelection
for their "joint effort in rejecting neocolonialism," and he called for
the solidarity to continue.</TE>
<TE>   "We will continue to need your support in the future, possibly even in
the immediate future, as imperialist maneuvers against Zimbabwe persist,"
he said.</TE>

<HD>Kurdish Mayors' Job Is a High-Wire Act</HD>
<DH>Turkey: City leaders find it hard to balance their constituents'
demands for ethnic expression against higher officials' suspicions of
separatism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMBERIN ZAMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>VIRANSEHIR, Turkey
</DL>
<LD>Being a mayor in southeastern Turkey, where most people are
Kurdish, can be tricky. You've got to satisfy the voters' desire to
express their ethnic identity more openly, without raising suspicion
among Turkish officials that you are encouraging separatism.</LD>
<LD>   Last summer, after two years in office here, Emrullah Cin hit upon
what he thought was a safe formula: He organized a festival to celebrate
the shelengo, a strain of cucumber that, he claims, grows only in
Viransehir and requires no water. Shelengo is the Kurdish word for the
vegetable.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought, Kurdish or not, cucumbers were pretty harmless," Cin
recalled with a wry grin during a recent interview.</LD>
<TE>   The Turkish regional governor, however, disagreed. He banned the
event, saying it posed a "threat to the indivisible unity of the Turkish
state."</TE>
<TE>   Such are the difficulties facing Cin and 33 other mayors whose
election in 1999 gave local political power for the first time to a
pro-Kurdish group in Turkey. So far, they have been able to do little to
relieve decades of Turkish repression of the Kurdish culture and
language. There are an estimated 13 million Kurds in Turkey, constituting
20% of the population.</TE>
<TE>   "We are wearing shirts of fire," said Cin, a 35-year-old former
schoolteacher, using a Turkish metaphor for risky missions.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the Kurdish mayors, all members of the People's Democracy
Party, remain popular. Yet the Turkish government's treatment of them
ranges from the unabashedly discriminatory to the patently absurd.
Turkish prosecutors have accused some of the mayors of trying to sow the
seeds of an independent Kurdish homeland.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike their counterparts from other political parties, the Kurdish
mayors are routinely barred from events organized by Turkish officials
and face what Cin calls an undeclared economic embargo by the central
government in Ankara.</TE>
<TE>   "Every single project I sought funding for has been rejected," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   With a long history of drought and no local industry, this city of
160,000 people long relied on trade with Iraq. But legal trade ended when
the United Nations imposed sanctions on Turkey's southeastern neighbor
following Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Nowadays, the city gets by on a
small amount of oil smuggling.</TE>
<TE>   A 15-year-long conflict between Turkish forces and separatist
guerrillas of the Kurdistan Workers Party has prompted thousands of
people to move to Viransehir from surrounding rural villages, further
straining the city's resources.</TE>
<TE>   When Cin became mayor, he found that the city owed its employees 23
months' worth of back wages and had an additional $2.5 million in debts.
"The [central] government did not lift a finger for us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Life could get worse for the Kurdish mayors if Turkey's constitutional
court upholds a demand by the state prosecutor that their party be banned
on charges that it acts as the guerrillas' political wing. Hundreds of
the party's officials have been detained during the last year in violent
police raids, and 10 of the mayors face criminal charges as they struggle
to run their cities.</TE>
<TE>   Mehmet Yasik, a Kurdish mayor who brokered peace between two feuding
Kurdish families in the province of Adana last month, wound up on trial
for his efforts, accused of "aiding and abetting terrorists" allegedly
involved in the dispute.</TE>
<TE>   The constitutional court is expected to rule on the party's legality
in the coming weeks. A ban would further jeopardize chances of European
Union membership for Turkey, which also has balked at an EU demand that
it ease restrictions on use of the Kurdish language.</TE>
<TE>   Police have beaten and detained hundreds of university students across
Turkey in recent months for signing petitions urging that optional
Kurdish-language courses be added to the official school curriculum.
Turkish leaders say the campaign is orchestrated by the guerrillas, who
have observed a unilateral cease-fire since the capture of their
commander, Abdullah Ocalan, in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Turkish authorities have cast a wide net for Kurdish separatists and
hauled in some unlikely suspects. Seven families in the largest Kurdish
province, Diyarbakir, face trial on charges of "damaging the national
culture" by giving their children Kurdish names such as Berivan, Kurdish
for milkmaid, and Baran, which means rain.</TE>
<TE>   This month, Turkish prosecutors charged an elementary school teacher
in Diyarbakir, Recep Simsek, with "spreading terrorist propaganda" for
putting a Kurdish-language love poem on his wedding invitation. He faces
up to five years in prison if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Cin, in addition to having his festival banned, came under
investigation last year because of his city's new flag. The governor's
office said it was evocative of the red, green and yellow banner of the
guerrillas; the inquiry is continuing.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the city and its mayor appear to be thriving. The
municipality's debts all have been cleared, Cin says, largely because
residents who once made a habit of dodging property taxes and utility
bills now pay willingly and on time.</TE>
<TE>   The funds have helped build a health clinic for women, where a team of
young doctors and nurses is shattering religious and social taboos by
teaching mostly illiterate women how to use contraceptives.</TE>
<TE>   "The mayor changed my life," said Mekiye Bilge, 35, who after her
sixth baby decided to ignore pressure from her in-laws and stop bearing
children.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, citizens dug deeper into their pockets and raised
money for 8,000 new pipes to modernize and expand the city's sewage
system. "There is a huge sense of solidarity here," the mayor said. "A
burning need to show the rest of the country that we can take care of
ourselves."</TE>

<HD>Plutonium Boom Has Town Glowing</HD>
<DH>Economy: Residents credit a facility for burial of low-level
nuclear waste for their high-tech recovery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CARLSBAD, N.M.
</DL>
<LD>Plutonium is saving this town.</LD>
<LD>   David Brannan, who worked in the potash fields for 34 years, said his
new job--helping to bury plutonium in the subterranean salt beds 26 miles
away--allowed him to buy a snazzy new Honda Goldwing motorcycle.</LD>
<LD>   At his family-owned Chevrolet dealership, Phil Carrell is selling
high-end Suburbans, Tahoes and Corvettes to the scientists, engineers and
government managers who have followed the plutonium here.</LD>
<TE>   And Mel Vuk, provost of New Mexico State University's local campus,
blushes that he is able to hire part-time instructors who are highly
educated specialists working at the plutonium burial site.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like Christmas--all these people with high-tech degrees who are
in town and willing to teach," he said. "It's changed the academic
landscape of Carlsbad."</TE>
<TE>   So it goes in this windblown, blue-collar town of 27,000 people in
southeastern New Mexico, which faced an economic meltdown with the
collapse of the local fertilizer industry and is now recasting itself as
an improbable center of nuclear know-how.</TE>
<TE>   The change in Carlsbad's fortunes came with the creation of the U.S.
Department of Energy's first and only underground repository of low-level
nuclear waste.</TE>
<TE>   Many New Mexico politicians and environmentalists opposed development
of the site because of perceived dangers, but Carlsbad's civic leaders
say the project's trade-offs--minimal risks for high-grade
employment--were well worth it.</TE>
<TE>   The benefits accrued here could also occur in Las Vegas, some Nevadans
suggest, if the federal government succeeds in developing Yucca Mountain
as a dump for highly radioactive waste.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents counter that any possible benefits to Las Vegas with the
development of the $60-billion project are far outweighed by its risks.</TE>
<TE>   Since opening in 1999, Carlsbad's $2.5-billion Waste Isolation Pilot
Plant, or WIPP as it is affectionately known here, has safely disposed of
more than 14,000 55-gallon drums crammed with clothing, rags, tools, soil
and equipment contaminated by plutonium, a fuel for nuclear reactors and
a key ingredient in nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The radioactive rubbish is trucked here from Rocky Flats near Denver,
from Los Alamos near Santa Fe, and from other federal defense facilities.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the materials intended for Yucca Mountain, 90 miles from
Las Vegas, include spent nuclear fuel rods that emit gamma rays that can
quickly kill people exposed to them. The waste will need to be buried in
impenetrable containers handled by robots, deep inside the mountain, but
still be accessible for retrieval, perhaps hundreds of years from now,
for possible recycling.</TE>
<TE>   But while Nevada officials are fighting development of Yucca Mountain,
which would add little employment to Las Vegas' economy, civic leaders
here welcomed plutonium for creating hundreds of jobs. Officials
calculate that WIPP generates 12% of the town's payroll.</TE>
<TE>   Town folks take comfort that plutonium emits alpha rays, which can be
stopped by a single sheet of paper or an inch of air. The long-term
danger comes if plutonium particles are accidentally released, become
airborne and are ingested or inhaled, damaging human tissue from within.</TE>
<TE>   Workers wearing normal clothes lower the barrels by hoists to rooms
excavated in the salt beds nearly a half-mile below the surface. Over
time, the salt seals the room like a natural trash compactor.</TE>
<TE>   When a plutonium burial site was proposed and rejected in Kansas for
geological reasons in 1972, Carlsbad came courting. The local potash
industry, which mined the barren fields and pastures for fertilizer, was
struggling against worldwide competition, and the town needed a new
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Bob Forrest notes that every locally elected politician for 25
years has welcomed the government's plutonium business. Environmental
lawsuits delayed the opening of the facility for years.</TE>
<TE>   To help overcome opposition, Congress promised New Mexico $300 million
over 15 years. Most of the money is being spent on highways, including
detours around Santa Fe and Carlsbad so the radioactive containers will
not be driven through the middle of the towns.</TE>
<TE>   When WIPP opened, hundreds of people welcomed the first delivery of
plutonium. "We are the Department of Energy's success story," Forrest
said.</TE>
<TE>   About 820 people work at the site; 667 are employed by Westinghouse
Electric Co., under federal contract to construct and operate the
facility. The company is the largest employer in Carlsbad.</TE>
<TE>   About half of its workers were hired locally, including many former
potash miners. Others, including technicians, engineers and nuclear
scientists, moved here from elsewhere--and have slowly adjusted to a
quiet town with a Sears, a Wal-Mart, a bowling alley and two three-screen
movie theaters, one indoors, one outdoors.</TE>
<TE>   An additional 140 people work at a Westinghouse subsidiary that
constructs the stainless steel containers that each carry 14 barrels for
transport to Carlsbad aboard flatbed trucks.</TE>
<TE>   Jesse Laman, 43, is paid $16.80 an hour as a container welder,
compared to $14.53 he made hourly as a mechanic in the potash fields.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got benefits, a retirement program, all that," he said. "I
wouldn't still be in town if it weren't for this job."</TE>
<TE>   The benefits of WIPP to Carlsbad extend beyond new, blue-collar
employment--and suggest what might occur in Las Vegas if Nevada is unable
to stop the development of the Yucca Mountain project.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Energy funded a $25-million environmental monitoring
and research center at the local New Mexico State University campus.</TE>
<TE>   Its 29 scientists and technicians monitor air, soil, water, plants and
employees to detect any radiological releases, and conduct radioactivity
research for other government and private laboratories.</TE>
<TE>   "The type of work we're doing here on plutonium is not done anywhere
else in the world," said its director, Joel Webb.</TE>
<TE>   Health physicist Dave Schoep, hired away from a Las Vegas laboratory
to work at the research center, speculates that if Yucca Mountain is
developed, southern Nevada, like Carlsbad, would reap new science
projects.</TE>
<TE>   "The natural progression of Yucca Mountain would be spinoff science
work," he said.</TE>
<TE>   State university officials in Las Vegas wouldn't comment on that
possibility, in order to not undercut the state's arguments against Yucca
Mountain.</TE>
<TE>   But already, the University of Nevada at Las Vegas has won a
$3-million federal grant to study technologies to refine spent nuclear
fuel, and its faculty hopes the federal government will build a proton
accelerator at the Nevada Test Site, near Yucca Mountain, to bleed
high-level nuclear waste of its radioactivity.</TE>
<TE>   Carlsbad would like the accelerator project as well.</TE>
<TE>   Carlsbad's mayor said he is thankful that the materials buried here

<HD>More Imagination Could Bring Energy Plan, Middle East Peace</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>At home and abroad, the headlines last week offered the same
message: On issues of vital American interest, there's no substitute for
presidential leadership.</LD>
<LD>   Throughout his political career, President Bush has preferred to
operate with a concentrated focus on a few priorities. That's served him
well in organizing a systematic response to the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks. But the world doesn't permit any president the luxury of tunnel
vision. When a president doesn't engage a difficult problem, bad things
usually happen. Which is the lesson of the past few days from disparate
events in the Middle East and on Capitol Hill.</LD>
<LD>   In the Middle East, the violence reached the point that Bush felt
compelled to dramatically escalate his administration's involvement in
the confrontation between Israel and the Palestinians. In rapid fire,
Bush sent back his special envoy to the region after a 60-day hiatus,
engineered passage of a United Nations resolution on the crisis and for
the first time condemned Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, as well as
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, for the bloodshed.</LD>
<TE>   This flurry was equally welcome and overdue. When the Bush team first
arrived, they appeared guided in the Middle East largely by a
determination not to do whatever the Clinton administration had been
doing. Bill Clinton immersed himself in negotiations between Israel and
the Palestinians. So Bush came in cool and distant. Secretary of State
Colin L. Powell even declared that American "over-involvement . . . tends
to keep people [in the region] from making the kinds of decisions they
have to make."</TE>
<TE>   It probably made sense for Bush to initially step back after the
failure of the Camp David talks in July 2000 and Clinton's frenetic
search for agreement in his final days in office. But the last year has
demonstrated the danger of sustained U.S. disengagement. No American
president can solve the Middle East problem (no leader anywhere may be
able to solve the problem in terms of producing lasting harmony). But the
horrifically escalating violence has validated the grim prediction of
Dennis Ross, the special Middle East envoy for both Clinton and the
administration of Bush's father, who last summer warned that if the
United States leaves the two sides "to their own devices, things will
[only] get worse."</TE>
<TE>   It's taken Bush some time to reach that conclusion himself. But his
latest moves suggest he now understands that allowing the conflict to
spiral out of control threatens American interests (such as maintaining a
secure coalition against terror). Close observers say the administration
is still leery of assuming as much responsibility as Clinton did for
brokering any deal. But Bush may have no choice but to plunge in more
deeply than he wants, just to avoid all-out war. It turns out that
keeping Israel and the Palestinians from each other's throats isn't an
optional part of the president's job.</TE>
<TE>   The stakes aren't as high, but the need for greater presidential
engagement is just as great back at home in the faltering push for a
comprehensive energy plan.</TE>
<TE>   If anything, the turmoil in the Middle East should intensify our
efforts to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil. But in a lopsided vote
last week, the Senate killed the energy bill's principal means of
reducing domestic oil consumption: a mandate that auto companies
significantly improve fuel economy in cars, trucks and SUVs. Instead, the
Senate voted to let the Transportation Department set the standard. This
week, in perfect parallel, the Senate will likely reject the bill's
principal idea to increase domestic oil production: a measure to open the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to exploration. While the bill still
contains some worthwhile ideas--like requiring government and utilities
to buy more of their electricity from renewable sources such as
solar--it's not clear they will survive this week's debate. And even if
they do, they wouldn't make much of a near-term dent in America's foreign
oil habit.</TE>
<TE>   This outcome was depressingly predictable. In 1992, the last time
Congress tried to craft a comprehensive energy plan, that bill also
passed only after the fuel economy and Arctic drilling provisions were
removed. The result was legislation that did nothing to reverse our
growing reliance on foreign oil. In 1992, imports provided 46% of
America's oil. Now it's up to 59%. If nothing changes, the Energy
Department projects that the figure will near 66% by 2011. Even with
better fuel economy and Arctic drilling, experts say America's reliance
on foreign oil would continue to grow. But it would grow much less
quickly--and sometimes, as in the Middle East, it's a genuine victory
just to avoid the worst-case scenario.</TE>
<TE>   Energy legislation has been derailed by a familiar syndrome in
Washington: the all-or-nothing delusion. Democrats (joined by
environmentalists) believe they can pass the fuel economy standards while
blocking Arctic drilling. Republicans (working with the oil and auto
industries) believe they can open the Arctic while blocking tougher
mileage standards. But the unavoidable lesson of the last decade is that
neither side can impose its preference on the other. Demanding all, each
gets nothing. "It's the same issues year after year," says Rachel
Bronson, a national security analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Bush so far has bought into the all-or-nothing
delusion. He has pushed hard for Arctic drilling and opposed the tougher
fuel economy standard. That's the classic, head-down, pound-the-line
legislative strategy Bush has employed on most issues.</TE>
<TE>   But this is a moment that calls not so much for determination as
imagination in the Oval Office. Even if Bush can restore Arctic drilling
when the energy bill reaches a House-Senate conference committee,
Democrats would just filibuster the legislation when it returns to the
Senate. A better option is a national security compromise: significantly
improved fuel economy standards in return for increased domestic
drilling--if not in the Arctic refuge, then on other public lands now
off-limits.</TE>
<TE>   Legislators in both parties have been unable to rise above the pull of
their own constituency groups to envision such a breakthrough. Only the
president could make it happen. Without a new presidential initiative,
there's little hope of breaking the impasse on energy. Or, even more
urgently, breaking the bloody impasse between Israel and the
Palestinians.</TE>

<LD>A new approach to keeping arteries flowing smoothly after
angioplasty shows astonishing success in early testing, apparently
solving a major shortcoming of this common procedure.</LD>
<LD>   Doctors on Sunday released the longest follow-up with the new
technique--the drug-coated stent. In testing on 43 patients over two
years, they found it to be 100% effective, an accomplishment almost
unheard of in medicine.</LD>
<LD>   More than 1 million Americans undergo angioplasty annually, and the
new approach is likely to be used on most of them if these promising
early results hold up in further testing. They could be on the market as
early as next year.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a very hot topic, potentially revolutionary in the treatment
of coronary artery disease," said Dr. Spencer King III of Emory
University.</TE>
<TE>   During angioplasty, doctors fish tiny balloons through clogged heart
arteries, then inflate them briefly to open up blood flow. Frequently,
though, the arteries squeeze shut again. In recent years, doctors have
often left behind tiny wire coils, called stents, to prop the arteries
open.</TE>
<TE>   However, about 25% of the time, the reopened artery closes off, a
condition called restenosis. It usually occurs when fast-growth scar-like
tissue fills the artery, and it must be fixed with a repeat angioplasty
or a coronary bypass.</TE>
<TE>   The solution to this dilemma appears to be a new kind of stent that is
coated with medicines that gradually ooze into the artery. The drugs keep
cells from growing.</TE>
<TE>   The first hint of their potential was made public in September at a
European heart conference, and more data were released Sunday at a
meeting of the American College of Cardiology in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   At least eight varieties--coated with different growth-inhibiting
medicines--are in testing, and many more are under development. The first
was Cordis Corp.'s stent coated with the immune-suppressing drug
rapamycin, tested on patients in Brazil and the Netherlands.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. J. Eduardo Sousa of the Dante Pazzanese Institute of Cardiology in
Sao Paulo, Brazil, presented two years of follow-up with those 43 initial
patients. All of the areas treated with the Cordis stents are flowing
freely.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Sidney Smith, chief medical officer of the American Heart Assn.,
cautioned that large, careful studies must be finished comparing the new
stents with the ordinary kind.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, he said, "these are very impressive and very encouraging
results. When you see zero restenosis at one year, it's a breakthrough.
It's almost too good to believe when you see zero."</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturers have not said how much the products will cost, but Stone
said the price is likely to be about double that of ordinary stents,
which sell for around $1,400.</TE>
<TE>   King said the cost might limit their use, as doctors often install
several stents during an angioplasty.</TE>

<HD>Tipper Gore Won't Seek Tennessee's Senate Seat</HD>
<DH>Politics: She ends rumors that she might pursue her husband's
former post, being vacated by the GOP's Fred Thompson.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Tipper Gore said Sunday she has decided not to run for her
husband's old Senate seat from Tennessee this year.</LD>
<LD>   "It would be such an honor to work for the people of Tennessee," Gore
said in a statement. "However, I have decided that it is not right for
me, right now, to seek to represent them in the United States Senate."</LD>
<LD>   Gore, wife of former Vice President Al Gore, made the decision after
spending the weekend discussing the Senate race with associates,
spokesman Jano Cabrera said. She had cut short a trip to California to
return to Tennessee on Saturday to consider the race.</LD>
<TE>   Word emerged Thursday that Gore was considering running. Democratic
sources said she had to make a decision quickly because Rep. Bob Clement
(D-Tenn.) had expressed interest in running for the Senate seat, which is
being vacated by Republican Fred Thompson.</TE>
<TE>   Clement announced Friday that he would hold a news conference today
regarding the race. Tennessee Democratic Party Chairman Bill Farmer said
he expected Clement to announce his candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   Al Gore held the seat from 1985 to 1993. When he was elected vice
president as Bill Clinton's running mate, Democrat Harlan Mathews was
appointed temporarily to replace him. In 1994, Thompson defeated
Democratic Rep. Jim Cooper to replace Mathews.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate seat opened up when Thompson announced two weeks ago that
he would not seek reelection. The surprise decision turned what had been
considered a safe Republican seat into one expected to be among the most
highly contested this fall.</TE>
<TE>   The filing deadline for the Senate race is April 4.</TE>
<TE>   On the Republican side, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and Rep.
Ed Bryant have announced their candidacies.</TE>
<TE>   Tipper Gore is known for her advocacy on mental health issues. She
became interested partly because her mother suffered from severe
depression. She also has acknowledged being treated for depression after
her son Albert III was hit by a car in 1989 and almost died at age 6.</TE>
<TE>   "I am passionate about mental health and family issues and my work in
those areas will continue to be my focus," she said in her statement
Sunday. "I will also work to elect the Democratic nominee for the United
States Senate and all our Democratic candidates."</TE>

<HD>Finance Bill to Pass Soon, Daschle Vows</HD>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Senate will pass campaign finance legislation by week's end
even if lawmakers must work around the clock to overcome opponents'
stalling tactics, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "I believe we will get it done, either the easy way or the hard way,
but it will be done by Friday," said Daschle (D-S.D.).</LD>
<LD>   A final vote on the bill, which would bring about the most significant
changes in a quarter century in how campaigns are financed, could come as
early as Wednesday. Passage would send it to President Bush, who has
indicated he would sign it.</LD>
<TE>   The bill, introduced by Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Russell D.
Feingold (D-Wis.), bans the hundreds of millions of dollars that
corporations, unions and individuals give to the national political
parties in unregulated "soft money." It also restricts in the final days
before an election the "issue ads" that often indirectly attack
candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Republican opponents, who say the restrictions on contributions
violate 1st Amendment free speech rights, acknowledge that they are in
the minority. But even if supporters gain the 60 votes needed to limit
debate, Senate rules provide opponents with 30 hours to debate the
measure.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle has threatened to hold the Senate in all-night sessions if
necessary to exhaust the time available to opponents intent on
filibustering.</TE>

<LD>Toyota Camry was the most stolen vehicle model for the fifth
straight year on an annual list that monitors such trends.</LD>
<LD>   Overall, vehicle thefts fell 2.7% last year, according to
Chicago-based CCC Information Services Inc., an insurance industry
tracker.</LD>
<LD>   Not surprisingly, the cars most often stolen were the perennial sales
leaders. Of the 25 most-stolen cars on the list, 19 were Camrys and Honda
Accords or Civics of different years. The year and model most stolen was
the 1991 Camry.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't know for certain why a vehicle is stolen," said the
company's president of sales and service Mary Jo Prigge.</TE>
<TE>   CCC determines its list of most-stolen vehicles by analyzing total
losses submitted to it by more than 350 property and casualty insurers in
North America.</TE>
