<HD>Meeting the Little People on the Way Back Down</HD>
<DH>For years, Mike Ovitz didn't just make deals, he drew
blood. Many on the wrong end of his wrath now can't hide their glee.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RACHEL ABRAMOWITZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For Hollywood, it's the Gary Condit story of the early summer, L.A.'s
answer to New York's fascination with the beleaguered Martha Stewart.
"It certainly has struck a chord," notes producer Tom Pollock, former
chairman of Universal Pictures. "When I wanted to talk to people
about Vivendi Universal or Time Warner--which is really important
stuff--all anybody wants to talk about is Mike Ovitz and the gay
mafia."</LD>
<LD>   Ovitz's self-immolation in the pages of the August issue of Vanity
Fair, in which he claims a "gay mafia" engineered his downfall, has
flared up higher than any Westside barbecue.</LD>
<LD>   It's just the kind of delicious gossip that passes for communal
bonding here; despite what Ovitz might say, hatred of Mike Ovitz
crosses all class and clique lines. It's an enmity that links all the
warring social groups that make up Hollywood. Indeed, those truly in
the know are already talking about what author Bryan Burrough cut out
of the piece, allegedly vile and incendiary remarks by the onetime
super agent that never would get by any libel lawyer. "That's the
Holy Grail. The unedited tapes," one top executive says with a sigh.</LD>
<TE>   Certainly, the town could use a diversion. Why would anybody want
to talk about the implosion of Universal, a $30-billion media company
that employs thousands of people in L.A.? Or the ongoing turmoil at
the top of AOL Time Warner or whether Michael Eisner will survive
another year at Disney? Who among the Armani class really wants to
dish about the fact that they're getting poorer every day as the
stocks of the various entertainment-media conglomerates tumble?
Almost every big entertainment story is another reminder that
Hollywood is fast becoming just another division in huge multifaceted
companies run by moguls who view the entertainment business as a
wayward stepchild.</TE>
<TE>   The Mike Ovitz story is different. It's the tale of a local boy
gone very, very bad. The true Hollywood titans are fading out. Gone
are Lew Wasserman and Steve Ross. Bob Daly and Terry Semel have moved
on to the Dodgers and Yahoo, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood-style paternalism of those men--and of Ovitz--is a
thing of the past. In a town where fortunes are increasingly affected
by the rise and fall of the German stock market, Ovitz's public
humiliation is refreshingly human-scale. It's deeply personal. Ovitz
didn't buy and sell companies, sending fortunes tail-spinning; he was
mean to the little people. He broke Hollywood's cardinal rule: "Be
nice to those on the way up because you'll meet them again on the way
down."</TE>
<TE>   For Ovitz, the way down from the agency he co-founded, Creative
Artists Agency, included an aborted stint as the No. 2 of the Walt
Disney Co. and the failure of his new management company, Artists
Management Group.</TE>
<TE>   Yet his beef with DreamWorks SKG founder David Geffen, in Ovitz's
mind the architect of his demise, goes back to a fairly routine
tangle over the 1982 movie "Personal Best," a time when Ovitz was
king and Geffen didn't yet have his billions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   This week, it was hard to find anyone sympathizing with Ovitz's
poor-me scenario, even after he apologized for his remarks. Still,
almost no one was willing to disparage even a flogged and dead horse
publicly.</TE>
<TE>   In Ovitz's heyday, "he acted just like the Wizard of Oz. I think
of him huffing and puffing and threatening and it turned out to be a
guy behind the curtain with a lot of levers," a prominent marketing
executive says.</TE>
<TE>   One well-known producer who'd locked horns with Ovitz adds: "This
idea of poor victim Michael Ovitz: David Geffen is out to get him.
Why did Michael Eisner fire him? How did David Geffen mastermind
that? He was mean-spirited. He would make everyone bleed on every
deal if he had the upper hand."</TE>
<TE>   "Seriously, the man's ego has just taken over," says another top
producer. "If he actually thinks there's a cabal formed with the sole
intention of destroying him, that's an ego at work."</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of the most pathetic throwings of blame I've ever read.
It was so weird and homophobic. What kookiness," says another top
player. "I think people are just fascinated by this incredible fall
from grace, that no matter how powerful you are it can all be gone in
a blink of an eye. It's also the reminder that maybe karma really
does matter."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, most believe that Ovitz really did have enemies, such
as Geffen, or Universal Chairman Ron Meyer, or Ovitz's former
proteges at his onetime agency CAA. Yet, as one Hollywood sage said,
"If Mike Ovitz had made the same self-pitying interview with Bryan
Burrough but hadn't used the word 'gay mafia,' it wouldn't have been
such an interesting story. It's the 'gay mafia' part of it."</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally among a certain set of high-powered cognoscenti, the
term "gay mafia," or "velvet mafia," has been used to refer to a
tiny, select group of friends of which Geffen happens to be a
prominent member. It's more of a tony social clique, akin, say, to
the high-testosterone pack of heterosexual players who go
river-rafting together, or the Hollywood wives who pal around.</TE>
<TE>   It's hardly a monolith, encompassing every one of the many
prominent gay men and women in town, and the few heterosexual members
who get to join because they hate Ovitz. Notes Scott Seomin of the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, "There is not a gay
mafia, but there is a large number of gays and lesbians compared to
other industries. Hollywood is not run by any one group, gay, Jewish,
African American or otherwise. Just as there is no exact recipe for a
blockbuster film, converting to Judaism or coming out of the closet
is not going to make you successful."</TE>
<TE>   As one studio head says, "It's nonsense. No one has ever called me
and influenced what I do."</TE>
<TE>   Zvi Howard Rosenman, a producer who is gay, adds: "There are
enough straight people to be able to help you if you have the
product."</TE>
<TE>   Still, a producer who also is gay, quips: "Judging from my phone
sheet yesterday, if there wasn't a gay mafia, there is one now."</TE>
<TE>   To most, Ovitz's "gay mafia" comment was just more evidence of how
out of step he was with the times, at least in Hollywood. "Public
homophobia is out of style," notes one top executive. "It's in very
bad taste. It's like going around making racist comments." Indeed,
already there's a generation to whom Mike Ovitz is simply a
fascinating relic of another era. To them, the story of Mike Ovitz is
just that--another Hollywood story of a bygone era, a slightly
mythological figure like David Begelman or Howard Hughes.</TE>
<TE>   "I never talked to him on the phone," explains one of Hollywood's
bright new stars. "When he was the king of kings, I was a lowly
servant."</TE>

<HD>Renovation Playing at the Apollo</HD>
<DH>Arts* Backers expect to spend $250 million to restore and
expand the historic theater in Harlem.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHAKA FERGUSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Sammy Davis Jr. strolled out, stared at the audience and lost his
voice. Smokey Robinson taught the Temptations the words to his latest
song, "My Girl," moments before they took the stage. And a family
named Jackson appeared on Amateur Night and became superstars.</LD>
<LD>   For decades, the Apollo Theater was a citadel for black
entertainers and a proving ground for promising stars, an epicenter
of black American culture. And then, after years of neglect, it went
dark.</LD>
<LD>   Now, the aging theater is about to undergo a bold renovation and
expansion to turn it into a major cultural and performing arts
center.</LD>
<TE>   In the coming years, theater managers hope to spend $250 million
to transform the former burlesque hall into a high-tech multiplex,
complete with clothing store, restaurant and recording studio.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, "Harlem Song," a new musical from George C. Wolfe,
will premiere at the Apollo--the first extended engagement in the
theater's 88-year history.</TE>
<TE>   The play, which chronicles life in 20th century Harlem through
song and dance, is an ensemble production written and directed by
Wolfe, who directed the Pulitzer Prize-winning play
"Topdog/Underdog." "We have a chance to be much more than a music
hall," says Derek Johnson, president of the Apollo Theater
Foundation. "We want to show the world just how hard we are working
to reclaim the stature that the Apollo traditionally has had."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the first phase of the initial $50 million in
renovations is underway, starting with external repairs. The Apollo's
famous marquee is being restored with as much of its original
material as possible. Marble and granite work from the 1920s
discovered under the exterior paint will be restored as well as the
theater's terra-cotta detail.</TE>
<TE>   The theater will be shuttered from January to August 2003 for
extensive internal improvements.</TE>
<TE>   The New York architectural firms Davis Brody Bond, which restored
the New York Public Library and worked on the expansion of Lincoln
Center, and Beyer Blinder Belle will lead the restoration effort. Two
Harlem-based firms, Bordy-Lawson Associates and Jack Travis
Architect, also have been contracted to work on the
landmark-designated theater.</TE>
<TE>   The internal renovation will include installation of new digital
lighting, a new sound system to replace the antiquated one in use,
new carpeting and seats, repairs to the roof, expansion of the
restrooms, upgrades to heating and air conditioning, renovation of
the dressing rooms and the addition of wheelchair ramps and lifts for
the disabled.</TE>
<TE>   The rowdy Amateur Nights, a hallmark of the Apollo, will go on a
35-city tour, including stops in Tokyo and London, during the
restoration.</TE>
<TE>   The theater was on the brink of financial ruin when Johnson, a
former AOL Time Warner executive, replaced Rep. Charles Rangel
(D-N.Y.) last year as chairman of the Apollo foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The Apollo was not marketed effectively in the past, says Johnson,
who plans to exploit the theater's rich history and name to rebuild
its image as a major entertainment venue and cultural attraction.</TE>
<TE>   "There is something in marketing called equity, and the equity
hasn't been used," says Howard Dodson, director of the Schomburg
Center for Research in Black Culture and a foundation board member.
"It's the Apollo name, more than the name of the performers, that
attracts the audience."</TE>
<TE>   The Apollo has been a New York legend on Harlem's 125th Street
since the building first went up in 1914. It soon became Hurtig and
Seamon's New (Burlesque) Theater, which featured striptease and
vaudeville acts that played to white audiences; blacks were not
allowed in.</TE>
<TE>   But in 1928, new owners changed the name to Apollo and later began
showcasing black entertainers to mixed audiences as Harlem's racial
makeup began to change. In 1932, Duke Ellington rocked the rafters
when his band performed "It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That
Swing)." Amateur Night began in 1934, launching the careers of such
legends as Sarah Vaughan and Ella Fitzgerald.</TE>
<TE>   For the next few decades, many major entertainers appeared on the
Apollo's stage: Count Basie, Ellington, Nat "King" Cole, Billie
Holiday, Stevie Wonder, Diana Ross, Louis Armstrong, Sam Cooke, Bo
Diddley, Aretha Franklin and the Jackson 5.</TE>
<TE>   By the 1970s, with big acts commanding big salaries, the
small-capacity theater--with only 1,477 seats--couldn't keep up, went
bankrupt and closed its doors in 1975. After a failed attempt as a
movie house, it closed altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Inner City Theatre Group rescued the cultural icon from ruin in
1981 and found a decaying interior: rotting pipes, sloppily plastered
artwork, ruined dressing rooms. Inner City refurbished the theater
and reopened it in 1985 for live shows. The group also tried to turn
the Apollo into a production facility for recording, videos and
commercials, but the idea never succeeded.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the Apollo has new hope.</TE>
<TE>   This month's annual JVC Jazz Festival held some performances at
the Apollo. In May, Jazz at Lincoln Center held its spring gala at
the Apollo, with Stevie Wonder jamming with Wynton Marsalis. In
April, Michael Jackson and Tony Bennett headlined a fund-raiser for
the Democratic Party at the Apollo. Dick Parsons, chief executive of
AOL Time Warner and a member of the Apollo foundation's board,
recently held the company's annual stockholders meeting there.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson wants to attract major events to the theater, such as the
Grammy Awards, held in the past at Radio City Music Hall and Madison
Square Garden, which both have a greater seating capacity than the
Apollo.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson also wants the theater to host game and talk shows,
political debates and town hall meetings. And true to his business
roots, he would like to merchandise the Apollo name, stamping its
logo on everything from T-shirts to coffee mugs.</TE>
<TE>   "That is the product by which we are most broadly known," he says.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to expand the Apollo, the theater foundation is
negotiating a deal to lease the neighboring state-owned Victoria
Theater. The long-range plan, which would cost $250 million and take
years to complete, also includes taking over the four shops situated
between the Apollo and the Victoria and giving the center a single
grand facade by joining the two spaces.</TE>
<TE>   "Our major constraint has been the 1,500 seats requires that we
charge more or subsidize our programming," Dodson says. "With the
larger venue, you can play in the existing market and not be as
dependent upon the subsidy."</TE>
<TE>   While the Apollo is one of New York's top attractions, many
visitors only see the historic theater from the top of buses, where
they take snapshots and move on, said Christyne Nicholas, president
of NYC &amp; Company, the city's tourism agency.</TE>
<TE>   "It already is an attraction, but it would be so much more
meaningful to have it as an attraction that people can go and see a
show, or have a meeting or reception or an event," Nicholas says.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson wants to give tourists a reason to get off the bus. He
also wants to keep 125th Street thriving after dark. "We want to
expand the activity here and broaden the type of things we do. I want
it not merely in music, but in a broader plane of entertainment," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   But some Harlem residents fear the new Apollo might forget about
them. Anthony Bowman, director of the Harlem Assn. for Travel and
Tourism, urged the Apollo to seek the advice of local merchants. He
fears the renovation and expansion will price local residents out of
the venue. Dressing the Apollo up, he says, will not attract tourists
if the theater loses its integrity as a cultural icon. Harlem
residents don't want to see it become the "AOL Time Warner Apollo,"
Bowman says.</TE>
<TE>   Dodson acknowledges that the theater's renovation could lead to an
increase in prices. "But the simple fact is that you cannot have
people wanting development without change," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson says the restoration is far broader than revitalizing a
theater. "We have an obligation to be a catalytic engine that drives
revitalization of this entire community."</TE>

<HD>Fox's 'Pulse' Gets In-House Help From Cable News Staff</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA BRENNAN</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Pulse," a newsmagazine-style series that premieres Thursday at 9
p.m. on the Fox broadcast network, owes its underpinnings to cable's
Fox News Channel: It's anchored by FNC's Shepard Smith and
executive-produced by William Shine, who also is FNC's executive
producer.</LD>
<LD>   And FNC's Bill O'Reilly will get a segment called "Guess Who's
Annoying Me Now," recalling Andy Rooney's segment on "60 Minutes."</LD>
<LD>   "I would never compare Bill O'Reilly to Andy Rooney," Shine said.
"Bill's straightforward. He's in your face. When he's finished, you'd
never say, 'I wonder what he meant?' "</LD>
<TE>   Shine said the show will keep tabs on pop culture, present a
weekly poll by Lori Dhue showing where Americans stand on various
issues and offer what it vows will be "the most outrageous video
clips of the week."</TE>
<TE>   During the show's nine-week run, Geraldo Rivera will do
investigative pieces, and Dhue, Linda Vester and Catherine Herridge
will report stories from around the country.</TE>
<TE>   Shine, marking nearly six years at FNC, acknowledged that creating
the newsmagazine while running the cable news channel is a challenge
but said that for him, that's nothing new. "It just means a lot of
sleepless nights, and you don't spend weekends with your barbecue,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Shine, who was not part of the earlier newsmagazine "Fox Files,"
said Fox Broadcasting contacted him to do "The Pulse." "They called
us up and said, 'Hey, can you guys give us a product for the summer?'
"</TE>
<TE>   And so they are. "We're going to give the reports to you in the
Fox style--faster paced than, say, 'Dateline NBC,' with big, bold
graphics and music," he said.</TE>

<HD>An Opera Couple's Abridged but Ardent 'Romeo'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL CARIAGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whatever you want to call it--a "Romeo" quickie or "Highlights From
Gounod's 'Romeo and Juliet' "--this 90-minute precis of the
four-hour, five-act opera on the "Great Performances" series is worth
watching.</LD>
<LD>   It is admirable primarily because of the impassioned and
controlled singing of Roberto Alagna and Angela Gheorghiu in the
title roles, the solid leadership of veteran conductor Anton Guadagno
and the atmospheric natural scenery of the rural Czech Republic,
including the 13th century Royal Castle of Zvikov, where the
performance was shot.</LD>
<LD>   Running less than 75 minutes (the opera usually unfolds in more
than three hours), Gounod's irresistible score is compacted and
streamlined drastically. But the lovers' duets and some arias remain,
sung ardently and handsomely by the Sicilian-French tenor and his
Romanian soprano wife, both in fine voice, though not heard to best
advantage in the mediocre television acoustic.</LD>
<TE>   Still, the strong chemistry between the couple is palpable, and
their acting convincing in every way. They move through the castle
archways and balconies and across forested pathways with dramatic
compulsion. Their youth, and the heat of their emotions, come
through.</TE>
<TE>   Surrounding the fated couple are serviceably credible friends and
relatives, their parts pared to minuscule size.</TE>
<TE>   Director Barbara Willis Sweete moves the principals around
convincingly, but creates zombie-like movements and expressions for
the regimented chorus, who wear slick and stylized medieval costumes,
from designer Christian Gasc, that clash with the lovers' clothes and
the ancient castle setting.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gounod's "Romeo and Juliet," in French, with English subtitles,
will be presented on "Great Performances" on KCET tonight at 9.</TE>

<HD>The Bolder Woman</HD>
<DH>In several new movies, the May-September relationships
don't involve a man chasing after a pretty young thing. Instead,
older women are seeking younger guys.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here's to you Mrs. Robinson: With the number of films coming out this
summer in which an older woman gets involved with a very young or
even teenage guy, it's starting to look more like the "Summer of '42"
than the summer of '02.</LD>
<LD>   In "Tadpole," which is to open July 19, a 15-year-old boarding
school student (newcomer Aaron Stanford) becomes infatuated with his
stepmother, played by Sigourney Weaver.</LD>
<LD>   In "Lovely &amp; Amazing," currently in theaters, Catherine Keener
plays a discontented wife and mother who fools around with a
17-year-old photo store boss (Jake Gyllenhaal).</LD>
<TE>   In "The Good Girl," which is to open Aug. 7, married discount
store clerk Jennifer Aniston has an affair with her 22-year-old
co-worker (also Gyllenhaal).</TE>
<TE>   And earlier this year, Andie MacDowell played a headmistress who
falls for her 25-year-old former student (Kenny Doughty) in "Crush."</TE>
<TE>   On Broadway, an adaptation of "The Graduate" with Kathleen Turner
and Jason Biggs is a box-office sensation. And in recent years
television shows ranging from "Dawson's Creek" to "Friends" to
"Judging Amy" have dealt with the story line, as have the films "Y Tu
Mama Tambien," "In the Bedroom" and the "American Pie" movies.</TE>
<TE>   It's about time, some are saying.</TE>
<TE>   Relationships between older women and younger men are "becoming a
lot more prevalent in society ... [but] there's still a lot of stigma
attached to it," says Felicia Brings, co-author of "Older Women,
Younger Men: New Options for Love and Romance." These films are "an
indicator that people are willing to at least address it, talk about
it not in a shameful way," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "What's interesting is how slow movies are to come to this kind of
thing, how the older man-younger woman thing is absolutely routine"
in movies, says film critic Molly Haskell, author of "Holding My Own
in No Man's Land: Women and Men and Film and Feminists." And although
older films like "The Graduate" looked at the subject from the young
man's point of view, "Lovely &amp; Amazing," "The Good Girl" and "Crush"
are written around the female characters.</TE>
<TE>   Mike White, who wrote "The Good Girl," says, "In this culture that
prioritizes youth, I don't think it's a coincidence that we're seeing
that women connect to this"--the idea of being with someone
younger--"as much as men have throughout history of film and
literature."</TE>
<TE>   With boundary-pushing shows like "Sex and the City" and the
recently canceled "Ally McBeal" "in the popular media now, women are
allowed to express their sexual desire more straightforwardly," says
Thomas Wartenburg, professor of philosophy and film studies at Mount
Holyoke College and author of "Unlikely Couples: Movie Romance as
Social Criticism."</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever forces there are in society that tell the society that
women stop having their sexuality at 35 is just insane," says Bebe
Neuwirth, who in "Tadpole" plays the stepmother's friend who beds the
young man.</TE>
<TE>   "Women get sexier and sexier as they get older, as many men do as
well. They get better at it, and they get more confident in
themselves," says the actress, whose boyfriend is nine years younger
than she.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a fact that society doesn't want to look at, which is
women come into their sexual peak in their late 30s, and men hit
their sexual peak around 21," says "The Good Girl" director Miguel
Arteta, whose first film, "Star Maps," also featured a relationship
between a young man and an older woman.</TE>
<TE>   "Definitely, when I was in one of these relationships, that's
something that I thought made sense," he says. "Women can start
exploring their sexuality in really profound ways, in ways that they
weren't capable in their early 20s. And the perfect person to do that
with is a man in his early 20s."</TE>
<TE>   Gyllenhaal, who plays the younger man in "Lovely &amp; Amazing" and
"The Good Girl," says, "I will be [so] presumptuous [as] to speak for
many younger men that find older women incredibly attractive."</TE>
<TE>   That this attraction is being represented in film is a change from
the norm. "Whereas the older man and younger woman [pairing] is
almost expected as part of social custom ... a woman is not supposed
to desire someone who might be the age of her son," Haskell says.
"The idea of a mother having sexual feelings toward a young man is
something that is an outrage; it offends us.</TE>
<TE>   "It's offensive because we want the mother to be a repository of
what is good and pure and nurturing."</TE>
<TE>   That the current incarnation of Mrs. Robinson on Broadway "is
allowed to be considerably older than the young man and treated not
as a grotesque," as she is in the 1967 film, is a long way to come,
Haskell says.</TE>
<TE>   But in "Lovely &amp; Amazing" and "The Good Girl," it seems to be less
about sex for the women than escape or their own immaturity. "Both
Jennifer's character and Catherine's character are two women who are
not grown up and have not figured out what they want from their life,
so they go back to the age at which they started trying to figure
that out," Gyllenhaal says.</TE>
<TE>   "Lovely &amp; Amazing" writer-director Nicole Holofcener says of the
character in her film, "There's a part of her that's still 17, very
much still the homecoming queen wanting that kind of glory and
excitement in her life.... He was the right person for her at that
moment."</TE>
<TE>   "She's so emotionally arrested in development," Keener agrees.
"Luckily, I think, she moves away from that and realizes, ' ... What
am I doing?' during the course of the movie."</TE>
<TE>   'Last Best Chance'</TE>
<TE>   In the pivotal scene of "The Good Girl," Aniston's character is
literally at a crossroads, deciding at a stoplight whether to drive
toward her disaffected lover or back to her mundane life with her
pothead husband and monotonous job. She asks herself whether she
should take her "last best chance."</TE>
<TE>   The young man becomes a fantasy for her, Arteta says. Even "when
her fantasy starts becoming a nightmare, when the younger man who
seems so attractive and so intellectual starts looking like a
deranged alcoholic, she still longs for him."</TE>
<TE>   In "Tadpole," a number of older women are charmed by Stanford's
precocious character, a teenager who would rather discuss Voltaire
than attend a Moby concert. "For me it's like a reverse coming-of-age
movie more than anything else," director Gary Winick says. "He's a
40-year-old trapped in a 15-year-old's body and, by the end, he
becomes a 15-year-old again," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Can any relationship with such an age difference last? "I think
two people could come together for a specific time in their life when
it feels appropriate and right, but to sustain that, I think, would
be highly unlikely," Winick says.</TE>
<TE>   "Very often, men in their 20s are not able to handle a
relationship, even with a girl who's in her 20s," Brings says,
"because they're not settled and they're still exploring who they are
and developing who they are. But if the maturity level is there and
the willingness to commit to a relationship is there, then what
difference does it make if the girl is 25, 35, 45?"</TE>
<TE>   "I've had relationships with women who are eight years older than
me and it's just as challenging or good as other relationships,"
Arteta says. "And the one realistic issue comes if you want to have a
family, because there is a biological reality to that."</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes it is about love ... and then I think that other times
it becomes a question of perversity and filling holes where maybe
parents didn't fill," Gyllenhaal says. "I think in 'The Good Girl'
it's pretty evident that he finds this woman and falls in love with
her because he's not really loved by his parents," while in "Lovely &amp;
Amazing," "that is more about [his] curiosity and sexuality."</TE>
<TE>   Says Wartenburg, "It seems to me one of the things that the films
are asking us to do is to really see how much of our reaction to
relationships is conditioned by social assumptions, and as you
actually look at two individuals, who knows what could make things
work?"</TE>
<TE>   "Tadpole," "Lovely &amp; Amazing" and "The Good Girl"--which,
coincidentally, all screened last month at the IFP/West--Los Angeles
Film Festival and, along with "Crush," at Sundance in January--all
treat the older woman-younger man dynamic with varying degrees of
humor. But is there a double standard? Would audiences be so quick to
laugh if these films were about 40-year-old men having sexual
relationships with high school or college-age women?</TE>
<TE>   "If you reverse the sexes in 'Y Tu Mama Tambien,' [if] you had a
man and two young women, you'd be horrified," Haskell says. "In other
words, the young men are [considered] more able to make decisions and
know what they're doing and less likely to be vulnerable in sex than
young women. Young women are still innocent, and I don't know if we
really want to no longer think of young women as innocent."</TE>
<TE>   "There's an old tradition of older women being sexual initiators
of young men," Wartenburg says. But "I think [there is] a real
reservation about having a film where the young woman is given sexual
experience, and that's a good thing, and now she can be a sexual
initiator with her same-age partner."</TE>
<TE>   Statutory Rape</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of women say that, I think, as teenagers they're really not
into sex the way guys are," Haskell says. "If a man seduces younger
women [it's] corrupting them, whereas 'corrupting'--you wouldn't use
that word of a woman and young men.... A 15-year-old male is already
sexual."</TE>
<TE>   But, according to the law, the situations shown in "Tadpole" and
"Lovely &amp; Amazing" are statutory rape. Stanford says of "Tadpole," "I
don't think this film is really advocating that in any way."</TE>
<TE>   Says Neuwirth, "Personally, I don't condone 40-year-old women
having sex with 15-year-old boys or any boys under 18." But, she
adds, the characters in "Tadpole" fall into bed together because they
had too much to drink and were emotionally vulnerable. "And then my
character is someone who, because of the way she is, she doesn't
think it's that big a deal.... She doesn't take advantage of him."</TE>
<TE>   Winick based Neuwirth's character, Diane, an uninhibited Upper
West Side wife bored with her husband, on women he knew while growing
up in Manhattan, attending private school. At one point, Diane says
to a friend, "If you hadn't met someone in a long time who was
excited about life, you'd consider a 15-year-old."</TE>
<TE>   Winick says that in coming up with the idea for "Tadpole," he
wanted to entertain more than to address any societal taboo, after
having directed more socially conscious films like "The Tic Code" and
"Sweet Nothing."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a dark person, and no matter how light I try to make my
films, there are underlying dark themes," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Says Wartenburg, "Having these sorts of high-profile cases [in the
news] of teachers who are older women having relationships with their
students who are younger men, I think that makes this whole issue one
that people are thinking about, [that is] in the public
consciousness."</TE>
<TE>   "It's such a hot-button issue to look at it with the degree of
complexity that it deserves," Haskell adds.</TE>
<TE>   In Holofcener's "Lovely &amp; Amazing," the law--and the young man's
mother--catch up with Keener's character.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people of all ages can love each other and connect with
one another," Holofcener says. "I say that now, but if my son was in
the situation, I'd be that mother at the car door saying, 'Get back
in your room.' "</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When Eddie Palmieri and Yerba Buena appear at the Hollywood Bowl on
Sunday, Los Angeles fans will get a cross-generational glimpse of
Latin music from New York. They'll have the old guard and the
vanguard on the same stage.</LD>
<LD>   In his day, Palmieri was the rebellious and unruly innovator, with
his raucous trombones and eerie, meandering piano. Today, it seems
strange to label the bearded genius as an old-school figure.</LD>
<LD>   But with the passing of Tito Puente, Palmieri now sits as the de
facto dean of salsa survivors from the boom of the '60s and '70s.</LD>
<TE>   Now it's Yerba Buena's turn to upset the Big Apple cart. This
upstart multiethnic "collective," as members call themselves, doesn't
even have a recording contract, but it's drawing critical acclaim for
its unusual mix of styles and its hard-driving performances. The band
has done only a couple of dozen concerts in its short life, but some
of those were opening for Celia Cruz and Dave Matthews.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the reason Yerba Buena is getting so much early attention
is the reputation of its key members: producer Andres Levin and
singer Xiomara Laugart. Those may not be household names in pop music
circles, but they ring big bells for fans of rock en espanol and
genuine Afro-Cuban music.</TE>
<TE>   Yerba Buena is really Levin's dream project.</TE>
<TE>   He's 32 and calls himself "an exile baby." His grandparents fled
Germany during World War II, and his parents escaped Argentina's
military regime in the 1960s. Levin wound up being born in Caracas,
Venezuela. He came to Boston to study at the Berklee College of Music
and settled in New York in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   He was just 21 when he produced "Contribution," the critically
praised album by British singer Mica Paris.</TE>
<TE>   "It broke a lot of R&amp;B rules," says Levin of the 1991 release,
"but kind of by accident because it was my first one."</TE>
<TE>   Since then his musical credits have been as diverse as his roots.</TE>
<TE>   Levin has written and/or produced for soul stars such as Chaka
Khan and Tina Turner as well as for Brazil's Caetano Veloso and
world-music maven David Byrne. Though he doesn't have the high
profile of his West Coast counterpart, Gustavo Santaolalla, Levin has
also worked with the top names in the Latin alternative field. In a
14-month period in the late '90s, he produced key albums by
Colombia's Aterciopelados, Mexico's El Gran Silencio and Los Amigos
Invisibles from his native Venezuela.</TE>
<TE>   And if that were not enough of a mix, he's working on Ricky
Martin's next album.</TE>
<TE>   Levin obviously is not interested in finding a musical niche. He
says he's more interested in "the way all these music [styles]
collide."</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, he called that collision Yerba Buena, an evocative
Spanish name for mint leaf, which literally means "good weed."</TE>
<TE>   Levin sees "a common denominator" in clashing styles, such as
cumbia and hip-hop, rumba and boogaloo. The band blends all these
musical palettes over an Afro-Cuban foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Says Levin, "Basically, it's just breaking down the rules of each
style of music in a responsible way. It's a great model for
experimentation, and it's a lot of fun."</TE>
<TE>   The band centers on Laugart, known to Cuban music aficionados as
one of the island's undiscovered vocal treasures.</TE>
<TE>   At first blush, Laugart appears an odd choice for such a funky
street band. In Cuba, she was known for her sophisticated style and
poetic lyrics, based in the New Song tradition.</TE>
<TE>   But her career on the socialist island stalled, as she recalls,
after Cuban undercover police aborted one of her concerts and took
her away in handcuffs.</TE>
<TE>   It happened during a 1994 performance at Havana's Teatro Nacional,
carried on radio and television. During the show, Laugart says, she
vowed that "until there was freedom and democracy, I would never sing
again."</TE>
<TE>   The singer was in custody for a week, she says, but was never
charged. For two years, however, she was "punished" by not being
allowed to record, perform or tour.</TE>
<TE>   In February 1996 Laugart gave a classy comeback concert,
unpolitical but unrepentant, at Havana's Teatro Mella. The show is
available on CD, released by Cuba's Bis Music label.</TE>
<TE>   Laugart, 29, says she was granted political asylum after deciding
to stay in New York four years ago, leaving her child and parents
back home in Cuba. She now sees a positive side to the upheavals in
her career.</TE>
<TE>   Like Palmieri four decades earlier, Yerba Buena is stepping into a
void in Latin music.</TE>
<TE>   Palmieri's scrappy street band, La Perfecta, came along at the end
of the big-band era, typified by the troika of Puente, Machito and
Tito Rodriguez during the '50s at the Palladium ballroom. His
aggressive style helped ignite the salsa explosion of the 1970s,
which launched the Fania All Stars.</TE>
<TE>   Today in New York, salsa is in one of its periodic slumps. The
resurgence of the '90s, marked by the rise of new stars such as Marc
Anthony and La India, has faded. With the famed Fania label in limbo
and Ralph Mercado's RMM label in bankruptcy, there is no major
promoter of Latin music.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, anything could happen. And that's the whole idea
behind Yerba Buena.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm kind of making a statement," says Levin, "that new music
needs a format to come out. The record companies are so blind to new
styles that if they can't categorize it, they can't conceive how to
sell it."</TE>

<LD>   Dirty Dancing: "In Louisville, Ky., a federal judge has struck
down a law that prevented nude dancers from getting closer than three
feet. He said they can get as close as they want. Let's face it: As
far as guys are concerned, once the woman is naked, the dancing is
really a nonissue. Have you ever been to the parking lot of a strip
club and hear guys coming out saying, 'Oh, I liked the lighting and
the music but the choreography was ... just terrible.' " (Jay Leno)</LD>

<LD>"Windtalkers" was a bomb. "Windtalkers" was a bad movie. These two
facts are not disputed. However, why this movie performed poorly at
the box office has very little to do with the studio's decision to
focus on "white soldiers" ("Ignoring True Story Doomed 'Windtalkers,'
" by Elizabeth Valenzuela, July 1).</LD>
<LD>   First and foremost, Valenzuela's assertion that the "American
audience, diverse in its thinking and taste, will no longer accept
such 'Hollywood myths' " is laughable. Are we talking about the same
America? Because in this country, people line up outside of bad
coffee chains for the privilege of paying $4 to drink even worse
coffee. In this country, "Titanic" is the No. 1 grossing movie of all
time, "Star Wars" is the second and some people paid hard-earned
money to see "Saving Private Ryan" twice.</LD>
<LD>   Believe me, we don't care if a movie is historically accurate. All
we care about is movie stars ... and the real reason "Windtalkers"
failed was because Tom Hanks, Russell Crowe and Mel Gibson weren't in
it.</LD>

<TE>   Yes, "Windtalkers" is about Indians seen through the eyes of a
non-Indian. In that context, it is much like "Dances With Wolves"
(1990). Yet I don't believe this film would have been made without a
big-name actor like Nicolas Cage attached to it. Who is going to see
a movie about the Navajo code talkers with just unknown Indian
actors?</TE>
<TE>   My grandfather served in WWII as a scout for the U.S. Army. He was
stationed in the Philippines throughout the war. It took the
government 20 years after his death to award him his medals. Last
year, the living code talkers were honored by President Bush in a
wonderful medal ceremony. It's 50 years late, and so is this movie.
Yet I'm glad Hollywood at least tried their best to honor these true
Indian warriors. So take "Windtalkers" for what it tried to be. I
enjoyed it.</TE>

<HD>Berry's Oscar Honors the Actress, Not the Character She
Played</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Angela Bassett doesn't need to feel she missed her chance at an Oscar
when she turned down Halle Berry's role in "Monster's Ball" ("Dust-Up
Over an Oscar Role," by Greg Braxton and Anne Valdespino, July 1).
Her obvious reverse racism and misplaced feminism would have made it
impossible for her to portray the heroic character that Halle
revealed herself and the character Leticia to be.</LD>
<LD>   JOHN A. SAYLOR</LD>
<LD>   Long Beach</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Angela Bassett states: "I would love to have an Oscar. But it has
to be for something I can sleep with at night."</TE>
<TE>   The academy doesn't get it right every time, but if actors waited
for roles that fit Bassett's criteria, we'd have far fewer of the
most memorable Academy Award-winning performances of recent years
from black or white performers: Denzel Washington playing a corrupt,
murderous cop in "Training Day," Nicolas Cage as a self-destructive
drunk in "Leaving Las Vegas," Anthony Hopkins as a gleeful serial
killer in "Silence of the Lambs," Kathy Bates as a homicidal fanatic
in "Misery," Jeremy Irons as a conniving murderer in "Reversal of
Fortune," Jane Fonda as a prostitute in "Klute," Robert De Niro
playing an unredeemable lout in "Raging Bull."</TE>
<TE>   These actors have every right to be proud of their Academy
Award-winning performances, but none of them put characters out there
"to be proud of in 10 years." And none of the above could use their
characters' actions to induce peaceful sleep at night.</TE>
<TE>   For Bassett to criticize Halle Berry's choice of roles based on
some elusive higher standard because she is a black actress smacks of
sour grapes, a lack of awareness or maybe nothing more than
prejudice.</TE>
<TE>   NICK PACCIONE</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Halle Berry was awarded best actress, but it seems as if everybody
is renaming her award best African American actress, and this is
wrong.</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of this debate, the people who suffer the most are
black actors. It's 2002! Black actors should not have to carry the
burden of the African American struggle every time they audition for
a role. Berry should be applauded for her decision to take the role
regardless of the sexual, racial or political implications.</TE>
<TE>   DOUG CAMPBELL</TE>
<TE>   West Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Would the critics of Halle Berry's role of Leticia in "Monster's
Ball" have been happier had the character committed suicide rather
than release her emotions sexually? Did these critics notice that
Leticia had lost her husband and her job? That she was being evicted
from her home and that her wreck of a car stopped running, ultimately
resulting in the death of her only child?</TE>
<TE>   Have the critics seen the movie? Are they viewing it as
pornography rather than the desperate act of a woman looking for
something that would make her feel good again? Did these same critics
miss the divine connections (her husband and both their sons) taking
place to bring these two lost souls together?</TE>
<TE>   DORISSE JONES</TE>
<TE>   Chino Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Once again, a major media outlet misses the boat--and the
point--on the continuing Halle Berry story involving her Academy
Award win for "Monster's Ball." This piece purports to document the
alleged "reignited ... fierce debate inside and outside the African
American entertainment community about Berry and the bittersweet
significance of her victory."</TE>
<TE>   But Berry is half-white, is she not? Her Caucasian mother was in
attendance at the Oscar ceremony, was she not? Didn't see her black
father anywhere, however. Hmmm.</TE>
<TE>   So she is as much white as she is black ... er, I mean, African
American (Forgot my Political Correctness Handbook of Nonsense there
for a moment. Sorry.), yet you and other print and TV media
continually refer to her as either "black" or "African American."</TE>
<TE>   I realize blacks in America are hungry to have their own race
appropriately acknowledged for works of excellence in the
high-profile world of celebrity worship in this country. But to
lavish this kind of praise and adoration on Berry--who, make no
mistake, is a fine actress and a gorgeous dame--as an "African
American" actress is not only inaccurate but also inappropriate and
dead wrong.</TE>

<HD>Ovitz as a 'Victim'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What is Mike Ovitz's definition of the word "downfall"? After working
the No. 2 job at Disney for 18 months, he left with a severance
package valued at $129 million. That's a downfall?</LD>
<LD>   And if he insists on blaming his troubles on the "gay mafia"
("Ovitz: I'm 'a Victim,' " by Dana Calvo, July 2), I hope he gets
some satisfaction in knowing that he helped put this gay writer out
of work. Because of the huge sum of money Disney paid Ovitz, in order
to balance the books and show a profit, 4,000 Disney employees lost
their jobs.</LD>
<LD>   When I was told I was being downsized, I asked if I could get the
Ovitz package. Then I realized I didn't qualify for it because I
actually worked for the 8 1/2 years I was there.</LD>
<TE>   Though I've been sending out resumes like mad, I have been
unemployed for a solid year, collecting my $230-a-week unemployment
check and paying $420.40 a month for health insurance. Now, that's a
downfall.</TE>
<TE>   KEN GILDIN</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Throughout college and law school, I regarded Michael Ovitz's
successful Hollywood career as a role model for my own future. I used
to track and admire all the newspaper, magazine and trade articles
that discussed his acute business mind and his fierce protection of
privacy.</TE>
<TE>   But after reading the article about his claim of being a victim of
the "gay mafia," I am disheartened. Regardless of what role David
Geffen and other gay execs may have played in Ovitz's career
nosedive, his ignorant comments are ridiculous.</TE>

made theater an important part of our lives lo these many years, and
it is always a pleasure to meet and talk with him at productions. He
always has a kind word for everyone and is truly a walking dictionary
of theater.</LD>

<LD>It's ironic to hear record companies express outrage that fans aren't
paying for music ("Technology Is Movies' Angel, but Record Industry's
Devil," by Patrick Goldstein, July 2).</LD>
<LD>   Aren't these the very same companies that, for more than 10 years,
have promoted rap music's singing the praises of every kind of crime
there is, including cop killing, drug dealing, misogyny and murder?
But they are shocked--shocked!--that anyone would fail to pay them
for music.</LD>
<LD>   For years the record companies have said, "This is what the fans
want, so we're promoting it." But by preaching to fans that it isn't
worth paying for, the music of crime and alienation is promoting
itself out of existence.</LD>
<TE>   Real courage is in telling people that life is worth living. It's
time for the record companies to promote some bands that have the
guts to try that.</TE>

<LD>   'MIB II' Sizzles at Weekend Box Office</LD>
<LD>   As expected, "Men in Black II" is dominating the Fourth of July
holiday weekend.</LD>
<TE>   Unofficial estimates peg the first two days of release in 3,557
theaters at about $36 million, far ahead of its two nearest rivals,
Adam Sandler's "Mr. Deeds" (about $7.6 million for Wednesday and
Thursday) and the kids' comedy "Like Mike" (with approximately $7.1
million in its first two days).</TE>
<TE>   Predictions for the five-day "MIB II" totals are somewhere in the
range of $85 million to $95 million, higher than the 1997 original,
which grossed $84.1 million over a similar five-day span, though
ticket prices were lower then.</TE>
<TE>   TELEVISION</TE>
<TE>   Contestants Set for Latest 'Big Brother'</TE>
<TE>   The third edition of CBS' "Big Brother" kicks off Wednesday, with
12 people sequestered in a house and the eventual survivor claiming a
$500,000 prize. CBS revealed the contestants Friday. They include six
people in their 20s, five in their 30s and a 51-year-old teacher from
Shadow Hills, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   The program, which will play three times a week through the
summer--Wednesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays--has fared reasonably
well for CBS ratings-wise, especially among younger viewers, but also
has generated more than its share of controversy.</TE>
<TE>   That includes last summer's version, in which a contestant was
evicted after holding a knife to another's throat. Reports surfaced
this week, in fact, that the woman involved in that incident, Krista
Stegall, has sued CBS, contending that her fellow contestant, Justin
Sebik, should never have been "cast" on the show because of his
history of assault charges--a detail CBS apparently missed in its
background checks.</TE>

<TE>   Albert Hall Fire Halts Tony Bennett Concert</TE>
<TE>   In the same week that a soprano's train caught fire during a
production of "The Queen of Spades" at Covent Garden, a fire broke
out Thursday at nearby Royal Albert Hall, forcing Tony Bennett to
stop his concert and the sellout crowd to evacuate the building. No
injuries were reported.</TE>
<TE>   The 75-year-old singer was halfway through his signature tune, "I
Left My Heart in San Francisco," when smoke began to fill the
auditorium. As the evacuation began, Bennett tried to calm the crowd,
joking, "I knew I was hot, but not that hot."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the hall later said the smoke had come from a
burned-out motor.</TE>
<TE>   Hendrix Family Wins Injunction Against PPX</TE>
<TE>   The family of guitarist Jimi Hendrix won an injunction at the
London High Court on Friday barring a New York-based music production
company from releasing recordings on which the star performed.</TE>
<TE>   Experience Hendrix, the family firm that controls the rights to
all of Hendrix's work except some early recordings, sued PPX
Enterprises over recordings that the then little-known guitar
virtuoso made with a group called Curtis Knight and the Squires in
PPX's New York studios. Experience Hendrix said PPX failed to pay
royalties on the works and had authorized the release of records
without licenses. Justice Roger Buckley granted an injunction
restraining the future release or licensing of PPX recordings on
which Hendrix performed, apart from 33 master tapes that Experience
Hendrix agreed PPX was entitled to. Buckley ruled that PPX must
account for royalties due on those 33 tapes in the future, but not in
the past.</TE>
<TE>   Weezer and Muppets Collaborate on Video</TE>
<TE>   Proving themselves unafraid to share the stage with a ham, the
L.A. band Weezer recently wrapped production on a music video, "Keep
Fishin' " with Miss Piggy and other Muppets.</TE>
<TE>   The video features the band members as guests on the former
television series "The Muppet Show," with guest appearances by Miss
Piggy, Kermit the Frog, Gonzo and others.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Kermit said, "Weezer fit right in. They're rock
stars; they're used to being around animals, bears and egotistical
pigs."</TE>
<TE>   The video is set for release July 14 on MTV and MTV2.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Charlayne Woodard's one-woman show, ''In Real Life,'' which
appeared at the Mark Taper Forum last year, will be staged by
Manhattan Theatre Club this fall, opening there Oct. 8.... Bruce
Willis will appear on Showtime Aug. 12 in a production of Sam
Shepard's "True West," taped at the Liberty Theatre in Hailey,
Idaho.... David Bowie said Friday he would never again live in his
native Britain. "The pure inconvenience of having a camera lens stuck
in either my face or my wife and child's face every morning, I think
would certainly be a deterrent to me wanting to come back to live
here on a permanent basis," he told the BBC. Bowie has lived in the
United States for the past decade.... Singer Marc Anthony and his
wife, former Miss Universe Dayanara Torres, have separated. Anthony,
33, and Torres, 26, were married in 2000 and have a 16-month-old son.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Songwriter Joni Mitchell's whimsical spin on the changes often
wrought in the name of progress is the theme of a disquieting glimpse
at the erosion of this country's heritage in tonight's History
Channel special, "Save Our History: America's Most Endangered 2002"
(10 p.m.).</TE>
<TE>   From the threat to sacred Indian sites in California's Imperial
Valley to a crumbling Washington, D.C., hospital that 150 years ago
set new standards for architecture as well as care for the mentally
ill, the hourlong special reports on a list of 11 subject areas that
are facing extinction.</TE>
<TE>   The National Trust for Historic Preservation, a private, nonprofit
membership organization based in Washington, D.C., has been coming up
with the annual lists since 1988. And since the History Channel came
on the air seven years later, it has dutifully reported on the yearly
findings.</TE>
<TE>   But if the idea is to summon the kind of passion in viewers that
spurred Mitchell to write her song, the effort falls a little short.
TV specials based on lists are usually only as strong as their
weakest links, and there are several items tonight whose interest
seems to be regional, at best.</TE>
<TE>   One such segment involves the Chesapeake Bay skipjack fleet in
Maryland. The picturesque wooden sailing ships have worked the bay's
waters for more than a century in search of oysters, but due largely
to overfishing, only a handful of the original 100 ships are still
used commercially.</TE>
<TE>   Now, it's a jolt when any industry undergoes change, and the ships
look quite majestic under sail, but should this really be uppermost
among our national concerns?</TE>
<TE>   Another part of the problem may be in trying to cover 11 areas in
a one-hour special, minus commercials. It's difficult for any issue
to capture your interest when the program is jumping to the next
subject every few minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The special is on firmer ground with its segment on the onetime
5,300-strong string of Rosenwald Schools, built by philanthropist
Julius Rosenwald between 1913 and 1932 to help educate underserved
African Americans youths. But questions about the mission of the
schools, and the onset of integration mandates, led to the
abandonment of most of the schools, and the few that survived are in
terrible disrepair.</TE>
<TE>   The tremendous impact of U.S. Army Corps of Engineer projects near
Indian land in the Missouri River Valley areas of Montana, North
Dakota and South Dakota is another of the stronger pieces. Erosion
and lands flooded by government dam and reservoir projects have
wreaked havoc with hundreds of archeological and historic sites in
the region.</TE>
<TE>   Something that might strike closer to home for many across the
United States is the broadest topic of the night, the destruction of
historic neighborhoods to make way for new cookie-cutter
developments.</TE>
<TE>   "America's starting to look like Generica," says Richard Moe, the
national trust's president, pointing to the bulldozing of thousands
of Victorian houses to create room for a procession of massive,
sterile "McMansions." "Everything is starting to look the same."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Mitchell was right.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Save Our History: America's Most Endangered 2002" can be seen at
10 tonight on the History Channel.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An intermittently interesting peek inside New York's dating scene and
at a handful of the women who troll its sometimes treacherous waters
is the subject of a frothy eight-part documentary series debuting
Sunday at 8 p.m. on the Women's Entertainment (WE) Channel.</LD>
<LD>   "Single in the City" is a baldfaced bid to mine much of the same
territory as HBO's popular "Sex and the City" series, albeit from a
"reality" perspective. It's also from a basic-cable perspective,
which means keeping the explicitness meter out of the red zone.</LD>
<LD>   The hourlong program was taped on location in Manhattan last
summer, which accounts for the repeated glimpses of the World Trade
Center towers. Viewers get brisk introductions to 11 attractive (at
least physically) twentysomethings, who are all trying to balance
oft-conflicting needs for independence and companionship.</LD>
<TE>   And if we're to believe these ladies, the pickin's can be pretty
slim.</TE>
<TE>   "If that's all that's left, may God strike me lesbian tomorrow,"
says attorney-singer Lauren.</TE>
<TE>   With nearly a dozen women to get to know, the cutting between
story lines can be abrupt, which can be a blessing and a curse. If
you're stuck listening to one character's obnoxious blatherings, you
know it will be only a couple of minutes before the show moves on to
someone else. Yet if you're eager to see what happens after Allison
steps out on her boyfriend with a new man, only to see him at the
same nightspot with another woman, you'd prefer to linger awhile.</TE>
<TE>   But as the furious dating action rolls on, and particularly by
next week's episode, the rhythm of the program begins to settle in
nicely. And although to know all these women isn't necessarily to
love them, just sitting back and watching can be rather fun.</TE>

<HD>A Harsh Life Struggle for Romanian Youths, Neglected and
Worse</HD>
<DH>Television* 'Children Underground,' Tuesday on Cinemax,
documents Bucharest's abandoned kids.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN CLARK</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When "Children Underground" director Edet Belzberg bounded onto the
stage at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival to accept a Special Jury
Prize, it came as a bit of a shock. This woman made that movie?</LD>
<LD>   Belzberg is in her early 30s but looks younger, and more to the
point seems ... well, not grizzled enough to have directed an
in-your-face documentary about Romanian street kids who live in
Bucharest's subway system, panhandle, beat one another up, sniff
paint and engage in self-mutilation.</LD>
<LD>   "She seems so sweet and innocent and not like a hardened street
journalist," says Nancy Abraham, vice president of original
programming at HBO, whose sister channel Cinemax will show the
documentary Tuesday. "She's not jaded about anything."</LD>
<TE>   When apprised of the impression she makes, Belzberg looks blank,
then uneasy. It's like saying she's not to be taken seriously.
However, the movie she made is indeed serious. It was even nominated
last year for a best documentary Oscar.</TE>
<TE>   "Other people didn't think it [making the movie] was possible,"
she says, perhaps reflecting what people deceived by her looks
thought she was capable of. "I thought it was possible."</TE>
<TE>   "Children Underground" focuses on five children: Cristina, 16, a
refugee from an orphanage and an insane asylum who both bullies and
nurtures the younger children; Ana, 10, and Marian, her 8-year-old
brother; Macarena, 14, so named because she loves to do the Macarena
(she also loves to sniff Aurolac, an industrial paint used on
radiators); and 12-year-old Mihai, who is arguably the most
redeemable of the kids.</TE>
<TE>   It took Belzberg a while to find these children. In fact, it took
her a while to find a vocation. A graduate of the University of
Colorado who initially worked in politics in California, Belzberg
received a master's degree at Columbia University's School of
International and Public Affairs, where she was encouraged to pursue
her interest in journalism and documentary filmmaking. She became
intrigued by street children (some estimates say there are
approximately 150 million of them worldwide) after reading articles
about child prostitution in Africa, Southeast Asia, South America and
Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Her readings led her to Romania, where, during the Ceausescu
regime, both contraception and abortions were banned and social
spending plummeted, which overwhelmed families and pushed kids out
into the streets (Cristina and Macarena are graduates of this
system). A second wave of street children (including Ana, Marian and
Mihai) accompanied the country's messy transition to a market
economy.</TE>
<TE>   Belzberg raised a little money and spent two weeks in Bucharest
looking at the kids' plight, deciding that there was a story here yet
to be told. "People had just an idea of why the kids were on the
street, what their lives were like," she says. "I wanted to live with
a group of kids and make the film in their eyes and only using their
voices."</TE>
<TE>   Which meant going back to the U.S., drumming up more funding and
locating a good translator. With these elements in place, she then
beat the bushes looking for the right subjects, finally stumbling
across Ana at a day clinic. She was having a cast removed. Her leg
had been broken by a policeman's baton.</TE>
<TE>   "I immediately knew that she would be one of the children I would
follow," Belzberg says. "I asked her if I could come with her to
where she was staying--she was staying at Victoria Station--and she
said yes. And then I met Cristina, who was the leader of the group at
that time. I spent time with them and asked them if we could hang out
with them. And we did, and we slowly introduced a camera."</TE>
<TE>   For two months, Belzberg and her director of photography, Wolfgang
Held, haunted the subway stations and streets of Bucharest from
midmorning until 2 or 3 a.m. What they documented can, at times, be
hard to handle--particularly the kids' cruelty to one another and
their self-destructiveness.</TE>
<TE>   "When I watched it there were tears streaming down my face," HBO's
Abraham says. "It was incredibly hard to watch, but I kept watching
it. The kids were so distinct and the personalities were so strong
and I connected to them so strongly, it was worth the pain."</TE>
<TE>   Needless to say, it was painful for Belzberg too. After all, she
was actually there, which made her not just a passive or interested
observer but also an actual participant. Which raises a question: At
what point does the filmmaker put the camera aside and intercede?</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very difficult decision to say, 'OK, I'm going to stand
back and see this child be abused because I think it will be better
in the long run,' " Belzberg says. "What you do see is a fraction of
what the children go through. There are three scenes where children
are physically abused. One child could be physically abused three or
four times a day. And following each episode of abuse, a child will
usually self-mutilate."</TE>
<TE>   The viewer is spared tales of sexual abuse. Belzberg says this was
the one area where the children clammed up, so she decided to respect
their privacy and not pursue the matter. She does say that they
exchanged oral sex with one another for food and drugs, that at one
point Cristina pimped for the younger girls and that Ana occasionally
sold herself. She would disappear for hours and then return flush
with cash, which she couldn't have gotten from begging.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly she didn't get the money from her parents. In one
sequence, Belzberg accompanies Ana home to meet her unreceptive
stepfather and overwhelmed mother, who herself is one of nine
siblings--all raised in orphanages. Belzberg also conducts an
interview with Mihai's father, who reveals that he used to chain
Mihai to a radiator to keep him from running away, though he doesn't
consider this abuse.</TE>
<TE>   It would be nice to report that in the more than four years since
Belzberg shot this film that matters have improved. In fact, they
have changed, but not for the better. The children are beginning to
have children of their own (Cristina had a boy, which she gave up),
so that on a recent trip Belzberg found herself buying baby formula
rather than candy.</TE>
<TE>   She also says that heroin has replaced Aurolac, which raises the
specter of AIDS. All of the children featured are still on the
street, in and out of residences and jail, though she did receive a
picture of Ana at home holding her mother's newborn twins.</TE>
<TE>   Belzberg herself has moved on--sort of. She's involved with
raising money for these kids and promoting awareness of their plight.</TE>
<TE>   But she's also finishing a documentary on Olympic gymnasts, a
subject about as far removed from the street as you can get.</TE>
<TE>   "I needed to establish a little emotional balance in my life,"
Belzberg says.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Children Underground" premieres Tuesday at 6 p.m. on Cinemax. The
network has rated it TV-14 (may be unsuitable for children younger
than 14).</TE>

<HD>PacBell to Credit DSL Customers</HD>
<DH>Telecom: As part of tentative settlement with PUC, firm
agrees to compensate for future billing errors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE FREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SBC Pacific Bell will credit customers one month of high-speed
Internet service or $25 toward their telephone accounts for billing
errors as part of its tentative settlement with the state Public
Utilities Commission.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to paying a $27-million fine, the telephone company,
which admitted that it improperly billed as many as 70,000 customers
for digital-subscriber line, or DSL, service since January 2000,
agreed to improve billing practices and compensate customers for
future billing errors.</LD>
<LD>   Customers will receive two free months of DSL service or a $50
credit toward their telephone accounts if billing errors are not
corrected within 90 days. The credit will apply only to customers who
are incorrectly billed after the settlement agreement takes effect.</LD>
<TE>   SBC Pacific Bell, a unit of San Antonio-based SBC Communications
Corp., also agreed to provide better records of customer complaints,
submitting quarterly reports to the PUC's Consumer Services Division.
In April, Pacific Bell opened a DSL Internet billing center to answer
customer billing questions.</TE>
<TE>   Though satisfied with the tentative agreement, consumer groups
said the company's billing problems would not be solved soon.</TE>
<TE>   "Are the problems over? No, and the company pretty much
acknowledged that," said Michael Shames, executive director of the
Utility Consumers' Action Network, a San Diego consumer group that is
a party to the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Bell said in the 20-page settlement agreement filed late
Wednesday that it received complaints from customers who were charged
for services they did not receive or order, billed for services that
it promoted as free and charged for services that had been
terminated.</TE>
<TE>   The company attributes many of the errors to the "difficult
process" of transferring its DSL services to a separate unit, SBC
Advanced Solutions Inc. In addition, the third-party vendor that
handled DSL billing inquiries could not access customer service
records.</TE>
<TE>   The company declined to comment Friday.</TE>
<TE>   If the settlement agreement is approved by the commission, Pacific
Bell must pay the $27-million fine--one of the largest ever--to the
state general fund.</TE>
<TE>   "It'll definitely send the message to other telecommunication
carriers that they need to follow commission rules and regulations
and provide their customers with fair and upright service," PUC
spokeswoman Sheri Inouye said.</TE>
<TE>   But others, such as Mike Jackman, executive director of the
California ISP Assn., say they doubt that the settlement will have
much of an effect.</TE>
<TE>   The association has complained to state regulators that Pacific
Bell is trying to control the state's DSL market.</TE>

<HD>Jobless Rate Hits 5.9%; Payroll Growth Weak</HD>
<DH>Economy: The June figures highlight the slow pace of
recovery. Officials also revise previous months' gains. A few bright
spots exist.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The nation's unemployment rate rose to 5.9% in June and employers
hired fewer than half the workers they had been expected to, the
Labor Department said Friday. The figures show the economy recovering
at a maddeningly slow pace.</LD>
<LD>   Department officials said U.S. companies added 36,000 workers last
month, compared with the 75,000 that had been predicted. And
officials revised previous months' job gains dating to February, when
the labor market was originally thought to have begun a comeback. The
department initially said employers added 66,000 workers that month;
it now said they trimmed 165,000.</LD>
<LD>   "These are not very promising figures," said Richard Yamarone,
chief economist with New York-based Argus Research Corp. "Employment
growth is the single most important statistic for this recovery
because new jobs translate into more income and more spending.</LD>
<TE>   "But these numbers make you think there isn't going to be much of
either," he said.</TE>
<TE>   There were a few bright spots in the new report. The length of the
average workweek rose slightly, which usually is a prelude to new
hiring. Wages also rose, with the average hourly earnings for
production and nonsupervisory workers, who account for about 80% of
the nation's labor force, jumping 6 cents in June to $14.76.</TE>
<TE>   For a few analysts, that was enough. "The worst of the massive
layoffs are behind us," said Stan Shipley, a senior economist with
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in New York. "You're going to see payroll job
growth coming back strongly" in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. stocks staged a powerful rally Friday, with the Dow Jones
industrial average posting its biggest gain in nine months. The Dow
jumped 324.53 points, or 3.6%, to close at 9379.5, and other major
market measures rose even more steeply.</TE>
<TE>   But most analysts said the new jobs report played no role in the
run-up, and warned that, with firms such as WorldCom Inc. and
Electronic Data Systems Inc. announcing big job cuts this week and
most industries reporting little or no payroll expansion, prospects
for a quick and strong recovery appear to be dimming.</TE>
<TE>   "All these things argue for the coming decade being sub-1990s,"
said Peter E. Kretzmer, a senior economist with Bank of America Corp.
in New York.</TE>
<TE>   June's 5.9% jobless rate was only fractionally above the previous
month's 5.8% rate but was substantially above June 2001's 4.6% rate.</TE>
<TE>   About 8.4 million Americans were unemployed during the month,
almost 1 million more than a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   The unemployment rate among Latinos rose to 7.4% last month from
7% in May. The rate among African Americans climbed half a point to
10.7%, the department said.</TE>
<TE>   The number of people unemployed for six months or more hit an
eight-year high of 1.67 million in June. The average length of an
out-of-work stint hit a six-year high of 17.3 weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Regular unemployment compensation runs out at the end of six
months. After that, jobless workers must rely on various extension
programs that critics say operate in drastically different ways in
various states.</TE>
<TE>   "Six hundred thousand workers will run out of benefits in the next
few months because of major gaps in the federal extension program,"
said Maurice Emsellem, an official with the National Employment Law
Project, an activist group that helps low-income workers obtain
coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Emsellem said that of 14 states with unemployment rates above 6%,
only two--Washington and Oregon--would qualify for additional
benefits under a federally funded extension program.</TE>
<TE>   He said the rest would have to wind down their extension programs.
Among them are California and Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   Although up from May, the nation's nonfarm payrolls changed little
in recent months, totaling 130.7 million in June.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, they were falling by an average of 160,000 workers a
month from the March 2001 start of the current recession through
February.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the worst losses have occurred in manufacturing, which
shed 23,000 jobs last month and almost 1.1 million over the last
year. The cutbacks have not fallen exclusively on blue-collar or
low-skill workers.</TE>
<TE>   The latest figures show there were almost 150,000 more jobless
college graduates than jobless high school dropouts last month.</TE>
<TE>   Employers' failure to create more jobs in June was widely viewed
as evidence of the economy's continued weakness.</TE>
<TE>   Although the gross domestic product, the principal measure of the
nation's output of goods and services, grew at an unexpectedly strong
6.1% annual clip in the first three months of the year, its growth
has slowed to perhaps 2% or less.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the combination of weak growth and a stock market
that has fallen sharply, Friday's rally notwithstanding, makes it
unlikely that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates soon.</TE>
<TE>   Central bank policymakers decided last week to keep their
signal-sending federal funds rate at a four-decade low of 1.75%,
saying the economy has lost momentum.</TE>
<TE>   Although the policymakers said they expected consumer and business
spending to "pick up over the coming quarters," they warned that "the
degree of the strengthening remains uncertain."</TE>

<HD>Size Matters in Fast, Fatty Fare</HD>
<DH>Food: Nutritionists say larger restaurant portions have
helped consumers add on the pounds. The industry says it's not to
blame.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The fast-food industry's highly profitable practice of serving bigger
portions has become a lightning rod for criticism by nutritionists
and health advocacy groups that blame "portion distortion" for the
bloating of America, a trend with unhealthful consequences.</LD>
<LD>   Among other things, these critics are calling for legislation
requiring restaurants to disclose calorie levels on menus, and they
are particularly critical of chains' growing practice of
"super-sizing" meals. They cite research showing that consumers who
are served more tend to eat more.</LD>
<LD>   The industry, however, says bigger portions should not be blamed
for Americans' growing girth. They say consumers are not being forced
to overeat.</LD>
<TE>   With competition among eateries more cutthroat than ever and food
costs relatively low, the typical restaurant dinner plate has grown
25%, to 12 1/2 inches, since the mid-1990s, said Lisa Young, a
nutritionist and adjunct professor at New York University. At the
same time, busy Americans are eating out more.</TE>
<TE>   As portion sizes have expanded and restaurant visits increased,
Americans have gotten larger. Sixty-one percent of U.S. adults are
now classified as overweight or obese, up from 56% in 1994. Excess
fat contributes to heart disease, cancer and diabetes, and an
estimated 300,000 deaths per year, health experts say. In 2000,
direct and indirect costs related to fatness amounted to $117
billion, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services.</TE>
<TE>   "Super-sizing is contributing to the current epidemic of obesity
in this country," said Barbara Rolls, a professor of nutrition at
Pennsylvania State University. "The more you give people, the more
they'll eat."</TE>
<TE>   To help curb consumers' appetite for tasty-but-gut-busting fast
food, the Center for Science in the Public Interest in recent months
has begun pressuring federal and state lawmakers to pass legislation
that would require chains to publish the calorie contents of burgers,
burritos and other menu items. Such disclosures might give pause to
many diners thinking of gorging themselves, said Jayne G. Hurley,
senior nutritionist at the Washington-based group.</TE>
<TE>   "If you walk into a supermarket, you can pick up any package and
find out how many calories and how much fat it has. But you can't do
that at a restaurant," she said. "People have no idea what they're
getting, and would make better-informed decisions if they did."</TE>
<TE>   The National Alliance for Nutrition and Activity, a group of 225
national, state and local health organizations, presented a study in
mid-June that criticized the fast-food industry's practice of coaxing
consumers to "super-size" their meals for a bit more money.</TE>
<TE>   The American Institute for Cancer Research, a major charity that
focuses on the link between diet and cancer, urges people to ask for
half or smaller portions, even if it's not cost effective. Also, it
recommends, desserts should be shared.</TE>
<TE>   From a caloric standpoint, consumers who eat at fast-food
restaurants often are getting a lot. A McDonald's Corp. super-size
Extra Value Meal of a Quarter Pounder with cheese, 42-ounce Coke and
large fries has 1,550 calories, according to the institute. That's
nearly all of the Agriculture Department's recommended daily
allotment of 1,600 calories for a sedentary woman and more than 70%
of the 2,200-calorie quota for a man who exercises little.</TE>
<TE>   No fast-food restaurants currently put nutrition information on
menu boards, but almost all of them, including McDonald's, post the
data on their Web sites. Burger King and Carl's Jr., among others,
display it in restaurants. Others distribute pamphlets upon request.</TE>
<TE>   The National Council of Chain Restaurants vigorously opposes any
new regulations, said Terrie Dort, president of the Washington-based
trade association. "We don't feel we need the government telling us
what to do," she said. "Consumers who want information can already
get it."</TE>
<TE>   The Center for Science's Hurley said that's not good enough,
arguing that consumers can't go online while waiting in line for
their burgers and fries. Also, many don't even know they can obtain
such information from restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Another reason for the restaurant industry's opposition is that
making caloric data easily accessible could hurt sales, said Larry
Sarokin of Sarokin &amp; Sarokin, a Beverly Hills-based restaurant
consulting firm. "If people knew how fattening the food was, they
might eat fewer Whoppers and Big Macs," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Legislation regulating fast-food menus has yet to be
introduced and probably would face intense opposition from the
restaurant industry and its allies, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's, Burger King and other outlets push the bigger sizes
because soft drinks and fries have high profit margins that boost the
bottom line, said Carlsbad restaurant consultant Hal Sieling. But
they also add hundreds of calories to meals already low in nutrients
and high in fat and sugar.</TE>
<TE>   At $1.90, a super-size order of fries at McDonald's costs only 87
cents more than a small order but adds 400 calories. But a typical
super-size serving of fries costs the restaurant only an estimated 15
cents more in ingredients than a small bag, Sieling said.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's spokesman Walt Riker said restaurants are not to blame
for the country's collective bulge. McDonald's offers consumers a
wide array of options, including orange juice, salads and yogurt
parfaits, he said. The chain also allows them to customize sandwiches
so they can leave off mayonnaise, cheese and other high-fat,
high-calorie items if they so desire.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Grover, vice president of regulatory affairs at the
National Restaurant Assn. in Washington, said Americans are gaining
weight not because restaurant meals have gotten bigger but because
they are watching more television, playing more video games, doing
less physical labor and have little understanding about nutrition.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too easy to blame the food," he said. "People who have a
weight problem are making bad decisions. Overeating is a choice."</TE>
<TE>   But studies have shown that people will eat more than they
normally would when served lots of food. Even diners disciplined
enough to take home half their servings might be eating too much.
Restaurant meals are often so calorie-laden and big that diners might
want to consider eating only one-third of the meal to avoid
overeating, said Larry Lindner, executive editor of the Tufts
University Health &amp; Nutrition Letter in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   In the battle for stomach share, several casual-dining
restaurants, like their fast-food cousins, offer customers the choice
of stuffing themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine-based Claim Jumper has distinguished itself with
its mammoth offerings. The 29-store chain, with outlets in five states,
is famous for its Six Layer Chocolate Motherlode Cake, which, at
$7.95 a slice, can feed an entire family, said Jennifer Weerheim,
vice president of marketing.</TE>
<TE>   A big reason some restaurants are so busy is that time-starved
Americans no longer have time to cook, said Christopher Muller, a
professor of restaurant management at the University of Central
Florida in Orlando.</TE>
<TE>   With that trend unlikely to change soon, the popularity
of eateries should continue to grow, along with Americans' girth,
experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Just ask Catherine Cleeremans. The 52-year-old account executive
at Buzzsaw, an Irvine design firm, said she now puts in so many hours
at work that she eats 14 restaurant meals a week, up from 10 two
years ago. In that time, she has added 15 pounds to her 5-foot-5-inch
frame.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no control over the ingredients [restaurants] put in the
food or the portion sizes, which are always big," she said. "But I
just can't resist."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Stocks Rally on Calm Holiday</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: The Dow is up more than 300 points, its
biggest percentage gain in nine months.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors splurged Friday on beaten-down industrial and technology
stocks, giving the Dow Jones industrial average its biggest
percentage gain since Sept. 24 and providing needed relief from the
market's recent swoon.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said one reason for the rally was that investors appeared
to accept early reports that Thursday's deadly shooting at Los
Angeles International Airport hadn't been linked to a wider terrorist
attack. Warnings that terrorists might strike over the Fourth of July
had cast a pall over the market for several days.</LD>
<LD>   "We pretty much got through the Fourth" without major terrorist
attacks, "and that's part of it," said A.C. Moore, chief investment
strategist for Dunvegan Associates Inc. in Santa Barbara.</LD>
<TE>   "But the market generally is ready for a lift," said Moore, who
believes negative "herd instinct" selling has depressed many stocks
to the point where they represent good values.</TE>
<TE>   The major stock indexes, which had rallied in late trading
Wednesday, are recovering from a downdraft that had pushed the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 briefly below its post-Sept. 11 low point,
sending the tech-laden Nasdaq composite to a five-year low.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts cautioned against reading too much into Friday's bullish
trading, noting that it came during a holiday-shortened session
during which many investors were on the sideline.</TE>
<TE>   "It can easily be wiped out Monday, because you had this light
trading day," said Rich Weiss, chief investment officer at City
National Investments in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average surged 324.53 points, or 3.6%, to
9,379.50, as 28 of its 30 members rose. Microsoft, which added $2.41
to 54.88, paced the Dow.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite index gained 68.21 points, or 4.94%, to
1,448.38, while the broader S&amp;P 500 index closed up 35.04 points, or
3.67%, at 989.03. It was the biggest one-day advance for the Nasdaq
and S&amp;P 500 since May 8.</TE>
<TE>   More than four stocks rose for every one that fell on the New York
Stock Exchange, and advancers outnumbered decliners by nearly 3 to 1
on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   The rally helped the Dow to a 1.5% gain for the shortened trading
week, breaking a six-week losing streak. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq
couldn't completely overcome Monday and Tuesday's big losses,
however, losing 0.1% and 1% for week, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street was heartened by two days of solid gains in European
markets, which helped buyers shrug off a report showing June's
unemployment rate rose and payroll growth was weaker than expected.</TE>
<TE>   Despite that job report, most economic indicators have been
pointing to recovery, Weiss said.</TE>
<TE>   The negative market psychology of late has been "a mirror image of
the market we saw in 1998 and 1999," when optimism about technology
and the markets reached its peak, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Investors may be realizing that earnings will be coming around
now, particularly in the manufacturing sector," Weiss said, adding
that "electronics and even computer hardware are looking reasonable
... though they're not yet screaming buys."</TE>
<TE>   Goldman Sachs helped stoke the buying by upgrading Asian tech
stocks, noting demand for personal computers is rising again
worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   And semiconductor shares got a boost after a Fortis Bank analyst
said the chip-equipment industry has improved in the last six months
and is poised for a recovery.</TE>
<TE>   The surge in stock prices pulled money away from bonds. The yield
on 10-year Treasury bonds jumped from 4.76% on Wednesday to 4.86% on
Friday--the highest yield since June 13. The dollar continued its
recent rally against the yen and euro. Commodity markets in New York
were closed.</TE>
<TE>   * All 17 members of the Philadelphia semiconductor index climbed
as the index had its biggest gain since May 8, adding more than 8%.
Micron Technology rose $1.81 to $22.31. LSI Logic gained 81 cents to
$8.41 and Advanced Micro Devices rose 91 cents to $9.34. Intel, the
world's biggest semiconductor maker, jumped $1.79 to $19.54.</TE>
<TE>   * Manufacturing stocks were strong, with the S&amp;P 500 industrials
index adding 4.4%. Among the leaders: General Electric, up $1.79 to
$29.69; United Technologies, up $4.27 to $69.10; Tyco International,
up 79 cents to $13.45.</TE>
<TE>   * Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea rose $1.65 to $18.05. The operator
of the A&amp;P and Waldbaum's chains said it revised its results higher
for the last three years after discovering accounting
"irregularities."</TE>
<TE>   * JDA Software Group tumbled $12 to $15. The maker of software for
retailers reported second-quarter earnings, excluding costs, that
were half as much as analysts' forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   In overseas trading, the main German share index spiked 5.3%; the
French index jumped 4.5%; shares in Great Britain rose 3.2%; and the
Nikkei index in Japan added 1.8%.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tracy Wood, former investigations editor at the Orange County
Register, is expected to be named editor in chief of Ms. magazine
Monday. Wood, who before joining the Register staff in 1997 worked as
an investigative reporter for the Los Angeles Times, will head the
30-year-old magazine as it debuts under new ownership from its West
Coast office.</LD>
<LD>   Ms. was purchased last year by the Feminist Majority Foundation
and moved from New York to the foundation's Beverly Hills building.</LD>
<LD>   "Ms. has always tried to do one investigative piece per issue,"
said magazine co-founder Gloria Steinem. "[Wood] increases that
expertise and ability. [She is] an excellent investigative reporter
who is accustomed to administering teams of reporters to do
long-term, in-depth reporting."</LD>
<TE>   Although the appointment is to be announced Monday, Wood has been
working on the magazine's relaunch issue for the last five weeks. It
will be on newsstands in October.</TE>
<TE>   "We were all impressed with her investigative background," said
Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority.</TE>
<TE>   "We want Ms. to break stories, to be on the front lines. She knows
how to roll out a story and keep it going in the magazine and on the
Web site. And," Smeal added, "she has a very good sense of humor."</TE>
<TE>   Wood said she plans to use journalists all over the world to do
investigative and breaking news stories for the magazine.</TE>
<TE>   "I see this as the women's news magazine," Wood said. "We have no
boundaries."</TE>
<TE>   Wood began her career working for United Press International in
1968. Beginning in 1972, she served as a combat correspondent in
Vietnam, news editor in Hong Kong and foreign correspondent
throughout Asia. During her 17 years at The Times, she broke stories
on money laundering, corruption in the Los Angeles Unified School
District and local hospitals, and covered the Rodney King beating and
the investigation that followed.</TE>
<TE>   Wood replaces former Editor in Chief Marcia Ann Gillespie.</TE>

<HD>FDA OKs Marketing of Intense Sweetener</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved for general
consumption a new artificial sweetener that it said was about 7,000
to 13,000 times sweeter than sugar and will carry no health warning
on its label.</LD>
<LD>   The sweetener, neotame, will become the most concentrated and
intensely sweet sugar substitute on the market. The FDA ruling means
that the sweetener can be used in such foods as baked goods,
nonalcoholic beverages such as soft drinks, chewing gum, confections,
frostings, frozen desserts, gelatins and puddings, jams and jellies,
processed fruits and fruit juices, toppings and syrups.</LD>
<LD>   However, the approval is expected to trigger renewed criticism
from those who say the sweetener is unsafe and should carry a warning
label.</LD>
<TE>   Neotame is a product of Chicago-based NutraSweet Co. and is
chemically similar to one of its earlier products, aspartame,
marketed under the brand name Equal in small, blue paper packets.
Aspartame drew similar criticisms as being unsafe.</TE>
<TE>   Aspartame, which has been on the market for 21 years, is about 180
to 220 times sweeter than sugar. More recently approved products such
as sucralose, marketed under the brand name Splenda, are as much as
three times sweeter than aspartame. But neotame sets a standard for
sweetening power.</TE>
<TE>   Alan M. Rulis, director of the FDA's office of food additive
safety, said the concentration of neotame is so high that only very
small amounts would be needed to achieve the effects of other
sweeteners. Thus, the agency said, a warning label would not be
needed because only small quantities would be consumed.</TE>
<TE>   Nick E. Rosa, president and chief executive of NutraSweet, said in
an interview Friday that the product would be great because of its
"sweetness intensity and because it has an excellent taste profile
even when compared to the gold standard, sugar."</TE>
<TE>   The FDA said Friday that neotame had been subjected to 113 animal
and human tests "designed to identify possible toxic effects, such as
cancer-causing, reproductive and neurological effects. From its
evaluation of the neotame database, the FDA was able to conclude that
neotame is safe for human consumption."</TE>
<TE>   Neotame critics, who could not be reached for comment Friday,
surfaced as early as 1999, when it was learned that neotame would be
chemically similar to aspartame.</TE>
<TE>   Critics pushed their cause on dozens of Internet sites, asking
consumers such questions as, "Why trade one poison for another?"</TE>
<TE>   Florida-based author and doctor H.J. Roberts and neurosurgeon
Russell Blaylock have written extensively on what they say are the
many health risks associated with aspartame.</TE>
<TE>   That sweetener has been linked by critics to several illnesses,
but the only official warning label on the product required by the
FDA applies to people who suffer from phenylketonuria, an inherited
disorder that leaves a person unable to break down phenylalanine, an
amino acid. Aspartame contains that substance.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA said neotame is much more chemically stable than aspartame
and does not break down into phenylalanine.</TE>
<TE>   Neotame is already on the market in Australia, having been
approved by the Australia New Zealand Food Authority in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   NutraSweet Co. is owned by J.W. Childs Equity Partners II, a
Boston-based investment group.</TE>

<HD>Reliant Unit Restates Its Earnings</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reliant Resources Inc. restated its earnings Friday for a three-year
period during which the company said it engaged in trades that
artificially inflated its revenue by more than $7.8 billion.</LD>
<LD>   In its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Reliant
said "round-trip trades" the company engaged in during 1999, 2000 and
2001 should not have been reflected in its revenue or expenses. The
trades added $6.4 billion to the company's revenue during that
period.</LD>
<LD>   Federal regulators are investigating Reliant and other energy
companies for so-called round-trip trades in which electricity is
bought and sold at the same quantity and price to inflate revenue and
trading volume.</LD>
<TE>   In addition to the round-trip trades, the company's revenue also
was inflated by nearly $1.5 billion because of how it accounted for
four other energy contracts. Reliant described these deals as swaps
but said each had a legitimate business purpose.</TE>
<TE>   Reliant previously reported $15.2 billion in revenue in 1999,
$29.3 billion in 2000 and $46.2 billion in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the company restated its revenue to $13.79 billion in
1999, $28.26 billion in 2000 and $40.81 billion in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The Houston-based company disclosed the round-trip trades in May.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Reliant Energy Inc., of which Reliant Resources is a
subsidiary, rose 24 cents to $16.05 on the New York Stock Exchange,
where shares of Reliant Resources gained 3 cents to close at $8.68.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A lawsuit against DaimlerChrysler challenging the safety of a seat
belt buckle was granted nationwide class-action status by a Texas
judge.</LD>
<LD>   The suit on behalf of owners of about 14 million Chrysler, Dodge
and Jeep vehicles focuses on a buckle known as the Gen 3. At least
three deaths have been blamed on the buckle, which the suit says is
prone to unlatching during accidents or unlatching from around child
and infant car seats in turns and sudden stops.</LD>
<LD>   DaimlerChrysler did not immediately return a telephone call
seeking comment.</LD>
<TE>   Suits filed in Texas, California, Ohio, Massachusetts and Georgia
claim the seat belt buckles are defective and release on impact,
making it look as if accident victims weren't wearing a seat belt.</TE>
<TE>   DaimlerChrysler shares rose $1.38 to $46.82 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<LD>Sempra Energy, Mirant Corp. and other power providers will hold
settlement talks next week with a Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission judge over electricity-supply contracts they have with a
California agency.</LD>
<LD>   The state has sought to renegotiate $43 billion in multiyear
contracts it signed with more than 20 suppliers last year to ease the
state's power crisis. Power prices in California have since dropped
by more than 90%. The state filed complaints with the commission in
February, alleging it was overcharged by as much as $21 billion.</LD>
<LD>   FERC Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr. will meet
with "all parties" Monday through Wednesday in Sacramento, according

<LD>Qwest Communications International Inc. said it is unaware of any
U.S. criminal investigation after the Wall Street Journal reported
that the telephone company is being probed by the Justice Department.</LD>
<LD>   "We have no reason to believe that we are the subject of any
investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice," said Drake Tempest,
Qwest's general counsel. The Justice Department declined to comment.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. attorney's office
in Denver are investigating Qwest, the newspaper reported, citing
unnamed sources. Qwest is under examination by the Securities and
Exchange Commission for its accounting. Shares of Denver-based Qwest
fell 17 cents, or 10%, to $1.53 on the NYSE.</LD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co. agreed to pay $28.6 million to settle a
class-action lawsuit filed by a former stockholder of its Compaq
Computer Corp. unit.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, filed by Mark Berger in federal court in Houston in
April 1998, contended that some Compaq executives artificially
inflated the stock price by issuing misleading statements while
selling their shares. Hewlett-Packard bought Houston-based Compaq in
May for $18.9 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Berger said in the suit that some Compaq executives sold almost
2.6 million shares of stock for more than $120 million between July
1997 and March 1998 before the company warned about high inventory
and reduced profit.</LD>
<TE>   While agreeing to the settlement, the executives, who were sued
along with the company, denied any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Palo Alto-based Hewlett-Packard rose 49 cents to $15.71
on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>Russia will reinstate a ban on U.S. chicken imports because it says
the U.S. hasn't guaranteed the poultry is safe, an action that will
cut off Tyson Foods Inc. from its largest export market and may
rekindle a trade dispute.</LD>
<LD>   Russia said the imports will be banned Aug. 1 because the two
governments haven't agreed on a certificate showing how the chickens
are processed. Russia wants processors to show they are following
rules on the use of chemicals, antibiotics and genetically modified
ingredients in feed.</LD>

<HD>Investors' Faith in Vivendi Rises</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Shares jump 10% as new execs work on debt
and consider a breakup.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vivendi Universal's stock climbed Friday, with shares closing 10%
higher, as investors gained confidence in a new management team and
its ability to avert a feared financial meltdown at the media giant.</LD>
<LD>   The increase was a welcome end to a week in which the stock
plunged in the wake of Monday's tumultuous ouster of Jean-Marie
Messier, followed by the selection of respected businessman Jean-Rene
Fourtou as interim chairman and chief executive.</LD>
<LD>   "The appointment of Fourtou is likely to add a new element of
stability," Merrill Lynch analyst Neil Blackley wrote in a note to
investors. "Confirmed bank support over the next two weeks is
essential to allay short-term liquidity concerns."</LD>
<TE>   The company's $30-billion debt load means Vivendi needs to raise
cash quickly by selling assets, which include Universal's Hollywood
film studio and music group. The board is considering unloading Canal
Plus, the money-losing European pay-TV and film company that could
fetch at least $2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Despite speculation the group may be broken up to solve its debt
problems, sources close to the board said it was in no rush to do so.
French politics could complicate efforts to split the companies into
French and American businesses.</TE>
<TE>   France's culture minister, Jean-Jacques Aillagon, told reporters
Friday that he wrote Fourtou to ensure Vivendi would not be
dismantled. He was apparently reacting to reports that the company
was considering selling Vivendi's Canal Plus, which finances half of
all movies made in France under an agreement with French regulators.</TE>
<TE>   As French politicians debated the fate of Canal Plus, the ousted
chairman lashed out at his critics.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with the French weekly Le Point, Messier accused
Charles Bronfman, uncle of Vivendi board member Edgar Bronfman Jr.,
of using "bootlegger methods" to regain control of the group. The
Bronfman family of Canada sold Seagram Co.'s liquor, film and music
business to Vivendi 18 months ago in a $34-billion deal.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Bronfman could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   At one point this week, the stock's value dropped to a 15-year low
after debt downgrades by credit-rating firms Moody's In- vestors
Service and Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. raised fears of a cash crunch.</TE>
<TE>   Upon taking over Wednesday, Fourtou vowed to immediately address
Vivendi's cash problems and gave himself a two-week deadline. The
company also embarked on talks with French banks to obtain new credit
lines after downgrades caused a $97.6-million credit line to be
terminated and $878 million in unused credit lines to mature.</TE>
<TE>   Underscoring the gravity of the company's cash position, Vivendi
said Wednesday night that it faced $1.75 billion of debts coming due
this month and had just $2.7 billion in cash and unused credit lines.</TE>
<TE>   But Fourtou expressed confidence the company would be able to
avert a financial collapse, which calmed investors and analysts who
were shellshocked by the near-panic selling earlier in the week. The
company's shares closed Friday at $17.27, up $1.61, on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The upswing was a sign that although institutional investors are
still wary, dealers said, confidence in the new team is slowly
coaxing them back.</TE>
<TE>   "There are definitely buyers out there, something we have not seen
for a while," one trader said. "The stock has been completely
massacred, so it's no surprise it is bouncing back."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>WorldCom Bondholders Propose Debt-Equity Swap</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENA AUBIN</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WorldCom Inc.'s bondholders are proposing a debt-for-equity swap that
could throw a lifeline to the struggling telecommunications company
by wiping out much of its $32.8 billion in debt.</LD>
<LD>   Bondholders have been in talks with the company about a swap that
probably would be part of a prearranged, or "prepackaged," bankruptcy
filing, experts said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "It seems to be the logical solution for the company," said Wilbur
Ross, a distressed-debt investor who has been buying WorldCom bonds
for his firm, WL Ross &amp; Co. "Everybody is pretty much in accord that
that's what's needed."</LD>
<TE>   Charged with fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
long-distance company has hired Blackstone Group, a top restructuring
advisor, and Weil Gotshal &amp; Manges, a leading bankruptcy law firm, to
help work through its myriad problems.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom edged closer to bankruptcy Monday after it was declared
in default on $4.25 billion of loans, giving lenders the right to
demand immediate repayment. The Clinton, Miss.-based company also
said it was reexamining two more years of accounting records.</TE>
<TE>   Under a debt-for-equity swap, WorldCom could get out from under
much of its massive interest burden, putting it on a stronger footing
against its debt-laden rivals.</TE>
<TE>   "This would be the only debt-free telecom company, especially of
its size," said Matthew Breckenridge, vice president of research at
DebtTraders, a global high-yield specialist firm. "It would throw off
a lot of cash and would be a good takeover target."</TE>
<TE>   Bondholders have an interest in keeping the company alive because
that gives them a better chance of recovering their money than a
liquidation, experts said. WorldCom saw its bonds plummet from as
high as 74 cents on the dollar to just 15 cents two weeks ago when it
said it had improperly booked almost $4 billion in expenses.</TE>
<TE>   "The big worry out there is that if things have to be done on [an]
asset sale basis, it's absolutely the worst time to be selling
telecom assets," said Nicholas Walsh, who manages $15 million of
distressed debt for Wilfrid Aubrey.</TE>
<TE>   A prepackaged bankruptcy also could stave off a long court
proceeding, helping WorldCom more quickly regain the confidence of
its customers, investors said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are two risks," Breckenridge said. "One is that there are
more accounting problems, and the other is that customers actually
leave the company. If you can avoid both, you're in good shape."</TE>
<TE>   Another concern of bondholders is that WorldCom, in an effort to
avoid bankruptcy, would agree to pledge collateral to its banks in
exchange for financing. That would put banks ahead of bondholders in
claims on the company. They both rank equally now as unsecured
creditors.</TE>
<TE>   IDT Corp. has offered to acquire the long-distance and local
telephone units of WorldCom in a deal it valued at $5 billion. IDT
Chairman Howard J. Jonas said Friday that WorldCom executives aren't
responding to the offer, but he predicted that there won't be any
other bidders.</TE>
<TE>   Jonas said IDT would continue to press the offer through meetings
starting next week with potential partners in the deal, WorldCom's
bondholders and bankers, and federal regulators.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of WorldCom gained 3 cents to close at 25 cents on the
Nasdaq Stock Market, which has begun proceedings to delist the stock.
WorldCom has requested a hearing; the stock will continue to trade in
the interim.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom's shareholders probably would end up with nothing in a
bankruptcy filing because WorldCom's outstanding debt is greater than
the company's value, experts said. Creditors must be paid in full
before shareholders receive anything in a bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   With more than 2.96 billion outstanding shares, a 25-cent share
price means that the market is valuing the company at more than $700
million, Ross said.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom said Friday that it would continue its in-house probe of
accounting problems, despite a Department of Justice request that the
ailing telecom desist. The primary motivation is getting to the
bottom of the company's finances, and there is no race to be first,
said a source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The Wall Street Journal reported that the Justice Department had
asked WorldCom to curtail its internal inquiry, citing concern about
witness tampering, while the government investigates. A company
spokeswoman declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, WorldCom filed a federal lawsuit in Mississippi against
former Chief Financial Officer Scott D. Sullivan, who was fired after
the accounting scandal came to light. WorldCom is demanding that
Sullivan, 40, pay back the $10-million bonus he received last year. A
WorldCom attorney declined to comment; Sullivan could not be reached.</TE>

<HD>Analysts on TV, Radio Face New Disclosure Rule</HD>
<DH>Securities: The SEC regulation, starting Tuesday, will
require commentators to reveal any financial interest in stocks they
discuss.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Securities analysts appearing on television and radio will have to
disclose any financial interest in the stocks on which they comment
beginning Tuesday, when new regulations take effect.</LD>
<LD>   The rules were announced by the Securities and Exchange Commission
on May 8, with a 60-day grace period.</LD>
<LD>   The disclosure requirements are part of a broad effort by
regulators to curb potential conflicts of interest by Wall Street
analysts. The conflicts were spotlighted by recent revelations that
Internet analysts at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. (ticker symbol: MER)
publicly touted stocks they had slammed privately as "junk."</LD>
<TE>   The SEC rules are designed to limit how and when analysts issue
opinions on stocks, restrict their personal investing activities and
force investment banks and their analysts to disclose more about
their ties to companies they research.</TE>
<TE>   Money managers and industry financial analysts are widely used as
guest commentators on business talk shows, but at least one
broadcaster downplayed the effect of the new rules.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey-based CNBC has had guidelines for financial
professionals appearing on the cable business network for several
years, said Patti Domm, a senior news editor.</TE>
<TE>   Among other requirements, she said, business professionals
appearing on CNBC are asked to ensure that their personal financial
activity is consistent with the opinions they express on the air and
to disclose any investment banking relationship between their firm
and the company they are discussing. A guest's interest in a stock
may be disclosed by either an on-screen graphic or pointed out by the
anchor, Domm said.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that it's a rule, we'll make even more effort to graphically
represent [the guest's interest] or disclose it during the
interview," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Rival CNNfn will be in complete compliance with the new
regulations, a representative said.</TE>

<HD>Merck Lowers Priceof Medco Unit IPO</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With a string of corporate accounting scandals sapping demand for new
stocks, drug maker Merck &amp; Co. (MRK) on Friday lowered the price
range for the initial public offering of its Medco Health Solutions
unit to $20 to $22 apiece from $22 to $24.</LD>
<LD>   The new range for the 46.7 million shares was officially disclosed
for the first time in an amended filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, although sources close to the deal preempted the
revision last month.</LD>
<LD>   In one of the largest IPOs this year, Merck could raise more than
$1 billion by spinning off Medco, which negotiates pharmaceutical
contracts for health insurers and accounts for more than half of
Merck's revenue.</LD>
<TE>   The latest regulatory filing gave no date for Medco's debut, but a
person familiar with the sale said it probably would come next week.</TE>
<TE>   Merck, which will retain a stake of at least 80.1% in the unit,
has delayed the Medco IPO twice as shares in its publicly traded
competitors remain weak and the wider market writhes in the wake of
the WorldCom (WCOME) scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Medco, which has been accused in past lawsuits of favoring Merck
drugs, has entered into a five-year contract that requires the unit
to maintain market share for the parent company's drugs or risk
having rebates paid to it reduced.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey-based Medco posted revenue of $29.07 billion and net
income of $256.6 million in 2001--increases of 30.6% and 18.6%,
respectively, from 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Merck shares closed at $48.86, up $1.58, in New York Stock
Exchange trading Friday.</TE>

<DH>Airline passengers need to tolerate a benign profiling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROB ASGHAR</AU>
<BD>Rob Asghar is a writer and editor who lives in Burbank.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's time for some ethnic profiling.</LD>
<LD>   A few weeks ago, my mother and father returned to Southern
California after a long stay in their native Pakistan. Spotting me
outside LAX's international terminal, my mother rushed up to hug me
when she noticed something different about me: a goatee. "Get rid of
that!" she said with typical maternal sensitivity that knows no
geographical or cultural bounds. I responded, "But, Mom, I like it.
Kinda makes me look dangerous!" She groaned, "Yes. You'll never get
on an airplane again."</LD>
<LD>   I laughed, but then wondered whether she had a point, especially
since I'd soon be visiting my baby niece in Michigan. When the day
arrived for my flight to Detroit, I showed up at Los Angeles
International Airport wearing an Old Navy flag shirt and would have
happily sported an "I carry no weapons" baseball cap if such an item
were manufactured. To my surprise, I sailed through. Maybe I can't
get arrested in this town, or in my destination city, or in
connecting cities. At the check-in desks and six different
checkpoints, no one batted an eye at me.</LD>
<TE>   Relief soon turned to irritation. Here, after all, was a youngish
South Asian male traveling alone. My driver's license could easily
have belonged to another person, revealing as it did a clean-shaven
person with (lamentably) a fuller head of hair than the man standing
before them. By giving me an easy ride through security, the airport
staff was making me--and every other traveler--much less safe.</TE>
<TE>   I recalled the last time I had facial hair, a dozen years ago,
during which time I traveled to Pakistan. Security staff in L.A. and
London sped me along, but their counterparts in Islamabad were
relentless and overbearingly cautious in ensuring that the guy with
the beard was the same fellow as the unbearded person pictured in my
passport. I almost didn't make my flight back to L.A. because the
Pakistani police were so intent on stopping anyone trying to get to
the United States illegally.</TE>
<TE>   Why the difference in approach? The American and British security
personnel may have overlooked me because we "all look the same." But
more likely, the Pakistani personnel were less squeamish about
ethnically profiling one of their own.</TE>
<TE>   Racial and ethnic profiling can be repugnant. But they also
represent a sensible aspect of human logic, tied to what social
psychologists would consider a normal cognitive process called
"sampling bias." Some groups should be watched in certain benign
ways.</TE>
<TE>   We, the watched, have to be ready to respond with grace to real
and perceived slights, whenever and wherever they may happen. Middle
Eastern Christians can look to a Christ who calls on them to turn the
other cheek. Muslims can look to a prophet Muhammad who was
long-suffering and merciful toward Meccan authorities who had abused
him during his ministry. The most compelling force on Earth is the
power unleashed by the person who can take a hit with grace. And most
important, a degree of sensitively handled racial profiling will make
the U.S. a safer society. So stop strip-searching the little old
white lady and take another gander at me the next time I come walking
through LAX.</TE>
<TE>   "Grow up, and that is a terribly hard thing to do," F. Scott
Fitzgerald said. "It is much easier to skip it and go from one
childhood to another." Good counsel for profiling-phobic
Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta and others in this nation
who may be overly sensitive about profiling. In coming years, all of
us will need to show the maturity that can more graciously
accommodate the small and large insults of life.</TE>

<HD>Payday Lenders, Though Flawed, Have a Place</HD>

<AU>DIANNE WILKMAN</AU>
<BD>Dianne Wilkman is president and CEO of Springboard
Nonprofit Consumer Credit Management.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In California's most blighted neighborhoods, so-called payday lenders
promising quick and easy cash have replaced liquor stores and bail
bondsmen as the modern symbols of blight. Payday lenders deal with a
growing number of consumers who have few other financial options,
offering them short-term loans at extremely high interest rates.</LD>
<LD>   Most critics insist that this practice, though legal, is just
loan-sharking. But we should pause before we rush to limit consumers'
credit choices. Payday lenders are the sole providers for small,
short-term, unsecured loans that can be obtained with no credit
check.</LD>
<LD>   If payday lenders were willing to modestly regulate their own
industry, they could join the ranks of mainstream creditors and
provide a first step toward credit-worthiness for some consumers.</LD>
<TE>   Payday lenders give cash to people who deposit with them personal
checks ranging from $100 to $300, which is the legal limit. These
personal checks are for the loaned amount, plus a fee. Lenders agree
not to cash the checks until a borrower's next payday. According to
Consumers' Union, fees for $100 payday loans can range up to
$17.50--more than 450% on an annual basis for a two-week loan and
twice that for a one-week loan. That is a heavy charge, though the
risks and expenses of making such small, unsecured loans are great.</TE>
<TE>   Since payday loans were first authorized six years ago in
California, there have been numerous attempts by the state to rein
them in. One strict bill failed last year in the state Assembly. But
there will be other attempts at regulation. Payday lenders have the
chance to improve their practices before heavy regulations are
imposed on them.</TE>
<TE>   The fundamental premise of payday loans--often used for necessary
expenses such as automobile repairs--is not bad. It's the absence of
consumer-oriented lending standards and practices that imperil
borrowers who get in over their heads with repeated, costly loans.</TE>
<TE>   The acquisition of check cashing/payday lending outlets by more
credible financial institutions like Union Bank of California, which
now owns the Nix lending chain, is a step in the right direction. The
bank-owned payday lenders bring ATMs and other regular banking
services, like checking accounts, back into low-income communities.
Other benefits include allowing residents to store money safely,
which deters crime.</TE>
<TE>   Yet fixes are needed, such as restricting the number of loans
consumers can take, allowing the repayment of debt in installments at
reasonable interest rates and making sure borrowers clearly
understand the terms of payday loans. Payday lenders might also link
up with nonprofit credit counseling agencies to provide immediate
help to payday loan customers who show signs of getting into trouble.</TE>
<TE>   There has been one step in this direction: A payday lending trade
group, the California Financial Service Providers, has agreed to
accept debt management plans worked out with borrowers by credit
counseling agencies. The group could help manage the industry's risk
as well as help consumers dig out of excessive debt.</TE>
<TE>   Payday lenders must recognize that in the long run they won't
avoid excessive government regulation unless they better protect
consumers.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Times article Friday on peaceful July 4 celebrations nationally
pretty much said it all: "Other than a shooting attack at Los Angeles
International Airport that left three people dead.... " Other than
that? Actually, that is an apt measure of how far and fast we've had
to come in a new age of domestic terrorism. Airline, airport and city
security forces moved swiftly and lethally, subduing Thursday's
airport threat almost as soon as it emerged. Good work.</LD>
<LD>   There are, of course, still questions, some semantic: What exactly
constitutes terrorism? What if El Al Israel Airlines had not had
armed guards at its ticket counter? Indeed, most airlines across the
world do not have armed guards at counters.</LD>
<LD>   This incident, temporarily stunning the world's third-busiest
airport, revealed that we have further to go in adjusting
institutions for new security realities. Mayor James K. Hahn made a
prompt reassuring appearance. "Security," he said, "is an evolving
science." True.</LD>
<TE>   Here are some fast initial lessons from Thursday's violence.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn should consider more and earlier security checks as he
develops his airport plan. And obviously, authorities and agencies
need to better handle collateral civilian damage from such paralyzing
incidents or even mere threats. Thousands of would-be passengers,
including harried parents with small children, spent endless, empty
hours seeking information, food and comfort. People adjust to
inconvenience, as in their patience with new security procedures. But
the image of thousands of milling, tired, hungry, even angry would-be
LAX passengers will not help lift air traffic and tourism from their
post-9/11 slump.</TE>
<TE>   Airports and airlines need contingency plans to communicate far
better with stranded passengers and serve their needs after an
incident. An abandoned backpack, much less a gunman, provokes a
security frenzy that can take hours to unravel. The Homeland Security
Office should start developing a template for local officials.
Traveling parents can't portage an infant plus a full day of
supplies. You need a boarding pass to reach a restaurant, so parents
Thursday had to feed youngsters whatever newsstand junk was
available.</TE>
<TE>   What about Salvation Army-style mobile canteens to provide basic
sustenance and comfort? And mini-SWAT teams of airport workers on
call to better disseminate calming information? Armed officials
yelling, "You must leave now! This is not a request!" in an
international terminal in English only was less than helpful.</TE>
<TE>   As the science of security evolves, we'll learn better that in the
struggle against terrorism and the contagious virus of fear,
preparation and common-sense communications can also be high-caliber
weapons.</TE>

<LD>Not even Brazilians' whooping ecstasy at winning the World Cup this
week could counterbalance international investors' deepening
melancholy about that South American nation's economy. Brazil's stock
prices are foundering, and last week J.P. Morgan's bond market index
had Brazil as a riskier investment than even impoverished,
overcrowded Nigeria.</LD>
<LD>   That doesn't make much sense. With a population of 175 million
spread across 3,261,200 square miles, Brazil is Latin America's
largest country and produces enough steel, autos, chemicals,
machinery, shoes and other products to generate a gross domestic
product of about $500 billion. Yet investors seem to believe that
among the main emerging economies, only Argentina, which defaulted on
its debt in December, is a more hazardous place to put money.</LD>
<LD>   International investors have both economic and political concerns
about Brazil.</LD>
<TE>   First, the nation has enormous debt--55% of its GDP. However,
leading international economists believe that Brazilian authorities'
astute handling of the economy after a 1999 devaluation crisis shows
they have the brains to finance the nation's debt without creating
the chaos that plagues Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that most of the debt is domestic also works in Brazil's
favor, since much of it can be financed in local currency and, for
the most part, negotiated with Brazilian institutions. That means it
isn't so strongly subject to the exchange variations of the dollar
that have caused havoc in Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, Brazil has displayed much stricter fiscal discipline than
Argentina. This has allowed the Brazilian treasury to run a primary
fiscal surplus--the surplus before interest payments--of more than
3.5% of GDP.</TE>
<TE>   Investors' political worries hinge on the possibility that come
October, Brazilians may elect as president left-wing politician Luiz
Inacio Lula da Silva. Lula has hinted that he would follow the same
fiscal discipline as President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, at one time
considered a leftist. Everywhere Lula's Workers' Party has won power
it has earned a reputation for clean government and responsible
management. But a clearer commitment to disciplined free-market
economics could ease investors' minds.</TE>
<TE>   Trouble in Brazil means big trouble in the hemisphere. Argentine
President Eduardo Duhalde has urged the International Monetary Fund
to provide whatever help Brazil needs. Likewise, the U.S. cannot
afford to let Brazil face its economic challenges alone.</TE>

<HD>'Sin Tax' for Trauma Centers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles, as everyone knows, is a city of cars, which means that
trauma centers here do a bang-up business. If you are in a serious
car accident--a leading cause of death for people under 35--your best
chance of surviving is to be treated at a trauma center within what
is known as the "golden hour" after the crash. Assuming, that is, you
can get into one.</LD>
<LD>   That is an assumption we too often take for granted. No federal,
state or local law requires hospitals to provide trauma centers, the
emergency-rooms-on-steroids that come stocked with specialized
equipment and staffed by highly trained doctors and nurses, including
surgeons not just on call but on the premises. All this costs
money--$18,000 an injury on average, not counting whatever
hospitalization or care the patient receives afterward. In these days
of tightly managed care, private insurance doesn't begin to cover the
costs, and Medi-Cal and other government programs for the uninsured
do worse.</LD>
<TE>   The 10 private hospitals in Los Angeles County that have trauma
centers lost $17 million on trauma care last year. No wonder 10 other
hospitals have closed their centers in the last 15 years, even as the
county's population continues to increase and crowd the ones that
remain open. As for the three county-run hospitals with trauma
centers, the county health department faces an $800-million deficit
over the next three years. In addition to the trauma centers, nearly
every other health service the county offers is at risk.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the state Legislature provided a one-time, $17-million
tourniquet to keep trauma centers in Los Angeles County from bleeding
to death. Now the state, like the county, is struggling with its own
deficit.</TE>
<TE>   It comes down to this: Trauma care saves lives but loses money. If
we want to save this crucial service, we have to come up with a
steady way to pay for it.</TE>
<TE>   The Healthcare Assn. of Southern California, a consortium of
hospital directors, doctors groups and other health-care providers,
has come up with a plan: Add a fee to the fines charged to anyone
caught speeding in the county. The money would be collected and
distributed by a specially created district to ensure that it went
solely to trauma care.</TE>
<TE>   The county Board of Supervisors is hesitant to put any fee
increase on the November ballot. It shouldn't be. Anti-tax purists
would have a hard time criticizing a "sin tax" on a violation that
plays such a direct role in the traffic accidents that send so many
to trauma centers. Sensible people surely will recognize that if we
want trauma care to be there when we need it, this is a rational way
to make sure it is.</TE>

<HD>A Walk on Rodriguez's Side of the Street</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the June 29 edition of The Times we read about four Anglo teens
from an upscale neighborhood in San Diego beating five elderly
Mexican workers with clubs, robbing them of $2 and then, when on
trial, being "truly sorry," apologizing and being jailed for 90 to
120 days of a possible 12 years after their lawyer did what the
elderly innocents probably did--begged for mercy.</LD>
<LD>   In the same edition we read of a local hero, comedian Paul
Rodriguez, giving freely of himself--his time, his money, his
attention--to kids from El Centro, not many miles from San Diego.</LD>
<LD>   In so doing, Rodriguez is setting an example of the fine person
who hopefully dwells within all of us. As a token of appreciation, a
street (no, a boulevard) named for him is opposed because he isn't
dead or because guidelines haven't yet been established. I am amazed,
saddened, outraged.</LD>
<TE>   In 1985, I was a member of the '50s group Sha Na Na and had the
pleasure of knowing Rodriguez, who opened for us on that summer's
tour. I found him to be a warm and thoughtful person who cared deeply
about his family and community.</TE>
<TE>   He told me that there was one man, a sergeant in the Army, who
encouraged him to read and who turned his life around. Rodriguez may
be that one man for many who observe his generosity of spirit.</TE>
<TE>   In this time of ominously escalating racial intolerance and
apathy, if there is a petition to be signed to put Rodriguez's name
on a street, avenue, drive, place, lane, circle or boulevard, please
put my name at the top.</TE>
<TE>   Guerin Barry</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   According to Rodriguez, race determines where you live and how
much money you earn. Not achievement through hard work, but race.
That's some message of hope for the poor working families of El
Centro. No matter what they do or how badly they struggle, they're
doomed to live in poverty because Rodriguez doesn't believe Latinos
can rise above their lot in life.</TE>
<TE>   Say goodbye to the American dream, El Centro residents.</TE>

<HD>Gunman Kills Two at LAX: It's Terrorism</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Gunman Kills Two at LAX," July 5: A heavily armed Egyptian-born
man opens fire at an El Al terminal, and the FBI hesitates to call it
terrorism. Perhaps, FBI officials say, it was "only" a hate crime.
When a worldwide movement like irredentist Islamism calls upon every
Muslim to rise up and slaughter Americans and Jews, is an event like
the LAX shootings anything but the ultimate success of terrorist
strategy and tactics? When Yasser Arafat's regime foments hatred
against Israeli civilians, do his lip-service condemnations of
homicide bombers absolve him of blame?</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. must realize, as Israel has for decades, that terrorist
operatives, whether recruited in person or inspired from a distance,
are only foot soldiers within the terrorist infrastructure. The
ideological and financial nerve centers of this infrastructure must
be destroyed. Only then will we be safe at our airports, houses of
worship and other public gathering places</LD>
<LD>   Jay Braun</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The FBI advised there was an "incident" at LAX. A man leaves a
note at home that says "Read the Koran," carries a couple of guns and
a knife to the El Al check-in counter and starts to kill people. We
know the FBI has been unable to answer many questions in recent
months concerning national safety, but you would think officials
would at least be capable of recognizing terrorism when it occurs.</TE>
<TE>   Tom McBride</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So, with all the security, a gunman still got into the airport and
shot people. I guess we should be very grateful that the El Al
security guard at the Bradley terminal had a loaded gun, or the
victim and death tolls would have been much higher.</TE>
<TE>   As to the National Guard members who were at LAX and told [for a
short period in October] not to have their weapons loaded, perhaps
this will help people understand that folly. You do not fight deadly
force with politically correct platitudes. You fight deadly force
with equal, if not greater, deadly force. And you don't worry about
understanding the motives of that terrorist; you eliminate him from
society.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Levy</TE>
<TE>   Redondo Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   El Al's outstanding security mitigated what could have been a much
worse tragedy. No airline in the world matches El Al's security
because it is very expensive--mostly paid by the government of
Israel. Israel is to be commended; however, one has to think about
the fact that the U.S. gives Israel $3 billion each year. It is time
for the U.S. to re-regulate our air carriers and insist that they
have comparable security to El Al's, or else we should pay for
security for our airlines that matches El Al's.</TE>

<TE>   Each state already has its own group of professional law
enforcement men and women who could take over airport security
tomorrow and run it like champs. I'm talking about the Department of
Corrections. Not only could its guards screen and search passengers
and carry-on items but also checked-through luggage and all vehicles
entering the airport. In addition to that they could handle tarmac
and perimeter security.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, I'm suggesting a main gate, double-fence barbed wire and
guard towers. Maybe even some dogs. Now, that would be a secure
airport. Anything short of that would be just for looks.</TE>

<LD>It was a shame about those kids in the Blue Light Mine, but I am
surprised at your dreamy optimism that warning signs will deter such
stupid stunts ("Unmarked Mine Menace," editorial, June 28). On the
contrary, danger notices will likely do more to encourage that type
of personality. Nothing so entices as to be told you can't do
something or go somewhere.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, youth will be adventuresome, but there is a fine line between
adventure and stupidity. Witness all those folks building in the fire
zones and flood plains or the idiots who continue to run
train-crossing gates. It's hard to legislate common sense, and,
tragically, there will always be those who will never listen or
learn.</LD>

<LD>Your June 28 editorial on Amtrak, "Public Rails, Public Money," while
rightly supportive of continuing support for rail passenger service,
missed the mark badly with the observation that "union
featherbedding" is one of the reasons Amtrak is a "financial
sinkhole." In reality, Amtrak workers have shown remarkable
productivity increases over the years. Rail labor has worked with
Amtrak management in numerous ways and has made many cost-saving
agreements. Union railroad workers have, in fact, had their wages
frozen for the last 2 1/2 years.</LD>
<LD>   The Amtrak system is woefully understaffed. Many Amtrak trains are
running with only one train attendant for four coach cars, and
station service has been reduced to the bare minimum, causing
exhaustion for the work force. It is unfair and untruthful to lay the
blame for Amtrak's financial woes at the feet of the people who
struggle every day to keep the system running. The 1997 congressional
mandate that Amtrak become self-sufficient, something that no
passenger railroad in the world has ever achieved, was nothing more
than a cynical attempt by certain members of Congress to eliminate
the railroad entirely. It reeked of a double standard, considering
the massive amounts of subsidy given to air and highway
transportation.</LD>
<TE>   Amtrak and passenger rail in this country stand at a crossroads.
It is time for Congress and the Bush administration to recognize that
the country needs--and wants--a viable rail system, and it must
provide the necessary funding to support such a system. Amtrak should
not be seen as a profit-making enterprise but rather as a necessary
public service, just as rail service is viewed in all the other
industrial nations of the world. Given adequate funding and support,
the working men and women of Amtrak can and will provide the nation
with the best rail system in the world.</TE>

<TE>   Fortunately, Amtrak was saved in the nick of time, if only for a
few months. How long till the next cash crunch will hit?</TE>
<TE>   What we need desperately is a long-term solution--not Band-Aids to
stop the hemorrhage. We subsidize highways, runways, subways and many
others such as waterways, shipbuilding, a host of industries and,
above all, the agribusiness conglomerates. But we expect our
passenger trains to subsist on a starvation diet of occasional
government handouts.</TE>
<TE>   Every developed country with an efficient rail network is, in
part, dependent upon subsidies. As 9/11 has shown, we must maintain
our railroads and even expand them.</TE>
<TE>   Of course it was ridiculous for Amtrak to employ 85 vice
presidents or to work on the basis of union work rules known as
"featherbedding" in earlier times. This waste of money has to stop.
Amtrak President David L. Gunn is on the right track, but he needs
the support of Congress and the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Train schedules must be improved to drastically reduce running
times and eliminate the delays caused by freight trains claiming the
right of way over passenger trains. Six hours from Santa Barbara to
San Diego, a distance of a little over 200 miles, is simply
unacceptable today. Why can the Europeans and the Japanese cover
similar distances in three hours or less? Maybe we could learn
something from them. Why not give it a try?</TE>
<TE>   Privatization of Amtrak is definitely not the answer, as the
British experience has shown. We must recognize that passenger
railroads are part of our infrastructure and fund them accordingly.</TE>

<LD>Most who are playing political blame games over the flood of
corporate fraud and Wall Street corruption have no moral ground to
stand on, simply because it was all but lost by the social erosion of
the "me generation."</LD>
<LD>   Many former "anti-establishment" baby boomers have evolved into
the excessive political and corporate establishments of
today--shamelessly promoting their selfish interests, dishonesty and
superficial extremes as they went along.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, before the finger pointers cast more nets of condemnation,
they should first check out the rise of lost jobs, victimized
investors and shrinking pension funds in their own backyards--then
take a long look in the mirror.</LD>

<TE>   So, the Bush-Cheney duo want corporate reform in the wake of their
pals' fraudulent behavior ("Business Reform on Bush Agenda," June
29). I had a good laugh, then the smile went away. Will this pair
suddenly feel the pain of the thousands in the rank and file now
without jobs because of corporate criminality and greed?</TE>
<TE>   Will the people again become the gullible sheep while conservative
leaders secretly enrich the protected few and force an already
beleaguered middle class to pay higher taxes to offset losses caused
by corporate offshore accounts? Are we to believe that two people so
hopelessly steeped in the capitalist shame game will effect real
change in corporate morality?</TE>
<TE>   The credentials these two hold tend to belie their gaze of
righteousness and the justice they might appear to seek. Vice
President Dick Cheney chaired a company being investigated by the SEC
and is obstructing the full release of secret Enron notes vital to
administration energy policy. And President Bush, inspired by family
tradition, sucked up corporate money from greed-enraptured energy
barons from the beginning of his political career.</TE>
<TE>   Why do I feel that anything leaving their lips is empty patronage
void of ethical substance?</TE>

<TE>   It is hilarious to hear Republicans claim that the corporate
scandals are a nonpartisan problem. I'm sorry, but this issue is
probably the defining one when it comes to differentiating the two
parties. For the last century, the Republicans have cast their lot,
and their votes, with big business. They have pushed for deregulation
at every turn. The Bush administration, packed with CEOs and under
the thumbs of some very powerful corporate special interests, is the
epitome of this tradition.</TE>
<TE>   The Republicans and their accomplices in the media are quick to
point out that big business donates to Democrats as well as
Republicans, though the facts show that the GOP gets the lion's share
of its largess. This, however, is a red herring. It's not who gives
money to a politician, it's how he or she votes that makes the
difference. If the media let Bush and the GOP weasel out of their
responsibility for this mess, they should be ashamed of themselves.</TE>

<TE>   We small investors stand by helplessly while corporation after
corporation admits dishonest bookkeeping and outright thievery. And
we wonder, why isn't our government punishing these executives? Of
course we know why.</TE>
<TE>   Sorry--a slap on the wrist isn't enough. Five years or more
without early parole in federal prison might dissuade future
dishonesty in other companies.</TE>
<TE>   But where are the money managers of the mutual funds and pensions?
Their records look bad to their clients because of their losses and
will cause huge withdrawals. They have the power we little people
don't have--why aren't they using it to prosecute and imprison the
executives of Enron, WorldCom, Global Crossing, Rite Aid and the
others who are admitting to keeping false records? Something's rotten
on Wall Street!</TE>

<TE>   In a time of unprecedented corporate greed, how gratifying to read
about Rob Morones, a Kmart store manager in Show Low, Ariz. (June
28). Here is a man who at great personal risk and sacrifice
single-handedly kept his store open for weary firefighters during the
state's worst blaze. Yes, he is to be commended. But beyond that, top
Kmart executives should immediately elevate him to company spokesman
to replace Martha Stewart. He is a stellar example of what is best in
an employee and a human being.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Training Rxzzzz," Commentary, July 1: The Accreditation Council
for Graduate Medical Education recognizes that reducing duty hours
alone will not ensure high-quality education and effective patient
care. The regulations also call for comprehensive oversight by
supervising doctors and stringent compliance regulations for
residency programs.</LD>
<LD>   Schedules for teaching staff will be structured to provide ready
supervision and faculty consultation for residents on duty. Duty-hour
assignments will reflect the collective responsibility that faculty
and residents have for patients' safety and care.</LD>
<LD>   Residency programs are designed to ensure that students get the
necessary experience to make them skilled professionals. Getting this
experience requires long hours of being available so that when
opportunities arise to perform and repeat procedures, resident
physicians are there to take advantage of them. Long hours are also
due to a rigorous education program that requires hands-on training,
attendance at meetings and seminars and administrative duties
associated with patient cases.</LD>
<TE>   Changes in the health-care environment have led to an intensified
workload for residents. Medical advances have expanded care options,
shorter stays for patients require condensing care, and financial
pressures have slashed support staff and services available to
residents. The ACGME's reforms take all of these issues into account.</TE>

<LD>The militant left may promote its agenda of atheism, but it is about
to defeat itself. Should the 9th Circuit decision on removing the
words "under God" from the Pledge of Allegiance be upheld, very
quickly there will be a constitutional amendment: Congress shall make
no law abridging the right of the people to acknowledge the
importance of God in public affairs. This will protect "In God We
Trust," restore "under God"--and, in the bargain, make prayer in
public schools constitutional.</LD>

<TE>   The 9th Circuit Court has written a very lucid argument that two

<TE>   Re "3 Federal Judges in California Swim Against a Fervent National
Tide" (June 29), which quotes U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge
Stephen Reinhardt at length while ignoring opponents of his ruling:
Reinhardt is a political activist carrying out a left-wing agenda
with a vengeance. He can chatter all he wants about the Bill of
Rights, but what he's doing is destroying it.</TE>
<TE>   His ludicrous statement that the Bill of Rights exists to protect
the rights of the minority should disqualify him from the federal
judiciary.</TE>
<TE>   The Bill of Rights exists to bestow the exact same rights on each
American. There are no minority or majority rights. The rights are
for every individual, not for members of any group. That's the only
way freedom can exist. You cannot accommodate one person by stripping
the rights of another, whether it relates to speech, religion,
conscience, assembly or any other constitutional right.</TE>
<TE>   Reinhardt talks about "doing good." A judge does good by

<TE>   Funny how we got through the Revolutionary War and the Civil War
without the Pledge of Allegiance and then went on to win World War I
and WWII without the words "under God" inserted in our pledge. Even
funnier, for those worried about hurting God's feelings, the words "I
pledge allegiance to the flag" violate the Commandment about
worshipping images.</TE>

<TE>   I recall one significant change in the pledge, which occurred in
the early '40s. This change had to do with arm and hand position.
Routinely, each school day began with the Pledge of Allegiance. And,
as is customary, we started with our right hand over our heart. When
we reached the part "to the flag," we would then extend our arms
toward the flag with our palms up.</TE>
<TE>   We held that position until the end of the pledge. As the war in
Europe increased, it was realized that our extended arms were very
similar to the Nazis' "Heil Hitler." It was then decided that we
would not extend our arms but would keep our hands over our hearts
throughout the entire pledge, as is done today.</TE>

<HD>Animal Owner or Guardian?</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Barking Up the Wrong Tree," editorial, June 30: I applaud your
stance on the pet guardian issue, but let's take it one step further.
If your dog or cat is stolen and you no longer "own" it once you are
its mere guardian, can you prevail in a court of law as its rightful
owner? If you no longer own your dog(s), can anybody force you to
license them? Vaccinate them? And can animal control enforce barking
and other nuisance complaints against "nonowners" of pets?</LD>
<LD>   Becoming a pet guardian sounds cute, but it disenfranchises pet
owners with respect to their basic legal protections and rights,
while posing interesting problems for government agencies charged
with holding pet owners responsible for the conduct of their pets. Do
we need lawsuits to test the validity of these implications?</LD>
<LD>   Here's hoping our city leaders put on their thinkers before they
go for what sounds like a silly, if charming, change in reclassifying
L.A. city pet owners as guardians.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   At the Animal Services Commission meeting where they voted to
change all the department's forms so that residents of L.A. are no
longer the owners of their pets but merely the guardians, there was
no discussion to clarify how "guardian" (a legal term denoting
temporary custodial care) can be equated with "owner," which carries
full and permanent title and accountability. Animals are considered
personal property under the law for good reason--they will never be
able to be emancipated and care for themselves as can a human; thus
the one who makes a pet his or her "own" can be held responsible
under the law for its welfare and protection for its entire lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   To proclaim that merely changing a word will change the behavior
of those who abuse, neglect and abandon millions of companion animals
each year is naive. It would be wonderful if we could eradicate human
violence, oppression and irresponsibility by merely giving the
perpetrators a new warm-and-fuzzy name, but unfortunately that is not
how evil is corrected. L.A. has serious, unresolved animal issues
that must be addressed with the full force of law so that the
residents and pets of this city can be safe. This is not the time to
obfuscate terms and create confusion on documents that must be used
to determine responsibility and obtain prosecutions.</TE>

<HD>Benjamin O. Davis Jr., 89; First Black Air Force General
Led Tuskegee Airmen</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN WEIL</AU>
<BD>THE WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Benjamin O. Davis Jr., a pioneering military officer who led the
fabled Tuskegee Airmen during World War II and was the first African
American to become a general in the Air Force, has died. He was 89.</LD>
<LD>   Davis died July 4 at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington
of complications from Alzheimer's disease.</LD>
<LD>   In a career that began in the days of segregation, Davis, who was
born in the nation's capital and lived there much of his life,
compiled a long history of achievements and accomplishments. His
combat record and that of the unit he led have been credited with
playing a major role in prompting the integration of the armed
services after World War II.</LD>
<TE>   In 1970, after his retirement from the Air Force, he supervised
the federal sky marshal program that was designed to quell a rash of
airliner hijackings. In 1971, he was named an assistant secretary of
transportation.</TE>
<TE>   At the time he left the Air Force as a lieutenant general, wearing
three stars, he was the senior black officer in the armed forces. In
1998, President Clinton awarded Davis a fourth star, advancing him to
full general.</TE>
<TE>   "Gen. Davis is here today as living proof that a person can
overcome adversity and discrimination, achieve great things, turn
skeptics into believers; and through example and perseverance, one
person can bring truly extraordinary change," Clinton said.</TE>
<TE>   As wartime commander of the 332nd Fighter Group, Davis and his
pilots escorted bombers on 200 air combat missions over Europe,
flying into the teeth of Nazi air defenses.</TE>
<TE>   It was one of the fighter group's proudest achievements that not
one of the bombers it protected was lost to an enemy fighter.</TE>
<TE>   This dazzling success was a tribute both to the pilots' skill and
to Davis' leadership, according to historian Alan Gropman.</TE>
<TE>   Davis was a natural leader, a stern disciplinarian and an officer
with a clear idea of what his mission was and how to carry it out,
said Gropman, an author and chairman of the department of grand
strategy and mobilization at the Industrial College of the Armed
Forces.</TE>
<TE>   Other escort units, according to Gropman, ranged widely to search
out enemy fighters. Davis "told his men to stay with the bombers"
they were assigned to protect. "They were not out looking for glory.
They were out to do their mission."</TE>
<TE>   Davis flew 60 missions in P-39, P-40, P-47 and P-51 fighters.</TE>
<TE>   By the time he was assigned to lead the all-black unit, nicknamed
the Tuskegee Airmen for the Alabama base where they had trained,
Davis had withstood stern tests of his character, self-discipline and
determination.</TE>
<TE>   According to Gropman, when Davis graduated from the U.S. Military
Academy at West Point, N.Y., in 1936, he was only the fourth African
American ever to do so.</TE>
<TE>   At the academy, Davis was shunned. Other cadets refused to speak
with him except for official reasons. By some accounts, this
persisted throughout his first year. However, Gropman said the silent
treatment continued throughout all four years at West Point. Davis
had no roommate in the dormitory and no one else assigned to his tent
in the field.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' father, Benjamin O. Davis Sr., was one of two black combat
officers in the Army and eventually was promoted to brigadier
general. His son decided that he wanted to become a pilot and to
attend West Point. There, he refused to give in to the harassment,
Gropman said.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't leaving," Davis told Gropman. "This is something I
wanted to do, and I wasn't going to let anybody drive me out."</TE>
<TE>   After graduation, there were no aviation openings for Davis and no
black units for him to join. He took other assignments in the Army
until President Franklin D. Roosevelt decided in 1940 to create an
African American squadron in the Army Air Corps. Davis was chosen for
command.</TE>
<TE>   He earned his wings in 1942 and was sent the next year to North
Africa to lead the 99th Fighter Squadron.</TE>
<TE>   Davis had long resented and opposed segregation. But as leader of
the Tuskegee Airmen, he insisted that those under him refrain from
demonstrating against its injustices. Instead, according to Gropman,
he took the position that there was a war to be won and that the time
to protest would come afterward.</TE>
<TE>   "He always believed in integration," Gropman said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1947, the Air Force was made a separate service. One of its
generals conducted a study of segregation in the service and
recommended integration. According to Gropman, a principal argument
for it was the record of Davis and his pilots in proving that blacks
could perform as well as whites in all jobs. The Air Force integrated
in 1949.</TE>
<TE>   Davis retired as deputy commander in chief of the U.S. Strike
Command.</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Agatha, died this year.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include a sister.</TE>

<HD>Security Tight for Hollister Biker Rally</HD>
<DH>Rivalry: The largest gathering since a clash between rival
clubs attracts an estimated 80,000 enthusiasts--and 100 law
enforcement officers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOLLISTER</DL>
<LD>With tensions high and security tight, thousands of motorcyclists
thundered into the rural community of Hollister on Friday, swamping
downtown and turning it into a throbbing carnival of chrome, wheels
and leather.</LD>
<LD>   Grizzled bikers in chaps sat astride gleaming Harleys, gunning the
engines, rattling windows and screeching tires.</LD>
<LD>   Merchants hawked such items as Harley-Davidson shot glasses and
Louisiana alligator heads, while men lined up to be photographed with
young women in sheer pink negligees.</LD>
<TE>   Sprinkled among the estimated 80,000 bikers attending this
weekend's 55th annual Hollister Independence Rally were more than 100
local, state and federal law enforcement agents backed by four
aircraft ready to pounce, should violence flare between the rival
Hells Angels and Mongol motorcycle clubs. As of Friday evening, they
had arrested only one, accused of drunkenness.</TE>
<TE>   "When you get this many people together with alcohol there is the
potential for trouble," said Hollister Police Chief Bill Pierpoint.
"But I personally think they want this to succeed and will police
themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, but no one is taking any chances here in the town that
inspired the movie "The Wild One" and is called "the birthplace of
the American biker."</TE>
<TE>   This is the largest motorcycle rally since April 27, when two
Mongols and a Hells Angel were killed and 16 others were injured in a
clash between the two clubs at the River Run in Laughlin, Nev.
Another Hells Angel was slain later on a highway outside of town. One
suspect has been arrested.</TE>
<TE>   The turf war forced the cancellation of two planned motorcycle
events in Ventura County in May.</TE>
<TE>   The fallout spawned rumors that spread through Hollister this
week. The largely Latino Mongols weren't coming, they said, or they
were coming in disguise. Others said the Mongols were going to take
over Johnny's bar, a historic saloon and epicenter of the rally. It's
also a few yards from where the Hells Angels were hawking pins and
T-shirts.</TE>
<TE>   The bar owner, Cherise Tyson, noticed the Hells Angels weren't in
their normal corner perch at Johnny's the night before. She called in
some bikers who emphasize their Christianity. "We said a prayer to
protect us," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Charles T. Mathews, lawyer for the Mongols, said they were indeed
coming to Hollister.</TE>
<TE>   "They are not looking for or expecting any trouble," he said. "We
can't be absolutely certain that there won't be trouble, but our
people have adopted a policy that they will not retaliate and will
try and stay away from the Hells Angels. They will, of course, defend
themselves if they are attacked."</TE>
<TE>   The Hells Angels refused to discuss the rivalry.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not going to say anything about that," said Guinea Collucci,
a Hells Angel from Oakland who was manning a booth. "It's media hype.
You guys want something to happen."</TE>
<TE>   The club president, George Christie, said he wasn't expecting
trouble but he wasn't telling members how to act either.</TE>
<TE>   "Hells Angels think for themselves," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The vast majority of those attending the three-day rally are
recreational bikers who resent being lumped in with what they call
the "one percenters" or troublemakers.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first started riding, the biker gangs were the majority
and now we are the majority," said Ron Mazet of Palm Springs. "If
this stuff continues, what will happen is, when you have these rides,
we'll say 'Don't call us.' "</TE>
<TE>   Others brushed off the gangs as a bad neighborhood in the biker
world that they simply avoid.</TE>
<TE>   "My thought is, you don't cave in to the Al Qaeda and you don't
cave in to these people," said Les Rush, 62, a biker from Arcadia.
"We are here to keep the flame lit. We are traditional bikers. When
we ride Harleys, it's part of our song."</TE>
<TE>   Some hope to meet a few "one percenters" and maybe turn them
around, including the Rev. Ardyss Golden of the Hollister United
Methodist Church, who each year runs a Biker Breakfast that funds
church projects.</TE>
<TE>   By 6:30 a.m. Friday, bikers were parking their hogs outside the
church, plunking down $6 for all-you-can-eat pancake breakfasts.
Serious drinking the night before had delayed some of the arrivals
until 8 or so.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd love to see the Mongols and Hells Angels lined up inside my
church," Golden said with a smile. "I think most people feel this is
sacred ground."</TE>
<TE>   She even has bikers perform Sunday services when they are in town.</TE>
<TE>   "It's awesome," she said. "Most of us have never walked on the
wild side, and we get to rub elbows with those who do. It's
exciting."</TE>

<HD>Lawsuit Accuses Bishop of Sex Abuse</HD>
<DH>Church: A former altar boy alleges molestation when the
cleric served in Huntington Park.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Roman Catholic bishop who was forced to resign as head of one
diocese by a sex scandal in 1999 was accused in a suit filed Friday
of molesting a Huntington Park altar boy during a sexual relationship
that began in 1968 and continued for nearly 20 years.</LD>
<LD>   The suit against G. Patrick Ziemann, 60, who now lives in an
Arizona monastery, claims the relationship went on until Ziemann was
named auxiliary bishop of Los Angeles in 1987. Ziemann worked under
then-Archbishop Roger M. Mahony, overseeing parishes, schools and
other church institutions in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. In
1992, the Vatican named him bishop of Santa Rosa.</LD>
<LD>   The suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, also claims that
the archdioceses of Los Angeles and San Francisco recommended to Pope
John Paul II that Ziemann be appointed bishop of Santa Rosa "in part
as a reward for his agreement to engage with them in a conspiracy to
conceal sexual abuse" within the church.</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles said the church
hadn't seen the lawsuit and could not comment in depth, but he did
say the charge that Ziemann was promoted to bishop because of
influence exerted by Cardinal Roger M. Mahony was nonsense.</TE>
<TE>   "That's absolutely not true," Todd Tamberg said. A bishop's
appointment is "a secret process [by the Vatican] that not even
Cardinal Mahony would know the specifics on."</TE>
<TE>   Tamberg said that during Ziemann's five years as Los Angeles
auxiliary bishop, Mahony's interaction with him could be described as
a "professional, working relationship."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Ziemann nor his attorney could be reached for comment late
Friday. John Manly, a Costa Mesa attorney who represents the
47-year-old plaintiff, said he wouldn't comment on the suit at this
time. The lawsuit does not name the accuser, and The Times does not
name alleged victims of sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Ziemann stepped down as Santa Rosa bishop after a priest filed a
lawsuit alleging sexual battery, forced oral copulation and abuse of
authority. Father Jorge Hume Salas claimed the bishop forced him into
a two-year sexual relationship in exchange for withholding from
police evidence of Salas' admitted theft of church collection money.</TE>
<TE>   Ziemann's lawyers said that the affair was consensual and that
Salas filed the suit after seeking a secret $8-million settlement.
The Santa Rosa diocese agreed on a $535,000 settlement payment 10
months later.</TE>
<TE>   In the latest suit, the plaintiff alleges the molestation began
while he was a sixth-grade altar boy at St. Matthias Church. The
plaintiff claims he was abused when he was forced to take a shower
with Ziemann after playing basketball.</TE>
<TE>   At 17, the plaintiff alleges, Ziemann began paying him for various
sexual acts, and he continued the relationship after being named
spiritual director of the now-closed Queen of Angels Seminary in San
Fernando Valley in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   Manly, who filed the current suit with attorney Kelly Clark of
Portland, Ore., was co-counsel in a record $5.2-million payout by the
Los Angeles and Orange dioceses to settle molestation claims against
Msgr. Michael Harris. In that suit, the victim alleged that during
Ziemann's days as a priest in Los Angeles, he had been told about
similar complaints against Harris by another victim, but did nothing.
Ziemann had been Harris' spiritual advisor at St. John's Seminary in
Camarillo. Since leaving Santa Rosa, Ziemann, who remains a bishop,
has lived at the Holy Trinity Monastery and Holy Family Convent in
St. David, Ariz.</TE>

<LD>A 9-year-old boy critically wounded in Buena Park during a July 4
fireworks display died Friday of a single gunshot wound, officials
said.</LD>
<LD>   Xavier Morales of Anaheim was at Boisseranc Park on Dale Street
with an older brother for a neighborhood celebration when he was hit
once in the chest by a bullet from a small-caliber handgun, said Sgt.
Richard Forsyth, a detective in the Buena Park Police Department.</LD>
<LD>   The boy collapsed shortly after telling his 17-year-old brother
that he wasn't feeling well. Police said the teenager did not realize
Xavier had been shot because there was little bleeding from the
wound, and at the time there was a barrage of bottle rockets and
other noisy fireworks.</LD>
<TE>   The park is a popular spot for families to congregate for picnics
and to set off their own fireworks, officials said. The gathering was
not sponsored by the city.</TE>
<TE>   Police had first investigated whether the child had been struck by
a bullet or by a projectile from errant fireworks. But an autopsy
Friday indicated that he died from a gunshot that punctured a lung
and severed his aorta.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of people were in the park when the boy was struck, so
police were still trying to determine late Friday where the shot came
from. They speculated that the bullet might have been from a gun that
was fired into the air.</TE>
<TE>   "The gunshot could have come from a mile away or even from another
city," Forsyth said. The child "was at the wrong place at the wrong
time when he was struck."</TE>
<TE>   Relatives expressed shock and grief Friday after learning that the
boy had died at UCI Medical Center in Orange.</TE>
<TE>   An aunt, Sulema Borjon, 27, said, "We're all just devastated. This
just was not expected."</TE>
<TE>   She was scrambling to help Xavier's family make funeral
arrangements. "We are low-budgeted, but I think I finally found a
place," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She described her nephew as a quiet child who made good grades at
Sunkist Elementary School in Anaheim, where he would have been in
fifth grade this fall.</TE>
<TE>   Suzi Brown, a spokeswoman for the Anaheim City School District,
said of the incident, "It's heartbreaking. Any time a child dies it's
heartbreaking, particularly under this type of circumstance. Our
thoughts and prayers are with Xavier's family."</TE>

<LD>Authorities early Friday recovered the body of a woman who drowned in
the California Aqueduct in this small Antelope Valley community west
of Lancaster, sheriff's officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The woman, whose name was not released, went for a swim about 10
p.m. Thursday in the aqueduct and apparently got caught in an
undercurrent, said Sheriff's Lt. Larry Gump.</LD>
<LD>   A male companion, who did not enter the aqueduct, called
authorities. The body was retrieved just after midnight by Los
Angeles County Fire Department personnel, who tried to resuscitate
her.</LD>

<HD>Many Clergy Feel Overwhelmed in the Wake of 9/11</HD>
<DH>Mental health: Church leaders say they had to deal with
their own emotions before they could help others. Some say they're
near 'compassion fatigue.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>RELIGION NEWS SERVICE</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Everyone knows what it's like to have a fair-weather friend.
Everyone, that is, except religious leaders. When skies turn
cloudy--be it a divorce, sickness or unemployment--the clergy are all
too familiar with seeing unfamiliar faces.</LD>
<LD>   In the aftermath of 9/11, however, many of America's spiritual
caregivers admit to feeling overwhelmed. Some even say they are close
to succumbing to "compassion fatigue."</LD>
<LD>   To address the problem, nearly 800 clergy filled a Manhattan hotel
ballroom recently for a one-day seminar, "The Lifecycle of a
Disaster: Rituals and Practice." Sponsored by the American Red Cross,
the seminar was organized to consider how the 9/11 terrorist attacks
have affected religious congregations and to lay a groundwork for
handling national disasters that may lie ahead.</LD>
<TE>   Caught Unprepared</TE>
<TE>   Many of the seminar's participants said they felt unprepared to be
the "first line of defense" against terror caused by the destruction
of the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all finding our way, after being blindsided by this," said
Thomas Craig, chaplain and director of pastoral care at St. Barnabas
Medical Center in Livingstone, N.J. "I was numbed and angered by my
own emotions. I had to learn to put them aside to hear others."</TE>
<TE>   Many said they struggle to offer hope at a time when the
government says more terrorist attacks are inevitable. "We've seen a
tremendous increase of clients. Yet, how can I talk to people and say
it will be OK, you're safe, when I don't know that's the case?" asked
Anna Olsen of the North Jersey Centers for Spiritual and Mental
Health in Randolph, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Tough Follow-Up</TE>
<TE>   "The following months are usually the hardest times in the life
cycle of a disaster," said Rabbi Stephen Roberts, chairman of
Disaster Spiritual Care Services of the American Red Cross in Greater
New York.</TE>
<TE>   This may be especially true, he said, for those who didn't lose a
family member or loved one, but "fled for their lives that day, or
were in lower Manhattan and experienced the sound, sight and smell of
so many souls being lost."</TE>
<TE>   In attempting to provide guidance for the future, parallels were
drawn to the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building bombing in Oklahoma
City on April 19, 1995, what was, until 9/11, America's worst
terrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   Among those addressing the seminar were Brad Yarbrough of Oklahoma
City, clergy coordinator; and Dr. John Tassey, chairman of the
American Psychological Assn.'s task force on the Oklahoma City
bombing.</TE>
<TE>   There are lessons to be learned from the Oklahoma City bombing
about the stages survivors go through, Tassey said.</TE>
<TE>   First is the "heroic" stage, when immediate problems resulting
from a disaster are handled.</TE>
<TE>   Next is a "honeymoon," when a strong sense of community makes it
easier to tolerate inconveniences.</TE>
<TE>   Tassey said he feels New Yorkers and America may be emerging from
the third, or "disillusionment" phase, when the community seems
fragmented. Finally, there is "reconstruction," when the community
and nation begin to redefine themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The Hardest Stage</TE>
<TE>   This transition between the fragmentation and reconstruction
stages is the most difficult, Tassey said, because "responders and
caregivers are leaving the scene just when the community is most
irritable."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, two recently released surveys cited during the seminar
corroborated this theory.</TE>
<TE>   The New England Journal of Medicine estimates there are 67,000
people with post-traumatic stress disorder living south of 110th
Street in New York, and another 90,000 suffering from depression as a
result of 9/11.</TE>
<TE>   And, according to the American Journal of Epidemiology, there has
been a 28% increase in alcohol and drug use among the same
population.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers are not surprising because of the unprecedented scope
of the World Trade Center attack, said Terry Becker, manager of
pastoral care at University of Chicago Hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   "We caregivers talk about the concept of 'limit experience,' by
which we mean a smack against the limit of what we have control
over," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "What we've learned in the past is both relevant and irrelevant,
because we are accustomed to speaking of individual or family trauma,
but not community or national trauma."</TE>
<TE>   Clergy may be unusually at risk of trauma themselves, said
Yarbrough, because "ministers have a rescuer's mentality, and tend to
exhaust themselves trying to help others."</TE>
<TE>   One way to prevent that from happening, he said, was by being
aware of one's limitations.</TE>
<TE>   Though he was at the Murrah building for days back in 1995,
Yarbrough admitted, "I couldn't give death notifications to surviving
family members--I'm much too emotional."</TE>

<HD>Calabasas Voters to Decide on Utility Tax</HD>
<DH>Revenue: The 5% levy, charged since 1991, is put on the
March ballot after residents petition City Council for a review.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANUEL GAMIZ JR.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Calabasas residents will vote in March on whether to keep a utility
tax that annually raises about $2.5 million in revenue for the city.</LD>
<LD>   About 500 residents signed a petition to have the tax reviewed by
the City Council, which voted unanimously Wednesday to place the
issue on the ballot for the next municipal election, said Robin
Parker, assistant city manager and clerk.</LD>
<LD>   Calabasas residents have paid the 5% tax on gas, electricity and
telephone use since the city incorporated in 1991.</LD>
<TE>   Officials said that losing the tax revenue could affect some city
services, primarily parks and recreation, public safety and road
repairs.</TE>
<TE>   Karmen Brower, a 35-year resident of the area and one of the
organizers of the petition drive, said officials would have to learn
to be more fiscally responsible with the city's general fund budget,
currently about $17.8 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   She said the city should find ways to replace the money and added
that residents should be more involved in the city's decision-making.</TE>
<TE>   "People have the perception that everyone in Calabasas is rich,"

<HD>Bay Area Chase Causes Shutdown of 8 Miles of U.S. 101 for 4
Hours</HD>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>A man who police believe is mentally ill was captured Friday after
leading officers on a high-speed chase across the Bay Area and, once
stopped, dousing himself and the car he was driving with gasoline.</LD>
<LD>   The incident in the morning rush hour closed an eight-mile stretch
of southbound U.S. Highway 101 south of San Francisco for four hours,
but authorities said the backup was reduced because traffic was
relatively light on the long Fourth of July holiday weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities identified the man as Robert B. Sidicane, 41, of
Nashville. He was booked at San Mateo County jail, accused of
reckless driving, felony evading arrest and resisting arrest.</LD>
<TE>   Police said the motorist had fled about 5:30 a.m. from California
Highway Patrol officers who had stopped to assist him by the roadside
along Highway 580 in suburban Livermore.</TE>
<TE>   "When we had him in custody, he was asked why he didn't stop,"
said Officer Christian Oliver, a CHP spokesman in Redwood City. "He
told officers: 'I had more important things to do.'</TE>
<TE>   "His mental condition is being assessed," Oliver said.</TE>
<TE>   Reaching speeds of 100 mph, police chased the red Oldsmobile for
40 miles as the driver darted through traffic on the Bay Bridge and
south on U.S. 101 between San Francisco and San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the car's four tires were blown out by a spike strip, but
the man drove on the rims for another eight miles before finally
coming to a halt.</TE>
<TE>   Officers ended the standoff after four hours by spraying the car
with firefighting foam after seeing Sidicane douse himself with fluid
from a red container.</TE>
<TE>   "We did an inventory of the car and found five one-gallon
containers of gasoline," Oliver said.</TE>
<TE>   The incident caused the Bay Area's second tie-up this week in
during a morning rush hour.</TE>
<TE>   Police on Wednesday shot a man who they say had killed a woman and
then kidnapped his estranged wife and held her at gunpoint on a
freeway overpass near the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.</TE>
<TE>   That standoff forced officials to close all but one of the
bridge's westbound lanes.</TE>

<HD>A Timely Look at a Rare Era of Relative Peace Among 3
Religions</HD>
<DH>THE ORNAMENT OF THE WORLD: How Muslims, Jews and Christians
Created a Culture of Tolerance in Medieval Spain; By Maria Rosa
Menocal; Little, Brown: 316 pages, $26.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN KIRSCH</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Kirsch, a contributing writer to the Book
Review, is the author of, most recently, "The Woman Who Laughed at
God: The Untold History of the Jewish People."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The rich and remarkable landscape that we behold in "The Ornament of
the World" dates all the way back to the so-called Dark Ages, but the
book itself could not be more timely or more encouraging. Maria Rosa
Menocal, a Yale professor, shows us a rare moment in history when
Muslims, Christians and Jews found a way to live with each other in
peace and prosperity.</LD>
<LD>   The tale begins with a man on the run: Abd al-Rahman was a prince
of the family known as the Umayyads, and a survivor of the massacre
carried out by their rivals for power in the Islamic world, the
Abbasids.</LD>
<LD>   He fled all the way from Syria to what is called al-Andalus in
Arabic, the place we know as Spain, in 755, and he presided over the
first stirrings of an Islamic civilization that flowered in the soil
of Europe.</LD>
<TE>   "Beginning with the narrative of that intrepid young man who
miraculously evaded the annihilation of his line and migrated from
Damascus to Cordoba, which he then made over into his new homeland,
we end up with an altogether different vision of the fundamental
parameters of Europe during the Middle Ages," insists Menocal. "This
is a vision still evident today, in the lasting influence of this
complex, rich and unique civilization."</TE>
<TE>   Menocal, a professor of Spanish and Portuguese, is attuned to
aspects of history that many professional historians tend to
overlook. She pauses to quote Al-Rahman;</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A palm tree stands in the middle</TE>
<TE>   of Rusafa,</TE>
<TE>   Born in the West, far from the</TE>
<TE>   land of palms.</TE>
<TE>   I said to it: How like me you are,</TE>
<TE>   far away and in exile....</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ... and then she points out that love of language in general and
poetry in particular is essential to understanding what we might well
call, a la Thomas Cahill's bestseller about the Jewish people, "The
Gifts of the Muslims."</TE>
<TE>   "Perhaps nothing is more central to understanding the inherent
complexity of medieval culture than the basic relationship between
Arabic, as a language with a powerful pre-Islamic poetic tradition,
and the Islamic order that springs from the same place," she
explains. "This is the moment in which the distinctive taste for a
complex notion of identity that allows (or, more likely, encourages)
contradictions is born."</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of Menocal's illuminating and even inspiring work is
a notion that may seem profoundly contradictory at our benighted
moment in history. A "century of Umayyad rule had spectacularly
improved the Jews' everyday lives and social status," she writes. A
"community not long before reduced to squalor and slavery was
upwardly mobile now, halfway toward the day when a Jew would be the
grand vizier of an Umayyad caliph."</TE>
<TE>   Christians were not so comfortable: "The Jews' often loving
relationship with Arabic culture contrasted from the outset with the
attitude of the hierarchy and leadership of the Christian community,"
which saw itself enduring "unbearable cultural oppression."</TE>
<TE>   Nor was the era free from violence and oppression--Menocal does
not withhold the details of massacres and martyrdoms, exiles and
exclusions, that afflicted both Christians and Jews during the
"Golden Age" of Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Still, even the Christian community was enriched by Islamic
civilization, as Menocal points out.</TE>
<TE>   She takes us to a hilltop church in Toledo that dates back to the
11th century, and she shows us how the architecture and decor of the
Christian sanctuary resembles "those of the Great Mosque [of Cordoba]
... that was the spiritual center of the Umayyad caliphate,"
including elaborate inscriptions in a kind of ersatz Arabic.</TE>
<TE>   "In this sacred place," she says, "Christians of the 12th
century--who were supposedly engaged in unrelenting religious warfare
against the Muslims--paid an unambiguous tribute to the culture of
the enemy, and created a space in which to pray that surrounded them
with visions of their remarkable intimacies."</TE>
<TE>   The era that Menocal celebrates came to a final and tragic end in
1492, when King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella expelled the Jews from a
"reconquered" Spain and criminalized the practice of Islam, a moment
that marked "the true end of the Middle Ages," as Menocal puts it,
and "the end of hundreds of years of open Islamic and Jewish
participation in medieval European culture."</TE>
<TE>   Still Menocal ends her book on an encouraging note. She wonders
aloud what would have happened if Ferdinand and Isabella had
possessed "the courage to cultivate a society that can live with its
own flagrant contradictions." And, by showing us what was lost, she
reminds us of what might be.</TE>

<HD>Oxnard Unveils Plans for College Park</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELENA GAONA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dog owners would get two parks, and a women's recovery center would
get the boot under a $15-million proposed makeover unveiled this week
for College Park in Oxnard.</LD>
<LD>   During a four-hour meeting, city officials discussed relocating
the Rainbow Recovery Center and several possible funding sources for
the park project.</LD>
<LD>   Controversy is still swirling over what to do about the recovery
center, which has been at the park for 17 years.</LD>
<TE>   When the county transferred ownership of the park to the city in
2000, the deed stated that the 75-acre property could only be used
for "parks and recreation purposes," officials said.</TE>
<TE>   City Manager Ed Sotelo and several council members on Tuesday
suggested finding another site for the center. But Mayor Manuel Lopez
asked city staff to meet with county officials to see if the deed
restrictions are flexible enough that the recovery center can be kept
at College Park.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe the city has a big enough heart to accommodate the
Rainbow House and the museum," Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   A Rainbow representative said the community supports keeping the
recovery center where it is. She said the center has received many
favorable letters from residents in the past two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "South Oxnard wants us to stay here," said Kathleen McQuillan,
executive director of the Rainbow Recovery Center. "It's their
neighborhood, so they should have a say in it." McQuillan suggested
that the center was not included in the city's plan because it does
not have the political clout of the Ventura County Museum of History
and Art, which under the city's plan would occupy the two old
farmhouses now used by the recovery center.</TE>
<TE>   "The museum has a lot of wealthy, powerful people on their board,"
McQuillan said. "We're a local, bare nonprofit organization
struggling to keep our doors open."</TE>
<TE>   The city's improvement plan calls for development of a nine-acre
dog park and a three-acre park, baseball and soccer fields, a lighted
basketball area, a fenced skate park and a 26,000-square-foot
community center with a gym.</TE>
<TE>   The park would also include picnic areas, playgrounds, jogging and
bicycle trails and a farm heritage area.</TE>
<TE>   One of the farmhouses used by the recovery center would be
converted into a farm museum dedicated to the county's agricultural
history. It's not clear, however, how the other farmhouse would be
used.</TE>
<TE>   City officials stressed that the plan is just a draft, and that
they are still exploring ways to pay for the park improvements. "All
we have now are drawings," City Atty. Gary Gillig said. "We still
have to pay for all of this."</TE>
<TE>   The City Council's staff on Tuesday recommended the formation of
an assessment district to pay for the improvements. Under the plan,
homeowners would be assessed about $28 a year, which would raise
about $1.2 million annually.</TE>
<TE>   The new park could be developed over 12 years, or sooner if bonds
are sold as part of the financing package, said financial services
manager Mike More. One other financing option would be for the city
to tap into a $2.6-billion state bond measure approved earlier this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Dog owners in search of a place to exercise their pets were among
dozens of residents who spoke out about the park plan at the council
meeting. They had requested one dog area but received two.</TE>
<TE>   "The city has made an honest effort," said resident Chuck Wright,
pointing out that there are 15,000 dogs in Oxnard. "You can't please
everyone. But the dog park people are happy because we have nothing
[now]."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the council directed its staff to come back with more
detailed plans for the farm heritage museum area. In addition to a
museum, the area would include a caretaker's house, a blacksmith's
shop and a barn, gardens, crop displays and shops.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard officials expect to hold another study session on the
proposed College Park master plan this fall.</TE>

<HD>Viewing Islam From Viewpoint of Baptist Converts</HD>
<DH>Book: Brothers draw criticism from Muslim scholars for
attacking Muhammad as a pedophile but they stand by their
interpretation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>YONAT SHIMRON</AU>
<BD>RELIGION NEWS SERVICE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the Rev. Jerry Vines got up in front of a sea of Southern
Baptist pastors last month and described the Prophet Muhammad as a
"demon-possessed pedophile," many people thought it was an
ill-informed slip of the tongue.</LD>
<LD>   Ergun and Emir Caner, the authors of a new book on Islam, knew it
was not. The two brothers, Muslim converts to Christianity, had been
working hard to win over leaders of the Southern Baptist
Convention--including former Southern Baptist Convention President
Vines--to their views about Islam.</LD>
<LD>   Now Vines' remarks have given their work a nationwide audience.
It's no surprise that after the media broke the story, the brothers
were available to back up Vines' comments at a quickly arranged news
conference in St. Louis' America's Center, where Baptists held their
annual meeting.</LD>
<TE>   These days, the brothers, who are 31 and 35, have been booked
solid for church appearances and are making the rounds among
Christian radio and TV outlets. They are touting their book,
"Unveiling Islam: An Insider's Look at Muslim Life and Beliefs," and
are trying to convince 16 million Southern Baptists who make up the
country's largest Protestant denomination that their worst fears
about Islam and its founder are true.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to give an open, honest assessment of Islam, which we
didn't see in the mainstream media," said Emir Caner, a professor of
church history and Anabaptist studies at Southeastern Baptist
Theological Seminary in Wake Forest, N.C. That assessment, the
brothers say, leads to two conclusions: Islam is violent, and its
prophet was an unscrupulous warmonger.</TE>
<TE>   In their book, the Caners emphasize Muhammad's third marriage to
Aisha, a 6-year-old girl. It is said the prophet had sex with her
when she was 9. They also question Muhammad's initial bewilderment at
God's revelations, which he once compared in their intensity to demon
possession.</TE>
<TE>   The Caners' book has sold 30,000 copies since March, according to
Kregel, a Christian book publishing firm in Grand Rapids, Mich. The
paperback features a glowing foreword by Richard Land, president of
the Southern Baptists' Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission. It
also carries praise from other Southern Baptist leaders, including
Paige Patterson, president of the Southeastern seminary, who wrote a
blurb saying the book provided him with "the most enlightening
insights into the world of Islam that I have read anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Muslims have been equally vocal about the book and Vines' comment,
calling it bigoted, hate-filled and medieval. To Muslims, Muhammad
represents the highest standards of ethics and morals.</TE>
<TE>   "It feeds into a cycle of Islamophobia," said Ebrahim Moosa, a
professor of Islamic studies at Duke University. "The more you trash
Islam, the more it sells."</TE>
<TE>   Vines' statement has also been criticized by the Interfaith
Alliance, the National Council of Churches and the Anti-Defamation
League. President Bush, who spoke by satellite to Southern Baptists
on the opening day of their meeting in St. Louis, was unaware of
Vines' comment, White House spokesman Scott McClellan said, adding:
"The president believes Islam is a religion that teaches peace."</TE>
<TE>   The Caners are convinced otherwise. As boys growing up in Ohio,
the two converted to Christianity after being invited to a Baptist
church in their neighborhood when they were teenagers. Their
conversion cost them the love of their father, who disowned them for
more than a decade.</TE>
<TE>   Emir Caner said the break came at dinner one day when he was 12
years old. "I told him I could not pray to Allah anymore. I found
Jesus Christ as my savior," Caner recalled. "He said, 'You either
choose between me or your religion.' "</TE>
<TE>   Acar Mehmet Caner reconciled with his sons before he died in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers attended Criswell College, where they met Patterson,
a man they refer to as a surrogate father. They followed him to
Southeastern seminary, where they earned master's degrees. After the
Sept. 11 attacks, Patterson encouraged them to write the book, and he
read the draft before it went to the publisher.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that because of the fact that our government, for
necessary reasons, has had to go lightly on Islam, the American
people need to know who the prophet is and what is recorded in the
Koran and Hadith," Patterson said.</TE>
<TE>   The Caners believe that to convert a Muslim, Christians must know
what Muslims believe.</TE>
<TE>   "We maintain Muslims must be confronted with the character and
claims of Muhammad," said Emir Caner. "If he was an excellent
example, perhaps he should be followed. But if he is a man who slept
with a 9-year-old girl, which in any culture is wrong, perhaps he
isn't to be followed."</TE>
<TE>   Islamic scholars say that although no Muslim would sanction the
practice today, it was not unusual in the Middle East of the 7th
century for men to marry girls. The practice still exists in parts of
Africa.</TE>
<TE>   They say an early betrothal is different from pedophilia, which is
a pathological deviancy.</TE>
<TE>   "Many Christians have never been able to get over the fact that
Muhammad was a lover and a great husband and father," said Carl W.
Ernst, a professor of religion at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill and an expert in Islam.</TE>
<TE>   Ernst said attempts to discredit Muhammad date to the 18th
century, when missionaries and Asian scholars, known as Orientalists,
turned every Muslim virtue into a vice.</TE>
<TE>   He and other scholars say picking faults with any religious
tradition can quickly get ugly. What about Moses, who killed another
man; David, who committed adultery; or the Apostle Paul, who accepted
slavery as a natural part of the social order?</TE>
<TE>   "All our religions are tainted," said Bill Leonard, dean of the
divinity school at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem and an
expert in Baptist church history. "We have to wear our claims with
great humility."</TE>
<TE>   The Caners reject that argument. They say they wrote the book to
remind Baptists that all religions are not equal and that
Christianity is the one true faith.</TE>
<TE>   "My goal is to reach 1.3 billion Muslims with the Gospel of Jesus
Christ," said Emir Caner. "Even if only one Muslim converts, it's
worth it."</TE>

<HD>D.A.s Struggle on Ethics Tightrope</HD>
<DH>Politics: Blurred lines between election funds and criminal
cases have led to conflict charges.</DH>

<LD>The grand jury that investigated Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony
Rackauckas expressed alarm at his personal intervention in criminal
cases involving campaign contributors.</LD>
<LD>   But around California, other district attorneys have faced similar
accusations of mixing politics and justice. To some lawyers and
judges, the accusations against Rackauckas point up the contradiction
inherent in the job: a district attorney is part politician, part
officer of the court.</LD>
<LD>   District attorneys are expected to be objective arbiters of
justice even as they raise thousands of dollars from the attorneys,
judges and big businesses they deal with in court.</LD>
<TE>   They are guided by their own judgment about how to handle these
possible conflicts of interest because state law does not address how
prosecutors should react when they confront campaign contributors in
the courtroom. A code of ethics published by the state prosecutors
association speaks of avoiding potential conflicts but does not
provide guidance on dealing with political contributors.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas' alleged intervention in cases involving domestic
violence, burglary and consumer fraud was criticized in a grand jury
report and prompted calls for further investigation by the Orange
County Board of Supervisors. But Rackauckas is far from alone.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, former Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti was plagued by
accusations that he used his office to help political allies. During
his losing 2000 reelection campaign, he was criticized for mounting a
crackdown on trademark infringement that benefited a clothing
manufacturer who contributed $200,000 to his campaign, and for
alleged lenient treatment of an arsonist whose grandfather was a
longtime political backer.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego District Atty. Paul Pfingst is locked in a reelection
campaign in which fund-raising is an issue. One criticism: He took a
$5,500 contribution from an Encinitas stock speculator who was later
indicted on federal charges. Pfingst eventually gave the money to a
victims' rights group.</TE>
<TE>   Pfingst, recently elected president of the California District
Attorneys Assn., said such entanglements are hard to avoid.</TE>
<TE>   "I see no answer except for these candidates not to take campaign
contributions at all," he said. "And then you'd be criticized for not
being a serious candidate because nobody supports you."</TE>
<TE>   Some legal scholars and activists believe the Orange County
controversy shows that district attorneys must be more vigilant about
avoiding the appearance of favoritism, even if that means taking a
hands-off policy on cases involving political contributors.</TE>
<TE>   "While I understand that the temptations are there in a system of
elections, it doesn't excuse the abuses," said Erwin Chemerinsky, a
USC law professor. "We, as voters, have every right to believe that
... we can expect our district attorney to avoid the appearance of
impropriety."</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas accepted donations from 270 judges, prosecutors, public
defenders and private lawyers during his 1998 campaign. Today, it's
difficult for him to consider any case without encountering a donor.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas accepted more than $100,000 in political donations from
private attorneys in 1998--roughly 40% of his war chest. An
additional $5,000 came from judges and deputy prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   One of his contributors, attorney Allan H. Stokke, hosted a 1998
fund-raising event that generated more than $30,000 for Rackauckas,
according to the grand jury report.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, Stokke was hired to represent an apartment
company that was the subject of a consumer-protection lawsuit filed
by some of Rackauckas' deputy prosecutors. Rackauckas ordered his
deputies to withdraw the lawsuit and took them off the case.
Rackauckas then negotiated the case with Stokke, whose client had
also contributed to the district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   After his involvement became public, Rackauckas withdrew from the
case and asked the state attorney general to take over negotiations.
Rackauckas maintains that neither Stokke nor the company received
favorable treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Another Rackauckas contributor, attorney Ronald Brower, gave
$2,000 to the district attorney's 1998 and 2002 campaigns and
solicited contributions from other attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Brower met with Rackauckas to discuss an auto-burglary
case involving a 19-year-old client who was a student at a military
academy. If convicted of any of the 16 felonies he faced, the student
would have been expelled from the academy, Brower said.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas asked his top assistant to take over negotiations in
the case. Ultimately, the student was allowed to plead guilty to a
single misdemeanor, and the 16 charges were dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas said his role in the case was minor and the outcome was
fair. Brower maintains his contribution didn't give him special
access, noting he also met with the two elected district attorneys
who preceded Rackauckas.</TE>
<TE>   "One view is the system might be compromised, but lawyers--just
like everybody else--are interested in the integrity of the criminal
justice system, even more so," Brower said. "We practice in the
system every day."</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas said he did make an error in his handling of a 2000
domestic-violence case that involved a friend and campaign
contributor.</TE>
<TE>   After the friend, not identified by the grand jury, introduced
Rackauckas to the assault victim, who recanted the accusation,
Rackauckas said he would dismiss the case if the defendant attended
anger-management counseling. A deputy prosecutor had been seeking a
sentence of 60 days in jail. A judge on the case had suggested 30
days.</TE>
<TE>   In a prepared statement, Rackauckas noted he erred by failing to
tell the deputy prosecutor about the settlement he privately
negotiated. Instead, the prosecutor learned about Rackauckas'
recommendation from the political contributor at the next court
appearance.</TE>
<TE>   It was a group of deputy prosecutors in the Orange County district
attorney's office who asked for an independent investigation into
Rackauckas' actions and attracted the grand jury's attention.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas insists the criticism was the work of disgruntled
employees, unhappy about personnel changes he made. Most prosecutors
are protected by civil-services rules and have the freedom to speak
out without fear of losing their jobs. However, Rackauckas fired one
critic and transferred several others to a new state agency dealing
with family support.</TE>
<TE>   Garcetti, the former Los Angeles district attorney, faced a
similar uprising in 1995 after his office struck a plea bargain in an
arson case involving the grandson of a major Garcetti contributor.
The deal allowed the defendant to receive a 16-month sentence for
attempted vandalism--far less time than he would have gotten if he
was prosecuted for attempted arson, the crime for which he had been
arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Cooley, then a prosecutor in the office, sought an
investigation by the attorney general's office. Officials didn't take
any action against Garcetti, who insisted he did nothing wrong.
Cooley went on to unseat his boss five years later.</TE>
<TE>   An ethics manual produced by the California District Attorneys
Assn. warns against working on cases that involve close friends,
relatives or political opponents.</TE>
<TE>   But there are few legal or ethical rules on how district attorneys
should handle cases that involve campaign contributors. Rather, the
law leaves it up to district attorneys to judge whether a
contributor's involvement raises an appearance of impropriety.</TE>
<TE>   "What the prosecutor has to ask is, 'Can I fairly make this
decision notwithstanding the fact that this person has made a
contribution to me?' " said Kevin Edward Mohr, professor of law at
Western State University in Fullerton and vice chairman of the
California State Bar's committee for professional responsibility and
conduct.</TE>
<TE>   Withdrawing from all cases involving contributors would be
difficult, because many district attorneys rely heavily on campaign
donations from attorneys and judges in the courthouse. But Mohr and
others said district attorneys should avoid personal involvement in
such cases.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy to do," said H. Richard Uviller, a law professor at
Columbia University in New York who specializes in prosecutorial
ethics. "You just say to your prosecutor, 'I don't want to hear about
that case. If you want advice, ask my deputy.' To do the opposite--to
take over the case and to actually offer a better deal than the judge
approved--is so blatant, it's really shocking."</TE>

<HD>4 Families' Outings Lead to a Tragedy</HD>
<DH>Crash: Engine problems are suspected in the San Dimas
accident, which killed two men in the plane and two children on the
ground.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON, ANTHONY McCARTNEY and NANCY WRIDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From the sky came the enveloping roar, survivors said Friday. From
the pine-trimmed picnic tables, they saw disaster coming.</LD>
<LD>   Army Reserve helicopter pilot and real estate agent Michael Brand
had radioed three maydays after takeoff. He was struggling to keep
his Cessna airborne. It was also carrying Michael Adler, a friend and
plumbing contractor.</LD>
<LD>   At the park below, 17,000 people had gathered by noon on the
Fourth of July. The just arrived Ngo-Ton family had planted fishing
rods in the bank of Puddingstone Reservoir and unpacked the barbecue
at a shoreline site.</LD>
<TE>   Jackie Ngo-Ton, 12, eagerly awaiting the start of her first
cheerleading camp in a few days, held Brendan Truong, the
16-month-old son of family friends.</TE>
<TE>   Then the plane fell from the sky, showering the crowd with debris.
Bystanders would lift the wing off Jackie and the toddler, who were
killed, as were the two men in the plane.</TE>
<TE>   In that instant, the lives of four Southern California
families--plus those of 12 people who were injured--were indelibly
linked.</TE>
<TE>   Some tweaks of fate and it might have ended differently for the
immigrant families: Jackie had almost gone shopping with her mother
that day. And the Ngo-Ton and Truong parents might have been killed
too, had they not been moving a smoking barbecue away from a windy
shoreside spot, where their children were playing.</TE>
<TE>   As the fathers of the two dead children prepared to bury them in
graves side by side, investigators examined the wreckage and sought
to reconstruct what had led to the crash at the lip of the reservoir,
which anchors the Frank G. Bonelli Regional County Park in San Dimas.</TE>
<TE>   The day had begun with the promise of fun and a sunny holiday.</TE>
<TE>   A tall flagpole stands in front of Michael Brand's house in
Glendora, and the American flag was raised in honor of the nation's
birthday. A neighbor across the street raised a flag as well.</TE>
<TE>   Brand, 44, a father of three, was cheerful and helpful, the kind
who "makes it a good neighborhood," said the neighbor, Jeff Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Wise, another neighbor who described himself as one of
Brand's best friends, said Brand had been like a magician, always
able to pull something out of the hat to help a friend.</TE>
<TE>   After Smith bought a chocolate Labrador, Brand showed up at his
house with a book on raising that breed of dog.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you need anything," Smith said, "he's there for you."</TE>
<TE>   About 10 a.m. Thursday, Brand left his home for Brackett Field in
La Verne. A little earlier, he had called and invited Alder to join
him.</TE>
<TE>   The veteran pilot, who flew helicopters and planes alike, only
three months earlier had acquired a Cessna 310, a popular twin-engine
prop plane that seats five.</TE>
<TE>   He planned to pick up his wife, Deborah, later in the day, so they
could watch fireworks from the sky.</TE>
<TE>   Alder, 49, who lived with his wife, Cindy, and their four children
in Glendora, was active in the Mormon Church, a neighbor said. His
father, Reed Alder, had been a prominent doctor before recently
retiring his San Dimas practice, and Alder owned a plumbing business.</TE>
<TE>   According to Federal Aviation Administration records, Alder had a
pilot's license, though his certified him to fly only single-engine
planes.</TE>
<TE>   About a month ago, Cindy Alder said Friday, the same plane had
given her husband and Brand a scare.</TE>
<TE>   The landing gear failed to work as they were about to touch down.
After a few tries, the gear eventually deployed, and Alder said a
technician thoroughly checked the plane afterward for other problems.</TE>
<TE>   Cindy Alder said Brand, with whom she worked at Century 21, was a
good pilot.</TE>
<TE>   "We had full confidence in his flying," she said, adding that she
believed Brand would have done "everything possible" to prevent the
tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   While Brand and Alder were at the airfield, 18 people from four
families, including the Truongs of El Monte and Ngo-Tons of La
Mirada, gathered for their Fourth of July picnic at Bonelli Park,
about a mile away.</TE>
<TE>   Normally, Kelvin Truong opens his Los Angeles furniture store
every day, including July 4. His family usually celebrates at home,
setting off fireworks at night.</TE>
<TE>   This year, he said, he decided to shutter the shop, accepting a
friend's invitation to take his wife and two sons to the park. The
families specifically went because of the options--swimming, fishing
and rides--that their children would have for play, Truong said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he had decided to go because Brendan was curious and
active and liked the outdoors.</TE>
<TE>   They planned to go for just a few hours, Truong said. About 4
p.m., they planned to head home for their traditional holiday
fireworks.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the Truongs was the Ngo-Tran family. Carol Ngo,
Jackie's mother, offered to take the girl shopping. But Jackie, who
was known as a cutup who loved to laugh and make jokes, wanted to go
to the picnic with her father's friends from work. Her father, Nghlem
Ngo-Ton, worked for Kelvin Truong.</TE>
<TE>   The Ngo-Ton and Truong families had been at the park barely 30
minutes when other park visitors noticed a plane coming from the
east.</TE>
<TE>   Brand's plane had lifted off the airport runway about 12:30 p.m.
But, as investigators would say a day later, it wasn't gaining
altitude fast enough before it began a gradual descent.</TE>
<TE>   "That plane is too low and it's coming in," said one park visitor,
Rosa Franco.</TE>
<TE>   Two hundred yards offshore, lifeguards Jeff Jones and Alan Taylor
saw the Cessna as well. They told colleagues later that they had the
same thoughts: That plane is too low.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Ragogna, an investigator with the National Transportation
Safety Board, said Friday that, contrary to earlier reports, Brand
had not described trouble but had said "mayday" three consecutive
times.</TE>
<TE>   The plane gently banked left--as the pilot wanted, Ragogna said,
as it headed along the eastern shore of the reservoir.</TE>
<TE>   Then it clipped the top of a 30-foot tree, careened left and hit a
second tree, which tore off the right engine, Ragogna said.</TE>
<TE>   The plane then broke apart, and debris cascaded from it.</TE>
<TE>   Kelvin Truong said he rushed to find his children. He discovered
8-year-old Raymond unhurt.</TE>
<TE>   As people rushed to help the injured, rescuers lifted one of the
plane's wings. Beneath it they found Jackie, clutching Brendan.
Raymond ran to his brother.</TE>
<TE>   "Wake up, don't sleep, wake up," Truong remembered Raymond telling
Brendan.</TE>
<TE>   Within seconds of the crash, lifeguards Jones and Taylor began
pulling the three children from beneath the wreckage.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor quashed the flames of a barbecue struck by debris, fearing
an explosion, said Steve Evans, the lake lifeguard supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the pilots was in full [cardiac] arrest," Evans said.</TE>
<TE>   "There were bodies everywhere," said Officer Eddie Ontiveros of
the Los Angeles County Police, which patrols parks and other county
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   He arrived minutes after the crash and, with a deep understanding
of the despairing fathers' pain, Ontiveros embraced one of them.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing I could do was to hold him," Ontiveros said. "A
cop's not supposed to do that. I know what it's like to lose a child.
I lost a 17-year-old daughter. But he lost a baby."</TE>
<TE>   Four would die--Jackie, Brendan, Brand and Alder. Twelve others
were injured and three--Andy Ngo-Ton, 8; Connie Kang, 15; and Duk
Song Kang, 52--remained hospitalized Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Failure of at least one of the Cessna 310's twin engines may have
contributed to the crash, but a cause has not been determined,
Ragogna said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the condition of the propeller indicated that the engine
had been losing power.</TE>
<TE>   As recently as last month, friends said, Brand was piloting a
Black Hawk helicopter as it hovered over Edwards Air Force Base as
part of the space shuttle Endeavor's landing team.</TE>
<TE>   Brand had also flown medical relief helicopters, his friends said.</TE>
<TE>   Brand was a former Army flight instructor, according to his
colleagues at the Century 21 Alosta real estate office in Glendora.</TE>
<TE>   "He loved to fly," Pamela Ganas, a co-worker and friend of four
years, said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had to fly with anyone," Ganas said, "it would have been
Michael Brand."</TE>
<TE>   Of the crash, Cindy Alder said simply, "It was an act of God. It
was their time to go."</TE>
<TE>   Brand, who had been married for 26 years, is also survived by
three children--Justin, 24, Tamara, 20, Geoffrey, 16--and a
grandchild.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing you guys can write can adequately pay tribute to him,"
said Wise, his neighbor and close friend.</TE>
<TE>   "His death left a huge hole in all of our lives and all of our
hearts."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday night, the flags raised in honor of the nation's
birthday remained out on Brand's street. Only now, they were lowered
to half-staff.</TE>

<CX>   Plane crash victim--A Saturday story in the California section about
a plane crash in San Dimas that left four people dead incorrectly
stated that one of those killed in the aircraft, Michael Alder, was a
Mormon. Alder grew up in a Mormon family but left the church 20 years
ago and was active in Grace Church of Glendora.</CX>

<HD>Disabled Facing Curbs in Transit Program</HD>
<DH>Transportation: Budget woes threaten Access Services'
low-fare, same-day rides.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tens of thousands of severely disabled Los Angeles County residents
stand to lose cheap, same-day transportation because surging
ridership has busted the budget of the nonprofit group that provides
their taxi and van service.</LD>
<LD>   Much of the region's transit for the disabled is provided by
Access Services, an organization that essentially acts as a
contractor for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which pays
for more than 90% of the smaller agency's budget.</LD>
<LD>   But the two are facing budget troubles, and are considering a plan
that would save money by reducing service to riders who often have no
easy alternative to public transportation.</LD>
<TE>   Each day, a fleet of about 1,400 Access-contracted taxis and vans
blankets the county, giving rides to almost 52,000 passengers with
disabilities ranging from blindness to nearly complete paralysis,
many of whom can't use regular buses and trains.</TE>
<TE>   Ridership, about 2.2 million trips a year, has increased nearly
tenfold in less than a decade. Those trips don't come cheap. Highly
individualized--Access vehicles often carry just one passenger and
rely on special equipment such as wheelchair lifts--the rides are far
more heavily subsidized than other forms of transportation.</TE>
<TE>   Access pays the vans and taxis about $26 per trip, compared with
an average of $1.36 paid by the MTA to subsidize each ride on its
buses and trains.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA and Access provide those services in part because of
federal requirements. The Americans With Disabilities Act mandates
that a disabled person be able to receive specialized taxi or van
pickups after making a reservation one day in advance.</TE>
<TE>   Access goes beyond that, however. Since its inception in 1994, it
has offered low-cost, door-to-door rides the same day that a
reservation is made.</TE>
<TE>   Though some critics complain that rides are late, that drivers
sometimes fail to show up and that complaints are mishandled, patrons
and critics alike agree that the service's popularity is soaring. And
as ridership has grown, so has the cost of the subsidy, making the
program a victim of its own success.</TE>
<TE>   The program's beneficiaries are people such as Harley Rubenstein,
a Long Beach man who uses a wheelchair because of a nerve disorder.
He can call Access and, in about 45 minutes, have a van arrive at his
home to take him to the San Fernando Valley. Such a trip costs $4,
the maximum charge for an Access ride.</TE>
<TE>   Rubenstein said he relies on the service in emergencies. "It's
something we've grown used to," he said. "It's a lifeline."</TE>
<TE>   The MTA board has launched an audit of Access, and says it will
decide the program's fate by November. Among the options is a
takeover by the MTA, with the service being run out of the MTA's
downtown headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   More likely, insiders say, is that the MTA will keep its
relationship with Access as is and decide whether to maintain, boost
or slice the service's budget. Officials say anything short of a
$10-million increase in the MTA's proposed $58-million outlay for
Access next year will almost certainly lead to the loss of low-fare,
same-day service.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to audit came after projections showed that the
agency could soon find itself spending $75 million to $100 million
annually if ridership keeps climbing.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to get this under control," said MTA Chief Executive
Roger Snoble, who has headed the agency for less than a year.</TE>
<TE>   To do that, the transit agency may fall back to the federal
requirements. Under consideration is a move to split the service
provided by Access in two. Most riders would get guaranteed rides for
reservations made one day in advance. For same-day service, officials
are considering having riders pay a flat $9 fee or providing them
with a voucher that would contribute about $13 to the cost of a ride.</TE>
<TE>   The new same-day ride proposal could include more problems than
its high cost.</TE>
<TE>   Passengers are likely to depend more than they currently do on
private taxi companies to provide the rides, and representatives of
those companies have recently voiced reservations about carrying
disabled passengers.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, the same-day rides would not be guaranteed, would
not be subject to federal guidelines on timeliness and might end up
being limited to a fixed number.</TE>
<TE>   But for Access and the MTA, the bottom line is that costs would be
kept in check by reducing ridership an anticipated 18%, according to
Richard DeRock, Access' chief executive. "It's not something I want
to do," he said. "But it's necessary at the moment."</TE>
<TE>   That angers advocates for the disabled, some of whom are working
feverishly to find non-MTA funding and cuts within Access that will
help keep their service untouched.</TE>
<TE>   "We're glad to have a few months to work this out but, really, we
feel squeezed," said Kathleen Perrin, head of the Paratransit Riders
Coalition. "We're worried we're going to lose some of our
independence."</TE>
<TE>   She said that, particularly in Los Angeles--with its sprawl,
congestion and poor accessibility for the disabled--fast, cheap
transit service is a must.</TE>
<TE>   "Why shouldn't we have the same ability to get to places as other
people?" she asked. People without disabilities, she noted, "don't
have to make a reservation one day in advance" to take a bus or a
train.</TE>
<TE>   She added that many disabled people are poor and on fixed incomes,
which makes the proposed fares of $9 or more hard to swallow.</TE>
<TE>   Perrin may have an ally in the Federal Transit Administration, the
agency responsible for overseeing how well the Americans With
Disabilities Act is being followed.</TE>
<TE>   The transit administration's chief of civil rights said in a
recent interview that his agency has yet to decide whether a $9
charge or the taxi vouchers violate requirements that the cost of
transportation for the disabled be close to regular bus and rail
fares.</TE>
<TE>   DeRock said he is confident that any new service will pass legal
muster.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, DeRock, who announced in June that he is leaving the
agency to take over a transit organization in Washington state, said
he doubts that MTA auditors will turn up much to cut as they scour
Access' books, looking for waste. "I welcome them," he said, "with
confidence."</TE>

<HD>Christian Fiction Finally Has a Prayer of Selling</HD>
<DH>Publishing: Once just a niche market, it's going more
mainstream, with bestsellers and a broadening style.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A literary dawn is beginning to penetrate Christian fiction's "dark
and stormy night," a decades-long era of critically snubbed novels
plagued by cartoonish characters, preposterous plots and preachy
prose.</LD>
<LD>   Higher-caliber literature is moving aside a generation of
enthusiastic writers whose evangelical zeal far outstripped their
literary abilities. The record-breaking "Left Behind" series, based
on the Bible's book of Revelation, generated the No. 1-selling novel
in the U.S. last year, "Desecration." Respected mainstream writers,
feeling a missionary call, have jumped the fence to the Christian
market--a career move analogous, in terms of audience potential, to a
big leaguer sending himself down to the minors. And some Christian
novels are even being reviewed--favorably--by secular publications.</LD>
<LD>   "You can't base your opinion on Christian fiction by what you read
three years ago," said Brandilyn Collins, one of the genre's hot new
writers. Her book, "Color the Sidewalk for Me," won glowing reviews
in mainstream magazines. ("Excellent ... beautifully written ...
well-developed characters ... exemplifies how Christian fiction is
finally coming of age," wrote Publishers Weekly.)</LD>
<TE>   The upswing in quality has resulted in a doubling of sales in
Christian fiction since 1995, with novels now accounting for about
20% of revenue in U.S. Christian bookstores, according to industry
estimates. During the same time, the number of available novels has
grown from 500 to 1,800, many now published by divisions of major
houses such as Viking, Warner and Doubleday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear people want intrigue, drama, suspense and romance
without the blood and gore and sex," said Bill Anderson, president of
the Christian Booksellers Assn., the trade group that represents
2,450 member retail stores and 685 publishers in a $4-billion
industry. Christians "have a rich heritage in this area. Jesus was
the greatest storyteller that ever lived."</TE>
<TE>   How to sustain the momentum in Christian fiction will be a main
topic of discussion next Saturday during the CBA's annual gathering
at the Anaheim Convention Center. The event, closed to the public, is
expected to draw a crowd of more than 11,000, including publishers,
booksellers, pastors, authors and musicians.</TE>
<TE>   Before the convention, a group of 100 Christian novelists will
meet in Anaheim for a two-day writing retreat. And on Friday, more
than 300 people will attend the third annual Christy Awards, which
honor the best authors in six categories of Christian fiction:
historical, romance, futuristic, suspense, Western and first-time
novelists.</TE>
<TE>   Keeping Story in Mind</TE>
<TE>   The power of a well-written story has become more attractive to
patrons of Christian bookstores who traditionally favored how-to,
self-help and inspirational books based on biblical principles.</TE>
<TE>   "A good story can captivate your mind and emotions the way
something more didactic cannot," said Carol Johnson, vice president
of editorial at Bethany House Publishers in Minneapolis. "I know
we've published novels that would compare favorably to Oprah's picks.
The only difference is: Christian novels leave readers with hope."</TE>
<TE>   Distinguishing features of Christian fiction include a biblical
message woven into the plot, no cursing and no gratuitous violence.
Sex, if it takes place at all, happens behind closed doors.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last 20 years, Christian publishing has had a few
breakthrough novels--one was Frank Peretti's "This Present Darkness"
in 1986--that earned Christian fiction a tiny space on the shelves of
the major bookstores and a small measure of respect. But it is the
juggernaut "Left Behind" series, which began in the late 1990s, that
changed the reputation of Christian novels, including their potential
to make huge profits.</TE>
<TE>   The first nine "Left Behind" books sold 34 million copies--50
million if you include children's books and videos, according to
Publishers Weekly.</TE>
<TE>   "What Tiger Woods has done to golf, 'Left Behind' has done for
Christian titles," Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   "Those days are over when people thought it was commercial suicide
to deal with God elements in novels," said Bill Myers, a Los
Angeles-based writer whose children's and adult novels and videos
have sold an estimated 6 million copies.</TE>
<TE>   While a typical Christian novel will earn an advance of $10,000 to
$15,000, big-name authors can receive payments in the six figures.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Christian novelists have a long way to go to catch up to
their mainstream counterparts. It's a leap that Christian musicians
such as Jars of Clay, the OC Supertones and Amy Grant successfully
made during the 1990s in that industry. Today, Christian fiction
remains wildly uneven.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel fairly passionate about the potential for Christian
fiction and feel frustrated by when it doesn't reach that potential,"
said Jana Riess, religion book review editor of Publishers Weekly.
Her biggest complaint: the preachy tone of many of the books.</TE>
<TE>   She recently read a novel in which a teenage boy tried to talk his
girlfriend into having an abortion.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'Well, it's only tissue.' What 16-year-old boy is going
to regard [a fetus] as tissue? The novels that really irritate me are
ones that subordinate plot and character to the message. You can
write a message-driven novel with well-developed characters."</TE>
<TE>   In this respect, the genre has been helped by successful writers
in the secular world who decided their calling was in the Christian
market. They include romance writers Francine Rivers and Robin Lee
Hatcher.</TE>
<TE>   Reversing Direction</TE>
<TE>   Novelist Brandilyn Collins, after an intense religious experience,
pulled three novels she had submitted to secular publishers, rewrote
them with Christian themes and sold them to a Christian publisher.</TE>
<TE>   "My original move [to the world of Christian publishing] wasn't a
career move," she said. "It was one of obedience. I'm writing with
God as my boss. And so far, he's doing a good job."</TE>
<TE>   But the migration goes both ways, with some of the Christian
world's most respected novelists, including Augusta Trobaugh and
Vinita Hampton Wright, switching to the bigger, and more lucrative,
secular readership.</TE>
<TE>   The lure of mainstream readers also can unshackle authors who have
been chastised for letting the words "damn" or "bastard" come out of
their characters' mouths. For Christian novelists, the reality is
that one reader complaint can get their book pulled from the shelves
by a nervous store owner.</TE>
<TE>   The desire to write explicitly about their faith keeps most
Christian writers wanting to reach fellow believers.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to write in-depth about my Christian faith, and we can't
explore those issues in the secular market," said novelist Myers.
"There's a bias against delving too deep into any religion,
especially into Christianity."</TE>

<HD>Mark McGarrity, 58; Columnist and Writer of Irish-Themed
Mysteries</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mark McGarrity, who wrote mysteries under the name Bartholomew Gill
featuring the witty, shrewd Irish detective Peter McGarr, died
Thursday when he fell from a stairway outside his home in Morristown,
N.J. He was 58.</LD>
<LD>   McGarrity, who was also an outdoors columnist for the Star-Ledger
of Newark, wrote more than a dozen McGarr mysteries--most recently
"The Death of an Irish Sinner."</LD>
<LD>   "The contradictions Gill manages to unearth in one small, placid
patch of Irish ground are simply astonishing," the New York Times
wrote in 2000 about "The Death of an Irish Lover."</LD>
<TE>   Other titles included "McGarr on the Cliffs of Moher," "Death on a
Cold, Wild River" and "The Death of a Joyce Scholar," which was
nominated for the Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America.</TE>
<TE>   Though he was born and raised in Holyoke, Mass., McGarrity's works
drew on his Irish heritage and his knowledge of the country's
history. He had earned a master's degree in literature from Trinity
College in Dublin, Ireland, after graduating from Brown University in
1966 with a degree in English literature.</TE>
<TE>   He joined the Star-Ledger staff in 1996 as a feature writer and
began writing the outdoors column in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The 20-foot fall from a stairway that killed McGarrity was ruled
accidental.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said he might have misplaced his keys and tried to
reach through a window to get into his second-floor apartment when he
toppled over a railing. His body was found shortly after midnight by
his landlord's daughter, detective Mark Slockbower said.</TE>
<TE>   McGarrity is survived by his 14-year-old daughter, Madeleine.</TE>

<HD>Woman Awarded $5.3 Million in 'Date Rape' Case</HD>
<DH>Courts: Judge enters a default civil judgment against a man
acquitted of criminal charges that he had drugged women.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A businessman who was acquitted of rape charges in a criminal trial
has been ordered to pay $5.3 million in civil damages to one of his
alleged victims.</LD>
<LD>   The default judgment against John Gordon Jones came one year after
the computer entrepreneur was found not guilty of raping nine women
and released from jail, where he had spent two years without bail
awaiting criminal trial.</LD>
<LD>   Jones said he will appeal the civil judgment.</LD>
<TE>   Last week, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge David L.
Minning awarded the woman $4 million in punitive damages, nearly $1
million in compensatory damages and about $280,000 in attorney fees
and other costs.</TE>
<TE>   "I am an innocent man," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   "She doesn't deserve a dime. This is not justice, but we will get
to justice."</TE>
<TE>   The woman alleged that Jones kidnapped and sexually assaulted her
in 1998. She asked for damages, including emotional distress.</TE>
<TE>   Her lawyer, Gregg J. Goldfarb, said his client is ecstatic.</TE>
<TE>   "It took tremendous courage, considering what the first jury did,
for her to have faith that the system was not broken," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Goldfarb said he hopes that other women will learn to be very
guarded with their drinks.</TE>
<TE>   Jones was accused of giving the women what are commonly known as
"date rape drugs" when he met them in bars.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a horrendous situation," Goldfarb said.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, who owns World Tech, a computer firm in Encino, was
criminally accused of picking up women in Hollywood nightclubs,
taking them by limousine to his home in the Beverly Glen area and
drugging and sexually assaulting them.</TE>
<TE>   Nine women alleged that they were victims. Defense attorneys
maintained that the sex was consensual. Jurors deliberated for 15
days before returning the not guilty verdicts.</TE>
<TE>   Several civil suits filed by other alleged victims were dismissed.
One suit was settled with a $6,000 donation by Jones to the
plaintiff's favorite charity, said one of Jones' attorneys, Milton C.
Grimes.</TE>
<TE>   Goldfarb said he expects to collect the judgment from Jones.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got a business and he's got real property," he said. "We're
all over him."</TE>
<TE>   Jones' attorneys and investigator said the judge's order was
flawed.</TE>
<TE>   Before the trial, Minning found that Jones' legal team violated
rules by failing to hand over information to the other side and
sanctioned the lawyers $150,000.</TE>
<TE>   Then he determined that the lawyers were still not complying, and
ruled that they could not present their case.</TE>
<TE>   "This was not a jury trial," said Jones' private investigator,
William Pavelic.</TE>
<TE>   "This was not based on facts or what transpired."</TE>
<TE>   Pavelic said he and Jones' lawyers did not have the original notes
and tapes that were the basis of the default judgment.</TE>
<TE>   Grimes, who represented Jones in the criminal case, said the civil
attorneys "were doing everything in their power to comply with the
court's discovery requirements," and that Jones should have gotten
the opportunity to have his day in court.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think he should be punished by dismissing his defense,"
Grimes said.</TE>
<TE>   After Minning dismissed Jones' response to the suit, the
plaintiff's attorneys presented several witnesses--including the
woman, her therapist and a psychiatrist from UCLA Medical
Center--during the damages portion of the case. Minning issued his
decision June 25.</TE>
<TE>   Jones has filed a separate civil suit against Los Angeles County
and the district attorney's office.</TE>

<HD>Katy Jurado, 78; Mexican Film Star Had U.S. Roles in the
'50s</HD>

<LD>Katy Jurado, the Mexican actress who earned an Academy Award
nomination for her 1954 supporting role as Spencer Tracy's Indian
wife in the western "Broken Lance," has died. She was 78.</LD>
<LD>   Jurado, who is perhaps best remembered by American audiences for
her supporting role as Gary Cooper's onetime girlfriend in the
classic film "High Noon," died Friday at her home in Cuernavaca,
about 35 miles south of Mexico City. She had been suffering from lung
and heart ailments.</LD>
<LD>   Jurado, who was one of the most prominent Mexican actresses in
American movies made in the 1950s, was a major star in Mexican
cinema. She won three Ariels, Mexico's equivalent of the Oscar,
including one for her role in director Luis Bunuel's 1952 film "El
Bruto."</LD>
<TE>   Jurado, who made her movie debut in Mexico in 1943, was
supplementing her acting income by writing a movie column when she
landed her first role in an American film, as the wife of an aging
matador in Budd Boetticher's 1951 drama "The Bullfighter and the
Lady."</TE>
<TE>   Boetticher and John Wayne--the film's producer--had spotted the
striking Jurado at a bullfight in Mexico and, without knowing she was
an actress, had discussed her playing a part in the picture, which
starred Robert Stack and Gilbert Roland.</TE>
<TE>   Jurado spoke little English and said her lines phonetically in the
film, a practice she repeated in "High Noon," which garnered her
critical acclaim and a Golden Globe Award.</TE>
<TE>   Jurado, who had a memorable confrontation with Grace Kelly as
Cooper's Quaker bride, found the role of the volatile Helen Ramirez
easy to play.</TE>
<TE>   "I always do what I feel and say what I think," she told
Associated Press in a 1984 interview. "I still have my temper."</TE>
<TE>   Although she appeared frequently in American films throughout the
1950s, they are considered less than stellar roles.</TE>
<TE>   Jurado was born Maria Cristina Jurado Garcia in Guadalajara in
1927, the daughter of former landowners whose holdings had been
confiscated during the revolution. She spent her years under the
domination of her grandmother who was, Jurado once said, "always
faithful to aristocratic ideals."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Jurado was considered a rebel against family traditions
when she began her movie career after being discovered as a teenager
by the Mexican film director Emilio Fernandez.</TE>
<TE>   Her father threatened to put her in a convent school, but she was
married three months later--to Victor Velazquez, with whom she had
two children--and continued her career.</TE>
<TE>   Jurado didn't feel that she was typecast in American films--in
"Barabbas," starring Anthony Quinn, she played a Jew. But she told
Associated Press that she often was offered roles that were mere
stereotypes of what Americans believe Mexicans are like.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't take all the films that were offered, just those with
dignity," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Jurado believed her career in American films would have been more
successful had she spent more time in Los Angeles rather than
returning to Mexico after each film was completed. She lived in
California, however, during her second marriage, in 1959, to actor
Ernest Borgnine, which ended in divorce in 1964.</TE>
<TE>   Jurado, who continued to act in films until 1998, is especially
remembered by her fans in Mexico for her role in the 1957 melodrama
"Nosotros Los Pobres" ("We the Poor"), opposite the Mexican film
heartthrob Pedro Infante.</TE>
<TE>   "She planted the Mexican flag in the U.S. film industry, and made
her country proud," said Mauricio Hernandez, an official of the
National Actors Assn. in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Among Jurado's other American film credits are "One-Eyed Jacks,"
"Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid" and "Under the Volcano." She also
played Paul Rodriguez's mother on the short-lived ABC sitcom "a.k.a.
Pablo" in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   She is survived by a daughter, Sandra.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral plans were not immediately announced.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Residents Recall Seaside Home</HD>
<DH>History: Japanese Americans who lived on Terminal Island
before World War II dedicate a memorial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY McCARTNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whistles still blow across the waters surrounding Terminal Island,
but they don't announce the return of the fishing boats. No children
remain to play on the island's sandlots.</LD>
<LD>   The routines of the Japanese American residents who had lived on
Terminal Island since the late 1800s ended soon after the Japanese
attack on Pearl Harbor.</LD>
<LD>   But for Yuki Tatsumi and others who trawled the waters around
Terminal Island, or grew up accustomed to the routines of a fishing
village, the memories of Fish Harbor remain fond ones, despite the
hard times that arrived when war came.</LD>
<TE>   This morning, remaining members of the "Terminal Islanders," a
group of former Fish Harbor residents, will dedicate a memorial to
their time there. It will recall the fishermen, the women who walked
every morning to the canneries and the youngsters who took classes in
kendo and judo.</TE>
<TE>   Tatsumi, who was born in 1920, said that most people who lived on
the island in the '30s and '40s would be shocked by the place today.</TE>
<TE>   "They won't recognize it," Tatsumi said. "Only the street names
are the same."</TE>
<TE>   The canneries are gone. Tuna Street, once the island's "main
street" of shops and stores, now has only one restaurant, surrounded
by warehouses and shipping businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Across the harbor, sandwiched between a firehouse and a private
marina, is the monument.</TE>
<TE>   A pair of men, frozen in bronze, prepare to cast their nets into
the blue-green water. Behind them, two panes of glass are etched with
a picture of Fish Harbor in 1936. For a viewer standing off to the
side, the etching superimposes itself on the current scene, replacing
yachts and sailboats with fishing boats and warehouses with the
barracks-type housing where the Japanese American fishermen and their
families lived.</TE>
<TE>   The monument also features nine black marble panels with
inscriptions telling the story of Fish Harbor. Nearby stands a
17-foot torii gate with the words for "good fishing" carved in
Japanese characters on its crossbeam.</TE>
<TE>   Tatsumi, the son of an abalone fisherman, was born at Fish Harbor.
He learned early how lucrative fishing could be in those days. After
high school, he took a bookkeeping job on the island for $75 a month.
One day he helped pull in some nets "just for the fun of it" on a
relative's fishing boat, and pulled in $75 for the day.</TE>
<TE>   When war broke out with Japan, Tatsumi waited to be drafted as a
1-A private into the U.S. Army. Instead, he was classified as
4C--"enemy alien."</TE>
<TE>   Along with the rest of Fish Harbor's 3,000 Japanese American
residents, Tatsumi was ordered to leave his home for an internment
camp within 48 hours.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Navy later tore down the fishermen's housing and took
over the land.</TE>
<TE>   When he was released from camp in 1945, Fish Harbor was gone. He
eventually opened a grocery store in Long Beach, which he sold in
1982.</TE>
<TE>   The memorial, he said, started as an idea among about 1,200 former
Fish Harbor residents who gathered and formed the "Terminal
Islanders" group in 1971.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until 1998, when a nonprofit committee had been founded
and a $140,000 grant had been secured, that building the memorial
seemed possible.</TE>
<TE>   Tatsumi estimated that several hundred people would attend this
morning's dedication, including several former residents from around
the country.</TE>
<TE>   Only about 600 Terminal Islanders remain. Their desire to "honor
our parents for their contributions to the U.S. Japanese fishing
industry" hasn't diminished, Tatsumi said.</TE>

<HD>Bid to Free Molester Considered</HD>
<DH>Courts: Jury must decide if the man who had himself
castrated still presents a danger.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Ventura County jury on Friday grappled with the question of freedom
for a convicted child molester who had himself castrated in an effort
to quell his sexual obsession.</LD>
<LD>   After a two-week hearing that blended dry scientific testimony
with chilling images of a compulsive predator, the six men and six
women began their deliberations in the late afternoon. The question
they must answer is whether Stephen Norten's surgery in January is
likely to end a lifetime of preying upon young boys for sex.</LD>
<LD>   By Norten's account to therapists who testified, he has seduced
more than 100 children since his teen years. Now 41 years old, he has
been convicted of sex-related offenses seven times, five of them when
he was in his early 20s.</LD>
<TE>   Legally classified as a "sexually violent predator," Norten is
fighting the state's bid to keep him in treatment at Atascadero State
Hospital. State law allows repeat sexual offenders to be kept in
custody indefinitely if prosecutors prove they remain a threat--a
procedure they must undertake every two years.</TE>
<TE>   Housed at Atascadero since 1997, Norten has spent most of his time
since the early 1980s in treatment programs and prison. He underwent
"chemical castration"--injection of a drug that curbs the sex
drive--but stopped because of its damaging side effects.</TE>
<TE>   In voluntarily submitting to removal of his testicles, Norten took
"the ultimate step" toward rehabilitation, Chief Deputy Public
Defender Neil Quinn told jurors on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "After castration, his impetus to re-offend is really gone," Quinn
said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor David Lehr disagreed. Lehr cast the balding,
bespectacled Norten as a skilled manipulator who, securing his
freedom through surgery, would likely strike again.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just in his crotch," he argued. "It's in his mind."</TE>
<TE>   Norten, who lived for a time in Simi Valley and committed a number
of his crimes there, did not testify.</TE>
<TE>   He failed in two previous attempts for release, but both bids were
made before a Ventura County judge granted his request for
castration.</TE>
<TE>   During the hearing, jurors heard from six expert witnesses--three
who believed castration would eliminate Norten's desire for young
boys, and three who felt that the operation would not change his
perverse behavior.</TE>
<TE>   The experts, all psychiatrists or psychologists, cited European
studies indicating a sharp reduction in repeat crimes among sexual
offenders who had been castrated. At issue was whether Norten would
be among that small percentage who defies the odds and chooses new
victims to pursue.</TE>
<TE>   Norten has asked for release to Arizona, where his father lives.
If his request is granted, he would be under long-term probation
there.</TE>
<TE>   But no official monitoring would keep him from drifting into the
loneliness that always preceded his hunt for young boys, Lehr said.
Neighbors in Arizona would know his past and shun him, Lehr
predicted, driving him to children or to "people with disabilities,
people who can't fend for themselves, people he can manipulate."</TE>
<TE>   Norten's attorney acknowledged there were no guarantees that his
client would lead a blameless life if released.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, castration is "the gold standard" of treatment for sex
offenders, he said, citing testimony from his expert witnesses. To
deny its effectiveness would be to negate "hundreds of years of human
experience" showing how the procedure extinguishes men's sex drives,
Quinn said. Studies have shown that castrated re-offenders are more
likely to be rapists than pedophiles.</TE>
<TE>   "[Rapists'] crimes are about domination and coercion more than
sexual release," he said. "His offending is about sexual release."</TE>

<LD>   Tony Younan, 20, of Rowland Heights and Vivian Gallegos, 27, of El
Monte were held Friday on suspicion of felony evading. They could
also face charges of child endangerment because Gallegos' 15-year-old
sister was in the car, authorities said. The girl was released to her
parents, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Huntington Beach Police Lt. Bill Peterson said officers began
tailing the car about 1:30 a.m. because a computer check indicated
that the 1993 black Acura Integra had been involved in a domestic
violence incident in El Monte.</LD>

<HD>Don't All Vehicles Come With a Dangling Gas Hose as
Standard Equipment?</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Did the driver claim it was a standard feature on her car? "Report of
a verbal dispute between a female customer and a station attendant,"
began a police log item spotted by reader Mary Beth Crispino. "The
woman drove off with the gas hose still attached to her vehicle and
did some damage to the pump," continued the account in the San
Clemente Sun Post-News. "She reportedly refused to give the attendant
any information about herself."</LD>
<LD>   The Who where? While L.A. Mayor James Hahn is struggling to keep
Hollywood from defecting, it looks like he's lost the Hollywood Bowl
to Orange County (see accompanying). At least that's the conclusion
you could reach by reading Entertainment Weekly's Web site report
about the Who, as Mark Geisert did. "I like Irvine. I went to school
in Irvine," Geisert said. "But Irvine's no Hollywood."</LD>
<LD>   Precedent? The Hollywood Bowl wouldn't really be that out of place
in Irvine. After all, Hollywood Park is in Inglewood.</LD>
<TE>   Second lives: Just the other day, I mentioned the Straw Hat
pizzeria that became a Raw Hat pizzeria (before the Straw Hat folks
raised objections). Business signs are sort of like studio props in
Southern California. They're often recycled, sometimes with subtle
changes, as in the case of the landmark Spanish Kitchen restaurant
turned Ona Spa on Beverly Boulevard (see before and after photos by
yours truly and Phil Proctor).</TE>
<TE>   I'm reminded of one Denny's that became a Penny's, a Ship's
restaurant that became a Ship's truck rental, and, my favorite, a
Westside store whose DRUGS sign was changed to RUGS by the new owner.</TE>
<TE>   Talk about a long wait for a table ... : Getting back to the old
Spanish Kitchen, you may recall it was the site of one of L.A.'s
longest-running urban folk tales.</TE>
<TE>   It was a gathering spot for stars until one day in 1961, when a
"Closed for Vacation" notice appeared. It never reopened.</TE>
<TE>   But the interior remained virtually unchanged for more than a
quarter century, table settings intact, salt and pepper shakers in
place. One rumor held that the owner's husband had been murdered
inside and that she wouldn't reopen it until the killer was found.
The old "Lou Grant" TV show featured the mystery in an episode.</TE>
<TE>   Later, a rock group took the name Spanish Kitchen and posed under
the sign on its Web site.</TE>
<TE>   The real story was that the owner's husband had died and she was
simply too distraught to operate the restaurant or dispose of it.</TE>
<TE>   So, the eatery's a spa now, with new owners. No telling whether
the Spanish Kitchen rock group will change its name to Ona Spa.</TE>
<TE>   MiscelLAny: Marvin Chandler of Carmel notes that a high jumper who
just captured first place in the USA Track and Field Championships
with a mark of 7 feet, 7 1/4 inches is named, naturally enough,
Nathan Leeper.</TE>

<HD>Counterculture Game Grows Up--Sort of</HD>
<DH>Ultimate Frisbee is an uninhibited, grueling sport. Now
some players want to add referees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dreamers have poured into California for a million reasons. Only a
handful have come for the Frisbee.</LD>
<LD>   With a disk-flinging pal, Mike Weems moved from Atlanta partly for
a change of scene, but largely for Santa Barbara's thriving brand of
Ultimate Frisbee: a grueling, graceful game that combines elements of
soccer, football, basketball and jovial anarchy.</LD>
<LD>   "This was just the place to be," said Weems, 31, a hotel
accountant who had to bow out of elite competition because of
injuries he suffered in a dive for the elusive disk.</LD>
<TE>   Likewise, it was Ultimate Frisbee--insiders call it Ultimate--that
prompted Greg Husak to sign on for a master's degree in geography at
UC Santa Barbara. As an undergraduate, he had played with the Black
Tide, the university's unofficial Ultimate team. Graduate school
enabled him to keep playing.</TE>
<TE>   At 27, Husak, who now is working toward his doctorate, is a
co-captain of the Santa Barbara Condors, the oldest and one of the
most successful Ultimate teams in the country. He and his
teammates--men old enough to teach their toddlers a decent backhand
flip--won the national championship in 2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a bunch of guys I really care about," Husak said. "We've
kind of grown up together."</TE>
<TE>   At a recent pick-up game on Santa Barbara's East Beach, Husak
dived into action.</TE>
<TE>   The sun was setting and the ocean breeze had picked up. A dozen
laughing, loose-limbed, fresh-faced young men and women made
impossible leaps for the spinning disk on a playing field marked with
sandals stuck in the sand.</TE>
<TE>   Children and dogs drifted onto the field. A man in dripping swim
trunks joined in, fresh from a twilight dip. Husak snatched a disk as
it swooped out of bounds. It could have been the glowing California
beach of a beer commercial.</TE>
<TE>   The players at East Beach and about 60,000 others across the
country have a group of suburban teenagers to thank for their fun.
High school students in Maplewood, N.J., are credited with inventing
the game in the late 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, two teams of seven compete on a field 70 yards long.
Ultimate begins with a "pull," a long fling equivalent to football's
kickoff. The receiving players aim to make their way into the
opposing end zone, fling by sizzling fling. There's no running with
the disk and no physical contact.</TE>
<TE>   A child of the counterculture, Ultimate has no referees. For the
most part, players must decide themselves whether someone has
deliberately slammed an opponent or has held the disk for more than
the 10-second maximum. Players even are expected to call fouls on
themselves, as required by the Ultimate ethic reverently called "the
spirit of the game."</TE>
<TE>   "It's the only sport I know of that has a mandate like that built
into it," said Bernie DeKoven, a Redondo Beach consultant who writes
and teaches about games. In addition to speed and agility, Ultimate
requires carefree zest. At some games, men play in skirts. Two
California teams fought what they called "the holy wars," with
Catholic players outfitted in monks' robes and hora-dancing Jewish
players in yarmulkes. A Las Vegas team features players in
sequin-bedecked Elvis outfits.</TE>
<TE>   Missy Colombo, a 27-year-old architect from northern Virginia, has
seen it all. Since September, she and her boyfriend have trekked
across the United States, most of the time in a 1975 Volkswagen bus,
dropping in at dozens of tournaments and pick-up games.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a fantastic community," she said as she awaited the
repairing of her VW's transmission in Santa Cruz. "We've made instant
friends everywhere. At a tournament in Tucson, we met a couple from
San Diego, and within an hour, they asked us to housesit for them and
take care of their cats."</TE>
<TE>   In Ultimate, inhibitions can drop as swiftly as a pair of shorts.</TE>
<TE>   In Hawaii, Colombo played at a tournament where women on one team
spontaneously shed their tops while their opponents just as quickly
chose the bottomless look.</TE>
<TE>   "We scored two or three points that way," Colombo said. "People
from other fields stopped play to check out what was going on."</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, Ultimate was featured at the World Games in
2001, and there's talk of eventually infiltrating the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   From its headquarters in Colorado Springs, the Ultimate Players
Assn. grapples with the game's urgent issues. How can high athletic
standards co-exist in the same arena as big fun? And how can players
in the heat of high-stakes battle be fair when it comes to judging
their own infractions?</TE>
<TE>   "Observers" are available at elite games, but only when players
can't hash out a ruling themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "There are purists who say no to any third-party observers," said
Joey Gray, the association's executive director. "But if you're going
up with another guy and you're only focused on the disk, you're not
going to be able to look down at your toe and see if you're in or
not." Gray, one of the world's few Frisbee administrators, is asking
a task force for a solution to the problem.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, teams such as the Condors pump up for another
championship season. Most of the players know one another from their
days at UC Santa Barbara but, pursuing professions, they have
scattered.</TE>
<TE>   About twice a month, five of them commute from the Bay Area to
Santa Barbara for practices. One night a week, a trainer helps the
Santa Barbara-based teammates with their sprinting technique. At
least four nights a week, team members lift weights for 90 minutes
before shooting hoops or practicing the elegant Ultimate plays
developed over the team's 28 years.</TE>
<TE>   Even at its highest levels, Ultimate has no big-time sponsors and
no prize money. That means players must pay their own way to distant
tournaments. No more than a few thousand spectators--mostly friends
and supporters--cheer them on, even at the nationals. But who
expected fame and fortune from an $8 plastic toy?</TE>
<TE>   "I've gone to Scotland, Vancouver, Honolulu, Japan," said Jason
Seidler, 28, a Condor who works as a computer programmer in San
Francisco. "I've traveled around the world because I play Frisbee.
Incredible."</TE>

Back Stage became a leading trade journal for performers. The
publication featured audition notices, tips on job hunting, industry
news and reviews.</LD>
<LD>   It opened a Los Angeles office in the 1970s and split into two
publications a decade later: Shoot, for film and television, and Back
Stage, for live performances.</LD>
<TE>   Billboard Publications bought Back Stage in 1986, and Eaker
continued as a consultant before his retirement.</TE>
<TE>   Born in New York City, Eaker served in the Army in Europe during
World War II. After the war, he graduated from City College of New
York and began a career in advertising.</TE>

<HD>Adm. Robert L.J. Long; Led Probe of 1983 Beirut Barracks
Bombing</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Adm. Robert L.J. Long, 82, commander of U.S. military operations in
the Pacific from 1979 to 1983 and the leader of the commission that
investigated the 1983 Beirut barracks attack that killed 241 Marines,
died June 28 at the Bethesda, Md., Naval Medical Center. The cause of
death was not announced.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Kansas City, Mo., Long was a 1943 graduate of the U.S.
Naval Academy at Annapolis. He served in the Pacific during World War
II and was awarded a Bronze Star. After the war, he entered the
submarine service and commanded the Sea Leopard as well as the
nuclear submarines Patrick Henry and Casimir Pulaski.</LD>
<LD>   He served during the Vietnam War and had retired in 1983 after 40
years of service. He was called back to lead the investigation of
Islamic militants' truck bombing of the Beirut barracks.</LD>
<TE>   After a seven-week investigation, Long and his panel concluded
that Marine officers were denied adequate intelligence but also said
there were serious command failures in Lebanon and on the part of
senior officers overseeing them in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   While the panel offered no recommendations on punishment,
President Reagan defused the situation by stating that any blame in
the matter belonged in the office of the commander in chief.</TE>

<HD>Missing Plane Raises Questions</HD>
<DH>Aviation: The apparent theft of a small aircraft at
Camarillo Airport comes amid new security measures and leaves
officials puzzled.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA BLANCHARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Authorities are still searching for a plane reported stolen from
Camarillo Airport--and trying to determine how the theft could have
happened, despite new security measures in place after Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   The single-engine, four-passenger 1971 Cessna 182 was apparently
stolen between Monday and 3 p.m. Wednesday. The aircraft is white
with a horizontal forest-green stripe across the fuselage.</LD>
<LD>   The plane's owner, John M. McClure of Oak Park, dropped it off for
maintenance Monday. When he went to get it at about 3 p.m. Wednesday
from the spot where it was usually tied down, he discovered it
missing.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities searched the airport, but were unable to locate the
plane.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI was notified of the apparent theft and is investigating,
said Robert Mack, head of the FBI's Ventura County office. While Mack
said he is not ruling out any motives, he thinks the plane probably
was stolen for its parts, rather than for terrorist purposes.</TE>
<TE>   The aircraft's description and tail number have been placed in the
FBI's national crime database and on the Federal Aviation
Administration's hot sheet.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear how the plane was stolen. Authorities have
speculated that a thief may have copied a key or hot-wired the plane
to start it, and they believe it was likely taken in the evening.</TE>
<TE>   Camarillo Airport put additional security rules in place and
tightened access to the airfield after Sept. 11, said Scott Smith,
director of airports for Ventura County. "Theoretically, you'd have
to be an airport user or an authorized person to gain entry," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the airport has measures to restrict flying between
midnight and 5 a.m., he said. Pilots must get permission if they wish
to take off during the restricted time, and Camarillo Airport has
24-hour patrols of the airfield, Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Although no takeoff requests were made Monday or Tuesday, it is
possible a plane could have taken off undetected either of those
evenings, Smith said. Pilots of private aircraft are not required to
file flight plans, and usually opt not to do so if they are traveling
short distances. And the Camarillo control tower is closed from 9
p.m. to 7 a.m., a practice common at smaller airports where most
traffic occurs during the day, Smith said. As a result, someone could
have taken off without any record of the flight.</TE>
<TE>   Mack, who is also a pilot, said the plane could have been flown
several hundred miles from the airport if it had a full tank of fuel.
Once stolen, the plane could have been taken to a remote hangar,
where it could be stripped for parts or its appearance disguised,
Mack said.</TE>
<TE>   McClure was not available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Theft of a plane is relatively uncommon, said Eric Nishimoto, a
Ventura County Sheriff's Department spokesman. The Camarillo incident
was the first plane theft he had heard of in his three years with the
department.</TE>

<HD>Talks Lag, but Not Dockworkers' Spirit</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For longies--as the longshoremen are known--it's a memory that still
burns: a July 5, 1934, clash between police and waterfront picketers
in San Francisco that left two longshore workers dead and a hundred
injured. It's called "Bloody Thursday."</LD>
<LD>   Ever since, longshore workers from Seattle to San Diego have taken
the day off each July 5 to honor those who fought and died to
establish the International Longshore and Warehouse Union.</LD>
<LD>   This year, however, with tough contract talks between the ILWU and
Pacific Maritime Assn. limping along, the picnic attended by 1,200
dockworkers and their families at San Pedro's Peck Park on Friday was
more than just another observance of Bloody Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   Emboldened by the resolve of workers nearly seven decades ago,
union members and pensioners--some of them wearing the trademark
white short-brim caps of their founder, Harry Bridges--pushed beyond
platitudes about solidarity and got to the heart of the union born
out of battle.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't come into the ILWU's backyard and start taking jobs and
benefits away from people who spilled blood for them," said Ramone
Ponce De Leon, president of the union's 4,500-member Local 13. "Here,
the employers are not just facing the ILWU. They're also facing the
community that depends on port industry."</TE>
<TE>   That kind of talk suggests that "68 years later, Bloody Thursday
is stiffening peoples' backbones," said Harvey Schwartz, curator of
the ILWU's oral history archives. "With contract negotiations at an
impasse, its mythology and symbolism live on in an understanding that
there is grim, serious business to be done."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday the contract expired between the 10,500 longshore
workers and mostly foreign-owned shipping lines who move $260 billion
of cargo a year on West Coast ports. Now, representatives on both
sides of the bargaining table are trying to resolve their dispute and
avoid a strike or lockout that could cripple the nation's economy.</TE>
<TE>   The most sensitive issues include employers' desire for new
automation and computerization that could outsource longshore jobs.
On Monday, negotiators will travel from San Francisco to the Los
Angeles-Long Beach port complex to examine the ways in which
information is processed, and the people who process it.</TE>
<TE>   "No one in this park today is seeking huge wage increases," said
Assemblywoman Jenny Oropeza (D-Long Beach. "They're just trying to
protect their livelihoods and benefits in an industry that is a
family tradition."</TE>
<TE>   It is hard for a union member to go anywhere in the blue-collar
wharf communities of San Pedro or Wilmington without bumping into
that tradition. Some stores still carry those white Harry Bridges
caps. A year ago, the Los Angeles Maritime Museum organized an
exhibit of historical photographs and documents supplied by the
union.</TE>
<TE>   A monument marks the spot near the port's Berth 145 where Dickie
Parker, 20, of San Pedro and John Knudson, 43, of Lomita were shot to
death on May 15, 1934, by guards hired by the shipping lines.</TE>
<TE>   Last July, a celebration of Bridges' 100th birthday culminated in
a two-mile parade over the Vincent Thomas Bridge from Terminal Island
to San Pedro.</TE>
<TE>   The contest for control of West Coast docks began back in the
early 1920s, when cargo was packed loose by hand and hauled on and
off ships on men's backs.</TE>
<TE>   Prominent among the new faces on the docks at that time was tough,
hawk-faced Bridges, a militant organizer of the newly formed
International Longshore Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The stage was set for a waterfront showdown in 1933 when
shippers--who decided who worked and who didn't through an
employer-controlled hiring hall or dockside "shape-ups"--refused to
negotiate with the ILA.</TE>
<TE>   At 8 p.m. May 9, longshore and warehousemen from Bellingham,
Wash., to San Diego walked off the job. Employers brought
strikebreakers and used political muscle to force police
intervention.</TE>
<TE>   A total of six workers in San Francisco, Seattle and San Pedro
were shot or beaten to death by police or company goons during the
course of the strike. Hundreds of others were injured.</TE>
<TE>   The National Guard was called in to stop the violence. Bridges
turned down a $50,000 bribe to back off from the dockers' demand for
a hiring hall.</TE>
<TE>   ILA members won support from unions up and down the coast for a
general strike in San Francisco that lasted four days but shifted the
balance of power. Longshoremen won a coast-wide agreement that
included a union hiring hall, shorter hours, safer conditions and a
raise of 5 cents an hour.</TE>
<TE>   The ILA broke apart as the ILWU took shape amid an invigorated
West Coast labor movement.</TE>
<TE>   West Coast docks suffered additional strikes in 1936-'37, 1948 and
1971, when dozens of incoming ships were forced to anchor offshore.</TE>
<TE>   For now, neither side is talking about a strike or lockout. They
have, however, agreed to several short-term extensions of their
talks. But as tensions mount, old-timers with the union have been
urging younger workers to keep the culture of 1934 alive.</TE>
<TE>   "Our job today as union members is to protect and save all that
was won and passed on to the present work force," said pensioner Art
Almeida, 73.</TE>
<TE>   "How do we impress that upon the younger generation?" he asked.
"Kids today never had to struggle. Yet, it's up to them."</TE>

<HD>GOP Group to Seek Trustee's Recall</HD>
<DH>Colleges: Organization points to board member Allan Jacobs'
support of the Ventura County district's embattled chancellor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS and MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A conservative, Republican political organization will launch a
recall effort against Ventura County Community College District
trustee Allan Jacobs for his support of embattled Chancellor Philip
Westin, officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The Ventura County Republican Assembly is targeting Jacobs, a
board member for more than 10 years, because of recent comments he
made in local newspapers in support of Westin, said Mike Robinson,
president of the Republican Assembly.</LD>
<LD>   The chancellor is at the center of a political firestorm sparked
by allegations of excessive spending. During a four-year period,
Westin charged the college district more than $119,000 for
business-related expenses, according to district records.</LD>
<TE>   "The issue is fiscal mismanagement of the school board and failure
to oversee Chancellor Westin's expenses," Robinson said</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Jacobs has said a few things in the newspaper that were
distressing.... He said he didn't think it was time for Westin to
resign and that he [Westin] should work on his public image and not
necessarily his spending.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are going to maintain the status quo after everything
that's happened, then we don't want you to represent us."</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs said Friday the group has every right to launch a recall
effort.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure they represent the entire community," Jacobs said.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope they know what they're wishing for. I'm apolitical. I
don't have any political agenda, and I don't think this is a
political issue. I listen to the public."</TE>
<TE>   The announcement by the Republican group is the latest development
in a growing controversy involving Westin, who, according to records,
spent tens of thousands of dollars over the four years on meals,
computer equipment and car repairs.</TE>
<TE>   Trustees voted 4 to 1 in May to renew Westin's contract, giving
him a four-year pact two months after learning of the allegations
over his spending. Trustee John Tallman voted against renewing
Westin's contract.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican group plans to formally announce the recall effort
at a news conference Monday, when it plans to file a notice at the
county registrar's office to begin the process.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs would have seven days to issue a statement in response.
Then, to gain a spot on the ballot, the group would have to collect
8,000 signatures in the county from registered voters who support the
effort.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs, 72, a retired associate superintendent with the Simi
Valley Unified School District, said he stands by his previous
statements that Westin should remain chancellor of the three-campus
college district and that the board should adopt policies that keep
Westin's spending in check.</TE>
<TE>   "To the extent that he [Westin] can be effective--and that's still
an open question--I'm not willing to throw out a guy because of some
decisions he's made that I don't agree with," Jacobs said.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs, a Republican first elected to the nonpartisan post in
1991, said people should look at the district's accomplishments
before making a decision.</TE>
<TE>   "We have outstanding faculty and personnel, the financial health
of the district is reasonably good, we passed a bond issue, we have
excellent transfer rates, graduates get jobs, and we have open
access," Jacobs said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have 100,000 good things, and it's this one thing people
disagree with.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we can get by it and continue, but people have to look at
the context of the district and the good job it's doing."</TE>
<TE>   Three of the board members--President Norman Nagel, John Tallman
and Art Hernandez--face reelection in November.</TE>
<TE>   This is one reason, Robinson said, why Nagel and Hernandez are not
being targeted for recall.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson, an aide to state Sen. Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks),
said his organization does not know enough about trustee Bob
Gonzales' position on Westin to warrant a recall effort at this time.
Gonzales is midway through his four-year term.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Giardiello, McClintock's district director, managed Gonzales'
reelection campaign in 2000, Gonzales said.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzales added, however, that he and Giardiello have not been in
touch for months.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, trustee Hernandez this week called for a special
meeting of the college board to discuss Westin's future. A board
majority has agreed to a meeting, but a date has not been set.</TE>

<HD>A Family Buys Into Roy Rogers' Ranch, and Into His Way of
Life</HD>
<DH>The West: Ernesto Enriquez of Mission Viejo talked his
family into buying the 67 acres near Victorville five months ago.
Today, it opens to the public.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Up Interstate 15 just past the High Desert city of Victorville,
Ernesto Enriquez found his dream. It's here, where old Route 66 takes
visitors west, winding through yesteryear's dusty town centers, that
you can see the cottonwoods lining the Roy Rogers Double R Bar Ranch.</LD>
<LD>   At first glance, there really isn't much to this dream: just a
couple of ranch houses, a barn and several other structures on 67
acres that, until January, was left worse for wear for more than two
years, a victim of the former owner's big ideas and too small
pocketbook.</LD>
<LD>   But for Enriquez, whose father bred and trained some of Rogers'
horses, having a piece of land connected to the American cowboy
legend--who shared the same morals and values his father taught
him--is a dream come true.</LD>
<TE>   The Enriquezes, a second-generation Mexican American family from
Mission Viejo, purchased the property not from Roy Rogers' family but
from a Rogers' family friend in Indiana, who had bought it after the
"King of the Cowboys" died July 6, 1998. It was sold to the
Enriquezes after a dude ranch idea went bust.</TE>
<TE>   For five months, the family--patriarch Carlos Enriquez, his wife,
Alicia, and their five children, including 35-year-old Ernesto, the
eldest--has been working on repairs, upgrading the wells and slapping
on a fresh coat of paint, just in time for today's commemoration of
Rogers' death four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers and Dale Evans, "Queen of the West," who died last year,
starred together in more than 30 movies and two television series.
They lived in nearby Apple Valley but bought the ranch in 1967 so Roy
could skeet-shoot and breed and train racehorses, said Roy "Dusty"
Rogers Jr., the couple's son.</TE>
<TE>   "Dad was really into racehorses; the place even had a bunkhouse
for the race jockeys," he said, adding that his father built a
racetrack at the ranch, which proved expensive.</TE>
<TE>   "He would always say, 'Dad-gummed racehorses. Always working on an
excuse to get hurt.' "</TE>
<TE>   How the Enriquez family came to own Roy Rogers' ranch is a story
best told by Ernesto Enriquez, who like his brothers and sisters grew
up on a nearby ranch run by his father.</TE>
<TE>   Though he attended schools in Victor Valley, Enriquez grew up and
eventually moved to Mission Viejo, where he married, had children and
is now a successful painting and roofing contractor.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to do something for my father," he said. "He had worked
hard all his life and never owned any property. So I put a proposal
together for my brothers and sisters, the whole family, telling them
that we should, if the opportunity came up, try and buy Dad and Mom a
ranch."</TE>
<TE>   When a brother saw that the Roy Rogers' ranch was for sale, he
told the rest of the family. Within days, they were in escrow. The
price was $300,000, Ernesto said.</TE>
<TE>   He soon saw an entrepreneurial opportunity and coaxed his family
into refurbishing the ranch for today's celebration. The public will
be shuttled from the Roy Rogers-Dale Evans Museum in Victorville
eight miles to the ranch, which will have such attractions as farm
animals, pony and hay rides, and a Roy Rogers look-alike.</TE>
<TE>   "This will be a test for us and a chance to survey what the public
wants, especially younger visitors," Ernesto said. "Roy's fans are
getting older, not younger, and if we're to make a go of this, we
need to find out what the public wants."</TE>
<TE>   At the very least, the family now has a working ranch. One
brother, Jesus Enriquez, who trains horses at Los Alamitos racetrack,
plans to board horses there and help his father with boarding and
training at the ranch.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to make this ranch profitable without the museum and
having tourists here," Ernesto said. "But Roy and Dale really made an
imprint here in the Mojave, not just for their movies and stuff, but
for the way they lived.</TE>
<TE>   "They knew my dad.... He trained a few of their horses. They were
very nice, simple people, and we want to carry on the way they lived.</TE>
<TE>   "Really, my wife and I are more into the Roy Rogers nostalgia, and
my dad and my brother Jesus are more into having a booming horse
ranch. We have both of our own dreams, and merging them can be a
challenge, but we're pretty united on this."</TE>
<TE>   On a recent morning, Ernesto's wife, Anne, 38, did the best she
could to avoid the desert winds that swirled creating dust devils
while she lent a hand with painting chores.</TE>
<TE>   She grew up in Italy and instead of Saturday westerns enjoyed the
romanticism of Venice. She knew of Roy Rogers. "But," she said, "I
thought Dale [Evans] was a guy because of the name."</TE>
<TE>   All that changed after her husband's family bought the ranch. She
immersed herself in everything western and took "a crash course on
Roy Rogers and Dale Evans."</TE>
<TE>   She rented their movies and bought their albums, including CDs she
plays in the car for her children. Her two daughters, Elisa, 4, and
Isabella, 2, and nephew, Caesar, 6, can either hum or sing "Happy
Trails," the theme song to "The Roy Rogers Show."</TE>
<TE>   She also read Evans' book, "Angel Unaware," which told of how the
couple coped with the death of their daughter, Robin, who had Down's
syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a beautiful story of love and hope and dedication," she
said. "[Roy and Dale] believed she was their angel given to them to
teach them many things."</TE>
<TE>   The more she learned, the more it became obvious that there were
many parallels with the Rogers and Enriquez families.</TE>
<TE>   "They were a family that was close like us, and stood for high
values and morals," she said. "They were also close to their God like
we are, and loved animals. You know, this whole project--bringing
this ranch back to the way it was--has also brought our family closer
together. In fact, we're seeing our family more now fixing up the
ranch than we've ever seen them."</TE>
<TE>   The Enriquezes know that it's uncertain whether a new generation
will discover the ranch. But if the interest is there, plans call for
a petting zoo and children's camp, complete with such activities as
the original Roy Roger's Riders Club.</TE>
<TE>   "Ernesto is a real go-getter," Dusty Rogers said in an interview
at the Victorville museum. "And I don't want to burst his bubble, but
most people who come through here are on a timetable. They really
don't have two to three hours to go and visit a ranch."</TE>
<TE>   The building housing the museum is for sale, but not the
collection itself. Rogers said that declining attendance since his
parents' death has cut museum revenues, forcing him to seek a more
promising location.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't get me wrong, I wish [Ernesto] all the luck in the world,"
Rogers said. "He figures it's worth a shot."</TE>

<LD>Hanford and Lemoore city officials have banned makeshift weekend used
car lots after residents complained that vehicles they bought from
Los Angeles-based car dealers were lemons.</LD>
<LD>   On weekends, the out-of-town car dealers used to bring hundreds of
used cars to sell in mall parking lots or at the fairgrounds.
Residents told city officials they couldn't find the dealers when
trying to get answers about problems with their vehicles.</LD>
<LD>   Residents and local car dealers also complained about excessive
advertising. The out-of-town dealers drove around with a public
address system announcing weekend tent sales, and set up signs in
residents' yards and on street corners.</LD>

<LD>Few state agencies and departments are complying with a mandate to
award 3% of their contracts to businesses owned by disabled veterans,
a state audit found.</LD>
<LD>   That could mean the 3% goal is unreasonable or that veterans
aren't aware of the program, said the Bureau of State Audits in its
report on the program.</LD>
<LD>   The Disabled Veteran Business Enterprise program was started in
1989 to ensure that disabled veteran business owners have a shot at

<LD>   The City Council has approved an ordinance outlawing the devices,
starting in about 120 days. The blowers will continue to be used by
city crews in commercial areas and in open space, however.</LD>
<LD>   The city plans to replace its current blowers with quieter
gas-powered models. About 20 other cities statewide already have
banned use of such devices on city streets.</LD>

<HD>Keeping Valley Issue on Ballot Urged</HD>
<DH>Secession: LAFCO chief says city's request to remove the
question lacks merit, as does its bid for higher 'alimony.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The top executive for the commission that approved San Fernando
Valley secession for the Nov. 5 ballot recommended on Friday that the
panel reject as meritless a city of Los Angeles request that the
decision be reconsidered.</LD>
<LD>   In his recommendation, Larry Calemine, executive director of the
Local Agency Formation Commission, also said the city could not
support its claim that the Valley should pay more so-called alimony
to Los Angeles if secession wins.</LD>
<LD>   LAFCO has set the alimony payment at $127.1 million the first year
to cover tax revenue Los Angeles would lose. Los Angeles asked for
$288 million. The payments would drop 5% annually until they ended in
20 years. The city wanted them to continue for 25 years with no
gradual reduction.</LD>
<TE>   Calemine said the city's argument that it needed more alimony to
cover the cost of centralized services, such as the 911 emergency
system, "defies common sense."</TE>
<TE>   He said the city could avoid those costs by reorganizing
departments and services if it loses the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   He also said a city consultant's report on the $288-million claim
lacked documentation and contained errors, rendering it "an
unverifiable and likely inaccurate piece of research."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn disputed Calemine's findings.</TE>
<TE>   "Larry Calemine's never managed any city budget that I know of,"
Hahn said, calling the LAFCO alimony proposal "unrealistic."</TE>
<TE>   Because it already has rejected similar arguments by the city,
LAFCO is expected to ratify Calemine's recommendation at a meeting on
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   That would clear the way for the county Board of Supervisors to
hold a protest hearing at which 50% of the 581,000 voters in the
Valley would have to file written objections to keep the secession
measure off the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Calemine also recommended that LAFCO reject a city request that
the commission lift restrictions on water and power rates that Los
Angeles could charge Valley residents. LAFCO has barred Los Angeles
from charging Valley customers higher rates than those paid by Los
Angeles residents.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Calemine urged the commission to turn down the city's
request that Los Angeles not be required to share with a Valley city
the local proceeds of the national tobacco lawsuit settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles has also asked LAFCO to reconsider its decision to put
Hollywood secession before voters. That request is pending.</TE>

<HD>Sex Club in Valley Is Shut by City</HD>
<DH>Raid: Five people are arrested and owners cited after area
residents alert authorities to a suspicious ad.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles City Councilman Jack Weiss announced Friday that an
illegal sexual-encounter club in Studio City has been shut down.</LD>
<LD>   The Silk Lounge was raided Wednesday by LAPD officers, who
arrested five people on suspicion of engaging in lewd acts in a
public place, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   "We have taken quick action here, and if they come back we will
kick them in the teeth again," said Weiss as he stood in front of the
club in the 12400 block of Ventura Boulevard.</LD>
<TE>   Weiss and the Los Angeles Police Department's North Hollywood
Division were told of the club by local residents, who became
suspicious after seeing a recent newspaper advertisement.</TE>
<TE>   The ad promoted "A July 4th Hedonist Affair," in which customers
were invited to have sex that would be shown live on the Internet.
The Silk Lounge was described in the ad as a "private members-only
club where adults can meet and play." Singles were to pay $40 at the
door and couples $60.</TE>
<TE>   Weiss, who represents the 5th Council District, said he was
stunned that the club would be located "in a commercial area
surrounded by thriving residential communities."</TE>
<TE>   Undercover officers visited the club twice before the raid, said
LAPD Capt. Bruce Crosley, commander of the North Hollywood Division.
The officers did not engage in any sexual activity, Crosley said.</TE>
<TE>   The arrests were made because police said the club was not
private; anyone walking by with enough money for the cover charge
could enter.</TE>
<TE>   The club owners, whose names were not released, were cited by
inspectors of the city's Department of Building and Safety for
operating an adult club within 500 feet of a residential area,
authorities said.</TE>

<HD>A Castoff Child Who Grew Up to Be a Queen</HD>
<DH>Activism: Foster child Venus Manuel became Miss L.A.
County. She gives others hope.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They pay attention when she strides down the Juvenile Hall corridor
in her military fatigues--her jaw set, the jangle of her lockdown
keys and the sound of her jump boots echoing off the stark
concrete-block walls.</LD>
<LD>   They pay attention when she strolls across the ballroom runway in
her silk chiffon gown--a million-dollar smile on her face, a jeweled
crown shimmering on her head, and applause and cheers ringing in her
ears.</LD>
<LD>   People pay attention to Venus Marie Manuel.</LD>
<TE>   Manuel's teenage years were spent being bounced from one temporary
home to another. But today, at 23, she has gone from foster child to
being the poster child for how castaway kids can make good.</TE>
<TE>   Manuel works as a Los Angeles County detention services officer at
Central Juvenile Hall. She is an Air Force Reserve combat
photographer. She just graduated with honors from Cal State Dominguez
Hills and is entering grad school. And she is the reigning Miss Los
Angeles County, ready to compete next week in the Miss California
pageant.</TE>
<TE>   In her spare time, Manuel talks with every youngster she can find
who is about to be "emancipated" from the foster-care system and
thrown into the adult world. She talks with every grown-up who will
listen, too.</TE>
<TE>   Her message to teenagers is to be optimistic and grab onto
opportunities that are out there. Her message to adults is that
improvements must be made to the foster-care transition system.</TE>
<TE>   "In the real world, kids can go back to their parents at any
age--18, 24, you name it. In foster care, you're left without a home
when you turn 18. We have to teach kids more about being
independent," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids shouldn't transition into the streets or into prostitution
or the adult criminal system. It's essential to show lawmakers that
it would be cheaper to put kids in college and housing than into
adult institutions."</TE>
<TE>   Manuel's rapport with teenagers in foster care is obvious when she
pulls her Miss Los Angeles County crown from its velvet-lined Lucite
case and holds it out for all to see. Eyes bulge. And jaws drop when
youngsters hear that Manuel was once one of them.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was in the system just five short years ago, we didn't
have people want to stand by us and help us into success. My start
wasn't easy, either," she told one group of teenage girls about to
leave foster care last month.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone needs someone to look up to. When I was going through
the foster system, I'd ask, 'Why me?' Girls, everything that's
happening to you is happening for a reason. It's up to you to take
your struggles and turn them into successes. I'm not going to lie to
you and say it was easy. It was very difficult for me, but I got
there."</TE>
<TE>   Manuel lived in nine foster homes after she and her younger sister
were removed from their drug-addicted parents when she was 12.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the foster homes I was in were worse than my biological
home," she says. "I hated the situation they put me and my little
sister through. But I looked at my mom and saw the way she struggled.
I saw that I wanted to be nothing like her. So my mother saved my
life."</TE>
<TE>   Manuel signed up for the Air Force Reserves for the pay after
graduating from Palmdale High School. After being trained as a
military photographer, she enrolled at Antelope Valley College.</TE>
<TE>   "In one of my classes, there were two girls who had won the Miss
Lancaster and Miss Quartz Hill contests," Manuel said.</TE>
<TE>   "I despised everything about that. I was the biggest tomboy ever.
I hardly ever wore makeup. I wasn't blond, tall and skinny. But I
became very good friends with them, and they told me about the
scholarships."</TE>
<TE>   Beauty contests these days award college scholarships instead of
cash or cars. Still, Manuel remained uninterested in competing until
her new friends told her that pageants also can be a platform for
promoting personal viewpoints.</TE>
<TE>   With some trepidation, Manuel entered the Miss High Desert contest
two years ago and won. Her talent consisted of taekwondo moves she
had learned for self-defense after being assaulted as a child. Her
platform was a call for improvement in the foster-care transition
system.</TE>
<TE>   She entered and won the Miss Central California pageant last year.
She used both scholarships to help pay her way at Cal State Dominguez
Hills, where she graduated in May with a degree in human services.</TE>
<TE>   Judges in February's Miss Los Angeles County contest at the
Brentwood Theater in West Los Angeles seemed impressed that Manuel's
martial arts talent and foster-care talk reflected things she had
lived, not merely lifted from the 11 o'clock news.</TE>
<TE>   "Where she has come from and has come to is an inspiration," said
Lynn Miller, associate director of the Los Angeles County pageant.
"This girl has been through a lot. She's smart and kind and strong.
People need to hear her message."</TE>
<TE>   Those at the Miss California pageant Wednesday through next
Saturday in Fresno, which serves as a preliminary round to
September's Miss America contest in Atlantic City, will hear it.</TE>
<TE>   Winning the state crown, Manuel says, "would get me into the doors
of legislators, of people who will listen."</TE>
<TE>   It would also mean a $10,000 scholarship that would pay for
graduate school, where Manuel plans to study conflict negotiation and
management.</TE>
<TE>   Those at Central Juvenile Hall are rooting for her in the contest.
They say her background gives her clout with the hard-edged,
hard-to-place youngsters being housed there.</TE>
<TE>   "She's the biggest role model I could ask for," said Sharen
Winkey, supervisor of a high-security girls' unit where
Manuel--equipped with pepper spray and handcuffs--is assigned.</TE>
<TE>   (Manuel said she wears baggy military clothing and Air Force jump
boots on the job to "avoid sending the wrong signal" to teenage boys
housed in other units of the center.)</TE>
<TE>   County probation officials have recruited Manuel to speak at
meetings of youngsters being emancipated from foster care. She was a
keynote speaker at the department's 10th annual "Success Is Our
Future" scholarship awards banquet in May.</TE>
<TE>   Those who have been through foster care say Manuel is believable.</TE>
<TE>   "It pretty much says even emancipated foster kids can do it, that
if she can, so can I," said Marcy Venegas, 23. "Younger kids
struggling with self-esteem see that you can persevere."</TE>
<TE>   Those involved with foster transition work say former wards of the
court usually want nothing to do with the system after they leave it.</TE>
<TE>   "Most foster children split and don't want to look back," said
Sherry Wunder, who runs a six-bed YWCA transitional housing unit for
emancipated foster children in Santa Monica, where Manuel now lives.</TE>
<TE>   Before leaving for the Fresno pageant, Miss Los Angeles County
continued making her guard rounds at Juvenile Hall.</TE>
<TE>   That's where a girl of about 16, wearing county-issued clothes and
a sullen look, stopped and stared when she spied Manuel's crown
nestled in its special box.</TE>
<TE>   It's real, Manuel said of the tiara. And she's the real deal, too:
a survivor of the system.</TE>
<TE>   "A diamond is a chunk of coal that's made good under pressure,"
Manuel told the teenager.</TE>
<TE>   The girl brightened. She understood.</TE>

<LD>Police are still seeking clues in the brief kidnapping of a woman
from her east Ventura home.</LD>
<LD>   The woman, whose name was withheld by police, told authorities
that a man entered her Twin River Circle condominium as she slept at
about 1 a.m. on June 27, took her wallet and forced her to leave with
him in her vehicle. Later that morning she flagged down a California

<HD>W. Wilkinson, 60; Former Ky. Governor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Kentucky Gov. Wallace Wilkinson, a self-made millionaire who
helped create the state's lottery and overhauled its public schools,
died Friday. He was 60.</LD>
<LD>   Wilkinson, a Democrat who was governor from 1987 to 1991, had been
battling a recurrence of lymphatic cancer first diagnosed during his
term of office. He died at St. Joseph Hospital in Lexington a day
after suffering a stroke, said his attorney, Robert Brown.</LD>
<LD>   Wilkinson, whose business empire collapsed in bankruptcy last
year, started a bookstore as a teenager that grew into a national
company. At its peak, Wallace's Bookstores operated 91 shops on 60
college and seminary campuses.</LD>
<TE>   His administration helped create the Kentucky Lottery, which he
had pushed as an alternative to higher taxes; and the 1990 Kentucky
Education Reform Act, which set high performance standards, held
schools accountable for their results and greatly increased school
funding.</TE>
<TE>   But he was dogged throughout his administration by questions about
whether he used his office to advance his business interests.</TE>
<TE>   After he became governor, Wilkinson allegedly got a
state-regulated company, Kentucky Central Life Insurance, to pay an
inflated price for a money-losing hotel he owned in Frankfort.</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky Central later went bankrupt, and the state insurance
commissioner sued Wilkinson. The former governor paid $11 million to
settle the case in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Last year a group of creditors sued to have his companies seized.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit touched off a highly public bankruptcy in which
Wilkinson admitted that his debts exceeded assets by more than $300
million. His main companies were liquidated, and many of his holdings
were auctioned.</TE>

<LD>A Granada Hills man who allegedly stabbed and beat his wife, and then
ran her over with a van outside a Tarzana post office, pleaded not
guilty to murder on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Daniel Ruben Sada, 53, was arrested Tuesday at his home, hours
after authorities found his critically injured wife lying in the
street.</LD>
<LD>   Sada, who works for the U.S. Postal Service, is being held on
$1-million bail.</LD>
<TE>   Sophie Jennie Rodriguez, 38, was attacked about 5:20 a.m. Tuesday
outside the post office in the 18700 block of Philiprimm Street. She
died Wednesday at Northridge Hospital Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez apparently was stabbed multiple times with scissors
inside the couple's van, Deputy Dist. Atty. William J. Ryder said.
She then was either pushed or fell out of the van and into the
street, where the attack continued.</TE>
<TE>   A witness told police that Sada straddled Rodriguez's body and hit
her in the head a few times with a 2-foot metal pipe, Ryder said.</TE>
<TE>   As Sada left the scene, the van he was driving "made a deliberate
swerve and ran over the body," Ryder said.</TE>
<TE>   Police have no record of domestic violence calls to the couple's
house, Ryder said.</TE>
<TE>   They have one child. If convicted, Sada faces 26 years to life in
prison.</TE>

<HD>Zacatecans Strive to End Emigration</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mexican government officials used a meeting of local immigrant
activists to push for more private-sector investment in Zacatecas,
saying that would help reduce emigration from the impoverished
region.</LD>
<LD>   The immigrants belong to Zacatecas clubs, which raise money to
improve the Mexican state. The clubs have raised $6 million in the
last three years for public works projects. But Mexican officials say
investing in infrastructure alone won't solve Zacatecas' problems.</LD>
<LD>   "If we build roads, we can't stop the emigration," said Victor
Robert Infante Gonzalez, a federal legislator who was one of 500
people attending the third Zacatecas convention in Garden Grove. "Our
people need employment. They need a reason not to leave Zacatecas."</LD>
<TE>   Zacatecas sends a higher percentage of its population, 50%, to the
United States than any Mexican state. Los Angeles has more Zacatecans
than any metropolitan area in the world. Immigrants send an estimated
$1.3 million to family members in Zacatecas every day. If they
didn't, officials say, the state's economy would collapse.</TE>
<TE>   The immigrants' role is so important that Zacatecas Gov. Ricardo
Monreal, who is expected to vie for Mexico's presidency in 2006, will
address the group when the convention continues today.</TE>
<TE>   Club members, however, focused on problems with the public works
projects they fund, which they say need greater oversight by the
Zacatecas government.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to go and supervise the works ourselves because the state
is not," said Guadalupe Gomez, a Santa Ana accountant who oversees a
federation of 55 clubs that has donated to 180 projects.</TE>
<TE>   Efrain Jimenez, a Southern California federation leader, said a
Norwalk-based club stopped fund-raising after donating $300,000 for a
1.5-mile road that deteriorated severely last year.</TE>
<TE>   Estella Valencia, a San Jose-based club member, said her club
donated $64,000 for a 1.8-mile road, only to be told later that the
money would pay for a 1.2-mile road. She pressed until 1.8 miles were
built. "Everyone kept passing the ball when we called to find out,"
Valencia said. "It took a trip to Zacatecas to find out how the
project was going."</TE>
<TE>   Club members said local and state governments, which receive 3% of
a project's total cost for oversight, should do their job or give 1%
to the clubs for travel costs. The clubs would name local residents
to committees that would provide daily oversight. Participants also
proposed a Web site to show the progress on projects.</TE>

<HD>Yankees Get Weaver in Three-Team Trade</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After the Yankees dispatched the Toronto Blue Jays, 6-3, Friday at
Yankee Stadium, New York added even more pitching for the second half
by acquiring Jeff Weaver from Detroit in a three-team trade that also
included Oakland.</LD>
<LD>   As part of the deal, the Athletics sent first baseman Carlos Pena
to the Tigers and the Yankees dealt pitcher Ted Lilly to Oakland.</LD>
<LD>   To get Weaver, the Yankees also sent the A's two top prospects:
outfielder John-Ford Griffin and right-handed pitcher Jason Arnold.
Both are 22 and were with New York's double-A team, Norwich.</LD>
<TE>   Orlando Hernandez pitched six shutout innings and Bernie Williams
and Jorge Posada homered to lead New York to its fifth consecutive
win, but the Yankees made more noise with their front office.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to seize the moment and acquire one of the best young
starters in baseball," Yankee General Manager Brian Cashman said.
"We're a pitching-oriented organization. Pitching is what's going to
make or break us."</TE>
<TE>   Weaver, a 25-year-old right-hander, is 6-8 with a 3.18 earned-run
average on a Tiger team that is 30-53. He had been linked to several
teams in trade speculation.</TE>
<TE>   Weaver joins a New York rotation that already includes Mike
Mussina, Andy Pettitte, Roger Clemens, David Wells and Hernandez--one
that is so strong that it had reduced now-injured Sterling Hitchcock
to a reliever and spot starter.</TE>
<TE>   Clemens, Hernandez and Wells are all over 35 and have missed
starts this year. Earlier Friday, the Yankees scratched Clemens from
his scheduled start against Toronto on Sunday and said Lilly would
take his place.</TE>
<TE>   Lilly, a 26-year-old left-hander, is 3-6 with a 3.40 ERA in 11
starts and two relief appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit also acquired minor league right-hander Franklin German,
and a player to be named from Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 8, Seattle 4--Torii Hunter hit a tiebreaking grand slam
to cap an eight-run seventh inning as the Twins rallied at Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   The American League Central-leading Twins ended a nine-game losing
streak against the AL West-leading Mariners and they ended a six-game
losing streak in Seattle. Eric Milton (10-6) retired the final 10
batters for his first career victory over Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 9, Boston 5--On the night they mourned the death of Ted
Williams with black armbands and a moment of silence, the Red Sox
lost at Fenway Park. Williams' retired No. 9 was etched by a lawn
mower in the left-field grass, where the Hall of Famer played, and
the center-field flag hung at half-staff. Rookie shortstop Ramon
Santiago had a career-high three RBIs to lead the Tigers.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 7, Baltimore 6--Pinch-hitter Frank Catalanotto had an RBI
single with two out in the bottom of the ninth to complete the
Rangers' rally at Arlington, Texas. Alex Rodriguez, who had a two-run
homer in the eighth inning, tied the score with an RBI groundout
earlier in the ninth. It was the first time the Rangers won when
trailing after eight innings. They were 0-35 before Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 4, Kansas City 3--John Mabry hit a two-run double in the
bottom of the ninth for the Athletics at Oakland. With the A's
trailing, 3-1, in the ninth, Jermaine Dye's RBI single scored Miguel
Tejada before Mabry's winning hit.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 4, Chicago 2--Ellis Burks homered and Danys Baez pitched
six strong innings as the Indians ended a five-game losing streak and
won at Chicago.</TE>

<HD>Angels Rise to Occasion at Just the Right Time</HD>
<DH>Baseball: It's a struggle, but Eckstein's 10th-inning,
bases-loaded grounder is enough to give Anaheim a 6-5 victory over
hapless Devil Rays.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Angel shortstop David Eckstein has certainly had more impressive
at-bats with the bases loaded.</LD>
<LD>   Yet, even with three grand slams to his name this season, Eckstein
cherished the broken-bat roller that went off the glove of Tampa Bay
third baseman Jared Sandberg on Friday. That, at last, was all it
took for the Angels to scratch out a 6-5 victory in front of 23,648
at Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   Eckstein's grounder, with the infield drawn in, scored Scott
Spiezio. The ball barely went 90 feet. The bat ended up as a souvenir
for a little girl. And the Angels moved back to within four games of
first-place Seattle in the AL West.</LD>
<TE>   Some hit.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't pretty, but it did the job," Eckstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Which is what can be said about the Angels' play throughout
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels played to their opponent's level, which was unfortunate
for them as they were playing the team with the worst record in
baseball. From the first batter, when center fielder Darin Erstad
lost a fly ball that became a double, this was going to be a
struggle.</TE>
<TE>   "We really didn't play a good ball game, but the guys kept
battling," Manager Mike Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   The Devil Rays had lost their last eight road games. They were
4-16 on the road in their last 20 games.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, though, did plenty to help the Devil Rays.</TE>
<TE>   Pitcher Aaron Sele was shaky early and gave up 12 hits, but he was
still in a position to win after leaving with a 5-3 lead in the
eighth. Ben Weber then underscored the Angel bullpen concerns by
giving up two singles and a walk, then threw a wild pitch to get the
Devil Rays even.</TE>
<TE>   "That was very disappointing," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't the only such moment.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels were uncertain in the field. Erstad lost the fly ball.
First baseman Spiezio and second baseman Jose Nieves couldn't figure
out who was to catch Toby Hall's third-inning flare, which scored a
run.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels took themselves out of opportunities. Garret Anderson
was picked off second base with none out in the seventh. Benji Gil
couldn't bunt Adam Kennedy over to third with none out in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   None of that mattered when Eckstein came to the plate in the 10th.</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio doubled to lead off and, one out later, pinch-hitter
Orlando Palmeiro singled. Jorge Fabregas walked, bringing up
Eckstein, who was one for 14 in the last four games.</TE>
<TE>   He rolled reliever Estaban Yan's 1-0 pitch like it was Bocci ball.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't been hitting the ball the way I want lately," Eckstein
said. "So any hit I get, I'll take it."</TE>
<TE>   This is a key series in Angel eyes. They are fresh from losing two
out of three to mediocre Baltimore. Another poor performance against
the Devil Rays is hardly the way the Angels want to roll into the
All-Star break, when they will then face a make-or-break stretch.</TE>
<TE>   After easing in with a four-game trip to Kansas City, the Angels
play Minnesota, Seattle, Oakland, Boston and New York in their next
20 games.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to win series," Erstad said. "We've done a pretty good
job of that so far this season. But with the string of games we have
after the All-Star break, it's important that we're playing our best
going into that."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have two more games with the Devil Rays to start
rolling. Although, according to Scioscia, that's easier said than
done.</TE>
<TE>   "Anytime you go out there, there is a pitcher who can beat you,"
Scioscia said. "Every night there is a pitcher who is capable of
shutting you down."</TE>
<TE>   That's how it has been lately. Every night there has been a
pitcher who has shut the Angels down. Of course, you won't see any of
them in Tuesday's All-Star game.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Kennedy wasn't overpowering, but kept the Angels guessing. He
gave up only two runs through six innings.</TE>
<TE>   The Angel offense finally made an appearance in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein slapped a single to right to lead off. Erstad crushed a
line drive into the right-field corner and Eckstein never broke
stride, tying the score, 3-3. Tim Salmon then beat out an infield
hit, setting up Anderson, the Angels' lone All-Star. He lined a
double to the right-field fence, scoring Erstad and Salmon.</TE>

<LD>Third baseman Troy Glaus returned to the lineup Friday, playing on
what he called a slight sprained ankle.</LD>
<LD>   Glaus was pulled from the game in the sixth inning Thursday after
aggravating the injury. He injured the ankle colliding into the
advertising panel on the fence behind the dugout while chasing a pop
fly Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm fine," Glaus said. "I'm fine. It was [Manager Mike
Scioscia's] call. I had every intention of staying in the game."</LD>
<TE>   Scioscia said he didn't want to take any chances. "Troy felt a
little twinge and rather than risk him re-injuring it we felt we
should be cautious," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus, who had the ankle tightly wrapped before Friday's game
against Tampa Bay, looked healthy in the field. He lunged to his left
to snag a line drive in the second inning.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reliever Al Levine, recovering from a sore right shoulder, threw
off level ground Thursday and is scheduled for another workout today.
He will begin throwing off the mound during the All-Star break,
Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   Levine is expected to make at least one rehabilitation start in
the minor leagues before rejoining the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   "There are things you need to find out that you can't do in a game
situation here," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia said that Levine would likely be out beyond July 12, when
he is eligible to come off the 15-day disabled list.</TE>

secure a postseason berth for the Avengers, who if the season ended
today would be seeded third in the playoffs. But Los Angeles would
like to catch Arizona, which has already clinched a playoff berth and
is currently the second seed. The Rattlers are led by veteran Arena
quarterback Sherdrick Bonner, who has completed 210 of 341 passes for
2,519 yards and 54 touchdowns. They defeated Buffalo last week,
69-42, for their third victory in four games. Los Angeles has won
three in a row, including a 58-44 decision over Toronto last week.
Avenger fullback Chad Dukes leads the league in rushing with 200

<HD>Cubs' Poor Record Costs Baylor His Job</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Chicago Cubs fired Manager Don Baylor on Friday, joining the
growing list of clubs that have changed directions in the dugout
before the All-Star break, then brought Bruce Kimm from triple-A Iowa
as interim manager.</LD>
<LD>   Baylor became the seventh manager ousted in the first half of the
season, taking the fall for the Cubs' listless performance and 34-49
record as the weekend began. The Boston Red Sox, Colorado Rockies,
Detroit Tigers, Kansas City Royals, Milwaukee Brewers and Toronto
Blue Jays have also changed managers.</LD>
<LD>   With the Cubs expected to contend for the National League Central
title, Baylor, the 1995 National League manager of the year with the
Rockies, began his third season in Chicago under the microscope, and
team executives did not like what they saw.</LD>
<TE>   "When the talent on the field does not equal the amount of
victories in the standings, that is the criteria for making a
change," said Cub President Andy MacPhail, who increased the payroll
to $76 million from about $65 million at the start of last season.
"It's not always a fair one, but that's the way we see it."</TE>
<TE>   The club also announced that Jim Hendry had been promoted to
general manager, assuming MacPhail's former player-personnel duties.
Kimm was expected to join the Cubs today, so bench coach Rene
Lachemann ran the club Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   Baylor, the American League's most valuable player with the Angels
in 1979, was 187-220 in 2 1/2 seasons in Chicago. He managed the
Rockies for six seasons, guiding them to the 1995 NL wild-card berth,
and is 627-685 overall.</TE>
<TE>   The Cubs were 88-74 in 2001 and led the division most of the way
until September but were 12 1/2 games out of first place after
Thursday's 5-1 loss to the Braves. Many veteran players have
struggled, contributing to the club's ranking 14th among 16 NL teams
in batting at .242.</TE>
<TE>   "We just didn't win enough games," Cub first baseman Fred McGriff
said. "You've got to win games in this profession. We went out there
and played for him, we just didn't win games."</TE>

<LD>New York Yankee shortstop Derek Jeter sat out Friday's series opener
against Toronto because of his injured leg but could play against the
Blue Jays this weekend.</LD>
<LD>   The five-time All-Star shortstop came out of Thursday's game
against the Cleveland Indians after he bruised his left lower leg and
sprained his knee on a hard, takeout slide by the Indians' John
McDonald.</LD>
<LD>   Roger Clemens was scratched from his scheduled Sunday start for
the Yankees because of an injured right leg. Clemens left Tuesday's
win over Cleveland after 95 pitches because of cramping in his leg.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chicago Cub right fielder Sammy Sosa missed Friday's game against
the Braves because of a family emergency. Sosa flew back to Chicago
earlier in the day and isn't expected to return to Atlanta for the
final two games of the series. It was the first game Sosa had missed
this season.... San Francisco Giant outfielder Marvin Benard will be
sidelined for at least two months and could be lost for the season
after surgery on his injured left knee uncovered far more cartilage
damage than expected.</TE>

<LD>Ted Williams was at a card show in the 1980s when a scout and a
fellow named Vince Piazza chatted with him about Piazza's teenage
son.</LD>
<LD>   Later, Williams went by the Piazza house in Norristown, Pa., to
watch young Mike take some swings in the backyard batting cage.</LD>
<LD>   "He watched Mike's swing and he said, 'If this kid is swinging
this well now and he's only 16, I guarantee you that he will hit in
the major leagues,' " Vince Piazza told The Times in 1993--the year
Mike Piazza was National League rookie of the year as a Dodger.</LD>
<TE>   Before he left that day, Williams advised the youngster to read
Ted's book on hitting.</TE>
<TE>   Piazza already had, so Williams inscribed it:</TE>
<TE>   "To my friend Mike, from Ted Williams. Don't forget me. Someday
I'll be looking for you to get tickets to a game."</TE>
<TE>   More Ted and Mike: Piazza and Williams saw each other many more
times over the years, and in 1997, Piazza received the Ted Williams
Award, honoring him as one of the season's most productive hitters.</TE>
<TE>   "Ted Williams, more than anything, was a great American, in
addition to being a great player," Piazza said Friday before the New
York Mets played the Florida Marlins. "He was my idol, for what he
stood for. Probably without his input and advice, I wouldn't be where
I am today. I will miss him deeply."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Williams hit 521 home runs. What was his
single-season high?</TE>
<TE>   Going soft? British media have, at times, lived with the
reputation for being especially critical of fellow countrymen.</TE>
<TE>   So when Tim Henman lost in the Wimbledon semifinals to top-seeded
Lleyton Hewitt, the carnage to follow was predictable, right? Not so
fast.</TE>
<TE>   The Guardian wrote: "There will be those who disparage Henman....
Most of them would not know a topspin lob from a five-string banjo."</TE>
<TE>   The Times of London wrote: "Nothing came Henman's way easily and
nothing was what he ended up with. But never was it for lack of his
own fighting spirit."</TE>
<TE>   It figures: Ron Rapoport in the Chicago Sun-Times: "The latest
manager of the Atlantic City Surf of the independent Atlantic Coast
League is--Mitch Williams.</TE>
<TE>   "Wild Thing took over for Tommy Helms this week, and the
last-place Surf lost his debut on, ahem, a wild pitch in the 10th
inning."</TE>
<TE>   Another option: Mike Bianchi in the Orlando Sentinel: "Arizona
Cardinal safety Pat Tillman is quitting the NFL to join the military.
Was this necessary? I mean, if Tillman really wanted to be surrounded
by hostility and animosity, he would have just signed with the
Ravens."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: A league-leading 43 in 1949.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Takeru Kobayashi of Japan successfully defended his
title in the Nathan's Famous Fourth of July world hot dog-eating
contest at Coney Island, but some competitors cried foul.</TE>
<TE>   He blew away (or ate away) the field on Thursday, but the winner
seemed to have had what event chairman George Shea termed "a
Roman-method incident" (visible regurgitation)--grounds for automatic
disqualification.</TE>
<TE>   After Shea (ugh) reviewed the tapes, no violation was found.</TE>

<HD>It's 31 for Gagne With New Flavor</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Closer escapes from bases-loaded, no-out jam to
save Dodgers' 6-5 victory over Cardinals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>There were the first-and-third, one-out jams he escaped in San
Francisco on April 11 and against Boston on June 22, and the
runner-on-third, no-out jam he got out of in Baltimore on June 9, but
none of those rivaled the degree of difficulty of Eric Gagne's latest
logic-defying feat.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodger closer escaped a bases-loaded, no-out jam in the ninth
inning Friday night to preserve a 6-5 come-from-behind victory over
the St. Louis Cardinals before 41,447 in the outdoor sauna that was
Busch Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Gagne fielded Placido Polanco's come-backer and started a 1-2-3
double play, then retired Jim Edmonds with runners on second and
third on a fly ball for his major league-leading 31st save.</LD>
<TE>   And now, the question is: What does he do for an encore? Get out
of a bases-loaded, no-out jam with one arm tied behind his back? Or
wearing a blindfold?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if you can top that one," catcher Paul Lo Duca said.
"Maybe if he did it in the playoffs or World Series or something."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers, who ended a two-game losing streak, overcame a 4-1
second-inning deficit by scoring twice in the third inning and three
times in the sixth off Cardinal right-hander Matt Morris, a National
League All-Star.</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Green's double and Eric Karros' two-run single highlighted
the third, and Mark Grudzielanek (double), Cesar Izturis (sacrifice
fly), pinch-hitter Alex Cora (game-tying RBI double) and Dave Roberts
(go-ahead RBI single) keyed the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Guillermo Mota, who is emerging as a bullpen stopper, threw two
perfect innings of relief, Jesse Orosco and Paul Quantrill combined
to retire the Cardinals in the eighth, and Gagne, who suffered his
second blown save of the season Wednesday night at Arizona, started
the ninth with a one-run lead.</TE>
<TE>   Pinch-hitter Miguel Cairo greeted Gagne with a single to left. St.
Louis Manager Tony La Russa gambled, sending Cairo on a hit-and-run,
and Kerry Robinson lined a single into the left-field corner.</TE>
<TE>   Cairo beat Dodger outfielder Brian Jordan's throw to third, and
though replays showed Cairo's foot came off the bag when third
baseman Adrian Beltre applied the tag, umpire Mike Dimuro ruled Cairo
safe. Robinson took second on the throw, and Fernando Vina was walked
intentionally to load the bases.</TE>
<TE>   Gagne fooled Polanco badly with a first-pitch changeup and
followed that with a nasty inside fastball. A jammed Polanco hit a
chopper back to Gagne, who tossed to Lo Duca, whose relay to first
beat Polanco for the double play.</TE>
<TE>   "That play is tougher than people think," Lo Duca said. "You're
throwing the ball 98 mph, and then you have to lob one in there.
[Gagne] made a great play."</TE>
<TE>   Up stepped Edmonds, who has 17 home runs and 44 runs batted in on
the season. The Dodgers had a choice: Do they walk the left-handed
Edmonds and pitch to cleanup batter Albert Pujols, who had a two-run
homer in the first inning and an RBI double in the fifth off Dodger
starter Odalis Perez (10-4)? Or do they go after Edmonds?</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jim Tracy came to the mound, but Gagne couldn't tell you
what he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't really listening," Gagne said. "I was focused on getting
[Edmonds] out. I didn't want to face Pujols, even though Edmonds is a
great hitter too."</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca agreed. "I wanted to go after Edmonds, without giving in
to him," he said. "If we go 2-and-0 or 3-and-0, maybe we walk him and
go after Pujols."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy didn't need to be convinced. "I felt we had to go after the
guy at the plate," he said. "That was the direction we were going."</TE>
<TE>   Edmonds took ball one and fouled off two pitches. Gagne was in a
similar situation Wednesday night, getting ahead of Arizona's Quinton
McCracken, 0-and-2, before McCracken poked a changeup to right for a
two-run triple that scored the tying and go-ahead runs.</TE>
<TE>   But on a steamy, 96-degree evening in St. Louis, Gagne and Lo Duca
decided to stick with the heat. Gagne threw a 98-mph fastball down
the middle, but Edmonds got under it, lifting a towering fly ball
that finally found a home in Jordan's glove, just in front of the
wall.</TE>
<TE>   "He has shown time and time again that he has the poise and guts
of a burglar," Tracy said of Gagne, who has a 1.42 earned-run
average.</TE>
<TE>   "He's unbelievable--I can't remember a guy who's been that
dominant for 86 games," Lo Duca said. "And no one [complained] about
the pitch I called. I wanted to beat him with a fastball. I didn't
want [Edmonds] to flick his bat at something."</TE>

<HD>Cardinals Thinking About Baseball Again</HD>

<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>The Cardinals were in a daze the week after pitcher Darryl Kile's
June 22 death, losing five of their first seven games after the
tragedy, but as they've begun to come to grips with their loss, the
wins have returned--St. Louis won four in a row before dropping
Friday night's game to the Dodgers, 6-5.</LD>
<LD>   "We're doing better as a group--we're just getting through it,"
center fielder Jim Edmonds said. "I don't think we're looking to
Darryl for inspiration, but it's brought the team closer. All we can
do is stick together."</LD>
<LD>   The first three days after Kile's death were the hardest, Edmonds
said, far more difficult than anything he could have envisioned.</LD>
<TE>   "This team is so close, and to see tears in your teammates' eyes
... that was tough," Edmonds said. "Just when you'd start thinking of
something else besides Darryl, you'd see [reliever] Dave Veres or
[pitcher] Woody Willliams start tearing up. It was like losing a
brother or sister."</TE>
<TE>   As emotional and heartbreaking as the June 26 memorial service for
Kile in Busch Stadium was, it did wonders for the healing process.
Music returned to the Cardinal clubhouse, and players began focusing
a little more on baseball.</TE>
<TE>   "After the service, we had some closure--it gave us a sense that
we could move on, concentrate on our jobs," Edmonds said. "Darryl
wasn't a guy who didn't want to play. If this had happened to someone
else, he would have been the guy in the middle of the clubhouse
saying, 'Let's go.' "</TE>
<TE>   Kile's No. 57 jersey, his cap, batting helmet, spikes and batting
gloves remain in his locker in the St. Louis clubhouse, and the
Cardinals are wearing black patches with Kile's initials and number
on their sleeves. Kile is gone; he will not be forgotten.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to see people healing from some very tragic
circumstances," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said. "But you know
something? You learn how to cope with it, how to get beyond it, but
it never goes away."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dodger General Manager Dan Evans is being praised in both local
and national publications for all of his deals and acquisitions that
have helped the Dodgers this season.</TE>
<TE>   Hard to believe this is the same GM who was shown up at last
December's winter meetings by Cincinnati GM Jim Bowden, who refused
to begin a meeting with the Dodgers until senior vice president Tom
Lasorda was in attendance.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if Evans now commands more respect, Tracy said, "He should
have back then, and if he didn't, I feel sorry for the party that
treated him lightly. He believes in his convictions, and he believes
in himself. What he's doing is very special."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dodger right-hander Darren Dreifort, rehabilitating from elbow
reconstruction surgery, threw 36 pitches in the bullpen and 30 more
during live batting practice Friday afternoon, a session that left
Tracy "very encouraged." Tracy said there's a good chance Dreifort,
who began throwing hard sliders Friday, will begin a minor league
rehabilitation assignment within a month.</TE>
<TE>   "It's coming along," said Dreifort, who hasn't pitched in more
than a year. "It hasn't been a roller coaster. It's been a steady
progression, and that's how you want it to be."</TE>

<HD>Sorenstam Has Share of Lead</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a tearful farewell from Nancy Lopez and a shocking departure by
Karrie Webb, the U.S. Women's Open shifted into survival mode Friday.</LD>
<LD>   To no one's surprise, Annika Sorenstam handled it better than
anyone.</LD>
<LD>   Sorenstam was the only player to break par on a hot, blustery
afternoon at Prairie Dunes in Hutchinson, Kan., shooting a one-under
69 that gave her a share of the lead with Juli Inkster and Laura
Diaz.</LD>
<TE>   Sorenstam surged to the top with three birdies on her final six
holes. Sorenstam and Inkster each made a bogey on the final hole and
finished at 139.</TE>
<TE>   Michele Redman had six birdies in a one-under 69 in the morning
and was at 140, along with Shani Waugh of Australia (73).</TE>
<TE>   Webb, trying to win the U.S. Women's Open for the third time in a
row, won't be around to see the finish.</TE>
<TE>   After opening with a 79, the best she could manage was a 73. She
missed the cut for the first time in 56 tournaments and was leaving
Prairie Dunes about the time Sorenstam, Inkster and Diaz were teeing
off.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez, who was playing in her 25th and final Open, finished with a
79.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether you are winning or whether you are losing, it's always a
thrill to walk up 18 and feel the love that the people have for not
just me, but for the LPGA," Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Veteran John Cook made birdies on three of his last four holes to
take a two-stroke lead after the second round of the Western Open at
Lemont, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   His six-under 66 tied for the second-best score of the day, and he
hasn't had a bogey since his first hole of the tournament. At 133,
he's 11 under par.</TE>
<TE>   "I do savor these days, because I know I can still be
competitive," said Cook, 44, who tied for second at The Memorial in
May. "You get a golf course like this, I've got just as good a chance
as anyone to win."</TE>
<TE>   Stuart Appleby and Vijay Singh sat at the top of the leaderboard,
waiting for someone to make a move. Jonathan Byrd did, chipping in
for an eagle on the par-five 15th in a 68 to tie Appleby and Singh at
nine-under 135. Then Cook blew by them.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tom Jenkins tied the course record with an eight-under 63 for a
two-stroke lead after the opening round of the Canada Senior Open at
LaSalle, Ontario.</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins, whose round included an eagle, eight birdies and two
bogeys, missed a birdie putt and a chance at a course record, at No.
18 at the Essex Golf and Country Club.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm certainly happy with a 63," Jenkins said. "I came here and
haven't been feeling well the last two or three days, I didn't play
any practice round until yesterday."</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins, who won the tournament in 2000, held a two-stroke lead
over Canadian Gar Hamilton.</TE>

<LD>Nearly nine years ago, trainer Richard Mandella had a memorable
Breeders' Cup Day.</LD>
<LD>   Not only did the Hall of Famer win Breeders' Cup races with Phone
Chatter and Kotashaan, he won two other stakes on the undercard at
Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>   If all goes well today, Bobby Frankel could win seven stakes
around the country.</LD>
<TE>   Besides having likely favorites Megahertz and Surya in the
$500,000 American Oaks and $100,000 Royal Heroine, respectively, at
Hollywood Park, Frankel also has Blu Air Force in the $300,000 Triple
Bend Breeders' Cup Handicap in Inglewood, Lido Palace in the $500,000
Suburban Handicap and Drippingindiamonds in the $200,000 Prioress at
Belmont Park, Denon in the $500,000 United Nations Handicap at
Monmouth Park and defending champion Euchre in the $400,000
Cornhusker Breeders' Cup Handicap at Prairie Meadows.</TE>
<TE>   A sweep of those races wouldn't be a shock because all of the
horses are no worse than strong contenders. Blu Air Force will be
trying to upset Kona Gold in his first race on the dirt. Lido Palace
will almost certainly will be second choice to Macho Uno in the
Suburban, and Drippingindiamonds, who will be making her first start
for Frankel after a private purchase, is unbeaten in three starts.
Denon and Euchre will probably be favored in their respective races
in New Jersey and Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   The United Nations and Suburban will make up two-thirds of the
National Thoroughbred Racing Assn.'s pick three. Sandwiched between
those two stakes is the $200,000 Stars and Stripes Breeders' Cup Turf
Handicap at Arlington Park.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The fifth at Hollywood Park is only a $10,000
claimer, but it has a lot of significance. It is the first race of a
pick six that has a guaranteed pool of $1 million and the fourth race
in the Churchill Downs simulcast network pick four.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: The 15 original entrants in the American Oaks. The
3-year-old fillies are a combined 41 of 103.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Icy Waquoit. The gray gelding, who will be favored in
the 12th at Pleasanton, has lost his last four at 9-5, 6-5, 1-1 and
6-5 odds.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: Let's try a $36 pick six: use Valiant Vision,
Ancient Traveler and Diamond Machine in the fifth, single Valediction
in the sixth, Megahertz and Dublino in the seventh, Blu Air Force,
Kona Gold and Mellow Fellow in the eighth, single Surya in the ninth
and Wheater in the 10th.</TE>
<TE>   Winners (through Thursday): Previous day/meet total: 3/135. Money:
Previous day/meet total: $15/$771.40. Total money bet: $894.</TE>

<HD>Strike Date Could Be Coming</HD>

<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After months of doomsday speculation, public relations campaigns and
sniping from both sides, the most significant strike call of the
Major League Baseball season looms as the union meets Monday in
Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   Frustrated by lagging negotiations on a new bargaining agreement
and concerned about the unilateral implementation of new work rules
after the World Series, the Major League Baseball Players Assn. has
chosen the All-Star break as a time to turn up the heat on team
owners.</LD>
<LD>   The union thinks that setting a date for a work stoppage, most
likely in September, might spur more serious bargaining sessions
because the players would be poised to deliver a significant economic
blow to an industry that last year generated a record $3.55 billion
in revenue.</LD>
<TE>   Sources from both sides say some progress has been made on three
core issues: increased revenue sharing among the clubs; a luxury tax
on teams with high payrolls; and the format of a worldwide draft.
Still, there is little to indicate that an agreement is imminent.
This season has been played even though a five-year pact expired
after the last World Series.</TE>
<TE>   There has been no movement on a fourth issue--testing for illegal
substances, including steroids. The union opposes random drug testing
on privacy grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Also clouding the process is the union's grievance on
contraction--the owners' ability to eliminate teams without union
approval. Arbitrator Shyam Das is expected to rule on the matter in
the next month or two, and either side could be awarded a major
bargaining chip for negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball has had eight work stoppages since 1972, the last
spanning 232 days and costing owners an estimated $900 million in
revenue, players about $350 million in salaries, and resulting in the
cancellation of the 1994 World Series and a shortened '95 season.</TE>
<TE>   Bud Selig, baseball's commissioner, has vowed not to lock out
players through the end of postseason play, so a strike is risky for
the union in the court of public opinion. Players are wary of being
perceived as greedy and taking the blame for shutting down the game.</TE>
<TE>   Owners seem equally uneasy. The union historically has pounded
them in labor disputes, capitalizing when owners have split into
factions and lost their resolve to back their own negotiators.</TE>
<TE>   Determined to maintain a united front this time, Selig recently
lifted a gag order--and the threat of a $1 million fine--he had
imposed on owners and other team executives. He now wants ownership's
message out, and recently outlined the new policy in a league-wide
memo, with instructions to owners about sticking to a script.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger Chairman Bob Daly, who became familiar with labor
negotiations when he was studio boss at Warner Bros., stuck close to
that party line when he said an agreement must be reached because of
what's at stake.</TE>
<TE>   "Baseball has financial problems that have to be adjusted, but we
should be able to work something out with the union to make [an
agreement] happen," he said. "The thought that we would maybe be
sitting here this September and have no baseball, after what we all
went through last September and what baseball did to help the country
heal a little bit, and the way we were praised for doing it, I just
think it's so shortsighted on everyone's part.</TE>
<TE>   "The fans deserve a playoff and World Series. To lose it again
would be terrible. Both parties have to be responsible enough to sit
in a room and act like adults and make a deal. [Owners are] clearly
behind Bud as far as the idea that we believe that adjustments have
to be made and parity is our No. 1 issue. His job is to get us to a
better financial situation."</TE>
<TE>   Negotiators, who took a break in conjunction with the three-day
All-Star break, are scheduled to return to the table Thursday amid
much uncertainty and rancor that figures to increase. A long
interruption in play would cost owners--who face $1.7 billion in debt
on new stadiums and claim operating losses of $500 million last
year--hundreds of millions in lost revenue, players millions in lost
salaries and affect everyone from stadium workers to companies that
support the game's expansive daily operation.</TE>
<TE>   All of baseball risks ending a renaissance. Although attendance is
down 5%, it is expected to top a healthy 70 million this season. It
took a while, but buoyed by Cal Ripken's record for consecutive games
played, the 1998 home run chase between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa,
and Barry Bonds' record-setting homer barrage of last season, fans
have returned to the game in droves even though many swore off their
allegiance after the last strike.</TE>
<TE>   That's why neither side wants to be blamed for another work
stoppage and why both sides have been courting major media outlets
with their spin on the story. Selig and his top negotiators met with
editors and reporters from some of the nation's largest newspapers,
including The Times. Union chief Don Fehr responded with his own
tour, making himself available to reporters.</TE>
<TE>   "There is always a danger of alienating fans in a situation like
this," Angel player rep Scott Schoeneweis said. "But the fans don't
have the information we have a lot of the times. There are things
that may force us to do this."</TE>
<TE>   Rob Manfred, baseball's vice president of labor relations, said
owners are "disappointed" by speculation the union might set a strike
date Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "We've made many proposals, and received no response before a
meeting as important as the one that they have scheduled on Monday,"
he said. "We really made an effort over the last two weeks to move
the negotiations. We were the ones who brought the core economic
issues back to the table by making the proposals.</TE>
<TE>   "In addition, we did some of the little things that are often
significant in terms of moving a negotiation. There is no
justification or excuse for the union setting a strike date at this
point and time. None."</TE>
<TE>   Fehr declined comment on the agenda for the meeting, which player
representatives from the clubs are expected to attend. However, union
sources confirm that during an ongoing tour of clubs Fehr told
players the issue of a strike date, and a possible vote, would top
the day's to-do list.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Lo Duca, the Dodgers' player rep, will not attend the meeting
because he's been told Fehr is coming to Los Angeles to meet with the
entire team soon after the All-Star break.</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca has heard several rumors about a strike date--possibly in
August, perhaps at the end of the regular season, and maybe none at
all. "We'll know after the meeting," he said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   If the union sets a September date, players would receive almost a
full year of salary and owners almost a full year of attendance,
though the owners would stand to lose a significant amount of
postseason television revenue. An August date would cost players more
in salaries, and also hit owners hard because it could wipe out
almost two months of attendance and potentially big crowds for teams
in playoff contention. Another option would be for players to walk
out just before the playoffs, but they might be reluctant to go that
route because of the inevitable fallout from the public.</TE>
<TE>   Fehr was eager to discuss his view of the negotiations, saying
management is up to old tricks.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a little tired of hearing that," Fehr said in response to
Manfred's statement that the owners appear more interested in a deal
than the players. "What they do is they come up with a couple of
things and then announce that they're waiting to hear a response.
They know it's not that simple.</TE>
<TE>   "They know we've been waiting for meaningful responses from them,
in many cases, for months and months. We went, for example, from the
end of June until December before they responded to a proposal that
we made. They waited six to seven weeks to respond to a proposal that
we made on economics. So when you hear something like that, it's
entirely propaganda and it ought to be treated as such."</TE>
<TE>   Revenue sharing has ignited the most heated debate. The sides
disagree on the percentage of revenue that should be shared and the
method of distribution. Owners are determined to increase revenue
sharing because they believe disparity in local revenue is
responsible for the competitive cap between big- and small-market
teams. The union contends that poor management is a bigger factor
than owners concede.</TE>
<TE>   The basic concept of revenue sharing is that the entire sport
benefits if high-revenue clubs share their profits to enable low-end
teams to spend more money on players, increasing competitive balance.
Postseason performance is the foundation of the argument for more
revenue sharing.</TE>
<TE>   Only five clubs from the two lowest payroll groups participated in
the playoffs from 1995-2001, and all lost in the first round. And of
the 224 postseason games played during that seven-year span, teams
from the top two payroll groups went 219-5. The 1998 San Diego Padres
were the only club from a lower payroll group to reach a World
Series.</TE>
<TE>   Selig has persuaded owners to publicly support increased revenue
sharing, but some big-market owners are concerned that the money that
goes to some teams winds up in the pockets of owners--or is ticketed
to pay debt--rather than being spent on players. Almost $166 million
was shared among the teams in 2001, and about $187 million is
projected this season.</TE>
<TE>   Presently, every club contributes 20% of its net local revenue,
and 75% of the total figure is equally distributed among the 30
teams. Only clubs below the revenue average receive the remaining
25%, with the teams the most below average getting the biggest
shares. The system protects the wealthiest clubs, which retain 80% of
their revenue, and benefits lower-revenue clubs at the expense of the
middle-of-the-pack teams.</TE>
<TE>   In the owners' new straight-pool proposal, the amount of shared
revenue would increase significantly. Every team would contribute
half its revenue, after ballpark expenses, and receive an equal share
of the total pool. Based on their industry-high local revenue of
$217.8 million last season, the Yankees would have contributed $108.9
million to the pot. The Montreal Expos, who were last at $9.8
million, would have put in $4.9 million and received the same payout
as the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   The union has proposed increasing revenue sharing from 20% to
22.5% and distributing it in a split-pool plan. The union plan would
produce less revenue sharing and the wealthiest clubs would not lose
as much of their local revenue as under a straight pool. The union
favors a split pool because the teams in the top tier pay less and
the clubs in the middle--the ones that drive players'
salaries--receive more. The union believes that the more those clubs
have to share revenue, the less they might spend on salaries.</TE>
<TE>   Owners are also seeking to provide Selig with a discretionary pool
of $85 million, which could be used to help struggling organizations
remain afloat, although Selig recently said he would no longer bail
out teams. How the pool would be funded is another source of
contention.</TE>
<TE>   The discussion about a luxury tax on payrolls has changed
recently. Owners had sought to establish a 50% tax on all payroll
over $98 million, but now appear willing to gradually reach that
percentage over several seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "We proposed a transition rule that would moderate the effect of
the [luxury tax] during the first couple of years for clubs that had
very high preexisting commitments," Manfred said. "For clubs like the
Dodgers, which have a high payroll they can't get out of, it would
moderate the effect of [the tax]."</TE>
<TE>   Owners would prefer to implement a "hard" salary cap such as the
NFL system, which prohibits teams from exceeding a certain payroll
figure, but the baseball union--the most powerful in sports--would
never accept that. The NBA has a salary cap and luxury tax, but the
NHL has no such restrictions on payroll.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball owners consider a luxury tax to be essential for
restraint on payroll growth. They are confident it would serve as a
moderate form of a salary cap, and are worried that increased revenue
sharing without a luxury tax would not slow skyrocketing salaries.</TE>
<TE>   Economics are a big part of the worldwide draft issue as well. The
union wants a draft to occur in two phases, international and
American, creating two sets of first-round draft picks and more big
bonuses. It also wants to reduce both drafts to only eight rounds
from the current 50-round format, creating more free agents.</TE>
<TE>   Owners and players are far apart on drug testing, with recent
controversy about steroid use only increasing the chasm. Unlike the
Olympics, NBA and NFL, baseball does not have a testing program for
steroids. The issue has been a source of friction in talks,
especially since retired league MVPs Ken Caminiti and Jose Canseco
recently alleged that the use of performance-enhancing substances is
rampant in baseball. Owners are not willing to capitulate on drug
testing to complete a deal, a management source said.</TE>

<LD>Even on his way out the door, Pete Dalis [July 1] has proven himself
incapable of speaking without tripping over his tongue.</LD>
<LD>   First, he pays not one but two back-handed and ill-advised
compliments to his basketball coach and football coach and claims he
could have hired better coaches if only he had the money.</LD>
<LD>   Ironic, isn't it, that money was no object when Dalis solicited
the services of the over-priced Rick Pitino and then lied about this
solicitation to his basketball coach and the press, undermining the
efforts of Coach Steve Lavin and the entire basketball program in the
process. Funny, isn't it that money was no object when Dalis pursued
Gary Barnett with a huge financial package after Terry Donahue's
retirement? Sorry, Pete, but pleading poverty doesn't cut it.</LD>
<TE>   Frankly, there's nothing wrong with UCLA's very capable head
coaches. It's UCLA athletic administration that was in dire need of a
wake-up call during the Dalis era.</TE>

<LD>While playing for the hated San Francisco Giants, Bob Brenly never
hid his dislike for the Dodgers. Now, as the manager of a team that
has become almost as arrogant and nauseating to Dodger fans, Brenly
has reaffirmed his commitment to sticking it to the Dodgers whenever
possible. Paul Lo Duca is batting almost 40 points higher than each
of Brenly's two NL catcher All-Star selections: his Damian Miller and
Benito Santiago.</LD>
<LD>   I never thought I would hate a team as much as I hate the Giants.
But this clinches it. C'mon, Dodgers. Win this NL West title, if for
no other reason than to prevent this homer-turned-manager from
pulling the same garbage next year.</LD>

<TE>   Life has been sweet as a Dodger fan so far this year. The cancer
has been excised. They're winning with regularity and T.J. Simers has
been eating a lot of crow. Then there was last week's letter from
Orange County. "Oooo, the Dodgers are so lucky! (sniff) There's no
way they're going to keep this up!" Man, how old is this guy? I can
see him walking away from losing a contest of some sort--shoulders
slumped, feet shuffling, head down, nose running--muttering to
himself how lucky the other guy was.</TE>

<TE>   I don't expect Mr. Michael of Dana Point [Viewpoint, June 29] to
listen to reason, but perhaps he should take a look in a mirror that
the Dodgers certainly don't need.</TE>
<TE>   The 1988 Dodger team was a team, not 24 or 25 individuals as
Dodger teams led (or rather not led) by Gary Sheffield over the past
several years have been. This year's team maintains that same
camaraderie. They believe in one another and in their manager.</TE>
<TE>   It would be just as absurd for me to predict that the Dodgers'
winning will continue for the season as Mr. Michael's prediction that
it won't. However, today the Dodgers are in first place and have one
of the best records in baseball. The facts speak for themselves.</TE>

<TE>   To the contrary, King George, Raul Mondesi is the disease! There
is not enough radiation or chemotherapy in the Big Apple to ward off
that scourge on society. Forgive me, King George, I nearly forgot
your brilliant signings of such good citizens as Darryl Strawberry

<LD>In her July 4 column, "Men's Game Desperately Needs a Strong

and one of a new breed of "bash the ball as hard as possible"
players. If Pucin knew anything about tennis, she'd know that Hew-
itt's game is actually very similar to that of Andre Agassi. Besides,
why is she so upset about hard-hitting players in the men's game, but
cheers the Williams sisters' domination of the women's game?</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Bravo to Bill Plaschke's column about John Roseboro. Time has allowed
us to forget the greats of baseball. Unless someone's record is
broken, little is heard until the obituary is written.</LD>
<LD>   I am a lifelong Dodger fan. I was too young to really appreciate
Campy and I was always impressed watching Yeager and Scioscia call a
game in the '70s and '80s. But my teen years in the '60s, that was
when John Roseboro was synonymous with the name Dodgers.</LD>
<LD>   My thoughts and prayers go to John Roseboro and his family. We all
thank you for many years of pleasure watching the Dodgers. It is
especially heartening to hear of the loyalty from the other Dodgers,
even Juan Marichal, who may have ended his career with the Dodgers,
but will forever be a Giant. To all the greedy, self-impressed
All-Stars of today, a big lesson in class from one of the Dodger
greats. Good luck, John, and thank you.</LD>

<TE>   Johnny Roseboro had a quiet dignity in his approach to the game.
The photo of him sitting next to Roy Campanella brought to memory the
reason for my childhood love of the game. No fancy equipment, only
small gloves that molded to the dimensions of the catcher's hand over
time, and those plain dusty black shoes with the metal cleats. I
loved the game then; now I merely casually glance at the standings,
and read some articles now and again. Fortunately, the terrific
article about Roseboro sparked my interest.</TE>
<TE>   If a fan from the distant past can say anything to John Roseboro,
it would be that while the count may be two strokes against you, I
for one trust that you will always be ahead of the count.</TE>

<LD>My sincerest appreciation to Larry Stewart and The Times for giving
the death of Irv Kaze such prominent coverage. I knew Irv Kaze for
nearly 40 years, going back to when he was public relations director
for the Angels. I have never heard anybody say a single bad thing
about him, and I can't say that about anyone else I know.</LD>

Unfortunately, he was right. He will be missed.</TE>

<LD>Brazil's coronation as the World Cup champion for the fifth time
leaves us with futbol withdrawal for four years.</LD>
<LD>   The World Cup brought us such outstanding performances as
Rivaldo's impersonation of Vlade Divac on the pitch. Korea/Japan 2002
also proved that the Italian Mafia no longer can intimidate and
influence the outcome of games.</LD>
<LD>   Lastly, it showed that futbol is the cruelest of sports in that
the best team doesn't always win. Eliminating subpar referees and
linesmen would be a good start and should ensure that the best team,
unassisted, will win in Germany 2006. You can call me bitter as long
as you realize that I am right.</LD>

<TE>   Need proof that we Americans don't give a flip about soccer? Look
no further. Reading Monday's sports section, I quickly passed over
the World Cup story, (Congratulations, Portugal, I knew you could do
it!) and hurried to Page 2, to find out the results of the greasy
pole contest from Gloucester, Mass. If you gave every sports fan in
America a choice of watching the World Cup final or the contest from
Gloucester ... well, guys, all I can say is, does my cable provider
carry the Greasy Pole Channel?</TE>

<TE>   In response to the negativity that soccer seems to spawn every
four years, this soccer fan offers the following reply:</TE>
<TE>   1. Though a lot of people, even in this country, like the sport,
nobody is forcing it down your throat. I know of no Times article or
ESPN story that either states or implies that you are inferior
because you do not like soccer.</TE>
<TE>   2. Just because I and other fans like the sport does not mean that
you have to feel the need to tell us, at every opportunity, that you
don't like it.</TE>
<TE>   3. Next time the World Cup rolls around, please just turn the page
in the Sports section or change the channel when you see a soccer
story and spare us your diatribe. You do it with other sports you
don't care about, so it shouldn't be that hard.</TE>

<TE>   It was a while coming--not until the World Cup was over--but Mike
Penner [July 2] finally came around to the truth that millions have
long known: FIFA uses its choice of referees and linesmen for the
individual matches in the World Cup to influence the results and
further political ends.</TE>
<TE>   FIFA's immediate political goal has been to expand the
fanaticism--and thus the organization's power and reach--beyond the
traditional European and South American bastions to Asia, Africa and
beyond. FIFA's manipulations were wildly successful at Korea/Japan,
bringing down soccer powers early and carrying surprise teams to new
heights.</TE>
<TE>   Passion and hopes have been stirred in many nations that saw none
before, but at what price? The integrity of the World Cup has been
dealt a near mortal blow. The only question now is whether FIFA,
which must be reformed, can recover its image in time for Germany
2006.</TE>

<TE>   Wasn't it Darwin who described the human hand as "Nature's most
useful tool"? No disrespect intended toward soccer fans, but
inventing a game that prohibits touching the ball with one's hands,
but encourages bouncing it off one's face, makes about as much sense
as lowball poker.</TE>

<KH>TED WILLIAMS 1918-2002</KH>
<HD>The Scientist of Hitting</HD>
<DH>Statistics Don't Tell Just How Splendid The Kid Really Was</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSS NEWHAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Traded by the Angels during the previous off-season, second baseman
Jerry Remy was in his first spring with the Boston Red Sox. It was
1978, and he was sitting in the clubhouse in Winter Haven, Fla., when
Ted Williams walked in, stopped in front of a mirror, and said to no
one and anyone: "I'm looking at the greatest hitter who ever lived."</LD>
<LD>   Remy laughed as he recalled the incident Friday and said, "I
certainly wasn't going to argue, and no one else did either."</LD>
<LD>   Nor would I. Not then, not now.</LD>
<TE>   Williams was who he said he was, the hitter he vowed to be every
season, the hitter he set out to be when he was carrying a bat to
school every day in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   I know the litany. Pete Rose collected more hits, Ty Cobb hit for
a higher career average, Henry Aaron and 10 other players slugged and
continue to slug (in the case of Barry Bonds) more home runs.</TE>
<TE>   All deserve due respect, but it was Williams who claimed that
hitting a baseball is the hardest thing to do in sports and then made
it look almost easy while doing it better than anyone ever did. It
was Williams who brought "The Science of Hitting" to life even before
he wrote the book, compiling a statistical legacy that speaks louder
than the man himself did.</TE>
<TE>   In the process, during a 19-year career interrupted twice by
military obligations, over the 83 years that ended with his death
Friday, he became bigger than life.</TE>
<TE>   His sometimes stormy relationship with fans and reporters as a
Boston Red Sox left fielder mellowed into mythical reverence.</TE>
<TE>   He was the Kid, the Splendid Splinter and Teddy Ballgame.</TE>
<TE>   How many players have three nicknames, a fourth if you include the
Splendid Spitter, which he received in 1956 when he expectorated in
every direction after being booed at Fenway Park for misplaying a fly
ball.</TE>
<TE>   Williams once claimed that he could hear a single boo, just as he
could single out the stitches on a fastball, could actually see the
ball hit the bat, and even when he bowed out with a home run in his
final at-bat, leaving to Fenway cheers, he still refused to tip his
cap.</TE>
<TE>   He could be cantankerous, temperamental, arrogant, self-absorbed.
He did not tolerate less-than-total dedication, a trait that would
undermine his attempt at managing just as his admitted immaturity
helped fuel his early feuds with the competitive New England media
that picked faults with his defense, his refusal to compromise his
strike zone or any slight failure once he had raised expectations to
unprecedented levels.</TE>
<TE>   That feud may have cost Williams the 1947 most-valuable-player
award in voting by members of the Baseball Writers Assn. He always
thought that Mel Webb, a Boston writer, left him off the ballot. It
wasn't Webb, who didn't have a vote that year, but another Boston
writer Dave Egan, who snubbed him. Joe DiMaggio won because he
received eight first-place votes to three for Williams, a remarkably
low total that suggests his relationship with Boston reporters did
factor in, considering he had won the Triple Crown that year and was
the MVP favorite.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, he would settle for two MVPs, two Triple Crowns, six
batting titles, eight seasons of leading the league in both slugging
and on-base percentage and is still the only player to lead two
consecutive decades in slugging percentage, doing it in the 1940s and
'50s.</TE>
<TE>   He is also the last to hit .400, batting .406 in 1941, and would
prove that he could still see grass grow, as longtime umpire Ed
Hurley once said of him, by winning the batting title at 40 after
hitting .388 at 39.</TE>
<TE>   Williams would finish with a .344 career average--a remarkable
stat considering he seldom beat out a ground ball and teams loaded
the right side, trying to thwart his tendency to pull pitches.</TE>
<TE>   He hit 521 home runs, an equally remarkable total that might have
exceeded 700 if he hadn't lost almost five seasons as a Marine pilot
in World War II and Korea.</TE>
<TE>   As much as Williams loved to hit (he once said that he existed for
his next turn at the plate) and pamper his bats (he brought a postal
scale to the clubhouse so that he would be sure they weighed 32
ounces precisely), he was a perfectionist who loved to talk about
hitting--or just about anything.</TE>
<TE>   Said Bobby Doerr, a former teammate and fishing companion: "Each
hour, no matter what he was going on about, I got to interrupt. It's
amazing how well it worked out."</TE>
<TE>   Longtime Boston broadcaster Curt Gowdy, reflecting on his friend's
ability with a bat, fly rod, cockpit controls (and just about
anything else he touched), once called him "the most competent man
I've ever met."</TE>
<TE>   Williams would certainly become one of the most beloved. A
$2.3-billion tunnel under Boston Harbor was named for him in 1995,
and his emotional appearance during pregame ceremonies at the Fenway
Park All-Star game in 1999 generated tears among the awed players, a
reflection of his all-time status.</TE>
<TE>   There is also this: Williams lost his only brother, Danny, to
leukemia in 1960 just before Ted's last season, endearing himself to
some of the same Boston fans who had booed him by becoming a tireless
supporter of the Jimmy Fund charity.</TE>
<TE>   Boston Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy recalled Friday that his
daughter Kate, then 8, was hospitalized for leukemia in 1993 and how
he had just told Williams' son, John Henry Williams, about it in a
call from the hospital and "by the time I got back to Kate's room she
had the phone in her hand and was saying, 'Daddy, there's some loud
guy on the phone saying I'm going to be OK.' It was a real sweet
thing for Ted to do, and it wasn't the only time he called her."</TE>
<TE>   Kate Shaughnessy is now 16, the captain of her high school
softball team, a .373 hitter last year who works in a memorabilia
store across from Fenway Park and, coincidentally, had been planning
to wear a replica Williams jersey to Friday night's game at the Fen.</TE>
<TE>   She now knows, of course, that the loud guy on the phone was the
best hitter ever.</TE>

<LD>Joe Nemechek won the first-ever Busch Series night race at Daytona,
blocking Greg Biffle over a two-lap shootout Friday after a 16-car
accident halted the Stacker2/GNC Live Well 250 race at Daytona Beach,
Fla.</LD>
<LD>   Nemechek became the first Busch driver to win from the pole at
Daytona International Speedway since 1975.</LD>
<LD>   Jack Sprague, who started the race as the points leader, was
knocked out of the event in the big wreck that came with five laps to
go.</LD>

<TE>   Kevin Harvick won the first Winston Cup pole position of his
career, qualifying first for the Pepsi 400 at Daytona Beach, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Harvick, who took over the car Dale Earnhardt drove after the
Intimidator died last year, circled the 2.5-mile Daytona track at
185.041 mph. That was 0.668 mph faster than second-place qualifier
Geoffrey Bodine, a restrictor-plate specialist racing in only his
fourth event of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Defending Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon (184.271) will go for
his first victory of the season from the third position. Harvick's
Richard Childress Racing teammate, Robby Gordon, qualified fourth
(184.268) for tonight's race.</TE>

58.487-seconds, or 108.024 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Zanardi, who lost both legs above the knee, and nearly lost
his life, in a terrifying crash last September in Germany, was in

<HD>Schilling Shuts Down Giants, Wins 14th</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For all but a couple of pitches, Curt Schilling was at his best.</LD>
<LD>   Schilling threw a four-hitter and struck out 11 to become the
season's first 14-game winner as the Arizona Diamondbacks beat the
San Francisco Giants, 2-1, Friday night at Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   "He was his old self tonight," Diamondback catcher Damian Miller
said. "He was as good tonight as he's been all year."</LD>
<TE>   Schilling had a shutout until Rich Aurilia's home run with two out
in the ninth. Jeff Kent flied out to end the game, leaving Barry
Bonds in the on-deck circle.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds was 0 for 3, including a first-inning strikeout on
Schilling's 97-mph fastball. He lined out to deep right in the
seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Counsell's two-out single off Russ Ortiz in the fifth inning
provided Arizona's runs.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona won its third in a row and the Giants, who face Randy
Johnson today, have lost three straight.</TE>
<TE>   "These are tough ones to take and lose," Giant Manager Dusty Baker
said, "but we've got another tough guy tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   After going 0-2 in three starts, Schilling (14-3) earned his
second complete-game victory in a row and third of the season. He had
his 10th double-digit strikeout effort of the season and walked none.</TE>
<TE>   Schilling threw 106 pitches to set down San Francisco in only 2
hours 19 minutes. The count reached three balls against only two San
Francisco batters--David Bell to start the game and Aurilia to end
the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Aurilia's homer, only one Giant made it past first base.
Tsuyoshi Shinjo led off the sixth with a single, went to second when
Ortiz bounced out to Schilling, then advanced to third on a wild
pitch. But Schilling struck out Bell and Aurilia to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   New York 5, Florida 3--A.J. Burnett's wildness at Miami helped the
Mets win for the only the third time in nine games. Burnett gave up
three hits and three walks in six innings, but he also had three wild
pitches. He struck out nine, including four in the first inning, when
two of his wild pitches helped lead to two runs.</TE>
<TE>   After giving up consecutive hits to Roberto Alomar and Edgardo
Alfonzo to start the game, Burnett struck out the next two Mets. He
also struck out Timo Perez on a curveball in the dirt, but it got
away from catcher Mike Redmond, allowing Alomar to score, Alfonzo to
advance to second and Perez to reach base.</TE>
<TE>   Jay Payton followed with an RBI single, but Burnett bounced back
and struck out Roger Cedeno.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 9, San Diego 6--Mike Hampton pitched six strong innings
and the Rockies took advantage of sloppy fielding by the Padres to
win at Denver. The Padres had four errors that led to five unearned
runs for their fifth consecutive loss. San Diego has lost 11 of 13
overall and eight of nine on the road.</TE>
<TE>   Hampton (5-9) has won two of his last three starts after opening
the season 1-5. He gave up three runs and eight hits in six innings,
only the seventh time in 18 starts he has given up three or fewer
earned runs.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 4, Chicago 3--Keith Lockhart hit a two-run homer in the
fourth inning to back the pitching of Kevin Millwood as the host
Braves won for the 14th time in 16 games. Millwood (6-5) went six
innings and gave up four hits, including Fred McGriff's towering solo
home run in the second. It was McGriff's 465th career homer, tying
him for 23rd on the all-time list with Dave Winfield.</TE>
<TE>   John Smoltz gave up Delino DeShields' RBI single with two out in
the ninth before getting his 30th save in 33 chances.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 4, Houston 3--Aramis Ramirez, booed loudly after his
throwing error led to three Astro runs, hit a go-ahead homer and
drove in two runs as the Pirates rallied to win at Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez drew a bases-loaded walk during the Pirates' three-run
fifth inning, then put them ahead with a one-out solo shot in the
seventh off Pedro Borbon (2-2). The homer was only the sixth for
Ramirez, who hit a career-high 35 homers last year but has been
slowed all season by a badly sprained ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 8, Milwaukee 6--Adam Dunn hit a solo homer and a
two-run double off the top of the 40-foot wall in center field for
the Reds at Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Danny Graves pitched the ninth for his 26th save in 32 chances,
snuffing out a comeback with his defense. Eric Young walked, moved to
second on Hammonds' single and tried to score from there on Graves'
wild pitch.</TE>
<TE>   The closer blocked the plate, took the throw from catcher Jason
LaRue and made the tag for the first out of the inning.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 8, Philadelphia 3--Brad Wilkerson homered, Troy O'Leary
drove in two runs and Tomo Ohka struck out a career-high eight as the
Expos won at Philadelphia. Wilkerson and O'Leary each scored twice,
and Montreal pinch-hitter Wil Cordero hit his 100th career home run.
Ohka (8-4) gave up three runs--one earned--on three hits in six
innings.</TE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAINT-DENIS, France</DL>
<LD>Marion Jones ran the world's fastest 100 meters this year Friday,
clocking 10.89 seconds at the rain-soaked Gaz de France meet.</LD>
<LD>   Maurice Greene was the other American sprinter drawing attention
at the meet and he rebounded from two recent defeats to win the men's
100, although his time of 9.99 was far off the seasonal best.</LD>
<LD>   Jones is unbeaten in the 100 since her shocking defeat to Zhanna
Pintusevich-Block at last year's World Championships in Edmonton,
Canada.</LD>
<TE>   She has won seven races this season, including the first two
Golden League meets in Oslo and Saint-Denis.</TE>
<TE>   Olympic bronze medalist Tayna Lawrence finished second in 11.04
and Jones' American teammate Chryste Gaines was third in 11.06.</TE>

<HD>Lemerre Is Ousted as Coach of France</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four years ago, Roger Lemerre helped France win the 1998 World Cup
while serving as an assistant coach under Aime Jacquet.</LD>
<LD>   Two years ago, as coach in his own right, Lemerre led France to
victory in the 2000 European Championship. The next year, he coached
it to its FIFA Confederations Cup victory.</LD>
<LD>   Overall, in 54 matches under his guidance, France went 34-8-11 and
outscored its opponents, 106-43.</LD>
<TE>   But on Friday Lemerre was fired by the French Football Federation
at a close-door meeting in Lyon, France. No reason for his dismissal
was given, although France's ouster in the first round of the 2002
World Cup was the obvious, albeit unspoken, cause.</TE>
<TE>   "After paying tribute to his efforts as French coach, we then told
him to step down so that he could take on other challenges," said
Claude Simonet, president of the FFF.</TE>
<TE>   Simonet said Lemerre was not solely to blame for France's World
Cup flop.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot say that Roger Lemerre was at fault," Simonet said. "I
do not remember him committing a serious mistake and we did not
analyze the reasons for the failure of the campaign. All I could say
is that the luck that was with us in 1998 deserted us in 2002."</TE>
<TE>   Lemerre's ouster, therefore, is aimed at changing that luck.</TE>
<TE>   "In a business, you change strategy from time to time," Simonet
said, adding that a new coach would be named soon.</TE>
<TE>   Lemerre, 61, had refused to resign and was not immediately
available for comment. He had signed a new two-year contract shortly
before the World Cup and the federation is expected to honor that at
a cost of almost $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Pact for Friedel</TE>
<TE>   Brad Friedel, the goalkeeper whose stellar performance at the
World Cup was largely responsible for the United States reaching the
quarterfinals, on Friday signed a new contract that will keep him at
Blackburn Rovers of the English Premier League for another four
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Friedel, 32, joined Rovers in November 2001 and helped the club
win the English League Cup last season.</TE>
<TE>   "He is very important to our squad and our plans," Blackburn Coach
Graeme Souness said. "It's good news all round."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hamm, Scurry Called Up</TE>
<TE>   Forward Mia Hamm and goalkeeper Briana Scurry are among 23 players
called up by the U.S. women's national team for a July 21 game
against Olympic gold medalist Norway in Blaine, Minn.</TE>
<TE>   Hamm, who recently returned from injury to the Washington Freedom
of Women's United Soccer Assn., has not played for the U.S. since
scoring twice in a 4-1 victory over Germany in September. Scurry's
last appearance for the national team was against Canada in August
2000.</TE>

<HD>Sparks Put Troubles to Rest, Rout Monarchs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the Sparks and the Sacramento Monarchs were putting on their
spirited duel in the Western Conference finals last year, it looked
like the beginning of a great WNBA rivalry.</LD>
<LD>   But Friday's 87-65 rout by the Sparks before 12,219 at Staples
Center was another reminder of how far Sacramento has fallen this
season.</LD>
<LD>   The Monarchs had a hard enough time dealing with the Sparks at
full strength. But the injury-riddled Monarchs (2-13)--trying to
soldier through without stars Yolanda Griffith, Edna Campbell and
Ticha Penicheiro--were no match for an aroused Spark squad still
upset at having its 28-game home winning streak ended by Houston on
Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   "A very good win for us," Spark Coach Michael Cooper said. "I
didn't expect a letdown because they had four days to reflect on what
they did wrong against Houston. We got back to the basics on offense,
and our defense was very active."</TE>
<TE>   Revived by the four-day break, the Sparks (13-2) never gave
Sacramento a chance, streaking to a 51-30 halftime lead. They went up
by as many as 31 points in the second half even though Cooper played
everyone in gold and purple.</TE>
<TE>   "It was fun tonight," said Sophia Witherspoon, one of five Sparks
in double figures with 11 points. "With the four days off we were
able to get some rest for our bodies. Everyone looked fresh out
there; that was the difference."</TE>
<TE>   No Spark looked more refreshed than Lisa Leslie, who had a
team-high 16 points and nine rebounds. Since the Sparks' trip to
Sacramento and Seattle 2 1/2 weeks ago, Leslie has been battling an
ailment described as flulike, which has left her tired and weak at
times. She also had a collision with forward La'Keishia Frett in the
Sacramento game but said there were no aftereffects.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie looked very weary after the Houston game, but her energy
level was high Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "I did need the rest," Leslie said. "I don't know exactly what I
have, and the doctors don't seem to know, so I don't know what to
tell you guys. I'm just dealing with it.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt a little rusty out there. But I also felt better today."</TE>
<TE>   Even though the Sparks have been winning, the team has been in a
subtle shooting slump. In the six games before Friday, the Sparks had
shot 45.1%, making 164 of 364 shots. But throw out the two Phoenix
games in which the Sparks made 65 of 126 shots and the percentage
drops to 41.6% (99 of 238).</TE>
<TE>   But on Friday, they came out firing and firing accurately. The
Sparks made 10 of their first 15 shots and jumped to a 24-13 lead at
the 12:19 mark of the first half. More telling was the fact the
Sparks also got the game pace to a frantic level, which is not where
Sacramento wanted it to be.</TE>
<TE>   "The first time we played them we kept it [a half-court game],"
Monarch Coach Maura McHugh said. "This time we didn't. They did
exactly what they wanted to do. We were just struggling."</TE>
<TE>   The Monarchs, who got 18 points from Kedra Holland-Corn and 16
from Ruthie Bolton, did their best to match the Sparks shot for shot
in the early going. But an 11-0 burst by Los Angeles, culminated by a
five-foot bank shot by DeLisha Milton with 3:19 to play, raised the
lead to 45-25 and put the Sparks in complete control.</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks wound up shooting 51%, while holding Sacramento to
37.7% (23 of 61).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In other WNBA games:</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 73, Cleveland 65--Sue Bird had her first double-double as
a pro with 16 points and 12 assists to lead the Storm (8-8) over the
Rockers (6-9) before 11,114 in Cleveland. Bird, the No. 1 overall
pick in the WNBA draft, made all four of her shots and had nine
assists in the second half as Seattle overcame a 53-40 deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Utah 87, Minnesota 56--Margo Dydek returned from a one-game
suspension for throwing an elbow and scored 13 points as the host
Starzz (10-5) posted the largest margin of victory in franchise
history before 7,165. Shaunzinski Gortman scored a season-high 14
points for the Lynx (6-10).</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte 72, Miami 68--Allison Feaster scored 11 of her 13 points
in the second half and the Sting (8-7) recovered from blowing a
20-point halftime lead to win before 7,615 in Miami. Sandy Brondello
scored a season-high 23 points for the Sol (5-10).</TE>

<LD>When Tom Lasorda learned Friday of Ted Williams' death, he remembered
one exchange that personified Williams' status as an American icon.</LD>
<LD>   Lasorda was making a speech in Toronto years ago when he saw
Williams and Hall of Fame pitcher Ferguson Jenkins sitting unnoticed
in the crowd.</LD>
<LD>   Lasorda introduced the two to a rousing ovation and afterward
agreed to get together at Williams' hotel.</LD>
<TE>   "We started talking hitting and the next thing you know it's 3
o'clock in the morning," Lasorda recalled. "Then Ted says, 'Hey,
you're a good friend of Frank Sinatra's right? Geez, I love to listen
to that guy sing. Next time you see him, make sure you tell him I
think he's the greatest.'</TE>
<TE>   "So I say to Ted, 'Why don't you tell him yourself?'</TE>
<TE>   "Now, it's late, but I knew Frank would be up. So I called him and
said, 'Francis, someone wants to talk to you.'</TE>
<TE>   "Well, Ted gets on the phone and goes on and on about how honored
he is to talk to Frank and how great he thinks Frank is. Finally,
he's done and he hands the phone to me so I can say goodbye.</TE>
<TE>   "I get back on the line and the first thing Sinatra says is, 'I
can't believe I was talking to Ted Williams!' "</TE>

<DH>BORN THEODORE SAMUEL WILLIAMS, AUG. 30, 1918 IN SAN DIEGO.
BOSTON RED SOX 1939-1960. NICKNAMES: THE KID, THE THUMPER, TEDDY
BALLGAME OR THE SPLENDID SPLINTER.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>* Dec. 1, 1937--Red Sox obtain Williams from San Diego of the Pacific
Coast League for $35,000, outfielder Dom Dallessandro and second
baseman Al Niemiec.</LD>
<LD>   * Feb. 7, 1938--Williams' parents, after learning the Red Sox gave
the San Diego club $35,000, demand $5,000 from San Diego as a
condition of their son's reporting to the Red Sox. They pay.</LD>
<LD>   * April 17, 1938--Williams is sent to Boston's minor league
affiliate in Minneapolis. While leaving Boston's spring training
facility, Williams is heckled by Red Sox outfielders Doc Cramer and
Joe Vosmik, who say, "Good riddance, busher." When Williams arrives
in Minneapolis, he sends the two a telegram that reads, "I'll be back
and will make more money in this game than the two of you put
together."</LD>
<TE>   * April 20, 1939--The Red Sox open the season at Yankee Stadium.
After striking out in his first two at-bats, Williams lines a
407-foot double to right-center off Red Ruffing.</TE>
<TE>   * May 4, 1939--Williams hits two homers in a game for the first

<TE>   * July 2, 1940--Williams sets a record by batting three times in
the seventh inning against the Philadelphia A's. He walks twice and
grounds out as the Red Sox score 14 runs in the inning.</TE>
<TE>   * Aug. 17, 1940--Williams is booed by Boston fans after making an
error, then striking out in the next inning. After the game he
demands a trade to the Tigers. In his autobiography, Williams says,
"The unfairness of it all hit me. I vowed that day that I'd never tip
my cap again." He never did.</TE>
<TE>   * Aug. 24, 1940--Williams pitches the final two innings of
Boston's 12-1 loss to Detroit, giving up one run and three hits, with

at the All-Star game, Williams homers off Clyde Passeau to give the
AL a 7-5 victory.</TE>
<TE>   * July 17, 1941--Joe DiMaggio's hitting streak ends at 56. Asked
for comment, Williams says: "There isn't a record in the books that
will be harder to break. It may be the greatest batting achievement
of all."</TE>
<TE>   * Sept. 28, 1941--Williams begins the day hitting .39955, and
Manager Joe Cronin offers him the chance to sit out a season-ending
doubleheader to preserve a .400 average. Williams responds: "I don't
care to be known as a .400 hitter with a lousy .39955 average. I'm
going to be a .400 hitter." He goes six for eight in the doubleheader
and finishes at .406. Still, DiMaggio wins MVP award.</TE>
<TE>   * July 14, 1942--Cleveland Manager Lou Boudreau invents the
Williams shift, putting the shortstop on the second-base side of the
diamond.</TE>
<TE>   * Oct. 1 1942--Wins first Triple Crown. Yankees' Joe Gordon is
MVP.</TE>
<TE>   * Dec. 8, 1942--Inducted into Navy.</TE>
<TE>   * May 4, 1944--Marries Doris Soule.</TE>
<TE>   * Jan. 2, 1946--Returns from World War II and wins first MVP

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ted Williams the baseball player will be remembered for his many
remarkable accomplishments: his .344 lifetime batting average--.406
in 1941--his .482 on-base percentage, his 521 homers ...</LD>
<LD>   Ted Williams the fisherman posted some pretty impressive numbers
as well. How's this for a Triple Crown: 1,000 Atlantic salmon, 1,000
bonefish and 1,000 tarpon, all caught on a fly rod.</LD>
<LD>   In 19 years with the Boston Red Sox, Williams amassed 2,654 hits.
On one of his countless memorable days on the water, off Peru,
Williams caught a black marlin that tipped the scale at an
eye-popping 1,235 pounds.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, Williams' proficiency with a bat was, in many ways,
matched by his proficiency with a rod and reel.</TE>
<TE>   "I was host of the 'American Sportsman' TV show for 20 years and
got to fish with most of the world's great fishermen, and [Williams]
was the best all-around fisherman I ever met," said Curt Gowdy, 80,
also a legendary sports broadcaster.</TE>
<TE>   And if Williams, who died Friday, was considered a perfectionist
on the field, you should have seen him on the water.</TE>
<TE>   Sammy Lee, a Birmingham, Ala., talk-show host, met Williams in
1992 in Florida to tape an interview for his fishing show. It was the
beginning of a friendship Lee valued above all others.</TE>
<TE>   Reached recently at his home, he recalled the time Williams
invited him to spend a week at his cabin on the Miramichi River in
New Brunswick, Canada. Lee, a former pro bass fisherman, had taught
Williams a thing or two about how to put a largemouth on the hook,
but he was new to fly fishing and thus was in for some schooling
he'll never forget.</TE>
<TE>   Williams wouldn't even let Lee on the river the first day;
instructing him instead to watch and learn from its bank. Lee gave
his full attention to the master, knowing that when his time came, he
would be under intense scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   On the second day, Williams sent Lee wading precariously down
river, entrusted with one of Williams' signature fly-casting rigs.</TE>
<TE>   "It was basically my first time free fishing in a river like that,
and it was my first time fly fishing," Lee says. "And I have this man
critiquing me? Talk about pressure!"</TE>
<TE>   The pressure proved too much. While Lee was trying to negotiate
around a large rock, the swift current caught him.</TE>
<TE>   "I go head over heels," he says. "My waders fill up and my feet
are sticking straight up in the air. And I remember thinking, 'I
don't care if I die, as long as I don't let go of the rod and reel'
because this is Williams' rod and reel we're talking about."</TE>
<TE>   When Lee regained his footing, he glanced toward the bank at
Williams, who barked, "Why are you looking at me? You can't catch
anything looking at me!"</TE>
<TE>   Later that day, Lee was told by Williams' personal guide that the
cantankerous old slugger had been thinking along the same lines as
the fallen fly caster.</TE>
<TE>   "He said to his guide, 'I don't care if that [SOB] dies, as long
as he doesn't let go of my rod and reel,' " Lee recalls with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   That was just Williams being Williams, Lee assures. The Hall of
Famer who refused to tip his cap to fans during most of his
illustrious career with the Red Sox would willingly give the shirt
off his back to any of his many close friends.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' abrasive style wasn't for everyone. But anyone with a
passion for fishing shared common ground with him--to a point.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' love of fishing, and of the great outdoors, went far
beyond the mere acts of casting and retrieving a fly, waiting for the
magic moment of the strike and then playing the fish.</TE>
<TE>   He demanded of himself the perfect cast, the perfect retrieve and,
once a fish was hooked, the perfect fight. His thirst for knowledge
was insatiable; he learned to read rivers as well as he could
pitches.</TE>
<TE>   Whether on the Miramichi or in the tarpon-rich waters closer to
his home in Hernando, Fla., Williams was a purist in every sense.</TE>
<TE>   He meticulously tied his own flies the night before each
outing--and brooked no interruptions while he did so.</TE>
<TE>   "You did not come downstairs and if you did, you did not initiate
conversation--you did not interfere whatsoever during his fly-tying
time," Lee says.</TE>
<TE>   Williams was respectful of those fishing with him only if they
took the sport as seriously as he did--and didn't bungle along the
way.</TE>
<TE>   "The first time I went fishing with him, all he did was give me
hell all day," Gowdy recalls. "But I learned to give it right back
and that made him laugh."</TE>
<TE>   Gowdy recalls a trip with Williams to the Yucatan peninsula to
film a show on fishing for permit, a powerful and elusive fish.</TE>
<TE>   The fish could be seen in great numbers, but none bit over the
course of three days. Gowdy's producer said that if none were caught
by noon the fourth day, the episode would have to be canceled.</TE>
<TE>   Williams bet Gowdy $500 he would land a permit long before then,
and then raised the wager to $1,000 as the deadline approached.</TE>
<TE>   Gowdy declined at accept both wagers, and sure enough, Williams
finally fooled a permit into biting.</TE>
<TE>   Gowdy then hooked up.</TE>
<TE>   "We ended up catching about five permit and got a good show out of
it," Gowdy says. "That's how confident this guy was in his ability."</TE>
<TE>   Permit, tarpon and bonefish were among Williams' favorites, but
never was he more in his element--except perhaps when he was at the
plate--than amid a run of migrating salmon.</TE>
<TE>   "He always told me that Atlantic salmon was his favorite because
he thought that presenting a fly in a river to a migrating salmon
offered the greatest challenge of any other game fish," Lee says. "He
told me that salmon were the purest-fighting fish he ever went
after."</TE>
<TE>   And he went after them often. Williams reportedly turned down an
offer of $100,000 to serve as an advisor for Robert Redford in his
role in "The Natural"--because the salmon were running.</TE>
<TE>   The salmon of the Miramichi inspired him to buy a cabin on its
banks. He went after salmon in Russia in the summer of 1991. He
headed them off on the Cascapedia River in Quebec in 1993. That was
where he fooled an estimated 35-pounder with a long cast of a dry
fly. But the fish won its freedom after an epic battle the angler
talked about for the rest of his life.</TE>
<TE>   In those years that remained, Williams' life had been slowed
considerably by a series of health problems that eventually took away
even his ability to cast.</TE>
<TE>   But there was one milestone that remained: his induction, on Jan.
31, 2000, into the International Game Fish Assn.'s Fishing Hall of
Fame.</TE>
<TE>   After entertaining the crowd with tales of his exploits with rod
and reel, Williams brought about an eruption of cheers and applause
when he did something he refused to do on the baseball diamond: He
tipped his cap to his fans.</TE>

<HD>Armstrong's Focus Is Key</HD>
<DH>Cycling: Three-time champion doesn't figure to repeat
Delgado's blunder as he begins quest for another title.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE DeSIMONE</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL>LUXEMBOURG</DL>
<LD>The last time the Tour de France started here, the defending champion
may have blown the race before he even got on his bike.</LD>
<LD>   By tradition, 1988 winner Pedro Delgado of Spain was slated to
start last the next year. Triple champion Lance Armstrong will have
that honor today as the 189 riders take off at one-minute intervals
for the 4.2-mile sprint.</LD>
<LD>   But 13 years ago, Delgado's start time came and went and the ramp
remained empty. Delgado, chatting with fans on a side street, had
lost track of the time.</LD>
<TE>   By the time he realized his mistake and pushed his way frantically
through the crowd, holding his bike in front of him, more than two
minutes had elapsed.</TE>
<TE>   He finished the stage 2 minutes 54 seconds behind the leader and
never fully recovered, finishing third that year as eventual winner
Greg LeMond and Laurent Fignon battled it out in the last stage in
the closest Tour finish in history.</TE>
<TE>   Luxembourg is the only place outside France to have played host to
the start of the Tour more than once.</TE>
<TE>   The course, a madcap, twisting loop through the oldest part of the
capital, starts with a sizable downhill and features cobblestoned
streets and hairpin turns.</TE>
<TE>   It could be slick if it rains, as expected. Riders are expected to
complete the course in approximately eight minutes, reaching speeds
of about 30 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Australian rider Bradley McGee, Colombian Santiago Botero and Igor
Gonzales Galdeano of Spain have shown strength in time trials this
season and should be contenders for the first yellow jersey awarded
in the race.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong should be among the leaders, but winning the stage is
not critical to his overall race strategy.</TE>

<HD>England's Hopes Dashed With Henman's Loss</HD>
<DH>Wimbledon: Native son is swept aside by Aussie Hewitt.
Malisse-Nalbandian semifinal is suspended.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WIMBLEDON, England</DL>
<LD>Well, they didn't burst into "God Save the Queen" at Centre Court
after Tim Henman lost to Lleyton Hewitt in the Wimbledon semifinals
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Henman really didn't stand much of a chance against the precise
passing shots of the top-seeded Aussie. Hewitt survived a rain delay,
a partisan crowd and the usual brave effort from his opponent, but
had few worries, beating No. 4 Henman, 7-5, 6-1, 7-5.</LD>
<LD>   Hewitt's level of shot-making and retrieving was phenomenal. The
U.S. Open champion will be playing in his second Grand Slam final,
and his opponent is undetermined. The semifinal between Xavier
Malisse of Belgium and David Nalbandian of Argentina was suspended
after four sets because of darkness.</LD>
<TE>   The Argentine won the first two sets, 7-6 (2), 6-4, and Malisse
responded by taking the next two, 6-1, 6-2. After dropping the first
set, Malisse left the court for nearly 10 minutes for medical
attention. He held his chest and officials said he felt dizzy and
breathless. Belgian reporters said the player has had heart
palpitations in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Nalbandian appeared annoyed by the long delay and made a sarcastic
remark about leaving the court to go have his own medical test for a
few minutes.</TE>
<TE>   British fans had hoped for more drama in Henman's match. This was
his fourth Wimbledon semifinal, and at 27, the Brit's title chances
are dwindling. In six matches he has never beaten Hewitt, winning
only two sets.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, as the score line suggests, not a lot did work, did it?"
Henman said. "I certainly tried different tactics, different
variations. The bottom line is he's the better player. And it's my
job to go away and keep improving my game."</TE>
<TE>   The crowd did its best to keep optimistic, and exploded with noise
and frenzied flag-waving when Henman broke Hewitt to make it 5-5 in
the third set, his last gasp. Henman was broken in the next game, and
Hewitt held, serving a 116-mph ace on his second match point.</TE>
<TE>   "The crowd was great," said Hewitt, who will try to become the
first Australian to win Wimbledon since Pat Cash in 1987. "Obviously,
I've played in some hostile arenas in Davis Cup matches. This was
fine. It was loud at times when Tim got out of his chair, jogging
from the changeover. That's a good atmosphere to play in."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After his second-round loss to George Bastl, seven-time champion
Pete Sampras had an MRI exam at a local hospital, he told a Times
reporter. The Daily Mail had received information that Sampras had
been tested at Atkinson Morley hospital in Wimbledon. The hospital
specializes in neurological medicine, but Sampras said that the scan
was not of that nature. He would not offer specifics, however.</TE>

<HD>Already the Best, Sisters Need to Play Their Best</HD>
<DH>Analysis: Venus and Serena Williams can answer match-fixing
charges with strong Wimbledon final.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WIMBLEDON, England</DL>
<LD>The Williams Tennis Assn. has arrived, and certainly, no one can say
there wasn't any warning. Venus and Serena seemed to know it would be
this way, and their coach and father Richard long ago predicted an
era of domination.</LD>
<LD>   Their journey to the top of women's tennis has been fascinating
and, at times, controversial. But now that the sisters have reached
the point of domination--today's all-Williams final at Wimbledon will
be their third in a Grand Slam since September--it brings to mind a
famous line in a movie about a political campaign.</LD>
<LD>   At the end of "The Candidate," Robert Redford, having won the
election, asks: "What do we do now?"</LD>
<TE>   This seems to be the question for the Williams sisters. They've
been unable to play even a semi-decent match against one another, on
grass, on clay or on a hard court. Unfortunately, they can't share
singles titles at Grand Slams. There is no tennis version of crossing
the finish line at a marathon together, holding hands.</TE>
<TE>   There is no sign of a next step, a crucial necessity because the
novelty factor can only last so long. Fans will soon tire of going
through two weeks of a Grand Slam, patiently waiting for the event to
build to a crescendo, only to have the final fall flat. Is this what
spectators have to look forward to the next few years? A hundred
unforced errors between the two of them and one forehand winner from
the loser?</TE>
<TE>   The angst of playing a sibling and the psychological implications
were all somewhat interesting stories to detail the last few years.
Again, how long can it remain interesting to read about?</TE>
<TE>   Familiarity has not made the matches much better. The
second-seeded and younger Serena, who trails, 5-3, in their series,
has won their last two meetings, which included last month's French
Open final. It was her first Grand Slam title since the 1999 U.S.
Open, and created some more history because Venus and Serena were
ranked No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, after the tournament. They will
flip spots on Monday, when Serena becomes No. 1, win or lose today.</TE>
<TE>   However, those numbers did not receive all of the attention after
the French Open. Closely examining the dreadful statistics in Paris,
more than one European newspaper again raised the far-fetched
contention of an arranged match. There has never been any evidence to
support such an allegation, and the sisters, in the past, have denied
instances of match-fixing in the strongest terms possible.</TE>
<TE>   Oddly enough, this is the place where the speculation was at its
peak when Venus defeated Serena in the Wimbledon semifinals two years
ago. Questions were raised about a pre-arranged result by television
commentators, British newspapers, and much later, an American
supermarket tabloid.</TE>
<TE>   Other players have said previously that they thought Richard
Williams decided the outcome of the matches. Instead of disappearing,
the sentiment has resurfaced this year at Wimbledon, and it's hard to
tell if it's jealousy or bitterness, especially because the gap
between Venus and Serena and the rest of the field has opened.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that it's fixed," Amelie Mauresmo reportedly said in an
interview with French television Thursday after she lost to Serena in
the semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have any information, nothing at all. But having seen the
matches, it could be fixed."</TE>
<TE>   Oracene Williams, the mother and coach of the sisters, talked
about the issue in an interview with TNT on Friday. She, not Richard,
has been traveling with her daughters most of this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite all the allegations that a game was fixed, people can
believe what they want," she said. "It's difficult playing against
each other because of the love they have for each other ... it's
difficult to do with sisters."</TE>
<TE>   The lingering perception would be corrected with a well-played
match and would help erase doubts. Quite rightly, there should be
more focus on the top-seeded Venus' quest to win her third
consecutive Wimbledon or Serena's attempt to become the first player
to win the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year since Steffi
Graf in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "Wouldn't it be great for them to show off how great they play
against one another?" former men's player Jim Courier said. "I mean
that would be something that we have never seen before. I can't wait
for it to happen, it just hasn't happened yet. The Williams sisters
both playing at their best would be something that we would never
have seen in tennis."</TE>
<TE>   Today's final could be the start.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Envoy Criticized in Messy Aftermath of Bolivian Vote</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR and ANDREW ENEVER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>LA PAZ, Bolivia</DL>
<LD>The election to pick this Andean nation's next president has devolved
into a morass of accusations and conspiracy theories, with an
American diplomat and a former coca farmer at the center of the
controversy.</LD>
<LD>   Did U.S. Ambassador Manuel Rocha shape the outcome of the election
by publicly attacking a leftist candidate who is critical of U.S.
foreign policy? Three of the top four vote-getters in Sunday's
election seem to think so.</LD>
<LD>   After six days of vote counting, nearly complete official returns
Friday left the race a virtual three-way tie. Bolivia's Congress will
meet Aug. 6 to choose the next president from the top two
vote-getters.</LD>
<TE>   Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, the center-right candidate who served
as president from 1993 to 1997, appeared likely to win, despite
having garnered just 22.5% of the vote as of Friday evening.</TE>
<TE>   But Evo Morales, the Aymara Indian and former coca farmer who
founded the Movement Toward Socialism, could also be a big winner.
Long an opponent of U.S.-backed efforts to eliminate the farming of
coca leaves--used, among other things, to make cocaine--Morales is
now poised to become the leader of the largest opposition party in
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   All 157 seats in both houses of Congress were at stake in the
election. Morales' party won seven seats in the 27-member Senate and
26 seats in the 130-member Chamber of Deputies, making the Movement
Toward Socialism the second-largest party in both houses of Congress,
behind the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement, or MNR, of Sanchez de
Lozada.</TE>
<TE>   "I am happy. There is enormous satisfaction, above all for the
people, the people who are discriminated against," said Morales, best
known for organizing coca farmers in the region around Cochabamba in
central Bolivia. "The people have voted against any further
eradication of coca, not only in Cochabamba but in all Bolivia."</TE>
<TE>   Morales and his followers say that coca is a traditional crop used
for home remedies and that the farmers who grow it would go broke if
forced to grow something else. Most analysts here say support for
Morales grew--from 4% in polls earlier this year to 20.8% in Sunday's
election--thanks in large measure to Rocha's repeated attacks on the
coca growers.</TE>
<TE>   Just days before the vote, Rocha suggested that a Morales victory
would mean the end of U.S. aid.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bolivian electorate must consider the consequences of
choosing leaders somehow connected with drug trafficking and
terrorism," he said in a speech in the rural region of Chapare on
June 26.</TE>
<TE>   To many, Morales became a symbol of national honor in the face of
"Yankee imperialism."</TE>
<TE>   Now, his strong showing has thrown the political process into
turmoil. The leaders of all the major parties have said they would
not join a coalition government with Morales. But leaders of those
same parties do not seem keen to make a deal with Sanchez de Lozada
and the MNR either.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, spokesmen for two major parties claimed that the U.S.
ambassador's statements were part of a plan to help Sanchez de Lozada
win. The ambassador, the argument went, attacked Morales to divert
votes from more centrist candidates, including the second-place
finisher, Manfred Reyes Villa, the mayor of Cochabamba, who received
20.9% of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Victor Gutierrez, a spokesman for Reyes Villa, claimed the
ambassador's statements had caused a 10% shift of votes to Morales,
costing Reyes Villa a clear victory. Reyes Villa boycotted a July 4
party at the American Embassy in protest. Jaime Paz Zamora, of the
Movement of the Revolutionary Left, which finished fourth, called the
ambassador's statements "a form of electoral terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Morales has said that his party will not ally itself with any of
the major candidates and that his block of deputies and senators will
form an alternative legislature that will rule "from the street."</TE>
<TE>   Morales is likely to find allies in at least one other party that
made strong gains in the election. The Aymara-Quechua Indian
coalition led by Felipe Quispe is projected to take eight seats in
the Chamber of Deputies.</TE>
<TE>   Quispe has suggested that Bolivia's impoverished Indian population
might soon launch an insurrection against a government that continues
to be dominated by descendants of Europeans.</TE>

<LD>One of Germany's last trials for Nazi crimes ended when a 93-year-old
former SS officer was convicted of 59 counts of murder stemming from
a 1944 massacre of Italian resistance fighters. But the court said
Friedrich Engel is too old to serve his seven-year sentence.</LD>
<LD>   The conviction followed earlier, failed attempts to prosecute him
for the May 19, 1944, shootings on a mountain pass above Genoa,
Italy.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Rolf Seedorf said the evidence showed that Engel played a
leading role in organizing the shootings in reprisal for an attack on
a movie theater in the port city that killed five German navy men
days earlier.</LD>

suspends a recent lower court ruling that had ordered Toledo to
submit to a DNA test Aug. 7 to resolve the case.</LD>

suit, in which Lucrecia Orozco claims that the president fathered her

<DL>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine</DL>
<LD>President Bush called Afghan President Hamid Karzai on Friday to
offer condolences for an American airstrike this week that killed as
many as 44 civilians in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   The call was a possible prelude to further U.S. steps to atone for
the accident.</LD>
<LD>   Administration officials said Bush made the five-minute telephone
call from the White House, shortly before leaving Washington to begin
a four-day holiday at his parents' seaside home here. He marks his
56th birthday today.</LD>
<TE>   The attack Monday has put a strain on Washington's efforts to keep
Karzai's fledgling government unified in support of the ongoing war
on terrorism, which led to the ouster of Afghanistan's Taliban
regime.</TE>
<TE>   Bush did not offer an apology for the incident, which is under
investigation. But his call is the clearest signal yet that the
United States may be ready to accept blame for the aerial assault
that resulted in one of the deadliest "friendly fire" incidents of
the war.</TE>
<TE>   The call came as a team of U.S. and Afghan investigators returned
to Kabul, the Afghan capital, from the scene of the attack in the
remote Oruzgan province. Officials at the Central Command in Tampa,
Fla., said that Karzai and Army Lt. Gen. Dan McNeill, the top U.S.
military official in Afghanistan, have scheduled a news conference
today in Kabul to discuss the inquiry's preliminary results.</TE>
<TE>   The incident poses an array of problems for the United States. It
has added to growing Afghan anger over the war, eroding support from
villagers whose assistance is crucial to U.S. efforts to rid the
country of Al Qaeda and Taliban operatives.</TE>
<TE>   The episode also puts military leaders in the uncomfortable
position of having to at least consider curtailing such
operations--and possibly punishing pilots and troops--for mistakes
made in an unconventional war that has become a confusing game of
cat-and-mouse.</TE>
<TE>   Kabul Radio said Bush told Karzai, "I hope such kind of accidents
will not happen again. The United States is a powerful friend of
Afghanistan and will be beside Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   White House spokeswoman Claire Buchan said that Bush told the
Afghan leader "that the loss of innocent lives was very much a
tragedy" and that the presidents affirmed their commitment to the war
on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The Afghan government has said that 22 of those killed were
attending a party for an upcoming wedding. It also said that 120
people were injured.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials acknowledged that an AC-130 gunship strafed six
targets in the area, but they insisted that pilots and ground
spotters had identified the targets as antiaircraft installations
firing on the plane. Marine Lt. Gen. Gregory Newbold, director of
operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Wednesday that the
area of the attack was "an area of enormous sympathy for the Taliban
and Al Qaeda."</TE>
<TE>   Villagers have said the only fire came from celebratory rifle
shots fired at the party, an Afghan tradition.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also delivered a videotaped speech Friday to a conference of
Baltic and Balkan nations. In his remarks, he promoted the expansion
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to encompass a wide swath
of Eastern European countries once in the Soviet sphere, and called
for a broadened role for the alliance beyond Europe.</TE>
<TE>   The president told the Eastern European leaders, as he emphasized
during visits to Moscow and Western Europe in May, that a united
Europe needs to prepare "to meet global challenges beyond Europe's
borders."</TE>
<TE>   "The attacks of Sept. 11 took place in the United States, but
their target was freedom itself. All of Europe, and freedom-loving
nations everywhere, are threatened by these forces of chaos and
hatred," he said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The conference to which he spoke, in Riga, the capital of Latvia,
brought together Eastern European nations hoping to gain invitations
into NATO when the alliance meets in November in Prague, the Czech
capital.</TE>

<DL>GAZA CITY</DL>
<LD>Mourners fired assault rifles into the air and demanded revenge
Friday after a car bomb killed a militia leader and a member of the
security forces in what Palestinians say was the latest Israeli
attack on prominent militants.</LD>
<LD>   About 15,000 people marched in a funeral procession alongside the
flag-draped bodies of Jihad Amareen, 48, the Gaza leader of Al Aqsa
Martyrs Brigade, a militia affiliated with Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement, and Nael Namera, 27, a
security forces lieutenant.</LD>
<LD>   "This is another crime against the leaders of the Palestinian
people," said Nabil abu Rudaineh, an advisor to Arafat.</LD>
<TE>   In the Gaza Strip, young men hoisted AK-47 rifles while children
in Al Aqsa headbands held up pictures of Amareen and Namera. Amareen
had resigned from the Palestinian security forces about nine months
ago, frustrated by Arafat's calls for an end to attacks on Israel. He
then became the militia's leader in the Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews published Friday, the outgoing Israeli army chief of
staff, Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, said Arafat should be expelled from the
Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   Mofaz told the Yediot Aharonot daily that Arafat is directing
Palestinian terrorist attacks and has no intention of making peace.
"As long as Arafat is here, we will not be able to reach an
agreement," Mofaz said, "and he will continue to promote terrorism."</TE>

<HD>German Challenger Makes a Sharp Left to Woo Voters</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MUNICH, Germany</DL>
<LD>Bavarian Gov. Edmund Stoiber has adopted an unconventional strategy
in his neck-and-neck race with Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder for the
German leadership: He's abandoning what his conservative constituents
consider the moral high ground.</LD>
<LD>   Mindful of his lack of popularity among female voters and those
from the east, Stoiber has chosen an unwed mother from Brandenburg, a
state that was part of the old Communist East Germany, to advise him
on family and social affairs ahead of the Sept. 22 election. She is
likely to join Stoiber's Cabinet if he is elected.</LD>
<LD>   To the outrage of his largely Roman Catholic and conservative
constituents, Stoiber has struck a pose of tolerance and inclusion.
Most of the critics have been rendered speechless.</LD>
<TE>   "I stand for a modern and open policy on women, youth and families
that proceeds from clear fundamental values and keeps in sight the
reality of life in our country," the 60-year-old candidate said at a
news conference to introduce Katherina Reiche, a 28-year-old single
mother due to deliver her second child in late August.</TE>
<TE>   The invitation extended to Reiche this week provides Stoiber a
chance to gain some votes at the expense of Schroeder's Social
Democrats. Until Reiche's appointment, Stoiber's shadow Cabinet was
composed exclusively of men from western Germany, most, like himself,
nearing retirement age.</TE>
<TE>   During the campaign for chancellor four years ago, Stoiber's
Christian Social Union in the southeastern state of Bavaria and its
Christian Democratic allies in Germany's other 15 states cast
Schroeder as a man of dubious morals after he married for the fourth
time--to a single mother 20 years his junior.</TE>
<TE>   Then-Chancellor and candidate of the Christian Democratic Union
Helmut Kohl came off as the champion of family values. His wife,
Hannelore, was by his side as a constant reminder to voters of the
contrast. However, having failed to profit from the
faith-and-fidelity platform, the conservatives appear to have decided
to err on the side of inclusion this time.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the conservatives' traditional constituency will follow is
an open question, and one that makes the move a political risk for
Stoiber. Although he silenced the initial uproar over Reiche's
appointment with a steely precaution to party members that the choice
of advisors was his to make, grumbling is still to be heard. In an
editorial Thursday, the influential Sueddeutsche Zeitung warned that
the conservatives were "out on thin ice."</TE>
<TE>   "If the CDU/CSU were a publicly traded company, stock analysts
would be talking about this as an assault on shareholder value," the
newspaper commented, adding that Stoiber was overstepping the moral
boundaries that have long defined his supporters.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot see how such a questionable position can be reconciled
with a competent family policy in the Christian model," said a
prominent antiabortion Christian Democrat, Johanna von Westphalen.</TE>
<TE>   Besides choosing to live with but not marry the father of her
3-year-old daughter and unborn child, Reiche, an elder care
specialist from Potsdam, is an outspoken advocate of embryonic stem
cell research, in stark contrast to the prevailing views of her
party.</TE>
<TE>   Confident and unapologetic, she told journalists in Berlin on
Wednesday that she would probably marry her partner someday--but that
the when, where and why of the matter were no one else's business.</TE>
<TE>   She also expressed interest in taking on the Cabinet post of
minister for women, youth, families and seniors if Stoiber should
defeat Schroeder in September.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Catholic Church, which is influential in Bavaria, has
made its disapproval of Reiche apparent, the conservatives are
probably banking on their rural and religious supporters' having
little alternative but to vote for Stoiber.</TE>
<TE>   Recent polls indicate that the conservatives have a modest lead
over Schroeder's Social Democrats, but the incumbent still beats
Stoiber in any one-on-one contest.</TE>
<TE>   "If Stoiber wants to win, he has to be the candidate in the
political middle that everyone can vote for," said Gerhard Merk of
the local Abendzeitung newspaper. "Bavaria is a very conservative and
religious state, but who else are the Catholics going to vote for?"</TE>

<HD>Survivors Scarred by Iran Quake</HD>
<DH>Villagers wonder how they can rebuild lives and homes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHANGOUREH, Iran</DL>
<LD>From atop a pile of rubble that buried Dr. Achbar Esmaeli alive,
Jamsheed Amiri pointed to a deep black scar cutting across a hill in
the distance. That's the spot where the earth tore open and flames
shot out the morning a powerful earthquake devastated this roughly
300-year-old village, he said.</LD>
<LD>   Almost every home was destroyed, every family left to grieve the
death of a loved one. The losses were so far-reaching that it is
almost impossible to fathom how this village will get on; how it will
rebuild, physically and emotionally.</LD>
<LD>   The people walk up and down the dusty lanes, cleared out by
bulldozers, and stop to pick through the rubble of last month's
quake, searching for a relic of a life that was buried: a shirt, a
picture, an old rug.</LD>
<TE>   "My mother-in-law, my sister, my aunt," said Amiri, 60, listing
his dead family members.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother-in-law and my son," said Tammam Majadi, 40.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother, my father, my two sisters and my niece," said Hassan
Suleiman, 25.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother, uncle, brother, nine people," said Mohammed
Shanbeluha, 32.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone had the same numbing list and the same vacant expression
of disbelief.</TE>
<TE>   The earthquake struck this sparsely populated northwestern farming
region June 22. It was 7:28 in the morning, and most of the men had
gone out to the fields to work. Women, children and the elderly were
home. The quake had a magnitude of 6.3 and cut a path of destruction
through more than 100 villages scattered over the barren hills and
golden fields that stretch for hundreds of miles west from the
capital, Tehran. Officially, 235 people died, 1,300 were injured and
as many as 25,000 were left homeless.</TE>
<TE>   Ninety-three people died here.</TE>
<TE>   "Our life has been destroyed," said Hossein Mohammed Aliha, 53.
"We lost everything. My wife and two sons."</TE>
<TE>   These are poor people whose families have lived here for
generations; most residents are related by blood to one another. They
work in the fields, growing barley, grapes and other grains and
fruits. Their hands are callused and their faces wrinkled and
leathery from the sun.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, they build their homes out of mud and straw.
They have no choice, they say, because they cannot afford other
materials.</TE>
<TE>   When Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi ruled the country, many people
bristled at the great disparity between the haves and have-nots. Then
came the 1979 Islamic Revolution and the promise that there would be
a redistribution of wealth. For these villagers, that eventually
meant the arrival of electricity and phone service. But no one could
say why the progress stopped there, whether it was the cost of the
1980-88 war with Iraq or Iran's international pariah status from
trying to export revolutionary ideas to other countries.</TE>
<TE>   But the mud homes remained, even as experts warned that Iran sits
on one of the Earth's most seismically active zones and that no one
should be sleeping beneath a ceiling made of mud and sticks. The
structures were primitive, though elaborate, often with many rooms
and arched doorways. One could easily carve a hole through a wall
with a coin.</TE>
<TE>   Now the government is talking about putting up steel-and-brick
homes for everyone. Private companies are traveling through the
region, taking surveys, drawing up plans for rebuilding. Local
officials said the government has promised it will come to this
village, at least, to build homes for everyone.</TE>
<TE>   But the new dwellings will only be large enough for a few people;
if locals want to expand, they will have to do so on their own. And
they'll probably use the materials they can afford: mud and straw.</TE>
<TE>   "After the earthquake, the authorities told us we should change
the style of building to steel and brick," said Mohammed Eftekhari,
56, a resident of the nearby village of Tablashgin, where all 90
families were left homeless but no one was killed. "We have only a
few sheep and cows, nothing more. If they are not going to help us,
we will have to build out of mud and straw again."</TE>
<TE>   In Changoureh, residents are angry--and skeptical about their
government's concern. When Interior Minister Abdul Vahed Musavi-Lari
visited the day after the quake, people jeered at him and threw
rocks.</TE>
<TE>   There was a lot of confusion in the immediate aftermath of the
quake, and people are hard-pressed now to recall exactly what
happened when.</TE>
<TE>   But many in this village insist that if the government had
responded faster with rescue efforts, more people would have lived.</TE>
<TE>   It is difficult to determine whether this is a legitimate
grievance or a natural desire to blame someone for something that
seems beyond unfair. But there is a lot of second-guessing.</TE>
<TE>   "You could hear voices under the rubble until 11 [a.m.], but we
didn't receive help and they died," Majadi said. "My mother-in-law
was washing dishes. My son was asleep."</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed Asgeri, 36, said goodbye to his family the Friday before
the quake and headed into Tehran for his job as a driver. His
71-year-old father, Karam Ali, lived with the family and helped look
out for Asgeri's wife, Shalo, 33; son Mortazar, 13; and daughters
Mahsa, 11; Mojgan, 9; and Zahra, 6.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, the quake struck. Neighbors managed to pull
Zahra out of the rubble. They told Asgeri that his other children
were alive for hours--until aftershocks came, and then they fell
silent.</TE>
<TE>   Asgeri and his daughter now live in a small white tent, one of 150
pitched by the Red Crescent Society. The tents are lined up in rows
beneath the searing midday sun. At night, when temperatures drop,
they provide little protection against the cold.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the weather, there is too much idle time. For Asgeri that
means nothing to do but look after his daughter and stare at the
small color photo he has of his entire family, standing in the grass,
smiling. He shows it to anyone who will look.</TE>
<TE>   The government has promised to send bulldozers Monday to clear
away the mountains of debris and begin the slow process of
rebuilding. A few families rushed to salvage what they could from the
ruins, but others wandered around as if still in a trance.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very hard to get up from bed," said Aliha, whose sons were
15 and 25 when they were crushed in their beds. "We have cried so
much now we are out of tears."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HYDERABAD, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>As his lawyers completed their final arguments Friday, the chief
defendant in the kidnapping and murder of Wall Street Journal
reporter Daniel Pearl said Americans got what they deserved on Sept.
11 and warned of "more to come."</LD>
<LD>   In a message his lawyers said he passed to them in court, Ahmad
Omar Saeed Sheikh said the killing of civilians by U.S. forces in
Afghanistan on Monday and Israeli operations in Palestinian areas
would unleash more anger.</LD>
<LD>   "Following the barbaric bombardment of a wedding ceremony in
Afghanistan in which a number of innocent women and children were
killed, and the demolition of houses by Israeli troops in Palestine,
which again claimed a number of innocent lives, the Americans should
have realized by now that whatever happened on Sept. 11, not only did
they deserve that, but also there is more to come," Saeed said in the
message.</LD>
<TE>   Saeed, a British-born, former London School of Economics student,
is accused of masterminding Pearl's kidnapping in Karachi, Pakistan's
largest city.</TE>
<TE>   Saeed and three co-defendants have pleaded not guilty to murder
and terrorism charges.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Army Charges 2 in S. Korea Accident</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>Two American soldiers have been charged with negligent homicide for
hitting two South Korean girls with their armored vehicle, the U.S.
military said, reversing an earlier decision not to prosecute the
men.</LD>
<LD>   The deaths had touched off near-daily anti-U.S. protests. South
Korean activists demanded an apology and a South Korean trial of the
two soldiers.</LD>
<LD>   Sgts. Mark Walker and Fernando Nino, both from the Army's 2nd
Infantry Division, north of Seoul, were accused of violating the
Pentagon's Uniform Code of Military Justice, the U.S. military said
in a press release.</LD>
<TE>   The men's armored bridge carrier hit the 14-year-old girls as they
were walking along a road June 13 in Yangju, near the border with
North Korea. The vehicle was taking part in a training mission.</TE>
<TE>   The move was a reversal of an earlier U.S. decision not to
court-martial the two soldiers. Under an international agreement,
South Korea cannot punish U.S. soldiers involved in accidents while
on duty.</TE>
<TE>   There was no clear explanation about the change in the U.S.
position. Lee Ferguson, a spokeswoman for the U.S. military command,
said only that "the charge came after the internal U.S. Army
investigation."</TE>
<TE>   The trial is expected to take place at a U.S. military court in
South Korea, Ferguson said. If convicted, the soldiers face up to six
years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, 400 people protested in front of the 2nd Infantry
Division headquarters, clamoring for an end to the U.S. military
presence in South Korea. On Friday, a dozen activists staged a
similar protest in front of the U.S. military command in Seoul.</TE>

<HD>Bucking Tradition Sparks No-Confidence Vote</HD>
<DH>Japan: The Nagano governor's censure by his assembly points
up the hurdles for reformers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Self-proclaimed reformer and prize-winning author Yasuo Tanaka became
only the second Japanese governor since World War II to suffer a
no-confidence vote Friday after local assembly members censured him
by a 9-to-1 margin.</LD>
<LD>   The measure, which passed 44-5, could lead to Tanaka's ouster or
snap elections for a new assembly.</LD>
<LD>   Some saw Friday's dramatic confrontation, carried live by the
major television networks, as a last stand by a principled governor
against pork-barrel projects. Others said it was a vote by the Nagano
prefectural assembly against one individual's dictatorial and
unreasonable management style.</LD>
<TE>   Either way, the battle underscores the difficulties faced by any
politician trying to do things differently in a nation where
tradition is revered and the social and economic problems are
protracted.</TE>
<TE>   Tanaka, elected 21 months ago as an independent, made waves in the
conservative district from his first day on the job with his
flamboyant, unconventional style and reputation for womanizing. He
also ruffled feathers with his opposition to dams and other public
works projects, in a nation where construction has long been king.</TE>
<TE>   "Nagano Gov. Yasuo Tanaka is fast learning that when it comes to
dams, you're damned if you do and damned if you don't," the Mainichi
newspaper wrote soon after his election.</TE>
<TE>   Tanaka, who at 46 is Japan's youngest governor, had a glass office
built so voters and bureaucrats could watch what he was doing. He
once told government employees who didn't agree with his policies to
"go someplace like North Korea." And he's rarely seen without a
softball-sized lapel pin in the shape of an antelope on his flashy
suits--in a country where most politicians are derided for looking
like dobu nezumi, or drain rats.</TE>
<TE>   Tanaka wore a polka dot tie and a brave face at Friday's showdown,
triggered when he threatened to cancel the Asakawa and Shimosuwa dams
approved by the assembly years ago. A parade of aged assemblymen
filed past him and hardly glanced in his direction as they cast their
ballots to vote him from office.</TE>
<TE>   The no-confidence measure accused him of being self-righteous and
childish, among other things. Most of those who voted in favor were
members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, with only Communist
Party members voting against it.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to listen to the opinion of many Nagano citizens before
making a decision on what to do next," Tanaka told reporters shortly
after the early evening vote.</TE>
<TE>   Under local rules, he can resign; dissolve the assembly within 10
days, leading to a snap election; or do nothing and find himself out
of office within 10 days.</TE>
<TE>   Voters elected him in October 2000 by a huge margin for his
outsider stance and opposition to public works projects. Anti-reform
assembly members who took him on during the early days received hate
e-mail from voters calling them a "bunch of gangsters" and advising
them to "quit now."</TE>
<TE>   Polls still give him roughly a 50% support rate, but it's less
clear whether the public will stand strongly behind him in any new
electoral showdown.</TE>
<TE>   "I supported him initially, but as I've seen more of him I've
become more anxious," said Kiyoshi Minamiyama, 49, a restaurateur in
Matsumoto. "There's no clear views or policy on this dam issue. He's
too much like a showman."</TE>
<TE>   Were the electorate to return him with a strong mandate--and
trounce his assembly critics--the shock waves would be felt quickly
at the national level, where similar reform fights are underway.</TE>
<TE>   Political analysts argue, however, that several things have
changed since Tanaka's election. Nagano voters, arguably in line with
their counterparts everywhere, like the idea of reform but are less
enthusiastic when it directly affects their jobs and livelihood.</TE>
<TE>   The last two years have seen Nagano's economy deteriorate further
as the lift provided by the 1998 Winter Olympics evaporated, leaving
the prefecture and its 2.3 million residents with few economic
engines other than public works.</TE>
<TE>   Tanaka has also failed to take advantage of his electoral mandate.
Although he hasn't wavered in his opposition to public works
projects, critics say he has spent too much time squabbling openly
with bureaucrats and lawmakers. They also blame him for not working
the system or even making a convincing public case for Japan and
Nagano's need to end their love affair with public works spending.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not an able politician," said Hiroshi Takaku, an independent
political analyst. "He's just a great communicator."</TE>
<TE>   That said, many remain sympathetic to his message. There's a
growing acknowledgment even among the most die-hard rural voters that
the traditional pave-and-pave bias is wasteful, environmentally
destructive and ineffective.</TE>
<TE>   "Japanese people want a change," said Harumi Arima, an independent
political analyst.</TE>
<TE>   Public works projects no longer provide the economic stimulus they
once did, at a time when local debt levels are so high that
prefectures can't even afford to pay their 30% share of the burden
for central government projects.</TE>
<TE>   "Japan doesn't need any more dams, nor does Nagano," said Reiko
Amano, head of the Coalition to Halt Public Works Projects, a
nonprofit group. "Nagano, the mountainous backbone of Japan, is
particularly unsuited because it's on active fault lines that make
dams dangerous and susceptible to floods and landslides."</TE>
<TE>   Her group says there are now 2,700 dams across Japan, a nation
about the size of California, with 100 more under consideration.</TE>

<HD>In Iraq, U.S. Faces New Dynamics</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Analysts see little to deter Hussein from using
chemical and biological arms this time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Pentagon strategists crafting a plan for a potential invasion of Iraq
are contending with a problem they did not face during the 1991
Persian Gulf War: Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has little to lose
this time by unleashing weapons of mass destruction.</LD>
<LD>   During Operation Desert Storm, Hussein refrained from using
chemical and biological weapons against U.S. troops, apparently
reasoning that his regime could survive if he acceded to the
American-led coalition's demands and ended an Iraqi incursion into
Kuwait.</LD>
<LD>   Today, with Hussein's elimination the central reason cited by the
Bush administration for considering an invasion of his country,
military analysts say the Iraqi leader has little to deter him from
using the very weapons that war planners want to destroy.</LD>
<TE>   "We've talked ourselves, in many ways, into a war with Iraq
because [its] possession of weapons of mass destruction is
unacceptable, when it's almost certain that that very war is going to
lead to the use of weapons of mass destruction," said Ivo Daalder, a
military analyst at the Brookings Institution.</TE>
<TE>   That reality has forced military planners to emphasize preemptive
strikes against suspected chemical and biological weapons production
sites and unprecedented protection for American forces.</TE>
<TE>   The plan to invade Iraq, dubbed "Operation Polo Step," has not yet
reached Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld's desk. Under the plan,
special operations troops and airstrikes would destroy chemical and
biological weapons sites before the weapons there can be used against
an invading American force. The preemptive strikes in the contingency
plan, which was drafted by the U.S. Central Command and outlined in
the Los Angeles Times on June 23 by columnist William M. Arkin, would
likely occur before an invasion by as many as 250,000 troops.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even vigorous strikes are unlikely to eliminate Iraq's
suspected arsenal of taboo weapons, particularly mobile production
facilities and Scud missile launchers that are hard to track,
military analysts say. To protect troops from such weapons, Pentagon
officials are said to be stockpiling defensive material, including
chemical weapons suits, vaccines and medical evacuation equipment.</TE>
<TE>   The primary objective would be removing Hussein from power, and
therein lies the danger, said Loren Thompson, a military analyst with
the Lexington Institute think tank in Arlington, Va.</TE>
<TE>   "The way we've gone about preparing for this operation has
communicated very effectively to Saddam that he has nothing to lose
by doing something crazy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Different Kind of War'</TE>
<TE>   That leaves U.S. forces facing a dramatically altered conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "If we go after Iraq, it is a different kind of war in every way
you can imagine," said William Taylor, a retired Army colonel and
military analyst at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies. "Saddam wouldn't go down without using his ace in the hole,
which is a Scud missile with chemical or biological weapons on it."</TE>
<TE>   In any war blueprint, Pentagon strategists keep in mind an old
military aphorism: No plan survives contact with the enemy. With that
in mind, military planners must contemplate several nightmare
scenarios.</TE>
<TE>   Under one, special operations assaults and airstrikes leave
Hussein with some chemical or biological weapons and enough troops in
Baghdad, the capital, to force the U.S. military to fight an urban
battle, street by street, while facing clouds of chemical or
biological agents.</TE>
<TE>   Under another, the Iraqi leader, who launched Scud missiles toward
Tel Aviv in 1991, would use them to deliver chemical or biological
agents this time and draw Israel into the conflict. That could
undermine the support of predominantly Muslim countries drawn into
any U.S.-led coalition. Israel was not drawn into the Gulf War, but
it has recently shown an inclination to respond vigorously to attack,
and the Bush administration has defended Israel's right to
self-defense.</TE>
<TE>   "If he can get a 'dirty' bomb or whatever--some weapon of mass
destruction--into Tel Aviv, you're going to have Palestinians jumping
in the streets," Daalder said. "And it's going to change the
dynamic."</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials declined to confirm the existence of the
classified plan, but they acknowledged that regional commanders are
developing strategies for potential conflicts in their territories.</TE>
<TE>   "It should not come as any surprise that the U.S. Defense
Department is continually planning all the time for possible
contingencies around the world," said Pentagon spokesman Bryan
Whitman.</TE>
<TE>   Military analysts caution that the plan has not reached the
president and is one of perhaps a dozen proposals related to Iraq
under consideration within the Pentagon's Office of Strategic
Planning, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other agencies.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal, detailed in a 150-slide presentation by the Central
Command, revealed a moderate concern about the levels of chemical and
biological weapons, a source familiar with the plan said, suggesting
that Pentagon officials do not believe that Hussein's development of
weapons of mass destruction has advanced seriously since the Gulf
War.</TE>
<TE>   Despite an apparent lack of support for the proposal from members
of the 1991 coalition such as Saudi Arabia, the United States has
advantages it did not have last time, including more accurate air
power and more extensive intelligence. Suspected chemical and
biological weapons sites in Iraq have been pinpointed by intelligence
officials who have spent the last decade compiling surveillance
photos and other data.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Smarter 'Smart' Bombs</TE>
<TE>   And although only one in 10 bombs dropped by American pilots in
the Gulf War were guided "smart" bombs, that figure grew to six in 10
last fall in Afghanistan. During the Gulf War, it took hours to get
intelligence on the movement of Scud missile launchers. Defense
officials say bombers can now strike such targets within 30 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has repeatedly promised to oust Hussein one way or
another. The disclosure, by this and other publications, of war
strategies the Pentagon is discussing sometimes originates among
those disaffected with the plan, including officials with the Air
Force and other services who call it unimaginative and say it fails
to take advantage of the air power demonstrated in the war in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "A preemptive strategy is supposed to be a surprise. This one's
going to be in the Encyclopedia Britannica before it's executed,"
analyst Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   The criticism also reflects the fact that administration officials
disagree over the best strategy to unseat Hussein and curtail
production of weapons of mass destruction. Wayne A. Downing, a
retired Army general who recently quit his post at the National
Security Council, was among those arguing for a less conventional
strategy that would rely heavily on Iraqi opposition groups, special
operations troops, an unprecedented air campaign and fewer U.S.
ground forces.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Criticism of Proposal</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of such a plan have their critics. In Afghanistan, they
note, the Central Command opted in December to rely on high-tech
surveillance, air raids and Afghan fighters to ferret out Osama bin
Laden and members of his Al Qaeda terrorist organization who were
believed to be hiding in the mountains of Tora Bora. After failing to
locate Bin Laden and finding that many of the guerrillas had escaped,
defense officials again targeted the same region of Afghanistan in
March, using large numbers of ground troops in a U.S.-led force.</TE>
<TE>   "The way we win wars is by taking territory on the ground,"
analyst Daalder said. "Osama was in Tora Bora and got out because we
didn't put troops on the ground and relied on our neat gizmos ... and
didn't do it in the way we would have done it 30, 50 or 100 years
ago, with men on the ground. We might have been more effective if we
had done that."</TE>
<TE>   According to a U.S. official with knowledge of internal war
planning discussions, the debate pits two sides within the Pentagon
against each other: the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which is skeptical
about a major military operation against Iraq, and civilian hawks in
the defense secretary's office, including Deputy Defense Secretary
Paul D. Wolfowitz and Undersecretary for Policy Douglas Feith, who
are considered pro-Israel and skeptical of Arab critics of a war with
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the merits of the competing approaches, the persistent
public discussion of plans for invading Iraq makes their actual
execution less likely, Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   "First of all, we've given Saddam ample time to make every
preparation possible for our arrival," he said. Secondly, he added,
it will "force us to try something different in order to overcome his
preparation."</TE>

<DH>Arabs: Muslims and others from the Mideast fear they'll be
viewed as sharing 'collective guilt.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE and PETER HONG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once again, violence broke out this week between an Arab and
Israelis--this time at Los Angeles International Airport.</LD>
<LD>   Once again, the attack was labeled a "terrorist act"--this time by
Israeli officials characterizing the way Egyptian-born Hesham Mohamed
Hadayat had killed two Israelis.</LD>
<LD>   And, once again, the American Muslim community shuddered, heaved a
collective sigh and braced itself for yet another round of public
scrutiny and suspicion.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a terrible, horrible crime, but any action committed by
an Arab or Muslim becomes viewed as collective guilt--that's the
problem," said Muzammil Siddiqi of the Islamic Center of Orange
County. "People don't say he was a crazy person; they say he was a
Muslim or Arab terrorist."</TE>
<TE>   Hussam Ayloush of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in
Anaheim said no other religious group has been "put in a position
where they have to prove their innocence because of the acts of [a]
few....</TE>
<TE>   "Before, the definition of terrorism was based on the action, not
on the ethnicity, of the attacker," Ayloush said. "Now it seems the
definition has shifted, based on who's doing it. This is outrageous
and racist."</TE>
<TE>   Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Ayloush said, his
civil-rights organization has received 1,400 complaints of
discrimination and harassment, ranging from murders to verbal abuse.
The usual number reported is 200 to 300 annually.</TE>
<TE>   He added that most Americans have treated Muslims with "respect
and understanding."</TE>
<TE>   Many Muslims are concerned, however, that the attack by Hadayat,
an Irvine resident, will perpetuate the image that the American
Islamic community is harboring "sleeper terrorist cells."</TE>
<TE>   That argument is gaining wider exposure in books and lectures by
such controversial figures as Steven Emerson, an investigative
journalist who specializes in terrorism, and Daniel Pipes, editor of
the Middle East Quarterly. The two frequently write and speak on the
dangers of radical Islam, winning praise from some as fearless
truth-tellers and condemnation from others as irresponsible
fear-mongers.</TE>
<TE>   Emerson's new book, "American Jihad: The Terrorists Living Among
Us," is the No. 1 bestseller among Amazon.com's 113 books on jihad.</TE>
<TE>   The book, published in February, ranks 627th among all of
Amazon.com's listings--compared with the ranking of the book by a
Southland Muslim leader, Maher Hathout, "Jihad vs. Terrorism," at
1,027,965. Hathout's book describes jihad benevolently as an internal
spiritual struggle.</TE>
<TE>   Emerson said Hadayat did not appear to have been a member of any
"sleeper cell" but acted in what Emerson called a "personalized
jihad," driven by "an extremist ideology and appeal that made him
believe it was acceptable, if not mandatory, to go out and kill
Jews." Emerson blamed "American Muslim leaders and the religious
hierarchy" for promoting such extremism.</TE>
<TE>   More than 20 books have been released this year on the "Islamic
menace," according to Khaled Abou El Fadl, a UCLA professor of
Islamic law.</TE>
<TE>   "All of this is desensitizing people to hateful speech," Abou El
Fadl said. "With this constant drumbeat, people are emotionally and
psychologically willing to believe all kinds of nasty things about
Islam."</TE>
<TE>   Such fears were echoed at the Islamic Society of Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as I heard the news," said Siddiqi, the director, "the
first thought was, 'I hope the [gunman] is not Muslim.' "</TE>
<TE>   At the Islamic Center of Southern California in Koreatown, the
afternoon prayer service drew about 700 faithful Friday--men in one
room, women in another.</TE>
<TE>   In his sermon, Hathout said that, even if they fear an anti-Muslim
backlash, they must not "hide in a cocoon; it will not offer you
safety or security." Few people expressed fears over safety. Since
Sept. 11, the center has actually received an outpouring of public
support, said Mahmoud Abdel-Baset, the center's religious and social
services coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   He pointed to the American flag flying above the center, noting it
had been donated by two Asian American veterans.</TE>
<TE>   But Abdel-Baset said he is worried about the compromising of civil
liberties by the government, citing as an example the detaining of
Arab or Muslim Americans without indictments. The Egyptian native,
who left his country 34 years ago, said he fears that the United
States could eventually begin using national security as a
justification to "eliminate its opponents," as he said Egypt does.</TE>
<TE>   One person who said he regularly faces anti-Muslim hostility is
Saeed Dar, 36, who works at a Los Angeles gas station.</TE>
<TE>   Dar said customers at the gas station who see his name on his
uniform regularly insult him, and one threatened to attack him after
he got off work.</TE>
<TE>   As Dar prayed in the parking lot, kneeling on a thin carpet and
bowing to Mecca, a four-letter, boldface imprint on his backward
baseball cap, celebrating heroes of Sept. 11, became visible: FDNY.</TE>

<LD>About three decades ago, El Al, the Israeli national airline,
negotiated special permission with American authorities to station
armed undercover agents in U.S. airports, a former El Al official
said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   El Al had such agents in the Tom Bradley International Terminal on
Thursday in accordance with the agreement, said Joel Feldschuh, who
served as chief executive of the airline from 1996 to 2000 and is now
a private aviation security consultant.</LD>
<LD>   He refused to say whether the agents who subdued and killed the
gunman Thursday worked for El Al or an Israeli government security
service.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not a big difference," Feldschuh said. "El Al is a
government-owned company. What is most important to know is that they
are well trained."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Walsh, who heads the global aviation security practice for
Mercer Management Consulting, said he was familiar in general with
the agreement, which in addition to allowing El Al to have armed
undercover agents in U.S. airports, allows the Israeli carrier to
have armed agents aboard planes landing in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   One U.S. government official who spoke on condition of anonymity
confirmed the arrangement, saying: "Let me put it this way: No one
was surprised to hear that El Al had undercover people carrying
weapons."</TE>
<TE>   Security consultants said the Israeli national carrier may be the
only airline in the world that regularly provides armed protection in
otherwise unsecured sections of airports.</TE>
<TE>   Because El Al has long been a terrorist target and is subsidized
by its government, it spends far more than other carriers on
security, 8% of its revenue contrasted with about 0.5% across the
industry, consultants said.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>It's belt-tightening time in the Capitol--in more ways than one.</LD>
<LD>   As legislators struggle to cut fat from a bloated state budget,
many are waging their own private battles of the bulge.</LD>
<LD>   Diet season is in full swing in Sacramento, producing a crop of
leaner, meaner political fighting machines better able to withstand
the stress of lawmaking--and, not incidentally, more likely to look
good on the campaign trail.</LD>
<TE>   Trapped in an insular world of gastronomic excess, long hours and
sedentary floor sessions, legislators are forever striving to shed
weight. Before an election, the pressure is more intense, as campaign
consultants gently remind them that the TV camera adds 10 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the weight-loss craze has taken hold with unusual
ferocity. Though the public debate is about taxes, deficits and
agonizing policy choices, the backroom talk often dwells on who lost
how much--and, more important, how they did it.</TE>
<TE>   Let us count the pounds:</TE>
<TE>   * Assemblyman Rod Pacheco (R-Riverside) has dropped 101 on a
doctor-supervised program that requires him to eat what he ruefully
calls "pseudo food."</TE>
<TE>   * Sen. Martha Escutia (D-Whittier) is down 25 pounds with the help
of a personal trainer and a determination to just say no to the
mounds of sweets in the Senate lounge.</TE>
<TE>   * Sen. Jim Brulte (R-Rancho Cucamonga) and Assemblyman Dennis
Cardoza (D-Merced) wanted more immediate results, and turned to
surgeons to help them lose about 100 pounds apiece.</TE>
<TE>   "Legislators have lost hundreds of thousands of pounds through the
years, only to gain them back and lose them again," Brulte said
recently between bites of a Chinese chicken salad.</TE>
<TE>   Though staying healthy is what motivates many dieting lawmakers,
Brulte said politicians have an extra incentive: the need to run for
reelection.</TE>
<TE>   "We're graded every two or four years," he said, "and it's pass or
fail."</TE>
<TE>   The politician's war on fat actually begins the day of the
decision to run for office. Once in the race, a candidate is
consigned to a grueling schedule of lunches with advisors,
fund-raising dinners with donors and endless "meet-and-greets" with
future constituents. There is little time for steaming broccoli or
swimming laps.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Schnur, a GOP consultant, said, "A politician's lifestyle
probably couldn't be designed to be more damaging to someone's
health." Even the grub at campaign headquarters is bad, he said:
doughnuts in the morning and "three-day-old pizza" after dark.</TE>
<TE>   When the victorious arrive in Sacramento for their first terms,
their lives are jam-packed with learning the ropes, writing bills and
studying for policy committees. Thrown off their normal routines, all
but the most disciplined watch good dining habits vanish.</TE>
<TE>   Many eat every meal out. Most attend five or six fund-raising
receptions a night, where a minefield of temptation awaits: platters
of fried finger food, open bars, mountains of cheese.</TE>
<TE>   More trouble lurks in the members' lounges, where lawmakers gab
between bills or during caucus meetings. Ice cream bars beckon from
the freezers, cookies and pastries tempt on tables, enchiladas arrive
for lunch. One lounge specialty stirs moans of pleasure and pain:
banana cream pie from a famous local eatery, Frank Fat's.</TE>
<TE>   Sooner or later, most legislative newcomers confront the
inevitable "freshman 10"--or 20, or 30, depending on the degree of
gluttony.</TE>
<TE>   "Coming to Sacramento is like joining the 'Love Boat'," Pacheco
said. "There's food around 24 hours a day, it's all free and it's all
good and it's all you can eat. You think you've died and gone to
heaven."</TE>
<TE>   The morning after, however, can be painful.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblywoman Charlene Zettel (R-Poway) gained 25 pounds her
rookie year, weight she attributes not just to the hectic schedule
but to "loneliness munching, being away from home."</TE>
<TE>   For Assemblyman Abel Maldonado (R-Santa Maria), it was 36 pounds.
At first he hid his expanding girth beneath baggy suits. Now, he's a
disciple of a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet that is popular
with many lawmakers because it delivers quick results.</TE>
<TE>   "It's super, super hard, but the weight has come off," Maldonado
said. Opening a desk drawer, he showed his secret stash: "I've got
four cans of tuna, six cans of chunky chicken and a can of Spam," he
said. But not a sliver of bread.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) also bulked up as a
freshman, gaining 15 pounds. His problem? The evening fund-raisers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a rich man, so I figured, hey, this is great, I can go
out and eat for free every night," he said. What's worse, he began
taking doggie bags full of food home from the parties.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd get home with some lamb chops, microwave those suckers, dip
them in mint jelly at 11:30 at night," Wesson recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Alarmed by the scale, he initially tried the "cabbage diet" to
slim back down--"I stayed on it for about three hours."</TE>
<TE>   Now he cooks a big pot of something healthful--"like my jammin'
chicken and noodle dish"--on Sunday night, and eats leftovers during
the week.</TE>
<TE>   Wesson has also made a change in the speaker's office, where the
former tenant, Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks), kept heaping bowls of
chocolates around for all to munch. Wesson's offering? Rice cakes and
carrot sticks.</TE>
<TE>   Some Capitol dwellers are legendary for their dietary discipline.
At the head of that list is California's governor.</TE>
<TE>   Close associates of Gray Davis say they have never seen a person
of greater gustatory willpower. Davis starts each morning with a tofu
shake flavored with frozen berries, they say, then has carved turkey,
broccoli and water for lunch--every day.</TE>
<TE>   Dinner is a bit more exotic, but Davis never ventures into the
high-fat zone. He also avoids soda and has a glass of wine only
occasionally. He rides a stationary bike each morning and keeps up
his energy by munching protein bars throughout the day.</TE>
<TE>   "He's like Dr. Pritikin's evil twin," said one associate,
comparing Davis with the diet guru.</TE>
<TE>   In the Assembly, Carole Migden (D-San Francisco) is another model
of restraint, staying trim despite her stressful job as chairwoman of
the powerful Appropriations Committee. Asked to share her secret,
Migden came clean: "Deprivation. It works every time."</TE>
<TE>   Like society at large, the Legislature has evolved in the food
choices it provides to members. When Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del
Rey) arrived in Sacramento in 1993, doughnuts were the only morning
snack in the lounge.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, after a lot of griping, we've got cottage cheese,
bagels--even carrots and celery," Bowen said. Over in the Assembly,
Migden said the staff has responded to her requests for vegetarian
meals, but occasionally disappoints: "One time, I got two pieces of
bread with raw eggplant between them," she recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Though there is no gym for legislators, the nearby Capital
Athletic Club offers them a deal on memberships. But only about 10
lawmakers--out of 120--belong, the sales manager said.</TE>
<TE>   Several others burn calories on the treadmill and the Stairmaster
in the Senate's women's lounge, Sen. Escutia among them. Escutia, who
gained 20 pounds her freshman year and 40 more during two
pregnancies, said she's "a little envious" of colleagues who have
lost weight recently through surgery or special diets. "I'm just
trying to sweat it off," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Tom Torlakson (D-Antioch), a triathlete and the Legislature's
unofficial fitness promoter, said Escutia has the right idea. A
former running coach, he said regular exercise helps lawmakers keep
the mind sharp. In an election season, working out can bring other
benefits--such as another term. Political advisors say voters make up
their minds about a candidate in seconds, largely on the basis of
visual impressions.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're packing too much poundage, it can hurt," said a GOP
consultant, Ray McNally. "Rightly or wrongly, it sends a message
that, 'Here's somebody who's not too energetic and may not be up to
the job.' "</TE>
<TE>   Though no one doubted the abilities of the former Assembly
speaker, Jess Unruh, even he periodically tried crash diets to shed
the nickname partly inspired by his ample girth: "Big Daddy."</TE>
<TE>   Tony Beard, the Senate's chief sergeant at arms, has seen many
trends in his 21 years on the job. In the old days, he recalled,
there was an ashtray on every desk, and the only jogging legislators
did was "over to the Hotel Senator for a Scotch at 4 o'clock."</TE>
<TE>   "Times have sure changed," he said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The fatal Independence Day shooting at Los Angeles International
Airport highlights just how difficult it is to protect people who use
the nation's airports from random acts of violence.</LD>
<LD>   Even with the heightened security in place since the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, there is nothing to prevent someone carrying a
weapon from walking into one of the nation's 429 commercial airports,
which are essentially public places like shopping malls or grocery
stores.</LD>
<LD>   Hesham Mohamed Hadayet, the gunman in Thursday's incident, carried
three weapons--a 9-millimeter handgun, a .45-caliber semiautomatic
Glock pistol and a six-inch hunting knife. He had extra ammunition
and magazines ready to go, the FBI said Friday.</LD>
<TE>   Officials said it's likely the carnage would have been even worse
if the suspect had been at any airport ticket counter other than the
one occupied by El Al Israel Airlines, where armed guards are present
at all times. Three were killed in the shooting in the Tom Bradley
International Terminal, including the suspect, and three were
wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Protecting airports against such incidents in the future won't be
easy. New federal aviation security laws don't provide for additional
security at airport ticket counters or baggage claim areas. And most
airports aren't designed to move security checkpoints closer to the
front door.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Mayor James K. Hahn said Friday that the shooting
reinforced his plans to increase security at LAX, a tenet he
emphasizes in the $9.6-billion modernization plan he unveiled at the
airport earlier this week.</TE>
<TE>   In preparing his plan, Hahn said he met with a former head of
security for El Al--known worldwide for its strict security
procedures--who convinced the mayor that LAX needs stronger security
measures.</TE>
<TE>   "They want a failsafe, zero-tolerance system; they don't accept
anything else," Hahn said in an interview. "I don't think we can bury
our heads in the sand anymore. I think we need to go to the El Al
level of security."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor added that his staff is going to consider moving the
screening of passengers and baggage farther away from airport
terminals. In Hahn's plan, passengers and their luggage would still
travel through security at the terminals.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, Thursday's shooting abruptly shifted the discussion
about aviation security away from airplanes and toward how airports
can better protect their facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "To protect the airport itself, one has to decide where you draw
the security line," said Brian Jenkins, a senior advisor to the
president of the Rand Corp. and a former member of the White House
Commission on Aviation and Security. "An airport is a city--it has
thousands of people working in it, and tens of thousands of people
constantly passing through it."</TE>
<TE>   Some Middle Eastern airports--including facilities in Jordan, the
United Arab Emirates, India and Pakistan--screen passengers and
baggage well before the ticket counter. But moving bulky
magnetometers and X-ray machines closer to terminal doors won't work
at most major U.S. airports--which, in most cases, were designed
before a spate of hijackings prompted the installation of security
equipment in the early 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   The Transportation Security Administration, which has jurisdiction
over passenger and baggage screening at the nation's airports, said
Friday that it doesn't plan to move security checkpoints closer to
terminal doors.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the traveling public and the airlines, which are
loath to compromise passenger convenience, aren't likely to support
moving passenger checkpoints.</TE>
<TE>   "Airports in many cases are large commercial shopping centers,"
said Billie H. Vincent, a former head of security for the Federal
Aviation Administration. "One would be restricting the terminal to
passengers only, and that would considerably reduce the amount of
sales in the process."</TE>
<TE>   The TSA, however, is working with airport officials and local
police agencies to increase the presence of law enforcement in
airports, said Deirdre O'Sullivan, a TSA spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of moving security checkpoints, U.S. airport officials
could adopt a system used at Middle Eastern airports that relies on
"concentric circles" to provide security for passengers, experts
said.</TE>
<TE>   That would include security that starts at the airport entrance
and continues inside the facility with plainclothes and uniformed
officers, said Jeff Schlanger, chief operating officer of the
security services group at Kroll Inc. in New York.</TE>
<TE>   There are several other steps airports can take to protect against
random violence, experts said, including moving passengers through
security checkpoints faster to reduce casualties should an incident
occur in a ticket lobby or baggage claim area. An increased number of
security personnel and closed-circuit cameras also might help deter
criminals, said Jenkins, the Rand Corp. advisor.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Police Department did increase its presence at LAX
after Thursday's incident and plans to keep additional officers and
squad cars at the airport throughout the holiday weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Security at LAX is carried out by an amalgam of agencies,
including the airport police, the LAPD, the TSA, the FBI and the FAA.
The agencies have drawn up agreements about which has jurisdiction
during certain events. The airport police typically try to prevent
incidents, while the LAPD primarily responds when a crime occurs at
the 3,500-acre facility.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI took charge of Thursday's investigation because of the
possibility that terrorism was involved. Airport police and the LAPD
provided perimeter security and crowd control.</TE>
<TE>   Questions arose Friday about whether this complex security
structure contributed to the chaos at the nation's third-busiest
airport following the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Airport officials agreed that the incident looked messy and
inconvenienced thousands for hours, as did other highly publicized
airport evacuations around the country after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   But they added that the agencies charged with providing security
at LAX don't have the resources to baby-sit stranded passengers.</TE>
<TE>   "We have thousands of people to deal with, and the path never
turns off--people are constantly arriving at the airport," said
Bernard J. Wilson, the chief of airport police. "The reality is law
enforcement agencies don't have the resources to go around and give
everyone updates."</TE>
<TE>   Though many agreed the coordination among the various agencies
went well on Thursday, the incident brought to the surface a
long-standing rivalry between the airport police and the LAPD.
Numerous attempts have been made to consolidate the forces--including
one by former Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, which was
rejected by the City Council in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The airport police department was established in 1946, and given
full authority over the airport in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   But some said Friday that having two police departments at the
airport is inefficient. Police Commission President Rick Caruso said
the incident made him believe more strongly that the LAPD should
handle all LAX security.</TE>
<TE>   "The LAPD has a lot of expertise, and it's gaining more in dealing
with anti-terrorism," Caruso said. "I think there should be one
integrated force that's sharing the information and the expertise and
are trained with the same standards."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said he does not believe the airport police and the LAPD
should be consolidated.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's valuable to have both agencies out there," Hahn
said. "As far as I'm concerned, I don't know if it's necessary."</TE>
<TE>   But he acknowledged that some city officials are discussing the
possibility.</TE>
<TE>   Voters would have to approve an amendment to the City Charter
before the LAPD could take control of the airport police, according
to the new charter adopted in 2000.</TE>

<LD>A day after a 41-year-old Egyptian immigrant walked into Los Angeles
International Airport and killed two people at an El Al ticket
counter, authorities said they had uncovered no evidence that the man
had any connection to organized terrorist groups, or that he had
quarreled with anyone at the airport prior to pulling out his
weapons.</LD>
<LD>   FBI officials said they were still looking for clues of terrorist
connections to the assailant, a devout Muslim who died in the ensuing
shootout with security guards. They also said they were trying to
figure out if the gunman, Hesham Mohamed Hadayet, might have been
despondent, suicidal, motivated by ethnic hatred--or a combination of
all of those factors.</LD>
<LD>   Terrorism, however, "certainly can't be ruled out," said FBI
spokesman Matt McLaughlin.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities said they had little meaningful evidence so far, and
appealed for the public's help.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Hadayet parked his new Mercedes with personalized
license plates "GOALIS" in the parking garage directly in front of
the El Al Israel Airlines ticket counter shortly before the 11:30
a.m. shooting. Dressed in a dark suit jacket and light shirt, he
carried a 6-inch knife in a scabbard on his hip, and had 9-millimeter
and .45-caliber handguns. Both guns were registered to him. He also
had a loaded magazine for each weapon stuffed in each of his
pockets--the 9 millimeter in his right front pocket, the .45 in his
left.</TE>
<TE>   Arranging the magazines in this way suggested he intended to fire
many rounds, officials said, and that he had experience using
firearms.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the most efficient way to reload," McLaughlin said. "He
didn't get that opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Hadayet began firing toward the counter from somewhere in the
ticket line, about 20 feet back, McLaughlin said. He said
investigators had concluded that witness reports of an argument
preceding the shots were unsubstantiated, and they believe the man
said nothing before firing.</TE>
<TE>   An unarmed El Al security guard nearby was the first to leap
toward him in an effort to tackle him. This guard grabbed the
attacker, who was still holding his gun, but could not immediately
subdue him, and Hadayet was able to fire more shots.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't say a single word," recalled one bystander, Orna Yarzin
of Los Angeles, who said the gunman was firing with a deliberate air,
aiming and shooting rather than firing indiscriminately.</TE>
<TE>   As the two wrestled, a second, armed security guard behind the
counter moved forward, firing possibly two times as he approached the
melee, and ultimately joining the struggle, along with at least one
bystander, McLaughlin said. At least two passengers claimed Thursday
to have helped subdue the gunman, and several bystanders corroborated
the account of one of them, Israeli emigre Arie Golan.</TE>
<TE>   During the fight, the armed guard was stabbed three times by the
assailant, including once through the back.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very dynamic situation," McLaughlin said. "One security
guard was wrestling him while he was shooting. The El Al security
guard leapt over the counter, fired one round at some range and fired
one or more rounds as he closed, because the man continued to fire.
He had the knife with a 6-inch blade in the other hand and was
wielding that as well."</TE>
<TE>   The exact sequence of events remains unclear, however, said
McLaughlin, including such details as when bystanders joined the
fight and when the shooter's gun skittered away.</TE>
<TE>   McLaughlin disputed accounts from bystanders that Hadayet had been
shot after being disarmed and held on the ground. The Los Angeles
Police Department also cited contradictory accounts. McLaughlin said
authorities do not know exactly when Hadayet received the fatal shot,
or at what range.</TE>
<TE>   He said the gunman may have been shot as the second security guard
approached him, and that he had managed to continue struggling for
some moments after receiving the mortal wound. Law enforcement
officials did not deny witness accounts that Hadayet was shot while
held on the ground. But they suggested a different sequence of
events.</TE>
<TE>   Several witnesses gave similar accounts to The Times. Among them
was Hakim Hafidh, a fitness instructor from Germany, who was checking
in at the adjacent LTU International Airways terminal when the
shooting began. He said he saw one security guard and Golan wrestle
the man to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "When he fell to the ground, the gun fell to the side," Hafidh
said. "I heard someone scream 'Don't touch the gun!' "</TE>
<TE>   Next, according to Hafidh, his girlfriend, Petra Dutschek, and two
companions, William and Cornelia Bergmann, the second El Al security
guard approached the writhing trio and shot the gunman.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt he had lost [the struggle] before they shot him," Hafidh
said.</TE>
<TE>   That account may not conflict significantly with the FBI's version
of events, however. Although Hadayet may have dropped one gun, he had
another, and was able to seriously wound the second guard with a
knife.</TE>
<TE>   "Our understanding is that he was still struggling, he was still
fighting with both the knife and the pistol. He may have been on the
floor, but until the moment he died he was still armed and fighting,"
said David Douek, spokesman for the Israeli Consulate in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   An autopsy will be performed. Coroner's spokesman Craig Harvey
said Hadayet's body had not yet been examined--in fact, was still
clothed Friday--and therefore authorities could not say how many
times he had been shot, or where. Law enforcement authorities would
not describe the wounds, although their accounts suggest he may have
been shot twice. A photograph taken by a bystander appears to show a
wound in the abdomen.</TE>
<TE>   The dead bystanders were Israeli emigre Jacob Aminov, 46, a
diamond importer who lived in North Hollywood, and Victoria Hen, a
25-year-old immigrant from Israel working as a ticket agent for a
company under contract with El Al.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities praised the two security guards who risked their lives
to subdue Hadayet. So too did Andrew Phillips, a Canadian whose
mother, Sarah Phillips, 61, was shot in the right ankle. She was one
of two people hospitalized for injuries in the attack. The El Al
guard was the other.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they handled a terrible situation really well," Andrew
Phillips said. "They stopped this madman, or whatever he was."</TE>
<TE>   Sarah Phillips was recovering Friday at Centinela Hospital after
surgery to repair four tendons damaged by the gunshot. She had been
planning to take an El Al flight to Toronto. From her hospital bed,
she recalled that when a bolt of pain hit her ankle, she assumed a
firecracker had hit her.</TE>
<TE>   "Then people started shouting 'Get down! Get down!' and I knew it
was a gun, I knew I'd been shot," she said.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD investigators said they used fingerprints from a weapon used
in the attack to link the gunman to state Department of Motor Vehicle
records, got a description of his car, then found it in the parking
garage in the late afternoon. Authorities said they found Hadayet's
driver's license in the car but no ticket or luggage.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities plan to search his home computer and bank records, and
were examining documents found in his home in both English and
Arabic, FBI officials said. They said they had reviewed videotapes
from airport security cameras but had found no footage of the attack.</TE>
<TE>   In the hours immediately after the shooting, Israeli authorities
said they believed it was an act of terrorism. U.S. officials said it
appeared to be an isolated incident unrelated to international
terror.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, both sides softened their stances. U.S. officials said
they were not discounting the possibility of terrorism. And Douek,
the Israeli consular spokesman, said Israel was not ruling out the
possibility that the attack was motivated by something else.</TE>
<TE>   "When it comes down to it, the difference may not be that great,"
Douek said. "What we're saying is that given the circumstances, the
background of the attacker, the airline and past history, it looks to
us very much like it's a terrorist attack.... Until that's ruled out,
that's our top consideration. We're not saying it definitely was a
terrorist attack but that it appears to be."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Garcia, special agent in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles
criminal branch, said Hadayet arrived in the United States in 1992.
"He's obtained a green card and has the status to stay in the country
based on that green card," he said. "He has no criminal history."</TE>
<TE>   Ron Rogers, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, described Hadayet as a legal permanent resident who entered
the United States in July 1992 on a tourist visa.</TE>
<TE>   That authorized him to remain in the country until January 1993.
He then applied for a green card--a legal residency card--and was
turned down in February 1996. The INS put him in deportation
proceedings. Before he could be deported, however, Hadayet won a
reprieve in August 1997 when his wife, Hala, won a green card through
a lottery.</TE>
<TE>   Every year, 55,000 immigrant visas are available through the
Department of State's diversity lottery program for people from
countries with low rates of immigration to the United States. Winners
in this lottery receive a visa authorizing them along with their
spouse and any unmarried children under 21 to live and work
permanently in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Hadayet's wife and two sons are in Cairo visiting relatives.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday morning, Egyptian police arrived at the apartment of
Hadayet's father in downtown Cairo, the building's security guards
said. The guards would not let reporters go up to the apartment in
the six-story building in Abbasiya, a middle-class section of the
Egyptian capital. Hadayet's uncle Hassan Mostafa Mahfouz said
Hadayet's wife and sister had been picked up by Egyptian intelligence
for questioning. FBI officials also interviewed family members.</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes later, a woman arrived, and shouted at reporters,
saying, "I will not speak to these dogs who have no respect for
death!" She would not identify herself but neighbors said she was
Hadayet's wife.</TE>
<TE>   Mahfouz said Hadayet did not belong to any political or religious
group. "He was an average Muslim who prays regularly just like we all
do."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe what happened," he added. "I don't believe the
American government's reports because they are confusing."</TE>
<TE>   He said Hadayet had worked as an accountant in a bank in Cairo
before he went to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Police in Irvine, where Hadayet and his family lived, said they
had had three encounters with him since 1996--once as a robbery
victim, once as a crime witness and once when they were called to
investigate a domestic dispute.</TE>
<TE>   In the domestic case, Irvine Police Lt. Dave Freedland said, both
Hadayet and his wife told officers in May 1996 that each had been the
victim of an assault and battery by the other. Prosecutors declined
to file charges against either of them, he said, citing a lack of
evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors at the Woodbridge Pines Apartments described Hadayet as
a devoutly religious man who had somewhat chilly relations with his
non-Muslim neighbors. They said his wife and sons were much
friendlier."I tried to say hi to him when he first moved in and he
completely ignored me," said Pamela Paulson, 51, who lives two
apartments away.</TE>
<TE>   "He was stone cold. If he looked at you, he looked right through
you."</TE>

<HD>World Travelers on Their Way After Harrowing Delay</HD>
<DH>Airport: Some at the international terminal are still
rattled over the previous day's violence, and some are upset at their
treatment amid the confusion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA MURILLO and LIZ F. KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Christine Ramirez had been en route from her Central California home
to Mexico since Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   By Friday morning she was sleep-deprived, hungry and no further
than a ticket counter at Los Angeles International Airport.</LD>
<LD>   She had gotten off her bus from Madera--northwest of Fresno--in
the wee hours of Thursday morning and was waiting at LAX for her 2
p.m. flight when she heard gunshots and people screaming. She ducked
behind some chairs.</LD>
<TE>   "I wanted to go home," said the 20-year-old wife and mother.</TE>
<TE>   The airline, she says, wouldn't pay for a hotel room Thursday
night, and she didn't have money for one.</TE>
<TE>   "They said I could freshen up in the bathroom. Have you ever tried
freshening up in an airport bathroom?" she asked, sunburned from her
hours-long wait outside Thursday when the international terminal was
evacuated after shots were fired at the El Al Israel Airlines
counter.</TE>
<TE>   Friday morning, legions of stranded passengers, some still rattled
by what they had heard or seen in the flash of violence that left
three people dead on the Fourth of July, trudged back to the
international terminal to finish their interrupted journeys.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez was one of them. She spent the night shivering on a hard
airport bench under a thin blanket. Fellow travelers shared snacks.
Now she was on her way, again, to Durango, Mexico, to retrieve her
year-old daughter, who has been visiting her grandparents for two
months.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to mess with traveling anymore," Ramirez said. "I
wouldn't even be trying to get on a plane if I didn't have to get my
daughter. I told my husband [that] next time I go see my in-laws, I'm
going by bus."</TE>
<TE>   The day after the shootings passengers, lined up again. They made
more cell phone calls. And they snapped photos of each other in front
of the bullet-riddled El Al counter. "We're taking pictures because
this is just part of our odyssey," said Luz Marina who, along with
husband Rodrigo Garcia, was in a group traveling to a Tokyo
conference.</TE>
<TE>   Rodrigo and Marina are no strangers to outbreaks of
violence--they're from Medellin, Colombia. "This doesn't scare us,"
said Rodrigo. "If this had happened in Colombia, this would have been
resolved in a matter of hours."</TE>
<TE>   But it took a day for the Los Angeles airport to recover and
return to a full schedule. Passenger volume was expected to be normal
for the day after the Fourth, with about 150,000 travelers passing
through, according to LAX spokesman Paul A. Haney. About 40,000 of
those were international passengers. There were 1,700 arriving and
departing flights scheduled Friday, 252 of them international.</TE>
<TE>   Bouquets were appearing near the counter for El Al, which even
before the attack had no flights scheduled for Friday or Saturday.
The airline does not fly on Friday from LAX because the jetliners
would not arrive in Tel Aviv before the start of the Jewish Sabbath,
which extends from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday, according to
an El Al employee.</TE>
<TE>   But the other signs of Thursday's shootings were disappearing by
early afternoon--visible bullet holes in the counter and the back
wall were covered over. The punctured El Al sign was removed. Just
the plexiglass covering the security notices printed on the counter
for passengers to read showed the jagged cracks of a bullet's path.</TE>
<TE>   An employee of another airline was overheard quizzing an airport
official about the El Al clerk who was killed. "Was it the really
pretty girl with the black hair?" asked the employee.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," the airport official answered soberly.</TE>
<TE>   Passengers coped with a day of chaos. Alfredo Grados had flown
from Sydney, Australia, to LAX to connect with a flight to Mexico.
After the turmoil of Thursday, he and his traveling companion, Angela
Bourne, got booked on an 8 o'clock flight that evening. But when he
left the terminal to get food, security refused to let him back in to
board his plane.</TE>
<TE>   "They were overpowering--yelling at old ladies," said Grados, 30.
"They made a bad situation into a worse one."</TE>
<TE>   Fliers checking in Thursday for flights on Singapore Airlines,
whose counter is nearly opposite El Al's, had front-row seats for the
harrowing events.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese free-lance photographer Hisato Takarada, 54, returning
home after a group tour of Las Vegas and Los Angeles, was snapping
pictures in the terminal Thursday when he heard shots behind him. He
dived to the floor, still wildly clicking his camera, not sure what
he was photographing, until a police officer told him to stop taking
pictures.</TE>
<TE>   "It looked like a TV show," Takarada said. On Friday, he was
scheduled to take another flight after spending the night in a hotel
room paid for by the tour company.</TE>
<TE>   The day after seemed to start off strangely quiet in the eyes of
some who work at the airport. "It feels like time is not moving;
there's no one here," said Joey Sanchez, an employee at the Sunglass
Hut in the international terminal.</TE>
<TE>   Alexandra Douglass, 17, of Greenwood, Ind., was part of a group of
exchange students scheduled to depart Thursday afternoon for Tokyo on
Singapore Airlines. She recalls seeing the shooter--he seemed
heavyset and was wearing a pastel shirt, as she remembers.</TE>
<TE>   "A woman went down and another man also," she said Friday morning
as she waited to depart for Japan. "When you see that kind of thing,
you don't think it's real."</TE>
<TE>   In the evacuation of the terminal, some of the students were
separated from one another. It took hours for them to all reconnect,
and they didn't leave the airport for a hotel until 10:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "The airport people were kind of mean and didn't do a very good
job of helping us," said exchange student Amanda Weber, 17, also from
Greenwood.</TE>
<TE>   A CNN staffer gave them phone numbers of hotels, she said. They
eventually found a hotel and were back Friday morning to complete
their trip to Japan. But some were still reeling from what they saw
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my first time in L.A.," said Weber, "and it doesn't leave
me with a very good first impression."</TE>

<LD>But for a lottery, the man who shot up LAX might not have been there.</LD>
<LD>   Six years ago, Hesham Mohamed Hadayet, 41, a moon-faced Egyptian
with a 5 o'clock shadow and a receding hairline, was facing
deportation for overstaying his visa. Then his wife got lucky.</LD>
<LD>   She was one of 55,000 immigrants who won a visa in an annual State
Department lottery for people from countries with low immigration
rates.</LD>
<TE>   It gave the couple permission to live and work permanently in the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   Not that they always got along. Only a year before the lottery,
Hadayet and his wife, Hala, accused each other of assault and
battery, an Irvine police spokesman said. Officers said they could
see no obvious injuries and neither of the Hadayets was arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Such were the details that materialized Friday in the murky life
of the 5-foot-8, 220-pound gunman who on his birthday, armed with
.45-caliber and 9-millimeter pistols and a 6-inch knife, attacked a
crowd at the El Al Israel Airlines ticket counter inside Tom Bradley
International Terminal.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI remained puzzled by his motive. Richard Garcia, the FBI's
special agent in charge in Los Angeles, said agents were looking into
all possibilities, including domestic problems or depression.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether or not it was related to a family issue or just
neighborly issues," Garcia told reporters, "we don't know."</TE>
<TE>   What Garcia was referring to began to emerge from police accounts,
official records and interviews with neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Social Security records indicate that Hadayet visited the United
States as early as 1981, but the FBI said he came back on a six-month
visa in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   After his wife won the visa lottery in 1997, the couple lived in
Irvine as resident aliens.</TE>
<TE>   In Cairo, where he was born, Hadayet's family appears to have been
well off. Relatives said he had been a good student and became an
accountant at a bank.</TE>
<TE>   But in Irvine, he drove a Yellow Cab and an airport shuttle for
five years.</TE>
<TE>   While he was a cabdriver, police say, he was robbed at knifepoint
of $190 by two men whom he picked up at John Wayne Airport in Santa
Ana.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, Hadayet started a limousine service, which he operated
out of the family home in the Woodbridge Pines apartment complex on
Willow Run.</TE>
<TE>   Records indicate Hadayet struggled to stay in business. When he
filed for a city business license, he listed only one employee,
apparently himself.</TE>
<TE>   He called his service Five Star Limo--not related to the similarly
named Five Star Limousine of Huntington Beach. State records show he
began with a six-passenger Lincoln. The next year, he added a
nine-passenger limousine.</TE>
<TE>   "We Make All Occasions Special," Hadayet's Internet advertisements
said. He offered rides to weddings, graduations, Disneyland and
Universal Studios.</TE>
<TE>   By last summer, however, Hadayet's luck appeared to have turned
sour. He notified the state that he had stopped operating one car,
then the other. State records show his required insurance coverage
was canceled. In November, after a series of warnings, the Public
Utilities Commission revoked his limousine permit.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the shooting, DMV records show, Hadayet was leasing
a 1999 Toyota Camry and a year-old Mercedes-Benz with a personalized
license plate: "GOALIS."</TE>
<TE>   Some neighbors said Hadayet was unfriendly.</TE>
<TE>   The family kept the blinds closed and kept to themselves, the
neighbors said, and Hadayet was particularly aloof. Several neighbors
said he rarely acknowledged them and would not look women in the eye.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Carstens, a sergeant in the Marine reserves, said Hadayet
was unfriendly from the start. "I said hello to him specifically when
we first moved in. He looked right at me and looked away, and he
never said anything. I don't know if it's because I had a 'high and
tight' [military haircut].</TE>
<TE>   "I just know it bothered me enough that I didn't care to go down
and talk to him."</TE>
<TE>   But Carstens and his wife, Sarah, said Hala was always cordial.
Sarah Carstens said she once mentioned to Hadayet's wife that she
smelled good cooking, and Hala replied: "If you smell anything good,
come on down and taste it."</TE>
<TE>   Before Sept. 11, Carstens said, Hadayet put a bumper sticker on
his front door that said: "Read the Koran." But Carstens said Hadayet
took it down shortly after the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The sticker was visible again over the mail slot Thursday, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Pamela Paulson, who lives two apartments away, said she saw
Hadayet getting into his Mercedes at 5:30 a.m. Thursday. She was
letting her poodle out, and the dog began barking.</TE>
<TE>   Hadayet was carrying a small, dark box to the car, Paulson said.
It was the last she saw of him.</TE>
<TE>   Paulson said she tried to talk to Hala Hadayet a few months ago,
but the husband abruptly called her to come back inside.</TE>
<TE>   She dutifully followed him back into their apartment, Paulson
said. "That was the relationship you saw between them--he was always
walking first, and she was very subservient."</TE>
<TE>   In May, the neighbor saw Hala picking up passports for her
children, Omar, 11, and Adam, 8.</TE>
<TE>   She said she was going back to visit her family, Paulson said. "It
was a heart operation for one of her parents."</TE>
<TE>   Carrie Haag, another neighbor, noticed Hadayet more than once
wearing a white robe and sandals. "They were very staunch Muslims,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Danilewicz, 17, liked to spend the night at the home of
his friend, Omar Hadayet. The apartment had religious verses framed
on the walls and the Koran on a living room table.</TE>
<TE>   Hala Hadayet cooked couscous, and it was delicious. But she could
have a sharp tongue, he said.</TE>
<TE>   She yelled a lot at both of her boys, Danilewicz said. Omar "liked
his dad, but not his mom. His dad gave him lots of money. His dad
never yelled at Omar."</TE>
<TE>   In Cairo, too, relatives said that Hadayet had a soft side.</TE>
<TE>   An uncle, Hassan Mostafa Mahfouz, said he did not belong to any
political group. He said Hadayet loved his family.</TE>
<TE>   Between noon and 1 p.m., Cairo time, on Thursday, Mahfouz said,
Hadayet telephoned his father, knowing that the father might want to
wish him a happy birthday.</TE>
<TE>   That would have been between 2 and 3 a.m. in Los Angeles--at least
seven hours before the shooting.</TE>

<HD>A Matter for Debate: Was This a Terrorist Attack?</HD>
<DH>Semantics: To the Israelis, it seems clear that it was. But
U.S. government officials--from the White House to the FBI--take a
more cautious approach.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOE MATHEWS and HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When is a crime a terrorist attack?</LD>
<LD>   The conflicting language that legal scholars, Jewish and Muslim
leaders and the federal government are using to describe Thursday's
airport shooting amounts to a post-9/11 updating of the late Supreme
Court Justice Potter Stewart's description of pornography: We know it
when we see it.</LD>
<LD>   The question of whether Hesham Mohamed Hadayet should be
considered a deranged criminal or a terrorist fed a growing debate
about whether America's conventional definition of terrorism should
be broadened.</LD>
<TE>   For those on both sides, the event brought home to Los Angeles the
semantic quagmire of the Middle Eastern conflict.</TE>
<TE>   On one side, government officials--from the White House and the
FBI to the mayor of Los Angeles--all took the role of cautious
jurists and insisted that they lacked the evidence to label as
terrorism Hadayet's armed assault on the ticket counter of El Al
Israel Airlines, the Israeli national airline.</TE>
<TE>   On the other side, the Israeli government--echoed by some legal
scholars, terrorism experts and Jewish leaders--was incredulous,
arguing that such caution defied common sense and reflected a
troubling lack of moral outrage.</TE>
<TE>   "For the Israelis to immediately see this as an act of terrorism
is understandable.... If you have a war mentality, then all acts are
seen as part of the war," said Brian Jenkins, senior advisor to the
president of Rand Corp., who has been working on terrorism for more
than 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   Americans, on the other hand, live in a society where almost all
victims of deadly violence die at the hands of an individual killer.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, for many Americans, the timing and the nature of the
LAX shootings offered plenty of indications to the contrary.</TE>
<TE>   What other conclusion, they asked, could be drawn from a Fourth of
July attack at an airport long identified as a possible terrorist
target, by an Egyptian-born man aiming at employees and customers of
Israeli's national airline?</TE>
<TE>   Rebutting the U.S. government's caution, these critics argued
that, in the post-Sept. 11 climate, any act of violence in a public
space could be sure to win notice on CNN--and thus be considered an
act of terror.</TE>
<TE>   "This guy must have known he was going to create a world event,"
said Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center.</TE>
<TE>   The use of the word terrorist is often believed to have begun
during the French Revolution, when Jacobins who overthrew the
monarchy called themselves terrorists. But the term, while widely
used, has long proved difficult to define.</TE>
<TE>   The first attempt by an international body to define terrorism was
made in 1937 when the League of Nations called it "criminal acts
directed against a state and intended or calculated to create a state
of terror in the minds of particular persons, or a group of persons
or the general public." By the outbreak of World War II, only India
had adopted the definition.</TE>
<TE>   United Nations resolutions often condemn terrorism, but never
define it. The U.S. government has seized on that ambiguity in the
name of strategic flexibility.</TE>
<TE>   American law defines terrorism differently, depending on whether
the context is immigration, surveillance of foreigners or domestic
prosecution. Both State and Justice Department guidelines on
terrorism begin with the caveat that "there is no single universally
accepted definition of terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, both sides in the debate over the nature of Thursday's
shooting pointed to strikingly similar definitions of terror. FBI
officials recited from the bureau's 1999 publication, "Terrorism in
the United States," which calls it "unlawful use of force and
violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a
government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof in
furtherance of political and social objectives."</TE>
<TE>   An Israeli government spokeswoman quoted from a recent speech by
that country's deputy prime minister, who called terrorism "killing
and making attempts on the lives of innocent citizens to achieve
political goals."</TE>
<TE>   According to the FBI's own guidelines, "this looks like a
terrorist attack," said Meirav Shahar, Israeli consul for
communications and public affairs in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Garcia, the FBI special agent in charge in Los Angeles,
said the bureau had not found any indication of "anti-Israel views or
any other type of racial views" that would match a classification of
terrorism. He also allowed for the possibility that Hadayet had been
"despondent for some reason in an abnormal reaction."</TE>
<TE>   To buttress its caution, the FBI seemed to ignore its own
definition of terrorism in favor of a more limited State Department
definition. That meaning holds that terrorism is perpetrated "by
sub-national groups or clandestine agents." FBI officials repeatedly
emphasized Friday that Hadayet had no known connection with Islamic
terrorist organizations.</TE>
<TE>   A law enforcement official versed in counterterrorism said Friday
that the LAX attack had all the markings of an isolated event rather
than a well-planned conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   Both the gunman's target and the manner in which he carried out
the shooting indicated he was motivated by rage and had no help from
others. Indeed, the official added, if the gunman's motive was to
strike at America or to instill fear among airport travelers, a much
more logical target would have been any U.S. air carrier's terminal.</TE>
<TE>   ''If this were Al Qaeda, they are going to go after an American
airline, where the security isn't as tight, because they don't like
America any more than they like Israel,'' the official said.</TE>
<TE>   But terrorism experts argued that such a definition is too
limiting. "Part of what terrorism has become," said Bruce Hoffman,
author of the 1998 book "Inside Terrorism," "is inspiring people to
take matters into their own hands and act on their rage."</TE>
<TE>   Others wondered about the utility of such a debate. Terrorism is
not, legally speaking, a federal crime with which a person can be
charged. Murder and conspiracy statutes are used to prosecute alleged
terrorists such as Zacarias Moussaoui, whom prosecutors believe was
supposed to be the 20th hijacker on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   This quagmire makes it hard to decide even whether to have a
formal definition of terrorism, said UCLA law professor Khaled Abou
el Fadl. "Is it helpful, given that terrorism is such a politically
charged word?"</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>From the San Fernando Valley to Israel, families of the two people
killed in the July 4 shootings at Los Angeles International Airport
prepared for their final farewells.</LD>
<LD>   Jacob Aminov, a 46-year-old father of eight, and Victoria Hen, a
25-year-old El Al Israel Airlines ticket agent, both were being
mourned in the ancient traditions of their Jewish faith.</LD>
<LD>   Hen's family planned to bury their only daughter Sunday at Eden
Memorial Park in Mission Hills. They will be sitting shiva, the
weeklong period of mourning, from their home on a leafy street in
suburban Chatsworth.</LD>
<TE>   Mourners clustered Friday to recall Hen's journey from childhood
in Israel to her job at LAX.</TE>
<TE>   Hen emigrated from Israel in 1990 with her parents and two younger
brothers. Her father, Avi, established an automotive parts business
and the family eventually settled into a ranch-style home in
Chatsworth. Hen, who lived at home with her parents, was the eldest
child, an only daughter who grounded her family of five.</TE>
<TE>   "Vicky was the center of this family," Joseph Knoller, a family
spokesman, told a news conference Friday at the family home. "The
parents are devastated. They can barely speak. They are in a position
of denial. They expect her to walk in the door, but we know that
won't happen."</TE>
<TE>   Hen attended Birmingham High School in Van Nuys. In her senior
year, she was a member of the Jewish Awareness club and Careers With
Children club, according to the 1995 yearbook.</TE>
<TE>   After graduation, she worked as the office manager for a
construction company and for a physician, said Knoller, who later
hired her at his private security firm in Woodland Hills.</TE>
<TE>   She later landed the counter job for a firm that contracted with
the Israeli airline.</TE>
<TE>   "She was very knowledgeable about security and had no fear working
at El Al," Knoller said, adding that one of her proudest moments had
been the escorting of her paternal grandparents onto their return
flight to Israel after a visit in May.</TE>
<TE>   Hen, who had worked with El Al for almost two months, was fatally
shot as she checked in passengers at the airline's ticket counter.</TE>
<TE>   Hen often spoke about her desire to get married and have a family.</TE>
<TE>   "She would go to work with a smile. Everyone would see Vicky with
a beautiful smile," Knoller said.</TE>
<TE>   Aminov's family, heeding his wishes to be buried in Israel, will
wait until Sunday to deliver his body to his homeland--aboard an El
Al plane.</TE>
<TE>   He will be sent off with a hesbed, or eulogy, at his North
Hollywood synagogue. Family members will speak briefly about his
generosity, his devotion to his family and his religious dedication.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the diamond importer, who owned a business in downtown
Los Angeles, will be buried near Tel Aviv in shrouds and a plain pine
coffin, according to Jewish tradition.</TE>
<TE>   Aminov was a man of modest means who lived a simple but profoundly
spiritual life, friends recalled.</TE>
<TE>   He did not decorate his home extravagantly--but he treasured items
that mattered most to him, such as holy books and pictures of
religious leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "He lived a very down-to-earth life," said friend Michael
Benvenitz, 35.</TE>
<TE>   Aminov, who donated his time freely, was shot to death near the El
Al counter while escorting a friend who was flying to Israel. He was
frequently a host to such visitors from Israel and held religious
lectures in his home.</TE>
<TE>   He helped found the Sephardic synagogue Yad Avraham--Hand of
Abraham--in a converted office space at a North Hollywood shopping
center.</TE>
<TE>   Aminov would sit quietly in the same corner of the synagogue every
day, proud of the religious home he had helped to build.</TE>
<TE>   "Words cannot explain what kind of a person he was, what kind of
heart he had," said Benvenitz, who could not remember that his friend
had ever missed a prayer service during the 10 years they had
belonged to the synagogue together.</TE>
<TE>   As word spread about Aminov's death, hundreds of friends went to
the Valley Village house Friday to visit with Aminov's family and
offer support. At the house, they ate, they hugged one another and
they cried, said Rabbi Aron Tendler, a longtime friend.</TE>
<TE>   Aminov had five children, 2 to 9 years old, with his wife Anat,
who is pregnant with their sixth child. He also had three children
from a previous marriage.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unbelievable," said Tendler, a friend who heads the Shaarei
Zedek congregation in North Hollywood. "We have had to chase people
away."</TE>
<TE>   Injured in the shooting were Haim Sapir, the El Al security chief
who shot and killed the alleged gunman, and Canadian Sarah Phillips,
61, who had come to Los Angeles to visit friends and was recovering
from a broken hip suffered last Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips on Friday was in Centinela Hospital, where she underwent
surgery to repair four damaged tendons in her right ankle. Doctors
said Phillips was expected to be released from the hospital in two or
three days.</TE>
<TE>   Sapir, who is in his early 40s, was treated at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center and released, according to officials at the Israeli
Consulate in Los Angeles, who declined to specify his whereabouts
Friday.</TE>

<HD>Deluge of Hate Crimes After 9/11 Pours Through System</HD>
<DH>Courts: Officials have three times the cases involving
Arab-looking victims as at this time a year ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>Mark Anthony Stroman was an easy case. A white supremacist, in the
days after Sept. 11 he walked into a succession of convenience stores
in the Dallas area and killed a clerk from Pakistan and another from
India, and he partially blinded a third from Bangladesh.</LD>
<LD>   Tried, convicted and sentenced to death, Stroman voices no
remorse. He recalls telling each of his victims, "God bless America."</LD>
<LD>   As the incidence of hate crimes against suspected Middle
Easterners subsides, authorities are beginning to prosecute cases
growing out of more than 420 investigations nationwide. Although some
offenders show no regret, many others are expressing embarrassment
over their hostile acts in the wake of the terrorist attacks on the
World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</LD>
<TE>   Joe Montez drew two years' probation for telephoning a truck stop
in Hewitt, Texas, on Sept. 17. After asking whether the clerks were
Iranians, he said, "There's a bomb where you're standing.... There's
a bomb in your building."</TE>
<TE>   Montez knows he should have controlled his Sept. 11 anger. "I made
a mistake," he said in an interview. "I'm trying to put all that
behind me."</TE>
<TE>   The threats and retaliations have come in many forms: a call left
on the voicemail of the president of the Arab American Institute in
Washington. An anthrax hoax letter that turned up at an Arab American
restaurant in Madison, Wis. Physical attacks, arson, hate messages on
the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Proving a hate crime can be especially difficult. Authorities must
show that a victim was purposely selected because of race or
religion.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, officials have opened three times as many
investigations into hate crimes with Arab victims since Sept. 11 as
in the same period the previous year. They include 350 federal cases
and 70 by state and local authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Even with offenders such as Stroman locked away, many advocacy
groups still feel the bias, even people from South Asia, such as
Indians and Pakistanis, who often are mistaken for Arabs.</TE>
<TE>   Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic
Relations in Washington, said his organization has heard almost
60,000 reports since Sept. 11 of some kind of harassment against
American Muslims. They range from violence to slurs to job
discrimination, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But non-Muslims also have come to the aid of victims, including
the owners of Curry in a Hurry, a Salt Lake City restaurant that was
set afire Sept. 13.</TE>
<TE>   The eatery was filled with customers, though none was injured.
Diners helped douse the blaze and later returned to paint and rebuild
the structure. Others sent cards, flowers and presents.</TE>
<TE>   "If the building had gone down, I'd have lost my business," Mona
Nisar said. "My whole family would be starving."</TE>
<TE>   A Pakistani, she was surprised to learn that she knew the
assailant, who sometimes ate there. "He was our friend. But he was
just too upset about what happened."</TE>
<TE>   James Herrick, 32, pleaded guilty to filling two jars with
gasoline and torching the restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   "My actions were in response to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001,
against the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon," he told the
judge.</TE>
<TE>   Making clear that the arson was indeed a hate crime, he said he
believed the Nisar family was "'of Middle Eastern heritage."</TE>
<TE>   Herrick sent an apology letter to the Nisar family, and in court
his fiancee hugged some of the family members.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 7, he was sentenced to 51 months. Prosecutors filed a
court memo that read: "We were compelled to respond quickly to deter
the perceived growing backlash against innocent members of our
community. These hate crimes are noxious to the principles of liberty
and freedom embodied in our Constitution."</TE>
<TE>   In Seattle, when a mosque was attacked, neighbors began security
patrols to prevent another assault.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 13, Patrick Cunningham, 54, tried to burn cars in the
mosque parking lot; when that failed, he shot at worshippers.</TE>
<TE>   He pleaded guilty May 9; he is scheduled to be sentenced in
August, with a possible sentence of five to seven years.</TE>
<TE>   "In his mind," the plea agreement said, "he did not distinguish
between the terrorists believed to be responsible for the attacks and
people of the Muslim faith."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Don Currie said Cunningham "believes he made a horrible
mistake." Defense attorney Olaf Hansen said his client had family in
New York, but no one hurt or killed Sept. 11: "Something just snapped
with him. It was a pretty crazy time then."</TE>
<TE>   Mosque director Hisham Farajallah said members have forgiven
Cunningham. "It's obvious he did this out of revenge, hatred and
anger," he said. "But to me it was out of ignorance."</TE>
<TE>   Then there is Stroman, 32. The father of four offers no apologies,
even from his death row cell, where he keeps photos of the burning
towers. He also has a jailhouse tattoo commemorating Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel terrible about the victims of 9/11," he said, beating his
fist to control his anger. "Every time I see another picture of
someone falling head first from the towers, I feel awful. And every
time I think about that young man who said, 'Let's roll,' I think,
he's my hero."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities in Dallas said Stroman was affiliated with white
supremacist and neo-Nazi groups, was a repeat petty offender and kept
a large cache of semiautomatic firearms.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Greg Davis said Sept. 11 was simply the perfect trigger
for Stroman. "Nine-eleven gave him a natural excuse," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 15, he killed a store clerk from Pakistan with a single
shot to the head. On Sept. 21, he blinded a clerk from Bangladesh in
the right eye. On Oct. 4, he killed a clerk from India who had become
a U.S. citizen 12 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   His trial lasted less than a week; the jury deliberated less than
an hour. He arrived on death row April 5.</TE>
<TE>   "When they stick a needle in my arm, it won't even matter; that's
just going to sleep," Stroman said of his execution.</TE>
<TE>   "But those people who fell from the towers, they suffered. Those
people who died in the Pentagon, they suffered. Those people who
tried to take back that plane over Pennsylvania, they suffered."</TE>
<TE>   On the day of his arrest, Stroman was planning a visit to a local
mosque, he said. "I was going to go in shooting Arabs."</TE>

his testimony at Lindh's trial.</LD>
<LD>   The request was filed by attorneys for Robert Pelton, who

up to seven years in prison if convicted of reckless endangerment and
violating air traffic rules.</LD>

<LD>   Gov. Don Sundquist had furloughed more than half the state's

budget by the July 1 deadline. The General Assembly broke the budget
impasse Wednesday with a compromise that raised the state sales tax
from 6% to 7% on everything except groceries.</LD>

<HD>Hundreds Attend Funeral for Rosemary Clooney</HD>
<DH>Mass: Farewells are said for the singer and actress at a
packed church in her hometown in Kentucky.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MAYSVILLE, Ky.</DL>
<LD>Rosemary Clooney made a final journey to her hometown Friday for a
funeral attended by family, friends and hundreds of fans.</LD>
<LD>   The mellow-voiced singer and actress, who co-starred with Bing
Crosby in "White Christmas" and staged a dramatic comeback after
drugs and alcohol nearly destroyed her career, died June 29 at 74
after a long battle with lung cancer.</LD>
<LD>   More than 700 people packed into St. Patrick's Church downtown,
where Clooney was baptized, to say farewell to the city's sweetheart
who never forgot her roots. Many waited for hours for a seat, and by
9 a.m.--an hour before the service--the line snaked outside for more
than a block.</LD>
<TE>   "Everything she did, you felt like you were a part of it," said
Debbie Roberts of Maysville, who got the first spot in line about 6
a.m.</TE>
<TE>   "When you knew she was in town, it was exciting to walk into
places and do that quick eyeball around to see if she was there.
There was always that little bit of anticipation in your stomach no
matter how many times you'd seen her."</TE>
<TE>   Father William Hinds described Clooney as "disarmingly comical and
frank."</TE>
<TE>   "She was 'the girl singer,' beloved by the people," Hinds said.
"We've lost a star, a light that shone brightly into all of our
lives."</TE>
<TE>   Her brother, veteran television newscaster Nick Clooney, gave a
eulogy at the end of the hourlong Roman Catholic funeral Mass.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me do something I never would have presumed to do a week
ago--speak for Rosemary ... dangerous," he said. "She would like to
thank all of you for making her life richer."</TE>
<TE>   Actor George Clooney, Nick's son, sat with more than three dozen
family members and was one of 10 pallbearers.</TE>
<TE>   Also in the crowd were singer Debbie Boone, Clooney's
daughter-in-law; actors Al Pacino and Beverly D'Angelo; and Maysville
native and former Miss America Heather French Henry, the wife of
Kentucky Lt. Gov. Steve Henry.</TE>
<TE>   After the service, Clooney was buried at St. Patrick's Cemetery
near her mother and grandmother.</TE>
<TE>   Mourners said they often saw Clooney shopping for groceries or
strolling the streets whenever she returned to the river town of
8,900 near the Kentucky-Ohio border.</TE>
<TE>   She frequented Delite's, a restaurant known for its Coney Island
hot dogs, and was a regular at Magee's Bakery and a downtown jewelry
store.</TE>

<HD>Project Seeks Accurate D-Day Tally</HD>
<DH>Memorial: It's the first bid at tracking 130,000 Allied
troops who took part June 6, 1944.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BEDFORD, Va.</DL>
<LD>The National D-Day Memorial Foundation is working on an accounting of
U.S. and Allied forces who died in the June 6, 1944, Normandy
invasion that broke Adolf Hitler's grasp on Europe.</LD>
<LD>   "There really is no accurate list of everyone who was killed,"
foundation President William McIntosh said. "The estimates people
have cited spike as high as 12,000 and go as low as 5,500. When you
have that kind of disparity, you know that more work needs to be
done."</LD>
<LD>   The foundation plans to display the names on bronze plaques at the
tribute next Memorial Day. They won't be named alphabetically,
because the list would take much longer to compile.</LD>
<TE>   Foundation researcher Carol Tuckwiller said her work has confirmed
about 3,700 fatalities and expects the number to reach 4,500. Using
national archives and various military databases, she also is working
through 1,000 names of military personnel listed as missing in action
after D-day.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of these are later turning up back on duty, or they showed
up in hospitals in England, or later reports say they died of wounds
in other battles," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to track the more than 130,000 Allied troops who spread
across 50 miles of French coastline is as difficult today as it was
the day of the invasion, Tuckwiller said.</TE>
<TE>   "There was so much confusion that day," she said. "The field
reports kept changing. Months later, they were still determining the
people that died there."</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell Yockelson, a reference archivist at the National Archives
Modern Military Records Branch in College Park, Md., marvels at the
amount of work Tuckwiller has done.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an enormous task," Yockelson said. "There's not one
consolidated source of records. You're dealing with different
agencies of the War Department, and everybody records things
differently."</TE>
<TE>   Daily reports, stored in the National Personnel Records Center in
St. Louis, were filled out by commanders and keep track of
casualties.</TE>
<TE>   The microfilmed records are sorted by date, so Tuckwiller had to
sift through troop movements in Guam, domestic training reports and
everything else the U.S. military was doing that day.</TE>
<TE>   Unit reports and histories are filed after the war and usually
don't provide the dates of those killed in action.</TE>
<TE>   Besides counting names, Tuckwiller has gleaned insight into the
invasion from the dusty paper documents.</TE>
<TE>   "In some reports, the commanders said morale was low because the
men didn't receive the mail that day," she said. "They were always
trying to get families to write every day, and now you see why."</TE>

<HD>Democrats Move to Profit From Red Ink</HD>
<DH>Politics: The party, in search of an issue for
congressional elections, seeks to link Republican candidates to
corporate misdeeds. But the strategy could backfire.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>To hear national Democratic leaders tell it just a few weeks ago,
this year's congressional elections were mainly about preserving
Social Security, expanding Medicare and ending GOP mismanagement of
the federal budget. But now, with the latest cascade of business
scandals, they are humming a different tune.</LD>
<LD>   At the urging of party leaders, Democrats around the country spent
this week's congressional recess back home trying to cast the
election as a choice between friends and foes of corporate corruption
and greed.</LD>
<LD>   In Mississippi, a House Democrat lambasted his GOP opponent for
refusing to return donations from WorldCom Inc., whose accounting
shenanigans reignited the issue of corporate wrongdoing.</LD>
<TE>   In other cases, Democrats focused on broader questions of
corporate accountability.</TE>
<TE>   In New Hampshire, a Democrat attacked the House Republican
incumbent for opposing legislation that might have prevented a local
company from evading U.S. taxes.</TE>
<TE>   In South Dakota, a Democratic senator departed from his previous
emphasis on local issues to unveil a wide-ranging proposal to crack
down on irresponsible corporate executives.</TE>
<TE>   And Democratic officials have recommended that party candidates
everywhere spotlight the voting records of Republicans on corporate
reform measures.</TE>
<TE>   After months of groping without success for a campaign theme of
national resonance, the Democratic leaders clearly are hoping that
the snowballing revelations about corporate scandals will finally
tilt the campaign playing field in their direction.</TE>
<TE>   "The Enrons and WorldComs have contributed significantly to an
important shift in the national political environment, not just by
putting voters in a more populist mood generally but also by helping
to tie together issues like retirement security, jobs and a shaky
economy in a way that benefits Democrats," said Jim Jordan, the
executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans are skeptical, saying this is just the latest in a
series of efforts by Democrats to find a "silver bullet" issue that
would nationalize the 2002 campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "First it was energy, then the economy, then airport security and
Social Security," said Carl Forti, spokesman for the National
Republican Congressional Committee, in a memo to Republican
candidates. "Having failed to gain political mileage on these issues,
Democrats have now staked their hopes for winning this November on
corporate accountability."</TE>
<TE>   Independent analysts say the Democrats may have some trouble
gaining traction on the issue unless it is coupled with serious
instability in the economy.</TE>
<TE>   That's in part because Democrats themselves have accepted
corporate donations and been swept up in scandals involving companies
such as Global Crossing Ltd., the troubled telecommunication firm.</TE>
<TE>   "Most voters still see all politicians in the same light: They are
all raising special interest money, all friends with the big fat
cats," said Amy Walter, an analyst for the nonpartisan Cook Political
Report.</TE>
<TE>   But Democrats remain confident they can score political gains by
depicting Republicans as reluctant to respond to corporate
abuses--and link that message to the stereotype of the GOP as the
party of big business.</TE>
<TE>   "If being for big corporations is not the first thing people think
about the Republican Party, it is at least the second thing," said
Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. "It is part of the Republican
brand identity."</TE>
<TE>   And despite their public bravado, Republicans are reacting
defensively.</TE>
<TE>   Forti's memo was a "Candidate Alert" sent just before the Fourth
of July recess to arm Republicans with arguments about what
legislation the House passed to strengthen pensions and corporate
accounting. "The GOP takes a back seat to no one on this issue," the
memo said with emphasis.</TE>
<TE>   Some moderate Democrats are concerned that a stridently populist
campaign will undercut the party's Clinton-era efforts to shed their
image as being reflexively anti-business and hostile to policies that
promote economic growth.</TE>
<TE>   "Democrats are going to have to be very careful to make sure we
don't look like what we're trying to do is only beat up on
corporations," said Simon Rosenberg, president of the New Democratic
Network. "If at any point we're seen as being anti-growth and
anti-business, it will diminish our effectiveness."</TE>
<TE>   But for many Democrats, that's a concern to worry about later. The
issue of corporate malfeasance is hot, for example, in the
Mississippi district of Democratic Rep. Ronnie Shows, which is home
to WorldCom's headquarters. He faces a tough race because
redistricting forced him to run against another House member, GOP
Rep. Charles W. "Chip" Pickering, and Shows has been quick to try to
use the WorldCom scandal to his advantage.</TE>
<TE>   He immediately called for an investigation after it was disclosed
recently that WorldCom had overstated its earnings by nearly $4
billion. He announced he would return the $6,000 in campaign
contributions he had received from WorldCom to set up a fund for
employees who lose their jobs. He denounced Pickering--who was the
top recipient of WorldCom donations, according to the nonpartisan
Center for Responsive Politics in Washington--for failing to do the
same.</TE>
<TE>   Henry Barbour, Pickering's campaign spokesman, said he sees no
need to return the donations because there was nothing illegal about
the money. He said Shows was "grasping at straws" in raising the
issue, trying to win a race in a district that is too conservative
for a Democrat to easily win.</TE>
<TE>   "He has to come up with some created issue to have a prayer,"
Barbour said.</TE>
<TE>   Corporate responsibility also has become a key issue in other
places where companies have tried to take advantage of a loophole in
U.S. law that allows them to evade taxes by changing their legal
address to foreign tax havens.</TE>
<TE>   Such is the case in the Connecticut House district that is home to
Stanley Works, a big tool company that is trying to reincorporate in
Bermuda.</TE>
<TE>   The district also is the scene of another contest between two
incumbents thrown together by redrawn boundary lines--Reps. James H.
Maloney, a Democrat, and Nancy L. Johnson, a Republican. Maloney has
sponsored legislation to cut off the tax break for such corporate
"inversions." Johnson wants to impose a moratorium on the loophole,
but Maloney says that does not go far enough.</TE>
<TE>   The issue also has come up in New Hampshire, the home to Tyco
International, which employed the loophole to shift its legal address
to Bermuda in 1997. Democratic House candidate Katrina Swett has
criticized GOP Rep. Charles F. Bass for opposing the bill to close
that loophole.</TE>
<TE>   Bass' spokeswoman said he opposed the Democratic bill because he
supported an alternative that would make the U.S. tax law less
onerous, and thus less likely to seek offshore tax shelters.</TE>
<TE>   In South Dakota, no community has been hit directly by the
corporate scandals.</TE>
<TE>   But the two candidates locked in a closely watched Senate race
there are sensitive to the economic anxiety sparked by business
misdeeds.</TE>
<TE>   Both Sen. Tim Johnson, the Democrat seeking reelection, and his
GOP opponent, Rep. John R. Thune, announced that they would give back
donations they received from WorldCom. And Johnson, who has built his
campaign largely around his ability to deliver federal funds for
local projects, on Friday offered his own proposals to protect
workers and investors from accounting fraud and other anti-abuse
measures.</TE>
<TE>   One House candidate who has already used anti-corporate themes in
his television ads is Jim Humphreys in West Virginia, who is trying
to unseat GOP Rep. Shelley Moore Capito. "He'll take on big
corporations like Enron and protect workers' pensions," Humphreys' TV
ad says. "The big money interests can't buy him and they can't boss
him around."</TE>

<HD>In Texas, a Year of L.A. Rain in an Hour</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas</DL>
<LD>Frantic families steeled their nerves, grabbed what they could carry
and fled their homes Friday, as some of the worst flooding this
countryside has seen in years pushed rivers out of their banks,
swallowed neighborhoods and overpowered dams.</LD>
<LD>   The rain has been pouring down for a week and was expected to
continue through the weekend. Thousands have been forced to scramble
for higher ground, seven people have drowned and there were reports
of more disappearances. The storms have wreaked millions of dollars
in damage.</LD>
<LD>   In the sleepy Texas Hill Country, where vast stretches of
limestone canyons, oak glades and pastures were washed out, towns
turned into islands and ranches sank from view beneath the renegade
rivers.</LD>
<TE>   And things could get worse: The water was expected to swell deeper
over the weekend. Even when the sun came out, it was a brief flash in
a dark, ominous sky. The rain slackened Wednesday, only to come back
fierce Thursday. In some stretches, rain was expected to fall at the
alarming clip of 4 inches an hour in the coming days--a pace matching
total rainfall for Los Angeles the last year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's mind-boggling; it's like a nightmare," Comal County
emergency management coordinator Carol Edgett said. "There's going to
be higher water, more water, and it's going to spread."</TE>
<TE>   From the dripping shadow of a spreading oak, Mary Causey peered
down the hill to the roof of her house, which poked improbably from
dank expanses of water that covered her neighborhood. "I don't have
the resilience for this," said Causey, 54.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second time Causey watched the temperamental Texas
waters snatch away one of her homes--she and her husband lost their
retirement house in a flood a few years ago. Friday afternoon, her
grandchildren grew bored at her feet, skipped in circles and twisted
crowns out of grass. Everybody was hungry. The police hollered down
from above, ordering the neighborhood to evacuate. Nobody paid
attention.</TE>
<TE>   Causey stood and watched because it didn't seem proper, somehow,
to leave. Not until the river carried the house away once and for
all. But as the day dragged on, as the air thickened and water snakes
swam languidly about, Causey grew impatient.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish it would just go ahead and float away," she said. "Give us
some closure so we can just go."</TE>
<TE>   Most years, a long summer weekend in the lush hills between Austin
and San Antonio is a sun-burnished, slow-paced affair, garnished with
cold beer, barbecues and indolent tubing trips down the Guadalupe
River.</TE>
<TE>   Lazy as an August day and clear as light, the Guadalupe is many a
Texan's pet river. "It's just gorgeous. It really is," Causey said.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel like we have a piece of paradise right here, with these
tranquil rivers," said Carol Deason, smiling sadly. "When they stay
in their banks."</TE>
<TE>   At her feet, the silty water lapped at the sidewalks and cottages
of her riverside neighborhood. The idyllic landscape has given way to
a soggy, smelly expanse. It was pouring in Comfort, in Kendall
County. There were drownings in Utopia, in Uvalde County. Furious
floods have trapped and killed a hiker, a kayaker and a tractor
driver. A couple turned up dead in their car. A pickup skidded and
crashed into a trailer, killing the driver.</TE>
<TE>   All along the Guadalupe, residents came to gawk at their river,
swollen and milky, churning its way beneath the cypress trees.
Children and old-timers leaned off the plank bridge and stared
solemnly at the water. The current ran so fast it made them dizzy to
watch. Tires, chunks of cars and a sofa floated past. Entire houses
washed below, falling slowly apart.</TE>
<TE>   Amy Bibler came sloshing from her flooded house, arms loaded with
mud-caked candle holders and picture frames, and made her way to her
pickup. "My wrought iron. I want it," she said, her chin trembling.
"I know it's stupid."</TE>
<TE>   Bibler just moved into her house this week; she came up from the
border to work as a school principal a few towns over. She was
thrilled at the notion of living alongside the Guadalupe. But water
pushed its way inside Friday, and a pair of water snakes slithered
into her living room.</TE>
<TE>   "I was looking forward to living in this beautiful house," Bibler
said. But there wasn't much time to cry. "What do you think? Do I
just leave my Mexican pots?"</TE>
<TE>   And the rain kept falling.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be wet where I'm standing before the night is
over," New Braunfels City Manager Charles Pinto said, pacing uphill
from the raging river.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't just the Guadalupe. The Medina River overflowed its
sandy banks overnight, pushing thousands from their homes. "We hope
it crests out pretty soon," Bandera County Judge Richard Evans said.
"We're losing houses every foot it rises."</TE>
<TE>   Northwest of San Antonio, the Canyon Lake dam overflowed, sending
torrents of water pulsing downstream. A fattened Chimney Creek was
threatening to push through yet another dam.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not out of the woods yet," Medina County Sheriff Gilbert
Rodriguez said. "We thought we were, but not anymore."</TE>

<HD>Judges Reject Motion to Delay, Set Giuliani's Divorce Trial
for Next Week</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A panel of judges has rejected a bid to delay the divorce trial of
former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Donna Hanover, clearing the way
for court proceedings to begin next week.</LD>
<LD>   In a ruling Friday, the five-judge panel denied a delay sought by
Hanover last month. The trial is scheduled for Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "We're happy we were successful," said Raoul Felder, Giuliani's
attorney. "Hopefully we'll settle."</LD>
<TE>   Hanover's attorney did not immediately return a call.</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani and his wife of nearly two decades have been at odds for
years. They separated in May 2000 when the ex-mayor went public about
girlfriend Judith Nathan.</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani, 58, filed for divorce on Oct. 20, 2000, alleging
Hanover, a television personality and actress, was "cruel and
inhuman" toward him. Hanover, 52, rejected that claim, instead
blaming the ex-mayor's affair with Nathan.</TE>

<HD>Some Businesses Balk at Giving Secrets for U.S. Terrorism
Fight</HD>
<DH>Security: Utilities and high-tech firms are reluctant to
turn over information about their operations for fear that it could
be compromised.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Prominent business groups, usually allied with the Bush
administration, are showing unexpected resistance to government
efforts to gauge the nation's vulnerability to terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   While the White House says private-public cooperation has
blossomed since the Sept. 11 attacks, representatives of banking,
information technology, utilities and other industries in recent
months have declined to share crucial details of how their systems
work and where they might be compromised. They say that sensitive
data shared with Washington could quickly become public, undercutting
corporate trade secrets, scaring off customers or providing would-be
terrorists with valuable clues about targets.</LD>
<LD>   The motives for withholding data vary from sector to sector and
business to business. Without exception, industry leaders say they
want to help the government. But Shannon L. Kellogg, a vice president
for security at the Information Technology Assn. of America trade
group, said, ''The bottom line is, the information is not flowing.''</LD>
<TE>   In response, the Bush administration has proposed exempting from
the federal public disclosure law much of the information it wants
private industry to voluntarily supply to the new Department of
Homeland Security. Critics attack this proposal as an unwarranted
break for big business. And they charge that, because some of its
records would not be subject to public review, the department would
be effectively ''above the law.''</TE>
<TE>   But advocates say the government can't fend off terrorists without
winning cooperation from private industry. ''The best scenario is for
the government and all the [business] players to be connected with
full information but for the terrorists to still be in the dark,''
said Sen. Robert F. Bennett (R-Utah).</TE>
<TE>   The dispute shows anew how the challenge of securing America from
terrorist attack in a post-Sept. 11 world raises fundamental
questions about how much information can and should be shared with
the government.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is how the government can help protect what has come to
be known as ''critical infrastructure'': telecommunication networks,
information systems, financial service links, utility grids, power
plants, chemical depots, transportation hubs and so on.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those assets are in private hands.</TE>
<TE>   And the government, with some exceptions, cannot compel the owners
to disclose systemic weaknesses or even to report threats and
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett recounts one incident to prove the point. After Sept. 11,
he said, a financial institution called him for advice on how to
handle a serious terrorist threat it had received against its
internal systems. But the company's officers did not want to relay
the threat to government agencies for fear that it would become
public and spark employee or customer panic.</TE>
<TE>   The threat turned out to be a hoax, but Bennett called it ''a
classic example of something that the Homeland Security Department
would want to know.''</TE>
<TE>   In April, an FBI survey of businesses and other institutions found
that 90% of respondents had experienced significant computer security
breaches within a one-year period, most of them causing financial
loss, but that only 34% had reported the incidents to law
enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   At a hearing in May before the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee, Ronald L. Dick, director of the FBI's National
Infrastructure Protection Center, explained why.</TE>
<TE>   ''The two primary reasons for not making a report were negative
publicity and the recognition that competitors would use the
information against them,'' Dick said.</TE>
<TE>   The Office of Homeland Security, a White House unit formed after
Sept. 11, also has found resistance.</TE>
<TE>   Laurence W. Brown, legal affairs director for the Edison Electric
Institute, which represents investor-owned utilities, said he
attended a conference in April in which homeland security officials
asked industry representatives for security information.</TE>
<TE>   Brown said the officials were told: ''We'd love to tell you where
our critical facilities are, but we're not going to because you can't
keep a secret.''</TE>
<TE>   Tom Ridge, the White House homeland security director,
acknowledged in testimony before Congress last week that getting
information from private industry is ''a problem that's been
experienced by a lot of the Cabinet secretaries and even during the
work of the Office of Homeland Security.''</TE>
<TE>   But solving that problem is especially tricky for a Republican
administration that aims simultaneously to expand government's
anti-terrorism powers and curb government's regulation of private
enterprise.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than passing new laws or issuing executive orders requiring
business to hand over critical information, the White House has
concluded that a voluntary approach will work best.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, Ridge argues that businesses should be granted the
exemption to the government's Freedom of Information Act, a goal
supported by a loose coalition of industries and prominent companies.
Microsoft Corp., for instance, purchased a newspaper advertisement
last month calling for an FOIA exemption for sensitive security
information.</TE>
<TE>   Enacted in 1966, the FOIA enables interest groups, journalists and
others to petition the government for access to its records. While
the act is meant to promote open and accountable government, many
types of records already are exempt from disclosure.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the act allows federal agencies to shield from public
view records related to national defense, foreign policy, law
enforcement, trade secrets and certain kinds of commercial or
financial information, among other categories.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration's proposed homeland security exemption
would go further, exempting from disclosure information voluntarily
provided to the new agency in connection with ''infrastructure
vulnerabilities or other vulnerabilities to terrorism.''</TE>
<TE>   Some critics, including the American Civil Liberties Union,
contend no changes to the law are needed to protect the sort of
records industry leaders claim would be vulnerable to public
disclosure. Others say the proposal is too broad.</TE>
<TE>   What, they ask, is ''infrastructure''? What are
''vulnerabilities''?</TE>
<TE>   Rena Steinzor, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, an environmental group, said the proposed exemption could
shield from public view an application to expand a power plant. Or
data from a chemical plant on real or potential toxic leaks. Or any
other information a business considers embarrassing or a liability.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Tapscott, a scholar at the conservative Heritage Foundation
think tank who served in the Reagan administration, called the
proposed exemption ''overly broad.'' Congress appears split, which
could slow legislation the administration wants passed this year to
create the Cabinet-level Department of Homeland Security.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, chastised Ridge last month, saying that the FOIA exemption
and other provisions of the administration's homeland security bill
seek to place the new agency ''above the law.'' He called that ''very
troubling.''</TE>
<TE>   But Rep. W.J. ''Billy'' Tauzin (R-La.), chairman of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee, applauded the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   ''We ought to cut a delicate balance here, because we are a free
society and we want people to know what our government is doing,''
Tauzin said. ''But there's a line we have to draw when it comes to
providing free to anybody who wants it a road map of how to get into
a nuclear plant.... "</TE>

<DH>The pain of a sheriff's slaying is compounded by the
charges against three men in a case that uncovers a darker side of a
rural county.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SLATER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>STAB, Ky.</DL>
<LD>On humid evenings here, a thin layer of mist often creeps out at knee
level through the pine forests, the oak groves, the clandestine
marijuana fields. From the front door of the Shopville-Stab Volunteer
Fire Department, it's not difficult to imagine the sniper hiding in
the shrouded tree line that damp night.</LD>
<LD>   It's not hard to picture Pulaski County Sheriff Sam Catron, a
homemade cake in each hand, his 86-year-old mother and 350 other
people mingling just yards behind him at the department's annual fish
fry.</LD>
<LD>   He was smiling as he ambled to his cruiser, placed one cake on its
roof and dug for his keys.</LD>
<TE>   What's difficult is understanding just why the gunman, who was
hunkered down 100 yards away, pulled the trigger that sent a .25-06
slug through the sheriff's face.</TE>
<TE>   Folks here still have a hard time comprehending that Danny
Shelley, a former prom king and "a good boy from a good family," as
one acquaintance put it, could be arrested in the April 13
assassination.</TE>
<TE>   They were equally stunned when they learned who his alleged
co-conspirators were.</TE>
<TE>   One was running against Catron to become sheriff.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Morris was right there in the crowd when his rival fell
backward with his cake.</TE>
<TE>   The other was Morris' campaign manager. Kenneth White was supposed
to have been there too, authorities contend, but got cold feet and
stayed home instead.</TE>
<TE>   Shelley and Morris initially confessed, according to testimony by
an investigator at a preliminary hearing. White said he knew nothing
of the plot.</TE>
<TE>   In court, all three suspects in the killing of Sam Catron pleaded
not guilty and are being held without bond in the Pulaski County
Jail. No trial dates have been set, but prosecutors have filed papers
saying they intend to seek the death penalty for the three.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after their arrests, investigators came to believe each man
had a clear and simple motive. But the case is far more complex than
it first appeared. The three allegedly were driven by disparate and
complicated forces in hatching the plan.</TE>
<TE>   The killing of Catron seems to be one of the most wasteful crimes
anyone in southern Kentucky can remember.</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff was 48 when he died instantly at 7:15 p.m. Shelley was
arrested about 20 minutes later. Less than 36 hours after that,
Morris, a former deputy sheriff under Catron, and White, who has a
history of legal troubles, were taken into custody.</TE>
<TE>   "All that for what?" said volunteer firefighter Karen Riley, 55,
who rushed that night to the sheriff and instinctively tried to stop
bleeding that couldn't be stopped. With darkness coming on fast one
recent evening, Riley spoke from the spot where Catron fell, a patch
on the roadside now stained white by bleach. "We won't be having any
more fish fries here."</TE>
<TE>   If you believe the confessions police say Morris and Shelley
gave--and the lead investigator believes much of what they said--the
plot to kill Catron was hatched one day before it was carried out.</TE>
<TE>   White was at the wheel as the suspects drove around in his silver
Jeep Cherokee, putting up lawn signs. Well known to local
drug-enforcement folks, the 54-year-old had no job and received about
$400 a month in disability payments because of heart problems and a
crippled hand that earned him the nickname "Fingers." Yet he had come
to serve not only as campaign manager but also as Morris' primary
financial backer.</TE>
<TE>   Those in law enforcement who follow the local drug trade believe
they know how White earned at least some of the money he funneled
into the campaign: as a drug dealer. His attorney, David Hoskins,
denies that allegation, saying White earned the money selling various
things at the flea market in nearby Somerset.</TE>
<TE>   In the passenger seat was 34-year-old Morris. He was a deputy
sheriff for five years until last summer, when he resigned and began
working at his father-in-law's plumbing business.</TE>
<TE>   In the back was Shelley, 30, a standout high school athlete until
he injured his knee. He joined the Marines shortly after graduation
but was discharged early from boot camp because of the knee and more
recently had held a series of odd jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "They were just riding around, campaigning, and the subject just
came up," said Kentucky State Police Det. Todd Dalton, who is heading
the investigation. "They know that Sam's the front-runner. And in
their minds, they think they're No. 2. They figure they could shoot
him and walk in" to office.</TE>
<TE>   This was perhaps the first in a series of bizarre miscalculations
the three allegedly made in the hours leading up to the shooting, and
one that almost anyone around here could have cleared up for them.</TE>
<TE>   In a five-man race, Morris was probably running fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Even though he had served as a Pulaski County sheriff's deputy, is
married to a woman from here--with whom he has two children--and has
lived in the area for more than a decade, he's not from these parts.
His family is from a nearby county.</TE>
<TE>   In southern Kentucky, where families hold Civil War grudges and
name their boys Daniel after both the Old Testament prophet and
Daniel Boone, that means Morris is an outsider.</TE>
<TE>   Even more important, he faced almost unbeatable competitors in the
Republican primary. One candidate was a man who had tied Catron in
the last election, losing only in a coin toss, which is how such
things are settled here. Another, Todd Wood, who with the support of
Catron's family would go on to win the Republican nomination in May,
was a well-known policeman from Somerset. The other contender was
also better known here than Morris.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Morris and his alleged co-conspirators would have had to
eliminate not just Catron but at least two of the other three
candidates, most folks agree, for him to have been elected.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, by the afternoon of Friday, April 12, authorities say,
the plan had taken root. They would kill Catron, a lifelong bachelor
and arguably the most recognized figure in the county.</TE>
<TE>   They would assassinate him in Stab, a community of a couple
hundred people whose post office is long gone but who retain the old
name, even though their mail is stamped "Shopville," another tiny
community a few miles up the road. They would do it, as Riley put it,
"in front of God and everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Shelley, according to the alleged plan, would be the shooter. He
was an avid hunter and fine shot. He owned several rifles.</TE>
<TE>   Morris would lend him a 1985 Yamaha Virago motorcycle for his
getaway. Morris and White would perform simpler jobs, prosecutors
allege. They were to show up at the fish fry like good citizens,
listen to the bluegrass band and not appear nervous.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say the plan was devised and acted upon in a day, but
the forces that allegedly drove the trio began long before.</TE>
<TE>   Morris, who neighbors say liked to play with his young children in
the frontyard, didn't resign from the sheriff's department because he
wanted to become a plumber, law enforcement officials said. He
resigned because he was in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   In July 2001, Morris "took some time off that he shouldn't have
taken off," said acting Sheriff Jim McWhorter. When confronted by
Catron and McWhorter, who was then a ranking deputy, Morris was told
he faced a written reprimand and two or three days without pay,
McWhorter said. Brash and somewhat temperamental, people who know him
say, Morris quit instead.</TE>
<TE>   Late last year, he filed his papers with the county clerk to run
for sheriff. Shelley was his witness. It's not clear how or when the
two met.</TE>
<TE>   White signed on to the campaign, authorities allege, because he
needed the kind of protection only the highest-ranking lawman in the
county could provide.</TE>
<TE>   "He was going to have the sheriff in his pocket," said
Commonwealth Atty. Eddy Montgomery, the head prosecutor. "And he
needed him there."</TE>
<TE>   White's run-ins with the law stretch back to the 1970s, when he
was convicted of armed robbery. In the late 1990s, he was convicted
and imprisoned after police discovered a large marijuana patch that
began 3 feet from his back door, according to court records. That
conviction was overturned when he argued on appeal that prosecutors
had not proved the marijuana was his.</TE>
<TE>   But White continued to be active in the drug trade, according to
court records and authorities. Last year he was in serious trouble
again.</TE>
<TE>   "We had developed a [drug and stolen property] case against him
and actually charged him," McWhorter said. "He turned into a
confidential informant. His information resulted in the arrest of two
other subjects. That's how he got his charges dismissed."</TE>
<TE>   White, who is married and has an adult daughter, had another,
simpler reason for helping Morris, at least with his campaign,
authorities said. He credited Morris with saving his brother's life.
Several years ago, White's brother had a heart attack. Morris, who
lived nearby, discovered him, called 911 and treated him until
paramedics arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's Shelley.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never had a client get the number of cards and letters that
Danny has gotten," said Katie Wood, one of his attorneys. "Usually
the people we represent are not even people others would claim to
know. But people think the world of Danny."</TE>
<TE>   A stocky, handsome former farm boy, Shelley's reward for shooting
the sheriff, prosecutors contend, was to be a job with status. He
would be made a deputy sheriff by Morris.</TE>
<TE>   Shelley, though, had other problems beyond the lack of a solid
job, problems very few knew about. He was under investigation, Wood
acknowledged, by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration for
allegedly trafficking in the prescription painkiller OxyContin. No
charges have been filed.</TE>
<TE>   On the morning of April 13, a Saturday, White and Shelley met for
breakfast at the Bob Evans restaurant on U.S. 27 in Somerset, police
said. After they ate, Shelley left his parents' 1993 Ford pickup in
the parking lot and joined White in his Cherokee.</TE>
<TE>   They drove to the Somerset Flea Market, where they campaigned
along with Morris.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the afternoon, Morris went home, police say, and Shelley
and White went back to get Shelley's truck.</TE>
<TE>   Morris, prosecutors allege, had gone home to get the motorcycle.
But there was a problem. Its battery was dead.</TE>
<TE>   He was able to jump-start the bike and, police say, called White
and Shelley on a cell phone and told them to meet him up the highway
at Wal-Mart.</TE>
<TE>   The three gathered at the store, according to authorities, where
they bought a motorcycle battery and installed it. Shelley left his
pickup there and rode off.</TE>
<TE>   A few hours later, prosecutors allege, Shelley parked the
motorcycle by the side of Kentucky 80 and hiked down a steep hill
into an oak grove. He set up in the shadows.</TE>
<TE>   A hundred yards south, on the far side of a still-green hayfield,
the party was in full swing at the fire department. Then the band
took a break.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the annual fish fry had become an informal
political gathering, where whoever might be running for office could
give a five-minute speech if they were inclined. No one took anywhere
near five minutes that night. Most just introduced themselves.</TE>
<TE>   That's what Morris did. That's what Catron did. With a somewhat
shy smile and a bit of a belly--thanks in part to his fondness for
the ribs at the Ponderosa Steakhouse--the four-term sheriff delivered
his standard, humble address: "Hi, folks. I'm Sam Catron. I'm running
for sheriff and I'd sure appreciate your vote."</TE>
<TE>   Then they started auctioning off the cakes and pies. The
firefighters invited the sheriff onstage to hold up the goods so the
crowd could see.</TE>
<TE>   Almost everyone knew Catron, and many had known his father. Harold
Catron was the police chief in Somerset in 1958 when a bootlegger
shot him in the back as he stood on his porch. Sam Catron was 4. His
father died seven years later of injuries from the shotgun blast.</TE>
<TE>   Up on the bandstand, the sheriff grinned. He bought one cake, then
gave it back so it could be sold again. Then he bought two more.</TE>
<TE>   As the band began taking the stage again, Morris was standing near
the firehouse door, witnesses say. Catron began strolling toward his
brown cruiser, parked 20 feet away on the side of the road. He put
one cake on the roof and held the other, a white or yellow one, in
his hand.</TE>
<TE>   The "crack" of the shot was muffled somewhat by the heavy air, but
everyone heard it. They looked in the direction of the report and saw
the sheriff collapse, a stream of blood coming from his head "like
you were pouring water from a pitcher," Riley, the firefighter,
recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Less than a minute later, a motorcycle appeared on Kentucky 80,
roaring as it accelerated. Everybody thought immediately that it was
the shooter.</TE>
<TE>   Had the motorcyclist sped west, no one would have seen him; the
view of the highway is blocked by the same massive oak grove he
allegedly fled. But he went east, and Riley, other firefighters,
deputies and citizens ran to their cars to give chase.</TE>
<TE>   Shelley turned off Kentucky 80 and onto Route 1675, the same road
the sheriff's car was on, heading away from the scene. He was
speeding. The pavement was just slightly damp. He took one corner too
fast and the bike slid out from under him.</TE>
<TE>   He was only scratched. A Remington bolt-action rifle was beside
him. His pursuers were on him in seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Shelley started talking before he'd even gotten to the police
station, according to police reports. He commented on the difficulty
of his long-range shot. He talked about the plot. He named names.</TE>
<TE>   Within hours, authorities learned the motorcycle belonged to
Morris. On Sunday they pieced together the movements of the three on
the previous day. On Monday, they arrested the remaining two.</TE>
<TE>   Morris also soon confessed, according to court testimony. White
said he was involved in the campaign but knew nothing of a plan to
kill the sheriff.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Riley knew Catron for more than 20 years. She saw him at
church, at the steakhouse, piloting the sheriff's department's
helicopter on marijuana raids. Like countless others here, she never
once saw him wearing anything other than his uniform. "I saw a
picture of him once out of uniform. He was wearing a tuxedo, at a
wedding."</TE>
<TE>   For her, the questions are innumerable.</TE>
<TE>   How could the culprits have believed this would help them win the
election, as prosecutors contend? Why would they shoot him in front
of 350 people instead of alone at his house?</TE>
<TE>   Why, on election day, did 123 of 11,897 voters still cast their
ballots for jailed murder suspect Morris?</TE>
<TE>   After Catron died, Riley and other firefighters staked a Sam
Catron campaign sign a few feet from where he fell.</TE>
<TE>   Mourners hung flowers from it and piled bouquets in the grass
beneath.</TE>
<TE>   But people--mostly the grieving but also the curious--came by day
and night and couldn't see the memorial after dark. So the
firefighters planted a lantern at each end</TE>
<TE>   "It's better now," Riley said this recent night from beneath the
yellow glow of the lanterns. "It looks nice even after the sun goes
down."</TE>

<HD>Indian Fund Costs Put at $2.4 Billion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Interior Department estimated Friday that it will cost $2.4
billion and take a decade to rectify almost a century of
mismanagement of a trust fund that oversees royalties collected from
Indian-owned land.</LD>
<LD>   In a 100-page report to Congress, the Interior Department's Office
of Historical Trust Accounting said $13 billion has been collected in
more than 100 million transactions since 1909. The report
acknowledged that some of that money hasn't been paid out because of
discrepancies and lost records.</LD>
<LD>   "The historical accounting project is complex, challenging and
enormous," Assistant Interior Secretary Lynn Scarlett said.</LD>
<TE>   The government's mishandling of the trust fund account is the crux
of a class-action lawsuit filed six years ago by Elouise Cobell, a
member of the Blackfeet in Montana, that has become the largest
lawsuit filed by Native Americans against the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   Cobell alleged that the money collected for grazing, drilling and
logging on behalf of an estimated 500,000 Indian landowners has been
improperly collected, stolen and otherwise mismanaged.</TE>
<TE>   The assessment of the problem in the report is "a significant step
forward," according to Dan Dubray at the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
"It's now a matter of how to proceed and what funds will be available
to proceed."</TE>

<HD>Firefighters Now Putting Focus on Flood Control</HD>
<DH>Nature: In areas laid bare by the blazes, even a little
rain could send torrents rushing down hillsides. But most evacuees
return home.</DH>

<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Crews turned their attention Friday from fighting fires to preventing
floods in areas denuded of vegetation by wildfires. On hillsides
where blazes burned intensely and stripped the soil bare of all
living organisms, water rolled off the ground as if it were asphalt.</LD>
<LD>   Residents from 200 homes in Glenwood Springs, about 150 miles west
of here, were back home after being evacuated because of a forecast
of rain the night before.</LD>
<LD>   "One thunderstorm died out at the last minute," said Brian Avery,
a hydrologist with the National Weather Service in Grand Junction.</LD>
<TE>   Just one-tenth of an inch of rain could send a wave of water and
debris down Mitchell Creek toward homes, said Guy Meyer, of Garfield
County Emergency Management.</TE>
<TE>   "We all pretty much knew that there was a part two to this and
that the fire in and of itself wasn't the end of it," Meyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Crews also were working on installing hay bales and straw, secured
with netting, to absorb water and slow its flow down the hillside.</TE>
<TE>   Wildfires still burned in parts of several Western states,
including Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah. In
Colorado, firefighters were gaining on the 73,145-acre blaze north of
Durango.</TE>
<TE>   A light rain, not enough to cause flooding, fell as crews worked
to stop the fire from spreading eastward, fire information officer
Chris Zajicek said. The fire was 75% contained. Residents from four
ranches and 34 homes remained evacuated.</TE>

<HD>Baseball's Last .400 Hitter Dies</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ted Williams, the hall-of-fame baseball player whose primary
motivation in life was to be recognized as "the greatest hitter who
ever lived," died Friday of heart failure at a hospital in Inverness,
Fla. He was 83.</LD>
<LD>   The former Boston Red Sox star outfielder and San Diego native had
suffered two strokes in the early 1990s that severely impaired the
keen vision that helped Williams hit .406 in 1941, the last time a
major leaguer broke the .400 barrier.</LD>
<LD>   Williams had a pacemaker inserted in November 2000, then underwent
open-heart surgery in New York in January 2001.</LD>
<TE>   "With the passing of Ted Williams, America has lost a baseball
legend," said President Bush, who once owned the Texas Rangers in the
American League.</TE>
<TE>   "He inspired young ballplayers across the nation for decades and
we will always remember his persistence on the field and his courage
off the field. Ted gave baseball some of its best seasons--and he
gave his own best seasons to his country. He will be greatly missed."</TE>
<TE>   Nicknamed "The Kid," "The Splendid Splinter" and "Teddy Ballgame,"
Williams had a .344 career batting average with 521 home runs in 19
seasons from 1939-60. He would have been a 700-homer threat had he
not missed almost five seasons serving as a Marine pilot during World
War II and the Korean War.</TE>
<TE>   Babe Ruth had more power and Ty Cobb the highest lifetime average,
but perhaps no other player hit for power and average as well as the
smooth-swinging, left-handed-hitting Williams. His book "The Science
of Hitting" is considered the bible of the craft and a must-read for
any aspiring ballplayer.</TE>
<TE>   Born in San Diego a month before the Red Sox last won a World
Series in 1918, Williams rose from a gangly player at Herbert Hoover
High to a big-leaguer of such acclaim that many still consider him
the best hitter in baseball history.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the best hitter I ever pitched to," said hall-of-fame
pitcher Bob Feller, who played for the Cleveland Indians from
1936-56. "If it hadn't been for World War II and Korea, no one would
have more records than Ted Williams."</TE>
<TE>   Hall-of-famer Stan Musial, a seven-time National League batting
champion with the St. Louis Cardinals, said: "He was the greatest
hitter of our era. He led the [American] league six times and a
couple of other times he was close. He served our country for five
years or else he would have won more batting titles."</TE>
<TE>   Added Bobby Doerr, another hall-of-famer who played with Williams
for 10 seasons, "I think he was the best hitter that baseball has
had."</TE>
<TE>   Frank Howard, a former major-league slugger, said, "He is the
premier measuring stick for all hitters."</TE>
<TE>   In Boston on Friday, the Jumbotron television screen at Fenway
Park carried only a giant 9, Williams' retired number. While members
of Williams' former team took batting practice, former Red Sox
shortstop Johnny Pesky stood near home plate and talked about his
friend of more than 60 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Williams, he could do anything at bat," said Pesky, gazing out at
a seat deep in the stands that has been painted red--the others are
green--to commemorate Williams' longest home run, hit to that very
spot. "Ted was our guru. He was such a bright guy, and everything
came so simply for him."</TE>
<TE>   Even in retirement, Williams' personality so dominated Boston
baseball, Pesky said, that, "You could bring Moses down from heaven,
and he wouldn't have that impact.... He was like a movie star. He
always thought he was the John Wayne of baseball. Which he was."</TE>
<TE>   Present-day Red Sox star Nomar Garciaparra said, "I didn't look at
him as the greatest hitter ever. I looked at him as a friend. The
impact that he had here in Boston, you see his number up there,
retired in right field, and you see the [red] seat. It's all his
accomplishments."</TE>
<TE>   An average defensive player with below-average speed, Williams
made his greatest impact at the plate. He won Triple Crowns in 1942
and '47, leading the American League in batting average, home runs
and runs batted in. He hit .388 at 39 and won a batting title when he
was 40.</TE>
<TE>   Williams had almost three times as many walks, 2,019, as
strikeouts, 709, and retired with a .483 on-base percentage,
baseball's highest. That might be the sport's most meaningful
statistic--Williams reached base nearly every other time he came to
bat for 19 years. Ruth's .474 is next-highest.</TE>
<TE>   "He was better than Joe DiMaggio," Feller said. "No contest."</TE>
<TE>   Williams and DiMaggio will be forever linked in baseball lore
because they were the best players of the 1940s, they starred for
archrivals, the Red Sox and New York Yankees, and they were the lead
characters in one of baseball's most dramatic seasons, 1941.</TE>
<TE>   That was the year DiMaggio set what many consider an unbreakable
record, getting at least one hit in 56 consecutive games, and
Williams, with a finishing flourish, posted his .406 average, which
hasn't been approached since.</TE>
<TE>   Williams was batting .39955 going into the final day of the
season, and Manager Joe Cronin offered to sit him down to protect a
mark that would have rounded off to .400.</TE>
<TE>   "To hell with that," snapped Williams. "I don't want it that way."</TE>
<TE>   The self-confident, cantankerous Williams, whose battles with the
Boston media were as legendary as his love-hate relationship with Red
Sox fans, did it his way: He had six hits in eight at-bats in a
doubleheader, finishing at .406.</TE>
<TE>   DiMaggio, however, edged Williams for the league's
most-valuable-player award that year.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure if Joe rated MVP or not that time, but he got it," a
teammate of Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   The teammate? Dom DiMaggio, Joe's brother.</TE>
<TE>   Decades later, speaking at a 1994 dedication of the Ted Williams
Museum and Hitters Hall of Fame in Citrus Hills, Fla., Joe DiMaggio
may have ended the debate of who was the better hitter.</TE>
<TE>   "The game had some great hitters that I did not see," said
DiMaggio, who died in 1999. "But from 1936 to the present day, I can
truthfully say I have never seen a better hitter than Ted Williams."</TE>
<TE>   Williams followed DiMaggio to the lectern and said, "I would have
to agree with 100% of what [DiMaggio] said."</TE>
<TE>   Then he grew serious, and more humble.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me tell you a little secret," Williams continued. "As I go to
many of the places I go, and people start talking about the greatest
hitter that ever lived, I get a little lower in my seat. I try to
hide, but I can't.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe it myself. I feel there's something wrong about
trying to single one guy out, but to put me in the same company with
Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio ... that suits me to a T."</TE>
<TE>   Like DiMaggio, a San Francisco native of humble origins, Williams
grew up in California, in the North Park neighborhood of San Diego.
He was the older of two sons born to Sam and May Williams, a
seemingly mismatched couple with little interest in parenthood.</TE>
<TE>   His father had served in the Cavalry and made a modest living as a
commercial photographer. He named his son Teddy--that name is on
Williams' birth certificate--after Teddy Roosevelt and liked to tell
people that he had ridden with Roosevelt's Rough Riders, which was
never confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' mother, a devout member of the Salvation Army, was a
dominant but emotionally distant figure, spending most of her time
trying to save the souls of the down-and-out of San Diego and
Tijuana, earning the nicknames of "Salvation May" and the "Angel of
Tijuana."</TE>
<TE>   "I was embarrassed about my home, embarrassed that I never had
quite as good clothes as some of the kids, embarrassed that my mother
was out in the middle of the damn street all the time," Williams
wrote in his autobiography, "My Turn At Bat." "My dad and I were
never close."</TE>
<TE>   Williams' outlet was baseball. In only two years, he went from
high school in San Diego to the Pacific Coast League, then to Boston,
arriving at the Back Bay train station in April 1939.</TE>
<TE>   He was a 6-foot-4, 172-pounder who was confident to the point of
cockiness.</TE>
<TE>   The previous year, at Red Sox spring training, second baseman
Doerr had said to Williams, "Ted, wait till you see [future
hall-of-famer] Jimmie Foxx hit."</TE>
<TE>   Williams replied, "Wait till Foxx sees me hit."</TE>
<TE>   As a rookie in 1939, Williams uttered the words foreshadowing a
devotion to his craft so complete that he had his bats weighed at the
post office and picked the brains of anyone--players, writers,
broadcasters--about opposing pitchers:</TE>
<TE>   "All I want out of life is that, when I walk down the street,
folks will say, 'There goes the greatest hitter who ever lived.' "</TE>
<TE>   Williams quickly began fueling those hopes, hitting .327 as a
rookie and earning the nickname "The Splendid Splinter" because of
his lankiness and sweet swing.</TE>
<TE>   He hit .344 in his second year, had his signature season in 1941,
and as he matured physically, began hitting with more power, winning
the Triple Crown in his fourth year by leading the league with a .356
average, 36 homers and 137 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   In November 1942, Williams, then 24 and in his prime, joined the
Navy as an aviation cadet and eventually earned his officer's
commission in the Marines. He was scheduled for combat duty in the
South Pacific, but the war ended before Williams was called and he
returned to the Red Sox for the 1946 season.</TE>
<TE>   "I lost four years to the war, Ted lost 4 1/2 years [in his two
service stints]--no one ever complained," Feller said. "The heroes
didn't come home, the survivors did. We were from a different
generation. We didn't go on the disabled list when the war broke out.
There was no DL. You fought or you lost."</TE>
<TE>   Williams came home, and it was as if he never left. He hit .342
with 38 homers and 123 RBIs, won American League MVP honors and led
Boston to the pennant in 1946.</TE>
<TE>   In June that year, Williams hit the longest home run in Fenway
Park history, a shot that landed in the 33rd row of the right-field
bleachers, more than 500 feet from home plate. That's where today the
seat is painted red.</TE>
<TE>   In July, Williams went 4-for-4 with two homers and five RBIs in
the All-Star game at Fenway Park. This was also the year "the
Williams shift'' was born.</TE>
<TE>   On July 14, Williams, a pull hitter who laced almost all of his
hits to right field, smashed three homers and drove in eight runs in
the first game of a doubleheader against Cleveland, then doubled home
three more runs in his first at-bat of the nightcap.</TE>
<TE>   Indians Manager Lou Boudreau decided to move everyone except his
left fielder to the right side of the field, and Williams grounded
out and walked twice to finish the game.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis did not employ the shift in the World Series that
October, but Williams was not a factor in his first and only Series,
batting .200 as the Cardinals won, four games to three.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, Boston lost a one-game playoff to Cleveland for
the American League pennant, and in 1949, the Yankees edged the Red
Sox on the last day of the season to win the pennant.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, whose pitching-poor teams were annually drubbed by the
powerful Yankees, never again got close to postseason play. Though he
was still one of baseball's best players in the 1950s--a decade
interrupted by a two-year stint in Korea, where he flew 39 missions
and twice landed his fighter plane after having been hit by
antiaircraft fire--he never played another meaningful game in
October.</TE>
<TE>   He retired in 1960, and though he might have lost some bat speed
toward the end of his career, his pride remained fully intact. For
that 1960 season, having slumped to a .254 average in 1959, Williams
demanded a 30% pay cut, from $125,000 to $90,000.</TE>
<TE>   For all his success, the failures ate at Williams.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a thrill to get up there and make it and find out I was as
good as anybody--those things were very gratifying to me," Williams
once said. "But there was a lot of disappointment too."</TE>
<TE>   In a January 2000 interview with the New York Times, Williams
said, "I still can't sleep at night, thinking about the failures."</TE>
<TE>   Some of those extended to his personal life, as well. Williams had
three broken marriages--to Doris Soule (1944-55), Lee Howard
(1961-66) and Dolores Wettach (1967-72)--and longtime companion
Louise Kaufman died in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Looking to cash in on the late 1980s sports memorabilia craze,
Williams got mixed up in a partnership with a scam artist that cost
him close to $3 million. John Henry Williams, Ted's son--there also
were two daughters, Bobbie Jo and Claudia--spent several years on a
crusade to rid the business of items with forged Ted Williams
autographs.</TE>
<TE>   Controversy was a constant companion during his playing days too.
For two decades, Williams was usually the biggest story in Boston, a
town with nine daily newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   Fighting for circulation and exclusives with the abandon of the
London tabloids covering the royal family, they found as many things
wrong as right with the dominant hitter of his time.</TE>
<TE>   Williams missed one MVP award in 1942 when the powerful New York
press campaigned against him. Yankee second baseman Joe Gordon, who
led the league in errors and strikeouts, won the MVP, even though
Williams won the Triple Crown. Gordon hit .322 with 18 homers and 103
RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   In 1947, his second Triple Crown season, Williams had a better
average, .343 to .317; more homers, 32 to 20, and more RBIs, 114 to
97, than Joe DiMaggio, but DiMaggio won the MVP by one vote because
Dave Egan, a Boston baseball writer, left Williams off his ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "They started writing things about me, like I wasn't driving in
enough runs, even though I was driving in 100," Williams said in a
1991 interview. "That I wasn't getting the big hits. Then they
started writing personal things. I suppose I shouldn't have taken it
so seriously, but I did."</TE>
<TE>   He campaigned successfully to have writers banned from the
clubhouse before games. And to spite the local writers, Williams
would occasionally grant lengthy interviews to writers from small
papers outside of Boston while ignoring the local reporters.</TE>
<TE>   As introverted as DiMaggio but, in the estimate of his pals,
warmer-hearted, Williams was thin-skinned and often belligerent when
crossed.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys that played with him really loved him, but he had his
problems with the print media and some radio and TV guys," said Ernie
Harwell, the longtime voice of the Detroit Tigers who has been a
baseball broadcaster since 1941. "Early in his career, a couple of
Boston writers got on his case and were unrelenting. Ted was
outspoken, and he made some public relations mistakes. He was burned
early, and that was partially his fault, but he had hard feelings
toward [the media] and those never went away."</TE>
<TE>   Years later, during his four unsuccessful seasons as a manager of
the Washington Senators, who became the Texas Rangers--his teams won
273 games and lost 364 from 1969 through 1972--Williams referred to
sportswriters as "the manager's pallbearers."</TE>
<TE>   Fans weren't always high on his list either. Disgusted by a home
crowd that jeered and cheered him in the same inning of a game
against the Yankees in 1956, Williams ran back to the dugout spitting
toward the left-field and right-field stands. Then, to hammer his
point home, he stepped back out of the dugout and spat again.</TE>
<TE>   His wars with the Boston fans and media so scarred Williams that
he refused to tip his cap after hitting a home run in his final
big-league at-bat, in Boston in 1960.</TE>
<TE>   John Updike, in his famous magazine piece about Williams' last
game, titled "Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu," wrote:</TE>
<TE>   "He always ran out home runs hurriedly, unsmiling, head down [and]
didn't tip his cap. He hid in the dugout. Gods do not answer
letters."</TE>
<TE>   Unless they were from sick kids. Williams had a crusty exterior
and, in public, could hardly be described as cuddly--in some circles,
he was known as "Terrible Ted"--but he had a soft spot for kids
facing serious illnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Williams was a tireless foot soldier in the battle against
children's cancer. He would go anywhere and do anything in the name
of the Jimmy Fund, the Boston charity that fights children's cancer,
as long as there were no cameras to record his deeds.</TE>
<TE>   The deeper Williams went into retirement, during which he went
fishing or played golf or tennis almost daily for more than 30 years
until his first stroke in 1991, the more mellow Williams became
toward the Boston fans and media.</TE>
<TE>   At a 1991 "Ted Williams Day" ceremony to commemorate the 50th
anniversary of his .406 season, Williams told a Fenway Park crowd:</TE>
<TE>   "I realized about 42 years ago ... I realized far back I was
playing for super-great fans. I had a love affair with them, but I
never showed it. When I finally consented to do this, I started to
think, 'What am I gonna say?' Then I thought it might be nice to tip
my hat."</TE>
<TE>   Over the last 100 years, Boston was graced by the extraordinary
skills of a young Babe Ruth, basketball stars Larry Bird and Bill
Russell, and hockey star Bobby Orr, but it was Williams who was named
New England sports figure of the century by the Boston Globe in 1999.
The city also named a tunnel after him.</TE>
<TE>   Williams didn't return to Fenway again until 1999, when he threw
out the first pitch of the All-Star game in an emotional ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   With every All-Star player along the baselines and members of "the
All-Century team" ringed around the infield, Williams rode to the
pitcher's mound in a golf cart and was flocked by all of the players
on the field.</TE>
<TE>   One by one, modern-day stars--Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, Tony
Gwynn, Garciaparra and others--shook Williams' hand and chatted with
him.</TE>
<TE>   Wrote Karen Guregian of the Boston Herald, "It was the grandfather
of baseball, mobbed by all of his grandchildren; the greatest hitter
who ever lived, hailed by all of his underlings."</TE>
<TE>   Said former home run champion McGwire, "A lot of guys out there
kind of teared up. When you see Ted Williams with tears in his eyes,
it's an emotional time. What a man."</TE>
<TE>   "It was amazing," Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martinez said. "I don't
think there will be any other man that will replace him."</TE>
<TE>   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.</TE>
