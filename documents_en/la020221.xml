<LD>The images of a home video scroll through my head like a machine
stuck in replay, repeating the same scene over and over: a little
girl dancing and running toward the camera, then suddenly turning
away and glancing back to flash a smile that fills the frame. Her
name is Danielle van Dam, and she has vanished from the Earth like a
sun sprite in the rain.</LD>
<LD>   I can't get the images out of my head, even though television has
ceased to show them as frequently as they had in the days immediately
following Danielle's disappearance more than three weeks ago. She was
allegedly taken from her bed sometime during the night and has not
been seen since.</LD>
<LD>   The video was released by her parents, Brenda and Damon van Dam,
who have mounted an intense campaign for the return of their
7-year-old daughter. Police have questioned dozens of neighbors,
focusing attention on David Westerfield, a self-employed engineer who
lives two doors away from the Van Dams, but no one has been charged
in the girl's disappearance.</LD>
<TE>   Hundreds of volunteers have searched the hillsides that surround
the community and an area of the Imperial Valley desert visited by
Westerfield in his motor home the day that Danielle was kidnapped. A
Web site has been created, a bloodhound brought in and a toll-free
phone line established in the search.</TE>
<TE>   But for all of these efforts and more, a little girl with a smile
as bright as heaven remains only an image on a home video, a magic
moment now laced with grief.</TE>
<TE>   Among the crimes that can drive me into a rage are those committed
against children. I think about the 1993 rape and murder of
12-year-old Polly Klaas, taken from a slumber party in her Petaluma
home. And I think about 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey, the sad little
beauty queen beaten to death more than five years ago in her Colorado
home.</TE>
<TE>   Polly's father called his daughter "America's child" to stimulate
interest during a nine-week search that brought Hollywood celebrities
into the mix and made Polly's name a metaphor for innocence betrayed.</TE>
<TE>   Her body was found under a sheet of plywood not far from her home.
A drifter named Richard Allen Davis was convicted of killing her and
sentenced to death.</TE>
<TE>   The murder of little JonBenet, its investigation seemingly bungled
by police, has never been solved. Seen in photographs, she was the
personification of a child thrust into an artificial world of beauty
competitions, her face painted in an almost clownlike imitation of
adulthood, her smile posed and wooden.</TE>
<TE>   Her beauty, both real and cosmetic, was destroyed by a killer who
covered her mouth with duct tape, fractured her skull and tightened a
nylon cord around her neck. She lay like a ravaged doll in the
basement of her home, a child whose final, terrifying moments of life
we can only imagine.</TE>
<TE>   And now Danielle.</TE>
<TE>   She enters the world of missing children emulsified on posters and
handbills, of playful sprites prancing before video cameras in the
days of their innocence, of young lives turned to statistics before
they've had a chance to imagine their own future.</TE>
<TE>   One grieves already for what is bound to be the conclusion of a
sad and desperate quest for Danielle. Hope remains because hope is
all that's left, but deep inside where fear abides, we know ... we
know.</TE>
<TE>   It is instinctive among sane and reasonable adults to protect
their heritage, to guard the lives and well-being of their children
from monsters that prowl the nights. Girls especially seem vulnerable
to men like Richard Allen Davis and to the faceless demon whose
shadow fell over the life of JonBenet.</TE>
<TE>   I remember protecting my own two daughters with the intensity of a
guard dog when they were young, and now I do the same for two
beautiful teenage granddaughters whenever they're in my charge. More
than instinct causes me to be alert to the dangers that lurk in a
world where the young suffer.</TE>
<TE>   My career as a journalist has been filled with experiences I wish
I'd never had, including the search for a 14-year-old girl named
Stephanie Bryan, whose disappearance 46 years ago made national
headlines.</TE>
<TE>   A pretty and outgoing girl, she was kidnapped from in front of her
Berkeley school on a sunny day in April and vanished into what seemed
like another world. For three months we searched--volunteers, police
and journalists--until the hunt became an obsession, and I began
searching alone in areas where she had been last seen.</TE>
<TE>   When I wasn't searching, I was staking out the Bryan home.</TE>
<TE>   I remember sitting in my car near their house one evening when all
the other reporters had gone home. Stephanie's mother came to the
door. She walked to the end of the porch and looked up and down the
street, both ways. Her lips moved but I couldn't hear what she might
have been saying. I've wondered ever since if, in her hope and her
pain, she might have been calling her daughter's name one last time.</TE>
<TE>   Stephanie's bludgeoned body was found buried in the mountains near
the cabin of a University of California student named Burton Abbott,
who was convicted of her murder and executed two years later.</TE>
<TE>   I think of Stephanie, I think of Polly, I think of JonBenet and
now I think of Danielle. And I wonder how many of America's children
we will add to a growing list of statistics that will ultimately
define who and what we are in this strange and often terrifying age.</TE>

<LD>Liza Minnelli and David Gest celebrate their much ballyhooed
engagement tonight at the Mondrian Hotel's Skybar with a lavish
poolside party. Co-hosted by retired sports agent Dennis "Mr.
Baseball" Gilbert and CNN's Larry King, the party has a guest list of
200 that features a who's who of old Hollywood, Gregory Peck, Eva
Marie Saint and Red Buttons among them.</LD>
<LD>   Many are attending in lieu of flying east for the couple's March
16 wedding at Marble Collegiate Church in New York. It's the first
marriage for Gest, 48, and the fourth for Minnelli, 55. (Numbers one,
two and three are entertainer Peter Allen, filmmaker Jack Haley Jr.
and sculptor Mark Gero.)</LD>
<LD>   Guests will gather under a transparent tent raised over the
Skybar's outdoor pool for seven types of hors d'oeuvres, cocktails
and a dinner of smoked salmon caviar, Cuban spiced chicken and
grilled mojito rib steak. Party planners have arranged a poolside
Baldwin baby grand piano for Michael Feinstein or impromptu
performances by Minnelli and others.</LD>
<TE>   Confirmed to attend are co-best man Michael Jackson, who will
"give away" the groom with brother Tito Jackson, and co-maid of honor
Elizabeth Taylor, who is sharing the role with Marisa Berenson.
Bridesmaids Janet Leigh and Esther Williams are also expected.</TE>
<TE>   The couple reportedly have been dating since autumn, but it's
unclear how the singer and the event producer originally met.
According to some reports, they were introduced by Michael Jackson in
September when Minnelli was performing at Jackson's 30th anniversary
concert at New York's Madison Square Garden. Other reports state they
met in the late 1980s, but didn't hit it off until more recently.</TE>

<TE>   Fans to the Rescue</TE>
<TE>   The latest installment of the great fan campaign to save
endangered TV shows and characters appeared Tuesday in Daily Variety.
"'Stargate' without Daniel is like 'Star Trek' without Spock," read a
full-page ad. "Find out how to help at www.savedanieljackson.com."
For the uninitiated, "Daniel" is Daniel Jackson, the character played
by Michael Shanks on 'Stargate,' an MGM-produced show. And while
"Stargate" stays, word is out that Daniel must go.</TE>
<TE>   So fans have appear to have rallied. They may be heartened by
another recent campaign, a plea to save ABC's "Once and Again," which
was rumored to be headed for its last episode. Fans began passing the
hat and in a week raised about $2,800 for a full-page ad that ran
late last month in the Hollywood Reporter, says Lynda Shulman, a VP
at a marketing company near Boston, who participated in the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a crazed fan," says Shulman, who connected with fellow
"Once and Again" aficionados on the Web, "but I watched it from the
beginning." Campaigning on behalf of the show "doesn't take a lot of
time," she adds, and the results are worth it. The show, which went
on hiatus Jan. 11, returns early next month, and fans are taking out
an ad, unpersuaded by network statements that the show's planned
hiatus would've ended without their efforts. Fan fervor has prompted
a N.Y. company to found savethatshow.com, a site where viewers can
vote on their favorite shows. Poll results are sent to the networks,
and the company's press kit promises: "No ballot stuffing," with one
vote on each show.</TE>

<TE>   Adults Only</TE>
<TE>   Greg Salsburg is dressed to the nines in a crisply laundered suit
with his hair slicked back. The buxom ladies in the tiny T-shirts
know him by name. He has a handshake and a sound bite for everyone he
meets. As Salsburg walks by, one man announces, "Everyone here is a
friend of Greg." Don't be mistaken, however. The fresh-faced Salsburg
isn't running for office. He's the president and CEO of a budding
adult entertainment empire.</TE>
<TE>   It's Monday night, and Salsburg is the host of this jumping party
at Moomba in West Hollywood, an intimate affair celebrating the
launch of IVOLT Networks. The official line is that IVOLT is a
multimedia distribution company. But Salsburg doesn't hesitate to
name his target competition: Playboy.com and Danni's Hard Drive, a
wildly successful Los Angeles-based porn Web site founded by model
Danni Ashe.</TE>
<TE>   IVOLT grew out of Salsburg's own marketing know-how. (The
35-year-old spent nearly 10 years promoting dozens of celebrities as
well as the celebrity-owned restaurant chain Planet Hollywood, Motown
Cafe and the World Wrestling Federation.) Ultimately, he followed the
market. And the market led him to the Internet's thriving adult
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   During the last year or so, Salsburg collected about $4 million
from private investors in Las Vegas, New York and Los Angeles. His
goal is to have an IVOLT channel available in hotel rooms.
"Everything we do is viral," he says. "We have a 3.8-million-person
database--3.8 million."</TE>
<TE>   He launched his Web site on Valentine's Day.</TE>

<TE>   Oblivion, Anyone?</TE>
<TE>   "Prozac Nation" author Elizabeth Wurtzel  recently told a Canadian
journalist that after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, "I just felt,
like, everyone was overreacting.</TE>
<TE>   "People were going on about it," Wurtzel said in an interview with
the Globe and Mail. "That part really annoyed me."</TE>
<TE>   Wurtzel, who lives in an apartment not far from the World Trade
Center, said when her mother called to tell her that a plane had just
crashed into one of the towers, "my main thought was: What a pain
.... " Still, she seems disappointed that her reaction went unsought.
"You know what was really funny? After the fact, all these different
writers were writing these things about what it was like, and nobody
bothered to call me."</TE>

<HD>Begonias and Beyond</HD>
<DH>Irene Nuss and fellow amateurs are honored for
horticultural contributions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN DARDICK</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Irene Nuss recalls running across the wet lawn of her Los Angeles
house in the dark, flashlight in hand, to see if her begonia plant
had female flowers. If it did, a world of possibilities loomed. She
was not disappointed.</LD>
<LD>   It was the moment--the year was 1959--that her passion for
begonias took off. By 1969, her own begonia creation, 'Kentwood,' had
swept trophies at a national begonia show. Over the years, she has
earned more acclaim with more prize-winning varieties, including the
renowned plant bearing her name, 'Irene Nuss.'</LD>
<LD>   She is an amateur gardener whose contributions have rivaled those
made by professional horticulturists. To honor contributions by Nuss
and others like her who have so freely shared what they have
achieved, the Huntington Botanical Gardens in San Marino has
instituted a special recognition award. Last week, she and two other
growers who have taken begonias to new heights, colors and textures
were the first to be honored.</LD>
<TE>   "We're celebrating people whose passion for plants has led them
into something that benefits other gardeners," explained Shirley
Kerins, manager of the Huntington's monthly gardening programs known
as Second Thursday. She and Dick Mallott, a volunteer at the
Huntington, originated the award to recognize contributions of
hands-in-the-dirt gardeners.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who took inspiration from Nuss, 83, is fellow honoree
Brad Thompson, 45, of Lomita. He has been collecting and creating new
begonia varieties since 1988, with many of his hybrids earning top
honors from the American Begonia Society. The third honoree, Rudolph
Ziesenhenne, 90, of Santa Barbara, was recognized for his writings
about begonias.</TE>
<TE>   Begonias are tropical, growing abundantly in rain forests. There
are hundreds of species and cultivars, but the most commonly known to
home gardeners are popularly called "wax begonias." They are very
different from exotic-looking rex begonias, prized for bold,
multicolored leaves, or rhizomatous begonias, also grown for their
multicolored leaves. It was the rhizomatous begonia that captured the
attention of Ziesenhenne, who has 80 varieties to his name.</TE>
<TE>   Cane begonias, also known as "angel wing," are the type to which
Nuss and Thompson have devoted so much time. The plants have stems
that grow tall and upright with bamboo-like joints and that sport
showy clusters of flowers.</TE>
<TE>   Nuss remembers clearly the day--rather, night--more than 40 years
ago when the begonia bug bit her. She had just attended a meeting of
the newly founded Westchester Begonia Society. The evening's speaker
explained how to create new versions of these plants by gathering
pollen from male flowers to fertilize female flowers. Before the
lecture, she hadn't even realized that plants had two sexes of
flowers. The best time to fertilize a flower, she was told, was at
night, so she followed the advice and pollinated one flower. For her
trouble, she ended up with hundreds of seeds, each no bigger than a
grain of salt.</TE>
<TE>   "I began hybridizing just for the fun of it," she recalled. "I was
fascinated that from a tiny seed you could grow such big plants." She
has since created more than 50 named varieties of cane begonias.</TE>
<TE>   Nuss is known for transforming plants that had been difficult to
grow outdoors. Her plants are as at home in a landscape as they are
in a greenhouse.  She's also concentrated on creating plants with
larger flowers, extending the bloom season, and in general making
cane begonias easier to grow.</TE>
<TE>   "Irene's contributions have been remarkable," Mallott said. "As a
backyard breeder, with no scientific training, she's been able to
take exotic and somewhat fragile cane begonias, propagate them, and
make them adapt to growing outside in a warm climate."</TE>
<TE>   Nuss has nurtured not just plants but other gardeners.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson, who counts Nuss among his friends and mentors, began his
hybridizing work using her hybrids. He has created 350 new varieties,
including acclaimed series such as Egyptian, Indian and King Arthur.
In 2000, the American Begonia Society bestowed the prestigious Alfred
D. Robinson Award to his 'Mary Sakamoto'; last year, the same medal
went to his 'Little Miss Mummey', named for Elda Mummey Reginbal.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson, too, has spent time creating varieties that don't need
as much care. If left to themselves, cane begonias can grow tall--up
to 10 feet--and spindly. Begonia fanciers pinch and prune to keep
their plants shapely and encourage lots of flowers.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson's plants are valued because of their compact shapes and
quantities of flowers. Thompson is also trying to create cane
begonias with different colors and is facing the challenge of
creating yellow-flowered begonias.</TE>
<TE>   Both Nuss and Thompson freely share their plants and what they
have learned with other gardeners and nurseries. And, without regret,
they have seen commercial growers enjoy the benefit of selling
plants they developed.</TE>
<TE>   "Breeding begonias is a full-time hobby for me,'' Thompson says.
"I have the fame but not the fortune," he adds with a laugh, then
explains that money isn't his motivation. "Once money is involved, it
takes the pleasure out of it."</TE>
<TE>   Nuss has a similar philosophy. "I just want people to grow my
plants and enjoy begonias," she says. "My royalties are the letters I
receive from people telling me how much they enjoy the plants."</TE>
<TE>   One of her early creations, the cane begonia named for her, is one
of the American Begonia Society's most highly honored and is grown
extensively--including several in the Huntington's collection.</TE>

<HD>What Lies Beneath</HD>
<DH>A museum examines bomb shelters and the mentality they
reflected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEANNINE STEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SANTA BARBARA</DL>
<LD>What a sleek, streamlined, postwar-era modern home this seems to be,
outfitted with a spiral staircase, a cozy kitchen with a drip
coffeemaker and neatly arranged storage space. But a closer look at
an architect's rendering from 1955 reveals that this is no suburban
tract home--it's a fallout shelter.</LD>
<LD>   "Nuclear Families: The Home Fallout Shelter Movement in
California, 1950-1969," at the University Art Museum at UC Santa
Barbara, examines Cold War bomb shelters in societal, art and
architecture contexts, incorporating plans and renderings along with
fallout-related civil defense material and pop culture items. This is
more than campy retro design.</LD>
<LD>   "I wanted this to be a social art history," says exhibition
curator Elizabeth Kathleen Mitchell, a UCSB doctoral candidate in art
and architectural history. Mitchell incorporated pieces from the
university's Architecture and Design Collection archives, as well as
from the Conelrad Collection, owned by a Los Angeles-based Web site
dedicated to all things Atomic Age. "The material could have been
used in a lot of directions, but I was really interested in the
fallout shelter because of all the connections about gender and
structuring identities, and the idea that it was up to the individual
to build these. It wasn't a general program like retrofitting for
earthquakes; people had to take the initiative."</LD>
<TE>   In a small gallery inside this recently renovated on-campus
museum, Mitchell has assembled plans and renderings of bomb shelter
designs by respected Southern California architects Paul Laszlo,
Robert B. Stacy-Judd and Jim Charlton, as well as pulp novels, civil
defense brochures and a movie poster. However comic some of them seem
today in their "Armageddon is just around the corner" sensibility,
such shelters--some of which still exist--serve as a stark reminder
of how pervasive the fear of a nuclear attack on American soil was a
half-century ago and how much it influenced myriad aspects of
Americans' lives. Although the exhibition was conceived a year ago,
it's impossible not to draw parallels between then and now, as
phrases like "axis of evil" and "weapons of mass destruction" again
become part of the vernacular.</TE>
<TE>   "The verdict isn't in," says Kurt Helfrich, curator of the
university's Architecture and Design Collection, which contributed
several pieces to the show. "We're still living with the possibility
of nuclear destruction, and I believe that living with that threat
does change the kind of optimism and progressive thinking that had
gone before. How we've incorporated that into our culture is really
important to understand."</TE>
<TE>   The Laszlo shelter sketches are part of the architect's greater
vision, called "Atomville USA," which he envisioned as a planned
community incorporating underground structures connected by cable
cars. While trying to sell the idea to the military to use for
housing, he was commissioned to build a shelter for a private
residence in Woodland Hills. A black-and-white photograph from the
era shows a group of schoolchildren happily descending into the
backyard structure.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell points out the care taken by the Hungarian-born Laszlo,
known for his glamorous, luxurious style, to make the structures not
only efficient, but aesthetically pleasing as well--the same care he
put into homes for celebrities such as Cary Grant and Barbara
Stanwyck. She explains how rooting through the university's
architectural archives for Atomic Age design turned up a surprise--a
wealth of information on bomb shelters.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd been going through all these plans for commercial buildings,
and some homes, and it was so jarring to see a lot of the same
considerations taken for those as for streamlined living
underground," Mitchell says, noting that Laszlo's renderings include
such survivalist musts as a drip coffeemaker and a telephone.
"Building codes for bomb shelters were not in place yet in L.A.
county, but in his materials Laszlo was assuring people that the
shelters would just be used for emergencies. But in other materials
you'd see things like, 'If the bomb never drops, you can use the
shelter as an extra room for guests, or storage, or another
entertaining area!'"</TE>
<TE>   Laszlo (1900-1993) also had a career designing textiles and
furniture, along with commercial and residential buildings. He tried
to market his bomb-proof quarters to the government without luck,
Mitchell says. A letter from the Federal Civil Defense Administration
declines his petition to attend a nuclear test program in Las Vegas
to gather information before building his shelters.</TE>
<TE>   Stacy-Judd (1884-1975) was a London-born architect who lived in
Southern California; he designed commissioned shelters that showed
influences of the Mayan and pre-Columbian architecture he loved (he
designed the famed Aztec Hotel in Monrovia).</TE>
<TE>   "These drawings reflect his mind-set," she says of his rigidly
structured underground dwellings. "You can still see his interest in
patterning. Laszlo was very glossy and glamorous, but Stacy-Judd was
very nuts and bolts. It made sense to him to draw in every steel beam
where it was needed."</TE>
<TE>   Shelters represented more than squeezing a family of four into a
small space underground. They divided the haves and the have-nots,
says Mitchell: "There are themes about quality of living in all of
these renderings, which obviously was a big consideration if you had
enough money to commission a professional architect." While a shelter
could be improvised from anything--a basement to a car buried in the
backyard--she was only interested in the designed shelters "as a
reflection of class and consumption."</TE>
<TE>   These dwellings also gave rise to "shelter mentality," pitting
neighbor against neighbor when homeowners considered who they'd take
underground, and who they'd leave behind. The phenomenon also,
according to Mitchell, cemented stereotypical gender roles.</TE>
<TE>   An illustrated poster with "Protect Them!" in large type depicts a
quintessential 1950s-era mother comforting her cowering children. "It
was obviously directed at the father, who was in charge of protecting
his family. It kind of created this very rigid social and sexual
identity," Mitchell says, with mother as nurturer and father as
builder and protector. "The government was telling you how to behave.
It was naturalizing these rigid roles as people were living under the
gun all the time. Everybody had to know their role, or they'd die."</TE>
<TE>   A display of pulp novels reveals titles like "The Day They
H-Bombed Los Angeles" and "Tomorrow!," with a cover showing a shapely
woman barely holding onto her tattered clothes, blown off by a
nuclear blast. An original poster for the 1955 film "Creature With
the Atomic Brain" reads: "Terror true to science, based on laboratory
experiments described in national magazines!" and depicts a scary
zombie-being whose brain has been replaced with atomic matter. A
listening station enables visitors to hear civil defense instructions
on how to stock and live in a fallout shelter.</TE>
<TE>   These items are courtesy of Conelrad, whose Web site
(www.conelrad.com) offers a plethora of Cold War culture bites,
including films, civil defense material and some original research
done by site founders Ken Sitz, Curtis Samson and Bill Geerhart.
Sitz, 50, says he remembers "duck and cover" drills in school and
finds the era, which he calls "the golden age of homeland defense,"
fascinating because "it's a key to so many other things. I'm
particularly interested in music of that era, and obviously the
society really changed after World War II.... We're trying to do a
lot of first-hand research. It's not hard to talk to people who lived
it--Bill tracked down a couple who spent their honeymoon in a fallout
shelter. A lot of companies that built swimming pools got into
shelter building because they had the equipment. The problem was
financing."</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell and Sitz warn against drawing too many parallels between
nuclear destruction fears then and now: "Because we don't have that
much experience in the 20th and 21st centuries in feeling threatened
at home, the two are easy to equate," Mitchell points out. "But the
conditions are different. Now we're more inclusive in defining
Americans--it doesn't matter where you came from. Then, America was
America if you were white and Protestant."</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell hopes students born after the age of fallout shelters and
atomic zombie sci-fi films will see the exhibition and "think about
the fact the way we respond to threats and differences is not
natural, it's naturalized for you by materials like the civil defense
brochures. People didn't get up in the morning and think, 'Well, I'd
better build a bomb shelter to protect my family.' It was imposed on
them very clearly and reasonably by the government. It's propaganda.
And people don't think critically about propaganda. They're not
thinking critically about it today."</TE>

<LD>UNDRESSING THE MOON</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   By T. Greenwood</LD>
<TE>   St. Martin's</TE>
<TE>   256 pages; $23.95</TE>
<TE>   Rarely has a writer rendered such highly charged topics as
maternal abandonment, rape and the prospect of premature death to so
wrenching, yet so beautifully understated, an effect. In her third
work of fiction, "Undressing the Moon," author T. Greenwood takes on
risky subject matter, handling her volatile topics with admirable
restraint.</TE>
<TE>   Piper Kinkaid adores her artist mother, a woman who takes great
pleasure in working with bits of bright-colored glass, but cannot
endure her marriage to Piper's unsympathetic father. And despite her
attachment to her children, she leaves the family.</TE>
<TE>   Greenwood's protagonist, 14-year-old Piper, is devastated by the
loss of her mother, a woman whose artistic sensibilities had always
especially enchanted her young daughter. But if this loss were not
devastating enough, Piper's father soon takes up with a violently
unstable woman, leaving the care of his daughter almost entirely to
her older brother Quinn.</TE>
<TE>   Greenwood achieves a somber, unsensational tone by staying close
to her protagonist's interior life, as we are let into Piper's lonely
ponderings about her mother and how she will carry on without her.
Piper pursues music and is soon taken on as something of a protege by
her school's music teacher, Mr. Hammer, a lonely widower.</TE>
<TE>   But even the steady-seeming Mr. Hammer proves fallible and his
involvement with Piper ultimately causes the girl further pain. Mr.
Hammer's initial solicitous attention causes Piper to feel deeply
noticed, cared for: "He picked up his hands and looked at me. When he
smiled, I noticed that his bottom teeth were a little crooked. I also
noticed the faintest dimple in his left cheek. He could easily have
been a boy instead of a man.</TE>
<TE>   "'No, you don't need to sing today. I'm just listening to you
breathe. It helps me to figure out where to begin.'</TE>
<TE>   "I thought about breathing, and coughed. He handed me a glass of
water, which I accepted.</TE>
<TE>   "After I went home, I lay down on my bed, closed my eyes, and
listened to myself breathe. I'd never paid attention before, to the
rhythms of my breath. It seemed strange to me, that he was sitting
there the whole time, listening to something I didn't even know I was
doing. It felt as if he'd overheard my dreams."</TE>
<TE>   Greenwood intercuts the beginning narrative set during Piper's
adolescence with sequences from the character's adult life. At the
age of 30, Piper learns that she has advanced breast cancer. While a
common-enough literary strategy, Greenwood handles the back-and-forth
movement in time with wonderful deftness. She manages to keep Piper's
voice both consistent with the past and changed, reflecting a new
maturity and a deeper, more resonant sadness. In these sections,
Piper's emotional world, becomes more distressingly layered. This
despite her ongoing relationships with Quinn, her aunt Boo and her
old and dear friend Becca, who has come to take care of her. For
Piper must face the likelihood of her own early death.</TE>
<TE>   Yet drama never descends into melodrama. Piper quickly learns that
in accepting help from loved ones, she must also spare them in small
and not so small ways. With encouragement from Becca, Piper tries a
new anticancer drug, but soon finds the Tamoxifen is not working, a
fact she withholds from her friend. Deciding that her next task must
be to organize her life, Piper begins with the easier parts:</TE>
<TE>   "We lie to each other to save each other, and we keep some secrets
to save ourselves. So when I open the door of my closet and walk in,
through the sleeves of summer dresses and boxes of letters and
collected things, I tell her I'm only spring cleaning. That the
sunshine and blue sky have inspired me to organize my life."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately more about life than death, "Undressing the Moon"
beautifully elucidates the human capacity to maintain grace under
unrelenting fire.</TE>

<LD>   Gardeners in warmer areas from Pasadena to Santa Ana can plant
early varieties of tomatoes toward the end of the month. 'Early
Girl,' the best known, will produce into August. Coastal gardeners
can also try this but only if they have a warm, south-facing spot out
of ocean breezes.</LD>
<LD>   Continue planting winter crops including beet, broccoli, carrot,
cauliflower, curly endive, kale, head and leaf lettuce (and any other
salad green), onion, pea, potato, radish, spinach, Swiss chard and
turnip.</LD>
<TE>   Fertilize citrus and avocados near the end of the month by
sprinkling a granular fertilizer under the trees and a few feet
beyond the outermost branches. Rains or irrigation will carry the
fertilizer to the roots.</TE>

<LD>Winter trees: Are they alive?</LD>
<LD>   Many trees lose all their leaves in the fall. These trees are
called "deciduous" and include many fruit trees, flowering ornamental
trees, maple trees, some oak trees, liquidambars and others. Even
though they have lost all their leaves, they are still alive; they
are just "dormant." Dormancy in plants is something like hibernation
for animals--the tree is resting, slowing down food production, and
living on stored nutrients through the winter.</LD>
<LD>   How can you tell if a tree is dormant or dead?</LD>
<TE>   Find a bare tree in your yard or neighborhood and look at its
branches and twigs very closely. What do you notice?</TE>
<TE>   Are the twigs flexible and easily bent, or are they dry and
brittle? What color are the twigs at the ends of the branches? Are
they different than the rest of the branch; maybe greenish, or
lighter brown, or even reddish? Flexibility of the twig and a
different color from the branch are signs that the tree is still
alive.</TE>
<TE>   Now look very closely along the length of the twigs. Do you see
any little bumpy things sticking out from the twigs? They might be
brown or red or green. These are buds. Again, they are signs that the
tree is alive. Look at the buds through a magnifying lens. You may
see a "skin" covering each bud, protecting the tender new growth
inside.</TE>
<TE>   Ask yourself these questions: What is the tree waiting for? What
is going to happen next? Watch your tree in the days and weeks ahead
and you will see new growth emerging--tiny leaves, flowers, perhaps
more twigs. What do you think will emerge first? Leaves or flowers?
Is it the same for all trees?</TE>
<TE>   Arbor Day is a day dedicated to planting trees. It began in
Nebraska in 1872 with the planting of 1 million trees. California
celebrates Arbor Day during the week of March 8-15. National Arbor
Day is the last Friday in April. You may want to celebrate by
planting a family tree in your yard and watching it grow along with
you. To find out more about Arbor Day, visit www.arborday.org. You
can learn more about trees and many other plants at Descanso Gardens.</TE>

<HD>An Eye for Beauty That Works</HD>
<DH>Ross Lovegrove's creations can't just sit around and be
pretty. They've got to do the job.</DH>

<LD>British industrial designer Ross Lovegrove takes a simple, practical
approach to his work. "Everything I design, I experience. People ask
me how I can create such a variety of things--aircraft interiors,
chairs, bottles, spoons, sunglasses. I can because I have an opinion
about them based on my experience using them."</LD>
<LD>   He has designed and/or collaborated on a notable list of products,
including the Walkman for Sony and computers for Apple. He worked as
an in-house designer for Knoll International in Paris and lately has
become known for his curvilinear Go chair for Bernhardt Design,
introduced last year.</LD>
<LD>   "I think everything should look beautiful and work," he said this
week, while in town to introduce one of his latest ventures, the TAG
Heuer eyewear collection. "I've developed a position within the world
of organic design based on wonderful forms. I love wonderful, fluid
forms, and I think everyone does. After all, there's not a straight
line on a human being."</LD>
<TE>   TAG Heuer, the Swiss watch company, allowed Lovegrove a great deal
of flexibility in the design process, he says. "It took three years,
with the first six months spent just looking at the shapes of
people's faces. I had to get very analytical. With anything that fits
on the body, you have to take a deep view of it, since it becomes a
part of you." The detail he likes best is not one of style but of
providing comfort to the wearer: "I'm particularly happy with the
adjustable nose pad. These glasses can fit faces everywhere in the
world."</TE>
<TE>   Made from high-pressure injection-molded metal, Lovegrove's
sunglasses are sleek and sculptural. His materials include titanium,
magnesium and aluminum. "The outside is very flat because it is away
from your body. Where a material comes near the body, it's organic.
So you have an inside/outside. All my work has that, although I don't
really talk about it. It's just there. It's a gesture to the human
being," he says. Retail prices for the glasses range from $200 to
$400; they are available at Optical Fashion Center in Beverly Hills,
Maison d'Optique in Studio City and Occhiali Fine Eyewear in
Montecito, near Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, Lovegrove joined the design consortium Atelier de
Nimes in France, working with hotel and furniture designer Philippe
Starck and architect Jean Nouvel. There he served as a design
consultant to Louis Vuitton, Cacharel, Dupont and Hermes.</TE>
<TE>   Returning to London In 1990, he established his own firm, Studio
X, and has since won many awards, including the 2000 ID Good Design
award. He was nominated 2001 Designer of the Year from Architekture &amp;
Wohnen, Hamburg, and his work is included in numerous museum
collections, among them the Museum of Modern Art in New York and
London's Design Museum.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Fiell, London-based co-author of "Designing the 21st
Century" (Taschen, 2001), calls Ross one of the "most important
designers working right now. He has pioneered a new language of
design, which can be described as organic essentialism. This approach
involves the development of holistic and very pure solutions that
provide the most with the least."</TE>
<TE>   Or, as Lovegrove says, there is no fat on his designs. Case in
point is the Go chair, which retails for just under $600 and is
manufactured by North Carolina-based Bernhardt furniture makers. The
chair's use of injection-molded magnesium marks the first time the
die-cast material has been used in furniture.</TE>
<TE>   "We had so much trust in Ross' vision that the design brief for
the chair was a verbal one, made over lunch in London," Jerry
Helling, executive vice president of Bernhardt Design, says. "All we
asked was that the chair have arms and that it should be big enough
to accommodate Americans. The response to the chair has been much
stronger than we had ever anticipated. Ross has an incredible mind
and can envision things that most people have never even considered."</TE>
<TE>   The Go chair has quickly become a design icon and is illustrated
on the cover of Fiell's book. "It is a truly 21st century chair,"
Fiell says. "Ross is materials-led and a risk taker. What I mean by
this is that he pushes materials, technology, function and often
aesthetics to the absolute limit in his search for groundbreaking
product solutions."</TE>
<TE>   Lovegrove has also created his version of the ubiquitous water
bottle in a blow-molded bottle design made from organic materials for
Ty Nant, a water company in Wales. "They're calling this the Coke
bottle of the 21st century," he says. "Other water bottles are
designed to fit the machine in the factory, the truck that transports
it and storage. They're not designed for your table or for your hand.
My bottle is more Leonardo da Vinci's water studies meet Issey
Miyake. That just shows you can elevate the standard of our culture
with anything, even a bottle of water."</TE>
<TE>   Because of Lovegrove's concern with ecology--which has also led
him to design solar energy products--the organic properties of his
water bottle are nearly as important as the aesthetic ones. "I try to
deliver a level of honesty in what I do, and with that comes a
beauty," he says. "I think that in the future our things are going to
become much more honest. We have to become more environmental. There
is a kind of moral responsibility involved. If you're taking a
material out of the planet, you should make something of good quality
with high value, intellectually and aesthetically. And if you do, you
define our culture. That's why I'm a designer, because that's how I
see it."</TE>

<HD>The Otherwhere Ice Show</HD>
<DH>Part 4 The story so far: Molly is about to skate the part
of Cinderella in the Otherwhere Ice Show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GAIL KIMBERLY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Magnus stood in the center of the ice. "Ladies and gentlemen,
creatures of all ages," he announced. "Welcome to the Other- where
Ice Show." He waved his whip. The invisible band played a march, and
10 small horses with riders appeared from the trees to circle the
pond. The horses danced on their hind legs while the riders clasped
hands. But were these men riding horses, or were they centaurs--part
horse, part man? But centaurs were myths. They didn't exist.</LD>
<LD>   The centaurs galloped away, and little clowns in greasepaint with
tattered clothes and clumsy shoes ran onto the ice. They tumbled and
fought and fumbled and fell while the crowd laughed. After they had
performed, small acrobats swung from the tree branches on tiny
trapezes. But all their faces were unhappy, and it made Molly sad
watching them.</LD>
<LD>   Then Magnus came toward her, his green eyes glowing. "Your turn,
Cinderella!"</LD>
<TE>   The crowd was cheering. Yelps and growls, whistles and howls
mingled with the music of her Cinderella theme. Magnus took Molly's
hand and led her to the center of the ice. "Don't be nervous," he
whispered. "Remember, my magic will help you do it."</TE>
<TE>   Molly glided to the fireplace where the little wicked stepmother
and the ugly sisters waited. She grabbed a broom and skated around
them, sweeping. The three women knew the play as well as she did.</TE>
<TE>   The sets miraculously appeared and disappeared. Their costumes
changed into ball gowns as the stepmother and sisters left for the
palace, and a tiny fairy godmother came to turn Cinderella into a
princess and produce a coach and four dog-sized horses.</TE>
<TE>   Molly skated better than she ever had, leaping into graceful spins
as the spectators applauded wildly. When she got to the palace she
found that Magnus himself was the prince, and when he danced with
her, she glowed with happiness.</TE>

<TE>   Friday: Molly learns a lesson.</TE>

<TE>   Gail Kimberly lived in Ottawa, Canada, where she learned to skate.
But she never could do the double axel. This story will be on The

<HD>Get Over It, Mr. Mayor</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The private grudge Mayor James K. Hahn denies that he nurses against
Gov. Gray Davis and the state Democratic Party seems to have gone
public last weekend. Hahn's schedule, his handlers said, was just too
packed to play host to a state party convention in his own city. Oh,
please.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn understandably seethed when Davis campaigned for his opponent
and fellow Democrat, Antonio Villaraigosa, in last year's nonpartisan
mayoral race. The Democratic Party not only endorsed Villaraigosa but
spent hundreds of thousands of dollars campaigning on his behalf.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn won anyway. Now his job as mayor requires cultivating good
relationships with state and national leaders, not snubbing them.</LD>
<TE>   When a gaggle of mayors gathered in Sacramento last fall to
announce their support for the governor's reelection bid, Hahn was
conspicuously absent. Fine. Who Hahn endorses is his business. But it
was not good for Los Angeles when the city's mayor passed up the
chance to hobnob last weekend with state leaders, not to mention
national party leaders including Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle
(D-S.D.) and Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.).</TE>
<TE>   Mayors need good lines of communication with Congress if they hope
to influence national legislation that affects cities and keep the
pipeline open for federal grants. A mayor's relationship with
California government is even more important, given the role the
state plays in allocating tax revenue for local services
or--worse--in taking money away. With California facing a slumping
economy and a $12.4-billion deficit this year, Los Angeles could lose
tens of millions of dollars for city housing, libraries and park
projects.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn has not always been so heedless of these vital relationships.
In November, he invited the 26 state legislators who represent the
Los Angeles area to discuss budget issues and the city's post-Sept.
11 security plan. It was, astoundingly, the first time in memory a
Los Angeles mayor had held such a meeting, which is routine for other
cities and for Los Angeles County government.</TE>
<TE>   In December, Hahn joined Davis for a press conference announcing
the state's contribution to the purchase of an old Union Pacific rail
property, Taylor Yard, which the city plans to turn into a park. Hahn
thanked Davis and even praised him as a "great governor."</TE>
<TE>   He needn't go that far. But the city could use more of this kind
of statesmanship and less of last weekend's politicking.</TE>

<HD>Yucca Mountain of Nuclear Waste</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Nuclear Dump in Nevada Gets Bush OK," Feb. 16: President Bush
states that the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste site should be approved,
based in part on Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham's recommendation
that it is "technically suitable" and "the science behind this
project is sound." To what "sound science" is he referring, since
study of the area is not complete?</LD>
<LD>   In 1992, a 5.6-magnitude earthquake caused $400,000 damage to the
Energy Department's office at the Yucca Mountain study site. Although
favored by the nuclear industry as a depository, Yucca Mountain is in
a volcanic area crossed by 34 fault lines and perched over a huge
aquifer. In addition, Nevada is the third most seismically active
state after California and Alaska.</LD>
<LD>   When the issue is global warming, Bush concludes we need to move
slowly or that the science isn't sound, yet he rushes into approval
of a containment site for lethal nuclear fuel. This, coupled with
candidate Bush's promise to the voters of Nevada to not to approve
the use of Yucca Mountain unless it was deemed scientifically safe,
is one more instance of his clear loyalty to the energy industry over
the safety of Americans.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Once Discarded, Now Loved" (editorial, Feb. 18) touched my heart
very much. It amazes me that there are so many people out there who
actually care more about themselves than the little innocent children
who come out of them. I do understand that it might have been a
mistake for the woman or girl to get pregnant or that she doesn't
have the financial ability to support the child, but it gives her no
right to abandon the child. As you say, there are many other ways to
give up the baby.</LD>
<LD>   This country offers many different facilities to go to when in
need of help. Society has to teach our youngsters while they are
young, so they will learn and not take the wrong actions later on.
Yes, it is true that parenting is a difficult duty, but if you choose
to learn, it won't be so bad after all.</LD>
<LD>   Clara Mekasijian</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Society has not done enough to prevent the tragic abandonment of
babies. There are a growing number of incidents in which mothers dump
their babies into dumpsters. It is horrific that it happens, but the
way to solve the problem is not by publicizing the safe haven laws
(allowing delivery of newborns to hospitals without any questions
asked). There ought to be more publicity of birth control, condoms
and abstinence. Some of these may seem extreme, but if our society
really wants to stop the alarming increase of dumpster babies, then
extreme measures need to be taken into account.</TE>

<LD>Re "Prosecutor Apologizes for Misdeed," Feb. 14: The mild slap on the
wrist of L.A. County Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Duarte by L.A. County
Superior Court Judge Terry A. Green for altering key evidence during
a capital murder case leaves me shocked and dismayed. A $1,000 fine
for an offense so remarkably bad shakes my faith in the L.A. County
justice system.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>There is a simple way to improve the judging at amateur figure
skating events, and everyone in the skating world knows it
("Skating's New Gold Standard," Feb. 16). Just do what is done at
every professional meet. When the pros compete, the highest and
lowest scores are thrown out and the mark is the total of the
remaining scores. It's not a perfect solution but sure beats what
they have now.</LD>

<TE>   It never ceases to amaze me that we expect the Olympic athletes,
many of them mere children, to be honest and clean and truthful while
the adults indulge in every form of political, ethical and moral
chicanery. Aren't we supposed to be setting an example for them? If
there is anything left in this world that is not tainted by every
form of corruption imaginable, it should be the Olympics.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Airport Potential at John Wayne, El Toro</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Retain the El Toro Option" (editorial, Feb. 16), urging retention of
the El Toro airport for future use for commercial air traffic, pulls
the trigger without aiming. You miss the crux of the issue. With
Orange County 86% built out and the John Wayne Airport operating at
about half of its capacity in the hottest economy we have ever had,
we don't need any more capacity than already exists at JWA. Simply by
permitting existing flights to operate at their capacity and
upgrading a few of the smaller aircraft, JWA can handle Orange
County's needs into the future.</LD>
<LD>   All of the area growth will occur in Riverside and San Bernardino
counties, and they have three closed bases to upgrade to handle their
needs. You have been fooled by the power-mongers who want to gain
monetarily by cramming a huge 24-hour-per-day operation into the
middle of the best residential community in the U.S. They would turn
South Orange County into another Inglewood for their own profit and
to eliminate the hated JWA from the lives of the Newport Beach elite.</LD>
<LD>   Not while I have a breath left in me. The grass-roots volunteers
of South County will never give up this fight--and will prove once
and for all that votes count more than big money.</LD>
<TE>   Carl Schulthess</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The foes of the airport at El Toro love to point out that there is
still a large, unused capacity at John Wayne Airport. From this they
attempt to imply that John Wayne could handle future air traffic from
Orange County. To see how wrong they are, all one has to do is
examine why there is so much unused capacity at our local commercial
airport. You can't get anywhere from there. And if you can, it is
outrageously expensive.</TE>
<TE>   Case in point: Recently, I tried to make a reservation for my
mother-in-law--who lives in Leisure World--to fly to Fort Lauderdale,
Fla., to visit her granddaughter. From LAX I could find several
choices, including two nonstop flights and a one-stop flight with no
change of plane. The cost of the round-trip is a bit over $300. There
was an additional $55 for a round-trip van service from Leisure World
to LAX.</TE>
<TE>   From John Wayne Airport, the round-trip van fare was much less,
but the total travel time, including to and from the airport, was
considerably longer. In addition, the best connection required at
least one stop and a change in planes, with the ensuing delays. But
worst of all was the air fare. The cheapest flight cost more than
$1,600!</TE>
<TE>   Is it any wonder why our local airport has so much unused
capacity? There is no way to enlarge that airport to allow long-range
airplanes to fly out of there. So don't count on John Wayne to handle
our air traffic now or later.</TE>
<TE>   David Feign</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your editorial is apparently based on the premise that the demand
for air travel must increase inexorably into the future. Absent that
demand, the land could be put to those people-friendly uses that you
noted, such as parks, museums, etc., all of which would be far more
beneficial to residents than would yet another airport.</TE>
<TE>   The obvious solution to our ever-increasing air transportation
problem is a modern, efficient system of high-speed passenger rail,
which would provide a comfortable, convenient option-of-choice for
travel to destinations up to 600 miles or more away. Rail
transportation can be much more convenient, safe and environmentally
friendly while greatly reducing overall demand for air travel. As an
added bonus, the implementation of a high-speed rail system would
produce very significant job-creation and economic stimuli throughout
the nation.</TE>

<LD>Re "Americans Admire Bush's Tough Talk, Cheney Says," Feb. 19: In his
speech before an audience of Marines, Dick Cheney referred to "a
certain amount of hand-wringing in some quarters" regarding George W.
Bush's tough talk of an "axis of evil" consisting of Iran, Iraq and
North Korea. Speaking refreshingly from a disclosed location in front
of an audience ordered to attend, Cheney admirably shook and rattled
his vice-presidential saber.</LD>
<LD>   I wonder if it was with the same strong moral conviction and
forthrightness (and steady hands not being wrung) that Cheney avoided
military service.</LD>
<LD>   The two atop this administration seem to need a certain remove, a
comfortable distance, from which to cheer those who fight our
country's wars. Hey, every team needs its cheerleaders, whether
waving pompoms or swords, but the Bush-Cheney cheers are really for
the Carlyle team of military industrialists and the profit to be had
in the erection of a "Star Wars" boondoggle.</LD>
<TE>   The lessons of Enron are lost on Bush and Cheney: It simply is
wrong to sell out to the highest bidder and especially wrong when you
have taken an oath to serve the interests of the people rather than
of profit.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The practical reasons you cite for supporting death penalty reform,
wrongful convictions and high reversal rates, are compelling enough
("A Life-or-Death Reform," editorial, Feb. 14). But aside from
contradictory scriptural arguments ("an eye for an eye" versus
"vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord"), there is also the moral and
ethical question: How can the state denounce capital crime as
abhorrent and simultaneously embrace murder in the role of
executioner? Most other Western nations have long since answered that
double-standard question--it can't.</LD>
<LD>   Norman W. Nielsen</LD>
<LD>   Highland Park</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The death penalty is an ugly issue that we often gloss over, yet
one of such serious consequences that it should not disappear from
our dialogue. The proposed Innocence Protection Act, introduced by
Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), would provide for a more compassionate
response in helping to ensure that those given such a grave sentence
are truly guilty.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the bill does not go far enough: It does not repeal the death
penalty. There is a mountain of evidence that shows that the death
penalty does not deter crime. It also costs us all an incredible
amount of money to enforce, which is money that I would prefer to
spend on education or prevention. But most important, are we any
better than a criminal if we kill as well?</TE>

<HD>O'Connell Makes the Grade</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Voters have elected a state superintendent of public instruction
every four years since California adopted its Constitution in 1849.
That was long before candidates for governor, lieutenant governor and
nearly every other office fixated on education.</LD>
<LD>   By appointing their own cabinet-level education secretaries,
"Education Governor" Gray Davis and his predecessor, "Education
Governor" Pete Wilson, made the position redundant. This overlap
squanders money and diffuses responsibility and if Californians
really care about education, they'll demand that Sacramento address
the matter.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, since the nonpartisan office is on the March 5 ballot,
we endorse State Sen. Jack O'Connell, (D-San Luis Obispo) for state
superintendent. O'Connell is running against two women with good
ideas that the state cannot afford to ignore. Like O'Connell, State
Assemblywoman Lynne C. Leach (R-Walnut Creek) faces term limits in
the Legislature. Her $150,000 war chest, though respectable, falls
far short of the $1 million O'Connell has raised. The businesswoman
stands out for her proposals to run the state education department
like a business--complete with sound fiscal management.</LD>
<TE>   The most refreshing voice in the race belongs to Katherine H.
Smith, school board president of the Anaheim Union High School
District, who championed school uniforms long before the requirement
became popular and who advocated a moment of silence every
morning--not for school prayer, necessarily, but to encourage
students to settle down so teaching can begin. Smith, however, has
little name recognition outside of Orange County and not much money
in the bank.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connell has neither of those problems and, as a former high
school teacher who specialized in education during nearly two decades
as an assemblyman and senator, he has the perfect portfolio for the
job. Like most state Democrats, O'Connell is close to the California
Teachers Assn. But he demonstrated his independence when he supported
merit pay for teachers. He fought the burdensome two-thirds majority
needed to pass school bond measures. (The requirement is now 55%, a
margin most school districts can rally from voters.) He also wrote
legislation to reduce the size of classes to no more than 20 students
per teacher in the early grades--a reform that Republican Gov. Pete
Wilson correctly forced public schools to implement quickly over the
objections of the current state superintendent of public education,
Delaine Eastin. Indeed, O'Connell's ability to get along with both
Democrats and Republicans should make him more effective than Eastin
in dealing with any governor and the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the state superintendent has little power to act
unilaterally. The governor and Legislature set the state's budget.
The State Board of Education, approved by the governor, establishes
education policy. That said, Jack O'Connell wants the job, and voters
should give him a chance.</TE>

the one that occurred in Florida in November 2000. To make sure it
can't happen in the future, the Legislature has proposed a
$200-million bond issue to help counties buy new voting machines and
to retire punch card models.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal appears as Proposition 41 on the March 5 primary
election ballot, and we urge California voters to support it. Also
deserving a yes vote is Proposition 43, a Florida-spawned measure
that would write into the state Constitution a guarantee that every
citizen's vote will be counted as long as it is cast legally. Both
measures were put on the ballot by vote of the state Legislature.</LD>
<LD>   Sponsors say that 11.4 million of the state's 15.7 million
registered voters are in the handful of populous counties, including
Los Angeles County, that use a punch card system. Secretary of State
Bill Jones had ordered that these machines be retired by mid-2005.
More recently, a federal district judge ordered replacement before
the 2004 elections, making approval of the Proposition 41 bond funds
more urgent. The counties need help to pay for new machines, which
are a long-term capital investment suitable for a bond issue.</LD>
<TE>   The counties must put up $1 for every $3 they get from the state.
The state would also get some direct federal assistance under
legislation now before Congress. The three sources of funds should
just about cover the total estimated $367-million cost of replacing
the old machines.</TE>
<TE>   The counties can buy any system certified by the secretary of
state, primarily the ATM-like touch-screen models used successfully
in Riverside County or the optical-scan paper ballot system now used
in most other counties, which electronically reads the votes marked
on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 43 would write into the state Constitution the
guarantee that any vote cast according to law will be counted.
Sponsors say this would prevent a Florida-style situation in which
the recount of votes was halted midstream by state officials and the
courts. The measure may promise more with its high-toned rhetoric
than vote officials can produce, but it's worth a try. A companion
measure written into state law gives county election officials the
authority to request, and the courts the authority to grant,
extension of postelection deadlines to allow the full tabulation or
recounting of ballots.</TE>
<TE>   The Times urges voters to support both Propositions 41 and 43 on
March 5.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After slipping to second place on the national pop chart last week,
country singer Alan Jackson's "Drive" album is back on top after
selling an additional 184,000 copies, according to SoundScan.</LD>
<LD>   Jennifer Lopez's "J to tha L-0! The Remixes," which broke
Jackson's three-week reign last week by entering the chart at No. 1,
fell to No. 3 this week with sales of 134,000 copies. The collection
offers revamped versions of songs from her previous album, "J-Lo,"</LD>
<LD>   Though Jackson has been a star in the country field for more than
a decade, "Drive" is his first album to top the pop chart. One reason
for the album's success is the wide radio exposure for Jackson's hit
single "Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning)." The song
was written by Jackson in response to the terrorist attacks of Sept.
11.</LD>
<TE>   "Drive" has now sold almost 1.2 million copies since its release
five weeks ago, though it has a long way to go to match the 4.8
million sales of Jackson's 1995 "The Greatest Hits Collection."</TE>
<TE>   Creed's "Weathered", which has sold almost 4.5 million copies
since its release in November, jumped from fourth to second. Two
other albums returned to the Top 10: Puddle of Mudd's "Come Clean,"
which has sold almost 1.5 million since last summer, moved from No.
13 to No. 9, while Enrique Iglesias' "Escape," which has sold almost
2.1 million since last fall, moved up even more dramatically--from
No. 21 to No. 10.</TE>
<TE>   The other positions in the Top 10 are held, in order, by Linkin
Park, Nickelback, Ludacris, Barry Manilow and Pink. The nation's
best-selling single continues to be B2K's "Uh Huh."</TE>

<LD>   Peter Shaffer messes with the minds of audience and actors as he
plays with light and dark in his wacky farce "Black Comedy." It
begins in total darkness, but it's supposedly light for the cast.
When the lights come up on stage, it's because a blackout has just
occurred during a big bash at an artist's loft--and now the cast must
behave as if it is in the dark.</LD>
<LD>   "Black Comedy," Center Theater, 300 E. Ocean Blvd., Long Beach,
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 p.m. Ends March 17. $27 to
$35; opening night, $50 to $60. (562) 436-4610.</LD>

<TE>   No drugs will be prescribed. With the disclaimer that this is a
performance art event only, not bona fide therapy, performance
artists Paul Zaloom (a.k.a. "Beakman"), the Dark Bob, Marcus
Kuiland-Nazario, Johanna Went, Leigh Grode, Selene Luna and Stuart
Miller are putting on "Shrink," a "psychoanalysis marathon" that
offers audience members a 10-minute, improvised, one-on-one talking
encounter with the artist of their choice.</TE>
<TE>   "Shrink," Crazy Space, 1629 18th St., No. 2, Santa Monica, Friday
and Saturday at 8 p.m. Free. (310) 829-9789.</TE>

<TE>   all day Movies</TE>
<TE>   Robert Guediguian's "The Town Is Quiet" opens with a long pan over
the French port city of Marseille. The shot foreshadows the broad
scope of the film, which tells stories about characters rich and
poor, immigrant and nationalist, all dealing with a changing economy
and personal dramas. Ariane Ascaride stars.</TE>
<TE>   "The Town Is Quiet," opens Friday for one week at the Nuart, 11272
Santa Monica Blvd., West L.A. $6 to $9. (310) 478-6379.</TE>

<TE>   8pm Music</TE>
<TE>   Van Cliburn began his meteoric rise to fame in 1958 after winning
the gold medal at the First International Tchaikovsky Piano
Competition in Moscow. The honor garnered the Texas native a hero's
welcome upon returning stateside that included a full-blown
ticker-tape parade in New York. Cliburn's soloist skills will be on
display in Thousand Oaks when he joins the New West Symphony for a
special all-Tchaikovsky concert under the baton of Boris Brott.
Program: "Romeo and Juliet," Fantasy-Overture; Suite from "Swan
Lake"; Piano Concerto No. 1 in B flat minor.</TE>
<TE>   Van Cliburn, New West Symphony, Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza's
Kavli Theatre, 2100 E. Thousand Oaks Blvd., 8 p.m. $150-$200. (805)
497-5800. www.newwestsymphony.org.</TE>

<TE>   8pm Dance</TE>
<TE>   Although they hail from Philadelphia, Philadanco ain't no cream
cheese. Instead, look for this 30-year-old dance ensemble on the
cutting edge of African American movement expression. The current
tour repertory features Jawole Willa Jo Zollar's "Hand Singing Song"
and Bebe Miller's "My Science," two works from the company's daringly
politicized "Messages From the Heart" program. David Brown's "Labess
II" and Ronald K. Brown's "Exotica" prove more conventionally
celebratory but, fasten your seat belts: In this kind of vehicle the
dancers become what an L.A. Times review called "the ultimate,
inexhaustible speed demons of modernism."</TE>
<TE>   Philadanco, Marsee Auditorium, El Camino College, 16007 Crenshaw
Blvd., Torrance. 8 p.m. $23 and $26. (310) 329-5345. Also Saturday at
8 p.m. and Sunday at 7 p.m. in Campbell Hall, UC Santa Barbara
campus, Santa Barbara. $16 (students) to $25. (805) 893-3535.</TE>

<TE>   The biggest-selling album of 2001 wasn't from one of pop's
established names--it's the debut album from Linkin Park, a Los
Angeles band whose mix of crunching rock, rap and electronics forms a
vibrant, aggressive tapestry. With "Hybrid Theory" just past the
6-million sales mark, the group is headlining its "Projekt:
Revolution" tour.</TE>

almost 20 of last year's films, including "Moulin Rouge," "The Lord
of the Rings," "The Princess Diaries," "Gosford Park" and "Ocean's
Eleven." As part of this 10th anniversary exhibition, the institute

She went on to become the first African American homesteader in L.A.,
a midwife and a founder of the First African Methodist Episcopal

<TE>   8pm Comedy</TE>
<TE>   Here's honesty in comedy for you: When Team Uncabaret--Greg Miller
and Beth Lapides--put together the lineup for the final evening of
the Comedy Project 2002, they pretty much said, "Who's free on the
23rd?" The result is an eclectic bill of writers, actors, music types
and a chef. But they'll all be within their realm of expertise in
this show, titled "If There's One Thing I Know...." Comedians Taylor
Negron, Carol Leifer, Patton Oswalt and Jay Kogen will be joined by
writer Bruce Wagner, restaurateur Mary Sue Milliken, DJ Chris
Douridas and rocker Ray Manzarek.</TE>
<TE>   "If There's One Thing I Know ," Skirball Cultural Center, 2701 N.

<TE>   8pm Dance</TE>
<TE>   Beware of blisters from tapping your toes, because vintage
recordings by the likes of Frank Sinatra, Nat "King" Cole, Duke
Ellington, the Andrews Sisters and Billie Holliday offer an
irresistible trip to nostalgia heaven all by themselves. Add
choreography by New York's William Soleau and San Francisco's Robert
Sund, plus dancing by Santa Barbara's up-and-coming State Street
Ballet, and you have "Ballroom: A Salute to the Swing Era," the kind
of evening guaranteed to leave everyone except champion Lindy hoppers
weak in the knees. Can ballet dancers swing while on their toes?
Don't ask, just look.</TE>

<LD>   Reclusive singer-guitarist J.J. Cale is identified with the Tulsa,
Okla., music scene that produced him and such early '60s cohorts as
Leon Russell, but Cale's show at the Roxy is a homecoming of sorts.
During a mid-'60s L.A. sojourn, the musician was a regular at the
Roxy's sister club, the Whisky a Go-Go. So, who knows, maybe among
his songs, including the Eric Clapton hits "After Midnight" and
"Cocaine," he'll work in a tune from his 1966 album "Take a Trip Down
Sunset Strip."</LD>
<LD>   J.J. Cale, with David Lindley &amp; Wally Ingram, the Roxy, 9009 W.
Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood, 8 p.m. $19.50. (310) 278-9457.</LD>

performed in a single day as a benefit for the New York State WTC
Relief Fund. Among the more than two dozen stage and screen actors
participating are Christine Lahti, Donovan Leitch and Mary
Steenburgen. Writers include Bruce Vilanch and John Belluso;
directors are Morgan J. Freeman, Neil Pepe and Mike Uppendahl.</TE>

<TE>   When John Williams writes a theme, it's big. Think of Darth
Vader's anthem, the menacing bass of "Jaws," the wrenching strains
from "Schindler's List." His own 70th birthday is getting similarly
dramatic treatment, with the Los Angeles Philharmonic and cellist
Yo-Yo Ma providing the muscle. The program opens with a musical
tribute to the prolific composer, and includes seven entries from
Williams' extensive catalog, including excerpts from "Rosewood" and
"Angela's Ashes."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Philharmonic, John Williams and Yo-Yo Ma, Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion, 135 N. Grand Ave., downtown L.A., 1:30 p.m. $20 to

<LD>Went to see Too Rude at the Key Club and color me bad! The last time
I saw hips sway like that I was watching Elvis in "Blue Hawaii."
Frontman Roby Rogers holds nothing back and his punked-up reggae is a
blast of fresh air. The band's new album, "Reinvention," is due out
this spring.... Checked in on Otep at the Viper Room last week and
found the ferocious singer's rage fully intact. We need to recruit
her for the war effort: Her howl would scare anyone out of a cave....
Mi amigo Slim Jim Phantom, the Stray Cats drummer turned Cat Club
owner, tells me his 13-year-old son has teamed up with Billy Idol's
kid to form a band. Look out!</LD>
<LD>   I'm completely bowled over by Avoid One Thing, the solo project
from Mighty Mighty Bosstones bassist Joe Gittleman. It takes a big
man to wear his lyrical heart on his sleeve .... Shot pool with
Tattooed Tony at the Shamrock Social Club on the Sunset Strip and got
flashed by a fireman. Seriously, a firetruck turned its spotlight on
the window of the new tattoo parlor. Turns out, it was just a client
of tattoo artist Mark Mahoney's saying howdy.</LD>
<LD>   Tried to catch L.A. Guns at the Viper Room last week but got
waylaid by the Bullet Boys. If that singer doesn't get a makeover,
I'm gonna lose it, man.... I'm strapping on my bouncing soles to see
the Bouncing Souls at the House of Blues Saturday. Their song, "True
Believers," is a huge underground anthem.</LD>
<TE>   Thanks to bluesman Aidan Pickering, the Pelican Pie guitarist who
helped me get my hands on the hit European import, "Harry's Bar," by
55-year-old Gordon Haskell, the original bassist for King Crimson.
Last time I was so moved by something so quiet, I was listening to
Leon Russell in my parents' basement.</TE>

<HD>Firefly Brightens Up the Valley Scene</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>HEIDI SIEGMUND CUDA</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They couldn't give Smokin' Johnnie's away. The Studio City venue,
with the motto "Booze, Blues and Barbecues," never quite took off,
and last year its owners courted dozens of Hollywood clubbers to take
over the venue on Ventura Boulevard. Nobody would touch it. Studio
City, you may recall, is located in the Valley, where Hollywood club
impresarios fear to tread.</LD>
<LD>   That was before Jeffrey Best got his hands on the restaurant. The
owner of Best Events--a party planning company that throws
high-profile Hollywood events--Best transformed the scrappy blues
club into Firefly, a dreamboat bar and restaurant.</LD>
<LD>   In a mere four weeks and exclusively by word of mouth, Firefly has
become a meeting place of choice for Hollywood scenesters and their
brethren--hipsters who live in Silver Lake, Los Feliz and even the
Westside.</LD>
<TE>   Clubland folks have been trying to colonize the Valley for years
with little success. But Best seems to have the genes to make tough
situations work. His father and uncles ran nightclubs in the '40s and
'50s, when it was a bit like the Wild West. Best said that if
gangster Mickey Cohen walked into your club and told you he was a
partner--like he did at the Slapsy Maxie, which Best's father and
uncles ran--suddenly you were in business with the mob.</TE>
<TE>   Best's finishing school was on Fairfax Avenue in the 1990s at a
hipster eatery called Olive. He worked as general manager and maitre
d' at the now-closed restaurant. He's had success as a partner of
such venues as Daddy's, Vine, Dominick's, Red and Habana in Orange
County, and built a successful catering business. But conquering the
Valley, that's an entirely different battle. "Everyone told me I was
crazy to do business here," Best says of his new Studio City venture.
"But I kept thinking, we're two miles from the center of the world.
How far off could I be?"</TE>
<TE>   Turns out, he was right on the money.</TE>
<TE>   Firefly is veiled by overflowing ivy, just a few blocks east of
Laurel Canyon Boulevard; the only giveaway is a brisk valet parking
business. The entrance looks like the study of a rich client in a
1940s detective movie; visualize Bogie in "The Big Sleep." The bar by
the entrance is fiery red, and is flavored by more than a dash of
'40s noir. It's sexy and simple, and people recline on comfy cushions
surrounded by three walls of loaded bookshelves. The room is so dark,
Angelenos aren't likely to become more literate here, but at least
they've got options. Firefly's best feature, a fire pit in the middle
of the restaurant area, makes the whole indoors super-cozy.</TE>
<TE>   But Firefly has an interesting duality. Its red, inferno-like
entrance gives way to a white-hot patio with cabana-like tables
enclosed by drapes. Guests can draw the curtains and smooch, but most
people prefer to take a look around.</TE>
<TE>   Each time I've been there, the music's slammin', with deejays
offering sublime mixes of soul and ambient sounds. The coed bathrooms
add a bit of titillation; you really never know who you might be
washing your hands next to.</TE>
<TE>   For Best, who was born in Hollywood but grew up in Encino,
Firefly's a homecoming of sorts. But it was his experience at Olive
in the early '90s that shaped his vision, and he even pays homage to
it with a signature appetizer: fried olives.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd have multimillionaire producers sharing a beer with a
penniless writer, and everyone was happy to know each other," he
says. "It gave L.A. a neighborhood feel, and that's what we're trying
to capture here."</TE>

<LD>The once-flourishing Japanese enclave on Centinela Avenue south of
Washington Boulevard has dwindled over the years, but Sakura remains,
as it has for 50 years.</LD>
<LD>   Rather than declining, its business is booming. Friday lunches are
mobbed. Even on weekdays, there's a wait for tables at dinner. Janis
Toya and her husband, Sam Nitao, took over the restaurant three years
ago. The ambience is neighborly, not hip, and Toya, the hostess,
works hard at making customers happy.</LD>
<LD>   Friday lunch may be mostly a guy thing--the sort of guys you see
in TV ads for beer and pizza. One night, a little girl, not more than
6 or 7, sat at the sushi bar with her father while a large group took
over a row of tables for an informal banquet. The dress code is
casual--jeans, sweats, baseball caps.</LD>
<TE>   Sakura serves hearty, moderately priced combinations that appeal
to families, couples on dates, and all ages. Main dishes such as
sukiyaki or tonkatsu (pork cutlet) come with miso soup, salad,
tsukemono (pickles), rice and a choice of tempura or sashimi.</TE>
<TE>   A bento-box lunch combines two or three entrees, depending on what
you want to pay, with soup, salad, pickles, rice and tea.</TE>
<TE>   The dishes I liked best came from the appetizer list and the menu
posted beside the sushi bar--subtle, delicate food such as oshitashi,
which is blanched spinach formed into a tight roll and topped with a
shower of golden bonito flakes, and agedashi tofu--fried tofu in a
bowl of broth, topped with seaweed shreds and grated daikon.</TE>
<TE>   Hamachi kama--broiled yellowtail collar--comes with a bowl of
ponzu soy sauce for dipping. The meat is moist and sweet, chewier at
the narrow end of this bony cut. (Salmon collar tends to be rather
dry, though.)</TE>
<TE>   Baked scallop with dynamite sauce and mushrooms is strewn with
smelt roe, adding a staccato crunch to the creamy sauce. Green
mussels are fixed the same way.</TE>
<TE>   Mountain scallops are Japanese white mushrooms that look
surprisingly like sea scallops. The mushrooms are served sushi-style,
banded to rice with a strip of seaweed.</TE>
<TE>   Giant clam (geoduck) is chewy, delicate and almost sweet as sushi.
It also appears in a hot appetizer with mushrooms and asparagus,
flawed by a slight floury taste from whatever coated the slices.</TE>
<TE>   Get the fresh albacore sushi when available. The fish is naturally
sweet, so don't put soy sauce on it--the ponzu sauce under the rice
is all it needs. Yellowtail belly sushi is just as pleasing.</TE>
<TE>   Ume shiso roll is a salted plum wrapped in a shiso leaf, rather
salty unless you're an ume fan. The Philadelphia roll pairs raw
salmon and cream cheese. The Alaska roll caters to those who like
sushi-type dishes but not raw seafood, because the salmon is baked.
"Football" (inari) is a fried bean-curd pouch stuffed with rice; not
as dull as it sounds--it's sweet, as appealing as a candy snack.</TE>
<TE>   An earthen bowl holds tuna sumiso (tuna sashimi) flanked by
seaweed shreds, finely cut cucumber, daikon and a shiso leaf. The
sweet sauce is vinegar mixed with miso. Oysters are also served this
way or in shooters.</TE>
<TE>   Tempura (available as an appetizer or a main dish) is not this
restaurant's best dish. The first time I ordered it, the batter had a
stale taste, probably from the frying oil. The second time the flavor
improved, but the texture was less than crisp. The teriyaki here is
less interesting than saba shioyaki: broiled, lightly salted
mackerel.</TE>
<TE>   Spicy salad is far spicier than you would expect of Japanese food.
It's shredded lettuce tossed with cucumber, carrot, radish sprouts,
octopus, shrimp, sesame seeds, and a dressing that includes ponzu and
sesame oil.</TE>
<TE>   Yebisu, a Japanese beer that can stand up to these flavors, is
available, and so are green tea, wine and sake. The only dessert is
ice cream, plain or coated with mochi.</TE>

<HD>A Place to Waste Not, Want More Skewered Chicken</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>S. IRENE VIRBILA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In West Los Angeles the stretch of Sawtelle between Santa Monica and
Olympic boulevards is a truncated version of Little Tokyo where sushi
bars, karaoke parlors and shabu shabu joints jostle for space with
trendy teahouses and 2117, a French-Japanese cafe that's popular with
wine buffs because they can bring their own bottles.</LD>
<LD>   Just north of Olympic Boulevard, on the west side of street, a
tiny storefront is squeezed between two neon-bright strip malls. Look
for the large white cloth banner painted with a chicken in bold black
brushstrokes. That's the front of Yakitoriya, a tiny Japanese
restaurant specializing in yakitori, or skewered grilled meats. Here
the specialty is every part of the chicken.</LD>
<LD>   Duck your head under the door curtain, and you'll see 10 or so
tables and an L-shaped counter. Behind it is a single narrow grill a
few feet long and the span of a bamboo skewer wide. A young cook in a
baseball cap worn backward works the grill, turning the skewers with
a practiced hand, throwing salt onto the meat before he sets it over
the fierce heat of the Japanese hardwood charcoal.</LD>
<TE>   A glass case on top of the counter holds some of the skewers on
offer. Basically, it's almost any part of the chicken you can name at
$2 a stick, plus a choice of half a dozen vegetables threaded onto a
skewer and sashed with a strip of chicken. You can either order set
combinations at a slight discount, or skewer by skewer. Check the
specials posted on the wall, too, where you may find duck stick some
nights.</TE>
<TE>   Yakitoriya feels like so many such places in Japan, a dive
basically, but with great food. Everything is expertly grilled, the
breast and thigh especially succulent when the edges are charred from
the ferocious heat of the charcoal. I love the little gizzards
threaded on a skewer, but even better may be the heart, what the
Peruvians call anticucho. There are tender little chicken meatballs,
too, and chicken wings, even chicken skin and quail eggs.</TE>
<TE>   I could make a meal of the just the vegetables, especially the
sweet Japanese scallions, little green Japanese hot peppers and meaty
shiitake mushroom caps. Okra is a revelation grilled, because it
doesn't have any of the slimy quality that puts many people off this
interesting vegetable.</TE>
<TE>   At Yakitoriya it pays to eat earlier rather than later, as I found
out one night when I came in after 8. The kitchen was already out of
popular items such as the chicken breast and chicken skin. But I did
discover duck breast on the menu: It's probably half a breast grilled
and then sliced and fanned out on the plate the way the French do it,
and comes with a dab of hot mustard and a pinch of minced green
chiles moistened with yuzu. The combination is wonderful.</TE>
<TE>   To drink, there are several Japanese beers. I think Kirin's bitter
edge is ideal with the grilled chicken. I like the way the cooks pace
the meal at Yakitoriya, with each skewer coming separately snatched
right off the grill so you can appreciate its flavor. Savored this
way, it's astonishing how many skewers you can eat.</TE>
<TE>   Yakitoriya does one thing and does it very well. And there's
always room for more places like this in your restaurant repertoire.</TE>
<TE>   Yakitoriya, 11301 Olympic Blvd., No 101, Los Angeles; (310)
479-5400. Open Wednesdays through Mondays (closed Tuesdays) for
dinner only. Chicken and vegetable skewers, $2 each; grilled duck
breast, $7. Street or lot parking.</TE>

<HD>A Starry Smooth-Jazz 'Serenade'</HD>
<DH>Jeff Lorber, Ron Brown and others gather to celebrate a
children's enrichment program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Starlight Jazz Serenade" returned to the Leonard H. Goldenson
Theatre in North Hollywood on Tuesday night, the second annual event
celebrating Hands for Hope's efforts to provide academic, cultural
and social enrichment for children in the area.</LD>
<LD>   Once again, it drew a large crowd to hear a program packed with
performances by some of the stellar acts in the smooth-jazz universe.</LD>
<LD>   As in last year's presentation, saxophonists were prominent. The
muscular, Texas-based styles of Ron Brown and Everette Harp, arriving
in back-to-back sequence, were particularly impressive.</LD>
<TE>   Brown's playing was invested with a soaring, gospel quality
reflecting the deep spiritual commitment he noted in his
between-numbers comments.</TE>
<TE>   Harp, in his first live appearance of the year (he is working on a
new album), offered an especially powerful set of solo variations,
including one in which he added a wah-wah guitar-like sample to his
tenor saxophone to produce something reminiscent of a fiery, rock
guitar sound.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Koz was present, as well--if only for a jam-session closing
number with the Jeff Lorber group and Harp--serving up a solo
brimming with surprisingly effective blues licks.</TE>
<TE>   Keyboardist Kevin Toney's set was dominated by the forceful, often
dramatic chording that is his personal stock in trade, and the
lesser-known Uge Groove opened the evening with a stage-setting look
at the blues side of smooth jazz.</TE>
<TE>   Performing in the climactic star position, Lorber offered numbers
that were characteristically crisp and well-crafted. One of the
pioneers of the genre, he continues to display a knack for cranking
out catchy tunes enlivened by the sort of musical hooks that radio
programmers love. Unfortunately, his onstage presence recalled the
memory of Al Gore doing the Macarena.</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, despite all the star power, the headliners (who
donated their services) were nearly upstaged by two lesser-known
performers. Alto saxophonist Andre Roberson, a member of Lorber's
ensemble, played with a flair and inventiveness fully
matching--sometimes surpassing--the work of the saxophone giants on
the bill. He is clearly ready for his own solo career.</TE>
<TE>   And actress-author LaRita Shelby, host of the show, was even more
humorous and engaging than she was in last year's event, possibly
because in the interim she has written and published a book titled
"The Nature of a True Diva."</TE>

<HD>Amusements at the Pier</HD>
<DH>Old-fashioned fun comes at a modern price at Pacific Park.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALERIE J. NELSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From nine stories above the Santa Monica Pier, we have a
million-dollar view that takes in the Getty Center, the Palos Verdes
Peninsula and a guy scouring the beach with a metal detector. It
almost makes the $12 we spent for three minutes on the Ferris wheel
seem like a rent-control bargain. That is, it might, if my family
would bask in the scenery.</LD>
<LD>   "What else do you see?" I ask my husband.</LD>
<LD>   "I see the ocean, and it's awfully big," he says.</LD>
<TE>   My 10-year-old son slinks down in the gondola, trying not to dwell
on the fact that we're dangling more than 130 feet above the sea. My
14-year-old daughter is doing what she does best: needling her
brother.</TE>
<TE>   Eight revolutions later, "the world's first solar-powered Ferris
wheel" comes to a stop, and we step back into Pacific Park, billed
quite specifically as "the West Coast's only amusement park on a
pier." Except for all the bare midriffs, it's as if we've stepped off
a leisurely time machine that's revolved back to 1909, the year the
pier was built.</TE>
<TE>   With its 20 midway games and dozen rides, the park is an
old-fashioned experience. But it comes with a 21st century price tag.</TE>
<TE>   The park's not on the scale of a Disney adventure, in terms of
price or size. But the dollars can quickly add up. Tickets for rides
cost $1.50 apiece, and one ride can eat up as many as four tickets.
The park offers several deals that can bring down the price: A
20-ticket book for $20 and wristbands for unlimited rides for $8.95
or $15.95 (over 42 inches tall).</TE>
<TE>   Because the daredevil gene sprouts nowhere on our family tree and
about half the pier's rides are "for little kids," our medium-size
offspring don't want all-day wristbands. If they had deeper pockets,
maybe, but we've given each kid $15 to spend, and the hypnotic whir
of the pier's arcade is calling. We opt for a $20 ticket book, which
gets the four of us on seven rides and uses up $11 of the kids'
combined budget. The rest will be poured a quarter at a time into the
Playland Arcade during the two hours we'll spend at the pier.</TE>
<TE>   My daughter loses her stomach "once or twice" on the roller
coaster that goes 35 mph and wraps the 21/2-acre park. The bumper
cars give my son a generous six minutes to joyfully crash into other
drivers. He also considers playing midway games in the Pier Pressure
Zone, but the $2 required to fling one dart sends him straight to the
indoor arcade.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-year-old park's old-fashioned feel isn't an accident. "We
wanted things that were evocative of the past," says Stacy Glazer,
director of marketing for Pacific Park.</TE>
<TE>   About 3.5 million people visited the pier last year, says Mark
Samson, a spokesman for the Santa Monica Pier Restoration Corp.,
landlord for pier tenants. The pier's first amusement park dates to
the 1920s, but storms and changing tastes took their toll. In 1990, a
new concrete substructure allowed heavy-duty rides and restaurants to
be placed atop the pier.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a playground for the rich and famous from way back when,"
Samson says. "It has such a high-recognition factor. As sappy as this
may sound, it provides one of the nicest views in Southern
California."</TE>
<TE>   Sherry Hanover of West Los Angeles takes her two young children to
the pier at least once a month. "I grew up going to Atlantic City,"
she says. "It's a lot smaller than what Atlantic City offers, but it
feels like a retro pier. It's big enough to spend a couple of hours,
and we all love the carousel."</TE>
<TE>   And the cost? "If you compare it to a movie where you buy tickets,
popcorn and drinks," Hanover says, "it's comparable and it also lasts
about 90 minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Inside the Playland Arcade--still run by the Gordon family that
founded it in 1951--my son and daughter are busy playing some of the
200-plus games. They range from Skeeball and shooting hoops to the
truly weird Whac-a-Mole. Driving the kids' quest are the tickets they
win, which can be redeemed for surprisingly decent prizes.</TE>
<TE>   If I choose to believe owner Marlene Gordon's theory--and what
parent wouldn't?--my children are proving how smart they are. "You
have to be very bright to play these games," says Gordon, who was
born into the arcade business. "The kids are so mathematical and they
understand the games. They're practically geniuses."</TE>
<TE>   My boy wonder is obsessed with a machine called the Chocolate
Factory. He's spending 50 cents a pop to manipulate a crane to pick
up a candy bar, trying to set up a chain reaction that might push a
candy bar into his hand. He spends $3.50 for the thrill of winning a
good-size 3 Musketeers. I point out that a vending machine in the
arcade sells candy for 75 cents.</TE>

<LD>The singer, songwriter and bassist, whose last record was "Cutthroat
Standards and Black Pop," has played with Beck, Elastica, the Meat
Puppets and KMFDM.</LD>
<LD>   The Greatest Show on Earth: I like going to Makeup, where I often
play. It's the first Saturday of every month at the El Rey, and
there's a different theme each month. The thing I love about Makeup
is that even though I have played with some legitimate rock star-type
acts, Makeup feels more like when you're a child and you're playing
air guitar. It's got this really wonderful pretend quality to it that
I enjoy, and it's great for people-watching because everyone gets
really dressed up.</LD>
<LD>   Dark and Red: Taylor's on 8th and Normandie is one of my favorite
restaurants in L.A. It's an old steakhouse, and it's super good.
Usually, I order the London broil, which is the least expensive
entree and it's my favorite. It's got those old red vinyl booths with
the buttons in them. It reminds me of places that I used to go with
my grandparents when I was a kid, places that are no longer here.</LD>
<TE>   Yummy: Sometimes I go to Bar Marmont on Sundays. They have this
one drink, and I don't remember what it's called, but it's got vodka
and freshly cut mint leaves in it and they put sugar around the
edges. It's sort of like a lemon drop but minty. It's like candy.
It's so yummy. And the whole place starts to smell like mint because
a lot of people order it.</TE>
<TE>   Out With the Dogs: I take the dogs hiking a lot. There's a little
place off Mulholland Drive that I like to go to because it's shady
and there's an outlook and a little waterfall area when there's
enough rain. It's west of Laurel Canyon Dog Park, which I go to as
well. And then sometimes I will go up to Bronson Canyon with the dogs
because they have the caves over there, which is fun. That's a nice
Sunday afternoon, a little hiking with the dogs, maybe a bubble bath
and "The Sopranos."</TE>
<TE>   Tropical Fruit: I like to go to antique stores on Magnolia
Boulevard out in the Valley. They have some good places out there.
And I love to go to costume stores. I found the best place to get
costumes is in Las Vegas, because they have all these old showgirl
outfits. I got a really good Carmen Miranda fruit hat and I got a
really beautiful headdress out there. I was just driving downtown and
there was an industrial-looking building that said "costumes," and I
made a U-turn.</TE>

<LD>The plight of aging or flawed women in a youth-obsessed society is
the subject of "The Most Massive Woman Wins" and "39*21*50," two
thematically linked one-acts being presented by the Theatre District
at the Cast.</LD>
<LD>   Set in a liposuction clinic, Madeleine George's "Massive" is a
highly stylized piece that samples the emotionally charged
interactions of four women awaiting surgery. The action flows freely,
from present-day chatter back in time to the girls' playground
rhyming games, barbed and telling snippets of verse that already poke
fun at those who do not conform.</LD>
<LD>   Under the direction of Mario Lescot, the cast--Alice Ensor,
Shannon Hunt, Jessica Learned and Nancy Petersen--manages some finely
tuned ensemble work. Unfortunately, George's disappointingly
humorless piece errs on the side of excess and hyperbole. A
succession of anguished monologues goes increasingly over the top in
the most blatantly manipulative sense. One sequence, in which a
character recalls sneaking out of her mother's wedding to gorge on an
enormous wedding cake, seems embarrassingly strained, more a tall
tale than a physically plausible reminiscence.</LD>
<TE>   Lescot also directs the closing piece, Max Riley's "39*21*50,"
which features Ensor, Hunt and Petersen, joined by Suzie Kane as a
good ol' gal who accepts the ravages of time with more equanimity
than her fellows. The action is set in a restaurant, where two older
women meet for lunch and begin to gradually converse with the younger
women at the next table. Their conversation is about--what else?--the
march of time, the pull of gravity and the lure of cosmetic surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Their prattle, while hardly earth-shattering, is amusingly
slice-of-life and believable, a fly-on-the-wall perspective that
captures the way women really talk and the issues that concern them.</TE>
<TE>   "The Most Massive Woman Wins" and "39*21*50," the Theatre District
at the Cast, 804 N. El Centro, Hollywood. Thursdays-Saturdays, 8
p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends March 10. $10-$15. (323) 957-2343. Running
time: 1 hour, 45 minutes.</TE>

<DH>On a tour of the U.S., singers Khaled and Hakim find
audiences eager to understand.</DH>

<LD>If the process of getting on an airplane since the tragic events of
Sept. 11 has become a more aggravating--if not daunting--ordeal for
Americans, think what it must be like for a troupe of Middle Eastern
musicians.</LD>
<LD>   "Call it an interesting experience," says Miles Copeland. As the
president of the Ark 21/Mondo Melodia record company, he has been
traveling for the last few weeks with Algerian rai singer Khaled and
Egyptian shaabi singer Hakim on a tour that began in Boston on Feb. 2
and concludes Saturday and Sunday at the Orpheum Theatre in downtown
Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to the headliners, the tour includes about 30
musicians from the Middle East as well as various parts of Europe.</LD>
<TE>   "So you can imagine what it looks like when we arrive at the
airport," Copeland says. "At one point, we got onto a shuttle bus and
practically filled it up with all our people. The bus driver took one
look at us and said the bus was full enough and he wouldn't take any
other passengers. And at practically every checkpoint, our entire
party was held up for a 'random check.'"</TE>
<TE>   Originally scheduled for September, the tour was canceled
after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. The
initial concert was to take place in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 13
as part of a celebratory acknowledgement of America's rapidly growing
interest in Arabic music.</TE>
<TE>   The obvious questions as the rescheduled tour finally arrived in
the U.S. were whether that interest had dissipated, and whether the
performers might be greeted with suspicion and hostility.</TE>
<TE>   The first answers were provided by the enthusiastic response to an
appearance by Khaled at the World Economic Forum in New York City,
where he sang John Lennon's "Imagine" in a duet with Israeli artist
Noa.</TE>
<TE>   The reactions of the concert tour audiences were even more
encouraging.</TE>
<TE>   "When I looked out at the audience in
Washington," says Khaled, "and I saw so many Americans were there,
and saw how they were pleased to see me, pleased to be enjoying the
music, it gave me a very optimistic feeling about our music."</TE>
<TE>   Hakim agrees. "I had heard before we came that there was some
treatment of Middle Eastern people that wasn't very good, but when we
got here, I saw the contrary. It has been difficult at times in the
airports, but that's natural. And I must tell you, in all honesty,
that if they weren't that careful, I'd be worried too."</TE>
<TE>   Hakim's concern raises an interesting issue regarding the American
tendency--exacerbated since Sept. 11--to view Middle Easterners from
the same generic perspective.</TE>
<TE>   That's obviously simplistic, and, in the case of Khaled and Hakim,
it overlooks the fact that their art is not exactly high on Islamic
fundamentalists' list of accepted activities.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more than that," Hakim says. "Almost all sorts of
fundamentalists will say that any music is not good, not approved."
   Although they are vastly different in style and manner,
both Hakim's shaabi music and Khaled's rai draw from the feelings,
ideas and passions of the streets, transforming them via metaphor
and imagery into immensely popular music.</TE>
<TE>   Both of the principals assert that the Khaled/Hakim concerts are
without political implications, and in an overt sense, that's true.
But it's also apparent that a American tour by major Middle East and
North African artists inevitably has repercussions reaching beyond
the music itself.</TE>
<TE>   "The unusual thing about 9/11," says Copeland, who managed the
Police for many years, "is that it seems to have created, in some
Americans at least, an interest to learn more about Islamic culture.
But the other side of that coin is that there seems to be some
receptivity in the Middle East and North Africa, as well, to learning
more about Americans."</TE>
<TE>   Khaled, Hakim, with Simon Shaheen, Saturday and Sunday at the
Orpheum Theatre, 842 S. Broadway, downtown L.A. 8 p.m. $27 to $152.

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Has anyone had as nice a day as we have?" asked Guy Garvey, the
endearing, rumpled singer of the young English band Elbow, from the
Troubadour stage on Tuesday. "I doubt it."</LD>
<LD>   That kind of genuine, naive charm was the Manchester quintet's
secret weapon Tuesday, a winning setup for the blindside sock of its
musical creativity and emotional depth.</LD>
<LD>   Think of Elbow as Radiohead with puppy-dog cuddliness rather than
distancing wariness. And indeed, Elbow's music worked some of the
same Beatles-meet-Pink Floyd aesthetic as Radiohead. From the
cathedral-like musical structures of "Any Day Now" to the pained
vulnerability of the closing "Newborn," building from a yearning
solitude to intense catharsis, the band fully fleshed out the
atmospheric potential of its impressive debut album, "Asleep in the
Back."</LD>
<TE>   If Garvey's friendly manner made it hard to imagine Elbow
commanding a larger setting than this small club, the dynamics of the
music and performance made it hard to imagine the band's not doing
so.</TE>
<TE>   Fellow U.K. act South, sharing the bill on both bands' first
proper U.S. tour, arrived with a big buzz, its hybrid of guitar-based
Anglo-rock and electronica-derived patterns developed under the
tutelage of producer and Mo'Wax label head James Lavelle. On the
album "From Here on In," it makes for seductive, if inconsequential
atmospheres, evoking Stone Roses via Oasis, the latter particularly
in Joel Cadbury's voice and melodies.</TE>
<TE>   Live, the music had more dimension, thanks to the hard-hitting
attack of drummer Bret Shaw, which is underplayed on the album. But
often the elements failed to gel, and neither the rock nor
electronica was strong enough to carry the set. Ironically, the best
moments were those when South threw off the techno-like structures
and played more freely, notably on the extended "Sight of Me,"
charged with brooding, Stone Roses-like neo-psychedelia.</TE>

<DH>'How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog' finally goes for a walk
in theaters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Probably some dog owners will think that it's poetic justice that
Michael Kalesniko, the writer and director of the feature comedy "How
to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog," lives in a Glendale neighborhood that
is definitely dog-friendly. In fact, a chorus of barks, howls and
yowls emanate from his neighbors' homes whenever anybody walks down
the street where he lives.</LD>
<LD>   Kalesniko and his wife, Nancy M. Ruff (who is the film's
producer), don't really seem to have anything against dogs. But they
are cat people, sharing their home with three felines including a
very chatty female tabby named Nora who, Kalesniko boasts, acts like
a dog.</LD>
<LD>   "How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog," which opens in limited release
Friday , stars Kenneth Branagh as Peter McGowan, L.A.'s most
successful playwright. The acerbic British-born Peter, though, is in
the midst of a dry spell. He's not having much luck writing his
latest play because the Armenian neighbors next door have a new dog,
Baby, who barks constantly.</LD>
<TE>   Robin Wright Penn plays his wife, Melanie, a children's dance
instructor who is obsessed with starting a family. Peter, though, is
uncomfortable around children and isn't keen on becoming a father.
Peter and Melanie's life changes when a recently separated woman and
her young, disabled daughter, Amy (Suzi Hofrichter), move in next
door. Lynn Redgrave plays Peter's Alzheimer's-stricken mother-in-law;
Jared Harris is an obsessed fan masquerading as Peter.</TE>
<TE>   Kalesniko, who wrote the screenplay to Howard Stern's 1997 comedy,
"Private Parts," and has worked extensively as a script doctor,
actually made "How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog" three years ago. It
has been an uphill battle for Kalesniko and Ruff to get their
independent production a theatrical release.</TE>
<TE>   The couple had a setback last fall when the film, made for
approximately $7 million, actually premiered on the Starz cable
network; the video and DVD of the film arrives in stores late next
month.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a complicated story," Kalesniko says. "What I am caught up
in ... this is like "The Producers," but I am living it for real. For
whatever reason [the financiers] can't risk this movie being a hit."
(Reviews so far for the film have been mixed.)</TE>
<TE>   Initially, the film was shown out of competition at the Cannes
Film Festival in 2000. "We got offers from all the major distributors
and offers in the seven figures. The financiers rejected them all,
only for them to sell it to Starz cable, which I would say is a third
position cable company for a third of the price. That was their
preference."</TE>
<TE>   Kalesniko, 41, and Ruff, 44, eventually got back the theatrical
rights to their film and found a boutique distributor, Artistic
License. "The big guys had walked away," Kalesniko says. "Artistic
License has a great reputation. It's [opening] in three theaters here
and three in New York and one in Dallas, and then we'll go wider."</TE>
<TE>   "I think in the end it may work out for the best," Ruff says. "Not
too many people saw it on Starz. The film belongs on the big
screen--that has always been my position on it. It was made for the
big screen, and we were told it would be on the big screen. We have
come to find out that they are mostly financial reasons that they
went ahead [and sold it to cable]. It was really difficult [for us]
because it was a defeat."</TE>
<TE>   But Ruff and Kalesniko didn't surrender. "I became pretty
obnoxious with everybody," Ruff says. "I did get on people's nerves.
We would never have been opening on Friday if I hadn't spent every
moment of every day trying to get it where it is."</TE>
<TE>   Kalesniko says going the independent route is not for the faint of
heart. "It's a tough haul. There are times when it is disheartening,
but to tell you the truth, it's thrilling now because it is an
enormous victory. We have won a lot of festivals. We did the festival
route for about a year. We have won about half a dozen awards--always
the audience awards, though we won the Jury award at Avignon. Because
audiences always responded well to this film that is why we want it
in theaters--not on a station like Starz that no one sees."</TE>
<TE>   He and Ruff decided to make the film independently because, says
Kalesniko, "Hollywood is not exactly lining up at the studios to give
first-time directors a shot at really expensive films. I wrote a few
spec [scripts] that I have sold that didn't get made but that I
wanted to direct myself. When it came to this, I knew how bad I
wanted to direct it when I wrote it."</TE>
<TE>   His agent read the script and thought it would be a "star vehicle"
and began to send it out. It caught the eye of Robert Redford's South
Fork Pictures, and Redford signed on as executive producer. With his
name attached to the project, Kalesniko began to round up his cast.
"I always wanted Kenneth Branagh. It just fit him like a glove....
Once we had him and Robin, it was easy to build a cast around them.
We had our choice. We had great actors coming to us."</TE>
<TE>   As the neighborhood dogs start barking again, Kalesniko
acknowledges that at one point he did contemplate killing a
neighbor's pooch. "The house before this one was a rental," he says.
"It was in Glendale on a hill so the houses were terraced. Our
neighbors got a dog named Baby and the dog would bark into our house.
It barked all the time."</TE>
<TE>   The neighbors turned a deaf ear to his complaints, he says.</TE>
<TE>   "I am always amazed that dog owners can never hear their own dog
barking," he sighs. Soon Kalesniko became obsessed with doing away
with Baby.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are lying awake at night, and the dog is keeping you
awake, and you are wondering what to write next, it sort of becomes
forced inspiration-- you start daydreaming about killing the dog.
There is no information on how to do this and get away with it. Sleep
deprivation can make you do some pretty desperate things, but I never
did it, of course. It became a script, thank goodness. And we moved."</TE>

<LD>"Biloxi Blues"--If there's a war going on, it's time for a military
comedy. The decision by Pasadena Playhouse--in the wake of Sept.
11--to ditch an expensive production of a new play in favor of Neil
Simon's "Biloxi Blues" may appear awfully safe. Especially when an
American flag unfurls during the curtain call, the choice looks
overly calculated.</LD>
<LD>   Nonetheless, "Biloxi Blues" remains one of the best military
comedies, and this production treats it well. As part of his basic
training at a camp near Biloxi, Miss., young GI Eugene Jerome (Daniel
Sauli) learns that he can't always play it safe, observing from the
sidelines. Sometimes he has to step forward to preserve his
individual identity, even as the Army seems intent on squashing
it.... Evan Neuman, making his professional stage debut as Arnold
Epstein, is a model of spare, focused intensity. In comparison with
some other interpretations of the role, Neuman downplays the hints
that lead Eugene to think Arnold might be gay. But it's not necessary
to make Arnold especially effeminate, for Simon establishes the
overall level of homophobia in the military in 1943 elsewhere in the
plot. Of course, this remains an issue even now--making "Biloxi
Blues" surprisingly topical on this subject.</LD>

<LD>   Stone Embarks on Castro Documentary</LD>
<LD>   Oliver Stone, whose credits include films on John F. Kennedy and
Richard Nixon, is adding Fidel Castro to his list. This time,
however, he's shooting a documentary, reportedly with the Cuban
leader's cooperation.</LD>
<TE>   According to Variety, "Looking for Fidel" will contain extensive
interviews with Castro, with whom Stone had a six-hour dinner
Saturday. The film--a production of Spain's MediaPro, Morena Films
and Pentagrama Films--is expected to be released in the fall.</TE>

<TE>   Met Fires Extra</TE>
<TE>   for 'War and Peace' Fall</TE>
<TE>   The Metropolitan Opera has fired a cast member who tumbled off the
stage into the orchestra pit during last week's premiere performance
of Prokofiev's "War and Peace."</TE>
<TE>   Met spokesman Francois Giuliani said Wednesday that
Simon Deonarian, a non-singing extra who was playing a French
grenadier, "is no longer with the company." Deonarian, who was paid $30
per show, was not hurt in the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Last Thursday, Deonarian appeared to roll off the steeply raked
stage during the final scene of the four-hour epic--a mishap that
brought the production to a halt for several minutes. When the
curtain came down, Met general manager Joseph Volpe brought a smiling
Deonarian out to center stage to loud applause. "Our retreating
French soldier lost his way in the snowstorm," he quipped.</TE>
<TE>   After viewing a video of the production, however, Volpe concluded
that Deonarian had jumped after losing his way "because he was
overacting," he told the New York Times.</TE>
<TE>   Not so, says Deonarian, who insists he inadvertently drifted into
the pit in what he calls a "freak accident."</TE>
<TE>   RADIO</TE>
<TE>   Two Staffers Suspended in Latest KPFK Tussle</TE>
<TE>   Marc Cooper, host of "Marc Cooper's Daily Review," and Jeff
Kaufman, a public affairs producer and occasional on-air host, have
been relieved of their duties after refusing to participate in the
winter fund-raising drive at KPFK-FM (90.7).</TE>
<TE>   Cooper said his reluctance stems from his "deep and abiding
concerns about the direction and future of the [Pacifica] network"
under its new management.</TE>
<TE>   Pacifica has been in a protracted fight with critics who
accused the network of straying from its left-of-center roots in an
attempt to broaden its audience. The situation was temporarily resolved
when a new interim national board took the reins in December. KPFK
general manager Mark Schubb was let go in January.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Starr, the interim general manager at KPFK, said Cooper and
Kaufman were suspended, not fired. He's waiting to hear from the
pair, who received his letter on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "They refused to perform assigned tasks, which is a violation of a
union agreement," Starr said Wednesday. "My principal objective is to
raise funding for the station at this critical time, and I require
the cooperation of all on-air talent to do so."</TE>
<TE>   No decision has been made as to replacing Cooper's show, which
airs weekdays at 4 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   "War Letters," the staged reading of wartime correspondence at the
Canon Theatre in Beverly Hills, will close Sunday. The production
will have completed only seven performances since this past Sunday's
opening and 19 previews, which began Jan. 29. "It seems L.A.
audiences are not interested in this topic right now," said
co-producer Susan Dietz. "I misjudged the zeitgeist."</TE>

<HD>It's a Puppet Show, Yes, but It's Definitely Not for Kids</HD>
<DH>A program celebrates an ancient art form in very
unusual--and adult--ways.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AL RIDENOUR</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some call it the "new vaudeville," and others just see the old
vaudeville with a few more piercings and tattoos. Either way, for
more than a decade, naked fire-eaters, hipster magicians and
old-fashioned fan dancers have shared stages with punks, indie
rockers and other young musical stylists.</LD>
<LD>   But where are the puppets?</LD>
<LD>   The world of vaudeville depended on that geezer in pinstripes who
kept his arm up the backside of a bickering little man with varnished
spinning eyes. On Sunday at Highways Performance Space in Santa
Monica, the voice-throwers, marionettes, talking socks and their
floppy friends return with a vengeance for a night of "Puppet
Terror."</LD>
<TE>   Curated by Marcus Kuiland-Nazario as part of Highways' Pop Tarts
performance series, "Puppet Terror" celebrates the launching of a
magazine of the same name published by Pleasant Gehman and Shawna
Kenney. Gleefully emblazoned across the cover of the first issue is
the disclaimer, "ADULTS ONLY," a useful tip for parents who might
consider toting the kids for a weekend outing of puppetry.</TE>
<TE>   Authors Gehman and Kenney unflinchingly embrace sex, drugs, and
rock 'n' roll as common literary terrain. Kenney's first book, "I Was
a Teenage Dominatrix" (Retro Systems, 1999), recounts her means of
raising college tuition, earning the author praise from Salon.com as
a "Holden Caulfield in leather." That same year, Gehman edited "The
Underground Guide to Los Angeles" (Manic D Press) and last year
followed up with her semi-autobiographical "Escape From Houdini
Mountain" (Manic D Press), exploring the seamy glamour of Hollywood's
1980s rock scene, when Gehman fronted bands such as the Screamin'
Sirens and the Ringling Sisters.</TE>
<TE>   Today Gehman and Kenney both work as freelance journalists. "We're
so busy with other things," Kenney says, "the very idea of a puppet
fanzine was a joke--at first, anyway. Pleasant is 42, and I'm 32. We
haven't made 'zines since we were teenagers." But there was something
about the old demented cut-and-paste style of 'zines that suited the
unsettling qualities of those glassy-eyed creatures.</TE>
<TE>   For Gehman, puppets have always prompted questions about
consensual reality, rationality, psychosis. "As a kid, I just
thought, why are these grown-ups playing with dolls? Why are they
talking in weird voices? They just seemed crazy. I knew those puppets
couldn't talk, but it seemed that everybody wanted me to play along,"
she says. "That was the accepted reality, what a good girl would do."</TE>
<TE>   "Puppet Terror" at Highways will reflect the puppet's role in
unraveling the rational. On the bill is the Cinnamon Roll Gang, a
local troupe known for phantasmagoric spectacles. Gehman describes it
simply as "Muppets on acid" and confesses, "I'm not exactly sure what
they'll do this time, but I know it will involve a lot of people and
mess."</TE>
<TE>   Also toying with reality will be Paul Zaloom, an artist
Kuiland-Nazario describes as someone who "can make an entire opera
out of a spoon, a fork and a plate." Zaloom's frenzied wit and
slapdash use of everyday objects have earned him fellowships from the
National Endowment for the Arts and the Guggenheim as well as the
starring role in the Emmy Award-winning "Beakman's World," a tweaky
kiddie science show that aired on CBS from 1992 to 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Lending ammunition to the notion that puppets are dangerous will
be Michelle Berne's 15-foot Celebration Arts Puppets, appropriately
attired for the evening in dynamite. Emphasizing the puppet's
potential for sin will be Valentina Violette of the burlesque troupe
Velvet Hammer, performing a "puppetease" with a diabolical companion.</TE>
<TE>   Gehman recalls puppet shows from her youth that were similarly
naughty, "filled with really racy, sexual innuendo, people getting
drunk, dummies mouthing off, making rude comments, throwing fits.
Puppets were allowed to get away with anything--stuff that would've
gotten the puppeteer slapped with a lawsuit."</TE>
<TE>   True to the spirit of children's puppet theater, Kenney and Gehman
are planning for audience interaction, distributing handmade sock
puppets "so people can meet their neighbor." There will also be a
projector for improvising shadow puppets, along with puppet videos
and puppet-themed songs. "We're encouraging audience members to bring
their own puppets," Gehman says. "We want people to dress in puppet
fetish wear too, but that hasn't really quite been defined."</TE>
<TE>   Joining Kenney and Gehman in readings from the first issue of
Puppet Terror will be gothic scenester-poet Clint Catalyst and rock
'n'-roll litterateur Iris Berry interviewing a world-weary celebrity
sock puppet.</TE>
<TE>   Material from the 30-page fanzine ranges from autobiographical
tales of puppet paranoia to puppet haiku, limericks and even excerpts
from a master's thesis on puppet history, imparting details of a 16th
century English figure of Christ engineered to move its lips and
eyes, as well as an account of an enormous funerary puppet in which
deceased Bwende chieftains are transported in Zaire.</TE>
<TE>   An undeniable streak of earnest puppet love overlies the
atrocities recounted in Puppet Terror, and Gehman is eager to
emphasize that she and Kenney "both have a respect for puppetry and
puppeteers. It's an art form that's been around for thousands of
years, a totally legitimate and wonderful part of theater."</TE>
<TE>   Gehman grew up in the shadow of a mother who had performed with
puppeteer Burr Tillstrom of "Kukla, Fran and Ollie" fame. Former
dominatrix Kenney spent several months during her early teens
traveling through Maryland and Virginia with a Church of the Nazarene
evangelical puppet troupe. This peculiar admixture of fascination and
repulsion naturally lends itself to thoughtful and therapeutic
reflection and journalizing.</TE>
<TE>   Kenney and Gehman have only scratched the surface, and submissions
from other equally disturbed souls, Kenney says, have not nearly
filled out a second issue of Puppet Terror but also demonstrated the
epidemic proportions of puppet phobia.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Can Opener: Cannery Seafood of the Pacific has finally opened in
Newport Beach. Those of you who know that Ron Salisbury, owner of the
El Cholo restaurants, took over a former-cannery-turned-restaurant
there have been waiting patiently for it to open. Two years, in fact.
Now at dinner, Felix Salcedo, formerly the chef at Sonora Cafe in
L.A., another of Salisbury's restaurants, turns out scallop ceviche
($8.95), baked mussels with jalapenos and cilantro ($11.95), and
steamed clams in a white wine broth ($11.95) for starters. Obviously,
the menu is seafood-driven, with entrees such as chile-charred ahi
tuna ($21.50), Pacific swordfish with lobster cream ($22.50) and a
seafood enchilada ($17.95), though red meat makes an appearance as a
barbecued pork chop ($22.50), Colorado rack of lamb ($28.75),
herb-roasted chicken ($17.50) and various steaks.</LD>
<LD>   Photos of the cannery in its working days some 30 years ago
decorate the walls of the restaurant's lobby. Dinner is served daily
from 5:30 p.m. Daily lunch service should begin in early March,
followed by Sunday brunch in mid-March.</LD>
<LD>   * Cannery Seafood of the Pacific, 3010 Lafayette Blvd., Newport
Beach; (949) 566-0060.</LD>
<TE>   Little Italy Got Bigger: Another Maggiano's Little Italy will open
next month at the Grove, the new shopping complex-in-construction
beside the old Farmers Market at Fairfax Avenue and 3rd Street.
Maggiano's is a family-style Italian dinner house with an upscale
design, similar in concept to Buca di Beppo but with much fancier
digs. Maggiano's exist already in Woodland Hills and Costa Mesa. More
details on the restaurant chain can be found at their Web site at
www.maggianos.com.</TE>
<TE>   * Maggiano's Little Italy, at the Grove, 189 Grove Drive, L.A.;
(323) 965-9665.</TE>
<TE>   Menu Action:  Kincaid's Bay House in Redondo Beach has launched
its prawn festival. For the next month, chef James Miller will be
cooking Alaskan spot prawns, Australian banana prawns, Indian giant
freshwater prawns, Florida rock shrimp, Thailand black tiger prawns,
Cabo white prawns and Chilean bay shrimp as appetizers and entrees at
lunch and dinner ($7.95-$24.95) daily. The "Prawntastic Journey," as
they're calling it, runs until March 30. Kincaid's Bay House, on the
Redondo Beach Pier, 500 Fisherman's Wharf, Redondo Beach; (310)
318-6080....</TE>
<TE>   The Terrace Restaurant at the Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel puts out
a seafood buffet every Friday night (which is especially handy for
those folks who gave up red meat for Lent) that includes sushi,
oysters and seafood chowder, as well as swordfish, halibut and a slew
of other fish. It's $48 per person and includes a dessert spread. The
Terrace at the Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel, 1 Ritz-Carlton Drive, Dana
Point; (949) 240-5008....</TE>
<TE>   In response to the recent resurgence in downtown L.A., McCormick &amp;
Schmick's Seafood Restaurant there has opened for lunch for the first
time in its 10-year history. The menu is the same as the dinner menu,
with the addition of "lunch and light" entrees ranging from $6-$14.
The restaurant now opens at noon daily. McCormick &amp; Schmick's, on the
4th level of the Library Towers, 633 W. 5th St., downtown L.A.; (213)
629-1929....</TE>
<TE>   Drago in Santa Monica  has begun serving family-style meals at the
communal table on Wednesday nights. The family meals include a
risotto, a ravioli, a pasta, a meat or poultry entree and a dessert,
for $35 per person. If you want to sit at your own table, at least
two people must order the family menu, which changes weekly. Drago,
2628 Wilshire Blvd., Santa Monica; (310) 828-1585.</TE>
<TE>   PETA Approves: If a stamp of approval by the animal-rights
organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (or PETA)
gets your mouth watering, visit their Web site at www.peta.org.
They've recently begun spotlighting vegetarian and vegan restaurants
across the country. Last month's pick was Native Foods at 11101/2
Gayley Ave. in Westwood. Their phone is (310) 209-1055.</TE>
<TE>   Correction:  Last Thursday, we incorrectly said that Locanda
Veneta is in Santa Monica. The restaurant is in Los Angeles, on 3rd
Street.</TE>

<HD>The Plight of a Collaborator</HD>
<DH>The fate of a Polish police officer who serves the Nazis is
played out in an Andrzej Wajda film being shown at the Freedom
Festival 2002.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The American Cinema Foundation's annual Freedom Festival 2002, which
runs through Tuesday at the Goethe Institute and the Monica 4-Plex,
opens tonight with an invitational gala at the Directors Guild with
the 8 p.m. screening of "The Condemnation of Franciszek Klos," the
latest work from Poland's great senior director Andrzej Wajda. For 45
years, Wajda has returned time and again to World War II as
inspiration for some of his finest films, and this adaptation of the
Stanislaw Rembek novel is no exception.</LD>
<LD>   Intense, intimate, terse and relentless, the film opens with
small-town police officer Klos (Miroslaw Baka) gunning down a member
of the Polish Resistance, which results in a letter from the
underground organization condemning him to death. Klos is cursed by
being a coward with a conscience who tries to drown guilt and now
fear with moonshine and vodka. He tries to appease his brutal German
occupying superiors while drunkenly asserting his own authority over
his neighbors and shooting down Jews whenever he comes across them
trying to hide themselves. Yet he craves redemption and absolution,
though perhaps not as much as an identification card granting him
all-important German citizenship.</LD>
<TE>   As Klos comes apart, his community's elders, who spend their days
in the local tavern, serve as a Greek chorus commenting on the
playing out of his fate--and thereby of Poland itself. Andrzej
succeeds in eliciting pity for the weakling Klos, who is portrayed by
Baka in a thoroughly harrowing fashion. At 75, Wajda remains
ever-vigorous and provocative, his talent immediate and fresh.</TE>
<TE>   Idolya Fekete's "Chico" (Friday at 9:30 p.m. at the Monica 4-Plex)
is a complex, challenging, epic-scale story, dryly satirical yet
poignant, about a steadfast Communist, Ricardo (Eduardo Rozsa
Flores), a Bolivian of Hungarian Jewish and Spanish descent, whose
father was a radical artist and playwright and mother a wealthy
aristocrat, which resulted in a peripatetic youth and career as a war
correspondent. He eventually turns mercenary, and his moment of truth
arrives in the Central European conflicts that began in 1989. Much to
his dismay, Ricardo discovers an emptiness with the victorious
emergence of Croatia, for he sees no more wars to fight that engage
his Communist sympathies. "Chico" has tremendous scope, a sense of
being in the thick of battle and an absurdist tone that points up the
eternality of human folly.</TE>
<TE>   Among other films screening are Murad Ibragimbekov's satirical
"True Stories," done in the style of early talkies, and Gyula
Gazdag's surreal 1974 "Singing on the Treadmill." Ibragimbekov and
Gazdag, a longtime UCLA film school professor, will attend the
screenings of their films. (310) 286-9420.</TE>
<TE>   Following the Friday 7 p.m. screening of "Juana La Loca," which
was unavailable for preview and which opens the American
Cinematheque's annual "Recent Spanish Cinema" series, "Fausto 5.0"
screens at 10 p.m. A boldly surreal updating of the Faust legend, it
stars Miguel Angel Sola as a middle-aged cancer specialist who
attends a medical convention only to cross paths with a persistent,
overly familiar stranger (Eduardo Fernandez), who insists the doctor
performed a life-saving operation on him eight years earlier. As
obnoxious as the stranger is, he manages to insert himself into the
standoffish surgeon's life, for after all he is Satan, who leads the
workaholic doctor astray with classic temptations of the flesh.
"Fausto 5.0," which marks an audacious screen debut for the renowned
Catalan Fura dels Baus acting troupe, is a triumph of dazzling, eerie
style with some horror film flourishes and a delightfully confounding
finish.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's programming begins at 5 p.m. with Fernando Trueba's
1980 debut feature, "Opera Prima," the eternal boy-meets-girl tale
fleshed out so imaginatively and so stylishly that it becomes
uniquely quirky and delightful. Bigas Luna's 1999 "Volaverunt"
investigates the mysterious death of tempestuous duchess of Alba,
immortalized by Goya's La Maja Vestida and the infamous Maja Desnuda.
What's important here is how Luna views the courtiers of King Carlos
IV. He is at once amused and awed by the audacity of their incessant
sexual and political intrigues yet reveals the tremendous toll that
could be exacted of those who lived lives of self-indulgent splendor.
He suggests that the duchess (Altana Sanchez-Gijon), emotionally
drained by her arduous love life and political intrigues, might well
have poisoned herself.</TE>
<TE>   Among the key suspects are the prime minister of Spain (Jordi
Molia), acting on behalf of Queen Maria Luisa (Stefania Sandrelli),
who regarded the duchess as her rival and coveted her jewels, and
Pepita (Penelope Cruz), the peasant girl who became the prime
minister's mistress--and seemingly the actual model for the Naked
Maja--who resented the duchess' rude treatment. "Volaverunt" is above
all a tribute to the sexual power of women, and like the prime
minister, Goya (Cuba's Jorge Perugorria, star of "Strawberry and
Chocolate") is also bewitched by the duchess and Pepita. (323)
466-FILM.</TE>
<TE>   The recently established Echo Park Film Center, 1200 Alvarado
St.(at the northeast corner of Alvarado and Sunset Boulevard)
presents tonight at 8 an evening of films by Humboldt State
graduates, "From Hippies to Hipsters." Included are a pair of jaunty,
infectious 15-minute documentaries by Jensen Rufe, "In Search of the
Famous Hoosier Breaded Pork Tenderloin," probing into a statewide
passion for outsized pork tenderloin sandwiches and their bizarre
purported origin some 90 years ago, and "The Ugliest Fountain in the
World," about a dismal, shallow circle of concrete, littered with
debris, its small central circle of jets rarely in operation and an
eyesore for 40 years on the Humboldt campus. Rufe not only attempts
to find who ordered the fountain's construction but also organizes an
anti-fountain protest either to fix it up or to get rid of it
entirely. (At last report, no action had been taken despite
assurances from the university's president.) (213) 413-8783.</TE>
<TE>   Note: the UCLA Film Archive's "Unseen Cinema: Early American
Avant-Garde Film" continues tonight through Sunday at Melnitz Hall's

<HD>Sinking Feeling in 'Swimming to Cambodia' Revival</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before Tuesday, Spalding Gray had not performed his most famous
monologue, "Swimming to Cambodia," since the late '80s. And it
showed.</LD>
<LD>   At UCLA's Freud Playhouse Tuesday, Gray groped his way through the
text almost as if he hadn't looked at it, even for a quick review.
His delivery was swimming in hesitation, marked by "uh"s and
stammering sounds. At times, he appeared to be flipping through the
pages, editing as he went.</LD>
<LD>   He announced at the outset that UCLA had invited him to revive the
piece and "in a way, I wish I hadn't said yes, because I didn't leave
an opening in my life." He then told about a recent trip to Ireland
in which he was injured in a traffic accident, before finally
returning to "Swimming to Cambodia."</LD>
<TE>   Why "Swimming to Cambodia" now? Going in, I guessed that Gray's
account of his experiences as an actor in Thailand shooting "The
Killing Fields," the 1984 film about the Cambodian genocide, would
somehow link with post-Sept. 11 concerns. Sure enough, Gray included
a couple of glancing references to recent events, as when he expanded
a line about the "cloud of evil" that sometimes settles on cultures
to refer not only to the Khmer Rouge's Cambodia but also to such
sites as Rwanda, Afghanistan and New York.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Gray's stories about having a minor role in a movie--and
looking for transcendent fun in the Thai sex clubs and surf--seemed
more trivial and more distanced from the horrors of the Khmer Rouge
than they had in 1985. Perhaps this is because more recent horrors
are so fresh in our minds.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, Gray's half-hearted performance made it hard to
escape the feeling that he was simply going through the motions
because he didn't want to break his contract with UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   In 1985, "Swimming to Cambodia" was magnetic. In its present
state, the magnets are missing.</TE>

<CX>   Spalding Gray--Spalding Gray performed "Swimming to Cambodia" in
three other venues in recent months before bringing it to UCLA this week.

<HD>Olympic Freeze-Out</HD>
<DH>The Utah Symphony tries to generate some heat on tour after
being given the cold shoulder at home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This should be a glorious time for the Utah Symphony. It performed at
the opening ceremonies of the 2002 Olympic Winter Games, broadcast
around the world. It was prominently featured in the Olympic Arts
Festival during the first week of the games. And it participates on a
best-selling CD, high on the Billboard charts--John Williams'
Olympic-themed "American Journey."</LD>
<LD>   All of this--along with the fact that the orchestra's music
director, Keith Lockhart, is also music director of the Boston Pops
and has a high television profile--should have made the Utah Symphony
a popular attraction when it appeared Tuesday night at the Pasadena
Civic Auditorium. Think again. At most, a couple hundred people
showed up, leaving the large theater mostly empty.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, the last two weeks haven't been nearly as glorious as they
might have been for this long-respected orchestra.</LD>
<TE>   The opening ceremonies were a humiliation--the organizers, fearing
any outcome not predestined (an odd concept for a sports event),
forced the orchestra to prerecord its contribution and then shiver in
18-degree weather pretending to play instruments borrowed from a high
school (the cold could have damaged fine ones). On the broadcast,
heedless television announcers gabbed over practically every note
anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Olympic officials, meanwhile, took over Maurice Abravanel Hall,
forcing the orchestra to rent it back for its concerts in the arts
festival.</TE>
<TE>   This week, with no place to play in Salt Lake City, the Utah
Symphony decided to visit Southern California for the first time in
seven years, with two different programs. The symphonic one, designed
specifically for the tour and not heard in Salt Lake City, was played
Tuesday night. Also on the tour is a pops evening with Broadway
singer Elaine Paige that was part of the Olympic Arts Festival.</TE>
<TE>   Two themes ran through Tuesday's concert, the program not meant
for Salt Lake City. John Corigliano's "Three Hallucinations" and
Erich Korngold's Violin Concerto, on the first half, are concert
works made from music originally written for Hollywood films.</TE>
<TE>   The other theme was potentially scandalous. "Three
Hallucinations," which Corigliano adapted from his score to Ken
Russell's film "Altered States," and Berlioz's "Symphonie
Fantastique," played after intermission, are extremely vivid
orchestral orgies representing the psychedelic effects of
hallucinogens. Corigliano's music wigs out on magic mushrooms.
Berlioz's is stoned on opium. Both thrill an audience. Take that,
Utah! Take that, Olympics!</TE>
<TE>   In fact, there wasn't all that much to get worked up about
Tuesday, one way or another. Lockhart can be an odd combination of
the flashy and the politely perfunctory. He conducts without a baton,
with gestures lucid and animated. He likes splashy effects but
nothing wild, nothing out of place.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Lockhart and the Utah Symphony did a splendid job with the
Corigliano.</TE>
<TE>   The "Hallucinations" do not sound nearly as reckless on the
concert stage as they seem in the film. For the soundtrack,
Corigliano included electronics and went crazy when accompanying
William Hurt's drug-induced visions (often with the nude Blair
Brown). For his symphonic suite, he restores a sense of order, and
avoids the sentimental elements also in the film music. But the
orchestration is full of lively effects, and they were here made
vivid.</TE>
<TE>   Berlioz's symphony was given a less tidy performance. Although
Lockhart never really let the orchestra go, the strings were just
insecure enough in the opening reverie to make it sound woozy for the
wrong reason. There was some fine virtuoso playing at times, but loud
trumpets caused concern.</TE>
<TE>   The legacy of Abravanel, who led the orchestra from 1947 to 1979,
is still heard in its lean, spicy tone. In its four years under
Lockhart, it retains its admirable tendency toward clarity. But
Berlioz's symphony never quite fully came to life.</TE>
<TE>   As for Korngold's Violin Concerto, a sumptuous antique written for
Jascha Heifetz in 1947, it could have used a more beguiling soloist.
Pip Clarke delivered it with dispatch. The British violinist is a
declarative, emphatic player, more interested in arriving at the high
point of a phrase than getting there. In fast passages, she can
become mechanical.</TE>
<TE>   In the lyrical ones (where you get a juicy love theme from
"Anthony Adverse" and other Korngold-scored films), she lays on a
slick, thick vibrato as if that is what a movie cliche calls for.
Heifetz proved just the opposite with this concerto. But, then,
Heifetz never played to empty houses, and maybe Clarke was just
overcompensating.</TE>
<TE>   Utah Symphony, with Keith Lockhart, Thursday, 8 p.m., Pasadena
Civic Auditorium, 300 E. Green St., Pasadena, $20-$55. (213)
365-3500. Also Friday, 8 p.m., Lobero Theatre, 33 E. Canon Perdido,
Santa Barbara $32.50-$37.50 (805) 963-0761.</TE>

<LD>Somewhere out there, there's got to be an outtake reel of film that
reveals a very different Huell Howser.</LD>
<LD>   Not the relentlessly sunny host of KCET's "Road Trip," but someone
who screams at the cameraman, yawns during a local official's
anecdote and spits out the blue-plate special at the town diner.
Could that be the real Howser?</LD>
<LD>   Don't count on it. Either he's the finest actor working today or
Howser's warmth and sincerity are the real deal, the cornerstones
that make his weekly travelogue a pleasure to watch regardless of the
destination.</LD>
<TE>   Tonight at 8, Howser sets off for exotic Riverside, where he mines
enough interesting nuggets to keep the hourlong program rolling
merrily along. His easy drawl and infectious enthusiasm carry the day
during stops at a citrus park, the Mission Inn and the historic
downtown district. And he caps segments the way only Huell can: "You
never know what you're going to find when you come to the Museum of
Photography in Riverside!"</TE>
<TE>   The show, written and produced by Howser, is preceded at 7:30 p.m.
on KCET by one of his new efforts, "Our Neighborhoods," a monthly
program that showcases Southland life in all its varieties. Produced
in conjunction with cable outlet LA CityView, tonight's program
unfolds in Glendale.</TE>
<TE>   With Howser as a traveling companion, any trip is one worth
taking.</TE>

<DH>Comedian Matt Besser rails against humanity's dumber side.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I've been getting phone calls for my deceased mother again. Just a
few, but enough to unnerve me and wish that I had some retort handy,
some snide line I could commit to memory. The people calling, of
course, want to sell my mother things, or renew her contribution to a
cause, or improve her long-distance service. Modern life offers up
many wonderful things, but the unsolicited phone call from the
telemarketer, asking if your late mother is home, and mispronouncing
her name in the bargain, is not one of them.</LD>
<LD>   Matt Besser, at least, offers some vicarious revenge. His one-man
comedy show, "Don't Be a Dick," currently running at the Improv
Olympic West in Hollywood, chronicles, among other things, the
homemade war Besser waged with another invasive side effect of
technology.</LD>
<LD>   Two years ago, Besser discovered that his New York City phone
number had been co-opted by a major Internet provider called Spinway,
which was using his number as its tech support hotline. That line was
in Houston, but if you didn't dial a 1 before the area code, you got
Besser's apartment.</LD>
<TE>   The calls were coming 20 a day, Besser says, and after pleading
with the Internet company to rectify the problem, he took matters
into his own hands. Besser could have changed his phone number, but
as he explains, he had a 212 prefix and wasn't about to give it up
for the less glitzy 646.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Besser began dispensing his own sort of tech support.
People would call with problems, and he would ask them to name their
favorite color (this became their "F.C." number, as in favorite color
number, which Besser urged the caller to write down for future
reference). He invented other outrageous, labyrinthine scenarios with
callers, then recorded the conversations for public amusement, which
formed the basis for "May I Help You ... Dumbass," a live show and CD
that captured Besser's career as a phony tech support hotline guy.</TE>
<TE>   Most amazing is that people actually stayed on the line with him.</TE>
<TE>   "I had my own little code of ethics....If they were Hispanic I
wouldn't screw with them, because I figured they might not know [to]
dial 1 before the area code," Besser says. "They might've lived in
New York City their entire life [but] don't know anyone outside the
city, except when they dial Mexico, which is a whole different
thing....But if any white man's calling me, I was screwing with
them."</TE>
<TE>   Besser, 33, is a comedian with a keen iconoclastic streak. This is
betrayed, somehow, by his hair, a shock of brown curls that once
prompted a producer to say he had "TV hair," which was evidently a
compliment.</TE>
<TE>   For 10 years, Besser was a member of the comedy troupe the Upright
Citizens Brigade, a band of social pranksters and improvisational
performers who came together in Chicago after working with the late
Del Close, a legendary Second City alumnus and guru of a more
challenging form of improv.</TE>
<TE>   The Upright Citizens Brigade landed its own TV show on cable's
Comedy Central from 1998-2000. Unable to land a broadcast network
slot, the group recently dispersed; Amy Poehler is now a cast member
on "Saturday Night Live," and Matt Walsh is a correspondent on "The
Daily Show."</TE>
<TE>   What still exists is the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in New
York, a breeding ground for up-and-coming performers. Besser, for his
part, is temporarily in Los Angeles, renting an apartment with his
girlfriend and, for the second year in a row, making himself
available for pilot season--that months-long period of auditions and
studio drive-on passes whereby actors hope, come spring, to get cast
in a comedy or drama.</TE>
<TE>   "The janitor thing got to be crazy last year," Besser said of the
numerous janitor roles for which he got callbacks.</TE>
<TE>   To fill the creative void, Besser is doing "Don't Be a Dick" at
the Improv Olympic through April 24. It has evolved from "May I Help
You ...," which Besser performed in Los Angeles last year.</TE>
<TE>   Note the running indignation in the shows' titles. Besser is drawn
to moral outrage, his own and anyone else's. He has collected letters
to the editor for years--from newspapers and magazines--seeing in
them a repository of misplaced anger, an oral history, in its way, of
what truly plagues modern man.In his act, these letters become
performance pieces; Besser assumes the writer's indignation and
cross-pollinates the letter with different genres for comedic effect.
There is his rhyming ode to Carol Blair, who complained in her local
newspaper that a children's poetry contest was woefully lacking in
rhyming stanzas. In another, Besser screams a letter about improper
usage of the word "bale" to a punk rock song. "Don't Be a Dick" is
about anger, but it's not mean-spirited; Besser's rage is mostly
reserved for things that can be fixed but never will be, for the
bureaucracy of contemporary life and for the idiocy that's only ever
a phone call away.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't Be a Dick," Wednesdays through April 24. Improv Olympic
West, 6366 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood, 8 p.m. $10.</TE>

<HD>An Intimate Bergman Gem</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rarely does cinema transform into something poetic. But that is the
case with Ingmar Bergman's "Wild Strawberries" (1957), one of his
masterpieces.</LD>
<LD>   This haunting, lyrical drama arrives on DVD ($40) in a lovely new
disc from Criterion that won't disappoint the admirers of the Swedish
director.</LD>
<LD>   Victor Sjostrom, who directed several silent films including "The
Wind" with Lillian Gish, stars in the intimate film as an elderly
college professor beset with nightmares of death and images from his
past. Scheduled to receive an honorary degree from a university, he
decides to drive to the ceremony in his car instead of taking a
plane. Joining him on the excursion is his troubled daughter-in-law
(Ingrid Thulin). Bibi Andersson also stars in a dual role: as the
love of his life in flashbacks and as a young hitchhiker in the
present.</LD>
<TE>   The DVD features a beautiful, new digital transfer of the
exquisite black-and-white film, a new and improved subtitle
translation and informative commentary from film scholar Peter Cowie,
who discusses the genesis of the project. Bergman was at an emotional
crossroads in his life at this time, suffered from the same
nightmares as Sjostrom's Isak Borg and had difficulties working with
Sjostrom, who was 79 and didn't like someone else being in charge.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the DVD are several behind-the-scenes stills and
"Ingmar Bergman on Life and Work," a 90-minute documentary by
filmmaker and author Jorn Donner that aired on Swedish TV in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "Wild Strawberries" is a movie to savor like a fine wine, one that
becomes richer and more rewarding on subsequent viewings.</TE>
<TE>   The same can't be said of "Don't Say a Word," a fitfully
entertaining but ultimately forgettable suspense thriller starring
Michael Douglas as a successful shrink who must get a mental patient
(Brittany Murphy) to disclose a series of numbers. At stake: the life
of his daughter, who has been kidnapped.</TE>
<TE>   The digital edition ($28) includes the wide-screen version of the
film, trailers, a so-so "making of" featurette, several deleted
scenes, a tour of the sets, a featurette on the score,
storyboard-to-film comparison, screening room dailies and Murphy's
evocative screen test.</TE>
<TE>   Director Gary Fleder offers commentary, but much more entertaining
are the scene-specific commentaries by Douglas, Murphy and co-stars
Famke Janssen, Sean Bean and Oliver Platt. The thespians seemed to
have put a lot of thought into their characters and offer up some
intelligent insights into the production.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Blake Nelson, who played the dimwitted convict in "O Brother,
Where Art Thou?," directed "O," the controversial updating of
Shakespeare's tragedy "Othello," set in the arena of high school
basketball. Mekhi Phifer plays Odin James, a star basketball player;
Julia Stiles is his girlfriend Desi; and Josh Hartnett is the
conniving Hugo.</TE>
<TE>   Lions Gate is releasing "O" ($25) in a special two-disc DVD set
that includes low-key commentary from Nelson and cinematographer
Russell Lee Fine, a breakdown of the staging of the basketball
sequences, passable interviews with Stiles, Phifer, Hartnett and
Nelson, several deleted scenes, trailers and the superior 1922 silent
German version of "Othello," starring Emil Jannings.</TE>
<TE>   In 1974, independent filmmaker H.B. "Toby" Halicki starred in,
wrote, directed and produced the action flick "Gone in 60 Seconds,"
which featured incredible car stunts. The low-budget film went on to
make $40 million.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Disney produced a big-budget remake with Nicolas
Cage. Halicki died in a freak accident on the set of "Gone in 60
Seconds II" in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   This week the Navarre Corp. has released Halicki's 1982 action
film "The Junkman" ($25 for DVD; $15 for VHS). As with "Gone in 60
Seconds," the movie suffers from a poor script and listless acting.
But Halicki knew how to stage stunts--he performed most of the stunt
driving in the film. There are some amazing scenes, including a car
jumping over an airplane.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD features a restored, digitally remastered version of the
film; an introduction by Halicki's widow, Denise; a 25-minute
featurette, "The Making of the Junkman," hosted by Toby Halicki;
original trailers; 300 photographs; and interviews with the film's
editor, Warner E. Leighton, assistant editor P.G. Webbs, custom car
designer George Barris and director of photography Tony Syslo.</TE>
<TE>   Syslo and production manager Jack Vacek provide the pleasant audio
commentary. The VHS includes the film, the intro and the trailer.</TE>
<TE>   New from Facets Video is the exceptional drama "Close-Up" (DVD and
VHS, $30) from Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami ("Taste of Cherry").
Based on fact, this simple story deals with a young, unemployed
Iranian man who loves the films of director Mohsen Makhmalbaf
("Kandahar"). While traveling on a bus one day, he represents himself
as the director to a woman passenger. He ingratiates himself into her
family and promises to make his latest movie with them. The DVD
features filmographies and an interview with Kiarostami.</TE>
<TE>   The Autry Museum of Western Heritage and Gene Autry Entertainment
are releasing the movies of the legendary singing movie cowboy Gene
Autry on VHS. Seven titles are currently available for $10 each or
$60 for the set. Beautifully restored and uncut, the entertaining
musical westerns featured in the collection are: "Heart of Rio
Grande," "Home on the Range," "Robin Hood of Texas," "Rovin'
Tumbleweeds," "Shooting High," "South of the Border" and "Under
Fiesta Stars."  The films are available at the Autry Museum's store;
(888) 41-AUTRY and www.autry-museum.org</TE>

<HD>How Do We Cope? Less and Less Every Day</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>YOSSI KLEIN HALEVI</AU>
<BD>Yossi Klein Halevi is the Israel correspondent for the
New Republic and a senior writer for the Jerusalem Report.</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Until a few weeks ago, this was a city pretending to be normal. We
managed our daily routines around sporadic terror attacks, the
inevitable price we told ourselves for living in a city blessed and
cursed with an excess of history.</LD>
<LD>   But after the recent wave of suicide bombings and shootings, and
almost daily attempts by terrorists to strike again, Jerusalemites
have finally conceded that we are a city at war.</LD>
<LD>   Daily life has itself become the threat: a crowded street corner,
an outing at a pizza shop, a bat mitzvah celebration. It is a war
without limits: This month, terrorists broke into a house in the
Jordan Valley and killed a woman and her 11-year-old handicapped
daughter as the child tried to crawl away.</LD>
<TE>   Until recently, my wife and I attempted to confine our two teenage
children to areas we assumed were less likely to become targets. But
in the last weeks our children have had so many close calls that
we've stopped trying to outguess the terrorists. There is nowhere to
run.</TE>
<TE>   The other day my family, seeking respite, went to the botanical
gardens overlooking the tent-shaped hills of the Judean desert.</TE>
<TE>   Almost as soon as we arrived, we heard an ambulance siren.
Instinctively, my wife and I began to silently count. By the third
siren, we knew. Afterward we learned that a suicide bomber, stopped
by a police roadblock on his way to Jerusalem, had blown himself up
and killed a policeman, just up the road from where we were
strolling.</TE>
<TE>   How do you cope, ask friends from abroad. The answer is: less and
less. Living under sustained terrorism creates an emotional circle
from dread to fatalism to numbness, back to dread.</TE>
<TE>   After 18 months of accelerating terrorist attacks, this is a
nation in despair.</TE>
<TE>   Until the Oslo peace process, Israelis were sustained by the hope
that the Arab world would ultimately accept our existence. But now we
increasingly ask ourselves whether the Middle East will ever tolerate
the lone non-Arab state in its midst.</TE>
<TE>   Having offered to end the occupation, only to be confronted with
the worst wave of terrorism in our terror-saturated history, Israelis
no longer believe in a negotiated peace. Even the left now calls for
"separation"--unilateral withdrawal from the West Bank, an admission
that a deal cannot be reached with Yasser Arafat's regime. Still,
separation, however tempting, isn't a solution but a desperate
impulse. Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon nearly two years ago
encouraged the Palestinians to mimic the fundamentalist Hezbollah and
launch the current intifada. Withdrawal under fire from the
territories would only encourage the terrorists to pursue their war
against the Jewish "occupation" of the rest of what they call
Palestine and we call Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The threats are gathering from every direction. If the United
States attacks Iraq, warns Israeli military intelligence, Saddam
Hussein will almost certainly retaliate against us. The Israeli army
is quietly preparing for a nonconventional missile attack on our
cities.</TE>
<TE>   Hezbollah has begun shooting at Israeli planes flying within our
airspace along the northern border. And Turkish police have arrested
three Al Qaeda operatives, apparently on their way to a planned
attack in Tel Aviv.</TE>
<TE>   The army's chief chaplain, expecting massive casualties in the
coming months, plans to train volunteers to assist rabbis in Jewish
burial procedures, recalling the weeks before the 1967 Six-Day War,
when the army, fearing an Arab invasion, dug trenches in public parks
for possible use as mass graves.</TE>
<TE>   If Arafat's terrorist war does evolve into a wider Arab assault,
including attempts to wipe out Israeli cities, that escalation will
have its own terrible logic. For the terrorist act is an expression
of the genocidal impulse, a small pre-enactment of mass murder.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, perhaps, the very realization that we face an enemy
whose goal isn't to live beside us but instead of us helps us
persevere through yet another day.</TE>

<HD>Our Best Insurance: A Little Knowledge</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LINK</AU>
<BD>David Link, an attorney in Pasadena, worked for the
state Senate Insurance Committee that investigated Commissioner Chuck
Quackenbush.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's Feb. 21. Do you know where your insurance commissioner is?</LD>
<LD>   Or more important, do you know who your insurance commissioner is
going to be?</LD>
<LD>   In less than two weeks, voters will go to the polls in statewide
primaries, and one of the decisions they will make is whom to
nominate to regulate California's massive insurance industry.</LD>
<TE>   Yet how many voters know who is running or what he or she is
likely to do if elected?</TE>
<TE>   It has been a little less than two years since Chuck Quackenbush
resigned as commissioner after one of the biggest political scandals
in California. It's likely that he was elected only because of
political apathy.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, with the backing of the insurance industry and a
media-friendly face, Quackenbush seemed like a pleasant enough guy in
his commercials. What possible harm could he do in one of the
lowest-profile statewide jobs in the state of California?</TE>
<TE>   Well, a lot, it turned out. Insurance is a complicated and
well-developed industry with high-power players and a lot of money
and influence. The commissioner's job is far from insignificant.</TE>
<TE>   When first elected, Quackenbush had little experience in
insurance. He surrounded himself with political hacks and sycophants
who eventually helped him alienate not only consumers but the
industry itself.</TE>
<TE>   Yet what made the scandal possible was the office's low profile.
Quackenbush lusted for higher office. So his cronies--confident that
no one was paying much attention--tried to leverage his position with
big-donor insurance companies to get him the money and influence he
would need to run for something bigger and better in the future.</TE>
<TE>   If Californians should have learned anything from his disastrous
tenure, it's that they are ultimately the ones making the decision
about who holds the office, so they should not go blindly into the
voting booth.</TE>
<TE>   So far, however, with a competitive race for governor looming, the
contest for insurance commissioner has had an even lower profile than
in years past.</TE>
<TE>   So who's on the primary ballot? The fact that the question still
needs to be asked demonstrates how much work voters need to do.
Regrettably, television commercials will again provide most of what
voters will know about the candidates.</TE>
<TE>   In a field of 11 candidates, there are two Democratic
front-runners and a Republican who has volunteered to go to the
slaughter. Democrats will choose between two candidates with solid
experience: Assembly member Tom Calderon (www.tomcalderon.com), chair
of the Assembly Insurance Committee, and John Garamendi
(www.garamendi.org), who served as California's first elected
insurance commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   Like Chuck Quackenbush, Calderon has agreed to accept insurance
industry money for his campaign, while Garamendi, who can rely in
part on his name recognition, says he will not take money from the
industry he is supposed to regulate.</TE>
<TE>   Quackenbush has made the field toxic for Republicans. The only
likely Republican contender--Gary Mendoza, who served as corporations
commissioner under Pete Wilson--has chances that are, at best, bleak.
So bleak, in fact, that he has not posted a campaign Web site.</TE>
<TE>   One of these guys will be the next commissioner, and it makes a
difference which one.</TE>
<TE>   There are few Californians who do not have insurance of some
kind--for their home, their automobiles, their health care. The
insurance commissioner is one of the few state elected officials
whose actions affect people every day in a tangible way.</TE>
<TE>   The staff the commissioner chooses will shape the insurance
industry for years to come on issues ranging from workers'
compensation to the California Earthquake Authority to
consumer-protection matters that are the bread and butter of the
Department of Insurance staff.</TE>
<TE>   No one should enter the voting booth March 5 without a strong
sense of the importance of what he or she is doing. We have made a
mess of the post of insurance commissioner in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Let's hope we have learned from our mistakes and will be a bit
more ready to cast an informed vote this time.</TE>

<HD>The U.S. Needs Russia to Help Contain Iran</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRENDA SHAFFER</AU>
<BD>Brenda Shaffer, research director at the Caspian
studies program at Harvard University, is the author of "Partners in
Need: the Strategic Relationship of Russia and Iran" (The Washington
Institute for Near East Policy, 2001).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush didn't leave much room for interpretation when he
declared Iran a part of an "axis of evil." What wasn't clear was
whether the U.S. is willing to go beyond tough rhetoric and take
concrete steps to stop Iran from obtaining weapons of mass
destruction.</LD>
<LD>   One of the ways for the United States to prevent Tehran from
developing these weapons is for Washington to address one of the
sources of Iran's proliferation advances: Russia. Over the past
decade, various government ministries and defense companies in Russia
have contributed significantly to Iran's advancement toward
acquisition of these weapons.</LD>
<LD>   Washington is beginning to forge a new strategic framework for its
relations with Moscow. This new deal should require that Russia
curtail its cooperation with Iran in areas that could enhance
Tehran's ability to acquire weapons of mass destruction. For the U.S.
to succeed on this front, it must understand the importance that
Russia attaches to its relations with Iran and offer significant
trade-offs that will help Moscow.</LD>
<TE>   After the collapse of the Soviet Union, a momentous opportunity
emerged for U.S.-Russia cooperation. There are different explanations
as to which side is more at fault for the failure of this partnership
to develop. It is clear that both failed to demonstrate significant
consideration for the other's security needs and continued to
interact in a competitive manner.</TE>
<TE>   American policymakers have been upset with Russia's cooperation
with Iran in areas that help Tehran acquire nuclear weapons. Russian
leaders have been disappointed by Washington's promotion of the
expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization into Eastern
Europe and its decision to unilaterally pursue a national missile
defense system.</TE>
<TE>   However, it is now time for a new and mutually beneficial
strategic deal between Russia and the U.S. An important component
would be the issue of proliferation in Iran.</TE>
<TE>   In the last 11/2 years, Russia has shown signs that it recognizes
that it has some common interests with the U.S. on energy and
security issues. Russia's refusal in November to cut back its oil
production in accordance with OPEC demands has prevented the world
economy from plummeting deeper into recession. In addition, Russia
has removed its active opposition to the building of the Baku-Ceyhan
pipeline for transport of Caspian oil.</TE>
<TE>   On security issues, not only has Moscow mobilized full-fledged
support for the war on terrorism, it has permitted an extensive U.S.
military presence in Central Asia. The Russian government also has
made efforts to establish export controls to rein in some of the
proliferation activities of Russian companies.</TE>
<TE>   Russia, however, has not been willing to compromise its
cooperation with Iran. Moscow views its neighbor Iran as an important
partner in maintaining stability in the Caucasus and Central Asia,
and Tehran plays the leading role in minimizing Muslim backlash
against Moscow for its military campaigns in Chechnya. Iran and
Moscow also see each other as important "poles" in maintaining a
multi-polar international system and preventing U.S. hegemony. Thus,
Moscow will be reluctant to endanger its relations with Iran,
especially if it appears that Russia is reacting to U.S. pressure.</TE>
<TE>   But a strategic reformation that includes concessions by
Washington on issues of the highest order that affect Russian
national security--such as missile defense and further expansion of
NATO--ultimately could lead to an important change in the nature of
Moscow's cooperation with Iran.</TE>
<TE>   As part of a new deal with Russia, the U.S. should focus on
preventing the transfer of a limited number of sensitive items that
could contribute most seriously to the advancement of Iran's nuclear
weapons programs. The U.S. should not oppose all military cooperation
between Russia and Iran, such as pacts on conventional weapons. The
U.S. should not do anything to weaken political relations between
Iran and Russia, and instead focus only on proliferation issues.
Washington would benefit from initiating quiet diplomacy with Russian
President Vladimir V. Putin on the issue of Iran, without making it
seem like a Russian concession to U.S. demands.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has signaled to the world that he wants to get tough with
those who dabble with weapons of mass destruction. The administration
now needs to go beyond words and threats and work intelligently with
Russia to contain Iran's drive for such weapons.</TE>

<HD>In the Shadow of Terror, Give a Gold Medal for Human Ideals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NORAH VINCENT</AU>
<BD>Norah Vincent is a senior fellow at the Foundation for
the Defense of Democracies, a think tank set up after Sept. 11 to
study terrorism.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Why do they do it?</LD>
<LD>   I ask myself that question every time the Olympics roll around,
because the idea that anyone would spend his entire life preparing
for what he may--or, more likely, will fail to--achieve in a few
tenths of a second strikes me as an unconscionable waste of energy
and time.</LD>
<LD>   That, or a miracle of will and desire that is almost beyond
fathoming. I can't decide which.</LD>
<TE>   Is it sublime or ridiculous? Worthless or profound?</TE>
<TE>   Does that fleeting yet somehow eternal competitive instant mean
nothing in the grand scheme of things? Or is it itself the grand
scheme of things?</TE>
<TE>   Is this level of athletic competition the ultimate distraction
from real life? Or is it a form of prayer?</TE>
<TE>   We in the stands or watching the screens have always asked these
questions about Olympians, since unlike other athletes or artists or
experts in many fields, their chances at glory are so few, their
moments to shine so bitterly brief and subject to mischance.</TE>
<TE>   But coming as this Olympics does in the midst of the war on terror
and so soon after Sept. 11, the enigmas of achievement seem more
relevant than ever. More relevant than they have since the last time
the low battles and exalted contests of international politics met at
the Munich games in 1972, during which Israeli athletes were taken
hostage and murdered by Palestinian terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Terrorism and the Olympics are, in a sense, moral antipodes, two
equally puzzling expressions of global conflict, two manifestations
of human nature's wondrous and awful extremes: the one, an unwavering
ascent toward cooperative excellence; the other, an unfaltering
descent into chaos and destruction.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, they prove that William Butler Yeats was wrong; the best
are every bit as full of passionate intensity as the worst. Both are
fighting like hell in pursuit of the clarion call of some higher
purpose, some sacrifice worth striving for.</TE>
<TE>   Now you may say that the spirit on display this year in Salt Lake
City is nothing so mystical and lofty as faith and nothing so
powerful as to negate the despair of a planet savaged by terrorist
cruelty. But what ascetic monk's discipline, single-minded devotion,
self-denial, dedication and pure desire is greater than any Olympic
champion's? Certainly his tangible rewards are no less, his spiritual
rewards arguably no more.</TE>
<TE>   Is the Olympian's way of life not in some sense a pursuit of the
divine--or at least isn't it a baffling act of grace, a clear
manifestation of our nature's better angels?</TE>
<TE>   Can we categorically deny that a figure skater's flawlessly
executed short program or a downhill skier's peerless slalom run in
record time is evidence, however small, of perfection and the human
ability to attain it? Who among us can fairly call this
insignificant?</TE>
<TE>   And who can say that it is not at least an inkling of an
inexplicable force for good at work in our otherwise uninspired
lives?</TE>
<TE>   As much as Olympic events are only sports, and sports at bottom
are only games, there is something more than pure ambition fueling
the athlete's zeal.</TE>
<TE>   It's not money. It's not professional status.</TE>
<TE>   It's not even fame, for that is as fleeting as the ceremony. It's
something altogether more ethereal.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever that thing is--call it an irrepressible desire for an
ideal, a determined hand reaching always beyond its grasp--it is as
stubbornly recurrent a part of us as every deadly sin.</TE>
<TE>   And for that reason alone, it might prove a hopeful antidote to
carry us through these awful days.</TE>

<LD>   Word has it Los Lobos will have their first studio album in three
years ready for release in June, which makes the venerable East L.A.
band's stop at the House of Blues more tantalizing than usual. Be on
the lookout for "Good Morning Atzlan," a song David Hidalgo brought
into the recording session late in the game, but which band members
liked so much they reorganized the album around it and chose it as
the title track.</LD>

<TE>   Bored? Suburban living got you down? Do you yearn for a place
where the bright lights shine and mass transit hums? Well, Anton
Chekhov anticipated what ails you by a good century. "The Three
Sisters," produced in 1901, concerns Olga, Masha and Irina Prozorov,
who languish in a Godforsaken provincial backwater and spend the
entire play yearning for a transfer to that happenin' hub of culture
and social grace, Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   While the sisters moon about, their brother, Andrei, gambles away
the family fortune, and his horrible wife, Natalya--as happy as a
duck in water here in Nowheresville--takes over the household.
Soldiers from the local garrison hang around, trying to add a little
gaiety to these deeply disappointed lives.</TE>
<TE>   So as you see, fellow suburbanites, you could have it a lot worse.</TE>
<TE>   "The Three Sisters," Vanguard Theatre Ensemble, 699A State College
Blvd., Fullerton. Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 5 p.m. $13 to
$15, $5 student rush tickets. Ends March 23. (714) 526-8007.</TE>

<TE>   Auf weidersehen, Werner Heisenberg. Wilkommen, Wilhelm
Furtwangler. 'Tis the season for Orange County theatergoers to watch
German geniuses get turned into moral pretzels because of the Third
Reich. We just got through watching Laguna Playhouse's production of
Michael Frayn's "Copenhagen," in which Heisenberg, the Nobel
prize-winning physicist, was seen trying to defend his actions as
head of the Nazis' nuclear research team.</TE>
<TE>   Now comes the Rude Guerrilla Theater Company with "Taking Sides."
The 1995 play by Ronald Harwood, who also wrote "The Dresser,"
imagines Furtwangler, the gifted conductor of the Berlin
Philharmonic, being grilled by a zealous American military
investigator who wants to indict him as a Nazi collaborator.
Furtwangler, never a party member, casts himself as a champion of
enlightenment during dark times--and one who helped Jewish musicians
escape with their lives. But the play raises the question of whether
great artists have a duty to get out or resist rather than continue
creating under an evil regime that can claim their work for its own
glory.</TE>
<TE>   "Taking Sides," Empire Theater, 200 N. Broadway, Santa Ana.
Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2:30 p.m. Also, March 14, 8 p.m.
$12 to $15. Ends March 17. (714) 547-4688.</TE>

<TE>   Peter Shaffer messes with the minds of audience and actors as he
plays with light and dark in his wacky farce "Black Comedy." It

When the lights come up on stage, it's because a blackout has just
occurred during a big bash at an artist's loft--and now the cast must
behave as if it is in the dark.</TE>
<TE>   "Black Comedy," Center Theater, 300 E. Ocean Blvd., Long Beach,
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 p.m. Ends March 17. $27 to
$35; opening night, $50 to $60. (562) 436-4610.</TE>

<TE>   Although they hail from Philadelphia, Philadanco ain't no cream
cheese. Instead, look for this 30-year-old dance ensemble on the
cutting edge of African American movement expression. The current
tour repertory features Jawole Willa Jo Zollar's "Hand Singing Song"
and Bebe Miller's "My Science," two works from the company's daringly
politicized "Messages From the Heart" program. David Brown's "Labess
II" and Ronald K. Brown's "Exotica" prove more conventionally
celebratory, but fasten your seat belts: In this kind of vehicle the
dancers become what an L.A. Times review called "the ultimate,
inexhaustible speed demons of modernism."</TE>
<TE>   Philadanco, Marsee Auditorium, El Camino College, 16007 Crenshaw

<HD>A Cradle of Civilized Dining for Tustin</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN BOOE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the East Coast, especially in New York, if you find yourself in
what appears to be an old-fashioned American diner, there's a pretty
good chance it's Greek-run and owned. Such places are likely to have
a long menu, including hamburgers, meatloaf and pot roast, but if you
scratch just beneath the surface, you'll find classic Greek
specialties, like moussaka and pastitsio.</LD>
<LD>   I have no idea which particular wave of immigration launched so
many Greeks into the restaurant business, but their success in the
U.S. makes a certain amount of sense. Greeks like to grill and so do
Americans. Greeks favor plates composed of a trilogy of meat or fish,
vegetables and a starch, and so do Americans. With Greek food, the
spices are different and there's a lot more garlic, but you can see
how Greek cooking easily adapted to American tastes, especially those
of a couple of generations ago. Both Greek and American food are
built on a foundation of simplicity and heartiness.</LD>
<TE>   Maybe it's because Greek restaurateurs did so well in the East
that California never benefited from the same surfeit of culinary
Hellenism. There just aren't all that many Greek restaurants in these
parts, so it's all the more of a joy to find one that serves up
authenticity in fine fashion. That's exactly what you'll get if you
go to Christakis in Tustin. The place has been around awhile. It used
to be Tony and Maria's, until the Christakis family took over six
years ago. The menu is derived from family recipes, and it shows, in
all the best ways. Although the restaurant may wear the colors of the
blue-and-white Greek flag on its sleeve, and live Greek music and
belly dancing is featured Friday and Saturday nights, this is no
theme restaurant for the armchair tourist. The emphasis is solidly on
the food.</TE>
<TE>   The list of appetizers includes just about every Greek favorite
you can name, and they're all good. There's a world of bad dolmades
out there, but the stuffed grape leaves here are a peak experience.
The leaves taste much fresher than the usual soggy specimens you find
elsewhere; I suspect the restaurant brines its own. The savory
filling of ground sirloin and rice is nicely packed, giving these
stuffed grape leaves a satisfying bite. Even better, they're served
warm and slathered in a light yogurt sauce laced with dill. The
hummus at Christakis is packed with enough garlic to get you exiled
to Tierra del Fuego, but it's worth it. Similarly amped up is
melitzanosalata (or eggplant spread, for short). Some may find
taramosalata, a puree of red carp roe, onion, lemon and olive oil, to
be at the extreme end of the flavor spectrum, but dipping a triangle
of pita bread into it, I find joy in its unapologetic brininess.</TE>
<TE>   Calamari is a dish that has of late been widely co-opted as a
popcorn-like finger food, all crunch and no taste. But if you want
the real thing, this is the place. The quality of the squid is
first-rate and these deep-fried rings of lightly breaded calamari are
succulent and tender.</TE>
<TE>   And who can resist saganaki, slabs of tangy kefalotiri cheese,
dredged in flour, fried, flambeed with brandy and drizzled with lemon
juice? Here it's done to perfection. The cheese has a wonderful
steak-like consistency, crisp on the outside and soft within.</TE>
<TE>   As far as I'm concerned, there's a two-pronged acid test for any
Greek restaurant: moussaka and lamb. At Christakis, both are superb.
With alternating layers of eggplant and ground lamb seasoned with
nutmeg, oregano and a hint of cloves, and crowned with a creamy
bechamel, moussaka is the Greek answer to lasagna. This version,
which tastes like its flavors have had time to mingle overnight or
longer (as it should), is a home run. Savory and moist, it is pure
comfort food.</TE>
<TE>   And I can't say enough about the charbroiled rack of lamb.
Weighing in at 18 ounces, it's almost enough for two, and the quality
of the lamb is excellent. Served medium rare as ordered, it's tender,
weepy with juice, and redolent of its oregano, white-wine, and
olive-oil marinade, justifying its $27.95 price tag.</TE>
<TE>   Less successful is the arni psito, thin slices of well-done leg of
lamb in a stout gravy. The meat is certainly soft, but the flavor of
the lamb is lost; you could just as well be eating pot roast.</TE>
<TE>   Seafood lovers will fare well at Christakis. Garides souvlaki are
jumbo shrimp marinated in the Greek trinity of lemon, olive oil and
oregano, then skewered and charbroiled. On my visit, though they were
slightly overdone, they were nevertheless plump and flavorful.
Although I prefer swordfish grilled, the pan-fried version here is a
winner. The fish is lightly dredged in flour and sauteed in olive
oil, giving it a nice crust that seals in the juices. Its flavor is
further enhanced by a drizzling of lemon juice and white wine. I
don't know it there's anything particularly Greek about a New York
steak, but if you're in the mood for beef, you could hardly do
better. It's prime, expertly grilled, and carries a hint of oregano.</TE>
<TE>   For dessert, do not pass "go" before you've had the
galaktobouriko. I thought baklava was the alpha and omega of Greek
sweets (and the baklava here is fine), but this is new to me. It's
custard baked in a thin sheath of filo dough, which adds a nice
textural contrast, and it's doused in a light honey sauce. But what
makes this spectacular, and spectacularly aromatic, is that it's
beautifully infused with cloves, a flavor that is pushed to the
limit, but pulls up just short of overwhelming the custard.</TE>
<TE>   Christakis, 13011 Newport Ave. in Lafayette Plaza. (714) 731-1179.
Open for lunch Monday-Friday, 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Open daily for
dinner, 5-9:30 p.m., and until 10 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. Beer
and wine. Dinner: Appetizers $5.95-$10.95. Entrees $7.95-$27.95.</TE>

<LD>Just as many enterprises have been opening downtown in recent months,
others have been closing--some temporarily, some for good. Here's a
quick look at four erstwhile attractions you shouldn't expect to see
downtown, at least not right away.</LD>
<LD>   For other downtown information, including upcoming events, parking
and driving directions, check any of these Web sites:
www.downtownla.com, www.downtownnews.com or www.newdowntown.com.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels Flight Railway</LD>
<TE>   The short, historic two-rail-car funicular that climbs Bunker Hill
from Hill Street (between 3rd and 4th streets) has been closed since
an accident killed one passenger and injured seven others in February
2001. The Angels Flight Railway Assn. has pledged a reopening this
year but set no date. (213) 808-2273.</TE>
<TE>   Children's Museum</TE>
<TE>   of Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   After more than 20 years at 310 N. Main St., the museum closed in
August 2000, planning to reopen later at two new sites. One is
downtown, 11/2 acres near the Japanese American National Museum in
Little Tokyo (groundbreaking forecast for 2003, opening for 2005).
The other is a one-acre site at Hansen Dam in Pacoima
(ground-breaking scheduled for this summer, opening forecast for
2004). A spokeswoman said those projects together carry a
$100-million price tag, of which the museum has about $20 million in
hand. (213) 687-8800, Ext. 124; www.childrensmuseumla.org.</TE>
<TE>   Al's Bar</TE>
<TE>   Beloved and battered through the 1980s and '90s as a watering hole
and performance venue for downtown artists and rock musicians, Al's
Bar closed in August after its building on South Hewitt Street, just
off Traction Avenue, was sold.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Times'</TE>
<TE>   Globe Lobby</TE>
<TE>   The newspaper's Globe Lobby, which faces 1st Street near its
intersection with Spring Street, is dominated by a slowly spinning
Art Deco planet Earth and has served for decades as the public window
onto the newspaper. Heightened security measures since Sept. 11 have
caused its closure to the public, though  tours of the building are
still offered. (213) 237-5757.</TE>

<HD>Tchaikovsky and Cliburn, Together Again</HD>
<DH>The celebrated pianist will make a rare appearance Friday
with New West Symphony.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are many great living performers in the classical music world,
some of whom have broken through the barrier that separates the
rarefied classical scene from general public acclaim. But few can
boast the name cachet or enigmatic intrigue of Van Cliburn, who
performs with the New West Symphony on Friday, after postponing his
original appearance here in the post-traumatic days of September.</LD>
<LD>   It's fair to say it will be a highlight of the season.</LD>
<LD>   For all his obvious virtuosity, Van Cliburn's name has partly
ascended to a superhuman level on the basis of a sociopolitical
triumph. He was just 23, a talented Texan studying at Juilliard, when
he won first prize in the first International Tchaikovsky Piano
Competition in Russia in 1958. That an American won during the Cold
War, in Russia and on the theme of one of the great Russian
composers, turned him into a hero of sorts. Dubbed as "the American
Sputnik," he was welcomed back home as a conquering hero worthy of a
ticker-tape parade in New York.</LD>
<TE>   Since then, he has been something of a national treasure,
performing for presidents and establishing his own influential Van
Cliburn International Piano Competition in 1962. It occurs once every
four years and has become one of the most prestigious of such events
in the country.</TE>
<TE>   But his career has hardly been a typical one: Like the great and
reclusive pianist Glenn Gould, Cliburn announced suddenly that he was
retiring from the stage, 20 years after his auspicious Russian
encounter. As he told a journalist, "Classical musicians are not like
entertainers," citing a need for the reserved musician to retreat
from the glare of public life. He didn't perform at all until 1987,
when he showed up at a White House event honoring Mikhail Gorbachev,
fittingly enough. He has appeared only sparingly since then.</TE>
<TE>   One hallmark of his career has been his steadfast embrace of
standard repertoire, and a clean and sober--which is to say,
revealing and non-showy--approach to interpretation. On Friday, he'll
return to the very piece, Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1, that
launched his career. It's also the piece with which his first
recording, in 1958, struck gold-platinum. In fact, it's the first
classical album to sell a million copies.</TE>
<TE>   As might be expected, tickets are anything but modest, with prices
for remaining seats at $200 and $150, but this is one of those rare
occasions to see a proverbial living legend.</TE>
<TE>   It's an all-Tchaikovsky evening, with the symphony taking on the
"Romeo and Juliet" Fantasy-Overture and Suite No. 1 from "Swan Lake,"
in addition to supporting its celebrated guest.</TE>
<TE>   *  Van Cliburn, with the New West Symphony, 8 p.m. Friday,
Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza's Kavli Theatre, 2100 E. Thousand Oaks
Blvd. Remaining tickets: $200 and $150. (805) 497-5800 or (800)

<TE>   Czech Affair: Los Robles Master Chorale, one of Ventura County's
most notable musical organizations, presents the highlight of its
current season with an ambitious program Saturday at the Civic Arts
Plaza. The title--"Dvorak!"--tells all, replete with exclamation
point and extra measures taken to ensure a gala evening.</TE>
<TE>   The great Czech composer, who also spent time in America and was
impressed enough to name his most famous piece "New World" Symphony,
is the subject here. His choral work is in focus, including his Mass
in D and his Te Deum. Countryman Bedrich Smetana's Czech folk songs
will be performed by Los Robles Children's Amadeus Choir.</TE>
<TE>   Guest conductor Miroslav Kosler, the director of the Prague Mixed
Choir, is on board for the concert.</TE>
<TE>   Also joining the choral ensemble will be the I Cantori Carmel
ensemble and the Conejo Civic Ballet Company, with choreography by
director Eva Pokorny--a Czech emigre living and teaching in Westlake
Village--to Dvorak's "Slavonic Dances."</TE>
<TE>   *  Los Robles Master Chorale, "Dvorak," Thousand Oaks Civic Arts
Plaza's Kavli Theatre, 2100 E. Thousand Oaks Blvd., Saturday, 8 p.m.
$15 to $30. (805) 583-8700.</TE>

<TE>   Rough Going: Eugene O'Neill's final, semiautobiographical play, "A
Moon for the Misbegotten" is not a happy-camper outing, with its
tormented tale of alcoholism, sexual impropriety and family
skeletons. But it's a gripping piece of theater, and the Santa Paula
Theater Center is taking it on, starting Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Rezac stars as Phil Hogan, the crusty father of Josie, played
by Michelle Wagner, engaging in a strained liaison with the drunken
James Tyrone Jr., played by Ron Feltner.</TE>
<TE>   The production is directed by Gerald Castillo, previously involved
in such Santa Paula Theater Center productions as "The Diary of Anne
Frank" and "Of Mice and Men."</TE>
<TE>   *  "A Moon for the Misbegotten," opening Friday at Santa Paula
Theater Center, 125 S. 7th St. Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m.;
Sundays, 2:30 p.m. Ends April 7. General, $15; senior citizens and
students, $12; children 10 and younger, $10. (805) 525-4645.</TE>

<HD>Destination Downtown</HD>
<DH>The city's urban core offers unexpected attractions: new
buildings, clubs, culture, restaurants, residences and even a
semi-open City Hall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Phase One of your introduction to the new downtown occurs on a sunny
weekday morning when you stand 27 floors above the largely cement
heart of Los Angeles, running your fingers over polished bronze and
gazing down upon courthouses and office towers and old buildings full
of new lofts. The city lies naked at your feet and, clearly, it's had
some work done.</LD>
<LD>   That includes the spot where you stand--atop City Hall's tower,
which has been closed to the public for years. After more than $300
million in seismic and cosmetic improvements that took up much of the
last decade, public tours of the 1928 landmark resumed in December.
Once again, mere mortals can tread in the footsteps of Joe Friday,
Clark Kent and Sam Yorty.</LD>
<LD>   Now forget those guys, forget the view and step along to Phase
Two. This comes on a Friday night, just a few blocks from City Hall
and a few yards from a gaggle of rowdy guys at the entrance to the
Jalisco Inn on South Main Street. It's late, it's dark, it's
disquieting. You ease your car into the lonely parking lot and a
homeless guy steps up to your window. You roll it down 3 inches.</LD>
<TE>   "The smell?" he says.</TE>
<TE>   "The smell," you affirm.</TE>
<TE>   So you park and give him a few bucks to keep an eye on your car,
and he points you toward an alley and the dumpster-adjacent door.
Inside, the interior design appears to have been done by squatters,
and somebody is rhythmically smashing a bucket. Yet your sense of
menace eases. Sketches are tacked to rough walls, arty people in
their 20s, 30s and 40s are milling around chatting, and a stenciled
sign announces what the homeless man has already told you: This is
the Smell, an all-ages den of art and alternative music on South Main
Street.</TE>
<TE>   There. At a cumulative cost of $5, you've glimpsed, from high and
low, two visions of what's new and renewed in Los Angeles' evolving
urban core.</TE>
<TE>   To hear the soundtrack of the changing downtown--it's a dissonant
piece of music, but spirited--you need only eavesdrop on one of the
Los Angeles Conservancy's Saturday morning walking tours. "It's just
the start of a whole new era," says tour guide Steve Gollis of
Hollywood, beaming as he looks across Grand Avenue at the
half-assembled Walt Disney Concert Hall. But the streets are still
quiet on the weekends, once the office crews have gone home. Some
visitors call it serene. But New Yorker James Montalbano, surveying
the scene at 4th Street and Grand Avenue, marvels, "There's nobody on
the street. It's just so unnerving."</TE>
<TE>   Those who have found new reasons to go downtown are dispersed at
the smattering of new places, all opened, reopened or expanded in the
last year: an architectural bookstore on Traction Avenue, a teen
techno-dance club in an old Broadway movie house and an Italian
restaurant where even the floorboards are imported.</TE>
<TE>   If you're an optimist, these mostly modest new attractions may
persuade you that downtown's long-promised brighter future is
arriving at last.</TE>
<TE>   If you're one of the millions who make a point of staying away
from the city core, well, think of this as the tale of a distant,
exotic land where someday you may be called to jury duty.</TE>
<TE>   The New Behemoths</TE>
<TE>   The marquee attractions in the new downtown, of course, are the
two behemoths-in-progress on Bunker Hill: the gleaming Disney Hall
(to be completed by late 2003, budgeted at $274 million) and the
dirt-clod-colored Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels (to be finished
this fall; budgeted at $163 million). Already, they're worth a quick
look--if only so you can someday say you've seen the skeleton beneath
Disney Hall's strange metal skin.</TE>
<TE>   The public can't get inside either site, but to take measure of
them on your own, you need only take a walk on Grand Avenue,
beginning at 3rd Street and heading north. On your left, there's
still time to see the frame and innards of Disney Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Guarnieri, a New Yorker taking in that very view after the
Los Angeles Conservancy's monthly "Downtown's Evolving Skyline"
walking tour, says she can't help but think of the World Trade
Center. "In New York, we're watching something be dismantled. And
you're watching something go up." As the group continues north past
the Music Center, Peter Panec, an architecture buff from Santa
Monica, catches site of the stark new cathedral. "Look!" he says. "A
new factory building downtown!"</TE>
<TE>   Whatever you think of the severe geometry of the exterior, you can
guess from the size and height of the windows that filtered light
will be a big part of the interior atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   Because the cathedral building is part of an enclosed complex
that's still a construction site at Temple Street and Grand Avenue,
you can't get any closer than the sidewalk. The concert hall and
cathedral make only cameo appearances in the Conservancy's skyline
tour, which puts the buildings in the context of the other growth on
Bunker Hill and points out some coming changes: the 1955 Superior Oil
building at 550 S. Flower St., which is to reopen in coming months as
a Standard Hotel, part of the trendy chain that includes the Standard
on the Sunset Strip.</TE>
<TE>   Conservancy tours run on the third Saturday of each month;
reservations required. Groups meet at 10 a.m. in the lobby of the
Millennium Biltmore Hotel and the cost is $8 to $10 for nonmembers.
(Information and reservations: [213] 623-CITY;
www.laconservancy.org.)</TE>
<TE>   The High Point</TE>
<TE>   From the cathedral site at Grand and Temple, it's a four-block
downhill walk to Main Street and the most familiar building in
downtown Los Angeles. That's City Hall, known to "Dragnet" fans as
police headquarters, to "Superman" adherents as the offices of the
Daily Planet. Now that it's been through rehab, its handlers say it
is again ready for close-ups--in this case, free tours.</TE>
<TE>   City officials have been working in the upgraded City Hall since
last summer. A grand reopening ceremony was scrubbed after Sept. 11,
but free 45-minute tours resumed in December. They run on Mondays,
Tuesdays and Wednesdays from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., led by volunteers from
the mayor's office on the building's third floor. Reservations are
recommended ([213] 978-1995), especially for groups of 10 or more. On
Tuesdays and Wednesdays, you might see the City Council in session.
Most council meetings are open to the public; more information on
scheduling is available at the city Web site, www.
lacity.org/council.htm.</TE>
<TE>   Look closely above the elevator doors on the third floor, near the
starting point, and you see Greco-Roman figures operating movie
cameras. The tour takes you past revived meeting rooms, where
restoration crews, directed by principal architect Brenda Levin,
removed decades of paint-overs, pulled cork panels from walls,
rescued and polished old fittings.</TE>
<TE>   The halls and rooms are full of Italian marble, gleaming bronze,
Malibu tiles and ornately painted ceilings. As painstaking as this
work seems, Kevin Jew, chief operating officer for the city's Project
Restore organization, notes that historic restoration visible to
visitors cost about $8 million. Essentially invisible is the seismic
upgrade that began in the early 1990s, which includes 526
shock-absorbing base isolators below the building, 8,000 tons of
added structural or reinforcing steel and a $299-million price tag.</TE>
<TE>   For many visitors, the highlight is the building's rotunda, which
features 60-foot ceilings and a 2,000-pound bronze chandelier that
had been packed away in crates for decades. For others, the high
point is, well, the high point: the 27th-floor observation deck,
about 460 feet above the street.</TE>
<TE>   It offers far views in every direction and just above it perches
the Lindbergh Beacon, the 2,500-watt light that city officials turned
on this winter for the first time in decades. (Jew said the beacon is
lighted for only special occasions, in part because each lighting
requires advance Federal Aviation Administration clearance.)</TE>
<TE>   So far there are no weekend tours, but the Los Angeles Conservancy
and city officials have tentative plans for two Saturday morning
tours per month, led by conservancy guides, beginning in June. A
rededication of the building has now been set for April 26, the
anniversary of its original dedication in 1928.</TE>
<TE>   A Brilliant Old Building, a Modest New Museum</TE>
<TE>   From City Hall, it's one block west on 1st Street, then two blocks
south on Broadway to the Bradbury building (304 S. Broadway). For
years, the Bradbury, built in 1893, has been a wonder to walk
through, from the skylight atrium design to its elaborate ironwork,
but until now, unless you had business with the LAPD Internal Affairs
department, there wasn't much reason to stop inside. That changed on
Jan. 24, when the fledgling Architecture and Design Museum (A+D
Museum for short) opened in 2,000 square feet on the ground floor.</TE>
<TE>   Operating in space donated by building owner Ira Yellin, the
museum is a relatively modest affair: orange and white walls, rough
concrete and tile floors, usually no staff. Yet its first exhibition,
on display through March 21, offers an enlightening peek into the
story behind that new cathedral up the hill.</TE>
<TE>   Before Spanish architect Jose Rafael Moneo landed the commission
in 1996, he and four competitors were asked to jump through several
hoops, including the design of a hypothetical shrine to Junipero
Serra. The exhibition shows several models and descriptions of the
competitors' ideas (including a striking proposal from Frank Gehry
that will remind some viewers of a half-finished game of Pic-Up Stix)
and offers a hint at the thinking that won Moneo the job. The key to
bringing awe and transcendence to a design, Moneo suggests in the
text accompanying his entry, is the play of the light.</TE>
<TE>   The A+D Museum (304 S. Broadway, portico space) is open Tuesdays
through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., and on Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 8
p.m. Admission is free. (213) 620-9961; www.aplusd.org.</TE>
<TE>   Bohemians by the Tracks</TE>
<TE>   Traction Avenue, an industrial district east of Alameda Street
where the roads intersect at wacky angles, has been getting artier
for several years now. The Cornerstone Theater is there, along with
lofts and artists' studios, the southern-flavored Soul Folks
restaurant (714 Traction Ave.) and, just around the corner on 3rd
Avenue, the bright, airy Cafe Metropol. But the last 12 months have
brought several big steps.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest came in September when the Southern California
Institute of Architecture (350 Merrick St.; [213] 613-2200;
www.sciarc.edu) ended a year of tent-and-trailer operations and moved
into the converted 1907 Santa Fe freight depot along the tracks. The
building stretches more than 1,200 feet along the tracks, and various
student projects and other exhibits are displayed inside.</TE>
<TE>   There are no formal tours, but admissions director Debra Abel said
members of the public have been turning up often to look at the
building. If visitors arrive between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. on weekdays
and ask nicely, "we pretty much give them a map of the building and
tell them it's a self-guided tour," Abel said.</TE>
<TE>   Half a block away on Traction, behind a beckoning glass
storefront, stands Form Zero (811 Traction Ave.; [213] 620-1920), a
bookstore specializing in architecture and design. Aiming to follow
Sci-Arc, and no doubt to whittle a few dollars from the rent it was
paying in its old Santa Monica location, the shop moved downtown in
June.</TE>
<TE>   For breakfast, lunch or a cup of coffee nearby, there's Cafe
Metropol (923 E. 3rd Ave.; [213] 613-1537), which helped pioneer the
neighborhood and then doubled its size in November. For smaller
snacks and caffeine, there's Gourmet Coffee Warehouse ([213]
626-8650), which opened in early February, sharing a building with
Form Zero.</TE>
<TE>   In the same neighborhood, at 962B E. 4th St., the Project ([213]
620-0692; open Wednesdays through Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.;
www.elproyecto.com) gallery opened in May. Acting as a satellite to
the Project on West 126th Street in New York, the Los Angeles gallery
fills its 3,800 square feet (a former auto shop) with video art,
along with paintings and sculpture from local and international
artists.</TE>
<TE>   The Project's assistant director, Song Huff, 26, moved from New
York to help open the space last year. With its history of neglect
and recently rising rents and population, Huff said, her new
neighborhood "reminds me of Brooklyn."</TE>
<TE>   Loft Life</TE>
<TE>   Much of the optimism over downtown's prospects has to do with the
simple idea that more people want to live there these days. The
Downtown Center Business Improvement District, which covers the
65-block core area of downtown, counted 12,633 housing units downtown
in late 2001, including 880 loft units. The group forecasts that by
2004, if current proposals hold, that number will rise by a bit less
than 50%, to 18,456.</TE>
<TE>   If you don't mind a sales pitch from developer Gilmore Associates,
you can join a Saturday morning tour of units in three of that
company's rental loft buildings (the Hellman, Continental and San
Fernando), which stand in the Old Bank District along Spring and Main
streets at 4th Street.</TE>
<TE>   Groups meet at 10 a.m., usually at the Acapulco Gold coffee shop
(400 S. Main St.; another business that's opened in the last year).
Tours last two hours; sensible shoes are suggested ([213] 253-4777,
www.laloft.com).</TE>
<TE>   As you head south on Spring Street from 4th, you come across two
other new enterprises: L.A. Cafe (639 S. Spring St.) , a coffee and
sandwich shop with shaded tables out front that opened in January
near the edge of the Fashion District; and Gallery 835 (835 S. Spring
St.; [213] 629-2401; www.artmovesme. com), where owner Richard
McDowell opened a 3,500-square-foot exhibition space in May.</TE>
<TE>   Eats on Fig</TE>
<TE>   Steakhouse Arnie Morton's of Chicago (735 S. Figueroa St.; [213]
553-4566; www.mortons.com) opened in November in the mall at 7th and
Figueroa streets, giving the chain its second Los Angeles County
location (the other is in Beverly Hills) and giving hard-core
carnivores an alternative to Nick &amp; Stef's Steakhouse, the Joaquin
Splichal eatery that opened in 1999 at 330 S. Hope St.</TE>
<TE>   But here comes Splichal again, with yet another downtown eatery:
the elaborately appointed Zucca (801 S. Figueroa St; [213] 614-7800;
www.patinagroup.com), which opened last week at 8th and Figueroa
streets, just a block from Arnie Morton's. Splichal's first Italian
restaurant, Zucca features a big patio, big, bold art on the walls,
lots of deep colors and many imported objects.</TE>
<TE>   "All this is from Italy," said a hostess, offering a quick tour
during lunch hour last week. "These tiles. And this wooden door is
from an old church. And over here, these floorboards are from an
Italian town."</TE>
<TE>   Neither restaurant, however, is staking its life on people going
downtown just for fun. Putting business diners first, Arnie Morton's
serves lunch and dinner on weekdays, only dinner on weekends.
Similarly, Zucca serves lunch and dinner on weekdays and dinner on
Saturdays; it closes on Sundays. Meanwhile, in a move that cheers
downtown's boosters, McCormick &amp; Schmick's atop the Library Steps
(633 W. 5th St.; [213] 629-1929) in October expanded its hours to
include lunch on Saturdays and Sundays.</TE>
<TE>   Nights on Broadway (and Near It)</TE>
<TE>   Unless you head straight for Staples Center, the Music Center or
an upscale restaurant, venturing downtown after dark probably means
confronting some squalor, especially east of Broadway, where hundreds
of people sleep on sidewalks every night. The buddy system is a good
idea, as is knowing exactly where you're headed.</TE>
<TE>   The Smell (247 S. Main; www.thesmell.org; [213] 625-4325), two
blocks east of Broadway, is closer still to several homeless
encampments. It moved downtown in late 1999 and has settled into its
rough-hewn space more thoroughly over the last year.</TE>
<TE>   In the absence of alcohol or many other distractions, performers
and audiences alike seem relatively serious about their music, which
varies from jazzy to industrial. The club's wall notices last week
included a posting from a "hard-core animal rights peace punk band"
seeking guitarist, bassist and drummer.</TE>
<TE>   Around 11 one recent Friday night, the band was Felonius and the
singer, a tall woman in blond hair and a red dress, was deadly
earnest. "This song is about all those people that [work] you over,
that have a little more power than you," she began. Toward the stage,
one gaggle of Smellsters listened and applauded politely. Back near
the entrance, another gaggle munched on apple cobbler (on sale at the
counter) and pawed through used records, which ranged from Sun Ra to
John Tesh.</TE>
<TE>   The Smell, usually open three or four nights a week, has added a
monthly art show and a Wednesday night improvisational music series.
It's also open more often in summer, when students have more freedom
to prowl. The cover is about $5, and doors open around 9 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   For more mainstream pleasures, there is the gaudy old Orpheum
Theater on Broadway near 8th Street, where Will Rogers once quipped
and Sally Rand once stripped. The Orpheum reopened in June after a
$3-million, 18-month renovation.</TE>
<TE>   Built in 1926, the 2,100-seat Orpheum (842 S. Broadway;
www.laorpheum.com) is one of 11 old theaters featured on the Los
Angeles Conservancy's "Broadway Theaters" tour every Saturday
morning; it also presents live performances occasionally. On Saturday
and Sunday, Middle Eastern pop musicians Khaled and Hakim take over
the hall with their "Desert Roses and Arabian Rhythms" tour.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the nearby unrenovated Palace Theater (630 S. Broadway;
[213] 688-6166), purchased in 2000 by Gilmore Associates, has begun
offering occasional live shows, often on the wild side. The first, in
September, was a variety show that attracted a crowd of about 100,
manager Dawn Garcia said. Other events have included a 24-hour horror
film festival, and evenings of installation and performance art
evenings are scheduled for April 5 and 6.</TE>
<TE>   Between them stands the Globe theater, yet another enterprise with
a new identity. Though the Globe sign remains out front at 744 S.
Broadway, the big business happens in back, where an alley entrance
advertises this as the Orion nightclub.</TE>
<TE>   Open to clubbers age 18 and up, the club serves no alcohol,
turning deejays and dancers loose on the bottom floor of the old
theater.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday nights the theme is techno music and dancers pay $20 at
the door, then submit to a rigorous pat-down (pens and lip balm
containers are among the forbidden items). Upon their full
disarmament, clubbers gain entry and the chance to frolic until 5
a.m. amid the bouncing green laser lights and the outlines of the
historic theater faintly visible above.</TE>
<TE>   If you're 19, you're likely to feel right at home. If you're 40,
consider the couple about that age who turned up at Orion one recent
Friday around midnight. As they waited in line to have their purses
and pockets ransacked, another clubber, about 20 years old,
approached with a question:</TE>
<TE>   "Hey," he said. "Are you looking for your kids?"</TE>

<LD>Billionaire investor Carl Icahn received Federal Trade Commission
clearance to purchase $500million of ImClone Systems Inc. stock,
roughly 40% of the company.</LD>
<LD>   The agency granted Icahn early termination of the waiting period
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act because it
didn't see any anti-competitive problems with the purchase. Icahn can
begin buying shares immediately.</LD>

<HD>Suit Says Allstate Ran Illegal Credit Checks</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Allstate Corp. is accused in a lawsuit of illegally checking
individuals' credit histories without consent while processing
homeowner insurance applications.</LD>
<LD>   In the suit filed in federal court in Atlanta, Jeanne Cochran of
Douglasville, Ga., says she was denied insurance after her son's
credit report showed a poor financial history.</LD>
<LD>   The suit seeks class-action status for all U.S. residents whose
credit records were obtained by Allstate while processing insurance
applications by others and asks for as much as $1,000 per violation.</LD>
<TE>   Allstate says the Fair Credit Reporting Act allows insurers to
pull credit histories of all household members, spokesman Mike
Trevino said.</TE>
<TE>   The statute exempts insurers from the consent requirement, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Northbrook, Ill.-based Allstate shares rose $1.16 to $34.46 on the
NYSE.</TE>

<LD>DaimlerChrysler said it will return to profit this year after posting
a fourth-quarter loss on reorganization costs at the U.S. Chrysler
car and Freightliner truck units.</LD>
<LD>   "Net income this year will be positive with and without one- time
effects," said Chief Financial Officer Manfred Gentz.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Executive Juergen Schrempp said the outlook for 2002
operating profit was halved because of weakening economies in Europe,
the U.S. and Japan. The Stuttgart, Germany-based car maker expects
the U.S. car and light-truck market to decline to 15 million units
this year from 16 million in 2001.</LD>

<HD>Judge Scales Back HMO Patient Claims</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge in Miami ruled that patients in several of the
nation's largest HMOs can proceed with some of their claims in a
lawsuit accusing the health insurers of violating federal
racketeering laws.</LD>
<LD>   The widely watched lawsuit accuses the HMOs of using deceptive
advertising to misrepresent the quality of health care they would
receive.</LD>
<LD>   The defendants are Aetna Inc., Cigna Corp., Health Net Inc.,
Humana Inc., UnitedHealth Group Inc. and Prudential Financial Inc.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Federico Moreno dismissed 10 of 16 claims
brought against the insurance companies under the federal Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, but determined the other
six claims to be valid.</TE>
<TE>   Moreno also dismissed some claims brought under the ERISA law
regulating employee retirement benefits. But he allowed one claim to
proceed, in which the HMOs are accused of interfering with
physician-patient communication by imposing "gag orders" on doctors.</TE>

<HD>Taiwan Shuts Site That Sold Movies</HD>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Taiwanese police seized the servers of a Web site that violated U.S.
copyright laws and allowed customers worldwide to watch Hollywood
movies on the Internet, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   For about $1, Eternity Italy Ltd. allowed people to watch streamed
movies from the company's Web site, movie88.com. Films featured on
the site included "Antitrust" as well as episodes of "The X-Files"
and "Star Trek."</LD>
<LD>   The Web site's owner, Tan Soo Leong, a 39-year-old Malaysian
lawyer, could not be immediately reached for comment. But in an
interview last week, Time magazine quoted Tan as saying that although
his Web site broke U.S. copyright laws his company was operating
legally in Taiwan.</LD>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Taiwanese official Lu Wen-hsiang said Tan
misinterpreted Taiwanese law. "No one has said it is legal. The only
one who does is Mr. Tan," Lu said.</TE>

<LD>General Electric Co. became the latest corporate titan to say it
would shed more light on its inner financial workings in the wake of
the Enron Corp. collapse.</LD>
<LD>   The world's largest company by market capitalization bowed to
investor pressure and said it will break out revenue and operating
information for 26 of its three dozen businesses, including GE
Capital, which contributes about 40% to its overall profit.</LD>
<LD>   Some investors have said GE's huge financial-services arm, GE
Capital, is the main engine of the company's earnings, but investors
know very little about its results. GE Capital's earnings in fact
have enabled the parent company to consistently meet or beat Wall
Street estimates, critics say.</LD>
<TE>   GE said it will incorporate the changes in its annual report, to
be released around March 8, as well as in earnings releases and
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   GE shares rose $1.17 cents at $37.57 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Computer Associates Shares Drop Over 17% on Profit
Questions</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Media reports say the software firm's pro forma
accounting methods are at the center of a federal investigation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of Computer Associates International Inc. fell more than 17%
Wednesday following reports of a federal inquiry into whether the
company deliberately overstated profit to inflate its stock price and
enrich senior executives.</LD>
<LD>   Federal prosecutors and the FBI have opened a preliminary inquiry
into the Islandia, N.Y.-based software company's books, Newsday
reported Wednesday, citing sources close to the investigation.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn refused to
comment on the report.</LD>
<TE>   The news comes as corporate accounting practices have come under
new scrutiny after the collapse of Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Newsday reported that investigators are examining whether the
company has properly distinguished between revenue it receives from
the sale of software and the fees it charges to service, upgrade and
maintain software products.</TE>
<TE>   Former employees have said that Computer Associates began using
pro forma accounting, a practice that can make profit seem larger,
the New York Times reported on its Web site Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   In April, the Times questioned the company's accounting practices,
alleging that it had overstated its revenue and cash flow in recent
years.</TE>
<TE>   Computer Associates officials said the report contained misleading
and "at times false" information.</TE>
<TE>   Computer Associates, which makes software that helps run big
mainframe computers for corporate clients, has reported its financial
results on a pro forma basis since October 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The company also continues to report its results under regular
accounting rules.</TE>
<TE>   But because of a change Computer Associates made in its contracts
when it began using pro forma accounting, the standard results are
essentially meaningless for investors, critics have complained.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement early Wednesday in response to the Newsday article,
Computer Associates said, "We have not been contacted by the
authorities regarding any investigation and do not know what, if
anything, is being investigated. The reporting of our financial
results has always been in accordance with all applicable accounting
principles."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Computer Associates fell $4.40 to close at $20.91 on the
New York Stock Exchange, where it was one of the most actively traded
issues.</TE>

<LD>   The U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the convictions but

<HD>Job Cuts Are Expected at Boeing Unit</HD>
<DH>Aerospace: Telecom slowdown may prompt layoffs of nearly
25% of work force at satellite facility in El Segundo.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Boeing Co., battered by a slowdown in the telecommunications
industry, is preparing for significant retrenchment this year at its
satellite manufacturing operations in El Segundo, starting with a
cutback of about 1,000 jobs expected to be announced today, according
to sources close to the decision.</LD>
<LD>   Layoffs could exceed 2,000 this year, or nearly 25% of the work
force at what has been one of the most resilient and fastest-growing
sectors of the California aerospace industry.</LD>
<LD>   The cutbacks reflect a belated response to the telecommunications
bust that has seen the collapse of a number of ambitious efforts to
build global wireless communications systems and space-based
broadband systems for the Internet. The El Segundo business, which
Boeing acquired last year, had aggressively expanded manufacturing
capacity in recent years and developed new generations of more
powerful satellites. The investments were based on the outlook for
tremendous communications industry growth, the same optimism that
damaged companies such as Lucent Technologies Inc. and Global
Crossing Ltd.</LD>
<TE>   "They're starting to feel" the downturn, said Marco Caceres,
senior space analyst with Teal Group, an aerospace research firm.
"They have been building a satellite a month for a long time, but
they're looking at the future and they're not seeing the kind of
orders they've had."</TE>
<TE>   The move comes four months after Boeing slashed about 400 jobs,
citing the slowdown in orders. The unit is the world's largest maker
of satellites for both military and commercial markets and now has
about 9,200 employees, most of them at the sprawling complex south of
Los Angeles International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   A Boeing spokesman declined to comment, but an all-employee
meeting is scheduled for today when details of the cuts are expected
to be unveiled, Boeing sources said.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,000 positions, in all areas of the unit, are expected to
be slashed in the first round of cuts, but Boeing officials hope to
lay off about 500 to 700 people, with the rest taking early
retirement or jobs at other Boeing units.</TE>
<TE>   The company is the largest private employer in the region, with
about 35,000 employees, and has other major operations in Seal Beach,
Canoga Park, Anaheim, Huntington Beach and Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   A second round of cuts, which Boeing officials hope to avoid or
curtail, could include another 1,000 jobs, a source said.</TE>
<TE>   In all, including the previously announced cut of 400 jobs, Boeing
could end up slashing a quarter of the satellite work force, a
percentage reduction similar to Boeing's other recent cost-cutting
measures. Boeing's commercial aircraft making business, hurt by the
slump in air travel after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, is slashing
as many as 30,000 jobs, or about 30% of its commercial aircraft work
force.</TE>
<TE>   The decision comes a little over a year after Boeing bought the
business from Hughes Electronics Corp. for nearly $4 billion, a price
analysts considered too high.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing officials have insisted that their main interest in
acquiring the satellite business was not for its manufacturing base
but for the engineering know-how to create a company that could
provide integrated systems. For instance, it has pushed hard to
market satellite-based Internet service as well as an air-traffic
management system that relies on satellites.</TE>
<TE>   But with the slump in the telecommunications industry, few
commercial orders have been placed, and prospects for new business
were dashed when new satellite-phone start-up businesses such as
Iridium and New ICO went bankrupt.</TE>
<TE>   It won several high-profile defense contracts, such as building a
constellation of spy satellites for the National Reconnaissance
Office, but it appears they weren't enough to offset the drop in
commercial business. A Boeing official declined to say how many
orders it received last year, but the company delivered six
satellites compared with eight the year before.</TE>
<TE>   The unit, which generates more than $2 billion in revenue, still
has a backlog of 38 satellites worth about $5 billion, but new orders
have slowed in recent years, analysts said. Depending on the
configuration, satellites can range in price from about $100 million
to $250 million, and the more sophisticated satellites can take as
long as 18 months to build.</TE>
<TE>   The unit also was hurt by a decision last year to drop out of a
major military program after its role was reduced. Boeing's share of
a new generation of satellites for the Pentagon, which was supposed
to be developed with Lockheed Martin Co. and TRW Inc., shrank from
more than $900 million to about $400 million. Boeing said the
project's risks were not worth its diminished role.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the unit has been hit hard by quality problems with its
satellites.</TE>
<TE>   Some Boeing engineers say that quality problems, including recent
revelations that several of the company's most powerful satellites
have problems with their solar panels, are hurting their
competitiveness in an already very difficult market and putting
pressure on pricing.</TE>
<TE>   But Caceres said Boeing has a "very strong position" relative to
its European competitors, who have exploited restrictive U.S. export
rules to garner foreign customers.</TE>
<TE>   "They were expecting a boom market a few years ago but it's not
going to happen," he said, adding that worldwide annual demand for
satellites has dropped from the upper 20s to the low teens. "They
don't expect an upturn until 2003 or 2004."</TE>
<TE>   Rumors about the cuts have been swirling at the facility for the
last two weeks, and some employees had anticipated a major
announcement as early as last week.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Raytheon Co.'s Electronic Systems unit, which is
headquartered a few blocks from Boeing's satellite business,
privately acknowledge hearing about potential layoffs as early as
last month and were preparing for a possible onslaught of resumes.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing shares fell 40 cents to close at $43.31 on the New York

<HD>Black-Owned Businesses Blossoming in the Suburbs</HD>
<DH>Survey: Firms find room to grow in outlying valleys and
better access to tech resources in Orange County.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ROBINSON-JACOBS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>African American-owned companies are becoming a stronger presence in
suburban areas of Southern California, nearly eclipsing their
traditional base in South Los Angeles, a new study shows.</LD>
<LD>   South Los Angeles is still home to the majority of African
American-owned firms in Los Angeles County, but the percentage is
dropping. In 2000, the figure was 58%, down 12 percentage points from
the 1980 figure of 70%.</LD>
<LD>   In that same period, the percentage of black-owned firms in both
the San Fernando and San Gabriel valleys doubled: from 3% to 6%. And
the proportion of firms in Los Angeles County, outside of South Los
Angeles, grew from 23% in 1980 to 30% in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   Moreover, the study by the Los Angeles-based Community Development
Technologies Center, a nonprofit research group, found that
black-owned businesses in outlying areas are significantly outpacing
those in South Los Angeles in terms of revenues.</TE>
<TE>   "It repeats the economic shift where big business moved out of
South L.A. and took many of the jobs with them," said Reginald
Chapple, executive director of the Dunbar Economic Development Corp.
in South Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Chapple, however, voiced concern that African Americans who remain
in historically black neighborhoods may have a harder time finding
employment because of the trend.</TE>
<TE>   "We're seeing another kind of shift, where local folk may not be
employed at local jobs. It can be difficult for African Americans to
find work at Latin firms," he said, noting that many of the shops
abandoned by outbound black entrepreneurs have been taken over by
other ethnic groups.</TE>
<TE>   "We tend to hire our own and want to cater to our own."</TE>
<TE>   In part, the migration of African American businesses away from
the city's center mirrors broader population trends that have seen
blacks in increasing numbers settle in suburban areas, especially the
Inland Empire.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1990s, Moreno Valley, for example, gained 27,500 African
Americans, according to census data.</TE>
<TE>   A need to be close to tech clusters within Orange County prompted
Martha Daniel to open her information technology company--Information
Management Resources Inc.--in Irvine, and later move it to Costa
Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   "My relationships were in Orange County," said Daniel, who opened
her business 10 years ago. "I never thought of putting the business
someplace else."</TE>
<TE>   As a woman and a minority-group member in a field still dominated
by white men, Daniel finds her status a plus.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't all compete for the same small piece of pie in L.A."
said the Memphis native. "It makes sense to look for other areas
where we ... have the ability to capture a greater market share."</TE>
<TE>   Daniel is one of the growing number of blacks finding gold in the
tech sector.</TE>
<TE>   The report showed that although 60% of black firms remain in the
services sector, only 22% were in the personal services field, such
as beauty and barber shops and laundry services--where blacks
traditionally have found small-business opportunities. About 18% were
in business services, including technology-related firms, and 15%
were in engineering, accounting or research.</TE>
<TE>   "How many African American nail shops do you know of," said Denise
Fairchild, president of the CDTC and author of the report, noting the
influx of Asian entrepreneurs in that service sector. "Black barber
shops are still around, but it's a dying breed. The competition, even
in the personal-services sector, is quite substantial."</TE>
<TE>   Fairchild said she hopes the report prompts government officials
as well as business advocacy groups to address the question of where
to put funding emphasis.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you fund businesses that are succeeding and growing? Then
you're funding businesses that are not in the central city," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   The report, based on surveys of 130 African American
entrepreneurs, census data and other reports, was funded by Merrill
Lynch as a more detailed analysis of trends identified in its
California Minority Business Atlas, a comprehensive look at
minority-owned businesses that was published in November 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The report recommends that a public/private partnership look for
ways to help central city firms continue to serve their core markets,
while at the same time using technology to reach out to customers
regionally and nationally.</TE>
<TE>   The study found that black-owned businesses in outlying areas also
are outpacing their urban counterparts in revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Because of both the mix of businesses and the wallet size of the
customer base, the median sales volume of black-owned firms in Orange
County was $500,000 in 2000, more than double the $195,000 figure for
South Los Angeles, according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   A stumbling block to increased economic development in South Los
Angeles is the space crunch, said Dean Jones, executive director of
the South Los Angeles Economic Development Partnership.</TE>
<TE>   "San Gabriel has more industrial space for people to move their
businesses to," said Jones, who would like to see more light
manufacturing in South-Central.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, he said, many of the buildings in South L.A. are old,
with floor plans that make them poor contenders for tech-firms
seeking structures with wide-open floor plans and broadband or
fiber-optic capabilities.</TE>

<HD>Studios May Have the Most to Lose</HD>
<DH>Courts: The ownership of early depictions of favorite
characters and music could be at stake.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Billions of dollars and the future earning power of some of the
nation's most cherished cultural icons are at stake as the U.S.
Supreme Court considers a constitutional challenge to a 1998
copyright extension law, legal experts said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The experts agreed that the high court's decision to consider
Eldred vs. Ashcroft, until Tuesday an obscure appeal, could lead to
the most important copyright decision in more than 100 years.</LD>
<LD>   Movie studios, record companies, publishers and experts in
intellectual property law were caught by surprise when the high court
announced Tuesday that it would review a 1st Amendment challenge
mounted by a coalition of Internet entrepreneurs and legal scholars
to the 1998 Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act. That act
extended copyrights for an additional 20 years.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a really big deal," said Stephen Gillers, vice dean of
New York University Law School. "This case is sexy because it's about
money and the arts at the same time."</TE>
<TE>   "This is it," agreed Dennis S. Karjala, who teaches copyright and
intellectual property law at Arizona State University Law School.
"It's hard to think of a bigger copyright case" since the landmark
1879 decision that divided intellectual property into functional
works, which are patented, and artistic works, which are copyrighted.</TE>
<TE>   Any ruling by the Supreme Court would affect early depictions of
Mickey Mouse, first copyrighted in 1928, and film classics such as
"Gone With the Wind" and "The Wizard of Oz," novels such as "The
Great Gatsby" and "The Sun Also Rises," as well as early jazz music
and compositions by George and Ira Gershwin.</TE>
<TE>   "I think just about everybody in the [entertainment] business will
be impacted. Somebody's going to get hurt here," said Gerry Margolis,
of Manatt, Phelps &amp; Phillips.</TE>
<TE>   David Nimmer, a visiting law professor at UCLA, said that although
many of the recent copyright cases considered by the Supreme Court
have affected just a narrow portion of copyright holders, "This case
has the potential to affect every copyright owner."</TE>
<TE>   Nimmer and Gillers predicted that with so much at stake, the
Supreme Court case is likely to generate millions in new legal
business.</TE>
<TE>   "Probably billions of dollars ride on this decision, so millions
of dollars will be spent on lawyers and amicus briefs and research on
the history of copyright going back to King James," Gillers said.</TE>
<TE>   Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner said it was "too early to
comment" extensively on possible fallout from any change in the
copyright law. He attempted to minimize the impact.</TE>
<TE>   "All that has happened is that two courts upheld Congress'
extension of the copyright law, and we don't consider it unusual that
it is going to the last court of appeal, the Supreme Court," Eisner
said.</TE>
<TE>   "If it went bad, and I don't think it will, we're talking about
the very early images [of Mickey Mouse and others], we're not talking
about our trademarks ... this is not taking away those values,"
Eisner said.</TE>
<TE>   But legal and financial analysts anticipate a huge impact.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who are freaking out are the studios," said Los
Angeles lawyer Neville Johnson, who has a copyright infringement case
involving a 1920s jazz song pending in U.S. District Court in Los
Angeles. "It's Mickey Mouse, is why they're all freaked out."</TE>
<TE>   "In the case of Mickey Mouse, this is a huge issue," agreed Kevin
Lane Keller, a Dartmouth College marketing professor and an expert on
Disney marketing. "Mickey has huge symbolic value and he still has a
lot of commercial value.</TE>
<TE>   "These characters and brands have so much earning potential,"
Keller said. "They can be licensed and merchandised in so many ways.
The amounts are staggering. In a lot of cases, we're talking about
billion-dollar brands."</TE>
<TE>   Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. and Warner Bros., which have Hollywood's
largest film libraries, also could feel a huge impact. The studios
had no comment.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street analysts say it's difficult, if not impossible, to
come up with an exact dollar value for some of the studios' most
popular characters or movies. Companies are loath to put a value on
their properties, and usually lump revenue from those characters or
properties into "intangible assets."</TE>
<TE>   But licensing revenue offers a glimpse into the value of some of
these properties. For example, Disney has said that Winnie the Pooh
and the Hundred Acre Woods characters generate a third of all of
their licensing revenue.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1990s, Pooh generated $2 billion a year for Disney and
its licensees.</TE>
<TE>   Chris McGurk, chief operating officer at MGM, said, "Copyright is
the only thing that protects us from people taking our properties,
copying them, exploiting them, doing whatever they want for free."</TE>
<TE>   MGM's James Bond franchise is said to be worth more than $1
billion for the Santa Monica studio. It is about a fourth of the
estimated $5-billion value of MGM's 4,100 film library, analysts have
said.</TE>
<TE>   Supporting the appeal, copyright scholars and Internet
entrepreneurs said the extensions have the unfortunate, and
unintended, effect of burying works that could be resurrected. The
Gershwin tunes and "The Great Gatsby" will live on, they said, and
the copyright laws will determine only who profits from their
existence.</TE>
<TE>   To illustrate their point, they cited in court papers an exception
to the rule. Frank Capra's 1946 film "It's a Wonderful Life" had a
second life when its copyright was allowed to lapse because of an
oversight. This forgotten movie "lay gathering dust in a movie studio
until the early 1970s" when its copyright expired, the papers said.</TE>
<TE>   Once it passed into the public domain, several public broadcasting
stations aired it during the Christmas season. Within a few years,
the forgotten film became a classic and a Christmas tradition.</TE>
<TE>   But Margolis, whose firm represents high profile copyright
holders, called such arguments disingenuous.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not talking about people who want to make intellectual
property available to the free world, we're talking about people who
want to go into business," he said. "The opposition is not
free-speechers. They're people who want to go into business and make
a profit on what yesterday was someone else's property."</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State's Karjala played a key role in organizing 60 law
professors to send a letter to Congress in 1998 opposing the Sonny
Bono law, contending that it "would impose substantial costs on the
United States general public without supplying any public benefit."</TE>
<TE>   He said Wednesday that the case "is an issue of tremendous
importance. It is one where we simply can never expect Congress to
follow the constitutional requirements because there is a built-in
bias in the legislative process for copyright. The beneficiaries are
organized and the general public is not organized. It's no one's
fault. It's structural. It's a problem of democracy."</TE>

<HD>Consumer Prices Rise; Inflation Still Tame</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. consumer prices posted their first gain in four months during
January as costs for food and energy began to rise, according to a
Labor Department report Wednesday that showed inflation remains tame.</LD>
<LD>   The consumer price index, the most widely used gauge of inflation,
rose 0.2% last month, slightly below Wall Street economists'
forecasts for a 0.3% increase.</LD>
<LD>   Although the report indicated a gradually recovering economy could
begin nudging prices higher, analysts said any inflation risk was
well into the future and there was little or no prospect of
policymakers raising interest rates soon.</LD>
<TE>   Still, it was the first increase in consumer prices since a 0.4%
rise in September. Prices declined 0.3% in October and 0.1% in both
November and December. Hopes have grown that the economy is on the
verge of recovery from a recession that set in last March, and
typically that is accompanied by higher prices.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the economy will grow slowly enough, unemployment will
remain high enough and productivity growth will be vigorous enough
that inflation won't raise its ugly head anytime soon," said
economist Bill Cheney of John Hancock Financial Services in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   That means U.S. interest rates, now at 40-year lows after last
year's rate-slashing campaign by the Federal Reserve, could stay at
current levels at least until mid-year, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Financial markets showed scant reaction to the latest data, which
fit with other recent signs that economic activity was stabilizing
but did not imply a sharp resurgence in growth. U.S. bond prices
firmed on the prices report--an indication traders did not see any
likelihood that interest rates would go up in the near future.</TE>
<TE>   Energy costs, which had tumbled during the final three months of
2001, rose 0.9% in January, while food prices were up 0.3% after a
flat December reading. Gasoline prices climbed 2.7% last month, but
that followed big drops of 5.8% in December and 10.5% in November.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding food and energy, the so-called core rate of prices was
ahead 0.2% last month after a 0.1% rise in December.</TE>

<HD>Enron Employees' Suit OKd</HD>
<DH>Courts: Ruling is a boost to workers whose 401(k) plans
were decimated. Meanwhile, documents detail loans to firm's overseas
ventures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON and EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Employees whose retirement funds were decimated by the collapse of
Enron Corp. can move forward with a class-action lawsuit against the
company, a federal judge ruled Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Also Wednesday, the Overseas Private Investment Corp. said it
could be on the hook for $658 million in Enron-related projects
abroad, although that figure is less than previous estimates.</LD>
<LD>   And the exodus of top Enron executives continued, with the
announced retirement of General Counsel James V. Derrick Jr.,
effective March 1.</LD>
<TE>   The decision by U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez is
a major boost for the 15,000 current and former workers who say Enron
mismanaged their 401(k) plans, costing them up to $1 billion in
losses.</TE>
<TE>   Among their complaints, employees say it was wrong for the bulk of
their 401(k) assets to be in Enron stock, which has been rendered
nearly worthless by the company's demise.</TE>
<TE>   However, employees won't necessarily receive money if they win
their lawsuit. Gonzalez's ruling allows the workers to proceed with a
retirement-related suit in federal court in Houston. The suit had
been automatically put on hold by Enron's Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   But any award from the Houston case would have to be approved by
the bankruptcy court in New York, which would balance the employees'
claim against those of other unsecured creditors.</TE>
<TE>   Still, employee lawyers were buoyed by Wednesday's ruling, saying
their case could have been delayed for years without it.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very significant victory for our efforts to have our
day in court against Enron and for the people who have seen their
life savings decimated," said Eli Gottesdiener, an employee attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez also ruled that Enron must turn over to employees all the
documents that it has provided to Congress and federal regulators who
are investigating the company's downfall.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez is scheduled to decide next week on a separate request
from the employees to allow them access to $85 million in their
retirement funds case, Gottesdiener said. The money is contained in a
liability-insurance policy that was earmarked for the 401(k) plan.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, documents were released detailing Overseas Private
Investment Corp.'s loans to Enron ventures. OPIC has loaned a total
of $544 million since 1993 to five projects involving Enron, ranging
from a diesel-fueled power plant in the Philippines to a gas
processing facility in Venezuela.</TE>
<TE>   The documents showed that OPIC would have a maximum exposure of
$658 million for Enron-related energy projects in developing
countries, less than the $1-billion figure reported earlier this
year.</TE>
<TE>   OPIC, which provides loans and risk insurance to U.S. companies
operating abroad, said the outstanding loan balances total $453.7
million. The agency faces an additional $204 million in potential
exposure from political risk insurance policies issued to 10
Enron-related energy projects around the world. Such policies pay off
when a U.S. company's assets are seized by foreign governments or
damaged by terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   During the same period, another government agency, the
Export-Import Bank--which supports exports by U.S. companies--gave
more than $650 million to Enron-related projects overseas, though
it's unclear whether there is any taxpayer money at risk.</TE>
<TE>   "These projects obviously were a tremendous benefit to Enron's
operation," said Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), who requested the
information from OPIC.</TE>
<TE>   "The disclosure of this information sheds light on the
government's action in support of Enron over the years."</TE>
<TE>   OPIC's maximum exposure was dramatically reduced last week when
the agency terminated two loans to projects in Brazil totaling $390
million, according to OPIC spokesman Lawrence Spinelli. The loans
were canceled before the funds were released because the projects
failed to meet preset deadlines and conditions, he said. As a result,
the loan commitments expired.</TE>
<TE>   OPIC officials are optimistic that most of the remaining loans
will be repaid in full.</TE>
<TE>   "Four of the five projects are operating very successfully and are
providing a revenue stream to pay off the loans," Spinelli said.</TE>
<TE>   The loans were not made directly to Enron, but instead were issued
to separate entities or joint ventures. As a result, the entities are
not directly affected by Enron's bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   OPIC's biggest exposure comes from the $2.9-billion Dabhol Power
Co., a joint venture including Enron, Bechtel Corp. and General
Electric Co. The power plant, about 150 miles from Bombay, has been
shut down after a dispute with an Indian electricity board. OPIC,
which provided about $160 million in loans and $180 million in
political risk insurance, is working to find a buyer for the plant.</TE>
<TE>   Derrick's retirement was "purely voluntary," according to company
spokeswoman Karen Denne, although the company noted that it was
coming "in connection with the restructuring and reorganization" of
the company.</TE>
<TE>   The 57-year-old Derrick, who also is executive vice president,
joined Enron in 1991 from the company's now-beleaguered law firm,
Vinson &amp; Elkins. He will be replaced by deputy general counsel Robert
H. Walls Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's former chief executive,
has resigned his seat on the board of the Houston branch of the
Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.</TE>

<HD>Consumers Push Online Sales Up 20% in 2001</HD>
<DH>E-commerce: A new report shows that added features and
better security helped with Internet purchases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE FREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Online sales rose nearly 20% last year as features such as one-click
shopping and enhanced security convinced more consumers to buy over
the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. consumers spent an estimated $32.6 billion online in 2001,
compared with $27.3 billion in 2000, according to a Commerce
Department survey released Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Online holiday sales during the last three months of 2001 totaled
$10.04 billion, the highest for any quarter since records were first
compiled in 1999. The same period in 2000 brought sales of $8.9
billion.</LD>
<TE>   The growth in online sales is due, in part, to merchants who have
made it easier to shop online by saving billing and shipping
information in Internet databases and adding one-click shopping
features, said E-Tailing Group President Lauren Freedman. Consumers
also have become more educated about the Internet and feel more
comfortable shopping online.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you get into it I think people get hooked," Freedman said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a rise in online sales, e-commerce did not account for a
much larger proportion of total retail sales last year. Online sales
made up 1% of total retail sales in 2001, a 0.1% increase from the
previous year. Total retail sales rose 3.3% in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Online sales during the last three months of 2001 accounted for
1.2% of total retail sales, rising slightly from the fourth quarter
of 2000 when online sales made up 1.1% of the total. Total retail
sales for the quarter were $860.8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Although online sales made up only a small fraction of the
$3.2trillion in total retail sales last year, they have seen
considerable growth compared with other channels.</TE>
<TE>   Catalog sales, which have been around for decades, generated about
$72 billion last year, Freedman said. Online sales reached nearly
half that amount in 2001 after being around for only a few years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fairly significant in a fairly short time span," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The online sales estimates--compiled from a survey of 11,000
retailers--do not include sales from ticket agencies, online travel
services and financial brokers and dealers. They are not adjusted for
seasonal, holiday and trading-day differences.</TE>

<HD>$5.1Million Awarded in Exxon Mobil Cancer Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former merchant seaman won a $5.1-million jury verdict against
Exxon Mobil Corp. on Wednesday in a Los Angeles trial in which he
alleged that toxic fumes emitted by crude oil caused his bladder and
prostate cancer, lawyers said.</LD>
<LD>   Dwayne Gregory, 54, served for seven years on oil tankers,
including the former Exxon Valdez, which now operates as the
Mediterranean. Gregory alleged that company officials waited 20
months to tell him that an Oct. 3, 1997, shipboard physical
examination detected blood in his urine, a sign of possible bladder
cancer, said Reed Morgan, one of his lawyers.</LD>
<LD>   By the time Gregory was diagnosed, the cancer had spread to his
prostate, Morgan said. "Now he has a high probability of losing his
bladder and may lose his life."</LD>
<TE>   Gregory, who now lives in Oregon, got treatment and chemotherapy
and was prepared to return to work. Because of his condition, Gregory
requested an assignment away from petrochemicals, either in port or
on a tanker that carried something other than crude oil, said Robert
Grey Johnson, another lawyer representing Gregory.</TE>
<TE>   "The crushing blow was once he finished his chemotherapy and had
four cancer surgeries, they fired him because they could only let him
work in a nontoxic environment," Johnson said. "He has no medical
benefits, no job and no pension. They just kind of discarded him. The
jury was very upset about that."</TE>
<TE>   Officials for Irving, Texas-based Exxon could not be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   The 1997 physical examination was Gregory's first in five years
with Sea River Maritime Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Exxon,
Morgan said. According to Coast Guard regulations, such operations
are required to obtain physical examinations for employees every 30
months.</TE>
<TE>   A separate federal law mandates annual physicals and enrollment in
a benzene surveillance program for workers exposed to the level of
petrochemicals and hydrocarbons that Gregory was, Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   The verdict was reached after a two-week trial and two days of
deliberations.</TE>
<TE>   It includes $1.3 million for loss of earnings and medical expenses
and $3.8 million for pain and suffering. Maritime law does not allow
punitive damages.</TE>

<HD>FCC to Rethink Media Rules</HD>
<DH>Regulation: The commission's Republican majority tends to
lean toward support of free markets. Compromises are likely.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER JR.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In the wake of a court ruling that undermined federal ownership
restrictions in the cable and broadcast TV industry, the head of the
Federal Communications Commission conceded Wednesday that it would be
harder for the agency to justify its rules.</LD>
<LD>   A federal appeals court in Washington on Tuesday ordered the FCC
to reconsider restrictions that no single company can reach more than
35% of the national broadcast television audience. The court also
swept aside a ban on a company owning a cable system and a TV station
in the same market.</LD>
<LD>   The court ruling "was a monumental case" that makes it harder for
the FCC to keep its restriction, FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell said
in a speech at Georgetown University.</LD>
<TE>   The ruling essentially told the FCC "you have to go through some
compelling analysis to keep [media rules], and if you don't they go
away," Powell told reporters. "The commission has a very poor history
of coming up with those persuasive justifications."</TE>
<TE>   Viacom Inc., owner of CBS, News Corp., which owns Fox, and General
Electric Co., NBC's owner, challenged the 35% ownership cap rule as
obsolete.</TE>
<TE>   The FCC, which over the last half century has tangled in federal
court over such issues as cable TV access, cigarette ads and indecent
speech, once again finds itself on the political hot seat. Analysts
say the media industry is poised to undergo a new wave of
consolidation after the court decision.</TE>
<TE>   "The FCC has a peculiarly sensitive political role because they
are dealing with what can go out over the airwaves," said Ernest
Gelhorn, a professor at George Mason University Law School in
Fairfax, Va. "We are talking about an agency that affects
entertainment, news and telecommunications--both wired and wireless.
You cannot find more sensitive and important issues in American
life."</TE>
<TE>   The appeals court requires the FCC to provide additional evidence
that other media ownership rules are still needed. The agency is
reviewing a ban on a company owning a newspaper and broadcast station
in the same market. Several companies are already in violation of
that rule, including Tribune Co., publisher of the Los Angeles Times,
which owns newspapers and TV stations in several of the same markets.</TE>
<TE>   Led by Powell, an ardent champion of free markets over regulated
ones, the independent federal agency is now expected to reformulate
its TV ownership rule in a way that will give media giants such as
News Corp., AOL Time Warner Inc. and Viacom greater freedom to buy
more TV stations.</TE>
<TE>   Powell, the son of Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, already
commands a political majority at the FCC, where three of the four
commissioners are Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   This month President Bush nominated Jonathan S. Adelstein, a
Democrat, to fill the fifth slot on the FCC. But Adelstein, who has
been a legislative aide to Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), will probably
not be confirmed in time to participate in the FCC ownership debate.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the debate will be shaped by Powell and fellow Republican
Commissioners Kathleen Q. Abernathy and Kevin J. Martin.</TE>
<TE>   Abernathy, an energetic former lobbyist for the now-defunct
telephone carriers US West and AirTouch Communications, has a
reputation as a pro-business commissioner at the agency. But she also
is a shrewd pragmatist who is sensitive to political winds.</TE>
<TE>   Martin, 35, is the youngest member of the commission. Martin honed
his political skills as deputy general counsel for the Bush campaign.
At FCC meetings, he often hews closer to Republican free-market views
than does Powell.</TE>
<TE>   The one Democrat on the FCC, 61-year-old Michael J. Copps, will
probably again find himself the lone dissenting voice when the media
ownership limits are taken up.</TE>
<TE>   Copps, who objected to News Corp.'s $4.4-billion acquisition of
rival broadcaster Chris-Craft Industries, strongly defended media
ownership limitations in a statement last fall after the agency
agreed to review its newspaper broadcast cross-ownership rules.</TE>
<TE>   "Broadcast stations and newspapers make up the center of the local
marketplace of ideas, a function critical to a democratic society,"
Copps said. "As competing purveyors of ideas, they have the potential
to present diverse viewpoints on issues important to their
communities."</TE>
<TE>   Powell has argued that FCC media ownership rules are outdated.
However, confronting the 35% rule head-on, some experts say, may put
him in conflict with his pro-competition sentiments.</TE>
<TE>   "Michael Powell talked a good deregulatory game when he was in the
minority at the FCC, but now that he is the chairman he has to tread
a little more carefully," said Eli M. Noam, an economics professor
and telecommunications expert at Columbia University.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is that the de-regulatory approach" with media
ownership "is not the pro-competition approach," Noam said. "Dropping
FCC regulations altogether will entrench the monopolists. So it is
quite possible that Powell will end up making compromises."</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts say Powell may craft some rule that removes audience
limits so long as there is no evidence of lessened competition.</TE>
<TE>   Times wire services were used in compiling this report.</TE>

<TE>FCC Membership</TE>
<TE>The Federal Communications Commission regulates the nation's
television, wire, radio, satellite and cable industries. The five
commissioners are appointed by the president and confirmed by the
Senate for five-year terms.</TE>
<TE>Michael K. Powell, 38, named FCC chairman by President Bush in
January 2001. Powell joined the FCC in 1997 after being nominated by
President Clinton. Previously, Powell served as the chief of staff of
the Antitrust Division at the Justice Department. Powell graduated
from Georgetown University Law Center. He is the son of Secretary of
State Colin L. Powell.</TE>
<TE>Kathleen Q. Abernathy, 45, appointed to the FCC by Bush in 2001.
Served as vice president of public policy at Broadband Office
Communications Inc. and was vice president for regulatory affairs at
US West Inc. She was an adjunct professor at Georgetown University
Law Center.</TE>
<TE>Michael J. Copps, 61, appointed to the commission by Bush in 2001.
Was assistant secretary of Commerce during the Clinton administration
and served as chief of staff for Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.).
Copps was a professor of history at Loyola University of the South.</TE>
<TE>Kevin J. Martin, 35, named to the FCC by Bush in 2001. Served as
deputy general counsel for the Bush presidential campaign. Was an
advisor to former FCC Commissioner Harold Furchtgott-Roth. Attended
Harvard Law School.</TE>
<TE>The fifth commissioner post is vacant. This month, Bush nominated
Jonathan S. Adelstein for the remainder of a five-year term expiring
June 30, 2003. Adelstein has been a legislative assistant for Sen.

<HD>Infinity CEO Quits to Head Citadel Communications</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Farid Suleman, chief executive of Viacom Inc.'s Infinity radio
division and a longtime lieutenant to Viacom President Mel Karmazin,
resigned Wednesday to become chief executive of radio group Citadel
Communications Corp.</LD>
<LD>   The move appeared to jibe with Wall Street's belief that Karmazin
may depart the company when his contract expires next year. Karmazin,
the former CBS CEO who gained operating control of Viacom in May
2000, has been locked in a management dispute with Viacom CEO Sumner
Redstone.</LD>
<LD>   Karmazin will assume Suleman's duties. Infinity Radio President
Dan Mason will continue to oversee the 186-station division's
day-to-day operations, Viacom said.</LD>
<TE>   Suleman said his new job represents a "wonderful entrepreneurial
opportunity" and dismissed suggestions that his departure is linked
to the management dispute. He also will become a special limited
partner in the New York leveraged buyout firm Forstmann Little &amp; Co.,
which owns Citadel.</TE>
<TE>   In the event Karmazin stays on, radio insiders suggested,
Suleman's move could position Infinity to acquire Citadel if
regulators permit additional consolidation of the radio industry.
Karmazin has said Viacom is primarily interested in dominating large
media markets. Citadel's stations are predominantly in mid-size
cities.</TE>
<TE>   Viacom shares rose 96 cents to close at $43.34 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>IRS Clears the Air on Frequent Fliers, 'Golden Parachutes'</HD>
<DH>Taxes: Personal use of business-travel miles is exempted,
and new rules proposed on payments to departing executives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a pair of developments aimed at businesses, the IRS issued new
rules Wednesday regarding the personal use of frequent-flier miles
earned by business travelers, and also said it is proposing new rules
on how "golden parachute" payments to departing executives are taxed.</LD>
<LD>   Seeking to clear up confusion, the Internal Revenue Service said
frequent-flier miles earned on business or official travel will not
be counted as taxable income when they are converted to personal use.</LD>
<LD>   Some legal interpretations have held that these miles are just
another form of compensation not exempted from taxation. But IRS
officials say it would be difficult to place a value on the miles and
to separate those a taxpayer got on personal trips or through credit
cards from those obtained through business travel.</LD>
<TE>   Because of these difficulties, the IRS has never pursued an
enforcement program on frequent-flier miles or similar benefits from
business trips. The announcement Wednesday is intended to put any
lingering questions to rest.</TE>
<TE>   The new rules the IRS is proposing on golden parachute payments to
departing executives are designed to protect low- and mid-level
workers whose stock options appreciate when their firm is acquired.
Golden parachutes are employment agreements that typically provide
top executives with lavish severance payments if their company is
taken over and new management is brought in.</TE>
<TE>   Current law imposes an excise tax of 20% on payments of more than
three times an individual's base compensation when a company is
acquired or merged. The tax applies when an employee owns more than
$1 million in stock or 1% of the fair-market value of outstanding
shares.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS now wants to eliminate the $1-million threshold to keep
the law from applying to "individuals who do not possess significant
influence over the corporation," such as workers who see the value of
their stock options increase as a result of a merger.</TE>
<TE>   "Lots of people who weren't intended to be were swept up into this
thing" under rules issued in 1989, Peter Elinsky, partner in charge
of compensation and benefits for KPMG, told Bloomberg News. "It's a
great change, because the law was intended for the guys who are
really making out like bandits."</TE>
<TE>   The regulations still subject corporate officers and other highly
compensated employees--defined as those making more than $90,000, up
from $75,000--to the golden parachute rules.</TE>
<TE>   The rules also deny a tax deduction to companies for making the
payments. They apply when the acquiring firm gains more than 50%
ownership.</TE>
<TE>   Some tax experts say the IRS also should have eliminated the 1%
ownership threshold because it sweeps in people who don't influence
corporate decisions.</TE>
<TE>   The rules apply mostly to public companies that merge. The
regulations also govern compensation arrangements in private firms,
including those about to go public.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS will take comments on the golden parachute
proposal--REG-209114-90--until June 5; a public hearing will be held
June 26.</TE>

<HD>Forecast Says State's Jobless Rate May Jump</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Though California is weathering the recession better than much of the
country, the state's unemployment rate will increase "rather
dramatically" this year, according to a forecast to be released
today.</LD>
<LD>   Economists at the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp.
predict the state's jobless rate could climb to an average of 6.3% in
2002, up from an average of 5.2% last year.</LD>
<LD>   "It's going to be a rough first quarter," said Jack Kyser, the
group's chief economist.</LD>
<TE>   Though the national recession is proving to be a mild one, most
economists say unemployment will continue to rise even as the economy
recovers.</TE>
<TE>   Kyser said unemployment in Los Angeles County, which bottomed out
at 4.7% in February 2001, could reach 7% in coming months because of
continued weakness in tourism, aerospace and manufacturing.</TE>
<TE>   The county's apparel sector, its largest manufacturing business,
is expected to shed 3,500 jobs this year and an additional 2,800 in
2003 because of a continuing barrage of cheap imported clothing.</TE>
<TE>   "In a word, the outlook for this industry is lousy," the report
said.</TE>
<TE>   The economic forecast predicts that the Bay Area will continue to
suffer the worst of any region in the state as it struggles to cope
with the tech-sector crash, a steep decline in tourism and an
oversupply of commercial office space.</TE>
<TE>   After years of steady employment growth, California will lose
28,300 jobs this year--most of them in Northern California, according
to the forecast.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be tough up in the Bay Area, no question," Kyser
said.</TE>
<TE>   But statewide, the nonfarm job total is expected to recover to
nearly 15 million jobs in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Continued weakness in Northern California will have repercussions
for the state's coffers this year. Growth in total personal income, a
sizzling 9.8% in 2000--the last year of the tech boom--dropped to
1.4% in 2001 and will edge up only slightly this year, to 2.4%, the
economic group said.</TE>
<TE>   The economic development group expects the state's residential
real estate sector to remain healthy.</TE>

<HD>Dow Soars as Investors Search for Stock Bargains</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: The tech sector gets a boost from
'short-covering.' Analysts won't predict a sustained rally.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bargain hunting and "short-covering" helped spur a midday stock rally
Wednesday, driving the Dow Jones industrial average to its best gain
in more than two months.</LD>
<LD>   The broader market also closed higher, but the blue-chip Dow stole
the show, surging 196.03 points, or 2%, to 9,941.17, its best
percentage gain since it rose 2.2% on Dec. 5.</LD>
<LD>   The Nasdaq composite index rose 24.96 points, or 1.4%, to
1,775.57, ending a three-session losing streak. The Standard &amp; Poor's
500 was up 1.4% as well.</LD>
<TE>   Wall Street began the day with another sell-off, adding to
Tuesday's losses. But stocks turned around at midday and shot higher
for most of the afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq index fell as low as 1,729, down 1.2% from Tuesday's
close, before bouncing back.</TE>
<TE>   Winners topped losers by 19 to 12 on the New York Stock Exchange
and by 20 to 15 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts were reluctant to suggest that the rebound was the
start of a significant rally.</TE>
<TE>   "The market appears to be one where we are seeing lots of rallies,
lots of sell-offs," said Alan Ackerman, executive vice president of
Fahnestock &amp; Co. "There's little conviction and little leadership
needed to get the market going."</TE>
<TE>   Worries about the accuracy of corporate accounting have weighed on
the market in recent weeks, as the Enron and Global Crossing
bankruptcies have been followed by allegations that the companies'
books were cooked. Those concerns continued to spread Wednesday.
Computer Associates slid $4.40 to $20.91 on reports that federal
prosecutors are examining whether the software firm deliberately
overstated sales and profit to inflate its stock price.</TE>
<TE>   IBM, which also has had its accounting questioned lately, closed
off 23 cents at $99.31, though it recovered from a low of $97.</TE>
<TE>   But other big-name stocks were sharply higher, including GM, up
$2.27 to $52.28; 3M, up $3.73 to $117.10; and United Technologies, up
$1.79 to $70.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts took an upbeat view of the focus on accounting.</TE>
<TE>   "On the other side of this accounting imbroglio, we should have
better [financial] disclosure, and that's a good thing for stocks,"
Edmund Cowart, who helps manage close to $6 billion at Eagle Asset
Management in St. Petersburg, Fla., told Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   Experts said short-covering also helped boost the market
Wednesday: Bearish traders who had borrowed shares and sold
them--betting on lower prices--jumped in to buy stock to close out
their positions as the rally progressed.</TE>
<TE>   That may have helped some of the most battered tech and telecom
stocks gain ground.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Nextel Communications fell as low as $3.64 but
recovered to close up 83 cents at $4.38. Lucent Technologies closed
up 39 cents at $5.68 after falling as low as $5.25. WorldCom Group
added 10 cents to $6.58 after falling as low as $6.12.</TE>
<TE>   In commodities trading, crude oil futures in New York fell almost
3% as the failure of the Russian government and oil companies to
extend export restrictions into the second quarter signaled a
possible price war with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.</TE>
<TE>   A meeting Wednesday between the Russian government and oil firms
ended without any mention of export controls beyond March.</TE>
<TE>   Near-term oil futures fell 59 cents to $20.29 a barrel.</TE>
<TE>   Among the day's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Analysts' upgrades helped some stocks. Circuit City climbed
$2.21 to $24.32 after Merrill Lynch raised its near- and long-term
recommendations on the retailer to "strong buy" from "buy."</TE>
<TE>   Also, software firm Oracle rose 72 cents to $15.51 after Banc of
America Securities upgraded the stock to "buy" from "market perform."</TE>
<TE>   * Drug stocks attracted buyers. Merck gained $2.01 to $61.26 and
Johnson &amp; Johnson added $1.20 to $58.12.</TE>
<TE>   * Bank stocks were broadly higher. Citigroup rose $1.30 to $43.52,
Bank of America jumped $1.63 to $61.18, and Northern Trust was up
$1.11 to $53.90.</TE>
<TE>   But mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac closed
lower after a Wall Street Journal editorial criticized the companies'
rising debt levels and their use of so-called derivative securities.</TE>
<TE>   Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are government-chartered companies
created decades ago to buy mortgages from lenders. Together the
companies now own or guarantee more than 40% of the roughly $5.8
trillion in outstanding U.S. mortgage loans. That has raised concerns
about the potential fallout if either company encountered financial
trouble.</TE>
<TE>   The Journal editorial contended that the companies are keeping
earnings growing with the use of derivatives. Fannie Mae called the
editorial "egregious."</TE>
<TE>   Fannie Mae shares fell as low as $75.40 but closed at $77.40, down
$1.05. Freddie Mac traded as low as $61.30 but closed at $63.15, off
77 cents.</TE>
<TE>   * Many utility shares remained under pressure. AES fell 50 cents
to $4.25 after Moody's Investors Service warned it may downgrade the
company's debt rating. Also lower on the day were Dynegy, off 54
cents to $22.54, and Reliant Energy, down 36 cents to $20.99.</TE>
<TE>   * Media stocks rallied after a court ruling favoring large media
companies opened the door for more consolidation. Walt Disney rose
$1.47 to $24.33, Belo Corp. gained $1.02 to $21.51, and Gannett rose
$2.51 to $76.90.</TE>
<TE>   * Many gold-mining stocks fell as gold futures eased again.
Near-term futures fell 90 cents to $292.30 an ounce in New York.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft Said to Profit From Accord</HD>
<DH>Courts: Vice president admits consent decree improves the
firm's bargaining position.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Far from being hobbled by its pending antitrust settlement with the
Justice Department, Microsoft Corp. is already profiting from it by
imposing new conditions on computer companies, a Microsoft executive
admitted in court papers filed late Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   In a sworn interview conducted this month by attorneys fighting
for harsher penalties, Microsoft Senior Vice President Richard Fade
conceded that the software giant is taking in as much revenue from
licensing the Windows operating system as before, while insisting
that computer makers waive more of their rights to prevent Microsoft
from using the computer firms' technology.</LD>
<LD>   Asked if the consent decree's "net result is positive for
Microsoft," Fade said the conclusion was "correct." And he said all
of Microsoft's top 20 customers believe they've been hurt by the
settlement that Justice Department officials had said would protect
them.</LD>
<TE>   Excerpts of the deposition, along with computer makers' complaints
to Microsoft about the intellectual property issue, were filed by
California and eight other states opposed to the controversial
Justice Department settlement. The states asked U.S. District Judge
Colleen Kollar-Kotelly to consider Fade's testimony in a fairness
hearing next month on the proposed deal.</TE>
<TE>   The new evidence is strong enough that it could make a difference
in whether Kollar-Kotelly blesses the pact, said antitrust law
professor Robert Lande of the University of Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   "This certainly makes it less likely that the judge is going to
approve it," Lande said. "You've got a Microsoft executive admitting
that the proposed settlement actually improves their bargaining
position. It's what some of the critics have been saying all along,
but it's the proof.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a mind-boggling document," Lande said.</TE>
<TE>   In their filing, the states wrote, "Years of litigation, millions
of dollars of expense, and victories in the District Court and Court
of Appeals should not result in a net gain for the violator and harm
to the victims." The appeals court held that Microsoft illegally
maintained its monopoly on the operating systems for personal
computers, leaving it to the lower court to pick a punishment.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft was able to insist on the new intellectual property
clause because of similar wording in the consent decree and that
decree's requirement that computer makers get essentially the same
terms. That was intended to bar Microsoft from playing favorites.</TE>
<TE>   The uniformity means that "inevitably, some [manufacturers] who
had gained unique concessions would be unhappy with particular terms
under the new decree-mandated 'one size fits all' approach,"
Microsoft said. It denied that it had profited from the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Though more complex than Windows pricing, the patent issue is an
important one for the computer companies. At Hewlett-Packard Co.,
talks with Microsoft on patent enforceability took six months before
they were resolved in a licensing agreement last summer.</TE>
<TE>   After Microsoft began following the consent decree in December, it
threw out that agreement and told HP it would to have to waive more
of its rights. In a letter to Fade sent last month, HP complained
that the new requirement "amounts to one-half of a patent
cross-license flowing from HP to Microsoft, without compensation and
without reciprocity."</TE>
<TE>   Fade's admissions prompted the states to change their minds and
ask to participate in the fairness hearing next month, which is
required under the Tunney Act. Previously, they had planned to save
their fire for a trial scheduled later in March on their own proposed
remedies, which would include forcing Microsoft to license versions
of Office software for other operating systems and releasing the
source code for the Internet Explorer Web browser to the public.</TE>
<TE>   In an unrelated victory for the states, Kollar-Kotelly ruled that
Microsoft must turn over its source code for Windows to opposing
attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   The states asked for the code because Microsoft is arguing that it
would have to redesign it entirely to comply with another of the
states' proposed remedies, that it offer stripped-down versions of
Windows without browsers, media players and other add-ons.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft shares rose 97 cents to $59.90 Wednesday on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft System Logs Users' Choices</HD>
<DH>Technology: Media Player tracks the music and movies
selected, the firm says, creating the possibility that customer
habits could be sold for marketing purposes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp.'s new version of its popular Media Player software is
logging the songs and movies that customers play.</LD>
<LD>   The company said Wednesday that it was changing its privacy
statement to notify customers about the technology after inquiries
from the Associated Press.</LD>
<LD>   The system creates a list on each computer that could be a
treasure for marketing companies, lawyers or others. Microsoft says
it has no plans to sell the data collected by Media Player 8, which
comes free with the Windows XP operating system.</LD>
<TE>   "If you're watching DVDs you don't want your wife to know about,
you might not want to give her your password," said David Caulton,
Microsoft's lead program manager for Windows Media.</TE>
<TE>   The new privacy policy was issued Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The media player has been bundled as a free addition to Windows
for several years and allows users to play music CDs, DVD movies and
digitally stored songs on their computers.</TE>
<TE>   When a CD is played, the player downloads the disc name and titles
for each song from a Web site licensed by Microsoft. That information
is stored on a small file on each computer in the latest version of
the software.</TE>
<TE>   The new version released with Windows XP last fall also added the
same technology for DVD movies.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft's original privacy statement informed customers that
they were downloading the information about CDs but never stated it
was being stored in a log file on each computer. The new statement
makes clear that information is being downloaded for DVDs and CDs,
but does not explain how users can eliminate or get into the log
file.</TE>
<TE>   There is no easy way to clear out the log, Microsoft said, without
crippling Media Player.</TE>
<TE>   The only way to keep Media Player from going to the Microsoft site
is to make the player think it is working without an Internet
connection, which can be tedious if the user switches between
watching DVDs and listening to Internet radio stations.</TE>
<TE>   As part of downloading the information about songs and movies from
the Web site, the program also transmits an identifier number unique
to each user on the computer. That creates the possibility that user
habits could be tracked and sold for marketing purposes.</TE>
<TE>   Privacy experts said they feared the log file could be used by
investigators, divorce lawyers, snooping family members, marketing
companies or others interested in learning about a person's
entertainment habits. It also could be used to make sure users have
paid for the music or movie and have not made an illegal copy.</TE>

<HD>Providian Must Disclose Documents</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Providian Financial Corp. must disclose documents about how it
markets credit cards, a California appellate court ruled Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The court rejected Providian's argument that the documents contain
trade secrets, upholding a lower court's decision to unseal memos
filed in class-action suits against Providian that said the company
deceived cardholders and charged hefty fees.</LD>
<LD>   Hearst Corp., owner of the San Francisco Chronicle, had sought to
have the documents unsealed, arguing that consumers have a right to
know how Providian, which specializes in issuing credit cards to
people with poor credit histories, attracted customers.</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for San Francisco-based Providian said company lawyers
were reviewing the opinion and had not decided whether to appeal to
the California Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Providian reached a deal to sell $565 million in
British credit card loans to Barclays for a "low double-digit"
percent premium. Providian would get about $79 million for the loans
if the British bank paid a 14% premium.</TE>
<TE>   Providian shares fell 1 cent to close at $4.07 on the New York
Stock Exchange, before news of the court ruling was announced.</TE>

<HD>PUC Probes Moving Company for Theft, Violations</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Public Utilities Commission said Wednesday that it is
investigating Starving Students Inc. moving company for service
complaints ranging from theft to failing to show up for planned
moves.</LD>
<LD>   The PUC said it also is looking into allegations by commission
staff that the Los Angeles-based moving company underreported
revenues so that it could pay smaller license fees and operated at
times without insurance.</LD>
<LD>   Starving Students Chief Executive Mark Peers said the moving
company, which has branch operations in 11 states, has been working
with the PUC for a year to resolve numerous complaints that resulted
from a corporate overexpansion from 1998 to 2000.</LD>
<TE>   However, he said, the company believes it reported revenue
correctly to the state and has never operated without insurance. Both
allegations are the result of misunderstandings with the PUC staff,
Peers said, adding that the company is working to clear them up.</TE>
<TE>   "With the explosive growth we had as a company, chaos set in,"
resulting in shoddy service, Peers acknowledged. A corporate overhaul
in 2000 has resulted in better moving service, he said, pointing to
only 24 complaints last year on nearly 50,000 household moves.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC order initiating investigation, which was released late
Wednesday, listed complaints from 58 consumers. Allegations included
the theft of items while in the custody of Starving Students,
charging more than the estimate provided and arriving hours late or
failing to arrive at all for a scheduled move. Customers also
complained that movers solicited tips through extortion or
intimidation, the PUC said.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC has the option of suspending or revoking the license of
Starving Students or fining the company, a PUC spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   Starving Students, founded in 1973, is owned by Ethan Margalith,
his father, Sanford, his mother, Elizabeth, and his sister, Abigail,
according to the PUC order.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AT&amp;T Corp., the biggest U.S. long-distance telephone company, pockets
almost half the money it collects for a federally mandated
residential long-distance service charge, a lawsuit alleges.</LD>
<LD>   The suit claims AT&amp;T bills residential customers 11.5% of their
long-distance charges for the Universal Connectivity Charge, even
though the Federal Communications Commission requires
telecommunications carriers to contribute only 6.8% of long-distance
revenue to the fund. AT&amp;T said the claims are without merit.</LD>
<LD>   The complaint, which seeks class-action status on behalf of AT&amp;T's
60 million residential customers, asks a judge to bar the company
from charging a connectivity fee that exceeds what it contributes to
the federal fund. It also seeks reimbursement of millions of dollars
in overcharges</LD>

<LD>360networks Inc. said it received a subpoena from the Securities and

fiber-optic network operator that filed for bankruptcy protection in
January. The SEC and FBI are examining allegations from investors and
a former employee who have said Global Crossing inflated revenue and
misled shareholders.</LD>
<LD>   Qwest Communications International Inc. said it received an SEC
subpoena last week. Both Qwest and 360networks participated in swaps
with Global Crossing, which controls about one-fifth of the
fiber-optic networks leaving the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   A spokeswoman for Vancouver-based 360networks, which filed for
bankruptcy protection last year, refused to comment further on the
inquiry.</LD>

<LD>IBM Corp. President Sam Palmisano, who becomes chief executive March
1, said Big Blue expects "a very tough economic year," but that
helping customers automate and integrate business processes will keep
the company's profit margin up.</LD>
<LD>   "There's a lot more margin involved because it's a lot harder to
do," Palmisano said of the computer-consulting and services work,
which is IBM's largest business segment.</LD>
<LD>   IBM, the largest seller of computer services and hardware, wants
to continue consulting, software and server-computer sales to
companies that are automating more of their internal processes,
Palmisano said.</LD>
<TE>   IBM's gross profit margin in 2001 was 37%, up from 36.3% in 2000.</TE>

<LD>Online search-engine maker Google Inc. is introducing a new program
that allows Web sites to be displayed more prominently by paying more
money--an advertising-driven system derided by critics as an
invitation to deceptive business practices.</LD>
<LD>   Under a new feature, the rankings of a search engine devoted to
advertisers will be determined in part by how much Web sites offer to
be listed in specific categories.</LD>
<LD>   The system lets Web sites raise their bids to increase their
chances for higher placement on the section of Google's site that's
devoted to sponsored links.</LD>
<TE>   Google's auction-style system mirrors a model used by rival
Overture Services Inc. of Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   On Nasdaq, Overture shares fell $2.80, or 9.6%, to $26.25 on the

<HD>CEO's Exit Could Lead to Breakup of TRW</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES FLANIGAN and PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Cote's abrupt departure as chief executive of TRW Inc. is only
one step in a process that could see the aerospace-electronics and
auto parts company be split up or acquired within the next two years,
sources with knowledge of TRW operations said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Both Lockheed Martin Corp. and Northrop Grumman Corp. are eager to
acquire TRW's Redondo Beach-based defense business, according to
investment banking sources. But a third large company from outside
the aerospace industry also has expressed interest in acquiring TRW's
defense business, the sources said.</LD>
<LD>   When news of Cote's departure to Honeywell International Inc.
broke Tuesday, several large defense contractors contacted TRW to ask
about the possibility of acquisition, sources said.</LD>
<TE>   TRW has remained a nonplayer in the aerospace industry's
consolidation over the last decade, the only major defense concern
that did not acquire or divest significant assets. Its absence from
the market has long left deal makers wondering about its strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Any deals involving TRW will take time, however, because it must
reduce the large debts taken on three years ago to make an
acquisition in its Cleveland-based automotive parts operations.</TE>
<TE>   Cote, 49, who came to TRW as chief executive in 1999 from General
Electric Co. resigned to accept the same position with Honeywell.
Cote had been pushing to separate TRW's auto parts business with its
roughly $9 billion in annual sales, from aerospace electronics with
its revenue of more than $7 billion, according to analysts estimates.</TE>
<TE>   If, as sources suggest, TRW is on its way to being acquired, that
would tend to boost the stock price. But meanwhile, investors reacted
negatively to Cote's departure, slashing an additional $2.95 a share
from TRW's price Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Since Tuesday's announcement, TRW has lost 14% of its value,
falling $6.24 to $38.80 in New York Stock Exchange trading.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of 2001, TRW's net debt stood at $5.5 billion, more
than 70% of its total capital, according to analyst Byron Callan of
Merrill Lynch. The company had reduced debt from $6.4 billion in the
last year.</TE>
<TE>   TRW's defense operations, noted for sophisticated electronics and
surveillance satellites, are particularly attractive at this time,
analysts said, because the company is benefiting from contracts in
the expanded Pentagon budget for fiscal 2003.</TE>
<TE>   TRW and partner Lockheed have won a contract to develop a military
communications satellite and has major contracts with the Army and
Navy. It is also a strong candidate to win the multibillion-dollar
contract for the National Polar Orbiting Observation Satellite.</TE>
<TE>   Lockheed Martin is known to be interested because the addition of
TRW's high-energy lasers and other sophisticated technologies would
boost Lockheed's standing in missile defense.</TE>
<TE>   Century City-based Northrop Grumman would like to acquire TRW,
sources said, because it would give Northrop a strong presence in
space defense technology. Northrop recently acquired an Aerojet
General's unit in Azusa that makes sensors used in space.</TE>
<TE>   TRW, founded in the 1950s by scientists Simon Ramo and Dean
Wooldridge, merged with auto parts maker Thompson Products in the
1950s in order to attain the protection of size, Ramo said in an
interview last year. "In those days," Ramo said, "a company needed
the stability of big revenues and paying a dividend. There was less
capital available."</TE>
<TE>   Sheltered inside the auto parts maker, TRW became a principal firm
for secret high-technology programs for the military. But even as the
defense industry consolidated in the early 1990s, TRW retained its
independence as other defense contractors had no wish to take on
massive automotive operations.</TE>
<TE>   However, TRW's stock price has languished even in the new
expansion cycle for aerospace-defense business because the automotive
industry was in a down cycle, and TRW had borrowed $7 billion to
acquire Britain's LucasVarity, a leading brake maker.</TE>
<TE>   So beginning in 1999, Cote's mission was to prepare the automotive
and aerospace operations for separation.</TE>
<TE>   This would have happened within the next two years, sources close
to TRW said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   An irony, said one source, is that had Cote completed his mission,
he would have been out of a job because TRW's defense business, which
is now headed by Tim W. Henneman, and its auto business, now to be
run by John Plant, would not need a "surplus chief executive."</TE>
<TE>   As it is, Cote has gone to head Honeywell, a firm with strong
aviation electronics operations and also automotive component
operations in its former Allied-Signal properties.</TE>
<TE>   The possibility that Cote and Honeywell, aided by GE Capital,
would someday enter bidding for TRW was raised Wednesday among the
many scenarios for TRW being bandied about in aerospace and financial
circles.</TE>
<TE>   Pae reported from Washington and Flanigan from Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Proposal May Quell Free Online Music</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal arbitrators on Wednesday proposed royalty rates for Internet
radio services that could spell trouble for Webcasters--with some
predicting doom for many free online music channels.</LD>
<LD>   The fees, which amount to fractions of a penny per song per
listener, are higher than what Webcasters had proposed. Yet they're
also significantly lower than what record labels had sought.</LD>
<LD>   "I think that a lot of people are going to look at this and say,
'Yeah, that's it, we're done,'" one online radio executive said.</LD>
<TE>   The panel's proposal will be reviewed by officials at the Library
of Congress, which formally sets the rates. That decision, expected
this spring, will cover any music played by a non-interactive online
music service since October 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The Internet spawned an explosion of free radio services supported
by advertising, including Web-only outlets such as Live365.com and
simulcasts of over-the-air stations. A 1995 law required online
stations eventually to pay royalties not just to songwriters--as
over-the-air stations do--but also record companies.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the rate structure fear listeners who want free radio
online will be left with only a few deep-pocketed media giants
willing to absorb Internet losses.</TE>
<TE>   The arbitration panel proposed lower fees for noncommercial
broadcasters and for radio stations that simulcast their over-the-air
broadcasts on the Web. But even those lower fees struck some
broadcasters as too high at a time of feeble advertising revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't know how we could have been any more clear about how
expensive and about how little to no money we've been making in this
area," said Dan Halyburton, a senior vice president at Susquehanna
Radio Corp. of York, Pa. With these rates and extensive new reporting
requirements for online broadcasters, Halyburton said, "you just may
have witnessed the end of commercial streaming on the Internet."</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the Recording Industry Assn. of America countered
that it's only fair for Webcasters that build their businesses around
music to pay the people responsible for it. Half of the royalties
collected go straight to artists, the rest to their record companies.</TE>
<TE>   "It is apparent to us, as it was to the [arbitration] panel, that
Webcasters and broadcasters of every size will be able to afford
these rates and build businesses on the Internet," RIAA President
Hilary Rosen said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The total amount of money involved is hard to gauge, but insiders
estimate the initial payment of back royalties would total several
million dollars.</TE>
<TE>   The panel's proposal would require over-the-air stations to pay 70
cents or more per hour for every 100 listeners online, depending on
how many songs they played.</TE>
<TE>   An Internet-only broadcaster would pay twice as much, and
noncommercial stations that aren't subsidized by the Corporation for
Public Broadcasting would pay less.</TE>
<TE>   Tuhin Roy, an independent digital media consultant and general
counsel for online broadcaster Echo Networks Inc., said, "The fact
that companies will be liable for royalties before they've had an
opportunity to develop an audience, and therefore revenue, is going
to act as a deterrent to new companies coming into this space."</TE>
<TE>   Sean Ryan, president and chief executive of online broadcaster
Listen.com, agreed: "It just makes a free radio offering simply more
difficult in an environment that's already staggeringly difficult."</TE>
<TE>   Listen offers a combination of free radio and subscription-based
music on demand, with a subscription radio service on the way. The
company isn't likely to make any major shifts in its approach, Ryan
said, but the royalties could affect how much emphasis it puts on the
free service.</TE>
<TE>   Halyburton predicted that the only companies able to afford the
proposed rates were Yahoo Inc., AOL Time Warner Inc.'s America Online
and Microsoft Corp.'s MSN Internet service.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't like the idea of all of the product offerings being
offered in just three places, you don't like what happened today," he
said.</TE>

<HD>GE Plans to Acquire Wind-Turbine Assets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Electric Co. agreed to purchase Enron Corp.'s wind-turbine
manufacturing assets, after Enron Wind Corp. and nine affiliated
companies filed for bankruptcy protection as part of the proposed
transaction.</LD>
<LD>   Enron Wind and its affiliates, which filed for Chapter 11
protection Wednesday,  weren't included in the parent company's
Chapter 11 filing in December.</LD>
<LD>   Tehachapi, Calif.-based Enron Wind is one of the world's largest
wind-turbine operators and is a profitable business. But "its future
growth requires more capital than we can justify," said Stanley
Horton, chief executive of Enron Global Services.</LD>
<TE>   The proposed purchase by GE's Power Systems unit includes Enron
Wind's global wind-turbine manufacturing and marketing operations. It
doesn't affect wind farms owned or operated by Enron. GE will
continue to provide operational support for most of the facilities,
Enron said.</TE>
<TE>   Financial details weren't available. GE is offering about $250
million in cash and would assume $150 million in debt, the Wall
Street Journal reported Wednesday. The deal requires a bankruptcy
judge's approval and is expected to close in April.</TE>

<HD>CalPERS' New World View Hits Home in Asia</HD>
<DH>Investments: The pension fund giant is pulling out stakes
in four countries because of its revised standards.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Public Employees' Retirement System said it will sell
off its assets in the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia,
saying those countries don't meet tough new standards--that now
include human rights--for emerging-markets investments.</LD>
<LD>   The decision marks the first time that CalPERS, the nation's
largest public pension fund, has applied criteria linking investment
decisions in emerging markets to social issues, Brad Pacheco, a
spokesman for the $150-billion fund, said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The measure could spur pension plans across the United States to
consider human rights when investing, some analysts said.</LD>
<TE>   CalPERS has long conducted regular reviews to assess its
investments in developing countries. In the past, however, the main
factors were financial ones, such as a country's market liquidity or
legal protections for investors.</TE>
<TE>   Now, CalPERS will give equal weight to factors such as political
stability and protection of civil liberties as a way to signal to
repressive regimes they need to clean up their act if they want to
see foreign investment, Pacheco said.</TE>
<TE>   According to a report submitted to CalPERS by Wilshire Associates,
the pension fund's consultant, the Philippines appeared to miss
CalPERS' guidelines primarily for financial reasons, while Malaysia
and Indonesia did poorly on human-rights considerations. Thailand
received a more mixed score, but still failed to make the grade.</TE>
<TE>   Pacheco said he did not know the current value of CalPERS assets
in the four Southeast Asian countries, but added that they would be
slowly divested over an unspecified period of time.</TE>

<TE>   Economist Yardeni</TE>
<TE>   Headed for Prudential</TE>
<TE>   Edward Yardeni, one of Wall Street's most plain-spoken economists,
is leaving brokerage Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown to become chief
investment strategist at Prudential Securities, a firm he left a
decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   Yardeni, 51, will replace Greg Smith, who resigned the post at
Prudential late last year.</TE>
<TE>   As chief strategist, Yardeni will be responsible for Prudential's
overall investment strategy, including recommended asset allocations
for clients and portfolio strategy, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Yardeni has been widely quoted in the media on economic and market
issues. His written commentaries are down-to-earth in style. He
recently wrote of the Enron Corp. debacle: "It is too soon to say
whether Enron's managers were scoundrels or stupid. It is clear that
the company's shareholders would have been better served by someone
like Chauncey Gardner, the simple-minded honest character played by
Peter Sellers in 'Being There.'"</TE>
<TE>   Yardeni, who has a doctorate in economics and a master's in
international relations from Yale University, was chief economist at
Prudential for eight years before leaving in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Deutsche Banc said it expects to name Yardeni's successor on or
before April 22, when he starts his job at Prudential.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last year, Prudential Securities--a unit of Prudential
Financial--has tried to cultivate an image as a brokerage more in
tune with individual investors' needs than its rivals.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the firm has argued that because it does little
investment banking, its stock analysts are free of typical brokerage
conflict-of-interest risks.</TE>
<TE>   Yardeni is relatively upbeat on the stock market. He expects the
Dow Jones industrial average to end the year at 11,500, which would
be a gain of 16% from Wednesday's close.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said he left Prudential after the firm declined his request
to manage money.</TE>
<TE>   Times Staff, Bloomberg News</TE>
<TE>   Briefly</TE>
<TE>   LIN TV Corp., a major owner of U.S. TV stations, filed Wednesday
for a $300-million initial public stock offering. Providence,
R.I.-based LIN owns 26 network affiliated and independent stations.</TE>
<TE>   LIN was taken over in a $2-billion buyout by the closely held
investment firm Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst in March 1998.</TE>
<TE>   With a new round of consolidation expected in the media business
in the wake of a court ruling this week favoring large media
companies, some analysts questioned whether LIN might be bought out
before the IPO.</TE>
<TE>   The company didn't indicate how many shares it expects to sell.</TE>

<LD>The Super Bowl of the Winter Olympics, at least as far as North
American television audiences are concerned, will be decided tonight
in the women's freestyle program. Michelle Kwan of Torrance, leading
after Tuesday night's short program, tries to win the gold medal that
was denied her four years ago when she played it safe in the long
program and lost to Tara Lipinski.</LD>
<LD>   Kwan knows she will have to skate more aggressively this time to
win and hold off second-place Russian Irina Slutskaya, who is
superior technically but not artistically, and third-place Sasha
Cohen of Laguna Niguel, who combines both elements better than the
others but is inexperienced in international competition. The third
American, Sarah Hughes, is fourth. The freestyle program counts
toward two-thirds of the final score.</LD>

<LD>Although he is stronger in the upcoming slalom, Bode Miller has a
solid chance for a medal in today's giant slalom.</LD>
<LD>   Early this season, Miller, who finished second in last week's
combined, became the first American to win a World Cup giant slalom
race since Phil Mahre in 1983. Other contenders include France's

<HD>Still a Long Night to Go</HD>
<DH>Kwan has the lead after figure skating short program, but
other contenders aren't conceding a thing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Every step of the way, Michelle Kwan has insisted she's not motivated
by the potential rewards at the end of her Olympic journey, but by
the richness of the experiences en route.</LD>
<LD>   The favorite to win the gold medal at the 1998 Nagano
Games--especially after she entered the final phase of the
competition in first place--she was passed by a more exuberant and
relaxed Tara Lipinski and instead got the silver medal. Tested since
then by injury and ennui, pushed to her physical limits by the
phenoms who burst onto the figure skating scene every few years, the
Torrance native has learned a lifetime of lessons in the past four
years.</LD>
<LD>   Since Nagano, Kwan has reached many milestones. She turned 21,
briefly enrolled in college, began her first serious romance, dropped
longtime coach Frank Carroll and, in between, won three world
championships and four U.S. titles.</LD>
<TE>   Yet, despite the distance she has traveled, she will be in the
same situation tonight at the Salt Lake Ice Center as she was four
years ago--the leader and favorite facing a younger, sassier and
undeniably appealing challenger.</TE>
<TE>   Kwan, who earned 5.9 scores (out of a possible 6.0) across the
board for the presentation of her Rachmaninoff short program Tuesday,
will need similar presentation and technical scores tonight to defeat
Russia's Irina Slutskaya and teenage compatriots Sasha Cohen and
Sarah Hughes, who rank 2-3-4. It won't be easy.</TE>
<TE>   Slutskaya did a more technically demanding short program than Kwan
and plans a more demanding long program, perhaps thinking she can
trump Kwan's invariably good presentation scores with tough jumps
that win her technical points. Cohen, the 17-year-old from Laguna
Niguel, mesmerized the judges and audience with her grace and
musicality, and proved in her second-place finish at last month's
U.S. championships she could put a fresh spin on the much-used opera
"Carmen."</TE>
<TE>   Hughes can win gold only if someone above her falters. But the
16-year-old New Yorker has enormous talent--and a victory over Kwan
to her credit at the Skate Canada competition in November. Maria
Butyrskaya, the 1999 world champion from Russia, probably can't rise
from fifth to first but isn't out of the medal picture.</TE>
<TE>   "You just have to be calm," Kwan said recently. "Every competition
is just like this. You've just got to put it together, I guess, and
just enjoy it.</TE>
<TE>   "Your preparation is already done. You're here now, and you just
want to keep up what you've been training for a long time."</TE>
<TE>   Any of the top three can win the gold medal by being ranked first
in tonight's free skate, worth two-thirds of the final score. For
Hughes to win, she would have to be judged first in the free skate
and Kwan would have to rank third or lower.</TE>
<TE>   No one has moved up from fourth to first at the Olympics, but it
has happened at the World Championships, albeit under a different
scoring system.</TE>
<TE>   At the 1982 world competition, Elaine Zayak was fourth in the
compulsory figures and 10th in the short program, placing her seventh
overall entering the long program. She won the final phase and won
the title, but the long program wasn't as large a percentage of the
final score as it is now.</TE>
<TE>   In the only similar rally since compulsory figures were
eliminated, Elvis Stojko of Canada won the 1997 world title despite
ranking fourth after the short program. However, he had help when
leader Alexei Urmanov withdrew because of an injury.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes' coach, Robin Wagner, said Hughes is undaunted.</TE>
<TE>   "She was not down at all. She's happy with her position," Wagner
said Wednesday, when the competitors declined to speak to reporters
after their practice.</TE>
<TE>   "She feels very comfortable and relaxed fighting for position.
She's just looking at it as she'd love to get a medal, and she's
certainly capable of doing it from fourth place. She feels like she's
not holding onto a place, she's going for it....</TE>
<TE>   "She's maybe better off being in a position where she's the
chaser, instead of being chased. It fires up a little something in
her competitive nature. She's pleased to be fourth after the girls
put out a lot of clean, strong short programs."</TE>
<TE>   No matter what happens, several intriguing possibilities could
become reality.</TE>
<TE>   Kwan, already assured of figure skating immortality with four
world titles, six U.S. titles and an Olympic silver medal, could
become the third woman to win the gold after winning silver, as
Tenley Albright and Carol Heiss have done. Slutskaya could become the
first Russian woman to win a women's singles gold medal. Cohen could
win gold without having competed at the World Championships, flouting
conventional wisdom that figure skaters must pay their dues for years
before the judges let them triumph.</TE>
<TE>   It's also possible the U.S. women will record their first Olympic
figure skating medals sweep, a distinction earned by their male
counterparts in 1956 when Hayes Jenkins, Ronnie Robertson and David
Jenkins finished 1-2-3.</TE>
<TE>   "Michelle, if she does [everything with] her technical ability
like she normally does and skates with energy and passion, she's
going to be very difficult to beat," said Richard Callaghan, who
coached Lipinski to gold in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "However, this year is great, with the depth in the ladies
[field]. So I don't think any of us know what's really going to
happen there. Sasha could surprise everyone and so can Sarah. It's
going to be a really great event to watch."</TE>
<TE>   Cohen's coach, John Nicks, said his headstrong pupil has remained
resolute in the face of enormous pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "She told me she was very, very calm [Tuesday] night and serene,"
he said. "I think she meant she was very confident. The only
nervousness she told me about was 20 minutes before she went on.</TE>
<TE>   "She's very focused. Extremely focused. Sometimes she has a very
narrow focus. That's why my comments don't seem to register with her
at times."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if Cohen can beat Kwan if both skate cleanly, Nicks didn't
flinch. "I think," he said, "it would be very difficult to separate
them."</TE>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The color combination is deep, striking, tough enough for the
Pittsburgh Steelers, pretty enough for a sunflower.</LD>
<LD>   But, for 78 years, absent from the Winter Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   Until this week, when a bundled-up track star from the Deep South
painted the town with it.</LD>
<TE>   Black and gold.</TE>
<TE>   Forever in the person of Vonetta Flowers, the first African
American gold medalist in Winter Olympic history.</TE>
<TE>   Black and gold.</TE>
<TE>   How beautiful it looked.</TE>
<TE>   How sadly strange it looked.</TE>
<TE>   For those who dominate these winter sports, it seems that gold
medals sometimes come from birth or geography.</TE>
<TE>   For the first black winner, it took the miracle of a bobsledder
from Birmingham, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   "My husband always told me, 'God put you in this sport for a
reason,'" Flowers said Wednesday morning, shaking her head. "But I
never expected to be here."</TE>
<TE>   Who would? Who could?</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday night, Flowers had teamed with Jill Bakken to finish
first in the two-woman bobsled, stunning not only the German
favorites but their much-hyped U.S. teammates, Jean Racine and Gea
Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Gold, even though as recently as two years ago, Flowers had</TE>
<TE>   never even seen a bobsled in person.</TE>
<TE>   "Only in that movie 'Cool Runnings,'" she said.</TE>
<TE>   Gold, even though she tried out for the team only as a joke.</TE>
<TE>   "I told her, how many of your friends in Birmingham could say they
actually tried out for a bobsled team," recalled her husband, Johnny.</TE>
<TE>   Gold, even though once she made the team, she was worried her
family's modest budget wouldn't survive the surprising, staggering
expense of ... long johns.</TE>
<TE>   "I hated the cold," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Gold, even though she was black.</TE>
<TE>   This would not be a big deal in almost any other athletic endeavor
in this country. But spend 10 minutes looking around the Winter
Olympics and you realize, this is different.</TE>
<TE>   This is not an open competition. These are not necessarily
America's best athletes.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, with the likes of Jennifer Rodriguez, Derek Parra and
Michelle Kwan, the U.S. team is more diversified than other nations.</TE>
<TE>   But of 211 Olympians, only four are black.</TE>
<TE>   Our U.S. Winter Olympic playing field is about as level as the
downhill run.</TE>
<TE>   Where are the greatest sprinters from Florida? Can't they learn to
skate?</TE>
<TE>   Where are all the linebackers from Texas? Couldn't someone teach
them how to downhill ski?</TE>
<TE>   While every other sport in this country dusts every baseboard
looking for the best athletes, our winter sports have it backward.</TE>
<TE>   "They sit around and wait for the athletes to come to them," said
Bonny Warner, the veteran bobsled driver. "Because there's not a lot
of facilities in your backyard, if you don't come, you can't play."</TE>
<TE>   So while 20 athletes list their home state as Minnesota, only
three list Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "The great athletes are there, we just don't look hard enough,"
Warner said. "I guarantee you, if I knew the criteria for ski jumper,
I could go to Florida and come back with a ski jumper."</TE>
<TE>   It was this philosophy that, in the summer of 2000, took Warner to
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   There, in the stifling heat of the Olympic track and field trials,
she searched for someone to push her bobsled.</TE>
<TE>   Thus Vonetta Flowers began the road to Olympic gold by ...
answering a flier?</TE>
<TE>   "I needed someone who was strong and fast, and this place was
filled with great athletes like that," Warner said. "So I asked the
organizers if I could pass out the fliers."</TE>
<TE>   By wonderful coincidence, Flowers, a college long jump and triple
jump star, struggled with an ankle injury and had a poor meet.</TE>
<TE>   By an even better coincidence, her husband Johnny saw one of those
fliers.</TE>
<TE>   By an otherworldly coincidence, tryouts were on the one day when
they were not seeing the sights.</TE>
<TE>   "She was finished competing, I was in charge of the vacation, and
we had gone to places like Fisherman's Wharf and Lake Tahoe," he
said. "But I didn't have anything planned that day."</TE>
<TE>   Still, when he drove his wife to a test that included sprinting,
jumping and putting the shot, only one thing was on their minds.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a joke," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I had never even seen a bobsled up close," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But she passed the test and was invited to Germany for more tests
with an actual bobsled. And now she knew this Bonny Warner was crazy.</TE>
<TE>   "The hardest part was convincing her that she could win a medal in
this," Warner said. "It was like telling her, 'Yeah, you can win a
million dollars.' And she was like, 'Yeah, right.'"</TE>
<TE>   Warner recruited four athletes from those trials. She left with
one.</TE>
<TE>   "Flowers was the only one who believed me," she said.</TE>
<TE>   After her first time in a bobsled a couple of months later, that
belief faded.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very scary," Flowers said. "Nobody told me about the G
force. When I was done, I was dizzy."</TE>
<TE>   But, remembering this was her chance for a medal, she tried it
again. With her speed and powerful push, she finally made it work.</TE>
<TE>   The hardest part, it turns out, was never inside the sled. It was
on the streets of Birmingham.</TE>
<TE>   There, people still couldn't believe that there even existed such
a thing as a bobsled.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband, who works for Blue Cross, scoured the area for
donations. Only three companies, including Blue Cross, offered any
help.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody in Alabama could understand why anybody would want to ride
in a bobsled," he said.</TE>
<TE>   To this day, Flowers has no sponsors, no endorsements, not even an
agent.</TE>
<TE>   And as recently as November, she didn't even have a team.</TE>
<TE>   Flowers finished in the top 10 in all seven World Cup races last
season with Warner. But in October, the veteran driver asked her to
compete with strong newcomer Gea Johnson for the spot of brakewoman
for this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time a new athlete like that shows up, you want to see who is
the fastest, it's nothing personal," Warner said.</TE>
<TE>   But while this choice of speed over loyalty is commonplace in the
cutthroat world of bobsledding, Flowers didn't understand it, and
quit the sport.</TE>
<TE>   "I was done," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "But I wasn't going to let her quit," said her husband.</TE>
<TE>   So during November, every day at 5 a.m., before Johnny went to
Blue Cross and Vonetta went to her job as assistant track coach at
Alabama Birmingham, they trained.</TE>
<TE>   And every night after work, they trained.</TE>
<TE>   And finally, Bakken called and asked her to compete with</TE>
<TE>   another brakewoman to join her team.</TE>
<TE>   Flowers won the push-off, and eventually joined Bakken and headed
to the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   But, of course, they were the other team.</TE>
<TE>   The hot duo was Racine and Johnson. They posed for posters. They
were featured in sportscasts.</TE>
<TE>   Most thought Bakken and Flowers didn't have a chance.</TE>
<TE>   This is why, to some, the final chapter in Flowers' gold rush was
the most unusual of all.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, after Johnson injured her hamstring, Racine called
Flowers and asked her to switch teams one more time.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, just two days before the event.</TE>
<TE>   The woman who had already dropped longtime teammate Jen Davidson
to add Johnson was now willing to dump Johnson and ruin another team.</TE>
<TE>   Despite this nastiness, others in the sport still would have
switched. After all, Racine is considered one of the best drivers in
the world.</TE>
<TE>   But Flowers is not like the others, and, for the last time, proved
it.</TE>
<TE>   "The conversation lasted about four minutes," she said. "I told
her no. I was going to be loyal to Jill."</TE>
<TE>   The bond proved stronger than all others Tuesday, and now Flowers
has unwittingly been forced into another bond.</TE>
<TE>   Like it or not, she must represent not only her country, but her
ethnicity.</TE>
<TE>   To which she responds, it's about time.</TE>
<TE>   "I just hope this medal drives younger African Americans to give
the winter sports a try," she said. "There's just not a lot of
opportunities out there."</TE>
<TE>   There's one more today. All it took was a flier and some
fearlessness.</TE>
<TE>   And a snowball in hell melting on a bobsledder from Birmingham.</TE>

<HD>Ohno Wins in a Strange Turn</HD>
<DH>The U.S. short-track speedskater gets gold in the 1,500
meters after a South Korean is disqualified.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Short-track speedskating sensation Apolo Anton Ohno, who just days
ago had to settle for a silver medal in a wild scramble near the
finish line, won a controversial gold late Wednesday in the 1,500
meters--controversial because he indisputably was the second skater
across the line.</LD>
<LD>   In yet another vivid example of the rousing theater that along
with spills, thrills and arcane rules marks short-track speedskating,
Ohno, the 19-year-old from Seattle, appeared to have come up just
short in the first-ever men's Olympic 1,500-meter short-track race,
behind South Korea's Kim Dong-Sung.</LD>
<LD>   But International Skating Union judges--the same federation at the
heart of the figure skating judging controversy last week involving
the Canadian and Russian pairs skaters--ruled that Kim had impeded
Ohno's track on the backstretch of the final lap. Kim was
disqualified. Ohno was declared the winner, in 2 minutes 18.541
seconds.</LD>
<TE>   China's Li Jiajun moved up to silver, Canada's Marc Gagnon to
bronze.</TE>
<TE>   Even though he'd crossed the line second, Ohno had pumped his fist
in satisfaction, apparently confident the call would go his way. When
it was announced just moments later to a deafening roar from the
crowd at the Salt Lake Ice Center that Ohno had indeed been
proclaimed the winner, he skated to the center of the rink and kissed
the ice.</TE>
<TE>   "They can just go throw me in the desert and bury me," Ohno said
afterward. "I got a gold medal. I'm good now."</TE>
<TE>   Just five days ago, Ohno, bidding to win four medals, had been
denied gold in the first of his races at these Games, the 1,000
meters, taken out in a four-man pileup just yards from the finish. He
had been in the lead. He recovered to slide across the line second,
behind Australia's Steven Bradbury.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday night, Ohno, who holds the world record in the 1,500
meters, hung back for several laps, then, late in the race, emerged
at the front of the pack. Heading into the next-to-last turn, Kim
attempted to pass on the inside.</TE>
<TE>   Ohno pulled back and threw up his hands for just an instant, then
resumed skating. Was that move to avoid contact? To alert judges to a
possible infraction? Did Ohno, like a basketball player faking a
charging call, play the part with just a tad too much drama?</TE>
<TE>   "I saw no foul," said Lee Chi Sang, an official with the South
Korean delegation. Another senior Korean official, who asked not to
be named, said a protest would be filed with the ISU.</TE>
<TE>   Kim, who in the moments after crossing the finish line first had
been skating a victory lap with the South Korean flag held aloft,
threw the flag to the ice upon hearing he had been disqualified. He
won the 1,000-meter race at the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano and for
years has been considered one of the world's best short-track
speedskaters.</TE>
<TE>   Fabio Carta of Italy, who finished fourth in Saturday's
race--moved up from fifth after the judges' ruling--said, "It's
absurd that the Korean was disqualified. I don't know what happened."</TE>
<TE>   Carta also said while watching a replay of the incident, pointing
at the monitor, "We should use a rifle on Ohno." It was not clear
what prompted that outburst--whether Carta was frustrated at Ohno's
amazing athletic ability, particularly the way he usually slithers in
and out of the packs that define short-track racing, or at something
more sinister.</TE>
<TE>   Asked in a news conference after the race about Carta's comments
that Kim's disqualification was "absurd," Ohno responded, "People are
going to question any outcome. But people who saw the race, that's
what really matters."</TE>
<TE>   The foul is called "cross-tracking," and Ohno said, "I came out of
the corner with great acceleration, came on him real tight, got
inside of him and he just moved over on me, changed my track a little
bit."</TE>
<TE>   He added, "He definitely came over on me. Good call."</TE>
<TE>   Asked straight-out, however, if he had been faking to draw the
call, Ohno said, "I had to stand up or else we would have hit."</TE>
<TE>   In the crash that concluded the 1,000 meters Saturday, Ohno
suffered a cut to the inside of his leg that required six stitches to
close. The leg appeared not to bother him Wednesday, and he said of
the pro-American crowd, "If it wasn't for them, I wouldn't have had
so much energy the last couple laps to make such a daring move. Thank
God my injury healed up fast and allowed me to do my best."</TE>
<TE>   Ohno's next--and final two--events will come Saturday, the 500
meters and the 5,000-meter relay. He said of Wednesday's race, "I
just gave my best and I shined, like a star or something. I saw my
chance and took it."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Turns Skeleton Key</HD>
<DH>Shea, a third-generation Olympian, and hometown favorite
Gale give Americans sweep in rarely held event.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>Jim Shea Jr., son of an Olympic skier and grandson of an Olympic gold
medal-winning skater, won the men's skeleton race Wednesday in a
storybook victory that served as a ringing affirmation of the Olympic
spirit and the value of family and community.</LD>
<LD>   In triumph, however, there also came a reminder of the way life's
most joyous moments can sometimes be so bittersweet. Shea's
91-year-old grandfather, Jack, died last month after a van that
police said was driven by a drunk driver slid out of control on a
road in Lake Placid, N.Y., striking Shea's car.</LD>
<LD>   If only, friends and family said, the elder Shea could have lived
just a few weeks more, to watch his grandson will his way to gold in
the first men's skeleton competition in the Winter Games since 1948.
Racing a sled headfirst down the icy Olympic bobsled course at speeds
approaching 80 mph, the grandson carried with him--safely tucked into
his helmet--a photo of his grandfather.</LD>
<TE>   "I definitely felt him here today," the 33-year-old from Lake
Placid said of his grandfather, adding, "He had some unfinished
business before he went on to heaven. Now he can go."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Shea Sr. felt it too: "I think my dad, his grandpa, was there
giving him that little extra push."</TE>
<TE>   Shea's win marked the first of three medals the U.S. team won
Wednesday in skeleton racing. Shortly after Shea took first in the
men's event, Tristan Gale, 21, of Salt Lake City, who works at a Home
Depot store, slid to first in the inaugural women's skeleton
competition and Lea Ann Parsley, 33, of Granville, Ohio, a
firefighter and registered nurse, took silver.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Shea Sr. and Jr. were honored as two of the final bearers of
the Olympic torch before the lighting of the caldron at Rice-Eccles
Stadium during the opening ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Shea was supposed to have been there too--making it three
generations of U.S. Olympians, believed to be a first for the United
States in the history of the modern Games.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Shea won gold in the 500- and 1,500-meter speedskating races
in the 1932 Lake Placid Games. Jim Shea Sr. competed in three Nordic
events in the 1964 Winter Games at Innsbruck.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Shea Sr. called Wednesday "the most special day in my life.
Seventy years ago, my dad, Jimmy's grandfather, won [two gold medals]
at the 1932 Games. Now, to have that repeated by his grandson--words
cannot describe the joy that my entire family and community has for
Jim."</TE>
<TE>   The grandfather passed on to his son and grandson the reasons to
keep believing in the Games despite corruption, scandal and
commercialization--the reasons why it's still possible to retain a
sense of idealism, why the Games remain a vessel into which people
from around the world invest their hopes and dreams.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad preached the true Olympic gospel of taking part in
friendly competition for the honor and glory of sports," Jim Shea Sr.
said Wednesday. "He ingrained that in Jimmy's mind."</TE>
<TE>   But the elder Shea wasn't willing to let his vision of the Olympic
ideal, no matter how central it was to his soul, be used for
propaganda purposes. After winning two gold medals in 1932, he was
still the best in the world four years later when the 1936 Winter
Games were to be held in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. But Shea,
whose father owned a Lake Placid grocery that served many Jewish
customers, refused to go. It was his way of protesting what he called
the "crime against humanity" that was occurring in Germany in the
1930s--the years leading up to the Nazi holocaust.</TE>
<TE>   This past December, Jack Shea carried the Olympic flame around the
Lake Placid skating oval and then gave a speech that moved many in
the audience to tears.</TE>
<TE>   Skeleton riders slide down the bobsled course on special sleds,
face-first, arms at their sides, chins only inches off the ice.</TE>
<TE>   Skeleton racing was featured in the Games in 1928 and 1948, both
times in St. Moritz, Switzerland, where the sport originated on a
course called the Cresta Run--to this day still crafted each winter
from snowfall.</TE>
<TE>   "They say bobsled is the champagne of thrills," Jim Shea Jr. said
Wednesday. "Skeleton is definitely the moonshine of thrills."</TE>
<TE>   Over the past several years, Jim Shea Jr. has been a vocal
advocate for the return of skeleton to the Olympic program. The
family lineage and his own increasing visibility--he won the 1999
world championship--helped in the lobbying effort.</TE>
<TE>   Although he made plain Wednesday that it was far from a one-man
effort, he joked: "I knocked on every outhouse, doghouse, henhouse. I
even went to the White House, twice."</TE>
<TE>   He said skeleton is now a "fast-growing sport," one that has gone
from "the back page to the front page" in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps that's because it's one of the few Olympic sports that
involves sensations almost everyone can appreciate, at least anyone
who has ever slid down a snowy hill on a sled or even on a garbage
can lid, Shea and others said.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers sold 15,000 tickets to Wednesday's race; racing began
at 9 a.m. and at 6:45 a.m., even though it was snowing heavily,
spectators were lined up 10 deep at the airport-style metal
detectors, eager to get in.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's Olympic final drew 26 racers for two runs. The course
features 15 turns and is just over three-quarters of a mile long.</TE>
<TE>   On the first run, Shea, starting fourth, recorded the fastest
time, 50.89 seconds, .13 ahead of Austria's Martin Rettl.
Switzerland's Gregor Staehli was .27 back.</TE>
<TE>   On their second runs both Rettl and Staehli finished in exactly
the same time--50.99 seconds. With Shea at the starting gate, Rettl
had the lead, Staehli was in second.</TE>
<TE>   Heading into the bottom part of the course, Shea was slightly
behind Rettl's combined time, according to race results. But,
somehow, Shea picked up speed and finished in 51.07--a combined time
of 1:41.96, a mere .05 ahead of Rettl. Staehli dropped to third, in
1:42.15.</TE>
<TE>   At the finish line, Jim Shea Jr. fumbled for the photo of his
grandfather that went with him, finally got it out of his helmet,
showed it to anyone who wanted to see, clambered on walls, slapped
high-fives with fans, breathlessly did TV interviews--and hugged
Rettl and Staehli, his good friends.</TE>
<TE>   He dedicated his victory to "all the sliders who came before me."</TE>
<TE>   Watching her son reveling in the moment, Jim Shea Jr.'s mother,
Judy, said, "Grandpa would have loved it."</TE>
<TE>   Her husband, Jim Shea Sr. agreed: "He'd have cried."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIDWAY, Utah</DL>
<LD>Just a short distance from his home in the Norwegian countryside, Ole
Einar Bjoerndalen spotted a strip of snow. It was exactly what he had
been searching for on this winter day.</LD>
<LD>   Bjoerndalen, then 13, ran back to the family farm, jumped on his
father's tractor and returned to the only bit of snow hidden from the
sun during an unusually warm stretch of the season. He carved two
perfectly even tracks into the 200-meter patch, making himself a
cross-country course.</LD>
<LD>   He desperately wanted to ski. So he did. He traveled back and
forth, getting to one end and turning around to head the other way.
He never tired, skiing all day and into the pitch-black night.</LD>
<TE>   Passionate. Persistent. Precise. This is Ole Einar Bjoerndalen.</TE>
<TE>   Bjoerndalen became only the third Olympian to win four gold medals
at a single Games when Norway won the men's 30-kilometer biathlon
relay Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "This is very special," Bjoerndalen said.</TE>
<TE>   Three-time defending Olympic champion Germany won the silver and
France took the bronze.</TE>
<TE>   Only two others have won four gold medals in one Winter Olympics:
American speedskater Eric Heiden and Russian speedskater Lydia
Skoblikova. Heiden won five at the 1980 Lake Placid Games; Skoblikova
won four in 1964 at Innsbruck.</TE>
<TE>   "The last gold was the most important because it was the whole
team--something we did together," Bjoerndalen said. "We were really
working hard all year together."</TE>
<TE>   Bjoerndalen swept the biathlon events here, winning three
individual races and then the team relay. He could have gone for a
fifth gold in the 50-kilometer cross-country race Saturday, but he
decided to skip the event.</TE>
<TE>   "Of history, I don't think so much," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Norwegians--Halvard Hanevold, Frode Andresen, Egil Gjelland
and Bjoerndalen--covered the Soldier Hollow course in 1 hour 23
minutes 42.3 seconds. Germany was 45.3 seconds behind.</TE>
<TE>   The young U.S. team of Jeremy Teela, Jay Hakkinen, Dan Campbell
and Lawton Redman finished 15th in the 19-team field, almost seven
minutes behind Norway.</TE>
<TE>   As Bjoerndalen crossed the finish line, he screamed loudly while
repeatedly pumping both poles into the air.</TE>
<TE>   His teammates quickly greeted him with hugs, then Gjelland picked
him up and put him on his shoulders for a victory ride--a tribute to
the world's finest biathlete.</TE>

<TE>   Getting this far is a surprise for the U.S. team. It's a
disappointment for the Canadians, who lost only once during the
preliminaries. Curling is arguably the second biggest sport in Canada
behind hockey and the team's stars have agents and endorsements.</TE>
<TE>   "We came here as a very strong country in curling. And when you're
from Canada, you expected to get gold," said Canadian Julie Skinner.</TE>
<TE>   In the men's semis on Wednesday, Canada advanced to Friday's
gold-medal game with a 6-4 victory over world champion Sweden.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadians will play Norway, 7-6 winners in extra time over
defending Olympic champion Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   The American women, winners of four straight matches after
starting 2-3 in round-robin play, conceded their semifinal after nine
ends--or innings--when Switzerland scored three in the ninth on a
shot by team skip Luzia Ebnoether.</TE>
<TE>   Erickson had led the Americans to a 3-3 tie at the end of the
fifth, but Switzerland soon added three more to make it 6-3.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the eighth we decided to draw for one and try to
steal the game in the ninth," Erickson said. "It was a good choice
for us, but it didn't work."</TE>
<TE>   In the other women's semifinal, Britain defeated defending gold
medalist Canada, 6-5.</TE>

<LD>Maria Butyrskaya</LD>
<LD>   Rundown: Age--29, Country--Russia; Order--19th, Place--Fifth</LD>
<LD>   Music: "Tale of a Journey" by Alfred Schnittke.</LD>
<TE>   Coaches: Elena Tchaikovskaya, Vladimir Kotin.</TE>
<TE>   What to look for: Graceful and balletic, she's the oldest
competitor in the final six. Tried triple toe loop-half loop-triple
salchow at Grand Prix final but turned final part of that combination
into a double. She might try it again tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellaneous: Was third after short program at 1998 Nagano Games
and finished fourth....Was the 1999 world champion and has won three
European titles....Underwent abdominal surgery in December.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sarah Hughes</TE>
<TE>   Rundown: Age--16; Country--U.S.; Order--20; Place--Fourth</TE>
<TE>   Music: "Daphnis et Chloe" by Ravel, "Rhapsody on a Theme of
Paganini" by Sergei Rachmaninoff, "Piano Concerto No. 2, Adagio" by
Rachmaninoff.</TE>
<TE>   Coach/Choreographer: Robin Wagner.</TE>
<TE>   What to look for: Will she relax and simply let go, or will she
give in to the nerves that have plagued her since she has been here?
She has the technical ability to win and might try two triple-triple
combination jumps. She has done a triple salchow-triple loop and
could try the triple toe-triple toe or triple lutz-triple toe.
Reworked the last 90 seconds of her program since the U.S.
championships to make it more dramatic.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellaneous: Placed third at last year's World Championships at
15....Was third at Grand Prix final....Lives in Great Neck, N.Y., and
trains in Hackensack, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sasha Cohen</TE>
<TE>   Rundown: Age--17; Country--U.S.; Order--22; Place--Third</TE>
<TE>   Music: "Carmen" by George Bizet.</TE>
<TE>   Coach/ Choreographer: John Nicks.</TE>
<TE>   What to look for: When she's on, she's riveting because of her
balletic movements. Blessed with remarkable flexibility that allows
her to reach behind her back, pull her free leg up and grab the blade
for a spectacular spin. Also lifts free leg high in front while
spinning rapidly. Did several clean triple lutz-triple toe
combinations in practice Wednesday and could include one today.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellaneous: Laguna Niguel teenager has never competed at World
Championships because the only other year she qualified, in 1998, she
was 15 and didn't meet age minimum....Missed much of last season
because of a stress fracture in her back and must do exercises and
stretch to keep limber.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Michelle Kwan</TE>
<TE>   Rundown: Age--21; Country--U.S.; Order--23; Place--First</TE>
<TE>   Music: "Sheherezade," by Nikolai Rimsky- Korsakov.</TE>
<TE>   Coach: None. Choreographer: Sarah Kawahara.</TE>
<TE>   What to look for: She might not be the best jumper or best
spinner, but her line and her artistry are above reproach. She hasn't
landed a triple-triple this season but could try a triple toe
loop-triple toe loop, which she two-footed in practice Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellaneous: Won silver at Nagano in 1998 and is trying to
become third woman to move up to Olympic gold after winning silver.
Tenley Albright (silver in 1952, gold in 1956) and Carol Heiss
(silver in 1956, gold in 1960) are the others. Trains in Lake
Arrowhead.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<TE>   Music: "Tosca," by Puccini.</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Zhanna Gramova. Choreographer: Giuseppe Arena.</TE>
<TE>   What to look for: If Kwan performs well, Slutskaya might have to
take a chance and try the triple salchow-triple loop-half loop-triple
salchow she has toyed with in practice. That could give her technical
points and help balance Kwan's presentation scores.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellaneous: Husband, Sergei Mikheyev, won't be in the audience
because she doesn't want to be distracted and "he has a job." ...
Finished fifth at Nagano....Landed an unprecedented triple
salchow-triple loop-double toe loop at last year's world
championships.</TE>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Michelle Kwan is a world-class figure skater. Her father is a
world-class pacer. When she skates, he looks like a man who needs a
cigarette.</LD>
<LD>   No, he says, never again. Danny Kwan has quit smoking.</LD>
<LD>   Michelle would like to take credit, but she can't. Four years ago,
when they were in Nagano for the Winter Olympics, she fined him $20
for each cigarette he smoked.</LD>
<TE>   "I figure I owe her about $60,000," he said then.</TE>
<TE>   The tab was approaching $600,000 by last year. But then came some
real motivation for Danny. A friend of his had lung cancer. He had a
short time to live.</TE>
<TE>   "When people came to visit him, I could see pity in their eyes,"
Danny says. He hasn't smoked a cigarette since.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want anybody pitying me," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Danny Kwan, 52, is a proud man. When you hear his story--where he
came from, how hard he and his family have worked to get where they
are, the sacrifices they have made--you understand.</TE>
<TE>   But Danny doesn't talk about his story anymore. Or much of
anything publicly. I saw him on the street one night last week. We
chatted amiably, but at the point when he thought I might be
interviewing him, he politely excused himself.</TE>
<TE>   He has never wanted to become the focus of his daughter's story.
He wants the attention even less now that some in the media are
questioning his role in the firing of Michelle's longtime coach,
Frank Carroll, trying to portray Danny as the Richard Williams of
figure skating. Danny doesn't believe he should have to defend
himself. So he doesn't. He's too proud.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know who fired Carroll, but, as someone who first met
Michelle when she was 12, I can almost guarantee it wasn't done
unless she wanted it done.</TE>
<TE>   As Carroll, whose best female skater before Michelle was Linda
Fratianne, said when Michelle was only 13, "If you told Linda to jump
off the roof, she jumped off the roof. This kid wants a little more
input into it. She has respect for me, but I don't scare her."</TE>
<TE>   Michelle probably still respected Carroll when they parted last
year. But she's 21 now. She has been to college. She has her own
condo in Manhattan Beach. She has a boyfriend, an NHL player for the
Florida Panthers. She and Carroll, like sometimes happens in a
marriage, had grown apart.</TE>
<TE>   Her father and Carroll grew apart a long time before that. I doubt
Danny tried to talk Michelle out of leaving Carroll. But if anyone
outside the Kwan family says it was Danny's call, I would guess he or
she doesn't know Danny very well. Or Michelle.</TE>
<TE>   More insulting to the Kwans are those who criticize them for
living off Michelle.</TE>
<TE>   Let me tell you Danny Kwan's story.</TE>
<TE>   His father, who had been sold into slavery when he was 4 to a
farmer in Canton, China, went to Hong Kong in 1949 to look for work.
He left behind a wife who was seven months pregnant. Before he could
return, China's borders were shut. It would be seven years before he
was allowed to rejoin his wife--and introduce himself to his son,
Danny.</TE>
<TE>   Danny, whose family had little money, dropped out of school after
the seventh grade and went to work for the telephone company to learn
a trade.</TE>
<TE>   He was still working for the telephone company many years later,
as a systems analyst in Southern California, when it began to appear
as if his two daughters had a future in figure skating. The older
one, Karen, would finish fifth in the national championships before
leaving the sport for college. The other would become one of the
sport's great champions.</TE>
<TE>   Danny literally drove them to success. He would wake up before
dawn, drive them from their home in Torrance to Lake Arrowhead for
lessons, drive down the hill to work in Gardena, drive back up the
hill to pick up his daughters, then drive back to Torrance, where he
would work nights with wife Estella in the family restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   If the Kwans are living off Michelle, who's to say they haven't
earned it?</TE>
<TE>   Michelle, who earned $4 million last year, is the only one who has
the right to say that. She hasn't complained.</TE>
<TE>   Danny is the first to admit that he used to push Michelle too
hard, that the Olympic dream was more his than hers, but he says that
changed one night during her first senior national championships. She
tossed and turned all night, repeating her father's instructions from
that day's practice in her sleep, and he realized that she was under
enormous stress, too much for a 12-year-old, for anyone really.</TE>
<TE>   He went outside the motel room, smoked a cigarette and cried.</TE>
<TE>   "If you love your daughter, do you want to see her stressed?'' he
asked later. "Does it make any sense to give a sport a lot of time
and a lot of money just to make her crazy? These athletes are under
so much heat. I think about Donnie Moore....</TE>
<TE>   "The next day, I told her that she was probably going to be in
skating for another 10 years, which meant about 100 competitions....
I asked her if she was sure she wanted to go on. If she did, it had
to be because that's what she wanted for herself, not for me. It was
her choice, not mine."</TE>
<TE>   Michelle went on. Tonight, she has a chance to win an Olympic gold
medal. Because she doesn't have a coach, standing next to her in the
wings as she prepares to go onto the ice for her freestyle program
will be her father. I can't think of anything more appropriate.</TE>

<HD>Canada Is Underdog ... or Is It the U.S.?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. ADANDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>It's an age-old strategic debate. Blaze the trail or draft behind and
save energy before coming on strong at the end?</LD>
<LD>   Except this is women's ice hockey, not speedskating or auto
racing.</LD>
<LD>   And if the topic is women's ice hockey, the two teams must be the
United States and Canada, who will face each other today for the gold
medal.</LD>
<TE>   After watching Canada take every women's world championship since
its inception in 1990, the United States won the first time women's
hockey was included in the Olympic Games four years ago. And the
Americans won the last eight times they met in pre-Olympic
competition.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadians love it. They love that they aren't the favorites
coming into today's gold-medal matchup.</TE>
<TE>   "The pressure's on the USA," Canadian forward Cherie Piper said.</TE>
<TE>   Teammate Tammy Lee Shewchuk used the analogy of a car.</TE>
<TE>   "The way I like to think about it is, when you're behind, you can
see everything in front of you," she said. "When you're in front, you
only have a little space in the rearview mirror to see what's coming
at you. There are blind spots, there are things that can happen. The
position that we're in right now, we can see clearly, we can see
everything ahead of us. We know what's coming at us. And we're ready
for it."</TE>
<TE>   If Team USA were a car, it would be a Hummer, hogging the road and
prepared to overcome any obstacle off it. The U.S. has outscored its
opponents, 31-1, at the Olympics, continuing the theme of dominance
they established on their pre-Olympic tour.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, they'll try to convince you they're a little Honda
Civic on the way to the grocery store.</TE>
<TE>   "You can sway it either way you want," said Chris Bailey, who
plays defense for the U.S. "You can say now the pressure's on the
U.S. because they're defending, or you can say we haven't won a world
championship in seven tries, so we're still the underdog. You can
write it either way. The way we like to look at it, we focus on the
moment and not necessarily try to bear the burden ... of that
pressure you let build up over the year."</TE>
<TE>   The two teams are defined by each other. No other country has
beaten them. Turn to the "History and Record Book" section of the
Team USA media guide, and the first thing you'll see is the team's
record against Canada.</TE>
<TE>   "We know they're a very strong team," Bailey said. "It's like
looking in the mirror for us."</TE>
<TE>   Both are equally adept on offense and defense. Both have strong
goaltending (U.S. Coach Ben Smith will stick with his rotation and
play Sara DeCosta today; Kim St.-Pierre has received most of the
playing time for Canada).</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. won its games in the pre-Olympic tour by scores of 4-1,
4-1, 5-2, 4-3, 1-0, 3-1, 7-3 and 3-2.</TE>
<TE>   "Each game had a different identity," Smith said. "There's really
nothing where we can set it at 375 [degrees] and put it in the oven."</TE>
<TE>   "They just capitalized on their chances," Shewchuk said. "That was
the big thing for them. Their power play was good. But we're ready.
Heads up [tonight]."</TE>
<TE>   Hayley Wickenheiser has led Team Canada in scoring with six goals
and three assists. She preyed on earlier opponents in the tournament
by winning two faceoffs and taking the puck to score herself. U.S.
linemates Cammi Granato, 30, and Natalie Darwitz, 18, demonstrate how
the Americans have blended youth and experience. Granato has six
goals and three assists; Darwitz has three goals. But the teen
contingent might have to take a back seat to the veterans tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "I know the experience of having played in a gold-medal game will
help me," Granato said. "There's 14 players who have had that
experience.</TE>
<TE>   "Last time, I focused a lot on the outcome and didn't focus on the
60 minutes of hockey, so I didn't have the punch I needed for the
gold-medal game."</TE>
<TE>   Don't expect her to come with anything less than her best today,
in what could be her last game in a U.S. jersey.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely hard to come to grips with something like that,"
Granato said. "But we don't want to get caught up in it. We've worked
so hard to get where we are, we don't want to lose sight of our
goal."</TE>
<TE>   And they'd better keep an eye on that car in the mirror.</TE>

<HD>Belarus Stuns Sweden in Its Own 'Miracle'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. ADANDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>"Miracle on Ice" is taken, and there aren't too many other ways to
describe something that defies all predictions, logic and even the
laws of physics.</LD>
<LD>   So how do you explain Belarus 4, Sweden 3 in the quarterfinals of
the men's Olympic hockey tournament?</LD>
<LD>   "Sometimes even a gun without the bullets shoots," Belarussian
goalie Andrei Mezin said. "That's us today."</LD>
<TE>   "The Wonder Shot" is just as good a name as any, given the way
Belarus won, on a shot from near center ice that got past Swedish
goalie Tommy Salo with 2 minutes 24 seconds left in the game.</TE>
<TE>   An unlikely outcome? Yes. Unprecedented? Hmm.</TE>
<TE>   "It's happened before," Sweden Coach Hardy Nilsson said. "At
least, it happened in 1980."</TE>
<TE>   This result was just as unlikely as the U.S. college kids' upset
of the Soviet Union's professional machine in the semifinals at Lake
Placid, albeit without the Cold War subplot.</TE>
<TE>   In a tournament loaded with NHL stars, the Belarussians had only
one player currently in the league: Ruslan Salei of the Mighty Ducks.
They had to win their pool in the qualifying tournament last week
just to reach the final round. After a close loss to Russia, the
Belarussians were pounded by identical 8-1 scores versus Finland and
the United States. Sweden--led by Mats Sundin of the Toronto Maple
Leafs and Salo of the Edmonton Oilers among its 18 NHL players--had
played the best, most consistent hockey of any team during the final
round.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's unbelievable," Salei said. "Absolutely incredible.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody gave us a chance, but we wanted to play the best we
could."</TE>
<TE>   They exceeded Sweden's effort and won on the flukiest goal of the
tournament. Defenseman Vladimir Kopat, skating over the Olympic rings
logo near center ice, fired the puck at Salo. Salo said it hit him
"somewhere around my neck, and I thought I could get a glove on it. I
think it hit my glove."</TE>
<TE>   It dropped behind him and then trickled across the goal line, just
before diving Swedish defenseman Kenny Jonsson could reach it.</TE>
<TE>   "If I said I wanted to make this goal, nobody would have believed
me," Kopat said through an interpreter. "I just shoot behind the red
line, and that's what happened."</TE>
<TE>   Sundin blamed the rest of the team, rather than Salo.</TE>
<TE>   "When it's 3-3 that late in the game against a team we had a
chance to put away after one or two periods, anything can happen,"
Sundin said.</TE>
<TE>   Sweden outshot Belarus, 21-8, in the first period but emerged
trailing, 2-1, on Belarussian goals from Oleg Romanov and Dmitry
Dudik.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they weren't ready from the beginning," Mezin said. "They
took a lot of shots, but they didn't really want to score--of course
they want to, but they weren't hungry for the goal."</TE>
<TE>   Sweden tied the score on a power play goal by Michael Nylander
midway through the second period. Andrei Kovalev put Belarus ahead
2:47 into the third period, and Sundin scored his fifth goal of the
tournament to make it 3-3 at the 7:54 mark of the third.</TE>
<TE>   So Belarus, the former Soviet republic that became an independent
state in 1991, advanced to the semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good holiday for Belarus," Coach Vladimir Krikunov said.
"Our team never reached such a result as today."</TE>
<TE>   The breakaway republic's team consists of NHL castoffs, including
former King Vladimir Tsyplakov. Mezin, the goalie who made 44 saves
Wednesday, could never crack the league.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried for five years to make it to the NHL, because it was
always my dream," said Mezin, who plays for the Berlin Capitals of
the German Elite League. "I went from Tier 2 in Canada to the IHL,
but when I went to Fort Wayne, they had two NHL goalies there. I
tried other places and went everywhere, but then I went to Europe,
because it was too tough for me to make it."</TE>
<TE>   It was tough for the Swedes to take Wednesday's outcome.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a devastating loss for us and our country," forward Markus
Naslund said. "We have been playing well and something like this
happens."</TE>
<TE>   Things like this happen ... every two decades or so.</TE>

<DL>WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>Things are falling into place nicely for Team Canada. The Canadians
are growing more accustomed to each other and the international
hockey rules with each game.</LD>
<LD>   They knocked off Finland, 2-1, in the quarterfinals Wednesday and
now face the weakest of the remaining teams, surprising Belarus, in
the semifinals.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, Canada executive director Wayne Gretzky might interpret
that as more "American propaganda," designed to set his team up for a
disastrous fall.</LD>
<TE>   But listen to one of his own guys, defenseman Ed Jovanovski.</TE>
<TE>   "Guys are really stepping up and knowing what's at stake,"
Jovanovski said. "Guys are playing hard each shift they're out there
and it's showing in our play.</TE>
<TE>   "In our next game we want to be better. I thought today we played
a pretty fundamentally sound game and did a lot of things right.</TE>
<TE>   "We know in that locker room that we have the team and we're
capable of making big steps forward."</TE>
<TE>   However, Finland's Teemu Selanne wasn't completely impressed with
Canada's effort.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they were that good," Selanne said. "If we would
have played our best hockey, we would have had a better chance.</TE>
<TE>   "Those guys are great stars and maybe they don't have so many role
players. That might be the reason."</TE>
<TE>   Joe Sakic scored Canada's first goal exactly three minutes into
the game.</TE>
<TE>   Canada went up 2-0 in the second period when Steve Yzerman and
Mario Lemieux worked a give-and-go, Yzerman to Lemieux, back to
Yzerman, who whipped the puck past Jani Hurme.</TE>
<TE>   Finland came right back, when Tomi Kallio circled behind the net
and passed out front to Niklas Hagman for the point-blank shot 20
seconds later.</TE>
<TE>   That was it for the scoring. The third period featured less of the
wide-open style that has characterized the Olympics and more of a
grind. The two teams combined to take only 11 shots in the period.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not here to make a war with other countries," Canadian
goalie Martin Brodeur said. "We're here to win a gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   "Definitely the support from the organization is important, and
[Gretzky] showed that in his comments."</TE>
<TE>   These were Canadians with an attitude. Eric Lindros dumped Niklas
Hagman. Lemieux beat down Kimmo Timonen in the third period, knocking
him to the ice with a couple of good forearm shivers.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Kariya even tried to make a run at a Finland player against
the boards (Kariya bounced off).</TE>
<TE>   "As each game goes on, the intensity grows and the passion grows,"
Yzerman said.</TE>

<DL>PROVO, Utah</DL>
<LD>In his three trips to the Olympics, Dominik Hasek has seen only one
goalie dominate a game the way Nikolai Khabibulin did against the
Czech Republic Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "He had the same success that I did four years ago," Hasek said.
"It's not an easy thing."</LD>
<LD>   Khabibulin made 41 saves in an overwhelming performance,
outdueling Hasek and sending Russia into the semifinals with a 1-0
victory that eliminated the defending champions from the Czech
Republic.</LD>
<TE>   Maxim Afinogenov scored the only goal in the second period of a
rematch of the 1998 gold-medal game in Nagano, won, 1-0, by the
Czechs on the strength of Hasek's outstanding play.</TE>
<TE>   Hasek allowed only six goals in six games in Japan, culminating
with a shutout that he called the highlight of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, the longtime rivals' meeting was decided by
goaltending--but this time, Khabibulin put aside three days of
mediocre play with a display of puck-stopping that could only be
described as, well, Hasek-like.</TE>
<TE>   In the midst of an NHL season in which Khabibulin has begun to
supplant Hasek as the world's top goalie, the dominance of the "Bulin
Wall" was appropriate--if unexpected.</TE>
<TE>   Though Khabibulin said the win didn't mean as much as Hasek's
gold-medal victory, he now seems capable of carrying his nation to
gold just as Hasek did four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "This game meant a lot to us," said Khabibulin, cool and nearly
indifferent after the game. "We really didn't want to go home after
today....You can't tell if you're going to have a shutout or not. You
just go out there and do your best."</TE>
<TE>   Khabibulin was at his best in the frantic final minute, when he
made a breathtaking series of saves on point-blank chances for the
Czechs. Patrik Elias, Petr Sykora and Jaromir Jagr were denied in the
final 10 seconds during a wild scrum.</TE>
<TE>   After Russia won a face-off in its own zone with four seconds left
and cleared the puck, Khabibulin pumped his pads in the air before he
was mobbed by his teammates.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Hasek, 37, said the game was his final international
appearance for the Czech Republic.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very disappointed, but I also feel proud because of the way
we played," Hasek said. "Both teams had great chances, and I think we
had even more great chances. One goal was the difference."</TE>
<TE>   The game marked the highest point in Khabibulin's turbulent
career, which included a nearly two-season holdout from the Phoenix
Coyotes.</TE>
<TE>   This year, he is having an All-Star season for the Tampa Bay
Lightning.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Rout Is True Team Effort</HD>
<DH>The hockey squad beats Germany, 5-0, in the quarterfinals
by unifying and taking a few on the chin.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. ADANDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>If you want to get an idea of what's winning games for the United
States men's hockey team, start by looking at John LeClair's mouth.</LD>
<LD>   It was bright red and missing a tooth Wednesday evening, giving
him the look of a kid who just finished eating a cherry Popsicle. In
reality, he had tasted nothing but wood and tape, the victim of two
high sticks from German defensemen who tried to move him out of his
preferred spot next to the net. He was willing to pay the price to
help the team, drawing two penalties. And he was undeterred, going
right to his usual location to score a goal halfway through the
second period.</LD>
<LD>   Now take a look at the stat sheet from the United States' 5-0
victory over Germany in the quarterfinals. Compare the second-period
version to the final version. Note the goal 46 seconds into the
second period that was changed from Brett Hull's to Chris Chelios'.
That's because Hull waved off the credit he received for Chelios'
shot from the right side that eluded two players, caught a defender's
stick and went just inside the far post to give the U.S. a 2-0 lead.</LD>
<TE>   "That's his goal," Hull said. "It was tipped before I could get it
on my stick."</TE>
<TE>   Sharing the glory. Taking the punishment. Is it any wonder Coach
Herb Brooks' team is undefeated and one game away from playing for
the gold medal?</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, I think we're doing all the little things right,"
Chelios said.</TE>
<TE>   Next up is Russia in the rematch of the rematch. The two teams
tied, 2-2, Saturday in a heavily hyped game that marked their first
Olympic meeting in U.S. territory since the 1980 "Miracle on Ice."</TE>
<TE>   But the miracle that dominated conversation Wednesday was Belarus'
upset of Sweden in the first quarterfinal. Like Germany, Belarus made
it out of the qualifying round with a minimum of NHL players (Germany
had two, Belarus one). Safe to say, the Americans discussed Sweden's
surprise exit before their own game.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh God, yes," U.S. forward Jeremy Roenick said. "It was heavily
stressed in our locker room. There was a state of shock. We didn't
want to be the second team to have that misfortune happen."</TE>
<TE>   The Americans knew the Germans would stick with a defense-oriented
system and line up along the blue line to slow them down. Team USA
wanted to avoid penalties and get the early lead, which would force
the Germans to loosen up and take more chances.</TE>
<TE>   That's where LeClair--and his mouth--came in. He took a high stick
from Erich Goldmann that drew a five-minute penalty and game
misconduct. It also knocked out LeClair's tooth.</TE>
<TE>   Two and a half minutes into the penalty, Germany's Daniel Kunce
was called for interference, giving the United States a two-man
advantage. Roenick scored from the left side to put the United States
ahead, 1-0.</TE>
<TE>   After Chelios' goal, the ice did open up.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Amonte and Roenick--who played together on the Chicago
Blackhawks for two seasons in the mid-1990s--hooked up for a pretty
two-on-one goal. Amonte fed Roenick, who passed back to Amonte for
the goal.</TE>
<TE>   "After it went in, Tony gave me a quick look and told me, 'That's
old school, baby. That's old school,'" Roenick said. "That made me
feel really good. Relived a lot of good memories."</TE>
<TE>   As nice as that play looked, it could not match the artistry of
Hull's goal, the final score of the period. As the puck bounced off
the boards and toward the crease, Hull put down his stick and flipped
a backhand shot between his legs and into the net.</TE>
<TE>   "That's just stupid," Roenick said. "That's just stupid talent, to
be able to do something like that."</TE>
<TE>   Even the German goaltender, Marc Seliger, had to give it up for
that goal.</TE>
<TE>   "That one was pretty good," Seliger said. "I was amazed and
impressed. Maybe next time I'll still look for that, but I was just,
'Wow!'"</TE>
<TE>   "Just a lucky play," Hull said.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans were penalized only twice. Germany was penalized
five times, including the two high sticks against LeClair.</TE>
<TE>   "It's part of the game," Amonte said. "That was their game plan,
try to take us out of the game. But our guys, we didn't take any
retaliatory penalties tonight. That was the difference."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Richter made 28 saves to get the shutout.</TE>

<AU>Mike Kupper</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The assignment: Get to as many Winter Olympic events as possible in
one day.</LD>
<LD>   The question: Why would anyone want to do that?</LD>
<LD>   The answer: That's something for greater minds. Ours is not to
reason why, ours is but to do--or else.</LD>
<TE>   First, let's check the schedule and see what's available. Of
course, a fully credentialed reporter has a big advantage in that
getting tickets is no concern.</TE>
<TE>   On the schedule are curling in Ogden, the men's giant slalom in
Park City, women's cross-country relay at Soldier Hollow, the men's
Nordic combined at Utah Olympic Park and Soldier Hollow, the women's
bronze- and gold-medal hockey games, one at the Peaks in Provo, the
other at the E Center south of town, and the glamour event of the
Games, the women's figure skating free program downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody can be everywhere, so we're going to have to eliminate some
of the events on our schedule. Curling offers the women's bronze- and
gold-medal matches, one at 9 a.m., the other at 2 p.m. The
complicating catch is, they're in Ogden. Scratch curling. Scratch
that women's hockey game in Provo too.</TE>
<TE>   On to the giant slalom. This is an all-day event--one run in the
morning, the other in the afternoon. Still, a day at the Winter
Olympics would be incomplete without some Alpine skiing, so let's see
if we can fit it in.</TE>
<TE>   But that will mean cutting more corners. Looking at these times,
it's obvious we aren't going to see all of anything. We'll have to
settle for bits and pieces. And expect lunch. There'll be no time for
that.</TE>
<TE>   OK, we'll start at the giant slalom and go from there.</TE>
<TE>   The journey starts where all journeys for an Olympic reporter
begin, at the Main Media Center--the Salt Palace--downtown. Once we
find bus MO481, the one to Park City Mountain Resort, we're on our
way.</TE>
<TE>   While we're riding, let's figure out the rest of the day. It takes
only a little more than a minute for each giant slalom run so we
probably can see half an hour's worth of the morning runs. Then we'll
hustle over to nearby Olympic Park for the big-hill ski-jumping
portion of the Nordic combined. Nordic combined athletes can't decide
whether they like jumping better than cross-country skiing, or vice
versa, so they do both. Today, they'll jump for a while, then take
off the wide jumping boards, put on the skinny skis, and go for a
7.5-kilometer sprint.</TE>
<TE>   We'll have to take another bus from Park City to the Olympic Park
but we have the number of that bus, thanks to Kelly Crompton of Salt
Lake Olympic Committee transportation services. It's right ... Well,
it was right here.</TE>
<TE>   The jumping starts at 10:30, so we probably can catch the last
part. Unfortunately, although it's a pleasant downhill stroll to the
ski jumps, it's a killer hike back up to the shuttle buses. Your
knees may never recover. On second thought, maybe we should skip the
jumping and just go on to Soldier Hollow. That's where they'll ski
the second part of the Nordic combined and then the women's 20k relay
and we can get there on bus No. 711. We might even get there in time
to catch the last of the jumping on TV. And maybe have time for lunch
after all.</TE>
<TE>   Well, we've seen the Nordic combined sprint, and the women are
relaying, but it's time to leave. We've got to get back to the MMC so
we can catch another bus to the E Center. The women's gold-medal
hockey game starts at 5, so we can watch the first period, then get
back on the bus and head downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Figure skating starts at 5:45, and we'll have to walk from the MMC
to the Salt Lake Ice Center--it's really the Delta Center, where the
Utah Jazz play, but they pretend it's the Salt Lake Ice Center during
the Games--and they always save the best skaters for last so we
should be able to catch the medal winners in action.</TE>
<TE>   Whew, pretty hectic day, huh? What's that you say? You reek of bus
fumes? And we blew dinner? And curling, the only thing we didn't
see--if you don't count the ski jumping--was the only thing you
wanted to see?</TE>
<TE>   C'mon, let me buy you a hot dog. You know, they're going to do
this again in four years in Turin. Bet you've never watched curling
in Italy. Then there's the giant slalom, Nordic combined, women's
hockey, figure skating....</TE>

<HD>Eldredge Says He's Retiring</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Todd Eldredge didn't win the Olympic medal he so fervently wanted. He
settled instead for one final strong performance on the world stage
before announcing Wednesday he will leave Olympic-eligible
competition.</LD>
<LD>   Eldredge, who won his sixth U.S. title last month, fell in his
Olympic short program last week but rallied to finish sixth on the
strength of an impressive free skate. That, he said, was enough for
him to give up the chance to compete at next month's world
championships at Nagano, Japan. Matt Savoie, fourth at the U.S.
nationals, will take his place.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm very happy with the performance I had in the long program
here," said Eldredge, who won the 1996 world championship and was
third at last year's world competition. "It didn't have the result I
wanted, but I want to end my career on a great performance and a
high, and there's no better place to do that than at the Olympics in
the U.S.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm looking forward to letting some of the new guys get in [to
the world championships] and have some of the successes I've had over
the years."</TE>
<TE>   Eldredge, 30, said he will compete in pro-ams and perform in
skating shows. He will also participate in skating seminars, hoping
to bring youngsters into the sport.</TE>
<TE>   "My Olympic career has somewhat paralleled my entire career in
that it had its high points and low points," said Eldredge, who was
10th at the 1992 Albertville Games and fourth at Nagano four years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   "In '92 I was kind of the new kid.... For me to stick around and
finish with a great long program is the culmination of all the
efforts I've put into the Olympics."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jamie Sale and David Pelletier, raised to co-gold medalist status
with Russians Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze after
improprieties were found in the judging of the pairs event, have
agreed to participate in an ice show March 12 and are mulling other
offers.</TE>
<TE>   Their agent, Craig Fenech, said Wednesday the pair will perform in
a show called, "Jamie and David and Friends," at Skyreach Centre in
Edmonton, Canada.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the cast has not been determined.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Federal agents have seized tons of fake Olympic pins--even
copycats of their own official pins--and confiscated enough clothing
to stock an Olympic superstore with everything from baseball caps to
$1,000 leather pants.</TE>
<TE>   "We're making a significant dent in the Olympic trafficking," U.S.
Customs Service Agent Donald Daufenbach said.</TE>
<TE>   Selling counterfeit Olympic goods is a federal crime punishable by
up to $2 million in fines and 10 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Belarussian ski jumper Andrej Lyskovec apparently enjoyed his
visit to the United States so much he didn't want to go home to Minsk
right away.</TE>
<TE>   Lyskovec was last seen by teammates Sunday, sending officials
scurrying Monday when he didn't show up for their flight home.</TE>
<TE>   His wife finally solved the mystery. Police spoke to her Tuesday,
and she said her husband had called to tell her he was remaining in
the U.S. for a few months.</TE>

<KH>Mike Penner THE DAY IN SALT LAKE</KH>
<HD>A Shot Heard 'Round the Rink</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The best thing you can say about Tommy Salo taking one on the head
and losing the puck in the lights (or the stars that were flashing in
front of his eyes right about then) for the decisive goal in Sweden's
stunning hockey loss to Belarus is:</LD>
<LD>   Good thing it wasn't curling.</LD>
<LD>   That one had to hurt. Vulcanized rubber, fired at your skull from
70 feet, with a berth in the Olympic semifinals on the line. The
skull is connected to the skeleton, which is also the name of an
insane new Olympic sport in which competitors luge head-first in an
attempt to break records or cervical bones (whichever comes first)
but rarely approaches the levels of pain foisted upon Salo Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   Say it ain't so, Tommy Salo. The shootout shot-stopping hero of
Sweden's gold-medal run in 1994 couldn't stop a Belarussian slapshot
launched from beyond the blue line with 2:24 left in a 3-3 game. All
of Sweden agonized as the puck hit Salo in the mask, then bounced
over his head, then slalomed down his back and trickled over the goal
line for the most mind-boggling Olympic goal since Mike Eruzione's
against the Soviet Union 22 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Belarus 4, Sweden 3.</TE>
<TE>   Belarus, 0-3 in group play after being outscored, 22-6, by Russia,
Finland and the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Belarus, with an injury-ravaged roster filled with a bunch of guys
who play for the Severstal Cherepovets, Khimik Voskresensk and
Metallurg Novokuznetsk--but only one who plays in the NHL.</TE>
<TE>   Belarus, overcoming so many staggering obstacles, including the
Curse of the Mighty Duck, which previously held that any country with
one or more current Mighty Ducks on its roster was doomed in this
Olympic hockey tournament. The only NHL player of Belarus' 25-man
roster? Ruslan Salei, defenseman, Anaheim Mighty Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   How is this possible?</TE>
<TE>   Swedish captain Mats Sundin had no clue.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't understand how we could lose against this team," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Belarus goalie Andrei Mezin, who never made it out of the U.S.
minors but managed to stop 44 shots Wednesday, had a novel
suggestion:</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes even a gun without bullets shoots."</TE>
<TE>   If that isn't the greatest quote yet uttered at these Salt Lake
City Games, it's certainly a money-saving idea biathlon might want to
consider.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes even a gun without bullets shoots. And sometimes a
German hockey player trying to rally his team to an upset of
Belarussian proportions shoots off his mouth and shoots himself in
the foot.</TE>
<TE>   "We will win," Andreas Loth guaranteed before he and his German
teammates stepped onto the E Center ice against Team USA.</TE>
<TE>   USA 5, Germany 0 read the scoreboard after the Germans stepped off
the E Center ice.</TE>
<TE>   Take a seat, Broadway Andreas.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, silence really can be golden. Take the case of the U.S.
skeleton crew. They came to Utah to exhume an old Olympic daredevil
event that was tried twice previously, in 1928 and 1948, and twice
shelved, presumably for safety reasons. This meant they would have to
meet the press, publicize their sport, get the word out, try to
explain just what in the world they must be thinking.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, on the eve of skeleton's bone-chilling return to the
Winter Games, the American men clammed up. Sorry, we need to
concentrate on our craft, we need to concentrate on our rafts, we're
not talking. Amazing. A skeleton media blackout. Who do they think
they are, major league baseball players?</TE>
<TE>   Often, it's the other way around with skeleton, the first Olympic
sport to be named for the equipment it most often breaks. Often,
skeleton competitors have nothing to say to the media after they
race, their broken jaws having been wired shut so they can mend.</TE>
<TE>   But Jim Shea Jr. came through in grand fashion for the Americans,
sledding his way past the Austrians and the Swiss for the men's
skeleton gold and stepping to the top of the medals podium 70 years
after his grandfather Jack Shea, a double gold medalist in
speedskating, had. Tristan Gale won the women's competition, giving
the United States a skeleton sweep.</TE>
<TE>   Then, at last, Shea decided he had something to say, which said a
lot about the sport of skeleton.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about his state of mind before the race, Shea said, "I sort
of wanted to rip someone's head off, but I needed to calm down and
relax."</TE>
<TE>   Asked to describe the thrill, for immediate lack of a better word,
of skeleton, Shea said, "If bobsleigh is the champagne of thrills,
then skeleton is the moonshine of thrills."</TE>
<TE>   And short-track speedskating is the 3.2% beer of thrills. Looks
enticing, looks exciting, but, more times than not, leaves you
feeling vaguely unsatisfied.</TE>
<TE>   Chart U.S. short-tracker Apolo Anton Ohno's Olympics so far.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday in the men's 1,000-meter final, Ohno makes his move
during the last lap, he and three other racers wipe out 50 yards from
the finish, allowing the last and only man standing, Australia's
Steven Bradbury, to glide home for the gold.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday in the men's 1,500 final, Ohno makes his move down the
stretch, Korea's Kim Dong-Sung blocks the passing lane, Ohno
theatrically pulls back and holds both hands up--Infraction alert!
Infraction alert!--and crosses the finish behind Kim, who is promptly
disqualified.</TE>
<TE>   Gold medal to Ohno, who, despite six stitches in his left leg,
despite crossing the finish line second, apparently cannot be
stopped.</TE>
<TE>   "We should use a rifle on Ohno," fourth-place finisher Fabio Carta
of Italy quipped.</TE>
<TE>   Or just sic the Belarussians on him. Sometimes even a gun without
bullets shoots.</TE>

<HD>ISU Denies Ice Dancing Protest</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The International Skating Union on Wednesday rejected a protest filed
by Margarita Drobiazko and Povilas Vanagas of Lithuania over what
they felt was unfair judging in the free dance portion of the ice
dancing competition.</LD>
<LD>   The couple contended judges didn't follow the rules in scoring the
performances of the third-place Italian duo and the fourth-place
Canadian duo. Both of them fell but still finished ahead of the
Lithuanians, who were fifth.</LD>
<LD>   "It was just a terse statement saying, 'The judging was fair.
Period,'" said John Domanskis, a Newport Beach plastic surgeon who is
the Lithuanian Olympic team's attache. "At this time we have no plan
of pursuing it. We hope it will lead to some reforms. The athletes
are disappointed, but this is as far as we can take it .... We just
wanted to show the inadequacies of the system."</LD>
<TE>   The ISU is still investigating improprieties in the judging of the
pairs event, after which a French judge said she was pressured to
vote against her conscience. The Russian duo of Elena Berezhnaya and
Anton Sikharulidze were declared winners, but Canadians Jamie Sale
and David Pelletier were later awarded gold medals.</TE>
<TE>   The judge, Marie Reine Le Gougne, was suspended indefinitely by
the ISU, which announced a proposed overhaul of the scoring and
judging systems.</TE>

<HD>Kostelic Stands Out</HD>
<DH>The Croatian wins the women's slalom, taking her third
medal of the Games. U.S. skiers continue to struggle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DEER VALLEY, Utah</DL>
<LD>The women's slalom was raced Wednesday in white-out conditions for
the winners and the usual wipeout conditions for the Americans.</LD>
<LD>   These Olympics are beginning to have a familiar sting to them.</LD>
<LD>   Croatia's Janica Kostelic continues to stand tall through finish
lines while American women fall down.</LD>
<TE>   Racing in near blizzard conditions that hindered visibility,
Kostelic managed her usual 20-20 vision run and took another step
toward Olympic Alpine history in winning the slalom with a two-run
time of 1 minute 46.10 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Laure Pequegnot of France, the world's top-ranked slalom skier,
finished 0.07 of a second back to claim the silver, while Sweden's
Anja Paerson won the bronze with a time of 1:47.09.</TE>
<TE>   Kostelic became only the fifth female Alpine skier to win three
medals in the same Olympics, joining two Germans, Rosi Mittermaier
(1976) and Katja Seizinger (1998), Hanni Wenzel of Liechtenstein
(1980) and Switzerland's Vreni Schneider (1994).</TE>
<TE>   Kostelic already had won a gold medal in the combined and a silver
in the super-giant slalom. She has a chance to win a record fourth
medal in Friday's giant slalom at Park City.</TE>
<TE>   Kostelic, only 20, said she skied two bad runs in bad conditions
but "found the best way down today."</TE>
<TE>   She said she does not feel pressure to win a fourth medal.</TE>
<TE>   "If it doesn't happen, it doesn't matter," she said. "I still have
two Olympics ahead of me."</TE>
<TE>   On the subject of scary thoughts, it was another horror-flick day
for "Scream USA."</TE>
<TE>   Kristina Koznick, the world's No. 2 slalom skier, skied off course
only five gates from the finish in her morning run, failing to make
the transition from a left turn to a right.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, I didn't keep my body with my skis," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Medal hopeful Sarah Schleper went out a bit farther up the front
face when a boot came out of her binding.</TE>
<TE>   "It popped right off," Schleper said. "I was still standing up
when I passed the next gate, and I was like, 'I don't think my ski's
there anymore.'"</TE>
<TE>   Schleper felt slightly better knowing her mistake was not "pilot
error." No, this was an equipment failure, like a race car blowing a
gasket at the Indianapolis 500.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. women's Alpine team has become a daily sob story, a
downhill trail of tears.</TE>
<TE>   Three of America's four entries in the slalom failed to complete
their first run.</TE>
<TE>   Lindsey Kildow, the 17-year-old who placed sixth in last week's
combined, finished 32nd, a snail's-crawl 14.63 seconds off Kostelic's
pace.</TE>
<TE>   Koznick choked on her words as she tried to convey her
disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   "My coach said I'd be crying either way," Koznick said. "He said,
'You'd be crying either way, if it's good or bad.' Unfortunately,
these weren't the tears I wanted."</TE>
<TE>   Koznick was consoled in the finish corral by Dan Stripp, her coach
and boyfriend.</TE>
<TE>   For several minutes, Stripp faced Koznick, his hands on her
shoulders, his eyes locked on hers. A few times Stripp used his glove
to wipe tears from her cheek.</TE>
<TE>   Only an ambulance chaser could enjoy these tales of heartbreak:
bright, smart, talented young women, who have devoted their lives for
their Olympic moments, suddenly falling down as if someone planted
tripwires in the slopes.</TE>
<TE>   It started last week with Caroline Lalive, who crashed in the
downhill, withdrew from the combined after missing a gate on the
first slalom run and finishing 17.85 seconds out of first, and
crashed again in the super-G.</TE>
<TE>   Lalive was so crushed after the super-G she stayed up on the
course, afraid to come down, like a kitten stuck in a tree.</TE>
<TE>   But Koznick?</TE>
<TE>   She was as much of a sure shot as America had in these Games.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, she bombed out in slalom at the 1998 Nagano Games after being
touted as a contender, but Koznick seemed beyond that failure.</TE>
<TE>   She is 26 now, at the top of her game. Did you know Koznick had
finished every slalom she raced this year until Wednesday?</TE>
<TE>   The native of Burnsville, Minn., broke away from the U.S. team two
years ago, and the split seemed to have done her good.</TE>
<TE>   Koznick complained about the almost white-out conditions and how
the warm snow was hardly ideal for skiers.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened is the snow didn't freeze," she said, "and there
were holes and it's so rough that even the best in the world, they
almost look like juniors coming down. It's frustrating, because we
all like to ski on ice."</TE>
<TE>   Yet the conditions were the same for everyone, and Koznick, as one
of the top-ranked racers, got to select a low start number, bib No.3.</TE>
<TE>   Truth is, Koznick got her shot on the hill before it really
deteriorated and, in the end, the best racers ended up on the podium.</TE>
<TE>   Kostelic is the defending World Cup champion in slalom; Pequegnot
and Paerson rank first and third in the current World Cup standings,
forming a ranking sandwich around No. 2 Koznick.</TE>
<TE>   "It was rough, I was fighting it the whole way down," Koznick
said. "I didn't ever feel like, 'Yeah, this is great.' It was like,
'Oh my God, it feels like I'm on a bull.'"</TE>
<TE>   It's almost as if the American women's failures in Salt Lake have
become contagious.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Marolt, president of the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Assn., issued
a quote about being "very disappointed" with the results but said he
doesn't buy into the domino theory.</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't," Marolt said. "I think it's different conditions,
different courses. I think Kristina was actually skiing very well.
Sarah was a binding."</TE>
<TE>   What next, bad room-service food? Unless the women score a
shocking surprise in Friday's giant slalom, they will be held without
a medal for the first time since the 1988 Calgary Games.</TE>
<TE>   It's not only a time to stop the bleeding, it's time to stop the
crying.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KEARNS, Utah</DL>
<LD>The Olympics finally got to see highly touted German speedskater Anni
Friesinger at her best Wednesday, and Jennifer Rodriguez kept the
American medals train chugging along.</LD>
<LD>   Friesinger, after finishing out of the medals in the women's 3,000
and 1,000, was untouchable in her specialty, winning the 1,500 meters
in world-record time, 1 minute 54.02 seconds, .36 of a second faster
than she had skated the distance last March at the Olympic rink in
Calgary.</LD>
<LD>   Teammate Sabine Voelker paid her third visit to the podium,
matching her second-place finish in the 1,000 and bettering her third
in the 500. Rodriguez's visit to the medal stand was a return
engagement too. She also had been third in the 1,000.</LD>
<TE>   Rodriguez's bronze gave the American long-track team eight
medals--one more than traditional power Germany--in as many races,
tying the U.S. record set in 1980 at Lake Placid.</TE>
<TE>   "But five of those were Eric Heiden's," Rodriguez pointed out of
the Lake Placid haul. "This is a little different. We've just been
rolling down the races and it's very exciting."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed it is different, six skaters having provided the bounty
this time around.</TE>
<TE>   This, however, may be where it all ends for the American
long-trackers. Remaining are the distance events, the men's 10,000
Friday and the women's 5,000 Saturday. No American has won a medal in
the men's long race since Heiden's gold in 1980, and the closest the
U.S. ever got to one in the women's 5,000 was a seventh-place finish
by Kirstin Holum four years ago in Nagano. The distance races
traditionally belong to the Dutch men and the German women.</TE>
<TE>   For the longest time Wednesday, though, it looked as if the
Americans might sneak through with more than the bronze.</TE>
<TE>   Skating in the last pair of the slower first set, Chris Witty,
surprise winner of Sunday's 1,000, surprised again, this time with an
Olympic-record run of 1:55.71, which moved her into the lead.</TE>
<TE>   And there she stayed until Friesinger, who is unbeaten in the
1,500 in World Cup racing this season, emphatically bumped her to
second.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have won all the other races, for sure, you have to hope
you don't lose the most important one," Friesinger said. "I knew that
I was capable of winning a medal in each of these events, but my 3K
did not begin so well and I missed the podium [with a fourth-place
finish]. The 1,000, I also missed the podium [finishing fifth].</TE>
<TE>   "I saw yesterday with the boys [the men skated their 1,500
Tuesday] that you have to open fast but at half power.... Then at the
end, I just broke out."</TE>
<TE>   Voelker skated two pairs after Friesinger and bumped Witty to
third, then along came Rodriguez and Canada's Cindy Klassen in the
last pair, both with better times.</TE>
<TE>   "The 1,000 meters was very painful, but this race is the most pain
I've ever had," said Witty, who learned she had mononucleosis a month
before the Games began. "I had to go sit for a while. I couldn't see
straight. My head was pounding."</TE>
<TE>   For Rodriguez, who was at least slightly disappointed with her
bronze in the 1,000, having slipped in the first turn, this one was
well received.</TE>
<TE>   "Going into my race, I knew I had to have a good opener and a good
700 [meters] without using too much energy. I might have hesitated or
slacked off a little bit too much on the second lap, but I don't
care. I got a medal.... I've got two medals and I'm done."</TE>
<TE>   Amy Sannes (eighth) and Becky Sundstrom (13th) also skated for the
U.S.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A brief episode after Belarus' shocking victory over Sweden in the
men's hockey quarterfinals showed how tricky translations can be.</LD>
<LD>   Belarus Coach Vladimir Krikunov was asked to compare his team's
4-3 victory to the United States hockey team's "Miracle on Ice."</LD>
<LD>   "In 1980, I was watching on TV when the U.S. beat the Soviet
Union," the interpreter quoted Krikunov as saying. "But I lost a
bottle of cognac today because I thought this would be our last
game."</LD>
<TE>   That set off a minor stir. Had the coach actually bet against his
own team? After further questioning after the end of the official
news conference, the interpreter made a clarification. It turns out
he had made a bet with a United States NHL agent that the Americans'
victory over the Soviets in 1980 was for the gold medal. In reality
that game was a semifinal, and the U.S. beat Finland for the gold.</TE>
<TE>   So the translator should have said something like "I lost a bottle
of cognac because I thought that was their last game."</TE>
<TE>   It's a Good Thing She Didn't Feel any Better</TE>
<TE>   Janica Kostelic, the Croatian sensation, has won three Alpine
skiing medals in the Salt Lake Games, but you wonder how she can even
get from the couch to the kitchen the way she talks.</TE>
<TE>   Kostelic, 20, has had three operations on her left knee since last
spring and said the injury still bothers her.</TE>
<TE>   After she won the women's combined event, Kostelic said the only
parts of her body that didn't hurt were her right arm and her hair.</TE>
<TE>   After she won Wednesday's slalom, Kostelic was asked again about
her aching knee.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a big thing," she said. "I can still walk. I can walk on
my hands too, so that helps."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes You Win, Some Things You Lose</TE>
<TE>   Anita Corbett's job is to give stuff away, and she has lots of
inventory: More than 5,000 items, increasing by an average of about
750 per day.</TE>
<TE>   The only catch is, you must prove it belongs to you.</TE>
<TE>   Corbett is the Salt Lake Organizing Committee's manager of
spectator lost and found.</TE>
<TE>   Surgical scissors, ice tongs, and a framed oil painting are among
the items that have been turned in.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a database and log in the items with the venue name and
date," Corbett said. "That way we can do a quick search and try and
find your item."</TE>
<TE>   About 15% of the lost items are returned.</TE>
<TE>   "We sit here and hear beepers and cell phones going off," Corbett
said. "We try to find the phone or pager and answer them before they
hang up.</TE>
<TE>   "Gloves. Tons of gloves. Almost all of the gloves are adult size.
We get very few children's sizes.</TE>
<TE>   "Car keys, hotel room keys, driver's licenses, credit cards. I
have people's lives here."</TE>
<TE>   Behind Every Successful Woman ...</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Rodriguez, a former inline skater from Miami, credited
speedskating fiance K.C. Boutiette, a former inline skater from
Tacoma, Wash., with helping her win bronze medals, her first Olympic
medals, in the women's 1,000 and Wednesday's 1,500.</TE>
<TE>   "K.C.'s been nothing but absolutely terrific," she said. "Since
his race was over [he finished fifth in the men's 5,000 Feb. 9] he's
done everything for me.</TE>
<TE>   "He's pulled me around on the ice after my fast laps, he's
sharpened my skates, he's yelled at people who wanted me to go here
and there--he's like, 'No, she has to focus on her races.' He's been
the backbone. He's been there for absolutely everything."</TE>
<TE>   Because the couple has a spring wedding planned, and his own
skating was out of the way, Boutiette figured that was the least he
could do.</TE>
<TE>   "You learn from other skaters that you have to be focused and
ready for races," he said. "I didn't want her doing lots of
interviews or other stuff. If she would have done all that stuff,
then maybe she wouldn't be here today [with two medals."</TE>
<TE>   It's the Case of the Minsking Person</TE>
<TE>   Andrej Lyskovec, a ski jumper from Belarus, apparently enjoyed his
visit to the United States so much he didn't want to go home to Minsk
right away.</TE>
<TE>   Problem was, he didn't tell his delegation he was staying.</TE>
<TE>   Lyskovec was last seen by teammates Sunday, sending officials
scurrying Monday when he didn't show up to meet his coach for their
flight home.</TE>
<TE>   The team reported him missing to the FBI and local police.</TE>
<TE>   "We found that he was not in the village three or four hours
before the departure," delegation administrator Natalia Kotlyarova
said. "Then we were waiting for him at the airport, hoping he'd come.
We called his wife, but she also had no idea."</TE>
<TE>   His wife finally solved the mystery. Police spoke to her Tuesday
and she said her husband had called to tell her he was remaining in
the United States for a few months.</TE>
<TE>   Lyskovec was 42nd in the 90-meter individual jumps on Feb. 10 and
failed to qualify in the 120-meter two days later.</TE>
<TE>   New Event: Medal Jump</TE>
<TE>   The United States has won 26 medals, twice its previous Winter
Games record, and could set yet another mark--the biggest jump in
medals from one Winter Olympics to another.</TE>
<TE>   Norway holds that record with a 15-medal jump from five medals in
Calgary in 1988 to 20 in Albertville, France.</TE>

<LD>It was such a glorious day outside, Dr. Tenley Albright just had to
grab her skates.</LD>
<LD>   Albright, who in 1956 became the first American woman to win an
Olympic gold medal in figure skating, was recalling that day last
year when she was gliding across the ice on Boston's Frog Pond and
fell and broke her wrist.</LD>
<LD>   "That ridiculous thing," Albright said from her office at Harvard
Medical School. "It was a beautiful day and I was skating for about
10 minutes. I had no edge on my skates and was being really careful.
But I looked up at the sky while I was swinging my leg out and I
fell. I had never broken anything before."</LD>
<TE>   Albright, who was born July 19, 1935, in Newton Center, Mass.,
never let physical setbacks slow her down.</TE>
<TE>   She began taking lessons at the Skating Club of Boston when she
was 9, but was stricken a few years later with non-paralytic polio,
an illness that prevented her from participating in physical activity
for several months. Albright eventually returned to skating, in part
to strengthen back muscles that had been weakened while she was
hospitalized.</TE>
<TE>   Albright won the 1952 U.S. women's championships at age 16--the
first of five consecutive U.S. women's singles titles. She earned the
silver medal at the 1952 Winter Games in Oslo, and in 1953 became the
first American woman to win the world championship.</TE>
<TE>   Determined to become a surgeon like her father, Albright entered
Radcliffe College a few months after winning her world title and
juggled schoolwork with 4 a.m. practice sessions. She won the 1955
world championship and was the favorite entering the 1956 Winter
Games at Cortina, Italy. But less than two weeks before the
competition, she fell after hitting a rut in the ice during practice.
The blade of her left skate slashed a vein and scraped a bone in her
right ankle. Her father was summoned to Italy to attend to the
injury.</TE>
<TE>   Albright could not practice until the day before the start of
competition. Nevertheless, she went on to become the first American
woman to win a figure skating gold medal. After finishing second to
American Carol Heiss in the 1956 World Championships, Albright
returned to school. She graduated in three years from Radcliffe,
entered Harvard Medical School as one of only six women in a class of
130 and went on to become a surgeon specializing in sports injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Before she was inducted into the New England Women's Sports Hall
of Fame in 1998, Albright said her skating experiences prepared her
for work as a surgeon.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was competing, we were outdoors," Albright said at the
time. "So despite all my preparation, I never knew whether I would be
skating in a snowstorm or whether it would be raining or windy. I've
learned to expect the unexpected. You don't always know what you'll
find when you open a patient, and you have to be prepared."</TE>
<TE>   Albright, who in 1979 became the first woman to serve as an
officer on the U.S. Olympic Committee, spent 23 years in private
practice. Today, she said she is working at Harvard and the Whitehead
Institute at MIT on "a whole new revolution going on in the genome
area."</TE>
<TE>   Albright said she is also excited about the Boston Ice Theater, a
skating project started by one of her three daughters.</TE>
<TE>   "Spreading the joy of skating is fun for me," she said.</TE>

<LD>   "Don't you know, they're talkin' 'bout a revolution. It sounds
like a whisper."</LD>
<TE>   Tracy Chapman</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If we're talking about a revolution in figure skating judging,
then let's talk about a real one. I must say I was initially very
excited about Ottavio Cinquanta's reform proposal, but I wonder if it
goes far enough. I realize that we are talking about preliminary
ideas, but the core philosophy of skating judging is being questioned
here, and if we are truly ready for a fundamental restructuring--and
by the looks of this past week we'd better be--let's get it right.</TE>
<TE>   I want to say up front that 99% of the figure skating judges I've
known are simply trying to do their best within a system. My father
has been a judge for more than 30 years, and he does it out of sheer
altruism, to give back to the sport and to encourage children who are
coming up in the ranks.</TE>
<TE>   It's difficult to be a judge, and it takes years to reach the
level of an Olympic judge. The work is volunteer, and it takes an
incredible amount of time, energy and even money to reach the Olympic
level. Having said that, I have a few comments on the proposal and
recent actions to investigate the judging issues here:</TE>
<TE>   * Does it matter if we have nine or 14 judges, and what about
computer selection? I think the idea of having 14 judges with seven
randomly selected by computer to eliminate bloc judging works on one
level, but it fails on several others. It does eliminate the
possibility of predicting precisely who the judges are and therefore
finding one corrupt judge to pay off or make a deal with.</TE>
<TE>   But if the federations want to fix the judging, there are four
more judges to work on. Also, how much less transparent will the
sport be when there is no flag beside the judge's score? It was the
booing that caused the French judge to want to confess. The judges
need to be accountable to those watching, including the skaters and
coaches, in real time.</TE>
<TE>   * What about tracking the scores of judges to watch for trends?
This is the only way to get a clear picture of a judge's ability
against an objective standard, and to detect incidences of bias. I
applaud statistical tracking of judges' scoring, as long as
representatives of the sport's key stakeholders can analyze the data
and, together with officials from the International Skating Union,
make decisions based on that information on a regular basis.</TE>
<TE>   * I challenge the ISU to go after judges and federations who are
making the deals, and remove the perpetrators. They are stealing
deserved medals from athletes, plain and simple. If the clock that
was timing the speedskaters was broken and giving the wrong result,
it would be thrown out instantly, and so should corrupt judges.</TE>
<TE>   The ISU needs to follow through on its investigations of alleged
vote fixing in the pairs and dance events in Salt Lake City and
remove and punish those involved in any fixing. They took the Olympic
oath as did the athletes, and they should be expelled from the sport
for a few years to think about their responsibility to the careers of
the young athletes whose future livelihoods depend on the results of
these competitions.</TE>
<TE>   Never underestimate the powerful role played by the skating
federations in selecting the judges, and their desire to keep their
jobs. In many cases, they have worked for 30 or more years to reach
their rank, and they do not want to leave their positions of
authority. Many enjoy the power, but most are motivated by the love
of skating.</TE>
<TE>   * The ISU should take the countries out of the judging mix
altogether. In order to truly reform the world of skating judging,
the ISU must take the federations out of their powerful role and
select judges who know no country's affiliation, and who are ready to
have their judging monitored to assure they reach a fair result every
time. They need to be accountable only to the ISU and to key
stakeholders in the sport, including their peer judges--the skaters
and coaches--just as linesmen and referees are in the NFL, NHL, NBA
and major league baseball.</TE>
<TE>   * The ISU should consult the athletes and coaches, as John Nicks,
Sasha Cohen's coach, has suggested. These are the key stakeholders in
the sport, whose careers and livelihoods are determined by the
outcomes of ISU events. Skating is a profession, and the only
credentials that are bankable are the Olympics and the World
Championships. Just as football, basketball, baseball, hockey and
tennis all have professional judges judging professional events, so
should skating.</TE>
<TE>   * Begin rewarding the best judging, not just based on agreement.
In skating, judges are rewarded for their agreement with colleagues,
not for making great decisions when the circumstances are tough. The
corollary to this is that judges are fearful of the negative role
that disagreement can play in their careers. This is why they often
go in with a predetermined placement, because they know their peers
will make the same decision, and they will live to see another year
of travel and good treatment. Also, when judges agree with their
peers, they are protected from having to defend their positions in
brutal judging meetings.</TE>
<TE>   * The ISU needs to make sure that the basics of sport are not lost
as we add up scores for triples and quad jumps. Adding up all the
jumps and other elements is an impressive way to change the system,
but the ISU needs to include skating techniques in the difficulty and
execution marks, including some measure of speed across the ice,
basic techniques of stroking, spinning, carriage and form. These
elements may seem insignificant, but the sport will be lost if it
becomes even more strictly about adding up all the tricks.</TE>
<TE>   I welcome the revolution, but let's make sure to get it right.</TE>

<HD>Anger at Hahn Brings Unusual Allies Together</HD>
<DH>Politics: Blacks and white harbor activists talk about
forging a coalition. They feel the mayor reneged on campaign
promises.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sharing a mutual anger with Los Angeles City Hall, African American
leaders in central Los Angeles and white activists in the harbor area
Wednesday were confirming plans to join forces at future rallies
targeting Mayor James K. Hahn.</LD>
<LD>   At first glance, their concerns could not seem farther apart.</LD>
<LD>   African Americans are angry about Hahn's failure to support Los
Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks for a second term. The
activists in San Pedro and Wilmington believe that Hahn has broken
campaign promises to counter port projects that threaten their
quality of life.</LD>
<TE>   Both feel betrayed by Hahn, who grew up in South-Central and won
office in July with strong backing from African Americans and
residents in his current hometown of San Pedro.</TE>
<TE>   "During the mayoral campaigns, Hahn was the only candidate who
openly promised to support the police chief--but he didn't," said the
Rev. Leonard Jackson of First AME Church in the West Adams District.
"This is not a black-or-white issue."</TE>
<TE>   "Jim Hahn promised us a lot of things he hasn't done," said Noel
Park, president of the San Pedro and Peninsula Homeowners Assn. "I'm
not a great fan of Chief Parks, but we'll go past that to support our
friends."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn angrily dismissed talks between the two groups as
"opportunism at its worst" and "no more coalition-building than
flying to the moon. They aren't supporting each other's concerns.
It's just folks exploiting their disagreements with me and promoting
their secessionist interests."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said "no candidate for office in recent memory has done more
for keeping promises than I have. I said I would appoint a majority
of locals to the Harbor Commission. Did that. Form a community
advisory committee. Did it. Pursue no net increases in air emissions.
Did it."</TE>
<TE>   As for Parks, he said, "At the end of the day, I'll be held
accountable on whether or not this Police Department moved forward on
issues such as reforms, not the chief."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn did not oppose Parks during the campaign but did not endorse
his reappointment either.</TE>
<TE>   The first test of the unusual alliance may come next week. African
American leaders have invited port activists to join them at a
political rally Tuesday at Parker Center.</TE>
<TE>   The activists, many involved in the harbor-area secession
movement, have invited African Americans to stand with them March 8
at a rally protesting a terminal expansion project. That rally is
expected to be held at Knoll Hill, less than a mile from Hahn's San
Pedro home.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, harbor-area activists traveled to South-Central Los
Angeles to meet with African American leaders, including the Rev.
Norman Johnson, executive director of the Los Angeles chapter of the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference.</TE>
<TE>   "We are coming together and sharing concerns about the future of
our city," Johnson said. "I only hope we are at the beginning of a
very meaningful conversation rather than the end of a process that
fragments and isolates us."</TE>
<TE>   Whether the two constituencies form a true coalition remains to be
seen. But the groups' initial talks were quickly taking on
secessionist overtones, which, according to polls, have never been
popular in South-Central Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Richard Close, chairman of Valley VOTE, which advocates
cityhood for the San Fernando Valley, has been lobbying African
American leaders, including Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), with
a message: "Let's talk. We have a lot in common."</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Mardesich of the Harbor Study Foundation agreed, and added
that "African Americans will conclude on their own that secession is
an advantage for them."</TE>
<TE>   "With redistricting after secession," Mardesich said, "the 15th
City Council District will have its first black councilperson ever."</TE>
<TE>   That seat is now held by Councilwoman Janice Hahn, Mayor Hahn's
sister, who recently backed homeowners calling for a thorough
environmental review of the ongoing expansion of China Shipping Co.'s
terminal in San Pedro.</TE>
<TE>   A week ago, Mayor Hahn's new Port Community Advisory Committee
voted 18 to 3 in favor of having the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
conduct that review. The Harbor Commission, however, dismissed that
recommendation. Harbor Commission President Nicholas Tonsich said the
period for public comment on the project had ended before last week's
meeting. Beyond that, he said, "The commission is not turning a deaf
ear to the community.</TE>
<TE>   "The environmentalists on the committee want the project stopped
until the analysis is completed," he said. "But we see no reason why
we can't proceed on a dual track."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who had supported Hahn's opponent
for mayor, Antonio Villaraigosa, described the discussions between
the groups as "a very, very interesting political phenomenon.</TE>
<TE>   "What was a coalition of convenience, a loose-knit electorate, is
essentially finding common ground in being disappointed with the very
person who they thought was going to be the glue that held them
together."</TE>
<TE>   Waters put it another way.</TE>
<TE>   "I've not seen this kind of coalition-building in all my political
life," said Waters, who has supported Hahn but backs Parks. "Hahn may
have done more good for us all by triggering our mutual concerns than
we've been able to do all these years."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn disagreed. "There's no evidence of broken promises or
communities being betrayed," he said. "Just of malcontents promoting
their own agendas."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An election mailer sent to thousands of Ventura County households
this week erroneously claims that district attorney candidate Ron
Bamieh has been a judge for 12 years and an attorney for 21 years.</LD>
<LD>   Bamieh, a 36-year-old prosecutor who received his law degree in
1991 and was never a judge, said the vendor who produced the slate
card, which lists candidates endorsed by a taxpayer-advocate group,
made a mistake.</LD>
<LD>   But opponent Greg Totten questioned whether Bamieh was
intentionally trying to deceive voters and suggested he may seek a
court injunction to stop distribution of additional mailers.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a lie; this is untrue," said Totten, who has repeatedly
accused his rival of exaggerating his qualifications. "This is just
the latest example of a campaign that is trying to mislead the
public."</TE>
<TE>   The slate card controversy is the most recent in a race that is
growing nastier by the day.</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh and Totten, the 47-year-old second-in-command of the
district attorney's office, are vying to replace retiring Dist. Atty.
Michael D. Bradbury. The election is March 5.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Totten called a news conference to bring attention
to a Spanish-language television advertisement run by his opponent
that features a four-second spot by a 72-year-old Santa Paula man.</TE>
<TE>   Totten told reporters that he discovered that the man, Raul
Cervantes, had been convicted of selling cocaine more than a decade
ago when a tipster called his campaign office.</TE>
<TE>   After checking Los Angeles County court records, Totten said, he
learned that Cervantes, one of four campaign supporters featured in
Bamieh's TV spot, pleaded no contest to selling cocaine in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Cervantes is identified in the ad as a Food Share volunteer and
tells viewers: "With Ron Bamieh, the county will be a better place to
live, work and care for our families."</TE>
<TE>   Totten suggested that Bamieh has such weak community support that
he either didn't know or didn't care that one of his supporters was
caught with 11 ounces of cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   "This is unfortunately yet another example in my opponent's quest
for power that he has lost his moral compass," Totten said, standing
beside Bradbury, Sheriff Bob Brooks and several local police chiefs.</TE>
<TE>   Totten and Bradbury called the use of a drug seller in an ad
promoting a district attorney candidate "reprehensible."</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh said he had never met Cervantes and didn't know he had a
criminal record.</TE>
<TE>   But he lashed out at his opponent for dragging an elderly campaign
volunteer into a mudslinging grudge match.</TE>
<TE>   "The shocking story is not Mr. Cervantes, but that Greg Totten
would do background checks on people supporting my campaign," Bamieh
said. "This man was emotionally distraught when I talked to him
today. Mr. Totten is willing to destroy anyone to catch up in a race
he is losing."</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh said Cervantes served less than a year in jail for the drug
offense and has since been honored by various civic organizations for
his work in the community.</TE>
<TE>   "The person who should concern himself with his moral compass is
Mr. Totten," Bamieh said.</TE>
<TE>   As for the slate mailer, which cost the Bamieh campaign $10,000,
the vendor has corrected the mistake and apologized, the candidate
said.</TE>
<TE>   The card was put out by the Irvine-based Save Prop. 13 Committee
and endorses candidates in several races.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the committee issued a news release stating: "Due to
a production error of our vendor ... one line of text from another
candidate was accidentally added on to Mr. Bamieh's text."</TE>
<TE>   The release states that the error has been corrected in future
mailings.</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh said he had proofread the ad and that the mistake was made
after he signed off on it. He added that it should be obvious that
the reference to him being a judge was a typo.</TE>
<TE>   "To actually think that I would put that on this slate card,"
Bamieh said, his voice trailing off. "You would have to be a complete
fool."</TE>

<HD>Larger Budget Shortfall Predicted</HD>
<DH>Finances: Governor's projected deficit of $12.5 billion is
$5 billion short, analysis says. He calls report too pessimistic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Lawmakers will need to come up with an additional $5 billion to
balance the state budget as the recession and weakening stock market
take a heavier toll on California coffers than previously
anticipated, Legislative Analyst Elizabeth Hill warned Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Hill predicted that Gov. Gray Davis' $97.9-billion spending plan
for the next fiscal year--which contains a road map for closing a
$12.5-billion shortfall--would still leave the state's bank account
$5 billion out of whack.</LD>
<LD>   So far, Davis and lawmakers have solved nearly $3 billion of the
now-$17.5-billion problem by adopting a variety of cuts and budget
adjustments in the current fiscal year, some of which will carry over
into 2002-03.</LD>
<TE>   In her annual critique of the governor's budget proposal, Hill
blamed the growing gap on a combination of overstated revenues to the
tune of $3.9 billion and understated expenses of $1.1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Hill has the advantage of analyzing December and January tax
receipts, unlike the Davis administration, which fashioned its
2002-03 spending plan late last year.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, Hill is predicting a steeper decline in the amount
of capital gains and stock-option income reported on returns. Her
office projects a 62% dip, compared with the 47% decline anticipated
by the administration.</TE>
<TE>   The state has grown increasingly dependent on such revenues in
recent years, but they have dropped off sharply because of the stock
market's downturn.</TE>
<TE>   Hill warned that California's fiscal woes may worsen if, as she
predicts, the federal government does not fully meet Davis' request
for $1.1 billion in assistance.</TE>
<TE>   The news isn't likely to get better any time soon. California
faces the prospect of ongoing operating shortfalls of $7 billion in
each of the two fiscal years starting in July 2003, Hill said.</TE>
<TE>   She also took the unusual step of supplying lawmakers with more
than 100 options to trim expenses, many of which are difficult to
imagine winning approval in an election year.</TE>
<TE>   They range from temporarily suspending dental services for
pregnant women to releasing inmates from prison early, raising
college tuition fees and reinstating recently reduced fees at state
parks.</TE>
<TE>   Options that touch Southern California in particular include
dashing subsidies for local film-production permits and eliminating
the Office of California-Mexico Affairs, which deals with
border-related economic issues.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of flexibility in terms of balancing," Hill said.
"But what you are doing is reducing services to the people of
California."</TE>
<TE>   Her list of budget-cutting ideas seemed to include something for
everyone to hate.</TE>
<TE>   "These are exactly the kind of recommendations we were afraid we'd
see if we needed to make cuts of this depth," said Beth Capell, a
spokeswoman for Health Access California, a coalition of more than
200 community, consumer and labor groups. "This illustrates that when
you cut $5 billion or more from the budget, real people get hurt in
real ways."</TE>
<TE>   The list included more than a dozen options designed to save the
state millions of dollars by relaxing California's system for
punishing criminals.</TE>
<TE>   David LaBahn of the California District Attorneys Assn. predicted
that crime and prison rates will rise if lawmakers sign off on all of
them.</TE>
<TE>   "You can certainly close the budget gap by not incarcerating
people or releasing them early," he said. "But what does that do for
public safety?"</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Gordon, executive director of the California Assn. of School
Business Officials, expressed alarm over an option that would save
the state $770 million by tapping dollars earmarked for education to
pay for certain child-care costs.</TE>
<TE>   Davis indicated in a radio interview Wednesday that he believes
that Hill's figures are overly pessimistic. Final budget decisions
ultimately will be based on how much money has landed in state
coffers by May, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Finance Director Tim Gage said he does not agree with Hill's
prediction that the state will have to spend $825 million more on
education than his office assumes, nor does he agree that the state
will face ongoing annual deficits of as much as $7 billion.</TE>
<TE>   State Senate Leader John Burton, the San Francisco Democrat who
has called for the restoration of top income-tax brackets, reiterated
his belief that a combination of cuts and new revenue should be used
to close the gap in light of Hill's latest analysis.</TE>
<TE>   "It's getting to almost an insurmountable situation, but we will
do our best to persevere," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Republican lawmakers placed the blame on Davis, whom they accused
of "cooking the books."</TE>
<TE>   "Not only is he playing politics with your money, but he's playing
politics with money you don't even have," said Senate Republican
Leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor tried to shove the problem under the rug," said
Assemblyman John Campbell (R-Irvine), vice chairman of the Assembly
Budget Committee. "But I'm not sure the rug is big enough for the
size of this problem."</TE>
<TE>   Hill generally appeared to approve of the governor's strategy of
using a combination of cuts, borrowing and new revenue to whittle the
shortfall, but she took aim at a variety of his proposals.</TE>
<TE>   Her office found numerous examples of what it described as highly
optimistic assumptions by the Davis administration. Hill noted, for
example, that the Davis budget assumes that the federal government
will chip in about $55 million a year to fund its portion of the
CalFed program, a state-federal partnership that addresses regional
water problems.</TE>
<TE>   But the federal government has yet to reimburse the $55 million
for the current budget year, making it "highly uncertain" that it
will do so during the next budget year, the analysis concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the Davis budget assumes that Proposition 40, a bond measure
on next month's ballot, will pass and that proceeds from the bond
could be used to fund CalFed.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers will need to consider other options if the bond measure
fails or the federal funds fail to materialize, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Hill raised concerns about the use of the state's motor vehicle
account to finance the California Highway Patrol's homeland security
costs.</TE>
<TE>   She said the account, which is primarily funded by car
registration fees and is supposed to finance car regulation and
enforcement, "is not an appropriate funding source" for security
measures.</TE>
<TE>   She predicted that if the state continues to use its money for
security, the fund will be $230 million in the red by the end of the
2003-04 budget year.</TE>
<TE>   Though the budget assumes that onetime federal funding will offset
the costs, Hill said that the chances of obtaining that money remain
"highly uncertain" and that, according to the CHP, those costs will
continue beyond the next budget year, placing pressure on future
budgets.</TE>
<TE>   Hill recommended that the Legislature reject both a proposal to
begin charging Medi-Cal beneficiaries co-payments and another
proposal by Davis to reduce provider rates for services supplied to
Medi-Cal recipients out of concern it would reduce patient access.</TE>
<TE>   Hill's complete analysis is available online, at www.lao.ca.gov.</TE>

<HD>Council Votes to Reopen Streets Around Barricaded Civic
Center</HD>
<DH>Security: Traffic could be whizzing by City Hall and Parker
Center by early next week.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Easing security measures taken after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks,
the Los Angeles City Council voted Wednesday to remove concrete
barriers blocking the streets around City Hall and the Parker Center
police headquarters.</LD>
<LD>   After a lengthy debate, the council voted 12 to 2 to reopen Los
Angeles, Main and Judge John Aiso streets between 1st and Temple
streets. The concrete barricades on the sidewalks around City Hall
will be replaced with strategically placed planters.</LD>
<LD>   City officials said they plan to have the streets reopened by
Monday.</LD>
<TE>   "I think if we continue to hide behind those barricades, and keep
the streets closed, the people who attacked this nation have won a
battle in itself," Councilman Hal Bernson told his colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, city officials have struggled to find a balance
between safety and open government in the Civic Center. Council
members said Wednesday that the street closures had robbed residents
of access to government.</TE>
<TE>   "I realize that the things that took place on Sept. 11 were so
tragic that they will forever change our lives," said Councilman Tom
LaBonge. "But we must look to open the building up.... It is a beacon
of democracy."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Nate Holden, who cast one of the dissenting votes,
urged his colleagues to delay action until the FBI lifts its latest
nationwide security alert.</TE>
<TE>   "Think about what you are doing here today," he said. "You are
giving access to terrorists you don't even know about. There are
terrorists in the city of Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Janice Hahn joined Holden in voting against the
changes, saying she would rather err on the side of caution.</TE>
<TE>   She also said Los Angeles Police Department officials would like
to leave the barriers in place, at least until March 11, when the
latest FBI alert is scheduled to end.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe our comings and goings at City Hall will ever be
the same," she said. "I think the terrorists are waiting for entities
like us to put our guard down."</TE>
<TE>   But other council members argued that the barriers were an
expensive facade that provided little protection to City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "While it looks ominous, it's really very porous," Bernson said of
the barricades.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Jack Weiss complained that the city was squandering
resources.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not made more safe or more secure by the restrictions that
are in place," he said. "We essentially have a fig leaf for security
in the City Hall area."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to voting to remove the barriers, council members
agreed to set up an "express employee entrance" to City Hall for city
workers with proper identification.</TE>
<TE>   The lawmakers also voted to spend $1.6 million from the
contingency portion of the seismic retrofit bond to repair the
elevators in City Hall, many of which have broken down in recent
weeks.</TE>

<HD>El Toro Debaters Clash, but Few Seem Swayed</HD>
<DH>Land use: Larry Agran and Bruce Nestande fence again over
growth and funding predictions, but contest is a draw.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the March 5 election just days away, Bruce Nestande and Irvine
Mayor Larry Agran, the two foremost speakers on either side of
Measure W--the countywide initiative that would replace an El Toro
airport with zoning for a park--faced off Wednesday in a debate in
Newport Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Agran, aware he was in pro-El Toro airport country, joked about
how his supporters wondered whether he needed a bodyguard.</LD>
<LD>   But he did his best to bring cities together for a so-called Great
Park at the 4,700-acre former Marine base. "This is not an Irvine
choice or a Newport Beach choice. It's a county choice."</LD>
<TE>   The pair have often gone toe-to-toe. Either because they've
exhausted the issue, or themselves, their debate at the Orange County
Coast Assn. luncheon, which drew 60 people, was more sedate than
acrimonious. Judging by the audience's tempered reaction, it's also
unlikely their arguments changed anyone's minds.</TE>
<TE>   Nestande, a former supervisor who chairs the pro-El Toro airport
Citizens for Jobs and the Economy, hammered at Agran and the
measure's organizers for never telling the public how the park could
be financed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's true," Agran said. "The measure doesn't actually say how it
will be funded. But mind you, we haven't been shown how to fund an
airport either. [The county] started with $2 billion and that went to
$3.2 billion and you can see that soon it's going to be $10 billion
to $15 billion."</TE>
<TE>   He said financing for the park would come from the revenue from
more than 1,100 housing units, office space and agricultural leases
at the former base, amounting to $25 million a year, which would be
placed in an endowment to build the park.</TE>
<TE>   "This can create the framework of a large metropolitan park,"
Agran said. "It can have colleges, universities, soccer fields,
veterans memorials, even a related cemetery. You name it, it's all
possible."</TE>
<TE>   It's more like a fantasy, Nestande responded.</TE>
<TE>   "Of the 1,100 homes or housing units there, 260 have been
condemned, 600 were built in 1984 and some are sorely in need of
major rehabilitation. The idea that there are these beautiful homes
sitting there waiting to make revenue is fantasy. It can't be done
without considerable money being poured in to rehabilitate them."</TE>
<TE>   Nestande said that when he was on the Board of Supervisors, he and
the late Thomas F. Riley helped modernize John Wayne Airport, which
Newport Beach residents are fighting to keep small to limit noise and
pollution.</TE>
<TE>   "It was determined in the '80s that John Wayne Airport wouldn't
handle the future aviation needs of Orange County," Nestande said.</TE>
<TE>   But the two disagreed on whether growth mandates that an airport
be built at El Toro. With a population of 3 million people and an
economy that ranks 32nd among nations in gross national product,
Nestande said, the county is part of a region that will demand more
airports.</TE>
<TE>   According to Agran, however, the county's projected growth is
estimated at only 14% through 2020. "The real growth in Southern
California will be in Palmdale and the Inland Empire," he said.</TE>
<TE>   John Wayne's runway lengths limit the types of jet aircraft that
can operate there. In addition, a 1985 court agreement allows for a
night curfew and limits noise, passengers and the number of daily
flights. The agreement runs through Dec. 31, 2005.</TE>
<TE>   If an El Toro airport is built, it will ease the airport tension
in Newport Beach. But if Measure W is approved, then airlines will
pressure the county for more flights at John Wayne, Nestande said.</TE>
<TE>   Agran used Nestande's remarks to solicit the help of Newport Beach
residents in the audience, saying that if John Wayne's restrictions
are lifted, Irvine will also be adversely affected.</TE>
<TE>   Don Willet, a Newport Beach businessman, echoed the sentiments of
many in the audience: "In my opinion, the truth is always somewhere
in the middle of what people are saying. I believe the [El Toro]
airport is something the county needs in order to survive and grow."</TE>

<HD>Girl Dies, 5 Injured as Palmdale Home Burns</HD>
<DH>Fire: Two of those hurt in fast-moving flames are also
children. Cause is under investigation.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One child died and two others were clinging to life Wednesday after a
fire swept through a Palmdale home.</LD>
<LD>   Three adults also were injured.</LD>
<LD>   "They came out yelling, 'The babies are burning!'" said landscaper
Bryan Benson, 44, who was working nearby and was summoned to the
single-story home in the 38700 block of Stanridge Avenue by two of
the adults.</LD>
<TE>   Unable to enter the house because of the intense heat and flames,
Benson and three colleagues stood by grimly as firefighters pulled
out the three children, two boys ages 3 and 4 and a 6-year-old girl.</TE>
<TE>   The girl, Rochelle Fuentes, was pronounced dead at the scene, Los
Angeles County Assistant Fire Chief Bill Bell said.</TE>
<TE>   The two boys, whose names were not released, were taken by
ambulance to Antelope Valley Medical Center and later airlifted to
Childrens Hospital in Los Angeles, where they were in critical
condition, a hospital spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   An aunt and uncle of the children suffered smoke inhalation, and a
second uncle was taken to Grossman Burn Center in Sherman Oaks with
severe burns on his face. All three were in serious condition,
authorities said. Their names were not released.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County sheriff's homicide detectives were initially
called to the scene to work with county arson investigators. By late
Wednesday, investigators had not determined the fire's cause.</TE>
<TE>   Benson said he was working nearby with colleagues from his
brother's Quartz Hill landscaping company when the fire erupted about
10:20 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   "We [saw] the smoke coming out of the house," Benson said, "Flames
starting coming and the windows started shattering."</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters returning from another call and driving along Avenue
Q noticed the smoke and headed for the Stanridge Avenue home. When
they entered the house, they found one of the adults burned and
semiconscious in the kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   The flames had spread quickly through the house, filling it with
thick, black smoke, including the bedroom where the children were
sleeping, Bell said. The three children were carried to the front
lawn, where firefighters tried to resuscitate them.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said the children's grandparents lived in the home,
which they had rented for 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Bell said the children's parents had a court appointment Wednesday
on an unspecified legal matter, but it was unclear if they were at
the courthouse when the fire broke out.</TE>

<HD>Killer to Stay in Hospital Longer</HD>
<DH>Crime: Bid to release man who slew two during a psychotic
episode is rejected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man who killed a father and daughter during a psychotic episode in
the Ojai Valley nearly five years ago lost a bid for freedom
Wednesday and will remain at a state hospital for at least another
year.</LD>
<LD>   During an afternoon hearing before Superior Court Judge Edward F.
Brodie, defense attorneys asked for the release of Michael Hugo
Garcia, since state doctors have found that he is no longer
dangerous.</LD>
<LD>   But Brodie rejected the request and agreed with a prosecutor, who
said that county doctors have found Garcia unfit and that consensus
is needed among all the doctors before release can be considered.</LD>
<TE>   "In my opinion ... I don't think he should ever be released,"
Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Kathleen O'Brien said outside court. "No
one was able to control him before.... I don't think they will be
able to now."</TE>
<TE>   Garcia, once a part-time Ojai Valley resident who lived next door
to his victims, has been at Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino
County since 1997. He did not attend Wednesday's hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a denial of his rights," attorney James Farley said after
the hearing. Farley said he will appeal the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia, now 47, was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the
killings of Albert "Jim" Alexander, 83, and his 43-year-old daughter,
Helen Giardina, on May 22, 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia, a former furniture salesman, had gone to his neighbors'
home for dinner. He shot Alexander and Giardina, claiming he was
killing the devil and a demon. Giardina's then 3-year-old son
witnessed the slayings.</TE>
<TE>   The central issue in Wednesday's hearing was whether Brodie would
agree to hold a hearing in the near future in which he would hear
testimony from all the medical experts and determine for himself
whether Garcia should be freed.</TE>
<TE>   Farley's colleague, attorney Kay Duffy, argued that state law
demands that such a hearing be held when state doctors deem a patient
appropriate for release.</TE>
<TE>   The defense team wanted a chance to prove that Garcia was suitable
for the Ventura County Conditional Release Program, in which mental
health experts monitor released patients and assist them with therapy
and medication.</TE>
<TE>   O'Brien argued that state law required Brodie to hold a hearing
only if both state doctors and county doctors agreed on Garcia's
condition and if there was an adequate treatment plan in place for
him after release.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Beimforde, director of the county's conditional release
program, wrote an opinion in which she said: "The defendant continues
to pose a danger to the community and is not now ready for outpatient
treatment."</TE>
<TE>   A psychologist hired by the court agreed with Beimforde.</TE>
<TE>   Duffy countered the prosecutor's claim by saying that county
doctors had based their opinions solely on reading reports and
visiting Garcia twice a year.</TE>
<TE>   "What's being done here is an attempt [by the prosecution] to
circumvent the court's right [to decide what happens to Garcia]," she
argued during the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Both defense attorneys said the release process appears to give
far too much power to county officials.</TE>

<HD>Riordan's New Primary Focus: GOP Rival Simon</HD>
<DH>Politics: He airs attack and turns attention from Davis as
Republican race for governor heats up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK and TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Abandoning efforts to stay above the Republican fight, Richard
Riordan leveled a scathing advertising attack Wednesday on GOP rival
Bill Simon Jr., questioning his business acumen and fitness to serve
as governor.</LD>
<LD>   The charges, in a 30-second spot airing statewide, represent a
significant change in tone for Riordan, reflecting a heightened
concern about his prospects in the March 5 primary--and a new
hostility toward the man he calls a friend and had urged to enter the
race.</LD>
<LD>   "Who is Bill Simon?" asks the advertisement, which then accuses
him of financial mismanagement and failing to vote in several
elections. "Is he really ready for California's toughest job?"</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for Simon said Riordan "should be ashamed of himself."</TE>
<TE>   "Dick Riordan is doing exactly the same thing Gray Davis is doing,
which is attacking because they don't have anything to say about
solving California's problems," said Sal Russo, manager of Simon's
campaign. "Riordan hasn't offered a single idea since his campaign
started."</TE>
<TE>   The attack ad--the first negative spot Riordan has broadcast--came
as the GOP candidates for governor worked to build their ground-level
support with appearances from San Diego to Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Former Los Angeles Mayor Riordan toured a Vista electronics plant,
where he promoted tax cuts. Simon made stops in Sacramento and San
Francisco to tout education reform. Secretary of State Bill Jones was
in San Diego, accusing Riordan of flip-flopping on issues such as
abortion, the death penalty and tax-cutting Proposition 13.</TE>
<TE>   Incumbent Democrat Davis, who launched an audacious ad Tuesday
night featuring former Republican Gov. George Deukmejian criticizing
Riordan, planned to pull the spot this morning in favor of a more
traditional advertisement touting his record in office and recalling
his service in Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   As the flurry of activity suggests, California's airwaves are the
place where elections are typically won and lost. With the GOP race
growing tighter and seemingly more volatile, strategists were busy
Wednesday poring over polling data and TV schedules, in some cases
shifting their advertising hour by hour and city by city.</TE>
<TE>   The aerial assault by Riordan telegraphed concerns that after
months atop the opinion polls, he now faces a serious fight for the
GOP nomination.</TE>
<TE>   As the front-runner, Riordan long refused to engage in the sniping
that has characterized the Republican primary, aiming his ire for the
most part at Davis. But even some advisors now question the wisdom of
that strategy, as Simon appears to have gained momentum and
solidified support among the party's conservative base, which may
wield outsized influence if voter turnout is low.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, it was Riordan who coaxed Simon, a friend and fellow
parishioner at the same Santa Monica church, to make his maiden run
for office. Months later, Riordan jumped into the contest at the
beckoning of the White House. Awkward as it was, both men expressed
nothing but good will--until recently, when Simon started creeping up
on Riordan in the polls.</TE>
<TE>   Any semblance of fraternity was altogether abandoned in Riordan's
new ad, which accuses Simon of mismanaging family investments and
failing to vote "in 13 of 20 elections," involving "issues like
school construction, anti-crime measures and bilingual education."</TE>
<TE>   Simon has admitted that he did not vote in three recent Republican
primaries, calling it a mistake. His staff has said that polling
records do not confirm any more missed votes.</TE>
<TE>   The financial mismanagement cited in Riordan's ad referred to the
Simon family's long-ago investment in thefailed Western Federal
Savings and Loan. The institution's collapse cost the Simons $40
million, not counting the costs to taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   Simon accuses the federal government of prematurely taking over
the S&amp;L, saying government officials reneged on the terms of the deal
his father had worked out when it was purchased. The allegation is
the subject of a pending civil lawsuit by the investors against
federal regulators.</TE>
<TE>   "These ads are false," said Russo, of the Simon camp. Riordan
"knows they're false and still he says it. He needs to go back to St.
Monica's," the church where the two men worship.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, for his part, laughed off Davis' own attack ad.</TE>
<TE>   "I have more interesting things to do with my life," Riordan said,
when asked whether he had seen the spot featuring Deukmejian, who has
endorsed Jones. "You just can't keep up with the misinformation that
the governor is putting out."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan made the remarks in a brief appearance in Vista, at a
north San Diego County electronic manufacturing plant owned by a
Vietnamese family.</TE>
<TE>   He praised the company, DDH Enterprises Inc., as a symbol of
capitalism at its best and used the occasion to urge elimination of
the sales tax on manufacturing equipment. Riordan touted the proposal
as a way to boost the state's economy and attract industry to
California. He said his proposal, involving an issue dear to
conservatives, would cost about $400 million annually.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, in San Diego, questioned Riordan's trustworthiness and also
took a swipe at Simon's spotty voting record.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, meantime, pitched education reform in a speech to the
Commonwealth Club in San Francisco and at Bowling Green Elementary, a
charter school in a blue-collar neighborhood of Sacramento.</TE>

<HD>Hoffman's Business Savvy Is Tested</HD>
<DH>Supervisors: Problems with company ventures are cited.
Calling critics naive, the candidate says start-ups are risky.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County supervisorial candidate Randy Hoffman makes a point of
playing up his business credentials at every stop on the campaign
trail.</LD>
<LD>   He tells how he built an unknown company with five employees into
a satellite technology powerhouse with a payroll of 500. And he
promises to use that business experience to whip the county's budget
into shape.</LD>
<LD>   What he doesn't mention, Hoffman's critics say, is that one of his
more recent business ventures is teetering near financial collapse.
Or that a lawsuit filed Feb. 5 contends the millionaire businessman
and his company, Outdoor Marketplace, owe $171,000 in back rent on
Thousand Oaks office space.</LD>
<TE>   Outdoor Marketplace, which Hoffman helped start and ran until
recently, abruptly closed its Web site last month and stopped paying
suppliers.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit filed in Ventura County Superior Court alleges the
company was two years behind in rent when it vacated the premises on
Jan. 7.</TE>
<TE>   Salvage Plan Is in Place, Hoffman Says</TE>
<TE>   Although the candidate insists a salvage plan is in place, critics
say the firm's problems show Hoffman is not the capitalist wunderkind
he makes himself out to be--and that he can't be trusted to tell
voters the truth.</TE>
<TE>   Debbie Gregory, who owns a small advertising agency in Thousand
Oaks, said Hoffman should pledge to repay every creditor the company
owes.</TE>
<TE>   And he should be more up front in his campaign speeches and
literature concerning the Internet company's debts, said Gregory, who
is supporting Hoffman's rival, Thousand Oaks City Councilwoman Linda
Parks, in the March 5 primary.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have a candidate who says he has the business acumen to
run the county, the public has a right to know what's really going
on," Gregory said.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman dismisses the criticism as naive.</TE>
<TE>   Getting a new company off the ground is always risky, Hoffman
said. He said this is especially true for high-flying Internet
start-ups.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're going to play in the world of start-ups and venture
capital, you're going to see these things happen," Hoffman said. "My
opponent has decided to stir this up 14 days before the election so
she can generate some negative headlines."</TE>
<TE>   Outdoor Marketplace sold outdoor recreation equipment through a
Web site called Beoutdoors.com until last month, Hoffman said.</TE>
<TE>   Sales at the company, which was created three years ago, began
foundering in late 2000 and took another dive after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, he said.</TE>
<TE>   By January, a decision had been made to shut down the site and
start looking for other partners, Hoffman said.</TE>
<TE>   Role in Company's Operation Diminishes</TE>
<TE>   Although he is listed on incorporation papers as the firm's
president, Hoffman said he has not been involved in its daily
operations for four or five months.</TE>
<TE>   He said he owns less than 5% of the firm's stock and that three
investors who hold the majority have taken over decision-making.</TE>
<TE>   He declined to identify them, calling the information private. But
he said shareholders recently struck an agreement with Gear-Out,
another Internet company that sells outdoor goods, to redirect
Internet users to its site and share any revenue generated.</TE>
<TE>   That money will be used to pay off creditors, he said. "It hasn't
failed yet. It's struggling," he said. "But so do seven out of 10
start-ups."</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit seeking back rent is a "legitimate dispute" the courts
will sort through, Hoffman said. He maintains he is individually
named in the suit only because his candidacy has made him a
high-profile target.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are in the venture capital world, you set up
corporations to make sure you are not exposing individuals to
liability. That's just standard practice," he said. "What they are
doing is attempting to embarrass me and coerce me into somehow
creating a settlement because I am running for office."</TE>
<TE>   The company's problems may be enough to give Parks and her
supporters a wedge with which to attack Hoffman's business
credentials in the final days of the 2nd District race.</TE>
<TE>   Parks so far has declined to weigh in on the problems at Outdoor
Marketplace.</TE>
<TE>   Taking Full Responsibility</TE>
<TE>   But others say Hoffman should step to the plate and take full
responsibility for the company's woes.</TE>
<TE>   Cheryl Barrickman, a credit manager at an Artesia fishing
equipment manufacturing firm, said her company is owed money by
Beoutdoors.com. She declined to say how much.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't leave us in good standing," Barrickman said. "And
whether you have 5% or 80% [share of stock], you should do the right
thing."</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman counters that the Outdoor Marketplace venture is just one
of about a dozen he has been associated with since he sold his stake
in Magellan, the technology company he co-founded in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Magellan, purchased by Thales Navigation, produces satellite
tracking equipment used by motorists, sailors, hikers and law
enforcement and was posting $100 million in annual sales when Hoffman
sold his stake in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman said he brings investors together and offers help in
getting companies off the ground. He said sometimes it pays off and
sometimes it doesn't.</TE>
<TE>   Successful ventures include Escend Technologies, a software
company based in Silicon Valley, and Space Data Corp., a technology
firm in Arizona, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "To attack me for participating in helping entrepreneurs reach
their dreams is outrageous," he said. "Investors know about the
risk."</TE>

<HD>Housing Authority Target of Lawsuit, Federal Audit</HD>
<DH>Investigation: HUD officials are looking into allegations
of financial mismanagement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Persistent allegations of financial wrongdoing at public housing
projects have triggered a federal audit of the Los Angeles Housing
Authority and a third lawsuit in three years charging retaliation
against people who complained.</LD>
<LD>   At issue, city officials said, is whether the agency or others
misspent some of the $25 million in federal funds funneled to
residents for providing security, janitorial and moving services at
the 20 city-run housing developments.</LD>
<LD>   "There is an audit in progress," said Mimi Lee, district inspector
general for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.</LD>
<TE>   Tenant leaders, agency contractors and their attorney said they
have met with federal auditors and turned over a large number of
documents generated by the latest lawsuit. The audit is to determine
whether federal money was misused and could result in HUD seeking
reimbursement from the Housing Authority. There is no criminal
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   In two previous lawsuits, the agency was required to pay judgments
totaling $1.8 million to whistle-blowers, including former manager
Margaret Gardenhire.</TE>
<TE>   Federal auditors are reviewing the latest lawsuit, now pending, in
which a moving company owner alleges city managers received cash
meant for poor residents, manipulated bids on contracts, tolerated
double-billing by a well-connected consultant and retaliated against
those who got in the way.</TE>
<TE>   Several tenant leaders alleged in depositions that agency managers
took away contracts when they complained about excessive consultant
costs and double-billing.</TE>
<TE>   Among the allegations in the lawsuit are those made by Barron
Gardner, who owns Barron's Moving and Storage in Van Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   Gardner alleges that the Housing Authority has taken away business
and withheld payments after he rebuffed a longtime authority
consultant who wanted a 10% payment to help Gardner get a moving
contract that eventually was worth more than $300,000.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the evidence shows that the Housing Authority is involved
in the misappropriation of funds," said Lenton Aikins, the attorney
who is handling the latest lawsuit. He won the two earlier suits that
ended in large judgments for whistle-blowers.</TE>
<TE>   Martha Shen-Urquidez, an attorney for the Housing Authority, said
there is no merit to the allegations, which she described as coming
from disgruntled former agency contractors.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit, scheduled for a hearing Feb. 27 in Los Angeles
Superior Court, also alleges officials engaged in "misuse and
mismanagement" of funds that were meant to help poor residents of the
projects. It seeks unspecified damages and a court order requiring
reform of agency contracting practices.</TE>
<TE>   At the center of the controversy is private consultant Dwayne
Williams, who has received $125-an-hour contracts to help resident
groups organize security, moving and janitorial services at six city
housing projects. Williams is a defendant in the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Based on billings Aikins obtained from the agency, he estimated
that Williams has been paid more than $1.2 million since 1995 by the
agency and resident groups at Jordan Downs, Pueblo del Rio, Estrada
Courts, William Mead, San Fernando Gardens and Aliso Village.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit alleges that tenant complaints about double billing
and excessive charges by Williams were ignored by agency Assistant
Director Lucille Loyce.</TE>
<TE>   Dorothy Toliver, former president of the Resident Management
Council at Jordan Downs and former head of the Jordan Downs
Management Group Inc., said in a deposition that Williams was hired
to help her management council set up a thrift store to employ
residents.</TE>
<TE>   The store was never opened, but tenant leaders said in depositions
and interviews that they paid themselves bonuses at the urging of
Williams, who managed the finances for the corporation. Officials
denied Williams approved bonuses.</TE>
<TE>   Toliver, who was president of the Jordan Downs resident management
group from 1995 to 2000, said in a deposition taken by Housing
Authority attorneys that she accepted bonuses of about $500 twice.
She also said in the statement that she gave Loyce $500 in cash
twice, and bought a $400 purse for Loyce.</TE>
<TE>   "That is an absolute, outright fabrication," Shen-Urquidez said.</TE>
<TE>   Loyce and other authority officials deny they received money or
that Williams had acted improperly.</TE>
<TE>   Shen-Urquidez said the tenant leaders made allegations against
Williams after he reported the improper bonuses and other spending.</TE>
<TE>   She credited Loyce and Williams with bringing millions of dollars
to job-creation programs in Jordan Downs and other housing projects.</TE>
<TE>   Gardner, the Van Nuys mover who has done business with the agency
for 15 years, alleged in the lawsuit that Williams "demanded" that he
pay 10% to Williams "in return for a guarantee that plaintiff would
receive the William Mead [moving] contract."</TE>
<TE>   Gardner said that he rejected Williams' demand and lost the
contract.</TE>
<TE>   In the previous suits against the Housing Authority, the biggest
judgment involved Margaret Gardenhire, an agency manager who oversaw
activity at Jordan Downs and was once named employee of the year. A
jury awarded her $1.3 million for claims of retaliation for reporting
complaints about Williams.</TE>
<TE>   The other whistle-blower suit was filed by Housing Authority
contracting director George Marioneaux in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   He alleged retaliation for his "refusal to violate the law and
engage in fraudulent and excessive invoicing of the federal
government following the January 1994 Northridge earthquake."</TE>
<TE>   A jury awarded Marioneaux $572,992 in damages. The two parties
later reached a confidential settlement, which ended an appeal.</TE>

<HD>Students Learn the Hard Way</HD>
<DH>Education: It takes a car battery to open a soda can during
UCI's Engineering Week. Inventor who finds the most arduous way to do
everyday task wins.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATTHEW EBNET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a day when simple just wouldn't do, Javier Pinasio smiled with
pride at his invention: a 4-foot-high contraption with an umbrella
and a car stereo that belted out a Britney Spears song when its task
was complete.</LD>
<LD>   How else would an engineering student go about opening a 12-ounce
can of soda?</LD>
<LD>   Pinasio was among about 30 UC Irvine students who gathered
Wednesday for one of the highlights of Engineering Week, a
29-year-old competition that blends ingenuity and a finely tuned
sense of humor.</LD>
<TE>   The Rube Goldberg competition--named after the inventor/cartoonist
who lampooned man's inclination to find hard ways to do simple
things--challenges students to come up with the most complicated
way--if not the worst, one student said--to perform an everyday task.</TE>
<TE>   Students didn't open the soda can with their fingers or a Swiss
Army knife or some fancy gadget from Radio Shack--that would be
downright insulting. Instead, they did it with car batteries, a
windshield-wiper motor from a 1968 Pontiac Firebird, Popsicle sticks,
car stereos and even--in one stroke of genius--gravity.</TE>
<TE>   "The more complicated the better," said the 23-year-old Pinasio.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up trying to figure out how things worked, building
things, taking things apart. This was so much fun. Built in, like, a
day."</TE>
<TE>   Pinasio and his partner managed to open a can of soda using a
4-foot-high square-framed contraption that, with its umbrella,
resembled an early flying machine.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Rube Goldberg competition is the centerpiece of
Engineering Week, the five-day science fest offers a range of events
testing human and machine.</TE>
<TE>   There is a video game competition, a paper airplane-making contest
and--for those who fancy structural engineering--a Popsicle stick
bridge-building contest.</TE>
<TE>   But many students said the Rube Goldberg competition is the most
exciting and allows engineering students the excuse to take
creativity to the extreme.</TE>
<TE>   Creativity Makes the Contest Fun</TE>
<TE>   Arlene Doria, a 22-year-old senior with a double major in chemical
engineering and biology, helped Pinasio with the project, including
the device that flipped on the Britney Spears jingle when the soft
drink was opened."The creativity behind it is what makes it fun," she
said. "You really can have some fun."</TE>
<TE>   Tuan Tran didn't make the cut in the preliminaries this year, thus
getting edged out of the $300 first prize that will be awarded
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   He said he was dispirited, because he is a senior and this was his
last chance.</TE>
<TE>   His contraption, which uses a wooden car that travels down a
bridge and a string attached to the car and the pull tab, took three
tries to open the can.</TE>
<TE>   When it did open, a crowd of about 20 people cheered.</TE>
<TE>   But Tran knew his run was over.</TE>
<TE>   "Mine just wasn't complex enough," he said. "And we had some
trouble with the length of the string we needed. The wind also
damaged one tube I needed."</TE>
<TE>   Tran said he will gear up for the paper airplane contest and the
Popsicle stick competition.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I have a chance," he said.</TE>

<HD>Porn Case Hinges on Hacker</HD>
<DH>Courts: Accused O.C. judge's defense attacks the
credibility of the man who says he accessed images on the jurist's
computer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A mysterious Canadian computer hacker who allegedly stole an
electronic diary purporting to detail the sexual fantasies of an
Orange County judge admitted to authorities that he's hacked into
thousands of other computers, according to a police affidavit made
public this week.</LD>
<LD>   The hacker's credibility--and whether he worked on behalf of
authorities--is emerging as a central question in the case against
Judge Ronald C. Kline, who stands accused of downloading child
pornography to his home and courthouse computers.</LD>
<LD>   The hacker worked with Canadian police on at least one
high-profile child porn case, the police affidavits said, but he was
also suspected of possessing pornography and under investigation by
the U.S. Customs Bureau.</LD>
<TE>   The hacker, who was not named in the affidavit, describes himself
as a "predator hunter" who accessed a diary and pornographic images
on Kline's computer, which was eventually turned over to authorities
last summer, the affidavit states.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine detectives and federal agents used the hacker's evidence to
obtain a search warrant of Kline's home and courthouse computers.</TE>
<TE>   The search unearthed more than 100 images of photographs showing
young boys engaged in sex acts.</TE>
<TE>   But in their latest court filings, Kline's defense attorneys
attacked the hacker's credibility, saying that taking the judge's
diary was illegal and suggesting that the hacker was working on
behalf of law enforcement at the time.</TE>
<TE>   If a judge agrees that the hacker was indeed a police agent, the
computer evidence could well be thrown out of court.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys also raised the possibility that the hacker
could have doctored the diary and computer images that form the
bedrock of federal prosecutors' case against Kline.</TE>
<TE>   "A person who can" hack, wrote attorney Paul S. Meyer in the court
papers filed last week, "can also enter a personal computer secretly
and alter its contents and add materials not previously present."</TE>
<TE>   The latest filings offer the best portrait yet of the shadowy
figure whose computer work ultimately led to last November's federal
grand jury indictment of Kline, who also faces separate state child
molestation charges. Kline has pleaded not guilty to the federal
charges and is running for reelection on the March 5 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine police learned about the hacker's infiltration of the
judge's computer from Julie Posey, founder of the Colorado-based
Internet watchdog group, Pedowatch, which received an anonymous tip
along with Kline's diary from the hacker.</TE>
<TE>   The hacker, the affidavit says, told Posey he was working as an
informant for customs agents.</TE>
<TE>   The computer diary detailed intimate thoughts that the author
described about boys he met at an Orange County Little League
baseball club, particularly about one 13-year-old player.</TE>
<TE>   "I gave a lot of thought today about this business of approaching
these kids too fast," the diary says, according to the affidavit.
"You have to make them come to you or it doesn't work."</TE>
<TE>   After receiving the diary, Irvine detectives were left with the
task of trying to track down the hacker, documents show. They finally
found him, even though the anonymous tipster did his best to hide his
tracks.</TE>
<TE>   Hacker Said to Be on Both Sides of Law</TE>
<TE>   The hacker did not return e-mails from investigators. Customs
officials served a summons for information from the company that
provided the hacker with an e-mail account. But the address turned
out to be phony.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Det. Ron Carr eventually discovered a Web site the hacker
was operating. He called Vancouver police to help contact the company
that owned the site.</TE>
<TE>   But the Canadian police said they actually knew all about the
operator of the site, who turned out to be the hacker Carr was
searching for.</TE>
<TE>   The hacker, the Royal Canadian Mountain Police told Carr, was
"essential in the apprehension" two years ago of a father suspected
of offering his 8-year-old daughter for sex over the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Canadian authorities told Carr that the hacker, who allegedly
possessed "large quantities of child pornography," was no longer
working as an informant, according to the court documents.</TE>
<TE>   But the hacker had recently been on the other end of an
investigation. Customs agents told Carr that the hacker was
considered a suspect in at least one federal child pornography
investigation last year, the records state, though they provide no
other details about the case.</TE>
<TE>   In August, Carr and a customs agent flew to Langley, British
Columbia--a small town just outside Vancouver--to interview the
hacker.</TE>
<TE>   There, he told the officers how he created a virus to infect the
computers of suspected traders in kiddie porn. The virus allowed him
to examine the contents of each machine he infected.</TE>
<TE>   Between 2,000 and 3,000 computers worldwide had been infiltrated
by the virus, he told the officers.</TE>
<TE>   The hacker described his virus as "the Trojan Horse" because it is
attached to an Internet file that is downloaded onto the computer.</TE>

<HD>Former Rampart Officer to Be Tried</HD>
<DH>Beating: The defendant is accused of joining with other
policemen, including Rafael Perez, to assault and frame a reputed
gang member.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GLOVER and MATT LAIT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge on Wednesday ordered a former LAPD
Rampart Division officer to stand trial in the alleged 1998 beating
and framing of a reputed gang member.</LD>
<LD>   After a three-day preliminary hearing, Judge William R. Chidsey
Jr. ruled that the district attorney's office had presented enough
evidence about the case to try ex-Officer Ethan Cohan on charges of
assault with a deadly weapon, perjury, filing a false police report
and conspiracy.</LD>
<LD>   During the hearing, former Officer Camerino Mesina testified that
he saw Cohan strike Gabriel Aguirre multiple times with either his
fists or a metal flashlight during the March 26, 1998, arrest.</LD>
<TE>   Mesina and two other former officers testified that information in
Aguirre's arrest report, signed by Cohan, was false.</TE>
<TE>   Cohan, 31, has pleaded not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   His lawyer, Harland W. Braun, argued that the testimony of the
three ex-officers was tainted because they had access to a statement
Cohan was compelled to give about the case when he was still employed
by the Los Angeles Police Department. Such statements cannot be used
against the person who gave them in a criminal proceeding because
officers are forced to give them under penalty of firing, and the
U.S. Constitution prohibits defendants from being compelled to
testify against themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors countered that their case was built on evidence that
was independent of the facts contained in Cohan's statement. The
statement, they argued, contained essentially the same information
that was in police reports about the incident and therefore did not
contribute to the case against Cohan.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Chidsey agreed, saying he didn't see any evidence that the
district attorney's case had benefited from the officers having had
access to Cohan's statement.</TE>
<TE>   The charges against Cohan, who was fired from the LAPD and is now
a law school student, arose out of the Rampart corruption scandal and
were among the allegations made by ex-Officer Rafael Perez.</TE>
<TE>   As part of a plea deal, Perez agreed to identify police crimes and
misconduct in exchange for a lighter sentence for stealing drugs from
LAPD evidence lockers.</TE>
<TE>   In one interview with investigators, Perez said he and Officers
Cohan, Shawn Gomez, Manuel Chavez and Mesina took part in an attack
on Aguirre when they arrested him in a vacant apartment on Witmer
Street on charges of assault with a deadly weapon.</TE>
<TE>   According to the police reports at the time, the officers said
Aguirre assaulted them as he resisted arrest. They said he sustained
injuries by falling down stairs as he tried to escape.</TE>
<TE>   Perez, however, said the officers concocted the story about
Aguirre resisting arrest to explain the injuries he sustained during
the beating. Aguirre overheard the officers talking about how they
were going to report the incident and started to complain, Perez
said. Perez said he responded by pushing Aguirre into a wall.</TE>
<TE>   Mesina, Gomez and Chavez all testified that Aguirre peacefully
submitted to the arrest, and that none of them saw Aguirre assault
any officer.</TE>
<TE>   Mesina said he saw Perez and Cohan strike Aguirre, but the other
officers testified that they left the apartment building after the
arrest to get to their patrol car and did not see Cohan or anyone
else beat Aguirre.</TE>
<TE>   Gomez, who has pleaded no contest to a charge of filing a false
report, testified as part of a plea bargain in which prosecutors
agreed not to oppose reducing the charges to a misdemeanor, and to
recommend that he be put on probation and perform community service.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez is cooperating with prosecutors as part of a plea bargain
in which he pleaded no contest to assault under color of authority.
Mesina has been granted immunity in exchange for his cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   Cohan is scheduled to be arraigned March 11.</TE>

<HD>'Old College Try' Brings Cheney to Chapman</HD>
<DH>Education: University President Doti works his connections
to invite the nation's second lady as guest speaker.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Chapman University President James L. Doti heard that Vice
President Dick Cheney and his wife were paying a visit to Orange
County this month, he immediately got on the phone to invite the
nation's second lady to the campus in Orange.</LD>
<LD>   He reminded Lynne Cheney's aides that she had visited the
university 10 years earlier during her tenure as the controversial
head of the National Endowment for the Humanities.</LD>
<LD>   It worked: On Wednesday, 250 of Chapman's trustees, major donors,
faculty and students got a chance to hear Cheney, a senior fellow at
the conservative American Enterprise Institute, express her views on
how history is taught. Students, Cheney said, need to know the basic
facts of history before they are introduced to different views.</LD>
<TE>   She said that she had read books assigned in undergraduate history
and education courses and found some "very surprising ideas."</TE>
<TE>   According to one book, she said, the Union victory in the Civil
War may have meant freedom for slaves, but it also concluded that
"working-class Americans of every race were subsequently enslaved by
capitalism."</TE>
<TE>   "My concern is that in our high schools and colleges and
universities, we are no longer conveying knowledge of the great
events and figures of the past," she said in the campus' Waltmar
Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   About 100 audience members got a chance to lunch with Cheney, a
coup of sorts for Doti, who pointed out to her aides the university's
tie to George Argyros, a major GOP fund-raiser and chairman of
Chapman's Board of Trustees for 26 years who is now U.S. ambassador
to Spain.</TE>
<TE>   "People who donate to the university do it because of the things
we do," Doti said in an interview Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important just as we get so much from these people, we have
to give back and show that a lively intellectual life extends beyond
the classroom."</TE>
<TE>   After Cheney spoke for 20 minutes and answered students'
questions, she was interviewed by the university president for his
half-hour weekly TV show, "Dialogue with Doti," which runs on KDOC.
The show will air in April.</TE>

<HD>Muslim Hamlet Blames Sept. 11 for New Scrutiny</HD>
<DH>Conflict: Leader says probes of settlement and its charter
schools are due to prejudice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM OVEREND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FRESNO</DL>
<LD>Above the snow line in the mountains east of Fresno is a small Muslim
community called Baladullah--mostly African American families
escaping big city problems.</LD>
<LD>   Since Sept. 11, its 100 or so residents have faced a problem they
might never have predicted. They are caught in a two-front war their
tough-minded leader is waging--for economic survival and the right to
live in peace.</LD>
<LD>   Khadijah Ghafur, who helped found Baladullah six years ago, heads
a chain of charter schools based 60 miles away in the flatlands. The
Fresno school board revoked the charter of her Gateway Academy
schools last month, and Ghafur is determined to keep them running.</LD>
<TE>   Officials say they annulled the charter largely because the
schools had serious financial problems. Ghafur, who was fighting
civil rights battles at the age of 14 during the 1960s, says racism
and anti-Muslim hysteria are the real reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Almost immediately after Sept. 11, local attention was drawn to
Baladullah and the Gateway schools.</TE>
<TE>   The Baladullah property includes a firing range and an old landing
strip for private planes. Neighbors reported hearing gunshots from
time to time. The local media pounced. Some hinted strongly that
Baladullah might be a terrorist camp.</TE>
<TE>   The news accounts scared some of Baladullah's neighbors. So
residents held an open house and answered questions from the eight or
so people who attended. Still, one night a pickup truck full of white
men roared into the camp, its occupants shouting racist threats.</TE>
<TE>   In response to complaints from neighbors and the media attention,
the FBI began interviewing Baladullah residents about activity there.</TE>
<TE>   Gateway schools, meanwhile, were already the subject of scrutiny
by local authorities who had been looking into the academy before
Sept. 11. They said Gateway was deeply in debt, failed to keep
adequate records and allowed the teaching of religion in two of its
11 branches, located in Fresno and other California cities.</TE>
<TE>   As school officials intensified their probe, state authorities
launched a fraud investigation.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 10 the Anti-Defamation League weighed in, calling the
charter school outrageous and citing media reports linking it to "an
Islamic terrorist group."</TE>
<TE>   Ghafur says the Jan. 16 charter revocation that shut off state
money, and the increased interest in Baladullah, stem from
anti-Muslim sentiments. "We have absolutely no involvement in any
terrorist activity," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything just went haywire after 9/11," Ghafur said. "Islam is
on trial, and we as Americans are on trial as we deal with it. This
is not the American way."</TE>
<TE>   Land Once Belonged to Synanon Program</TE>
<TE>   California 245 snakes into the mountains near Sequoia National
Forest. Just a mile past the tiny community of Badger is Baladullah.
A sign above the gate calls it Allah's City. Another nearby
advertises U-Haul rentals.</TE>
<TE>   Most residents here came from inner cities and are scraping by.
Some commute daily to jobs in nearby Visalia. Others are trying to
grow olive trees and raise chickens. Trailers are the only housing.</TE>
<TE>   The 440-acre parcel was once part of a 3,400-acre property owned
by Synanon, the communal drug rehabilitation program that achieved
notoriety for acts and threats of violence in the late 1970s and has
since closed.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Hurt, a Visalia attorney, was a member of Synanon. He says he
has handled a lot of legal work for Baladullah and Ghafur for free
because he feels they have been victimized since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a poor group of folks in the mountains escaping the
inner-city problems of drugs and violence," Hurt said.</TE>
<TE>   "They are very nice, peaceful, law-abiding citizens. I have taken
my wife and kids up there for picnics, and we have always had fun
there."</TE>
<TE>   Even before Sept 11, Baladullah had drawn law enforcement
scrutiny. A 20-year-old man from New York who had stayed briefly at
the Muslim retreat was arrested in the fatal shooting of a Fresno
County deputy sheriff.</TE>
<TE>   Then came Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "In the middle of all the controversy over the shooting, we had
9/11," Hurt said. "It was like throwing kerosene on a bonfire."</TE>
<TE>   "The media started doing stories painting Baladullah as a
terrorist camp," Hurt said. "But they didn't report the landing strip
is covered under with weeds and the firing range was built by Synanon
long ago. They shoot at the same old tin cans we used to shoot at."</TE>
<TE>   He has talked with one FBI agent looking into Baladullah, Hurt
said. He said the agent told him federal officials don't view the
place as any kind of terrorist threat.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so eerily similar to what happened to Synanon," Hurt said.</TE>
<TE>   "The media up here won't let it go."</TE>
<TE>   A Sheriff's Department spokeswoman in Tulare County, where
Baladullah is located, said officials have no reason to believe the
community poses any kind of terrorist or criminal threat.</TE>
<TE>   Ghafur says she met with the FBI at her own invitation shortly
after Sept. 11. The FBI declined to comment on its interest in
Baladullah.</TE>
<TE>   Many Teachers Are Working Without Pay</TE>
<TE>   Gay Taylor is a teacher at the Dakota Learning Center, one of the
four schools in Fresno run by the Gateway Academy. Before Gateway's
charter was revoked, she was getting paychecks. But lately she has
been working for free.</TE>
<TE>   So have most of the teachers at Gateway schools. Many of the
students were the kind who get lost in public schools. Charter
schools save a lot of them, Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   "The key word is nurture," Taylor said. "We are involved in their
lives. These kids need a lot of attention. We have foster kids here,
a lot of kids who would fall though the cracks if it wasn't for us.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the parents are keeping their children in the Gateway
schools," she said, "volunteering to fix hot lunches and help around
the schools where possible."</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to keep our family," said Tammy Williams, who has
three children at the Dakota school, a low-slung cluster of
comfortable classrooms on an old church property.</TE>
<TE>   Marie Davis, another parent, said her ninth-grade son has been
much happier and doing better in school since enrolling at Dakota.
She feels the decision to remove the school charter was political.</TE>
<TE>   "They make it look like this is a black Muslim school, but it
isn't," said Davis, who is white and Christian. "The kids here are of
all races. And we will fight until there's no breath left to keep
this school open."</TE>
<TE>   According to Jill Marmolejo, a spokeswoman for the Fresno school
board, Gateway received more than $1 million from the state to
operate its schools last year, but spent $2.5 million, falling
heavily into debt.</TE>
<TE>   "There was also a serious enrollment over-projection," Marmolejo
added. "They had 242 students last year, but projected 1,200. First
week in January, they submitted under 300 students. They were opening
and closing centers, not telling us."</TE>
<TE>   Officials say it became impossible to track Gateway's attendance
accurately. Gateway had 11 schools in the state at one point, the
four in Fresno and others in cities from Oakland to Compton.</TE>
<TE>   But it severed ties with some of them in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   Overall state funding, about $4,600 per student, is based on
verifiable attendance figures. Gateway now reports about 500
students.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Gateway failed to comply with state law in fingerprinting
new employees, Marmolejo said.</TE>
<TE>   "In California, you have to be fingerprinted to work in a school,"
Marmolejo said. "They listed a total of 162 employees at all the
schools, and 88 did not have fingerprints. They got negative reports
on two people and hired them anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the school board wanted to give them 30 days to
straighten things out," Marmolejo said. "But they argued it was all
our fault. They were defiant to the end."</TE>
<TE>   Lawsuit Filed Against Fresno School Board</TE>
<TE>   Gateway officials see their best chance for restoring the charter
in a federal lawsuit filed against the Fresno school board.</TE>
<TE>   "Charter schools fill a void public schools don't. Their motto is
no kid left behind," said Frank Muna, the lawyer who filed the suit.
"I don't think they are getting fair treatment here. If it was a
school run by whites, the school board would have bent over backward
to let them fix up their problems."</TE>
<TE>   That is not true, Fresno officials say. Marmolejo said Gateway
officials are trying to paint themselves as victims when they aren't.</TE>
<TE>   "That federal lawsuit is totally without merit," Marmolejo said.
"It's ridiculous to try to make the Fresno schools appear racist. We
have 101 different languages in our schools, and students of every
race. We took action against Gateway because of serious problems, not
for any other reason."</TE>
<TE>   The Anti-Defamation League didn't mince words in its Jan. 10
letter to the state Education Department:</TE>
<TE>   "There are indications that this school is linked to an Islamic
terrorist group and that the school has violated the 1st Amendment by
teaching religion in this state-funded school," wrote Jonathan
Bernstein, regional director for the ADL in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   He cited local news reports linking Ghafur to a group called
Muslims of the Americas, which Bernstein described as an Islamic
extremist group.</TE>
<TE>   That organization, Bernstein wrote, is linked to another group
called Al Fuqua. And that Islamic sect "seeks to purify Islam through
violence," the letter said.</TE>
<TE>   Bernstein added, "We urge you to investigate these allegations
seriously, and to immediately suspend funding to Gateway schools."</TE>
<TE>   Leader Describes 1960s Civil Rights Protests</TE>
<TE>   Ghafur said she believes the letter was part of a larger effort to
discredit Muslims in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a Zionist smear campaign against us," she said. Muslims
of the Americas "were at ground zero after the attacks, helping the
rescue effort."</TE>
<TE>   Ghafur was born and raised in Selma, Ala., she said. At 14 she was
arrested during a civil rights demonstration there. Police used dogs,
water hoses and tear gas on the demonstrators.</TE>
<TE>   "I was one of 29 teenage girls thrown into a cell with only toilet
water to drink," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview at the Gateway Academy's administration office in
a shabby downtown area of Fresno, Ghafur said she is associated with
Muslims of the Americas, but not Al Fuqua.</TE>
<TE>   "Al Fuqua doesn't even exist [anymore] that we know of," she said.
"It was a criminal branch of Islam. I certainly had no connection to
it.</TE>
<TE>   "I have been followed around and my life has been threatened since
Sept. 11," she said. "I was leaving the Fresno school district
building one day and a white guy drove by and shouted [using a racial
epithet], 'I'm going to wipe you off the face of the Earth!'"</TE>
<TE>   "All of it, everything that has happened, is because I am a strong
Muslim woman," Ghafur said. "We made arrangements to help Muslim
women in Bosnia, and I am also concerned about the issue of Kashmir,"
she said. "I have created enemies on a world and local scale."</TE>
<TE>   Gateway could have corrected its problems if the school board had
given it more time, she said, adding that the financial problems were
due largely to a state lag in reimbursing expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Still, she said, "I know we are going to stay open one way or
another. I did not drink that toilet water in Selma to come to Fresno
and be abused."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Assemblyman John Campbell (R-Irvine) introduced a bill Wednesday that
would extend private leases on state-owned oceanfront property to
fund restoration of the historic district.</LD>
<LD>   Leases for the 294 tenants of El Morro Village mobile home park
expire in 2004. Campbell's bill would extend them for five years and
raise rents to market value.</LD>
<LD>   That could bring in as much as $10 million to help pay for the
state's $15-million restoration of the 1920s-era beach colony,
Campbell said.</LD>
<TE>   Officials from the state Department of Parks and Recreation and
the California Coastal Commission oppose the plan, saying it would
allow a privileged few to enjoy public land.</TE>

<HD>Parra's Glide to Gold on Ice Began at Roller Rink</HD>
<DH>San Bernardino: Couple who run the facility where skater
started recall his dedication.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN BERNARDINO</DL>
<LD>Surging toward the Olympics, athletes ski, jump and skate for glory,
for fame, for riches. Derek Parra just wanted a Coke.</LD>
<LD>   That was 20 years ago, when he was 11, long before he dared dream
of the speedskating medals he won this week in Utah. Back then, Parra
spent his evenings at the Stardust Roller Rink here, just past the
tattoo parlors and the graffiti-covered sign for the Hair Masters
Universe of Beauty salon.</LD>
<LD>   He arrived each night with three bucks, enough to pay the $2.75
admission fee, but not enough for a soda, too. He skated for his
Coke--the prize awarded to any kid who skated two laps faster than
everybody else.</LD>
<TE>   Calling those beginnings humble is as much an understatement as
calling Parra--who switched from wheels to blades six years ago--an
overachiever. And San Bernardino, a city that could use a reason to
celebrate, is brimming with pride.</TE>
<TE>   In local schools this week, teachers showed videos of Parra's
races and fielded questions. Yes, they said, he is 5-foot-4, and yes,
he did trounce racers a foot taller. Yes, he's from right down the
road, over on Perris Street, where everybody still calls him D.D.,
for his full name, Derek Dwayne.</TE>
<TE>   In City Hall, the mayor's office was in a frenzy, planning for a
Tuesday parade and stadium rally. A local charter company had already
arranged to fly Parra to San Bernardino from Salt Lake City for the
event.</TE>
<TE>   It seemed the whole city suddenly wanted one of the "Team Parra"
sweatshirts his father had printed for some members of their large
family--Parra's aunt says at least 200 relatives live in Southern
California--to wear in support.</TE>
<TE>   Reminiscing About Winner's Youth</TE>
<TE>   At Roosevelt Elementary School, Parra's fifth-grade teacher, Jerry
Kasinski, pulled out a copy of an old class picture. There he is, the
local boy who made good, in the front row, wearing the same grin he
put on after this week's races.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the biggest thing to hit San Bernardino in quite a
while," said Kasinski, now the school principal. "He is a real
hometown hero. Everybody is looking at him as an inspiration--for
everybody, for the kids, for the city itself."</TE>
<TE>   Parra, 31, who now lives in the Orlando, Fla., area, captured the
silver medal last week in the men's 5,000-meter speedskating race,
then Tuesday topped the surprise victory with a world record that
stunned the field in the 1,500-meter race. The first Mexican American
to win an Olympic speedskating medal, he will try for a third medal
Friday in the 10,000-meter event.</TE>
<TE>   Back at the Stardust, George Cottone and his wife, Virginia,
seemed content Wednesday to sit and smile at each other, amazed by
their prodigy's success.</TE>
<TE>   "This is where it all began," said George Cottone, Parra's first
coach. "That is so cool."</TE>
<TE>   The couple have managed the Stardust for 28 years. Most weekends,
you can hear gunshots several blocks away, and the sign out front is
pocked from rocks thrown by passersby. Still, it is considered a
haven for local kids.</TE>
<TE>   Parra, whose father worked at a nearby youth correctional
institute, first began skating at the rink with his older brother,
back when roller-skates were all the rage. Eventually, friends
persuaded him to join a roller speedskating team, which George
Cottone coached, and he began competing a short time later, with
limited success.</TE>
<TE>   Cottone says Parra was always meticulous, rubbing his skates clean
after every race and packing them lovingly into his bag, just as he
has after his Olympic races. And he was always dedicated, sleeping
hard the night before his first national competition in 1985 while
teammates threw a party in the hotel room next door.</TE>
<TE>   "The other guys were just going to practice," Virginia Cottone
said. "And they were probably only going because there was a girl
there or something. Not Derek. Derek went to work."</TE>
<TE>   He evolved with the sport, moving from roller-skates to in-line
skates while still in his teens. He won world championships on
in-line skates, including a gold medal at the 1995 Pan Am Games. But
he knew in-line skating would not become an Olympic sport anytime
soon.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'If I'm even going to get a shot at the Olympics, I have
to go to the ice,' " George Cottone said.</TE>
<TE>   It was not an easy transition, and even his most ardent supporters
wince at the recollection of his first races on ice. But the pistons
that are his legs allowed him to qualify for the 1998 Olympic Games
in Nagano, though he was an alternate and did not race.</TE>
<TE>   He almost retired then, but decided to give it one more shot. He
left his wife, Tiffany, behind in Orlando and moved to Utah, where he
sold floor tile in a Home Depot and trained relentlessly.</TE>
<TE>   Star Surprises Coach and Father</TE>
<TE>   Folks knew he was good, thought he might have a shot at a medal.
But two? And a gold? And a world record? "Nobody anticipated this,"
Cottone said.</TE>
<TE>   That includes his father.</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert Parra, 55, who recently retired, was in Utah this week for
the races. On Wednesday he was loading his car, preparing to drive
home to San Bernardino to drop off some relatives who needed to
return to school and work.</TE>
<TE>   Today, he'll turn around and head back to catch Friday's race.
Between trips, he's prepared for a taste of the hometown frenzy.</TE>
<TE>   "He won't consider himself a hero. I know that," he said. "But I
will. He's my hero now. My son is my hero."</TE>
<TE>   The Cottones have spent much of this week reminiscing about
Parra's first days on skates--and about how much he has sacrificed.
Virginia Cottone remembered that Parra was invited to live in Florida
with a renowned in-line speedskating coach when he was 17, but didn't
have enough money to get there.</TE>
<TE>   "We were at nationals," she said. "After he skated he went into
the stands and started selling everything in his equipment bag--his
wheels, his boots, anything he could get money for. I said, 'What are
you doing? Why?' Now I know why. It was just another step. I've never
forgotten that."</TE>
<TE>   The Cottones sent Parra a card Wednesday. Tucked inside were two
things--a congratulatory message and two yellow tickets, the kind
that kids still race for at the Stardust.</TE>
<TE>   "Speed race winner," the tickets say. "Good for one free soft
drink."</TE>

<HD>Panel Signs Off on Land Swap, Putting Parks on the Hot Seat</HD>
<DH>Thousand Oaks: Deal would preserve Western Plateau while
opening Dos Vientos Ranch to more upscale building.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A week after two of its members were ousted for delaying a decision
on a complex land-swap deal, the Thousand Oaks Planning Commission
voted early Wednesday to support the plan to preserve nearly 200
acres of open space.</LD>
<LD>   In exchange for not building on a 191-acre site near Hill Canyon
known as the Western Plateau, its owner and two other developers
would be allowed to convert proposed senior and affordable housing
units in the upscale Dos Vientos Ranch neighborhood into more
profitable housing.</LD>
<LD>   "This entire project is excellent planning," said Jim Bruno, who
joined the 3-1 vote in favor of the plan. "Problems are in the eye of
the beholder."</LD>
<TE>   In a six-hour meeting that began Tuesday evening, Commissioner
Claudia Bill-de la Pena cast the sole vote against the deal, citing
legal concerns over zoning. Last week, then-commissioners Michael
Farris and Nora Aidukas also had voiced concerns about the legality
of the proposal. They were ousted by a divided City Council after
delaying a recommendation on the plateau deal.</TE>
<TE>   Farris was replaced by Forrest Frields, a former commissioner who
had supported elements of the Dos Vientos development in the past.
The council majority refused to replace Aidukas, an appointee of
Councilwoman Linda Parks, with any of the substitutes Parks
suggested. That position remains vacant.</TE>
<TE>   With a recommendation in place, the deal now goes to the City
Council for a vote on Tuesday. This places Parks, vying for a seat on
the Ventura County Board of Supervisors, in the position of having to
vote on the politically delicate land swap before the March 5
election.</TE>
<TE>   If Parks supports the deal, detractors may accuse her of assisting
developers, but to oppose the plan could hurt her reputation as a
protector of open space.</TE>
<TE>   Parks has not said how she will vote but said she is ready to make
a decision. Councilmen Andy Fox, Dennis Gillette and Dan Del Campo,
who voted to censure Parks and oust the two planning commissioners
for allegedly conspiring to stall the controversial deal, have
indicated they support the land swap.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Ed Masry's objection has been that the agreement fails to
provide new affordable housing for seniors. Fox said he hopes to nail
down, by next week's meeting, a guarantee from developers to build at
least 120 affordable apartment units elsewhere in the city.</TE>
<TE>   Parks' camp contends the deal cannot be approved without a vote of
the people, because a city ordinance gives residents say over
development on land zoned as open space. City land-use maps from the
1990s indicate that a sliver of the land that could hold houses under
the Western Plateau proposal is covered by that ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the city say those maps contained a printing error
that has since been corrected, and that the land in question never
fell under the growth restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics assert the plan is a giveaway to developers. Shapell
Industries has had development rights on the plateau for years but
never built there because of the prohibitive costs of land grading
and road building, opponents say. Shapell executives insist they will
develop the plateau if the deal is not approved.</TE>
<TE>   In a six-hour hearing that began Tuesday evening and ended shortly
after midnight, Bruno said the plateau deal is legal and urged
critics to drop opposition. But Bill-de la Pena said she could not
recommend the measure unless residents were guaranteed a chance to
vote on it.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely want to save the Western Plateau," she said. "[But]
there's always two sides to an issue, and that's why we have
attorneys."</TE>

<KH>SURROUNDINGS / NORTH HOLLYWOOD</KH>
<HD>Hidden Portrait of a City</HD>
<DH>Billed as the longest mural in the world, the half-mile
painting is due for a badly needed update and restoration.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FERRELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Unlike its Chinese counterpart, the Great Wall of Los Angeles is not
exactly a big-time tourist attraction.</LD>
<LD>   See it from the moon? It's tough enough to see from across the
street.</LD>
<LD>   The wall extends nearly half a mile through North Hollywood, on
the face of the Tujunga Wash flood control channel. It is obscured by
trees and chain-link fencing and is old only by Los Angeles
standards--completed in 1983. Yet the broad reach of history is
clearly apparent on what is billed as the world's longest mural.</LD>
<TE>   Bold, flowing images in the style of the great Mexican mural
masters illustrate how ethnic groups shaped the growth of
America--and California in particular.</TE>
<TE>   Rosa Parks and Albert Einstein are on the wall. So are Adolf
Hitler and Sen. Joseph McCarthy. The wall is a memorial to pain and
anger and war and ideas. It celebrates inventors, poets, film stars
and thousands whose names will never be recorded: deported Mexican
nationals, abused Native Americans, laid-off workers of the Great
Depression, coolie laborers and people of Japanese heritage
imprisoned in internment camps.</TE>
<TE>   It is a wall of tears and subtle humor. A scene devoted to the
boom of the suburbs shows a sprawl of blue-roofed homes and a phalanx
of trucks. "White's Moving," says the script on one truck--a bit of
social commentary that really was the name of a 1950s van company,
according to the wall's creator.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a pun I couldn't resist," says Judith F. Baca, founder of
SPARC, the Venice-based Social and Public Art Resource Center.</TE>
<TE>   The effort to paint the wall has an interesting history itself.
The nonprofit group organized more than 400 people--most of them
disadvantaged youths--to design and paint the landmark, a project
that took years and changed the lives of some of the teenagers
involved.</TE>
<TE>   The mural is 13 1/2 feet high and stretches 2,470 feet down one
side of the flood channel, along Coldwater Canyon Avenue. It extends
from Burbank Boulevard to Oxnard Street.</TE>
<TE>   No one has added to the wall, or even done touch-up work, for 19
years. Rain, high water and debris have dulled the paint and peeled
it in places. Worse, the mural's visual story--which begins with
saber-toothed cats and mastodons--stops abruptly with Olympic track
stars Wilma Rudolph and Billy Mills of the early 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   Omitted events include the Vietnam War, the Watts riots, the
assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther
King Jr., the Apollo moon landings and the fall of the Berlin Wall.</TE>
<TE>   Baca has been working on many fronts to salvage the mural and add
new expanses of art to make it current. The Los Angeles City Council
has committed $100,000 toward restoration. Meanwhile, designers are
sifting through thousands of ideas and images to come up with a
montage for each missing decade. Four 350-foot sections would extend
the wall more than a quarter-mile to the north.</TE>
<TE>   The brainstorming involves many people from many backgrounds and
fields of expertise. The designs are being roughed out by Baca's
mural students at UCLA. The students are contributing some of the
ideas; others are being cultivated in planning meetings with
professional artists, art scholars, historians and residents of
neighborhoods scattered around the city. The sparcmurals.org Web site
also invites suggestions for the wall.</TE>
<TE>   Responses have been informative and often surprising, Baca says.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone sent us an image of Michael Jackson as a white guy with a
monkey in his lap," Baca says, referring to a depiction of the pop
singer made famous by sculptor Jeff Koons. That image, if it is used,
would offer a nod to the singer and commercial artist as symbols of
the crass materialism of the 1990s, Baca says.</TE>
<TE>   "It's smart stuff, by people who know the art world," she says.
"My favorite one for the 1990s is a guy dressed up as an Aztec
warrior--the face of an Aztec warrior in full costume--and on his
back is a leaf blower."</TE>
<TE>   Highly stylized, the warrior is shown in luminous profile, a
rendering submitted to the Web site by a man named Serg Hernandez. He
also supplied a caption: "A once-proud Aztec people now works as
gardeners blowing leaf and grass."</TE>
<TE>   Creating the right weave of metaphors is crucial and
time-consuming. Although the design work began in the fall of 2000,
funded by $208,000 in grants from the Ford and Rockefeller
foundations, only small sections of the future wall have been pieced
together. Some of the images are posted on SPARC's Web site; others
exist only on the computer screens of the designers.</TE>
<TE>   Looking at them is a fascinating glimpse at history as it was and
art as it will be. The rendering of the 1960s, for example, shows
blacks at a whites-only lunch counter. Fire hoses spray racial
demonstrators in Birmingham, Ala. The water flows into a stream that
irrigates a field. The stream then morphs into a line of people
following farm labor leader Cesar Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   The 1970s design is largely incomplete. The section dealing with
the 1980s shows the AIDS quilt and President Ronald Reagan
half-hidden behind a mask of himself--a commentary on Reagan's
adroitness with the media.</TE>
<TE>   Missiles overhead suggest the heightened military armament of the
Reagan years. A deeper part of the sky is lighted with the exploding
space shuttle Challenger.</TE>
<TE>   The 1990s art is even more striking: a Los Angeles cityscape
vibrant with global themes. Fires mark the burning oil fields of the
Persian Gulf War as well as the 1992 riots.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the World Trade Center should be the final image," Baca
says, but designers are not that far along.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For the seventh year in a row, El Camino Real High School in Woodland
Hills won first place in the Los Angeles Unified School District's
Academic Decathlon, the team learned at a banquet Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   North Hollywood and Palisades Charter high schools took second and
third place in the district competition, which ended 18 days ago with
the Super Quiz. They will compete with El Camino and other schools in
the California Academic Decathlon on March 22-23 in Modesto.</LD>
<LD>   Other Los Angeles Unified teams that scored high enough to earn
wild-card bids at the decathlon were from Venice, Reseda, Los
Angeles, Marshall, Garfield and San Pedro highs.</LD>
<TE>   Wednesday's banquet, held at the downtown Westin Bonaventure
hotel, usually takes place a week after the Super Quiz. But problems
booking the banquet hall forced the announcements to be pushed back.</TE>
<TE>   Sixty high schools participated in the district's academic
decathlon this year. The intense competition challenges teams of nine
students on a variety of subjects, from math to music.</TE>
<TE>   The winner of the state competition will go to the national event
April 10-11 in Phoenix.</TE>

<HD>Shining a Spotlight on Segregated Past</HD>
<DH>Education: An actor brings to life for young students
scenes from Richard Wright's autobiography, set in South of the
1920s.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Their English teachers have been saying it all along: Words really
can come to life in books.</LD>
<LD>   But it took an actor performing a one-man play based on excerpts
from Richard Wright's anguished autobiographical novel "Black Boy" to
prove it Wednesday to 100 teenagers at the Los Angeles Central
Library.</LD>
<LD>   Actor Michael Phillip Edwards portrayed Wright, whose sense of
alienation generated a book that gave voice to other blacks living in
the segregated South in the 1920s and '30s.</LD>
<TE>   The unusual production was staged without charge by a privately
financed group called Literature to Life. The emotion-filled reading,
viewed by students from Marshall High School in the Los Feliz area
and Dana Middle School in San Pedro, was part of a Black History
Month series that is exposing Wright's work to more than 6,500 Los
Angeles-area youngsters.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards, 34, of Culver City is best-known for television and
theatrical film work. His own autobiographical one-man show, "Runt,"
will soon be released in film version as well.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Edwards kept his young audience riveted as he
depicted Wright discovering prejudice for the first time and--years
later in his life--discovering the power of the written word.</TE>
<TE>   It was a book by H.L. Mencken that packed the punch for Wright.
Using dialogue from "Black Boy," Edwards as Wright spoke softly at
first from the library's Taper Theater stage.</TE>
<TE>   "This man is fighting, fighting with words. He uses words as a
weapon, uses them like a club. Could words be weapons? Yes. Here they
are. Maybe I could use them," Edwards intoned, his voice rising.</TE>
<TE>   The teenagers erupted with applause at the end of Edwards'
45-minute show. And they were eager to participate when performance
coordinators Debra Piver and Pesha Rudnick invited some of them to
the stage to discuss various forms of "hunger"--hunger for food, for
racial identity, for books--expressed in Wright's work.</TE>
<TE>   The two actresses distributed paper and pens to the teens and
invited them to sit onstage as they wrote of books, places and people
who had opened their eyes. The two-hour program ended with Edwards
returning to the stage to answer questions.</TE>
<TE>   The Beverly Hills family that underwrites the annual $175,000 cost
of Literature to Life productions wishes to remain anonymous, said
Piver, 41, of Los Feliz. Four shows, each with about 15 performances,
are staged at the library and two local theaters.</TE>
<TE>   Youngsters from Jordan High School and Emerson and Nightingale
middle schools will attend Friday's final "Black Boy" performance.
There are audience openings for this school year's remaining shows,
"The Color of Water" and "I Love America," said Rudnick, 28, of
Venice.</TE>
<TE>   Those in Wednesday's audience praised Edwards. And Wright.</TE>
<TE>   "I got caught up in it. I'd like to read the book," said Daniel
Buchan, 13, of San Pedro.</TE>
<TE>   Toni Adams, 17, of Atwater Village said she has read Wright's
book. But many of her high school classmates have not.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw a few shocked faces around me here," she said. "Most of us
these days don't really see segregation or racial oppression."</TE>
<TE>   Marshall High drama and language teacher Jill Diamond predicted
Wednesday's show would have a ripple effect on campus.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope they go back and tell their English teachers, 'We want to
read this,'" she said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge Wednesday lifted an injunction
against 18th Street gang members in the Pico-Union area at the
request of city and county prosecutors who said the Rampart police
corruption scandal had cast doubt on its validity.</LD>
<LD>   "With all that's happened in the last few years and the stigma
that's surrounding that whole time frame, it just seemed better that
we go ahead and dismiss," said Deputy City Atty. Kelly Huynh. The
1997 injunction, which prohibited the gang members from associating
in public, was temporarily suspended in September 1999, shortly after
the Rampart scandal broke. The order by Judge Rodney Nelson formally
dissolves it.</LD>

<LD>We who live in Northern California were warned there'd be times like
this--times when the former mayor of Los Angeles would act goofy.</LD>
<LD>   Just does things that are kinda goofy, muttered longtime observers
of Richard Riordan, the limping front-runner for the Republican
gubernatorial nomination.</LD>
<LD>   I used to dismiss such talk. After all, Ronald Reagan sometimes
acted goofy, but he endeared himself to voters.</LD>
<TE>   Clearly, however, Riordan is no Reagan. He does exude warmth, like
an old Irish setter. But he's no Great Communicator. Unlike Reagan,
Riordan often wanders off his message.</TE>
<TE>   Like in a debate when he says that former Gov. George Deukmejian
only remembers "grudges." When he screams at a Times reporter to
"just get out of here"--off a moving campaign bus. When he confuses
"fiberglass" with "fiber-optics."</TE>
<TE>   Small stuff, I say. Where is he on the big issues? What kind of
governor would he be?</TE>
<TE>   Then on Monday, Riordan did exhibit certifiable goofiness. He
vowed at a campaign stop in Studio City that, if elected, he'd refuse
to meet with lobbyists and wouldn't allow his staff to meet with them
either.</TE>
<TE>   It could be that the candidate was being demagogic. Or perhaps he
was just naive. Likely, it was both.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This is what Riordan told reporters, in part:</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to charge $100,000 to lobbyists to come in my
office as Gray Davis does. Nor anything. I just won't let them in the
office."</TE>
<TE>   (An "absurd" comment, says Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio.)</TE>
<TE>   "Look at my record.... The lobbyists essentially gave up trying to
lobby the mayor's office....</TE>
<TE>   "I want [aides] to independently make up their mind as to what's
in the best interests of the state, not how much money I can get out
of the [lobbyist]. Nobody is going to buy Dick Riordan....</TE>
<TE>   "I think you can get experts to advise you on all kinds of things
without being educated by the lobbyists because they're going to spin
it towards their client....</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line, it will be a policy in my office not to talk to
lobbyists."</TE>
<TE>   Where to begin? Let's start with this: Lobbyists are as vital to
American democracy as are the three branches of government. They're
about the 1st Amendment "right of the people peaceably to assemble,
and to petition the government for a redress of grievances."</TE>
<TE>   It's basic civics: The people of California cannot all assemble in
Sacramento. So they organize--whether they realize it or not--into
special-interest groups to petition the government. Groups ranging
from fertilizer manufacturers to fly fishermen, from developers to
duck lovers, from truckers to teachers.</TE>
<TE>   "Guys who drive trucks for a living ought to be able to hire
somebody to articulate their position against college professors,"
notes veteran lobbyist George Steffes.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're trying to keep out the corruption of money, that's a
different issue than 'talking to lobbyists.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Corruption is caused by special-interest donations to politicians'
election campaigns. If the public believes the influence of private
money on state politicians needs to be reduced, it must spend its own
tax dollars on campaigns. Either special interests buy politicians,
or the public does.</TE>
<TE>   But either way, there'll be lobbyists. They're not the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "Riordan's being disingenuous," asserts Secretary of State Bill
Jones, an underdog Republican rival. He says Riordan appointed seven
registered lobbyists to jobs in his mayoral administration. The city
of Los Angeles employs five lobbyists in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   At last count, there were 2,176 lobbyist employers and 1,126
lobbyists here. They pack the Capitol, some lobbying for several
interests.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan could keep his staffers sequestered for four years and
they'd never have to speak to one. But then they'd be ignorant about
policy options and public desires.</TE>
<TE>   I called Alan Watahara, lobbyist for the California Children's
Lobby. He noted that Riordan's wife, Nancy Daly, is a strong
advocate--lobbyist?--for children's causes.</TE>
<TE>   "If the mayor were to think about this," Watahara says, "he would
hold court with lobbyists. Meet with us on a regular basis."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan's a bicycling fanatic. Too bad he can't chat with the
lobbyist for the California Bicycle Coalition. She's Aimee Rutledge,
a moderate Republican, mother of two--his kind of voter.</TE>
<TE>   "I was hoping to get Riordan out on my new triple bike," she says.
"Too bad. It's kind of cool. It's racy. It's red. If he's elected,
he'll see it parked outside the Capitol. I use it to drop the kids
off, then go to work."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor, get on the bike with the lobbyist. It'd be a little goofy.
But goofy-endearing.</TE>

<HD>Builder to Be Fined for Runoff</HD>
<DH>Pollution: The developer let tainted water flow into
creeks, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State regulators this week said they will levy a $422,000 fine
against one of the Inland Empire's most prominent and controversial
developers for allowing storm water and pollutants to spill from a
construction site at Vail Lake into nearby creeks.</LD>
<LD>   The developer, Bill Johnson, who owns a limited liability
corporation with ambitious plans to expand the Temecula-area wine
country on the shores of Vail Lake, said he plans to appeal the fine.
It was levied by the California Regional Water Quality Control
Board's San Diego region, which includes part of Riverside County.</LD>
<LD>   According to board documents released Tuesday, Johnson's
construction team failed in 1999, 2000 and 2001 to develop a
pollution control plan that would contain sediment and pollutants
from the construction site.</LD>
<TE>   Not only did Johnson fail to contain storm-water runoff and
pollutants caused by erosion and grading, the documents say, but he
also placed bales of hay along some of his newly graded roads, which
effectively acted as a funnel for storm-water runoff, increasing the
possibility of damage to the environment and small nearby creeks.</TE>
<TE>   Fines of nearly $875,000 were levied by the same board late last
year in connection with two other Temecula-area developments. "Those
were largely paperwork issues," Johnson said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   He said the board's contention that he was preparing to build
homes on the shores of Vail Lake is wrong. He said he was merely
clearing ground for new vineyards and olive groves. Johnson said,
however, that he hopes to eventually build a swath of "estates" on
the shores of the lake.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said some of the clearing was intended to cut down on the
possibility of a fire at the site.</TE>
<TE>   "The contention that this was an industrial subdivision is simply
wrong," he said. "I think the board has a misperception here."</TE>
<TE>   Environmental advocates and many residents in southern Riverside
County consider Vail Lake an ecological gem.</TE>
<TE>   It was established by relatives of rancher Walter Vail in the
1940s, then purchased by Johnson after government officials failed to
raise the $20 million necessary to turn it into a preserve for
endangered species.</TE>
<TE>   Art Coe, assistant executive officer of the Water Quality Control
Board, said an appeal of the Vail Lake fine must be filed within 30
days, and would be heard by the State Water Resources Control Board
in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the fines, which regulators say are substantial for this
type of a case, residents in the ballooning Temecula area were less
than optimistic Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Kerry Mayer, a retiree who lives west of Temecula, said Johnson,
who has bought and sold more than 90,000 acres of real estate in the
area since 1973, will treat the fine as "the cost of doing business."</TE>

<HD>Judge's Porn Case Hinges on Hacker</HD>
<DH>Courts: Defense attacks the credibility of the Canadian man
who says he accessed images on the Orange County jurist's computer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A mysterious Canadian computer hacker who allegedly stole an
electronic diary purporting to detail the sexual fantasies of an
Orange County judge admitted to authorities that he's hacked into
thousands of other computers, according to a police affidavit made
public this week.</LD>
<LD>   The hacker's credibility--and whether he worked on behalf of
authorities--is emerging as a central question in the case against
Judge Ronald C. Kline, who stands accused of downloading child
pornography to his home and courthouse computers.</LD>
<LD>   The hacker worked with Canadian police on at least one
high-profile child porn case, the police affidavits said, but he was
also under investigation by the U.S. Customs Bureau for possessing
pornography.</LD>
<TE>   The hacker, who was not named in the affidavit, describes himself
as a "predator hunter" who accessed a diary and pornographic images
on Kline's computer, which was eventually turned over to authorities
last summer, the affidavit states.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine detectives and federal agents used the hacker's evidence to
obtain a search warrant of Kline's home and courthouse computers.</TE>
<TE>   The search unearthed more than 100 images of photographs showing
young boys engaged in sex acts.</TE>
<TE>   Possible Police Ties Could Affect Evidence</TE>
<TE>   But in their latest court filings, Kline's defense attorneys
attacked the hacker's credibility, saying that taking the judge's
diary was illegal and suggesting that the hacker was working on
behalf of law enforcement at the time.</TE>
<TE>   If a judge agrees that the hacker was indeed a police agent, the
computer evidence could well be thrown out of court.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys also raised the possibility that the hacker
could have doctored the diary and computer images that form the
bedrock of federal prosecutors' case against Kline.</TE>
<TE>   "A person who can" hack, wrote attorney Paul S. Meyer in the court
papers filed last week, "can also enter a personal computer secretly
and alter its contents and add materials not previously present."</TE>
<TE>   The latest filings offer the best portrait yet of the shadowy
figure whose computer work ultimately led to last November's federal
grand jury indictment of Kline, who also faces separate state child
molestation charges.</TE>
<TE>   Kline has pleaded not guilty to the federal charges and is running
for reelection on the March 5 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine police learned about the hacker's infiltration of the
judge's computer from Julie Posey, founder of the Colorado-based
Internet watchdog group, Pedowatch, which received an anonymous tip
along with Kline's diary from the hacker.</TE>
<TE>   The hacker, the affidavit says, told Posey he was working as an
informant for customs agents.</TE>
<TE>   The computer diary detailed intimate thoughts that the author
described about boys he met at an Orange County Little League
baseball club, particularly about one 13-year-old player.</TE>
<TE>   "I gave a lot of thought today about this business of approaching
these kids too fast," the diary says, according to the affidavit.
"You have to make them come to you or it doesn't work."</TE>
<TE>   Canadian Authorities Help Locate Hacker</TE>
<TE>   After receiving the diary, Irvine detectives were left with the
task of trying to track down the hacker, documents show. They finally
found him, even though the anonymous tipster did his best to hide his
tracks.</TE>
<TE>   The hacker did not return e-mails from investigators. Customs
officials served a summons for information from the company that
provided the hacker with an e-mail account. But the address turned
out to be phony.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Det. Ron Carr eventually discovered a Web site the hacker
was operating. He called Vancouver police to help contact the company
that owned the site.</TE>
<TE>   But the Canadian police said they actually knew all about the
operator of the site, who turned out to be the hacker Carr was
searching for.</TE>
<TE>   The hacker, the Royal Canadian Mountain Police told Carr, was
"essential in the apprehension" two years ago of a father suspected
of offering his 8-year-old daughter for sex over the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Canadian authorities told Carr that the hacker, who allegedly
possessed "large quantities of child pornography," was no longer
working as an informant, according to the court documents.</TE>
<TE>   But the hacker had recently been on the other end of an
investigation. Customs agents told Carr that the hacker was
considered a suspect in at least one federal child pornography
investigation last year, the records state, though they provide no
other details about the case.</TE>
<TE>   In August, Carr and a customs agent flew to Langley, Canada--a
small town just outside Vancouver--to interview the hacker.</TE>
<TE>   There, he told the officers how he created a virus to infect the
computers of suspected traders in kiddie porn.</TE>
<TE>   The virus allowed him to examine the contents of each machine he
infected. Between 2,000 and 3,000 computers worldwide had been
infiltrated by the virus, he told the officers.</TE>
<TE>   The hacker described his virus as "the Trojan Horse" because it is
attached to an Internet file that is downloaded onto the computer.</TE>

<HD>Grover Krantz, 70; Bigfoot Researcher</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HYMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Over the years, Grover Krantz would sometimes climb into his car at
night and go for long, lonely rides into the woods of the Pacific
Northwest. Creeping along the back roads at 25 mph with a rifle and
spotlight at his side, he desperately hoped his elusive quarry, a
sasquatch, would show itself.</LD>
<LD>   But it never did. Not once in more than 30 years of looking.</LD>
<LD>   Krantz, considered one of the world's foremost authorities on the
supposed apelike denizen of the Northwest's forests, died Feb. 14 of
pancreatic cancer in Port Angeles, Wash. He was 70.</LD>
<TE>   Krantz was unique because of his credentials. A longtime physical
anthropologist at Washington State University in Pullman, he
approached Bigfoot not as a joke but as a scientific problem that
needed to be solved--even if it meant shooting one down.</TE>
<TE>   What perplexed and even maddened colleagues but delighted Bigfoot
enthusiasts was that Krantz was a legitimate academic.</TE>
<TE>   He was a respected lecturer and expert on human evolution, with
dozens of peer-reviewed papers to his credit, as well as a book
titled "Big Footprints: A Scientific Inquiry into the Reality of
Sasquatch."</TE>
<TE>   "I think the more criticism he got on [Bigfoot], the harder he dug
in his heels," said Don Tyler, a former student of Krantz's and the
head of the anthropology department at the University of Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   "He thought he was approaching this thing in the correct way, as a
scientific problem. But many professors considered it a topic that
was not appropriate to be studied."</TE>
<TE>   Krantz was born in 1931 in Salt Lake City, and as a child became
fascinated with the skeletal remains of animals he found. His
interests led him to the field of anthropology, a subject he began
teaching at Washington State in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   Although Krantz had heard the story of Bigfoot as a teenager, he
remained skeptical until he was called in 1970 to look at alleged
Bigfoot tracks in northeast Washington. Expecting to find an obvious
hoax, Krantz thought the footprints were too sophisticated to be fake
because one of the feet showed a crippling bone injury.</TE>
<TE>   As the years passed, Krantz interviewed hundreds of people who
said they had encountered a Bigfoot in the region. He also did a
frame-by-frame analysis of the famous short film, allegedly of a
Bigfoot, made by Roger Patterson in 1967 in Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   Krantz thought the images were legitimate. Others thought they
were the product of an uninspired stunt featuring a man in a monkey
suit.</TE>
<TE>   Using casts of footprints, films, witness encounters and his
knowledge of human evolution, Krantz developed an elaborate natural
history of the sasquatch.</TE>
<TE>   In his view, there were about 2,000 still living in North America.
An adult male stood about 8 feet, weighed 800 pounds and had feet
twice the size of a human foot. They had probably migrated over the
Bering Land Strait to the continent. They were nocturnal and shy. As
with bears, their diets consisted of carrion, berries and vegetation.</TE>
<TE>   When asked by a magazine writer why sasquatch remains were never
found, Krantz replied:</TE>
<TE>   "Well, that's the annoying part. Although we found jaws and teeth
in China from what I guess to be sasquatch's ancestor, we have
nothing in North America. But this is probably because, first, it's a
rare animal and, second, it has no natural predators, so they die
slowly and creep off and hide. Bears do this. Practically the only
bear specimens we have in museums had to be shot by somebody."</TE>
<TE>   Krantz, not surprisingly, was eagerly sought by reporters because
of his willingness to talk on the record about a creature more apt to
be seen in the National Enquirer than National Geographic.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, he was frequently quoted as being an avid
supporter of shooting a Bigfoot--he felt a body was needed to prove
sasquatch was real. Besides the usual trouble such talk stirred up at
Washington State, even local environmentalists took umbrage at Krantz
for advocating the killing of what was presumably an endangered
species.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Lipe, a professor emeritus of anthropology at Washington
State, was a longtime colleague of Krantz's.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a person who liked to take on controversial issues in his
own field of physical anthropology, and he was willing to look at
things that other people in his field wouldn't look at," said Lipe.
"He wrote an early paper on the influence of language on human
evolution that was way ahead of its time. He said he liked to take on
an underdog hypothesis and make it credible, and, of course, the
sasquatch hypothesis is an underdog."</TE>
<TE>   Although his sasquatch work was largely dismissed by academics,
Krantz was embraced by those who believed in Bigfoot and others who
simply liked the idea that such a large species could persist in the
modern world.</TE>
<TE>   This was particularly true in Willow Creek, a tiny village in the
Trinity Alps range of Northern California. The Patterson film was
apparently shot nearby, and the town has a Bigfoot museum and an
annual Bigfoot festival.</TE>
<TE>   Al Hodgson, 78, has lived in the area since 1933 and works at the
museum. He says Krantz's legacy is the ability to cast aside
preconceived notions and believe in something that so many find
unbelievable.</TE>
<TE>   "I know about a dozen people who have seen a Bigfoot up here but
are so afraid they're going to be laughed at they don't do anything,"
Hodgson said. "But Grover and others really helped legitimize
Bigfoot, while the people who tried to do otherwise have really
failed miserably."</TE>
<TE>   Krantz is survived by his wife, Diane Horton, and a stepson.</TE>

<HD>Lucille Lund, 89; Actress in Cult Horror Movie</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lucille Lund, who achieved minor cult status for her dual roles in
"The Black Cat," a 1934 horror classic that paired Boris Karloff and
Bela Lugosi for the first time, has died. She was 89.</LD>
<LD>   Lund, who signed with Universal in 1933 after winning the studio's
nationwide beauty and talent contest, died of natural causes Saturday
in Torrance. She lived in Palos Verdes Estates.</LD>
<LD>   Lund's short-lived Hollywood career--about 30 films between 1933
and 1939--was not much different than that of many young actresses of
the time: a mix of largely forgettable crime dramas, westerns,
serials and Three Stooges and Charley Chase comedy shorts.</LD>
<TE>   But her role in "The Black Cat" gave her Hollywood career an
unexpected afterlife among a later generation of horror film fans.</TE>
<TE>   Lund played the doomed Karen, who is first seen under the satin
sheets of a satanic high priest played by Karloff, who is not only
her bridegroom in the film but her stepfather.</TE>
<TE>   With her long, flowing blond hair and black negligee trailing to
the floor, "she looks like Rapunzel after a shopping spree at
Frederick's of Hollywood," Gregory William Mank wrote in his 1999
book "Women in Horror Films, 1930s."</TE>
<TE>   Lund's character winds up being slain by Karloff in the 65-minute
melodrama, "doomed to his 'embalming rack,'" Mank wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Lund also plays her character's mummified dead mother, hanging by
her blond hair in a vertical glass coffin, which provided Lund with
her own on-set horror.</TE>
<TE>   The only way she could get out of the coffin was if someone lifted
her out, and while the scene was being shot, the director called for
a lunch break--and left her hanging for an hour.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't get out," Lund told Mank. "I couldn't do anything.
Everybody thought somebody else was going to get me out, but nobody
took me out."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Buckley, Wash., to Norwegian immigrant parents, Lund began
her theatrical career as a child, playing in stock with the Henry
Duffy Players in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   While studying drama at Northwestern University, someone suggested
she send her picture to a beauty and talent contest sponsored by
Universal Studios. She won "The All-American Girl" contest, beating
out 1,200 other contestants, and took the train to Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   She made her film debut in "Saturday's Millions," a 1933 Universal
football saga starring Robert Young, followed by "Horseplay," a
slapstick comedy starring Slim Summerville.</TE>
<TE>   In 1934, she played the heroine in a 12-chapter cliffhanger called
"Pirate Treasure" and appeared in four other films.</TE>
<TE>   In 1937, Lund married radio producer-writer Kenneth Higgins and,
after the birth of her two daughters, quit the business in 1939.</TE>
<TE>   Although she made some television commercials in her 50s, she
remained out of the spotlight until the early 1990s, when she was
invited to be a guest at the Memphis Film Festival. Invitations to
other festivals followed.</TE>
<TE>   Still vivacious in her 80s, an amused Lund thanked a ballroom full
of film fans in 1995 for their ovation.</TE>
<TE>   "I really think the reason you all remember me," she said with a
smile, "is because I went to bed with Boris Karloff."</TE>
<TE>   She is survived by her daughters, Terry Helmy of Torrance and Kim
Lund Rosenfield of Palos Verdes Estates; three grandchildren and two
great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Veterinarian Says He Warned That Dogs Constituted a Danger</HD>
<DH>Trial: Witness in fatal mauling case says he wrote a
cautionary letter to one of the owners 10 months before the attack.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A veterinarian testified Wednesday that he warned an owner of two
Presa Canario dogs of their violent nature 10 months before the
animals mauled a San Francisco woman to death.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Donald Martin, testifying in the trial of two dog owners
charged in connection with the fatal mauling, told jurors that for
the first time in his 49 years of practice, he felt compelled to
write a letter about the possibility of the dogs' hurting someone.</LD>
<LD>   In the letter, Martin said the dogs, each of which weighed more
than 100 pounds, were difficult to vaccinate, had not been trained
and would be a liability in any household.</LD>
<TE>   "I felt concerned," the veterinarian told jurors in Los Angeles
Superior Court. "I felt that these dogs had a potential of being very
serious."</TE>
<TE>   Martin said the dogs were massive and aggressive, adding, "These
dogs could do bodily damage."</TE>
<TE>   But defense attorneys suggested in their cross-examination that
the dogs, Bane and Hera, were merely rambunctious because they had
been chained and confined by their previous owner, Janet Coumbs.</TE>
<TE>   The dogs attacked and killed Diane Whipple, a 33-year-old lacrosse
coach, outside her Pacific Heights apartment door in January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The dogs' owners, Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel, both
attorneys, face charges of involuntary manslaughter and keeping a
mischievous dog. Knoller also faces a charge of second-degree murder
because she was in the apartment hallway when Whipple was attacked.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors argue that Knoller and Noel ignored more than two
dozen warnings and prior incidents. The dogs had bitten or lunged at
several other people, including Whipple, prosecutors said during
opening statements Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys, however, maintain that the attack on Whipple
was unexpected and could not have been prevented. Knoller's attorney
said her client risked her life trying to save Whipple during the
attack.</TE>
<TE>   Coumbs, a Northern California woman who kept the dogs on her farm
until April 2000, also testified Wednesday that she told Knoller and
Noel that the dogs weren't safe. They tore through fences, broke free
of chains and destroyed dog houses on her four-acre farm, Coumbs
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a nightmare," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Coumbs testified that she told the couple that Hera had killed her
chickens, sheep and a cat and should have been destroyed. But she
admitted feeling that, despite his behavior, the other dog, Bane, was
a part of her family.</TE>
<TE>   The dogs were put to death after the fatal mauling.</TE>
<TE>   Coumbs testified that she bred and raised the dogs at the urging
of a state prison inmate she befriended. She told jurors that the
inmate, Paul Schneider, suggested she buy the dogs, breed them and
sell the pups to make money.</TE>
<TE>   Coumbs said she didn't know that Schneider was considered a member
of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang or that he had allegedly set up
a Web site advertising the killer dogs.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say the two defendants are associates of the white
supremacist gang and participated in the scheme to breed, raise and
train the dogs.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after Coumbs obtained the dogs, she testified, Schneider
became angry at her for not sending enough pictures and for making
"wusses" of them.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller and Noel took the dogs to their San Francisco apartment as
a result of a lawsuit, and later adopted Schneider as their son.</TE>
<TE>   Coumbs is now in the witness protection program.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Math Teachers Plead Guilty to Having Sex With 2 Students</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former mathematics teacher at a Pasadena high school will receive a
prison term and another teacher will be sentenced to probation after
both pleaded guilty to having sex with students.</LD>
<LD>   Cyrus Javaheri, 41, the former head of the math department at John
Muir High School, pleaded guilty to two felony counts of oral
copulation and two counts of unlawful intercourse with two girl
students, who were 17 at the time.</LD>
<LD>   He will probably be sentenced to 16 months in prison, prosecutor
Natalie Adomian said.</LD>
<TE>   Tina Dezerne, 30, another former math teacher, pleaded guilty to
one count of oral copulation with one of the students. She is
expected to be sentenced to three years' probation and 240 hours of
community service. Under the terms of the agreement, both teachers
will have to register as sex offenders in California.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Nardoni, Javaheri's attorney, said his client maintains
that one girl was 18 and the other said she was not a minor.</TE>
<TE>   "But sometimes in life," Nardoni said, "there are standards and
general public attitudes that are even higher than the law. I don't
think that there's a jury on the face of the Earth that would condone
his behavior, even if the girls were 18."</TE>
<TE>   Javaheri and Dezerne have been on unpaid leave from the Pasadena
Unified School District since the allegations surfaced in January
2001.</TE>

<LD>First, some glad tidings out of Cypress. The Los Alamitos
News-Enterprise reports that the resident who saw a plane that was in
the act of crashing had actually seen "a large kite."</LD>
<LD>   An unmanned kite.</LD>
<LD>   This lack of perspective reminded me of a couple of years ago when
a resident told Seal Beach police he had spotted a heavily damaged
pink Corvette being pounded by waves near the pier.</LD>
<TE>   It turned out this resident had been trying out a new high-powered
telescope and hadn't quite mastered it. The stranded car was a Barbie
toy.</TE>
<TE>   Back on dry land: How health-conscious is Southern California? Dan
Fink of L.A. noticed a parking area at a local university where even
the vans are expected to be physically fit (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   What irritates me, though, are un-athletic vehicles--the ones that
can't come to a stop when a light is turning red.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Jeff of Lomita came upon the placard of someone who agrees
with me (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   More car talk: Diane Fradin of L.A. found a product containing a
type of wax that is used to make vehicles shiny. Strange thing is,
she found it on a bottle of cold medicine (see accompanying). It is
an "inactive ingredient," so it probably won't make you shine.</TE>
<TE>   Food for thought: You might need a pain reliever after tasting the
cheese discovered by Elizabeth Johnston of Chatsworth (see
accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Read all about it: I'm sure you went around with a smile on your
face all day after learning that the county Board of Supervisors had
given the L.A. Press Club a plaque for "more than 50 years of
service."</TE>
<TE>   If you're wondering why the supes were a bit vague about the time
frame, you should know that the club has had an erratic history,
having written its own obituary at least twice over the last century.</TE>
<TE>   During Prohibition, for instance, the L.A. Press Club flourished
as a meeting place where news hounds could guzzle the contraband beer
and whiskey obtained by reporters who had accompanied the cops on
raids of bootleggers.</TE>
<TE>   Then, one day, a drunken reporter was thrown off the premises of
the Press Club. Outraged, he phoned police, revealed the illicit
goings-on there and demanded that the place be raided. The gendarmes,
who were shocked (shocked!), did, with some reluctance. And that was
the end of the press club until it was reorganized in 1947.</TE>
<TE>   So the drunken reporter got his revenge. Whether he also phoned
his newspaper and got a scoop about the raid is not known.</TE>
<TE>   Note to radio station KXTA: With the tendency of UCLA's basketball
team to suffer unexpected defeats, maybe you folks at 1150 (AM)
should rename the team's radio show. The current name, "Bruin
Breakdown," has taken on a new meaning.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Less than 5 inches of rain have fallen in these parts
since July, making this one of the driest periods in years. And I'll
take the blame. You see, several months ago I did something that
ensured the rain would stop. I had a new roof put on our house.</TE>

<HD>PG&amp;E Criticizes State's Reorganization Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>TIM REITERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. on Wednesday attacked a state plan for
reorganizing the bankrupt utility, saying that it is fatally flawed
and distorts the company's finances by at least $4.5 billion.</LD>
<LD>   In a filing with federal Bankruptcy Court, PG&amp;E said the plan
outlined by the Public Utilities Commission would fail to restore the
company to creditworthy status. Officials warned that the company
could not resume power procurement for its customers for years--and
that the state would have to continue buying power for them.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Dennis Montali is scheduled to hear arguments Wednesday on
whether the commission's proposal is credible and should be
considered as an alternative to PG&amp;E's plan.</LD>
<TE>   Both plans say PG&amp;E's $13.5 billion in debt would be repaid and
the company would be restored to financial health. PG&amp;E's blueprint
would move its generation and transmission assets beyond the state's
regulatory reach to new subsidiaries of its parent company. The
commission's plan would utilize a projected $6.1 billion in cash and
would suspend dividends for three years and require shareholders to
pay $1.6 billion more.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E argued in its filing that the commission plan overstates
available cash by more than $2 billion by failing to account for
taxes, necessary capital expenditures and interest payments. And the
company said the state understates claims against PG&amp;E by $2.5
billion.</TE>
<TE>   "The plan of the PUC is not credible on its face," James Lopes,
lead attorney for PG&amp;E, told a news briefing.</TE>
<TE>   Commission President Loretta M. Lynch said she had not yet seen
PG&amp;E's filing. But she defended the state plan, saying disparities in
costs and revenues are understandable because the commission's
numbers are based on PG&amp;E's financial reports from Nov. 30.</TE>
<TE>   "We obviously anticipate truing up those numbers," she said at a
regularly scheduled news conference. "What we know is that ... there
is headroom or profit that they are building up that needs to be
dedicated to ratepayers, not shareholders."</TE>
<TE>   Lopes said that even if Montali allows the commission's plan to
proceed, "I don't think it would be a significant setback, because we
would continue to go forward with our plan."</TE>
<TE>   The judge recently decided that PG&amp;E could not seek a blanket
preemption of dozens of state laws as its reorganizes. That prompted
the commission to declare the utility's plan dead, but the company
said it intends to modify the plan in ways that the judge suggested
could make it acceptable.</TE>

<HD>Panel Signs Off on Land Swap</HD>
<DH>Thousand Oaks: Controversial deal led to a shakeup of
city's Planning Commission.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A complex land-swap deal that would preserve nearly 200 acres of open
space in Thousand Oaks won support from the city's Planning
Commission early Wednesday, a week after two commission members were
ousted for delaying a decision on the plan.</LD>
<LD>   In exchange for not building on a 191-acre site near Hill Canyon
known as the Western Plateau, its owner and two other developers
would be allowed to convert proposed senior and affordable housing
units in the upscale Dos Vientos Ranch neighborhood into more
profitable housing.</LD>
<LD>   "This entire project is excellent planning," said Jim Bruno, who
joined the 3-1 vote in favor of the plan. "Problems are in the eye of
the beholder."</LD>
<TE>   In a six-hour meeting that began Tuesday evening, Commissioner
Claudia Bill-de la Pena cast the sole vote against the deal, citing
legal concerns over zoning. Last week, then-commissioners Michael
Farris and Nora Aidukas also had voiced concerns about the legality
of the proposal. They were ousted by a divided City Council after
delaying a recommendation on the plateau deal.</TE>
<TE>   Farris was replaced by Forrest Frields, a former commissioner who
had supported elements of the Dos Vientos development in the past.
The council majority refused to replace Aidukas, an appointee of
Councilwoman Linda Parks, with any of the substitutes Parks
suggested. That position remains vacant.</TE>
<TE>   With a recommendation in place, the deal now goes to the City
Council for a vote on Tuesday. This places Parks, vying for a seat on
the Ventura County Board of Supervisors, in the position of having to
vote on the politically delicate land swap before the March 5
election.</TE>
<TE>   If Parks supports the deal, detractors may accuse her of assisting
developers, but to oppose the plan could hurt her reputation as a
protector of open space.</TE>
<TE>   Parks has not said how she will vote but said she is ready to make
a decision. Councilmen Andy Fox, Dennis Gillette and Dan Del Campo,
who voted to censure Parks and oust the two planning commissioners
for allegedly conspiring to stall the controversial deal, have
indicated they support the land swap.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Ed Masry's objection has been that the agreement fails to
provide new affordable housing for seniors. Fox said he hopes to nail
down, by next week's meeting, a guarantee from developers to build at
least 120 affordable apartment units elsewhere in the city.</TE>
<TE>   Parks' camp contends the deal cannot be approved without a vote of
the people, because a city ordinance gives residents say over
development on land zoned as open space. City land-use maps from the
1990s indicate that a sliver of the land that could hold houses under
the Western Plateau proposal is covered by that ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the city maintain those maps contained a printing
error that has since been corrected, and that the land in question
never fell under the city's growth restrictions.</TE>

<LD>A driver who police said suffered a diabetic attack received minor
injuries Wednesday when his car landed on the roof of a house next to
the border with La Habra.</LD>
<LD>   Frank Marruffo, 50, of Santa Fe Springs was in good condition at a
hospital, police said.</LD>
<LD>   "The road is about 50 feet from the house on an incline," said
Sgt. Eric Lindblom, a spokesman for the sheriff's Industry station.
"The road turns to the left, and he didn't."</LD>
<TE>   Rescuers used a ladder to get Marruffo off the roof of the house
in the 1200 block of Hiatt Avenue about 6 p.m. The green Buick
remained on the roof as workers debated how to get it down.</TE>
<TE>   "We won't know how much damage was done to the roof until we
remove the car," Lindblom said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal grand jury indicted a Newport Beach man Wednesday on
charges of possessing child pornography and a pipe bomb that police
said they found during a search of his home in December.</LD>
<LD>   Bruce Knight Cleworth, 72, is accused of possessing at least 10
images of child pornography kept in binders at his home, as well as
the pipe bomb, the U.S. attorney's office said.</LD>
<LD>   Newport Beach police conducted the search after a 40-year-old
Oregon man accused Cleworth of molesting him more than 25 years ago.
No charges have been filed in that investigation.</LD>
<TE>   Cleworth, who must appear Monday in U.S. District Court in Santa
Ana, faces up to five years in prison if convicted on the child
pornography charge and up to 10 years if convicted on the pipe bomb
charge.</TE>

<LD>   Rackauckas fired Karen Davis shortly after he took office in 1999,

<HD>Defense Says Fatal Explosion Was an Accident, Not a Crime</HD>
<DH>Courts: Lawyers say two defendants believed they were
conducting a test when blast killed two near Chatsworth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Defense lawyers argued Wednesday that prosecutors failed to prove
that hazardous waste was being illegally stored and burned at the
Santa Susana Field Laboratory near Chatsworth when two scientists
were killed in an explosion in 1994.</LD>
<LD>   John D. Vandevelde said the criminal case against his client, a
former Rocketdyne supervisor, has "fundamental problems."</LD>
<LD>   "It didn't make sense 61/2 years ago when I got involved in this
case, and it doesn't make sense today," he said in his closing
argument.</LD>
<TE>   Vandevelde's client, Joseph E. Flanagan, 61, of Stanwood, Wash.,
is on trial for allegedly storing and disposing of hazardous waste
illegally. His co-defendant, Edgar R. Wilson, 65, of Chatsworth, is
charged with illegally burning waste.</TE>
<TE>   The Riverside jury could begin deliberations in the four-month
trial as early as today.</TE>
<TE>   Both defendants testified that the chemicals being burned at the
field laboratory in July 1994 were excess materials but not waste.
They contend the burnings were part of legitimate scientific
experiments.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Wilson had every reason to believe it was a test and not a
crime," said his attorney, Leonard Sharenow.</TE>
<TE>   In their closing arguments, Vandevelde and Sharenow criticized the
prosecution's case and, at times, the prosecutor himself, Assistant
U.S. Atty. William Carter.</TE>
<TE>   "They are attempting to conjure up a crime where no crime exists,"
Sharenow told jurors.</TE>
<TE>   Flanagan and Wilson are charged with felony violations of the
Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Carter contends that
the environmental law was broken when five Rocketdyne employees,
including Wilson, burned chemicals at a test site on July 21, 1994,
and July 26, 1994.</TE>
<TE>   On the second day, the burnings ended abruptly with an explosion
that instantly killed chemical engineer Otto K. Heiney, 53, of Canoga
Park, and physicist Larry A. Pugh, 51, of Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Flanagan, then director of Rocketdyne's Chemical Technology Group,
was not present on either day, but was the men's supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers said one of the prosecution's key witnesses made
thousands of dollars by helping plaintiffs sue Rocketdyne in a
separate taxpayer action arising from the same incidents. The defense
contended that a second witness allegedly was intimidated by the
prosecution, which threatened to name him as a co-defendant in this
case.</TE>
<TE>   Vandevelde said neither Flanagan nor Heiney had any motive to burn
waste illegally at Santa Susana. He denied that there was corporate
pressure on Flanagan to dispose of excess materials immediately,
saying the employees would not have created an extensive inventory if
they had planned to get rid of the materials illegally.</TE>
<TE>   Flanagan testified last month that he did not direct, approve or
plan any "phony testing" or illegal storage of waste.</TE>
<TE>   He said Heiney asked if he could use excess materials to conduct
overpressure tests, and Flanagan approved.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson, a lab technician assigned to work with Heiney at the test
site, said his boss, James F. Weber, assured him that Flanagan had
authorized the test.</TE>
<TE>   Sharenow said the mere presence of Heiney and Pugh, respected
scientists in the aerospace industry, gave the work "authenticity."</TE>
<TE>   To win convictions, Carter must show that Flanagan and Wilson knew
the men were burning waste.</TE>
<TE>   The trial is being held in Riverside because the case, filed in
Los Angeles, was randomly assigned to Judge Robert J. Timlin of the
U.S. District Court's Central District.</TE>

<HD>Students Fear Effects of Sex Class Scandal at Berkeley</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M.GLIONNA and DANIEL HERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>On this UC campus renowned for its tolerance, many students consider
the courses a welcome distraction from the staid offerings of the
ivory tower.</LD>
<LD>   Known as "democratic education at Cal"--or "de-cal"--classes,
their subjects range from "Seinfeld" and "The Simpsons" to Dr. Seuss,
the Grateful Dead, professional wrestling and "The Joy of Garbage."</LD>
<LD>   For many, the 100 or so for-credit electives represent what's best
about an education at UC Berkeley. Though overseen by faculty, they
are taught by students--allowing curious undergraduates to venture
beyond the standard subjects in the course catalog.</LD>
<TE>   But now, students worry that the program could be in danger.
Officials on Friday suspended a course on male sexuality amid
allegations that students last semester engaged in an orgy, took
graphic pictures and watched a student teacher have sex onstage at a
gay strip club.</TE>
<TE>   Officials also are investigating a female sexuality course offered
through de-cal, but its sessions have been allowed to continue. UC
Berkeley spokeswoman Janet Gilmore said Wednesday that the
investigation does not extend beyond those two courses.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, we're looking at the allegations about what went on in
the male sexuality class. That's where our focus is right now," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, some undergrads on the 32,000-student campus, known for
its open attitudes toward sexuality and free speech, defended the
de-cal program.</TE>
<TE>   Catherine Ahn, a student government vice president, said some
students consider de-cal courses the best classes Berkeley offers.</TE>
<TE>   She called the courses "really important, incredibly important,"
adding that they fill "that empty space where faculty can't go."</TE>
<TE>   Other students agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "I ask friends of mine who go to other schools what classes they
take and they say 'Oh, you know, biology,' and I just blow them out
of the water when I say, 'Well, I took a course on blaxploitation
films and 'Star Wars,'" said 18--year-old Tim Shoffner, a freshman
from Laguna Beach. "It gives students a chance to teach their own
classes. You can learn a lot that way, seeing the other side of the
academic equation."</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in busy Sproul Plaza, Shoffner and several male friends
downplayed the controversy but said they feared that it could
jeopardize the de-cal program.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a terrible thing, because there's a lot of good classes
that don't get so much hype," said freshman Gavin Raders. "I'm taking
a de-cal class now called 'Foreign Policy Since 9/11.' It's
immediate. It's taught by students. And you can't find it anywhere
else."</TE>
<TE>   Student Ellen Byun said her friend took de-cal's female sexuality
class, which included a field trip to a female strip club. "The whole
focus was feeling good about your body," she said. "These classes are
edgy, because that's the way people like them. I think this has been
blown way out of proportion."</TE>
<TE>   Several students said they believe that the program should make
sure students know they are not required to participate in
extracurricular field trips.</TE>
<TE>   But sophomore Jordan Webb, said that sometimes the male sex-ed
class went too far. "They'd dress up in nothing but thongs and pass
out fliers for the course," he said. "Sometimes these foreign
engineering students would be so afraid, they'd actually run away.
And these guys would chase them."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, even de-cal organizers blasted the male-sexuality
class leaders on the program Web site. "If the allegations are indeed
true, they wrote, "then ... the student [teachers] displayed not only
the glaring lack of a moral compass but the absence of even the most
basic common sense."</TE>
<TE>   The uproar comes after the Daily Californian, the student
newspaper, published allegations that an orgy occurred at a party
held at the home of a student instructor. The party was intended to
help students get acquainted but was not mandatory, the paper said.</TE>
<TE>   The paper also reported that some students played a game in which
they privately took Polaroid snapshots of their genitalia, and that
the group later tried to match the photos with the correct owner.</TE>
<TE>   Other students reportedly went to a gay strip club as their final
project and watched the class leaders strip and have sex onstage,
according to the student paper.</TE>
<TE>   The online de-cal course catalog says the male sexuality class is
intended "to provide a safe environment in which men may work through
their sexual frustrations and curiosities. With an emphasis on
self-respect and respect for others, this class will cover a wide
range of topics surrounding male sexuality regardless of their sexual
orientation or personal sexual background."</TE>
<TE>   Whether the sexuality courses will continue remains an open
question. But some students predict the uproar will pass.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to be one of those Berkeley things," Webb said.
"They'll debate it for years, but nothing will happen."</TE>

<HD>'Giveaway' Lease of South Gate Parcel Assailed</HD>
<DH>Pact: The city defends deal with a former associate of the
treasurer. Critics say it amounts to a gift of public funds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former business partner of South Gate Treasurer Albert Robles has
been given a lease on city-owned land for less than its market value
in a deal that is stirring more controversy in the troubled city.</LD>
<LD>   The South Gate City Council on Tuesday night approved a 25-year
lease that permits the businessman, George Garrido, to rent the 15
acres of land for $15,000 a year. Industry experts say the parcel is
worth anywhere from double to 10 times that amount.</LD>
<LD>   City officials say the lower rent was necessary to entice Garrido,
a nursery owner, to give up another leased site that the city wants
for senior citizens housing.</LD>
<TE>   Robles denies that he had any hand in the deal, saying he has
broken off his business relationship with Garrido.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because he had an association with me years ago should not
make [Garrido] a bad person," Robles said. "This controversy is
fueled by enemies of mine."</TE>
<TE>   But critics say the deal amounts to a gift of public funds. The
agreement allows Garrido to sublease the property and extend the
lease to 55 years if he wishes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a giveaway," said Councilman Henry Gonzalez, who voted
against the agreement. "Nothing more than a sweetheart contract."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Raul Moriel, Vice Mayor Xochilt Ruvalcaba and Councilwoman
Maria Benavides voted for the agreement. Councilman Hector De La
Torre, who had voiced opposition to the pact, was absent.</TE>
<TE>   One industrial real estate broker expressed astonishment, saying
he could have leased the site for 10 times what Garrido will be
paying. "I've never seen anything like this in my life," said Leo
Vusich, a broker for Lee &amp; Associates.</TE>
<TE>   Percy Duran, an attorney who spoke on Garrido's behalf at the
meeting, refused to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Garrido owns GWS Nursery &amp; Supplies Inc. and has leased a
seven-acre, city-owned site on West Frontage Road since 1996. Last
year, the original agreement was changed from a month-to-month lease
to a 10-year lease by the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   Because the city now wants that site for senior housing, officials
say they offered Garrido the new site to avoid paying a big
settlement for breaking the lease.</TE>
<TE>   Garrido contends the city would have been on the hook for $9
million in lost revenue if it broke the lease. Critics say the city
could have driven a harder bargain, and that it took his claims at
face value.</TE>
<TE>   The 15-acre site, a former dump now used as a shooting range, is
near the confluence of the Los Angeles River and the Rio Hondo
channel.</TE>
<TE>   Bill De Witt, a businessman and former South Gate mayor, had
appeared at council meetings in recent weeks, offering the city
$30,000 annually to lease the land.</TE>
<TE>   Garrido was linked to Robles through a trucking firm called U.S.
Transport. Garrido organized the firm, according to its articles of
organization. Robles listed the company on his 2001 statement of
economic interest, saying he held a stake of $10,000 or more.</TE>
<TE>   City Atty. Salvador Alva, who drew up the new lease agreement,
said he did not know Robles had a business relationship with Garrido
and said he would "look into it."</TE>
<TE>   Alva insisted that the deal is good for the city. "GWS has no
motive to move," he said. "The city has to entice them to move."</TE>

<LD>An arraignment was postponed Wednesday for a man whose death-penalty
case was thrown out of court this week after prosecutors made a
procedural error.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Schultz, 32, of Ventura is accused of raping and
strangling a Port Hueneme woman during a home burglary eight years
ago.</LD>
<LD>   A murder indictment was set aside Feb. 1 after a Santa Barbara
judge ruled the grand jury was too male-dominated. Subsequent charges
were dismissed this week after a Ventura County judge found the
district attorney's office made an error in refiling the case.</LD>
<TE>   Schultz was rearrested Tuesday at the Ventura County Jail, where
he remains held without bail, and prosecutors filed a new set of
charges. Schultz appeared in court Wednesday but did not enter a
plea. He is due back Feb. 27.</TE>
<TE>   After the hearing, defense attorneys said they are researching
whether prosecutors may be barred from refiling charges given the two
prior rulings.</TE>

<HD>Salmon Is Ready to Make Amends</HD>
<DH>Angels: Coming off the worst season of his career, right
fielder is excited about a healthy and productive 2002.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>For a star with a national profile that borders on the invisible, Tim
Salmon attracted plenty of attention last year. The Angels signed him
to a four-year, $40-million contract extension last spring, just
before he embarked on the worst season of his career, and national
analysts wondered whether the fiscally conservative team had wasted
its limited cash on a player suddenly and inexplicably past his
prime.</LD>
<LD>   Salmon, 33, couldn't get around on the fastball as quickly. He
missed plays in right field that he usually made with ease. Some
players lose their skills gradually, some suddenly, and here was a
career .290 hitter struggling to keep his batting average above .200.
Had his skills eroded that rapidly?</LD>
<LD>   "You weren't talking about a healthy Tim Salmon that had a bad
year," Salmon said. "When I have a healthy year and play that bad,
you can talk about it."</LD>
<TE>   Not that Salmon didn't ask himself that question at times last
summer. He tried everything he could think of to right himself--extra
batting practice, no batting practice, video sessions until his eyes
blurred--because he refused to admit that he could not play through a
series of injuries. It wasn't until the winter, when he resumed
batting practice and effortlessly rediscovered his old swing, that he
fully realized the impact of his injuries.</TE>
<TE>   In the weeks following the 2000 season, he underwent foot surgery,
then shoulder surgery, so rehabilitation preempted his usual
off-season workouts. He suffered a groin injury last spring, and he
never developed full strength because slow healing in the shoulder
prevented him from his usual in-season weightlifting.</TE>
<TE>   But the Angels needed him to play, and he didn't want to let them
down, so he played rather than volunteer for the disabled list. The
Angels finally put him on the DL in July, after the franchise's
all-time leader in home runs had gone four weeks without hitting one.</TE>
<TE>   "Am I ever going to learn? You're pretty stupid putting yourself
through that," Salmon said. "You're only kidding yourself and
everybody else if you think you can play with the same level of
success you expect and everybody else expects if you're not 100%."</TE>
<TE>   History suggests the Angels cannot win if Salmon is not healthy
and productive. In 2001, with Salmon, Darin Erstad and Mo Vaughn
hampered by injury, the Angels finished 41 games out of first place.
In 1999, a season interrupted by Salmon's wrist injury and Jim
Edmonds' shoulder injury, the Angels finished in last place and lost
manager Terry Collins and general manager Bill Bavasi in the process.
"That was the year everything imploded," Salmon said. "You can't just
lose your No. 3 and No. 4 hitters."</TE>
<TE>   Salmon says he is fine now and expects to deliver his "benchmark"
season of 30 home runs, 100 walks, 100 runs scored and 100 runs
batted in. He had all winter to stare at his 2001 numbers--.227 with
17 homers and 49 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   "That's motivation," he said. "I find myself more motivated."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Infielders and outfielders reported Wednesday, joining pitchers
and catchers in a training camp with 63 players.... Although the
Angels added veterans Kevin Appier and Aaron Sele to their starting
rotation, Manager Mike Scioscia said he would not commit to starting
one of the two right-handers on opening day. If the Angels decide
they would be better off with a left-hander against the Cleveland
Indians, Jarrod Washburn could start the opener.</TE>

<HD>Jobe Will Have Heart Bypass Surgery</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frank Jobe, the Dodger team physician who has performed hundreds of
career-saving surgeries and is one of the pioneers in the sports
medicine field, will be on the other end of the scalpel Tuesday when
he undergoes quadruple bypass surgery in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   A body scan before spring training revealed four blockages in
Jobe's heart, one that could be life-threatening. Jobe, 76, left
Dodgertown in Vero Beach, Fla., to return to Southern California and
will undergo coronary artery bypass graft surgery, to be performed by
Dr. Vaughn Starnes at Centinela Hospital Medical Center's Tommy
Lasorda Heart Institute.</LD>
<LD>   Doctors have told Jobe, who has been with the Dodgers since 1964,
he will be up and around within a few weeks, but the Dodgers don't
expect him to return to Florida for spring training. Dr. Ralph
Gambardella, who shares team physician duties with Jobe, will be
available in the interim.</LD>
<TE>   "Dr. Jobe is an important member of the Dodger organization and is
a true pioneer in his field," said Derrick Hall, the team's senior
vice president of communications. "He has saved a lot of careers
throughout his tenure, and we expect him to continue to do so after a
speedy recovery."</TE>
<TE>   Jobe is most known for performing the revolutionary elbow tendon
transplant operation on Dodger pitcher Tommy John in 1974.</TE>
<TE>   John went 124-106 before the elbow reconstruction surgery and
164-125 in 14 seasons after it, even though Jobe felt John's chances
of pitching again were one in 100. Jobe has since performed more than
500 of the procedures, which are now known as "Tommy John" surgeries,
including two on current Dodger Darren Dreifort.</TE>
<TE>   "He's in very good spirits, and he knows the top heart surgeons in
the world are taking care of him," said Lasorda, a long-time friend
of Jobe. "He's very calm about it."</TE>
<TE>   Mike DiGiovanna</TE>

<TE>   Outfielder Bobby Abreu has agreed to the richest contract in
Philadelphia Phillies' history, a $64-million, five-year extension
with a team option that could make the deal worth $78 million.</TE>
<TE>   The contract was announced five days after third baseman Scott
Rolen publicly criticized management for what he called a lack of
commitment to winning.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City Royal shortstop Neifi Perez admitted that he is two
years older than he claimed to be.</TE>
<TE>   Perez had listed his birthday as June 2, 1975. But in a morning
meeting with General Manager Allard Baird, Perez confessed he is two
years older, making him 28.</TE>
<TE>   Signaling that baseball was prepared to back off its attempt to
fold the Minnesota Twins, owner Carl Pohlad said he intended to sell
the team and Commissioner Bud Selig gave the plan his blessing.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that our fans in the Upper Midwest want the Twins to
continue to play here," Pohlad said. He added that "may best be
achieved" by a sale, which would require the buyer keep the team in
Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Martinez, 37, counted on to be a key backup for the Atlanta
Braves, will miss the season because of a knee problem.</TE>

<HD>Rewriting Cinderella Story</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norword</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's time to consider Cinderella contenders.</LD>
<LD>   Before you scramble to claim Ball State, take note: Despite those
early-season upsets of Kansas and UCLA, the Cardinals are in
considerable danger of missing the NCAA tournament.</LD>
<LD>   At 17-9 with an RPI in the 60s, Ball State might need to win the
Mid-American Conference's scratch-and-claw tournament just to earn a
spot. (Even beating now-No. 1 Kansas might not overcome some bad
conference slip-ups.)</LD>
<TE>   You say you want to stick with Gonzaga?</TE>
<TE>   Sorry, the Zags hardly qualify as underdogs anymore.</TE>
<TE>   The only first-round upset involving Gonzaga would be a Gonzaga
loss.</TE>
<TE>   Good old Valparaiso?</TE>
<TE>   Well, maybe--if the 20-7 Crusaders win the Mid-Continent
tournament to make the field a year after a mononucleosis outbreak
contributed to Valpo's loss in last season's title game. Among
Valparaiso's intriguing results this season, the Crusaders have
beaten North Carolina Charlotte and lost to Arizona by four and
Kansas by eight.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with looking for Cinderella anymore is that she's
already at the dance, and getting plenty of attention.</TE>
<TE>   Western Kentucky, a potential March darling, is already in the top
25.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzaga is in the top 10.</TE>
<TE>   This March, when a team from the Big Ten loses to a team from the
Big-Mid-Something-Or-Other, the word "upset" might not fit.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a glance at the potential upstarts in this year's NCAA
field--and we're taking suggestions on a name-change for Cinderella.</TE>
<TE>   Western Kentucky (24-3)--The Hilltoppers beat Kentucky in Rupp
Arena in November before losing 7-footer Chris Marcus--a
late-blooming former Wal-Mart employee--for 17 games because of a
foot injury. But Western Kentucky went 15-2 without Marcus. Now he's
back, slowly increasing his minutes and breaking through for a
32-point, 15-rebound game against Kentucky State Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Butler (24-4)--This team has done it before, upsetting Wake Forest
in the first round last season. If the Bulldogs win a game or two, be
prepared to hear a lot about Bobby Plump--the high school player
whose shot inspired the movie "Hoosiers" went on to play at Butler.
This season's resume includes victories over Indiana and Ball State.</TE>
<TE>   Kent State (21-5)--You might remember guard Trevor Huffman, whose
24-point performance helped upset Indiana in the first round last
season before a second-round loss to Cincinnati. Kent State had to
adjust to a new coach, Stan Heath, after Gary Waters left for
Rutgers, and lost four of its first eight games. But the Golden
Flashes have pulled together just fine--witness 12 victories in a
row, including one over Marshall Tuesday in which they made 16 of 28
three-pointers.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine (18-7)--The Waves aren't quite a lock--UCLA might
actually hurt Pepperdine with its slip-ups because the Bruins make
that victory look less impressive. But any team that beat USC and
Gonzaga is more than capable of winning at least a first-round game,
and Pepperdine has a good postseason formula--strong guard play,
excellent balance and depth, and an intimidating shot-blocker in
Cedric Suitt.</TE>
<TE>   Watch Your Language</TE>
<TE>   Cinderella used to be Gonzaga Coach Mark Few's least favorite
word.</TE>
<TE>   Now there's another: mid-major.</TE>
<TE>   "He hates that mid-major comment more than anything else, I
think," guard Dan Dickau said. "I think he hates it more than a
turnover.</TE>
<TE>   "He's an extremely competitive person, and when you put the
mid-major tag on us, I think it seems to him as if you're putting us
on a different level, when he wants it to be a level playing field. I
think if you've seen the last three, four years, Gonzaga's shown we
are on the same level as these other teams."</TE>
<TE>   After reaching the Sweet 16 three years in a row--Duke and
Michigan State are the only other teams to do that--Gonzaga is a top
10 team and, for the first time, assured of making the NCAA
tournament no matter what happens in the West Coast Conference
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Call that a "major" step.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah. It feels a lot different," Few said. "It's certainly more
relaxed for mid-February than in the past."</TE>
<TE>   He insists the drive to win the WCC hasn't changed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something we take a lot of pride in, being league champs."</TE>
<TE>   Terrapin and the Hare</TE>
<TE>   Abandoned in a corner of the Maryland locker room Sunday was a
bunch of roses painted black and blue.</TE>
<TE>   A Charlotte Observer reporter spotted them and read the sarcastic
note that was attached, apparently from a Duke fan.</TE>
<TE>   "Turtles, the whole world feels your sorrow over your loss ... but
only in fairy tales can a turtle beat a rabbit."</TE>
<TE>   The Terrapins got the last laugh on that one.</TE>
<TE>   It was Steve Blake's vastly improved defense on Jason Williams
that helped Maryland win the rematch, knocking Duke from its No. 1
perch.</TE>
<TE>   Blake helped cut Williams' scoring from 34 points in the first
game to 17 in the second. He also had 13 assists and only one
turnover.</TE>
<TE>   The other dramatic aspect of the game was the emergence of Chris
Wilcox, Maryland's supremely athletic sophomore forward.</TE>
<TE>   Wilcox scored a career-high 23 points.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland Coach Gary Williams should be hoping Wilcox doesn't get
hot enough in the postseason to decide to turn pro.</TE>
<TE>   Bracket Racket</TE>
<TE>   Lee Fowler, chairman of the NCAA tournament selection committee,
said the new format designed to allow some teams to play first- and
second-round games at sites closer to home probably will affect
mostly teams seeded among the top five in a region. (That could mean
the Nos.12-16 seeded teams will play closer to home as well.)</TE>
<TE>   What the committee needs to avoid: Moving a game between closely
competitive teams, such as a No. 8 vs. No. 9, to a site more
favorable to one.</TE>
<TE>   And don't worry, blank bracket sheets will still work. The only
difference is a site will be listed for every four teams in the
bracket, instead of every eight.</TE>

<LD>   Pacific (15-9, 7-7) at Cal State Fullerton (4-19, 1-13), 5:30, Fox
Sports Net--Big West coaches figured that Pacific would be a
late-developing team that makes a run in the conference tournament.
The Tigers are beginning to look like that type of team. Pacific
knocked off UC Irvine, 73-61, Saturday. Forward Pape Sow had 19
points and 10 rebounds in Fullerton's 65-53 loss to Idaho.</LD>
<LD>   Cal Poly San Luis Obispo (14-8, 8-6) at UC Irvine (18-8, 11-4), 7,
KUCI-FM (88.9)--The Anteaters are still in contention for the Big
West regular-season title, but they face a must-win situation with
tough home games tonight against San Luis Obispo and Saturday against
UC Santa Barbara. Irvine has won only four of its last seven and
guard Jerry Green is coming off a subpar 10-point outing in a loss to
Pacific. Green had a season-low seven points in the Anteaters' 50-47
loss at San Luis Obispo on Jan. 26. Fourth-place San Luis Obispo is
coming off a 69-66 loss at Santa Barbara.</LD>
<TE>   Cal State Northridge (8-15, 7-7) at UC Riverside (8-14, 5-9), 7,
KPRO (1570), KUCR-FM (88.3)--Northridge, which was tied for first
place in the Big West on Jan. 26, has lost five in a row. Senior
point guard Markus Carr is struggling because of a sprained big toe
and has missed 20 of 24 shots over the last two games. Riverside is
coming off a 59-42 loss to Utah State.</TE>
<TE>   UC Santa Barbara (15-8, 9-5) at Long Beach State (10-16, 6-9),
7:30, KEYT (1250)--Santa Barbara is riding a three-game winning
streak and Long Beach has won four of six. Branduinn Fullove scored
29 points Saturday as Santa Barbara moved into third place in the Big
West with a 69-66 victory over San Luis Obispo. Long Beach defeated
Northridge, 73-60.</TE>

<HD>Riverside Is No Big West Pushover</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the beginning of the season, Big West opponents no doubt were
eagerly anticipating their games against UC Riverside, a new kid on
the block in the conference and playing a Division I schedule for
only the second season.</LD>
<LD>   Not anymore.</LD>
<LD>   Going into the final two weeks of conference play, the
Highlanders, 13-10 overall, are sandwiched between first-place Santa
Barbara and third-place Long Beach State. Those are the only teams
they have lost to in 12 conference games.</LD>
<TE>   "We had some confidence of being competitive within the
conference," Coach Jennifer Young said. "We beat Fullerton and
Northridge last year. But being second is a pleasant surprise."</TE>
<TE>   Young has six seniors, including leading scorer Amy Houchens, who
is averaging 15.6 points overall, Crystal Harris, who is averaging
12.2 points in conference, and Starr Knight, whose 6.4 rebounding
average leads the team. "They all provide a tremendous amount of
leadership,'' Young said.</TE>
<TE>   But the most important factor has been health. Young said this is
the first time in the last three seasons her team has been virtually
intact all season.</TE>
<TE>   Case in point: Center Stephanie Hughes missed 15 games last season
when she sustained a fractured right eye socket during practice a
week before the season started. This season, Hughes, a senior
averaging 8.3 points and 4.7 rebounds, has missed only two games.</TE>
<TE>   Young has been hard on the Highlanders, insisting they approach
every game "like it was a championship game."</TE>
<TE>   "We have to bring our best every night," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The question remains whether Riverside has enough energy and
emotional fortitude to continue its winning ways through the rest of
the conference season and the Big West tournament (March, 6, 8-9 at
the Anaheim Convention Center).</TE>
<TE>   But, as Young pointed out, "this is all new to us--[being in] the
[Division I] conference. Every game takes a lot out of us, and right
now the success is hard to enjoy. But I have a talented squad. We're
on a mission to continue our success. And I think the teams we've
played the second time realize we're not a fluke."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Stanford sweep of UCLA and USC in Los Angeles this week would
mark the fourth time the Cardinal has gone unbeaten in conference
games. The Cardinal, which last week clinched the No. 1 seeding for
the first women's Pac-10 tournament (March 1-4 at Oregon's McArthur
Court), went 18-0 in the 1988-89, 1995-96 and 1996-97 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford is the only school to go unbeaten in conference since the
women's Pac-10 was formed 16 seasons ago and has finished first 11
times.</TE>
<TE>   On the flip side, Washington State has two final shots to avoid
being the first Pac-10 school to go winless in a conference season.</TE>
<TE>   The Cougars, who at times have had a lineup including four
freshmen, are guaranteed their worst season since entering Division I
in 1971. They are mired in a school-record 21-game losing streak, and
have lost 19 consecutive Pac-10 games. They have lost 14 games this
season by 20 or more points.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, in my career, nothing is comparable to this season," said
Coach Jenny Przekwas, whose team finishes the regular season at home
against Oregon and Oregon State. "But we're not focusing on next
year; we're just trying to figure out how to get some success this
year. It helps to have a life and some positive things outside
basketball."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the men's Pac-10 tournament, all 10 schools will
participate in the women's conference tournament.</TE>

<KH>GOLF THOMAS BONK</KH>
<HD>Woods Hopes to Master the New-Look Augusta</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's still six weeks away, but the Masters always seems to be in the
news, with its new look and its old champion. Nearly 300 yards have
been added to Augusta National and nine holes have been altered,
supposedly to make the venerable layout a lot tougher in the years to
come. That's all right with Tiger Woods, who doesn't take the
alterations personally.</LD>
<LD>   "The changes are not for me," Woods said. "They're for the kids
that are coming up in the future. You know, I'm not that long
anymore. I kind of dink it around."</LD>
<LD>   (Woods averages 298.2 yards off the tee, second to John Daly at
316.7. The PGA Tour average is 277.)</LD>
<TE>   "There are a lot of kids out there now in college golf and in high
school golf that hit the ball further than I do," Woods said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're getting bigger and stronger and the new technology is
helping out. It's only going to enhance that in the future. So I
guess they went ahead and took a step to prevent players in the
future from shooting tournament-low [record] scores."</TE>
<TE>   Woods won last year with a 16-under-par total. When he won his
first Masters in 1997, Woods established the tournament record total
of 18 under par.</TE>
<TE>   What's going to win it this year, on the beefed-up course? Woods
says a lot depends on the weather, but that's not the only factor.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think in the future the scores will be quite as low
because of the fact that now it's so much longer," he said. "We're
hitting longer clubs [into the greens]. And the last couple of years,
the greens haven't gotten up to speed. Last year, we got some rain to
soften [them] up and we were able to take advantage of that. Hence,
we shot low scores.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if you get the greens baked out, how they had it in '99
when [Jose Maria Olazabal] won, they get it where they're hard and
baked out, where we were hitting longer clubs to the greens, making a
lot of pars will be awfully good."</TE>
<TE>   Club News</TE>
<TE>   Is the PGA Tour ever going to step in and try to solve this club
controversy business?</TE>
<TE>   Maybe, but don't count on it, says PGA Tour Commissioner Tim
Finchem, who would prefer to see the USGA and the Royal and Ancient
settle it by themselves. In fact, Finchem says he has told both
bodies to get their act together, the sooner the better.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the current system is inefficient on its face, that to
have two groups writing the rules instead of one for a global sport
doesn't seem to us to make a lot of sense," Finchem said.</TE>
<TE>   The best way to get it done is for a new decision-making group to
be formed, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are patient," he said. "We are not in a position to insist on
anything, except to say that we would go off and do a different set
of rules for golf at the PGA Tour level, which we've already reserved
the right to do."</TE>
<TE>   More Finchem</TE>
<TE>   The next four editions of the Accenture Match Play Championships
will be in the United States and possibly at La Costa Resort and Spa,
which was purchased by KSL Recreation Group in November. Finchem said
the first choice would be to stay at La Costa, but he intends to
discuss the issue with the new owners when the event is over.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder Cup Update</TE>
<TE>   News item: Seve Ballesteros suggests that Olazabal be allowed to
play Ryder Cup this fall, even though he didn't qualify when the team
was chosen last year.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: Sort of like a wild-card deal, huh? Actually, not a bad
idea, as long as both captains get to sub out a player who's slumping
big-time. Seve must be joking. He can't be serious, since such a move
goes against every principle in golf, let's try for it. Not.</TE>
<TE>   Not on This Day</TE>
<TE>   The week's honesty award goes to Matt Gogel, who played Darren
Clarke in the first round at La Costa.</TE>
<TE>   Said Gogel: "Darren is a better player than me. Day in and day
out, he's a better player than me." Clarke lost to Gogel, 2-and-1.</TE>
<TE>   He's Making Sure</TE>
<TE>   Sergio Garcia adjusted his grip 36 times on his tee shot at No. 1.
Not that anybody's counting.</TE>
<TE>   Sergio-Martina?</TE>
<TE>   No one is denying that Garcia and tennis player Martina Hingis are
friendly. Just how friendly has not yet been established, although
hints have been dropped everywhere. Last week, the Barcelona-based
newspaper Sport published pictures of Hingis and Garcia together in a
blue Ferrari, purportedly in Garcia's hometown of Borriol, Spain. The
pair was also supposed to have played golf and tennis together.</TE>
<TE>   And Aspirin</TE>
<TE>   News item: Ernie Els says the secrets to beating jet lag are to
sleep, drink water and hope for the best.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: Players will tell you those are also the secrets to
beating hangovers.</TE>
<TE>   Sink or Swim</TE>
<TE>   News item: To keep his back healthy, Jim Colbert (who defends his
title at the SBC Senior Classic at Valencia Country Club March 1-3)
works out for an hour a day in the swimming pool.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: He makes no mention of the water wings available for his
use at all times.</TE>
<TE>   Birdies, Bogeys, Pars</TE>
<TE>   Wayne Gretzky, Alice Cooper, Andy Garcia, Rick Dees, Kathy Lee
Crosby and Lee Majors are among the celebrities scheduled to play in
the celebrity pro-am at the SBC Senior Classic, Feb. 27-28 at
Valencia.</TE>
<TE>   Lottery tickets are being sold to play in the Toshiba Senior
Classic pro-am with Fuzzy Zoeller March 4 at Newport Beach Country
Club. Proceeds to go to the Hoag Memorial Presbyterian Hospital in
Newport Beach. Details: (949) 660-1001.</TE>
<TE>   Aree and Naree Wongluekiet, the 15-year-old Thai twins who live in
Bradenton, Fla., have received exemptions into the Kraft Nabisco
Championships, March 28-31 at Mission Hills Country Club in Rancho
Mirage. Three other amateurs and five pros were also given
exemptions. Lorena Ochoa, a sophomore at Arizona, and Nicole Perrit,
the U.S. girls' junior champion from Santiago, Chile, are the
amateurs. The pros are Raquel Carriedo of Spain, Suzann Petterson of
Norway, Karine Ichor of France and Yuri Fudoh and Chieko Amanuma of

<LD>This week's seven-player trade between the Indiana Pacers and the
Chicago Bulls has not gone down well in all quarters.</LD>
<LD>   "In order to make sure the Bulls would retain their hard-earned
status as the worst team in the NBA this season, Jerry Krause traded
away their best player, Elton Brand," wrote Ron Rapoport in the
Chicago Sun-Times.</LD>
<LD>   "To ensure they will carry that position over into next season, he
now has traded their top three scorers: Ron Mercer, Ron Artest and
Brad Miller.</LD>
<TE>   "About this time next season--can anyone doubt it?--Krause will
see what he can get for Jalen Rose.... The question is, how does
Jerry Krause keep his job? The answer is, I have no idea."</TE>

<TE>   Trivia time: Who coached the England soccer team that was upset by
the United States in the 1950 World Cup?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The spokesman: Reporters covering the San Diego Padres miss
retired Tony Gwynn even more than the team will miss his bat.</TE>
<TE>   "Gwynn always had something to say, always, even when he didn't
want to, and it almost always was something good," wrote the San
Diego Union-Tribune's Nick Canepa.</TE>
<TE>   "Tony Gwynn was the greatest batsman of his generation, but as a
conversationalist, he hit 1.000. He never popped it up."</TE>

<TE>   See no evil: Driver Johnny Benson had a quick answer when asked
what he saw of an 18-car pileup during Sunday's Daytona 500.</TE>
<TE>   "Aw, we have our eyes closed during that stuff," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The answer man: The departure of Jon Gruden for Tampa Bay has left
Raider owner Al Davis with four draft picks and $8 million but no
coach. Skip Bayless of the San Jose Mercury News suggests a solution.</TE>
<TE>   "There are two moves Davis can make to quickly make his fans and
players forget about Gruden. He can trade some of his vault of picks
for an established star, and he can use the $8 million to hire [Bill]
Parcells."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Through the glass darkly: The San Francisco Chronicle's Scott
Ostler points out a little-known aspect of the increased security at
major league baseball stadiums this season.</TE>
<TE>   "The ballparks," he said, "will have plexiglass barriers to
protect fans from John Rocker."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The unwelcome mat: Former Laker Nick Van Exel wants out of Denver,
but he had better hope the Nuggets don't trade him to the New York
Knicks.</TE>
<TE>   According to Newsday's Barbara Barker, Van Exel "is everything the
Knicks don't need. He's a shoot-first point guard who has a way of
alienating his teammates, his coaches and his team's fans.</TE>
<TE>   "What Van Exel has done in his nine years is show that he can't
play with good players and can't play with bad ones. The Knicks have
a lot of talent that falls somewhere in the middle, but the bet here
is that Van Exel would struggle in that situation too."</TE>

<HD>Sutton Gets Milestone Coaching Victory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eddie Sutton's 700th victory came where Oklahoma State hadn't won in
a while.</LD>
<LD>   The 13th-ranked Cowboys beat Texas, 85-80, on Wednesday night,
their first win in Austin, Texas, since December 1974. But it was the
career milestone that had several players carrying Sutton off the
court when the game ended.</LD>
<LD>   "This was huge for us," Oklahoma State forward Fredrik Jonzen
said. "Not just for Coach Sutton, but for the whole team. It's a lot
more fun to get that win down here, then to go home and beat Baylor
on Saturday."</LD>
<TE>   Sutton, the 14th Division I coach to reach the 700-win mark, is
700-275 in his 32 seasons as a head coach at Creighton, Arkansas,
Kentucky and Oklahoma State.</TE>
<TE>   "He deserves it, it's his 700th win," Texas guard T.J. Ford said.
"Not many coaches get that many wins at a level like this."</TE>
<TE>   Sutton tried to downplay his achievement at first.</TE>
<TE>   "It means I've been coaching a long time," he said. "We've had a
tough time beating the Longhorns. It was a special game and one I'll
always remember."</TE>
<TE>   Victor Williams had 20 points and seven assists to lead Oklahoma
State, 21-6 overall and 8-5 in the Big 12 Conference. The Cowboys
moved into a tie for third place in the conference standings with
Texas (17-9, 8-5) and Texas Tech. The Longhorns have lost four of its
last five conference games.</TE>
<TE>   No. 2 Maryland 84, Clemson 68--Juan Dixon scored 14 of his 21
points in the second half as the Terrapins overcame a sluggish start
at Clemson, S.C., to win their ninth consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland (22-3, 12-1 in the Atlantic Coast Conference) looked
early as if it was still savoring Sunday's 87-73 win over then-No. 1
Duke. But Dixon, the ACC's second-leading scorer, got hot in the
second half and lifted Maryland past Clemson (12-15, 3-11).</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas 67, No. 5 Alabama 59--Charles Tatum scored 16 of his
career-high 20 points in the first half at Fayetteville, Ark., and
the Razorbacks ended a losing streak at three.</TE>
<TE>   The Crimson Tide (22-5, 10-3 in the Southeastern Conference)
trailed 33-19 at halftime and made only four of 33 shots from the
field in the half.</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas (13-12, 5-8) did not score a field goal over the final
7:40 of the game, but Carl Baker, Alonzo Lane, T.J. Cleveland, and
J.J. Sullinger made enough free throws down the stretch for the
Razorbacks.</TE>
<TE>   No. 8 Florida 89, Auburn 61--Udonis Haslem had 18 points at
Gainesville, Fla., during the Gators' fifth win in six games.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Bonner had 13 points and eight rebounds for Florida (20-5,
9-4 in the SEC), which reached the 20-win mark for a school-record
fourth straight season and sixth overall.</TE>
<TE>   The Gators' win also moved them within a game of Alabama for the
SEC's best record. Alabama plays host to Florida on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Auburn (11-13, 3-10) shot 39.7%, missed nine of 14 free throws and
turned the ball over 17 times for 19 Florida points. The Tigers have
lost all eight of their road games this season, including seven in
the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   No. 16 Illinois 83, Penn State 56--Robert Archibald tied his
career-high with 25 points and had 10 rebounds for the Illini in a
Big Ten game at Champaign, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-11 Archibald overpowered the Nittany Lions down low,
scoring on an assortment of dunks and layups.</TE>
<TE>   Illinois (20-7, 8-5) started its winning streak after having
dropped three in a row. Penn State (7-18, 3-11) has lost nine of 11.</TE>
<TE>   No. 23 Indiana 63, No. 19 Ohio State 57--Jeff Newton scored 16
points to lead the Hoosiers' balanced offense at Bloomington,  Ind.</TE>
<TE>   The win gave Indiana (18-8, 10-3) sole possession of first place
in the Big Ten. Brian Brown had 23 points for Ohio State (18-6,
9-4)--a loser for the first time at Assembly Hall since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana held Ohio State scoreless over a 5:25 stretch in the
second half, when the Hoosiers used a 13-0 run to take control.</TE>
<TE>   Florida State 66, No. 22 Virginia 59--Monte Cummings scored 21
points, including five free throws over the final 2:13 at
Tallahassee, and the Seminoles ended a losing streak at six.</TE>

<HD>Fremont Finally Wins at Crenshaw</HD>

<LD>Twenty-five years of frustration ended Wednesday night for Fremont
High Coach Sam Sullivan, whose team gave him his first victory at
Crenshaw, 78-72, in an emotional City Championship quarterfinal game.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm floating on a cloud right now," said Sullivan, who had guided
the Pathfinders (22-5) to three City championships but never a
victory at Crenshaw. "They're a tremendous program."</LD>
<LD>   Geoffrey Clayton had 20 points and Mark Bradford added 15 for
Fremont, which fell behind by as many as 10 points in the second
quarter. The game was intense for players and the standing-room-only
crowd of more than 1,000. Officials had to briefly stop the game
midway through the third quarter after a Fremont fan knocked a
plastic chair onto the court.</LD>
<TE>   Not long afterward, a yellow legal pad was hurled onto the court
by an equally frustrated Crenshaw fan. Both sides were complaining
loudly about the three-man officiating crew, but in the end, Fremont
had 31 fouls and Crenshaw 30. Emotions boiled over five minutes after
the game when a scuffle broke out between Fremont players and
spectators. The Pathfinders were finally escorted out of the gym by
security personnel.</TE>
<TE>   Winning at Crenshaw has been difficult for any team, not just
Fremont. Sixteen City championship banners hang on the walls, an
intimidating sight. "When kids come in and look at the banners, they
get psyched out," Sullivan said.</TE>
<TE>   Fremont, though, had a stabilizing force in Bradford, an All-City
football player. He came through with several critical blocks and
rebounds in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   A three-point basket by Glen Bullard with 4:31 left gave Fremont
the lead for good at 61-59.</TE>
<TE>   Marcus Williams finished with 19 points for Crenshaw (20-8).
Fremont will play Westchester on Saturday at L.A. Southwest College.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Sondheimer</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Westchester 94, Carson 66--Brandon Heath had 22 points, including
four three-point baskets, to lead the host Comets (26-2), the
top-seeded team, to the victory. Hassan Adams added 21 points for
Westchester.</TE>
<TE>   Fairfax 96, Narbonne 66--Jahsha Bluntt had 19 points to lead host
and No. 2-seeded Fairfax (28-3). Evan Burns had 15 points and 17
rebounds, and Kevin Bell had 16 points and 12 assists. Beto Delgado
and Uzoma Mmeje each had 15 points for Narbonne (19-8).</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey 85, Sylmar 75--Eric Flournoy had 24 points to lead the host
Dons (19-5). Lewis Darby had 19 points for Sylmar (21-6).</TE>
<TE>   In a girls' quarterfinal game:</TE>
<TE>   Fairfax 59, Westchester 48--Ashlee Dunlap scored eight of her
game-high 25 points in the final three minutes to help the
seventh-seeded Lions upset the second-seeded Comets at Westchester.</TE>
<TE>   Westchester (18-9) trailed by 12 points midway through the third
quarter, but rallied to cut its deficit to 47-45 with 4:47 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Dunlap hit three field goals and two free throws to build a 55-45
lead with 2:09 left.</TE>
<TE>   Fairfax (21-10), which lost twice to Westchester in Western League
play and fell to the Comets in the semifinals last season, connected
on 21 of 42 shots. Dunlap had 11 rebounds and Kristen Welch had 10
points and five assists for Fairfax. Roneisha Williams led
Westchester with 16 points.</TE>

<DH>Pro basketball: Clippers begin five-game trip without
injured Brand but get a much-needed win, 81-71, against Heat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Grim-faced but hoping he could play Wednesday, Elton Brand walked
onto the court hours before the Clippers faced the Miami Heat. Bands
of heavy, white athletic tape covered his injured right ring finger.</LD>
<LD>   Brand tried a hook shot, then another. His brow furrowed. Both
fell short of the mark. He took a jump shot, then tried to dunk with
his right hand. Neither went in the basket. Soon enough, he returned
to the locker room.</LD>
<LD>   He would not play in the Clippers' 81-71 victory over the Heat
before a crowd of 15,423 at American Airlines Arena. His status for
tonight's game against the Orlando Magic was termed questionable by
the team.</LD>
<TE>   "I can't palm the ball, I can't hold the ball," Brand said,
referring to the stretched tendon he suffered Dec. 7. Of testing his
finger during Wednesday's pregame warmup, he added, "If we were five
games above [the .500 mark], maybe I wouldn't have even tried it."</TE>
<TE>   But the Clippers are 27-28 and in ninth place in the Western
Conference standings, 11/2 games behind the Seattle SuperSonics, who
sit in the eighth and final playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, there is a sense of urgency for the Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   You could see it in the play of Harold Jamison, who replaced Brand
at power forward. Jamison posted Brand-like numbers, scoring 14
points and taking 10 rebounds in 27 minutes--all career highs. His
spin move around Miami center Alonzo Mourning and dunk over him late
in the third quarter propelled the Clippers to a season sweep of the
Heat.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys will tell you that's my patented move," said Jamison, a
former member of the Heat who signed with the Clippers as a free
agent Sept. 28 after spending last season in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant coach Dennis Johnson noticed the cluster of reporters
surrounding Jamison in the locker room and bellowed, "The mayor of
South Beach." Jamison, who still has a residence here, said, "It was
kind of personal tonight. I was down here and they let me go."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Alvin Gentry gave Jamison his second start in place of Brand
this month. Jamison also replaced Brand for a Feb. 3 loss against the
Boston Celtics. A sore elbow sidelined Brand for that game, his first
miss of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't even remember the last time Jamison played in a game,"
Gentry said. "The one thing that he does is keep himself ready to
play all the time. I think [Miami power forward] Brian Grant, night
in and night out, outplays everybody else. From an effort standpoint,
I thought Harold matched him. I think he did a great job."</TE>
<TE>   But there was more to the Clippers' victory than Jamison's points,
rebounds and energy. Contributions came from expected sources such as
Quentin Richardson, who had 25 points and 11 rebounds, and unexpected
ones such as Sean Rooks (11 points on five-of-eight shooting).</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers started sluggishly but went on a 20-5 run to close
the second quarter and took a 43-36 lead by halftime. Their first
lead didn't come until Rooks made a jump shot off a pick-and-roll
play with point guard Jeff McInnis for a 33-31 advantage with 3:15
left in the half.</TE>
<TE>   Once ahead, the Clippers never trailed and never faltered. Despite
playing without Brand, their leading scorer and rebounder with
averages of 18.3 points and 11.3 rebounds, and Lamar Odom (sprained
right wrist and sprained right ankle), the Clippers looked poised
during key moments.</TE>
<TE>   Miami cut the Clipper lead to 69-67 after Mourning scored two of
his 17 points. But Clipper center Michael Olowokandi countered with a
short jump shot, Richardson rebounded Darius Miles' miss and scored
and Rooks made a jumper. The Heat never got within eight the rest of
the way.</TE>
<TE>   "The one word we talked about in the scouting report about this
team, whether Elton Brand or Lamar Odom are out there, was
'relentless,'" Miami Coach Pat Riley said of the Clippers. "I thought
their effort far surpassed ours. They just did a great job on the
offensive boards. We got out to a pretty good start, but when Quentin
Richardson came into the game, he dominated and got them ahead at
halftime.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very, very disappointing. I give Alvin and the Clippers a
lot of credit. They basically came in here and kicked our tails."</TE>

<HD>Maggette Suffers a Concussion</HD>

<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Corey Maggette suffered a concussion with 1:57 remaining in the third
quarter of the Clippers' victory Wednesday over the Miami Heat.</LD>
<LD>   He said he hopes to play tonight against the Orlando Magic.</LD>
<LD>   He also said he hopes to find out who clobbered him.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't know what happened; somebody hit me," Maggette said. "I'm
going to look [at the videotape] and find out who."</TE>
<TE>   Maggette crumpled to the court after the collision, then walked
rubbery-legged to the Clippers' bench after the team called a
20-second timeout to aid him.</TE>
<TE>   "The last thing I remember was my layup," he said, referring to a
fastbreak basket that gave the Clippers a 66-57 lead moments before
he fell.</TE>
<TE>   The team said Maggette's status for tonight's game is
questionable. He has been nursing a sore left knee for more than two
months, but still has played in 52 of the team's 55 games.</TE>
<TE>   If Maggette cannot play, Coach Alvin Gentry will be forced to do
some juggling with his healthy forwards.</TE>
<TE>   Elton Brand did not play Wednesday because of a stretched tendon
in his right ring finger and might not be fit to play tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Lamar Odom was in L.A., rehabilitating a sprained right wrist and
a sprained right ankle and is expected to be sidelined for at least
two more weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "If he's not able to go, we're going to have to plug someone else
in," Gentry said, referring to Maggette. "The only thing is, we're
running out of guys to plug in."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry on the Heat, which was on a 12-4 roll before losing to the
Clippers: "I still don't think you've heard the last of Miami. I
think you'll see them find a way to get into the playoffs, and if
they get in the playoffs, anything can happen."</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>

<TE>   Records--Clippers 27-28, Magic 27-25.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Magic--1-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update--Orlando is fifth in the league in scoring, averaging 100.5
points. Tracy McGrady is seventh among individual scorers, averaging
24.9 points. McGrady scored his season-best of 47 points in the
Magic's Dec. 10 loss to the Clippers at Staples Center. The Clippers
are 3-9 at Orlando and haven't swept the season series against the
Magic since 1991-92. Tonight's game is the second of a five-game trip
for the Clippers, who began a stretch of nine games in 10 on the road
with Wednesday's victory at Miami.</TE>

<HD>Tendinitis Limits Green's Action</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>A team medical report that, just a few days ago, Manager Jim Tracy
called "the prettiest-looking thing since the contract I signed on
Nov. 1, 2000," would not have won any beauty pageants Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Right fielder Shawn Green has a mild case of tendinitis in his
left (throwing) shoulder and will be held out of extensive throwing
drills for at least a week. Green's arm got sore following an early
January workout, and an MRI test showed no major problems.</LD>
<LD>   But the shoulder continued to bother Green through January and
early February, so he stopped throwing and began a strengthening
program. Green can take batting practice and participate in drills
that don't require strenuous throwing.</LD>
<TE>   "There's no sense pushing things," said Green, who is coming off a
monster year in which he batted .297 with 49 home runs and 125 runs
batted in. "The first time I threw after the New Year, my arm was
stiffer than usual. I thought it would work itself out, but it
didn't, so I went on a rehabilitation program. It doesn't bother me
to do anything but throw hard."</TE>
<TE>   Green sat out all but nine games of the exhibition season last
spring because of a sprained ligament in his thumb, and he probably
will be a designated hitter against American League teams in the
first week of spring games.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to nip it in the bud," Green said. "If this was the
regular season, I could play, and it would be sore. But instead of
having a nagging injury, I want to get rid of it now. I'm confident
we've caught this before it becomes a long-term problem."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers will miss Gary Sheffield's bat--the left fielder
averaged 37 home runs and 103 RBIs for three seasons before he was
traded--but they will not miss the distractions he caused, especially
last spring.</TE>
<TE>   "No team wants to go through that," second baseman Mark
Grudzielanek said. "That had an effect on things in spring training
and it carried over to the season."</TE>
<TE>   Grudzielanek said several Dodgers were concerned about Sheffield
being critical of teammates, though many remained quiet at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "In the back of players' minds they were worried about the
situation and wondering what was going to happen," Grudzielanek said.
"Some things went on that weren't the right thing to say or do. We
were wondering, 'What's the deal? What's going to happen next?' No
question, that was triggered in spring training."</TE>
<TE>   With the Dodgers holding their first full-squad workout Wednesday,
Grudzielanek couldn't help but notice the relaxed atmosphere in the
clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   "[Sheffield] was a gifted individual, his offense will be tough to
replace, but with the addition of [Brian] Jordan and a healthy Eric
Karros, we can make it up," Grudzielanek said. "We're probably a
better team in the clubhouse, and hopefully it will show on the
field."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy was impressed with infielder Cesar Izturis, the 22-year-old
Venezuelan defensive whiz who was acquired in a winter trade with
Toronto and is considered a slight favorite to beat out Alex Cora for
the starting shortstop job.</TE>
<TE>   Cora batted .217 with a .285 on-base percentage and had a .962
fielding percentage in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "I told Alex that today is Feb. 20, and my mind is in no way made
up about anything," Tracy said. "So don't change your demeanor or the
way you go about your business."</TE>
<TE>   Ace Kevin Brown, who threw off flat ground Monday and Tuesday,
will throw off a mound today for the first time since undergoing
surgery in September to repair a torn flexor muscle. Andy Ashby, who
is recovering from similar surgery, will throw batting practice
Saturday.... The Dodgers appear to be making progress on a multiyear
deal for catcher Paul Lo Duca, but an initial two-year offer to
reliever Matt Herges was deemed too low.</TE>

<DH>Golf: Woods, Mickelson and Duval can't survive opening day
of match-play event at La Costa.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CARLSBAD</DL>
<LD>What's the worst fear of big-time, match-play golf?</LD>
<LD>   It's a star-power outage.</LD>
<LD>   Usually, the best you can hope for is that the stars make it to
the weekend, but Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and David Duval didn't
make it past Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   On opening day, the $5.5-million Accenture Match Play Championship
lost its No. 1-ranked player and top attraction when Woods was
upended by Peter O'Malley of Australia, 2 and 1. Then, a couple of
minutes later, second-ranked Mickelson was also gone, escorted to the
door by John Cook, who birdied three of his last five holes.</TE>
<TE>   And soon after, third-ranked Duval lost to Kevin Sutherland in 20
holes. If you're keeping score, that's one, two, three and out.
Thanks for coming and enjoy the rest of your week.</TE>
<TE>   As far as carnage goes, there may have been worse days, only
nobody could recall any. Still, things could be worse. In spite of
what happened, at least nobody's waking up this morning to the $1.98
Accenture Match Play Championship.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, there cannot be much joy at ABC, where expectations for
the weekend TV ratings have officially been downgraded to
cooking-show status.</TE>
<TE>   It was left to Sergio Garcia to stick a plug in the thing, which
the fourth-ranked player accomplished when he defeated Lee Janzen, 3
and 2, thus setting up an intriguing second-round match against
another precocious 22-year-old, Charles Howell III.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia had his own spin on what transpired Wednesday at La Costa.
"It shows how good the field is," he said. "If you don't play well,
you're not going to win. I heard Tiger made only one birdie, and
that's not good enough. It shows that all the players are improving
and are not afraid of anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Woods said afterward that La Costa's soft, bumpy greens could
stand a bit of improvement, but he also indicated he hadn't played
all that poorly even though he lost so soon. Said Woods: "It's not
the greatest of feelings."</TE>
<TE>   At least Woods stopped to offer a few comments, while Mickelson
left the place so quickly, his visor nearly spun off his head. "I
can't explain it," he said of his 3-and-2 loss to Cook.</TE>
<TE>   Hey, some things are like that.</TE>
<TE>   Colin Montgomerie probably felt the same way after Scott McCarron
dropped a hole-in-one on him at No. 14. "Yes, well, that was
unfortunate," Montgomerie said.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, truly. McCarron's shot caromed off the back of a bunker at
the 204-yard par-three and the ball rolled straight in the hole.
Montgomerie also banked his ball off the bunker, but it stopped
rolling about two feet from the hole. McCarron's birdie three holes
later ended it for Montgomerie.</TE>
<TE>   Woods didn't get his lone birdie until the 16th hole, when he was
already three holes down. Woods shook his fist after getting a
25-foot putt to fall, but he was still reeling. Trailing by two holes
at the 17th, Woods knocked his approach four feet above the hole
while O'Malley was 25 feet away, on the left center of the green.</TE>
<TE>   O'Malley hit his putt and while the ball moved slowly on its way
to the hole, Woods started walking toward where he had marked his
ball. He got there just as O'Malley's ball fell into the hole with
one last roll. All Woods could do was take off his cap and
congratulate O'Malley.</TE>
<TE>   O'Malley, the 64th and lowest-seeded player in the field, made a
critical birdie with a 15-foot putt at the 15th.</TE>
<TE>   "It probably wasn't until I holed that putt that I thought I could
win the match," he said. "I had no pressure on me whatsoever because
no one expected me to win."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, everybody expects Woods to win. But it's something he
has yet to accomplish in 2002. He has played only four times and he
tied for 10th at the Mercedes, tied for 12th at Pebble Beach, tied
for fifth at Torrey Pines, then had his La Costa experience. Woods
may adjust his schedule to play at Doral next week, but he hasn't
made up his mind. What he is certain about is that La Costa's greens
weren't very good.</TE>
<TE>   "I hit good putts," he said. "Some of the putts I hit really well,
they just didn't break. A lot of the time, they were in the air
bouncing. I got more mileage over the greens than I do when I travel
all over the country."</TE>
<TE>   There were some routs recorded, but not many. Rocco Mediate
defeated John Daly, 5 and 4, Brad Faxon dusted Kenny Perry, 7 and 6,
and Steve Lowery sent home Scott Hoch, 5 and 4, the same score by
which Paul McGinley defeated Joe Durant.</TE>
<TE>   It also wasn't a particularly good day for the last two defending
champions, with Steve Stricker and Darren Clarke losing. Duval
probably played well enough to win, shooting four under, but
Sutherland birdied the 17th and 18th holes to tie the match, then won
with a birdie on the 20th hole. In three appearances, Duval has lost
in the semifinals, the second round and now the first round.</TE>
<TE>   "This is probably worse," he said. "It's tough anytime you play
good and you don't win. I got beat. Kevin stepped up to the plate and
hit the shots, so you have to give him credit."</TE>
<TE>   Jose Maria Olazabal, who defeated Justin Leonard, 1-up, meets
Retief Goosen in the second round today. Besides Garcia-Howell,
another interesting matchup is Ernie Els vs. Tom Lehman.</TE>
<TE>   Woods is planning his next event, whatever that might be,
remembering he had previously reached at least the quarterfinals in
this tournament. Woods had an explanation for it.</TE>
<TE>   "It can happen out there."</TE>

<LD>Finding a weak link in the Santa Margarita girls' water polo team is
nearly impossible.</LD>
<LD>   The top-seeded Eagles turned in another strong effort Wednesday in
a Division I semifinal game, defeating Long Beach Wilson, 8-3, at the
Los Alamitos Armed Forces Center.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Margarita (25-3) will play second-seeded Santa Ana Foothill
in the championship game Saturday at 6 p.m. at Belmont Plaza in Long
Beach.</LD>
<TE>   It will be a rematch of last season's Division I title game, won
by Foothill, 7-6, in overtime and last month's Southern California
Invitational, won by Santa Margarita, 7-6.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know what can happen in the final," said Santa
Margarita senior Kristina Kunkel, who scored three goals to equal
Erika Figge for the team high. "It doesn't matter that we already
beat them this season."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Margarita surged to a 6-2 halftime lead against the Bruins,
converting all of their shots. Wilson goalkeeper Kendall Cheak, who
was instrumental in an 8-7 quarterfinal victory over Lake Forest El
Toro on Saturday, didn't get her first saves until 5:45 remained in
the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Margarita held Wilson (17-10) scoreless in the second half
until Cassie Azevedo scored with 45 seconds remaining, one of the few
shots on goal for the Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Arritt</TE>

<TE>   Santa Ana Foothill 8, Newport Harbor 6--Gabbie Domanic scored five
goals for second-seeded Foothill (26-2) in a Division I semifinal at
Tustin High. Third-seeded Newport Harbor (23-7) cut the lead to 6-5
on third-quarter goals by Katherine Belden, Jenna Murphy and Annie
Wight.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy and Wight each scored two goals.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara 8, Agoura 7--Rosie Godlis broke a 7-7 tie with a
four-meter penalty shot with 3:18 remaining in a Division II
semifinal at North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake High. Lauren Lohnberg
scored four goals for fourth-seeded Agoura (23-8), which played Santa
Barbara in the last two Division II finals.</TE>
<TE>   Lauren Boreta, Molly Cahill and Miranda Nichols each scored two
goals for top-seeded Santa Barbara, which will play Ventura in the
final Saturday at Belmont Plaza.</TE>
<TE>   Placentia El Dorado 5, Irvine University 4--Lauren Benson scored
the game-winning goal with just under three minutes remaining in a
Division IV semifinal at Irvine's Heritage Park.</TE>
<TE>   El Dorado (15-13) will play top-seeded Corona del Mar in the final
Saturday at Belmont Plaza.</TE>

<HD>Search Is On for Derby Candidates</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Trainers are scrambling to come up with
3-year-olds capable of handling the 11/4-mile race at Churchill
Downs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trainer Wayne Lukas may not run a horse in the Kentucky Derby for
only the second time in 22 years. Bob Baffert, who has run 11 horses
in the Derby in the last six years and won the race twice, is
scrambling. This is how tough it is this year for a horseman to find
a 3-year-old that might be capable of running 11/4 miles at Churchill
Downs on May 4.</LD>
<LD>   In Florida, trainer Ken McPeek may have two shots to fire in the
128th Derby, and Nick Zito, like Lukas and Baffert as much a part of
the Derby as the mint julep, is lurking in the Gulfstream Park bushes
with a pair of understated prospects. But in most precincts a trainer
will be content with one solid contender. The trick is to pick the
right prep races and hope that the horse gets to Louisville snorting
for more.</LD>
<LD>   The Blood-Horse magazine lists 37 stakes races for 3-year-olds
between now and Derby day, but realistically, Derby winners come from
three preps: the Florida Derby at Gulfstream, the Blue Grass Stakes
at Keeneland and the Santa Anita Derby. The only exceptions in the
last 16 years are Fusaichi Pegasus, who won the Wood Memorial in
2000; Grindstone, winner of the Louisiana Derby in 1996; and Lil E.
Tee, who ran in the Arkansas Derby in 1992.</LD>
<TE>   A couple of races not even included on the Blood-Horse list--the
United Arab Emirates Derby in Dubai and the Gladness Stakes at the
Curragh near Dublin--became options for Kentucky Derby hopefuls this
week. The day after McPeek's Repent, with a devastating move down a
long stretch not unlike Churchill's, won the Risen Star Stakes at the
New Orleans Fair Grounds, his trainer kicked around the possibility
of sending the colt all the way to Dubai for the $2-million race next
month.</TE>
<TE>   But by Wednesday McPeek had talked with other trainers and decided
to keep Repent stateside. While the money in Dubai is enormous--the
Kentucky Derby is worth only $1 million--there's the matter of the
13,000-mile round trip, not an easy journey even for a colt like
Repent, who reportedly can snooze anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   "Going over there would compromise the horse's Derby chances,"
said McPeek, who will zero in on the Louisiana Derby, the Spiral
Stakes or the Illinois Derby for Repent. McPeek's other horse,
Harlan's Holiday, missed by a nose winning the Fountain of Youth at
Gulfstream on Saturday and is expected to run in the Florida Derby,
possibly with a big-name jockey replacing Tony D'Amico.</TE>
<TE>   The Gladness Stakes in April would seem, at about seven furlongs
on the grass, to be a preposterous final Derby prep for Johannesburg,
who hasn't run since winning the Breeders' Cup Juvenile-- his dirt
debut--in October at Belmont Park. Michael Tabor, winner of the 1995
Derby with Thunder Gulch and one of Johannesburg's owners, is also
looking askance at this strategy.</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't exactly ideal, is it?" Tabor said. "I'm sure we'll get
castigated if it doesn't work out, but I don't train the horses, I
just pay the bills."</TE>
<TE>   Morvich, a California-bred, won the Derby in his first start as a
3-year-old, but that was in 1922. Since 1955, only seven horses have
run in the Derby off just one start as a 3-year-old, the best of them
finishing sixth.</TE>
<TE>   The Fountain of Youth winner, the pocket-sized Booklet, doesn't
have the scope, the pedigree or the running style to win a Derby, but
in the hands of trainer John Ward Jr., jockey Jorge Chavez and owner
John Oxley, the colt's following is growing. This is the same crew
that won the Derby with Monarchos last year. Booklet had already been
sold three times--before he raced--when Oxley bought him after he had
won five of six starts as a 2-year-old. The Fountain of Youth was
Booklet's second consecutive victory since Ward took over.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago at this time, Baffert was sitting on two powderkegs in
Point Given and Congaree, who seemed capable of running 1-2 in the
Derby. The day didn't play out that way, Congaree finishing third and
Point Given fifth, but Point Given won the Preakness and the Belmont,
the other races in the Triple Crown, and on Monday was announced as
the horse-of-the-year champion.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about his Derby prospects several weeks ago, Baffert said:
"Maybe we'll have to be like the New England Patriots, and win one in
the snow to keep us going." Since then, no Point Givens in the rough
have emerged. Baffert's best hope, Danthebluegrassman, would be more
inspiring if the victories in his last two races had come at Santa
Anita instead of Golden Gate Fields. Owned by Mike Pegram, who won
the 1998 Derby with the Baffert-trained Real Quiet,
Danthebluegrassman worked five furlongs Wednesday in a quick 584/5 at
Santa Anita and will run next in either the El Camino Real Derby at
Golden Gate on March 9 or San Anita's San Felipe on March 17.</TE>
<TE>   The San Rafael at Santa Anita on March 2 is the next objective for
Came Home, who was undefeated before his seventh-place finish against
Johannesburg, Repent and Siphonic in the Breeders' Cup. Came Home,
winner of the seven-furlong San Vicente on Feb. 2, would seem to have
distance limitations, but one of his owners, John Toffan, isn't
completely convinced.</TE>
<TE>   "The way he works, maybe it's possible to stretch him out," Toffan
said. "They've caught him galloping out in 1:38 [for a mile], and he
finished strong in his last race. Until he's asked to run farther, we
won't know."</TE>
<TE>   Off three victories last year and his third-place finish in the
Breeders' Cup, Siphonic started the year as California's best Derby
prospect, but in his debut as a 3-year-old, he almost fell leaving
the gate and finished second to Labamta Babe. Trainer David Hofmans
missed a workout last weekend with the colt, who was running a slight
temperature, but hopes to work him five furlongs either Friday or
Saturday in preparation for the San Felipe Stakes on March 17.</TE>
<TE>   Labamta Babe was injured and has been taken off the Triple Crown
trail. Meantime, his owner and trainer, Edmund Gann and Bobby
Frankel, have dipped into the surplus at Oaklawn Park to buy Medaglia
D'Oro, a lightly raced colt. Medaglia D'Oro only recently broke his
maiden and has yet to be nominated for the Triple Crown races.</TE>

<LD>Thanks primarily to upset victories by 24-1 shot Lucayan Chief and
15-1 outsider Entrancing on Monday at Santa Anita, there is a
pick-six carryover of more than $186,000 for today and it spices up
an otherwise ordinary card.</LD>
<LD>   After scratches, only 48 horses are left to run in the six races
in the sequence and there could be more withdrawals this morning.</LD>
<LD>   The shortest price in the pick six will probably be B Swift, who
will break from the rail in the eighth and final race, a 51/2-furlong
dash for $25,000 maiden claimers. Second in his last two, the
4-year-old gelding will be making his first start for trainer Mike
Mitchell.</LD>
<TE>   The pick six kicks off with the third, a sprint for $25,000
3-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The seventh features Grand Appointment--a
tough-luck second to repeat winner J.T.'s Song in his last
race--going for his second career victory for the hot team of jockey
Alex Solis and trainer Bruce Headley.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: John Little. The gelded son of Blushing John has found
a home on Aqueduct's inner dirt track. He has won three in a row by a
combined 223/4 lengths. He will break from the rail in today's eighth
at Aqueduct.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Mr. Joe C, considered a contender by some in today's
seventh at Santa Anita, is 0 for 14 since the beginning of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking:  A trifecta in the sixth using Departure Time
on top to Yankee Pirate, Happy Hero and Crowning Point in the two
hole and all in the third spot.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/119. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $8.60/$725.60. Total money bet: $700.</TE>

<HD>Ishii Arrives Ahead of Game</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: Saying he's more excited than nervous, Japanese
left-hander claims he could pitch now.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>After a monthlong contract negotiation, numerous delays obtaining a
U.S. visa and a 14-hour flight from Tokyo, Japanese left-hander
Kazuhisa Ishii finally arrived in Dodgertown on Wednesday night and
will take part in his first workout today.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not so nervous, I'm more excited," Ishii, 28, said through an
interpreter. "I hope I don't cause any trouble by being late. I've
been practicing hard, so it won't take long to get ready."</LD>
<LD>   Ishii is far ahead of his new teammates--he threw 130 pitches off
a mound Tuesday, three times as many as Dodger pitchers have thrown
during workouts the first week.</LD>
<TE>   Ishii said he could pitch in a game this week, and he's ready for
the challenge of facing major league hitters.</TE>
<TE>   "In all aspects, the players here are at the highest level," Ishii
said. "Other than that, there's not that big a difference except for
having sunflower seeds on the floor of the dugout. We're not allowed
to spit in the dugout in Japan."</TE>
<TE>   Some 15-20 media members greeted Ishii at the airport in Orlando,
and another dozen or so captured his arrival at Dodgertown.</TE>
<TE>   A bigger media crowd is expected today, though probably not as
huge as the one that followed fellow Japanese pitcher Hideo Nomo when
he joined the Dodgers in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure there will be a few cameramen," Manager Jim Tracy said,
"and I hope we have enough rope around to keep them in the right
areas."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii, who had a 78-46 career record and 3.38 earned-run average
in 10 seasons in Japan, is concerned about his media following
becoming a distraction in camp.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many media," he said. "I don't want to cause any
problems."</TE>
<TE>   Dodger General Manager Dan Evans, who traveled with Ishii to Tokyo
for a news conference after the Dodgers signed him to a four-year,
$12.2-million contract on Feb. 8, doesn't foresee any problems.</TE>
<TE>   "He was swarmed in Japan, and he handled it so well; he's so used
to it," Evans said. "I don't think a lot of people realize what a big
deal this is for his people. Having been there, I didn't realize the
magnitude until I saw it. He was a front-page story everywhere over
there."</TE>

<HD>Lakers Aren't Likely to Alter the Roster</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Today is the trading deadline in the NBA. If you're a Laker fan, you
might not have even noticed.</LD>
<LD>   Why would you?</LD>
<LD>   No trade rumors are swirling around the team, no speculation about
any player being on the bubble.</LD>
<TE>   The Lakers have made it plain for some time now that, barring some
ridiculous offer like Paul Pierce for Jelani McCoy or Allen Iverson
for a draft choice, they will not be making a deal.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the reason was thought to be the Lakers' determination not
to trigger the luxury tax by going over the salary limit. League
sources now say that there may be no luxury tax this year because of
increased league revenue streams.</TE>
<TE>   But even if that's true, the Lakers will not make a move because
nothing out there excites them.</TE>
<TE>   "We like our team," Laker General Manager Mitch Kupchak said.
"There is not an obvious player out there we can add considering we
would have to subtract a player.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had some calls from other teams, but that goes along with
the territory this time of year."</TE>
<TE>   So the Lakers you see are the Lakers you will undoubtedly get for
the rest of this season.</TE>
<TE>   In the heady days of November and early December, it didn't seem
like it could get much better. Even though Derek Fisher and Mark
Madsen began the season on the injured list, the team won 16 of its
first 17 games, Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant had joined a mutual
admiration society, and the only question seemed to be whether the
Lakers could break the Chicago Bulls' record by winning 73
regular-season games.</TE>
<TE>   How the mighty have tumbled.</TE>
<TE>   Since that high point, the Lakers have looked very ordinary, going
19-15. Tuesday night's loss to the Boston Celtics represented a
low-water mark for Coach Phil Jackson, his first three-game losing
streak in this, his third season in Los Angeles. O'Neal's feud with
Bryant may be over, but O'Neal's problem with the big toe on his
right foot makes for an uncertain future. He has already been forced
to take two stints on the injured list because of the toe and may
need yet another before the postseason begins.</TE>
<TE>   In O'Neal's absences, the Lakers have looked horrible at times at
both ends of the court. They lost to the Bulls, the worst team in the
league, fell 20 points behind the Washington Wizards before rallying
to win, and left their offense in the locker room in the first half
against the Atlanta Hawks, scoring only 35 points.</TE>
<TE>   Wait till O'Neal gets back, the optimists said. He returned
Tuesday night and the Lakers blew an 18-point, third-quarter lead
against Boston.</TE>
<TE>   "If the playoffs started now, we would be fine," O'Neal said
before Tuesday's game.</TE>
<TE>   That's the theory. The Lakers figure they can turn it on when the
postseason begins. That's what they did last season.</TE>
<TE>   After all, they've got O'Neal and Bryant, arguably the two best
players in the league. So who needs to worry about a trading
deadline?</TE>

<HD>Recovering Murray to Miss Kings' Practice</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Coach, who expected to rejoin team today, suffering
from post-concussion syndrome after accident.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>King Coach Andy Murray, suffering from post-concussion syndrome after
Friday's single-car accident in Wisconsin, will not be with the team
this morning when it resumes practicing after a seven-day Olympic
break.</LD>
<LD>   Murray, who had been scheduled to fly into Los Angeles late
Wednesday night from his home in Faribault,  Minn., was advised by
his doctors to rest for 48 hours after experiencing severe headaches
and vomiting late Tuesday night.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier Tuesday, the coach had said he was feeling much better
after a difficult weekend and was eager to get back to work.</LD>
<TE>   Assistant coaches Dave Tippett, Mark Hardy and Ray Bennett will
run practice in his absence, with Murray scheduled to rejoin the
Kings on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed," Murray said Wednesday night after a short
hospital visit earlier in the day. "I've never really missed a
practice before in my coaching career that I can remember. But I also
know that things will be well planned and that with Dave and Ray and
Mark ... the players are in good hands."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to a concussion, Murray suffered four broken ribs, a
separated left shoulder and numerous cuts and scrapes early Friday
morning when the truck he was driving skidded off icy Interstate 90
outside of Sparta, Wis.</TE>
<TE>   The coach was en route from Faribault  to Madison, Wis., to watch
his 17-year-old son, Braden, play in a high school hockey tournament
when he lost control of the truck. The vehicle was demolished after
crashing through a wire fence and rolling several times down an
embankment through a wooded area.</TE>
<TE>   After a tree stopped the truck only a few feet from the edge of a
trout stream, Murray kicked out a window and crawled out of the
wreckage.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, minus their coach and four Olympians, return to
practice this morning in El Segundo in preparation for the resumption
of their season Tuesday night against the Columbus Blue Jackets at
Columbus, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Olympians Mattias Norstrom, Mikko Eloranta, Adam Deadmarsh and
Aaron Miller are not due to report back to the Kings until Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Ryan Flinn, assigned to the team's minor league affiliate
at Manchester, N.H., during the Olympic break, is expected to rejoin
the Kings today.</TE>

<HD>Rose, With New Team, Just as Sweet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All Jalen Rose needed was one game to feel better about his trade to
the Chicago Bulls.</LD>
<LD>   Rose scored 36 points, including 13 in the fourth quarter, to lead
a comeback as the Bulls beat the New York Knicks, 113-109, Wednesday
night at Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   He admitted that he wasn't overjoyed about being sent from Indiana
to a last-place team Tuesday in a seven-player trade. But he was in a
better frame of mind after a winning debut.</LD>
<TE>   "I have to send Indiana a thank-you card," Rose said. "It's a
blessing to be in a city that believes in you and is starved for a
championship."</TE>
<TE>   Rose, who came to Chicago with Travis Best, was 13 for 24 from the
field and 10 for 11 from the free-throw line. He led a depleted
Bulls' team which had only eight players available in the second
half.</TE>
<TE>   "People who said that this trade wasn't going to work because
Jalen was going to come over here and pout, they're wrong. He's too
much of a competitor for that," said the Bulls' Fred Hoiberg. "This
game shows something about his character."</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 114, Golden State 107--Allen Iverson scored 46
points, reaching 40 for the fifth time this season and the 38th time
in his career as the 76ers defeated the turnover-prone Warriors at
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Danny Fortson had 18 for the Warriors, who kept the game close for
much of the fourth quarter but repeatedly made mistakes, including
sloppy turnovers and ill-advised shots after coming up with defensive
stops and blocked shots on several 76er possessions.</TE>
<TE>   Golden State blocked three shots in the span of a minute with less
than four minutes left, each leading to a possession that ended with
a turnover or a miss.</TE>
<TE>   The Warriors lost their fourth in a row overall, ninth straight on
the road and 19th in 22 games.</TE>
<TE>   Utah 110, Denver 99--Andrei Kirilenko and Scott Padgett scored 21
points each as the Jazz fought off a late Nugget surge at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Six Utah players scored in double figures to lead the Jazz to its
sixth straight victory.</TE>
<TE>   Nick Van Exel, the Nuggets' leading scorer who has thrown the team
into turmoil with his trade demand, did not play for the fifth
straight game because of an inflamed elbow.</TE>
<TE>   Portland 90, Seattle 84--Rasheed Wallace made two shots and two
free throws in the final 2:16 at Seattle as the Trail Blazers beat
the SuperSonics for the third time in three games this season.</TE>
<TE>   The SuperSonics lost for the first time in four games since Vin
Baker was sidelined with three dislocated toes on his left foot.</TE>
<TE>   Rashard Lewis scored 24 points for Seattle, which forced the Trail
Blazers to commit 17 turnovers. But the SuperSonics missed eight
consecutive shots before Brent Barry converted an offensive rebound
with 3.2 seconds to go.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte 78, Toronto 77--Elden Campbell scored 18 points, and
Jamal Mashburn 15 for the Hornets at Toronto. Baron Davis had 17
points for the Hornets, who have won four of five since the All-Star
break.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto's Antonio Davis had a season-high 29 points and 14
rebounds for the Raptors, who have lost six straight since Vince
Carter went on the injured list with a quadriceps strain.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 97, Washington 90--Corliss Williamson scored 22 points and
fellow reserve Damon Jones added a season-high 17 as the Pistons beat
the Michael Jordan-less Wizards at Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   The Pistons won their fourth in a row and 11th in 13 games. At
30-22, they are eight games over .500 for the first time since
mid-December.</TE>
<TE>   The Wizards have lost both games that Jordan (knee) has missed
this season. He is expected to be back in the lineup at home tonight
against New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit was without starting center Cliff Robinson, who was
suspended for one game by the NBA for a year-old DUI offense.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 115, Houston 76--Michael Redd scored a career-high 29
points, 26 in the fourth quarter, as the Bucks won in a rout at
Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Redd made nine of 13 shots from three-point range, doing most of
his damage after Milwaukee built a big lead. Sam Cassell returned
from a toe injury to score 16 points and hand out seven assists in
three quarters.</TE>
<TE>   The Bucks led by as many as 49 points in the second half, so Coach
George Karl was able to rest Cassell and the rest of his regulars.</TE>

<HD>Boston Acquires Delk, Rogers From Phoenix</HD>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Boston Celtics, hoping to boost their offense for a playoff run,
acquired guard Tony Delk and forward Rodney Rogers in a five-player
trade with the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Suns received forward Joe Johnson, Boston's first pick in last
year's NBA draft and the 10th pick overall, as well as backup guards
Milt Palacio and Randy Brown, and a first-round draft pick in this
year's draft.</LD>
<LD>   Delk, a 6-foot-2 guard and five-season veteran out of Kentucky,
was averaging 10.6 points this season for Phoenix. Rogers, a 6-7
forward in his eighth season out of Wake Forest, started seven of
Phoenix's 50 games, averaging 12.6 points and 4.8 rebounds.</LD>
<TE>   Johnson, who came out of Arkansas as an underclassman, started 33
of 48 games for Boston this season, averaging 6.3 points. Palacio was
averaging 3.7 points as a backup guard, and Brown has played in just
one game during an injury-plagued season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix guard Stephon Marbury had a higher blood-alcohol content
than initially reported after his recent DUI arrest, according to
police at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   A blood test taken the night Marbury was arrested indicated the
basketball star had a blood-alcohol content of 0.18, police Sgt. Doug
Dirren said.</TE>
<TE>   The initial test, measured with a hand-held breath tester,
indicated his blood-alcohol content was 0.153, the police said. The
state's legal limit is 0.08.</TE>
<TE>   Marbury was arrested on Feb. 8 and booked on charges of extreme
driving under the influence, driving under the influence and
speeding.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago Bulls activated point guard Greg Anthony and put Norm
Richardson on the injured list.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony missed 14 games with a partial tear of his right Achilles'
tendon.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson, acquired with Jalen Rose in Tuesday's trade with the
Indiana Pacers, has a left ankle sprain.</TE>

<LD>Jon Gruden likes what he's seen of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He
won't, however, guarantee a Super Bowl right away.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not going to make a lot of bold predictions at this time. All
I can guarantee is a lot of hard work and effort," the 38-year-old
coach said after being formally introduced Wednesday at Tampa, Fla.,
as the seventh coach in team history.</LD>
<LD>   The sons of team owner Malcolm Glazer lured Gruden from the
Oakland Raiders early Monday, ending a long, sometimes embarrassing
search for a replacement for Tony Dungy.</LD>
<TE>   Gruden, who had one year left on his contract with the Raiders,
received a five-year deal worth about $17.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a good job in Oakland. We won some games there. I was fully
content to continue to work with the Oakland Raiders and hopefully
take our team further in the playoffs," Gruden said.</TE>
<TE>   The Kansas City Chiefs and free-agent safety Clint Finley agreed
to a two-year contract. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.... The
Washington Redskins hired George Catavolos as defensive backs coach,
filling out the coaching spots on Steve Spurrier's staff.</TE>

<TE>   Top-seeded Venus Williams rolled past Anna Kournikova, 6-2, 7-6

Dubai, United Arab Emirates.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, who has won three tournaments this year, next plays
Anastasia Myskina.</TE>
<TE>   Monica Seles, seeded second, beat Tathiana Garbin, 6-2, 6-3; No. 3
Amelie Mauresmo beat Emmanuelle Gagliardi, 6-3, 6-2, and Tamarine

<TE>   Top-seeded Tommy Haas needed three sets to beat Jan Vacek of the
Czech Republic, 6-3, 5-7, 6-4, in his opening match at the Kroger St.
Jude tournament at Memphis, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   American Andy Roddick, seeded second, controlled his booming serve
and beat Lars Burgsmuller of Germany, 6-2, 6-3 in 58 minutes.</TE>

<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   An autopsy on the limousine driver shot at former NBA star Jayson
Williams' mansion confirmed the death was not a suicide, a medical
examiner at Piscataway, N.J., said.</TE>
<TE>   Costas Christofi died from a gunshot "at intermediate range,"
Hunterdon County medical examiner Steven Diamond said.</TE>
<TE>   Diamond, still waiting for toxicology results, declined to discuss
the angle of the wound or whether there was any appearance of a
struggle. He said the death is officially listed as a homicide, the
legal term for a killing that does not indicate whether it was
intentional or accidental.</TE>
<TE>   Acting Hunterdon County Prosecutor Steven C. Lember said Tuesday
that no decision has been made on whether charges will be filed.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Hampton, elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame this month,

DWI arrest in five years.</TE>
<TE>   Financially ailing Kmart Corp. has reached agreement with
organizers of the Daytona 500 to withdraw as a corporate sponsor of

<HD>Arizona Recovers in Time for 83-75 Victory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TUCSON, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>Salim Stoudamire could see what was happening--caught up in their
dislike of Arizona State, his Arizona teammates were letting the game
slip away.</LD>
<LD>   The freshman came to the rescue, scoring the last two baskets for
the 14th-ranked Wildcats as they held on to beat the Sun Devils,
83-75, Wednesday night, four weeks after they were stunned by a loss
in Tempe.</LD>
<LD>   Stoudamire, who had 24 points, said a scuffle that resulted in the
ejection of an Arizona State player took the Wildcats out of their
game.</LD>
<TE>   "I think we were going down and trying to get them back after what
happened instead of going down and playing our game," he said. "In
the first half, we were tough, and then we got into that altercation,
and I thought we tried to focus on getting them back instead of
winning the game."</TE>
<TE>   Stoudamire made a three-point basket that made the score 72-66
with 4:28 left, and tipped in a miss by Luke Walton with 41 seconds
to play that gave the Wildcats a 78-73 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Wildcats rode out the victory at the free-throw line, glad to
be there after allowing Arizona State to recover from an 18-point
deficit in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona, 18-8 overall and 11-5 in the Pac-10, had lost to UCLA and
USC in Los Angeles over the weekend and was trying to avoid losing
three consecutive regular-season games for the first time since
1983-84.</TE>
<TE>   "This definitely was a battle," Coach Lute Olson said. "I give ASU
a lot of credit for the way they battled. ASU is a tough team, and
they work hard and defend hard. They make it difficult for teams to
run their plays."</TE>
<TE>   Rick Anderson scored 17 points and Jason Gardner had 16  for
Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Chad Prewitt had 15 points for the Sun Devils (14-11, 7-9).</TE>
<TE>   With 6:01 left in the first half, Arizona State's Kyle Dodd, a
reserve guard, piled on while teammate Chris Osborne and Walton were
wrestling for a rebound.</TE>
<TE>   After a scuffle, Dodd was ejected, and Stoudamire made two
technical free throws for a 39-21 lead, Arizona's biggest of the
game.</TE>

<LD>The Van Nuys Grant boys' soccer team is heading to the quarterfinals
of the City Section playoffs for the second consecutive season after
a 1-0 victory over host Sylmar in a second-round game Wednesday. But
if one listened to Grant Coach Frank Ortiz afterward, the victory was
as important for the Sunset Six League, of which Grant is a member,
as it was for the Lancers (15-4-2).</LD>
<LD>   "Our league doesn't get the respect it deserves," Ortiz said.
"This game should have been played at Grant, but [Sylmar was seeded]
higher because they play in what is supposed to be a tougher league."</LD>
<LD>   Grant, the Sunset Six League champion, was seeded ninth in the
32-team tournament with Valley Mission League runner-up Sylmar
(20-6-4) eighth.</LD>
<TE>   The Lancers, who lost to L.A. University, 2-1, in the
quarterfinals last year, will play at top-seeded and defending
champion Woodland Hills El Camino Real (22-3-3) on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Grant, which beat Carson, 2-1, in double overtime in the first
round, scored the only goal of Wednesday's game at the six-minute
mark when Johny Amaya took a pass from Melkin Morejon, dribbled past
a Sylmar defender and beat goalkeeper Jose Diaz with a soft shot into
the left corner of the net.</TE>
<TE>   "He gave me a nice pass and thanks to God, I was able to score,"
said Amaya, who has a team-high 27 goals this season.</TE>

<TE>   Rendich, a senior midfielder, scored from 10 yards after taking a
pass through the penalty box from Megan Lurty.</TE>
<TE>   The Cowboys (16-0-6) will face the Claremont-Sultana winner in the
quarterfinals Friday after eliminating a Buena team that was unseeded
and much different from the ones that won and shared the last two
Division II titles.</TE>
<TE>   Buena (11-8-5) outshot Canyon, 16-12, and stayed with the Cowboys
by winning most contested balls and absorbing Canyon fouls, which led
to 23 free kicks. Canyon goalkeeper Lyndsay Taylor made 10 saves,

<DH>On First Day With Braves, Gary Sheffield Uncorks Shots at
Dodgers</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Gary Sheffield praised his new club Wednesday--and reminded his
former team why it was eager to get rid of him.</LD>
<LD>   While lauding the Atlanta Braves for understanding "what this game
is all about" in his first day of spring training here, Sheffield
continued to criticize the Dodgers, who traded him to the Braves last
month for outfielder Brian Jordan and left-handed pitcher Odalis
Perez.</LD>
<LD>   Manager Jim Tracy was Sheffield's latest target as the All-Star
outfielder reflected on his final frustrating season with the
Dodgers. Saying that Tracy hurt the club by fawning over right
fielder Shawn Green, Sheffield also implied that the manager bowed to
pressure from front-office officials and structured the batting order
to help Green at the expense of the team.</LD>
<TE>   Sheffield contends that Tracy had him and Green split time between
the cleanup and third spots only to make Green comfortable. He said
the Dodgers "showed favoritism" to Green because they were determined
to justify giving him a six-year, $84-million contract after Green
struggled in the first year of the deal. Tracy, not commenting
specifically on Sheffield's interpretation of events, has said he
stresses team performance over individual statistics.</TE>
<TE>   The Green situation was the final straw for Sheffield, whose
Dodger experience ended in disgust. He's hoping for better days with
the talented and close-knit Braves, but couldn't resist a few
partingshots before slamming the door.</TE>
<TE>   "I always wanted to play for the Braves, I always wanted to be
with an organization that knows about winning, but I never let myself
think about it because I didn't want to be disappointed," Sheffield
said. "When you play this game long enough, you know that things that
you want to happen usually don't happen, so I just tried to forget
about it. Then [agent] Scott [Boras] told me about the deal and I
knew I needed this.</TE>
<TE>   "I just didn't want to be with the Dodgers anymore because of
everything. One of the things I told my wife [DeLeon], when we heard
all the [off-season trade] rumors, was that I didn't know what was
going to happen but I just didn't want to play for an organization
that did the things they did. I don't have any bitter moments or
memories, I'm where I want to be, but I just didn't want to be
there."</TE>
<TE>   Well, maybe one bitter memory.</TE>
<TE>   Sheffield still seems upset about last season, believing the
lineup was altered for the wrong reason.</TE>
<TE>   Primarily batting cleanup behind Sheffield in 2000, Green hit .269
with 24 home runs, 99 runs batted in and 98 runs. Sheffield hit 43
homers, matching what was then the franchise record, and batted .325
with 109 RBIs and 105 runs.</TE>
<TE>   With the roles interchangeable in 2001, Green took off. He batted
.297, established a franchise mark with 49 homers, and led the team
with 125 RBIs and 121 runs. Sheffield had another strong season
despite playing with a sprained left index finger, batting .311 with
36 homers, 100 RBIs and 98 runs.</TE>
<TE>   Batting third, Green hit .323 (85 for 263) with 21 homers and 52
RBIs. In the cleanup spot, he batted .289 (84 for 291) with 27 homers
and 70 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Sheffield batted .295 (81 for 275) with 20 homers and 46 RBIs in
his favorite spot. His average increased to .329 (79 for 240) when he
hit fourth, and he had 16 homers and 54 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Considering that they both thrived, what's Sheffield's problem?</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about how you approach it and what your goals are as a
team," he said. "I have no problem batting wherever you want me to
bat, but it has to be for the right reasons. It has to be to make the
team better; it's not about one guy's numbers. You have to put that
aside if you want to win. Third or fourth--it doesn't matter to me.
It's all about the team.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing [Atlanta Manager] Bobby Cox said to me was,
'Where do you want to bat?' He showed me the respect of a player who
has been in the big leagues for [14] years. That's all you want. I
told Bobby that I would bat fourth because [All-Star outfielder]
Chipper [Jones] shouldn't have to move [from third]. He should be
comfortable because that's best for the team.</TE>
<TE>   "Chipper also told Bobby he would bat fourth, because we put the
numbers aside. We don't care who drives in the runs as long as we
win."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers again took the high road regarding Sheffield.</TE>
<TE>   "We all did a tremendous job of handling the [season-long
Sheffield situation], dealing with it, putting it behind us and
keeping the focus on the baseball field," Tracy said. "I like the
idea of everybody in the group participating, feeling that the
individual accolades will come with winning.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like to think of being involved with any club where an
individual agenda needs to be addressed, because that's not what I'm
about. [Sheffield] went between the lines and gave us what he had;
that's all a manager can ask of his players. I don't want to dwell on
it anymore. I did the very best I could with that situation."</TE>
<TE>   Said Green: "I have respect for Sheff on the field and I have no
problems with him. If he has a problem with me, you'd have to talk
with him about that."</TE>
<TE>   Many in the Dodger organization believe Sheffield pouted--even
quit playing hard late in the season--because of Green's success.
Starter Kevin Brown is one of only a few players who still speak
highly of Sheffield.</TE>
<TE>   "How can I not be disappointed to see him go?" Brown said. "I've
played with Gary for more than a few years.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen what he does on the field and what he brings to the
team. He's going to be missed. I'll miss him, no doubt about it."</TE>
<TE>   The Braves are happy to have Sheffield, believing he could be the
difference in holding off the improved New York Mets in the National
League East.</TE>
<TE>   Sheffield is expected to bolster an offense that finished 13th in
the league in runs, providing protection for the switch-hitting Jones
and improving the batting order.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll probably see one or two more fastballs every at-bat," Jones
said. "What I'm looking for is hitter's counts in crucial situations.
In the last couple of years, when I got into a hitter's count, I was
pitched around. I don't see me getting pitched around to get to Gary
Sheffield."</TE>
<TE>   Said Cox: "He changes the lineup. Whoever hits in front of him
will get better pitches, and that will continue on down the line."</TE>
<TE>   The Mets acknowledge Sheffield could be a big factor in the NL
playoff race.</TE>
<TE>   "I would prefer if [Jordan] had been replaced with somebody other
than Sheffield," General Manager Steve Phillips said. "Sheffield is a
great hitter; he's going to help their team offensively. Certainly,
they have to be the favorites."</TE>

<LD>These people live among you:</LD>
<LD>   C Lopez: "You have nothing but negative things to say about the
Dodgers. When will The Times fire your sorry butt?"</LD>
<LD>   My wife tells me I look good in jeans. Has she been lying to me?</LD>
<TE>   Dodger Fan: "Nice article about the Dodgers--I go to bed every
night thanking God I am not you."</TE>
<TE>   If you had any pull with God, Tom Goodwin would get on base more.</TE>
<TE>   Jack S: "Please resign your position asap. You are totally unaware
how stupid you come off to anyone who has an IQ bigger than that of a
second-hand lamp shade."</TE>
<TE>   I hate to sound stupid, but what's the IQ of a second-hand lamp
shade?</TE>
<TE>   Matt Breslow: "I live in New York City and wondered if you could
send me a Lakers' program or something I could put in my apartment to
show everyone how much of a Laker fan I really am?"</TE>
<TE>   No.</TE>
<TE>   Costa Mesa Jim: "I played golf the other day with a guy who said
he works for the USC Athletic Department. He claimed USC has had
funding in place for a new arena for over a year, but it is being
blocked by President Steven Sample. Sample is allegedly unhappy L.A.
has failed to clean up the area around USC despite 50 years of
promises and would like to find a friendly land baron willing to
donate about 500 acres to USC. Could you check this out?"</TE>
<TE>   I'll call Sample.</TE>
<TE>   Ashmope: "I've tutored elementary school kids that write better
than you. And that's no joke. Their are about four I can think of
specifically--all under the age of 12"'</TE>
<TE>   I believe that sentence should read: "There are about ... "</TE>
<TE>   Paul Renteria: "Thanks for the great Lisa Guerrero information.
Way to go on your investigative reporting."</TE>
<TE>   My wife thinks I spend too much time on the Internet doing
investigative reporting-- imagine that.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Cammalleri: "When did you stop liking sports?"</TE>
<TE>   When I started getting e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   Louis Valverde: "I was listening to the Jim Rome show and he was
going over some of the reporters he likes, including 'some on the
L.A. Times, T.J. Simers, Plaschke, though I don't like him as much as
I used to.... ' How do you think Plaschke will feel about this?"</TE>
<TE>   You know how sensitive he is--let's keep that our little secret.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Biel: "I just read some of your articles--you're an idiot. If
you have any guts you will forward this to your editors."</TE>
<TE>   Consider it done--the editors will be thrilled to learn someone
has read some of my articles.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Woodard: "Looking at the Fox Web site and following your
recommendation, I noticed a fantasy button in the proximity to the
picture posted. When I pressed the fantasy button I didn't get what I
expected. Darn."</TE>
<TE>   I was disappointed, too, but I guess it's too early to expect them
to have all the rosters posted yet for fantasy baseball.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Ramseth: "When it comes to the Raiders, you can say what you
want, and you are usually right. But leave Bum Garner alone. He's my
hero."</TE>
<TE>   Martin Weisman: "James Garner is a great actor. You are a
not-so-great sportswriter."</TE>
<TE>   Hey, when they make the movie "The Life and Times and Hairstyles
of Barry LeBrock,"--I'm hoping Bum will play my part.</TE>
<TE>   J. Haynes: "Nobody wants to read about you embarrassing the PGA
Tour players. Let me guess, 30-ish, loafers, divorced and a problem
in relationships with women, am I right?"</TE>
<TE>   Close. Fifty-ish, sneakers, married for 29 years and seeing Salma
Hayek on the side.</TE>
<TE>   James M.: "As a UCLA alum and someone who has watched Steve Lavin
coach, and as a lifelong Dodger fan...."</TE>
<TE>   Please, don't jump.</TE>
<TE>   Glenn Frost: "Where do they dig up guys like you? Tiger takes the
week off and you take that as an opportunity to diss anybody you
like. How would you react to somebody questioning your ability to do
your job?"</TE>
<TE>   You mean like in an e-mail?</TE>
<TE>   Rollin Herold: "Your contempt for USC is bordering on ridiculous.
You are actually cheering for Arizona schools. If you look at the
replays, you'd see that Jason Gardner's pivot foot moved before he
shot it."</TE>
<TE>   It's a good thing, too, because I would think shooting your foot
would really hurt.</TE>
<TE>   John Hegler: "What is the highest level of golf competition you
ever played?"</TE>
<TE>   A $1 Nassau with Dwyre. Automatic press when two down. A word of
caution if you play with Dwyre--don't let him pay by check.</TE>
<TE>   Tim B: "You actually had the gall to lecture Steve Lavin about
play calling. They should double his pay for having to deal with
dummies like you."</TE>
<TE>   What makes Lavin any different from Jim Tracy, Phil Jackson, Pete
Carroll and Henry Bibby--shouldn't they have their pay doubled too?</TE>
<TE>   Richard Young: "You're so in love with Steve Lavin--why don't you
introduce him to your daughter? That way you can get rid of the
grocery store bagger and UCLA can get a good coach."</TE>
<TE>   So that's what it has come to at UCLA--a call for the bagger to
coach the team.</TE>
<TE>   Gregg Donshik: "Please tell me your golf column was meant as one
big joke. If it wasn't, I would vote you the most annoying columnist
ever, the most prejudiced columnist ever, the most ignorant columnist
ever, and most worthless columnist ever."</TE>
<TE>   Can they get all that on my trophy's nameplate?</TE>
<TE>   Joe Manis: "Just as you are not in attendance without Tiger, there
will be henceforth one less person reading your column."</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who uses the word "henceforth" shouldn't be reading my
column.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes from Jerry Anderson:</TE>
<TE>   "I like your column better when it is called 'Newswire.'"</TE>
<TE>   Enjoy it for the next four days--I'm going golfing.</TE>

<HD>Keppel Has No Answer for Ventura's Duo</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martin Henderson, Dave Desmond and Tim Dermody</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The plan seemed simple enough.</LD>
<LD>   Shadow Jenni Dooley and Katy O'Brien, and step out of the shadows
in the Southern Section Division II-AA girls' basketball playoffs and
into the spotlight.</LD>
<LD>   But Ventura's Dooley and O'Brien did what they have done all
season long, and on Wednesday they added Alhambra Keppel to their
list of frustrated opponents.</LD>
<TE>   Dooley had six three-point baskets and scored 31 points, and
O'Brien scored 19 as the second-seeded Cougars defeated Keppel,
66-57, in front of a capacity home crowd to advance to the semifinals
for the first time since the 1990-91 season.</TE>
<TE>   Dooley and O'Brien were almost always the players who turned back
Keppel. Trailing, 23-7, in the first quarter, Keppel got over its
big-game jitters and rallied to within 28-27 in the final minute of
the first half, but Dooley scored on a putback of one of her three
rebounds, and then O'Brien added another on one of her 10 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "They're very smart players, and they run everything around them,"
Keppel Coach Richard Marquis said. "If it wasn't Dooley, it was
O'Brien."</TE>
<TE>   During one stretch, they scored 31 of 33 points for Ventura.
Dooley had a run in which she scored 14 of 18 points, and the third
of her four steals led to an O'Brien basket for a 57-46 lead with 4
minutes 31 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   But Kaitlyn O'Neill also had a moment reserved for Keppel
heartache. After Keppel (24-3) got within 59-52 with 2:14 to go,
Dooley took a charging foul, then O'Neill scored from 24 feet as the
shot clock expired to push the lead back to 10.</TE>
<TE>   Despite 21 points from Monique Diaz, Keppel had no more rallies
left, and Ventura (26-2) won the right to play third-seeded
Woodbridge, a 58-31 winner over Santa Fe, in the semifinals on
Saturday at a site to be determined.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Henderson</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach Edison 69, Valencia 35--Edison lit it up, making
26 of 48 shots (54.2%) and running away with a Southern Section
Division I-A second-round game at Valencia.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers (19-8) will meet Simi Valley Royal, which upset No.
4-seeded San Bernardino, 61-55 in overtime, in a quarterfinal on
Saturday at a site to be determined by coin flip.</TE>
<TE>   Rachael Ziemann scored 25 points and her sister Bianca added 10.
The Loyola Marymount-bound senior guards combined for 24 points in
the first half, when Edison claimed a 43-16 lead. Sophomore Valerie
Katayama came off the bench to score 17 and Rebecca Kepilino had nine
points and 12 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Valencia (15-14), with three freshman starters, were hot and cold
throughout a season in which they defeated La Puente Bishop Amat and
almost upset Long Beach Poly before finishing a disappointing fourth
in the Foothill League. Against Edison, the Vikings made 13 of 52
shots (25%) and committed 14 turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   Kelley Tarver and Holly Feneht each had nine points and Kim Hardy
added eight for Valencia.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Desmond</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton Troy 62, Saugus 31--The Warriors shook off a sluggish
start and went on to defeat Saugus in a Division II-AA quarterfinals
at Troy.</TE>
<TE>   The Warriors, the defending Division I-A champions, trailed by one
point late in the first quarter before unleashing a barrage of
three-pointers to take a 29-15 halftime lead. Alicia Komaki hit four
three-pointers during that stretch, igniting a 28-6 run that provided
her team a comfortable cushion.</TE>
<TE>   Komaki finished with a game-high 25 points and six assists for
Troy (26-2), which will face the winner of the Norco in a semifinal
Saturday. Sophomore Amanda Livingston finished with 14 points and six
rebounds, and freshman Meghan McGuire had with seven points and eight
rebounds for the Warriors.</TE>
<TE>   Saugus (24-5) managed just six points in the second quarter and
four points in the third as Troy increased it lead to 30 points.</TE>
<TE>   Reserve Lisa Sonnenblick scored a team-high nine points for
Saugus.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Dermody</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pomona Diamond Ranch 53, La Puente Bishop Amat 51--Alysha White
took a half-court pass from Alexis Pope and hit a game-winning,
40-foot shot at the buzzer to lift the Brahmas (21-7) to the victory
over Bishop Amat (21-8) in a Division III-AA quarterfinal game.</TE>
<TE>   Pope finished with 17 points.</TE>
<TE>   Redondo Union 54, Santa Ana Mater Dei 51--Ofa Tulikihihifo had 17
points to lead the Seahawks (21-6) to the Division II-A quarterfinal
victory at Redondo.</TE>
<TE>   Mater Dei (22-7) got 13 points from Amy Sanders and 12 points from
Jessica Williams.</TE>

<HD>Talent Pool Gets Deeper</HD>
<DH>Track and field: L.A. Invitational's resurgence continues,
attracting top athletes for Saturday's meet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN ORTEGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It would be an overstatement to call the open portion of the L.A.
Invitational indoor track and field meet at the Sports Arena on
Saturday a star-studded affair.</LD>
<LD>   But the 42nd edition of the meet will have more world- and
national-class athletes entrants than it has had since Sunkist
dropped its sponsorship in 1995.</LD>
<LD>   "We've got some depth in certain events this year," said Don
Franken, co-promoter of the meet with his father, Al. "That's
something we haven't had in recent years."</LD>
<TE>   The meet, which wasn't held in 1997 because of a lack of corporate
sponsorship, appeared to be in serious jeopardy in  October when the
Amateur Athletic Foundation decided to discontinue its $20,000
sponsorship of the high school portion of the meet.</TE>
<TE>   But several new sponsors have come on board since and coaches of
several high-profile clubs such as Irvine-based HIS have entered
athletes in the meet for "reasonable" appearance fees, according to
Don Franken.</TE>
<TE>   None of the new sponsors is  putting up the kind of cash Sunkist
did,  but the Frankens have had a bit more money to work with this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Because the national indoor championships are being held at the
Armory Track  and Field Center  in New York City on March  1-2,  many
athletes are looking to get in one more competition before then.</TE>
<TE>   Bernard Lagat of Kenya, the second-fastest 1,500-meter runner in
history, is favored to win his fourth consecutive title in the men's
mile.</TE>
<TE>   But the men's high jump, the men's and women's pole vault and the
men's 50 could be the most talent-laden events.</TE>
<TE>   The men's high jump will include Charles Austin, Nathan Leeper,
Shane Lavy and James Nieto.</TE>
<TE>   Austin won the 1996 Olympic title and holds the U.S. record of 7
feet 101/2 inches.</TE>
<TE>   Leeper was ranked first in the U.S. and 10th in the world last
year and has a best of 7-81/2.</TE>
<TE>   Lavy has an indoor best of 7-71/4 and Nieto has cleared 7-61/2.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence Johnson, the silver medalist in the men's pole vault in
the 2000 Olympic Games, heads the list of entrants in that event.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson won the world indoor title last year and is the U.S.
indoor record-holder at 19-61/2. He'll be challenged by  defending
champion Ross Buller, who has a best of 19-3/4, and Jim Davis, who
has cleared 19-1/4.</TE>
<TE>   The women's pole vault won't have as much depth as the men's
event, but it will include 15-footers Mel Mueller and Mary Sauer.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller became the sixth woman to break the 15-foot barrier last
year when she vaulted 15-11/2 and Sauer equaled that height  Saturday
in an indoor meet at Northern Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   The men's 50 will include Jon Drummond, Christopher Williams of
Jamaica and Mickey Grimes.</TE>
<TE>   Drummond was slowed by injuries last year but has a best of 9.92
in the 100.</TE>
<TE>   Williams was the silver medalist in the 200 in the world
championships in Edmonton, Canada, last August and Grimes was a
member of the U.S. team that won the 400 relay in that meet.</TE>

<KH>UCLA REPORT</KH>
<HD>A Trip Into Zany Zone</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UCLA is off to Northern California, land of creative thinkers, zany
individualists and wacky student sections. Home-court advantage is
rarely this much fun.</LD>
<LD>   As for visitors, putting the ball through the basket is difficult
enough without the distractions of odd-ball bands and crazed students
using unrivaled props to apply the needle.</LD>
<LD>   Bruin junior Jason Kapono knows. Two years ago at Stanford,
students wore headbands--Kapono's signature style point--that read
"dork."</LD>
<TE>   Bruin Coach Steve Lavin knows too. UCLA made this trip last year
shortly after Athletic Director Pete Dalis openly courted Rick
Pitino, and students at Cal and Stanford had a field day, wearing
Pitino masks and holding up signs reading, "I got next."</TE>
<TE>   Lavin finds it all hilarious.</TE>
<TE>   "The students at both Cal and Stanford use their ingenuity to come
up with creative ways to make warm-ups entertaining and to have fun
during the game," he said. "Cal has an old-school gymnasium feel,
even though they remodeled it and made it bigger."</TE>
<TE>   When senior Billy Knight recalls wild nights at Cal, he isn't
laughing. The host Bears smothered the Bruins, 92-63, last season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's even worse than Oregon; the fans are louder and there are
more people," he said. "The band marches around the court, I remember
that vividly. They yell at you. You try to ignore it, but after a
while you can't."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Cal Coach Ben Braun loves Haas Pavilion, where his team
is 15-1 this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Haas is a great place, a great college atmosphere," he said.
"We've had a lot of tradition there. We've doubled our capacity
[since renovating the arena] and been pretty close to sellouts every
night."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Is the answer to finding that elusive consistency simply playing
hard all the time?</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins believe so.</TE>
<TE>   "When we lose, I think it's just a lack of effort, we just don't
play hard," Knight said. "It's all in our head, we just have to want
it more. Seems we are satisfied with our record. We usually have one
or two guys play hard and nobody else.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes I don't realize I'm not going as hard as I can until I
watch [game film]. Then I see things I could have done if I showed
more energy."</TE>
<TE>   It is difficult to fathom a team with so many experienced players
struggling with motivation this late in the season.</TE>
<TE>   "As a coach, you can only break so many chalkboards," Lavin said.
"It gets old. At some point it has to be something that is there,
inside."</TE>
<TE>   The coach understands he is accountable for his players'
motivational ebb and flow.</TE>
<TE>   "I always feel responsible, period," he said. "When our team fails
to reach its potential, that falls on my shoulders."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to a change of heart by Fox, tonight's game at Cal will be
televised. The Pacific 10 Conference game on Fox Sports Net is USC at
Stanford, and for the first time this season Fox had said it would
not grant UCLA a waiver to show the game on another channel.</TE>
<TE>   However, Fox relented Wednesday, and the game will be on Fox
Sports Net 2.</TE>
<TE>   As of now, UCLA's home game against Oregon State on Feb. 28 will
not be televised because USC's home game against Oregon is the Pac-10
game and Fox does not want to split the market.</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   at California, 7</TE>
<TE>   Fox Sports Net 2</TE>
<TE>   Site--Haas Pavilion, Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KXTA (1150, 850).</TE>
<TE>   Records--No. 25 UCLA 17-8, 9-5; Cal 18-6, 9-5.</TE>
<TE>   Update--The loser of this game between teams tied for fifth in the
Pacific 10 Conference has no chance to win the regular-season title.
The winner holds slim hopes. UCLA beat Cal, 64-57, a month ago behind
a leak-proof zone defense that forced the Bears to launch 25
three-point shots. They made five. Keeping the ball from 6-foot-11
post players Solomon Hughes and Jamal Sampson again will be key. Bear
6-10 freshman forward Amit Tamir, who scored 39 points in an upset of
Oregon, was held scoreless by the Bruins.</TE>

<DH>His Season Spinning Out of Control,  Trojans' Bluthenthal
Took New  Mental Approach That Paid Off</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PALO ALTO</DL>
<LD>As David Bluthenthal goes, so goes USC.</LD>
<LD>   As recently as two weeks ago, the small forward's senior season
was  maddeningly frustrating and careening out of control while USC
dropped two consecutive games for the first time this season.</LD>
<LD>   Now, the streaky Bluthenthal is the reigning Pacific 10 Conference
player of the week after knocking down a career-best seven
three-point shots and scoring a career-high 31 points against Arizona
to complete a sweep of the conference's desert schools.</LD>
<TE>   The 20th-ranked Trojans (18-6 overall, 10-4 in the Pac-10) will
need another big game from Bluthenthal tonight at No. 10 Stanford
(17-6, 10-4) in a game between two of the three teams tied for first
place. Especially with starting center Kostas Charissis out with a
broken bone in his left ankle and 7-foot Stanford center Curtis
Borchardt ready to play after missing the Trojans' 90-82 win last
month because of a hip pointer.</TE>
<TE>   USC's fortunes have risen and fallen with Bluthenthal this season.
In USC's 10 conference wins, Bluthenthal has averaged 15 points and
eight rebounds while shooting 51% from the field. In their four
Pac-10 losses, his scoring average dipped to 8.5 points on 33%
shooting while his rebounding went up to 8.5 a game.</TE>
<TE>   In losses to Arizona, Oregon and UCLA, Bluthenthal averaged 4.7
points on 21% shooting and 10 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "If the kid is in the right frame of mind, he can dominate," USC
Coach Henry Bibby said of Bluthenthal, who averaged 26 points and 9.5
rebounds while shooting 61.3% from the field, 58.8% from beyond the
three-point arc, against Arizona State and Arizona. "But there's no
player in the Pac-10 that's dominating every night like he was last
week."</TE>
<TE>   Bluthenthal admitted that the game was no longer fun for him, that
he had been worrying too much about his future and impressing NBA
scouts.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I know how to get in the right frame of mind--to just have
fun with it. It's kind of like the chicken-and-the-egg thing. It
starts with having more fun and then playing well."</TE>
<TE>   He's also increased his daily shot total to nearly 750 jump shots,
give or take a hundred. And his 49.2% success rate from beyond the
three-point arc in conference play is leading the Pac-10.</TE>
<TE>   In trying to get Bluthenthal to break out of his slump, Bibby
suggested he get it going in games by being active down low and
getting what he terms "easy baskets," tip-ins, put-backs and layups
before attempting jump shots.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never doubted him," said Bibby, who acknowledged that he
encountered a similarly rough stretch as a junior at UCLA. "I never
told him one time to not shoot the basketball. I know what he's going
through and Coach [John] Wooden never told me not to shoot the
basketball. And that's something that I learned from Coach Wooden is
that you've got to play, play through that."</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans will have to play without their starting center, while
the Cardinal regains the services of its big man.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, Charissis only averages 2.3 points and 10.4 minutes, but
at 6 feet 11 and 250 pounds, the junior was also a big and
experienced body that had five fouls to give against Borchardt, who
leads the league in rebounding (11.6) and blocked shots (2.92) in
conference games.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, USC will use two freshmen, 6-11 Rory O'Neil and 6-8 Nick
Curtis.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neil likely will come off the bench, as he did against Stanford
at the Sports Arena when he had a career-high 14 points and two
blocks in 24 minutes before fouling out. Curtis, meanwhile, started
three of USC's first five games but is averaging three minutes and
one point in eight Pac-10 games.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never been concerned about size," Bibby said. "I'm more
concerned about quickness. That's what my game plan is, trying to
out-quick people to the basketball."</TE>
<TE>   It worked last time, with USC utilizing a full-court press to get
16 steals and force 27 Stanford turnovers. And with the lumbering
Borchardt in the lineup, doesn't that make the Cardinal more
susceptible to the press?</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe," Bibby said with a grin. "Sometimes positives can be
negatives."</TE>
<TE>   And negatives can be positives. Just ask Bluthenthal.</TE>

<LD>Four children died of asphyxia and two siblings were critically
injured after their father, apparently despondent over marital
troubles, allegedly lighted a charcoal grill early Wednesday in the
living room of the family's Pico Rivera home, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA Medical Center officials said they are pessimistic about the
chances of one of the children surviving.</LD>
<LD>   Adair Garcia, 30, and Adriana Ibeth Arreola, the children's
mother, had been having marital problems, authorities said, declining
to elaborate on what may have triggered the incident.</LD>
<TE>   Adair Garcia was taken to Presbyterian Intercommunity Hospital in
Whittier, where he is in the critical care chamber, said Dr. Nadeem
Chishti. Most likely, he will be transported to a county jail after
being released. A sheriff's deputy is outside his hospital room door.</TE>
<TE>   "We are investigating this as a homicide," said Lt. Don Bear of
the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's homicide bureau. "Logic
tells us that [the father] is the only person who would have set the
charcoal on fire."</TE>
<TE>   The children's maternal grandmother found the bodies early
Wednesday morning when she arrived to care for them, Bear said. She
ran to the home of a neighbor, who called 911.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters went to the home in the 9600 block of Washington
Boulevard at 6:30 a.m. to find Brenda Garcia, 10; Jonathan Garcia, 6;
and Anthony Garcia, 2, dead in their pajamas in their bedroom, said
Scott Carrier, a spokesman for the county coroner's office. Cecilia
Garcia, 4, died after being transported to Presbyterian hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Emergency crews found the two-bedroom house filled with carbon
monoxide and the barbecue grill, still smoldering, in the living
room, said Edward Osorio, an inspector with the county Fire
Department.</TE>
<TE>   He said 25 parts per million of carbon monoxide is considered
unsafe, and firefighters' early tests at the house showed 214 parts
per million. "With all that carbon monoxide, and nowhere to go,
basically you have a gas chamber," Osorio said.</TE>
<TE>   Bear said investigators did not believe the barbecue was being
used for heat. Sometime after the bodies were found, the children's
mother arrived at the house. Jennifer Moran, 32, a neighbor, said
that when deputies refused to let Arreola into the house, she became
belligerent and told deputies her husband was responsible. "Let me
see my ... kids ... I know he did it ....They are just babies. They
are are just babies," Moran described Arreola as telling deputies.</TE>
<TE>   The children's mother was so distraught that she was unable to
give investigators her consent to search the home, and detectives
obtained a search warrant, said Deputy Rick Varela.</TE>
<TE>   She is not considered a suspect in the case, said Deputy David
Cervantes, a Sheriff's Department spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   At Presbyterian, Adair Garcia was placed in a hyperbaric chamber,
where the carbon monoxide poison was flushed out with pure oxygen,
said Chishti.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said it was not clear whether the fathewr--a
splicing technician for SBC Pacific Bell's Rosemead office--had
intended to kill himself.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors Say Garcias Are a 'Loving' Family</TE>
<TE>   Bear said that the Garcias had been having marital discord in the
last week and that Arreola was not living at the house. Neighbors
said the family appeared to be close-knit, and many described the
couple and their children as loving.</TE>
<TE>   "She had six kids and I had six kids, so we'd talk about how tough
that was," said neighbor Martha Serrato. "They looked like a loving
family. I never thought anything was wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Mauries, a fifth-grader who La Merced Intermediate School
in Montebello with Brenda Garcia, described the girl as a loyal
friend.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter what, whenever you needed help, she was always with
you," Jennifer said.</TE>
<TE>   In front of the campus Wednesday, children gathered and someone
wrote: "It's so sad," next to a sad face, and added, "in memory of
Brenda."</TE>
<TE>   Fernando Loya, the next-door neighbor who called authorities, said
of the tragedy: "It was surprising to us." He said the Garcias "kept
to themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said that Arreola was a homemaker and that her husband's
work truck was often in the driveway.</TE>
<TE>   The family could be seen going on bike rides in the neighborhood
and on trails along a nearby river.</TE>
<TE>   Irma Azueto, one of the neighbors, recalled the family having a
backyard barbecue about every other week. She did not think much of
it when she smelled the odors of a lighted grill Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   The Garcias' frontyard was also frequently the scene of yard
sales.</TE>
<TE>   More than 100 people attended a makeshift vigil in front of the
Garcia home about 7:30 p.m. Wednesday. Some held candles as others
placed flowers at the door. Some wept as others knelt and prayed.
Many of them hugged one another. A cardboard sign placed at the scene
read: "In loving memory of the Garcia family."</TE>
<TE>   Former Co-Workers Recall a Devoted Dad</TE>
<TE>   Two SBC Pacific Bell employees said they recall when Garcia and
Arreola worked together a few years ago at the company. He was a
technician; she was a customer service representative. "They went to
work together, took lunch together, took breaks together and went
home together," said a female colleague.</TE>
<TE>   "He is an all-American dad. He worked hard for his kids," another
co-worker said. Garcia was decribed as a man who carried his
children's photos around with him.</TE>
<TE>   "They had a Suburban. They used to joke they'd have kids until it
was full," the co-worker said.</TE>
<TE>   Young classmates of the children attended the vigil.</TE>
<TE>   One of the children, Shuichi Matsumoto, 11, asked, "Who's still
alive? ... Is Jonathan alive?"</TE>
<TE>   Shuichi discovered that Brenda, a close friend from grade school,
had died when counselors talked to students after cello practice.</TE>
<TE>   "They told me Brenda had died, but I didn't want to believe it,"
he said. He said Brenda played the violin and dressed like the
television character "Dark Angel" last Halloween. She would give him
a bologna and cheese sandwich when he forgot to ask his mother for
lunch money, Shuichi said.</TE>
<TE>   The boy tried to console his 9-year-old brother, Shataro, who
sobbed at the vigil. "Don't cry, don't cry," Shuichi told his younger
brother, holding his head.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Acevedo, 11, said, "I would give up half of my life to see
Brenda alive."</TE>

<HD>As Casualties Mount, Sharon Is Under Fire on Home Front</HD>
<DH>Israel: Premier is assailed by left and right amid violence that is
pushing nation to 'boiling point.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Prime Minister Ariel Sharon started the week by reassuring Israelis
reeling from a string of bloody attacks that they had nothing to fear.
"Israel," the hawkish former general told his Cabinet, "has never lost a
war and will win this war as well."</LD>
<LD>   But between Sunday, when Sharon made that observation, and Wednesday,
10 more Israelis were killed and the prime minister was under attack from
across the political spectrum.</LD>
<LD>   On the right, members of Sharon's Likud Party pronounced his year-old
government a dismal failure. They urged him to launch a war to destroy
the Palestinian Authority and oust its president, Yasser Arafat, from the
West Bank. On the left, growing numbers of Israelis called on the prime
minister to dismantle at least some Jewish settlements and unilaterally
withdraw from large parts of the West Bank and all of the Gaza Strip
immediately.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, Sharon vowed to leave his strategy unchanged. The army, he
decided early this week, will "continue to exact the maximum price from
the terrorists and those who give them shelter" but stop short of
toppling the Palestinian Authority outright.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, the army launched wide-scale air, sea and ground raids in
the West Bank and Gaza after Palestinian militants shot dead six Israeli
soldiers at a roadblock outside the West Bank city of Ramallah. The
reprisals claimed the lives of 15 Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli security officials warned that worse was to come.</TE>
<TE>   But for a growing number of Israelis exhausted by the months of
fighting and demoralized by the seemingly endless supply of Palestinian
suicide attackers, retaliation is increasingly unsatisfactory.</TE>
<TE>   "We can now openly say that we are losing the present round that began
in September 2000," Amnon Dankner, editor of the daily newspaper Maariv,
wrote in a front-page editorial Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Lying on the side of the road we have traveled this year, rusting
like junked cars, are not only Sharon's promises for peace and security,
but even statements that were very acceptable until a short while ago,"
Dankner wrote. The public no longer believes government promises that
Arafat's rule is about to collapse or that the Palestinians "are on the
verge of giving up," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "How many blows of the type we have taken during this last week will
we be able to continue to take before the public rises up and the morale
of the army reaches a dangerous low?" Dankner asked.</TE>
<TE>   Hatzofe, the newspaper of the religious right, that once lionized
Sharon, suggested Wednesday that the prime minister has failed to declare
war on the Palestinians because he is still traumatized by his role in
Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon.</TE>
<TE>   As defense minister, Sharon was the architect of a war that brought
Israeli tanks into Beirut. He was forced to resign after a
government-appointed commission held him indirectly responsible for the
massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees in Beirut camps by Israel's
Lebanese Christian allies.</TE>
<TE>   "It is inconceivable that Israel should pay this price of blood
without a fitting, very painful response, just because the prime minister
emerged wounded from . . . the Lebanon war," the newspaper wrote in an
unsigned editorial. "It seems likely that the good of the country demands
that he give up his post because he is psychologically limited and unable
to do what needs to be done."</TE>
<TE>   In the eye of the growing political storm over the government's
strategy, Sharon huddled again Wednesday with his security chiefs, then
with his security Cabinet.</TE>
<TE>   A meeting originally planned as a strategic discussion of how best to
approach the conflict with the Palestinians became an operational debate
about how best to hit back. In the end, Sharon decided again to broaden
and deepen retaliatory attacks without changing strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Born into the Arab-Jewish conflict more than 70 years ago, Sharon--as
a general and, later, as a leader of the right-wing Likud in
opposition--often boasted to Labor Party prime ministers that he would
know how to snuff out Palestinian terrorism if given the chance.</TE>
<TE>   Now he counsels Israelis to be patient as they cope with a national
life dominated by the macabre parade of seemingly endless attacks,
counterattacks and funerals.</TE>
<TE>   What do you tell Israelis who are too scared to drive from their homes
to their offices for fear that they will encounter a suicide bomber en
route, a reporter asked Sharon on Monday. "The citizens have greater
endurance than those who write about them," was his terse reply.</TE>
<TE>   But experts here disagree with the prime minister. Israelis, they say,
are longing for a clear-cut solution to the conflict and sickened by the
carnage that has claimed the lives of more than 1,000 Palestinians and
Israelis in the last 17 months.</TE>
<TE>   "We are getting very, very close to the boiling point," said Shlomo
Gazit, a retired general and former director of military intelligence.
Sharon, he said in an interview hours before the six Israeli soldiers
were gunned down at the West Bank roadblock, "has been lucky," because
none of the recent attacks produced large numbers of casualties.</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting a widely held belief here that Sharon hasn't opted to
reoccupy the West Bank and Gaza Strip for fear of rupturing relations
with the United States, Gazit said the prime minister may have no choice.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Sharon will have to say to the Americans: 'I'm sorry, I can't go
on like this,' " Gazit said. "The people won't let him go on like this.
No people in the world can accept such a rate of terrorist attacks
without doing something about it, and what we are doing about it--blowing
up empty offices and houses--is ridiculous."</TE>

<HD>Survivors Recall Rail Inferno in Egypt</HD>
<DH>Disaster: About 400 people die in fire aboard speeding train. Some
jumped from windows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>REQA AL GHARBIYA, Egypt
</DL>
<LD>Ali Thabet climbed out the window of a speeding train and held on
for his life Wednesday as flames rushed through his carriage, leaped into
the next carriage, and the next and the next and the next, leaving
hundreds of passengers charred beyond recognition in a horrific railway
disaster.</LD>
<LD>   Thabet jumped and survived. His father, Ali Moustafa, did too.</LD>
<LD>   "I just tried to save my life," Thabet, 20, said as he sat at his
father's hospital bed while rescue workers pulled bodies from the
wreckage. "I held on until the fire made my feet and legs burn, then I
let go."</LD>
<TE>   The third-class passenger train had been packed with men, women and
children crammed into every conceivable space. Tickets were less than a
dollar for the 300-mile journey from Cairo to the southern city of Luxor
on the state-owned train. Most of the passengers were headed home to
celebrate the Islamic feast of Eid al-Adha, which marks the end of the
hajj pilgrimage and Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son.</TE>
<TE>   About 400 people never made it.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the fire started about 12:30 a.m., an hour after the
train pulled out of the capital. It apparently began in the cafe car, at
one end of the train, when a gas canister used for cooking exploded.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said that for some reason, the train traveled for about four
miles after the fire broke out, the air rushing through missing or broken
windows, fueling the flames as they consumed one carriage after another.
When the train finally stopped, it took several hours to put out the
blaze.</TE>
<TE>   The circumstances were still under investigation. What was clear,
however--to the witnesses who saw passengers hurling themselves from
windows, to the rescue workers who struggled to pull apart fused bodies
and to the passengers who survived--was that the train was so
overcrowded, almost no one could get to the exits.</TE>
<TE>   Each carriage was meant to hold about 150 passengers, but some at the
scene said it seemed as if twice as many were packed in.</TE>
<TE>   "The fire started to get really close," said Yassir Fouad Mohammad,
28, who also jumped from a window. "But there was no place for us to get
out. We couldn't get through to the doors because of the crowds."</TE>
<TE>   Grilles on some of the windows also hampered escapes.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses described panicked women, their dresses on fire, rushing
forward and slamming into a wall of passengers. They surged forward
together and died together, one on top of the other. The official death
toll was about 370, but authorities said it could go higher.</TE>
<TE>   "The dead people were all piled up in one place in each car, like they
were trying to escape," said Mamdouh Salem, one of the first ambulance
attendants on the scene.</TE>
<TE>   By midday, seven carriages sat atop a low ridge overlooking fields
where farmers work the land the way their ancestors did centuries ago,
with bare hands, bare feet and beasts of burden. Helmeted riot police
blocked them from getting near what was left of the train.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, the cars were seared of their paint. Inside, workers
struggled to pull out the remains. The heat had been so intense that
everything--luggage, seats and people--had melded. A railroad crossing
alarm clanged nonstop as they worked.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve miles up the road, at the hospital in the village of Ayyat, the
morgue was filled beyond capacity and 36 survivors were being treated,
mostly for burns and trauma caused by jumping from the train. The
hospital manager said 19 passengers with serious burns had been moved to
Cairo for treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "I am looking for my brother," Hisham Mohammad said as he sat outside
the hospital, tears running down his face, knowing in his heart that if
his brother Sadek wasn't in the hospital, he was in the morgue, or still
in the train.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of personal tragedies like Mohammad's were quickly becoming a
very public emergency for the government.</TE>
<TE>   Egyptian authorities have been in crisis mode for months, facing a
serious economic problem that was exacerbated when tourism plunged after
the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States. The authorities' approach to
the fiscal woes has been to insist that nothing was seriously wrong. That
was the same approach they took with the train fire.</TE>
<TE>   "All trains are in good shape and at the highest degree of efficiency,
and they are reviewed completely," said Prime Minister Atef Abeid, who
traveled to the fire scene and then to the village hospital and ordered a
full investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The prime minister had joined other government leaders who parked
their fleets of Mercedes-Benzes across from the recovery operation. Top
officials, including Mahmoud abu Leia, governor of neighboring Giza
province, pulled out folding chairs and sat in the shade.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, he wanted an investigation, Abu Leia said, but he too explained
the tragedy as an accident, an aberration, something that could happen
anywhere. He also emphasized that Egyptians alone had died--as opposed to
tourists, whose dollars officials are desperate to lure back to the
nation.</TE>
<TE>   "Upper Egypt has dozens of trains that pass through it every day," Abu
Leia said as he sipped a diet soda. "It is totally safe. But
unfortunately this accident happened in one of the local trains that
carry only Egyptians, which is different from the trains that carry
tourists."</TE>
<TE>   He said that when the conductor realized that the train was on fire,
he managed to have the burning cars separated from three cars in the
front that were still safe. While the speeding inferno coasted to a stop,
he continued on to Luxor, Abu Leia said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether he was upset at the lack of fire exits, or the
overcrowding, or the decision of the engineer to keep going, he dismissed
such concerns, although he said the officials obviously cared because
they had come to the scene.</TE>
<TE>   "Such accidents happen everywhere, in Europe, in India," he said.
"Each car has more than one door that passengers can use to get in and
out."</TE>
<TE>   When Abu Leia finished speaking, an overcrowded third-class train
passed by on the southbound tracks. People were standing in the aisles
and sitting in the doorways.</TE>
<TE>   Egyptians are accustomed to such government responses. Occasionally
they rise in a spasm of anger, as in 1977, when the price of bread was
raised. Score of people died when riots ensued.</TE>
<TE>   There was some frustration with the government's defensive posture
over the train system.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never seen such a shameless prime minister," said Hisham
Kassem, an Egyptian human rights activists and publisher of the
English-language Cairo Times. "When did he have the time to check on the
condition of the railway station to say that they are safe? If this
government can find a scapegoat, it will."</TE>
<TE>   By late Wednesday, Egypt's state-owned news channels hadn't broadcast
any details of the tragedy except to say that there had been a fire on a
Luxor-bound train.</TE>
<TE>   "It is an accident. It happens," Mahmoud abu Yousef, 52, said as he
bought oranges in the nearby village of Abu Radwan al Kibli. "We are
faithful [religious] people. No one came and killed them."</TE>
<TE>   A crowd surged forward to hear a discussion of the disaster. Most
expressed a bit of fatalism, saying that when one's time comes, nothing
can be done. But Mahmoud Mohammad, 27, wasn't as willing to let the
authorities off the hook.</TE>
<TE>   "The government should have better safety measures on trains," he
said, elbowing his way to the front of the crowd. "They take better care
of tourists. We want them to take care of us too."</TE>

<LD>Speculation ricocheted across Wall Street on Wednesday about a new
round of media mergers, sending broadcast stocks soaring but leaving
consumer advocates angry about the possibility of greater corporate
concentration of information.</LD>
<LD>   The widely conflicting emotions were triggered by a federal court
ruling that has opened the door for entertainment conglomerates to
capture larger chunks of the national TV audience.</LD>
<LD>   In its ruling Tuesday, the court ordered the Federal Communications
Commission to reconsider its rule preventing broadcast corporations from
reaching more than 35% of households with televisions. The court also set
aside a rule that prevented companies from owning a cable system and a TV
station in the same market.</LD>
<TE>   Investors, knowing that FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell is a fan of
deregulation, saw the court order as practically an invitation for major
broadcasters to swallow smaller ones. Giant cable operators such as AOL
Time Warner Inc. could create an even broader empire by buying companies
that own TV stations.</TE>
<TE>   The largest deals, however, might not materialize for some time
because the strongest buyers are suffering from operating troubles, the
recession and retrenchments of their own.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner, for instance, has seen its stock sink this year as
growth projections promised from its year-old marriage of new and old
media failed to materialize. Walt Disney Co. shares are in a trench
because of a travel slowdown that has hurt its theme parks. And Viacom
Inc. has struggled because its major holdings in television are dependent
on advertising.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too premature to predict whether this is terrible or good, or
just how things will play out," said Blair Levin, an analyst at brokerage
firm Legg Mason. "This is like a chessboard with 64 potential spaces to
move and everybody's moves have ripple effects."</TE>
<TE>   Judging from the stock actions Wednesday, the market anticipates
several potential takeover targets among TV station owners. Tribune Co.,
owner of the Los Angeles Times, saw its stock rise $2.34 to $43.52.
Analysts see Tribune as a possible fit with AOL Time Warner because it
has a 25% interest in the entertainment giant's WB network and many of
the affiliated television stations.</TE>
<TE>Disney Viewed as Possible Target</TE>
<TE>   AOL also has been mentioned as a potential buyer of NBC, which would
give the company a major broadcast network.</TE>
<TE>   Disney's stock, meanwhile, shot up $1.47 to a close of $24.33. This
would suggest that Wall Street sees Disney as a seller, not a buyer. A
prolonged slump has made the company a target of takeover speculation in
recent months, and the new court ruling immediately sparked predictions
of an acquisition by a cable operator such as Comcast Corp.</TE>
<TE>   But some analysts said that it is the small and mid-size broadcasters
that are most vulnerable. Not only are many struggling to survive, but
they wouldn't break a buyer's bank.</TE>
<TE>   Such companies as Granite Broadcasting Corp. and Young Broadcasting
Inc. have been selling off stations to stay afloat.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Young Broadcasting recently agreed to sell its Los Angeles
station, KCAL-TV Channel 9, to Viacom, which owns CBS. Others, such as
Paxson Communications Corp., have been praying for a further easing of
ownership limits to lift the value of their stations so they can sell at
higher prices.</TE>
<TE>   Potential network buyers--such as NBC, CBS, ABC and Fox--insist that
further consolidation would only strengthen the broadcast industry.</TE>
<TE>   Fox, for example, says the company has been able to bolster news
operations and entertainment choices at the stations it has purchased.</TE>
<TE>   That's why network executives say a relaxation--if not elimination--of
FCC rules is in the public interest.</TE>
<TE>Media Diversity at Heart of Debate</TE>
<TE>   FCC's Powell agrees and sees another reason for softening the rules.
He has called the media "more diverse in 2001 than at any time in their
history" because of the Internet and the proliferation of cable channels.</TE>
<TE>   But critics have a different view.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if you live in a 500-channel universe, what you get from your
[cable or satellite] box is delivered to you by four companies," said
Marty Kaplan, associate dean of the USC Annenberg School for
Communication and director of the Norman Lear Center. He called industry
consolidation "a real threat to diversity."</TE>
<TE>   Groups entrenched in the entertainment industry also have grown uneasy
watching the growth of conglomerates, prompting the Writers Guild of
America recently to call for hearings on the ramifications of media
concentration.</TE>
<TE>   In an FCC filing signed by some of the industry's most influential
writers, the guild maintained that consolidation of television "has
adversely affected the public interest, . . . resulted in the lack of
diversity and has caused creativity to suffer, . . . [depriving] the
American public of access to a great variety of opinions and
sensibilities."</TE>
<TE>   Consumer advocates are most concerned about the ramifications on news
operations, particularly in small cities, where mergers have chipped away
at the number of voices in the market.</TE>
<TE>   Some media critics contend that the diminishing resources spent on
news gathering has left the public uninformed about important world
events, including the international context of last fall's terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Especially after Sept. 11, people recognize the media's role in
shaping the public debate," said Jeff Chester, executive director of the
nonprofit Center for Digital Democracy.</TE>
<TE>   If wholesale TV station sales do take place, what has happened in
radio could provide a template.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel Communications Inc.--owner of nearly 1,200 stations--and
CBS led the merger frenzy within the radio business, with one of the two
companies controlling as much as 40% of the stations in many of the
nation's largest markets.</TE>
<TE>Public Holds Controls Through Ratings</TE>
<TE>   CBS, through its Infinity Broadcasting arm, owns eight stations in the
Los Angeles area, including both AM all-news radio stations, KFWB (980)
and KNX (1070).</TE>
<TE>   Deregulation also has led to layoffs, along with fewer locally
produced programs, including those for children.</TE>
<TE>   Because fortunes in television rise and fall based on ratings, the
public ultimately will have final say. Still, USC's Kaplan sees
unfettered consolidation as making the industry less responsive.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like the phone company was when Lily Tomlin was making fun of
it," he said. " 'We don't care. We're the phone company.' Well, in this
case, 'We're the TV company.' "</TE>

<DH>China's $23-billion plan for 2008 Games is the Olympic gold for
U.S. companies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN IRITANI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To understand why San Diego-based Cubic Transportation Systems has
made China a top priority, take a look at the to-do list for the 2008
Summer Olympics. It includes a $1-billion plan to add at least 60 miles
of track and 60 stations to Beijing's subway system.</LD>
<LD>   For Cubic, which produces high-tech fare-collection systems, that job
alone would be comparable to outfitting the entire Los Angeles subway
system.</LD>
<LD>   As Salt Lake City winds up its Olympic debut, firms such as Cubic are
looking ahead to the grand prize: Beijing 2008. Even in the hyped-up
world bound by the five interlocking rings of the Olympics, China is
big--very, very big. China's $23-billion budget is more than seven times
the size of Salt Lake City's and Sydney's in 2000, more than five times
the projected spending for Athens in 2004 and 32 times what Los Angeles
spent in 1984.</LD>
<TE>   The differences in costs are Olympian because Beijing, unlike the
other cities, has so far to go to provide the basics. To win the coveted
Olympics bid, Chinese officials agreed to spend more than $20 billion
just on infrastructure, building an Olympic village with an 80,000-seat
stadium, tripling the miles of the city's expressways and cleaning up one
of the world's most polluted cities.</TE>
<TE>   To fulfill those lofty ambitions, China has agreed to turn its capital
into a giant construction zone. The $480-million Olympic
village--designed by Baltimore urban design firm RTKL--is one of 37
Olympic venues spread between Beijing and five other cities. China is
spending billions of dollars to divert water from southern China to
parched northern China, relocating thousands of polluting factories from
Beijing to the hinterlands, adding 400 bus lines and investing $3.6
billion in high-tech gadgetry, including a digital network capable of
HDTV transmission for all Olympic venues.</TE>
<TE>   For months, the Beijing Olympic Organizing Committee has been
entertaining a stream of foreign delegations. The best opportunities for
foreign firms appear to be in project management, construction,
transportation and services such as financing, tourism and environmental
technology.</TE>
<TE>   "China is making all the right moves trying to spur international
competition," said Steve Shewmaker, a senior vice president at Cubic.</TE>
<TE>   "The time to start talking with Beijing about the Olympics is now, not
in three or four years," said Patrick Powers, director of China
operations for the U.S.-China Business Council, who met with Beijing
Mayor Liu Qi, also head of the Olympic committee, last fall. "They're
moving forward with their plans the first half of this year, and there is
already significant competition for the committee's attention from major
corporations and governments."</TE>
<TE>   Chinese Olympic officials hope to put out bids for the major venues by
the end of this year, with the goal of completing the major structures by
2007.</TE>
<TE>   Hong Kong attorney Christopher Stephens, whose firm, Coudert Bros.,
was hired to advise the Olympic committee, said the Chinese are under
pressure because of the magnitude of the construction, the tight
timetable and the need to minimize negative effects on residents of
Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time you put up one of these sporting venues, you drop it on a
plot of land, but then you have to surround it with access roads, bring
in electricity, water and sewer, and if you have water runoff, it affects
an enormous area," Stephens said. "This is an enormously complicated
thing just to coordinate internally, and it has far-flung consequences
way beyond the Olympic Games."</TE>
<TE>   The 13.8 million residents of the crowded capital already have gotten
a taste of Olympian headaches. When the Olympics site team visited
Beijing last spring, the local government blocked downtown streets to
guarantee a smooth flow of traffic, closed dirty factories to improve the
air quality and spray-painted the grass along the main thoroughfares
bright green. Though the prospect of having a greener, cleaner and more
efficient city is welcome, locals are bracing for massive traffic delays,
power outages and other inconveniences along the way.</TE>
<TE>Striving to Avoid Controversy</TE>
<TE>   Companies that want to use the Beijing Olympics to garner goodwill or
reach China's fast-growing consumer market should expect to pay dearly
for corporate sponsorships, television broadcasting rights and marketing
and licensing spinoffs. Though the Chinese government is using a lottery
to help defray the multibillion-dollar construction budget, it expects
private firms to pay for 80% of the $1.6-billion organizing budget. That
would be four times as much as the $320 million earned by the 2000 Sydney
Olympics. At best, China expects to extract only a slim profit from the
venture, according to Chinese media reports.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights critics have warned foreign companies that they are
running a risk becoming too closely associated with an authoritarian
government that has used high-profile events as an excuse to crack down
on political dissidents or religious groups such as the Falun Gong.</TE>
<TE>   But these concerns haven't deterred the world's leading companies,
most of which already are heavily invested in China and seeking to
improve their standing in the run-up to the 2008 Olympics. U.S.-based
General Motors Corp. and Xerox Corp., Australia's Telstra and Acer Corp.
of Taiwan were among the firms that helped subsidize Beijing's
$20-million Olympic bid.</TE>
<TE>   Avoiding controversy is important to the International Olympic
Committee and China, both of which are fighting high-profile battles
against corruption. The Olympics are also an important test of China's
commitment to the World Trade Organization, which it joined in December.
As a member of the global trade group, China agreed to lower tariffs and
other trade barriers, improve its judicial system and step up enforcement
of intellectual property laws.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese officials assured the U.S.-China Business Council, a
Washington-based business promotion group, that the process of bidding
for Olympics-related contracts "would be transparent and according to
international standards."</TE>
<TE>   China is likely to give preference to foreign firms that establish
joint ventures and use local products and services, said Geoff Jackson,
regional director for Asia for the U.S. Trade and Development Agency in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "They're definitely going to maximize Chinese content, and why not?
This is an opportunity to show the world China's capability," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Trade and Development Agency provides grants so developing
countries can obtain U.S. technical expertise for building large
infrastructure projects. Jackson said his agency and others, such as the
U.S. departments of Energy and Commerce, are looking for ways to give
U.S. firms an advantage in China.</TE>
<TE>   One possibility would be to help the Chinese acquire U.S. project
management expertise from local governments and firms that have Olympic
experience. The lessons are varied, from Peter Ueberroth's record
$232-million profit in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics to the 1996 bomb
scare in Atlanta to the corruption scandal that nearly sank this year's
Salt Lake City Games.</TE>
<TE>   "The Olympics is a good opportunity for U.S. industry, not only for
suppliers of equipment but in project planning," Jackson said. "The U.S.
has great experience in hosting several Olympics. Not all of the
experiences have been good, but we learn each time we do something."</TE>
<TE>   Financing also is critical. Foreign governments are far more
aggressive in offering low-interest loans or other financial aid to push
their companies to the front of the line, U.S. executives say.</TE>
<TE>   Cubic Transportation Systems, a division of Cubic Corp., won $50
million in contracts to provide ticketing machines for subway lines in
Shanghai and Guangzhou after the U.S. Export-Import Bank agreed to match
the financing being offered by German and French competitors. But in a
separate project in Shanghai, Cubic lost the bid to a Japanese firm,
Nippon Signal Co., which sweetened the pot with an attractive government
loan, said Shewmaker, the Cubic executive.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got a concern that we as an American company are disadvantaged
when that situation arises because of the strict rules and regulations
we've got to follow over there," he said. "If we go in with the U.S.
government providing concessionary financing, it sort of levels the
field."</TE>
<TE>   Though firms such as Cubic and San Francisco-based construction giant
Bechtel Group Inc. have a long history in China, the Olympics are
creating opportunities for small and medium-sized California firms, said
Lon Hatamiya, secretary of the California Technology, Trade and Commerce
Agency. Last fall, his office held a conference in Long Beach to
introduce U.S. environmental technology to China, which has pledged to
spend $7 billion on Olympics-related environmental work, including new
waste disposal facilities and the planting of thousands of acres of urban
forest in and around Beijing.</TE>
<TE>High-Tech Answer to Water Shortage</TE>
<TE>   In addition to beautifying the city, China's reforestation program is
designed to slow the spread of the nearby desert and reduce dust storms.
DriWater Inc., a small firm based in Santa Rosa, Calif., is offering
China an innovative answer to its water shortage. The firm's patented
DriWater product combines water and vegetable gum into a gel-like
substance that is packaged in biodegradable containers. Buried in the
ground, the product provides water for up to three months.</TE>
<TE>   Kent Corley, DriWater's vice president for operations, said his firm
hopes to participate in the greening of Beijing. DriWater sent 200,000
quarts of its product to China last year and set up demonstration
reforestation projects in six provinces in northern China. To lower
costs, the company has established a joint-venture manufacturing facility
outside Beijing that is set to begin production.</TE>
<TE>   "They [the Chinese] know about the technology," Corley said. "They
understand it and they want it. One of the main issues has always been
cost. We just needed the economies of scale."</TE>
<TE>   China's leaders are keen to create a sophisticated athletic showcase
that will bring their country the recognition they feel is long overdue,
said Min Wang, whose San Francisco firm helped the Chinese design their
winning bid.</TE>
<TE>   "The Chinese people have for so many years felt they have been left
behind and not taken seriously," said Wang, the design director for
marketing firm Square Two Design. "With the Olympics and the WTO, people
finally feel China is part of the international family. Now they need to
organize and prepare the game to international standards."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Ends Argentines' Ability to Avoid Visas</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>U.S. authorities on Wednesday banned Argentines from coming to the
United States without a visa because of worries about a growing exodus of
visitors seeking to flee their economically ravaged nation and find a
permanent--and illegal--home in America.</LD>
<LD>   The emergency order by the Justice Department marks the first time the
United States has thrown any country out of its visa waiver program,
which allows nearly 17 million business travelers and tourists a year
from 28 other nations to bypass the normal U.S. visa process.</LD>
<LD>   The United States is also examining the visa waiver status of five
other countries--Belgium, Italy, Portugal, Slovenia and Uruguay--because
of concerns about potential abuses. Those reviews were planned before
Sept. 11, but the terrorist attacks sped the process as authorities
pushed for wide-scale reforms to plug cracks in the immigration system.</LD>
<TE>   Argentine visitors, numbering more than 400,000 a year under the visa
waiver program, now will have to go through the time and paperwork of
getting a visa before they leave Argentina. U.S. officials said the
change, which was met with grudging acceptance from Argentina, will allow
them to do more vetting of prospective visitors.</TE>
<TE>   The decision is not intended as "a punishment" for Argentina, said
Christopher Lamora, a spokesman for the State Department's bureau of
consular affairs. "The decision is in order to make sure that the U.S.
government can effectively enforce U.S. immigration laws."</TE>
<TE>   The Immigration and Naturalization Service said the change is a step
toward preventing illegal overstays. The visa application process would
give U.S. officials an opportunity to sort through Argentine requests for
travel to America and turn down those who might have plans to stay in the
U.S. permanently but lack the legal status to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Since Argentina's economic collapse began late last year, many
residents have tried to leave the country for better opportunities
elsewhere, with skyrocketing numbers seeking to enter the United States,
Spain, Italy, Israel and other nations.</TE>
<TE>   New York and Miami have been particularly popular destinations. A
senior Argentine consulate official in Los Angeles, however, said there
has not been any noticeable increase in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The fiscal crisis enveloping Argentina gave an added urgency to that
nation's review and triggered the decision to remove it from the program,
officials said. Argentina's participation in the program was deemed to be
"no longer compatible with the enforcement of immigration laws of the
United States," the Justice Department said.</TE>
<TE>   "The economic instability was certainly a big part of this decision,"
said a Justice Department official who asked not to be identified. "There
was a concern that we'd have a lot of people coming to the United States
without intent to leave, and we've already seen some increase that gave
us reason for concern."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials have no firm numbers of Argentines who may be
overstaying the 90-day visits that are allowed them under the visa waiver
program.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few months, however, many would-be visitors from Argentina
admitted to customs officials at U.S. ports of entry that they wanted to
find permanent work here to escape the economic woes at home, U.S.
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Those people have been denied entry and sent back home. But visitors
who were less forthright with customs officials about their intentions
may have eluded detection, officials acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. residents have been allowed to travel to Argentina without a visa
since 1991, and Argentines visiting the United States have done the same
since 1996. An estimated 411,000 Argentines took advantage of the waiver
program to visit the United States without a visa in 2000, the last year
for which data are available, immigration officials said.</TE>
<TE>   But the visa waiver program "is based on the presumption that people
from a particular country or area would not have any particular reason to
want to stay," State Department spokesman Richard Boucher told reporters.
"When their circumstances change so dramatically back home, particularly
in economic ways, one has to reexamine some of those presumptions."</TE>
<TE>   Argentina, once home to one of the world's most envied economies, has
been wracked by worsening economic and political instability since late
last year. Unemployment has soared above 20%, the federal government
defaulted last month on part of its $141-billion debt, and the peso has
been devalued by more than half its value against the U.S. dollar.</TE>
<TE>   Embassies in Argentina have been besieged with people desperate to
secure entry visas and work permits, and according to a recent survey, a
third of the nation's 37 million people would like to leave the country
if they could.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly worrisome to national leaders is the fact that many young
people and professionals--people in a position to help rebuild the
economy--are among the potential exiles.</TE>
<TE>   Argentine officials, who were warned several weeks ago that they could
be cut from the waiver program, appeared to take the news in stride
Wednesday and lodged no formal objections. They said they were hopeful of
regaining the status.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an internal decision of the United States, and we understand
that," said an official at the Argentine Embassy in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The Argentine official characterized the U.S. decision as a
"preventive measure" and said it is too early to tell whether significant
numbers of Argentine visitors are actually overstaying their welcome in
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Because Argentina's economy only began veering toward full-scale
crisis in December, many visitors who came here since the onset of the
turmoil are still in the country legally under the 90-day window, he
noted.</TE>
<TE>   Argentines "are going to continue to come to the United States. They
are just going to have to get a visa to do it," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, with the new policy taking effect immediately, long lines of
Argentines who were angry and dismayed by the pending change formed
outside the U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires as they sought permission to
travel to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The change will be "a big deal" for Argentine travelers who will face
increased scrutiny in the future, predicted Mario Diament, an Argentine
professor at Florida International University in Miami, which has a large
population of Argentine-born residents.</TE>
<TE>   "If people mean to overstay their allotted time, they will, visa or no
visa," Diament said. "The new order applies to the people who will travel
next," Diament said.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department's decision could also intensify debate about
the future of the visa waiver program as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   Out of about 30 million short-term entries a year by foreigners into
the United States, more than half are from the visa-waiver countries,
which include France, Germany and Britain, along with a handful of
smaller countries.</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly, critics have argued that the program has contributed to
overstays by visitors, but supporters say it also has helped streamline a
vast wave of global travel and commerce.</TE>
<TE>   "The first question is, should we even have a visa waiver program,"
said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration
Studies, a group favoring more restrictive policies.</TE>
<TE>   "It probably makes sense as long as it's run as a tight ship. The
problem is we don't manage the thing as tightly as we should," he said.
"The INS doesn't have any idea who's going home and who hasn't. So
there's no yardstick to measure which countries should be participating
in the visa waiver program."</TE>
<TE>   To qualify for the waiver program, countries are supposed to meet
several criteria, including political and economic stability, passport
security and a low refusal rate by U.S. officials of their visa requests.</TE>
<TE>   But critics claim the program is vulnerable to abuse by criminals who
may use stolen or tampered-with passports to enter the United States or
who have illegally entered the visa waiver country before traveling to
America.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, [the Argentina decision] is the start of a trend," said
Dan Stein, executive director of the Federation for American Immigration
Reform, which favors deep cuts in immigration. "With 9 million illegal
immigrants in this country, clearly there's something wrong, and the visa
waiver program is a big part of it."</TE>

<HD>Riordan Faced Hurdles as a City Hall Outsider</HD>
<DH>Profile: As L.A.'s mayor he was at odds with the council, but
skirted normal channels to achieve some goals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TED ROHRLICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In eight years as mayor of Los Angeles, Richard Riordan never
mastered City Hall. Political obstacles, including sustained clashes with
the City Council, proved too much to overcome and forced him to alter the
visions of change that helped him win office in his first try.</LD>
<LD>   He failed, for instance, to expand the Los Angeles Police Department
as much as he wanted to, to streamline and make more equitable the city's
business taxes and to privatize some public services.</LD>
<LD>   But although he had difficulty working within the government, Riordan
excelled at finding ways around it, principally by mobilizing wealthy
acquaintances and friends.</LD>
<TE>   The multimillionaire lawyer and venture capitalist persuaded
supporters to give millions of dollars to improve police technology,
rewrite the city's charter, topple a Los Angeles school board, and
finance the Disney Concert Hall downtown when others had predicted it was
a lost cause. In so doing, he changed Los Angeles and revived, at least
temporarily, a dormant civic culture of noblesse oblige.</TE>
<TE>   Although he left office last year, Riordan's effectiveness as mayor
and his record in business are now at issue as he makes a bid to become
the Republican nominee for governor of California. At 71, he is running
on the same theme that he used in his first campaign for mayor, only this
time he is saying that he is "tough enough to turn California around."</TE>
<TE>   Even Riordan's critics say he lent a smart and fearless spirit to Los
Angeles as it recovered from rioting and, not long afterward, from the
costliest earthquake in U.S. history. Many say he improved local
government efficiency and the degree to which the city was perceived as
business-friendly.</TE>
<TE>   But his effectiveness was sharply limited--according to dozens of
political friends, adversaries and academics--by a generally short
attention span, a lack of first-rate communications skills, a lack of
experience as a high-level manager and an attitude toward government
workers and others that many took to be arrogant. He did little,
advocates say, for neighborhoods, housing or parks.</TE>
<TE>   "His great strength was that he could think outside the box about
government," said Cal State Fullerton political scientist Raphael
Sonenshein, who studies the politics of Los Angeles. "His great weakness
was that he didn't really like the government. It's hard to lead a body
you don't respect."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan declined through his campaign staff to be interviewed for this
article.</TE>
<TE>Taking Charge After '94 Quake</TE>
<TE>   Riordan's performance as mayor was circumscribed by national trends,
natural disasters and other events over which he had little control.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the city was rocked by recession,
crime waves, one police brutality scandal after another and,
climactically, widespread rioting.</TE>
<TE>   All that seemed to be left was a major earthquake, and the city got
one six months into Riordan's first term on Jan. 17, 1994. He responded
with what friends and foes regarded as a bravura performance.</TE>
<TE>   An hour or so after the 6.7 magnitude Northridge quake struck at 4:30
a.m. he was at the city's bunker-like emergency command center, ahead of
the police chief, leading by example. He ordered food for city workers
from a 24-hour restaurant he owns, the Original Pantry, and projected a
reassuring, avuncular presence.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan was a "horizon thinker," said Robin Kramer, the
longest-tenured of his five chiefs of staff. In this case, Riordan
foresaw a likelihood of increased panic as lenders foreclosed on
borrowers with damaged properties. He set out to lobby the controller of
the currency, who sat atop the banks' regulatory food chain, to make sure
banks were told to ease up.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan and the city benefited from a personal relationship with
President Clinton, who had his own political reasons to help Los Angeles
in the hope that it would help him carry California in 1996. The
Riordan-Clinton relationship was brokered by William Wardlaw, the
hands-on chairman of Clinton's 1992 California drive, who was Riordan's
closest friend and longtime business associate. Throughout most of
Riordan's time in office, Wardlaw would serve as a sort of shadow
advisor, helping guide the administration's political direction from the
sidelines and continually intervening with the White House.</TE>
<TE>   The federal response to Los Angeles' needs after the earthquake was
"amazing," said Keith Comrie, a die-hard Riordan critic who was the
city's chief administrative officer at the time. After a disastrous
hurricane, Florida had people living in tents and trailers for a year,
but Clinton cabinet members arrived in Los Angeles with the power to move
quickly. "We had [displaced] people out of the parks and into housing
within a few weeks," Comrie said.</TE>
<TE>   While recovering rapidly from the quake, most Los Angeles residents
also began to benefit from what became the longest national peacetime
economic expansion on record.</TE>
<TE>   The city itself was far from transformed. The gap between rich and
poor widened in the boom, according to figures compiled by the Milken
Institute.</TE>
<TE>   But unemployment declined and tax revenues swelled, eventually
enabling Riordan to increase spending for the kind of quality-of-life
services that were marginalized in harder times. Tree trimming, street
resurfacing and the hours that local libraries and park facilities were
open all increased.</TE>
<TE>   There was also a precipitous fall in crime. Riordan had made reducing
crime his top priority and, in pursuit of it, expanded the police force.
He fell short of his principal campaign promise to boost LAPD ranks by
3,000 officers in four years. Relying in part on Clinton administration
grants, he was able to add 2,200 officers.</TE>
<TE>   But a third of that gain eroded as departures outpaced recruitments in
a department plagued by sagging morale.</TE>
<TE>   How much of the drop in crime was the result of the police buildup
remains an unanswerable question. For six of Riordan's eight years in
office, the drop in Los Angeles exceeded that in most big cities,
although New York experienced even more dramatic declines.</TE>
<TE>   Near the end of his tenure, homicides and other violent crimes leveled
off nationwide. They started to creep back up in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>Handling of Rampart Scandal Criticized</TE>
<TE>   Although Riordan focused on expanding the size of the LAPD, he did
little to strengthen civilian oversight over a department that for years
had resisted it--a noteworthy omission in a city that had experienced two
riots linked to police misconduct in 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   When the Rampart scandal--with its allegations of rogue officers
shooting innocent people, framing suspects and lying--broke in 1999, some
civic and City Council leaders thought they could not trust the police to
get to the bottom of it. They proposed impaneling an independent
commission with authority to issue subpoenas and grant administrative
immunity to officers who had seen wrongdoing but had not come forward.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan resisted. He wanted to leave the investigation and the
disciplinary decisions to a manager he had selected--Bernard C. Parks,
the police chief he appointed in 1997, who opposed granting immunity. In
Parks, Riordan believed he had a worthy manager, associates said.</TE>
<TE>   When Parks and the LAPD produced their own internal examination of the
Rampart scandal, Riordan's first response was to back the LAPD's version
of events. At a contentious news conference, he called the report the
best self-examination by a public agency "in the history of mankind."</TE>
<TE>   Then, in answer to a question, Riordan acknowledged that he had not
finished reading it.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who were not willing to trust Riordan and the LAPD to
address police misconduct under such circumstances were attorneys in the
U.S. Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. They had been
investigating the LAPD for several years and were familiar with the
department's failure to adopt some of the reforms urged by the
Christopher Commission, impaneled in 1991 after the Rodney King beating
and charged with making recommendations to deter use of excessive force.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly a decade after that report, Civil Rights Division lawyers
formally notified city leaders that they were prepared to sue the city
government for tolerating a pattern of misconduct by a minority of police
in Rampart and elsewhere. The Justice Department said it could prove that
officers used excessive force, made false arrests and undertook
unreasonable searches--and that management had failed to stop them.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department lawyers said the only way for the city to avoid
being sued was to sign an agreement to implement reforms, under the
supervision of a federal judge who could hold leaders in contempt of
court if they balked.</TE>
<TE>   Joined by Parks, Riordan tried to make an end run around the Civil
Rights Division attorneys, aides said, lobbying Congress and the White
House in an attempt to bring pressure on Atty. Gen. Janet Reno to call
them off. Some advisors to the mayor cautioned that such a course was a
waste of time and energy, but he pursued it anyway for months, only to
fail. In the end, he signed the consent decree.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles civil rights attorney Connie Rice, whom Riordan appointed
as a water and power commissioner, said Riordan had many good qualities.
"With all of his heart he has a civic morality. He feels a duty of the
rich to contribute, not just sit in their gated communities and let the
city rot." But, she said, he had no feel for police reform.</TE>
<TE>Many Called Mayor's Attitude Arrogant</TE>
<TE>   A defining aspect of Riordan's mayoralty was his low regard for the
City Council. He angered some members by the way he introduced himself
politically: sponsoring an initiative to limit local office-holders,
including council members, to two terms.</TE>
<TE>   Intimates said Riordan respected only one of the council's 15 members.
That was the late Council President John Ferraro, who, like Riordan, had
been a millionaire businessman before turning to public life.</TE>
<TE>   The disregard was mutual. "Hate's a good word" for the way some
council members felt about him, said former Councilman Rudy Svorinich, a
gregarious former paint store owner who felt he and Riordan had good
rapport.</TE>
<TE>   One problem was that many saw Riordan's prevailing attitude as
arrogance.</TE>
<TE>   Lesa Slaughter, the shortest-tenured of his chiefs of staff, described
it as "I'm right. Therefore, I don't care what you think of me."</TE>
<TE>   Another was Riordan's reluctance to make public his intentions until
the last moment. "All most people on the council wanted was a little
respect, an answer to questions like, 'What's in the budget?' " said
Xandra Kayden, a senior fellow at UCLA's school of public policy.</TE>
<TE>   A costly distrust developed, said the council's chief legislative
analyst, Ronald Deaton, a frequent Riordan adversary. "He lost the
ability to put forth a program and have the program reviewed on its
merits."</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated by having to share power with the council, Riordan pushed
to change the rules of city government through a new City Charter that
would limit the council's power and create a stronger mayor.</TE>
<TE>   He wanted, for instance, to make department heads exclusively
accountable to the mayor--not to both the mayor and the City Council. He
also wanted the mayor to have the power to appoint his own city attorney
for civil matters.</TE>
<TE>   Critics thought he was being petulant. "It was kind of like, I can't
play by the rules and win, so I'll change the rules," said John Perez, a
Riordan-appointed human relations commissioner, United Food and
Commercial Workers Union leader and Democratic activist.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan argued that his real mission was government efficiency.</TE>
<TE>   As he pursued the City Charter overhaul, money was no object. He
contributed more than $500,000 and solicited donations from friends for
more than a million more.</TE>
<TE>   Their money went to fund a petition drive and back a slate of
candidates for a charter revision commission.</TE>
<TE>   The first round of that process was a setback for Riordan. Most of the
candidates he backed lost to a rival slate endorsed by the only other
well-funded group that cared much about city government--the city
employee unions.</TE>
<TE>   The unions cared mainly about preserving civil service job
protections. Riordan would have preferred to scrap them, aides said. But,
in a strategic concession that would shape the rest of the debate, he
agreed not to challenge them as a way of giving himself a chance to win
over charter commissioners on the issue he cared about most--more mayoral
power.</TE>
<TE>   As key votes approached, Riordan coaxed and threatened. The chairman
of the elected charter commission, USC law professor Erwin Chemerinsky,
said two members with ambitions of being elected to City Council told him
that Riordan promised to endorse them and in one case provide funds. He
said a third member told him that a Riordan associate pressured him
through his employer.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Riordan was forced to compromise. He was outmaneuvered by some
other officials, most notably then-City Atty. James K. Hahn, who beat
back Riordan's effort to split his office in two.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan nevertheless emerged with a significant increase in mayoral
authority in a new proposed charter, the first significant rewriting of
city rules in generations. Voters approved it after yet another
campaign--again backed financially by Riordan and his wealthy supporters.</TE>
<TE>Riordan's Wealth Gave Him Free Rein</TE>
<TE>   What voters seemed to enjoy most about Riordan was the way he made it
plain that he did not need their money. Just about everyone questioned in
political focus groups knew one thing about him: As mayor, he turned down
the city's $173,000-a-year salary and took just $1 a year.</TE>
<TE>   He could afford to do things his way. By the time he ran for mayor, he
had turned an inheritance of less than $100,000 into a fortune of more
than $100 million, which he then, to limit possible conflicts of
interest, placed into what he said was a blind trust.</TE>
<TE>   As mayor, he styled himself as a populist who was primarily interested
in helping the poor. But his investments over the years showed continuing
tension between efforts to help the poor and pursuit of profits that
sometimes hurt them.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan's first big scores were stock purchases. He invested in
Syntex, a small pharmaceutical company that came up with the world's
first birth control pill shortly after he bought in. Later, he hit what
he called his "home run," multiplying his investment nearly 300 times,
with a company called Convergent Technologies that pioneered
"intelligent" computer workstations made possible by the advent of small
computer chips.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the 1980s, Riordan bought three apartment buildings near his
Pantry restaurant at 9th and Figueroa and evicted all of the low-income
tenants so the buildings could be razed and replaced with offices.</TE>
<TE>   A Times analysis of eight of his biggest deals in the 1980s--all but
one a leveraged buyout--showed that he made an overall profit of $74
million. As companies were loaded with debt, bought and sold, thousands
lost jobs. Collectively, however, the deals resulted in a net gain of 14
jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Asked by business writer L.J. Davis in 1988 how he could justify
"flipping companies like cards," Riordan answered, "Greed. Eventually,
you have to get your money out."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "I'm taking lessons in learning how to wave to the poor
people." Asked about the remarks years later, Riordan said they were
failed attempts at humor, taken out of context and inconsistent with his
commitment to social justice.</TE>
<TE>   Interested in using his money to support philanthropy, Riordan created
the Riordan Foundation in the early 1980s. It has since given out more
than $30 million in grants to pay for computer-assisted literacy programs
for elementary schools and and other programs that serve youth.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan's compassion for the poor sometimes collided with his sense of
what was good public policy for Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   On the matter of requiring city contractors to pay a wage
significantly above the state minimum, for instance, Riordan said it was
immoral for businesses not to pay a "living wage" and noted that he paid
unionized workers at his restaurant salaries higher than would have been
required by the proposed living wage ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   But he vetoed the proposal, saying it would have been bad for
business.</TE>
<TE>   The council overrode him.</TE>
<TE>Business Climate Improved Overall</TE>
<TE>   Riordan didn't work miracles in attracting businesses to Los Angeles.
External forces such as mergers continued the exodus of Fortune 500
companies that were headquartered in the city. The chamber of commerce
says there are now three left. And the city continued to lose
manufacturing jobs and gain service jobs, which tend to be lower paying.</TE>
<TE>   But Riordan improved both the city's overall business climate and some
of the ways in which city government related to private firms, economists
and business people say.</TE>
<TE>   Carol Schatz, who heads a business lobbying group called the Central
City Assn. and served as a Riordan appointee on the board of the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said that putting a
business-friendly face on the city was "the critical value of his
mayoralty."</TE>
<TE>   Economist Jack Kyser of the nonprofit Los Angeles County Economic
Development Corp. lauded Riordan for starting a "business team" in the
mayor's office designed to help firms solve their problems and get them
to remain in or relocate to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say that Riordan and his team operated without a clear
economic development strategy and used public subsidies unwisely to help
attract mainly retailers with low-paying jobs.</TE>
<TE>   But Kyser said it was a move in the right direction. "It's like you
had a car and the thing was in reverse and I think Riordan got it moving
forward again at a pretty good speed. It may not have gone down quite the
roads that people wanted, but at least you had positive momentum."</TE>
<TE>   As a candidate, Riordan portrayed city government as in need of a
"management revolution." He advocated privatizing an array of city
services, but city employee unions and others checked him.</TE>
<TE>   Julie Butcher, general manager of the Service Employees International
Union Local 347, which represented many of the threatened workers, said
that to fight off privatization, workers created greater efficiencies
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "If he'd had any attention span or been more competent, we wouldn't
have been able to beat him," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan had no substantial management experience himself. As a
businessman, he was an investor who bet on the ability of others to run
companies--and, in fact, his choices of general managers for city
departments generally received high marks around City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   But in seeking the mayor's office, he made what some considered a
rookie manager's mistake, calling workers in an organization he was about
to head "brain-dead." Once ensconced in City Hall, he would not let them
forget it. William Fujioka, the city's personnel director and later its
chief administrative officer, said the mayor and his staff repeatedly
observed "that if they [city workers] were smart, they wouldn't be
working for the city."</TE>
<TE>Mixed Reaction to Efforts on Schools</TE>
<TE>   Especially in his second term, Riordan became a fierce and outspoken
critic of the Los Angeles Unified School District, which he blamed for
failing to give children the education they deserved.</TE>
<TE>   Although Riordan had no formal authority over schools, he did not let
that stop him. He and his wealthy backers raised millions of dollars for
insurgent school board candidates. They won, installing a new board
majority that promised to shake up the management of L.A. Unified.</TE>
<TE>   While some credited Riordan for finally channeling public discontent
with local schools into political actions, others were less impressed.
Listening to the mayor tout this as the most significant achievement of
his mayoralty, San Fernando Valley secession advocate Richard Close
remembered feeling disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   "It underscored how little he'd accomplished as mayor," said Close,
president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. and chairman of the
secession group, Valley VOTE. "He could have written those checks without
serving one day as mayor."</TE>
<TE>   Close faulted Riordan for a weak commitment to improving average
people's lives in their neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly Martin, Riordan's last chief of staff, defended his record in
the neighborhoods, saying the mayor put significant effort into cleaning
up graffiti and closing alleys that were magnets for crime and illegal
dumping.</TE>
<TE>   A large part of Riordan's neighborhood revitalization efforts involved
taking money that had been traditionally used for subsidized housing and
redirecting it to selected neighborhoods where council members and
neighborhood people could jointly decide how to spend it.</TE>
<TE>   Jan Breidenbach, director of the Southern California Assn. of
Non-Profit Housing, said she fought the diversions, usually
unsuccessfully. "In terms of [subsidized] housing, he didn't do anything
really," she said of Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   Nor did Riordan spend all of the federal anti-poverty funds that were
available to him. When he left office, more than $200 million in federal
grants remained unspent. Riordan aides attributed that to bureaucratic
delays, but USC political science professor Michael Preston said he found
Riordan's failure to spend the money "very disturbing. . . . If you look
at neighborhood revitalization, there are no positive marks I can give
him."</TE>
<TE>   As Riordan's time in office wound down, he launched a quixotic
campaign on behalf of neighborhoods. It showcased the high-minded sense
of purpose that he said had brought him to public life--a desire to save
a city in distress. But, for some, it also highlighted how much he had
left undone.</TE>
<TE>   It began when, by happenstance, the mayor was approached by a woman at
a community meeting who complained that her neighborhood park, Vermont
Square, was a crime magnet. Her daughter had been shot there.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, who lost two children of his own, was touched, and he vowed
on the spot to clean that park within two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan then spun that notion forward into a short-lived but ambitious
program--to fix up one city park every two weeks for the rest of his time
in office. He himself showed up in Vermont Square to help repaint a
graffitied gazebo.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan took pride in the effort, but parks advocate Robert Garcia saw
it as too little, too late. As director of a project at the Center for
Law in the Public Interest that focuses on equal access to the parks for
the poor, Garcia said he had been talking to Riordan for years about the
bad shape of parks in poor areas, without much effect.</TE>

<HD>Pilgrims Again Get Blame for Official's Death</HD>
<DH>Asia: Afghan foreign minister, contradicting Karzai's account, says
accused security agents may have merely incited the airport mob.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ZUCCHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>After a third official attempt to explain the death last week of
Afghanistan's aviation minister, the circumstances of the killing were
left murkier than ever Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The country's foreign minister contradicted the prime minister by
telling reporters that the Feb. 14 airport slaying of Abdul Rahman was
not premeditated but rather a spontaneous act sparked by the anger of
Muslim pilgrims whose flights had been delayed.</LD>
<LD>   Foreign Minister Abdullah said three of the senior government security
officials accused in the killing were among the pilgrims traveling to
Mecca. He said they "might have provoked feelings" among hundreds of the
pilgrims, or hajjis, enraged after waiting more than two days for flights
to the Saudi holy city.</LD>
<TE>   "A premeditated plan suggests a totally different situation. It does
not account for the anger of the hajjis" toward Rahman, Abdullah said.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after the slaying of Rahman, who was air transportation
and tourism minister, blame fell on the pilgrims, who had been waiting
for their flights in subfreezing temperatures on the darkened airport
tarmac and inside an unlighted, unheated terminal. Three pilgrims had
died of exposure the night before, Abdullah said.</TE>
<TE>   But in the government's first official explanation, given the day
after the slaying, interim Afghan Prime Minister Hamid Karzai blamed a
conspiracy. Two days later, he said the killing had no political
overtones and was strictly a personal vendetta.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Abdullah returned to the pilgrims theory, saying the
killers were part of a mob that confronted Rahman at the airport, where
he was leaving on a business trip. The pilgrims accused Rahman of taking
over a plane meant for them, government officials have said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked Wednesday whom reporters should believe, the prime minister or
the foreign minister, Abdullah smiled and replied, "Both of us."</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah said no one in the Cabinet or government believes that the
killing was premeditated or politically motivated. There was no comment
Wednesday from Karzai, but one Cabinet minister told Associated Press
that he believes the prime minister's version. That suggested a lack of
unanimity within the government, if not an outright split.</TE>
<TE>   The slaying has caught the interim government flat-footed, both
because of security lapses that allowed the killers to strike and then
flee to Saudi Arabia and because of the conflicting official accounts.</TE>
<TE>   This week, the government announced that, in addition to the police
investigation, a probe was being launched by two Cabinet members.</TE>
<TE>   Rahman's death has prompted reports of a rogue faction within the
government's security apparatus, led by Panjshir Valley ethnic Tajiks
from the Northern Alliance who wield power at the expense of majority
Pushtuns. The three top security officials charged are so-called
Panjshiris, as are most of the senior police officials investigating the
crime.</TE>
<TE>   Rahman had quit the Jamiat-i-Islami party, dominated by Panjshiris,
several years ago and shifted his allegiance to supporters of
Afghanistan's deposed king, Mohammad Zaher Shah. When Karzai linked the
slaying to a long-standing feud, he appeared to be referring to Rahman's
falling-out with the party.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah was the longtime spokesman for Jamiat-i-Islami. Karzai, a
Pushtun, is not a party member.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah said Rahman was attacked on the plane and then thrown to the
tarmac, where he was beaten by a mob of pilgrims. Autopsy results have
not been released, but Rahman's relatives have said he was stabbed.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah said he could not confirm that any of the three suspects had
been arrested in Saudi Arabia, contradicting Karzai, who told reporters
Sunday that two of the men had been captured and were being returned to
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have named the three as Gen. Abdullah Jan Tawhidi, the
deputy intelligence chief; Gen. Kalandar Beg, a deputy defense minister;
and Abdul Haleem, a deputy justice minister. Karzai has flatly accused
them of killing Rahman, saying, "They have committed a murder."</TE>
<TE>   Three other top security officials have been arrested in Kabul,
according to authorities. It is not clear whether they are suspected of
taking part in the slaying or of involvement in security lapses.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah said the killing highlighted "shortcomings and deficits for
which all of us in government are responsible."</TE>

<HD>4 Terror Suspects Arrested in Italy</HD>
<DH>Europe: Authorities say Moroccans had cyanide compound and maps of
Rome highlighting the water supply system and the U.S. Embassy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ROME
</DL>
<LD>Italian authorities said Wednesday that they had arrested four
Moroccans in possession of a plastic bag containing a cyanide compound,
along with maps of Rome highlighting the U.S. Embassy and the city's
water supply system.</LD>
<LD>   Italian news media said police were investigating a possible plot to
poison the water in an aqueduct feeding the embassy and surrounding
neighborhoods. One of the four suspects, the reports said, is believed to
have ties to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network.</LD>
<LD>   There were conflicting accounts, however, about whether the contents
of the powder-filled bag could have harmed anyone. The bag, said to weigh
nearly 9 pounds, was seized from a suburban Rome apartment Tuesday in a 4
a.m. police raid that rousted the suspects from their sleep.</LD>
<TE>   Italian officials told the U.S. Embassy that the bag apparently
contained potassium cyanide, easy to buy in Italy and commonly used by
farmers to kill rodents. Nine pounds of potassium cyanide dissolved in a
few thousand gallons of water or less could be lethal to anyone drinking
it, according to Rome University pharmacologist Luciano Caprino.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials took the report seriously. They issued a statement
thanking the Italian police and security forces for "excellent work
concerning the most recent security threat against the embassy."</TE>
<TE>   Later, Italian Chief Prosecutor Salvatore Vecchione said judicial
police had tentatively identified the bag's contents as potassium
ferrocyanide. That compound, used to make wine and ink dye, contains
small amounts of cyanide and is harmless when dissolved in water,
pharmacologist Caprino said.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor ordered further analysis of the compound but clamped a
lid on new information about the case. He said Italian media reports of
the arrests Wednesday had damaged the investigation, making it difficult
to catch other suspects.</TE>
<TE>   That didn't stop Justice Minister Roberto Castelli from boasting that
the raid demonstrated Italy's stand "on the front line in the fight
against international terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   European law enforcement officials have been worried about
bioterrorism since the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States. They say
they have uncovered evidence that Al Qaeda and associated groups have
been gathering chemicals to manufacture poisons for assassinations and
other terrorist operations.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, police dismantled what they called an Al Qaeda cell near
Milan and arrested seven Tunisians, who are now on trial on charges of
criminal association with intent to obtain and transport arms, explosives
and chemicals. In wiretapped conversations before their arrests, the
defendants spoke cryptically about an unspecified "liquid" that would
suffocate anyone breathing it.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say the alleged leader of the cell, Essid Sami ben
Khemais, is suspected of--but not charged with--supervising a plot to
attack the U.S. Embassy here in January 2001. Word of the plot prompted
the embassy to shut down for three days that month.</TE>
<TE>   At least one of the four Moroccans arrested Tuesday is linked to the
busted Milan cell, Italian newspapers said. None of the four men, said to
be in their 30s, was named. Two were said to be working legally as
telephone operators; the others were described as illegal immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Italian state radio said police who raided the men's apartment in Tor
Bella Monaca, a southern suburb, found Arabic-language videos and
agendas--which had not yet been translated by police--and about 100 blank
documents used to certify that a foreigner has permission to live in
Italy.</TE>
<TE>   Along with up-to-date diagrams of the city's water system, the police
found a city map with the U.S. Embassy circled in red, Italian newspapers
reported. Italy's ANSA news agency said the bag allegedly containing the
cyanide compound wasn't hidden.</TE>
<TE>   Police had followed the suspects for days, and their detention was
related to the arrest of three other Moroccan immigrants in the same
suburb last week, Italian media reported.</TE>

<HD>Keeping the Peace in Kabul's War Zone</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Patrolling the ravaged capital may not be exciting,
but the elite British force that does so keeps streets safe, locals say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALERIE REITMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>They've patrolled in Sierra Leone, East Timor, Bosnia, Kosovo,
Northern Ireland and other war zones. But never, says Sgt. Martin
Seville, have the "lads" seen a place as devastated as this.</LD>
<LD>   The soldiers of the elite British battalion nicknamed "2 Para"--short
for 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment--are part of the 4,000-strong
multinational peacekeeping force deployed here in the Afghan capital to
help police maintain order.</LD>
<LD>   On this night, a dozen 2 Para soldiers, rifles cocked, are cruising
the deserted blocks of the city's worst neighborhood. Suddenly, a voice
shouts, "Draish!"--Pashto for "halt." A man appears from the darkness, a
Kalashnikov rifle at the ready.</LD>
<TE>   Seville yells, "Kill the lights!" The driver shuts off the headlights
and engine, and they sit in the stillness of the night, the below-zero
windchill burning their cheeks. A local interpreter jumps out of the
vehicle and tells the man--a local police officer, it turns
out--tonight's password so each side knows that the other is friendly.</TE>
<TE>   With no electricity whatsoever and not a car in sight, by night this
neighborhood on Kabul's south side seems like some cinematographer's
vision of the hell left by a nuclear bomb.</TE>
<TE>   As the soldiers pass block after block of crumbled mud-and-brick
walls, the patrol vehicle's headlights bounce eerily through empty
buildings, their windows, doors and most of their roofs destroyed by
civil warfare of the early 1990s. In one lot, about 100 carcasses of
buses lie stripped and rusted.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan's interim leader, Hamid Karzai, and senior U.N. officials
have appealed for as many as 10 times the number of peacekeepers now in
Kabul to spread beyond the capital, to help prevent the deadly ethnic
clashes that have occurred in several Afghan cities. So far, the U.S. has
resisted requests to lend any of its forces to the peacekeeping effort.</TE>
<TE>   Although the peacekeepers, officially known as the International
Security Assistance Force, or ISAF, have been called to assist in
handling only a few armed robberies, their patrols provide confidence to
the Afghan locals, some of whom offer thanks at the mosque for the
troops' presence.</TE>
<TE>   "Foreign police are much better," said Mir Abdul Aziz, 52, echoing the
comments of several residents in the neighborhood. "For 20 years we've
been living in fear, and now we feel secure."</TE>
<TE>   Crime rates have fallen as a result, local police say.</TE>
<TE>   The work isn't without its tough calls and tragedies. Over the
weekend, peacekeepers apparently killed a local man taking his pregnant
sister-in-law, in labor, to the hospital well after the 10 p.m. curfew.
The peacekeeping mission claimed that its forces opened fire only after
being fired upon.</TE>
<TE>   But witnesses and local police say the peacekeepers fired without
provocation, unleashing a hail of 60 bullets that killed Amaun Isaq.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, said local Police Chief Mohammed Ismael Samdon, the soldiers
heard the noisy start of the car and saw Isaq's kerosene lantern and the
headlights of the car and mistook them for the flash of a gun. The
peacekeeping mission says that the case is under investigation and that
two of the soldiers have been sent back to Britain.</TE>
<TE>   "When they came, we thought there'd be no more disasters or fighting,"
said Masrullah Yaqubi, the dead man's uncle. "On the contrary, they've
become the cause of the misfortune in the country."</TE>
<TE>   But the local police chiefs and most people interviewed around here
still say there's no question that the presence of the peacekeepers
deters crime.</TE>
<TE>   "The longer they're here, the safer it is," said Mohammed Hashem, 29,
who was out talking with his friends the other day.</TE>
<TE>   The local police are hobbled before they even begin: They have no
patrol cars, only a few weapons or uniforms, no telephones and only
kerosene lamps to light their way. Delivering a message to a chief from
another station could take hours. The peacekeeping mission gave them
their first walkie-talkies--and new bicycles--this week.</TE>
<TE>   And protection in some police districts isn't always meted out evenly.
Minority ethnic groups, such as the Hazaras, have brought complaints
directly to ISAF, because they feel that the police themselves are
involved in the crimes, one peacekeeper said. It doesn't help that the
police haven't been paid for months of work.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. Army major, David Buckingham, who was sent to 2 Para as part of
a professional exchange program between the 82nd Airborne based in Ft.
Bragg, N.C., and the British battalion, is in charge of the battalion's
post in a devastated neighborhood school.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether the U.S. should send troops here as peacekeepers, he
said, "The U.S. has its hands full." The men of 2 Para, he said, would
trade places with the U.S. Special Forces in a heartbeat.</TE>
<TE>   "My guys [in 2 Para] would be happier kicking through caves,
interdicting convoys and pockets of Al Qaeda or Taliban soldiers," said
Buckingham, 36, a former U.S. Army Ranger.</TE>
<TE>   When his troops arrived here in December, Buckingham said, he was
shocked by the disparity between the majesty of the mountains that ring
Kabul like giant white-ridged cones and the devastation of the city.</TE>
<TE>   Even by day, it's hard to believe that anyone could call this
neighborhood home. The skeletons of homes, schools and university
buildings that once formed a vibrant and affluent neighborhood are the
legacy of the last decade's civil war.</TE>
<TE>   Yet thousands of Afghans have moved into any pocket of a crumbling
building that may have an intact ceiling and a few standing walls. A
single intact room in a demolished house or apartment building might hold
an entire family, such as that of Ghulam Dastgeer and his wife, Shazia,
both 35.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent day, the couple and their eight children huddled around a
blanket-covered table, under which sat a coal hibachi.</TE>
<TE>   "America should provide security and kill the thieves," said Dastgeer,
a laborer who said he has no work now that it's winter. "They should take
the weapons and ammunition out of every house."</TE>
<TE>   Life, however, has gradually been returning to normal.</TE>
<TE>   Women and children tote buckets and plastic gas canisters to the water
pumps on the streets, carry their dough to the bakery to cook into loaves
of flatbread, called naan, and try to scrape by. Every day since the fall
of the Taliban late last year, there has been more activity: more
vegetables, meats and grains available in the bazaar, and more wood
stoves being pounded out of sheet metal by locals in tiny foundries made
out of old freight containers.</TE>
<TE>   After meeting the Kalashnikov-carrying policeman, Seville asks him
whether anything has happened. The policeman replies that a body was
found in a well: The victim was a Pushtun, the majority ethnic group in
Afghanistan. Many Pushtuns supported the Taliban and are not very popular
in northern Afghanistan. He was wearing old shoes, the officer explains,
suggesting that he was killed not for his money but for ethnic reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "Amniat!" the local policeman shouts--meaning it's safe to pass.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, the 2 Para officers are bored, but the locals hope
that the peacekeepers won't leave.</TE>
<TE>   "We need and require peacekeeping forces," says another police chief,
Mohammed Zim. "Our people require permanent peace--we've had such a hard
time. I hope they won't leave us alone."</TE>

<HD>Pastrana Breaks Off Peace Talks</HD>
<DH>Latin America: Colombian president calls kidnapping of senator last
straw, gives FARC rebels 12 hours to leave demilitarized zone.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CURRILLO, Colombia
</DL>
<LD>President Andres Pastrana broke off peace negotiations with the
country's largest rebel group, giving the guerrillas until noon today to
leave the special demilitarized zone created for talks.</LD>
<LD>   In a nationally televised address, Pastrana said guerrillas from the
FARC--the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia--had crossed the line
Wednesday when they hijacked a plane and kidnapped Sen. Jorge Gechen
Turbay, 50, president of the Colombian Senate's peace commission.</LD>
<LD>   Several guerrillas, including two women, reportedly boarded a local
flight carrying the senator and forced it to land on a highway outside
the capital, Bogota, where they seized the senator and presumably took
him back to the zone.</LD>
<TE>   "Today the glass of indignation spilled over," Pastrana said. "It's
not possible to sign agreements on one side while putting guns to the
head on the other. . . . Now no one believes in their willingness to
reach peace."</TE>
<TE>   Rebel leaders issued a response early today in which they angrily
accused Pastrana of using war as a political tactic. The first round of
presidential elections in Colombia begins in May, and congressional
elections take place next month. Candidates pushing a hard line against
the FARC have become increasingly popular as ordinary Colombians grow
tired of the up-and-down peace process.</TE>
<TE>   "The president has shown his commitment to war," the rebel communique
said.</TE>
<TE>   Pastrana's decision marks the most serious rupture in a recent series
of crises in the 3-year-old peace process.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Pastrana gave the rebels 48 hours to leave the zone, which
was created in an attempt to end Colombia's nearly 40-year-old civil war
between government forces and leftist rebels.</TE>
<TE>   But last-minute intervention from the United Nations and ambassadors
from 10 countries allowed the process to continue.</TE>
<TE>   It was difficult to see how such intervention could succeed again,
especially given the 12-hour time frame that Pastrana gave the rebels to
evacuate.</TE>
<TE>   The guerrillas were expected to leave the five small towns that exist
in the Switzerland-size zone and flee into the surrounding jungle, where
they have dominated for most of the civil war.</TE>
<TE>   "I support his decision. There was no other decision he could have
made," said Juan Camilo Restrepo, who is running to replace Pastrana.</TE>
<TE>   Pastrana, a Conservative Party member, is constitutionally banned from
running for a second term.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Troops Tense After Sniper Fire</HD>
<DH>Security: Officials speculate that the gunmen at the Kandahar
airport were well equipped and disciplined. They expect more attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KANDAHAR, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Darren McDonough was wrapping up a routine check of the perimeter
with a stop at the last foxhole under his command when he heard a series
of rapid cracks from across the barbed wire about 55 yards away.</LD>
<LD>   It was sniper fire at the U.S.-controlled Kandahar airport, a
theoretically secure site where the tension, for good reason, is
palpable.</LD>
<LD>   McDonough, a first sergeant in the Army's 101st Airborne Division,
plunged into the dust and started firing toward the muzzle flashes. Two
bunkers away, Cpl. Anthony Mata was tucked behind a pile of sandbags,
taking fire that left his bunker pocked with bullet holes. He called for
help.</LD>
<TE>   "I see it, I see it," McDonough said as he ran toward Mata in the
pitch blackness.</TE>
<TE>   Sparks flew as a spray of bullets struck corrugated steel on the
runway. McDonough crouched behind a mound of sand, but the rounds kept
coming, sending him tumbling to the ground on his back. Dazed, he ran a
hand across the nape of his neck. It felt wet.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'm hit," he said into his radio.</TE>
<TE>   The Feb. 13 incident that sent the base into its highest state of
alert highlights the lingering tension among American soldiers over
security here.</TE>
<TE>   Military strategists have gone far to tighten security for troops
stationed overseas ever since the 1996 truck bombing of Khobar Towers, an
Air Force housing complex in Saudi Arabia, said Col. Keith Bartsch,
commander of the Air Force's 19th Air Support Operations Squadron.</TE>
<TE>   "The military's learned a lot of lessons," Bartsch said. "Khobar
Towers, things like that--that won't happen here."</TE>
<TE>   It is a commentary on Afghanistan that the soldiers here say the
airport is the safest it has been since the war began Oct. 7. Several
hundred yards away, Air Force mechanic Tech. Sgt. Kenneth Main slept
through the Feb. 13 firefight. Despite the prospect of terrorists testing
modes of entry into the base, he said he isn't taking additional
precautions.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to act like that would happen at any time," said Main, 36.</TE>
<TE>   Military strategists expect further attempts at the airport, which has
been a dangerous place for a couple of decades. Along the runway lie the
hulks of helicopters destroyed during the Soviet Union's failed war in
Afghanistan in the 1980s. One of them is little more than a single rotor
blade jutting diagonally about 15 feet into the dusty Kandahar sky.</TE>
<TE>   As McDonough and other military officials tell it, the Feb. 13 attack
was carried out by three groups of two disciplined gunmen each taking
turns firing and reloading, apparently using night-vision goggles to
track their targets.</TE>
<TE>   Apache helicopters were dispatched, their pilots equipped with
night-vision technology to look for the attackers. But no enemy fighters
were captured, and no bodies were found. The search was hampered because
the fire came from across an area riddled with mines, beyond the
concertina wire that surrounds the base.</TE>
<TE>   McDonough and other Army officials here believe that the gunmen were
disciplined soldiers sending carefully calculated exploratory fire into
American positions, probing for weaknesses they could later exploit.</TE>
<TE>   "It is clearly probing fire trying to find a hole, trying to find the
weaknesses. Trying to find complacency. Trying to find anything they can
to exploit and get in here and do something," said Col. Frank Wiercinski,
the top officer managing the base for the 101st Airborne.</TE>
<TE>   Army Lt. Col. Charles Preysler, praising his troops for driving away
an enemy who has not been identified, has recommended the 101st Airborne
soldiers for combat medals.</TE>
<TE>   Still taking fire, Mata bolted out of his bunker and around the first
in a row of 10-foot-high berms. Turning the corner, he collided with
McDonough.</TE>
<TE>   "They weren't just shooting blindly. They were shooting at us,"
McDonough recalled. "Certainly if you look out 50 meters away you
couldn't see somebody running without night-vision equipment."</TE>
<TE>   Mata "put his body on top of mine," said McDonough, 31. "One hand was
firing, returning fire, and with the other hand he was pulling me back
behind this berm. . . . He reached down and wiped the blood off. Then he
told me, 'Hey sir, you're just scratched. You're good.' I was like,
'Roger.' Then he said, 'We gotta get out of here.' I was like, 'Roger.
Let's get out of here.' "</TE>

<LD>Three of Ecuador's top military officials stepped down amid a
growing corruption scandal involving high-ranking officers.</LD>
<LD>   The armed forces, one of the country's most respected institutions,
suffered a blow last year when four officers were accused of using state
funds to take a European vacation.</LD>
<LD>   Defense Minister Hugo Unda said navy Adm. Fernando Donoso, air force
Gen. Osvaldo Dominguez and joint command chief Adm. Miguel Saona left
their posts in an effort to mitigate fallout from the scandal.</LD>
<TE>   The chiefs, whose terms were to expire in May, will be replaced in a
reshuffling of officers, with army Gen. Oscar Isch taking charge of the

<HD>U.S. Retools Kidnapping Response</HD>
<DH>Policy: Officials will review every case involving civilians
overseas and decide whether to take a role.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>After lengthy internal debate, the Bush administration Wednesday
adopted a more vigorous policy on Americans kidnapped overseas that calls
for the government to review every case to decide whether to take an
active role.</LD>
<LD>   In the past, the government has gotten involved in all kidnappings of
U.S. officials or troops but has sometimes declined to take any role in
cases involving private citizens.</LD>
<LD>   Now U.S. officials will consider whether to take actions ranging from
simply giving advice in dealing with the abductors to conducting
commando-style raids.</LD>
<TE>   "We'll use every appropriate resource to gain their safe return," said
Richard Boucher, the chief State Department spokesman. "It may be
pounding on a foreign ministry door; it may be working with law
enforcement authorities. But we're going to look and see what we can do
to get Americans who are being held out of detention."</TE>
<TE>   The government said it will continue to refuse to pay ransoms or make
other concessions to kidnappers, believing such actions would encourage
abductions.</TE>
<TE>   A formal statement of the amended policy says that "the U.S.
government will make every effort, including contact with representatives
of the captors, to obtain the release of hostages, without making
concessions to the hostage-takers."</TE>
<TE>   A "Hostage Subgroup" made up of federal officials will review each
case.</TE>
<TE>   The government will continue to discourage private companies from
paying ransoms to free American employees. But it will cooperate with
companies even if they decide to pay a ransom, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The review of the policy came at a time of rising concern about
hostage-taking, notably the unresolved kidnapping of Wall Street Journal
reporter Daniel Pearl. Pearl was kidnapped in Pakistan last month and,
despite a wide search, has not been found.</TE>
<TE>   The policy change will have no effect on the handling of that case,
Boucher said, though he added that "certainly Mr. Pearl's fate remains of
great concern to us."</TE>
<TE>   About two dozen Americans are reported kidnapped overseas each year.</TE>
<TE>   In the Philippines, the Abu Sayyaf group of militants is holding
American missionaries Gracia and Martin Burnham of Wichita, Kan., as well
as Philippine nurse Deborah Yap.</TE>
<TE>   Oreta Burnham, mother of Martin Burnham, told Associated Press that
she approved of the government's new policy.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it's a very good policy. We think it will help people in the
future," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Boucher sought to minimize the significance of the change, saying it
was "a restatement of pretty much the same policy." He described
differences among government agencies involved in drafting the policy as
minimal.</TE>
<TE>   But Pentagon officials were concerned that a more visible role by the
government could encourage kidnappings, one official said. He said the
Pentagon advised caution in ordering any military action.</TE>
<TE>   Boucher emphasized that military action is not always the preferred
solution and that many cases are best left to local authorities. But he
said a more visible role by the U.S. government could bring more
criminals to justice and deter future abductions.</TE>
<TE>   Kidnappers may be encouraged to "go on from one crime to another if
they keep getting away with it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Also motivating the change was concern for victims and a realization
that the cases "impact our foreign policy," Boucher said.</TE>
<TE>   The policy review was begun in the final days of the Clinton
administration. Officials from the White House, State Department,
Pentagon, CIA and FBI took part in the discussions.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, an oil consortium reportedly paid $13 million to free seven
foreign oil workers, including four Americans, in Ecuador. The
governments of Ecuador and Colombia later arrested 57 people alleged to
be the kidnappers and said they had also been responsible for several
previous abductions.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MECCA, Saudi Arabia
</DL>
<LD>Muslim pilgrims crowded into cars and buses and even clung to the
roofs of vehicles as they began an emotional journey Wednesday from the
holy city of Mecca to sacred Mt. Arafat.</LD>
<LD>   Chanting, "At thy service, my God, at thy service," the pilgrims
departed Mecca en masse, churning up a column of dust and smog. Traffic
jams stretched into the distance.</LD>
<LD>   Worshipers were to spend Wednesday night in the desert city of Mina,
which comes to life only during the hajj, or pilgrimage, before beginning
the short trek to Mt. Arafat after dawn today.</LD>
<TE>   This year, about 2 million Muslims are performing the pilgrimage. The
journey is one of the five pillars of Islam. Every able-bodied Muslim is
supposed to perform it at least once in a lifetime if he or she can
afford it.</TE>
<TE>   This year's hajj takes place at a time when many of the world's 1.2
billion Muslims believe that their faith, established 14 centuries ago,
is under assault from the West after the Sept. 11 attacks on the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi-born exile Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda terrorist network
are blamed for the attacks, which killed thousands. The attacks sparked
the U.S.-led military campaign in Afghanistan after the now-ousted
Taliban militia refused to surrender Bin Laden for trial.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen Saudis were among the 19 suspected hijackers who flew jets
into New York's World Trade Center and the Pentagon. A fourth plane
crashed into a Pennsylvania field.</TE>
<TE>   "A few crazy men give all of us Muslims such a bad name. It will take
years for everyone to forget Sept. 11 and the identities of the
perpetrators," said Hasan Ahmed, 49, a bank employee from Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   Because of post-Sept. 11 tensions and the war in Afghanistan, Saudi
authorities have taken stringent security measures in Mecca, a city of
500,000 that is closed to non-Muslims. More than 80,000 volunteers,
police and soldiers have been deployed.</TE>
<TE>   The hajj peaks today with prayers at Mt. Arafat, a gentle hill 12
miles southwest of Mecca.</TE>

<HD>Is Bush Retreating From His 'Axis of Evil' Remark?</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Many in South Korea wonder if president's call for
dialogue with North is sincere or just a polite gesture to his hosts.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>SEOUL
</DL>
<LD>Did President Bush back down?</LD>
<LD>   After three weeks of threatening talk about the "axis of evil," the
president was surprisingly tame, even mild-mannered, when he peered
through bulletproof glass Wednesday across the demilitarized zone that
separates North and South Korea. He offered dialogue, not confrontation.
He talked of gestures of goodwill, not guns.</LD>
<LD>   "We have no intention of invading North Korea. We would be happy to
have a dialogue with the North Koreans," he said at a news conference in
Seoul with South Korean President Kim Dae Jung. "I wonder out loud why
the North Korean president won't accept the offer."</LD>
<TE>   Later, at the DMZ, he added, "We're prepared to talk with the North
about steps that would lead to a better future that is more hopeful and
less threatening."</TE>
<TE>   Or were Bush's clearly deliberate comments a one-day wonder? In their
first meeting a year ago, Kim was publicly embarrassed when Bush appeared
to distance himself from, even repudiate, the Nobel Peace Prize winner's
"sunshine policy" of rapprochement with the North. Were this week's
comments just a polite gesture to his South Korean host?</TE>
<TE>   That's the big question being widely pondered in the aftermath of
Bush's visit to the divided peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   The president's words initially eased some of the tension that has
flared here since his State of the Union address put North Korea in an
"axis of evil" with Iraq and Iran.</TE>
<TE>   "I was relieved that his tone was not that harsh. I experienced war,
and I don't want to experience another one, as it will destroy all that
we have built," said Lee Myong Shik, a 65-year-old retired businessman.
"I don't approve of [North Korean leader] Kim Jong Il, but war should be
avoided by all means."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's emphasis on the suffering of North Koreans also played well in
the South, which increasingly views its destitute neighbor with pity
rather than fear.</TE>
<TE>   Yet many South Koreans were also skeptical that Bush's comments mean
the danger of some kind of showdown or action has been avoided. The
United States has demanded that North Korea dismantle its programs for
weapons of mass destruction, pull back troops from the DMZ and end
political repression.</TE>
<TE>   "There was emphasis on dialogue, but we will see if he means what he
says," said Park Tae Woo, a 20-year-old liberal arts major who joined at
least 4,000 student activists and union members at a march through
downtown Seoul on Wednesday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "No Bush! No War!" they chanted, marching behind a sound truck
plastered with a poster of the Statue of Liberty superimposed with Bush's
face and the words "USA, Empire of evil. Bush, god of war."</TE>
<TE>   The protest was the biggest in a growing wave of anti-American
demonstrations in recent days. The march along a one-mile route from
Jungmyo Park to Myongdong Cathedral started peacefully. But a clash broke
out when riot police tried to stop the protesters from burning a U.S.
flag. Several demonstrators were injured.</TE>
<TE>   Many South Koreans also questioned whether Bush's statements--at the
news conference with Kim, in remarks to U.S. troops at the DMZ and in an
official toast at a state dinner--can undo the damage of last month's
remarks.</TE>
<TE>   "We've often seen that what America says and does are different," said
Song Young Hoon, a 38-year-old security company worker. "America has
little to lose if a war breaks out here, but we will lose everything."</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials insist that Washington can threaten the
North at the same time it calls for dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that you can have a policy that speaks the truth clearly
about the North Korean regime and yet leaves open the possibility of
dialogue," National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice told reporters on
the eve of Bush's six-day Asia tour that ends in China.</TE>
<TE>   But South Korean analysts don't buy the comparison that Bush made
between his position and that of President Reagan, who in 1983 labeled
the Soviet Union an "evil empire" but also managed to hold talks with
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes a choice of words can change the tide of political
developments, but it won't in this case," said Lee Jong Seok, an expert
here on North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Experts also doubt that Kim Jong Il will accept Bush's invitation to
talks because the United States wants too much--and offers limited
incentives for his Communist leadership to cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's comments may actually have the opposite effect, some analysts
here warn. The president put the North Korean leader in a box by not
offering a way to return to negotiations without appearing to give in.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts note, for example, that Bush apparently rejected Kim Dae
Jung's request for a special envoy to deal with North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't answer the question about a special envoy, didn't offer a
way [for Kim Jong Il] to save face," said Paik Hak Soon, a scholar on
Korean politics. "North Korea may think that the United States doesn't
have any real intention to enter into dialogue."</TE>
<TE>   For now, Bush has left more questions than answers--the most basic
being, what are his real intentions?</TE>

<HD>For China, Ties With U.S. Stir Mix of Hope and Worry</HD>
<DH>Asia: Many distrust the post-Sept. 11 actions of Washington.
Beijing wants the summit to set a positive tone.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIJING
</DL>
<LD>The Chinese are a people fond of numbers and wordplay. So the
chattering classes here appreciated both the style and substance of
Washington's new approach to their country, the "Three Cs" outlined
recently by U.S. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell: candor, cooperation
and constructive relations.</LD>
<LD>   It's a formula Beijing is eager to put to the test during President
Bush's two-day visit starting today, the first by an American president
to the Chinese capital in four years.</LD>
<LD>   But beneath the smiles and handshakes awaiting Bush lies a fourth C
that many Chinese would add to the list: consternation.</LD>
<TE>   Even as bilateral ties improve on the surface amid the war on
terrorism, a powerful undercurrent of opinion is swirling in China that
reflects rising concern over U.S. actions and policies post-Sept. 11,
which many see as boosting the United States' already worrisome
ascendancy on the world stage.</TE>
<TE>   In the immediate aftermath of the attacks on New York and the
Pentagon, Sino-U.S. relations improved quickly with Beijing's support of
Washington's plans for retaliation. The two sides could barely stand to
speak after an imbroglio over a U.S. spy plane that made an emergency
landing in China in April, but they suddenly found themselves sharing
intelligence and working together to help stabilize Pakistan. Bush
traveled briefly to Shanghai for a conference in October and has spoken
with Chinese President Jiang Zemin by telephone monthly since then.</TE>
<TE>   There was some relief here that the U.S. had found a new enemy and
that China was not it.</TE>
<TE>   There was also hope that the U.S. had learned that it could not go it
alone and would have to stop being so highhanded and
"hegemonic"--Beijing's favorite dig at Washington.</TE>
<TE>   That hope has now evaporated among many Chinese analysts and
officials, who see a U.S. even more potent, strident and implacable than
before, a superpower able to get its way in more places around the globe,
including in China's backyard.</TE>
<TE>   These experts worry that the world's most populous nation is simply
being dragged along by the U.S. juggernaut and is unable to do anything
about it.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the prevailing view in China . . . that the U.S. has, since
Sept. 11, strengthened its international status," said Shen Dingli, an
expert on international relations in Shanghai.</TE>
<TE>   "After adjusting its way of handling international affairs a bit, [the
U.S.] is returning to unilateralism," said Shen, although he added that
he does not fully share the prevailing view.</TE>
<TE>   From its treatment of Afghan prisoners to Bush's labeling of Iran,
Iraq and North Korea--a close Chinese ally--as an "axis of evil," the
U.S. is bent on doing whatever it wants, against whomever it wants, under
the convenient cover of combating terror, detractors here say.</TE>
<TE>   "Under the banner of counter-terrorism, it can strike at will at those
with differing views; it can loiter about and not leave Afghanistan or
other strategically important areas; it can undercut the United Nations;
it can use opposing terrorism as a bargaining chip in bilateral relations
with other countries," scholar Zhang Guoqing wrote in Southern Weekend,
one of the nation's most widely read newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   Critics warn that this strategy includes hemming China in with an
increased U.S. military presence in Central Asia, in nations such as
Uzbekistan, and in Southeast Asia, in places like the Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. military superiority, which stunned Chinese analysts during the
Persian Gulf War, proved itself again in Afghanistan. With an overall
military budget of $331 billion--nearly 20 times China's stated defense
budget--the U.S. is virtually unstoppable, said Yan Xuetong, an analyst
at Qinghua University in Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   "The gap between the U.S. and other military powers is not just in
quantity but also in quality. And this gap will make the U.S. become more
and more unilateralist and care less and less about other countries'
interests," Yan said.</TE>
<TE>   Such sentiments, though common in private conversation, have mostly
been kept out of China's state-controlled media. Blunt criticism of U.S.
policies, usually a staple of Chinese Internet chat rooms, has been
carefully expunged in recent weeks by government censors.</TE>
<TE>   That is because Chinese leaders, despite the rumbles of warning from
below, remain keen on ensuring that this week's summit in Beijing is a
success. They hope it will set the tone for Sino-U.S. relations in the
21st century.</TE>
<TE>   Scholars see broad but not unanimous agreement at the top of the
Communist hierarchy that China needs the U.S. in order to develop
economically and technologically, to evolve into the strong regional
power it desperately wants to be. Jiang, who is set to step down as
president next year, is known to favor warmer ties with Washington and
wants to make better relations a legacy of his rule.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the Beijing leadership has betrayed little to no alarm over
the U.S. since Sept. 11, except to stress the need for collaboration and
to advise caution in expanding the war on terrorism beyond Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Neither have there been any official protests of U.S. military
involvement in Central and Southeast Asia, a break from the suspicion and
rancor that usually mark Chinese reactions to such maneuvers.</TE>
<TE>   But popular distrust of the U.S. and resentment of its power, fed by a
rising nationalism, run deep, which could prove a problem for Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   "There is increasing tension between the official line and the views
of ordinary Chinese," said Zhu Feng, who teaches at Beijing University.
"If they can't work out a successful way to legitimize or justify what
their policy is or why it was adopted, it will cause much complaint and
more criticism."</TE>
<TE>   Shen, of Shanghai's Fudan University, said the government could
package its policy differently, to emphasize that the war on terrorism is
an international, not just American, campaign and that China could
"co-lead" the effort, rather than be co-opted by it.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Beijing could cast its support of the anti-terror
campaign as morally correct, not merely politically expedient. That way,
"we will not see ourselves as coerced by the U.S. and lose our image as a
major power," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Shen said the anti-terrorism effort could benefit China in its own
crackdown on separatists in the restive Xinjiang region. Beijing recently
denounced the rebels as terrorists linked to Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   Bush is certain to discuss the war on terrorism with Jiang. He is also
expected to take the Chinese leader to task on religious freedom and arms
proliferation. Getting the Chinese to curtail the export of
weapons-making material is a U.S. priority, though the summit is unlikely
to result in an accord.</TE>
<TE>   As for human rights, Beijing has released at least one political
prisoner in recent weeks--common practice here in advance of a U.S.
presidential visit--and there is talk that a few more may be let go after
Bush leaves.</TE>
<TE>   But Jiang is likely to complain about U.S. support of Taiwan, the
island Beijing considers its territory.</TE>
<TE>   In spite of the disagreements, the talks are sure to be cordial--an
improvement from a year ago, when Bush referred to China as a "strategic
competitor," a major downgrading from the "strategic partner" former
President Clinton envisioned.</TE>
<TE>   Few people here, even the optimists, expect any breakthrough in this
week's meetings, instead viewing them as an opportunity to build trust
and find more solid footing for bilateral ties.</TE>
<TE>   "Most Chinese do not expect that this summit can reach a very
substantial conclusion," said Yan of Qinghua University. "Bush is coming
not to improve the relationship but . . . to prevent the current
cooperation from deteriorating."</TE>

<HD>Israel Vows New Offensive; Tanks Enter Gaza City</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Sharon orders army to widen assault on Arafat's
government. Series of attacks leaves 17 Palestinians dead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KALANDIYEH, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>Israel announced Wednesday that it was widening its war on the
Palestinian Authority of Yasser Arafat, and then bombarded his
headquarters for the second time in less than 24 hours, launched a
four-pronged assault on the Gaza Strip and sent tanks into Gaza City--a
first.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli tanks roared into the Gaza Strip early today from the south,
east and north, while naval gunboats firing heavy machine guns pummeled
Palestinian targets in the west. Heavy gun battles were reported around
Gaza City and in the southern town of Rafah. At least five Palestinians
were killed. There were no Israeli casualties, the army said in a
statement.</LD>
<LD>   As armor and infantry moved into Gaza City, calls went out on
loudspeakers at local mosques urging Palestinians to rise to the defense
of their land. Israeli forces blew up the broadcasting center of the
Voice of Palestine radio and television in Gaza City, the army confirmed.</LD>
<TE>   The latest offensive follows the Palestinian attack of an Israeli army
checkpoint in the West Bank on Tuesday night in which six Israeli
soldiers were killed. Palestinian militia members loyal to Arafat claimed
responsibility for the attack and vowed to step up their assaults on
Israeli troops, Jewish settlers and the roadblocks.</TE>
<TE>   By all accounts, the hostilities that have rocked this region for
nearly 17 months were escalating to yet another dangerous, bloody level.
Seventeen Palestinians were killed Wednesday, most of them policemen; 17
Israelis and 47 Palestinians have been killed in the last week.</TE>
<TE>   After dark Wednesday, Israel's U.S.-supplied F-16 warplanes and Apache
helicopter gunships pounded targets in three Palestinian towns. Missiles
hit Arafat's Gaza City compound, flattened a three-story police
headquarters in the Gazan town of Rafah and destroyed a police station in
the West Bank town of Jenin. Early today, Israeli missiles for the second
time in less than 24 hours hit Arafat's Ramallah headquarters, this time
destroying a guest house adjacent to the building where Arafat was
staying. He was not hurt.</TE>
<TE>   Troops and at least a dozen tanks and armored personnel carriers moved
into Gaza City's eastern Shijaya neighborhood, security officials and the
Israeli army said. Israel has staged numerous incursions into the Gaza
Strip but had not entered Gaza City, the principal headquarters of the
Palestinian Authority.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian police raced to the city's edge early today to confront
the armor. Tanks pushed deeper into the city toward a sprawling
beachfront refugee camp but eventually withdrew from Gaza City around
dawn.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, in urgent consultation with his
Cabinet, ordered the army Wednesday afternoon to increase the frequency
and intensity of its raids and airstrikes on Palestinian targets,
embarking on what Israeli officials called a "new course of action."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's spokesman, Raanan Gissin, said the government would also
consider cutting off all access to Arafat. Arafat has been under virtual
house arrest in his offices in the West Bank town of Ramallah since
Israeli tanks flanked the compound in early December. But international
diplomats, solidarity delegations and journalists have continued to visit
him--at least until now.</TE>
<TE>   In Ramallah, Arafat emerged defiantly from his offices. "No one can
scare the Palestinian people," he told reporters, vowing he will yet see
the Palestinian flag "raised on the walls of Jerusalem."</TE>
<TE>   In an earlier raid Wednesday, the Israeli army fired a missile into
the compound not far from where Arafat was working.</TE>
<TE>   It and the shelling early today were the closest Israel has come to
actually harming Arafat, although Sharon insists that is not his goal.</TE>
<TE>   Marwan Barghouti, a top militia commander and one of Arafat's key
lieutenants, said Palestinian gunmen will step up their attacks on
Israeli soldiers at roadblocks in the West Bank and Gaza, part of what he
called a "new phase of Palestinian resistance."</TE>
<TE>   Amid much internal debate, Palestinian gunmen in recent weeks have
been shifting their operations back to attacks on Jewish settlers and
soldiers. Many Palestinians realize that they lost enormous international
support when militant groups resorted to suicide bombings that targeted
civilians in Israel, and they believe that soldiers and settlers will be
seen as more legitimate targets--a distinction Israel does not make.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the aerial assaults Wednesday, Israel imposed an
extraordinarily strict closure by banning Palestinian travel among five
West Bank cities. Although Israeli government officials insist that they
distinguish between ordinary Palestinian civilians and the gunmen who
attack Israelis, the closure in effect trapped tens of thousands of
Palestinians in besieged towns on the eve of an important Muslim holiday.</TE>
<TE>   At Kalandiyeh, the main checkpoint on the road between Jerusalem and
Ramallah, Israeli soldiers were clearly tense Wednesday. They crouched
behind barriers and fired warning shots at anyone who approached,
including a Swiss aid worker in a car with diplomatic license plates.</TE>
<TE>   About a block away, hundreds of Palestinians were stranded as they
tried to reenter Ramallah, or as they got out of Ramallah over circuitous
routes through a rock quarry and muddy hills but couldn't continue on
their way because of the restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   Most clutched bags and were headed to family homes in other towns for
this weekend's Eid al-Adha feast, which marks the end of the annual hajj,
or pilgrimage. It didn't look like many would make it.</TE>
<TE>   Fadel Zeidan, a 46-year-old banker dressed in a suit and tie, walked
half a mile to get out of Ramallah but was stuck on a crowded roadside
doubting that he would reach the village near Jenin where his family
lives. Unless his luck improved, he said, it would be the first Eid
al-Adha feast not spent with his wife and six children. He choked back
tears at the thought.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the most important day of the year to be with the family," he
said. Like many Palestinians, Zeidan celebrates with gifts for the
children, a huge meal of mutton (sacrificed for the occasion) and visits
with relatives.</TE>
<TE>   Eight-year-old Ghassan Ali was trying to get back to Ramallah after
the closure caught him at school in another town on the outskirts of
Jerusalem. "I want to go home," he said, standing near the checkpoint as
a woman begged a soldier to relent. "But the soldier told me to go back."</TE>
<TE>   In the West Bank city of Nablus, where nine Palestinian police
officers and militants were killed Wednesday morning and a 10th died
later in the day, the situation remained especially tense, residents
said. Israeli soldiers seized several apartment buildings on the edge of
Nablus' Balata refugee camp, one of the most hard-line bastions of
Palestinian militancy. Israeli snipers took up positions, and bulldozers
were seen moving into the area after nightfall.</TE>
<TE>   Eight of the policemen killed in Nablus and Ramallah by Israeli troops
belonged to the National Security force, the Palestinian police service
that is widely regarded as the most professional. Its members until now
had largely stayed out of the conflict that has raged since September
2000, and it had not been accused by Israeli officials of the kinds of
attacks attributed to other police agencies.</TE>
<TE>   It remains to be seen whether the National Security force, having lost
eight of its men, will join in the attacks now--a step that would further
escalate the fight.</TE>
<TE>   Among Israelis, meanwhile, the deaths of so many soldiers in such a
short period was a devastating blow. The attack on the soldiers has
forced Israel to reevaluate many of its military tactics while cranking
up right-wing pressure on Sharon to destroy Arafat's regime.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon emerged from a special Cabinet meeting and announced a
"different" military campaign but did not offer details. Israeli security
officials said the army will employ the same actions already in
use--incursions into Palestinian towns and cities, assassinations and
arrests--but on a much larger scale.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, aides to Sharon said, the army will have to adapt
its operations to the guerrilla-style tactics employed with increasing
efficacy by Palestinian fighters. Israeli troops will be deployed in
greater numbers throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip and will more
frequently go on the offensive rather than waiting to retaliate, the
aides said.</TE>
<TE>   The army fortified roadblocks Wednesday but will probably replace many
with mobile units. Top army commanders, and now several politicians, say
the establishment of stationary, vulnerable checkpoints will have to be
rethought.</TE>

</DL>
<LD>Judaism's Reform and Conservative movements won a landmark legal
victory Wednesday, as the Supreme Court ruled that the government must
register as Jews Israeli citizens converted here by non-Orthodox rabbis.</LD>
<LD>   Reform and Conservative Jews hailed the decision, handed down by an
extended panel of 11 justices. Orthodox rabbis bitterly denounced it.
Both sides agreed that the ruling would shape the destiny of the Jewish
people.</LD>
<LD>   "This is huge," said Rabbi Ammiel Hirsch, a Jerusalem spokesman for
North American Reform Jewry. "Now, finally, Israeli citizens living in
Israel who have undergone Reform conversions will enjoy the same rights
and standing as all other Israeli Jews."</LD>
<TE>   But Zevulun Orlev, a parliament member from the National Religious
Party, likened the court's decision to "a terrorist attack on the
[Jewish] people's unity." The court, Orlev said, "won big-time today. The
Jewish people lost big-time."</TE>
<TE>   Seven years ago, the high court ruled that Orthodox Judaism could not
monopolize conversions in Israel. It said non-Orthodox converts who enter
Israel under the Law of Return may be registered by the state as Jews.
But successive governments ignored the court's decision, refusing to
register as a Jew anyone converted by a Reform or Conservative rabbi.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's ruling ordered the state to begin registering non-Orthodox
converts and included those converted in Israel. But it did not resolve
the larger issue of who is a Jew, which has been debated here for years.</TE>
<TE>   It also left intact the Orthodox rabbinate's power to decide who is
Jewish for purposes of marriage. Although non-Orthodox converts will now
be listed as Jews on their national identity cards, those who wish to be
married in Israel will still have to prove that they are Jewish according
to Halakha, or Jewish law.</TE>
<TE>   The Reform and Conservative movements, strong in the United States,
have battled the Orthodox establishment here for years, often by filing
lawsuits seeking recognition of their status as legitimate streams of
Judaism.</TE>
<TE>   The conversion issue took on new urgency after hundreds of thousands
of Russian Jews--many of them not considered Jewish because they had
non-Orthodox conversions--immigrated here. They will now have the option
of registering here as Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Natan Sharansky, leader of the Russian party Israel With Immigration,
blamed the ultra-Orthodox for failing to work out a compromise that would
have made it unnecessary for the court to rule.</TE>
<TE>   "We must all think together of practical solutions for matters of
religion and state, in order to avoid a situation in which, very soon,
crucial issues will be determined by the high court and result in
dividing the Jewish people at such a difficult time," Sharansky said in a
statement.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a real breakthrough for religious pluralism in Israel," said
Nicole Maor, the attorney who represented the Religious Action Center,
one of the organizations that petitioned the court to compel registration
of non-Orthodox converts. The decision, Maor said, "is symbolic but also
more than symbolic, because in Israel your identity is determined by your
identity card."</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers from several ultra-Orthodox and Orthodox religious parties
said they would seek to introduce legislation soon that would restore to
the Orthodox rabbinate exclusive authority over conversions.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is a very grave decision, harboring disaster for the
Jewish people," said Eli Yishai, leader of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party,
the third-largest party in Israel's parliament. "We must reach a decision
as to whether we want to protect and preserve the Jewish people in the
Jewish state or deteriorate into the same assimilation that is plaguing
world Jewry."</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Rosenblum, director of Am Echad (One People), an
ultra-Orthodox group in Jerusalem that seeks to explain the community's
views to the outside world, said the decision will eventually render the
meaning of Jewish identity in Israel meaningless.</TE>
<TE>   "The name Jew has been significantly devalued," Rosenblum said. "Now,
some rabbi who officiates at a wedding with a Baptist minister to marry a
Jew and a Baptist will be able to determine who is a Jew."</TE>

<HD>Ridge Sees Nevada Site as Fit for Anti-Terrorism Center</HD>
<DH>Training: Homeland security chief withholds an endorsement during
his tour, but he touts the test facility's versatility.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MERCURY, Nev.
</DL>
<LD>Homeland Security Director Thomas J. Ridge toured the Nevada Test
Site on Wednesday and proclaimed afterward that it provides a "sterling"
facility to train the nation's anti-terrorism forces.</LD>
<LD>   "It's one thing to hear about it and to read about it, and it's
another thing to see it," Ridge told Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) after
viewing a mock exercise in which SWAT teams and others overwhelmed
"terrorists" attempting to take over a nuclear laboratory for its fuel
rods.</LD>
<LD>   Reid and Gov. Kenny Guinn had invited Ridge to visit the site, hoping
that the White House would declare it the "National Center for
Counter-Terrorism" because of its size and accommodations to train
emergency crews to deal with radiological, biological, chemical and other
weapons of mass destruction.</LD>
<TE>   Ridge stopped short of endorsing that notion, noting that other
government facilities also train personnel to fight terrorists here and
abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Ridge said, "I give a sterling endorsement of the
facility, and I'll work with Congress, the secretary of Energy and the
Department of Defense to integrate what we can here."</TE>
<TE>   The idea of establishing a single anti-terrorism training facility "is
a very intriguing option to create," Ridge said. "I'm impressed with this
facility. This is the only one with so many dimensions."</TE>
<TE>   The Nevada Test Site, where 928 nuclear detonations occurred from 1951
through 1992, has in recent years been used by the Justice Department and
other agencies to train first responders--firefighters, paramedics, bomb
squad members, hazardous material experts and others--who would arrive at
a scene involving exposure to wide-scale lethal weapons.</TE>
<TE>   They practice in full gear, fire off explosions and release low levels
of radioactive material to add real-life stress to the training
exercises.</TE>
<TE>   Funding for the site has increased markedly since the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks--an initial $7.5 million immediately after the attacks,
an additional $10 million later and, in President Bush's current budget,
$10 million more.</TE>
<TE>   The facility, operated by the National Nuclear Security
Administration, trains about 3,000 personnel a year and hopes, with
increased funding, to train 16,000 people next year.</TE>
<TE>   "There'd be some extra jobs [for Nevadans], but it's not so much that
Nevada would benefit by this as the nation benefiting by making this
nation a more secure place," Reid said.</TE>
<TE>   Reid, the Senate's majority whip, said he didn't expect to win an
immediate commitment from Ridge after Wednesday's visit. "But he said you
have to come here to appreciate it, and now he has," Reid said.</TE>
<TE>   Selling the Nevada Test Site to the White House as an anti-terrorism
center comes at the same time Nevada is fighting the selection of Yucca
Mountain, 50 miles to the west, as the burial ground for highly
radioactive nuclear waste. Bush last week gave the go-ahead for the
Department of Energy to pursue development of Yucca Mountain.</TE>
<TE>   Ridge had been set to visit the test site late last year, and the fact
that his tour was delayed until now removes any appearances Nevada
officials would be willing to give up Yucca Mountain in exchange for
developing the anti-terrorism center.</TE>
<TE>   "They've already made their decision on Yucca Mountain, and they know
I will veto that," said Guinn, referring to his authority to block the
development of Yucca Mountain as a nuclear waste dump.</TE>
<TE>   Guinn has two months to issue his formal objection, after which both
houses of Congress have about 90 days to override his veto.</TE>
<TE>   Ridge refused to discuss Yucca Mountain on Wednesday, but he told
reporters that the protection of expended nuclear fuel "does have
homeland security implications."</TE>

<HD>Lieberman Rips Bush on Environment</HD>
<DH>Politics: The Democratic senator, in a California visit, criticizes
the president's policies on Alaska oil drilling and clean air.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO
</DL>
<LD>On a campaign-style swing through California, Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman (D-Conn.) on Wednesday denounced President Bush's environmental
record and pledged new legislative efforts to block the administration's
proposals on global warming and energy production.</LD>
<LD>   "While President Bush has provided strong and principled leadership in
the war against terrorism, I think he's been AWOL in the war against
environmental pollution," Lieberman told the California League of
Conservation Voters in a lunchtime address here.</LD>
<LD>   The speech was one of the most stinging Democratic assaults on any
aspect of Bush's domestic record since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11,
which pushed such disagreements to the sidelines.</LD>
<TE>   Lieberman's talk was spiked with barbed language, and he repeatedly
charged that Bush is pursuing a backward-looking agenda on a series of
environmental issues.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman visited California as part of a four-state, four-day Western
swing; he also will stop in Colorado, Washington and Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   Officially, he is traveling to campaign for other Democratic House and
Senate candidates and to raise funds for a new political action committee
he has established. But Lieberman, Al Gore's running mate in 2000,
acknowledged that he is "thinking about" a bid for the top spot on his
party's presidential ticket in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman arrived in California just days after Sens. Tom Daschle of
South Dakota, John Edwards of North Carolina and John F. Kerry of
Massachusetts--three other potential contenders for the Democratic
presidential nod--addressed the party's state convention in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Gore also has heightened his public profile of late, keeping alive
prospects that he will again seek the White House. Lieberman has said he
will not run if Gore does.</TE>
<TE>Jockeying to Attract Environmentalists</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists are an important constituency in some Democratic
presidential primaries, among them California.</TE>
<TE>   Kerry has already been courting them aggressively, promising to
filibuster any effort to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil
drilling in the energy legislation the Senate is due to consider next
week.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Lieberman said he also would filibuster the
administration's push to drill in the refuge, adding that he would do so
"until the caribou come home . . . or Vice President [Dick] Cheney
releases the energy task force records, whichever comes later."</TE>
<TE>   Congress' investigative arm, the General Accounting Office, has
threatened to sue to obtain the records of the task force, which Cheney
presided over as the administration formulated its energy initiatives.</TE>
<TE>   In his speech, Lieberman announced that the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee, which he chairs, will convene hearings next month on
the administration's environmental record.</TE>
<TE>   "In its first year, the Bush administration has undercut environmental
protections and undermined . . . [a] growing spirit of environmental
innovation and collaboration," he charged.</TE>
<TE>'Breathing the Air Isn't Optional'</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman focused most of his rhetorical fire on two aspects of the
administration's environmental agenda: the proposal Bush recently
announced to reduce emission of greenhouse gases, and the
production-oriented energy plan that has cleared the House but faces
substantial Democratic resistance in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman derided as "feeble" Bush's call for voluntary reductions in
carbon dioxide, which has been linked to global warming. "Breathing the
air isn't optional, and therefore reducing the greenhouse gases in it
shouldn't be either," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Bush dismissed Lieberman's comments as "election year
rhetoric."</TE>
<TE>   "Economic growth and environmental protection can go hand in hand,"
said the spokesman, Scott McClellan. "That's why [Bush] has outlined an
innovative approach to protect the public health, clean our skies and
promote environmentally responsible growth."</TE>
<TE>   McClellan contended that the "clear skies" proposal Bush unveiled last
week would lead to the "most significant reduction in power plant
emissions ever."</TE>
<TE>   Of Lieberman's plan to launch a committee inquiry into the
administration's environmental policy, McClellan said: "That's his
prerogative."</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman said he was preparing an alternative environmental plan with
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), lately a frequent collaborator with
Democrats. Their legislative proposal would require mandatory carbon
dioxide reductions but would allow firms that exceed the targets to trade
"credits" with firms that don't meet the goals.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has used a similar system to reduce pollution
associated with acid rain, and Lieberman argued that the approach would
encourage firms to find innovative solutions by allowing them to profit
from controlling their greenhouse gas emissions.</TE>
<TE>   On energy, Lieberman echoed the common Democratic argument that Bush's
plan was weighted too heavily toward new oil production and slighted both
conservation and the development of renewable energy sources.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman's environmental credentials were reinforced Wednesday when
the League of Conservation Voters ranked him as one of 15 senators--all
Democrats--with a 100% score on votes of interest to the group last year.</TE>

<HD>Rangers Bring All-Terrain Security to Utah Olympics</HD>
<DH>Games: Patrolling the mountains on skis, Park Service agents are
among the 10,000 personnel on watch.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah
</DL>
<LD>How do you defend an entire mountain range?</LD>
<LD>   With venues spread over a 6,000-square-mile area and events conducted
on 10,000-foot peaks, guarding the Winter Games has been a monumental
challenge.</LD>
<LD>   Security officials here solved that puzzle by reaching deep into the
government's storehouse of resources and culled experts from 13 federal
agencies. Among the 10,000 security personnel are National Park Service
rangers patrolling the rugged mountains on skis and Bureau of Land
Management agents cruising the back country on snowmobiles.</LD>
<TE>   The Park Service rangers include four from Yosemite National Park,
skiing Park City's massive mountain in their yellow and black parkas with
"police" printed on the back in reflective letters.</TE>
<TE>   "We are prepared to go out on all terrains, in all conditions, at all
hours," said Maura Longden, a district ranger at Yosemite, describing her
Olympic job responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   "We are all here because we are comfortable in this environment; this
is the office we work in every day," Longden said, gesturing at the
imposing peaks and rocky escarpments towering above her.</TE>
<TE>   "We rely on our skills and experience in these conditions. We know how
to conduct ourselves, how to stay safe and how to handle the extremes in
weather.</TE>
<TE>   "Since we are mobile, we can get from Point A to Point B faster than
anybody."</TE>
<TE>   The rangers' experience working in the snow allows them to scan a
white-faced mountain and see objects or people others might not.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of where we work, we understand snow," ranger Nate Inouye
said. "There are thousands of kinds of snow that we are able to look at
and tell its tensile strength, if it's packed or safe. Somebody working
in an urban environment, sitting behind a desk, just wouldn't be able to
do what we do."</TE>
<TE>   Longden, Inouye, Greg Lawler and Dave Hajdik are experts in
cross-country and alpine skiing, search and rescue, first aid and
wilderness survival. Longden, for example, is one of two Yosemite rangers
who winter in the park's back country, fending for themselves for seven
snowbound months a year.</TE>
<TE>   The Secret Service, which is coordinating Olympic security, would not
allow the rangers to speak specifically about their duties, but they have
security and safety chores at the snowboarding and alpine venues.</TE>
<TE>   All four are certified as federal law enforcement officers, and they
carry weapons during their shifts. Security is round-the-clock.</TE>
<TE>   "Our shift begins with a briefing in which we all share information,"
Longden said. On any given day they might be called upon to search the
mountain for places where people or devices might be hidden, test for
avalanche dangers or assess the best trails for other security personnel
to take.</TE>
<TE>   Longden said they arrived before the Games and trained on the mountain
to familiarize themselves with the setting.</TE>
<TE>   When on patrol they carry heavily laden backpacks with extra layers of
warm clothing, gallons of water and food, avalanche safety equipment and
global positioning systems. Sometimes the rangers are on cross-country
skis and other times they are on downhill skis, depending on their
assignment.</TE>
<TE>   "We carry enough equipment to be out well beyond our shift," Lawler
said, guessing they heft 25 or 30 pounds on their backs.</TE>
<TE>   This marks the first time the Games' security has been under the
jurisdiction of the Secret Service. A massive force of local, state and
federal security workers are here, in addition to military and National
Guard personnel.</TE>
<TE>   "Without all of us working together, we couldn't have accomplished
this," said David Tubbs, director of the Utah Olympic Public Safety
Command. "The fact that we have all these people with specialized
skills--skiing and snowshoeing, in some cases--that sets this apart. We
have made certain that people were placed in a position where they could
do us some good."</TE>
<TE>   The rangers, handpicked for this assignment, say they have been
surprised by the reactions of spectators.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so pleased that people come up to us and thank us for being
here," Lawler said. "They see our Park Service patch and ask what we're
doing. It's really an honor to be here. Plus, any day spent on skis is a
good day."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A government panel decided to encourage flu shots for children ages
6 months to 23 months--a group not previously on the recommended list for
the vaccine.</LD>
<LD>   The government currently recommends the vaccine only for the elderly,
the chronically ill and pregnant women, although it is available to
others who want it.</LD>
<LD>   But the immunization panel of the Centers for Disease Control and

<HD>Justices Weigh Vouchers for Parochial School Use</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court took up the question Wednesday of state vouchers
that pay for children to attend church-related schools--not to decide
whether this is good education policy but to rule on whether this use of
tax money violates the Constitution's ban on "an establishment of
religion."</LD>
<LD>   At least five justices--including, notably, Sandra Day
O'Connor--sounded during the argument as though they were leaning toward
the pro-voucher side.</LD>
<LD>   A sixth, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, commented that the Catholic
schools in Cleveland appeared to offer a higher quality of education than
the public schools. Were he a parent there, Breyer said, he might send
his children to those schools, even though he is Jewish.</LD>
<TE>   A ruling upholding vouchers could prove to be a landmark both in
education policy and in church-state law.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the "school choice" movement believe that a victory in the
Supreme Court will encourage other states to experiment with broader
statewide subsidies for private and parochial schools. And the high
court's endorsement of public aid for church schools could clear away the
legal doubts about President Bush's "faith-based initiative." The
president seeks to direct more public money toward religious charities.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the court building, crowds much larger than normal stretched
down the block. The session Wednesday was unusual in that two major
issues were being considered--the voucher case and a case involving the
execution of mentally retarded inmates--and passionate advocates on both
sides waited to hear the arguments.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1995, Ohio has offered Cleveland parents vouchers, or
scholarships, of $2,500 per child per year if they choose to send their
children to private or parochial schools.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters say this program gives disadvantaged children a chance to
escape Cleveland's failing public schools. Critics say it mostly
subsidizes parents who were already sending their children to parochial
schools. Nearly 4,000 students are receiving state vouchers in Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   In reality, the Cleveland program has offered parents fewer choices
than its backers had envisioned. The suburban schools refused to open
their doors to transfers from the city, and exclusive private schools
were not interested in taking on students who could pay only $2,500.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, nearly all the Cleveland students who take advantage of
the state voucher--99% in the most recent tally--go to religious schools.</TE>
<TE>   As Wednesday's argument got underway, it was unclear how the justices
would view the Cleveland program--through its hopes or its reality.</TE>
<TE>   A federal appeals court, looking at the reality, had declared the
program unconstitutional because it had "the impermissible effect" of
promoting religion.</TE>
<TE>   But from the opening moments of Wednesday's argument, O'Connor seized
on the fact that Cleveland's parents can choose from an array of public
schools. Rather than being restricted to the public school closest to
their home, parents can choose from magnet schools and independently run
charter schools.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a whole range of options available," O'Connor said. "Why
should we not look at all the options open to the parents?" she asked a
lawyer for the National Education Assn., the teachers' union that has led
the legal attack on vouchers.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers and public school officials say voucher programs drain money
from cash-strapped public schools.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, O'Connor has said the government cannot directly fund the
teaching of religion or single out religious schools for special
benefits.</TE>
<TE>   It is a different matter, however, if parents or students make the key
choices about where to go for their schooling, even if their choice of a
religious school is subsidized by the government, she says.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, O'Connor and the high court upheld a tuition tax credit
law in Minnesota that subsidized parents who sent their children to
religious schools. She also joined the court in upholding the use of
federal funds for college students who attended religious institutions.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, the lawyers defending the Ohio program were quick to
invoke O'Connor's favorite theme.</TE>
<TE>   "The Ohio scholarship program offers true private choice for parents.
And it is open to all comers," said Judith L. French, an Ohio state
attorney, who was representing state school Supt. Susan Zelman.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Solicitor General Theodore B. Olson echoed her point. State aid
flows to parochial schools only through the "genuinely independent
choice" of parents. "No reasonable observer would say this is the
government endorsing religion," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration supports vouchers and other aid programs for
religious schools. The president's budget calls on Congress to enact a
$2,500 federal tax credit for parents paying tuition for elementary and
secondary schools.</TE>
<TE>   Justice David H. Souter, who has insisted on a strict separation of
church and state, pointed to the fact that 99% of the Cleveland voucher
money goes to religious schools.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have to look at the effect of this. That's the sticking
point for me. At the end of the day, a massive amount of money is going
to religious schools," Souter said. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist
intervened to block this argument. "When the parents do the choosing,
it's a different ballgame," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy spoke in defense of the
voucher program, and Justice Clarence Thomas has already said he believes
such aid programs are constitutional.</TE>
<TE>   Waving his arms and gesturing, NEA general counsel Robert Chanin
denounced vouchers as "a lousy option" and "back-door" way to funnel tax
money into church schools. But his energetic style--as well as his
argument--fell flat in the courtroom. He said the state government should
provide more money for Cleveland's public schools.</TE>
<TE>   Scalia interrupted to say the Cleveland public schools receive $7,000
per student, an ample amount.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a money problem. It's a monopoly problem," he said, a
reference to what he sees as a lack of competition for public schools.</TE>
<TE>   The justices repeatedly pressed Chanin and disputed his claims. By the
end, he appeared to have won over no one. A ruling in the case, Zelman
vs. Simmons-Harris, 00-1751, is expected by late June.</TE>

<HD>Red Cross' Top Rating Suspended</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A charity watchdog group has stripped its top rating from the
American Red Cross, already battered for its response to the Sept. 11
attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The Better Business Bureau's Wise Giving Alliance has taken down a
favorable report on the Red Cross from its Web site, where donors are
updated about whether a charity meets the watchdog's management
standards. The alliance pulled the report while it awaits the Red Cross'
response to 35 detailed questions about the charity's relief work related
to the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, including its
use of donated money and blood.</LD>
<LD>   The move surprised and angered Red Cross officials, who are demanding
that the favorable report be restored until it delivers its responses,
expected March 30--a date the agency and the alliance agreed on. "It's
like being sentenced before the trial," Red Cross spokesman Robert
Chlopak said.</LD>
<TE>   "We're not singling out the Red Cross," Bennett Weiner, the alliance's
chief operating officer, said Wednesday. "We're going through an
appropriate procedure in a charity report situation here--in this case
where there has been a lot of public inquiries and discussion."</TE>
<TE>   The alliance updates its reports on the 350 charities it tracks about
every 18 months. About three-fourths of the charities evaluated meet the
alliance's standards. The previous alliance report on the Red Cross was
dated July 2000, Weiner said.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Cross and the Wise Giving Alliance, based in Arlington, Va.,
declined to release the questions.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Cross received nearly $850 million in donations and thousands
of extra units of blood after Sept. 11 and drew criticism from the public
and on Capitol Hill for its handling of both.</TE>

<HD>Justices Review Executions for Mentally Impaired</HD>
<DH>Law: Supreme Court is told that many states do not seek death
penalty against the retarded. It is 'a settled moral judgment,' Breyer
says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The growing movement to ban the execution of mentally retarded
killers took another step forward Wednesday as the Supreme Court heard
new evidence that virtually every state has backed away from imposing the
ultimate punishment on inmates with diminished mental capacity.</LD>
<LD>   "The evidence is now clear: The American people have reached a
consensus" against executing these individuals, James Ellis, a University
of New Mexico law professor, told the court, arguing that such executions
violate the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment.</LD>
<LD>   In 1989, when the justices last considered the issue, only two states
that imposed the death penalty exempted those who were mentally retarded.
Now 18 states have enacted such exemptions.</LD>
<TE>   And most other pro-death penalty states, including California, have
not executed anyone with an IQ of 70 or below, the standard definition
for retardation.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Stephen G. Breyer said it appeared that only two states--which
he did not name--would still go ahead with executing such a defendant. He
noted that "48 [of the 50 states] represents a consensus, a settled moral
judgment."</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court itself is well aware of the trend.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the justices voted to take up an appeal from Ernest
McCarver, a mentally retarded defendant from North Carolina. But before
the case could be heard, the North Carolina Legislature met and abolished
capital punishment for retarded inmates.</TE>
<TE>   The justices dismissed the McCarver case and took up a similar appeal
in a Virginia case. Earlier this month, the Virginia Senate voted to
exempt retarded individuals from the death penalty. But because that
measure has not passed the state Assembly, the justices are proceeding to
decide the issue. Nonetheless, the actions by state lawmakers seem to
signal the growing opposition to such executions.</TE>
<TE>   Little attention was paid Wednesday to the facts of the Virginia
inmate's case. Daryl Atkins, then 18, and another man confronted an Air
Force serviceman outside a convenience store near Hampton, Va., and
forced him at gunpoint to withdraw money from an automated teller
machine. The pair drove in the victim's pickup truck to a remote area,
where Atkins shot the airman eight times, killing him.</TE>
<TE>   During Atkins' trial, there was conflicting testimony over whether he
was mentally retarded. A defense expert said Atkins had an IQ of 59, but
an expert for the state said he was not retarded.</TE>
<TE>   Pamela Rumpz, a Virginia state attorney, said jurors should be
permitted to consider all the facts and make an "individualized
sentencing decision."</TE>
<TE>   Twice jurors had unanimously voted for a death sentence for Atkins.
"This was premeditated and deliberate," she said of the murder committed
by Atkins.</TE>
<TE>   The justices said Wednesday that in this case, they need not decide
whether Atkins was truly retarded.</TE>
<TE>   If the Supreme Court rules that executing a mentally retarded person
is a cruel and unusual punishment, states still will be able to decide
who in fact is retarded, noted Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.</TE>
<TE>   Only Justice Antonin Scalia strongly disagreed with the notion that
retarded people should be exempted from the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see the necessary connection between intelligence and moral
responsibility," Scalia said. "The question is whether they can
understand right from wrong. You can bring that issue [of retardation] to
the jury and say, 'This person should not be executed. He's not playing
with a full deck.' "</TE>
<TE>   But Scalia questioned why all retarded defendants should be
automatically excluded from the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Ellis argued that people who are retarded "do not fully understand the
wrongness of their actions." During their trials, retarded defendants
sometimes smile at odd moments, giving jurors the impression they have no
remorse for their actions.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Ellis said, retarded defendants in murder cases are in
special danger of provoking juries to impose death sentences. For this
reason, they should be exempted as a group.</TE>
<TE>   "They can be punished and given life in prison. But the death penalty
is different," Ellis said.</TE>
<TE>   A ruling in the case, Atkins vs. Virginia, 00-8452, can be expected in
several months.</TE>

<HD>Tribes OK Ariz. Deal on Betting</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX
</DL>
<LD>Gov. Jane Dee Hull announced an agreement Wednesday with the
Arizona Indian Gaming Assn. that could put more slot machines into play
at tribal casinos, allow Las Vegas-style blackjack and give the state a
cut of the action.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement is a blueprint for new 10-year gaming compacts between
the state and its Indian tribes. Current compacts start to expire next
year.</LD>
<LD>   "We do have now the outline for new compacts agreed upon," Hull
spokeswoman Francie Noyes said. "The governor is very pleased. It's very
fair to all the partners involved."</LD>
<TE>   Hull and the 17 tribes in the gaming association have been negotiating
new agreements for the last two years. But several steps must be taken
before the deal becomes reality because Arizona's horse and dog tracks
won a lawsuit last year challenging the governor's ability to negotiate
and sign such compacts. A federal judge ruled that the state Legislature
must have a significant role in approving them.</TE>
<TE>   Hull has asked lawmakers to make changes in state law to comply with
that ruling. Legislators would then be able to vote on the gaming plan
but may not be able to make changes.</TE>
<TE>   "This is it," Noyes said. "Up or down."</TE>
<TE>   The agreement between Hull and the tribes would restrict gaming to
reservation lands, maintain the state limit of 14,675 slot machines,
place new restrictions on tribal gaming and provide the state with an
estimated $80 million in the first full year. The state's take could
reach $1 billion over the life of the 10-year agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Tribes that currently don't use their allotted slot machines could
transfer them to other tribes, putting more of them in play.</TE>

<HD>ID, Recovery of Bodies Likely to Take Months</HD>
<DH>Crime: Officials point to the 'staggering' cost of the work at the
Georgia crematory. Number of corpses found is put at 242.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RALPH FRAMMOLINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NOBLE, Ga.
</DL>
<LD>Georgia state officials said Wednesday it will take at least eight
months and a "staggering" amount of money to recover and identify the
hundreds of bodies they expect to find at the Tri-State Crematory.</LD>
<LD>   The cost will include draining a 12-to-15-acre lake on the crematory
grounds, where officials said an underwater camera found a torso and a
skull submerged about 20 yards from the shoreline.</LD>
<LD>   The massive canvass of the 16-acre grounds and the nearby home of
crematory operator Brent Marsh has cost the state about $5 million. So
far, law enforcement officials have recovered 242 corpses--a number
certain to rise as they continue opening six steel vaults they say are
crammed with bodies.</LD>
<TE>   Marsh, 28, remains in the Walker County Jail on a suicide watch and
has waived his right for a speedy arraignment while he looks for an
attorney, officials said. Dist. Atty. Herbert "Buzz" Franklin said that
he intends to charge Marsh, already facing 16 counts of felony theft,
with additional violations for every body that is identified.</TE>
<TE>   But aggrieved families are seeking civil recourse. At least two
class-action lawsuits were filed this week and a third is expected today.</TE>
<TE>   One filed in Cleveland, Tenn., on Tuesday seeks $100 million from
Marsh and Tri-State for the "depravity" of failing to cremate the body of
a local woman who died in November 2000. The other, filed Wednesday in
LaFayette, the Walker County seat, asks unspecified damages alleging
Marsh returned containers with "ashes, sticks, insects, sand, gravel,
ground masonry particles and other things" to four people who paid $1,020
for the cremation of their loved ones.</TE>
<TE>   Both lawsuits also name Cleveland-based Buckner-Rush funeral homes,
which contracted the cremations to Tri-State, and Prime Succession
Holdings Inc., the parent company, as co-defendants for failing to make
sure the cremations were performed.</TE>
<TE>   Tests have identified 35 of the bodies, and revealed that 29 families
received urns "adulterated" by foreign materials like cement dust or the
ashes of someone other than their dead relatives.</TE>
<TE>   Gary McConnell, director of the Georgia Emergency Management Agency,
warned that the financial burden to taxpayers will be steep.</TE>
<TE>   He said the first five days of the investigation have already cost the
state about $1 million a day in equipment rental, hotel rooms and
overtime pay for the 500 employees on the Tri-State case. The
labor-intensive work of digging up and identifying the bodies will
require a "long-term" commitment of at least eight months, said
McConnell, who compared the task to the agency's assignment of
identifying and returning 474 bodies washed out of cemeteries during the
1994 floods in Albany, Ga.</TE>
<TE>   "I assure you we're a very expensive operation," McConnell said. "The
cost is going to be staggering."</TE>
<TE>   He declined to give an estimate until after he meets with Gov. Roy
Barnes today to talk about the scope of the operation but vowed it would
include draining the lake.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies continue to find bodies behind Marsh's house. They found a
coffin with remains and a mound with at least 10 corpses. That discovery,
made Tuesday, was in addition to the scores of bodies found in pits and
vaults on the crematory grounds and homestead of Marsh's parents, Ray,
75, and Clara, 69.</TE>
<TE>   McConnell said he's awaiting the results of water quality tests before
sending in divers, and is working with the state's Environmental
Protection Division to figure out how much water the lake holds and how
it should be removed.</TE>

<HD>Tapes Show No Danger in Flight 587's Takeoff, Then a Call Reports
Fireball</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Ground control recordings depict efforts by controllers
and other fliers to assess the fatal American Airlines crash in New York.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Minutes after American Airlines Flight 587 took off without
incident from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport last
November, ground controllers got an urgent radio transmission.</LD>
<LD>   "Tower, look . . . to the south. There's an aircraft crashing," said a
male voice, captured on a tape released Wednesday by the Federal Aviation
Administration. The voice apparently belonged to the unidentified pilot
of another plane in the air nearby.</LD>
<LD>   "Say again?" a controller at Kennedy immediately queried, seeking
confirmation of what she had just heard. There had been no warning of any
trouble.</LD>
<TE>   "An aircraft just crashed south of the field. . . . Affirm a
fireball," came the terse reply.</TE>
<TE>   The FAA tapes contain no hint of what snapped the tail fin off the
A300 jetliner on the clear morning of Nov. 12. The ensuing crash killed
all 260 people aboard and five people on the ground in a residential
neighborhood in New York. The recordings depict the efforts of FAA
controllers, other flight crews and police helicopter pilots to determine
what went so swiftly and dreadfully wrong.</TE>
<TE>   The ground control tapes are different from the cockpit voice
recorder, which preserves conversations between the pilots and remains in
the hands of investigators at the National Transportation Safety Board.
The agency is trying to determine whether a structural or mechanical
defect, a mistake by the pilots or some combination of factors caused the
crash. The safety board did not find a problem with the controllers'
performance.</TE>
<TE>   No audible stress could be detected in the voice of the Flight 587
pilot as the plane climbed beyond 5,000 feet. Ground controllers had
alerted the pilots to beware of the wake of a Boeing 747 ahead of them.
The warning itself was routine, and there was no indication from the
flight deck that the pilots of Flight 587 encountered unusual turbulence.</TE>
<TE>   Co-pilot Sten Molin was flying the takeoff, so Capt. Edward States
would have been handling communication with the ground. But the FAA
transcript did not identify which pilot was speaking. The last words from
the cockpit were in aviation jargon, an acknowledgment of standard
navigation instructions from controllers.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after 9:16 a.m.--barely 30 seconds from that last
transmission--the first warning of a crash was received at the Kennedy
tower.</TE>
<TE>   Less than 20 seconds later, a controller handling outbound planes from
an FAA facility on Long Island noticed that Flight 587 was no longer on
his radar screen. "American 587 heavy," he radioed. "I'm not receiving
your transponder." The transponder is a device on the aircraft that
automatically broadcasts identifying information to the ground and to
other planes. "Heavy" is controller jargon for a large jetliner.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, at the Kennedy tower, a frantic search was underway. "You
missing any of your departures?" an unidentified male voice asked the
tower controller.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to figure it out now, sir," she responded. "We're trying
to see if we're missing any aircraft. Stand by."</TE>
<TE>   The pilot of Delta Flight 79 airborne nearby radioed the Kennedy
tower: "It was a heavy jet, anyway."</TE>
<TE>   "It was a heavy jet, sir?" asked the controller.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, it looked like it," the pilot replied.</TE>
<TE>   The controller on Long Island tried repeatedly to contact Flight 587
on his radio. Three New York police helicopters radioed that they were
heading for the crash site. The controller at Kennedy took over the job
of keeping the helicopters at a safe distance from each other and other
aircraft. And she halted further takeoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Another American Airlines jetliner radioed the control facility on
Long Island. American Flight 686 had taken off next in line after Flight
587.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, just to let you know we saw a huge . . . tremendous amount of
black smoke," said the Flight 686 pilot.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about five miles behind us," he continued. "It's on the land,
and it's . . . tremendous, like it's a huge fire, a tremendous amount of
black smoke. Kennedy tower would probably be able to see that with no
problem."</TE>
<TE>   At Kennedy, the tower controller was still trying to call Flight 587.</TE>
<TE>   Final confirmation came from the pilot of a small private plane, a
Beechcraft Baron. "What do you see off to your left?" the controller on
Long Island asked him.</TE>
<TE>   "A big column of rising brown smoke," said the pilot. He kept calling
in descriptions. "It's a big, intense fire down there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "OK," answered another controller on Long Island. "We've got
helicopters there."</TE>

<HD>Boot Camp Counselor Guilty in Death</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX
</DL>
<LD>A counselor at a tough-love boot camp for youngsters pleaded guilty
Wednesday to negligent homicide in the death of a teenage camper and
agreed to cooperate in a case against the camp's director, a prosecutor
said.</LD>
<LD>   Troy A. Hutty was one of two counselors who put Anthony Haynes, 14, in
a motel bathtub to cool him after he collapsed in triple-digit heat last
summer. The teen later died of complications of dehydration and
near-drowning.</LD>
<LD>   The plea agreement stipulates that Hutty receive probation, but a
judge has the power to sentence him to up to a year behind bars,
officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Director Charles Long II was charged last week in the teenager's
death. Two other staffers also face charges.</TE>
<TE>   "We want the truth," prosecutor Rick Romley said. Hutty's cooperation
"allows us to get not just a clearer understanding but things we not
might otherwise get without him."</TE>
<TE>   Hutty's attorney, Gary Beren, did not return phone calls seeking
comment Wednesday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Haynes died July 1 after being made to stand in the sun for up to five
hours, then being left in the bathtub, the medical examiner's office
said.</TE>
<TE>   Haynes was attending a five-week boot camp near Phoenix operated by
the America's Buffalo Soldiers Re-Enactors Assn. The camp was closed
after the teen's death.</TE>
<TE>   Long is charged with second-degree murder, along with eight counts of
child abuse. He planned to plead not guilty at his arraignment Friday,
said his attorney, David Smith. He is being held on $100,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   The camp included forced marches, wearing black uniforms, harsh
discipline and a daily diet of an apple, a carrot and a bowl of beans.</TE>
<TE>   Lawsuits have been filed by Haynes' parents and a woman who said her
son was beaten and forced to eat mud.</TE>

<HD>Yates Jury to See Grisly Scene Photos</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>Jurors in the Andrea Yates child-killing case will be allowed to
see more than two dozen photos taken at the crime scene, a judge ruled
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   State District Judge Belinda Hill admitted 29 of the photos of the
dead children and contents of the Yates home after the state agreed to
withdraw 10 others. Hill said the photos' relevance outweighed any
prejudice they might cause the jury.</LD>
<LD>   The court recessed early because of an emergency unrelated to the
trial. A juror was returned to the jury room, where he was joined by
Hill.</LD>
<TE>   "It causes us not to be able to proceed today. It has nothing to do
with the case," Hill said when she reemerged. She did not elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Yates, 37, could face the death penalty. She has pleaded not guilty by
reason of insanity.</TE>
<TE>   At issue during the trial is whether Yates suffered from a mental
illness and knew the difference between right and wrong at the time of
the drownings.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony was scheduled to resume today.</TE>
<TE>   One of the photos shows 7-year-old Noah Yates floating face down in
the bathtub with his arms outstretched, submerged beneath the water.
Others detailed bruising on the children and how the bodies of Noah's
four younger siblings--John, 5; Paul, 3; Luke, 2; and Mary, 6
months--were laid out on a bed in the back bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors also plan to show photos taken during the children's
autopsies. Prosecutor Kaylynn Williford said it is never easy to present
evidence such as pictures of the dead children.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney George Parnham appeared bothered by some of the
photos that flashed onto a computerized monitor as attorneys discussed
them.</TE>
<TE>   Yates was removed from the courtroom before the pictures were shown.
It isn't clear whether she will be in the courtroom when the photos are
viewed by jurors.</TE>
<TE>   Also admitted was a videotape made by Houston police Officer Glenn
West of the Yates home, a one-story Spanish style brick house, after he
arrived June 20.</TE>

<HD>Raids Meant to Stop Flow of Cash to Iraq</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Money-transfer agents in 14 states were raided in an effort to stop
the illegal wiring of millions of dollars to Iraq, the government said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Customs Service Commissioner Robert C. Bonner said 29 search
warrants on businesses and individuals were executed, allowing law
enforcement agents to seize documents and records. The identities of the
businesses and individuals were not disclosed and no arrests were made.</LD>
<LD>   The government believes the targeted businesses and individuals served
as money-transfer agents for Al-Shafei Family Connect Inc.</LD>
<TE>   Customs has accused Al-Shafei Family Connect of sending millions of
dollars to Iraq in violation of a decade-old embargo. A raid on the
company's Seattle-area office last month turned up files containing the
names of individual company agents in the U.S., the Customs Service said.</TE>
<TE>   A 1990 executive order signed by former President Bush forbids U.S.
citizens from transferring money--directly or indirectly--to the Iraqi
government or its people.</TE>
<TE>   Customs said the individuals and businesses targeted Wednesday also
are under investigation for possible violations of money-laundering laws
and possible violations of regulations requiring money-service businesses
to register with the government.</TE>
<TE>   The searches took place in Buffalo, N.Y.; Chicago; Louisville, Ky.;
Dallas; Detroit; Memphis, Tenn.; Minneapolis; Norfolk, Va.; Erie, Pa.;
Portland, Ore.; Lincoln, Neb.; St. Louis; Tucson; and Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Customs has said that Al-Shafei wired money intended for recipients in
Iraq to a bank in Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   Adel Al-Absawi, owner of Sara's Market in Erie, said officials took
receipts and bank statements in Wednesday's search.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Orders End to Airline VIP Lines</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The U.S. government has told commercial airlines to close the VIP
lines that allow their most valued customers, mainly business travelers,
to avoid long waits for security checks at airports, officials said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The elimination of the perk was ordered by the Transportation Security
Administration, which took over airport passenger and baggage screening
from the airlines at more than 420 airports Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Transportation officials said the decision to do away with VIP lines
reflected a move to make the overhaul of airport security equitable since
it is now a federal function.</LD>
<TE>   The VIP lines cut the wait for passenger and baggage screening to
minutes, instead of an hour or more, and allowed business travelers to
spend less time at the airport.</TE>
<TE>   The special service was created by the airlines to remedy long
screening lines after the Sept. 11 attacks on America and to boost the
sagging business travel market, a priority for big carriers.</TE>
<TE>   John Magaw, the agency director, said last week that security demands
would be balanced with passenger convenience, but common sense would
prevail and not everyone would be happy.</TE>
<TE>   One travel expert warned that the industry and the government has to
find a way to cut down on airport waiting time if they want to revive the
lucrative airline business.</TE>
<TE>   "These long lines in short-haul markets . . . if you start putting an
extra hour or an hour and a half, then business travelers are going to
opt for their car or the train," said Kevin Mitchell of the Business
Travel Coalition.</TE>
<TE>   Some airlines have removed the VIP lines at certain airports to comply
with the new requirement, but others have not.</TE>
<TE>   The order was conveyed verbally to airlines, an administration
official said.</TE>
<TE>   One industry official said the order has prompted confusion.</TE>
<TE>   He said there is uncertainty in the industry about the extent of
federal authority beyond the function of screening passengers and bags.</TE>

<HD>Illinois Budget Proposal Cuts State Jobs, Services</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SPRINGFIELD, Ill.
</DL>
<LD>Gov. George Ryan proposed a $52.8-billion budget Wednesday that
would drag state government out of the red by cutting thousands of jobs
and reducing payments to doctors and pharmacists who care for the poor.</LD>
<LD>   He called for closing two prisons and a center for the mentally ill as
the state adjusts to a dramatic drop in tax revenues.</LD>
<LD>   The austerity comes after flush years in which the state provided new
services and ambitious brick-and-mortar projects while giving refunds to
taxpayers.</LD>
<TE>   "The fiscal year 2003 budget I propose today is lean, it's fair and
it's balanced," Ryan said in his last budget and State of the State
address.</TE>
<TE>   Critics have proposed bringing in more money by raising cigarette or
riverboat taxes, but Ryan said that would not win legislative approval in
an election year.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan warned that he would not accept changes to the budget that add to
government spending.</TE>
<TE>   "If that happens again this year, I will have to veto the entire
budget. You can take that to the bank," Ryan said to stony silence.</TE>
<TE>   As in many other states, Illinois' government faces its toughest
financial crisis in a decade.</TE>
<TE>   Tax revenues fell by hundreds of millions of dollars last fall as
recession, driven deeper by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World
Trade Center and the Pentagon, froze the economy. At the same time, state
expenses climbed sharply, especially for medical services.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan responded to the falloff by cutting nearly $500 million from the
current year's budget and spending every surplus dollar. He sought
approval for further cuts, but lawmakers--particularly House
Democrats--refused to cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan's budget seeks to reduce the number of employees under his
control by 3,800. About 3,000 people would be laid off, with 800 more
positions lost through attrition. Early retirement offers could bring the
cuts to 5,000.</TE>

<HD>Search for Rare Woodpecker Is Fruitless</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SLIDELL, La.
</DL>
<LD>Searchers who launched a special effort to find an ivory-billed
woodpecker, long believed to be extinct, said Wednesday they did not see
one of the birds but did find some encouraging signs.</LD>
<LD>   The team, which spent a month in the wilds, found evidence that at
least one of the birds might live in the Pearl River wildlife management
area, about 50 miles north of New Orleans.</LD>
<LD>   Ivory-billed woodpeckers--sometimes called the Holy Grail of
bird-watching--were the biggest woodpeckers in North America, with a
30-inch wingspan. They have been rare since the late 1800s. John James
Audubon noted in the 1840s that they were heavily hunted for their skins.</LD>
<TE>   The search team members saw what they described as excellent habitat
and many trees from which bark had been stripped in a pattern associated
with ivory-billed woodpeckers. The group also saw possible nesting
cavities, and four team members heard a series of raps like those the
bird is said to have used for signals.</TE>
<TE>   However, they never saw one of the birds or heard its call.</TE>
<TE>   "Were we in a time and place where there were known to be ivory-billed
woodpeckers, I myself would say the signs and signals were definitive,"
said biologist Peter McBride, a search team member. "Since we are not in
such a time and place, I think we must be very careful about saying these
are signs of the ivory-billed woodpecker."</TE>
<TE>   The team recommended further searches, perhaps in November or
December. Searching in winter is easier, when trees are bare.</TE>
<TE>   The search was inspired by the claim of David Kulivan that he saw a
pair of the birds in the swamps in 1999 when he was a forestry student.</TE>
<TE>   Most reported sightings turn out to be pileate woodpeckers, which are
almost as big and have similar markings but no ivory bill.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Will Not Lie to Public, Defense Chief Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A new Defense Department office created to try to influence public
opinion abroad will not lie to the public or plant disinformation in the
foreign or U.S. media, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "The Department of Defense, this secretary and the people that work
with me tell the American people and the people of the world the truth,"
Rumsfeld said in Salt Lake City, where he was attending the Winter
Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   Both Rumsfeld and Vice President Dick Cheney drew distinctions Tuesday
between lying to the public and engaging in tactical deception on the
battlefield, which Cheney called a practice that has "historically been
important."</LD>
<TE>   "During the Gulf War, when we spent a great deal of time practicing in
a very visible way for amphibious operations," Cheney said in Fresno,
Calif., the Iraqis "tied up five or six divisions defending the beach in
Kuwait City when obviously the main thrust of the attack was not going to
be over the beach but out to the west."</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld and Cheney commented on the new Office of Strategic Influence
as some critics expressed concern over tentative plans to disseminate
information, possibly disinformation, to more directly influence foreign
public opinion and assist U.S. forces fighting terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Aftergood, head of the Federation of American Scientists'
project on government secrecy, said that a "pernicious consequence" of
plans for secret information operations is that they "call into question
the credibility of government officials."</TE>
<TE>   "The problem with disinformation is it has the potential to corrupt
the channels of public discourse," Aftergood said. "Today, as never
before, there is a global media network, and it is no longer possible to
plant a story in a particular foreign outlet and have any assurance at
all that it will not feed into the global information stream."</TE>
<TE>   Douglas Feith, undersecretary of Defense for policy and the official
responsible for overseeing the office, said its mandate is still being
formulated.</TE>
<TE>   He said no plan for planting disinformation in the media would be
approved.</TE>
<TE>   "Defense Department officials don't lie to the public," Feith said.
"We are confident that the truth serves our interests in the broadest
sense of our national security and specifically in this war."</TE>
<TE>   He also said the Office of Strategic Influence would not be involved
in "covert action."</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Mayor's Tannish Hue Pales in Comparison to Cry That Ensues</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Talk of tan lines and skin tones intruded at a news briefing by
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg on Wednesday, but the new mayor remained mum
about a mysterious weekend getaway that has caused a media furor.</LD>
<LD>   Bloomberg has been grilled for two days by the media after slipping
out of the city without official word Friday and returning to
winter-weary Manhattan on Monday, sporting a tan.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, the mayor refused to give details of his weekend break,
insisting on his right to have a private life.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a fair statement to say that if I won't discuss my personal
life, then I won't discuss the coverage of my personal life," Bloomberg
said.</TE>
<TE>   The storm appeared at first to be a mild diversion for a city still
recovering from the trauma of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World
Trade Center. But it has been sharpened by New York's $4.8-billion budget
deficit, stemming in large part from the devastation in lower Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg's aides raised questions about a picture of their boss on
the front page of the Daily News, saying that Bloomberg looked much
redder in the face than he does in reality, suggesting a printing error
or a photo retouching.</TE>

<HD>40 Years Later, Astronaut Glenn Phones It In</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>Two spacewalking astronauts successfully checked out a little-used
portal at the international space station on Wednesday and got a call of
congratulations from John Glenn.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm envious at what you're doing up there," said Glenn, celebrating
his 40th anniversary as the first American in orbit.</LD>
<LD>   "I never got to do a spacewalk. But I've joked and I said that NASA
wouldn't let me do that because they were afraid at my age on that last
flight in '98 that I might wander off someplace."</LD>
<TE>   Glenn, 80, orbited the Earth on Feb. 20, 1962, and 36 years later rode
aboard a shuttle to became the oldest person to fly in space.</TE>
<TE>   On board the space station, astronauts Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch
emerged early from the American-made Quest air lock and quickly completed
advance work for the next assembly mission, in April. They hooked up
electrical cables and gathered tools to be used by others on that shuttle
flight.</TE>
<TE>   The Quest air lock was installed last summer and experienced minor
problems at the time. It had not been used since.</TE>
<TE>   The spacewalk, at nearly six hours, lasted longer than Glenn's
four-hour, 55-minute flight aboard Friendship 7.</TE>
<TE>   "We probably had almost as much room in our spacesuit today as you had
in the Mercury," Bursch told Glenn. "Some things never change. We also
have a lot of medical tests that we have to do tomorrow, much like you
did after your flight, both flights."</TE>
<TE>   Both spacewalkers wore new radiation-monitoring badges to measure the
dosage to their eyes, internal organs and skin. Cosmic radiation outside
a shielded spaceship can cause cancer, cataracts or nerve damage.</TE>
<TE>   Walz, Bursch and their Russian commander, Yuri Onufrienko, are almost
halfway through their nearly six-month mission.</TE>

<LD>President Bush and Chinese President Jiang Zemin agreed today to
expand U.S.-China contacts, announcing that both Jiang and Vice President
Hu Jintao will soon visit the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Bush and Jiang made the announcement--a further sign of the warming of
Sino-U.S.-relations--at a dramatic news conference punctuated by two
American reporters' insistent but polite questioning of Jiang on the
degree of religious freedom in China.</LD>
<LD>   Twice, Jiang was able to avoid answering because a Chinese government
official abruptly called on Chinese reporters before Jiang could answer
the American journalists.</LD>
<TE>   Later, the Chinese president launched into a long and at times highly
personal discussion of faith and religious liberty in China, contending
that the people in China indeed enjoy such freedom.</TE>
<TE>   Breaking with custom, Jiang began his final answer by speaking in
English, opening with a self-effacing quip.</TE>
<TE>   "When it comes to meeting the press, President Bush has much more
experience than I," Jiang said. "I will do my best to answer your
question."</TE>
<TE>   Returning to Chinese, Jiang noted at one point that he was not a man
of "religious faith," yet has read both the Bible and the Koran.</TE>
<TE>   But Jiang added: "Whatever religion people believe in, they have to
abide by the law. So some of the lawbreakers have been detained because
of their violation of law, not because of their religious belief."</TE>
<TE>   Religious freedom has emerged as a top issue in Bush's approach to
China, an officially atheistic nation where tens of millions of people
have embraced religion nevertheless. Bush and Jiang had also discussed
religious faith and freedom in their last meeting, in Shanghai in
October.</TE>
<TE>   In South Korea on Wednesday, Bush told reporters that he would call on
Jiang to honor the papal nuncio's request that Beijing open a dialogue
with bishops in China. Bush also said he intended to bring up the matter
of the Dalai Lama.</TE>
<TE>   The news conference's dramatic exchanges over religion came shortly
after Bush said, as he ended his opening statement:</TE>
<TE>   "All the world's people, including the people of China, should be free
to choose how they live, how they worship and how they work."</TE>
<TE>   Terry Moran of ABC News asked Jiang to explain "why your government
restricts the practice of religious faith--in particular, why your
government has imprisoned more than 50 bishops of the Roman Catholic
Church."</TE>
<TE>   The Chinese government forbids recognition of the Vatican, with which
it broke off formal diplomatic ties in the 1950s. Catholic missionaries
were expelled.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and Jiang said they discussed a wide range of issues and agreed
to continue trying to make progress on matters of disagreement.</TE>
<TE>   "Our ties are mature, respectful and important to both our nations and
to the world," Bush declared.</TE>
<TE>   Like Bush, Jiang played down the fact that the U.S. and China have
lingering differences, saying it was "natural for China and the United
States to disagree on some issues."</TE>
<TE>   Bush, for instance, reiterated the U.S. commitment to defend Taiwan,
which China regards as part of itself.</TE>
<TE>   But the president also praised Jiang for urging North Korean leader
Kim Jong Il to accept South Korea's offer of dialogue and rapprochement.</TE>
<TE>   "That was constructive leadership," Bush said of Jiang.</TE>
<TE>   On the subject of Iraq, Jiang signaled that China would not support
any military action by the United States, a move the Bush administration
has been considering.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has been especially pleased with the Communist regime's general
support of the U.S.-led campaign against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some of the perennial sticking points in Sino-U.S. relations
are expected to arise.</TE>
<TE>   The relationship with the Holy See has been fraught with tension since
the break in relations. About 1 1/2 years ago, Pope John Paul II
canonized 120 Catholic martyrs in China, which incensed Beijing. Both
sides have consecrated their own bishops--the Vatican secretly--in China,
in a battle for hearts and minds.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the Vatican's news agency said that dozens of priests and
bishops in China loyal to the pope had been detained and that more were
being watched.</TE>
<TE>   But the pope is known to want a rapprochement with Beijing and even
issued an apology last year for the Roman Catholic Church's past wrongs
in China.</TE>
<TE>   The Communist regime has insisted that any reconciliation would have
to satisfy two demands: that the Vatican sever diplomatic ties with
Taiwan and that it could not interfere in China's internal affairs "by
conducting religious activities."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's visit comes just a week after a U.S.-based religious rights
group released secret Chinese documents purporting to show a
government-ordered crackdown on religion.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the Communist regime has continued its drive to
stamp out the Falun Gong spiritual movement, which mobilized more than 40
foreigners last Thursday to demonstrate in Tiananmen Square in support of
the outlawed group. The protesters were detained and then expelled.</TE>
<TE>   Yet there also have been signals here that Beijing may be on the verge
of relaxing some of its religious restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, possibly as a gesture ahead of Bush's visit,
Beijing released a Hong Kong businessman imprisoned for smuggling Bibles
into the country, which the government says were bound for a sect called
the Shouters. The Bush administration had expressed concern over the
man's imprisonment.</TE>
<TE>   Among the other sticking points in bilateral relations are China's
human rights abuses and its assistance to countries such as Pakistan and
Iran in arming themselves.</TE>
<TE>   China agreed in November 2000 to start restricting the sale of
sensitive nuclear equipment and know-how. But Beijing has not begun
formulating export control rules and a list of sensitive technologies,
according to U.S. officials.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, the U.S. imposed sanctions on a Chinese firm suspected of
sending military equipment to Pakistan. Several months later, the U.S.
levied sanctions against Chinese companies suspected of providing
assistance to Iran.</TE>
<TE>   The president and First Lady Laura Bush were to attend a dinner in
their honor tonight, to be given by Jiang at the Great Hall of the
People.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Bush is to deliver an address at Qinghua University and
then field questions from students at the prestigious school.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said he was looking forward to meeting with the students "because
it gives me an opportunity to talk about the America I know--an America
with strong values of family, community, faith and freedom."</TE>
<TE>   In his weekly radio address over the weekend previewing his six-day
trip to Tokyo, Seoul and here, Bush said:</TE>
<TE>   "And I will express my hopes that as China moves forward, it, too,
will embrace the universal demands of human dignity, freedom of
conscience and religion, and the rights and value of every life."</TE>
<TE>   Last but not least, Bush will have a chance to take the initial
measure of the man expected to lead China's 1.3 billion people starting
next year.</TE>
<TE>   Vice President Hu is due to take over after Jiang retires as president
in early 2003. Little is known abroad about Hu, except that he was
anointed by the late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping to succeed Jiang.</TE>
<TE>   Hu is scheduled to introduce Bush at Qinghua on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Jiang is to visit the U.S. in October. No date was given for Hu's
visit.</TE>

<LD>Copyright extension--A story in Section A on Wednesday suggested
that copyrights for classic works from the 1920s and 1930s would have
expired by now if a 20-year extension had not been enacted in 1998. In
fact, copyrights for many of these works would not have lapsed until 2003
or later.</LD>

<LD>Oscar facts--A Feb. 7 Calendar Weekend article about the DVD
release of "Tron" incorrectly reported that the 1982 film had lost the
Academy Award for best visual effects to "Poltergeist." In fact, "Tron"
wasn't even nominated in that category, and the winner that year was
"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial."</LD>

<LD>Female firefighters-In a Jan. 18 commentary by Jonathan Turley, a
New York firefighter, Lt. Brenda Berkman, is quoted criticizing the fact
that the work of female firefighters was not specifically noted in
coverage of the Sept. 11 attacks and thus 'totally ignored' by the media.
This statement was made by Berkman at a screening of the film 'Women at
Ground Zero' and not in the film itself.</LD>

<HD>Hart's 'Scarlet Pimpernel' Brings High Jinks Back to
Fullerton Civic Opera</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK CHALON SMITH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Fullerton Civic Light Opera continues its Frank Wildhorn kick
with "The Scarlet Pimpernel," which is a lot more fun than his
brooding "Jekyll and Hyde" staged just four months ago.</LD>
<LD>   Much of the credit goes to T. Eric Hart, who was as inviting as a
funeral in the lead of "Jekyll and Hyde." This time, however, he's a
silly rascal ready to party. Imagine Liberace prancing about after
his fifth cup of coffee and you get an inkling of Hart's Sir Percy
Blakeney, otherwise known as the Scarlet Pimpernel.</LD>
<LD>   Hart does overdo it, gobbling up everything in his path as the
wolf in fop's clothing who battles for the underdog during the French
Revolution. But his performance fits the show's tone, as much
hootenanny and high jinks as swashbuckling melodrama.</LD>
<TE>   Wildhorn, not known for sending in the clowns, keeps winking
playfully at the audience throughout. Though not a great musical,
"The Scarlet Pimpernel" is certainly one of the composer's most
accessible.</TE>
<TE>   Wildhorn and lyricist Nan Knighton may have used Baroness Emmuska
Orczy's 1905 romantic novel as inspiration, but the goal was pure
Broadway extravaganza. With moody guillotine scenes, a ball at the
Royal Palace and even an English Channel crossing, there's a bounty
of opportunities for visual excitement.</TE>
<TE>   Director Jan Hunter, with help from set designer Terry Hanrahan
and others, tends to find them without much trouble. Even the florid
melody of "Madame Guillotine" seems less intrusive cast against the
barbaric contraption raised like a monolith at center stage, eerily
illuminated by lighting designer JacquiJones Watson.</TE>
<TE>   This early scene is also the first time we're offered a neat
magician's trick suggesting a decapitation that is more surprising
than grisly.</TE>
<TE>   Everything shifts to romance soon after, when the love between Sir
Percy and Marguerite (Melissa Walters) grows, then falters.</TE>
<TE>   A more lighthearted pitch takes over eventually, especially with
"The Creation of Man," as Sir Percy and his gang of evil-fighters
disguised as snobs flounce around in Sharell Martin's ticklishly
imaginative costumes.</TE>
<TE>   Though Hart gets to do most of the preening, it's Walters who
really beautifies everything. Her Marguerite is a comely mademoiselle
with a past, mostly tied to a tricky affair with the murderous
Chauvelin (Eric Anderson), Robespierre's henchman. Walters doesn't
give many clues to Marguerite's motivations for this dalliance, which
seems almost irrelevant when she starts singing.</TE>
<TE>   "When I Look at You" is, like most of Wildhorn's ballads, more pop
than passion, but as performed by Walters, it's still the evening's
prettiest moment.</TE>
<TE>   "The Scarlet Pimpernel," Fullerton Civic Light Opera, Plummer
Auditorium, 201 E. Chapman Ave. Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2
p.m.; Feb. 24, 7 p.m.; and March 2, 2 p.m. $16 to $40. Ends March 3.
(714) 879-1732.</TE>
