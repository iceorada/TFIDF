<HD>Engineering a turnaround at Hyundai Motor</HD>
<DH>CEO Finbarr O'Neill's decision to offer a 10-year
powertrain warranty helped ease quality concerns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John O'Dell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Finbarr O'Neill, Hyundai Motor America's chief executive, has been
named one of the "rising stars" of American business by Fast Company,
a management magazine that's been publishing an annual "Who's Fast"
list for the last five years.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neill is the only automotive executive on the list this year and
made it into the November issue byvirtue of the Hyundai turnaround
that he's helped engineer since taking the reins in 1998.</LD>
<LD>   The 50-year-old attorney joined Fountain Valley-based Hyundai
Motor America in 1985 when South Korean carmaker Hyundai Motor Inc.
decided the time was ripe to move into the U.S. market and set up HMA
as its North American arm. O'Neill, formerly of the Toyota Motor
Sales USA legal department in Torrance, was hired to be general
counsel; he held that post until he was propelled into the CEO's seat
in 1998 when a then-suffering Hyundai couldn't recruit an outsider to
try to fix the company.</LD>
<TE>   Fast Company cited O'Neill for his decision to use a
then-unheard-of 10-year powertrain warranty to relieve car shoppers'
anxiety about Hyundai quality. The firm's first cars had proved to be
unreliable, and a flood of sales based on low prices in the early
years had turned into a sales drought Hyundai's improved cars
couldn't overcome.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill says he figured the only way to persuade customers that
things had changed was to put Hyundai's money on the line, promising
to fix anything that went wrong for six years and anything that went
wrong with the engine and transmission for a full 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   The extensive warranty -- aided by new cars that are winning
praise from critics and scoring well on buyer satisfaction surveys
conducted by the likes of AutoPacific, J.D. Power &amp; Associates and
Strategic Vision -- has helped Hyundai regain momentum. Sales in the
last four years have doubled and doubled again, and Hyundai this year
seems likely to match Volkswagen's share of the U.S. market with
sales of about 370,000 cars and sport utility vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   EPA rates Insight tops</TE>
<TE>   For the fourth consecutive year, Honda Motor Co.'s two-seat
Insight hybrid leads the fuel-efficiency pack with a federal rating
of 61 miles per gallon in city driving and 68 mpg on the highway,
according to the just-released Environmental Protection Agency
fuel-efficiency guide for 2003 passenger vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   The rating, for the Insight with a five-speed manual transmission,
is unchanged from last year. The Insight is one of three hybrids
available in the U.S. market. It uses a small electric motor to
augment a small gasoline engine to provide the power of a standard
gas engine with fewer emissions and better mileage. The other
hybrids, and their EPA ratings: Honda's five-seat Civic Hybrid sedan,
46 mpg city and 51 mpg highway with a manual transmission, 48/47 with
an automatic; and Toyota's automatic-only, five-seat Prius sedan, 52
mpg city and 45 mpg highway. The Toyota gets its best mileage in town
because of the way its hybrid system works.</TE>
<TE>   At the other end of the spectrum, the new V-12 Enzo Ferrari sports
car from Ferrari had the worst rating of the gasoline-fueled cars and
trucks, at 8 mpg city and 12 mpg highway.</TE>
<TE>   The EPA tests use laboratory simulations of city and highway
driving, and many drivers find that they cannot achieve the same
results in real-world situations.</TE>
<TE>   This is the 28th year the EPA has issued ratings, available on the
Internet at www.fueleconomy.gov.</TE>
<TE>   Big, beefy engines</TE>
<TE>   It's been 65 years since General Motors Corp. headed down this
road, but after watching Italian, British and German companies profit
with high-priced, big-engined cars, the world's largest automaker
says it is resurrecting the 12-cylinder engine.</TE>
<TE>   The 7.5-liter V-12, capable of 500 horsepower or more, is part of
GM's effort to polish its luxe division's image.</TE>
<TE>   Though Cadillac sales are up this year -- a hefty 16% rise through
September -- the brand still trails BMW, Lexus and Mercedes-Benz in
the luxury category.</TE>
<TE>   The strategy, already seen in vehicles such as the Escalade and
the CTS sports coupe, is to make Caddy more visible through edgier
design and even costlier offerings. Division general manager Mark
LaNeve says Cadillac will offer a car in the $100,000 range in the
future.</TE>
<TE>   Automakers go for more cylinders rather than bigger-displacement
V-8 engines because V-12s are smoother running and make it easier to
have a lot of power while still meeting smog requirements. And there
are the bragging rights.</TE>
<TE>   V-12s typically power the cream of the automotive crop -- the most
expensive cars in the Mercedes-Benz lineup, for instance, and the new
Aston Martin Vanquish, the Lamborghini Murcielago, the Rolls-Royce
Park Ward and the Enzo Ferrari. Having a Caddy in that class can't
hurt.</TE>
<TE>   GM first showed its prototype V-12 last year at Pebble Beach, the
spot to be each August to catch the next big thing in high-end autos.</TE>
<TE>   Itty bitty city cars</TE>
<TE>   At 11.9 feet in length, BMW's Mini Cooper is the smallest
passenger car sold in the U.S. these days. But that might not last.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to cash in on what it sees as a potential surge in interest
for city-type cars that are small, maneuverable, easy to park and
easy on fuel, DaimlerChrysler is looking to bring a version of its
11.8-foot Mercedes-Benz A-Class to the U.S. as early as 2005,
according to AutoWeek Online. The report says Mercedes-Benz's top
global marketing executive believes that the A-Class will appeal to
young city dwellers who want a vehicle with strong visual cues, a
strong brand name and great fuel economy in a package that is easy to
park.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, the head of DaimlerChrysler's Smart unit told Reuters
during the recent Paris Motor Show that the company wants to bring
the tiny Smart to the U.S. as well.</TE>
<TE>   There still are issues to be worked out -- principally alterations
to the fuel system -- and no guarantee that U.S. authorities will
grant DaimlerChrysler the leeway it might need to make the 98-inch
two-seater legal here.</TE>
<TE>   Smart chief Andreas Renschler told Reuters he believes that the
Smart could sell well in urban markets in California, Florida and the
East Coast.</TE>
<TE>   Sneaker or SUV?</TE>
<TE>   Ford Motor Co. says its newest crossover sport utility, previously
called the CrossTrainer, will be the Freestyle when launched in 2004.
Apparently, CrossTrainer sounded too much like an athletic shoe or a
young lady's foundation garment, and didn't project a tough-enough
image.</TE>
<TE>   The Freestyle will have three rows of seating and room for six or
maybe seven people. It will share a basic platform with Ford's new
Five Hundred, an upmarket sedan also to be introduced in '04.</TE>
<TE>   Refunds for repairs</TE>
<TE>   There's little that's more frustrating than paying to have a car
problem fixed just weeks before the automaker issues a recall.</TE>
<TE>   Most auto and auto equipment makers have voluntary reimbursement
policies, but a new federal rule will make it mandatory to reimburse
motorists who pay to fix defects that later are the subject of
recalls.</TE>
<TE>   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration rule takes
effect in January and won't apply to vehicles or parts recalled
before then.</TE>

<HD>Japanese cars rank at top of German consumer survey</HD>
<DH>Toyota and its Lexus unit take first place in six of the
seven categories. Nissan takes the remaining top spot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John O'Dell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Familiarity, it seems, does breed a bit of contempt.</LD>
<LD>   Auto buyers in the U.S. rarely rate domestic vehicles at the top
of the heap in consumer satisfaction surveys, preferring instead
benchmark makes such as Mercedes-Benz and BMW.</LD>
<LD>   It turns out that car owners in Germany don't like their domestics
much either.</LD>
<TE>   They seem to prefer Japanese cars, rating them higher than most
European makes in quality and reliability in J.D. Power &amp; Associates'
inaugural German consumer satisfaction index survey.</TE>
<TE>   When owners' satisfaction with their cars' looks and reliability
were equal, the deciding factor seemed to be the ability of a brand's
dealers to keep customers happy after selling them a vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   BMW was the home team's best performer, with a third-place finish
behind Toyota and Mazda and just ahead of Honda. Porsche finished
fifth and Mercedes-Benz finished eighth. Daihatsu, a Toyota-owned
Japanese brand that specializes in small cars, scored better than
Mercedes. So did Subaru.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota and its Lexus unit, in fact, took first-place honors in six
of the seven categories in which the Power organization slots cars
sold in Germany. Japan's Nissan took the remaining top spot in the
survey of 15,000 car owners who rated their 2- to 3-year-old cars
based on their experiences with the vehicle, the dealership and the
overall cost of operation.</TE>
<TE>   The names of car owners aren't readily available in Germany as
they are in the U.S. The Power organization had to use sources other
than official government records to build a mailing list for
soliciting survey responses, a spokesman said, adding that the
Westlake Village-based market research company doesn't believe its
findings are compromised.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the cars sold in Europe also are quite different from
their counterparts for the U.S. market, so direct comparisons between
the German survey and Power's findings in similar U.S. studies don't
work.</TE>
<TE>   Nissan's Maxima sedan, for instance, won for executive luxury car
-- not a slot in which a Maxima could comfortably slip in the U.S.
BMW sells far more small cars in Germany than in the U.S., as does
Mercedes-Benz. And the Lexus IS200 that took first-place honors in
the upper-medium category, though similar to the IS300 sold in the
U.S., comes with a smaller 2.0-liter engine that is too anemic to win
hearts in the land of the muscle car.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Power's chief European analyst, Dave Sargent, said European
consumers rate their cars in the satisfaction survey on the same
benchmarks that U.S. consumers use: quality and reliability come
first, followed by the vehicle's appeal -- design, features and
performance. Dealer service ranks third in importance, with cost of
operation -- a category that looks at fuel efficiency, repairs and
maintenance -- the last of the quartet.</TE>
<TE>   The survey results seem to show that "even in Germany, where there
is a national pride in German autos, there is real appreciation that
the Japanese are building some seriously great machinery, especially
in their luxury brands," said auto industry consultant Gordon
Wangers, president of AMCI, a Vista, Calif.-based market research
firm.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Gorrell, vice president of Strategic Vision, an auto market
research and consulting firm headquartered in La Jolla, points out
that Germans still buy far more German cars than Japanese brands and
said he doesn't believe it would be accurate to use the Power survey
to claim that Toyota and other Japanese carmakers are poised to seize
a huge share of that market.</TE>
<TE>   But the findings "are surprising," he said, adding that his
company's studies show that despite some quality issues with the
M-Class sport utility in the U.S., Mercedes-Benz still is "at the top
of the list" of brands that car buyers say they can trust.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Mercedes' anemic performance in its homeland could speak
volumes, especially as the German car brand did even worse in Power's
U.S. consumer satisfaction survey published earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   In that study, Mercedes-Benz -- which sells only luxury cars in
the U.S. -- finished below the industry average of 843 points. That
was the cutoff mark below which Power won't issue rankings.</TE>
<TE>   The German study showed "a wide gap exists between the vehicles
that give high levels of satisfaction to their owners and those that
do not, which implies that there is room for significant industry
improvement," Sargent said.</TE>
<TE>   That gap of 63 points between top finisher and industry average
was one point less than the gap Power found in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The German study also shows that in Germany, at least, it isn't
necessary to buy an expensive car to have a satisfying ownership
experience, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the U.S. study, in which nine of the top 10 vehicles were
luxury or near-luxury brands, a middle-of-the-road marque -- Saturn
-- finished first. GM's import fighter fared well largely on the
strength of customers' satisfaction with the dealerships.</TE>
<TE>   The leading brands in each of the four main areas of the German
customer satisfaction survey were Toyota for vehicle quality and
reliability; BMW for vehicle appeal; Toyota again for dealer service;
and Daihatsu for ownership cost.*</TE>

<HD>'Boom cars' get another hearing</HD>
<DH>Readers complain about excessively loud car sound systems,
but an audio industry executive defends them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeanne Wright</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A recent column on "boom cars" with mega-loud audio systems drew a
range of responses: from readers who want tougher noise law
enforcement to complaints from an audio industry executive who says
critics are unfairly maligning the boom culture.</LD>
<LD>   Bob Knotek, who lives in Los Angeles above the Sunset Strip, wrote
that he and his neighbors are "at our wits' end! The noise [from
these cars] vibrates our homes, scares our children, our animals and
causes anger, frustration and exhaustion."</LD>
<LD>   As a member of the Hollywood traffic committee and local Community
Police Advisory Board, Knotek said over the last few years he has
seen an increase in the number of vehicles cruising the Strip and
blasting high-decibel sounds from their stereos. Residents in the
community are seeking a tougher ordinance to combat the noise
pollution that Knotek said has made their lives a "living hell."</LD>
<TE>   But Ray Windsor, a vice president at Eclipse, a manufacturer of
car audio systems in Torrance and a subsidiary of Fujitsu Ten Corp.
of America, said high-powered car stereos are being unfairly
targeted.</TE>
<TE>   Automotive audio systems -- which can cost from $2,000 to more
than $50,000 -- certainly aren't the only sources of annoying noise,
Windsor said.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone talks about the bad boom cars. But what about cement
trucks, garbage trucks or motorcycles? They should also be subject to
penalties."</TE>
<TE>   Under California Vehicle Code Section 27007, it is illegal to have
an automotive sound system turned up so that it can be heard 50 feet
away. Violators face fines. In some areas, much stiffer penalties for
car noise violations can be imposed. In Chicago, for example, boom
car drivers risk having their vehicles towed and can be fined as much
as $615.</TE>
<TE>   Windsor, 46, said he is concerned that "perhaps the problem is
that the people who buy and use these car stereo products are almost
all young people and, I guess, quite a few are of minority descent."</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Peter Eliasberg echoed Windsor's concern about the
possibility of selective enforcement of the anti-noise code.</TE>
<TE>   "It would raise our antennas if only certain groups of people were
being swept up under the law," said Eliasberg, who works for the
American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Windsor, a director of the Mobile Electronics Retailers Assn.,
said he was offended by comments by law enforcement that police
sometimes find gang members using loud boom cars to make their
presence known. He has a boom car of his own and occasionally cranks
up the stereo. He said he hopes on those occasions the police don't
"confuse me with a gangbanger."</TE>
<TE>   Creating powerful sound systems is no different from manufacturing
automobiles that can reach speeds of 150 mph, Windsor said.</TE>
<TE>   And just as automakers don't advise people to drive their vehicles
that fast on the freeway, the audio industry doesn't recommend that
people turn up the volume to eardrum-shattering levels.</TE>
<TE>   Although most after-market audio systems can produce 130 decibels
of sound -- well above the 85-decibel limit at which hearing damage
can occur -- in theory the sky is the limit.</TE>
<TE>   Some car stereo enthusiasts load their vehicles with monster audio
equipment and compete in formal contests to determine who has the
loudest system. Those systems can hit or exceed 170 decibels, Windsor
said. He and others in the audio system industry wear ear plugs when
they attend these competitions to promote products, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Contestants don't sit inside their cars -- they stand outside and
wear sound-deadening headsets or ear plugs. Sound levels are so
dangerously high that they must be measured by a microphone placed
inside the vehicle. They can create so much pressure in a vehicle
that the windshield can blow out, Windsor said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the thought of what that could do to someone's eardrums
isn't pleasant, a shattered windshield is not a bad thing from a
marketing point of view, he acknowledges.</TE>
<TE>   Audio system manufacturers caution owners to listen safely, but
"certainly appreciate the idea that if a kid thinks [blowing out a
windshield] makes this brand really cool," he will want to buy it,
Windsor said.</TE>
<TE>   About 85% of car stereo buyers are young men, according to
industry surveys. For some, the audio system's power becomes an
identity issue. There's the "desire to be the biggest and baddest,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, a number of readers wrote in to ask how to report
offending car stereo noise.</TE>
<TE>   Police say the best method is not to approach the driver but to
note the vehicle's license number and contact the local police or
sheriff's department or, if the noise occurs in an area under the
California Highway Patrol's jurisdiction, the region's CHP office.</TE>

parents that it's Halloween.</DH>

<LD>The walk to the pumpkin patch lot was about a block away. I
remembered seeing signs about it a few days ago. When I got there,
though, all I could see were rocks and old, dry weeds. I was so
disappointed that I almost cried.</LD>
<LD>   After standing on the sidewalk for a minute, staring at the empty
lot, I turned around and ran back home. I wasn't giving up! I knew
there was a Halloween, and I would try one more time to prove it!</LD>
<LD>   I decided that I would still go trick-or-treating. I wouldn't tell
my parents anything except that I was going to take Casey out for a
walk.</LD>
<TE>   But first, I thought, I would call Timmy and clue him in on this
mystery. When he answered the phone, I said, "Timmy, something weird
is going on."</TE>
<TE>   "What?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Well," I told him, "at breakfast, my mom and dad said that they
had never even heard of Halloween! So I ran down the street to the
pumpkin lot. But there weren't any pumpkins there. It's really
strange. I can't figure it out!"</TE>
<TE>   Timmy waited a second and then said, "Jake, did you call up to
tell me a joke? Because if you did, I don't have time right now. I
have to get to school."</TE>
<TE>   "But Timmy, weren't you coming down to my house tonight to go
trick-or-treating with me?"</TE>
<TE>   "Jake, I have tons of homework tonight. I can't go anywhere with
you."</TE>
<TE>   "Homework? On Halloween?"</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, Jake, I've never, ever heard of Halloween or going
trick-or-treating, or anything like that. What in the world are you
talking about anyway?"</TE>
<TE>   "Never mind," I said sadly, "I'm really tired of trying to get
anyone to believe me!"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tomorrow: Halloween or else!</TE>

<HD>What he really thought</HD>
<DH>During his life, Cecil Beaton published six discreet
diaries. A new collection includes his nastier observations of the
rich and famous.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Whittle</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like his contemporary Noel Coward, Cecil Beaton was that peculiarly
British 20th century phenomenon, a man from relatively meager social
origins who utterly reinvented himself in the image of those he
aspired to. Rejecting his middle-class family's timber business, he
set about scaling the social heights of British high society in the
1920s.</LD>
<LD>   Throughout the next five decades, he maintained his position as
one of the most sought-after portrait and fashion photographers in
the world, and his pictures of Hollywood stars, artists, writers and
social leaders became classic images. Also in those years, he was a
prolific keeper of diaries.</LD>
<LD>   During his life, Beaton, who died in 1980 at 76, published six
discreetly self-censored volumes of them.</LD>
<TE>   It is only now, with the publication in the United Kingdom of "The
Unexpurgated Beaton" (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicholson), that the public can
read some of the less flattering portraits of the glitterati with
whom he mixed. Edited by Beaton biographer Hugo Vickers, the new book
covers the last decade of his life, when he remained as active and
involved as ever with the social, arts and show-biz scenes around
him.</TE>
<TE>   Although he was an avid admirer of those who, like him, had
reached the top of their field, the new book reveals that far from
being star-struck, the photographer could be ruthless in his
judgments of his rich and famous subjects, from Elizabeth Taylor's
skin to Salvador Dali's bad breath.</TE>
<TE>   Photographing Elizabeth Taylor at a grand ball for Vogue in 1969,
he wrote: "Her breasts, hanging and huge, were like those of a
peasant woman sucking her young in Peru. They were seen in full
shape, blotched and mauve, plum ... on her fat, coarse hands more of
the biggest diamonds and emeralds.... In comparison everyone else
looked ladylike.'</TE>
<TE>   That same year, working in New York on a new musical about Coco
Chanel, he had this to say about its star, Katharine Hepburn:</TE>
<TE>   "That beautiful bone structure of cheekbone, nose and chin goes
for nothing in its surrounding flesh of the New England shopkeeper.
She has no generosity, no heart, no grace."</TE>
<TE>   He was even more scathing about the erstwhile Hollywood sex
goddess Mae West, whom he photographed for the release of her movie
"Myra Breckinridge" in 1971.</TE>
<TE>   "She could hardly be considered human," he wrote in his diary.</TE>
<TE>   "The neck, cheeks and shoulders were hidden beneath a peroxide
wig. The muzzle, which was all one could see of the face, with the
pretty capped teeth, was like that of a nice little ape."</TE>
<TE>   Beaton's friendship with England's royals didn't spare them his
sharp tongue.</TE>
<TE>   He wrote of an occasion when he came across Princess Margaret at a
party: "Gosh the shock! The flesh is solid and I don't think dieting
can reduce a marble statue."</TE>
<TE>   At another event, he describes the Duchess of Windsor -- the
American Wallis Simpson -- as behaving "like a mad Goya. She is more
than ever a personality and character, but God, what she looks like,
her face so pulled up that her mouth stretches from ear to ear."</TE>

<HD>Winning the war, one frame at a time</HD>
<DH>During World War II, the First Motion Picture Unit used all
the skills of Hollywood to recruit enlistees and train troops. Sixty
years later, it is honored.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patricia Ward Biederman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eighty-three-year-old Stanley Frazen knows how he would start a book
on World War II and the First Motion Picture Unit of the Army Air
Forces: "The Celluloid Commandos advanced three frames today.... "</LD>
<LD>   Frazen, whose unit recruited Hollywood stars and other filmmakers
to make movies with a patriotic purpose, served his country doing
what he did best: cutting film.</LD>
<LD>   The most glamorous man in the unit may have been personnel officer
and later adjutant Ronald Reagan. The rising star and future
president once described the unit's remarkable concentration of
gifted directors, cinematographers and other moviemakers as "$200
million worth of talent on the hoof."</LD>
<TE>   Heartthrobs Clark Gable, Alan Ladd, William Holden and George
Montgomery served in the unit. Future bestselling novelist Irving
Wallace was a writer and celebrity photographer George Hurrell
changed his focus from glamour shots of Rita Hayworth to close-ups of
P-38s. Directors included William Wyler, who made the legendary
documentary "The Memphis Belle."</TE>
<TE>   Frazen and 50 other veterans of the First Motion Picture Unit will
be honored on its 60th anniversary with a dinner tonight in the
executive dining room at Warner Bros., where the Celluloid Commandos
began with the aid of Lt. Col. Jack Warner.</TE>
<TE>   "They're part of our history and our legacy," said Gary Credle, an
executive vice president at Warner Bros. "They were here before we
were, and we are very proud of them.... Hollywood had a lot to do
with the war effort, and these are the guys who did it."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the men will be feted at the Ronald Reagan
Presidential Library near Simi Valley. Whether the movies they made
were about firebombs or how to give first aid to a downed crew,
members of the unit used all their skill to make good pictures,
survivors say.</TE>
<TE>   In 1942, Pvt. Hal Levy boasted in the unit magazine about their
first official effort, "Learn and Live," a "Green Pastures"-style
spectacle set in heaven: "The training film is being reborn; it is
going to assume 'box office' aspects. It's going to have production
values. And these production values will pay dividends in lives
saved."</TE>
<TE>   Unit members say they were unaware of how brilliantly the Nazis
were using film to advance anti-Semitism and German expansion. But
the men at Ft. Roach -- the Hal Roach Studios in Culver City where
the unit made most of its 300 training and propaganda films --
understood the power of movies as only those who made them could.</TE>
<TE>   Desperate in 1942 for 100,000 more fliers, the Army Air Corps
asked Warner to make a short film called "Winning Your Wings,"
starring actor-aviator Jimmy Stewart. When the movie was screened,
150,000 would-be airmen signed up. A few of the unit's films were
memorable in their own right, among them "Three Cadets," the "Gone
With the Wind" of venereal-disease prevention movies. In a 1991
interview, now in the research collection of the Motion Picture
Academy, writer-director Richard Goldstone explained why the Air
Force felt it had to make its own VD film.</TE>
<TE>   Air cadets who contracted a sexually transmitted disease were
supposed to report to sick bay for treatment. But if they did, they
were yanked out of training and couldn't graduate with their classes.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, cadets who thought they were infected would use sulfa
drugs to treat themselves. The catch was that pilots who had sulfa in
their bloodstreams and flew higher than 10,000 feet often lost their
hand-eye coordination and crashed their planes. The movie shows the
fates of a cadet who used a condom, one who didn't but goes to sick
bay, and one who takes sulfa on the sly and crashes his plane.</TE>
<TE>   The chaplain general wanted the movie shelved because none of the
cadets was punished. But First Motion Picture Unit founder Gen. Henry
H. "Hap" Arnold pointed out that the Air Force saved $30,000 for
every plane that didn't crash.</TE>
<TE>   Frazen worked on one of the unit's best films, "Resisting Enemy
Interrogation." Nominated for an Academy Award in 1944, the movie is
described this way in an online film catalog: "crackling with
razor-sharp dialogue and noirish atmosphere, [the film] shows what
happens when American airmen, their plane shot down over Germany, are
handed over to an ace Nazi interrogation unit."</TE>
<TE>   In an oral history in the Motion Picture Academy's collection,
Owen Crump, who ran the military film studio, said that the movie was
realistic because two advisors had been captured by the Germans. The
Celluloid Commandos meticulously dressed the set to look like the
chateau where the fliers had been questioned.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Crump met two young men who had seen "Resisting
Enemy Interrogation" as part of their training. The fliers told Crump
that they too had been shot down and taken to the chateau to be
grilled, only to look at one another and realize that they had seen
this movie.</TE>
<TE>   The men who made the film received letters of thanks from
President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Later, stunned members of the unit
were among the first to see footage of the Nazi death camps.</TE>
<TE>   The unit had a superb animation department headed by Rudolf Ising,
co-creator of Warner Bros.' "Looney Tunes" and "Merrie Melodies." The
department included Frank Thomas, later one of Disney's legendary
Nine Old Men, and independent animator John Hubley.</TE>
<TE>   They dreamed up characters like Mr. Chameleon to teach the
principles of camouflage and used animation to instill key points in
viewers' minds. When the narrator of "Identification of the Japanese
Zero" says the plane's fuselage looks like a big cigar, the fuselage
turns into a giant animated stogie.</TE>
<TE>   The unit's special effects men made models of Japan that were used
to secretly brief the men who bombed the islands at the end of the
war. They "flew" cameras over the meticulously researched models,
giving the B-29 crews a bird's-eye view of what their targets looked
like from 30,000 feet. Reagan ended the filmed briefings with "Bombs
away!"</TE>
<TE>   "Most of us realized how lucky we were to be in the unit," Frazen
said.</TE>
<TE>   Another unit veteran, Arnold Laven, 80, started at Warner Bros. as
a messenger and became a unit script supervisor. Laven credits his
experience with launching his career as a film and television
director.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think any school in America could match the education I
got in three years in the unit," said Laven, who lives in Encino.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no facet of the business that wasn't available." Steve
Hanson, who heads the USC Cinema-Television Library, interviewed
several First Motion Picture Unit veterans in 1989. He said they were
stung by the perception that they had done little during the war but
get their spiffy uniforms made to order.</TE>
<TE>   Hanson said he believes the unit made a contribution by preparing
airmen for all that the war threw at them: "I think it probably saved
a lot of lives."</TE>
<TE>   The unit also trained combat cameramen, many of whom died shooting
footage. That filmmakers helped win the war was acknowledged by an
unlikely source, German Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel.</TE>
<TE>   At the surrender, he said: "We had everything calculated perfectly
except the speed with which the Allies were able to train their
people for war. Our major miscalculation was in underestimating their
quick and complete mastery of film education."</TE>
<TE>   The First Motion Picture Unit also helped document the epic story
of the "Greatest Generation."</TE>
<TE>   Historian John Langellier, assistant director and chief curator of
the Reagan library, said of the unit: "Every time you flip on the
History Channel or the Discovery Channel, and you see World War II
from an American perspective, you're watching the work of one of
these gentlemen. That's their legacy."</TE>

<HD>Getting the creeps from half-told tale</HD>
<DH>The Holy: Novel; By Daniel Quinn; Context Books: 414 pages,
$25</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Cariaga</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Holy," the latest novel by Daniel Quinn ("Ishmael"), centers on
an unwilling, semiretired detective who has become involved in a tale
of metaphysical sleuthing. The search for information on otherworldly
beings and for a middle-age man who has seemingly dropped out of life
takes Chicago detective Howard Scheim across the Midwest to Las Vegas
and finally to Taos, N.M., where the climax of the mystery takes
place at a mountaintop retreat. But the book's unfolding plot keeps
the reader off guard and often irritated by half-revealed clues.
Until the climax, and in fact until the novel starts winding down
around the 400th page, all is cloudy, vague, inconclusive and
frustrating.</LD>
<LD>   A rich patron and friend of Scheim's, Aaron Fischer, asks the
part-time private investigator to take on the question of aliens in
our midst: nonhumans who have been present in this world since before
the ascent of humankind, beings variously identified over the ages as
spirits, gods and demons.</LD>
<LD>   Not by coincidence, it turns out, Scheim's early failures to enter
into the world of these beings changes when his life meshes with that
of the dropout, David Kennesey. After years of middle-class monotony
in the educational publishing business, Kennesey suddenly decides to
leave his wife and 12-year-old son and embarks on a westward journey
by car.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the detective, having put a foot into arcane waters --
he has visited devil-worshipers, talked to psychics, interviewed
Talmudic scholars and gotten no closer to firsthand knowledge -- is
soon surrounded by the beings he seeks. But he doesn't realize it at
first.</TE>
<TE>   Then, as if by chance, Scheim finds himself on the trail of
Kennesey, along with Kennesey's son, Tim, who has been searching for
his father. They go to Las Vegas, where Kennesey has made a
phenomenal win at poker and has again disappeared. They follow his
trail to a home in Taos, which Kennesey has already left. There they
find an Addams family of others--call them what you will, they are
the ones who call the shots in this tale the publisher describes as a
"metaphysical thriller."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps. The occupants of the New Mexico aerie certainly pass
colorful lives, though they seem to operate without a moral compass
and in a zone of daily activity ungoverned by time. There are no
clocks in this world.</TE>
<TE>   Altogether, this is not a happy story, even though there are only
a few fatalities by the end. The creepiness one feels comes not from
the subject matter but from the vagueness and muddy waters of the
writing. The people are not fully described, the settings could be
more vividly drawn, details are often sketchy and too many chapters
end with a contrived surprise. Nonetheless, the story more or less
holds the reader, and the material on Jewish mysticism is compelling.</TE>

<HD>'The Osbournes' to return in November</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Brownfield</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Having scored lucrative book and DVD deals, and dealt with the
illness of family matriarch Sharon, MTV's "The Osbournes" will return
for a new season of episodes Nov. 26, the cable network announced
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   At its height last season, which ended in May, "The Osbournes"
averaged more than 7 million viewers, becoming the highest-rated
series in MTV's history. The first of 10 new episodes will debut at
10:30 p.m. Nov. 26.</LD>
<LD>   Filmed as a kind of unscripted home-movie-meets-family-sitcom, and
set in the misfit family's Beverly Hills home, "The Osbournes"
quickly touched off a media frenzy and sent rival cable and broadcast
networks into meetings with other B- and C-list stars who might make
entertaining guinea pigs on staged reality series.</LD>
<TE>   The Osbournes include Father Ozzy, the muttering heavy metal king;
Sharon, the tough-minded wife and mother; teenage son Jack and
teenage daughter Kelly, neither of whom exactly recall Bud and
Princess on "Father Knows Best."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to being entertaining TV characters, Sharon and Ozzie
proved to be shrewd, if eccentric, negotiators when it came time to
renew the series and discuss ancillary revenue streams like home
video and DVD. Last spring, MTV ordered another 20 episodes of "The
Osbournes," and after other deals closed, the family had parlayed
their popularity into a cottage industry worth millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it was a difficult summer for the family. Sharon Osbourne
underwent surgery for colon cancer and later chemotherapy treatments.
It is unclear how much of the new season will deal with her health
problems.</TE>
<TE>   "This season the show takes on a whole new meaning as we share the
highs and the lows of the last six months with our viewers," Sharon
Osbourne said in an MTV press release.</TE>
<TE>   Whether "The Osbournes" can duplicate its popularity remains to be
seen, though MTV still has the Osbournes signed for another 10
episodes after the upcoming run.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, copycat shows have sprung up, including "The Anna
Nicole Show" on E! Entertainment Television; an at-home show
featuring Liza Minnelli and husband David Gest; and a new show, "The
Surreal Life," six episodes of which the WB recently ordered. That
show features seven celebrities of various vintage (MC Hammer,
Emmanuel Lewis) sharing a house.</TE>

<HD>New set, 1st serve</HD>
<DH>Serena Williams tries to break into show-biz with a role on
'My Wife and Kids.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Dillman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not only did Serena Williams play her way to the No. 1 ranking on the
women's tennis tour, but she got there by beating her older sister
Venus four times this year, including three Grand Slam tournaments.</LD>
<LD>   That was the easy part. Now Williams wants to break into show biz.</LD>
<LD>   Which is what brought the spotlight-seeking 21-year-old to a
soundstage on the Disney Studios lot in Burbank two weeks ago. Away
from center court, and trading in the straightforward one-on-one
matchup of professional tennis for the collaborative, sometimes
chaotic nature of network TV, she was filming a scene in ABC's comedy
"My Wife and Kids."</LD>
<TE>   Williams plays a kindergarten teacher on the "Crouching Mother,
Hidden Father" episode airing tonight, in which she verbally spars
with series co-star Tisha Campbell-Martin's character, accusing her
of being too strict with children in a school play. The show's star,
Damon Wayans, plays the man in the middle, trying to keep the peace.</TE>
<TE>   The novice actress even showed off a bit of the improvisation
skill that she developed as a tennis player. As she delivered her
line, "I'm not looking for a fight," Williams did something that
wasn't in the script: She started to remove her earrings and high
heels.</TE>
<TE>   Of course. What sane woman is going to enter a battle wearing
earrings?</TE>
<TE>   "It was something she threw in there," Campbell-Martin said,
"[She] threw a little realism into it. I liked it. I liked working
with her."</TE>
<TE>   Williams will need all the breaks and all the support she can get.
Athletes who try to break into show business nearly always find
excelling at a sport is one thing, making it in Hollywood is
something else altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, some make the transition, such as Los Angeles Rams defensive
end Fred Dryer who went on to star in the "Hunter" TV series and
movies. But for the most part the entertainment industry is littered
with the dashed hopes of aspiring actors who've tried to transfer
success on the playing field to the movie or TV screen. Think
basketball stars Shaquille O'Neal ("Kazaam") and Michael Jordan
("Space Jam"); think swimmer Mark Spitz (as a TV announcer in the
1985 TV movie "Challenge of a Lifetime"), think football players like
Jim Brown ("The Dirty Dozen") or Fred "The Hammer" Williamson
("MASH"). Better yet, don't think of them.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Williams insists her interest in acting is more than a
passing whim. She says she's been acting since she and her equally
acclaimed sister were young girls, making noise in the tennis world,
and starring in mini plays that Venus wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never considered tennis as my only outlet," she said. "I've
always liked doing different things when I was younger. I just never
really liked focusing on tennis. I do see myself as a crossover."</TE>
<TE>   She has been working with a couple of acting coaches, signed with
agent Jill Smoller at the William Morris Agency, which also
represents Wayans, had a meeting with a network president (CBS' Les
Moonves) and found a place to live part-time in Southern California,
since the Williams family pulled up stakes from Compton more than a
decade ago and moved to Florida.</TE>
<TE>   And there's her attraction to the limelight. Consider the media
frenzy she generated at the U.S. Open in September, when she showed
up in a body-hugging black cat suit. At least for a moment, cameras
shifted off of cover girls like Anna Kournikova.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't to say tennis is being pushed away. Williams is still
trying to win a final title of 2002, the season-ending WTA
Championships, which starts next week at Staples Center. After that,
comes the pursuit of the Grand Slam, which would be winning all four
major tournaments -- the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon
and the U.S. Open -- in the same calendar year.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had lots of opportunities. It's just that other career that
I have, that other small career that's putting a hindrance on my
acting," she said, smiling.</TE>
<TE>   That's typical of Williams' trademark sense of humor. Call it ego
with a wink.</TE>
<TE>   She once came to a tournament and joked that her new home was
going to have plenty of mirrors so she could look at herself. "Just
trying to get my daily dose of me," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's her shot at tennis star and failed game-show host
John McEnroe ("The Chair"), who has not always had the kindest words
for the Williams sisters. She was once at a lounge in Staples Center
and told the story of how she and Venus had years earlier played the
warmup for a Jimmy Connors-McEnroe match at the Forum. It was
mentioned that it was somehow poetic that McEnroe-Boris Becker was
the preliminary for her final against Venus at the U.S. Open in
September.</TE>
<TE>   "Who?" Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   She couldn't help herself and started laughing. After all, who is
McEnroe, anyway, when you've been hanging out on the set with Damon
Wayans all day? The cast and crew were supportive of the newcomer and
the on-set acting coach Richard Lyons said Serena was so natural in
rehearsals that she was given more lines.</TE>
<TE>   "That doesn't happen a lot. If anything, you get your lines taken
away from you," Lyons said.</TE>
<TE>   "She had never done it before and as the takes went by and the
days went by, she got looser and started to have a lot more fun with
it," executive producer Don Reo said. "I guess it's like everything,
acting and performing is like tennis. You have to practice it. The
more you do it, the better you get at it. That's what she'd have to
do, like everybody else.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to bring her back and have her play tennis, but lose.
She thought it was funny but said she'd have to play left-handed."</TE>
<TE>   Wayans, meanwhile, was able to help by drawing on Williams'
athletic experience, telling her how to respond to Campbell-Martin's
character.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me that acting is like you can relate it to tennis. You
react to what she says," Williams said. 'You kind of act and react.
He said, 'Like when you're on the court, you're reacting to her.'
That's how it has to be. You just have to keep reacting.</TE>
<TE>   "I did the last take after he told me that advice and I think that
was my best take yet."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, at least one of her lines on the show harkened back to
her experiences on the women's tour, noted for its off-court
jealousies, cliques, ever-shifting alliances and meddling mothers and
fathers.</TE>
<TE>   "That's OK," she reassures Wayans and Campbell-Martin, "I'm used
to dealing with children."</TE>

<LD>OUT the door we go on this autumn weekend, the holidays already in
full gear. In case you haven't noticed, the holidays now start with
the World Series and end with the Super Bowl. That's right, four
magic months.</LD>
<LD>   "Daddy?" the little girl asks.</LD>
<LD>   "Yes?"</LD>
<TE>   "What's your favorite part of Thanksgiving?"</TE>
<TE>   "The wine," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the turkey," says the little girl.</TE>
<TE>   "Suit yourself," I say.</TE>
<TE>   On this Saturday morning, I'm taking a bunch of kids to a
Halloween festival, where I browse the silent auction and pass the
time talking to my buddy Glynn. Great guy, Glynn. Find him at a lunch
table, inhaling a hot dog.</TE>
<TE>   "We play touch football now," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "When?"</TE>
<TE>   "Every Sunday," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "See that dad over there?" he says.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure."</TE>
<TE>   "Played linebacker for Arizona."</TE>
<TE>   Then on to the little girl's soccer game we go, at a mere 3 mph
over the speed limit. Earlier in the week, I received notice that
there's a warrant out for my arrest. Yep, a warrant, over a boating
ticket I received last summer. Should've cleared it up quickly.
Tucked it away in a desk and forgot.</TE>
<TE>   "Your failure to promptly post bail may result in your arrest
and/or the imposition of additional penalties by the court," the
letter says.</TE>
<TE>   Martha Stewart is still free and terrorizing the nation, and
they're coming after me over this little boating ticket. Me, a guy
who worships football and Bruce Springsteen. A guy who calls his mom
every week. Heck, I don't even own a handgun.</TE>
<TE>   "Dad?" says a voice from the back seat.</TE>
<TE>   "What now?"</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to be late," the little girl says.</TE>
<TE>   I stop at all stop signs. I signal at all turns. There is nothing
new about this, except that I take each action twice. There's a
warrant out for my arrest. Just my luck I'd get pulled over for
something stupid and the warrant would turn up.</TE>
<TE>   "What's the problem, officer?" I'd ask.</TE>
<TE>   "You just did something stupid," the traffic cop would say.</TE>
<TE>   When doing something stupid can land a guy in jail, no one is
safe. Especially me.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to be late," the little girl mutters again.</TE>
<TE>   Like most fugitives, I stay on the move. We dart between pumpkin
festivals and soccer fields. Liquor stores and dry cleaners. In the
evening, we attend a couples' baby shower. Who'd look for a fugitive
there?</TE>
<TE>   At the shower, I forget about being on the run. We watch Game 6
and nearly scream the roof off of Pete and Linda's nice home. It
seems pretty well made, this place. But during that big 7th inning, I
swear the ceiling lifted several inches. And when Glaus doubled in
the 8th, I swear it took 10 years off their house.</TE>
<TE>   "Are all baby showers like this?" I ask.</TE>
<TE>   "God, what a game," Gary says.</TE>
<TE>   "You need another beer," says Hank.</TE>
<TE>   A couples' baby shower. Thought you'd never find me there, did
you? Neither did my wife, who broached the idea a month before.</TE>
<TE>   "What would you think about a couples' shower?" she asked, warily.</TE>
<TE>   "I like when couples shower," I answered.</TE>
<TE>   "That wasn't the question," she said.</TE>
<TE>   I would never try to romanticize this situation. I know what a
baby can do. I know what a baby is capable of. They grow to be kids,
then teenagers. It's nothing to be taken lightly, childbirth.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, a shower would be great," I finally say.</TE>
<TE>   My lovely wife looks at me the way she often looks at me. As if
examining a strange bug that has crawled across the window pane. She
leans in close. She squints a little.</TE>
<TE>   Ever get that look? A look that says maybe her girlfriends were
right about you back in 1982? That maybe she should've listened?</TE>
<TE>   "You sure?" she says, surprised and confused by such an easy
victory.</TE>
<TE>   This unplanned pregnancy has affected us both in strange ways.
When she runs into people she hasn't seen for a while--her belly out
to there, draped like a couch in storage--they are amazed and excited
for her.</TE>
<TE>   She seems so happy and content, they just assume she has
remarried.</TE>
<TE>   "Is he a different father?" they ask.</TE>
<TE>   "In some ways, yes," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Some ways better, some ways worse.</TE>

<LD>Tessa Souter is not a name that is likely to ring any familiar bells.
Not at the moment, that is. But the impressive performance by the
Afro-British Caribbean jazz singer at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill on Monday
night suggested that her relative obscurity may be about to end.</LD>
<LD>   Gracefully commanding stage center, with guitarist Larry Koonse at
her right, bassist Jeff Littleton and drummer Kendall Kay on her
left, the slender, dark-haired Souter offered one of the most
imaginatively programmed vocal sets of recent memory. Starting with a
brief but steamy "Lazy Afternoon," she embarked on a musical journey
that took her from Freddie Hubbard's "Little Sunflower" and Sting's
"Fragile" through Joaquin Rodrigo's "Concierto de Aranjuez," John
Coltrane's "Wise One" and Billie Holiday's "Left Alone" before
winding up with Leon Thomas' "The Creator Has a Master Plan" and a
climactic "Caravan."</LD>
<LD>   Along the way, Souter provided many of her own lyrics -- for
"Little Sunflower," the "Concierto," "Wise One" and Pat Martino's
"Willow," among others -- and added an attractive tune of her own,
"You Don't Have to Believe."</LD>
<TE>   That would be an extraordinarily full plate for a well-established
singer, let alone one who -- mystifyingly -- has not yet been signed
to a recording contract. Although Souter is still a bit rough around
the edges, her sights were set so high that it was hard to be
bothered by her occasional small lapses in pitch or accent. When she
was good -- which was most of the time -- she was very good indeed,
using her pliable, lush-toned voice at the service of often difficult
melody lines. Comfortable with musical paraphrase, harmonically
adept, she freely varied her phrases while remaining firmly in touch
with the words and the meanings of her songs' lyrics.</TE>
<TE>   Souter, whose musical sophistication gives her a significant
advantage in the competitive clamor surrounding the current world of
ambitious female jazz vocal artists, also has a rare quality of
authenticity. Unlike many of her contemporaries, she seems more
focused on exploring the limitless creativity of the art than simply
having another go at the Great American Songbook. It remains to be
seen whether the jazz record business, in its infinite confusion
between art and commerce, can find a place for such an imaginative
quest.</TE>

<HD>Eminem's soundtrack owns the moment</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Hilburn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rap fans can relax -- Eminem hasn't pulled an Elvis.</LD>
<LD>   The smoldering rapper's movie "8 Mile" won't hit theaters until
Nov. 8, but it's clear from the just-released soundtrack that Eminem
and director Curtis Hanson haven't made the embarrassing commercial
compromises that left Presley's film career forever tarnished.</LD>
<LD>   The film is a semi-autobographical tale of a troubled young man's
desperate struggle to achieve his dreams for a rap career.</LD>
<TE>   The movie and album could easily have been loaded with old Eminem
hits or a few new tunes in the lighthearted, pop-friendly vein of the
rapper's sometime alter ego, Slim Shady. Instead, the tone of the
album is stark, gritty and hard core.</TE>
<TE>   "Lose Yourself," the opening track, defines the film's theme of
finding the courage to seize the moment that can make a difference,
and it has the feel of a pop culture anthem.</TE>
<TE>   Blessed with much of the same authority and power of such earlier
Eminem gems as "Stan" and "Cleaning Out My Closet," "Lose Yourself"
is already a radio hit. It's such an adrenaline rush that we're
likely to hear the chorus in sports venues around the country as home
teams try to psych themselves up.</TE>
<TE>   Besides featuring Eminem prominently on three other tracks, the
collection also includes contributions by Nas, Xzibit, 50 Cent, Gang
Starr and Jay-Z featuring Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the tunes deal with self-affirmation in the rap game, and
the language is frequently R-rated, so parents should take the
advisory seriously.</TE>
<TE>   The CD, released Tuesday by Shady/Interscope, doesn't have the
same emotional range or creative explosiveness of regular Eminem
albums, but it is a superior hip-hop package, and a sign that there's
no "Harum Scarum" in this pop star's future.</TE>

<HD>Plants with an appetite clamp down on prey</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In horror movies, carnivorous plants are people-eating monsters. But
in real life, these "plants of prey" only trap insects and other
small animals. But why do they do this? Because the wetland soils in
which they grow lack some of the nutrients they need to survive.
Insects are able to supply these nutrients.</LD>
<LD>   The Venus' flytrap is probably the best-known species of
carnivorous plant. It has leaves with spiky edges that snap shut on
its prey. Flies and other insects are attracted to the bright color
at the center of the trap or by its scent. When an insect lands on
the plant to look for a meal, it touches some of the hairs on the
plant's leaf. This triggers the leaf to close for several days while
the soft parts of the insect are digested.</LD>
<LD>   Another carnivorous plant is the pitcher plant, so named because
it looks like a jug or a water pitcher. When an insect lands on its
slippery leaf to drink nectar, it slides down the inside of the plant
and falls into liquid at the bottom. The insect cannot fly with wet
wings and cannot climb out because hairs on the sides of the plant
point downward, forcing it down. It becomes trapped and is digested
by the plant.</LD>
<TE>   You can buy carnivorous plants at local nurseries. Be warned,
though. They are difficult to grow. These plants are very sensitive
to their environment and will miss their boggy tropical homes. Be
sure to only water them with distilled water because tap water will
kill your carnivorous friends. And don't feed them hamburger -- they
prefer a low-fat diet. In fact, you don't have to worry about feeding
them at all; simply put them outside in the shade and they will
attract prey.</TE>

<HD>For actors switching screens, artistry is measured in
dollars</HD>
<DH>Actors, as anyone who reads People magazine can attest,
need to grow and be challenged and face new horizons, blah blah blah
blah blah.</DH>

<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even so, there are several recurring mysteries in the world of
entertainment, among them why people leave good television shows to
make bad movies.</LD>
<LD>   The latest poster child would be Julianna Margulies, the
Emmy-winning "ER" star currently appearing in "Ghost Ship," in which
she plays a salvage team leader whose crew happens upon a haunted
boat.</LD>
<LD>   The timed-for-Halloween release grossed a respectable $11.5
million over the weekend, finishing third at the box office, but the
critics were not kind. The Times' Manohla Dargis observed that the
actors are not "called on to do much, and all comply accordingly."
Daily Variety suggested that however the film opens, "word of mouth
will ensure a short theatrical voyage."</LD>
<TE>   Without venturing too far out on a limb, it seems safe to say the
film doesn't measure up to "ER," from which Margulies checked out in
2000 -- saying she felt her character had gone as far as she could
and that she wanted to explore different roles -- despite a
$27-million offer to stick around for three more seasons.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't meant to pick on Margulies, since any number of TV
series regulars, sailing the choppy seas of the multiplex, have
learned the hard way not to quit their day jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Faulstich, a bright fellow who runs his own literary agency,
captured this phenomenon some time ago in a missive to friends that
he called his "Ten Commandments of Hollywood." Although not limited
to actors, Faulstich's sixth commandment astutely observed, "The best
job you'll ever do is the one just before the job you've always
wanted."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, for actors who abandon hit TV shows, they will
likely never have it as good again, commercially or creatively, as
they did on that one success.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Allen, who headlined one of TV's biggest hits of the 1990s in
"Home Improvement," provides another timely reminder. The comic's
uneven feature flight path comes full circle with this weekend's
release of "The Santa Clause 2," a sequel to Allen's biggest
live-action hit, which happened to debut when his TV series was at
the height of its popularity.</TE>
<TE>   Consider too the cast of "Friends," as the world waits
breathlessly to see if the six stars will grant NBC a stay of
execution and agree to another season. No such suspense surrounds the
prospect of sequels to their mostly forgettable roster of films, the
latest being the Matthew Perry vehicle "Serving Sara," which exited
theaters with all the speed of a Barry Bonds homer.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Sherry Stringfield has since returned to "ER," proving
that in television, you can go home again. Ditto for David Caruso,
who acrimoniously left "NYPD Blue" early in the second season, made
the refund-worthy films "Kiss of Death" and "Jade," then survived a
short-lived TV show before finding renewed life in "CSI: Miami."</TE>
<TE>   "I mishandled the 'NYPD Blue' situation quite handily," Caruso
conceded to reporters in July, sounding grateful to be back on
television. During the intervening years, he added, "I've had a
number of opportunities ... to grow up and realize what has been
provided for me."</TE>
<TE>   Not that feature film pedigrees ensure triumph on the small
screen. Director Michael Mann, for example, whose credits include
"Ali" and "The Insider," has found capturing viewers Friday nights to
be considerably more difficult now -- as the mastermind of CBS'
ratings-challenged new drama "Robbery Homicide Division" -- than it
was when he produced "Miami Vice" in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, plenty of stars have deftly used television as a
springboard to movies and enjoyed considerable success on one level
or another, from John Travolta, Tom Hanks and Bruce Willis to Will
Smith, Jim Carrey and Adam Sandler.</TE>
<TE>   The galling aspect of this transition in recent years, however, is
actors' obligatory insistence that jumping to movies is about
creative growth and commitment to craft, not money. Because if you
inject truth serum into their agents or managers, with a few rare
exceptions (Margulies did walk away from a major payday), it's almost
always about money.</TE>
<TE>   Put simply, films generally pay more and ask performers to work
less -- the kind of math even a cynical columnist could appreciate,
despite the obvious hardship that reducing my workload would inflict
on adoring readers.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, no one needs to apologize for wanting to earn more
working less, but let's not cloak a rational business or life
decision under the mantra of artistic fulfillment. Kudos to Smith for
making a splash in movies since leaving "The Fresh Prince of
Bel-Air," but it's hard to argue that mediocre films like "Men in
Black II" and "The Wild, Wild West" are so much more creatively
rewarding.</TE>
<TE>   Charlie Hauck, whose credits range from "Maude" to "Home
Improvement," succinctly explained TV's inferiority complex vis-a-vis
movies a few years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Features are bigger. It's a big screen. They win," Hauck said.
"In terms of what's on television versus what's in feature films,
television can hold its head proudly -- even hold its head above."</TE>
<TE>   This is especially true if you compare the quality level of many
current prime-time dramas against the films in which many former TV
stars have found refuge, as mainstream filmmaking increasingly
succumbs to a blockbuster mentality that places more emphasis on
explosions than on dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   Again, you can hardly blame TV actors for wanting to be "movie
stars" in the larger-than-life sense of the term, with all the
attendant perks. It's only when they cite a dedication to artistry as
the reason that they at best sound disingenuous and at worst evoke
the image of being unable to hold their heads up strictly because of
the oversized chips on their shoulders.</TE>

<LD>On Halloween night, some 30 million viewers of CBS' stylish forensic
science series "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" will watch actor Jon
Sklaroff go off into television's great beyond.</LD>
<LD>   Which brought him to the show's stages at Santa Clarita Studios a
few weeks ago for a nearly four-hour session with makeup artists John
Goodwin and Jackie Tichenor. As his rugged features gradually
disappeared under layers of ersatz charred flesh, Sklaroff could
glance up at bulletin board snapshots of many who had gone before.</LD>
<LD>   There was Nancy Yoon, playing a girl with drop-dead looks and a
throat that somebody opened with a corkscrew. Rachel Shumate as a
cheerleader disemboweled and wolfed down by drug-crazed companions.
Tricia Helfer, a troubled teen who cut up her own face. In the
snapshots, they all cheerfully show off their gruesome wounds.</LD>
<TE>   Done to a crisp, Sklaroff walked stiffly to the set's autopsy lab.
He lay there for two hours, not moving, in a painful U-shaped neck
brace designed to keep dead bodies in place, while series star
William Petersen and co-star Robert David Hall worked him over as
they ruminated on the characteristics of flame-seared lungs.</TE>
<TE>   "CSI," in its third season, has ushered in a prime-time era when
death rarely takes a holiday. As ratings soar for medical-detective
and black-comedy thrillers, the demand grows for edgier sequences
littered with corpses. Burdens grow for producers, visual effects
artists and network censors, not to mention the actors playing
characters vividly depicted in the Reaper's icy, gruesome grip.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never had to put on any makeup like that. It was tougher
than acting," Sklaroff said the day after his autopsy scene, nursing
a stiff neck and peeling bits of glue off his skin.</TE>
<TE>   With a growing list of Hollywood action credits and aspiring to
roles that, he said, might have fit a young Harry Dean Stanton,
Sklaroff has been shot several times, gulped by a crocodile and
barely survived a traffic accident on "ER." But he's not sure he
would ever again endure a fiery demise and autopsy.</TE>
<TE>   "People were taking my picture all day, like I was in a sideshow.
They were looking at me, turning me around, poking me. It was a
little humiliating," Sklaroff said. "But the crew and cast were all
so nice and [it] was such a nice set it didn't matter that I had a
moment of humility."</TE>
<TE>   Death in all its gritty realism is big on "CSI," which offers an
unflinching look at a team of gumshoes doggedly sniffing out whatever
microscopia it takes to snare a miscreant.</TE>
<TE>   "When a forensic show comes along that has to be correct in terms
of forensic science then it's important to feature the body up
close," said "CSI" creator and executive producer Anthony E. Zuiker.</TE>
<TE>   After all, there's nothing like a good victim to win over the
audience. And, Zuiker added, "it's not just anybody off the street
who can act dead."</TE>
<TE>   Tim Kring, executive producer of NBC's second-season medical
examiner drama "Crossing Jordan," said he asks actors at casting
sessions to show him the Big Sleep.</TE>
<TE>   "Some can't do it. They twitch, or you can see them breathing,"
Kring said. "But some are very good. You can pry their eyelids open
for close-ups and get a blank stare."</TE>
<TE>   The trick is total relaxation, said Danny Cannon, who directed
Sklaroff's episode, a thriller involving a magician titled "Abra
Cadaver."</TE>
<TE>   "Holding your breath doesn't work," Cannon said. "You get starved
for oxygen and your veins throb. But if you shallow-breathe down in
the diaphragm, then we don't see it."</TE>
<TE>   Real bodies are customary in TV productions rather than realistic
dummies favored by movie crews as a simple matter of economics, said
"CSI" associate producer Brad Tanenbaum. Each episode of the show is
filmed in only eight or nine days, but it takes a couple of weeks of
painstaking work costing up to $50,000 to craft a good dummy.</TE>
<TE>   Still, "prosthetic bodies," as they're sometimes called, are used
for special occasions -- as in an episode of the WB's "Buffy the
Vampire Slayer" last season in which the title character got shot.
"We did an incredibly realistic torso of Buffy for an insert shot of
them digging the bullet out of her chest," said effects artist Robert
Hall. Network executives decided it was a bit too good. "I was
watching the show with some of my friends and was all, 'Watch! Watch!
Here comes this great shot! Uh, well, that's where it was supposed to
be.' "</TE>
<TE>   Actually, such disappointing moments for members of his profession
are growing rarer, said Goodwin, the makeup department chief on
"CSI."</TE>
<TE>   "On the first season, if the script called for it, I would put it
there, but a lot of times they wouldn't shoot it," Goodwin said,
proudly displaying a photo of an actress he made up as a decomposing
corpse covered with insects. "By the end of the second season they
were showing everything."</TE>
<TE>   Prime-time network shows don't linger over gruesome images. And
winning over executives sometimes takes effort, said Zuiker, who said
he has gone all the way to CBS President Les Moonves for approval to
air certain shots, some showing partial female nudity.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to shock our audience on occasion but we're not about
drowning your senses in gore," Zuiker said. "When you start doing
gore for gore's sake, you run into a level of distrust with your
audience. They don't take the science seriously and they don't take
the story seriously."</TE>
<TE>   Not long ago, TV hardly hinted at the true face of death. What
changed?</TE>
<TE>   Frank Spotnitz, an executive producer of Fox's "The X-Files,"
believes his series shattered the prime-time ickiness barrier,
regularly showcasing graphic autopsies conducted by one of the main
characters, Dana Scully, a doctor.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, medical examiner shows like 'Quincy' showed the dead
covered by sheets, and actors would lift the sheets and react,"
Spotnitz said. "We were the first allowed to be really gross. We took
highlight reels to coroners' conventions. We were always a big hit."</TE>
<TE>   John Furia Jr., professor of film and TV writing at USC, pointed
out that shows with a lot of dead people are ratings winners because
they treat death from the point of view of people at everyday jobs,
like HBO's "Six Feet Under," which focuses on a family-run funeral
parlor. Death, he said, becomes another crazy part of modern life.</TE>
<TE>   Because viewers get the joke, makeup artist Todd Masters said,
"Six Feet Under" can confidently take a truly bizarre sequence --
like one in which a mortician uses a can of cat food to properly
support a well-endowed porn actress' figure -- and not only get away
with it but draw big audiences and win an Emmy to boot.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to gross people out," Masters said. "We have to
walk a fine line."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the march of the dead will only quicken -- a trend
Furia predicted will continue as long as viewers clamor for reality.</TE>
<TE>   At "Crossing Jordan," executive producer Kring is readying an
episode that will trot out scores of victims of a bombing.</TE>
<TE>   Back at "CSI," with several corpses per episode, makeup artist
Goodwin worked in his studio, where a skeleton watched him put the
finishing touches on actor Peter Cunningham, playing a boxer who dies
during a fight.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never played dead before," said Cunningham, a real-life
former boxer, chuckling into a mirror at his pulverized features. "I
have to be careful not to react. They'll say, 'What's wrong with this
corpse?' "</TE>
<TE>   Which happens many times on camera, it turns out, even if those
scenes never get aired.</TE>
<TE>   "We always have the best outtake reels," Goodwin said as his
deceased boxer bobbed and weaved off to his autopsy.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't treat you like a corpse. They treat you like a work of
art," Yoon, the girl who got the business end of a corkscrew, said of
the "CSI" set. "It's the land of the walking dead.... It's Halloween
every day. I was at lunch and people are staring at me. I'm all blue
and my neck is hanging open."</TE>
<TE>   "We see the corpses at lunchtime and have to laugh," Goodwin said.
"They're dead, but they still get hungry."</TE>

<HD>Electroclash acts do the time warp</HD>
<DH>Although the language was more explicit, artists covered
familiar '80s territory in a four-part bill at the Henry Fonda
Theatre.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Natalie Nichols</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Those who don't remember the '80s are doomed to repeat them, or at
least to re-invent them by ironically reveling in the era's bad hair,
tacky clothes and vapid synth-pop.</LD>
<LD>   "Electroclash" is the name for neo-new-wave disco, and on Monday a
capacity crowd filled the Henry Fonda Theatre to see four acts
associated with the term.</LD>
<LD>   DJ and host Larry Tee played the nerdy yell leader at this
multimedia pep rally, where a mostly early-20s audience flaunted
passions for robot voices, Giorgio Moroder, Blondie, Kraftwerk and
leg warmers. This is supposed to be up-from-the-underground stuff,
yet the karaoke-style presentations by headlining singer-rapper
Peaches and Brooklyn girl group WIT were not unlike the more
elaborate concerts of such current pop superstars as Britney Spears.</LD>
<TE>   The trio WIT wore identical, shiny halter-dresses and vogued
through burbly dance numbers and ballads from a forthcoming album. At
one point they even oh-so-aptly used a guitar and bass as props.</TE>
<TE>   Peaches went for in-your-face sexuality with selections from her
2000 debut, "The Teaches of Peaches." Wearing hot-pink fishnet
thigh-highs and a succession of skimpy two-piece outfits, the
Canadian vaguely resembled Jennifer Beals in "Flashdance" as she
gyrated aggressively for about an hour.</TE>
<TE>   The mostly unprintable song titles incorporated Stooges-like
guitar riffs along with much whip-snapping percussion, but Peaches,
though certainly more verbally explicit, didn't cover any territory
that Madonna hadn't already strip-mined back in the day.</TE>
<TE>   At least there were more overt political and social components to
Olympia, Wash.-based Tracey + the Plastics and Munich-born Chicks on
Speed.</TE>
<TE>   The former featured performance artist Lynne Greenwood interacting
with videotaped sidekicks while exploring feminist and gay issues
with tunes from her album "Musclers Guide to Videonics."</TE>
<TE>   Chicks on Speed infused pulsing house and new wave with quirky
commentaries on fashion, individuality and economics. The members
wore homemade leather dresses and injected a much-needed sense of
purpose into an evening that mostly served to remind us that for
some, Blondie's "Call Me" has much more resonance than Nirvana's
"Smells Like Teen Spirit."</TE>

<HD>Pumpkin match rivals</HD>
<DH>A friendly contest among neighbors has become an annual
rite around Lake Arrowhead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Duane Noriyuki</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a season of skinny pumpkins and fat squirrels. Seemingly in
conspiracy against contestants in the pumpkin-growing contest,
squirrels and their pillaging ilk -- gophers, raccoons and bears --
were on the attack. Traps and chicken wire were strategically placed.
One woman stood watch with a BB gun, challenging the intruders to
show themselves.</LD>
<LD>   Many pumpkins that were not poached merely withered on the vine
without explanation. One of the contestants, Cathy Burns, accepted
part of the blame herself. "Growing pumpkins is a metaphor for
raising children," she said. "If I spent more time out here there
would probably be fewer squirrels. I could keep the riffraff out."</LD>
<LD>   By midsummer considerable damage had been done and Burns wasn't
sure if she and husband Brad could make a run for October's reward --
top prize in the annual Lake Arrowhead-area competition in which they
and their neighbors had been going pumpkin to pumpkin for years. The
contest is friendly, as long as you're not a ground squirrel.</LD>
<TE>   The pumpkins here in the San Bernardino Mountains don't grow as
large as those in other parts of the country, some of which weigh
more than 1,000 pounds. In this competition, the record, set last
year, is 208 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Because in the heat of things contestants typically mislead each
other about the size of their pumpkins -- overstating to breed
consternation, understating to breed overconfidence -- they are
forced to drive around sneaking peeks at others' gardens. What they
found this year were fewer and smaller pumpkins, but also tales of
persistence, of odds overcome. Just down the road from the Burnses,
such a story unfolded.</TE>
<TE>   The Dahlquists last year planted their patch in back of the house.
They diligently watered and fertilized, then waited and waited and
waited, but not a single pumpkin resulted. A less determined family
may have held onto its $15 entry fee this year. Not the Dahlquists.
They planted again, this time in front, but midway through the
season, the squirrels feasted. It looked like another washout, but
then they noticed something strange happening in back. They didn't
plant anything there this year, but vines were growing in last year's
patch.</TE>
<TE>   And, alas, there grew ... something. At first they thought it was
a zucchini. It was green and long, but then it started to round out.
Cecile Dahlquist called Cathy Burns and told her the story.</TE>
<TE>   "A miracle" was Burns' initial reaction. Then after further
consideration, she surmised, a watermelon. It came to be known as a
"wumpkin," part watermelon, part pumpkin.</TE>
<TE>   Dahlquist had another name for it. She called it her duck. When
she was pregnant with Nicolas, her oldest son, she dreamed she gave
birth to a duck, and when the duck was born, she said she didn't care
that it was a duck. It was a beautiful duck, and it was her duck and
she loved it just the same.</TE>
<TE>   The Dahlquists' wumpkin grew slowly and showed little promise of
ever being big enough to compete with the others, but that didn't
matter. It was theirs, and it was beautiful.</TE>
<TE>   Talk of the town</TE>
<TE>   By midsummer, everyone was talking about Ron Bench's pumpkins.
While others were the size of golf balls or baseballs, Bench's were
the size of basketballs and even beach balls.</TE>
<TE>   A retired firefighter-EMT who runs a painting business his father
started in 1964, Bench, 55, is a farmer at heart. On his one acre are
chickens and pigeons, fruit trees, vegetables and many varieties of
flowers.</TE>
<TE>   For 34 years, he fought fires and helped people in emergencies. He
once got a call of a woman suffering a stroke. When he heard the
address, he knew it was his grandmother, and when he arrived, she was
already dead.</TE>
<TE>   It's nice now, he says, to no longer hear the firehouse alarms.
Instead he hears the rooster's crow well before sunrise, then the
silence of early morn. He gathers eggs and shares them with
neighbors, sponsors a youth soccer team. Grows pumpkins.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, Jerry Fulton, fellow contestant and founder of the
contest 13 years ago, keeps a close eye on Bench's pumpkins. This
year, however, he hasn't had much time for spying on the competition.
He and wife Kay put their home of 33 years on the market, and by
early August, there were buyers. The new owners were pre-qualified
and wanted to move in quickly, but Fulton balked. He needed time, he
said, to grow his pumpkins.</TE>
<TE>   A contestant's priorities</TE>
<TE>   "The agent told me I should get my priorities straight," said
Fulton, 63. "He asked me, 'What do you want, your money or your
pumpkins?' I told him I did have my priorities straight. That's how
important my pumpkins are to me."</TE>
<TE>   On a foggy day in late September, Fulton, with knife in hand,
walked down to his pumpkin patch. He had been busy planning his high
school reunion and getting the house ready for new owners. Harvesting
his final pumpkin was one of the few remaining tasks.</TE>
<TE>   He removed it from the vine, then lifted it easily -- too easily
-- and carried it up the stairs to his driveway. Normally it would
take two people to get it there. "This is the smallest one I've grown
in 15 or 18 years," Fulton said, before hoisting the pumpkin into the
back of his Jeep. "This one might weigh 40 pounds but it's a good
looking one, isn't it?"</TE>
<TE>   The deadline for weighing pumpkins was 9:30 a.m. on Oct. 15 at
Jensen's, a grocery store that sponsors the contest. At 8:45 a.m.,
Cheri Altmeyer walked to her garden, and there next to her largest
pumpkin was a mound of freshly turned dirt. A gopher had visited.
"Oh, no," she said, and reached under the pumpkin the best she could
to see if the gopher had hollowed it out as gophers tend to do. She
felt around and let out a sigh of relief.</TE>
<TE>   The Altmeyers are the defending champions and record holders. This
one, Cheri's husband, Jeff, guesses, will come in at about 120
pounds, which may be good enough for first place.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Altmeyer and Bench, who lives across the road, find great joy
in badgering each other. Earlier, Bench took a look at the Altmeyer
pumpkin, which was pale yellow rather than the usual deep orange.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not a pumpkin," Bench claimed.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, right, then what is it?" Jeff challenged.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't know," said Bench, "but it's not a pumpkin."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to being a different color, it was an odd shape. Cheri
likened it to her belly when she was pregnant.</TE>
<TE>   After using a wheelbarrow to load it up, they took the pumpkin to
the store, and right away other contestants were mocking it. "Look at
that puny thing," Ron Dolman said in the parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   Undeterred, the Altmeyers loaded their pumpkin onto a cart and
pushed it into the store, past the sweet smells of the bakery, beyond
the rows of salad dressing, behind the meat counter and into the
storage locker, where they placed it on a scale.</TE>
<TE>   It was 130 pounds, far lighter than last year's entry but heavy
enough to win this year's top prize of $140 and the right to host the
contest barbecue.</TE>
<TE>   Bench and wife Laurie were second with an 83-pounder. Dolman and
his wife, Linda, tied Fulton for third with 50 1/2-pounders. Pat
Pattison's came in at 31 pounds. Cathy and Brad Burns brought in a
15-pounder.</TE>
<TE>   The last entry weighed belonged to the Dahlquists. The whole
family showed up. Sons Nicolas, 9, and Erik, 6, were allowed to miss
school.  Their immaculately conceived "wumpkin" had evolved into a
wonderfully handsome pumpkin, symmetrical and deep, brilliant orange.
It looked nothing like a zucchini or watermelon. It weighed 3 pounds,
the size of a small miracle. Or a good-sized mallard.</TE>

<LD>Director Peter Bogdanovich, whose last film, "The Cat's Meow," dealt
with the mysterious death in 1924 of Hollywood producer Thomas Ince
aboard a yacht, will turn his attention next to a movie about a
Hollywood actress who died under what many still consider to be
mysterious circumstances aboard a yacht in 1981.</LD>
<LD>   That actress was Natalie Wood. Bogdanovich was announced Tuesday
as the director of a three-hour TV movie for ABC about her life,
based on the book "Natasha" (Wood's birth name), by Suzanne Finstad.
Wood drowned after tumbling into the ocean at night while trying to
get into an inflatable boat from her 60-foot yacht following an
argument with her husband, actor Robert Wagner.</LD>
<LD>   The famed star of such films as "West Side Story," "Gypsy" and
"Inside Daisy Clover" will be portrayed by Justine Waddell, a native
of South Africa who has appeared in "Mansfield Park" and "Dracula
2000."</LD>

<LD>The voice was familiar but the time of day wasn't. Al Rantel,
normally heard weeknights from 7 to 10 on talk station KABC-AM (790),
turned up Tuesday between 11 and 11:45 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't an accident. He's the new host at that time slot
following the departure of Gloria Allred and Mark Taylor. They'd been
on the station together for two years but had their time slot reduced
to 45 minutes when KABC brought in the syndicated "Sean Hannity Show"
in September 2001.</LD>
<LD>   KABC program director Erik Braverman was unusually candid in
describing the value of putting Rantel on during the morning period:
"Al Rantel will have an incredible opportunity to recycle his daytime
listeners into his evening show as well as cross-promote and tease
the topics of the day that listeners can expect to hear more about
that night."</LD>

said that Gloria Allred and Mark Taylor had been hosting a 45-minute
show on KABC-AM (790) since the debut of "The Sean Hannity Show" in

<LD>The design for a new $400-million interactive museum focusing on news
and the media was unveiled Tuesday in Washington by the nonprofit
Freedom Forum.</LD>
<LD>   Opened in 1997 in nearby Arlington, Va., the Newseum attracted
more than 2.25 million visitors in its nearly five years of operation
before closing in preparation for the new building.</LD>
<LD>   New York-based Polshek Partnership Architects designed the
531,000-square-foot structure, which will be at Pennsylvania Avenue
and 6th Street N.W., between the U.S. Capitol and the White House and
next to the Mall.</LD>
<TE>   Nearly half the space, on six levels, will be occupied by the
museum; the Freedom Forum foundation, which promotes "free press,
free speech and free spirit for all," will also move its headquarters
to the building.</TE>
<TE>   Polshek Partnership is best known for its acclaimed design for the
Rose Center for Earth and Space at the American Museum of Natural
History in New York. Like that design, the Newseum will include a
large window facade highlighting displays inside.</TE>
<TE>   The museum will continue its popular "Today's Front Pages"
exhibit, showing daily international and national newspaper front
pages, and have numerous permanent and changing exhibitions of
newspaper and broadcast history.</TE>

<LD>All three cable news networks got an audience boost in October, as
viewers tuned in for updates about the sniper shootings.</LD>
<LD>   Final figures released Tuesday put Fox News Channel in the lead,
where it has been since the beginning of the year, with an average of
926,000 people tuned in at any given time during the month, compared
with CNN's 794,000 and MSNBC's 341,000.</LD>
<LD>   Compared with a year ago, when viewing jumped because of the war
on terrorism, Fox was up 2%, CNN was down 37% and MSNBC was off 52%.</LD>
<TE>   But compared with September, Fox gained 43%, while CNN spiked 55%
and MSNBC jumped 44%.</TE>
<TE>   And while CNN's venerable top-rated show, "Larry King Live," for
the first time lost out to Fox rival "Hannity &amp; Colmes," CNN's
"American Morning" (4-7 a.m.) closed what had been a sizable gap with
"Fox &amp; Friends" (3-6 a.m.), which nonetheless maintained a 5% lead
over CNN in the morning.</TE>

<HD>Pausing during holy season to spread hatred in Egypt</HD>

<LD>"To what extent the whole existence of this people is based on a
continuous lie is shown incomparably in 'The Protocols of the Elders
of Zion,' so infinitely hated by the Jews.... What many Jews may do
unconsciously is here consciously exposed."</LD>
<LD>   -- Adolf Hitler</LD>
<LD>   "Mein Kampf,"</LD>
<TE>   Chapter 11, Volume 1</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Discussing hateful speech is distasteful. Discussing a book filled
with such virulent hatred that it literally has contributed to the
deaths of millions is loathsome.</TE>
<TE>   As the passage cited above demonstrates, "The Protocols of the
Elders of Zion," a notorious anti-Semitic forgery concocted more than
a century ago by the Russian czar's secret police, is such a book. We
are obliged to plumb its malicious depths yet again because the
Egyptian government has decided to permit the televising of a
sprawling historical drama whose producers drew their inspiration
from the "Protocols."</TE>
<TE>   The series, "Horse Without a Horseman," purports to be a
re-creation of Mideastern history from 1855 through World War I. Its
protagonist is an Egyptian who fights first the British imperialists
and then Zionists struggling to establish a Jewish homeland. The
41-part narrative, reported by the New York Times on Saturday, not
only conceptually incorporates the "Protocols' " various slanders but
also features as one of its dramatic high points the main characters'
discovery and translation into Arabic of the book itself, which
alleges a convoluted plot by nonexistent Jewish leaders to dominate
the world.</TE>
<TE>   Though it was produced by one of Egypt's ostensibly independent
channels -- Dream TV -- the series was approved by Cairo's official
censors and will air on state television over consecutive nights
during next month's holy season of Ramadan. The broadcasts are timed
to coincide with the hour at which Muslims traditionally gather with
family and friends to break their daylong fast, thereby guaranteeing
a potential audience in the tens of millions. And, since many in that
audience are young and illiterate, "The Protocols of the Elders of
Zion" may gain a larger and more credulous audience than it ever has
enjoyed in its long and tormenting history.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, that is the hope of the production's co-author and
star, Egyptian actor Muhammad Sobhi. He recently told the
Arab-language television station Al Jazeera that, even if the
"Protocols" are forged, "Zionism exists and it has controlled the
world since the dawn of history." Sobhi called it "stupid" not to
consider whether the book's allegations are true, even if the chances
are "one in a million."</TE>
<TE>   Hala Sarhan, vice president of Dream TV, was quoted by the New
York Times as saying "In a way, don't [Jews] dominate? Of course,
what we read from the 'Protocols,' it says it's a kind of conspiracy.
They want to control; they want to dominate .... We will see whether
this happened throughout history or not."</TE>
<TE>   Egyptian authorities deny that their approval of "Horse Without a
Horseman" involves anti-Semitism. They are lying. Airing such a
program in this fashion to such an audience is the single most
significant act of anti-Jewish propaganda since the heyday of the
Third Reich.</TE>
<TE>   And, according to former Harvard professor Daniel Jonah Goldhagen,
author of "Hitler's Willing Accomplices," it "reflects in the
clearest possible way the peculiar persistence of this malevolent
form of fantastical belief called anti-Semitism. Historically, the
charges contained in the 'Protocols' are -- to any rational person --
out of this world. But they remain useful as a way of making concrete
the demonization of Jews that already has occurred in the minds of
believers."</TE>
<TE>   As evidence of this process, Goldhagen cites recent surveys he
says show that measurable numbers of Austrians, Germans and Italians
continue to believe that Jews are cursed as Christ killers -- this
despite the fact the so-called "deicide" libel was officially
condemned by the Catholic and Lutheran churches decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Because anti-Semitism has permeated Western civilization for
2,000 years and because all Western ideas and notions -- good and
evil -- now are spreading through the globalization of information,"
Goldhagen said, "a new substructure of prejudice with no basis in
reality is spreading through the ether."</TE>
<TE>   Goldhagen's latest book, "A Moral Reckoning: The Role of the
Catholic Church in the Holocaust and Its Unfulfilled Duty of Repair,"
explores the historic roots of this particular bigotry. "A text like
the 'Protocols,' " he said, "seems crazy to anybody who doesn't
believe in these things, but to those who have already given
themselves up to self-delusion, it seems like proof.</TE>
<TE>   "Local political leaders can put something like this forward to
cynically manipulate those already in thrall to these delusions -- or
to implant them where they don't exist. Imagine an average
12-year-old Egyptian kid with no other form of information seeing
this drama. This is being done for cynical reasons by the Egyptian
government to distract attention from its own problems. That too is a
tactic almost as old as anti-Semitism," Goldhagen said.</TE>
<TE>   Leon Wieseltier, literary editor of the New Republic, noted that
the persistence of works like the "Protocols" does not "raise a
historical question, but a diagnostic one since the taste for this
stuff constitutes a mass psychological disorder. To leave it at that,
though, is too passive a response, since it is a disorder that has
been of enormous political utility to certain political regimes at
certain times.</TE>
<TE>   "Egypt, for example, does not suffer from a surfeit of free
speech. The government controls the media and President Hosni Mubarak
could have winked this thing out of existence, had he wished to do
so. He does not wish to forbid this sort of filth because promoting
anti-Americanism and anti-Zionism are the cornerstones of the
Faustian bargain he has struck to maintain his regime."</TE>
<TE>   Today, according to Wieseltier, "prejudice of this sort is like
contemporary famines -- political not natural facts. The immediate
problem is not the history of anti-Semitism, but the current
government of Egypt. Mubarak is directly culpable for allowing the
dirtiest form of hatred of Jews and Americans to become common
currency in his society."</TE>
<TE>   Since it was published publicly in 1905, "Protocols" has cast a
sinister influence unequaled by any similar work. It fueled the
pogroms of Russia's Black Hundreds and, a few decades later, those of
the White Armies in that country's civil war. It helped inspire the
Holocaust and an American neo-Nazi fantasy called "The Turner
Diaries." Domestic terrorist Timothy McVeigh slept with that book
under his pillow.</TE>
<TE>   While such chilling examples crop up from time to time, Goldhagen
noted "it also is true that, throughout the West, modernity has
helped wean people away from anti-Semitism and other racist
prejudices. Modernity generally is a friend of people opposed to
prejudice of all kinds. Closed, pre-modern societies of the sort that
prevail today throughout the Arab world are friends to the sorts of
prejudices open, democratic societies reject."</TE>
<TE>   Free expression rooted in reason is the foundation of the open
society. The Egyptian authorities who have sanctioned this
profanation of Islam's holy season must be confronted with the fact
that their decision is unacceptable. Truth, freely and fearlessly
expressed to those who need to hear it, is the best -- and only sure
-- antidote to hateful speech.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Fahrenheit 451," Ray Bradbury's book about the burning of books, was
the toast of the town last spring, no pun intended.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor James Hahn urged all Los Angelenos to read it and
implemented programs to help his constituents do so. Surely a large
number of readers were introduced to this 1953 science-fiction
classic, and found it remarkably prescient in its portrait of a
future dominated by interactive but vacuous TV shows on big screens,
headsets that prefigured Walkmans and cell phones, short attention
spans, worries about homeland security.</LD>
<LD>   Now Bradbury's new stage adaptation of his novel has opened at the
Falcon Theatre in Burbank. Sad to say, it feels so desiccated that it
may have the effect of deterring theatergoers from reading the book.
Considering the play's theme, that would be a truly perverse irony.</LD>
<TE>   For the uninitiated, the story follows the metamorphosis of Montag
(D.B. Sweeney), a 30ish "fireman" -- in a society where the firemen
start fires to burn books. Influenced by Clarisse (Becky Wahlstrom),
a teenager who lives nearby, and later by her erudite uncle (Jay
Gerber), Montag leaves his pill-popping wife, Mildred (Marguerite
MacIntyre), and his job, becomes a fugitive and eventually finds a
rustic society of refugees who memorize texts in order to pass them
on to posterity.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't Bradbury's first stage adaptation of "Fahrenheit 451."
An earlier incarnation was staged by the Colony Theatre in 1979.
Bradbury wrote about some of the changes in the story that he added
for that version in an afterword to a 1982 edition of the book. The
same changes remain in this rendition, and they aren't all
improvements.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest problem is that much of the first act is devoted to
long harangues by Montag's boss, Capt. Beatty (John M. Jackson), in
which he admits a former love of books, and describes the gradual
deterioration of society and his disillusionment. He completes one
lecture at one site and then moves on to more of the same at another
site. His preachiness kills the narrative momentum.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is the play helped by the visual design. The stage is largely
bare, but the backdrop consists of three screens. At first, the
"Fahrenheit 451" fan might look forward to seeing glimpses of the
bubble-headed TV shows that Mildred spends her days watching. But no,
those images are never made tangible. Instead, the screens are filled
with a series of digital animations that are supposed to suggest the
cool, sleek look of the era's architecture -- and the heat of the
fires that dominate Montag's life.</TE>
<TE>   The digital imagery, credited to Nick Denney, Jerry Belich and
Wesley Horton, serves the former purpose well enough, but it flunks
the fire test. The flames look carefully designed -- and patently
fake.</TE>
<TE>   The whole production, staged by Charles Rome Smith, lacks a sense
of visceral passion. Although some felt that Francois Truffaut's 1967
film version had a similar problem, it's a fireball (plenty of images
of real flames) compared with this cerebral and restrained staging.</TE>
<TE>   The ending seems especially wan in contrast to the natural imagery
that Truffaut's camera caught. And although the sound effects produce
a scary growl for the mechanical "hound" that the firemen use to
track down miscreants, the incidental music is nothing but
incidental. The acting is proficient but colorless.</TE>
<TE>   On opening night, Bradbury spoke briefly to the audience, saying
that the "money-changers in the temple" of the movie studios drove
him out, and "I have taken refuge in the theater ... this is my real
home." From the looks of this production, however, his real home is
in his books.</TE>

<HD>TV Land marathon takes a trip back to Bob Newhart's couch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bob Newhart may stammer, but he never misses a beat.</LD>
<LD>   As the story goes, Newhart feared turning into a sitcom cliche --
the dopey but lovable dad -- so he insisted his TV characters be
childless. When the creators of his 1970s CBS classic, "The Bob
Newhart Show," eventually presented him with a script in which his
on-screen wife, Emily (Suzanne Pleshette), gets pregnant, he chuckled
and asked, "Who are you going to get to play Bob?"</LD>
<LD>   More than four decades of deadpan wit have earned New- hart the
Mark Twain Prize, awarded Tuesday night by the Kennedy Center in
Washington in an all-star comedy concert. The annual award was
originated in 1998 to honor those who create humor from their
uniquely American experiences.</LD>
<TE>   Newhart, the former bookkeeper who scored a hit in 1960 with his
debut comedy album, "The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart," later
starred in several TV series and is still going strong as a stand-up.</TE>
<TE>   The Kennedy Center's tribute will air Nov. 13 on PBS, but the
cable network TV Land offers its own Newhart salute tonight: A
marathon from 8 p.m. to midnight featuring eight of the '70s sitcom's
best episodes.</TE>
<TE>   As tonight's episodes remind us, Newhart's character, a Chicago
psychologist, never quite made any breakthroughs with his therapy
group, including the smug Elliot Carlin (Jack Riley), the henpecked
Mr. Peterson (John Fiedler) and the lonely Mrs. Bakerman (Florida
Friebus). But for six years, it was group therapy for America.</TE>

<HD>Baseball is Fox's one big hit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Brian Lowry</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even with ratings down sharply compared with last year, five World
Series games clearly put Fox in last week's winner's circle, based on
viewing estimates issued Tuesday by Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   Not surprisingly, viewing surged for the deciding seventh game but
still fell 21% short of last year's record Arizona-New York finale,
which played against the Sept. 11-delayed Emmy Awards telecast.</LD>
<LD>   Despite heightened tune-in for baseball, Fox's two nights of
entertainment programming struggled. The new David E. Kelley drama
"Girls Club" premiered fifth in its time slot, and "Boston Public"
was down last Monday compared with 2001, while the network drew its
lowest Friday rating this season for the new dramas "Firefly" and
"John Doe." Part of that had to do with stronger ratings for ABC,
which aired the perennial special "It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie
Brown" and "America's Funniest Home Videos."</LD>
<TE>   NBC's "Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit" also delivered its
highest rating this fall, while the red-hot "CSI: Crime Scene
Investigation" drew a staggering 25 million viewers with a rerun
Thursday, easily beating the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   Although the World Series drew its biggest audiences on the West
Coast -- including Super Bowl-sized ratings in L.A. and San Francisco
-- competing networks aired repeats of many established series rather
than waste original episodes opposite baseball in other time zones.</TE>

<HD>Dear diary, they love us</HD>
<DH>The tell-alls penned by minor figures with major ego issues
are being devoured by British readers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Wallace</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Corny language, dubious plots and punishing reviews have never been
enough to keep British thriller writer Jeffrey Archer off the
bestseller lists, so there's no reason that incarceration in one of
Britain's maximum security prisons for perverting justice should be
much of a hindrance either.</LD>
<LD>   Lord Archer, as the British Tory peer is formally known here, is
back on the British book charts with "A Prison Diary," an almost
hour-by-hour account of three weeks in London's Belmarsh prison at
the start of his four-year jail term for lying under oath. Sneeringly
dedicated to "Foul Weather Friends" and filled with the horrors of
gentrified taste buds meeting prison food for the first time, the
diary has been promoted by its publishers as a "devastating
indictment of the British penal system."</LD>
<LD>   It is less than that, of course, but it does confirm Archer's
reputation as a scrapper. Climbing, falling and rising again in
London political and society circles is Archer's true canon. And
"Prison Diaries" has pulled him back from the precipice of what he
would see as disaster: the ignominy of being out of the news.</LD>
<TE>   With a self-marketer's instinct, Archer has caught the current
wave of fascination with published diaries. The British have a
recurring affinity for reading those who write ostensibly only to
themselves, a tradition that runs from 17th century Londoner Samuel
Pepys, who arguably created the diary form, to Helen Fielding, whose
fictional "Bridget Jones's Diary" became a late-20th century smash.</TE>
<TE>   "Overall, there is more appetite for published diaries in the U.K.
than there is here," says Morgan Entrekin, president of the
Grove/Atlantic publishing house in New York. Although there is a
market for diaries in the U.S., it tends to appeal to specialized
tastes "unless, of course, your name is Kurt Cobain," Entrekin says
of the Nirvana singer's soon-to-be published journals.</TE>
<TE>   But Britain has seen a deluge of mass-market diaries this fall,
none from an author with the celebrity cachet of a Cobain. Instead,
they come from the fringes of British politics and society, from
those who were voyeurs to power rather than practitioners of it.</TE>
<TE>   All are tantalizingly malicious. Thanks to the recent publication
of "The Unexpurgated Beaton," a fuller and franker version of the
photographer and royal courtier's old diaries, we now know what Sir
Cecil really thought about the stars and snobs he socialized with.</TE>
<TE>   It is joined on the racks by the third and final volume from the
Conservative Party's late but forever lovable rogue Alan Clark, whose
previous two volumes of splenetic diary entries were surprising
bestsellers in Britain.</TE>
<TE>   But the real fireworks came upon the release of the extramarital
tattlings of Edwina Currie's "Dairies, 1987-92" that rocked the
country.</TE>
<TE>   The onetime member of Parliament of marginal political influence
exposed her four-year affair with her then-little-known colleague
John Major, who would become prime minister -- and leave her behind
on the escalator of ambition -- in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Currie hit headlines beyond the book pages with her revelations of
this unlikely coupling (she is an inveterate attention-monger; Major,
until now at least, the definition of staid). She called him B, as in
the second lover in her life, a tag that seems unnecessarily coy
given the cringing detail she goes into about their affair: his "big
blue underpants," their conversations about God while she was in the
bath, his comfort at being able to "philosophize and explore new
talents in bed."</TE>
<TE>   Currie kept the affair just between her and her diary for 14
years, an approach to spilling the beans that left her open to
charges she published only for the money and attention. She has been
widely vilified for outing Major (he has since described the affair
as the event in his life of which he is "most ashamed") and defended
by a far smaller minority for her candor.</TE>
<TE>   But having figuratively disrobed early by offering her Major scoop
to the Times of London for serialization, she may also end up with
fewer book sales than the other diarists.</TE>
<TE>   It is Archer who is most likely to lead the pack in sales (only he
among the political diarists has landed an American publisher),
although there has been much amused discussion over whether given the
author's well-chronicled looseness with the truth, his diary should
be placed on the nonfiction or fiction shelves. His jail sentence was
handed down in 2001 for perjury committed during an originally
successful 1987 libel trial against the Daily Star, a tabloid that
suggested he had spent a night in the company of a prostitute.</TE>
<TE>   Fourteen years later, Archer was proved to have paid an associate
to lie about his whereabouts on the night in question. Among those
who testified against him was his former secretary, who said Archer
ordered her to make false entries in the appointments diary he then
used in court for his alibi.</TE>
<TE>   Convicted of perjury and required to repay the $750,000 libel
award plus legal costs to the Star, Archer set about writing a prison
diary within hours of landing in Belmarsh. Readers accustomed to
seeing his name call out in gilded lettering from airport paperback
racks will have to look a little harder for this book. The cover says
only that it was written by prisoner FF 8282.</TE>
<TE>   But the words on the page are unmistakably Archer: unrepentant,
blustery, vaguely threatening to his enemies. "I would like to say
how much I enjoyed your books, particularly 'The Prodigal Daughter,'
" a fellow inmate doing time for a double murder tells him during
exercise rounds on July 23, 2001, before adding "and by the way, if
you want that ... secretary bumped off I'll be happy to arrange it
for you."</TE>
<TE>   If nothing else, Archer amuses. He is already promising to publish
future volumes as he moves through the prison system, perhaps
encouraged by the $300,000 he will reportedly receive for his work.</TE>
<TE>   (Laws against profiting from one's crime mean Archer won't collect
his "advance" until after his release.)</TE>
<TE>   But it is Alan Clark's diaries that may survive to be read a
generation from now. The onetime junior cabinet minister under
Margaret Thatcher has built a literary following that dwarfs his
comparatively lowly political achievements. Combined sales of his
three volumes of diaries already top 400,000, roughly four times the
number of copies Major sold with his prime ministerial memoirs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a soap opera," says Ion Trewin, the editor who turned
Clark's scrawl into published form, explaining the enduring appeal of
a central character who is in parts vain, a crashing snob, a
hypochondriac and an adulterer.</TE>
<TE>   "There are all these strands of stories going on and recurring
characters moving in and out. They almost become friends to the
reader and you start to ask yourself: 'Hey, what ever happened to
that gardener anyway?' " Trewin argues that Clark's following is
based on his fine writing and powers of observation, which is true
enough although sales of the first volume were boosted in 1994 when
the wife and two daughters of a prominent judge publicly admitted
they were the three lovers Clark referred to in the diaries as his
"coven."</TE>
<TE>   But his writing stands as a wonderfully opinionated snitch's
inside view of the Thatcher era. "The best political diaries have
always come from those who never made it all the way to the top, who
don't have to worry about wielding power," Trewin says. "But they are
very, very socially adept, and close enough to power to pick up the
good gossip."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed Clark's most subtle achievement may have been to capture
the dimming of the light of Tory Britain. By the third volume, he is
no longer a political player, thrust, like his party, to the fringes
of influence, his ambition shriveling. The mood becomes melancholy,
and there are disturbing hints along the way of the fatal brain tumor
to come. By the end, there is a retreat into the comfort of his
family at last.</TE>
<TE>   "Good diarists must be a bit in love with themselves," says author
Claire Tomalin, who read dozens of them on her way to writing a
just-released biography of Pepys called "The Unequaled Self." "The
best diaries are entertaining because they always have some bite to
them." Archer, Currie and Clark show those lessons still hold in the
age of celebrity. The diary's appeal as a savage art form survives, a
sign of the enduring allure of malice.</TE>

<KH>THE CALIFORNIA COOK</KH>
<HD>Fennel's untamed flavor</HD>
<DH>In Southern California, the wild plants thrive and their
fragrant seeds are a treasure to the cook.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Russ Parsons</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I'm standing on a bluff overlooking the ocean, soaking up the
afternoon sunshine. It's that delicious warm part of a fall day when
the chill of the morning fog has burned off but before it can creep
back for the evening. Below me, the sea cracks against a rocky beach.
Catalina looks like it's about a block away. In my hand, I hold a
brown paper bag full of just-picked fennel pods. Their warm perfume
mingles with the fresh salt air. And all I can think about is dinner.</LD>
<LD>   What about heating some of the seeds in olive oil and drizzling it
over grilled fish? I think. About one-fourth to one-half teaspoon for
a cup of oil would be just about right.</LD>
<LD>   Or I could warm them in honey and spoon them over sliced pears and
shards of Parmigiano-Reggiano. Same proportions will work.</LD>
<TE>   Hey, what about mixing the seeds into little pork-and-veal
meatballs and cooking them in tomato sauce? Or poaching the seeds
with some fish in white wine so when the liquid cools it will form a
beautifully perfumed jelly? Oh, I know, I'll stew them quickly with
anchovies, golden raisins and pine nuts to make a sauce for chewy
bucatini pasta.</TE>
<TE>   Give me another couple of hours to stand here and I'll come up
with more.</TE>
<TE>   I know a spot where the wild fennel grows, and I'll bet you do
too. In fact, if you'll open your eyes, it's almost everywhere in
Southern California. It's found up and down the state, from San Diego
to Humboldt County. A Mediterranean plant introduced by farmers, it
propagates like mad and can be found wherever the climate is right.
Though it seems to have adopted California as a second home, fennel
is also found in states from Florida to Wisconsin.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the stuff you buy in the grocery stores, the bulb of the
wild fennel is beside the point. It's thin, stringy and mean. But in
the spring, fennel sends up vibrant green sprays of fronds that are
almost impossibly fragrant when stuffed into the belly of a baked
fish, or when strewn across a hot bowl of boiled favas.</TE>
<TE>   And at this time of year, even after the fronds have died back to
nothing and the stalks have turned brown and crackly, fennel plants
are laden with starbursts of tiny, explosively pungent seeds that add
a green, anise-flavored exclamation point to all kinds of dishes.</TE>
<TE>   These fennel seeds are different from the ones you buy in the
grocery store. In the first place, they're smaller. But they're more
tender too; they pop rather than crunch.</TE>
<TE>   And the flavor ... the only thing to compare it to is those little
spoonfuls of candied fennel seeds you get after dinner at Indian
restaurants. They're impossibly sweet with a mouth-filling anise
flavor. (Remember this when cooking with them: a little bit goes a
long way. In a pinch, you can use regular fennel seeds but the flavor
won't be as dramatic.)</TE>
<TE>   When you're cooking with wild fennel, you'll almost invariably
wind up with something that seems to be at least vaguely Italian.
Though wild fennel is found all over Italy, oddly enough the seeds
are little used. Italians seem to favor the green fronds, which show
up in such things as pasta chi sardi, the signature Sicilian dish of
spaghetti, fresh sardines and fresh fennel. There is also a pretty
wonderful pesto made with wild fennel fronds.</TE>
<TE>   The pollen of wild fennel, which must be gathered in the spring,
is one of the ingredients of the moment in restaurant cooking. If
you're feeling really ambitious along about May or June, collect the
flowers, then sort and screen them to separate the pollen. Do it once
and you'll understand the $25-per-ounce price.</TE>
<TE>   Wild fennel grows almost everywhere. I remember walking through a
particularly bleak part of downtown L.A. and catching a familiar
scent. There, on a rocky patch of ground just above a parking lot was
a magnificent stand of fennel. Of course, I wouldn't advise
collecting seeds from street fennel. You'll want to gather them from
plants that grow off the beaten track, away from chemical sprays,
auto exhaust, walking dogs and other pollutants.</TE>
<TE>   It may be my imagination, but I find the most fragrant fennel
seems to grow within sight of the water. This place I was telling you
about, for example -- I have to lean clear out over the fence to get
to the seeds.</TE>
<TE>   Though they may look unpromising, search for plants that have died
back so that just the stalks remain. This isn't hard; we're not
talking about ankle-high dandelions here. Fully grown fennel stalks
can be taller than a man. The seed clusters will be at the tops of
the stalks, looking like connect-the-dots versions of tiny umbrellas
(fennel belongs to the family Umbelliferae, so named because of this
pattern).</TE>
<TE>   Choose clusters with seeds that are fully formed but not yet
hardened. Pull them off and stick the clusters in a paper bag. When
you've got enough, take them home to sort. The back of a knife works
well to separate the seeds from the pods and tiny stems. You can use
them right away. Whatever's left over (and there will be a bunch --
one trip is usually enough to supply a winter), set out to dry.
They'll keep forever in a tightly sealed container.</TE>
<TE>   I've found it always pays to taste a couple of seeds before
investing much effort in picking. Just last week, I was picking seeds
in what seemed to be a long-vacant parking lot near the ocean. When I
sampled a couple of seeds, my mouth went numb. Chemical herbicidal
sprays are used in the oddest places.</TE>
<TE>   Some misguided souls, it seems, are out to eradicate fennel. One
of my favorite spring fennel stands is always gone by late summer --
mowed down as a fire hazard. In fact, fennel is officially classified
as an invasive pest.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, that's about as good a definition as I can imagine of
the magic of California -- a state where even the weeds are
delicious.</TE>

<TE>   Harvesting fennel</TE>
<TE>   Wild fennel can be found all over California. Here's what to look
for:</TE>
<TE>   Fully grown plants have the best seeds. They'll look almost dead,
like a collection of tall, dried stalks. Choose plants that have
grown away from well-traveled paths. Taste a few seeds before
harvesting.</TE>
<TE>   To collect seeds, pull whole clusters from the tops of the stalks.
Separate seeds from stems and husks at home. Seeds can be used
immediately or dried overnight in a cool oven. Stored in a jar,
they'll last forever.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bucatini with golden raisins, fennel and pine nuts</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 20 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 4 to 6</TE>
<TE>   Note: This recipe is loosely based on a dish Vincent Schiavelli
prepared for one of his regular Sicilian dinners at Alto Palato
restaurant in West Hollywood. He called it "Pasta chi Sardi a Mari,"
or Pasta With Sardines Still in the Sea, because of its resemblance
to the classic Sicilian Pasta chi Sard -- only without the sardines.
Bucatini, also known as perciatelli, is a long dried pasta that is
shaped like a thick spaghetti with a tiny hole in the center.
Spaghetti can also be used.</TE>
<TE>   1/4cup golden raisins</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1 clove garlic, minced</TE>
<TE>   4 anchovy filets, minced</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon fennel seeds</TE>
<TE>   6 tablespoons minced parsley</TE>
<TE>   1 pound bucatini</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   1/4cup toasted pine nuts</TE>
<TE>   1. Cover the raisins with hot water and let soften 15 to 20
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   2. Warm the olive oil, garlic, anchovies and fennel seeds in a
skillet over medium-low heat. After about 5 minutes, the garlic and
anchovies will begin to melt into a fairly smooth paste. Add the
parsley and keep the mixture warm, but do not let the garlic scorch.</TE>
<TE>   3. Cook the bucatini in plenty of rapidly boiling, salted water
until it is tender, about 10 minutes. Drain the bucatini, reserving
1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water, and add the noodles to the
skillet with the sauce. Drain the raisins and add to the skillet.
Increase the heat to high and add the reserved pasta cooking water.
Cook, stirring the mixture together, until most of the water has
evaporated and the sauce clings to the noodles, about 3 minutes. Stir
in the pine nuts. Serve immediately.</TE>

<TE>   Fennel polpette</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 1 hour</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 4 to 6</TE>
<TE>   Note: Serve with polenta, spaghetti or by itself.</TE>
<TE>   1/2pound ground pork</TE>
<TE>   1/2 pound ground veal</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons fennel seeds</TE>
<TE>   1 egg</TE>
<TE>   1/4cup fresh bread crumbs</TE>
<TE>   1/2teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon minced onion</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1 onion, chopped</TE>
<TE>   1 clove garlic, minced</TE>
<TE>   1/2cup white wine</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups chopped tomatoes</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons minced fennel fronds (optional)</TE>
<TE>   1. Combine the pork, veal, fennel seeds, egg, bread crumbs, salt
and minced onion in a large mixing bowl. Stir or work with your hands
until the mixture is homogenous. It will be very wet.</TE>
<TE>   2. Heat the olive oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet
until it is hot enough to sizzle when a bit of meat is added to it.
Pinch off portions of the meat mixture and roll them into balls about
the size of walnuts (much bigger and they begin to fall apart as they
cook). As you make each one, add it to the olive oil.</TE>
<TE>   3. Cook the meatballs until they are browned on one side, 2 to 3
minutes. Do not move them around too much or they won't brown well.
As each meatball browns, flip it to brown another part. The fennel
seeds will pop out of the skillet; use a splatter guard or be very
careful. When all the meatballs are well-browned, remove them with a
slotted spoon and reserve them on a platter.</TE>
<TE>   4. Pour off all but 1 teaspoon of the fat in the skillet, being
careful to reserve all of the bits of browned meat. Add the onion and
stir, scraping the bottom. As the onion cooks, it will release
moisture, which will loosen the browned bits sticking to the pan.
When the onion is soft, after about 5 minutes, add the garlic and
cook until it is fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the white wine and
cook just until it loses its raw smell, about 1 minute. Add the
tomato pulp and stir to mix well.</TE>
<TE>   5. Gently slide the meatballs back into the tomato sauce, cover
and cook over medium-low heat until the meatballs are firm and the
sauce has thickened slightly and reduced, gently stirring
occasionally to coat the meatballs with the sauce. This will take
about 45 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   6. Taste the sauce  about 5 minutes before serving. Add more salt
if needed, then sprinkle the chopped fennel fronds over the top, if
you're using them, replace the lid and finish the cooking.</TE>

<KH>COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: LATIN AMERICA</KH>
<HD>Tamales of the world, united</HD>
<DH>Under one roof, cooks from all over make them like back
home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barbara Hansen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>EVEN if you went to Oaxaca or Honduras, you might not find tamales
that compare to these. What a surprise to find them right here in Los
Angeles, at a gem of a place on 7th Street called Mama's Hot Tamales
Cafe.</LD>
<LD>   The cafe is a sort of tamale co-op, with a communal kitchen where
cooks from all over Latin America make the tamales they grew up
eating.</LD>
<LD>   Beatriz Garcia, who is from Tlacolula, Oaxaca, makes chicken
tamales authentic down to the herb pitiona, which she blends into a
green sauce.</LD>
<TE>   Omar Lezcas, from Pochutla, Oaxaca, combines black beans and
squash in one tamal, chicken with black mole in another. His mole
sauce takes two days to prepare.</TE>
<TE>   Eva Munoz, from Santa Barbara, Honduras, makes a chicken tamal
with masa that's extraordinarily soft and smooth, seasoned with
cilantro, green pepper, onion and garlic. Achiote tints it a warm
yellow.</TE>
<TE>   Mama's Hot Tamales Cafe opened last year as a training center for
the vendors in MacArthur Park, just across the street. Here they
learn to prepare food according to health department regulations. In
the morning, you can see them -- most are women, but a few are men --
carrying sacks of ingredients for the tamales they will assemble in
the small kitchen, then load onto their carts.</TE>
<TE>   These are the same tamales that you order in the cafe, which opens
early for breakfast and closes after lunch. It's a pleasant place to
sit, looking out at the sycamores and palms that frame the park,
tranquil despite its crime-spotted history.</TE>
<TE>   The cafe is also a lively center of Latino culture, the host to a
surprising range of events, from last Friday's Frida Kahlo look-alike
contest to this Friday's artists reception. On Saturday, the cafe is
sponsoring a series of Day of the Dead events in the park.</TE>
<TE>   Bohemia Books, which opens into the cafe, stocks folk art and
Latino literature. Bright colors flow from one room into another. The
walls are gold, blue, fuchsia-pink. In the mural that dominates the
cafe, the goddess of corn sits in a golden sunburst, behind plump
ears of corn. To her right, Indians plant a crop. On the left, women
kneel to grind the kernels.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, tamales are the heart of the business. Each week, the
cafe issues a menu of 10 to 13 tamales from a master list of about
50, changing a few to introduce new flavors.</TE>
<TE>   A Tenochtitlan tamal from Guerrero, Mexico, coats shredded beef
with ground corn as chewy as grits. A mixote tamal from the same
state bundles chicken, potato, carrot, bell pepper, masa and fragrant
avocado leaf in a banana leaf.</TE>
<TE>   A Oaxacan black bean tamal sits on a piece of hierba santa, an
anise-flavored leaf used frequently in Oaxacan cooking. Silky soft
black bean tamales from Honduras and El Salvador are called pisques.
The tender, creamy masa for a chicken tamal from Amatitlan,
Guatemala, blends corn and rice.</TE>
<TE>   There are sweet tamales too. One from San Salvador contains
peaches, raisins, prunes and coconut. Pink guava and chewy cubes of
cheese are in a tamal from Bogota, Colombia. A sweet strawberry tamal
comes from Colima, Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Drinks include a wonderful cinnamon-scented horchata, made from
ground rice. Others are jamaica, tamarindo and hot, thick
champurrado. In addition to tamales, the lunch menu offers cheese
enchiladas, chicken fajitas, quesadillas and chicken with mole. For
breakfast there are eggs, a breakfast burrito and chilaquiles --
fried tortilla pieces in a red sauce made with California and pasilla
negro chiles. And tamales, too.</TE>
<TE>   And after your meal, you can stroll over to the park, meet the
vendors and learn what makes their tamales so extraordinary.</TE>

<LD>I thoroughly enjoyed your piece on non-delicious apples, "The
Temptation Is Back," (Oct. 23). It confirmed what I have long
suspected and gave me hope that true apples are making a comeback.
Having just returned from Oak Glen, Calif., with two bags of Mutsus,
it was good to know that similarly tasty species are returning. Now
can you do a similar piece on strawberries? Surely the watery,
tasteless monstrosities being marketed today are fruit of the same
mind-set -- appearance and keeping qualities over flavor every time.
Shall we then proceed to tomatoes?</LD>

<TE>   The article about apples was interesting and informative. I have
not used Red Delicious for many years because of their mealiness and
little taste.</TE>
<TE>   My all-time favorite apple is the Arkansas Black, which is grown
in limited quantities in Oak Glen. It is tart and crunchy crisp but
small. I have never seen it in the local markets.</TE>

<TE>   Although I enjoyed Emily Green's piece on the decline and rebirth
of apples that you'd want to eat, I was disappointed that the state
of cooking apples was left out. The Granny Smiths are not only "hard,
green and tart," they are downright acidic and ultimately tasteless.
Where are the apples worth displaying on a tart, or taking the
trouble to enclose in a good homemade crust, or just filling with
raisins and cinnamon and baking on a cold day?</TE>

<TE>   Your article was so to the point I almost cried. I am a lover of
fresh apples going way back. While I was working for 38 years, I ate
an apple a day to freshen me up and help get me through the
air-conditioned atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   Gradually the quality of apples began to deteriorate. I love a
good sweet, crisp apple, like the Red Delicious used to be. I stopped
eating apples on a regular basis. Once in a while I'd try a Fujii or
Gala but missed the old taste of the real Red Delicious. The Golden
Delicious seems to have held up somewhat better only it's hard to
find a sweet one.</TE>

<LD>It is beyond me why anyone who would be offended by live seafood
("Appearing Live, on Your Plate," Oct. 23) would eat any manner of
seafood at all, live or dead. If it bothers people that fish are
killed, then I would hope they would stop eating fish sticks, canned
tuna and smoked salmon. Weren't those fish also alive once? I have
talked with many people who eat meat but don't want to hear about
animals being killed. If we are bothered by the fact that animals die
in order for us to eat them, why would we continue eating them?</LD>

<KH>MATTERS OF TASTE / David Shaw</KH>
<HD>That great bottle needn't be just a holiday memory</HD>
<DH>You can find obscure wines, if you know where to look. A
hint: Log on first.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Shaw</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>YOU'RE on vacation, sitting in a small bistro in Burgundy -- or in
Alsace, or Provence or the Loire -- and you ask the waiter to
recommend a good local wine. He brings a bottle you've never heard
of. You taste it. You like it.</LD>
<LD>   You like it so much, in fact, that you jot down its name and order
it a couple of days later at another bistro. You like it even more.
Then, when you come home, you try to find it in your local wine shop.
No luck. You call a couple of other wine shops. Still no luck. You
check the wine lists at your favorite restaurants. Nope.</LD>
<LD>   Virtually everyone I know who's vacationed in France -- or in
Italy, Spain or Germany, for that matter -- has had this experience.
I suspect the same is true of those who have traveled in other
wine-growing regions -- in Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Argentina,
South Africa, wherever.</LD>
<TE>   Although the United States imports more than 130 million gallons
of wine a year, that's but a tiny fraction of the world's wine
production. France alone, for example, produces about 1.5 billion
gallons of wine a year, only 30 million gallons of which (about 2%)
are imported into the United States.</TE>
<TE>   So what do you do when you fall in love with a wine abroad and
can't find it here?</TE>
<TE>   That depends.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, I came back from Spain giddy with excitement over
Albarino, an inexpensive white wine from the Rias Baixas area of
Galicia, in the windy, western part of the country. It wasn't just
any Albarino I had discovered and craved; it was the Albarino made by
Granbazan, and it cost all of $14 a bottle. Unfortunately, while
Albarinos from several other producers were available here, the
Granbazan was not.</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated, I decided to try the Spanish government. I looked up
Spain in the phone book and found something called the Spanish
Commercial Office. A woman there gave me the name of a man who knew
all about Spanish wines imported into the United States. That guy
gave me the name of a small importer in New Jersey. We spoke on the
phone and -- voila -- the Granbazan was soon in hand (and on the
dinner table).</TE>
<TE>   This year, in Tuscany, we drank two wonderful wines that we'd
never tried before. One was a super Tuscan called Grattamacco, from
the magnificent 1997 vintage. It was young and a bit tannic, but my
wife, in particular, rhapsodized about its rich, full, smooth flavor.
We both liked it so much when we first had it at a friend's house in
Florence that we ordered it as soon as we saw it on a wine list, at a
restaurant not far from the house we rented a few days later in
Panzano.</TE>
<TE>   The other wine we discovered on that trip was an excellent Chianti
Riserva from Colle Lungo, also a '97.</TE>
<TE>   Alas, as we learned when we returned home, both wines were
unavailable in any of the wine stores we usually patronize in the Los
Angeles-Orange County area.</TE>
<TE>   I was about to give up when I asked about the wines at the Wine
Exchange in Tustin.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have them, but why don't you try Wine-Searcher.com," the
store clerk suggested.</TE>
<TE>   "What's that?" I asked.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a free online service that helps you locate hard-to-find
wines."</TE>
<TE>   I went home and tried.</TE>
<TE>   Bingo.</TE>
<TE>   Well, sort of bingo.</TE>
<TE>   The Grattamacco was available at the San Francisco Wine Trading
Co. The Colle Lungo was available at Park Ave. Liquor in New York.
Hmmm. Not exactly around the corner. Maybe I should've looked for
them in a wine shop in Tuscany and brought them back with me. But I
hadn't wanted to schlep wine from store to car to house to car to
hotel to taxi, and I hadn't wanted to have yet another package to
take on the airplane, given the current carry-on restrictions. So,
what to do now?</TE>
<TE>   Casting a wider net</TE>
<TE>   Wine-Searcher said I could sign up for its "Pro Version" ($15 a
year) and get a more complete list of retailers for both wines. I
signed up.</TE>
<TE>   The Grattamacco also was available at two stores in Italy and one
in Switzerland. The Colle Lungo was available at a store in Paso
Robles, Calif., at a store in Lewisburg, W.Va., at two stores in
Italy and at one each in Scotland and Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Great. A Los Angeleno buying an Italian wine via Scotland.</TE>
<TE>   Doesn't Wine-Searcher have any stores in Southern California? Yes,
they do. In all, Wine-Searcher.com lists almost 800 wine retailers --
and more than half a million different wines -- worldwide, and when I
clicked on their retailers list, the first one that popped up was
20-20 Wine Merchants in West Los Angeles. The Wine Exchange also is
listed, as are more than 20 other stores in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   But neither of my wines seemed to be available in any of those
stores. (Fortunately, in California we can have wine shipped to us
from other states and countries -- something that's prohibited in
many other states.)</TE>
<TE>   Wine-Searcher.com is the brainchild of Martin Brown, a 44-year-old
native of New Zealand, where Wine-Searcher is officially based
(though it actually operates out of London, where he now lives).
Brown started Wine-Searcher in 1999 and he says his site has about
70,000 different visitors a month, 65% of them in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   I wondered if his was the only such site. It isn't.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Julian Berkin, a longtime publisher of educational
materials in Illinois, started a similar, albeit smaller and more
costly service, and he has about 40,000 wines and 100 retailers -- 10
in Southern California -- available on his WineAlert.com site.</TE>
<TE>   Subscribers pay a $30 annual fee to use WineAlert.com -- or they
can link to the site without charge through eRobertParker.com, the
wine critic's Web site. (A subscription to Parker's site costs $99 a
year.)</TE>
<TE>   Users can search for a particular wine on Parker's site, and if
he's reviewed it and if it's available at one of the WineAlert.com
retailers, you can click on the "buy it online" button for a list of
retailers and their prices.</TE>
<TE>   WineAlert.com is somewhat more user-friendly than is
Wine-Searcher.com; it even includes a sound clip giving the correct
pronunciation for more than 7,000 wines. But WineAlert.com wasn't
much help on my Tuscan quest. None of its retailers had the '97 Colle
Lungo; the only one who had the '97 Grattamacco was in England, and
he would sell it only by the case.</TE>
<TE>   And now for the real test</TE>
<TE>   I decided to order the Grattamacco from the San Francisco Wine
Trading Co. It was $69.95 -- surprisingly, about $10 less than we'd
paid for it when we'd decided to splurge at the restaurant in
Tuscany.</TE>
<TE>   Ordering was easy, and the service was impressively professional.
I clicked on the wine merchant's name on the search results page,
then clicked on the e-mail button to ask if I could buy just one
bottle. An e-mail answer came back in 30 minutes, saying I could do
so. Shipping would cost $7.50, plus $2.50 for an insulated shipper,
the e-mail said, and payment could be made by credit card, either
online or by calling an 800 number.</TE>
<TE>   When I called, the store clerk said the bottle would be shipped
the next business day, "unless it's 90 degrees out, in which case
we'll delay it."</TE>
<TE>   The wine arrived two days later.</TE>
<TE>   We let it rest for three weeks, then decided to open it one night
last week when Lucy made a rustic pasta -- penne with pancetta,
Parmigiano-Reggiano, olive oil and garlic.</TE>
<TE>   Remembering that the Grattamacco had been a bit tannic in Tuscany,
I decided to decant it just before we sat down, hoping that some
aeration might soften it some. While Lucy brought the pasta to the
table, I found myself thinking about the wine merchants I'd heard
grumble over the years about customers who came in, bought a wine
they'd had on vacation, then returned to complain that it wasn't as
good as they remembered.</TE>
<TE>   What the disappointed vacationers seemed to forget, of course, is
that there's often something magical about drinking a wine near its
birthplace, when you're on a carefree holiday in a lovely setting,
that can't be duplicated at the dining room table, no matter how much
you love your house, your family and your spouse's cooking.</TE>
<TE>   Would the Grattamacco also be a disappointment?</TE>
<TE>   We sat down. I poured. We sipped.</TE>
<TE>   "Delicious," Lucy said. "Fabulous."</TE>
<TE>   Then she remembered how our friend in Florence had announced, in
the most melodramatic tones, her appreciation of the Grattamacco when
she first tasted it with us. We didn't really understand her comment
then, but now -- grinning mischievously -- Lucy repeated it, in an
equally stentorian fashion.</TE>
<TE>   "The doctor," she proclaimed, "is in the house."</TE>

<HD>In Napa, things are getting nasty</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Russ Parsons</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>THE hottest topic in St. Helena right now isn't the latest one-acre
Cabernet. It's not the escalating price of vineyard land. It's not
the newest McMansion on Silverado Trail. It's a book. Go figure.</LD>
<LD>   Don't panic. Napa hasn't gone all literary on us. This isn't just
any book, but James Conaway's "The Far Side of Eden," and it's about
all of those things.</LD>
<LD>   The book begins with a bang with a deliciously gossipy portrait of
cult Cab maker Garen Staglin and his wife, Shari. They've designed
the Palladian pile of a villa they hacked out of the Mayacamas
Mountains to resemble a Tuscan hill town.</LD>
<TE>   "We've got a lot of lifestyle here," as Staglin says.</TE>
<TE>   The Staglins' neighbor, Jack Cakebread, who comes in for his own
share of pops, calls them "the Dennis Rodmans of the Napa Valley."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Cakebread was peeved because the Staglins leased their
house for the filming of the remake of "The Parent Trap" and the
lights, trailers and generators bugged him.</TE>
<TE>   When he complained, the Staglins wouldn't bend ("Wine is about all
these things," one of them is quoted as saying. "When you can say you
have had dinner with Garen and Shari, and talked about 'The Parent
Trap,' you've had a whole reinforcing experience.")</TE>
<TE>   So Cakebread went to his old friend Robert Mondavi for advice.
Mondavi was sympathetic, up to a point. Staglin had ponied up $1
million to help build Copia, Mondavi's pet project museum (which
earned Staglin presidency of the board of trustees and a tasting room
in his name).</TE>
<TE>   It will probably come as no surprise then that Conaway's first
public reading, which was announced as being at Copia, was canceled
(whether it was officially scheduled is a matter of dispute).</TE>
<TE>   And then so was the second reading, at a local movie theater. It
seems the owner is a high school friend of the wife of David Abreu,
vineyardist to the stars and a guy whom the book pictures as making a
minor specialty out of raping hillsides.</TE>
<TE>   And so it goes. The list of those skewered reads like a page from
some wine geek's cellar book: besides Mondavi, Cakebread, Abreu and
Staglin, there's Jayson Pahlmeyer, Delia Viader, Anne Colgin, Stuart
Smith, Randy Dunn and perhaps most extravagantly Francis Ford
Coppola, whom Conaway regards as being on the cutting edge of
cheapening Napa into a kind of vinous Disneyland.</TE>
<TE>   Probably about the only people in the area who are happy with the
book are those who avoided being included in it.</TE>
<TE>   It would be unfortunate, though, if all the fuss over gossip keeps
people from following the book's deeper story. While the first
section is easily the most fun, it is merely a setup for Conaway's
real purpose: examining the collision of tradition and what he sees
as its despoilers.</TE>
<TE>   An editor at Preservation magazine, Conaway first wrote about the
valley in his 1990 book, "Napa," which told in reverential tones of
the battles to prevent the suburbanization of the wine country
through the establishment of an agricultural preserve.</TE>
<TE>   The preservationists took that round, but a decade later they
might well be wondering exactly what it was they won. Having the Napa
Valley declared an agricultural preserve, with its restrictions on
minimum lot sizes, seems only to have succeeded in ensuring that land
could be bought by only the very rich.</TE>
<TE>   And there has been no shortage of them. Combine real estate
scarcity with the wealth generated by the '90s boom economy, and what
you've got is a very limited game that it seems everyone wants to
join. When vineyard land on the valley floor was completely consumed,
it drove those who were willing to pay quite literally up the
hillsides.</TE>
<TE>   And while hillside Cabernets may have grace and elegance, they
sometimes come at the cost of chopping down hundreds of native oaks
and "strip-mining" ecologically sensitive areas to establish the
vineyards.</TE>
<TE>   That Napa is an area of great natural as well as enological beauty
complicates matters. Wine lovers are not the only ones drawn to the
area. There is also a very active environmentalist community, and
there is a lot of money behind it as well. (The number of prominently
named trust funds that come into play on both sides of this little
drama might startle those who have never visited Santa Fe, N.M., or
Vail, Colo.)</TE>
<TE>   Wine versus runoff</TE>
<TE>   The environmentalists look at the Napa River and see silt rather
than steelheads. The counterargument offered by a well-made wine
convinces them not a whit. They want to impose restrictions on the
vineyards in order to protect the wildlife. Or, more accurately, they
want to see that the restrictions that already exist are enforced.</TE>
<TE>   That does not seem to be something the winemakers want to hear
about. A decade after leading the fight to protect the nature of the
valley by limiting residential development, many of them seem to have
become born-again property rights advocates. They own the land and
they can do with it what they want. Downstream, beware!</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the portrait that emerges of the winemaking community is
rarely flattering. Gorged on 20 years of adulation, squeezed by
economic realities (the cost of an acre of planted vineyard in Napa
Valley has gone from roughly $40,000 in 1990 to more than $120,000),
the winemakers who were yesterday's rugged agrarian pioneers come
across more like crabby old industrialists today.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the Napa wine crowd is ripe for satire. The rich have been
with them always, but it used to be that wine was made predominantly
by people of a certain rustic nobility who aspired to become
millionaires.</TE>
<TE>   Today it seems to be mainly made up of millionaires who aspire to
rustic nobility. They buy the land, they buy the vineyard manager,
they buy the winemaker, they put their names on the labels and
imagine themselves Rothschilds.</TE>
<TE>   As one of the ever-quotable Staglins says, referring to one of
their other businesses, "Windshields just don't do it the way wine
does."</TE>
<TE>   This is not to say that the opposition is angelic. Spending time
even in print with the Napa Sierra Club crowd is wearing. At a
certain point, you're tempted to throw up your hands, declare a pox
on both their houses and wish the valley were back planted to prunes
and walnuts.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the mystique</TE>
<TE>   On a certain level it's refreshing to see some of the varnish
stripped off guys like Cakebread and Mondavi, who is pictured as
being something of a puppet master behind the scenes. After decades
of overblown praise, a skeptical eye is welcome.</TE>
<TE>   Wine is a business, and a big one at that. When a fight over what
seems like a fractional percentage of a vineyard is revealed to have
consequences in the millions of dollars, some of the rustic charm
subsides.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, winemakers are not cotton farmers. They are,
some of them, making something of real beauty, something that
transcends mere commodity.</TE>
<TE>   And that is where "The Far Side of Eden" comes up short. The plain
fact is, Conaway doesn't get wine. Although he can imbue a tramp on a
scrubby hillside with an irresistible golden aura, he can't describe
a glass of wine without sarcastic quote marks ("his cabernet
sauvignon [was] described ... as possessing undertones of 'coffee and
chocolate' that mature into aromas of 'cedar and cigar box.' ").</TE>
<TE>   When he sips a glass of wine, he tastes a product, a symbol of
social status, or a family business -- like a hardware store. It's
never as anything more. He can tap his feet, but he doesn't hear the
music.</TE>
<TE>   This is not to say that because some of its members sometimes make
something very special, the entire wine industry should get a free
pass for all bad behavior. But land use is a complicated issue and it
is impossible to weigh the arguments fairly if you don't understand
that there are genuine passions on both sides.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, to Conaway winemaking is just another form of
manufacturing, one that takes the raw materials of land, water,
plants and sunshine and turns them into something for which some
people are willing to spend a lot of money.</TE>
<TE>   That he refuses to see it as more is both the book's blessing and
its curse.</TE>

<HD>Right to the heart of autumn</HD>
<DH>Forget the pumpkin. It's the seeds and oil that deliver a
rich flavor unmistakably of the season.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Regina Schrambling</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>RIGHT now, you can't blink without seeing pumpkins in the
supermarket, at the farmers market, even in restaurants, where they
are treated more as eye candy than food. They're the little round
reproach from the vegetable world, a truly seasonal food that any
serious cook should feel compelled to take home immediately and turn
into dinner.</LD>
<LD>   But even if the spirit is willing, the pumpkin's flesh is weak.
The average squash is mostly watery pulp, which works well enough in
a pie or a soup but is not worth wrestling with more than once a
year. I prefer the pumpkin's hidden assets, the ones you don't need a
cleaver and an afternoon to tap into. With a bag of pumpkin seeds and
a bottle of pumpkin seed oil, you can put the essence of autumn into
everything from salad to dessert.</LD>
<LD>   The seeds, often sold by the more seductive Mexican name pepitas,
are the poor man's pignoli. They are almost as meaty and rich as pine
nuts, but they sell for a fraction of the price ($3 to $5 a pound
compared with $10 to $15). You can exploit them much the same way,
ground in pesto or toasted as a garnish in salads, and you can take
them much further in salsas and sauces.</LD>
<TE>   The oil, which has only recently started turning up in markets, is
an amazing product, as far from Wesson as Scharffen Berger chocolate
is from Nestle's. It's dark and thick with a haunting flavor that
justifies the price (about $14 for a 250-milliliter bottle of Styrian
oil from Austria, for instance). You can use it like regular old
extra-virgin olive oil, in vinaigrettes, but it's more like walnut or
hazelnut oil. A little goes a long way. When you lightly glaze a
winter squash with it before roasting, the taste is pumpkin squared.</TE>
<TE>   I've been hooked on the seeds and the oil for a couple of years
now, but I only realized how versatile they are when I started
cooking for a big party a couple of weeks ago. There was no theme to
the menu beyond fall, and somehow the two ingredients worked their
way into almost every course. I toasted the seeds with a heavy
coating of cayenne, sugar and salt with the idea of setting them out
as snack with drinks, then realized they would be and they were the
hot and crunchy accent the rice salad with andouille and turkey
needed. A little pumpkin seed oil in the vinaigrette with orange and
thyme brought the flavors together even more.</TE>
<TE>   Another warm salad, with white beans, pancetta, rosemary and red
onion, also needed a little lift, so I used the oil on cubes of
butternut squash dusted with a little Aleppo chile powder, then
folded those in. And the last of the seeds went onto the
chocolate-cinnamon brittle for a cookie plate. Like pumpkin itself,
the seeds can go sweet and savory.</TE>
<TE>   You could extract the seeds from your own pumpkin and hull them,
but the best seeds are store-bought. You save hours, and you get
bigger kernels.</TE>
<TE>   Raw, the seeds taste like a good-for-you indulgence, but roasting
or toasting the seeds brings out a nuttier, warmer, richer flavor.
Most recipes advise toasting them in a dry saute pan over medium
heat, tossing them until they pop and brown, but I've found roasting
produces a more even crunch. About 10 minutes on a rimmed baking
sheet in a 375-degree oven is all it takes. Shake the pan often so
they don't burn.</TE>
<TE>   To flavor the seeds, you can just drizzle them with tamari before
you roast them. If you want a jazzier taste, coat them with a little
egg white to make salt and cayenne or curry powder adhere to each
seed. If you don't immediately eat every warm seed, you can save them
for a garnish, particularly for squash or pumpkin soup, or for the
crunch factor in a grated carrot salad (with a pumpkin oil
vinaigrette, of course).</TE>
<TE>   Unlike oily nuts, pumpkin seeds can be stored at room temperature
about as long as sugar. The oil, though, should be kept in the
refrigerator to keep it from turning rancid.</TE>
<TE>   If the seeds and oil lack anything, it's the glamour quotient of
the whole pumpkin. But this is one case where it's what's inside that
counts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chocolate-cinnamon brittle with pumpkin seeds</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 30 minutes, plus 20 minutes cooling</TE>
<TE>   Servings: About 2 dozen pieces</TE>
<TE>   Note: This recipe is from "Inspirations: The Girls Who Dish," a
collection by a group of Canadian chefs (Whitecap Books, $16.95).
Basically a super-crisp, oversized cookie, it breaks apart even
easier than nut brittle. Don't be tempted to leave out the cinnamon;
it's what makes the pumpkin seeds commune with the chocolate.</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</TE>
<TE>   1 ounce unsweetened chocolate, finely chopped</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</TE>
<TE>   1 egg</TE>
<TE>   1/3cup flour</TE>
<TE>   1/2cup raw, hulled pumpkin seeds</TE>
<TE>   1. Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Line an 18-by-12 1/2-inch
jellyroll pan or large baking sheet with parchment paper.</TE>
<TE>   2. Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the
cinnamon. Remove from the heat, add the chocolate and stir until it
is completely melted. Stir in the sugar, vanilla and egg, and mix
until smooth. Stir in the flour and beat well. Pour the batter into
the pan and spread as thin and evenly as possible (it may not cover
the entire surface). The mixture may have a slight elasticity, but it
will even out and adhere to the parchment paper as you continue with
the spreading. Sprinkle the pumpkin seeds evenly over the top.</TE>
<TE>   3. Bake until the brittle is just set, 20 minutes. Remove from the
oven and cool on a rack for 20 minutes. Break or cut into about 2
dozen rough pieces, as you would nut brittle. Store in an airtight
tin if not serving immediately.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Spiced pumpkin seeds</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 20 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 12 servings (3 cups)</TE>
<TE>   Note: These nuts can be served as a snack with drinks, alone or
mixed with fresh popcorn, or tossed into salads, green or otherwise.
They also make a good garnish for fish. Other spices, like cumin, can
be added, but the cayenne is important. The recipe is from "Creole
Flavors" by Kevin Graham (Artisan, 1996).</TE>
<TE>   3 cups raw, hulled pumpkin seeds</TE>
<TE>   1/2 small egg white</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon paprika</TE>
<TE>   Cayenne pepper</TE>
<TE>   1. Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Line 2 large,</TE>
<TE>   rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.</TE>
<TE>   2. Combine the pumpkin seeds and the half egg white in a very
large stainless steel bowl and toss to coat. Sprinkle the sugar,
salt, paprika and 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon cayenne over the seeds and toss
until well and evenly coated. Divide the seeds between the 2 prepared
sheets and spread out in an even layer.</TE>
<TE>   3. Bake the seeds 5 minutes. Remove the sheets from the oven and
shake or stir the seeds to keep them from sticking or burning. Return
them to the oven for 5 minutes, then stir or shake again. Repeat one
or two more times, until the seeds are crunchy but not browned.
They'll get crunchier after they've cooled. (They may clump a bit --
you can leave them that way or let them cool and then break them
apart.) Remove from the oven and cool on racks. Serve warm or store
indefinitely in airtight containers.</TE>

<LD>AUREOLE Las Vegas may be on to the next big thing.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of handing diners an unwieldy tome listing all 4,000 wines
in the restaurant's phenomenal cellar, Aureole presents them with a
handy computerized device. It's called the eWine Book, and the
restaurant claims it's the first wireless, Internet-based wine list.</LD>
<LD>   The list can be searched by color, style, grape, region, price,
vintage or bottle size. You can bookmark wines and come back to them,
or add (and delete) them from a virtual wine cart. In a dark
restaurant, the illuminated screen is easier to read than a
traditional wine list. And if someone buys the last bottle of Silver
Oak Cab, the inventory is immediately updated.</LD>
<TE>   Diners can also click on any dish from Aureole's menu and get a
list of a dozen or so wine recommendations, including some by the
glass. If you want to explore further, you can access the sommelier's
tasting notes (in non-wine-speak) and information about the producer
or the region.</TE>
<TE>   Or if you want to make it fast and simple, you can go straight to
your favorite Chardonnay.</TE>
<TE>   Aureole's wine director, Andrew Bradbury, a self-described
techno-geek, has spent the last six years playing with the idea of an
electronic wine list. But nothing quite worked the way he wanted
until wireless tablet technology came along, which allowed him to
have a continuously updated list, accessible from each hand-held
device.</TE>
<TE>   "I look at it as an electronic wine magazine," Bradbury says. "The
idea is to make wine fun and less intimidating."</TE>
<TE>   He's had a few technophobes come in who refused to consider
anything but a traditional printed list, but most guests are
intrigued.</TE>
<TE>   "Couples are soon sitting side by side playing with the electronic
tablet. And at larger tables, people are lined up three deep to get a
look," he says. "It's actually increased sommeliers' interaction with
guests because it puts people more at ease, especially after we give
them a quick demo of how it works."</TE>
<TE>   It's been such a hit that a few months ago, Bradbury installed the
eWine Book at Aureole New York as well. And in mid-November, he will
introduce an improved eWine Book with software designed from the
ground up. It will be smaller, lighter and faster, but because he's
developed this one with some major players in software and hardware,
details are under wraps until its official launch.</TE>
<TE>   What he will say is that it will have real-time video streaming
from the 42-foot glass wine tower in the restaurant. Now guests not
seated in direct view of the wine tower will be able to watch the
cat-suited "wine angels," one of whom is Bradbury's fiancee, retrieve
the very bottle they ordered from the tower's 10,000-bottle cache.
(And that's just 20% of Aureole's entire cellar). How cool is that?</TE>
<TE>   To test-drive the current eWine Book and tour the wine tower,
visit www.ewinetow er.com. You can even pre-order wines for a coming
visit to Aureole Las Vegas or start an e-mail dialogue with the
sommelier.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After a drumroll that has stretched out for months, the elegant
French restaurant Bastide is finally scheduled to open this evening.
It has not taken any reservations in advance, so there is no
preexisting waiting list.</LD>
<LD>   The kitchen will be headed by Alain Giraud, formerly of Citrus and
Lavande. The luxurious, serene decor includes heavy monogrammed
linens, parquet floors and designer Andree Putman's Tressage
dinnerware.</LD>
<LD>   There will be three prix-fixe menus: a traditional five-course
menu for $60, a five-course fig menu for $70 and the seven-course
Bastide menu for $90. A vegetarian menu is also available upon
request. The restaurant will be open for dinner Monday through Friday
with two seatings a night, closed on Saturday and Sunday for private
parties.</LD>

<TE>   Small bites</TE>
<TE>   Hisashi Yoshiara, the former chef of Jozu, has formed a
partnership with Jonathan Chu (formerly a staffer at Morton's and
Ginza-Sushi-Ko ) and Evan Silver (who helped build California Pizza
Kitchen from two to 75 restaurants). The partners are opening
Buddha's Belly where Rosti used to be on Beverly Boulevard in Los
Angeles. Its menu will include Pan-Asian dishes, sakes, Japanese
wines and Asian desserts. The opening is scheduled for mid-November
and the owners are hoping it will be the first in a series of
Buddha's Belly restaurants in Southern California.</TE>

<KH>THE REVIEW</KH>
<HD>It's a scene, and that's it</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"It's not about the food," my plugged-in friend whispers soothingly,
as we toy with our lamentable pizza, wondering what to do with it.
I'm also wondering why it took so long to arrive at our table. The
billowy crust resembles one of those pre-baked ones from the
supermarket. The molten coverlet of Fontina cheese and wild mushrooms
puts a contemporary spin on the pie, though.</LD>
<LD>   I'm reporting from dinner at yet another of Hollywood's hybrid
bar-restaurants. This one isn't exactly a club. There is, however, a
DJ spinning tunes out into this dramatic loft-like space (once, if
you can believe it, Fritzi's Vienna Hofbrau) on Sunset Boulevard, a
short stroll from the supermarket affectionately known as "Rock 'n'
Roll Ralph's."</LD>
<LD>   Falcon, named after Falcon Lair, the luxurious retreat of
sloe-eyed silent film star Rudolph Valentino, comes with a pedigree.
It isn't the fleeting reference to old Hollywood. It isn't the chef,
or even the architect or designer. It's the owners -- Tommy
Stoilkovich and Mike Garrett, whose other venues include Lounge 217,
Voda and Pearl Dragon -- who have the cachet in these perilously
trendy rapids.</LD>
<TE>   The stage is set for a scene</TE>
<TE>   Like North in Hollywood or Katana on the strip, Falcon is about
creating a setting where the young and hopeful can mingle. I say
"mingle" rather than "meet," because what I observed was so far from
a pickup scene it could have been a junior high dance. Girls with
painstakingly assembled looks stand around in uneasy herds or perch
on the edge of the bar's giant shaggy ottomans nursing pretty drinks.
Guys assemble in front of the outdoor patio's fireplace, smoking,
hardly talking, occasionally take a cell phone call, real or faked.
And along the banquette-bleacher built along one side of this
ballroom-sized space, blonds perch among the cushions like
bright-feathered birds, studiously oblivious to the goings-on in the
patio below.</TE>
<TE>   Needless to say, if Falcon is hip, it has to be hard to get in. So
every time I call for a reservation, they are fully booked -- unless,
of course, I want to come at 7, but how hip is that? At this sort of
place, the late-night scene is the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Even when I finally secure a reservation at 9 on a weeknight, the
mood is still somewhat subdued. Though there aren't many empty
tables, I suspect the crowds, like me, are here on a Wednesday
because they couldn't get in Thursday, Friday or Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   On one occasion, when I had the foresight to reserve a couple of
weeks in advance, I achieve a table on a weekend night -- at 9:30.
Getting in means running the usual gantlet of security vetting
would-be diners against the names on a clipboard. Only when they get
a match will they unhook the velvet rope that gives Falcon and its
ilk the illusion of exclusivity.</TE>
<TE>   We're in. We're strolling up the long concrete ramp to the
entrance lighted by flickering oil lamps. We check in with the hosts
and are offered a table on the patio close to the fire. The stylish
minimalist space strung with piazza lights is enclosed by smooth
concrete walls softened by a few languid plants and bracketed by a
fireplace and a small bar. A tall woven metal door adds a sculptural
element.</TE>
<TE>   As the evening wears on, and the guardians at the rope let more
people in, it begins to seem like a cocktail party down here with
guests sitting on the steps, thronging the bar and lining the
bleacher that runs just above the tables. And in this moment, it is a
great room. So L.A., so right now.</TE>
<TE>   Falcon may not be about the food, but it still requires a strategy
to make it through dinner. Order up a Cosmopolitan, stretch it out
judiciously, nibbling on the complimentary toasted almonds, olives
and "hand-picked" cherry tomatoes. What does that mean? That the chef
personally chose this yellow one to complement this red one?</TE>
<TE>   After a little while, you might order a pizza. The toppings are a
bit unconventional. For example, Falcon's take on the popular
margherita substitutes sun-dried tomatoes for fresh. A basil pesto
and pine nuts version could have worked, but the whole pie is so
pale, the cheese grated on top hasn't even melted.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, the menu is short and sweet and doesn't require much
attention. Lump crabmeat comes clumped into a tall cake, browned on
one side. If heirloom tomato gazpacho isn't listed, baby beet and
goat cheese salad may be the next best choice, even though the
arugula isn't too perky. Nothing in the "Falcon chopper" salad is as
fresh as it could be either, on the night I try it. The worst,
though, is the poached pear and endive salad drowned in cheap
balsamic vinegar.</TE>
<TE>   On our way down to the patio, we pass the DJ's booth where a kid
with spiky blond hair and elaborately tattooed arms is
enthusiastically digging into dinner.</TE>
<TE>   "What's that you've got there?" I can't help asking. "Hmm, let me
see," he answers, examining at his plate quizzically. "Rib-eye steak,
potatoes, and, ummm, carrots. Highly recommended!" Take a note.</TE>
<TE>   The steak, let's face it, can't hold a candle to Morton's or
Ruth's Chris aged prime. The quality is closer to what you find at
any normal supermarket, but it's nicely charred, served with fried
potatoes and a pretty parsley sauce. Ricotta cavatelli, a cross
between gnocchi and pasta tossed with red chard, fava beans and
artichokes, is decent too. The free-range chicken is moist,
soothingly bland, served with white corn grits.</TE>
<TE>   All in all, it's pretty unadventurous fare. No one is going to be
confronted with unfamiliar ingredients or bold flavors. The food is
so understated, in fact, it's hard to remember what you ate an hour
later. In fact, they don't want you to eat. They want you to drink.</TE>
<TE>   Waiting for the wait staff</TE>
<TE>   The minimum per person is a modest $15. That's just about enough
for an appetizer and dessert, or a couple of orders of homemade
potato chips (the best thing on the menu) and a cocktail.</TE>
<TE>   But the service! Though everyone, from hostesses to bus persons
and runners, is invariably pleasant, whatever you order is very slow
in coming. That includes, surprisingly, drinks and wine. My martini
takes so long to get to the table one night, it's already warm. As
soon as a waiter pours the last of the wine, he's already asking if
you'd like another bottle. Quite possibly because it takes so long to
find it in the first place. And, twice, runners tried to deliver our
main courses before we'd finished our appetizers.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the mysterious ice cream sandwich. Once it never
arrived. Another time, the server mumbled, "Tonight, it's honey ice
cream and some cookies, sort of a make-it-yourself ice cream
sandwich."</TE>
<TE>   Fine by me, but not with this revoltingly sweet honeycomb ice
cream. However, the molten chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream is a
fine rendition of Jean-George's famous "mistake." I just wish the ice
cream had arrived unmelted.</TE>
<TE>   The banana beignets aren't bad either. The surprise hit is
strawberry shortcake, which is not shortcake at all, but a sort of
clafoutis or batter cake topped with strawberries and cream.</TE>
<TE>   As we wait outside for our car after midnight, the three wild and
crazy guys we'd noticed earlier step into a high-end sports car with
the plates VRYHOT1 and roar off into the night. That's what Falcon is
about.</TE>

<LD>Dear SOS: On a recent trip to the theater I had a wonderful dinner at
Campanile. The Bibb salad was so simple and absolutely perfect. I
would love to have the recipe.</LD>
<LD>   Gretchen Alenin</LD>
<LD>   Newport Beach</LD>
<TE>   Dear Gretchen: This popular salad, created by Nancy Silverton, is
refreshingly simple but delicious. It's also quite pretty -- the
herbs add various shades of green.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Herb Salad</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 20 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 4</TE>
<TE>   Note: Fleur de sel is a French sea salt available at specialty
markets.</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup lemon juice plus 2 tablespoons (about 3 lemons)</TE>
<TE>   1 shallot, finely chopped (about 1 tablespoon)</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil plus 2 tablespoons</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon coarse salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly cracked pepper, to taste</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup fresh dill leaves, stems removed</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup fresh chervil leaves, stems removed</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup fresh tarragon leaves, stems removed</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup Italian parsley leaves, stems removed</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup finely chopped fresh chives</TE>
<TE>   2 heads Bibb lettuce, leaves separated and kept intact</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup pale green celery leaves (optional)</TE>
<TE>   Fleur de sel</TE>
<TE>   1. Combine the lemon juice and shallot in a small bowl, and allow
them to sit for about 10 minutes. Whisk in the olive oil, salt, and
pepper. Adjust the lemon juice, salt and pepper to taste.</TE>
<TE>   2. Separate out 1/4 cup each of the dill, chervil, tarragon and
parsley leaves and set aside. Finely chop the remaining quantity of
herbs and toss them together with all of the chives and the celery
leaves, if using.</TE>
<TE>   3. To assemble the salad, place a quarter of the lettuce leaves,
slightly overlapping, on a large platter, and drizzle a few
tablespoons of the dressing over them. Evenly scatter a quarter of

<LD>Theres a monster in the kitchen, and he's silk-screened on a hemp
apron. Designed by Naomi Grimes and Gloria Williamson, these aprons
come in two sizes -- a half-apron features a skeleton head, and a
full-length apron has a drooling monster. The aprons are machine wash
and dry -- so how scary is that?</LD>

<LD>The grapes are picked, the season is over. California's 2002 harvest
appears on track to produce some top wines. Even so, 50,000 tons of
grapes were left rotting on the vine, signs of a grape glut affecting
the industry.</LD>
<LD>   A record 3.2 million tons of grapes were harvested, according to
the California Department of Agriculture. The crop, one of the
largest on record, was up from 3 million tons last year due to a
sharp increase in new vineyards.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the combination of more grapes and a sluggish economy has
created the first significant grape glut in a decade.</LD>
<TE>   "The message is that we need fewer acres of grapes in California.
In many cases prices [offered by wineries] were below the cost of
production," says Barry Bedwell of Ciatti Grape Brokerage.</TE>
<TE>   For many growers, though, the quality of the vintage was
excellent. Despite the large total crop, a cool season caused lower
yields per acre than last year, especially in the cooler coastal
regions that typically produce the best wines. Lower yields --
lighter clusters and smaller grapes -- usually translate into
concentrated, flavorful wines.</TE>

<LD>Quick swirlRosso di Montalcino is the jazzy younger brother of
Brunello di Montalcino, one of Italy's most distinguished reds. While
Brunello must be aged for four years, Rosso, which is generally made
from younger Sangiovese Grosso vines, is released after only one
year. Fresh and light on its feet, it's a terrific wine in its own
right.</LD>
<LD>   The 2000 Rosso from top Brunello estate Pertimali has an
attractive scent of earth and black cherries and a beguiling balance
of fruit to tannin. (In Italy, everyone is raving about the 2000
Brunellos; if this Rosso is any indication of the quality of the
vintage, the Brunellos should fly off the shelves when they arrive
two years down the road.)</LD>
<LD>   Best of all, it's inexpensive enough to adopt as your house wine.</LD>

<TE>   Region: Tuscany.</TE>
<TE>   Price: About $19.</TE>
<TE>   Style: fresh, juicy red from Sangiovese grapes.</TE>

<HD>Activision Quarterly Net Surges on Sales</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alex Pham</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Powered by continued strength of its "Spider-Man" video game,
Activision Inc. posted a fourfold increase in net income on record
fiscal second-quarter sales.</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Monica game publisher recorded net income of $9.1
million, or 13 cents a share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, up from
$2.2 million, or 4 cents, a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by
Thomson First Call had expected Activision to earn 10 cents a share.
The nation's second-largest game publisher saw a 21% jump in sales
from a year earlier to $169.2 million.</LD>
<LD>   Activision Chief Executive Robert A. Kotick increased the
company's revenue forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31 to
$934 million from $920 million. He also boosted net income
projections to $1.29 a share from $1.25.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Activision, which released its results after the stock
market closed, lost a penny to $18.21 on Nasdaq but rose to $19.61 in
after-hours trading.</TE>
<TE>   Kotick also estimated that sales of game software for the overall
industry would grow 18% to 20% in 2002, followed by a 13% to 17%
growth in 2003. The estimate fell in between projections made last
week by THQ Inc., which estimated a 10% to 15% growth next year, and
Electronic Arts, which held a 20% overall growth target for the
industry in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Industry analysts say the lower estimates result from a lower
average price for games. As more consoles penetrate into mainstream
living rooms, consumers tend to be more price-sensitive.</TE>
<TE>   "When industry becomes more mass market, you have a decrease in
the average price of software," said Simon Price, analyst with
International Development Group in San Francisco.</TE>

<HD>Bausch Withholds Bonus From Its Chief Executive</HD>
<DH>Firm chooses to forgo $1.1-million payment rather than
accept resignation for false claim of graduating from business
school.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc. is withholding a $1.1-million bonus it had
promised Chief Executive Ron Zarrella rather than accept his offer to
resign for falsely claiming that he had graduated from business
school.</LD>
<LD>   The eye-care products maker's board of directors said in a letter
to Zarrella on Tuesday that "this lapse in judgment with regard to
your biography is a serious matter and cannot pass without
consequence."</LD>
<LD>   Citing its responsibilities to shareholders and 12,000 employees,
the board said Zarrella would forfeit an incentive bonus of at least
$1.1 million that it had agreed to pay him for 2002 when he was hired
last November.</LD>
<TE>   Zarrella, 53, offered to resign Monday for "the misrepresentation
in my official biography" that claimed he had graduated from New York
University's Stern School of Business in 1978. Zarrella attended the
MBA program from 1972 to 1976 but left without graduating.</TE>
<TE>   Zarrella said he was "anxious to assure" the company that the
inaccuracy "is not indicative of a pattern of behavior."</TE>
<TE>   "Quite the contrary, it stands out as a singular and
uncharacteristic lapse in judgment that I hope I can overcome in
time," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The board decided that a management change wasn't necessary,
saying that the firm's fortunes had improved. "We continue to believe
you are the right person to carry on the resurgence of the company,"
it said.</TE>
<TE>   "We make this decision, in part, on your unqualified
representation that there is no other issue of trust or veracity
about which we need to be concerned," it added.</TE>
<TE>   Bausch &amp; Lomb's stock briefly dropped almost 7% on Thursday when
the discrepancy was disclosed in TheStreet.com.</TE>

<HD>Enron Sues BofA Over Account Flap</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Enron Corp. on Tuesday sued Bank of America Corp., claiming the bank
unlawfully took more than $123 million from its bank account as the
energy company spiraled into insolvency.</LD>
<LD>   Last November, days before Enron's bankruptcy filing, Bank of
America "effected a series of unauthorized withdrawals from an Enron
bank account which deprived Enron and its creditors of essential
operating funds," the lawsuit said.</LD>
<LD>   Bank of America denied Enron access to its bank accounts, refused
to answer questions and failed to provide an explanation until months
later, the suit says.</LD>
<TE>   Enron was reeling at the time after revealing a network of
off-the-books partnerships used to hide debts and inflate profit. In
December, Enron filed what was then the largest Chapter 11 bankruptcy
in history.</TE>
<TE>   Shirley Norton, a Bank of America spokeswoman in San Francisco,
said the bank has not seen the lawsuit and cannot comment on it.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Charlotte, N.C.-based Bank of America fired three
employees who oversaw the bank's dealings with Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Enron is asking U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez to order
Bank of America to turn over more than $123.1 million. The
Houston-based company also is seeking punitive damages, a downgrade
of the bank's claims against Enron and legal costs.</TE>

<HD>Clear Channel Posts Profit as Ad Sales Rebound</HD>
<DH>The media company surpasses Wall Street's expectations for
the third quarter, but attendance slips at its entertainment events.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Leeds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Radio giant Clear Channel Communications Inc. swung to a
third-quarter profit because of a rebound in advertising sales, but
the company said Tuesday that revenue growth had been restrained by
lower attendance at its live-entertainment events.</LD>
<LD>   The radio station chain said net income for the third quarter
ended Sept. 30 jumped to $213 million, or 34 cents a share, up from a
loss of $232 million, or 39 cents a share, for the same period a year
earlier.</LD>
<LD>   The earnings beat Wall Street's estimate of 32 cents a share.</LD>
<TE>   Clear Channel announced its results before the stock market
opened.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of the San Antonio-based company rose 5 cents on Tuesday to
$37.80 on the New York Stock Exchange. So far this year Clear
Channel's shares have fallen 26%.</TE>
<TE>   Sales for the most recent quarter rose to $2.34 billion, up 2%
from $2.30 billion in the year-earlier period.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say Clear Channel had relatively easy comparisons to beat
because of last year's anemic third quarter, when advertisers scaled
back their spending after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The company said last year that it had lost an estimated $30
million in sales in the 10 days after the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel's results also received help from changes in
accounting rules this year that lowered its amortization expenses. If
the rule had been in place last year, net income for the third
quarter would have been $119 million, or 20 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel said it lifted prices for advertising across its
1,200 radio stations, which helped fuel an 11% radio revenue increase
to $964 million.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue increased 12% at the company's outdoor division, which
controls about 700,000 billboards and other ad spaces.</TE>
<TE>   "The fundamentals of our business are sound," said Clear Channel
Chief Executive Lowry Mays.</TE>
<TE>   But quarterly sales for Clear Channel's entertainment division,
which promotes concerts and other live events, dropped 16%, to $789.8
million.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel President Mark Mays blamed the drop-off on a decline
in attendance but said revenue sources including sponsorships and
concessions offset the loss to a degree.</TE>
<TE>   Company executives said they are trying to trim the company's debt
load.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel said it had long-term debt of $9 billion at the end
of the third quarter and had $2.6 billion in credit lines available
under three domestic bank facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Mays said he expected revenue to continue rising through the
fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   He told analysts that "there's no reason for you to anticipate
that [our] momentum is going to stop."</TE>

<HD>EarthLink Reports Narrowed Net Loss</HD>
<DH>Broadband revenue jumps as the number of subscribers to
high- speed Web access climbs. Total revenue for the third quarter
rises 7%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Glenda McCarthy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>EarthLink Inc. said Thursday that its net loss narrowed substantially
in the third quarter as a surge in sales of high-speed Internet
access offset declining sales of slower dial-up service.</LD>
<LD>   The No. 3 Internet service provider said cost controls also helped
pare its net loss to $30.1 million, or 20 cents a share, from a loss
of $84.4 million, or 62 cents, a year earlier. Revenue in the three
months ended Sept. 30 rose 7% to $340.7 million from $319 million.</LD>
<LD>   EarthLink impressed analysts with its addition of 77,000 broadband
subscribers during the quarter for a total of 681,000, up 68% from a
year earlier. Broadband revenue, which makes up nearly 20% of the
company's total, rose 48%. Meanwhile, EarthLink lost 100,000
subscribers to its dial-up services as the total narrow-band
subscriber base fell 5.2% to 3.98 million.</LD>
<TE>   "The results show that they are managing the business successfully
despite the industrywide maturing of the dial-up business," said Fred
Moran, media analyst with Jefferies &amp; Co. Moran doesn't own stock in
the company. Jefferies &amp; Co.'s investment bank does business with
EarthLink and makes a market in its stock.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta-based EarthLink, which employs about 1,700 people in
Pasadena, said it's benefiting from improved customer service as well
as the cost cuts.</TE>
<TE>   But the company lowered its guidance for the full year, citing
sluggish growth and increased spending on marketing during the fourth
quarter. EarthLink said it now expects a loss, excluding certain
charges, of 21 cents to 25 cents a share for the year on revenue of
$1.35 billion to $1.37 billion. In July, the company forecast a loss
of 15 cents to 22 cents a share on revenue of $1.4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The results were announced before the close of trading. EarthLink
shares rose 2 cents to $5.37 in regular Nasdaq trading.</TE>

<HD>CEO Says Ford Will Cut Further</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ford Motor Co. Chief Executive William Clay Ford Jr. told investors
Tuesday that he would begin to review proposals to cut an additional
$1 billion in costs.</LD>
<LD>   He also told the investors at a Los Angeles meeting that next
year's market for new passenger cars and light trucks "looks like it
may not be great."</LD>
<LD>   Ford, speaking at one of a series of shareholder meetings that
began last week, said the list of potential cost reductions has "come
together quite nicely" and will be reviewed starting Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   Ford said last week that the new cuts would be deeper than the $9
billion in cost reductions the world's second-largest automaker
announced in January. Those cuts are to occur by 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Without giving specifics, he said the company was "not projecting
a terribly strong market" in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no idea what is going to happen," he said. "We can't
forecast October."</TE>
<TE>   The company had a loss of $5.45 billion in 2001, prompting Ford to
announce his restructuring plan in January. The proposal calls for
eliminating jobs, closing plants and introducing new models to
generate $7 billion in annual pretax profits by 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Only last month Ford said that the company planned to build more
vehicles because demand in the U.S. was growing.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to increase production slightly in the fourth
quarter," Ford had told a car industry conference at the time.
"September sales are OK."</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, the company posted a $326-million loss in the third
quarter, although its results before one-time expenses topped Wall
Street predictions.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of the Dearborn, Mich.-based automaker fell 43 cents to
$8.35 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has fallen 47% this
year.</TE>

<HD>'Girls Club' Is Canceled by Fox</HD>
<DH>The drama from writer David Kelley was a ratings dud. It's
the second show this fall that didn't make it to its third episode.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Brownfield</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>News Corp.'s Fox has canceled "Girls Club," the drama from writer
David E. Kelley that the slumping network was hoping would inject new
life into its prime-time lineup. Instead, it was a ratings dud in its
two weeks on the air, finishing sixth in its time period Monday
night. The show was produced by David E. Kelley Productions and 20th
Century Fox Television.</LD>
<LD>   "Girls Club," which aired at 9 p.m., this week lost nearly 1
million viewers -- to fewer than 5 million -- and gave up more than
half the audience that tuned in for Kelley's "Boston Public" in the
preceding hour. That left Fox finishing behind the WB and UPN
networks.</LD>
<LD>   "While I am disappointed that the show did not succeed, I remain
proud of the entire cast and crew of 'Girls Club,' " Kelley said in a
statement.</LD>
<TE>   Fox will air a rerun of "Boston Public" next week and specials
through the duration of the November sweeps. For Kelley, the
writer-creator behind ABC's "The Practice" and Fox's "Ally McBeal,"
"Girls Club" represents the second short-lived show of his otherwise
successful career. His "Snoops" was canceled by ABC after less than a
season in 1999-2000.</TE>
<TE>   "Girls Club" also is the second show this fall that didn't make it
to its third episode. This month, ABC yanked "That Was Then" after
two Friday airings.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. bank regulators on Tuesday announced a settlement, including
$325,000 in penalties, with ACE Cash Express and the parent of
California-based Goleta National Bank over "unsound" payday-lending
practices.</LD>
<LD>   ACE makes and collects payday loans for Goleta in 18 states. ACE,
in a settlement with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,
agreed to end its payday-lending business through Goleta. It also
promised not to provide payday lending through any national bank
without the comptroller's approval.</LD>
<LD>   In a typical payday loan, a borrower writes a postdated check to
the lender, to be cashed on the borrower's next payday, and walks out
with cash. The loans have been highly lucrative for many of the
lenders because of the rates and fees charged.</LD>
<TE>   The comptroller's office said its action was prompted in part by
ACE's handling of hundreds of customer loan files, which were thrown
into a Portsmouth, Va., trash dumpster in August.</TE>
<TE>   ACE agreed to pay $250,000 in penalties, and Goleta's parent,
Community West Bancshares of Goleta, Calif., agreed to pay $75,000.</TE>

<HD>Guitar Center Net Income Soars</HD>
<DH>The retailer tops profit estimates on cost cutting and
same-store sales. But the revenue increase is lower than expected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Musical instruments and products retailer Guitar Center Inc. on
Tuesday posted sharply higher third-quarter net income, helped by
cost containment and an increase in same-store sales, but the
company's revenue increase was lower than expected.</LD>
<LD>   The Westlake Village-based company posted net income of $4.4
million, or 19 cents a share, compared with $1.4 million, or 6 cents,
in the third quarter of 2001. Net sales rose 13% to $257.4 million.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts on average had expected the company to report net income
of 18 cents a share and revenue of $262.6 million.</LD>
<TE>   The company reported earnings after the close of markets. Its
stock fell $1 in after-hours trading. It had closed at $20, up 25
cents, on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Although Guitar Center reported a 6% increase in same-store sales,
it said that its band instrument and combo products did not sell as
well as expected and that its direct response retail operations had
softer-than-expected results.</TE>
<TE>   Guitar Center expects fourth-quarter net sales of $327 million to
$331 million and earnings per share in the range of 51 cents to 54
cents.</TE>
<TE>   Guitar Center said it has not attempted to forecast the effect of
the court-ordered liquidation of its rival Mars Music chain. But
analysts said the liquidation should be positive for the company over
the long term.</TE>
<TE>   "In the next 30 days, they may be impacted by the liquidation as
the Mars stores sell at or below cost, which may put some pressure on
[Guitar Center] sales and gross margins in those regions," said
Justin Cable, analyst with B. Riley &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   But over the long term, Cable expects the effect to be beneficial.</TE>
<TE>   "They could make up for any near-term losses from the liquidation
after the Mars stores are completely closed, given that hopefully
these Mars stores are closed by December," he said.</TE>

<HD>Koizumi Supports Plan to Clean Up Japanese Banks' Bad-Loan
Problem</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press and Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi on Tuesday endorsed a contentious
plan to clean up the nation's banks, giving a major boost to his
embattled financial services minister, who has met with fierce
opposition to his get-tough approach on Japan's bad-loan problem.</LD>
<LD>   Heizo Takenaka, who became the country's chief banking regulator
just one month ago, was forced to delay releasing the draft of his
widely anticipated bad-loan plan last week after fierce objections
from ruling party lawmakers.</LD>
<LD>   "I approved [Takenaka's] basic policy," Koizumi said after meeting
with Takenaka. Koizumi, who has just returned from an economic forum
with other leaders held in Mexico, added, "I instructed that final
coordinations be made with the ruling parties in line with Takenaka's
plan."</LD>
<TE>   Takenaka told reporters he and the reformist minister stood
"firmly on common ground with regard to accelerating the disposal of
nonperforming loans."</TE>
<TE>   Koizumi's support comes in the nick of time for Takenaka, who is
set to release his proposal today.</TE>
<TE>   The plan is expected to urge stricter accounting rules on how
banks calculate their capital, but it is still unclear when such
reforms would be implemented.</TE>
<TE>   The original draft plan would have reportedly slapped banks with a
new rule toughening accounting requirements on deferred-tax assets --
the right to reduce future tax payments for current loan losses.</TE>
<TE>   But banks, some of which would face bankruptcy if the rules were
tightened, have protested that it would amount to changing the rules
mid-game.</TE>
<TE>   Japan's biggest lenders relied on deferred-tax assets for almost
half of their top-tier capital as of March 31, according to a central
bank report earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   Takenaka told Koizumi he may postpone such measures or introduce
them gradually, according to Japan's NHK-TV.</TE>
<TE>   Japan's banks are weighed down by about $336 billion in
nonperforming loans, equaling about 8% of the nation's gross domestic
product. Analysts say they impede growth by keeping banks from
lending to new borrowers and creating doubts about Japan's financial
system.</TE>
<TE>   Finance Minister Masajuro Shiokawa, other economic ministers and
Bank of Japan Gov. Masaru Hayami on Monday discussed plans to ease
the pain of possible corporate failures due to bad-loan disposals by
the nation's banks. These include measures to encourage companies to
hire new workers and to help small businesses borrow.</TE>
<TE>   The government may need to allocate funds for a new institution
that would aid still-viable companies, Shiokawa said. Someone from
the private sector should head the institution, he said, adding that
it should be separate from the Resolution and Collection Corp.,
Japan's bad-loan buying body.</TE>
<TE>   But any new government spending would force Koizumi to break his
pledge to limit new government bond sales this fiscal year to $243
billion. Japan already labors under a heavy public debt load.</TE>

<HD>Boeing to Vacate Kilroy Building in El Segundo</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kilroy Realty Corp., which cut its 2002 earnings estimates because of
a tenant's financial problems, said Tuesday that its largest tenant,
Boeing Co., plans to vacate a Kilroy building in El Segundo.</LD>
<LD>   The world's biggest airplane maker, which cut 30,000 jobs over the
last year, plans to leave the 248,000-square-foot building in
February, said John Kilroy Jr., the developer's president and chief
executive. Boeing's satellite business, which has been hit by lower
demand, has been based there.</LD>
<LD>   Boeing leases 1.1 million square feet from Kilroy, representing
10.3% of the company's annual base rental revenue.</LD>
<TE>   Kilroy's shares fell 44 cents to $21.06 on the New York Stock
Exchange and are down 20% this year. Kilroy's third-quarter net
income fell 15% to $7.9 million, or 28 cents a share, from $9.3
million, or 34 cents, in the same period last year.</TE>
<TE>   In July, Kilroy cut its forecast saying financial troubles at
another tenant, Peregrine Systems Inc., might lead to lower
occupancy. The software company has since rejected three of its five
leases in Kilroy buildings in the San Diego area.</TE>
<TE>   Kilroy is negotiating with Boeing to renew a lease that expires at
the end of the year on 211,000 square feet of space next to the
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Boeing said it would vacate
that space.</TE>
<TE>   The realty firm plans to take the El Segundo building "out of
service and renovate" it, Kilroy said.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Recover From Early Sell-Off</HD>
<DH>Discouraging report about consumer confidence triggers
another flood of money into Treasury market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A plunge in consumer confidence incited another wave of profit-taking
Tuesday on Wall Street, but stocks largely recovered by late in the
session as buyers returned.</LD>
<LD>   In the bond market, yields tumbled anew on Treasury securities as
the confidence report boosted some investors' hopes that the Federal
Reserve will cut short-term interest rates next week.</LD>
<LD>   The stock market took a sharp hit early in the day after the
Conference Board said consumer confidence fell in October to a
nine-year low. The report sent the Dow Jones industrials as low as
8,198, a drop of 170 points, or 2%.</LD>
<TE>   The market struggled for much of the session after the early
slide. But buyers rushed back in during the final 90 minutes, driving
the Dow to a close of 8,368.94, a gain of 0.90 point on the day.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite index lost 15.29 points, or 1.2%, to
1,300.54, but it had been down as much as 36 points.</TE>
<TE>   By the close, losers still outnumbered winners by 17 to 14 on
Nasdaq and by 18 to 14 on the New York Stock Exchange, but that was a
considerable improvement in breadth from early in the day.</TE>
<TE>   "Barring something really big or really unexpected, the bad news
is in this market" already, Brian Pears, head of equity trading at
Victory Capital Management in Cleveland, told Bloomberg News. That's
why the early sell-off wasn't sustained, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing new here. We all knew consumers were worrying
about the decline in the stock market and the geopolitical
situation," said Peter Cardillo, chief strategist at Global Partner
Securities Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Still, analysts said investors remain jittery after the powerful
rally of mid-October that lifted stocks from five-year lows. Several
major rallies have ensued since the bear market began in March 2000,
but all have fizzled relatively quickly.</TE>
<TE>   The confidence report triggered another flood of money into the
Treasury market, as traders and investors bet the Fed now has more
reason to reduce its benchmark short-term interest rate from the
current 40-year low of 1.75%. The Fed meets on Nov. 6.</TE>
<TE>   "The bond market is looking for one rate cut, but it may take two
or three to get things going -- it all depends on the consumer," Gary
Pzegeo, money manager at Gannett Welsh &amp; Kotler in Boston, told
Bloomberg News. "We may need more, not less Fed, and that means bonds
can continue to rally."</TE>
<TE>   That sentiment drove the yield on the two-year T-note to 1.76%
Tuesday, down from 1.89% Monday and the lowest since Oct. 10.</TE>
<TE>   The yield on the 10-year T-note -- a benchmark for mortgage rates
-- dropped to 3.94% from 4.09% Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Yields had soared in mid-October as stocks recovered and investors
figured the Fed probably wouldn't ease credit further. But economic
reports in recent weeks have painted a picture of an economy that has
lost its momentum.</TE>
<TE>   The 10-year T-note hit a generational low of 3.57% on Oct. 9, then
rocketed to 4.26% by Oct. 22.</TE>
<TE>   Among Tuesday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Airline stocks were broadly lower after rebounding for much of
the last week. UAL, parent of United Airlines, lost 23 cents to
$2.27, while Delta Air Lines fell 24 cents to $10.11 and Southwest
was down 68 cents to $14.72.</TE>
<TE>   * Energy stocks tumbled with crude prices. Exxon Mobil gave up
$1.41 to $33.23 and Unocal lost $1.44 to $26.96.</TE>
<TE>   * On the plus side, Procter &amp; Gamble jumped $3.26 to $89.01 and
Estee Lauder advanced $1.70 to $29.06 after each company posted
third-quarter earnings that beat expectations.</TE>
<TE>   * Tenet Healthcare continued to slide after an analyst's downgrade
hammered the stock Monday. The shares dropped $3.25 to $39.25 after
falling $6.81 on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   * European markets suffered heavy losses, hit by the U.S. consumer
confidence report, which was released near the close of European
trading. The German market dropped 5.5% while the British market sank
3.8%.</TE>

<HD>Artists' Bill Proposed in New York</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chuck Philips</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New York lawmakers have proposed a bill that could open the door on
free-agency contracts for recording artists.</LD>
<LD>   The Artistic Freedom Act was introduced Monday by New York State
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, with the backing of
powerful unions such as the American Federation of Television and
Radio Artists and the AFL-CIO.</LD>
<LD>   New York State Assembly members Roger L. Green, Joe Morelle and
Catherine Nolan, all Democrats, also signed on to the bill, which
would limit recording contracts to seven years.</LD>
<TE>   The move comes two months after a similar bill died in the
California Senate. Lawmakers in Sacramento have vowed to resurrect a
proposal that would not only reform music contracts but also regulate
accounting practices, health-care benefits and pensions in the music
industry.</TE>
<TE>   The New York bill was championed by entertainment attorney L.
Londell McMillan and the Artist Empowerment Coalition, a New
York-based nonprofit group that includes dozens of music stars such
as Prince and Stevie Wonder.</TE>
<TE>   The coalition staged a concert Monday evening in New York to raise
awareness about artists' rights, followed by a news conference
Tuesday joined by union leaders from AFTRA, the AFL-CIO and the
American Federation of Musicians.</TE>

<HD>Crude Oil Falls on U.N. Iraq Debate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Crude oil prices slid to 2 1/2-month lows Tuesday as the United
Nations Security Council sought agreement on a resolution authorizing
the return of weapons inspectors to Iraq for the first time in four
years.</LD>
<LD>   "The slow-moving diplomatic efforts are taking away the immediacy
of an attack" on Iraq by the United States, said John Kilduff, senior
vice president of energy risk management at Fimat USA Inc. "This is
helping take away some of the war premium that's propped up prices."</LD>
<LD>   Crude oil futures for December delivery fell 43 cents to end at
$26.86 a barrel in New York. That's the lowest price since Aug. 9,
and is down 13% from the peak of $30.83 reached Oct. 1.</LD>
<TE>   Hans Blix, the chief U.N. arms inspector, favors a U.S. provision
that calls for "serious consequences" if the Iraqis don't cooperate
with the search for weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   France, Russia and China want a chance to evaluate the inspections
before authorizing military action.</TE>
<TE>   "The United Nations realizes it's decision-making time," White
House spokesman Ari Fleischer told reporters. Fleischer said while
the U.S. "doesn't rule out" a Security Council vote next week on the
U.S.-sponsored resolution, the Bush administration has set no
deadline.</TE>
<TE>   Oil prices still are up 35% this year partly on concern that an
attack on Iraq would disrupt exports from the Persian Gulf.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of politics and tension in this market," Bijan
Namdar Zanganeh, Iran's oil minister, said at a conference in Tehran.
"Based on the fundamentals, we have no shortage in the market," he
said. "In fact, we have oversupply."</TE>

<HD>Big Brokerages Likely to Back Research Plan</HD>
<DH>The reform proposal to force the firms to hand out stock
advice from competitors would help resolve allegations of analyst
misconduct.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Walter Hamilton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK -- Major Wall Street brokerages are expected to agree in
theory today to a proposal that would force them to hand out stock
research done by competing firms, the first step toward resolving
allegations of widespread analyst misconduct, sources said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The plan would require large brokerages, such as Citigroup's
Salomon Smith Barney and Morgan Stanley, to make available to their
individual-investor customers research reports written by independent
firms, in addition to the brokerages' own research. The plan also
calls on the big firms to contribute to a fund that would subsidize
the work of the boutique firms.</LD>
<LD>   The plan was unveiled Thursday by federal and state regulators in
settlement talks aimed at resolving multiple government probes of
stock analysts' conduct in the bull market of the late 1990s.</LD>
<TE>   Those investigations have revealed that analysts at firms
including Salomon Smith Barney, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and Credit Suisse
First Boston felt pressured to recommend stocks solely to please
their firms' investment bankers, who were competing to attract
fee-rich underwriting business from companies.</TE>
<TE>   By forcing brokerages to distribute the work of independent
research rivals -- firms that do not have investment-banking arms --
regulators hope to prod the larger firms into giving more reliable
and less biased advice on stocks.</TE>
<TE>   The regulators gave the major brokerages until today to respond to
the basic outline of the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   The big brokerages will notify regulators that the "framework is
acceptable," one source said. That would lead to another meeting of
the parties on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   However, the consent of the firms today would be only the initial
step toward a hoped-for "global" settlement of analyst
conflict-of-interest charges, and many obstacles would remain,
sources said.</TE>
<TE>   The firms would agree today only to the basic idea, with many
details still in dispute among the firms themselves.</TE>
<TE>   For example, there are wide differences of opinion among the
brokerages over the amount each should pay to fund the smaller firms'
research, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   According to some reports, the dozen or so largest brokerages
would be expected to pay as much as $1 billion in total over five
years.</TE>
<TE>   Firms that cater only to large institutional investors have argued
that they should not pay as much as those that have millions of
individual investors as clients.</TE>
<TE>   Also, some brokerages that have not been implicated in wrongdoing
by the various federal and state probes of analysts' practices have
objected to paying large fines and to implementing far-reaching
reforms, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   The plan could be good for investors in the long run, said John
Coffee, a Columbia University law professor.</TE>
<TE>   "It would give investors more independent research," he said.
"More information is better than less."</TE>
<TE>   The proposal was pitched to the brokerages Thursday by Stephen
Cutler, the Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement chief,
and Eliot Spitzer, New York's attorney general.</TE>
<TE>   The plan calls for a consultant or panel of consultants to oversee
independent stock research distributed by the major brokerages. The
panel would collect the payments from the large firms, contract for
research with the independent firms and ensure that no new conflicts
of interest arise that would harm investors.</TE>

<HD>Reliant Says Earnings Fell in 3rd Quarter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reliant Resources Inc. said third-quarter earnings fell from weak
wholesale power profit and the cost of completing its spinoff from
parent company CenterPoint Energy Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Reliant posted earnings of $58 million, or 20 cents a share, down
from $214 million, or 71 cents, a year ago. This year's period
included $153 million in charges related to the spinoff and Texas'
transition to deregulated retail electricity sales.</LD>
<LD>   The company also said a review of its trading business uncovered
four related natural gas swap deals that should not have been
recorded.</LD>
<TE>   The deals cut income by about $13 million in 2000 and increased it
by the same amount in 2001, it said.</TE>
<TE>   The internal review was sparked by several government
investigations.</TE>
<TE>   The Houston-based firm also dropped its 2002 full-year earnings
estimates to a range of $1.45 to $1.55 a share. The earlier forecast
had been $1.80 to $2.00 a share.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Rhode Island judge declared a mistrial in a lawsuit against
companies that used to make lead-based paint, after a jury failed to
decide whether lead paint should be declared a public nuisance.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Michael Silverstein sent the jurors home after four days of
deliberation ended in deadlock, handing a major victory to DuPont
Co., Sherwin-Williams Co. and other former lead-paint makers or their
successors, which could have faced millions of dollars in damages.</LD>
<LD>   Rhode Island Atty. Gen. Sheldon Whitehouse's office said it
intends to retry the case.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of DuPont rose 60 cents to $41.20, and shares of
Sherwin-Williams rose $3.12 to $27.68, both on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>Visitor numbers at Euro Disney's new theme park outside Paris have
failed to pick up as the company had hoped, say analysts who are
scaling down attendance and profit forecasts for next year.</LD>
<LD>   The Walt Disney Studios that opened in March was originally
flagged as a crowd-puller that would lift total visitors to the two
neighboring parks to 16 million to 17 million by 2002-03. Some
analysts lowered estimates to 14.2 million.</LD>
<LD>   The group, which reports full-year results Nov. 13, declined to
comment.</LD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oil giant BP said third-quarter profit rose 79%, and cut its 2002 oil
and gas output forecast for the third time in eight weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Quarterly net income rose to $2.84 billion, or 13 cents a share,
mainly from gains from the sale of its stake in Germany's Ruhrgas.
Excluding special items and reflecting the current cost of supply,
profit slid 13% to $2.29 billion, at the low end of analysts'
forecasts.</LD>
<LD>   London-based BP lowered its target for full-year growth in
production of oil and gas to about 3%, down from 5.5% as recently as
July.</LD>
<TE>   The company has cited operating difficulties at facilities in
Alaska, the Rocky Mountains and the North Sea, as well as storms in
the Gulf of Mexico, for the scaled-back growth targets.</TE>
<TE>   BP's stock fell $2.67, or 7%, to $36.78 on the NYSE.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Nvidia Corp. engineer Robert Prevett illegally made $595,000 on stock
trades before his company announced a contract to provide graphics
chips for Microsoft Corp.'s Xbox video game system, prosecutors said.</LD>
<LD>   "The evidence will show Mr. Prevett got so wrapped up in the stock
market that he couldn't resist trading," said Assistant U.S. Atty.
John Hemann in an opening statement in Prevett's insider trading
trial.</LD>
<LD>   Prevett is the only one of 11 Nvidia employees charged with
securities fraud last November to go to trial. He faces two counts of
insider trading and one count of illegally passing stock tips to his
then-girlfriend and her father. If convicted, Prevett faces up to 10
years in prison and a $1-million fine.</LD>

<LD>The Santa Monica developer that built the Aquarium of the Pacific in
Long Beach and Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco won the job of
overseeing a $1.2-billion housing, retail and aquarium project in
London.</LD>
<LD>   The London Development Agency ratified a contract Tuesday with KUD
International to make the Santa Monica firm master developer of a
6-million-square-foot project called Silvertown Quays on 50 acres
near City Airport in eastern London.</LD>
<LD>   KUD's experience building large-scale aquariums in Long Beach and
Tampa, Fla., gave it the edge over more than 20 competitors, said
Marvin Suomi, president and chief executive. KUD is a subsidiary of
New York-based Kajima USA, an arm of Japanese construction company
Kajima Corp.</LD>
<TE>   Silvertown Quays is a massive redevelopment project on the site of
the former Royal Docks owned by the city that will be on the scale of
London's huge Canary Wharf office and retail complex.</TE>
<TE>   Silvertown Quays will be primarily a residential development with
3,500 units. Most of them will be sold at market rate, but 30% of the
units will be sold at discounts to low-income families and public
service workers such as police, firefighters and teachers, who often
find themselves priced out of the city.</TE>
<TE>   The development's centerpiece will be the 150,000-square-foot
National Aquarium, which will be operated by the Zoological Society
of London. KUD will pay for the $200-million aquarium from the profit
it makes from developing the housing, and has guaranteed its
completion. The entire project will take about eight years to
complete.</TE>
<TE>   Suomi declined to disclose KUD's expected profit from Silvertown
Quays</TE>
<TE>   The London Development Agency has deeded the land to KUD, which
will coordinate all aspects of the development, including selecting
architects, engineers and other consultants; obtaining permits;
hiring general contractors and managing construction.</TE>
<TE>   It will take about a year to complete the city's development
approval process and start construction, Suomi said.</TE>
<TE>   The first phase of the project, including the aquarium and 150,000
square feet of entertainment-oriented retail space, should be
finished by mid-2006, Suomi said.</TE>
<TE>   KUD also is involved in the development of a football stadium for
the Philadelphia Eagles and a rain forest exhibit for the California
Science Center in Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>France Opens Probe Into Vivendi</HD>
<DH>Based on shareholder complaints, the investigation will
look at whether financial reports were falsified.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Verrier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Paris prosecutor's office has launched a criminal probe into
whether media giant Vivendi Universal misled investors by falsifying
financial results during the last two years.</LD>
<LD>   The prosecutor's office said that the preliminary inquiry will
examine whether Vivendi published "false accounts" for 2000 and 2001
to conceal its financial crisis, which came to a head this summer
when the world's second-largest media company nearly ran out of cash.
The investigation also will address whether the Paris-based owner of
Universal Studios and Universal Music Group issued "factually
misleading outlooks" for 2001 and 2002.</LD>
<LD>   The inquiry is not the equivalent of a U.S. Justice Department
probe. Under French law, class-action complaints are handled through
the prosecutor's office, not in the civil courts as in the United
States. French authorities are required by law to investigate all but
frivolous claims.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, some close to Vivendi sought to portray the prosecutor's
action as a routine step.</TE>
<TE>   Still, one expert noted that the threshold for successfully
lodging a class-action complaint in France is relatively high, and
that it's unusual to have such a high-profile company caught up in a
case such as this.</TE>
<TE>   "Such criminal probes at this level are relatively rare," said
Florencio Lopez-de-Silanes, professor of finance at the Yale School
of Management. "It's pretty big.... Vivendi is one of those companies
that is a symbol of France."</TE>
<TE>   The investigation stems from a previously reported complaint
brought by a group of French shareholders on July 18 alleging that
Vivendi, under former Chief Executive Jean-Marie Messier, issued
"false financial information that led to a decline in the stock
price."</TE>
<TE>   If the prosecutor's office finds evidence of fraud, Messier or
other former Vivendi officers could face criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   Reached while vacationing with his family in Orlando, Fla.,
Messier declined to comment. In an interview last month he denied
misleading investors about Vivendi's finances and suggested its woes
were largely caused by market rumors.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Messier's lawyer, Olivier Metzner, said that his
client had done nothing wrong. Vivendi Universal spokeswoman Anita
Larsen said the company was "cooperating fully with the inquiry."</TE>
<TE>   The current criminal investigation is similar to an inquiry
launched three months ago by France's stock market regulator,
Commission des Operations de Bourse. That probe, expected to be
complete by year's end, also focuses on Vivendi's financial reporting
in the last year, including how it communicated a complex stock deal
surrounding the sale of its shares in British Sky Broadcasting Group.</TE>
<TE>   A dozen shareholder lawsuits also have been filed in New York and
California, alleging Vivendi and Messier misled investors after
issuing a statement on June 26 emphatically denying that Vivendi
faced any liquidity problems. Messier -- who had taken Hollywood by
storm with his flamboyant style -- was ousted a week later. The new
CEO, Jean-Rene Fourtou, then declared that Vivendi was on the verge
of default after credit firms lowered the company's rating to junk
status.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi's stock has plummeted this year amid concerns over the
company's $19 billion in media debt and doubts about Messier's
growth-by-acquisition strategy to transform a 149-year-old water
utility into a global entertainment giant.</TE>
<TE>   The probe comes during a difficult time for Fourtou, who has been
working frantically to ease Vivendi's cash crunch through a series of
asset sales, and restore the company's credibility with U.S. and
French investors.</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou is close to reaching a deal to sell U.S. publisher
Houghton Mifflin for $1.7 billion to a consortium that includes the
private equity investment firm Blackstone Group, sources close to the
board say. He also is weighing whether to wage a bidding war with
British cell phone giant Vodafone for the French telecom operator
Cegetel. Vivendi's board this week rejected as inadequate a
$6.7-billion offer that Vodafone made for its 44% stake in Cegetel.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Vivendi's stock fell 95 cents to close at $12.04 on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>GE Reports $4.4 Billion in Exposure to US Airways and
United Airlines</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Electric Co. said Tuesday it set aside an unspecified amount
to cover $4.4 billion in loans and other obligations to struggling
airlines US Airways and UAL Corp.'s United Airlines.</LD>
<LD>   The company also may have to write off about $800 million in
investments held by its insurance businesses, it said in a filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   The amount of exposure to the two airlines was GE's first specific
disclosure in a quarterly SEC filing.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts and investors have been watching GE closely to see what
sort of losses might result from the turmoil that has rocked U.S.
airlines. GE is a big lender, in addition to being a major
manufacturing conglomerate.</TE>
<TE>   GE spokesman David Frail noted that the firm's commitments to the
two airlines are secured by individual aircraft or pools of aircraft
engines.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, GE also made specific disclosures about its
exposure to the telecommunications and cable industries in its
quarterly filing, Frail said.</TE>
<TE>   GE said its investments and commitments to customers in the
telecom and cable industries were about $12 billion at the end of
September, primarily in financing receivables and investment
securities. GE said it has made provisions for probable losses, but
didn't provide details.</TE>
<TE>   "Future losses will depend upon business and economic developments
as well as the success of risk-mitigation actions," GE said in the
filing.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, GE said about $800 million in securities, mostly
investment-grade debt held by GE Insurance units, are at risk of
turning into losses for the company. The securities are part of a
massive portfolio valued at about $115 billion at the end of
September.</TE>
<TE>   GE's losses on investment securities were $679 million through the
first nine months of 2002, the filing said. A little more than half
stemmed from the telecommunications and cable industries.</TE>
<TE>   GE shares closed down 40 cents to $25.85 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   CSFB Fires About 400</TE>
<TE>   Investment Bankers</TE>
<TE>   Brokerage Credit Suisse First Boston has fired about 400
investment bankers as the investment giant pares operations to deal
with depressed markets, according to people familiar with the
situation.</TE>
<TE>   Credit Suisse's cuts come after Chief Executive John Mack warned
earlier this month he would eliminate as many as 1,750 jobs, or 7% of
the firm's workforce of 25,000.</TE>
<TE>   The firings, three months before annual bonuses are to be paid,
are the latest wave of securities industry job cuts that have totaled
more than 54,000 since May 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Although Credit Suisse ranks second in providing merger advisory
services this year, the total value of merger transactions worldwide
is $144 billion, compared with $331 billion in the same period last
year.</TE>
<TE>   Credit Suisse's cuts total about 20% of its investment bankers.</TE>
<TE>   That department now numbers about 1,800. Many of the firings have
occurred at the firm's Palo Alto-based technology unit headed by
Frank Quattrone, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Credit Suisse last week fired about 100 people in its research
department, including chief market strategist Tom Galvin.</TE>

<HD>Consumer Confidence Tumbles</HD>
<DH>The surprisingly sharp decline pushes the index to a
nine-year low and raises the specter of weak holiday sales, which
might prompt the Fed to cut rates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter G. Gosselin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Consumer confidence plunged to a nine-year low this
month as job cuts, war worries and sniper scares shook up Americans,
threatening to damp holiday spending and damage an already feeble
economic recovery.</LD>
<LD>   The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence fell from 93.7
last month to 79.4, its fifth straight decline and the steepest
monthly drop since last year's terrorist attacks, the business
research group said Tuesday. The index is now at its lowest since
late 1993, when the country was struggling back from the early-1990s
recession.</LD>
<LD>   Although confidence is one of the most uncertain of measures,
analysts said the sheer size of the decline and the fact that it was
almost entirely unexpected suggest a marked souring in the public
mood that could have substantial political and economic
repercussions.</LD>
<TE>   Economically, the most immediate worry is the critical holiday
shopping season. "This could be the Grinch that stole Christmas,"
said Standard &amp; Poor's chief economist David A. Wyss.</TE>
<TE>   Wyss and others said the risk of weak holiday sales could prompt
the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates from their already
near-record lows when the central bank's policymaking body meets next
week.</TE>
<TE>   Coming only a week before Tuesday's congressional mid-term
elections, the numbers could also hint at political trouble for
Republicans. "They suggest there's more wind behind the economic
issue than there was, and that helps Democrats," said Karlyn K.
Bowman, a polling expert with the generally conservative American
Enterprise Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Separately Tuesday, a widely watched measure of chain-store sales
slumped 1.9% for the week ended Saturday. The decline in the Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi index brought the measure of U.S. retailers' sales
to its lowest level since the beginning of the year and was another
sign that consumers are pulling back after their most recent buying
binge this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Another weekly report, the Redbook survey, showed sales growing
1.4% during the first three weeks of October. But the report, a
sales-weighted average of year-on-year sales growth at discount,
department and chain stores open at least a year, said sales slowed
in the third week of the month.</TE>
<TE>   The latest reports, though perhaps driven in part by anxiety over
the sniper attacks in the Washington, D.C., area that have since come
to an end, appeared to discourage even the optimists at the Treasury
Department. A senior Treasury official acknowledged Tuesday to
members of an outside panel that the economy began slowing in
September and probably would grow more slowly during the final three
months of the year than previously predicted. The remarks by Deputy
Assistant Treasury Secretary Mark Warshawsky were in marked contrast
to the sunny accounts of the economy offered recently by Treasury
Secretary Paul O'Neill.</TE>
<TE>   The slide in both confidence and sales is unlikely to be the last
of the bad economic news for the week. Most analysts predict that the
October jobs report due out Friday will show a rise in the nation's
unemployment rate and either a decline or no growth in jobs. "We
expect a very weak report," said Peter Kretzmer, an economist with
Bank of America Securities in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the bad news, some analysts continue to see strength in
the economy. They cautioned that the confidence number in particular
can be misleading because consumers often have continued to make
purchases even as they report that they are pessimistic about their
prospects.</TE>
<TE>   "Watch what people do, not what they say," recommended UCLA
economist Edward A. Leamer. They kept buying houses and cars this
summer even as the confidence index was declining, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the latest signs of economic weakness could be
enough to convince the Fed's policymaking Open Market Committee to
cut its signal-sending federal funds rate from its four-decade low of
1.75% when the group meets next Wednesday. The committee warned at
its September meeting that the recovery could sputter out, and, in an
unusual move, two panel members dissented from the group's decision
to leave rates unchanged.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the Fed doesn't act immediately, analysts said, the new
confidence numbers make it more likely the central bank will cut
rates within a few months if only because there is so little else
helping the economy.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing sparkling about this economy. There is nothing
driving it forward," said Los Angeles economist Donald H. Straszheim.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks dropped sharply but then largely recovered, and the price
of U.S. Treasury securities rose in reaction to the new confidence
numbers. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index shed 8 points, or 0.8%, to
close at 882.15. The Nasdaq composite index fell 15 points, or 1.2%,
to 1,300.54.</TE>
<TE>   Economists have focused increasing attention on confidence and
retail sales as business investment has come to a standstill, and
consumers have become virtually the only actors on the nation's
economic stage. Consumption accounts for about two-thirds of the
country's economic activity.</TE>
<TE>   The new confidence numbers were particularly dispiriting because
they showed sharp declines both in consumers' view of their present
situations and in their expectations for the next six months. The
present-situation index fell 11 points to 77.5. The expectations
index fell an even steeper 16.5 points to 80.7. Economists had
predicted only a small decline in the two indexes.</TE>
<TE>   Fully 55.3% of those surveyed by the Conference Board described
the economy as poor or very poor, up from 51% and the highest level
since December 1993. Some 41% said the Democratic Party would do a
better job managing the economy, compared with 39% who said
Republicans would do better.</TE>
<TE>   Conference Board officials said that consumers' biggest worries
were jobs and incomes. The share of consumers who said that jobs are
hard to get rose to 27.3% in October, the highest level since late
1994. The fraction that said they expected their incomes to decline
in the coming months rose to 11.4%, the highest since late 1993.</TE>
<TE>   "The outlook for the holiday season is pretty bleak," said Lynn
Franco, the group's consumer research director. "Without the prospect
of a pickup in consumer spending, an already weak economic recovery
could weaken further," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The other major confidence survey, by the University of Michigan,
showed less dramatic declines in October but said that consumers
reported their finances as being in the worst condition in a decade.</TE>

<HD>EMI to Use Audible Magic to Track Web Piracy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Looking for more help battling Internet piracy, EMI Recorded Music
announced plans Tuesday to work with a Bay Area company that tracks
unauthorized copying of music online.</LD>
<LD>   The label, home to such artists as the Beatles, the Beach Boys and
Garth Brooks, expects to launch an anti-piracy project with Audible
Magic Corp. of Los Gatos this year, the companies announced.</LD>
<LD>   "We're going to use [the technology] to look at different ways of
keeping track of what's going on with our content, whether it's uses
that we've authorized or uses that are stealing from our artists,"
said Jay Samit, senior vice president of new media at EMI.</LD>
<TE>   Audible Magic identifies music files as they're passing through
the Internet, comparing a small sample of each file against the
company's database of audio "fingerprints," or unique sonic
characteristics. Chief Executive Vance Ikezoye said the Recording
Industry Assn. of America has been using his company's technology to
gather evidence of copyright infringement for its lawsuits against
online file-sharing networks.</TE>
<TE>   The technology can't stop people from making unauthorized copies
of music, Ikezoye said, but it could be an effective deterrent when
combined with some of the other anti-piracy tools the labels have
been exploring. "We can be used as a tool to understand both where
the opportunities to affect [piracy] are and maybe how effective
those techniques are," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The monitoring services also could help EMI give its artists a
clearer picture of what's happening to their music online. Several of
the company's biggest acts, including the Beatles, have refused to
make their music available through legitimate online music services
despite pressure from the label to support alternatives to the
unauthorized outlets.</TE>
<TE>   Audio fingerprinting technology also has been used to combat
piracy by CD-pressing firms. In the latest development, the RIAA
announced Tuesday that Cinram International Inc. of Toronto, a major
CD replicator, has agreed to pay $10 million to settle piracy claims.</TE>

<HD>Slipshod Business Ethics a Poor Example for Youth</HD>

<LD>If you think ethical standards of business management are low today,
just wait. The current crop of high school students admit to
cheating, lying and stealing on a scale unmatched over the last
decade.</LD>
<LD>   So says Michael Josephson, whose Marina del Rey-based Josephson
Institute of Ethics has just surveyed 12,000 youngsters on the
subject.</LD>
<LD>   In the latest survey -- the fifth the institute has conducted in
the last 10 years -- researchers found that 74% of the students said
they had cheated on an exam in the last year. That compares with 61%
who admitted to cheating on the 1992 survey and 71% on the 2000
survey.</LD>
<TE>   Totals for stealing from stores (38%) and lying to teachers and
parents (83% and 93%, respectively) also were up substantially over
the 10-year period.</TE>
<TE>   Most appallingly, many of the students weren't ashamed of such
conduct. Rather, they seemed downright proud of it, as 43% of the
respondents agreed with the statement "A person has to lie or cheat
sometimes in order to succeed."</TE>
<TE>   To Josephson, a lawyer and onetime teacher, the survey reflects a
general decline of ethics in America, as demonstrated most vividly by
the scandals rocking one corporate executive suite after another. And
it portends dark days ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "The implications for business are great," he says. "The
atmosphere of deception is destructive to the economy."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, ethics has become an industry in and of itself.
Attorney Charles Samel, a partner in the Washington law firm of
Howrey Simon Arnold &amp; White, notes that there now are some 800
members in the Ethics Officers Assn., which is made up of vice
presidents and corporate counsels of such firms as Raytheon Co.,
Caterpillar Inc. and New York Life Insurance Co.</TE>
<TE>   Josephson's institute has grown into a $4-million-a-year nonprofit
business with 40 employees. It holds ethics training programs for
major companies as well as the U.S. armed forces.</TE>
<TE>   Given that, it is in Josephson's interest to paint a dismal
picture of America's moral climate. Yet there is no hype here. The
self-proclaimed ethicist's assessment is, woefully, right on the
money.</TE>
<TE>   Investment pros certainly see it. Robert Arnott, chairman of First
Quadrant, a Pasadena fund-management firm, has calculated that
outright fraud and deceptive accounting falsely inflated earnings by
nearly 50% in recent years for the Standard &amp; Poor's list of 500 of
America's largest and best-known firms.</TE>
<TE>   That had consequences. The fact that the widely watched S&amp;P 500
index reported that its companies had aggregate earnings of $52 a
share instead of a more accurate figure of $35 a share drove the
whole stock market higher.</TE>
<TE>   But as scandals broke in 2001, investors turned a suspicious eye
on spurious accounting, and the great majority of stock prices have
been down sharply ever since.</TE>
<TE>   Investors now "require a credibility premium" when they buy
stocks, says Arnott, whose firm manages $28 billion in pension
assets. "That higher cost is exerting a drag on stock prices."</TE>
<TE>   Many people would say that we're on the road to reform now, with
the passage of new laws and regulations that govern corporate
management. The securities law sponsored by Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes
(D-Md.) and Rep. Michael G. Oxley (R-Ohio) requires chief executives
to certify the profits their companies are reporting under penalty of
fines -- or worse. And the law has created a board of oversight for
the accounting profession in an attempt to restore trust in corporate
numbers.</TE>
<TE>   New York Stock Exchange rules now require boards of directors to
assert more authority over company management while giving
shareholders a greater voice on policy.</TE>
<TE>   Josephson, however, believes that this is not nearly enough. He is
looking for a remedy that is far more fundamental. "Laws and coercive
regulations are all necessary," Josephson says, but without a basic
change in the culture, "laws only create new loopholes and ethics
become situational."</TE>
<TE>   Josephson cites the case of optical company Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc.,
which acknowledged recently that Chief Executive Ron Zarrella had
lied on his resume, claiming to have earned a master's degree in
business from New York University. It wasn't so much the offense that
bothered Josephson as it was the company's response.</TE>
<TE>   At first, the board of directors called the lie an "unfortunate
mistake" and declared its support for the CEO. Then on Tuesday, the
board said it would withhold Zarrella's $1.1-million bonus and called
his resume inflation "a serious matter." But at the same time, the
directors refused to accept Zarrella's resignation and reaffirmed
that he was "the right person to carry on the resurgence of the
company."</TE>
<TE>   Josephson was appalled. If someone in the mailroom had told such a
big lie, Josephson says, he or she surely would have been fired. "It
seems the higher you go in the company, the lower the moral
expectation," he says. "What kind of message does that send to the
company's employees and to future employees?"</TE>
<TE>   What's more, he asks, what message do episodes such as this send
to the young people he has been talking to of late?</TE>
<TE>   For all their cynicism in admitting transgression, Josephson
reports, the vast majority of students who responded to his survey
acknowledged that their parents wanted them to do the right thing.
They also said that their teachers consistently set a good ethical
standard.</TE>
<TE>   That means there is a glimmer of hope.</TE>
<TE>   But unless the corporate world begins to shape up and reward
integrity, the kids now coming up will continue to think that
cheating, lying and stealing are a formula for success.</TE>

<HD>Battle for Video Game Recognition</HD>
<DH>Publishers expect console software sales to jump 25% this
year, but a record number of competing titles may dilute profits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alex Pham</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ask Errol Dunningham what he wants for Christmas, and he'll tick off
the names of dozens of video games.</LD>
<LD>   "I can't afford all the games I want," said the 24-year-old West
Los Angeles airport security guard. "I'd say the list is longer than
ever."</LD>
<LD>   It sure is. For gamers such as Dunningham, this is a bumper crop
as publishers churn out a record number of titles -- more than 1,200
by year's end. For game makers, however, competition for attention
and retail shelf space represents one of the fiercest fights in the
industry's relatively brief history.</LD>
<TE>   Publishers are putting out an unprecedented number of console
games to cash in on the immense popularity of next-generation game
machines such as Sony Corp.'s PlayStation 2, Nintendo Co.'s GameCube
and Microsoft Corp.'s Xbox. By year's end, more than 700 console
games will have been released, up from 312 games in 1998, according
to International Development Group, a consulting firm in San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Throw in more than 500 new computer games, and shelves will be
bulging. Console software sales in North America are expected to grow
more than 25% this year to a record $5.8 billion, but each
publisher's piece of the pie may be thinner than ever because there
are so many games.</TE>
<TE>   "We're set to have a record number of console [titles] chasing
store shelves," said Simon Price, analyst at IDG. "Where are they all
going to fit into the store?"</TE>
<TE>   Target Corp. is stocking 40% more titles this year than last in
its 1,148 stores, said Douglas Kline, a spokesman for the
Minneapolis-based retailer. "We expect this to be one of the better
years for video game sales," Kline said. "That's why we're offering
more choices this year."</TE>
<TE>   But Target, like most retailers, must still pick and choose what
it stocks.</TE>
<TE>   "Competition for shelf space has intensified," said Edward
Williams, an analyst with Gerard Klauer Mattison, an investment firm
holding a game industry conference today in New York. "If you are a
secondary publisher, it's going to be difficult for you to gain
distribution for your products."</TE>
<TE>   Overall, games are a bright spot in an otherwise grim market for
consumer electronics. Sales of consoles continue to be brisk. About
15% of U.S. households are expected to have a current-generation game
console by year's end, according to publisher estimates. Sony is
expected to have sold 15.3 million PlayStation 2s, and Microsoft and
Nintendo are forecast to move about 4 million machines each in North
America.</TE>
<TE>   With so many households seeded with consoles, game publishers are
tripping over themselves to release games to play on them.</TE>
<TE>   The most anticipated title of all this holiday season is "Grand
Theft Auto: Vice City" for PS2. The game is expected to sell nearly
as well as its blockbuster predecessor, "Grand Theft Auto 3," which
sold 8 million copies worldwide since its debut last year.</TE>
<TE>   Initial shipments of "Vice City" will top 1 million copies,
Williams said. Many of those have already been snapped up. Stores
such as an Electronics Boutique in Santa Monica were sold out of the
game Tuesday, the day it hit store shelves.</TE>
<TE>   "You can combine the buzz for all the games on GameCube and Xbox,
and you wouldn't come up with the same level of buzz that 'Vice City'
is generating," said Dan Hsu, editor of Electronic Gaming Monthly in
San Francisco. "That game is just going to sell crazy numbers."</TE>
<TE>   Although there's ample shelf space for other titles that are
expected to be big sellers, such as "Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4" and
"WWE Smackdown! Shut Your Mouth," titles without big marketing
budgets or grass-roots fan buzz will have a tough time getting any
attention.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the hope among publishers is that they are sitting on a
sleeper hit that will catch everyone by surprise. Last year, that was
"Grand Theft Auto 3."</TE>
<TE>   "We're in a tough spot right now," said Brian Farrell, who has
been chief executive of Calabasas-based game developer THQ Inc. for
eight years. "It's two months before Christmas, and a lot can change
over the next eight weeks."</TE>

<HD>Central Valley Grape Growers Ask for Federal Aid Amid Glut</HD>
<DH>Proposals sent to USDA ask government to buy 20,000 tons
of raisins, pay producers to pull out vines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Melinda Fulmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Grape growers in the San Joaquin Valley, conceding they cannot help
themselves out from under a largely self-created glut, are asking the
federal government for financial help.</LD>
<LD>   The growers and local political leaders discussed possible
solutions at a one-day grape meeting in Fresno on Tuesday. Among them
was a set of proposals sent to the U.S. Department of Agriculture
that asks the government to buy 20,000 tons of raisins for federal
school lunch plans and international aid programs, to pay growers to
pull out their vines, and to hold raisins off the market for a
season.</LD>
<LD>   "Grape and raisin production is critical to the economic
well-being of the [Central] Valley," said Rep. George P. Radanovich
(R-Mariposa). "If the situation is not addressed, the economy of the
Valley and the state of California will suffer."</LD>
<TE>   The industry says it needs some sort of bailout, since cash
reserves of raisin cooperatives have been strained by growers'
inability to raise prices during the last two years and by payouts to
some farmers to help them switch to other crops.</TE>
<TE>   Wine grape growers contend they have been battered by
government-supported imports, which have depressed demand and forced
down prices for their grapes.</TE>
<TE>   Prices have fallen so low for San Joaquin Valley growers that
despite supplying more than half of the grapes crushed for wine in
California, producers get just 17% of all revenue. California grapes
are a $2.8-billion industry.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not asking for any price supports, but we need to get some
of these grapes pulled out so we can make more money," said Nat
DiBuduo of Allied Grape Growers, a marketing cooperative that
represents 500 growers.</TE>
<TE>   Not all in the industry agree that a government bailout is the
answer.</TE>
<TE>   "Not everyone's on board," said Madera raisin grower Dave Loquaci,
speaking by phone from the conference. "There's a lot of different
ideas out there of what we need to do to help ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Radanovich also has asked U.S. Agriculture Secretary Ann M.
Veneman to convene a special USDA panel to address the problems in
the state's grape and raisin industries. USDA officials said they
would review the proposals but would not comment further.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1993, more than 265,000 acres of wine and table grapes have
been planted throughout the state, doubling their production.</TE>
<TE>   Hardest hit are growers of Thompson seedless grapes, who lost a
lucrative secondary market for their grapes as wine grape acreage
surged. More grapes were pushed into raisin production, worsening the
glut, which has left last year's raisins piling up in warehouses
across the Central Valley.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Exec of Homestore Pleads Guilty</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former vice president at Homestore Inc., the online real estate
technology company, faces up to 10 years in prison after pleading
guilty to a federal insider trading charge.</LD>
<LD>   John Desimone entered the plea Monday and is expected to be
sentenced April 21 by U.S. District Judge Percy Anderson.</LD>
<LD>   Two other former Homestore executives pleaded guilty this month to
federal charges for their role in a scheme to inflate the company's
earnings.</LD>
<TE>   John Giesecke Jr., former chief operating officer, and Joseph J.
Shew, former chief financial officer, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to
commit securities fraud. Giesecke also pleaded guilty to wire fraud.</TE>
<TE>   The two were among seven executives who quit or were fired after
the plot came to light late last year.</TE>
<TE>   Giesecke faces up to 10 years in prison and Shew as much as five
years. Both are scheduled to be sentenced on the same date as
Desimone.</TE>
<TE>   All three are expected to pay restitution to the federal
government.</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors say that from March 2001 to December 2001, the
company moved some of its money out, parked it with co-conspirators,
then back in, booking the money as new revenue.</TE>
<TE>   That enabled the company to satisfy Wall Street that it was
robust, allowing the executives to exercise millions of dollars'
worth of stock options.</TE>
<TE>   Homestore, based in Westlake Village, reported this year that it
had overstated revenue in the first three quarters of 2001 by as much
as $95 million.</TE>

<HD>IHOP Quarterly Earnings Slip 11%</HD>
<DH>Slow franchise and same-store sales push down third-quarter
profit. Restaurant chain says fourth quarter won't meet forecasts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Karen Robinson-Jacobs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Less-than-expected franchising activity pushed third-quarter earnings
down 11% at IHOP Corp., the Glendale-based restaurant chain said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The company, which franchises International House of Pancakes
restaurants in the U.S. and Canada, reported net income of $9.8
million, or 46 cents a share.</LD>
<LD>   That compared with $11.1 million, or 53 cents, for the same period
a year ago. Revenue rose to $92.1 million, from $81.1 million.</LD>
<TE>   IHOP reported its earnings after the markets closed Tuesday. Its
shares rose 87 cents to $24.74 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Same-store sales dropped 1.2% for the quarter, compared with the
year-ago period. The company also was forced to operate seven stores
that it had difficulty franchising, said Julia A. Stewart, IHOP's
president and chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   About 94% of the 1,063 IHOP restaurants in the U.S. and Canada are
franchised, with each operator paying a $250,000-per-store franchise
fee and continuing royalties.</TE>
<TE>   The initial franchise fee is "a big revenue generator for them,"
said Michael D. Smith, a Kansas City-based analyst with Fahnestock &amp;
Co., which rates the company a "hold."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart said the company is on track to meet its previously
announced goal of opening as many as 90 restaurants this year. The
company has launched 53 so far this year.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it expects fourth-quarter earnings to be below
prior forecasts due to several factors, including slow sales of
franchises and continued weakness in same-store sales. .</TE>
<TE>   The company expects to report fiscal 2002 earnings of $1.85 to
$1.96 a share, down from prior expectations of $1.99 to $2.10 a
share.</TE>
<TE>   The company also announced completion of a $100-million private
debt placement to fund future capital expenses and general corporate
needs.</TE>

<HD>Ingram Micro's Loss Narrows on Cost Cuts</HD>
<DH>The distribution firm's chairman credits a nearly two-year
restructuring for better results. Revenue dips 3%.</DH>

<LD>Technology distribution giant Ingram Micro Inc. reported Tuesday that
it narrowed its fiscal third-quarter net loss to $8.3 million, or 6
cents a share, saying it is reaping benefits from a "profit
enhancement" program focused on cost cutting.</LD>
<LD>   The distributor of technology products lost $13.3 million, or 9
cents a share, a year earlier. Sales slipped 3% to $5.6 billion in
the quarter ended Sept. 28.</LD>
<LD>   Though the economic environment "continues to be challenging,"
said the Santa Ana firm's chairman, Kent B. Foster, a nearly two-year
restructuring effort is creating results.</LD>
<TE>   Sales have been rising quarter to quarter -- up 5% from the second
quarter -- "and that's a good, solid sign of stability in the
information technology industry," said Michael J. Grainger, Ingram's
president.</TE>
<TE>   Under its program, prompted by the long slowdown in consumer
spending, Ingram Micro has eliminated 3,000 jobs and closed
facilities worldwide in the last year. Nearly 700 employees, about
45% in North America, were fired, and the rest of the job loss came
from attrition. The program is expected to generate operating income
averaging $40 million a quarter in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The retuning, though, is costing the company $140 million, with
the biggest chunk charged against earnings in the last six months.</TE>
<TE>   The company said that $45.1 million of the cost was taken in the
third quarter and that a similar amount would be taken in the fourth
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Without that cost, other one-time charges, depreciation,
amortization and taxes, the firm would have earned $20.1 million, or
13 cents a share. That is on average 2 cents a share more than
analysts expected, according to Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   The results were released after the markets closed. Ingram shares
fell 59 cents to $13.36 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Vatican-HP Project Makes for a Holy Site</HD>
<DH>The Holy See and the tech firm place Bible texts and rare
works of art from the previously closed Apostolic Library on the
Internet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Colker</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co. has a divine new client. Considering the slowdown
in corporate spending, it's a blessing.</LD>
<LD>   The Palo Alto-based technology giant and the Holy See said Tuesday
that they had placed selected treasures from the Vatican's Apostolic
Library on the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   Scans of ancient Bible texts, rare works of art and handwritten
letters from the likes of Michelangelo and Martin Luther were chosen
by Vatican officials for the site debut. The collection previously
had been open only to scholars and church officials.</LD>
<TE>   Vatican officials selected items to place on the site from among
the library's vast collection of nearly 2 million printed volumes,
including 8,000 printed before 1500, 75,000 manuscripts and hundreds
of thousands of coins and medals. HP's contribution included
technical consulting along with donated computer servers, scanners
and other hardware items.</TE>
<TE>   Didier Philippe, HP's director of strategy and development in
Europe, said the motivation for the donation had more to do with
history and art than with business.</TE>
<TE>   But he recognized that the Catholic Church could be a huge buyer.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a very decentralized organization," Philippe said, speaking
from Geneva.</TE>
<TE>   "They have bishops all over the world making decisions about what
equipment they buy."</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the Vatican, which has been an HP customer for about
10 years, could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The association with the Vatican may not provide a big boost to
HP's sales. But the donation could help HP mend damage done to its
image last year during its contentious proxy fight to take over
Compaq Computer Corp., said Rob Enderle, technology analyst for the
research firm Giga Information Group.</TE>
<TE>   "They still have core value in the brand, but they want to be
trusted again, like the old HP," Enderle said. "This is the kind of
thing a company can use to recoup an image."</TE>
<TE>   HP shares fell 27 cents to $15 on Tuesday on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Biblical scholar Anthony Tambasco, a professor of theology at
Georgetown University in Washington, was eager to explore the site,
given that the church highly restricts access to the library, even
for scholars. His initial impression was that the site was difficult
to navigate and its offerings were frustratingly limited.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, only one page from the rare "B" version of the
"Codex Vaticanus" Bible is available online. And although much of the
site is in English and other languages, large portions of it --
including an enticing section called "Vatican Secret Archives" -- are
only in Italian.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not of much use to scholars," he said. "It's more like a
museum exhibit."</TE>
<TE>   HP spokeswoman Alison Connor said the site would become more
comprehensive. "This is just for the rollout," she said. "They are
just scratching the surface."</TE>
<TE>   The Vatican Library was founded in 1451 by Pope Nicholas V. It was
opened to researchers in 1883.</TE>
<TE>   To access the site in English, go to www.vatican.va/phome _en.htm
and click on "Vatican Library."</TE>

<HD>PacBell Gets Closer to Long-Distance</HD>
<DH>The phone company receives a Justice Department endorsement
to enter the state's market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Douglass</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a carefully worded endorsement, the Justice Department on Tuesday
said federal regulators should approve SBC Pacific Bell's
long-distance application, bringing California's largest local phone
company another step closer to joining in the state's $10-billion
market for long-distance service.</LD>
<LD>   In a nine-page evaluation, the antitrust division of the Justice
Department ruled that "available evidence suggests that generally,
SBC has succeeded in opening its local telecommunications markets in
California," and thus, the Federal Communications Commission should
approve the phone company's long-distance application.</LD>
<LD>   The decision leaves SBC PacBell with one, or possibly two, hurdles
to clear before it can begin selling long-distance service to its
nearly 10 million customers in California. The FCC already is
reviewing the company's application and has until Dec. 19 to approve
or reject it.</LD>
<TE>   "What we see here is a strong endorsement of our application,"
said George Thompson, a spokesman for SBC Communications Inc., the
phone company's parent.</TE>
<TE>   However, Justice Department officials urged the FCC "to review
carefully" a reassessment by California regulators, who will set SBC
PacBell's permanent wholesale rates. Those rates determine how much
rival companies have to pay SBC PacBell to use the lines and
equipment they need to sell local phone service in residential areas.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the phone company won tepid approval from the state's
Public Utilities Commission, which ruled that SBC PacBell passed the
relevant federal requirements but failed key state rules. If left
unresolved, the PUC's split decision could force a showdown between
federal and state regulators or spark legal action from SBC PacBell.</TE>

<HD>Delays at Ports Denied by Union</HD>
<DH>ILWU says it is not responsible for the slow pace in
eliminating the backlog of cargo aboard ships backed up at ports on
the West Coast.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Cleeland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a testy six-page response to allegations that it orchestrated
slowdowns at West Coast ports, the longshore union Tuesday repeatedly
accused the Justice Department of siding with the shipping industry
in a labor dispute that continues to stall cargo shipments.</LD>
<LD>   The International Longshore and Warehouse Union denied violating
the Oct. 8 federal injunction that reopened port terminals after a
10-day employer lockout. The injunction called on union members to
work at a "normal and reasonable speed."</LD>
<LD>   The Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents the shipping lines
and terminal operators, filed documents with the Justice Department
more than a week ago claiming the union defied the court order by
engaging in systematic slowdowns, causing productivity to drop by as
much as 37%.</LD>
<TE>   If federal attorneys deem the complaint valid and take the matter
back to court, the union could be held in contempt and fined. The
court also could hand down specific orders addressing industry
complaints, such as the allegation that key workers are arriving at
jobs 90 minutes late.</TE>
<TE>   In the letter, union attorney Richard Zuckerman said the
industry's claims of a slowdown were baseless. He said any declines
in productivity could be attributed to congestion on the docks,
shortages of equipment and labor, and mismanagement by terminal
operators.</TE>
<TE>   He also said union officials have tried to resolve logistics
problems by dealing directly with the PMA, but said they have been
rebuffed. "PMA has steadfastly refused to cooperate with these
initiatives, preferring to adopt a confrontational posture that
appears to be aimed only at framing the Union to take the blame for
the continuing effects of the lockout," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The letter was the union's second in a week to the department,
which asked it to respond to the PMA allegations of a slowdown.
Initially, the union complained that it never saw the allegations and
then contended that the matter should be handled through an internal
grievance process rather than the courts.</TE>
<TE>   Federal attorneys quickly rebuked the union, saying the court has
clear authority to consider work pace and demanding documentation
showing the union followed the injunction by noon Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We take seriously any allegations that those ports are not
operating at an appropriate level of productivity," wrote Deputy
Assistant Atty. Gen. Shannen W. Coffin. "The United States will not
tolerate interference with the court's injunction in this matter."</TE>
<TE>   Citing that letter, the union's response on Tuesday complained at
least four times of federal bias toward the shipping lines. "We must
object at the outset to the tone of your letter which in our view
demonstrates a lack of impartiality in this matter," Zuckerman wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the same letter, he chided federal attorneys for
demanding appropriate productivity: "We strenuously object that your
letter, by adopting much of PMA's own jargon, reveals a bias that has
no place in these or any other proceedings."</TE>
<TE>   Zuckerman dismissed most of the evidence cited by the shipping
group in claiming a slowdown and said some issues, such as tardiness,
have been the object of complaints for years and are "nothing new."
He also suggested the PMA itself violated the court order "through
its refusal to work with the Union to jointly address the tremendous
logistical problems caused by the lockout."</TE>
<TE>   PMA spokesman Steve Sugerman countered that the PMA has met with
local union steering committees and had "daily phone calls and
discussions" with union leaders to clear the backlog of containers
and vessels.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department spokesman Charles Miller said federal attorneys
are studying documents from the union and PMA to determine whether to
seek more specific orders or penalties from the court. "We will
review the materials provided by both sides in a fair and evenhanded
manner with the goal of ensuring compliance with the court's
injunction," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the backlog of ships at the port complex of Los
Angeles-Long Beach is slowly beginning to clear, according to Dick
McKenna of the Marine Exchange, which monitors ship movements in the
area. As of Tuesday afternoon, 93 vessels were waiting to unload
containers, down from a high of 120 during the lockout, McKenna said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that many shipping lines were diverting vessels to other,
less congested ports, such as Oakland, or were holding them at home
ports until the backlog cleared. A federal mediator continued to lead
negotiations between the union and shipping group at a San Francisco
hotel. The talks began in mid-May, but bogged down on the
introduction of labor-saving technology. The PMA ordered the lockout
of union workers last month in response to what it said were
orchestrated slowdowns by ILWU members.</TE>
<TE>   Union negotiators say they are willing to accept new technology,
such as scanners and remote cameras, that will eliminate hundreds of
clerical jobs. But in return they want to represent some workers,
including vessel planners, who are not now unionized. The employers
have balked at expanding the union's jurisdiction.</TE>
<TE>   In a sign of organized labor's interest in the high-stakes
negotiations, AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Richard Trumka began
sitting in on the talks late last week. Spokeswoman Denise Mitchell
said his presence was meant to "add accountability to the process."</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Post Eyes Other Coast</HD>
<DH>By offering same-day copies in Los Angeles, the tabloid
hopes to feed an appetite for its brash style of journalism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Hirsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>N.Y. to L.A.: Buy This.</LD>
<LD>   That's the message the New York Post plans to pitch to Angelenos
if it follows through on initial plans to start circulating the
colorful tabloid controlled by Aussie media czar Rupert Murdoch.</LD>
<LD>   The Post already sells a small number of papers in Los Angeles,
but they arrive here a day late. "We are getting the sense there is
some demand from people who want it the same day, and we want to see
if we can satisfy that," said Col Allan, the paper's editor. He said
he didn't know precisely how many papers are sold in Southern
California.</LD>
<TE>   The Post, a favorite of New York subway riders, is noted for its
brash style, celebrity gossip page, conservative editorials and
clever headlines such as "Sex &amp; the Kiddie," which topped a
three-byline article in Tuesday's edition about TV's "Sex and the
City" star Sarah Jessica Parker giving birth to her first child.</TE>
<TE>   "This would be a very low-level foray into the market. People
would get what we sell in New York. We would not change the content,"
Allan said.</TE>
<TE>   The Post, which has an average daily circulation of 588,000,
already has a similar deal in Florida, where it sells about 10,000
same-day copies to vacationing New Yorkers and Big Apple transplants,
Allan said.</TE>
<TE>   "I was looking for a copy of the New York Times in Miami recently,
and all I could find was the Post," said Loren Ghiglione, dean of the
Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University.</TE>
<TE>   But it's unclear if there are enough passionate expatriates in
Southern California to get that type of presence in sprawling Los
Angeles, Ghiglione said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see where the money will come from," he said. "It won't
be from advertising and it won't be from circulation."</TE>
<TE>   Before the Post can begin same-day sales in Southern California,
it must contract with a local printing plant and set up distribution.</TE>
<TE>   "This might be part of a Rupert Murdoch ego trip to get his
editorial voice to the West Coast," Ghiglione said.</TE>

<HD>Zenith Unit Betting on Wynn Resorts</HD>
<DH>The Woodland Hills insurer buys 1 million shares in the
company, which is planning a $2.4-billion hotel- casino in Las Vegas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. Scott Reckard</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Zenith National Insurance Corp. Chairman Stanley Zax, who helped run
the Las Vegas Hilton more than three decades ago, offers this advice
on placing a bet: Back a proven winner, especially when the odds
improve.</LD>
<LD>   Zax said Tuesday that Zenith's operating subsidiary spent $13
million to buy 1 million shares of Wynn Resorts Ltd., which will
build Le Reve, a $2.4-billion hotel-casino that is the latest venture
of Las Vegas veteran and longtime Zax pal Steve Wynn.</LD>
<LD>   It's a significant addition to Woodland Hills-based Zenith's
common-stock holdings, which totaled $32 million as of June 30,
though the investment is dwarfed by the firm's $900 million in bond
holdings.</LD>
<TE>   Wynn's latest resort, on the Las Vegas Strip site of the old
Desert Inn, will include an eight-story "mountain," a Ferrari and
Maserati dealership, a gallery to display Wynn's art collection and
an 18-hole golf course.</TE>
<TE>   Wynn, who developed the Mirage, Bellagio and Treasure Island
properties, had to trim Wynn Resorts' initial public offering price
more than 40% last week after skittish investors balked at Le Reve's
three-year construction schedule and over-the-top features.</TE>
<TE>   But Zax, in an interview, said he's convinced that, at $13 a
share, "the price was attractive for a long-term investment in Las
Vegas with a compelling tale." Zenith's purchase was nearly 2.9% of
the total 34.6 million shares Wynn sold.</TE>
<TE>   Zax said 35 years of studying the desert boom town has taught him
some important lessons: "One, Steve Wynn proved he can make money
there. And second, major new hotels have always done well there, as
first proved by Kirk Kerkorian," the wheeler-dealer who sold Hilton
its first Las Vegas hotels in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   In a deal in which Zax served as Wynn's consultant, Kerkorian's
MGM Grand Inc. bought Wynn's Mirage Resorts Inc. for $6.4 billion in

<TE>   "Kirk is the only other guy like Steve," Zax said.</TE>
<TE>   Wynn was a wine distributor in Las Vegas in the 1960s when his
path first crossed that of Zax, who at the time was general counsel
of Hilton Hotels Corp. While Wynn pushed beverages, Zax helped Hilton
digest its purchase of the former Flamingo hotel-casino from
Kerkorian.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, Wynn, then chairman of Golden Nugget Inc., needed
$100 million to build a hotel-casino in Atlantic City, N.J. It was
Zax who helped him out by introducing Wynn to "junk" bond financier
Michael Milken, a second cousin to Zax.</TE>
<TE>   Zenith this month completed the sale of its 9-year-old real estate
company in Las Vegas for $65 million. Zax described that deal as
freeing up funds to support growth of Zenith, a workers' compensation
insurance specialist, and to make another equity bet in Las Vegas on
his old friend Wynn. Zax serves on Wynn Resorts' board.</TE>
<TE>   The performance of Zenith's investment portfolio is important
because it backs up the company's ability to pay claims. Zenith has
been profitable this year after recording losses in much of the last
three years. Rising premiums have helped boost profits across the
insurance industry since last year's terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Zax is hopeful he'll come up a big winner in Wynn's company, but
with Le Reve not scheduled to open until 2005, he acknowledges it's
no sure thing.</TE>
<TE>   Wynn shares fell 37 cents to $12.64 on Nasdaq on Tuesday. Zenith
shares rose 5 cents to $28.65 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>A Disconnect With Democracy</HD>
<DH>Vitally important issues confront voters. So who cares?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Er, how should we put it just days before the midterm elections?
Maybe this way: With war on the horizon, the economy sputtering,
homeland security in doubt, with scandal tearing at our important
institutions, health care slipping out of the reach of millions, the
fate of vast swaths of public lands up for grabs, with the middle
class besieged and the future of Social Security at stake, with all
that, a nation polarized across an important ideological gap prepares
for a watershed vote that will determine the course of events for the
coming two years and possibly beyond.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, we can also say, yawn. Ho hum.</LD>
<LD>   According to Tuesday's weather and how it plays tricks on turnout
here and there across the country, and depending on the last-minute
impulses of a handful of flighty swing voters who will pick the
lesser of evils as depicted on TV commercials, we'll live with it.</LD>
<TE>   "Disconnect" is one of those dreary words that's come into popular
overuse. But what else can you say about the 2002 midterm elections?
Stakes are high, interest low; the choices narrow, the outcome
potentially ground-moving -- democracy's disconnect.</TE>
<TE>   Americans get the government they deserve, as the saying goes.
"Democracy gives every man the right to be his own oppressor," wrote
poet James Russell Lowell.</TE>
<TE>   Seldom, though, do we feel so aimless at it. Another desultory and
expensive round of campaigning now sputters to an end on a note of
expedient caution. The death of one Democratic U.S. senator and the
scandal of another has given the nation pause and reason to reflect
-- but not anything fast to grasp on to.</TE>
<TE>   All politics are local? Not in their consequence.</TE>
<TE>   In South Dakota's Senate race, the two candidates eagerly argue
about what they agree on: "South Dakota values" and drought relief
for local agriculture. The outcome of their neck-and-neck race,
though, may determine the question of oil drilling in Alaska's Arctic
wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll come out of the gates next year fast," Senate Republican
leader Trent Lott of Mississippi was recently quoted as saying. He
was talking about the possibility of the GOP retaking the U.S. Senate
and holding on to the House of Representatives, providing George W.
Bush with the muscle, if not yet the mandate, to back up his
ambitious conservative agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, that kind of campaign bluster is the exception this
year. More typical might be Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state,
who cautiously leads the Democrats' Senatorial Campaign Committee in
defending the politics of stalemate.</TE>
<TE>   "When I travel around the country," she said, "people ... feel
strongly that the Democratic Senate is the only check on the
Republican agenda. They are grateful that we stand as a roadblock."</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to predictions, the terrorist attacks of autumn 2001 have
not reawakened an appreciation for government, at least not so that
you can tell in campaign 2002. Rather, candidates remain chiefly
obsessed with winning tiny, or sometimes not so tiny, groups of
chronically undecided voters whose brief attention spans and
superficial engagement define what passes for the vital center of
politics.</TE>
<TE>   A few years back, Bill Clinton demonstrated how this could be
turned to advantage by moving the Democratic Party several degrees to
the right, co-opting such conservative ideas as welfare reform. Out
to do him better, Republicans now shift their campaign themes
centerward without bothering to alter their policy aims
correspondingly. For example, GOP candidates have suddenly disavowed
the idea of "privatizing" Social Security, while many still support
the president's proposal to allow Social Security funds into private
investment accounts. The result of these tactical politics is voter
cynicism and disconnect. In the last off-year election, 63% of
citizens chose not to vote.</TE>
<TE>   The good news about Tuesday is that midterm elections are famous
for turning conventional wisdom on its ear. At the national level,
campaign 2002 is most commonly described by what it's not: It's not a
genuine argument over the country's direction, not an inspirational
appeal to the citizenship, not a coherent inventory of our best
political ideas, not a reach for the future.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves even the most committed and eager voters without much
to work with.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, though, they will be wiser and more incisive than the
campaigns they've had to endure. We can hope. Either that or we can
wish for some luck with the weather.</TE>

<HD>Scheming to Terrorize Terrorists</HD>
<DH>Russia's decision to use gas in theater may be a message in
itself.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Avigdor Haselkorn</AU>
<BD>Avigdor Haselkorn is the author of "The Continuing
Storm: Iraq, Poisonous Weapons and Deterrence" (Yale University
Press, 1999).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Russian President Vladimir V. Putin was in a tough situation. Chechen
terrorists held more than 750 hostages in a theater in Moscow. The
terrorists and their target were heavily rigged with explosives. The
specter of carnage because of a customary military rescue operation
was very much on the agenda. And time was running out as the
terrorists had started to kill hostages.</LD>
<LD>   The Russians decided to use a novel incapacitating agent as the
best means to save the hostages at minimum cost. Although this goal
was essentially achieved, Russian authorities miscalculated the
dosage of the gas, which killed all but two of the more than 115
hostages who died.</LD>
<LD>   But there is another possibility: The Russian medium was the
message. The rescue operation could be viewed as the first shot in a
risky new strategy to deter suicide terrorism. There are several
reasons for viewing the Russian response as strategically
significant:</LD>
<TE>   * The use of an incapacitating gas in a hostage rescue operation
is without precedent.</TE>
<TE>   * Despite the outcry in Russia and the demands of foreign
governments, authorities have not told doctors treating the freed
hostages what substance was used or the dose. The reason for not
telling could be Russia's obsession with secrecy. Or the Russians
could be concerned that next time, terrorists could acquire the gas
or self-administer antidotes before they attack. Whatever the case,
U.S. Ambassador Alexander Vershbow has said that Russia's failure to
disclose information on the gas may have cost lives.</TE>
<TE>   If true, the Russians view the preservation of their new deterrent
as more important than the lives of their own people. The operation
accorded the new Russian weapon publicity and ambiguity at the same
time, which could enhance its deterrence value.</TE>
<TE>   * In the wake of the operation, the Interfax news agency on Monday
quoted Putin as saying that if terrorists "tried to use [weapons of
mass destruction] in relation to our country, Russia will answer with
measures adequate to the threats." He seems to be saying: I resorted
to gas even against a conventional threat. Do not question my
credibility.</TE>
<TE>   The Russian rescue operation sends the message that Russia is
ready to sacrifice its own citizens in the struggle against suicide
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, officials were quoted as saying that victims' families
would receive financial compensation: 100,000 rubles (about $3,200)
for each dead hostage and half that for those who survived.</TE>
<TE>   This could be viewed as an answer to the stipend that Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein is paying to families of Palestinian suicide bombers
who attack Israel. Moreover, the Russians have used the Moscow
episode to issue an unmistakable threat to annihilate any terrorist
enemy who would resort to weapons of mass destruction against them.</TE>
<TE>   The view that the Russian operation was solely aimed at ending the
siege is incomplete. True, Putin faced a difficult challenge and was
looking for the best way to resolve it without giving in. But he and
his commanders must have known what the consequences could be. They
embraced these potential human costs to deter suicide terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Will the new doctrine be effective? An incident like this may
never happen in the same way again, if only because future
hostage-takers will protect themselves. Putin's brutal response may
mean that future outrages would be of the cataclysmic kind that
happened in Bali recently or on Sept. 11, 2001, when the goal was
mass murder, not negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it is also possible that the new approach will dissuade
terrorists from attempting mega-attacks. Whatever the outcome, we are
on a new page in strategic deterrence.</TE>

<HD>Mr. Bush and Herr Schroeder, Tear Down This Wall</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>F. Stephen Larrabee</AU>
<BD>F. Stephen Larrabee, who was on the National Security
Council staff in the Carter administration, is a European security
specialist at Rand.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the last 40 years, U.S.-German relations have been one of the
cornerstones of Western security. Today, however, these relations are
at their lowest point in decades.</LD>
<LD>   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's categorical refusal during the
recent German electoral campaign to participate in any military
action against Iraq, even under a U.N. mandate, and remarks by his
justice minister comparing President Bush's tactics to those of
Hitler have infuriated the Bush administration and led to a virtual
cold war between Washington and Berlin.</LD>
<LD>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld refused to meet with his
German counterpart, Peter Struck, at a meeting of allied defense
ministers in Warsaw in September.</LD>
<TE>   Such snubs are usually reserved for adversaries, not close allies.</TE>
<TE>   Unless leaders on both sides take steps to repair the damage,
relations could seriously atrophy. Neither Germany nor the U.S. can
afford to let this happen.</TE>
<TE>   Germany is the most important economic and political actor in
Europe. Its support is critical to achieving many of Washington's
policy goals. And while Germany is unlikely to participate in a
U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, use of U.S. bases in Germany and German
airspace would be critical.</TE>
<TE>   The visit today to Washington by German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer provides a useful opportunity to begin rebuilding this
important relationship. Managing the delicate political issues raised
by the Iraq situation will be far easier if German and U.S.
politicians are not sulking or slinging mud at each other.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, there are signs that Germany is ready to make up. German
officials recently indicated that Germany might be willing to take
over the leadership of the international peacekeeping force in
Afghanistan when the Turkish mandate is completed at the end of the
year. This can be viewed as an olive branch to the Bush
administration, which should use it to begin rebuilding relations.</TE>
<TE>   There are several ways to do this:</TE>
<TE>   * Improve consultations. Schroeder's disenchantment with
Washington has in part been driven by his feeling that he was not
adequately consulted on many issues that affected Germany's security.
While consultations are not a panacea for resolving deep-seated
policy differences, they could help diminish their political effect.</TE>
<TE>   * Find new ways to deepen defense cooperation. The U.S. should
encourage Germany to play an active role in the new NATO response
force proposed by Rumsfeld in Warsaw. This would be a concrete
demonstration of Berlin's readiness to address the new threats facing
the alliance.</TE>
<TE>   * Liberalize export controls and open U.S. defense markets to
German and other European firms. While the U.S. must protect
sensitive technology, current procedures -- with licenses needlessly
delayed or mired in bureaucracy -- make it difficult to do business.</TE>
<TE>   Germany also needs to do its part. In particular, it should
accelerate the transformation of its military forces to be able to
better contribute to alliance security.</TE>
<TE>   While Berlin has taken important steps in this direction in the
last several years, it still has too many forces devoted to Cold War
missions.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Germany, which now has one of the lowest levels of defense
spending as a percentage of gross domestic product among the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization members -- just above that of Luxembourg
-- needs to increase its defense budget, not cut it further, if it
wants to be regarded in Washington as a serious defense partner.</TE>
<TE>   These measures would not remove all the problems in U.S.-German
relations. But they would help rebuild a relationship that has become
badly frayed.</TE>

<HD>In Policing, Small Crime Is a Big Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles A. Sale</AU>
<BD>Charles A. Sale retired in 1993 after 30 years in the
LAPD. He lives in Colorado Springs, Colo.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Police in general consider themselves members of the warrior class.
For the most part, they detest enforcing "petty" statutes. Such
enforcement is considered beneath a warrior's dignity.</LD>
<LD>   Contributing to this is the strange symbiosis between criminals
and police. They are like tooth decay and dentists: Each defines the
other. Hardened criminals often have a grudging respect, even a
twisted affection, for law enforcement "gunfighters." Police and
criminals form a partnership, which preserves the "dignity" of
violent confrontation and the military virtues such confrontation
requires.</LD>
<LD>   This is the first problem that Los Angeles Police Chief William J.
Bratton will face in applying the "broken windows" principle of
policing, which holds that enforcing so-called quality-of-life crimes
such as graffiti removes the stage for larger crimes and, in the
process, makes cities more pleasant for law-abiding residents.</LD>
<TE>   The second problem is public resistance. The "don't you have
something better to do" mentality is a serious hindrance, as is the
perception (and sometimes the reality) of police oppression.</TE>
<TE>   History and police anecdotes often do not coincide. For example,
while courage and daring were indeed essential to driving organized
crime from Los Angeles in the 1940s and 1950s, selective traffic
enforcement around establishments owned or frequented by organized
crime figures was an arguably more powerful tool. Our intelligence
people identified the bad guys; then our traffic enforcement people
drove them out -- literally -- with vigorous and sometimes "creative"
use of the vehicle code.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise in the case of motorcycle gangs: Police gunfighters are
almost useless against them. But a cop with a pleasant though
persistent disposition and knowledge of every nuance of the vehicle
code will send motorcycle ruffians packing.</TE>
<TE>   These boring truths about effective law enforcement tend to be
obscured in the screenplays and news extravaganzas about spectacular
law enforcement events -- some real, most imagined -- that form the
"police story" of a great city.</TE>
<TE>   These truths are also distorted -- usually through minimization --
in the mythology of street cops. And they are distorted -- usually
through embellishment -- at conventions of senior police executives
who pontificate on community policing and other innovations but who
mostly consider simply how to survive in the toughest executive role
in government.</TE>
<TE>   The history of crime and police is, for the most part, a history
of minutiae. From embellishments of these minutiae flow an
overwhelming volume of police drama -- most of it for entertainment,
much of it for news and politics, some of it for sustaining the
ideals of the police service.</TE>
<TE>   In this embellishment, the medium, particularly television, has
overwhelmed the message. The effect has been to cause us to believe
that what we see in film and on television is real. It is not. Not
even cop "reality" shows or up-to-the-minute television journalism is
real, because the camera, the medium, overwhelms all that it seeks to
record. The facts are smaller, more numerous. The truth is in the
minutiae, and few have the patience necessary to comprehend it.</TE>
<TE>   The law enforcement equivalent of water torture -- persistent
attention to detail -- delivers better results than isolated blazes
of gunfire.</TE>
<TE>   In the race of the tortoise and the hare, the tortoise may not be
exciting to watch, but he always wins. Fleas spread great plagues.
Attacking criminal fleas with law enforcement ice picks is slow work.
Other methods are required.</TE>
<TE>   Community policing, the current favorite trend, must be grounded
in vigorous quality-of-life enforcement to be effective. Without such
enforcement, community policing is just a politically correct
reference to whatever the police happen to be doing at the time. As
now practiced in most jurisdictions throughout the United States, it
is just a well-loved emperor who wears absolutely no clothes.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, no law enforcement program, however subtle or
intelligent, can succeed without courageous and daring police
officers--people trained, practiced, equipped and willing to use
deadly force. Courage and daring matter. Gunfighters are essential.
They are the "big stick" that must be used unflinchingly when
speaking softly fails.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, they are what make speaking softly work.</TE>

unlimited money and time to think of all sorts of silly things to do
with it. So the king over there, Hamed ibn Isa Khalifa, put up a
million dollars to challenge a computer and a human to play chess.
The winner got $800,000 unless it was a machine. It's good to be
human.</LD>
<LD>   Challenging a wily computer is something many humans feel they do
daily at work for somewhat less money. It's a typical master-servant
relationship: The human being, being human, never makes a mistake,
and the machine, not being human and not having an effective
spokesman, is blamed for all mistakes including spiling errers.</LD>
<TE>   Chess is a fascinating game and has its sincerely devoted fans.
Let's just say, however, that not many are moved to pound thunder
sticks during the matches.</TE>
<TE>   So the long-running human-versus-technology competition in Bahrain
sneaked up on an inattentive world distracted by human-versus-human
baseball and soccer playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The chess combatants were Vladimir Kramnik, reigning world
champion, and Deep Fritz, a German computer program. The 27-year-old
Kramnik made some beautiful moves. Fritz, capable of instantly
contemplating millions of possible moves and potential consequences
out a dozen or so more turns, countered quickly and deftly.</TE>
<TE>   Kramnik won two games. Fritz won two games. Nail-biting time.</TE>
<TE>   The competitors tied three times. Then, the whole thing was
pronounced a draw with criticism focusing on Kramnik's mistakes,
including a brilliant knight sacrifice that didn't fool Fritz.</TE>
<TE>   Ah, but here's the rest of the story (written on a computer by a
human): In 1997, another computer shockingly defeated world
grandmaster Gary Kasparov, resulting in Kasparov's first-ever loss
and a machine's first-ever victory. So, actually, humans could
interpret one of their own tying a computer five years after losing
to one as definite progress. And anyway, what could a computer do to
get even, garlbe osme wrsd nad cut off this editorial before the....</TE>

<LD>Jordanian officials rounded up dozens of people Tuesday, searching
for the killer of Laurence Foley, a top official of the U.S. Agency
for International Development. If extremists are found responsible
for the shooting of Foley outside his home in Amman, the capital, it
will be the latest example of the danger of representing this country
abroad at a time of increasing disappointment with and even hatred of
the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Jordanian Information Minister Mohammed Adwan said politics rather
than robbery probably motivated the killer. Although Jordan generally
has been considered a safe posting for diplomats, several Islamic
militant groups are entrenched, and anger at America for its strong
backing of Israel next door is widespread. More than half of Jordan's
population is Palestinian, and officials have tried to keep militants
from using the country as a staging area for attacks in the
Palestinian territories occupied by Israel.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. embassies and diplomats have been periodic targets of
extremists for many years. A group in Greece that opposed a 1970s
military coup killed several American diplomats before being broken
up this year. Al Qaeda bombed U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in
1998, killing hundreds of people, several of them diplomats.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. ambassador to Kenya, Prudence Bushnell, repeatedly sought
a new embassy in Nairobi before the attack, complaining that the
existing structure was vulnerable to car bombs. Since those bombings,
the State Department has improved security at many embassies and
residences of diplomats. After the Sept. 11 attacks, security
officials in Southeast Asia learned of plans to attack embassies and
personnel there, causing embassies to be closed periodically.</TE>
<TE>   One hundred percent security is not possible, and diplomats are
told to be alert to threats and to vary their work habits and driving
routes. America cannot develop its policies based on whether they
please others, but it does need to recognize the threat from
terrorists and do as much as possible to protect the men and women
who execute those policies.</TE>

<HD>Safety for Research Subjects</HD>
<DH>The government must ensure better protection of human
guinea pigs used in the development of drugs that defend against
biological and chemical weapons.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since 9/11, Congress has poured hundreds of millions of taxpayer
dollars into developing drugs to defend against biological and
chemical weapons. Given that such research is subject to only a
veneer of regulation and oversight, the government should be equally
eager to ensure that people are not hurt in the rush to protect the
public. Instead, the Bush administration and Congress have been
making moves that could weaken the protections of individuals who
subject themselves to experimentation.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, for example, the administration abruptly disbanded the
National Human Research Protections Advisory Committee, the key board
created to address what a 1995 federal report called "serious
deficiencies" in the system for protecting human research subjects.</LD>
<LD>   The administration says it plans to reconstitute the committee in
the future, perhaps with a broader mission. But the committee's
chairwoman, University of Kansas bioethics professor Mary Faith
Marshall, says the administration's call to scrap her panel "came out
of the blue.''</LD>
<TE>   It's unfair to blame the threat to human research subjects solely
on the Bush administration. In an attempt to encourage more private
investment in drugs aimed at countering bioterrorist threats, a top
Democrat, Connecticut Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, has introduced a bill
that would reduce companies' exposure to liability if patients were
harmed by a drug intended to help them recover from a bioweapons
attack.</TE>
<TE>   George Painter is the president of a San Diego-based biotech
start-up called Chimerix that hopes to develop a pill to combat
smallpox. Capitalists, he notes, often fail to invest in companies
tackling such important goals because they fear prohibitively
expensive pain-and-suffering lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   The government needs to confront that obstacle. But first Congress
and the Bush administration must fix obvious flaws in the Common
Rule. That 1991 law lays out guidelines for research on human
subjects, but only for publicly funded research conducted by 17
federal agencies. Inexcusably, institutions not receiving federal
funds need not comply with any of the safeguards in the rule.</TE>
<TE>   Legislators can find at least two sensible blueprints for reform.
One is a 1995 report by a federal task force that suggested expanding
protections to even classified research, "requiring the informed
consent of all human subjects." Another is a 2001 report from the
National Bioethics Advisory Commission recommending that the Common
Rule be applied without exception to "all government agencies,
academe and the private sector."</TE>
<TE>   There is no reason why Washington can't encourage more private
investment in anti-terrorism research while demanding that scientists
fully inform and offer strong protections to every human guinea pig
who heroically volunteers to test lifesaving chemical and
bioterrorism antidotes.</TE>

<HD>Arafat Announces a New Cabinet Barely Different From
Predecessor</HD>
<DH>Critics say Palestinian leader's lineup of ministers shows
he's not committed to reform. Meanwhile, Israel's coalition teeters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Turning aside calls for a shakeup of his government, Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat named a new Cabinet on Tuesday that
closely resembles his old one.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was
embroiled in a political battle within his ruling coalition that
could lead to its dissolution and bring about early elections. But
intense maneuvering was taking place in advance of a showdown vote
scheduled for today on the national budget, and in Israel's fractious
political system, such crises often end with a last-minute
resolution.</LD>
<LD>   Palestinian lawmakers, meeting in the West Bank city of Ramallah,
approved the new Cabinet lineup 56 to 18. Dissenters complained that
by retaining several ministers who have been accused of corruption,
Arafat showed he was not serious about carrying out reforms or
agreeing to curbs on his own powers.</LD>
<TE>   Last month, lawmakers forced Arafat's former Cabinet to resign
over allegations of corruption and mismanagement. The United States
joined reformers within the Palestinian ranks -- who normally refrain
from any serious challenge to Arafat's powers -- in calling for a
Cabinet shakeup.</TE>
<TE>   But as he faced some of the most intense political pressure in
years from within and outside the Palestinian ranks, Arafat's popular
standing was shored up by an unwitting ally: Israel. Last month,
Israeli troops besieged his Ramallah headquarters for 10 days,
destroying most of the buildings left standing in the compound.</TE>
<TE>   As has happened in the past, the Palestinian leader's support
among his people rebounded during the siege, and on its heels he
offered up a new, 19-member Cabinet with only five new faces. Arafat
told dissident lawmakers that any challenge to him now would amount
to support for the Israeli and U.S. view that he be sidelined.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Israel nor the Bush administration has any dealings with
Arafat, whom they accuse of condoning or actively supporting terror
attacks against Israel. A U.S. envoy who visited the region last
week, Assistant Secretary of State William Burns, pointedly refrained
from any talks with the Palestinian leader, although he traveled to
Ramallah for talks with other Palestinian political figures.</TE>
<TE>   During the lengthy parliamentary session Tuesday, Arafat sharply
rebuked lawmakers who criticized him. When independent lawmaker Abdel
Jawad Saleh complained about corruption, the Palestinian leader
retorted, "I will not allow you to humiliate us," the Reuters news
agency reported.</TE>
<TE>   Underscoring Arafat's appeal for unity in the face of external
pressure, the meeting of the Palestinian Legislative Council was held
in a building in his compound that was hastily refurbished after
being badly damaged during last month's standoff with Israeli troops.
Lawmakers and foreign diplomats who came to observe the session
picked their way past sandbag emplacements, concrete barriers and
piles of rubble.</TE>
<TE>   Thirteen lawmakers who said they were unable to attend because
they couldn't secure travel permits from Israel participated in the
proceedings by video.</TE>
<TE>   Before unveiling the new Cabinet, Arafat delivered an hourlong
speech in which he sounded themes of both reconciliation and
defiance. He said at one point that he wanted to hold out an "olive
branch" to Israel, but he denounced the Sharon government's military
hold on much of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   In the new Cabinet, four ministries changed hands, those of
interior, justice, health and prisoner affairs. Arafat also created
one new post dealing with Jerusalem affairs.</TE>
<TE>   In a move interpreted as pressure on dissident lawmakers, Arafat
broke with his normal practice of leaving after delivering his speech
and stayed to watch the vote by show of hands.</TE>
<TE>   "We are proud of these results," he said afterward.</TE>
<TE>   In Sharon's government, the struggle has been simmering since last
week, when the center-left Labor Party, his main coalition partner,
demanded that some of the funds earmarked for Jewish settlements in
the West Bank and Gaza be diverted to social spending.</TE>
<TE>   The conservative Sharon has said he will dismiss any Labor
ministers who defy him in today's planned vote on next year's
national budget.</TE>
<TE>   If the coalition unravels, Sharon could call elections in January,
but some Israeli commentators have suggested that he might be
deterred by the prospect of a challenge from former Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, a fellow member of the Likud Party who retains
considerable popularity among conservative voters.</TE>

<HD>To Some, Real Threat Is U.S.</HD>
<DH>Many members of the U.N. Security Council see American
bullying, not Iraqi defiance, as the greater risk to geopolitical
stability.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maggie Farley and Doyle McManus</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>For President Bush, this month's debate in the U.N. Security Council
is all about Iraq and its alleged weapons of mass destruction. But
for France, Russia and other countries, the issue isn't just the
Iraqi threat -- it's the U.S. threat, too.</LD>
<LD>   The United States says it is providing leadership, lighting a fire
under a Security Council that has failed for years to enforce its own
mandates on Iraq. President Saddam Hussein's flagrant defiance has
made the world body look "foolish," Bush said Monday during a
campaign stop in Denver. "Our message from America is this: If the
United Nations does not have the will or the courage to disarm Saddam
Hussein ... the United States will lead a coalition and disarm Saddam
Hussein."</LD>
<LD>   But to many members of the Security Council, it appears as if the
United States is using its strength not to lead, but to bully. These
ambassadors fear that if Washington sidesteps the U.N. to attack
Iraq, the result will be irreparable damage to the institution that
should be at the center of international affairs, not on the margins.</LD>
<TE>   "The U.S. must accept that multilateral diplomacy is multilateral
diplomacy -- not unilateral diplomacy accepted by the rest," a
council diplomat said. "We fear that forcing the machinery of the
U.N. would break it."</TE>
<TE>   How the debate is resolved may shape the way future conflicts are
addressed in the new world order -- with or without the U.N.</TE>
<TE>   By taking on the United States in the Security Council, France has
in effect made itself the standard-bearer for every other country
that is worried about the extent of U.S. power.</TE>
<TE>   Citing the need to uphold international law and to preserve the
United Nations' global role, France has proposed a two-step process
to prevent the U.S. from using ambiguous language in a U.N.
resolution to trigger automatic action against Iraq. One French
resolution would strengthen the weapons inspection process, and if
inspections failed, the entire council would discuss the
consequences. A majority of the Security Council's 15 members have
said they support France's proposal.</TE>
<TE>   In the process, French leaders have reaffirmed themselves as
crucial players in the U.N., the Middle East and the European Union
-- a role they reportedly relish.</TE>
<TE>   "France is not interested in arguing with the United States," a
French diplomat said recently in Paris. "This is a matter of
principle. This is about the rules of the game in the world today.
About putting the Security Council in the center of international
life. And not permitting a nation, whatever nation it may be, to do
what it wants, when it wants, where it wants. It all depends on the
kind of world in which we want our children to live."</TE>
<TE>   French diplomats also recognize that they must maintain a delicate
balance in their diplomatic drive. Push too hard, and they may be
left out in the cold, the way Germany has been in the Iraq debate.
Paris also worries about destabilization in the Middle East because
of its commercial and political interests there and because of
potential street unrest among the approximately 6 million French
Muslims, Europe's biggest Islamic community.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing worse for France than having a war against Iraq
would be not supporting a war and having it go ahead anyway," said
Philip H. Gordon, director of the Brookings Institution's Center on
the United States and France.</TE>
<TE>   At the U.N., the U.S. has its own calculus to consider. It must
calibrate how much the U.N. can help it achieve its agenda versus how
much the world body might curtail it.</TE>
<TE>   As long as the United States stays engaged in the United Nations,
it tacitly accepts boundaries on its power in exchange for the
benefits of multilateral backing. With U.N. approval, other nations
would share the cost of an attack on Iraq and the long-term
nation-building that must occur afterward. If the U.S. goes it alone,
fewer countries will be willing to share the burden -- not only for
Iraq but for other international ventures, such as anti-terrorism
drives.</TE>
<TE>   Washington knows that its presence lends gravity to the
institution. The four other veto-holding members of the Security
Council -- Britain, France, China and Russia -- derive power from
their status in the council. In the solemn, red-carpeted chamber,
each country has one vote and one veto. There is no superpower.</TE>
<TE>   But outside that room, reality comes to bear. In the real world,
U.S. military and economic power dwarfs every rival, and to most
countries, their relationship with the United States is more
important than their interest in Iraq. For those who are reluctant,
there are sweeteners: Russia wants guarantees for the nearly
$8-billion debt owed it by Iraq and, along with France, wants to
ensure that existing oil investments in the region are honored by a
post-Hussein government.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, when the U.S. was trying to garner the council's
unanimous support for the Persian Gulf War, Washington offered nearly
every developing country that was holding seats on the council
economic aid packages or military assistance, according to Phyllis
Bennis, a director at the Institute for Policy Studies, a
Washington-based think tank.</TE>
<TE>   There were also twisted arms. In 1990, Yemen and Cuba voted
against the resolution. After the vote, a U.S. diplomat told the
Yemeni ambassador -- unwittingly in front of a U.N. radio microphone
-- "That will be the most expensive 'no' vote you ever cast." Three
days later, the U.S. cut its entire $70-million aid package to Yemen.</TE>
<TE>   Although it is not clear whether the U.S. is preparing similar
threats for the Iraq resolution, observers say that the trend of U.S.
unilateralism and power politics is worrying.</TE>
<TE>   Diplomats and others say the Bush administration hasn't made its
own task easier by trumpeting the primacy of the United States. Many
point, in particular, to the administration's formal "National
Security Strategy," published last month, which boldly asserts that
the United States plans to prevent any combination of other countries
from ever challenging its supremacy.</TE>
<TE>   "Our forces will be strong enough to dissuade potential
adversaries from pursuing a military buildup in hopes of surpassing,
or equaling, the power of the United States," the report says.</TE>
<TE>   "The more we talk about our power, the more apprehension there is
around the world," said Edward C. Luck, director of the Center on
International Organization at Columbia University. "The more you talk
about it, the more other countries think the major security threat to
the world is the undisciplined use of American military power."</TE>
<TE>   Even before the National Security manifesto, European nations and
other smaller powers were increasingly resentful -- or fearful -- of
U.S. might and unilateralism.</TE>
<TE>   Although the United States argues that the majority of its
multilateral efforts are overshadowed by a handful of symbolic
withdrawals, its image has been damaged.</TE>
<TE>   To circumvent the United Nations to attack Iraq and perhaps topple
Hussein would be a shortsighted move with long-term effects, said
Richard Dicker, director of the International Justice Program at New
York-based Human Rights Watch.</TE>
<TE>   It would signal "the triumph of power over law and might over
right," Dicker said. "Even the world's sole superpower benefits from
a world order based on the rule of law."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Bosnia-Herzegovina's government has imposed a ban on all exports of
arms and military equipment after its Serbian region was caught
violating the U.N. arms embargo on Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   The move followed the removal Monday night of the Bosnian Serb
defense minister and army chief, which brought to five the number of
Bosnian Serb officials punished over the export of parts for Iraqi
MIG-21 aircraft by the state-owned Orao factory.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this month, the government assumed authority for the
export of arms from the country's two autonomous regions, the
Republika Srpska and the Muslim-Croat Federation.</LD>

<LD>Kenya will hold elections Dec. 27 to pick a successor to President
Daniel Arap Moi, electoral officials announced.</LD>
<LD>   The contest for the nation's third leader since independence from
Britain in 1963 will pit political neophyte Uhuru Kenyatta, 42,
against Mwai Kibaki, 71, a former vice president and two-time
presidential candidate.</LD>
<LD>   The elections, which will also include voting for parliamentary
seats, are seen as a test for good governance. Kenyatta is Moi's
choice, but opposition forces are warning that he would be a puppet
for Moi and perpetuate what they call Moi's corrupt rule.</LD>

<DL>CATANIA, Sicily</DL>
<LD>A series of earthquakes rocked this island Tuesday, leaving hundreds
of families temporarily homeless as Mt. Etna spewed lava and ash for
a third day running.</LD>
<LD>   The Italian government declared a state of emergency for the
volcano area, and the Defense Ministry sent in 1,000 soldiers. A ship
equipped with a medical clinic was positioned off the city of
Catania.</LD>
<LD>   In the town of Santa Venerina, at the foot of the volcano, several
people suffered minor injuries as they scrambled for safety, said
Carmela Floreno, a civil defense official in Catania.</LD>
<TE>   "We were really lucky that we were outside when it hit," said
tearful Santa Venerina resident Maria Lagana. "Nobody was hurt, but
can you imagine the terror with all these children around?"</TE>
<TE>   Civil Defense headquarters in Rome said the largest earthquake had
a magnitude of 4.4, according to a preliminary reading.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities evacuated about 1,000 people from homes near the
volcano until buildings could be checked for structural damage,
Floreno said. Residents were given refuge in tents and hotels.</TE>
<TE>   The volcano erupted Sunday, sending streams of lava down the
10,990-foot mountain and causing ash to rain from the sky. The lava
and ash activity was less intense Tuesday, but the airport in Catania
remained closed for a third day. Schools in Catania and nearby towns
were also closed.</TE>
<TE>   Etna is Europe's most active volcano. Its last major eruption was
in 1992.</TE>

<HD>3 Released Afghans Describe Captivity</HD>
<DH>Guantanamo inmates were interrogated and kept in small
cells, but were treated 'well.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Three Afghans released after months of captivity at a U.S. military
base in Cuba said Tuesday that they were chained up during
interrogations and kept in small cells but were treated decently by
the Americans.</LD>
<LD>   The two elderly men -- who appeared to be in their 70s -- and a
younger man are the first former detainees to discuss their arrest
and detainment at Guantanamo Bay. They spoke at a military hospital
in Kabul, the Afghan capital, where they were convalescing under the
watch of Afghan security guards.</LD>
<LD>   The three were flown from Guantanamo to Afghanistan on Sunday and
were handed over to Interior Ministry officials Tuesday. It was not
clear when they would be allowed to go home.</LD>
<TE>   The trio, looking frail and tired but in good spirits, said they
had not been allowed to contact their families after they were
captured by the Americans. They said that they were chained up during
frequent interrogations but that they were not mistreated and were
allowed to practice their religion.</TE>
<TE>   "They interrogated us for hours at a time. They wanted to know:
'Where are you from? Are you a member of the Taliban? Did you support
the Taliban? Were your relatives Taliban? Did the Taliban give you
weapons?' " said Mohammed Hagi Fiz, an elderly man with a white
beard.</TE>
<TE>   Fiz said he was arrested by U.S. forces eight months ago while he
was in a clinic in the central province of Oruzgan.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why the Americans arrested me. I told them I was
innocent. I'm just an old man," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A plastic wristband indicated that the year of Fiz's birth was
1931, but he claimed to be 105. Another prisoner, Mohammed Sadiq,
claimed to be 90 and said he was arrested in the eastern province of
Paktia. Many Afghans are not aware of their exact age, and birth
certificates usually don't exist, but both men appeared to be in
their 70s.</TE>
<TE>   Sadiq said that he was captured at his home and that the prison
conditions were spartan.</TE>
<TE>   "We were held in small cages," he said. "We were eating and
defecating at the same place. We were kept like animals."</TE>
<TE>   Fiz, however, said the American guards were respectful of him.
"They treated us well. We had enough food to eat. We could pray and
wash with water five times a day. We had the Koran and read it all
the time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The third former prisoner, Jan Mohammed, 35, said he was forced to
fight alongside the Taliban and was captured last year by Afghan
forces and handed over to the Americans.</TE>

<HD>GI Most Likely Killed by U.S.</HD>
<DH>Draft report on March incident in Afghanistan points to
AC-130 gunship.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Hendren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A military investigation is expected to conclude that the first U.S.
soldier killed in the largest battle in Afghanistan died as a result
of "friendly fire" from an Air Force gunship, a senior Pentagon
official said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a draft
report on the incident blames the deaths of Army Chief Warrant
Officer Stanley L. Harriman and three Afghan fighters on fire from an
AC-130 that had been circling over a mountainous region near the city
of Gardez where Osama bin Laden had reportedly hidden.</LD>
<LD>   Harriman's death March 2 was originally blamed on enemy mortar
fire that pounded his convoy as it moved into position under a
barrage so intense that it sent the Americans' Afghan allies into
retreat. He was the first of eight Americans killed during the
opening weekend of Operation Anaconda, the deadliest battle for U.S.
troops.</LD>
<TE>   Army Gen. Tommy Franks, who directs the war in Afghanistan as head
of the U.S. Central Command, confirmed the existence of a draft
report but told a Pentagon briefing Tuesday that he had not read it.
He said the report was being edited to delete classified information
on the methods used by special operations troops operating the
gunships.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation of the incident began after commanders picked up
simultaneous radio reports, one of a soldier gunned down --
ostensibly by enemy mortar fire -- and a second of the gunship pilot
reporting an attack on suspected Al Qaeda fighters, a second senior
defense official said.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Air Force officials said they were surprised at the
investigation's findings, first reported by the New York Times. If
confirmed, the incident would mark the fourth American death by
friendly fire since the war began Oct. 7, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Three Army Green Berets and at least two dozen allied Afghan
fighters died Dec. 5 when an American B-52 bomber mistakenly dropped
a 2,000-pound satellite-guided bomb on them as they fought
pro-Taliban soldiers. Defense officials later concluded that an
American serviceman who had called for an airstrike relayed the wrong
numbers, giving his own position instead of the enemy's.</TE>
<TE>   Four allied Canadian soldiers were killed in April when two U.S.
F-16 pilots violated procedures and one overrode an order to hold his
fire, an investigation found.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, five Green Berets and Air Force special operations
soldiers were wounded and several Afghan allies were killed in a
strike by a Navy F/A-18 after a member of the crew confused the
coordinates of the target and friendly troops.</TE>
<TE>   Green Berets in Afghanistan say the AC-130, whose low-flying
rumble increases as it approaches the ground to strafe enemy
soldiers, was among the weapons most feared by Taliban soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   The heavily armed planes can loiter at relatively low speeds and
include side-mounted 105-millimeter Howitzers that spray withering
fire over a broad area. They have sensors that allow them to visually
or electronically identify friendly ground forces. It remains unclear
whether the equipment properly located Harriman, 34, of Wade, N.C.,
who should have been identifiable by tape on his helmet.</TE>

<HD>New Risk Seen for Africa's Elephant Herds</HD>
<DH>Five nations hope to relax ivory ban. Foes say the move
would increase poaching.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Davan Maharaj</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NAIROBI, Kenya</DL>
<LD>Rangers at Kenya's Tsavo East National Park recently stumbled upon a
macabre scene: a family of 10 elephants lying in large pools of their
crimson blood.</LD>
<LD>   Some corpses were upturned; others were frozen on their knees as
if they had died begging. Their faces were hacked away so that the
poachers who killed them could extract every inch of their tusks.</LD>
<LD>   A similar slaughter unfolded last month at Niassa National Park in
Mozambique, where helicopter patrol pilot Phil Matthews discovered 20
slain elephants in four days. Witnessing the dead pachyderms with
missing tusks, Matthews said, he was struck by a thought: "Someone
must be stockpiling ivory knowing that it's going to be legal soon."</LD>
<TE>   Five southern African countries have been lobbying vigorously to
relax the international ban on ivory sales. This weekend, wildlife
authorities from 150 countries will gather in Chile to decide whether
to permit those five nations to sell their stockpiles and open a
permanent trade in ivory for the first time in 12 years. Many
conservationists say the decision could determine the ability of
Earth's largest land mammal to survive.</TE>
<TE>   Wildlife experts who support the ban point to a recent spike in
poaching as an indication of what will happen if the trade is
reopened. In Kenya alone, poachers have killed 70 elephants this
year, compared with 54 in 2001, according to wildlife officials. Some
hunters have been armed with assault weapons, and one even had a
rocket-propelled grenade.</TE>
<TE>   "Lifting the ivory ban will be bad news for elephants," said Paula
Kahumbu, a top official with the Kenya Wildlife Service. "Elephants
are far from being safe, and if ivory sales are allowed, there is the
possibility that elephants could be wiped out in some countries."</TE>
<TE>   The recent killings, Kahumbu and other officials say, are a
reminder of the rampant poaching of the 1970s and '80s that halved
Africa's elephant population, from 1.3 million to about 625,000.</TE>
<TE>   Ivory largely went out of vogue in 1990 after 150 countries
belonging to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species effectively banned trading in elephant products.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the elephant herds in some African countries have
swelled. Botswana now boasts 120,000 elephants, up from 51,000 in
1987. South Africa has about 13,000 -- nearly 5,000 more than in
1987.</TE>
<TE>   In some countries, culling is necessary to keep the herds at
manageable, healthy levels. Some African countries allow big-game
hunters to participate but charge up to $15,000 for the experience.</TE>
<TE>   South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Zambia want the ban
to be partially lifted so they can sell about 90 tons of ivory --
taken from culled elephants and those that died naturally -- to eager
buyers in Japan for about $9 million. A similar, one-time sale in
1999 saw 50 tons sold to Japan for $5 million.</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps more significant, those five nations also want
permission to sell ivory on an ongoing basis -- a total of 13 tons a
year.</TE>
<TE>   South African authorities say they have virtually eradicated
poaching at famed Kruger National Park. They have collected 30 tons
of ivory and 152 tons of elephant hides, and money from any sale of
those items would be used to buy more parkland and relocate elephants
to other national parks, said Moshibudi Rampedi, director of South
Africa's Department of Tourism and Environmental Affairs.</TE>
<TE>   "We've managed our elephants well," she said. "Why should we be
penalized if others haven't done the same?"</TE>
<TE>   But wildlife officials in India and Kenya, as well as other
countries in East and West Africa, fear that if the trade reopens,
poachers will target the elephant populations and stretch the already
inadequate wildlife patrols.</TE>
<TE>   Esmond Martin, who monitors the illegal trade in ivory for several
conservation groups, said he fears that a new legal trade could
stimulate demand for ivory products and drive up the price --
providing poachers with greater incentives.</TE>
<TE>   "If the price goes up, more people will go into killing
elephants," said Martin, who recently completed an extensive study on
the ivory trade in Asia. "In many of these countries, there is no
alternative income. What does a Sierra Leonean or a Liberian or a
Somali have for alternative employment? Almost nothing. So the price
goes up, and people switch over to the ivory business."</TE>
<TE>   The illegal killing of elephants and other wildlife has other,
not-so-obvious consequences, Martin said.</TE>
<TE>   "Poaching encourages massive government corruption, because
poachers need to bribe customs and government officials to move the
ivory," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In countries such as Kenya and India, where wildlife tourism
brings in hundreds of millions of dollars, poaching could have a
detrimental effect on the economy by scaring away tourists. And
confrontations between law enforcement officials and poachers can be
deadly: In the late 1980s and early '90s, authorities killed at least
165 Zambian poachers who were hunting elephants and rhinoceroses in
the Zambezi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   For thousands of years, wealthy elites have prized ivory's white
glow for figurines, furniture, sword handles and religious
implements, said Martin, who has written several books and articles
on ivory.</TE>
<TE>   Today, demand for elephant tusks in Asia -- especially China,
where signature seals and game pieces made from ivory are prized
gifts -- is putting pressure on Asian and African elephant
populations. Chinese authorities recently seized 3 tons of ivory that
records show were shipped through Kenya. A month earlier, 6 tons of
ivory from Zambia were confiscated in Singapore.</TE>
<TE>   A report released early this month by the British-based network
TRAFFIC, which monitors illegal wildlife trading, found that the
growing economic power of consumers in China is helping drive ivory
demand worldwide. The study also found that poor law enforcement in
China, Thailand and some African countries was responsible for
perpetuating the illegal trade in ivory.</TE>
<TE>   "The single most important factor in the illegal killing of
elephants is ... unregulated domestic markets in Africa and Asia,"
said Tom Milliken, an author of the report.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the largely unregulated ivory market in Sudan supplies
finished ivory figurines, jewelry and other items to the Malaysian
and Chinese workers who operate oil companies in the African
country's war-torn south.</TE>
<TE>   In the Omdurman market near the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, not
far from where the Blue Nile and the White Nile meet, an ivory
merchant offered to sell 60 tusks -- for about $75 apiece -- to a
visitor in his shop.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the tusks sold in Sudan come from the region's conflict
zones. Baggara Arab traders load camels with ivory from southern
Sudan, the Central African Republic and Congo, where elephants are
virtually unprotected.</TE>
<TE>   Using one of the oldest trade routes in the world, they shepherd
the camels hundreds of miles to southern Egypt, where the tusks are
sold to Egyptian dealers and carvers. The camels are sent to the
famous camel market in Cairo.</TE>
<TE>   A small share of the tusks ends up in the hands of Majdi Hassan
Osman, whose family has been carving and selling ivory items at an
Omdurman store known simply as Gift Shop for the last
quarter-century. Small animal figures are offered for about $10,
Indian-style bangles for $20 and walking sticks for $200. Osman
encourages haggling.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, a Chinese restaurateur ordered 150 ivory chopsticks.
Osman was elated.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he knew that elephants were being slaughtered for these
items, Osman replied: "Most of the ivory comes from elephants who
fight against each other and die."</TE>
<TE>   Conservationists say the unregulated ivory trade in Sudan and
elsewhere needs to be controlled before trade is reopened. Once ivory
enters the market, consumers have no way of telling the difference
between legal and illegal ivory.</TE>
<TE>   Conservation groups have offered to buy the ivory stockpiled by
the southern African nations and destroy it. But the proposals have
fallen apart over conditions sought by both sides.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, proponents of the ban continue to press their
argument that elephants are worth more alive, as tourist magnets,
than dead.</TE>
<TE>   "The countries that want to sell ivory can use their elephants for
far greater value," said Kahumbu, of Kenya's wildlife service. "Ivory
is simply for the pleasure of rich people in the East. It's a shame
that Africa is selling these animals for these people who only
appreciate elephants for their teeth."</TE>

<HD>Jordan Questions Dozens Over Diplomat's Slaying</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>AMMAN, Jordan</DL>
<LD>Jordanian officials detained dozens of Muslim militants for
questioning Tuesday but dismissed claims by a little-known group that
it was responsible for the killing of U.S. diplomat Laurence Foley.</LD>
<LD>   The group, calling itself Shurafaa al Urdun, or the Honorables of
Jordan, sent a statement to the London-based Arabic daily Al Quds al
Arabi on Monday saying Foley was killed to protest U.S. support for
Israel and the "bloodshed in Iraq and Afghanistan."</LD>
<LD>   Jordanian officials who spoke on condition of anonymity dismissed
the claim from Shurafaa al Urdun, which was unknown until last year
when it claimed it was behind the killing of an Israeli businessman
near where Foley lived. Security officials also rejected that claim.</LD>
<TE>   A government official said dozens of militants known to police had
been detained for questioning by intelligence officials. Some were
later released and none were charged.</TE>
<TE>   Foley, 60, an administrator at the U.S. Agency for International
Development, was killed outside his home Monday.</TE>

<HD>Dissension Marks N. Korea-Japan Talks</HD>
<DH>Communist nation rejects Tokyo's demands concerning nuclear
arms and abductees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia</DL>
<LD>Japan and North Korea held a contentious round of talks Tuesday on
normalizing relations but remained far apart on the key issues of
North Korea's nuclear arms program and Japanese citizens abducted
decades ago.</LD>
<LD>   The two-day talks, the first full-scale negotiations between the
countries in two years, are under an international spotlight as
pressure mounts on the North Korean government to scrap a nuclear
arms program it has pursued in violation of a 1994 agreement.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, North Korea rejected Japan's demand that it abandon
the program, saying it could resolve the problem only in talks with
the United States.</LD>
<TE>   North Korea also rejected Tokyo's demand that a firm date be set
for children of five surviving abductees now visiting their homeland
to go to Japan to discuss their future. North Korean officials said
Japan had "broken its promise" to send back the five, and it demanded
their return.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides did agree, however, to start working-level talks on
the abduction issue, an emotional topic for the Japanese public and
its politicians.</TE>
<TE>   The Japanese and North Korean officials devoted most of Tuesday's
talks to the nuclear arms program and the abductees.</TE>
<TE>   Japan's top negotiator, Katsunari Suzuki, said after the talks
that "not much progress" had been made on the key issues.</TE>
<TE>   Still, officials said talks would continue as scheduled today.</TE>
<TE>   "Japan wants to focus on the abduction and security issues," said
Pak Ryong Yeon, the North Korean delegation's No. 2 official. "But
our thinking is that if we work toward diplomatic ties, then the
security issues will be solved along the way."</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell warned that
North Korea faced a grim economic future unless it complied with
demands to end the nuclear program.</TE>
<TE>   "No North Korean child can eat enriched uranium," Powell told a
news conference. "It is fool's gold for North Korea."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Rejects Chechen Separatist Chief</HD>
<DH>Aslan Maskhadov is labeled 'damaged goods' after the taking
of hostages at a Moscow theater by rebels from the Caucasus region.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Dixon and David Holley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>The leader of Chechnya's separatist movement, Aslan Maskhadov, was
repudiated and isolated Tuesday after a senior U.S. official called
him "damaged goods" with links to terrorism in the wake of last
week's seizure of a Moscow theater by bomb-toting Chechens.</LD>
<LD>   America's tough rejection of the former Chechen president, whom
Washington had previously viewed as a potential negotiating partner
with the Russians, leaves the U.S. position on the separatist
republic broadly in line with that of Moscow.</LD>
<LD>   While Washington still expresses concerns about abuses by Russian
troops in Chechnya, the U.S. official -- who spoke on condition he
not be identified -- stressed strong condemnation of Maskhadov and
the hostage-takers at the theater. He declared that the Chechen
leader should be excluded from any peace talks.</LD>
<TE>   Maskhadov's spokesman, Ahmed Zakayev, has denied that Maskhadov
was involved in the attack and has denounced terrorism, but he has
said he could understand why the Chechens took their action. The
theater standoff ended Saturday when Russian forces stormed the
building, leaving about 50 of the attackers and more than 100 of the
hostages dead.</TE>
<TE>   Underscoring the harm the attackers did to the Chechens' cause
internationally, the U.S. official said Maskhadov had failed to
disassociate himself from terrorism. Withdrawal of Russian forces
from Chechnya was the key demand of the hostage-takers.</TE>
<TE>   Chechens won a degree of autonomy for their republic in the
Caucasus region after defeating Russian troops in a 1994-96 war.
Russian forces marched back into the republic in 1999 and have
battled guerrillas there since.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to a sense of crisis in Moscow, a rebel missile brought
down a Russian military helicopter in Chechnya on Tuesday, killing
four soldiers, authorities said. Defense and security officials met
with President Vladimir V. Putin, then pledged even tougher measures
against Chechen separatists.</TE>
<TE>   Putin's stance appeared to be paying off in terms of popular
support. A poll by the All-Russia Public Opinion Center released
Tuesday showed that 85% of respondents approved of Putin's handling
of the theater standoff. Russian health authorities have said that in
addition to nearly all the hostage-takers, 118 people died in the
incident, all but two from a gas used to knock out most of those in
the theater before Russian forces stormed it.</TE>
<TE>   Washington has long labeled the Chechen conflict as an internal
Russian problem and criticized Russian methods there, but Tuesday's
comments confirm a marked shift in policy.</TE>
<TE>   By early September, the U.S. ambassador to Moscow, Alexander
Vershbow, was saying publicly that America viewed Maskhadov with
"increasing skepticism" but that he should still be included in any
peace talks.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking Tuesday about the hostage ordeal, Vershbow said that some
lives probably could have been saved if Russian authorities had given
medical personnel more information about the kind of gas used to
swiftly render most of those in the theater unconscious before the
assault by special forces.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear that with perhaps a little more information, at least
a few more of the hostages may have survived," Vershbow said.</TE>
<TE>   "To the best of our knowledge, based on our own doctors who
visited some of the American hostages and were able to do their own
assessment and talk to some of the Russian medical officials, we do
think that [the gas used] was an opiate," he added. He said he
believes it was a drug known as fentanyl, long used as an anesthetic
in hospitals in many countries. "But we have still not received
official confirmation of that fact from Russian authorities," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Vershbow said he wouldn't second-guess the Russian decision
to launch the assault. "They had a difficult decision to make, and
with the bombs that were there they probably saved hundreds of lives,
even if we regret that more than 100 died, largely as a result of the
gas," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some medical experts, however, have said that no general
anesthetic could have been delivered to the auditorium in sufficient
concentrations to put so many people to sleep so quickly.</TE>
<TE>   The All-Russia Public Opinion Center poll also asked whether
Russia should take a far tougher approach in Chechnya, comparable to
"resolute actions ... America has carried out after Sept. 11." Of
those surveyed, 54% said yes and 36% said no.</TE>
<TE>   Since the United States declared its war against terrorism, it has
accepted Russian warnings that Chechen fighters were linked to
international terrorism and the Al Qaeda network.</TE>
<TE>   The senior U.S. official who spoke Tuesday said that while there
was no evidence of a direct Al Qaeda link in last week's theater
siege, it was clear that Al Qaeda operatives had trained Chechen
fighters in Afghanistan and in Georgia's Pankisi Gorge, a lawless
area just across the border that Chechen fighters have used as a
refuge.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. concern about Maskhadov focuses on his links to another rebel
commander, Shamil Basayev.</TE>
<TE>   The concerns grew after a meeting of Chechen separatist commanders
last summer. The Kavkaz-Tsentr Web site, which conveys the position
of Chechen separatists, reported in August that Maskhadov chaired a
meeting of all the commanders, with Basayev as his deputy.</TE>
<TE>   The United States views Basayev, who took about 1,500 hostages at
a hospital in the Russian town of Budyonnovsk in 1995, as a
terrorist.</TE>
<TE>   The August meeting suggested reconciliation and cooperation
between Basayev and Maskhadov after earlier conflict.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. official said the affirmation that Maskhadov was working
with Basayev made Maskhadov an unsuitable negotiating partner.</TE>
<TE>   "He forfeited any legitimacy he had," the official said. "He's
either unwilling to stand up to terrorists or incapable of it."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials now believe it is up to Chechens to find an
alternative leader who can negotiate a peace process with Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   But with Maskhadov and Basayev the main fighters leading the
separatist revolt, it is difficult to see how a realistic peace deal
could be forged in their absence.</TE>
<TE>   The official said the separatists must sever links to
international terrorism and rethink their tactics before they can
regain any legitimacy.</TE>
<TE>   At least nine foreigners died in the theater incident, including
an American, a Dutch citizen, an Austrian, three Ukrainians, an
Armenian, a Belarussian and a 13-year-old girl from Kazakhstan,
Russian authorities said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Embassy officials were closely involved in attempts to free
the hostages. On the last night of the siege, they received several
panicky phone calls from Sandy Alan Booker, the American who died,
speaking at gunpoint. Booker was increasingly fearful for his life as
the night wore on.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said 418 former hostages had been released from
hospitals by Tuesday and 245 remained hospitalized, 16 in grave
condition. Of about 50 attackers killed, 41 or 42 were shot, some
while they were unconscious from the gas.</TE>
<TE>   The Moscow Health Department said Tuesday that 44 people,
including 42 hostage-takers, died of gunshot wounds, while Moscow
Chief Prosecutor Mikhail Avdyukov put the total shooting deaths at
45, including at least 41 hostage-takers.</TE>

<DL>ALMATY, Kazakhstan</DL>
<LD>A manned Soyuz rocket blasted off from Russia's Baikonur cosmodrome
in Kazakhstan today, headed for the International Space Station,
Russia's Mission Control said.</LD>
<LD>   "The Soyuz-TMA booster rocket lifted as planned.... Everything is
fine," a spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   The launch of the rocket, which was originally scheduled for
Monday, was delayed after the fatal explosion of a Soyuz cargo rocket
of a similar type shortly after takeoff from Russia's Arctic Plesetsk
cosmodrome Oct. 15.</LD>
<TE>   Russian space officials said the explosion was caused by a foreign
object in the rocket's engine. It has not been determined how it got
there.</TE>
<TE>   On their 12-day mission, the two Russians and one Belgian aboard
the Soyuz-TMA are to replace a rescue capsule at the space station,
currently operated by two Russians and an American.</TE>

<HD>Vatican to Make Public Pre-WWII Archives</HD>
<DH>Documents from 1922 to 1939, before the reign of Pope Pius
XII, will be opened. Move aims to counter criticism of the papacy's
wartime role.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>VATICAN CITY</DL>
<LD>The Vatican, trying to counter charges that the papacy was silent in
the face of the Holocaust, confirmed Tuesday that it will open up
secret archives from the years leading up to World War II.</LD>
<LD>   The archives include documents from 1922 to 1939. Eugenio Pacelli
was Vatican ambassador in Berlin during part of this period before
becoming Pope Pius XII. Also to be made available are letters to the
Vatican from people looking for prisoners of war and others who
disappeared between 1940 and '46.</LD>
<LD>   Cardinal Jorge Maria Mejia, the Vatican's librarian, said the
archival material will be available through the Holy See's Web site
in January.</LD>
<TE>   "Of course, the archives are of great interest to the media,"
Mejia said at a news conference.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of Pius XII argue that he failed to raise his voice and
use his position to head off the extermination of European Jews by
the Nazis. Defenders insist that he made every effort possible to
help Jews and others.</TE>
<TE>   The Vatican's position is that Pius did not speak out more
forcefully for fear of worsening the fate of Roman Catholics, as well
as Jews, in Germany and Nazi-occupied countries.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no doubt that opening up these archives is an important
decision; the problem is that they don't even refer to the most
important period, which is during the war itself," said Amos
Luzzatto, head of the Union of Italian-Jewish Communities.</TE>
<TE>   Scholars and Jewish groups around the world have asked the Vatican
to open the archives relating to Pius before and during his
pontificate, which ended with his death in 1958.</TE>

<HD>Building Fire in Vietnam Kills 59</HD>
<DH>An American may be among the dead. Toll is blamed in part
on lack of proper equipment.</DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam</DL>
<LD>A massive blaze tore through a large building in downtown Ho Chi Minh
City on Tuesday, killing at least 59 people and injuring more than
100.</LD>
<LD>   Firefighters battled the inferno for hours, but inadequate
equipment and intense flames and heat kept them from reaching many
victims trapped in the Saigon International Trade Center, a six-story
building that housed shops, offices and a popular disco.</LD>
<LD>   A wedding reception with about 500 guests was being held in the
building when the fire broke out, Ho Chi Minh City Television said,
and an American insurance company with offices there was conducting a
training seminar for about 100 employees.</LD>
<TE>   At least two Britons and possibly a Vietnamese American were among
the dead, but officials had not named them. Six insurance company
employees were reported missing.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters used ladder trucks to help some people escape from
the roof, but they were unable to reach at least one man who cried
for help from a window because they lacked the proper equipment.
Flames raged at other windows.</TE>
<TE>   "What is worrying is that firefighters were not equipped with the
necessary equipment to put out the fire," Vietnam Television said.
"It took them more than three hours to bring the water hose inside
the building, and sometimes they did not have enough water."</TE>
<TE>   The American International Assurance Co. was conducting a training
program for insurance agents when the fire began, a company official
said. In addition to the six missing employees, about 30 were
injured, some seriously, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital officials said more than 100 people were hospitalized,
many with serious injuries -- some from burns and some from leaps
from windows. State media said the death toll was likely to rise.</TE>
<TE>   Police were still investigating the cause of the fire but
suspected an electrical short circuit, the official Vietnam News
Agency said</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Le Thanh Hai said the fire was the city's worst in both loss
of life and property damage.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Responsibilities After a Defeat of Iraq</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Daniel Serwer makes valid points in his Oct. 28 commentary ("Victory
Is Just the Beginning") about the responsibilities of an invader to
those invaded. No "moral" justification for an invasion can erase the
destruction of life, property and potential. The U.S. recognized this
obligation in the creation of the Marshall Plan after World War II.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration has given no indication, despite numerous
opportunities, that it has any plan for fulfilling our
responsibilities following an invasion of Iraq. Indeed, the
administration's dismal performance in that regard in Afghanistan
would indicate that neglect or exploitation (the proposed pipeline)
is the only "plan." This is just one of many reasons I vehemently
oppose war with Iraq.</LD>

<TE>   We've been practicing restraint for the past 11 years. We've had a
quarantine (sanctions) in place for the last 11 years. Saddam Hussein
(with some help from our friends and enemies) has evaded that
quarantine for the past 11 years. It's past time for Plan B. What
does Ann Louise Bardach suppose President Kennedy would have done if
the Soviets had tried to run the blockade?</TE>

<TE>   What is happening in the U.S.? On Sunday, The Times compared the
Cuban missile crisis to our present standoff with Iraq. The
difference is clearly in the quality of the leadership. We were
fortunate enough to have had leaders who did not resort to infantile
name-calling and dehumanizing verbiage to incite the easily misled
public with glib jingoism, as is now the case. The public needs clear
information, facts and not stirred emotions. We have been lied to
through Vietnam and the Gulf War. Our veterans have been ill treated
by our own government as a result of both engagements, and the public
has been repeatedly misled. It is time the U.S. government begins to
respect those it serves, with facts and verifiable information so the
public can make informed and reasoned decisions. We need to be able
to trust those in charge of our security, and the only way to achieve
this is with honest disclosure and open discussion. It is reckless
disregard of our democratic process to do anything less.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Peering Into Darkness," Commentary, Oct. 27: Speaking out
against going to war with Iraq has nothing to do with cowardice or
bravery, it's about what's morally right and wrong. Fortunately, most
Americans are able to distinguish between the two and don't view
waging war against a much smaller Third World country as a test of
their manhood. It would be easy for the average American to go about
daily life while his tax dollars were being spent turning Iraqi men,
women and children to dust.</TE>

<HD>Chief Bratton Can Build on Valley Graffiti Effort</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Bratton Is Planning a Clean Start," Oct. 25: I am an L.A. County
Superior Court commissioner, assigned to the Sylmar Juvenile Court.
It was our court that created the first anti-graffiti hotline. We are
certainly behind LAPD Chief William Bratton in his task.</LD>
<LD>   At the Juvenile Court, we have been involved in the close
supervision of graffiti taggers for quite some time now. We place a
serious emphasis on keeping the neighborhoods we serve and the people
in those neighborhoods aware of tagging activity. We were involved
when the Community Tagger Task Force was created and implemented in
the San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   The task force works closely with the community groups in the
Valley that gather information and photograph vandalism and place it
in a database. The Probation Department assigned a special "tagger"
supervision officer to us who keeps track of the vandals under our
supervision. It is not always easy to coordinate all the different
factions of any big department, especially when we're dealing with
city, county and state agencies, but the task force has successfully
managed to gather information on tagging crews and gang activity and,
we hope, prevent some individuals from being hurt or suffering
property damage.</LD>
<TE>   As to the comment about the Graffiti Habitual Offender Suppression
Team, I am amazed at the lack of information provided to the chief.
The GHOST squad was an invention of then-Metropolitan Transportation
Authority Police Chief Sharon Papa, now with the LAPD. The GHOST
squad worked undercover throughout the public transportation system
to apprehend vandals who cost the MTA millions of dollars. It was
quite successful.</TE>

<LD>Re "Nurses Locked Out in Pension Fight," Oct. 24: Having recently
undergone surgery for advanced ovarian cancer, I know what it's like
to be solely dependent on a stranger when you're in no condition to
sit up on your own, stand, walk, go to the bathroom, brush your
teeth, get through the pain and even fall asleep without the help of
a nurse.</LD>
<LD>   I thank God that my nurses had that time to help me. I'm thankful
there were enough nurses on my floor to look after every one of us,
for the assurances and smiles that made me less scared and for never
being abandoned or forgotten or suffering needless pain. Long Beach
nurses are on the right track to remind their hospital that they
share a responsibility to patients -- together -- and that the
hospital must help them provide the best care possible. I hope for
the patients' sake that the hospital listens.</LD>

<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Nursing Crisis Is a Threat to Health," as the headline of your
Oct. 24 commentary says, not only for patients but also for nurses
because of the physical, mental and emotional stress brought on by
heavy workloads carried often without sufficient help from nursing
assistants, a crucial link in the proper care of hospital patients. A
good aide can make all the difference, allowing RNs more quality time
to give to their patients. However, another extremely important
connection is the often strained relationship with physicians.</TE>
<TE>   As long as doctors, starting from the first-year resident to the
specialist and surgeon, relegate nurses to the bottom of the
hierarchy -- but expect them to be responsible for every aspect of a
patient's care -- the high burnout rate will continue.</TE>
<TE>   Nurses are professional and courteous not only to their patients
but also to patients' families, supervisors, physicians, residents,
therapists and technicians, no matter how tired and stressed. As long
as physicians are not being challenged to do the same, too many
demagogues will continue to make nursing an unsatisfying career --
and get away with it.</TE>

<LD>Re "Don't Close the Door on Halloween Tradition," Voices, Oct. 26:</LD>
<LD>   Linda Williamson rightly bemoans the transformation of Halloween
from a time of neighborhood treats and a few tricks to traffic jams
of parents looking for lighted porches. Fear of tainted candy and
strangers is traditional. What's new is the scarcity of lighted
porches. I agree that the cultural changes taking place are in part a
result of fear induced by 24-hour coverage of news events, but I
would offer another reason for the shift in attitude: the loss of
civility.</LD>
<LD>   My neighbors and I used to decorate our houses and anticipate the
visits of ghosts and goblins. A few years ago we started to realize
that the kids were not from our neighborhood. In addition, their
parents were leaving their fast-food trash, dirty diapers and
occasional beer bottles in the street.</LD>
<TE>   The final straw for me came when a young father, who looked like a
gangbanger, demanded candy for the infant held in his arms. My lights
are out ... for good.</TE>

<LD>I have just finished my semiannual chore of changing clocks and

necessary. It was instituted during World War II as an energy-saving
measure for war production. Now, it is simply an old custom that has
outlived its usefulness from time zone to time zone.</LD>
<LD>   Isn't it about time for our lawmakers to remove this outdated
notion from the books and keep us at the same time all year round?</LD>

<HD>Davis' Need for Funds: It's the Air Time</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>George Skelton was right in his Oct. 28 Capitol Journal column,
pointing out that Gov. Gray Davis didn't invent our corrupt and
corrupting campaign finance system. A free-air-time proposal
sponsored by Sen. John McCain and others offers one way to improve
the system. Federal legislation would require that television and
radio stations provide real campaign coverage in the weeks leading up
to elections. Debates, interviews, forums or other programs that air
issues could qualify.</LD>
<LD>   While each television and radio station is granted exclusive use
of a part of the public's airways, the stations make no payment for
it beyond a vague promise to provide public service. Stations are
providing less and less news coverage of campaigns and issues but
making more and more money from campaign ads. The huge cost of TV
advertising is a major cause of the need for candidates to join the
money chase that leads to the appearance of government for sale.</LD>
<LD>   Bill Stanton</LD>
<TE>   Garden Grove</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Davis Is Playing Parole Politics" (Commentary, Oct. 27) provides
ample support for dismissing Davis from his current position. If I
accept Earl Ofari Hutchinson's description of the facts -- a
reformed, repentant convicted murderer is approved for parole but
Davis denies it for his own political gain -- I cannot with good
conscience vote for our governor. We must expect our leaders to have
a clearer vision of right and wrong and to demonstrate courage.
Davis' actions should concern us.</TE>

<TE>   Vote for Davis. He approached Washington to discuss the energy
crisis. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Vice President Dick
Cheney and President Bush told him to get lost. The feds did nothing
while California businesses were paying extremely high electric bills
-- and going broke. So Davis dealt with the problem. We've had no
blackouts since, and electricity is reasonably priced again. Give the
guy credit!</TE>

such random death not just for a few weeks but day after day and year

<HD>Andre de Toth; Director's Director Known for 3-D 'House of
Wax'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Andre de Toth, independent in-your-face director, writer and producer
who created classic Westerns, film noir and arguably the best 3-D
movie ever made, "The House of Wax," has died. He was believed to be
89, although references to his birth year vary from 1910 to 1913.</LD>
<LD>   De Toth, an adventurer throughout his colorful life, died Sunday
of an aneurysm in his Burbank home.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps better known to film buffs than the public at large, he
was one of the last of the European-trained filmmakers who came to
the United States during World War II and made American genres his
own. In recent years, he had enjoyed a renewed popularity at film
festivals from Scotland to San Francisco and was greatly admired by
contemporary directors, including Quentin Tarantino and Martin
Scorsese.</LD>
<TE>   De Toth, who shared an Oscar nomination in 1950 for writing the
original story for "The Gunfighter" starring Gregory Peck, made about
three dozen Hollywood movies. Among them were cult favorites,
including 1944's "None Shall Escape," which predicted the winner of
World War II and the Nuremberg trials for Nazis to come.</TE>
<TE>   De Toth directed such films noir as 1948's "Pitfall," which he
co-wrote, starring Dick Powell, Jane Wyatt, Lizabeth Scott and
Raymond Burr, and "Crime Wave" with Sterling Hayden, Gene Nelson and
Phyllis Kirk.</TE>
<TE>   The director also created memorable Westerns, including "Ramrod"
starring Joel McCrea and Veronica Lake -- to whom De Toth was married
from 1944 to 1952 -- "Springfield Rifle" with Gary Cooper, "The
Indian Fighter" with Kirk Douglas, and half a dozen films with
Randolph Scott: "Man in the Saddle," "Carson City," "The Stranger
Wore a Gun," "Thunder Over the Plains," "Riding Shotgun" and "The
Bounty Hunter." For television, De Toth directed episodes of
"Maverick" and "The Westerner."</TE>
<TE>   But he will always be remembered for 1953's "House of Wax." The
movie launched Vincent Price into his horror film career and is still
regarded as the best of the three-dimensional lot, which required
viewers to wear special cardboard-framed Polaroid glasses.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike other directors playing with the new trick, De Toth
stressed character and plot over the special effects: Price was a
sculptor rebuilding his fire-destroyed collection by making statues
out of his murder victims.</TE>
<TE>   "Till now," De Toth told The Times when he was making the film,
"we have had only mental and emotional contact with you, the
audience. Now we have physical contact. Not only can we reach out and
touch you, but we will be able to reach your nerve centers through
your eyes -- give your stomach butterflies, make you recoil, set your
ticker pumping!"</TE>
<TE>   De Toth remained enthusiastic about 3-D long after its demise, and
was delighted when modern Imax techniques began re-creating the
effects. His own accomplishment was considered all the more
remarkable because he had lost an eye in his youth, destroying his
depth perception and therefore his ability to see the girl from his
film catapult into viewers' laps after her trapeze broke.</TE>
<TE>   Born Sasvrai Farkasfalvi Tothfalusi Toth Endre Antal Mihaly in
Mako, Hungary, the filmmaker had his first exhibit of paintings and
sculpture at age 14 and saw his first play produced at age 18. He
studied law at the University of Budapest but also began acting,
writing and working as a cameraman for cinematographer Istvan Eiben.</TE>
<TE>   De Toth was soon entrenched in the Hungarian film industry,
writing and directing. As war clouds gathered, he was forced to make
propaganda films for the Nazis, including recording their invasion of
Poland. In 1939, he went to England, where he worked as a second unit
director for Alexander Korda on "The Thief of Bagdad" and other
films.</TE>
<TE>   De Toth immigrated to Hollywood in 1942, and worked with Korda on
"The Jungle Book" and several other films. He made his own Hollywood
directing debut with the 1943 "Passport to Suez."</TE>
<TE>   Still considered an enfant terrible in his 80s, he was forever
pushing film codes with his frank depictions of violence and human
emotions. "Life is violent," he said simply in an interview with L.A.
Weekly earlier this year. "To depict it truthfully can show us what
not to do. Make us look at our ugly faces in the mirror."</TE>
<TE>   Asked a few years ago about his memorable "Gunfighter," De Toth
said he co-wrote the story to show "that gunfighters were stupid.
Killing is ridiculous; nature takes care of death. We don't have to
help it."</TE>
<TE>   Scorsese, interviewed in 1994 when several De Toth films were
shown at the Edinburgh Film Festival in Scotland, called him "a
director's director" and said: "There is tension in De Toth's visual
style that seems to reflect a continuous struggle between people and
their surroundings. Be it in his film noir or his Westerns, De Toth's
characters always move in a treacherous world where deception and
cynicism are aimed at one goal: survival."</TE>
<TE>   De Toth put his own life in danger frequently -- flying planes,
racing cars, frequenting war zones -- as he detailed in his 1994
autobiography, "Fragments: Portraits From the Inside," and a 1996
interview book, "De Toth on De Toth."</TE>
<TE>   Scouting for locations in Egypt shortly after the 1973 Yom Kippur
War, he related, he was mistaken for Moshe Dayan and kidnapped,
pistol-whipped and questioned by vengeful youths. He recounted other
scrapes, including blundering into a student demonstration in his
teens in Budapest, where he said he was shot and woke up in the
morgue; getting trapped with Korda in a cage with a tiger named
Rajah; and flying his own plane to an emergency landing in a
snowstorm with the radio on fire.</TE>
<TE>   Living, De Toth believed strongly, made one a better writer and
director. Eschewing film school graduates making movies today, he
wrote: "If they haven't lived much, it's their loss. Film schools
teach you absolutely nothing: The psychology of being a director,
it's not mechanics -- either you've got it or you ain't. The No. 1
requirement is understanding. A film director works with the most
sensitive instrument: human beings. Being exposed to life makes you
more understanding of the problems of people."</TE>
<TE>   De Toth also wrote about marrying seven women, including Lake,
with whom he went through bankruptcy in Los Angeles courts, and
having 19 children, including some stepchildren he adopted. He is
survived by his wife, Ann Green, and several of his children.</TE>

<HD>Edwin R. Bayley, 84; Journalist, Author</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mary Rourke</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Edwin R. Bayley, who died Sunday at the age of 84 in Green Bay, Wis.,
was the founding dean of the graduate school of journalism at UC
Berkeley and a searing critic of his fellow journalists for failing
to challenge Sen. Joseph McCarthy's sensationalist campaign against
communism in the early 1950s.</LD>
<LD>   Bayley was a Wisconsin political reporter during the McCarthy era.
More recently he divided his time between Carmel and Door County,
Wis. He had been in failing health for several months.</LD>
<LD>   A political reporter turned media analyst, Bayley published "Joe
McCarthy and the Press" in 1981, tracking McCarthy's rise to power
and the press corps' tacit acceptance of his sensationalist
statements. Perhaps the most shocking charge came in 1950, when
McCarthy claimed to have a list of 205 communists working in the
State Department. Bayley combed 131 newspapers' coverage of the
incident and concluded that too few reporters demanded, "Show us the
list."</LD>
<TE>   As chief political reporter for the Milwaukee Journal from 1947 to
1959, Bayley helped his newspaper earn a reputation as an adversary
of the headline-grabbing senator. Once, at a political rally that
Bayley was covering, McCarthy singled him out. "Stand up Ed," he
said, "let the people see what a communist looks like."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Chicago and raised in Wisconsin, Bayley got his
introduction to journalism working on the school newspaper at
Lawrence College in Appleton, where he graduated as an English major.
He went on to do graduate work at Yale, where he met his future wife,
Monica Worsley.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, he served as a gunnery officer in the Pacific
and joined the Milwaukee Journal after the war, covering local
politics as well as three presidential campaigns from 1948 to 1956.</TE>
<TE>   He left journalism in 1959 to work as a speech writer and chief of
staff for Wisconsin Gov. Gaylord Nelson. In the early 1960s he was a
special assistant on the staff of President Kennedy and went on to
become editor of public affairs programming for National Educational
Television in 1962.</TE>
<TE>   Bayley was named a professor and dean of UC Berkeley's graduate
school of journalism in 1969. When he retired 16 years later, the
faculty had grown from seven to 12 members and enrollment rose from
50 to 75 students. During his tenure, he dropped courses on public
relations, extended degree requirements to two years of study and
began a program for minority journalists.</TE>
<TE>   Among his academic honors and professional awards were the
Berkeley Citation, the highest honor awarded by the university, and
the George Polk Award for his book on McCarthy.</TE>
<TE>   Bayley is survived by a daughter, Mary Fisk; a son, Thomas; a
granddaughter; and a sister. A memorial service is pending.</TE>

<HD>When in Doubt, Kick Out?</HD>
<DH>FBI teams track immigrant terrorism suspects at great cost,
yet may not find conclusive evidence. Deportation emerges as a quick
fix.</DH>

<LD>More than a year before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, FBI agents
were aware that a Middle Eastern student at a U.S. college was making
anti-American statements and had contacts with militant groups
overseas.</LD>
<LD>   Just hours after the twin towers fell, the FBI placed the student
under around-the-clock surveillance.</LD>
<LD>   The decision required as many as eight agents per shift to monitor
the man's travels, from apartment to college, mosque to supermarket.
Another half-dozen agents listened in on his calls. Other agents
filed wiretap reports or handled aerial surveillance. Two supervisory
agents oversaw the case.</LD>
<TE>   In all, almost 40 agents were needed to tail one target. "If this
had been Manhattan or another city with a subway, we may have needed
even more people," said an agent who took part in the surveillance.
"I mean, if someone's on foot in New York, how you gonna follow them
in a car?"</TE>
<TE>   After several months, with resources stretched hopelessly thin,
the FBI agents shifted gears. They ended the surveillance and worked
with the Immigration and Naturalization Service to simply deport the
student on minor immigration violations.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he was ready to leave the area ... so we wanted to make
sure we did something," the agent said. Besides, he said, "the cost
was enormous."</TE>
<TE>   Since last September's attacks, federal authorities have wrestled
with a stark dilemma: Should they watch, or simply deport, scores of
illegal immigrants who may have crossed paths with terrorists?</TE>
<TE>   "For the FBI, at this moment in time, there are no good options in
a lot of these cases," said Sacramento Supervisory FBI Agent Frank
Scafidi. "A lot of times it comes down to dollars and cents.... We
just can't afford [surveillance] for as many people as we suspect
might have bad intentions."</TE>
<TE>   Added one federal prosecutor: "The prevailing sentiment is, 'Just
get them the hell out' " if they have visa or other immigration
violations.</TE>
<TE>   But if anyone deported on such charges turns out to be a terrorist
-- or an accomplice -- they may come back to haunt the U.S. by
assuming new identities and reentering the country.</TE>
<TE>   "Then, you are in some ways in a much worse position," said the
prosecutor, "because now you don't know where they are."</TE>
<TE>   Since last September, the INS has deported almost 500 people as a
direct result of the Justice Department investigation into terrorism.
Hundreds more have been forced to leave as a result of stepped-up
enforcement of immigration laws. It is likely that many people caught
in the dragnet do not support terrorism, but the government is taking
few chances.</TE>
<TE>   Nasir Al Mubarak, for example, had lived illegally in the U.S. for
a decade without incident. The Pakistani-born pilot faced deportation
for overstaying his student visa but was free on bail pending an
appeal on grounds that his marriage made him eligible for permanent
residency.</TE>
<TE>   That all changed on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Right after the attacks on New York and Washington, FBI agents
questioned the 35-year-old Sacramento-area resident about his
association with terrorist Abdul Hakim Murad. In 1995, Murad, a
Pakistani, was convicted of conspiring to blow up 12 U.S. airliners
over the Pacific Ocean.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, Mubarak acknowledged, he and Murad came to the U.S. to
attend flight schools, and lived together before Murad left the
country. Mubarak said he had long since lost track of Murad, but
after Sept. 11, federal authorities did not believe him and pressed
for his deportation. Ultimately, Mubarak agreed to leave and returned
in August to Pakistan, a country where he had last lived as a
toddler.</TE>
<TE>   Mubarak's friends and family have insisted his case is a classic
example of guilt by association. But FBI officials claimed the truth
is far more complicated.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, I went a number of years in grade school with a guy who
became part of the Manson clan. Does that make me a felon? No,"
Scafidi said. "But this guy [Mubarak] was encircled earlier in his
life with a real-life, fire-breathing, ill-meaning terrorist."</TE>
<TE>   Agent Michael Mason, who heads the FBI's Sacramento Office, said
"there were sufficient connections that necessitated his removal to
another country."</TE>
<TE>   Truth be told, Mason noted, were Mubarak not a foreign national,
U.S. authorities may not have been able to take any action against
him, regardless of their suspicions.</TE>
<TE>   "If he were a U.S. citizen, he might be walking around the
[Sacramento] area today," Mason said. "But ... inasmuch as his
residency in this country was an issue, that just became another
arrow in my quiver to neutralize the threat."</TE>
<TE>   The decision whether to seek deportation is rarely an easy one for
federal authorities.</TE>
<TE>   "That," said one FBI counterterrorism specialist, "is a question
we debate every day."</TE>
<TE>   One Justice Department official, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, said federal authorities since last September have often
detained acquaintances of terrorists if, for no other reason, than to
buy time for their investigations.</TE>
<TE>   Said the official: "The general assumption was that it was better
to do something than do nothing."</TE>
<TE>   From that starting point, the official added, it was not a great
leap to use deportations in cases where surveillance was too risky
and terrorism charges might not be provable.</TE>
<TE>   'Better There Than Here'</TE>
<TE>   "If we have some inkling someone might be a problem, do we really
want them running around on our streets?" the official said. "It
seems to me common sense that you'd say, 'Better there, than here, in
our own house.' "</TE>
<TE>   Often, according to federal authorities, the single greatest
factor in determining who should be deported is the staggering cost
of surveillance.</TE>
<TE>   Watching a single individual 24 hours a day and monitoring his
calls can easily cost $100,000 a month, said veteran FBI agents. The
costs range from roughly $55 an hour for agents to $150 an hour for
aircraft surveillance to as much as $900 an hour for electronic
surveillance equipment. And, agents said, those expenses do not
include the per diem costs of at least $150 a day for out-of-town
agents who are sometimes assigned for months if an office does not
have adequate personnel itself.</TE>
<TE>   Though he would not discuss the cost of such surveillance, Los
Angeles FBI Agent Matt McLaughlin said expenses are clearly a
consideration in determining what to do.</TE>
<TE>   "It's impossible to keep track of all these people through
surveillance," said McLaughlin, chief spokesman for the L.A. office.
"The resources needed to do that are too substantial."</TE>
<TE>   Determining how many agents will be assigned to a surveillance
depends on factors including the target's location and potential
awareness that he or she is being followed.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities must also assess the individual's potential danger to
the community and ability to elude them. "If someone is really
committed to not being under surveillance, it can make things really
difficult," said Bill Gore, who heads the FBI's office in San Diego.
"And if you really believe that this person is a threat ... the
question becomes whether you can really afford to lose him. If not,
maybe you just get rid of him" through deportation.</TE>
<TE>   In many cases, the deportation proceedings offer only hints of
connections to terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Acting on an unprecedented request by the INS, an Immigration
Court judge agreed to close all proceedings -- and issue a gag order
-- on the deportation case involving Zakaria Soubra, an outspoken
Islamic student from Lebanon.</TE>
<TE>   Soubra is one of eight people mentioned in a Phoenix FBI agent's
memo, written prior to the East Coast skyjackings, that raised
concerns about alleged Middle East extremists attending flight
schools in Arizona. He was taken into INS custody in Phoenix on May
23 for violating his immigration status. His violation? Soubra fell
below the minimum of 12 credits per semester required for a student
visa.</TE>
<TE>   Records and interviews show FBI agents were interested in Soubra's
attendance at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott,
Ariz., as well as his membership in Al Muhajiroun, a hard-line
anti-American group that some intelligence agents suspect is linked
to Osama bin Laden's terrorist network, Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have not alleged any links between Soubra and
September's hijackers. But investigators long ago established that
one of the 19 terrorists, Hani Hanjour, first came to Arizona in the
mid-1990s and trained at local flight schools.</TE>
<TE>   Affidavits presented by the FBI requested that Soubra's hearing be
closed. INS attorneys also argued for secrecy in the case, suggesting
that Soubra's case involved issues of national security.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Soubra was ordered deported for what normally would be
a routine immigration violation. His attorneys have railed against
federal authorities for publicly invoking the specter of terrorism
against their client without offering either evidence or a chance for
him to clear his name.</TE>
<TE>   "If these people are being accused of terrorism, absolutely get
them the hell out of the country," said Soubra's Phoenix attorney
Eric Bjotvedt. "But when they are not being charged with that, I
cannot understand how you can treat them like ... terrorists."</TE>
<TE>   The same arguments -- for and against deportation -- have been
advanced in the San Diego case of Mohdar Mohamed Abdullah.</TE>
<TE>   A former San Diego State University student, Abdullah, 24, has
been ordered deported back to Yemen after pleading guilty to lying on
immigration forms, claiming he was from Somalia.</TE>
<TE>   But that offense was overshadowed by the government's assertions
that Abdullah knew three of the Sept. 11 skyjackers and helped them
get driver's licenses, Social Security cards and information about
student visas to attend flight schools in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   In successfully blocking a lower bail for Abdullah in May, federal
authorities claimed he "regularly dined, worked and prayed with the
hijackers" who crashed into the Pentagon. And, authorities said, they
did not believe Abdullah when he denied knowledge of the attack
planned by his "friends" Hani Hanjour, Nawaf Alhazmi and Khalid
Al-Midhar.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah's attorneys rejected the assertions as groundless
attempts to make a routine immigration case appear a matter of
national security. "These are nothing more than inflammatory
statements by the government to demonize my client," said attorney
Randy Hamud, who represented Abdullah in the deportation proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps. But the case is just one of many that illustrates how
authorities will use deportation when proving terrorism charges might
not be possible.</TE>
<TE>   Said Agent Scafidi: "It isn't a fair process when you get right
down to it because a lot of people who get caught up in this might
have crossed paths with one of the top 10 dirty people in the world
20 years ago but have no terrorist leanings themselves. And who's to
say whether they would do anything in the future?</TE>
<TE>   Not Taking Chances</TE>
<TE>   "But we are not going to take a chance," Scafidi said. "If you are
here and obeying all of the laws, fine. But if you are here illegally
or out of status or your car is not registered, you are going to
cause a little more scrutiny ... and what we are doing is of
necessity.</TE>
<TE>   "We are being forced to use every legal and moral and ethical
avenue that we can," he said, "to ensure the safety of our citizens."</TE>

<HD>B. Manley, 81; Actress Taught at CalArts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beatrice Manley, an actress, teacher and author who helped launch San
Francisco's famed Actors Workshop, died Sept. 14 in Milwaukee. She
was 81.</LD>
<LD>   Manley was a founding member of the workshop, which was created by
directors Herbert Blau and Jules Irving in 1952 and helped to revive
regional theater in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Manley, who was married to Blau, appeared in the first West Coast
productions by Actors Workshop of plays by Samuel Beckett, Jean Genet
and Bertolt Brecht. She was the first American actress to perform the
title role in Brecht's "Mother Courage."</LD>
<TE>   Irving and the Blaus later moved to New York City and ran the
Lincoln Center Repertory Company. Manley performed there in
productions of Brecht's "The Caucasian Chalk Circle" and Georg
Buchner's "Danton's Death."</TE>
<TE>   She moved to Los Angeles in the early 1970s and spent much of that
decade teaching acting at the California Institute of the Arts, where
her students included Ed Harris and Paul Reubens.</TE>
<TE>   She continued to appear on the stage, including starring in
Beckett's "Rockaby/Footfalls," for which she received an L.A. Weekly
award. She also was awarded an honorary doctor of arts degree by
CalArts in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   She was the author of two books on acting: "My Breath in Art:
Acting from Within" and "The Actor's Dickens." She also wrote five
plays, two librettos and a screenplay.</TE>
<TE>   Manley was born in the Bronx, N.Y., and made her Broadway debut in
1941 in Maxwell Anderson's war play, "Eve of St. Mark."</TE>
<TE>   Her first marriage was to painter Albert Freedberg. She moved to
California in 1949 to take a fellowship as artist-in-residence at
Stanford University, where she met Blau, a theater student. She was
divorced from him in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   Manley is survived by three children, seven grandchildren and one
great-grandchild.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service will be held at 2 p.m. Saturday at the Bijou
Theater at CalArts, 24700 McBean Parkway, Valencia.</TE>

<HD>Medical Pot Use Given a Boost</HD>
<DH>Appeals panel says U.S. can't investigate doctors or void
their licenses for suggesting the drug to patients. California, six
other states are affected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Henry Weinstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The federal government may not revoke a doctor's license to dispense
medication, or investigate a physician, for recommending marijuana to
sick patients, a federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The 3-0 decision by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals is the
latest in a series of rulings bolstering efforts in California to
normalize the use of marijuana for medical treatment.</LD>
<LD>   Three months ago, the California Supreme Court ruled unanimously
that state residents who have a doctor's approval to use marijuana
for a medical purpose are protected from prosecution in state court
for using or growing limited quantities of it.</LD>
<TE>   The number of Californians using marijuana for medication is
unknown. A few cities and counties, however, have established
official registries of medical marijuana users, and in those
jurisdictions alone, 30,000 patients have signed up, said Steph
Scheer, a spokesman for Americans for Safe Access, an Oakland-based
group that supports the use of medical marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's ruling affects medical marijuana laws in California and
six other states -- Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon and
Washington -- that are within the 9th Circuit's jurisdiction. Two
other states outside the circuit's jurisdiction, Colorado and Maine,
also have laws permitting marijuana use for medical purposes.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling upheld a 1999 decision by U.S. District Judge William
D. Alsup in San Francisco that barred federal prosecutors from taking
action against doctors who tell patients, including many with AIDS
and cancer, that marijuana might be medically beneficial.</TE>
<TE>   The appellate ruling was described by an American Civil Liberties
Union lawyer as a landmark for the free speech rights of doctors. It
was also hailed by public health groups -- as well as the California
Medical Assn., which filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of
the physicians who brought the suit.</TE>
<TE>   For the federal government, having the power to deter doctors from
recommending marijuana to patients was "the silver bullet," said
Graham Boyd, an ACLU attorney who argued for the plaintiffs. "A
patient is only allowed to possess, use or grow marijuana if a doctor
first recommends it. If the government can silence physicians who
would recommend medical marijuana, then there is no more legal
medical marijuana."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Warren, spokesman for the state medical association, said:
"This is a great day for California doctors and California patients.
It ends a gag rule where the federal government tried to chill the
sacred private communications between a physician and his or her
patients."</TE>
<TE>   Valerie Corral, one of the plaintiffs in the case who uses
marijuana to alleviate symptoms of epilepsy, said the ruling
"legitimizes marijuana by bringing it into a medical perspective."</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department spokesman Susan Dryden would only say the
decision was under review. It could be appealed to a larger panel of
9th Circuit judges or to the U.S. Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling evolved from passage of Proposition 215, the 1996
California initiative that permits patients to lawfully use marijuana
if they have a doctor's recommendation. Under California law,
possession of small quantities of marijuana for nonmedical purposes
is a misdemeanor with a maximum $100 fine.</TE>
<TE>   The Clinton administration immediately acted to suppress
California's medicinal pot law, threatening to punish doctors who
recommended marijuana -- by taking away their licenses to dispense
drugs or potentially even jailing the physicians. The Bush
administration has taken the same position.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department lawyers say pot serves no valid medical purpose
and that if the California ballot measure were allowed to remain in
effect, it would subvert the government's ongoing war against drugs.</TE>
<TE>   In its ruling, the 9th Circuit rejected that argument. "The
government has not provided any empirical evidence to demonstrate
that [the lower court injunction] interferes with or threatens to
interfere with any legitimate law enforcement activities," wrote Mary
M. Schroeder, the circuit's chief judge.</TE>
<TE>   The government's policy strikes "at core 1st Amendment interests
of doctors and patients," added Schroeder, appointed by President
Carter. "An integral component of the practice of medicine is the
communication between doctor and a patient. Physicians must be able
to speak frankly and openly."</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder drew a clear distinction between a doctor legally
recommending the use of marijuana and the illegal activity of
procuring marijuana for a patient. Simply recommending marijuana
"does not translate into aiding and abetting, or conspiracy,"
Schroeder wrote. Government attorneys had contended that doctors were
committing such crimes when recommending marijuana to patients.
Judges Betty B. Fletcher, also a Carter appointee, and Alex Kozinski,
a Reagan appointee, joined in the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   In a lengthy concurring opinion, Kozinski said doctors who spoke
candidly to patients about the potential benefits of medical
marijuana "may destroy their careers and lose their livelihoods" if
the government policy is implemented.</TE>
<TE>   Kozinski cited declarations doctors lodged when the suit
challenging the government policy was filed in 1997. The doctors
described how the policy had chilled their normal consultations with
patients.</TE>
<TE>   "As a result of the government's public threats, I do not feel
comfortable even discussing the subject of medical marijuana with my
patients," Dr. Milton N. Estes of San Francisco said in his
declaration. "I feel vulnerable to federal sanctions that could strip
me of my license to prescribe the treatments my patients depend upon,
or even land me behind bars."</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, plaintiffs including the Bay Area Physicians for Human
Rights filed a federal suit challenging the Clinton administration's
policy. A U.S. district judge issued a preliminary injunction barring
action against doctors, and Judge Alsup issued a permanent injunction
in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Before the preliminary injunction was issued, federal Drug
Enforcement Administration agents interrogated one doctor in Northern
California and took records from his office after they learned that
he had talked to a patient about using marijuana for medical
purposes. The doctor said in a court declaration that he was scared,
but no action was taken against him.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, one of the plaintiffs, Dr. Marcus Conant of San
Francisco, who has been treating AIDS patients since 1981, said he
was delighted with the ruling. "This has never been about legalizing
marijuana. It is about the 1st Amendment right of a physician to
speak candidly to his or her patient and answer questions patients
may have," Conant said.</TE>
<TE>   In his opinion, Kozinski cited 1999 data from the White House
Office of National Drug Control, which said there was scientific
evidence indicating the potential therapeutic value of
marijuana-based drugs for pain relief, control of nausea and vomiting
and appetite stimulation. However, he cautioned that "the evidence
supporting the medical use of marijuana does not prove that it is, in
fact, beneficial. There is also much evidence to the contrary, and
the federal defendants may well be right that marijuana provides no
additional benefit over approved prescription drugs, while carrying a
wide variety of serious risks."</TE>
<TE>   But Kozinski stressed that there is a genuine difference of expert
opinion on the issue, as well as significant scientific and anecdotal
evidence supporting both viewpoints.</TE>
<TE>   "For the great majority of us who do not suffer from debilitating
pain, or who have not watched a loved one waste away as a result of
AIDS-induced anorexia ... it doesn't much matter who has the better
of this debate. But for patients suffering from [multiple sclerosis],
cancer, AIDS or one of the afflictions listed in the [National
Academy of Sciences study on marijuana and medicine], and their loved
ones, obtaining candid and reliable information about a possible
avenue of relief is of vital importance," Kozinski wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "In this case," he emphasized, "it is perfectly clear that the
harm to patients from being denied the right to receive candid
medical advice is far greater than the harm to doctors from being
unable to deliver such advice."</TE>
<TE>   One such patient, the judge said, is plaintiff Keith Vines, an
assistant district attorney in San Francisco, whose bout with AIDS
had caused him to lose more than 40 pounds. The decorated Air Force
officer was "only able to recover by using cannabis to stimulate his
appetite."</TE>
<TE>   Kozinski said that if the federal policy were enforced, the likely
consequence is that "many patients desperate for relief from
debilitating pain or nausea would self-medicate, and wind up
administering the wrong dose or frequency, or use the drug where a
physician would advise against it."</TE>
<TE>   If the government policy went into effect, it also would have the
negative impact of deliberately undermining California's effort to
define the line between legal and illegal marijuana use, Kozinski
said. Normally state law bows to federal law, but this situation
falls within a long-established exception, the judge said.</TE>
<TE>   Another case, stemming from related federal efforts to curb
medical marijuana use, is pending before the 9th Circuit. In that
case, the Oakland Cannabis Buyers Club contends that states are
entitled to experiment with their own drug laws and that U.S.
citizens are entitled to use marijuana to alleviate pain.</TE>

<LD>A sea of red converged Tuesday on Edison International Field for the
last time in a remarkable season.</LD>
<LD>   As noise-stick-pounding fans yelled themselves hoarse and laughed
until their faces hurt, as children skipped school and business
owners hung out signs reading: "We're off to the parade," an
estimated 100,000 fans exorcised 42 years of futility in a day of
celebration.</LD>
<LD>   A whole county celebrated with them.</LD>
<TE>   "Out of the shadows, out of the shadows, out of the shadows of
L.A.," chanted one group of fans as the victory parade went by.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in the nation -- perhaps even in San Francisco -- some
people may still refer to Orange County using the words of Giant
Manager Dusty Baker: "Southern L.A."</TE>
<TE>   But local Angel fans --some of whom began waiting at 6 a.m. for a
pair of parades and the rally outside Edison Field -- were having
none of it.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, "everyone thinks about the Dodgers and the
Lakers, and we have always been near the bottom," said Cindy Stier,
46, of Orange. "There is a lot of pride here. L.A. always gets all
the glory. This will get us on the map."</TE>
<TE>   Many had been waiting half a lifetime or more for that moment.
Against the mass of red, Paul Klein of Anaheim stood out in a black
hat -- a California Angels hat, vintage 1969. He got it with his dad
and has worn it ever since, year in and year out, for 27 of his 41
years -- season after season of humiliating defeat. And now,
redemption.</TE>
<TE>   "When ... your team is one strike away from being in the World
Series, and they lose, you just lie there on the sofa and cry and
cry," he said, referring to a defeat in 1986 that for many had
defined the team's image until this month.</TE>
<TE>   "This year is healing me," he shouted above the ear-splitting,
joyous roar of the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   When Angel first baseman Scott Spiezio worked the crowd into a
full-throated frenzy, Klein hollered his lungs out, then took off his
sunglasses, wiped his eyes and tugged quietly on his cousin's jersey.</TE>
<TE>   "Dude," Klein said quietly, "this is unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   Some in the crowd were too young to know the suffering of decades
of falling short.</TE>
<TE>   There were the two children, 8 and 7, of Cathie Curtis of Anaheim
Hills. She hadn't planned to take them to the rally, but at 6:20 a.m.
they woke her, begging to go. After a brief hesitation, she agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen my kids get ready so fast. Never," the
35-year-old mother said. "We didn't want them to miss school. I try
to be a good mom. Missing one day of school in exchange to be part of
history, that's a totally fair trade. But they do have to pick up
homework afterward. That was the deal."</TE>
<TE>   She was one of many fans who freely admitted to skipping work --
and pulling their kids out of school -- to be part of it all.</TE>
<TE>   "I called in and said my kids woke up completely red today," joked
Nancy Aiello, 40, of Newport Beach as she and her three daughters ate
pepperoni pizza and cotton candy for breakfast in the ballpark
parking lot. "This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience."</TE>
<TE>   For those who were absent from their studies, Spiezio offered some
impromptu education: "I hear there's a lot of kids skipping school
today," he yelled to fans. "I want to give you guys a spelling
lesson. Can you spell R-E-P-E-A-T?"</TE>
<TE>   "Repeat! Repeat!" the crowd chanted in response.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime observers of Orange County life say they have never seen
anything quite like Tuesday's celebration.</TE>
<TE>   "It always seemed to me that Orange County was a place where
people got excited about a Nordstrom's sale and not much else," said
Mark Baldassare, a public-policy analyst and pollster who has studied
the county for two decades.</TE>
<TE>   "Now people have something to be enthusiastic about.... This has
brought to life a dormant sense of pride and place I had never seen
before," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Festivities began at Disneyland, fitting for a team owned by
Disney that enjoyed a season that played out like a fairy tale. The
theme park staged a short parade at 10 a.m. from It's A Small World,
past the Matterhorn and down Main Street.</TE>
<TE>   Mickey Mouse dressed for the occasion in a red pinstriped baseball
uniform and a red cap, taking his place on a float alongside Troy
Glaus, Tim Salmon and David Eckstein.</TE>
<TE>   "When you wish upon a halo, your dreams will come true," read a
sign held up by Ronda Zidack, 44, of Diamond Bar.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, fans who had begun gathering near the Arrowhead Pond
before dawn prepared for a second half-mile parade down Katella
Avenue that was to end with the rally at Edison Field. Red-and-white
confetti rained down on the players along the route.</TE>
<TE>   "We are the champions" blared over loudspeakers along with just
about every song imaginable containing the words "angels" or
"monkey"--references to the rally monkey that became the team's
unofficial mascot in its frequent come-from-behind victories.</TE>
<TE>   Red fire engines draped with banners touting the "2002 World
Champions" carried the players, coaches, their families and Manager
Mike Scioscia.</TE>
<TE>   From a freeway overpass, police looked down, snapping pictures.
Pennant-waving fans cheered from the sidewalks, some standing on
their tiptoes to glimpse the triumphant team.</TE>
<TE>   "I am so excited. I love them to death," said Anaheim resident
Annie Munoz, 60, who bounced uncontrollably and tripped giddily over
her words. "There's Spiezio. There's Molina. There's all of them! I
could never get this close to them, but here I am."</TE>
<TE>   As the parade reached the field, cloudy skies cleared to a cool
California blue.</TE>
<TE>   And as players began stepping onto the main stage, the crowd
erupted in ear-splitting whistles, hoarse cheers and other
high-decibel adulation.</TE>
<TE>   The players gave it back in a mutual love-fest of upraised fists
and beaming smiles.</TE>
<TE>   "I know you guys have been waiting a long time for this," Salmon
said. "This is yours. We couldn't have done it without you."</TE>
<TE>   Each player took his turn at the microphone, including pitching
phenom Francisco Rodriguez, 20. "I send warm regards and hugs to
Venezuela," he said in Spanish. "I dedicate the seven games of this
World Series to the Republic of Venezuela."</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly also took the stage, shouting, "Mike
Scioscia for governor. Mike Scioscia for governor." The popular
manager laughed and waved Daly to stop.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got news for the mayor of San Francisco," Daly declared,
holding up a wide-brimmed hat to the roaring crowd. "He's going to
look real cute wearing this Gene Autry cowboy hat." In a pre-Series
wager, Daly had bet the Stetson against one of Willie Brown's
trademark fedoras.</TE>
<TE>   The excitement even prompted some to wonder if the team's fortunes
have changed for good.</TE>
<TE>   "If lightning can strike once, it can strike twice in the same
place," said Danny Lara, 50, of Orange.</TE>
<TE>   The longest-enduring fans could not help recalling the cursed game
in 1986 that robbed their heroes of a title.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very angry with myself," said Andy Garcia of Fountain Valley,
who admitted he had abandoned hope after that game and returned to
the Angels only three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "A true fan should not go away from his home team. This year, I
said, 'Make me a believer,' and they did that. I'm back.</TE>
<TE>   "My loyalties are back at home, where they should be."</TE>

<LD>Milos Vojnovic, 50, a leader of ethnic Serbs in Croatia, died Friday
at his home in Vukovar, Croatia, of an apparent heart attack.</LD>
<LD>   Vojnovic, a Serb, had worked as a judge in the Serb para-state
that rebels proclaimed in the Vukovar area and other Croatian
territories seized in the 1991 war. The fighting erupted when Serbs
rebelled against the area's declaration of independence from the
former Serb-dominated Yugoslavia.</LD>
<LD>   Croatia, which reestablished its rule in the area in 1995,
indicted Vojnovic for participating in the armed rebellion but
dropped the charges a year later under an amnesty law.</LD>
<TE>   Since 1995, Vojnovic had worked to restore ties between local
Serbs and Croats.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, he submitted an application for an appointment as
judge in Vukovar's district court.</TE>
<TE>   Many Croats still view those who sided with rebels as enemies, and
war veterans vigorously opposed Vojnovic's appointment.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Fred Paulsell, 63, a venture capitalist who provided crucial
financing and advice in the start-up of Costco Wholesale Corp., died
in his sleep Oct. 22 at his home in Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Spokane, Wash., Paulsell moved to Seattle as a child,
served in the Army, and earned bachelor's and master's degrees in
finance at the University of Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   He began working for Smith Barney, which transferred him to
Seattle to open a new office at age 30.</LD>
<TE>   In 1972, he became executive vice president of Foster &amp; Marshall,
a local brokerage. That business was sold to Shearson/American
Express in 1982, and Paulsell became a co-founder of the venture
capital firm Foster Paulsell &amp; Baker in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   In 1982, he met Costco founder and Chairman Jeff Brotman on a
flight to Seattle that was struck by lightning and made an emergency
landing in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   While the plane was grounded for four hours, Brotman talked about
opening a chain of low-cost warehouse clubs and Paulsell offered to
help raise the money.</TE>
<TE>   Within months, a limited partnership called the Cost Club had
raised $7.5 million and the first store was opened in south Seattle
in September 1983.</TE>

<LD>Alina Pienkowska, 50, a founding member of Poland's Solidarity labor
union and a key player in the 1980 Gdansk shipyard strike that
launched its struggle against communism, died of cancer Oct. 17 at a
hospital in Gdansk.</LD>
<LD>   In the 1970s, Pienkowska joined the Free Trade Unions, a
clandestine anti-communist labor organization in Gdansk, where she
met the future Solidarity founder, Lech Walesa, and Bogdan
Borusewicz, whom she married in 1983.</LD>
<LD>   She was working as a shipyard clinic nurse on Aug. 14, 1980, when
Gdansk workers laid down their tools.</LD>
<TE>   With telephone lines to the rest of the yard cut off by
authorities, she called a fellow dissident, who spread the news
across Poland, thus launching strikes in hundreds of factories.</TE>
<TE>   Pienkowska was among a handful of activists who persuaded the
strikers to continue their protest two days later, despite promises
of improved working conditions.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 31, communist authorities signed an agreement with the
strikers, legalizing Solidarity and promising to ease political
restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   Pienkowska, who was one of the authors of the agreement, remained
an underground Solidarity activist after the government's martial law
crackdown a year later.</TE>
<TE>   She was one of Solidarity's regional leaders in Gdansk for a
decade.</TE>

<LD>Thomas B. Ross, 73, a journalist and author of books on military
intelligence who served as the Pentagon spokesman during the Jimmy
Carter administration, died of pancreatic cancer Thursday in a Long
Island hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Ross was the Washington bureau chief for the Chicago Sun-Times

"The Espionage Establishment," a 1967 book that examined the
international intelligence community.</LD>
<TE>   After nearly two decades with the Chicago Sun-Times, Ross left in
1977 to become the assistant secretary of defense for public affairs.
He became communications director for the Celanese Corp. in New York
City in 1981. He later became a senior vice president of RCA, NBC and
the Hill &amp; Knowlton public relations firm.</TE>
<TE>   He was a president of government relations for Loral Space and
Communications at the time of his death.</TE>
<TE>   The New York City-born Ross graduated from Yale University and

case could cause "grave damage to the national security."</LD>
<LD>   Justice Department attorney Douglas Letter told members of the
U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals that although secret evidence is
normally "something to be avoided," federal law allows it in
exceptional cases.</LD>
<LD>   Roger Simmons, an attorney for the Global Relief Foundation, said
the use of such evidence is unconstitutional.</LD>
<TE>   Global Relief is appealing a federal judge's June ruling that
upheld as constitutional the government's freezing of its bank
accounts. Prosecutors say the group funneled money to terrorists.
Simmons argued that Global Relief has not been charged with any
crime, and that its leaders never have been accused of violence or of
being members of Al Qaeda.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The state's landmark lawsuit against lead-paint manufacturers ended
in a mistrial after the jury said it was hopelessly deadlocked in the
potentially multimillion-dollar case. The state was trying to hold
eight former paint makers liable for lead poisoning in 35,000 Rhode
Island children since 1993.</LD>
<LD>   Atty. Gen. Sheldon Whitehouse said Rhode Island is prepared to try
the case again "within weeks." Rhode Island is the first state to sue
the industry under public nuisance law.</LD>
<LD>   Lead paint was banned in 1978 after studies showed that flaking
paint or dust can harm children who eat or breathe it. Lead poisoning
can cause behavioral disorders and even death.</LD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush signed legislation Tuesday that Congress approved
overwhelmingly to correct the sort of voter registration mix-ups and
confusing ballots that threw his own election into bitter dispute two
years ago.</LD>
<LD>   The "Help America Vote Act of 2002" will give states $3.9 billion
to replace -- in time for the 2004 presidential election that will
likely include Bush's bid for a second term -- outdated punch-card
and lever voting machines, and to improve voter education and the
training of workers assigned to polling places.</LD>
<LD>   Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic National Committee,
said Bush was merely "posing for a White House photo-op."</LD>
<TE>   The bill will not affect Tuesday's election.</TE>
<TE>   The new law also requires statewide voter databases that are
designed to make it easier to register and to detect fraud.</TE>
<TE>   "Every registered voter deserves to have confidence that the
system is fair and elections are honest, that every vote is recorded,
and that the rules are consistently applied," Bush said.</TE>

<HD>Flight 587 Crash Hearing Focuses on Rudder Controls</HD>
<DH>The design and pilot reaction are among the issues weighed
by the federal safety board.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Malnic and Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Seconds before American Airlines Flight 587 crashed in a New York
neighborhood last November, the frantic pilots realized they had
suddenly and without apparent warning lost all control, a transcript
released Tuesday shows.</LD>
<LD>   "What the hell are we into?" exclaimed 1st Officer Sten Molin, 34,
who was piloting the jetliner. "We're stuck in it!" The routine
takeoff became a nightmare as they encountered forces they could not
overpower.</LD>
<LD>   "Get out of it, get out of it!" responded Capt. Edward States, 42.
The urgent plea came too late. The tail had ripped off, making the
Airbus A300 impossible to fly.</LD>
<TE>   The two pilots in the cockpit were in all likelihood unaware that
they were now part of a previously unheard of scenario: the complete
separation of a transport aircraft's vertical tail fin during normal
flight.</TE>
<TE>   It took fewer than eight seconds from the time of Flight 587's
second encounter with the wake of a larger plane ahead for the tail
to break, according to new data released by the National
Transportation Safety Board in the first of four days of hearings.</TE>
<TE>   In the brief interval before the tail broke, the plane's rudder
moved sharply back and forth, stressing the vertical fin beyond its
design limits. Normally, pilots make very little use of the rudder in
flight.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's hearings focused attention for the first time on the
design of the rudder controls and whether their sensitivity played a
role in the accident. Moreover, newly released materials showed that
four years ago, Airbus had raised concerns with the NTSB that large
rudder movements by pilots could over-stress a tail fin. It is
unclear whether the information prompted any action.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators say they have reached no conclusions about what
caused the crash, which killed all 260 aboard and five people on the
ground in the Rockaway neighborhood of Queens. It ranks as the second
worst commercial aviation disaster in U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the design of the rudder controls, the probe is
focusing on several elements: a possible overreaction by Molin using
the rudder, the adequacy of safety standards for the tail fin and
rudder and the training given to pilots.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier concerns about the composite material used in place of
metal to build the tail fin have been eased, since investigators have
been unable to discover any preexisting flaws. But NTSB officials say
they are considering recommending more sophisticated inspections of
composite components.</TE>
<TE>   "The accident raises questions about the design of the [rudder]
system and the training of the pilots who use it," Greg Feith, an air
safety consultant and former senior investigator for the NTSB, said
in an interview. "I don't think that training is as thorough as it
should be."</TE>
<TE>   The rudder, a movable panel on the tail fin, is mainly used to
keep an airplane flying straight when landing or taking off in a
crosswind, or when an engine fails. To move it, pilots use a system
of pedals.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators have said they are specifically interested in a
design feature of the A300 rudder controls that requires less pedal
force to apply full rudder under certain conditions.</TE>
<TE>   At 250 knots, close to the speed at which Flight 587 was flying, a
force of 32 pounds is required to move the rudder to its full limit.
At lower speeds, below 165 knots, the pilot must apply a
significantly stronger force of 65 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   "This system, as designed, leads a pilot to believe the rudder
reaction is proportional to the pedal input, which, in fact, it is
not," Feith said.</TE>
<TE>   Airbus defends its design, noting that about 75% of transport
aircraft rely on a similar philosophy. ''The rudder system has 15
million flight hours with no concerns expressed prior to this
accident about feel and design,'' said Clay McConnell, a spokesman
for the company.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1998 letter from Airbus to the NTSB, which concerned an
incident involving another American Airlines A300, the company warned
that pilots should not rely on the rudder to recover from in-flight
upsets. "Large or abrupt rudder usage ... can lead to rapid loss of
controlled flight," Airbus said.</TE>
<TE>   Side-to-side rudder movements "can lead to structural loads that
exceed the design strength of the fin," it added. The 1997 incident
that prompted the letter did not cause a crash. The NTSB did not warn
pilots of the potential danger until February.</TE>
<TE>   "The use of the rudder for boosting control is neither correct nor
appropriate," testified Dominique Chatrenet, an Airbus vice president
who oversees flight controls. Capt. Larry Rockliff, an Airbus vice
president for training, testified that in the mid-1990s, he was
concerned that American pilots had been trained to rely too much on
the rudder when recovering from in-flight upsets. American later
changed its training to de-emphasize the rudder.</TE>
<TE>   Airbus is at odds with American and with pilots' groups over the
cause of the accident. The airline and pilots say Molin should not be
blamed, since pilots until now have been trained that they can safely
make full use of all controls at normal flying speeds.</TE>
<TE>   But the investigation has also turned up an incident five years
ago in which Molin was criticized by a senior pilot for overusing the
rudder to stabilize a Boeing 727. No one was hurt and the captain did
not file a report.</TE>
<TE>   An NTSB video reconstruction showed that Molin and States had
little time to analyze what they were up against during the two
minutes and 24 seconds that Flight 587 was aloft. The plane took off
without incident on a clear Monday morning bound for Santo Domingo in
the Caribbean.</TE>
<TE>   A few seconds later, Flight 587 crossed the first wake of a larger
Boeing 747 about five miles ahead. Airplanes leave two wakes, which
curl off the end of each wing like horizontal tornados. "Little wake
turbulence, huh?" States said to Molin, who was at the controls.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," Molin responded. The plane was making a left turn,
following a standard departure route. But the encounter with the
second wake was anything but routine.</TE>
<TE>   The sharp rudder motions began almost immediately. Although
investigators said Tuesday they have still not determined that Molin
initiated the maneuvers, no mechanical problem has been found that
would have caused them.</TE>
<TE>   The cockpit voice recorders picked up the sound of several thumps
and mechanical noises. In a strained voice, Molin called for "max
power." He recognized there was a problem and he was trying to regain
full control.</TE>
<TE>   "You all right?" asked States.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I'm fine," Molin responded.</TE>
<TE>   "Hang on to it," said States. "Hang on to it."</TE>
<TE>   The cockpit recorder picked up the sound of another thump. Then
came a loud bang, which investigators believe was the sound of the
tail ripping off. That was followed by grunting sounds from Molin.
Then came a roaring noise, rising in volume.</TE>
<TE>   About 14 seconds later, the tape cut off. It was then,
investigators believe, that the plane slammed into the ground.</TE>

<HD>Effort Begins to Simplify Hunt for Disease Genes in Humans</HD>
<DH>A $100-million mapping project could provide an 'elegant
shortcut' to troublesome DNA.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Looking for a quicker way to identify genes that cause disease,
researchers are beginning a $100-million effort to identify blocks of
DNA that contain common variations in the human genetic structure,
officials announced Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The project, expected to take three years, involves nine research
groups in five countries and will analyze genetic patterns in blood
samples taken from people in Nigeria, Japan and China and from people
of northern and western European ancestry in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   The goal is to find how the 3 billion bits of DNA in the human
genome, or genetic structure, are organized into sequence variations,
or haplotype blocks, that are shared by many people.</LD>
<TE>   Once these haplotypes are mapped, it will form "a powerful and
elegant shortcut" to identifying inherited gene sequences linked to
such disorders as diabetes, heart disease and cancer, said Dr.
Francis Collins, head of the National Human Genome Research
Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health.</TE>
<TE>   "This work will have a profound impact on the future of medicine,"
Collins said at a news conference announcing the project. He called
the effort the International HapMap Project.</TE>
<TE>   Both public and private labs are participating, with many of the
same researchers who helped complete the sequencing in 2001 of the
human genome.</TE>
<TE>   The human genome comprises about 3 billion pairs of DNA. Each pair
is made up of chemicals commonly identified with the letters A, T, C
or G. Virtually all the letters are in the same sequence in everyone,
but there are an estimated 10 million "spelling" differences,
involving a single change where one DNA letter is replaced by
another. These are called single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs,
and some are thought to be related to disease.</TE>
<TE>   Recent studies have shown that SNPs are organized into DNA
neighborhoods called haplotype blocks comprising about 10,000 or more
base pairs.</TE>
<TE>   Many people share the same haplotype blocks, and common variations
are found in virtually all populations. Thus, it is possible to
identify a haplotype block by finding a single SNP, instead of having
to check all 10,000 base pairs. In effect, the HapMap project is an
effort to find DNA landmarks that identify specific DNA sequences
shared by many people. Later research would then look within those
sequences to find the genes that cause disease.</TE>
<TE>   As an illustration of how the HapMap would help find disease
genes, Collins related it to leaky gas pipes. Suppose, he said, a
safety officer knows there are 12 leaking gas pipes somewhere in a
city and must quickly find them. It could take years to
systematically search the city house by house, said Collins. It would
be much quicker for the safety officer first to identify blocks
within the city where there are known gas leaks, then limit his
house-to-house search to those blocks.</TE>
<TE>   By breaking up the human genome into blocks with known genetic
variations, researchers can go directly to those blocks and search
for disease genes instead of having to search through all 3 billion
DNA base pairs, he said.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, if researchers could find a specific haplotype block
linked to diabetes, they could focus their search for a diabetes gene
on that block instead of having to survey the entire human genome.</TE>

<HD>200 Haitians Held After Fleeing Ship</HD>
<DH>Immigrants leaped into Biscayne Bay and swam to busy Miami
causeway after craft ran aground. Three Cubans also reportedly are
detained.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John-Thor Dahlburg</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>An estimated 200 illegal immigrants from Haiti, and reportedly three
Cubans, leaped into the water and swam and waded en masse onto a busy
Miami causeway Tuesday after the wooden freighter on which they had
ridden to America ran aground offshore, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   "Once we arrived on the scene, they started jumping overboard,"
said Coast Guard Petty Officer Ryan Doss aboard the cutter Maui. "As
soon as that happened, we changed from law-enforcement mode to
search-and-rescue mode and started pulling people from the water."</LD>
<LD>   It was believed to be the largest number of illegal Haitian
arrivals in Florida in nearly three years. After their 50-foot
coastal freighter grounded about 200 yards offshore, passengers
leaped into the waters of Biscayne Bay and swarmed onto Rickenbacker
Causeway, the busy six-lane highway linking Miami with the ritzy
seaside community of Key Biscayne.</LD>
<TE>   The Haitian craft also picked up three Cubans on a raft along the
way to Florida, said North Miami Mayor Joe Celestin, a Haitian
American who went to the scene and spoke with some of the migrants.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very sad to see the way human beings who are fleeing their
country for a better way of life are treated," Celestin said. "The
Cubans that were on the same boat will be released. The Haitians will
probably be deported. It's a double standard."</TE>
<TE>   TV news cameras in helicopters showed the Haitians trying to flag
down cars and pleading with drivers to stop, while others clambered
onto the back of a pickup truck.</TE>
<TE>   "They never actually made land," said Det. Joey Giordano of the
Miami-Dade Police Department. "They couldn't get off the bridge on
either side, and we shut it down immediately. The causeway was closed
on both sides, and they [police] are making a car-by-car search to
see if there are any Haitians inside."</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of Haitians were detained along the causeway by Miami
police officers and made to sit on the roadside. Their hands were
fastened together with plastic handcuffs.</TE>
<TE>   Aboard the wooden boat, Haitians handed children to people already
in the water. Coast Guard personnel, who arrived about 3:30 p.m. EST,
pulled struggling men and women aboard their vessels and threw life
preservers to others floundering in water 4 to 5 feet deep.</TE>
<TE>   As dusk fell, 11 Coast Guard vessels, a helicopter and a
fixed-wing aircraft were searching the waters south of the causeway
for any remaining people, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Anastasia
Burns. She added that at least 20 of the freighter's passengers
already had been rescued.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know how many people were on board initially," Burns
said. "It was close to 200, but we don't have an exact count. There
still may be people in the water.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as they hit land, that's when they were able to start
jumping off. Unfortunately, they were still about 200 yards out, so
they had to wade."</TE>
<TE>   Coast Guard officials said the rescued and detained Haitians would
be turned over to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service,
which would determine whether they would be repatriated or allowed to
stay in the U.S. The Border Patrol said it had dispatched agents to
the scene to interview the arrivals once they had been determined to
be safe and uninjured.</TE>
<TE>   The televised drama of the Haitians' desperate bid to reach the
United States seemed certain to revive debate about their treatment
under current federal law. Unlike Cuban rafters who make it to
Florida's shores and are allowed entry, Haitians customarily are
detained and then fail in their bid to win asylum status. They then
are sent back to their homeland, the poorest nation in the Western
Hemisphere.</TE>
<TE>   Phillip Brutus, a Haitian American who is a Democratic member of
the Florida House of Representatives, called such differing treatment
"ugly," and he appealed for lawyers to take up the cause of the
Haitians who landed Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Some human-rights advocates have accused the Bush administration
of racism, since the Haitians -- unlike the Cubans -- invariably are
black. In March, immigration attorneys filed suit against the
government's policy on that basis.</TE>
<TE>   Also unlike Haitian Americans, others note, Cuban Americans are a
politically strong, well-to-do and long-established community in
South Florida.</TE>
<TE>   In December, a ship carrying 187 Haitian migrants ran aground off
Elliott Key, south of Miami. Most of those passengers still are being
held by the INS.</TE>
<TE>   According to Burns, the Coast Guard last year rescued 1,400
Haitians, mainly in waters around Florida.</TE>

<HD>Is a Law Unjust? One State May Allow Juries to Decide</HD>
<DH>South Dakota measure backs 'nullification' -- and would
unravel the legal system, some fear.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephanie Simon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>VERMILLION, S.D.</DL>
<LD>Bob Newland calls them his "horror stories," and they are coming in
by the dozen -- unconfirmed, one-sided, passionate.</LD>
<LD>   A quadriplegic writes of his conviction on drug charges for
smoking a marijuana cigarette -- the only relief, he says, for his
violent tremors. A teenager writes of her conviction on assault
charges for standing up to local bullies. A mother writes of her
son's two-year prison sentence for violating a restraining order by
putting a rose and a teddy bear in his former girlfriend's car.</LD>
<LD>   To Newland, a Libertarian activist, such stories prove that
America has become a police state -- prosecuting without reason,
punishing without mercy.</LD>
<TE>   His radical proposal to restore balance: Let juries determine not
just guilt or innocence, but whether the laws of the land are fair,
and whether those laws should apply to any given defendant on any
given day.</TE>
<TE>   South Dakotans will vote Tuesday on a measure that would enshrine
those reforms in the state Constitution. The initiative could upend
the state's legal system -- and stir similar revolts around the
nation.</TE>
<TE>   Newland, a long-shot candidate for attorney general, is the prime
force behind the measure. But the concept, broadly known as "jury
nullification," has attracted an eclectic bunch of backers -- among
them, folks infuriated by tough drug laws, gun laws, tax laws,
motorcycle helmet laws, even traffic laws.</TE>
<TE>   "The laws have to be applied in context. That's the issue. That's
the principle that lawyers have forgotten about," said Jorge Vicuna,
52, a farm manager in Huron who believes he was wrongly convicted
under animal abuse statutes for trying to fend off a chained dog with
a hockey stick.</TE>
<TE>   The text of Amendment A sounds mild enough. If it passes,
defendants in criminal cases would have the right "to argue the
merits, validity and applicability of the law, including the
sentencing laws."</TE>
<TE>   In practice, that means a drunk driver would be allowed to tell a
jury: Yes, I drove while intoxicated. But state law setting a 0.08%
blood-alcohol content limit is unfair. The federal government forced
that standard down our lawmakers' throats. And in any case, it
shouldn't apply to me, because though I was legally drunk, I drove
safely.</TE>
<TE>   Antiabortion activists could argue that the laws against
threatening clinics are invalid because it's everybody's moral duty
to prevent abortions. Pot smokers could press for acquittal on the
grounds that sentences for drug possession are too harsh. A batterer
could claim that domestic violence laws should not apply because the
spouse was asking for trouble.</TE>
<TE>   In short, it would allow a defendant to argue that, although he
broke the law, he does not deserve to be prosecuted. "You should be
allowed to tell a jury: 'Yes, I committed these actions, but ... this
is a stupid law,' " Newland said.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents -- including virtually all the state's legal
establishment -- contend that Amendment A will make a mockery of due
process, equal protection and democracy itself.</TE>
<TE>   It's dangerous, they argue, to allow 12 randomly selected citizens
to nullify laws that elected officials have enacted. They warn of
courtrooms turning into "popularity contests," where sympathetic
defendants get off because they convince jurors that the rules should
not apply to them.</TE>
<TE>   They point out too that because prosecutors cannot appeal
acquittals, there is no mechanism for reviewing or overturning
verdicts based on sentiment rather than law.</TE>
<TE>   "It will become a lawless society," said Mike Moore, a prosecutor
in Huron.</TE>
<TE>   "Anytime a law is not going to be applied across the board, that's
frightening," said Jeff Larson, a public defender in Sioux Falls.</TE>
<TE>   The California Supreme Court made just such an argument last year
in rejecting the principle of jury nullification. The court
unanimously held that a juror who said he could not convict as a
matter of conscience -- he disagreed with the statutory rape law at
issue in the case -- should be removed from the panel. The U.S.
Supreme Court also has discouraged nullification, as have judges in
state courts nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   In South Dakota, it's hard to gauge voter support for Amendment A,
as there has been no statewide polling on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   To get it on the ballot, proponents collected 34,000 signatures,
representing about 8% of the registered voters in this sparsely
populated state. They have been handing out balloons and brochures at
fairs, festivals and forums across South Dakota.</TE>
<TE>   They also launched a contest for the "best courtroom horror
story," promising more than $4,000 in prizes. Newland said he has
received at least 80 entries so far -- and while all the contestants
support his proposed reforms, not all will be able to vote for
Amendment A. A number sent in their stories from the state
penitentiary.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents, meanwhile, have been afraid to do much public
campaigning. Lawyers have debated the amendment at forums across the
state -- including one here last week at the University of South
Dakota law school. They worry that advertising might backfire. Voters
tend to be suspicious of attorneys -- so they might reason that if
the state bar opposes Amendment A, it must be good.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a tremendous amount of fear in the legal community,"
Larson said.</TE>
<TE>   Amendment A represents a new tactic in the long history of jury
nullification drives.</TE>
<TE>   For the last 13 years, a group called the Fully Informed Jury
Assn. has been peddling the concept to politicians, lobbying for
legislation in Oklahoma, Arizona, Montana and elsewhere. That hasn't
worked. So the group's founder, Larry Dodge, decided to go directly
to the voters. Newland agreed to sponsor the fight in South Dakota,
and the two raised $100,000 to get the issue on the ballot. If it
works, both men are eager to try the approach elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the key to getting control of the government back in the
hands of the citizens," said Dodge, a photographer.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides in the campaign agree that juries do sometimes ignore
the law -- and will continue to do so with or without Amendment A.</TE>
<TE>   A famous case of jury nullification took place nearly 270 years
ago, when publisher John Peter Zenger was accused of printing
"seditious libel" against the colonial governor of New York. His
newspaper articles were, in fact, seditious by the standards of the
time -- but they were accurate, and a jury acquitted Zenger, helping
establish the principle of a free press.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-19th century, Northern juries often refused to convict
men and women who harbored runaway slaves. Later, Southern juries
sometimes refused to convict those who lynched blacks or prevented
them from voting.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, former federal prosecutor Paul Butler noticed that
jurors in Washington, D.C. -- most of them black -- were refusing to
convict black defendants on minor drug charges, even when the
evidence was overwhelming. The experience pushed him to study
nullification -- and he now supports initiatives such as Amendment A.</TE>
<TE>   "If 12 citizens are saying that a certain law is being unfairly
applied, then I trust that judgment," said Butler, now a law
professor at George Washington University. "This is why juries were
established. We wanted human beings to bring their judgment to these
situations."</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Liepold, a law professor at the University of Illinois,
disagrees. He has studied jury nullification too. His conclusion:
Just because jurors sometimes ignore the law does not mean they
should be encouraged to do so.</TE>
<TE>   "Trials aren't designed to make policy judgments," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Folks who don't like a law, he added, should work through the
political process to change it.</TE>
<TE>   That's not good enough for Jason Koistinen, 23, a first-year law
student at the University of South Dakota. "It takes too long," he
said, declaring his intention to vote for Amendment A. "Also, a lot
of the legislators are old and conservative. They don't necessarily
reflect the views of the voters."</TE>
<TE>   Both sides in the debate agree on one point: With or without
Amendment A, justice is at times arbitrary -- and at times, elusive.
The question is whether the measure will make the system work better
or worse.</TE>
<TE>   "People get wrongly convicted based on false identifications, on
dishonest testimony, on incomplete evidence," said Mike Butler, an
attorney in Sioux Falls. "This amendment does not do anything to
correct those injustices."</TE>

<HD>Justice Dept. May Take Over Sniper Prosecution</HD>
<DH>Attorney general expects swift justice in the case. New
details emerge about the shootings and other possible related
slayings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ralph Vartabedian and Mark Fineman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Justice Department moved closer Tuesday to taking over the
prosecution of the Washington area sniper case, filing a complaint in
federal court in Maryland that alleges John Allen Muhammad was
responsible for the shooting rampage that terrorized the region this
month.</LD>
<LD>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, calling the shootings atrocities, said
he has not decided whether federal or state prosecutors would conduct
the first trial of Muhammad, 41. But he said he expects swift justice
and wants available the most serious penalties -- a reference to the
death sentence.</LD>
<LD>   The complaint and an accompanying federal affidavit contain
important new details about the shootings, but the documents did not
name Muhammad's alleged partner, Lee Boyd Malvo, 17. However, it is
believed that Malvo is also facing federal charges under sealed
proceedings that apply to minors in the federal court system.</LD>
<TE>   The affidavit noted that when police finally caught up with
Muhammad and Malvo at a Maryland freeway rest stop Thursday, Muhammad
had several phony driver's licenses and a single brown cotton glove
stuck in a hole in the car trunk that matched a glove recovered at a
shooting scene in Silver Spring, Md., two days earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Among other items the pair carried was a Sony laptop computer, a
pair of two-way radios, various books, a global positioning system,
bolt cutters, two shooting mittens, a Bushmaster rifle and a gallon
jug of yellow liquid that was not further described, according to the
affidavit.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence continued to grow Tuesday that Muhammad and Malvo
allegedly engaged in crimes across the country, including a credit
card theft in Arizona that was detailed in the federal affidavit and
two possible shootings in Tacoma last year.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the slayings in and near the nation's capital, the
pair are charged with killing a liquor store clerk and wounding
another in Alabama on Sept. 21.</TE>
<TE>   In conversations with others, Muhammad referred to Malvo as a
sniper as early as six months before the Washington area shootings,
according to the affidavit.</TE>
<TE>   The federal complaint names six victims gunned down in Maryland
and one in Washington, but does not mention the Virginia shootings. A
Justice Department official said including the five Virginia
shootings would risk running afoul of Virginia's double jeopardy
protections.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint against Muhammad was filed in federal court in
Greenbelt, Md., and alleges that he violated the 47-year-old U.S.
Hobbs Act, a federal statute that was intended to fight union
corruption.</TE>
<TE>   The Hobbs violations allege that the pair conspired to commit
offenses against the United States. By adding allegations that they
used threats of extortion and physical violence, federal prosecutors
can seek the death penalty against Muhammad, Justice Department
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Under federal law, the death penalty does not apply to minors and
minors cannot be tried as adults. Malvo is already under indictment
for murder in Virginia, which does permit the execution of minors.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department has 10 days from the filing of a complaint
to indict a suspect, and a decision about where to conduct a trial
will almost certainly be made by then. But that issue could be
resolved much sooner, as early as this week, according to Justice
Department officials. Ashcroft said the department is trying to
cooperate with Maryland and Virginia, though political squabbles are
apparent.</TE>
<TE>   The affidavit said the murders are related, noting that the shots
were all taken at a distance and that ballistic tests showed that all
but three bullets had been matched to the same weapon. Ballistic
evidence from the first three shootings did not permit comparison, it
said.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the affidavit covers the necessary legal ground to prove
violations of the Hobbs Act, including showing that the shooting
occurred at businesses involved in interstate commerce, that the pair
crossed state lines in committing the crimes and that they made an
extortion attempt. The affidavit notes that Muhammad demanded $10
million be paid to a stolen Visa Platinum card issued by the Bank of
America. It also contained threats to kill other individuals.</TE>
<TE>   The affidavit confirms many other previously reported details
about the crimes, including the discovery of letters at shooting
sites, tarot cards and telephone calls by the suspects to police.</TE>
<TE>   It also mentions for the first time that the pair used a stolen
credit card from Arizona to purchase gasoline in Tacoma on April 9,
the first indication that Muhammad had returned to Tacoma after
leaving it earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Muhammad and Malvo took center stage Tuesday in Tacoma as
suspects in another homicide, a brutal Feb. 16 slaying that had
baffled detectives there.</TE>
<TE>   A 21-year-old single mother, Keenya Cook, was shot in the face as
she opened the front door of her aunt's house, most likely,
authorities said, to a visitor she knew.</TE>
<TE>   When Cook's aunt, Isa Nichols, returned from shopping that day,
she found Cook dead in the doorway and Cook's unharmed baby lying on
a diaper-changing table nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Tacoma police concluded at the time that Cook knew her killer
because there were no signs of forced entry. But they had no suspects
until Muhammad and Malvo were arrested and their faces broadcast on
nationwide television.</TE>
<TE>   Tacoma Police Chief David A. Brame said at a news conference late
Monday that a Tacoma gun hobbyist he declined to identify had
befriended and housed Muhammad and Malvo for several months this
year. The gun owner came forward after the two men were charged in
the sniper rampage.</TE>
<TE>   Brame said the man voluntarily turned over to police a .45-caliber
semiautomatic pistol and a .44 magnum revolver that he said he had
loaned to Muhammad on occasion during the first six months of this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Ballistic tests showed that the .45 automatic was the weapon that
killed Cook, according to the affidavit.</TE>
<TE>   Nichols family members then explained that Muhammad knew Cook's
aunt, who worked as a bookkeeper at Muhammad's Tacoma truck and car
repair shop before it went out of business. They also said Nichols
had befriended Muhammad's second wife, Mildred, and sided with her
during the couple's bitter custody battle over their three children.</TE>
<TE>   Several family members now suspect Cook was killed out of revenge.</TE>
<TE>   Malcolm Nichols, Cook's uncle, said in an interview that Muhammad
and his wife had been guests at his Tacoma home for barbecues,
dominoes and card parties. The problems started after Muhammad and
wife separated and the Nichols family assisted the FBI in finding the
couple's children, who were with Muhammad, Nichols said.</TE>
<TE>   Other ballistic tests on the .44-caliber magnum showed that it was
used in a shooting several months later at Tacoma's Temple Beth El
synagogue, according to Brame.</TE>
<TE>   No one was hurt in the shooting last May, which left a bullet
lodged in the ark that contains the Torah, Judaism's sacred writings.
Rabbi Mark Glickman dismissed the shooting as vandalism at the time.
But after Muhammad and Malvo were linked to Tacoma, he asked police
to reinvestigate.</TE>

<HD>Tentative Pact Reached for Capistrano Teachers</HD>
<DH>If it's ratified next month, the agreement will boost
salaries 5.5% in two steps.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Teacher salaries in the county's third-largest district would be
increased 5.5% in the next two years under a tentative contract
agreement that will be voted on by union and school board members,
according to details released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Capistrano Unified School District's agreement was reached
last week after more than a year of sometimes bitter negotiations
that culminated in a 19-hour session mediated by the state labor
board. The district was the last in the county to settle a contract
with its teachers.</LD>
<LD>   Union members will vote on ratification next week. Trustees will
vote on the contract Nov. 18.</LD>
<TE>   "Both sides worked hard to come up with a solution that was
fiscally responsible yet recognized the value that the board places
on teachers," school board Vice President John Casabianca said.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers and other union members would get a 3.5% raise for the
previous school year, retroactive to February. A 2% raise for the
current year would be given retroactive to July.</TE>
<TE>   The contract would expire in June 2004. During the final year, the
increase would equal the amount the state allows for cost-of-living
adjustments.</TE>
<TE>   Capistrano Unified Education Assn. President Frank Weirath
credited teachers' tenacious efforts for winning the salary
increases.</TE>
<TE>   "Without the strong support of CUEA members and the pressure put
on the district by parents and the community, we would not have an
agreement today," he said.</TE>

<HD>Patient Dies After Visit to Faith Healer</HD>
<DH>The Santa Ana man sought help for a rash but was injected
with an unidentified substance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Andrew Blankstein and Richard Fausset</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Santa Ana man who sought out a Van Nuys faith healer to treat a
persistent rash went into convulsions and died after the healer's
assistant injected him with an unidentified substance, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Roberto Caceres, 54, was rushed to Valley Presbyterian Hospital in
Van Nuys, where he was pronounced dead shortly after 6 p.m. Monday,
police said.</LD>
<LD>   Reina Isabel Chavarria, 48, and her assistant, 28-year-old
Margarita Montes, were arrested on suspicion of involuntary
manslaughter. Investigators said they could face more serious
charges, pending the outcome of the police investigation.</LD>
<TE>   Caceres and his wife traveled from Santa Ana to Chavarria's home
in the 15700 block of Marlin Place after learning of her practice
through Spanish-language newspapers and talking with others who had
sought out her services, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Police Department investigators said Caceres had gone
to four doctors seeking treatment for a rash that had broken out over
his body. When the rash persisted, he turned to the faith healer.</TE>
<TE>   "This should be a warning for people to have more confidence in
traditional medicine instead of being treated by somebody rubbing an
egg on their back or giving them herbs or ointments," said Van Nuys
homicide Det. Al Aldaz. "The person receiving these treatments had no
idea of where they got this medicine or even if it's clean."</TE>
<TE>   Chavarria, who is being held at the Van Nuys Jail along with
Montes in lieu of $25,000 bail, owns the modest white house with
bright red trim near the San Diego Freeway, where police say she has
run the faith healing business for at least a year. The yard,
containing rosebushes and daisies, has statues of the Virgin Mary,
Jesus and angels.</TE>
<TE>   Chavarria set up a waiting room inside, complete with a soda
vending machine, police said. In what Chavarria called a "treatment
room," investigators found candles, religious figurines and what
appeared to be a shrine made up of voodoo dolls, with likenesses of
saints and the Virgin Mary.</TE>
<TE>   A dog slept on the treatment table that was used to give
injections, Aldaz said.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said they observed a constant flow of mostly
working-class Latino families at the home.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Gastelum, 57, said he saw people lined up in front of the
house as early as 4:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally neighbors called police, Gastelum said, when they
noticed people leaving their children in their cars while the adults
went into the home, holding what appeared to be Bibles.</TE>
<TE>   Caceres arrived at the home about 5 p.m. Monday, but was told that
the healer was busy with other patients, authorities said. About an
hour later, the assistant administered a shot and Caceres went into
convulsions, Aldaz said.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives, who seized the syringe, said the Los Angeles County
coroner's office will conduct an autopsy and toxicology tests.</TE>

<HD>Davis Denounces Credibility of Accuser</HD>
<DH>Governor says fund-raising allegations were the felon's bid
to reduce his prison time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Finnegan and Mark Z. Barabak</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis on Tuesday tersely brushed aside a convicted
racketeer's accusations of improper campaign fund-raising against
him, saying the source was "desperate" to get out of prison when he
made the statements.</LD>
<LD>   Davis' remarks came a day after his Republican rival, Bill Simon
Jr., said the governor "owes more to the people of California than
just dismissive denials" of the allegations by convicted felon Mark
L. Nathanson.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, a federal judge unsealed court records showing that
Nathanson tried in 1993 and 1994 to implicate Davis in improper
fund-raising. At the time, prosecutors concluded that Nathanson had
no credibility and they found no evidence of a crime.</LD>
<TE>   At a campaign stop with black ministers here Tuesday, Davis
explained why his campaign threatened last week to sue TV stations if
they were to run a potential Simon ad on Nathanson.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, Davis said, found "that no
decent newspaper would report these allegations without also
faithfully reporting the doubts the U.S. attorney and the courts had
about these allegations, because these were the desperate words of a
convicted felon and an admitted perjurer trying to reduce his
sentence."</TE>
<TE>   "The FBI did not believe him," Davis went on. "The U.S. attorney
called him a liar. And the federal district court called the charges
libelous. Now we have a right to tell the stations this is the kind
of credibility that law enforcement and the courts attach to the
words of this convicted felon."</TE>
<TE>   The release of the Nathanson records came eight days before the
Nov. 5 election. Nathanson was a state Coastal Commission member who
went to prison in 1993 for extorting payments from property owners
seeking permits to build on the oceanfront.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Simon made Nathanson's allegations the main focus of
his day, demanding at a Malibu news conference that Davis respond to
questions raised by the convicted racketeer, who told prosecutors
that Davis had asked him for the names of people he had helped in
coastal business so that Davis could solicit campaign donations from
them. Davis was then state controller.</TE>
<TE>   But on Tuesday, Simon did not mention the accusations in remarks
at campaign stops in San Diego and Oakland. Instead, he waited until
reporters asked him about Nathanson, then briefly reiterated his
comments from the day before.</TE>
<TE>   "I said that Mr. Davis owed the people of California some answers;
I still feel the same way," Simon said after a speech in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Simon's apparent reticence to aggressively press the
matter, his campaign rushed into production a new television ad on
Nathanson's accusations. Simon declined to say whether he would air
it.</TE>
<TE>   But Simon began broadcasting an ad that blames Davis for bad
schools, rising electricity rates and other troubles.</TE>
<TE>   "Under Gray Davis, traffic is hopeless," Simon says in the ad. "So
if you've had enough, if you want real change, I'm asking for your
vote. I'm Bill Simon."</TE>
<TE>   Davis has been airing a commercial that used the words of the
state's newspapers to undercut Simon's credibility. The criticisms
were leveled at Simon after he alleged Oct. 8 that Davis had accepted
illegal contributions -- only to be forced to recant the accusation
when it turned out to be false.</TE>
<TE>   Davis also put out a new TV spot Tuesday pledging improvements in
education, transportation and health care.</TE>
<TE>   At his San Diego campaign appearance, Simon criticized the
governor for previous ads that cast the GOP candidate as a corporate
scoundrel. In a speech to about 100 women in a hotel ballroom, Simon
accused Davis of "lying about me and trying to distort my record."</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be a close election in part because Gray Davis has
completely tarnished me in all his ads," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon called the hotel rally his "final women's event" of the
campaign. A key goal for Simon has been to win back women voters, who
have deserted Republican candidates in recent California elections.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's main tactic for appealing to women has been to promise
better schools. On Tuesday, he broadened that effort by saying that
Davis' mishandling of state finances had harmed small businesses
owned by women.</TE>
<TE>   "When he says that he's right in the mainstream, and he reaches
out to women, how can he reach out to women when you're killing the
golden goose, when you're strangling the very thing that will mean
opportunity for women in this state?" Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has argued that Simon's opposition to abortion rights --
among other things -- puts him out of step with mainstream California
voters.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Davis certainly has been into symbols, scare tactics, those
kinds of things," Simon said after his speech. "I've been trying to
focus on real ideas and real solutions to real problems that face all
Californians."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Davis avoided any mention of Simon's name during his
brief campaign stop Tuesday at Allen Temple Baptist Church in the
predominantly black flatlands of East Oakland.</TE>

<HD>School Lauds a Gem of a Gym</HD>
<DH>Kennedy High in Granada Hills will mark the dedication of a
new, nicer facility to replace one damaged in the 1994 earthquake.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Pearson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three principals and two generations of students later, Kennedy High
School finally has the new gymnasium many had envisioned after the
Northridge earthquake wreaked havoc on the Granada Hills campus.</LD>
<LD>   For eight years, students have made do with a badly damaged gym
that sank at an angle after the 6.7 magnitude earthquake weakened the
soil underneath.</LD>
<LD>   Tiles fell from the ceiling and doors no longer closed because
their frames were slanted. The same floor that Anaheim Angels star
Garret Anderson once ran as a high school basketball player had to be
shaved to keep it level.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, school and federal officials debated whether to build a
new structure or repair the existing one. Two years ago, the Federal
Emergency Management Agency gave the Los Angeles Unified School
District permission to proceed with construction. Altogether, L.A.
Unified received $191 million in federal funds for earthquake
repairs. The district immediately made plans to build a $7-million
gym at Kennedy, the school most severely damaged in the 1994 quake.</TE>
<TE>   "The district has taken a black eye for Belmont," Craig Raub, head
of the Kennedy physical education department, said in reference to
the environmentally hazardous school construction site downtown. "But
our gym came about through cooperation between teachers, parents,
FEMA and kids. The best part is when the alumni come back. They're
going to wish they went to school here after an earthquake."</TE>
<TE>   The school learned to adapt shortly after the disastrous tremor
forced students into trailers, Raub said. At first, the old gym was
red-tagged and off limits. After a few months, enough precautionary
repairs were made -- a tarp was hung to catch falling ceiling debris,
for example -- that the building could be used again. With no locker
rooms, students formed a human curtain around classmates so they
could change into gym clothes.</TE>
<TE>   Today, school board members, students, teachers and parents will
dedicate the facility that is safer than its predecessor and is a
stark contrast to the drab designs of most district schools. The old
Kennedy gym was windowless and so poorly lighted that television
crews had to bring extra lights to tape events. The new gym, built
nearby, has ample lighting, and glass blocks dot its facade to bring
in sunlight.</TE>
<TE>   And then there are the $250,000 maple floors that will give
athletes' steps more bounce and prevent injuries by absorbing shock.
The old floor was so dull it made visiting players wonder why they
couldn't jump as high.</TE>
<TE>   "This is L.A. Unified's showpiece" gymnasium, said architect
Rebecca L. Binder, who also designed the school's administration
building, which opened in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The 44,000-square-foot building also features an auxiliary gym, a
classroom, locker rooms, offices and a much-welcomed air-conditioned
weight room.</TE>
<TE>   "In the summer, we would sweat so much we'd get dehydrated," said
junior Jorge Rivera of the old weight room, where the roof leaked and
the walls were etched with graffiti. "It stank like nasty."</TE>
<TE>   Varsity volleyball player Brittany Boulton said the new building
is aesthetically something to be proud of, but more important, safer
than the old gym.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel like tiles are going to fall on my head," the
17-year-old said.</TE>
<TE>   Deborah Bennett, a parent of a Kennedy graduate, lobbied since
1996 with other parents and teachers and school board member Julie
Korenstein to get a new gym built.</TE>
<TE>   "Bless Kennedy," she said. "It was horrible what happened in the
earthquake. Like a lot of us, our houses are better off now. But you
have to go through [a lot] to get there."</TE>

<HD>Prop. 46 Aims to Ease State's Housing Pinch</HD>
<DH>Measure would create or preserve up to 134,000 units and
address a range of related needs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tara Sheedy knew she could not afford a single-family house in San
Jose. The median house costs $463,000. The high school algebra
teacher makes $46,000 a year.</LD>
<LD>   But after more than a year of searching for a townhouse -- a goal
the conscientious saver thought was realistic -- Sheedy could not
find one. When the school day ends, she heads to a house she shares
with her dogs and three other teachers. She pays $600 a month rent
for one room.</LD>
<LD>   Supporters of Proposition 46 say Sheedy's dilemma, and that of
other Californians like her, may help persuade voters to approve the
$2.1-billion housing bond issue.</LD>
<TE>   "What's resonating with people is that now the middle class needs
support," said Jan Breidenbach of the Southern California Assn. of
Non-Profit Housing. "The more people realize the housing crisis is
[so] great, the more people are willing to do something about it."</TE>
<TE>   In the language of advocates, California's affordable-housing
crisis has "filtered up" the economic ladder. Long a problem for
low-income people, it is now wreaking havoc in the lives of people
like Sheedy, professionals still unable to purchase homes or rent
decent apartments.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I wouldn't be able to buy a single-family home, which is
what I'd really like," said Sheedy, who holds a master's degree. "But
I thought I'd buy a townhouse and then start trading up. I was
surprised that housing prices are as much as they are."</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 46 is expected to create or preserve 131,000 to
134,000 units of housing statewide, according to the California
Department of Housing and Community Development. The bond issue would
include money for a wide range of needs.</TE>
<TE>   The legislative analyst's office estimates that the bonds would
help about 60,000 Californians purchase homes, create about 30,000
new domestic violence and homeless shelter beds, and assist 10,000
farm worker families.</TE>
<TE>   The bond money would be spread among 21 housing programs and would
be administered by the state Department of Housing. In general, the
money would be allocated in the form of low-interest loans to
builders, grants to cities and down-payment assistance loans to home
buyers.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters say the money would stretch even further, with builders
using it to attract other construction funds from lenders. According
to state estimates, the $2.1 billion could leverage as much as $15
billion.</TE>
<TE>   That money, supporters say, would help fill an unmet need. To
house its booming population, California needs to create at least
200,000 housing units a year through 2020. But between 1990 and 2001,
an average of 116,922 building permits were issued each year,
according to a report last week by the California Budget Project.</TE>
<TE>   If passed, the bonds would provide relief to those needing
immediate shelter. On any given night, 360,000 Californians are
homeless. Last year, 23,000 women and children were turned away from
domestic violence shelters because there was no room.</TE>
<TE>   "People are staying longer in marginal living conditions --
shelters, motels, hotels or in their cars -- than they might have
five or 10 years ago because the market is so tight," said Ruth
Schwartz, executive director of Shelter Partnership Inc., a Los
Angeles-based nonprofit that supports homeless programs.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the bond issue, including the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers
Assn., argue that Proposition 46 would sink the state further into
debt while doing little to resolve the housing crunch.</TE>
<TE>   The legislative analyst's office estimates the bonds would cost
the state $4.7 billion over 30 years, which includes the principle
and $2.6 billion in interest.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a massive bond," said Jon Coupal, president of the Jarvis
group. "Its debt repayment cost exceeds the amount of proceeds to be
used for programs.... California's credit rating is at the bottom of
the heap right now, and that's a real concern."</TE>
<TE>   In a newspaper commentary, state Sen. Ray Haynes (R-Riverside), a
leading opponent of the proposition, said the bond issue is aimed at
the very poor, not middle-class home-buyers.</TE>
<TE>   "That means if you are not on welfare, homeless, or a farm worker,
you get nothing," he wrote. "If all you are trying to do is find a
house in the same time zone as your workplace, you are out of luck."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, a long list of groups have lined up in support of the
measure, from AARP to the California State Sheriff's Assn., and
various chambers of commerce.</TE>
<TE>   In San Francisco, where an estimated 8,000 to 15,000 people are
homeless, those in the tourist industry say an increasingly visible
homeless population is driving away business. The problem has emerged
as a key election issue.</TE>
<TE>   At New Directions, a residential rehabilitation facility in West
Los Angeles, homeless veterans try to put their lives back together.
They deal with their addictions, receive training in culinary arts or
computers and eventually find jobs. But most make only about $8.75 an
hour.</TE>
<TE>   "When rents are between $850 and $1,200, how do they do it?" asked
Toni Reinis, executive director. "Generally, we encourage people to
roommate, and that helps a little bit, but there just simply isn't
enough affordable housing."</TE>
<TE>   Supporters say the strong backing for Proposition 46 illustrates
just how bad and far-reaching the housing problem has become. Last
year, California's rate of homeownership was 58%, compared to 68%
nationwide. In San Francisco, where the median price of a home
reached $551,000 in 2002, only 32% of residents were able to afford a
home, among the lowest rates in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   California renters fare no better. More than half of renters in
the state's metropolitan areas pay more than 30% of their incomes on
rent. In Los Angeles County, the average rent is nearly $1,300 a
month. In Orange County, it is $1,232, while in Ventura County,
residents pay $1,216 on average.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're earning even twice the minimum wage, you fall short by
a third of what you need to afford an apartment in today's economy,"
said Christine Minnehan of the Western Center on Law and Poverty,
which sponsored the initiative. "You don't have to be a farm worker
or on welfare to be eligible for one of these apartments the bond
will create."</TE>
<TE>   After 15 years of apartment living in Hollywood, paying rent with
the help of a government subsidy, 64-year-old Esther Crawford lost
her apartment and moved into a single-room-occupancy hotel on Los
Angeles' Skid Row -- the only place she could afford.</TE>
<TE>   "I got put out because the owner wanted more money," Crawford
said. "That's the name of the game -- more money."</TE>
<TE>   There is no organized campaign against Proposition 46. Supporters
have raised about $1 million to campaign for it.</TE>

<HD>Donation by GOP Heats Up Race for Insurance Chief</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Virginia Ellis</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>As the election nears, the Republican Party has dropped $1.2 million
into the campaign of insurance commissioner candidate Gary Mendoza,
enabling him to unleash a spate of negative commercials against his
opponent, former commissioner John Garamendi.</LD>
<LD>   The donation -- the largest the party has given this year to any
statewide candidate, including gubernatorial hopeful Bill Simon Jr.
-- suggests that Republican leaders are pinning their hopes on
Mendoza, a Latino with a pro-consumer record, to fend off what polls
have indicated could be a Democratic sweep of statewide offices.</LD>
<LD>   A consumer group criticized the party's assistance, however,
saying large insurance firm donations to the Republican Party in
recent weeks may have helped make it possible.</LD>
<TE>   "Insurance company contributions to a commissioner candidate are
the kiss of death," said Douglas Heller of the Santa Monica-based
Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. "What better way to
avoid the scrutiny of the voting public than to give it to the party
rather than directly to the candidate?"</TE>
<TE>   Party spokesman Rob Stutzman said there was no connection between
the insurance company money and the Republican contribution to
Mendoza, noting that it's illegal for contributors to donate money to
the party with the proviso that it then be given to a particular
candidate. And he said the $322,500 the party has received from
insurance companies this month falls far short of the $1.2 million
given Mendoza.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Heller is creating fantasies," Stutzman said.</TE>
<TE>   But the donation has made a contest out of a race that until a few
weeks ago was considered by many to be Garamendi's to lose.</TE>
<TE>   After his first election to public office in 1974, Garamendi's
terms in the state Assembly and Senate, his service as California's
first elected insurance commissioner and unsuccessful races for
governor and state controller gave him high name recognition. He
easily won the Democratic primary despite facing a candidate who
received $1.5 million in insurance company contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Until party money began to pour into Mendoza's campaign Oct. 18,
Garamendi, 57, had a 3-1 lead in fund-raising. With loans and
contributions, he collected nearly $3 million, while Mendoza, 47, had
received only $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   "This donation is a very serious effort on [the Republican
Party's] part to challenge my candidacy, and we take it very
seriously," said Garamendi. "I'm doing my best to counter with
appropriate television and outreach."</TE>
<TE>   California has had an elected insurance commissioner only since
1992, but rising insurance rates, a crisis in the workers'
compensation system and a scandal that forced the resignation of the
last elected commissioner, Chuck Quackenbush, have made the office
highly visible.</TE>
<TE>   The next leader will take over at a time of turbulence in the
industry when many insurers are refusing to write homeowners
policies, construction is being slowed by the difficulty contractors
have getting coverage, and workers' compensation carriers are leaving
the state.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their differences, both candidates have refused donations
from the industry and each has promised a pro-consumer approach to
regulation.</TE>
<TE>   "Both candidates have taken a very strident view that they do not
plan to bring balance to this office," said Dan Dunmoyer, president
of the Personal Insurance Federation. "They plan to side primarily
with the consumer no matter what the consequence to business."</TE>
<TE>   Mendoza, a lawyer who was former Los Angeles Mayor Richard
Riordan's deputy for economic development, focuses on his decisions
as former commissioner of corporations in the administration of
Republican Gov. Pete Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   It was Mendoza who persuaded Blue Cross of California to transfer
$2 billion to two charitable foundations when it converted from a
nonprofit health insurer to a for-profit company. Among the functions
of the foundations was improving access to health care for the
uninsured.</TE>
<TE>   Since leaving office, Mendoza has been hired by Wellpoint
Healthcare Network -- the for-profit successor company to Blue Cross
-- to push for a similar conversion in Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   Garamendi, who plans no negative ads because "I prefer the
positive," tells voters that when he was commissioner, he forced
insurance firms to make bigger payouts to those hurt by wildfires in
Southern California and the Oakland Hills.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm well known in the state, and my positives are very good,"
Garamendi said. "My opponent is totally unknown. My task is to remind
the public who I am and what I have done."</TE>
<TE>   First-time candidate Mendoza tries to counter Garamendi's name
recognition by suggesting that his record is flawed.</TE>
<TE>   "My opponent's campaign strategy boils down to two things," he
said. "A vague familiarity with the name and a lack of familiarity
with his record."</TE>
<TE>   Mendoza airs ads accusing Garamendi of selling off assets in the
1991 bankruptcy of Executive Life when they were undervalued.
Garamendi said he tried to return full benefits of all policies to
the policyholders but had to sell assets during economic turbulence.</TE>

<HD>Jackson Running Strong in District 35</HD>
<DH>Three challengers, one whose name isn't on the ballot, have
little money, experience or backing to overtake the two-term
assemblywoman.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Massie Ritsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 35th Assembly District race seems all too familiar.</LD>
<LD>   Incumbent Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara) has cash,
endorsements, a district that favors her political party and a long
list of legislative accomplishments. Her three challengers have
little money, few big-name backers and no political experience.</LD>
<LD>   Despite this lopsided slate in a district comprising parts of
Santa Barbara County, Ventura and Oxnard, the incumbent says she is
"not taking anything for granted" and the underdogs say they just
want to "offer an alternative."</LD>
<TE>   Jackson has raised more than $250,000 to run for her third and
final two-year term. Defeating her is "not impossible, but very
improbable," said Republican challenger Christina "C.C." Martin.</TE>
<TE>   Martin's pursuit is even more uphill than those of Libertarian
candidate Craig Warren Thomas, a music instructor, and Reform
candidate Cary Savitch, a physician. Martin's name is not on the Nov.
5 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican whose name will appear, educational consultant Bob
Pohl, left the race in September after learning he has lymphatic
cancer. Pohl had raised enough money to threaten Jackson--about
$160,000--but Martin has amassed only $3,000 in her five-week
campaign, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Martin is a financial advisor from Oxnard, which was added to the
35th District during the most recent redistricting process. The area
is not solidly inclined to either major party. (Jackson's predecessor
was a Republican.)</TE>
<TE>   Of the district's 215,000 registered voters, 44% are Democrats and
about 34% are Republicans. More than 15% have not declared a party
and the rest belong to minor parties, such as Libertarian and Reform.</TE>
<TE>   "We sort of run for office in self-defense, to try and stop
politicians from taking more of our property," said Thomas, a
registered Libertarian since 1976. If elected, the first-time
candidate from Ventura said, "I would try to get government out of
the lives of citizens as much as possible and try to reduce taxes."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said she is using her campaign to tell voters that she has
delivered on promises made in her 1998 and 2000 runs.</TE>
<TE>   "I now have, I think, a pretty proud record," she said.</TE>
<TE>   A former prosecutor and divorce attorney, Jackson has introduced
legislation on education, health care, the environment, public safety
and consumer privacy, with much of it signed into law. She is
chairwoman of the Assembly's Natural Resources Committee and has the
endorsements of Gov. Gray Davis and numerous elected officials in the
two counties she represents.</TE>
<TE>   In the 2002 legislative session, Jackson successfully sponsored
bills to regulate pesticide spraying near schools, double fines for
traffic violations near campuses, track oil transferred among coastal
refineries and require that certain doctors learn how to perform
abortions.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson is among the Assembly's more liberal Democrats. She has a
reputation among the party's more centrist members and Republicans
for not being pragmatic about the compromises that politics can
require.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson denies that.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they confuse passion with inflexibility," she said. "If
[colleagues] are willing to be reasonable, willing to focus on what's
best for the people and not the special interests, I've been, I
believe, very cooperative."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, who lives in Santa Barbara, dismisses talk that
Sacramento's leaders were punishing her by redrawing in Republicans'
favor the Senate district that could have been her next political
step.</TE>
<TE>   In her Assembly race, she faces a particularly virulent challenger
in Reform candidate Savitch.</TE>
<TE>   A specialist in infectious diseases, the outspoken Ventura doctor
blames Jackson and other lawyers for instilling in physicians,
teachers, police officers and other professionals a fear of being
sued.</TE>
<TE>   "It is impossible to make medical care affordable when doctors are
afraid of patients," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In public health, Savitch wants to change the way California
tracks HIV cases -- recording patients by name, rather than by
numerical code. And he wants the state and nation to prepare for the
possibility that terrorists might use smallpox as a weapon.</TE>
<TE>   "We would be thrown into the Dark Ages if we had smallpox today,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Martin is campaigning as "C.C." instead of Christina to make
write-in voting easier, she said. She wants the state to fund more
vocational programs for students not inclined to go to college and
expand health care for the middle-income elderly and those of all
ages with mental disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   To combat urban sprawl, she said, there should be more incentives
for renovating older homes and apartment buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Martin said her 11th-hour candidacy is a warmup for 2004, when
term limits will force Jackson out of the Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   "You can expect to see me again," Martin said. "Most definitely."</TE>

<HD>Last-Minute Mailers: Covert Campaigning?</HD>
<DH>The motives of out-of-town donors who paid for 'hit' fliers
sent to Dana Point and Mission Viejo are questioned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean O. Pasco</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Terry Juhl of Dana Point wasn't happy when he thumbed through his
mail over the weekend and found a political brochure that slammed two
councilmen while urging votes for three opponents.</LD>
<LD>   The mailer was from the Dana Point Voters League, which filed its
first campaign report late last week. Two out-of-town donors with no
obvious ties to Dana Point gave the group $9,000. Its address is a
private postal box.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a stealth campaign," fumed Juhl, a designer, who said he
has no council favorites.</LD>
<TE>   Similar mailbox appeals are popping up across Orange County,
hoping to sway voters in the crucial final days before Tuesday's
election.</TE>
<TE>   In Mission Viejo, a group called Friends of Mission Viejo
collected $19,300, mostly from five companies outside of Mission
Viejo, to back an incumbent and two challengers.</TE>
<TE>   Last-minute "hit mailers" from third parties are as old as
politics. But a dearth of competitive legislative and congressional
races may have contributed to more local activity this year, said
attorney Bill Mitchell, former head of the county chapter of Common
Cause, a government watchdog group.</TE>
<TE>   "Voters need to be very suspicious of groups doing this [mail] at
the last minute," he said. "If they're not violating the law, then
they're undermining it. Voters need to ask: Why do these people want
to hide?"</TE>
<TE>   The Dana Point Voters League sent two four-color brochures
critical of incumbents Harold Kaufman and Wayne Rayfield. Its
campaign form, filed Oct. 24, reported $5,000 from Lenawee Trust of
Irvine and $4,000 from Gallo Corp. of Laguna Beach. All but $48 was
spent.</TE>
<TE>   A call to Gallo Corp., a building contractor, wasn't returned.
Lenawee Trust wasn't listed in local, state or federal databases.</TE>
<TE>   The Dana Point group supports candidates Jim Lacy, Greg Powers and
Russ Chilton. They are among 10 candidates, including two incumbents,
seeking three seats.</TE>
<TE>   Friends of Mission Viejo, meanwhile, filed its first reports
Friday. The largest donations, at $5,000 each, came from Astrum
Utility Services and For the Game, both listed at the same address in
Solana Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Astrum organizes municipal utilities; For the Game develops and
operates recreational facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Calls to Jeff Scott with For the Game and Len Viejo of Astrum
weren't returned.</TE>
<TE>   Other sizable contributions were received from Madison Materials
and Ware Disposal in Newport Beach, both owned by Judy Ware, and
Southwest Inspection and Testing in Santa Fe Springs, which tests
construction materials. Former state senator John Lewis of Orange
gave $2,000 worth of political consulting.</TE>
<TE>   The Mission Viejo mailers back Councilman John Paul Ledesma and
candidates Patricia Kelly and Lance Maclean. Seven other candidates,
including two incumbents, are vying for three seats in Tuesday's
election.</TE>

<HD>Last-Minute Mailers: Covert Campaigning?</HD>
<DH>The motives of out-of-town contributors who paid for 'hit'
fliers that were sent to Dana Point and Mission Viejo residents are
questioned.</DH>

<LD>Terry Juhl of Dana Point wasn't happy when he thumbed through his
mail over the weekend and found a political brochure that slammed two
councilmen while urging votes for three opponents.</LD>
<LD>   The mailer was from the Dana Point Voters League, which filed its
first campaign report late last week. Two out-of-town donors with no
obvious ties to Dana Point gave the group $9,000. Its address is a
private postal box.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a stealth campaign," fumed Juhl, a designer, who said he
has no council favorites.</LD>
<TE>   Similar mailbox appeals are popping up across Orange County,
hoping to sway voters in the crucial final days before Tuesday's
election.</TE>
<TE>   In Mission Viejo, a group called Friends of Mission Viejo
collected $19,300, mostly from five companies outside Mission Viejo,
to back an incumbent and two challengers.</TE>
<TE>   Last-minute "hit mailers" from third parties are as old as
politics. But a dearth of competitive legislative and congressional
races may have contributed to more local activity this year, said
attorney Bill Mitchell, former head of the county chapter of Common
Cause, a government watchdog group.</TE>
<TE>   "Voters need to be very suspicious of groups doing this [mail] at
the last minute," he said. "If they're not violating the law, then
they're undermining it. Voters need to ask: Why do these people want
to hide?"</TE>
<TE>   The Dana Point Voters League sent two four-color brochures
critical of incumbents Harold Kaufman and Wayne Rayfield. Its
campaign form, filed Oct. 24, reported $5,000 from Lenawee Trust of
Irvine and $4,000 from Gallo Corp. of Laguna Beach.</TE>
<TE>   A call to Gallo Corp., a building contractor, wasn't returned.
Lenawee Trust wasn't listed in local, state or federal databases.</TE>
<TE>   The Dana Point group supports candidates Jim Lacy, Greg Powers and
Russ Chilton. They are among 10 candidates, including two incumbents,
seeking three seats.</TE>
<TE>   Friends of Mission Viejo, meanwhile, filed its first reports
Friday. The largest donations, at $5,000 each, came from Astrum
Utility Services and For the Game, both listed at the same address in
Solana Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Astrum organizes municipal utilities; For the Game develops and
operates recreational facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Calls to Jeff Scott with For the Game and Len Viejo of Astrum
weren't returned.</TE>
<TE>   Other sizable contributions were received from Madison Materials
and Ware Disposal in Newport Beach, both owned by Judy Ware, and
Southwest Inspection and Testing in Santa Fe Springs, which tests
construction materials. Former state senator John Lewis of Orange
gave $2,000 worth of political consulting.</TE>
<TE>   The Mission Viejo mailers back Councilman John Paul Ledesma and
candidates Patricia Kelly and Lance Maclean. Seven other candidates,
including two incumbents, are vying for three seats in Tuesday's
election.</TE>

<HD>6 Students and Brea Police Officer Hurt in Collision</HD>
<DH>A sport utility vehicle leaving Esperanza High campus in
Anaheim reportedly cuts in front of unmarked police van and is struck
broadside.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Six Esperanza High students were injured Tuesday in front of the
campus when their sport utility vehicle collided with a van driven by
a police officer assigned to patrol the Anaheim school.</LD>
<LD>   According to police, the six students were in a Ford Explorer
heading west as they left a parking lot at the high school about 2:55
p.m., the end of the school day for many of the 2,800 students
enrolled there.</LD>
<LD>   Police said the students, whose names were not released because of
their ages, cut in front of the unmarked police van, driven by Brea
Police Officer Irene Cruz, who was heading north on Kellogg Drive.</LD>
<TE>   The van hit the Explorer broadside, according to police, and two
students were thrown from the vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Those students were taken to Western Medical Center in Anaheim,
but the extent of their injuries was unknown.</TE>
<TE>   David Verdugo, assistant superintendent of the Placentia-Yorba
Linda Unified School District, said that "our first impression is
that their injuries were not life-threatening."</TE>
<TE>   Cruz was also taken to an area hospital; her condition was not
released.</TE>
<TE>   The other students were taken to Kaiser Permanente Anaheim Medical
Center. Three were treated and released; the condition of the fourth
was unknown.</TE>
<TE>   School officials and student-services workers were at the scene to
explain the presence of police cars and ambulances to other students,
Verdugo said.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz is a resource officer provided by the Brea Police Department
for safety and patrol duties at the school. The Anaheim Police
Department also provides a resource officer at the school and will
investigate the accident because the school is within the Anaheim
city limits.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim Police Sgt. Rick Martinez said it is too early to
determine how fast either of the vehicles was going and whether any
charges would be filed.</TE>

<LD>What is this strange grip sports has on us? Perhaps there's no better
time to ponder that again than while in the midst of thousands of
people lining the street and standing on rooftops, waiting for a
caravan of baseball players to come by. Which is what we were all
doing Tuesday morning out on Katella Avenue in Anaheim.</LD>
<LD>   No mystery, really. The answer lies in watching Bryan Wilkerson
and his 4-year-old son Jake among the crowd that has come to glimpse
not just any ballplayers but the newly crowned World Series champs,
the hometown Angels.</LD>
<LD>   For Wilkerson, 34, having grown up in Anaheim, this pursuit of a
World Series has been a life's work. So, the Wilkersons--Bryan, his
wife Angel, Jake and daughter Alyssa, 1 1/2 -- claimed their
territory on Katella around 8:45 and waited for the 11 a.m. start
time.</LD>
<TE>   "Who's going to autograph your ball?" Wilkerson says to Jake. "Tim
Salmon," Jake replies. "Who's number 25?" Bryan says. Jake, either
too shy or too proud to perform on command, hesitates. "Troy--" his
father suggests. "Troy Glaus!" Jake says.</TE>
<TE>   It's that simple: the Wilkersons are here because even a
4-year-old knows the players by name and because they want to see if
one of them will make their son's day.</TE>
<TE>   His plan: When Salmon passes by, Wilkerson will toss him the ball
and a pen. "If I throw it to him, he has to catch it, right?"
Wilkerson reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Jake has Plan B; it involves a red horn. "I'll blow the horn, and
you hand him the ball," he says to his dad.</TE>
<TE>   Bryan has been chided annually by his Dodger pals. Now he's the
one laughing and has passed the gene on to Jake, who spots a
Dodger-blue horn in the crowd. A moment later, Jake proclaims, "No
Dodger parade, no Dodger parade!"</TE>
<TE>   As the bounty of women and girls on this day proves, baseball is
about much more than fathers and sons. But a lot of it is about
fathers and sons.</TE>
<TE>   In a greensward behind their parade spot, Jake and Bryan kill time
playing catch. "Bring the heat," Bryan says. "Daddy, I'll bring the
heat," Jake replies. "He literally learned a windup watching "The
Rookie," Bryan says, referring to a baseball movie that came out
earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   I ask Wilkerson why grown-ups pay homage to ballplayers. "Somehow,
you're a part of it," he says, referring to the Angels' championship
season. "Or, you think you are."</TE>
<TE>   At 10:55, a loud cheer erupts. "They're starting, Jake!" Bryan
says. Jake reaches into his father's pocket and pulls out the
baseball.</TE>
<TE>   At 11:20, the caravan begins passing in front of the Wilkersons.
Shortstop David Eckstein is among the first players spotted, and
Wilkerson extends the ball toward him. Eckstein politely mouths, "No
way," referring to the logistical impossibility.</TE>
<TE>   Wilkerson calls out the players to Jake. "There's Troy Glaus!
Garret ... ! Spe-e-e-ez ... !"</TE>
<TE>   They spot Salmon but can't get his attention. And that quickly,
the parade is over.</TE>
<TE>   "You know why they're not signing it?" Jake laments afterward to
his father. "You're not telling them!"</TE>
<TE>   From what I know of Salmon, he'd have signed it if he could.</TE>
<TE>   Wilkerson knows the truth of the matter. Someday, Jake will tell
his own children of the day he couldn't get Tim Salmon to sign his
baseball. And they'll laugh about it.</TE>
<TE>   "It was something we won't ever forget," Wilkerson says of the
day. "I've got plenty of buddies I watch games with, but there was a
reason why today it was me, my wife and our two kids. It's our little
tradition. My parents did it with me, and when you look back on life,
the things I like I want to pass down to my kids."</TE>

<HD>Finding Is New Hurdle for Ahmanson Ranch</HD>
<DH>The chemical perchlorate is discovered in ground water at
the site.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Miguel Bustillo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Perchlorate, a potentially hazardous chemical, has been found in the
ground water at Ahmanson Ranch, a discovery that could present yet
another hurdle to the already besieged proposal to build a mini-city
of 3,050 homes west of the San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County officials found significant levels of perchlorate,
which has been linked to thyroid problems, in a 550-foot-deep sample
of Ahmanson Ranch ground water supplies earlier this year. The
amount, 28 micrograms per liter, was seven times higher than new
safety guidelines that the state has set for drinking water while it
develops more detailed regulations. The perchlorate was found at the
historic Ahmanson Ranch site in an area that would be set aside as
open space.</LD>
<LD>   Though government officials have not yet pinpointed the source of
the contamination, signs point to possible migration from the nearby
Santa Susana Field Laboratory, where rocket and nuclear reactor
testing has taken place since World War II. The former Rocketdyne
facility, now owned by Boeing, has left widespread chemical and
radiation contamination, including high levels of perchlorate, which
was often used to make rocket fuel. Earlier this year, officials
detected perchlorate in water wells in Simi Valley, which also shares
a border with the rocket testing ground.</LD>
<TE>   Ventura County officials, who are conducting an environmental
review of the proposed development, are still trying to determine
whether the perchlorate could have come from the rocket site, and
whether it is a threat to humans or wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still exploring the issue," said Ventura County senior
planner Dennis Hawkins. "If it is the result of an underground
connection to Rocketdyne, other contaminants should show up. And we
are mystified as to why they have not."</TE>
<TE>   State water quality officials, who were unaware until recently of
the perchlorate contamination at Ahmanson Ranch, told the county in
writing last week that they will need more time to review the
potential consequences before weighing in. Water officials are
concerned that the plans to pump water at the 2,800-acre Ahmanson
site to use at a golf course and for construction purposes could pull
contaminated ground water toward the development. That, they fear,
could impede efforts to clean up the Santa Susana site by causing
plumes of underground pollution to spread outward from the testing
facility.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to note that the well was never intended to be a
drinking water well," said Melinda Becker of the water board, "but
this could be a sign of the spreading of the contaminant plume.
Perchlorate tends to lead the plume."</TE>
<TE>   Environmental activists and others opposed to the development have
seized on the perchlorate findings, and are asking Ventura County
officials to slow down the process of approving it. A county panel is
scheduled to discuss the environmental review today, and possibly
make a final recommendation to the county Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   "The county should not be rushing to approve this project given
this extraordinary new finding that a contaminant found in high
concentrations at the Santa Susana property has now been found in
ground water at Ahmanson," said Daniel Hirsch, president of the
environmental group Bridge the Gap. "If perchlorate has migrated from
Rocketdyne, there is the potential for a lot of other contaminants to
migrate, including radioactivity, and that should not be swept under
the rug."</TE>
<TE>   Perchlorate is the latest in a series of setbacks for Ahmanson
owner Washington Mutual, which wants to build a $2-billion golf
course community on the ranch of majestic oaks and sweeping
grasslands. It is the largest remaining privately owned parcel of
open space separating the San Fernando Valley and Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the rare California red-legged frog and San Fernando
Valley spine flower were discovered on the property, delaying
construction. Los Angeles County politicians, including Los Angeles
Mayor James K. Hahn, have spoken out against the project, decrying
its traffic impacts on their side of the county line.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, former Vice President Al Gore called Ventura
County Supervisor John K. Flynn and pleaded with him to block a
procedural move to speed up review of the development.</TE>

<LD>Two animal rights groups on Tuesday asked the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service to list the Anacapa deer mouse as an endangered species and
immediately halt a rat eradication program underway on Anacapa
Island.</LD>
<LD>   The Fund for Animals and the Channel Islands Animal Protection
Assn. filed an emergency petition, saying the poisoning of black rats
was wiping out the indigenous island deer mouse.</LD>
<LD>   The National Park Service began poisoning black rats last year to
prevent the rodents from feeding on the eggs of endangered seabirds.
The rats also eat deer mice, park officials said.</LD>
<TE>   But Michael Makarian, president of the New York-based Fund for
Animals, said the Park Service was causing an "ecological disaster"
with its poisoning campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The Fish and Wildlife Service has 90 days to make a decision.</TE>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A coalition of environmental groups sued the Bush administration here
Tuesday to shut down nearly all commercial farming at a pair of
wildlife refuges in the Klamath Basin.</LD>
<LD>   The 10 conservation groups say federal officials have favored
agriculture over the needs of migratory birds that make the two
refuges on the Oregon-California border an important stop along the
Pacific Flyway. About 20,000 acres of crops -- potatoes, onions and
grains -- are grown on land that farmers lease on the refuges.</LD>
<LD>   Federal officials declined to comment until they review the
litigation. Dan Keppen of the Klamath Water Users Assn. said this is
just the latest in a series of attempts to kill off Klamath Basin
agriculture so more water can go to wildlife and endangered fish in
the Klamath River.</LD>

<HD>Trash a Bone of Contention in Secession Fight</HD>
<DH>Hahn says Valley would send its refuse to South- Central
L.A. transfer station. Supporters of breakup accuse mayor of using
scare tactics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the election one week away, the debate over San Fernando Valley
secession turned Tuesday to trash talk, literally and figuratively.</LD>
<LD>   While secession leaders accused the other side of ethical lapses,
Mayor James K. Hahn said a breakup could lead to creation of a trash
transfer station in South-Central Los Angeles to handle Valley
refuse.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn also announced that he opposes plans to expand Bradley
Landfill in Sun Valley, which has become a hot-button issue for
northeast Valley residents.</LD>
<TE>   "When people start talking about bringing trash to your
neighborhood and people start saying, 'We're going to take money away
from the city treasury,' which is going to hurt our ability to
provide services to all of you, it is going to affect you," Hahn said
during a campaign appearance at Central Avenue Jazz Park in
South-Central. "It is your business."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said a provision of the environmental impact report on Valley
cityhood, approved by the Local Agency Formation Commission, raised
the possibility that the Valley could truck its trash to central Los
Angeles, where it would be placed on trains for hauling to remote
desert landfills.</TE>
<TE>   "The new Valley city shall pursue the development of a transfer
station in the central Los Angeles area that will allow the new
Valley city access to desert rail-haul disposal facilities," the
LAFCO report says.</TE>
<TE>   Secession leader Carlos Ferreyra said the LAFCO language only
represented an option and the Valley would never try to put a trash
transfer station in a central Los Angeles neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no need to build it there," Ferreyra said. He said a
Valley city could instead transfer excess trash to rail cars in an
industrial area of the port.</TE>
<TE>   Ferreyra accused Hahn of misleading South-Central residents. "It
just goes along with his tactic all along to scare the public," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   At the same South-Central event, Hahn also announced his
opposition to a request by Waste Management Corp. to raise the height
of the Bradley Landfill in Sun Valley by 43 feet.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't need a trash mountain there that is four stories high,"
Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists have long sought to close that landfill and others
in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, Ferreyra and other secession proponents questioned
the propriety of a $5,000 campaign contribution to the anti-secession
side from the Ferraro Officeholder Committee, a political account
maintained by former City Council President John Ferraro until his
death last year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unethical," said Ferreyra. "The poor man is dead. We don't
know what side he would have taken."</TE>
<TE>   Ferraro was an outspoken opponent of secession, but it was unclear
who authorized dipping into the account to contribute to an
anti-secession campaign committee set up by Councilmen Eric Garcetti
and Tom LaBonge.</TE>
<TE>   LaBonge, a former aide to Ferraro, said the decision was made by
another former Ferraro aide, Pat Gobler, who now controls the fund.
"John would want to help," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ethics Commission Executive Director LeeAnn Pelham said there is
no prohibition on such contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Hahn's $5.5-million campaign released a new television
ad Tuesday that is more positive than previous anti-secession
commercials.</TE>
<TE>   The new ad shows an idyllic montage of couples and families
picnicking in city parks, window-shopping on bustling city streets
and hiking in the hills in view of the Hollywood sign.</TE>
<TE>   Over the visuals, and with a soft, sentimental piano
accompaniment, a narrator says, "We came here from all across America
and the world. We grew up here and can never imagine leaving.... We
all know that in Los Angeles dreams really do come true. Split apart,
who are we? Don't let politics destroy this special place.... "</TE>
<TE>   With little money to counter Hahn's ad blitz, the secessionists
stepped up their ground campaigns Tuesday, sending volunteers door to
door in the Valley and Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood secession leader Gene La Pietra said Tuesday his
campaign is also sending out mailers and working phone banks.</TE>
<TE>   "If you live in Hollywood, you'll see us," La Pietra said.</TE>

<HD>Tap Water Poses Risks, Study Says</HD>
<DH>The report on 19 California cities, including L.A., urges
more treatment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Miguel Bustillo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The water that residents of California's largest cities get from
their taps might meet most government safety standards, but it still
poses some health risks and needs to be treated more thoroughly,
according to a study scheduled to be released today by an
environmental organization.</LD>
<LD>   The report by the Natural Resources Defense Council, titled
"What's on Tap," concluded that antiquated waterworks and pollution
are combining to affect the quality of drinking water residents
receive in many cities, including Los Angeles and San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   Though many urban residents can drink tap water without serious
threats to their health, the study concluded that some contaminants
still pose a risk, especially to infants, pregnant women, and people
with AIDS or other immune system deficiencies. In Fresno, the study
found, the risk may be substantial.</LD>
<TE>   The study concluded that pollution from farm and industrial
sources was a health concern, particularly for children and pregnant
women. Fresno water showed "repeated problems" with nitrates,
pesticides and industrial chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   The findings were the result of a national review of tap water
data from 19 cities, but the group is only releasing the California
results now -- a decision, it says, that is tied to the timing of
Proposition 50, a ballot measure that would authorize funds to
improve water treatment. Voters next Tuesday will decide the
measure's fate.</TE>
<TE>   "There are still significant risks from contaminants," said
Natural Resources Defense Council senior attorney Erik Olson, one of
the study's authors. "The other issue is that because of
deteriorating infrastructure, and the need to improve pipes
underground, things are likely to get worse unless significant
improvements are made.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like someone that hasn't brushed their teeth in years," he
added, laughing. "It may be hidden for a while, but eventually it's
going to catch up with you."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles received generally fair marks in the report, though it
cited noteworthy amounts of arsenic and byproducts of disinfectants
in the water supply, among other chemicals. The amounts were all
within federal standards. The city received good marks for its annual
"right to know" tap water reports to the public.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego got a similar grade, though the study noted that in some
areas the chemical perchlorate was present in levels higher than a
new state standard for government action. And San Francisco received
a more critical assessment, which noted that city water does not meet
a new standard for byproducts of disinfection known as
trihalomethanes that have been linked to cancer. The city has
obtained an extension to meet the standards.</TE>

<HD>11th District Race Is Hard to Ignore</HD>
<DH>One hopeful hands out phony $1-million bills; another
campaigns with a wooden pushcart.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>George Ramos</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a recent morning at the Krispy Kreme doughnut shop on Van Nuys
Boulevard, nearly all the patrons said the San Fernando Valley should
break away from the city of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   "Of course," exclaimed Julia Simmons, 27, of Van Nuys, echoing the
prevailing view. "I'm tired of getting our chain yanked by downtown
L.A. It's time we become our own city."</LD>
<LD>   "Yeah, it's time," agreed her friend, Tom Morris, 26, of Canoga
Park.</LD>
<TE>   But when it came to ticking off the names of the four candidates
running for a Van Nuys seat on the proposed Valley city council, or
even identifying the issues debated in the 11th district campaign,
none of those queried at the doughnut shop could do it.</TE>
<TE>   "Sorry," Morris shrugged.</TE>
<TE>   That's the problem facing the four men who hope to represent the
11th district: Many residents don't seem to be paying attention to
the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The district, which is mostly east of the San Diego Freeway, is a
largely Latino, working-class area of apartment dwellers.</TE>
<TE>   No Latino is seeking the seat, but the four candidates are diverse
in ways that leave some voters shaking their heads in amazement. One
candidate, "Jamie" Cordaro, hands out phony $1-million bills to
illustrate the point that the tax revenues the Valley contributes to
Los Angeles should be spent locally. Another, Hal Netkin, has built a
wooden pushcart that he uses to pass out campaign literature and
carry water so voters can have a "drink" with him.</TE>
<TE>   A third candidate refuses to use the word "secession" because it
conjures up the Civil War. Noel DeGaetano prefers the word
"detachment."</TE>
<TE>   And the fourth hopeful, TV and movie executive John Quinn, has
made videos for Playboy.</TE>
<TE>   The winning candidate will take office if voters approve Valley
secession.</TE>
<TE>   The four agree that the city has not done enough to revitalize Van
Nuys Boulevard, the district's main thoroughfare, where some
deteriorating buildings have been vacant since the 1994 Northridge
earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   The city of Los Angeles "has failed miserably to help us," said
Cordaro, 46, who may be the best-known entry. He finished third, with
just under 10% of the vote, in last year's primary to replace Joel
Wachs on the Los Angeles City Council. Wendy Greuel eventually won
the seat.</TE>
<TE>   "We ought to be spending money within our own borders," said
Cordaro, an electrical contractor whose mock $1-million bills bear
his picture.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn, 54, whose film credits include 1995's "Goldy: The Magic of
the Golden Bear" and 1987's "Cheerleader Champ," says Van Nuys
Boulevard's revitalization is "the first thing I would work on."</TE>
<TE>   "It's the heart of the Valley," said Quinn, who has volunteered
for Guide Dogs of America, the American Red Cross and the Sierra
Club.</TE>
<TE>   DeGaetano, a 59-year-old Realtor, is a low-key campaigner who says
"detachment" is the opposite of the process Los Angeles used to annex
the Valley in 1915.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not the Confederacy," he said. "The people on the other
side of the [Santa Monica] mountains aren't the enemy. We have to

<TE>   DeGaetano, a Republican, lost a 1994 Assembly race to

<TE>   Netkin, 66, is campaigning on quality-of-life issues. On a recent
afternoon, he proudly showed off the cart he was building to carry
literature and a water cooler.</TE>
<TE>   Netkin, who speaks Spanish, rails against day laborers and
unlicensed street vendors on Van Nuys Boulevard. He says the vendors
might be selling contaminated food, and the laborers cause traffic
problems and give the boulevard a shabby look.</TE>
<TE>   Reminded that his wife was once an illegal immigrant from Mexico,
like many of the vendors and laborers, Netkin had a ready answer.
"You think I'm a hypocrite? But I'm not," he said. "I'm not against
those people. I'm against the politicians, who let that stuff go on."</TE>

<HD>L.A. Zoo Changing Its Stripes</HD>
<DH>New entrance is latest step in long-term project that
includes more naturalistic exhibits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patricia Ward Biederman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The old entrance to the Los Angeles Zoo has disappeared behind a
construction fence and visitors now buy their tickets near a
zebra-striped tent in the parking lot.</LD>
<LD>   The bridge linking the parking lot and the entrance will be torn
down and visitors will use a new yellow-painted path instead.</LD>
<LD>   A ceremony today marks the official start of construction on the
zoo's new entrance, the next step in a long-term plan to modernize
the Griffith Park facility that will result in naturalistic exhibits
for its elephants, gorillas and other animals.</LD>
<TE>   The ambitious building program is needed, said acting zoo director
Ed Maruska, "to bring the zoo into the 21st century.... This is a
major city, and it deserves a major, first-class zoo. L.A. is good
zoo, but it's not a great zoo and it should be, and part of what
makes a great zoo is cutting-edge exhibits.''</TE>
<TE>   The 35-year-old zoo has come a long way since the mid-1990s when
the American Zoo and Aquarium Assn. delayed its accreditation because
of outmoded animal facilities and other ills.</TE>
<TE>   Maruska, then head of the Cincinnati Zoo, was one of three experts
brought in to evaluate the zoo and recommend improvements, including
its administration, many of which have been made.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the zoo has unveiled a new children's zoo; more
natural-looking, animal-friendly exhibits for its chimps and
orangutans; and a new veterinary health facility.</TE>
<TE>   According to zoo planning and development director Bill Lukehart,
the next step in the modernization plan is the nine-acre entrance
complex. Airy, steel gates will lead into the complex, which will
include a children's discovery center and Sea Lion Cliffs, a new
saltwater exhibit for the zoo's five sea lions and three new harbor
seals.</TE>
<TE>   The entrance complex will cost about $26 million, much of it from
city bond measures passed in 1998, and will open in mid-2004,
Lukehart said.</TE>
<TE>   Other new exhibits are to follow. In April 2003, ground will be
broken for Pachyderm Forest, a landscaped exhibit with a deep pool
for the elephants that will resemble a village in Thailand. It will
also provide a new home for the zoo's hippos, including an area
where, through a glass window, visitors can view the hippos swimming
underwater.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, construction will begin on Campo Gorilla
Reserve, a naturalistic home for the zoo's gorillas and guenons, a
species of monkey.</TE>
<TE>   Both the elephant and gorilla exhibits, due to open in late 2004,
will cost about $20 million, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Next, work will begin on the Rain Forest of the Americas and
Reptile &amp; Insect House, which are to open in mid-2005 at a combined
cost of some $25 million.</TE>
<TE>   "The design concept in all these exhibits is immersion," said
Lukehart, explaining that visitors will experience sights, sounds and
smells that suggest a distinctive environment appropriate to the
animals on display.</TE>
<TE>   The days are over, he said, when a zoo visitor looks down on a
captive animal in a pit.</TE>
<TE>   "The animals and the visitors are on equal footing," said
Lukehart, who described the planned exhibits as respectful toward the
animals.</TE>
<TE>   Maruska, a consultant to the rain forest exhibit, agrees with that
approach.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have a moral responsibility to the animals if we're
going to confine them," he said "We ought to give them the best we
can."</TE>

<HD>The New Age of the Grown-Ups</HD>
<DH>The white-haired set has been recruited to roam the
corridors of power in politics and business. Some see it as a
response to crisis and scandals.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In the Kennedy era, there was the youth of Camelot. In the
Clinton-Gore years, there was the arrival of the baby boomers. Now,
Washington seems to be summoning the white hairs back to duty.</LD>
<LD>   Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, at 74, is being asked to
pinch-hit for the late Democratic Sen. Paul Wellstone in Minnesota.
After an acrimonious fight, the Securities and Exchange Commission
has named 78-year-old William H. Webster, a former CIA and FBI
director with virtually no experience in accounting, to be its new
accounting czar. And then there's Frank R. Lautenberg, former
Democratic senator from New Jersey, who left the Senate two years ago
because he was tired of raising campaign cash and who now, at 78, is
stumping with vigor in a race that Sen. Robert Torricelli left in a
cloud of corruption.</LD>
<TE>   Not to be outdone, the Bush administration has installed Donald H.
Rumsfeld at the Pentagon, where his regular jousts with the media led
the president to call his secretary of Defense, at 70, a matinee
idol. Congress has always had a platoon of elderly -- Strom Thurmond,
the South Carolina Republican who is already the oldest and the
longest-serving senator in history, turns 100 in December. But
Thurmond, who is not seeking reelection this year, is hardly a
player. As the Senate has debated the wrenching question of whether
to authorize war with Iraq, however, the Democrat who became the most
vigorous, passionate opponent was not some young energetic defender
of left-wing causes. It was Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), known at
85 as ''Bobby.''</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, Washington has often turned to its elder statesmen,
especially in times of crisis. And coincidence could explain the new
look of longevity.</TE>
<TE>   But there seems something poignant about the current outreach to
veterans, as if the times yearn for the stability of a more sober
generation. To demographers, lobbyists and other experts, the aging
of government seems a response to danger.</TE>
<TE>   "In times of crisis, the impulse is to go with someone who's been
there and can offer the reassuring voice of experience," said John
Rother, policy director of the AARP, a lobby group serving 35.5
million of the plus-50 crowd. "It's rooted in human nature."</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Kellerman, executive director of Harvard University's
Kennedy School Center for Public Leadership, echoed the thought.
"Since Sept. 11 the nation has been on edge," she said. "We want to
be soothed, to feel more secure." Noting that corporations and the
Roman Catholic Church have also reached out to retired elders to
salve their scandals, she added, ''This is a nervous time. This is
not a good moment for a long learning curve. We want to have a sense
of competence. And one way of assuring that is to choose people
who've been there before.''</TE>
<TE>   Others see a generational schism in the new Potomac fashion of
showing one's age, wrinkles and all. For some, there is a hint that
boomer presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush have disappointed,
requiring the parent generation to come back and clean up the mess.
And there is speculation that the return of the elders constitutes
some sort of repudiation of the 20-somethings, with their dotcom
bubbles and their go-go '90s bust.</TE>
<TE>   "It's true, there is a sense that the kids had a tantrum and the
adults are coming in to quell the disturbance," said Ross Baker,
political scientist at Rutgers University. "The grown-ups are coming
back."</TE>
<TE>   The baby boomers -- those 70 million Americans born in the
population explosion after World War II -- are graying themselves,
with the oldest of them now 56, so the prospect of ever-older leaders
looms as far as the horizon. "When the baby boomers were younger,
they didn't trust anybody over 35," said Kenneth Johnson, a
demographer at Loyola University in Chicago. "Maybe older politicians
are starting to look better to them."</TE>
<TE>   Then too, the aging of the population in general -- one in every
eight Americans is over 65, according to the 2000 census -- makes all
but inevitable the graying of the workplace.</TE>
<TE>   "We no longer talk about the prime of life ending at 65," said
M.C. "Terry" Hokenstad, professor of social sciences at Case Western
Reserve University in Cleveland. "The prime of life extends into the
70s and beyond."</TE>
<TE>   Hokenstad credits Otto von Bismarck, Germany's first chancellor,
for setting the retirement age for pensioners at 65, a benchmark
American lawmakers borrowed when they designed the Social Security
Act in 1935. "There is a story, perhaps apocryphal, that Bismarck
chose 65 because the average German worker lived until 47," said
Hokenstad. True or not, he added, "65 is a social artifact. It may
have had meaning in the industrial age, but no more."</TE>
<TE>   In New Jersey and Minnesota, the short lead time before election
day likely dictated selecting a brand-name politician, someone voters
would want to embrace without a long campaign courtship. Especially
in Minnesota, where Democrats are still grieving the loss of
Wellstone, his wife, daughter and key aides, the need for a
reassuring elder was paramount. And Webster's appointment was clearly
meant to muffle suggestions that the SEC was not really committed to
cleaning up corporate accounting scandals. Reluctant to name John
Biggs, head of a large New York-based pension fund, as potentially
too aggressive, the SEC could not afford to look like a bunch of
patsies. Webster's reputation made him unassailable as a compromise
candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. David R. Obey (D-Wis.) applauds the coming of the elders on
other grounds. "I think politics always needs adult supervision," he
said, adding of Mondale, "He's an adult."</TE>
<TE>   One upside for parties selecting seniors as their standard bearers
is that the media and the public tend to give them a pass on too
rigorous an examination of their resumes. They are, after all, being
summoned to serve.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been away from the fray for so long, their reputations
have been rehabilitated," Edward Turzanski, a political scientist at
La Salle University in Philadelphia, said. "There's a certain
nostalgia or a political glossing over of the problems they've had in
the past. The more distant they become, the kinder our memory."</TE>
<TE>   Some question whether the play to age demonstrates a weak bench.
Robin Gerber, who specializes in women's leadership issues at the
University of Maryland, sighs when asked about the tapping of elder
statesmen.</TE>
<TE>   "We talk about how far we've come, but in truth, woman still only
have 13% of the U.S. Congress and five governorships," said Gerber,
whose recent book, "Leadership the Eleanor Roosevelt Way," seeks to
impart lessons learned from a prominent political player. "If we were
really making good on the promise of the women's movement, we should
have a richer pool. There are no elder women."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone sees a trend. Washington lawyer Robert Strauss, at 84
still one of the great rainmakers of the Democratic Party, attributes
the recent spate of late-in-life appointments to "strange
circumstances." He thinks Mondale was bored in retirement, and is
probably delighted to be back in the arena. Philip Klinkner, 39, a
government professor at Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y., cautions
against making too much of age as an asset.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't help Bob Dole," he notes of the GOP presidential
candidate who, at 73, was handily defeated by President Clinton in
1996.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he says, his wife and mother-in-law "swoon over Donald
Rumsfeld," and he himself wonders how long it will be before
California Republicans, eager for victory, dump Bill Simon Jr. from
Tuesday's gubernatorial ballot and put Ronald Reagan's name, with its
enduring electoral magic, on the ballot.</TE>

<HD>For Both Parties, a Time to Dream of What Could Be</HD>
<DH>Republicans hope for undivided control of Congress.
Democrats want to retake the House. Each has an ambitious agenda.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Anderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON--With midterm elections less than a week away, the
nation's capital is a city of dreamers.</LD>
<LD>   Republicans yearn to recover what they suddenly lost last year
when a single senator quit the party: undivided control of Congress,
to complement the GOP's hold on the White House.</LD>
<LD>   Democrats, with a tenuous grip on the Senate, hope to overcome
difficult odds and capture the House for the first time in eight
years.</LD>
<TE>   Whichever party triumphs in the House and Senate elections, their
majority margins are likely to be narrow, but the policy consequences
will be huge. A Republican Congress would mobilize behind President
Bush's conservative agenda if he seeks reelection in 2004. A
Democratic Congress would unleash liberal legislative voices stymied
for eight years and could throw Bush onto the defensive.</TE>
<TE>   A divided Congress presumably would mean further stalemate that
would leave both parties pointing fingers of blame and major disputes
unresolved. Among them: Should Congress extend, accelerate or freeze
tax cuts scheduled to expire in eight years? Should Social Security
be overhauled? How much should the government prod domestic energy
production? To what extent should the government help lower
prescription drug prices or guarantee new rights to medical patients?
Should the rules for immigration change?</TE>
<TE>   If Republicans control both chambers, they will be able to pick up
where they left off when Sen. James M. Jeffords of Vermont became an
independent and tipped the Senate into Democratic hands.</TE>
<TE>   That would mean a push to make permanent, or even accelerate,
parts of the $1.35-trillion tax cut enacted last year during the four
months when the GOP controlled both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.
Currently, the tax cut is to expire at the end of 2010.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans want to make permanent what is now a temporary repeal
of the estate tax--an idea that appeals to some centrist
Democrats--and lock in reductions in individual income tax rates,
cuts for married couples and various education-related and
retirement-savings tax breaks.</TE>
<TE>   Lately, Republicans have also talked about reducing taxes for
stockholders whose portfolios have been battered by the market's
plunge.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas E. Mann, an analyst at the Brookings Institution, calls tax
policy "a big mega-question" facing the next Congress.</TE>
<TE>   A Republican Congress also would give new momentum to stalled Bush
initiatives to allow oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge, create a Department of Homeland Security with strong
management authority and bolster government cooperation with
faith-based charities.</TE>
<TE>   A Republican Senate, in particular, would give the administration
enormous leverage on judicial and executive nominations. Stalled Bush
picks for the federal bench--including two rejected this year by the
Democratic-led Judiciary Committee--would get new life.</TE>
<TE>   Ideological battles expected over Supreme Court vacancies in the
second half of Bush's term also would be deeply influenced. The
nine-member high court would seem due for a change; the last justice
confirmed was Stephen G. Breyer in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   People for the American Way, a liberal group that has opposed
Bush's judicial nominations, contends that a GOP-led Senate "could
guarantee a Supreme Court controlled by the far right for decades."</TE>
<TE>   While Democrats and their allies raise such alarms about the
prospect of GOP dominance in Washington, Republicans deride the
status quo -- a Congress so deadlocked that it has failed this year
to pass a federal budget.</TE>
<TE>   "Give us a chance," said Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the
anticipated majority leader in a GOP Senate. "Let us have the
Congress and the presidency working together and see if we can
produce."</TE>
<TE>   Lott said his first move would be to call for votes on more than
80 stalled nominations, including the nomination of a judge from his
home state to an appellate court. That nominee, Judge Charles
Pickering, was rejected by Senate Judiciary Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a closing campaign blitz by Bush himself, it is entirely
possible that voters will keep Congress just as it is. It is also
conceivable that Republicans could lose their slim House majority.
The GOP now holds 223 of 435 House seats; meaning a loss of just six
seats would cost the party its majority.</TE>
<TE>   If Democrats gain the House--no matter who wins the Senate--they
would be able to move onto the legislative offensive with a rap of
the speaker's gavel.</TE>
<TE>   Leading House Democrats envision a new push to raise the minimum
wage, extend unemployment benefits, enforce environmental
regulations, reform pension systems and stimulate the economy through
a one-time, $200-billion package of spending and tax cuts for
working-class families and businesses.</TE>
<TE>   They also have proposed an amnesty program for illegal immigrants
who have lived for some years in the United States, held jobs and
passed a background check.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Democrats now control the Senate, they have had
trouble forcing votes on such issues because the chamber's rules
require a three-fifths majority--60 votes--to shut down debate.</TE>
<TE>   In the House, by contrast, rules allow a simple majority to call
up legislation and force votes. A disciplined GOP majority has used
those rules to great effect in the past two years, passing bill after
bill. Having a Democratic speaker would significantly help the party
in its quest to define an opposition agenda, and could lead to more
Democratic bills clearing Congress. That, in turn, might spur Bush to
use his veto power for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   "You could have a one-vote majority and still have the ability to
bring up your agenda," said Rep. Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), the
minority leader. That, he said, is "the ultimate power in the House."</TE>
<TE>   Gephardt called the Democrats' loss of House control in the 1994
elections one of the saddest moments in his life.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, he has struggled to bring his party back, coming close
in 1998 and 2000 as Democrats chipped away at the GOP majority.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a stable of liberal Democratic veterans is itching to
take over House committees. They include Reps. John Conyers Jr. of
Michigan, would-be chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Charles B.
Rangel of New York on Ways and Means, David R. Obey of Wisconsin on
Appropriations and Henry A. Waxman of Los Angeles on Government
Reform, a prime investigative post.</TE>
<TE>   Waxman said his top priorities would include expanding health
insurance coverage and fighting global warming.</TE>

<HD>From Ice Cream to Sows to Health Care</HD>
<DH>A myriad of measures are on ballots nationwide Tuesday.
Many are pet causes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephanie Simon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Should pregnant sows have more room to wallow?</LD>
<LD>   Should voters be able to register on election day?</LD>
<LD>   Should shoppers be told if their ice cream contains genetically
altered soy?</LD>
<TE>   Voters will answer these and 199 other questions Tuesday as they
sort through state ballot measures large and small.</TE>
<TE>   Missouri voters will have a chance to quadruple their cigarette
tax, to 72 cents a pack. South Dakotans will have a shot at
legalizing industrial hemp. Tennessee could get a state lottery.
Oklahoma might ban cockfighting. Colorado and Massachusetts could
eliminate bilingual education in favor of a strict English immersion
curriculum.</TE>
<TE>   And in Nevada, voters could make it legal to carry marijuana for
personal use. The way the referendum is worded, it would let most
adults possess up to 250 marijuana cigarettes. That has not won many
fans in law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time I've seen anyone with a larger quantity than just a few
cigarettes, it's been a trafficking situation," said Las Vegas Metro
Police Sgt. Rick Barela.</TE>
<TE>   The most ambitious initiatives will be on the ballot in Oregon. A
campaign to raise the minimum wage to $6.90 an hour, well above the
national minimum of $5.15, looks likely to succeed. An effort to
require labels on all products containing genetically engineered
ingredients is on shakier ground, as biotech firms and other
opponents have poured more than $4.5 million into trying to defeat
the measure.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the hotly contested drive to mandate universal health
insurance. Measure 23 would ensure that every Oregon resident have
full coverage, including dental and vision insurance, long-term
nursing care and access to mental health treatment. It would be
funded by two new taxes: one on personal income and one on employers'
payrolls. A poll this month suggested that the measure probably would
fail.</TE>
<TE>   With so many fierce political races across the nation, ballot
measures in many states have been receiving limited attention. The
majority of them are rather dull -- bond issues, election reform,
deletion of obsolete statutes from state constitutions. But the 202
measures facing voters in 40 states include several dozen initiatives
placed on the ballot by citizens determined to put their pet causes
to the ultimate test: democracy.</TE>
<TE>   Many of these activists don't have the money to do much more than
put up a Web site and hand out brochures, perhaps buy a few newspaper
ads. Still, whether they're fighting to free pregnant sows from cages
in Florida, to allow same-day voter registration in California or to
reinstate term limits in Idaho, activists of all stripes promote
their causes with passion.</TE>
<TE>   Agricultural Commissioner Roger Johnson is one of a few Democrats
in statewide office in North Dakota. He's also fighting with all he
has for an unusual initiative: To pay up to $10,000 to a college
graduate who agrees to stick around.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson says about 65% of North Dakota's college graduates leave
the state for bigger, more lively (and, no doubt, warmer) regions.
The state is rated first in the U.S. in high school graduation, first
in college matriculation and 34th for the percentage of the
population with a college degree.</TE>
<TE>   "After they get the degree, they leave," he said.</TE>
<TE>   To keep them, Johnson wants the state to forgive up to $5,000 in
student loans and offer a tax credit of up to $5,000 over five years.
He estimates it will cost North Dakota about $17 million a year, out
of a $2-billion annual budget. Many Republicans say that's just too
expensive.</TE>
<TE>   "You can bury your head in the sand as long as you want," Johnson
said, "but our young people keep moving away."</TE>

<HD>Administration Directs Panel to Study Embryo Protections</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Aaron Zitner</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration has directed an advisory panel to study what
protections are offered to embryos and fetuses in medical
experiments, renewing criticism that federal officials may be using
"backdoor" methods to provide a legal groundwork for curtailing
abortion rights and embryonic stem-cell research.</LD>
<LD>   The directive is included in the charter of a new panel that will
advise the Department of Health and Human Services on "human research
protections" -- the rules that ensure that medical researchers do not
abuse individuals who participate in experiments.</LD>
<LD>   Department officials said they intended to make sure that the
panel took a complete look at protections for pregnant women in
research. Issues related to abortion and stem-cell research did not
arise as they wrote the new charter, they said.</LD>
<TE>   But people on both sides of the abortion debate said that the
directive in fact stated that embryos were "human subjects" in the
context of medical experiments. Advocates for research that uses
embryos said it appeared to be at least the second recent example of
the administration seeking to elevate the legal and moral status of
the embryo, which they said in time could weaken the right to choose
abortion or to experiment with embryos.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the administration announced that unborn
children were eligible for certain government health benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, a fertilized egg is not the same thing as a patient or
person in research, and should not be treated that way,'' said Sean
Tipton, spokesman for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine,
which represents fertility doctors. "Certainly there are political
actors who are looking to establish a precedent that an embryo is the
equivalent of a human being, and this fits right into that agenda."</TE>
<TE>   "They're trying to make a political statement here," Anthony
Mazzaschi of the Assn. of American Medical Colleges said of the
administration. "This has the potential to be a backdoor effort to
affect policy on stem-cell and cloning research."</TE>
<TE>   Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the National Right to
Life Committee, said: "We applaud the administration for explicitly
recognizing in the charter that the term 'human subjects' includes
all living members of the species Homo sapiens at every stage of
development, and that all deserve protection from unethical
experimentation."</TE>
<TE>   He said the language was consistent with several measures passed
by Congress, including one that bans federal funds for research that
harms embryos. "If you're going to write a charter for a new panel,
it would be remarkable if it didn't reflect those congressional
enactments," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The panel is called the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Human
Research Protections. Its members have not been named. The panel
replaces one convened in the Clinton years whose charter had expired.</TE>
<TE>   Federal health officials are not obligated to follow the panel's
advice. Still, its recommendations could affect all federally funded
research.</TE>
<TE>   While private-sector research would generally not be included in
the panel's deliberations, an official with HHS said it could affect
some private research conducted to win Food and Drug Administration
approvals for drugs or medical devices.</TE>
<TE>   Arthur J. Lawrence, deputy assistant secretary for health
operations and assistant surgeon general at HHS, said it was
"plausible" that the advisory committee could read its charter to
allow it to debate embryonic stem-cell research.</TE>
<TE>   "The intent was to be sure that as more women come into the
research subject population, that if they are pregnant the effects of
the research are considered in light of not only the woman but
potential effects on the fetus or embryo," Lawrence said. "The
objective was to say, 'You can't ignore the fetus or embryo when
thinking of a pregnant woman.' "</TE>

<HD>Bush Aides Admit Being Behind on Review of Cheney Documents</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Seven days before a court-imposed deadline, the Bush administration
said Tuesday that it has fully reviewed only two out of 12 boxes of
documents at issue in lawsuits over Vice President Dick Cheney's
energy task force.</LD>
<LD>   In a three-page court filing, the administration said it also is
sorting through 10,000 e-mails to find several thousand messages
about the Cheney panel. Two private groups -- the Sierra Club and the
conservative group Judicial Watch -- are suing because the Bush
administration refuses to release any documents on the energy plan it
drafted last year.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan gave the White House until
Tuesday to either release the documents or compile a list identifying
each document that it contends should remain confidential.</LD>
<TE>   The judge said on Oct. 17 that he was shocked to hear from the
government that it had not yet examined all the documents. It was not
clear until Tuesday precisely how much material was at issue in the
case.</TE>

<HD>'Early Voting' Puts Turnout Push to Test</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Anderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>As the political parties gear up for election day, they confront a
new challenge in the age-old task of spurring turnout: more voters in
more states are casting ballots ahead of time.</LD>
<LD>   By the time polls open Tuesday, millions of votes will already be
cast. Though no precise nationwide figures are available, such votes
are expected to be a substantial portion of the overall turnout --
perhaps 15%.</LD>
<LD>   In California, which has given the phenomenon a push through a new
law encouraging "permanent absentee" voting, more than a quarter of
the votes counted are expected to be from absentees.</LD>
<TE>   In Arizona, Colorado, Texas and Florida, all states with
competitive elections, "early voting" -- in which ballots are cast
ahead of time by mail or at polling stations in such places as
supermarkets, libraries or government centers -- is becoming ever
more popular.</TE>
<TE>   The rate of early voting in the 15 largest counties in Texas has
nearly doubled in the last four years, preliminary data show. An
Arizona election official estimates 4 of every 10 ballots will be
cast before Tuesday. A report in Florida, scene of the 2000
presidential election debacle, indicated that some voters want to
cast ballots in advance to make sure their votes are counted.</TE>
<TE>   "It's probably right now the most significant trend in American
elections," said Doug Lewis, executive director of the nonpartisan
Election Center, based in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   The rise of advance voting is a critical factor as the two parties
attempt to rev up loyalist turnout in a political landscape nearly
evenly split between Republicans and Democrats. Already, the parties
are bickering over turnout and voting procedure in a battle likely to
intensify in coming days.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats are accusing the GOP of seeking to intimidate early
voters in Arkansas through improper demands for voter identification.
Republicans accuse Democrats of using questionable tactics to
register Native American voters in South Dakota, as authorities probe
allegations of tainted registration cards and ballot requests.</TE>
<TE>   Such maneuvering could prove significant in elections that may be
decided by small margins of votes. The two parties, mindful of the
2000 election problems in Florida, are also readying teams of lawyers
to pounce on any postelection irregularities or recounts that may
emerge.</TE>
<TE>   Amid these controversies, the federal government is taking steps
to clean up elections.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, President Bush signed legislation meant to help fix
flaws in voting systems exposed by the Florida recount. The law,
which won overwhelming approval in Congress, will authorize more than
$3.8 billion in federal aid over three years to state and local
election officials. It also requires a host of new measures meant to
improve access to voting, increase accuracy of vote counting and
deter election fraud.</TE>
<TE>   "Through these reforms, the federal government will help state and
local officials to conduct elections that have the confidence of all
Americans," Bush said as he signed the bill.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats, while supporting the new law, accused the president of
standing by while the GOP uses tactics, such as identification
requests and fraud allegations, that seek to intimidate voters.</TE>
<TE>   "If [Bush] truly believes in voting rights, he should call on the
members of his party to put an end to their systematic effort to
suppress voter turnout," said Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the
Democratic National Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Dyke, a Republican National Committee spokesman, called the
charge "asinine."</TE>
<TE>   The partisan fight over turnout is complicated by the growing
tendency of voters to cast ballots in advance. It is harder to rally
your own troops and deflect those of your opponents when election day
is being steadily transformed into election month.</TE>
<TE>   It is also harder to determine when to launch a campaign
advertisement for maximum effect.</TE>
<TE>   Data compiled last year by the National Conference of State
Legislatures show that 28 of 49 states allow early voting (not
counted was Oregon, where all voting is by mail). The trend gained
steam in the 1990s, experts say, as voters sought ways to cast votes
on their own schedule, rather than limiting themselves to the first
Tuesday in November.</TE>
<TE>   In California, the use of mail-in absentee ballots has risen
steadily over the last several years, from 15% of the electorate in
1990 to 26% in the March primary. This fall, voters could begin
requesting and casting their ballots on Oct. 7.</TE>
<TE>   An important development in this election year is a new state law
expected to simplify -- and perhaps expand -- absentee voting. Under
the law, all voters are eligible to request "permanent absentee"
status, meaning they will no longer be required to submit absentee
applications before every election. Before, such privileges were
limited to voters with disabilities or other special needs.</TE>
<TE>   California is one of only a handful of states with such liberal
absentee rules.</TE>

<HD>A Memorial for Wellstone Draws 20,000</HD>
<DH>Political colleagues and ordinary citizens mourn the death
of the Minnesota senator and remember his fight for social justice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Simon and Ronald Brownstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>From the political elite to the working class, more than 20,000
people gathered here Tuesday night to remember Sen. Paul Wellstone
(D-Minn.) as a man of principle and a true liberal "willing to fight
the lonely fight.'' The memorial service for Wellstone, who was
running for a third term, came as state Democratic leaders prepared
today to name former Vice President Walter F. Mondale to replace him
as the party's nominee on Tuesday's ballot.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) was the only politician who spoke,
wrapping up the service with a speech that combined fond memories of
his "best friend in the Senate" with rousing political remarks that
had the audience on their feet, pumping their fists and cheering
loudly.</LD>
<LD>   "I believe that Paul was the soul of the Senate," Harkin said.
"Sometimes he cast votes that even some of his friends disagreed
with, on war or on welfare. But when he did, he was the mirror in
which we, his colleagues, looked at ourselves and searched our own
hearts."</LD>
<TE>   At the service, which at times took on the aspects of a revival
meeting, a rock concert and a political rally, people from every walk
of life crowded into the University of Minnesota's Williams Arena.
Mourners began lining up three hours before the service. To
accommodate the overflow crowds, the service was broadcast in an
adjoining building and large video screens were set up outside.</TE>
<TE>   "Help us win this election for Paul Wellstone," said Rick Kahn, a
friend and former student of Wellstone, a onetime political science
professor, in his remarks to the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Former President Bill Clinton was there, as were former Vice
Presidents Al Gore and Mondale and more than half of the
Senate--Wellstone's liberal allies as well as his conservative foes.
Cheers rang out when Mondale, accompanied by his wife, Joan, entered
the hall, and again at the end of the service when he waved to the
crowd that included farmers, steelworkers and veterans, all part of
Wellstone's core political constituency.</TE>
<TE>   People waited for hours to enter the arena, as long lines snaked
around the block. Inside, they sat on the floor and on the steps in
the aisles. Almost everyone wore green Wellstone campaign buttons.
One Minnesotan wore an old "Mondale for President" button.</TE>
<TE>   Charlie Kundinger, 56, a home renovator from St. Paul, arrived two
hours early, only to find himself in the back of the arena without a
seat. But he said it was important for him to attend.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge loss," he said. "He was extremely well loved.''</TE>
<TE>   The White House offered to send Vice President Dick Cheney. But
Wellstone's family declined, saying they were concerned about the
security that would be required. Health and Human Services Secretary
Tommy G. Thompson represented the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   Wellstone, along with his wife, his daughter, three staff members
and two pilots, died in the crash of a small plane near Eveleth,
Minn., on Friday. At the White House, Bush paused during a bill
signing to observe a moment of silence for a "devoted public
servant."</TE>
<TE>   "Paul Wellstone was a deeply principled and good-hearted man,"
Bush said. "He'll be missed by all who knew him."</TE>
<TE>   Harkin called Wellstone a true liberal who "constantly reminded
those of us who are Democrats of the real center of gravity of our
party, the progressive ground of our being: that everyone should have
the chance to reach his or her potential in our society.''</TE>
<TE>   Recalling Wellstone's self-deprecating humor, Harkin recounted one
of his friend's favorite stories. Wellstone had just finished
speaking on the Senate floor when Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.)
approached him and said, "Young man, you remind me of Hubert
Humphrey." Wellstone swelled with pride, and then Sen. Hollings
added: "You talk too much."</TE>
<TE>   "He could partner with Ted Kennedy or Pete Domenici," Harkin said.
"He could fiercely oppose Jesse Helms' view and become Jesse Helms'
friend."</TE>
<TE>   And he added: "No one ever wore the title of senator better or
used it less. To the people of Minnesota, I say thank you for giving
Paul to the rest of the nation."</TE>
<TE>   One of Wellstone's sons, David, remembered his father as
"organizing, always organizing. He had social justice in his bones."</TE>
<TE>   Wellstone's son Mark said his father used to say, "Never separate
the lives you live from the words you speak."</TE>
<TE>   "We will carry on the fight," he said. Parked outside was the
rickety old green bus that Wellstone used during his first Senate
campaign in 1990 and that he brought out of mothballs to use again
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Wellstone's death so close to the election cast a new measure of
political drama and uncertainty over the national battle for control
of the Senate. Democrats now hold a one-seat majority, and the
outcome of the Minnesota race -- one of a handful of tight contests
around the county -- could tip the Senate to the Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   In a sign of Minnesota's importance, Bush had been expected to
campaign there Sunday for the GOP Senate nominee, Norm Coleman.</TE>
<TE>   He still may, although White House spokesman Ari Fleischer
declined Tuesday to confirm the president's travel schedule or talk
about the Minnesota race before the service for Wellstone.</TE>
<TE>   Mondale, 74, has not been on the ballot since he was swamped by
Ronald Reagan in the 1984 presidential election. He last represented
Minnesota in the Senate 26 years ago, resigning his seat when he was
elected Jimmy Carter's vice president.</TE>
<TE>   Mondale is expected to deliver a speech tonight at the
Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party meeting, visit the Wellstone campaign
headquarters Thursday, then travel around the state starting later in
the day or Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "The message will be, 'I didn't seek this but someone needs to
pick up the flag,' " said a Democratic Party source. "The speech will
be very closely connecting himself with Paul and his legacy."</TE>
<TE>   Beth Elizabeth Popalisky, a teacher who attended the memorial
service, worked on Wellstone's three campaigns. Looking ahead, she
called Mondale a "fine candidate." But, she added, "Nobody is going
to be Paul Wellstone."</TE>
<TE>   Coleman, a former mayor of St. Paul, has been forced to quickly
rethink his campaign strategy and decide how he will run against
Mondale, regarded by some in Minnesota as a political legend.</TE>
<TE>   But Coleman campaign aides were encouraged by a GOP poll they said
showed that their candidate would be competitive against Mondale. The
survey gave Mondale just a 2-percentage-point advantage in the race.</TE>
<TE>   Wellstone had been ahead by a slightly larger margin in polls
right before his death.</TE>
<TE>   Mondale is likely to agree to debate Coleman, as the Republicans
have requested, a Democratic Party source said.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman suspended campaigning after Wellstone's death, but Tom
Mason, a Coleman spokesman, said the Republican planned to get back
on the stump today. His TV ads also will resume.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign also took another twist as the Minnesota
Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party filed a lawsuit over whether voters who
already cast absentee ballots for Wellstone should be allowed to
change them.</TE>
<TE>   Voters who had cast absentee ballots can substitute Mondale's name
if they go to the polls Tuesday. But those who are unable to do so
will have their votes counted for Wellstone, hurting Mondale's
chances.</TE>

<HD>Yost Is Chosen Manager of Brewers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Atlanta Brave coach Ned Yost was hired as manager of the Milwaukee
Brewers on Tuesday, returning to the team where he was a backup
catcher in the 1980s.</LD>
<LD>   "This is needless to say a very special day in my life," Yost said
during a news conference at Miller Park. "To be able to come back
here ... it's just like being a 4-year-old at Christmas time."</LD>
<LD>   Yost agreed to a two-year contract that includes a club option for
2005.</LD>
<TE>   "Ned showed great determination for this opportunity," General
Manager Doug Melvin said.</TE>
<TE>   In other manager news, as expected the Oakland Athletics promoted
bench coach Ken Macha to take over for Art Howe, who left for the New
York Mets, and the Cleveland Indians hired Eric Wedge, 34, a former
big league catcher who becomes the majors' youngest manager.</TE>
<TE>   Wedge, who managed Cleveland's triple-A team at Buffalo last
season, said his predecessor, interim manager Joel Skinner, will go
back to his previous job as the team's third base coach.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Kent filed for free agency, two days after the San Francisco
Giants lost in Game 7 of the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta's Greg Maddux, winner of four Cy Young Awards, was also
among the 32 players who filed on the second day of the 15-day filing
period. Among others filing were Yankee third baseman Robin Ventura
and Seattle first baseman John Olerud.</TE>
<TE>   Three players filed for free agency after teams declined their
options: Philadelphia right-hander Terry Adams ($5.4 million),
Seattle right-hander James Baldwin ($4 million) and Oakland catcher
Greg Myers ($1.1 million).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Bartolo Colon's $6-million option was exercised by
the Montreal Expos.... Right-hander Todd Jones' $3-million option was
exercised by the Colorado Rockies.... The Toronto Blue Jays signed
left-hander Doug Creek to a one-year contract.</TE>

<HD>He Believes Angels Are Footnote to Bonds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rob Fernas</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Angel fans will disagree, but Mitch Albom of the Detroit Free Press
writes that Barry Bonds was the biggest winner in the World Series:</LD>
<LD>   "What Bonds did in this Series -- what he did in this postseason
-- was nothing less than awesome. Here is how impressive it was: You
will likely remember him long after you forget who won this
championship.</LD>
<LD>   "This World Series was about Barry Bonds. Lock. Stock. Barrel.
Face it. You didn't yell into the living room and say, 'Is David Bell
up yet?' Bonds was the attraction, the curiosity, the lightning rod.
He was the monster and the hero."</LD>
<TE>   And the loser, Mitch.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Carson Palmer set a USC record with 448 yards passing
against Oregon on Saturday. Who holds the USC record for most yards
rushing in a game?</TE>
<TE>   Charms race: "The word on the street," says John Cantu of
HumorMall.com, "is that Saddam Hussein just ordered 500,000 rally
monkeys."</TE>
<TE>   No math major: Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig, asked how many
major tournaments Tiger Woods would win next year, said, "Tiger has a
chance to win every tournament he's in, but if you're going to pin me
down to a number I'll say five or six."</TE>
<TE>   There are four majors in golf.</TE>
<TE>   Raising the bar: The Laker-Sacramento King rivalry can now be
considered among the best in professional sports, writes David Steele
of the San Francisco Chronicle:</TE>
<TE>   "Any last fear that either team merely would mark time until the
playoffs [and drain the regular season of all remaining drama] was
erased in the hail of punches Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   "The deans of discipline in the NBA office might not be crazy
about it now, but they'll like it a lot more come late May. So should
everyone else."</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback duel: Billy Kilmer and Joe Theismann were among the 70
greatest Washington Redskins brought together by team owner Daniel
Snyder last week, and the memories were not all fond ones.</TE>
<TE>   Kilmer's feelings toward Theismann, now an announcer for ESPN,
have not changed much since they were teammates in the 1970s. "He was
a jerk then and always will be," Kilmer said.</TE>
<TE>   Circus Bears: Jay Mariotti of the Chicago Sun-Times nominates the
2-5 Chicago Bears for the most "comedy-adaptable" team in the NFL:</TE>
<TE>   "The Bears are so stinking awful, they aren't worth your angst.
Just laugh, because around the football nation, everyone else is."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Ricky Bell, with 347 yards in 51 carries against
Washington State in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Bobby Bowden confounded many when the Florida State
coach used the term "bumfuzzled" to describe his team's play in a
loss to Notre Dame on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Kerasotis of Florida Today writes that Bowden probably felt
the same way Sunday morning after he forgot to set his clock back and
arrived an hour early for his breakfast with reporters:</TE>
<TE>   "[Bowden] arrived for breakfast to an empty room, where he sat
alone, reading the newspaper and drinking coffee. Bumfuzzled, no
doubt."</TE>

<KH>CLIPPER OPENER</KH>
<HD>Clippers Bent Out of Shape</HD>
<DH>Early injuries make Gentry unusually cranky and unwilling
to name a lineup.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Training camp was a disaster, plain and simple.</LD>
<LD>   Unless you happen to be a fan of hard-working trainers, that is.
If so, then Jasen Powell is your hero. Powell was the busiest man in
Clipperdom during October, tending to the sick and injured morning,
noon and night.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps that's what accounted for the uncharacteristically frosty
reception Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry gave reporters Tuesday
afternoon. Clearly, he understands his injured-riddled team is
nowhere near ready to open the season tonight against the Cleveland
Cavaliers at Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   After all, small forward Lamar Odom will be spending at least the
first month of the season on the injured list because of a badly
sprained right ankle. Power forward Elton Brand underwent
arthroscopic surgery on his right knee Sept. 26 and sat out almost
all of camp. Center Michael Olowokandi sat out all eight exhibitions
because of tendinitis in his left knee. Now he has an injured left
hip.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if Olowokandi was fit to play tonight, Gentry said tersely,
"I don't know. You'll have to ask him. He practiced [Tuesday]."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry then excused himself and had a short discussion with
Olowokandi after practice concluded at Los Angeles Southwest College.
When he returned, Gentry's mood lifted slightly.</TE>
<TE>   "He looked OK," Gentry said of Olowokandi. "His conditioning will
be a factor. We're going to play him as many minutes as we can."</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi said his participation would be determined after this
morning's shoot-around, after he gets a chance to stretch the
strained flexor, which is located near where the leg attaches to the
pelvis.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry refused to guess at a starting lineup, although it's a good
bet Brand, Olowokandi, Corey Maggette, Quentin Richardson and Andre
Miller will have their names introduced to the crowd tonight. Of
those five, only Miller made it through camp without incident.</TE>
<TE>   Maggette suffered a sprained right thumb in the Clippers' last
exhibition last week against the Milwaukee Bucks, but he has been
working out with his teammates and is expected to face the Cavaliers
tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson sprained his right knee while running laps in the first
few days of camp and played in only one of eight exhibitions.</TE>
<TE>   "I know what it'll be, but I'm just not telling you guys," Gentry
told reporters when asked for his starting five.</TE>
<TE>   Working another angle, someone asked about the Cavaliers facing
Miller, their old point guard, and the Clippers playing against
former reserve forward Darius Miles for the first time since the July
30 trade between the teams.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry again was unusually grumpy.</TE>
<TE>   "They have no advantage in having had Andre on their team and we
have no advantage in having had Darius on our team," he said. "I
think both teams benefited from the trade. That's what good trades
do.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll look to try to take advantage of his weaknesses. It's the
same thing they'll try to do to Andre. This isn't about Darius and
Andre, it's about Cleveland and the L.A. Clippers."</TE>
<TE>   Of Miles, 20, Gentry added, "We're still close to Darius. We'll
pull for him to do well except for the two games they play against
us. We want him to have a great year. Why wouldn't we? He's a great
kid. He did a lot for our franchise during the two seasons he was
here."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry then excused himself a second time, speaking to General
Manager Elgin Baylor at length on the other side of the gym. He did
not return.</TE>
<TE>   Miller said he was less concerned about sticking it to his old
teammates than helping his new ones get off to a good start.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no pressure at all," he said. "If we play good team
basketball, it should lead to wins."</TE>
<TE>   After the Cavaliers, the Clippers face the Lakers on Friday, then
the Detroit Pistons on Sunday before starting a four-game trip to
Philadelphia, New Jersey, Orlando and Miami next week. It's no time
to be at anything less than top form.</TE>

<LD>Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry became a fan of the underdog Angels during
the baseball playoffs. He made no secret of his rooting interest in
them during their World Series victory over the San Francisco Giants.</LD>
<LD>   "If you're a Clipper fan, you've got to be a fan," he said of the
Angels the other day. "If there's ever an inspiration for our
team.... Golly, for the Angels it's all about the team. Right now,
I'm an Angel fan. I hope we can duplicate what they've done.</LD>
<LD>   "It's all about believing in yourself and understanding the
sacrifices that need to be done for the team."</LD>
<TE>   For what it's worth, Las Vegas oddsmakers listed the Clippers as a
45-1 longshot to win the NBA championship.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shooting guard Eric Piatkowski on Andre Miller and Marko Jaric: "I
absolutely love our two new point guards. They're so good. They
understand the game. They're all about the team. They're so smooth.
Everybody knows what Andre can do. Marko will be awesome. He's kind
of flashy. He throws no-look passes. He's fun to play with. He's not
scared to throw a pass behind his back."</TE>

<TE>   Records--Clippers 0-0, Cavaliers 0-1.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Cavaliers (2001-02)--2-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update--The Cavaliers were routed Tuesday at Sacramento in their
opener against the Kings. The Clippers handled the Cavaliers twice
last season, then coaxed them into trading Miller during the
off-season. The Clippers gave up Darius Miles to get Miller, whom
they believe is the missing piece to what many believe will be a
playoff team for the first time since 1996-97. Miller led the NBA
last season with an average of 10.6 assists. Miles was the Clippers'
seventh man and did not average 10 points in either of his two
seasons in the league.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Listen Up! Charles Barkley with Ernie Johnson"</LD>
<TE>   Where: TNT, Thursdays, 4 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Charles Barkley has his own talk show. The half-hour weekly
show makes its debut Thursday. Barkley says it's going to be unique
-- not your typical talk show, and not just about sports.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to cover different subjects," he said while in Los
Angeles this week to promote his show with an appearance on a rival
show, Fox Sports Net's "Best Damn Sports Show Period." "Obviously,
sometimes we'll have some actors and people on to hype their movie,
but we're going to try to reach a compromise between serious-funny
and funny-serious."</TE>
<TE>   Comedian Bernie Mac, who has a show on Fox, will be Barkley's
first guest.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to get Bill Clinton on the show," Barkley said. "I'd
like Dr. Phil."</TE>
<TE>   Barkley, during a morning interview, looked at Tuesday's Hot
Corner about an HBO "Real Sports" segment on former NFL player Esera
Tuaolo announcing he was gay.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that's the kind of guest I'd love to have on the show," he
said. "I have a lot of gay friends and I think we could have an
interesting conversation."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Lazarus, Turner Sports president, said, "This show will be
interactive, topical, both funny and serious and promises to tackle
any topic -- just like Charles."</TE>

<HD>Jordan May Exercise Right to Be Traded</HD>
<DH>Dodger left fielder is looking for an extension. Evans
wants to keep him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>His efforts to secure a contract extension for his client rebuffed,
the agent for Brian Jordan said it's "extremely likely" the Dodger
left fielder will exercise his right to demand a trade. The Dodgers,
however, fully expect Jordan to be in their opening-day lineup next
spring, trade demand or not.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a chess move they can make, but we don't have to answer,"
Dodger General Manager Dan Evans said. "I'm not going to actively
shop him, and unless something better comes up, our intention is for
him to be our left fielder. I think the world of this guy. I love his
leadership, his talent."</LD>
<LD>   Because Jordan, who hit .285 with 18 home runs and 80 runs batted
in this season, was traded from Atlanta to Los Angeles in the middle
of a multiyear contract last January, he can ask for a trade within
15 days after the World Series.</LD>
<TE>   If no deal is reached by March 15 and Jordan does not rescind his
request, he would become a free agent. But in so doing, Jordan would
lose free-agency rights for three years and forfeit $11.5 million on
his current contract, which includes a guaranteed $9 million next
season and a $10.5-million option for 2004 that can be bought out for
$2.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan's agent, Jim Turner, had several discussions with Evans
last week about a contract extension, but the Dodgers, burdened by a
$100-million payroll that includes several bloated and immovable
contracts, don't want to make a multiyear commitment to a 36-year-old
who had major knee surgery earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   Turner said any request for a trade would be based on Jordan's
desire for long-term stability or to play closer to his Atlanta home
and does not reflect any negative feelings toward the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no animosity here, no demand out of anger or
disenchantment," Turner said. "If he can get into a long-term
situation closer to home, he'd welcome that. If the Dodgers offered
an extension, he'd welcome that. He's about stability. He would like
his family settled over a two- to four-year period."</TE>
<TE>   If Jordan, who had 30 RBIs in September, is not traded and remains
with the Dodgers, Turner vowed his mind-set would not change.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a professional," Turner said. "The Dodgers are a good team
with excellent fans, and it's a good place to play. If he comes back,
it will be with the intent of being the best player he can be to help
them win."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dodger bench coach Jim Riggleman is scheduled to interview for the
vacant Seattle Mariner managerial job today.... The Dodgers have
granted the New York Mets permission to interview Dave Wallace, the
team's senior vice president of baseball operations, for a job as
pitching coach on new Manager Art Howe's staff. Wallace, who will
interview this week, was the Met pitching coach in 2000, when they
went to the World Series.... Among Evans' early targets in the
free-agent market will be a left-handed hitting first baseman to
share time with Eric Karros, a backup catcher to replace free agent
Chad Kreuter and a left-handed reliever, though it's likely
left-hander Jesse Orosco will return in that role at 46.</TE>

<HD>Carney Keeps Ducks Afloat</HD>
<DH>Defenseman comes up with key stop late in overtime after
his third-period goal helps earn a 2-2 tie with the Canadiens.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MONTREAL</DL>
<LD>Mighty Duck defenseman Keith Carney has an impressive resume.</LD>
<LD>   Dependable defenseman. Intelligent player. Durable athlete. The
credentials, though, are left on the cutting room floor when the
highlights are shown.</LD>
<LD>   Carney created some on-air time for himself Tuesday. He whipped a
shot past Jeff Hackett to help the Ducks bail a little water with a
2-2 tie against the Montreal Canadiens in front of 19,521 at the Bell
Centre.</LD>
<TE>   In overtime, Carney was back to his usual chores, derailing Oleg
Petrov, who had nearly worked himself through the Duck defense for
what would have been a point-blank shot with 20 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   The tie may not rate a parade at Disneyland, but it was worth a
sigh of relief from the Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   "We definitely don't want a situation [that] we went through last
year, to be out of the playoff race as early as we were," said
Carney, who assisted Matt Cullen's first-period goal. "We're not
going to accept that this year."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks were close to being boxed into that corner. They blew a
two-goal lead and lost, 4-3, Saturday to Edmonton and went belly up
Monday against Toronto, 5-2. There were concerns heading into
Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the Ducks survived Hackett's cirque du soleil in goal and
came away with a point.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I mean, is that the same group we had last night?" Coach
Mike Babcock said. "A night later, after you got in at 3 a.m. and you
can play like that? It's not the opposition, I have said that many
times, it's us. We've got to decide that the Mighty Ducks are allowed
to be good."</TE>
<TE>   Babcock juggled his lineup, sitting veteran defenseman Fredrik
Olausson, who was brought in to spruce up the Duck offense. Babcock
said he sat the 37-year-old Olausson because of back-to-back games.
But Olausson has yet to record a point this season.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Duck defensemen accounted for only one goal and nine
points before Tuesday. Carney, who had a consecutive games streak of
262 game streak ended last season because of an injury, is the Ducks'
top offensive defenseman, with a goal and four points.</TE>
<TE>   "We moved the defense around tonight and got better play from
everybody," Babcock said.</TE>
<TE>   "We sure challenged our guys today. After last night, we needed to
respond, to ourselves more than anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Two things were clear after Tuesday's game.</TE>
<TE>   A goalie controversy does not exist at the moment in Montreal. The
Canadiens have a starting goalie in Hackett and a backup in Jose
Theodore, who has the Hart Trophy, the Vezina Trophy, a three-year
$16.5-million contract, and a 4.38 goals-against average.</TE>
<TE>   The other was that the Ducks could get through some tough times.</TE>
<TE>   Hackett stopped 31 of 33 shots. He was invulnerable in the second
period, stopping 17 shots, including seven in a two-minute stretch,
to preserve a 2-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks broke through at 15 minutes 8 seconds of the third
period. Steve Rucchin centered to Carney, who zipped a shot between
Hackett's legs for his 33rd goal in 658 games.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no reason we can't play like that every night," Duck
goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere said.</TE>
<TE>   Giguere knows that well. One of the best-kept secrets in the NHL
last season, he was left on the bench recently. But he came up with
his best game of the season against the Canadiens, stopping 22 of 24
shots.</TE>
<TE>   The only mistake Giguere made came late in the first period, when
he stumbled and Mariusz Czerkawski tossed in a back-hander from a
difficult angle near the boards to give the Canadiens a 2-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever something goes wrong, we always revert to the previous
[way we played]," Babcock said. "That is why it was good for us to
come back and win tonight."</TE>

<DL>MONTREAL</DL>
<LD>There were two homecomings Tuesday: one for Mighty Duck goalie
Jean-Sebastien Giguere and another for Duck Coach Mike Babcock.</LD>
<LD>   Giguere grew up in the Montreal suburbs, where he worshipped
Patrick Roy. Giguere made his third career start in Montreal and
stopped 22 of 24 shots in a 2-2 tie in front of 40 family members and
friends. "I was really nervous tonight," Giguere said. "It was 40
people against 20,000."</LD>
<LD>   Babcock played at McGill University. He returned one night after
his team was whipped, 5-2, by Toronto. "That game was on national
TV," he said. "That's just what you want your family to see."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Duck enforcer Kevin Sawyer was locked in a fight with Montreal's
Stephane Quintal in the first period, when they just stopped. Quintal
suffered a dislocated finger and asked for the break.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the only thing to do," Sawyer said. "That had never
happened to me before. You'll see someone's face getting beat up, but
you usually just keep pounding away. But this was something
different."</TE>

<HD>Pick Six Winner Is Identified</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Mieszerski</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While the investigation into possible fraud in Saturday's Breeders'
Cup pick six continues, the man sitting on a windfall insists he did
nothing wrong.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking to the Thoroughbred Times, the 29-year-old Baltimore
resident -- whose name, according to various reports, is Derrick
Davis -- says there was nothing but luck involved in what could be a
score, before taxes, of more than $3 million.</LD>
<LD>   Davis, who owns a computer service business and who recently
opened a telephone betting account with an off-track wagering service
in upstate New York so he could bet the races from home, put in a $12
pick six ticket, costing $1,152, that singled the first four winners
-- Domedriver in the Mile, Orientate in the Sprint, Starine in the
Filly and Mare Turf and Vindication in the Juvenile -- then used all
eight runners in the Turf, which was won by favored High Chaparral,
and all 12 in the Classic, which was won by 43-1 longshot Volponi.</LD>
<TE>   He said the $12 ticket was a mistake, that he meant to bet only a
$2 ticket, at a total cost of $192, so he wound up with all six
winning tickets, each worth $428,392, plus 108 consolations --
payoffs on the losing horses in the last two races -- at $4,606
apiece.</TE>
<TE>   "The bet was supposed to be $2, but I kind of screwed up with
their phone system," Davis was quoted as saying. "It was too late to
cancel. I couldn't get back to them.</TE>
<TE>   "This is kind of ridiculous. I'm still in a state of shock. The
fact that there's an investigation going on, what am I going to do? I
didn't do anything wrong. I don't want any attention.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't past-post anything," he said, alluding to concern that
the bets were made after, perhaps, as many as four races had been
run.</TE>
<TE>   "I do computer work, but I'm not a hacker. I'm the guy who won
this, but I'm the last person to find out what is going on. It's
ridiculous."</TE>

<HD>Fremont Sizes Up Tough Crenshaw</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Stephens</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fremont has sailed along on calm seas so far this season, outscoring
opponents, 341-43, in rolling to a 7-0 record and the No. 12 spot in
The Times' Southland rankings.</LD>
<LD>   But the Pathfinders know the Coliseum League waters will get
choppy with a showdown against Crenshaw on Friday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   Both teams reached the City Section semifinals last year, and,
recently, their yearly meetings have been intense affairs.</LD>
<TE>   Last season, Fremont defeated the Cougars, 27-19, at home but
later had to forfeit the victory because the Pathfinders had used an
ineligible player. Crenshaw won, 35-7, in 2000 and 21-0 in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a real good rivalry right now," Fremont Coach Pete Duffy
said. "I think Crenshaw's main rivalry is still Dorsey and ours is
probably still Locke, from a neighborhood standpoint, but we've had
some real good games in the last few years."</TE>
<TE>   Before the season, Fremont was a near consensus among City coaches
as a contender for its first major-division title in 42 years.</TE>
<TE>   The Pathfinders have standouts on defense and offense, including
two-way player Mark Bradford at receiver and defensive back, running
backs Milvon James and Eric Jones, quarterback Michael Beach and a
tough defense led by 6-foot-6, 290-pound defensive tackle Thomas
Herring.</TE>
<TE>   But Fremont has yet to be tested, other than a 16-10 victory over
San Pedro in the third week this season.</TE>
<TE>   Duffy said he purposely schedules weaker nonleague opponents to
keep his talented-but-thin squad from wearing out before league play
begins.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel a little better about this year's group because of the
number of guys coming back," he said. "But we've got to prove it on
the field."</TE>
<TE>   Crenshaw has a deceiving record at 4-3, 2-0 in league. The
Cougars' victories have been by an average of 35 points and the
losses have been to two undefeated teams, Woodland Hills Taft, No. 6
in The Times' rankings, and No. 2 Mission Viejo, and to San Pedro,
7-6.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't really have a glaring weakness," Duffy said of
Crenshaw. "They're fast, they're strong, they're big and they're
well-coached. You can't just show up and be competitive with them."</TE>
<TE>   One of the better individual battles will be waged between
Bradford and Crenshaw defensive back Daymeion Hughes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking at this as one of the biggest games of the year for
us," Bradford said. "It's one of our biggest tests."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Other league battles with first place on the line on Friday
include:</TE>
<TE>   * Gardena (5-2, 2-0) at Banning (4-3, 2-0) in the Marine League.
The Pilots will look to avenge a 14-0 loss last year at Gardena.</TE>
<TE>   * Roosevelt (6-1, 2-0) against Garfield (4-3, 2-0) at the Coliseum
in the Eastern League.</TE>
<TE>   * North Hollywood (5-1, 1-1) at Van Nuys Grant (5-2, 2-0) in the
competitive Sunset Six League, whose winner may not be decided until
the last week of the season.</TE>
<TE>   * Sepulveda Monroe (2-4-1, 2-0) at Sylmar (5-2, 2-0) in the Valley
Mission League. Another upset by Monroe would make it three victories
in a row.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bob Francola has given all sorts of motivational speeches in 17
years as coach at Granada Hills Kennedy. But this season, he's having
trouble knowing what to say to turn around his winless team. For a
tradition-rich program that has been to the playoffs in all but three
years under Francola, the Golden Cougars' 0-7 record is startling.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a first for us," Francola said. "It's definitely new
territory. We're just trying to survive it."</TE>
<TE>   With only five returning starters from last year's team that
reached the Invitational final, Kennedy struggled with a difficult
nonleague schedule against teams that are a combined 27-8. But the
last three defeats have been truly disheartening.</TE>
<TE>   The Golden Cougars have lost to Granada Hills, Van Nuys and Reseda
by a combined 14 points.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a couple of games where we lost one when we fumbled the
ball as we're going in for a touchdown," he said. "And then Friday
night [against Reseda], we run a punt back for a TD at the end of the
game and it's called back on a clipping penalty.</TE>
<TE>   "That's how it's been. We seem to find a way to make the wrong
play at the wrong time."</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy's last losing season was 1992. In 1991 and '95, the Golden
Cougars were 11-2 and 12-1 and reached the City semifinals both
years.</TE>
<TE>   "These kids are continuing to come to practice and work hard,"
Francola said. "They're aware of the tradition."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Another team in danger of not making the playoffs is Harbor City
Narbonne. The Gauchos (1-6, 0-2) are facing a must-win situation
Friday against San Pedro.</TE>
<TE>   First-year Coach Manuel Douglas hoped a tough early-season
schedule that included Long Beach Poly, L.A. Loyola, Venice and
Bellflower St. John Bosco would get the Gauchos ready for the Marine
League.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they have lost by three points in overtime to Carson and
by 12 to Wilmington Banning.</TE>
<TE>   San Pedro (3-4, 0-2) can also use a victory. The loser will be out
of the league title race and could be looking at a spot in the
Invitational playoff bracket.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   City top 10: 1. Taft (7-0); 2. Fremont (7-0); 3. Birmingham (5-2);
4. Carson (5-2); 5. Venice (6-1); 6. Roosevelt (6-1); 7. Banning
(4-3); 8. Crenshaw (4-3); 9. Gardena (5-2); 10. Franklin (6-1).</TE>

<LD>San Gabriel Gabrielino senior Andrew Castillo, in a coma since Oct.
4, has been upgraded from critical to serious condition at Providence

<TE>   Junior Michael Haddan of Irvine Woodbridge is regarded as one of
the top cross-country runners in the Western region of the U.S. after
winning his first seven races this season and setting course records
in two of them.</TE>
<TE>   But the defending state 800-meter champion in track says he hasn't
decided if he'll run in the West region championships at Mount San
Antonio College on Dec. 7.</TE>
<TE>   "It depends on how I feel," Haddad said. "We'll make the decision
near the end of the season."</TE>
<TE>   Haddan did not run in the West region championships last year
after finishing fifth in the state final.</TE>

<TE>   An injury to her right hip kept freshman Brenda Cohen of Canyon
Country Canyon, The Times' No. 3-ranked team in the Southland, out of
the Mount San Antonio College Invitational cross-country meet
Saturday, but her coaches are hopeful she'll be able to race in the
Foothill League finals at Castaic Lake on Nov. 7.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen, Canyon's top runner, suffered the injury during a workout
Oct. 21. She hasn't run since but has taken part in daily pool
workouts to maintain her cardiovascular fitness.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Junior Monika Rothenburger of No. 6 Dana Point Dana Hills hasn't
raced since the Clovis Invitational cross-country meet in Fresno on
Oct. 12 because of an injury to her left hip, but Coach Andy Sims is
hopeful she'll run in the South Coast League finals at Laguna Niguel
Regional Park on Nov. 7.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing acting up in her hip is the same thing that gave her
problems last track season," Sims said. "I thought she ran her best
race of the season in the Clovis Invitational, but she needed a break
[from racing] after that."</TE>

<LD>With five days to go at Oak Tree, three riders are separated by one
winner at the top of the jockey standings.</LD>
<LD>   Laffit Pincay Jr. has 21 winners entering this afternoon, one more
than Patrick Valenzuela and David Flores, who was the leader in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   The trio will go head-to-head in five of the eight races on the
card, starting in the first, a mile on turf for 3-year-old maiden
fillies and mares.</LD>
<TE>   Flores has the one to beat in Lasting Pleasure. She was third in
her career debut at Del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   All are longshots against prospective favorite Gambler's Mark in
the third and all are on logical contenders in the fifth, another
mile turf race for older fillies and mares.</TE>
<TE>   Pincay retains the mount on Belongstospeed, Valenzuela is aboard
Battante and she has run her best races for the jockey, and Flores
will try to lead all the way with Rubin's Rose.</TE>
<TE>   Valenzuela is aboard Parisian Heart in the seventh at a mile on
the grass, Pincay will try to repeat with Cease Span and Flores will
ride longshot Thermostatic before they complete the day in the
eighth, a seven-furlong race for $25,000 maidens.</TE>
<TE>   Klem, Valenzuela's mount, comes off a near-miss at a higher level,
Flores is aboard Spoonman and Pincay will ride Foxy Johnny.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Glitteringmischief will try for her fourth
victory in a row since being claimed by Jack Carava in today's sixth.
The gray filly will be ridden by Martin Pedroza.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Bud Klokstad. The veteran trainer has won with 11 of 26
starters at Bay Meadows.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Jockeys named Vergara. Octavio and Daniel Vergara are
winless in 46 at Oak Tree.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling Lasting Pleasure in the
first, using all in the second and singling Gambler's Mark in the
third.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 5/59. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $21.20/$325.40. Total money bet: $374.</TE>

<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Chris McAlpine, who played two games in the minors last weekend on a
conditioning assignment, made his King debut in Tuesday night's 4-0
victory over the Atlanta Thrashers, replacing Brad Norton.</LD>
<LD>   "I talked to Brad Norton about it," Coach Andy Murray said before
the game. "I said, 'It's an opportune time for us to give McAlpine a
game.' I said, 'We're happy with what you've done, really impressed
with what you've done.' ...</LD>
<LD>   "But McAlpine played two good games in Manchester [N.H.],
especially the second game, and if we're going to put him in, now's a
good time, rather than losing the effect of those two games."</LD>
<TE>   McAlpine, who played 90 games with the Chicago Blackhawks over two
seasons before signing with the Kings as an unrestricted free agent
in July, also is expected to play Thursday night at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just waiting for my chance," McAlpine said.</TE>

<TE>   Jamie Storr, whose 5-1 loss Sunday to the Columbus Blue Jackets

<HD>Kings Pay High Price in Win</HD>
<DH>Allison hurts knee during 4-0 victory over Atlanta. Murray
says injury is "very serious."</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>King Coach Andy Murray called it vicious. Brad Chartrand, watching
from the bench, said there was "definitely a big sound to it."</LD>
<LD>   It may have been the sound of the Kings' season exploding.</LD>
<LD>   A violent knee-on-knee collision between Jason Allison of the
Kings and Andy Sutton of the Atlanta Thrashers on Tuesday night may
have resulted in a season-ending knee injury for Allison.</LD>
<TE>   The Kings would say only that their scoring leader had suffered a
sprained right knee, but their long faces after a 4-0 victory in
front of an announced crowd of 11,440 at Philips Arena told a
different, more troubling story.</TE>
<TE>   Allison had little to say, offering only that he knew right away
that he had been badly injured, as he made his way on crutches out of
the trainer's room, down a hallway and onto the team bus about 30
minutes after the game.</TE>
<TE>   His right leg had been immobilized in a large blue brace.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of pain," he mumbled.</TE>
<TE>   Allison had been carrying the puck up the right side of the ice
near the red line midway through the first period, during the second
of the Kings' 12 power plays, when he tried to sidestep Sutton, a
6-foot-6, 245-pound defenseman.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I was by him," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sutton, however, seemed to stick his leg out as the 6-3, 215-pound
Allison tried to get past him to the inside. Their right knees
slammed together.</TE>
<TE>   Allison fell to the ice, grimacing and clutching his knee.</TE>
<TE>   Helped off the ice, he spent the rest of game in the dressing
room. He flew with the Kings to Chicago, where they'll wrap up a
five-game trip Thursday night, but was scheduled to fly home to Los
Angeles today for further tests.</TE>
<TE>   "It's serious," Murray said. "It's very serious."</TE>
<TE>   Already playing without injured regulars Aaron Miller and Ziggy
Palffy, the Kings soldiered on and overwhelmed the winless Thrashers.</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Lubomir Visnovsky had three points, among them two
goals, and Mikko Eloranta also scored two goals as the Kings extended
the Thrashers' winless streak to 18 games. The Thrashers, who last
won on March 23, ended last season with a nine-game winless streak
and are 0-8-0-1 this season.</TE>
<TE>   Visnovsky and Eloranta scored in the last 46 seconds of the first
period, Eloranta on the deflection of a shot by Visnovsky.</TE>
<TE>   Visnovsky scored his second goal in the second period and Eloranta
scored again in the third.</TE>
<TE>   Goaltender Felix Potvin stopped 25 shots for his first save.</TE>
<TE>   Allison's injury, however, overshadowed everything else.</TE>
<TE>   "A coach's nightmare," teammate Bryan Smolinski called it.</TE>
<TE>   The rugged, durable center has played in 82 consecutive games
since the Kings acquired him last season in a trade with the Boston
Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   He led the club with 74 points in 73 games last season and has 11
in nine games this season.</TE>
<TE>   "You've really got to hurt him for him not to get up and
physically get off the ice," said Chartrand, a teammate.</TE>
<TE>   Murray was angry that Sutton had not been penalized for the play
and angrier still at the referees' explanation for not sending him
off.</TE>
<TE>   "My concern is that two officials on the ice both came to me and
said it was a great shoulder check," he said. "It's the
responsibility of the referees to make that call. And for them to
tell us, in their words, it was a great shoulder check?</TE>
<TE>   "A star player in the NHL could be out for two months. I think
it's important that the league steps in and holds their guys
accountable."</TE>
<TE>   None of the Kings suggested that Sutton had intended to injure
Allison, but that didn't stop Ian Laperriere from picking a fight as
Sutton left the penalty box later in the first period, resulting in
17 minutes worth of penalties for Laperriere.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an accident," King captain Mattias Norstrom said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Sutton: "I am sorry that Jason Allison was injured, but that
is part of the game and I am a little more concerned right now about
the loss."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, of course, had greater worries, but they put up a brave
front. They've been down this road before, playing long stretches
last season without Palffy and defenseman Mathieu Schneider but
surviving to make the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Their thoughts were with Allison.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't look good," Schneider said.</TE>

<HD>Buss Working on Ways to Keep Jackson Around</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Coach Phil Jackson, who has two years left on his contract, said
Tuesday night that he probably would not consider an extension until
after the season.</LD>
<LD>   He did, however, seem open to a negotiation first broached by
owner Jerry Buss over the summer.</LD>
<LD>   According to Jackson, Buss told Jackson he hoped he was
comfortable enough to come to him when he felt the time was right to
enter into negotiations.</LD>
<TE>   "I want to finish this year, and then we'll talk," Jackson said he
responded.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's contract is for $30 million over five years, the first
three seasons bringing NBA championships back to an organization
otherwise waiting for Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant to mesh.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson has prospered in Los Angeles. He found career satisfaction
with the Lakers, standing on the brink of passing Red Auerbach for
the most coaching titles. Both have nine. And Jackson is romantically
involved with Jeanie Buss, the owner's daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "I would think Phil would want to continue for a while, but that's
just a hunch," Buss said. "You know, I have lunch with him, I have
dinner with him and when the subject comes up we kind of drop it and
don't discuss it. But, if you're asking me what my guess is, I'd have
to feel he'd be interested in an extension.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been no discussion. I had mentioned it to him that at
some time we should sit down and discuss that and he said, 'That
would be a good idea.' That's very non-committal, as you can see. I'm
going to redecorate my den, put a few Indian artifacts around. I can
do my homework too."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers did not exercise the option on Mark Madsen's contract,
meaning he will be an unrestricted free agent at the end of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   Madsen was due to make $1.5 million next season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal said his foot and toe responded well to his first day of
light running, and that he expected to increase the intensity of his
workouts.</TE>
<TE>   He also is optimistic that a new shoe and orthotic device designed
to ease the pain beneath his toe would hasten his recovery. On the
injured list, O'Neal is not eligible to play in the Lakers' first
five games.</TE>

<TE>   Update  -- The Trail Blazers remain the Western Conference's
enigma, heavy on talent and light on the sense to make it all fit.
The Lakers have eliminated them from three consecutive postseasons,
the last two years by first-round sweeps. So, the Trail Blazers
talked Arvydas Sabonis out of retirement and added Antonio Daniels
and Jeff McInnis, but at a massive price. Portland's payroll is an
astonishing $104.6 million, an NBA record.</TE>

<KH>NBA SEASON OPENS</KH>
<HD>Lakers Missing Something</HD>
<DH>Without injured O'Neal and suspended Fox, L.A. comes up
ugly in opener against motivated Spurs, 87-82. Bryant misses 20 of 29
shots.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Phil Jackson had wondered aloud about opening defense of his three
NBA championships here with six or seven losses, and everyone nodded
and glanced at Shaquille O'Neal, still a toe shy of his whole game.</LD>
<LD>   So sat Shaq in a casual black suit near the end of the bench while
the Lakers went off for a while without him, first against the San
Antonio Spurs on Tuesday night with an 87-82 defeat before the 77th
consecutive sellout at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   After they hung another banner and slid shiny rings onto their
fingers, after the four guys standing beside each other, each in a
T-shirt that read "PEAT," sat down, the Lakers followed Kobe Bryant
into a season they believe will separate themselves from nearly
anything that has come before them.</LD>
<TE>   That can't die in a single game before Halloween, of course, but
it didn't soothe Jackson, who spent most of the night staring out to
the floor, in a place somewhere between bemused and aghast.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, they get better from here on out," he said. "It was
not easy to digest."</TE>
<TE>   Expecting something a bit more precise, the Lakers made 31.8% of
their field goals and fouled the Spurs 34 times. Bryant missed 20 of
29 shots -- six of seven in the final quarter -- and so scored a
hollow 27 points.</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs had scoring runs of 9-0 late in the third quarter and
7-0 early in the fourth, five players scored in double figures, and
the Lakers lost their first season opener in 11 years.</TE>
<TE>   "We know it's going to be hard," Bryant said. "Everybody knew
that. [But] we made it harder on ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   As for his own game -- his 29 shots were nearly three times his
closest teammate -- Bryant said he hadn't meant it to go that way.</TE>
<TE>   "This is no indication of the style I'm going to be playing," he
said. "That's way too many. I shouldn't be shooting that many times."</TE>
<TE>   That being said, he added, "We played hard. We just have to play
better."</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs didn't exactly dance off the floor, either. Tim Duncan,
the reigning league MVP, scored 14 points on 14 shots, and the Spurs
shot 36.6% from the floor. Still, it was plenty to finish the Lakers,
who often looked ragged.</TE>
<TE>   "Thrilled it'll count as a win as the season goes on," Spur Coach
Gregg Popovich said. "Disappointed in our play."</TE>
<TE>   It's how it's going to look for a while for the Lakers, what with
O'Neal at least four more games from being together again. Then, Rick
Fox, who spent the summer getting slim and quicker, won't be allowed
to play until game seven, putting more pressure on an offense that
already had lost countless easy baskets with O'Neal's surgery.</TE>
<TE>   As the national anthem was sung, Fox stood in the garage beneath
Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   His BMW was blocked in by a rental truck, and he was late getting
to Pete Sampras' house to watch the game, but he didn't really mind.</TE>
<TE>   He'd stay, despite the league's edict that he leave the building
before game time.</TE>
<TE>   Fox was suspended for the first six games of the season, the
punishment for instigating the fight with Sacramento King guard Doug
Christie on Friday. Devean George started in his place, in a front
line of George, Robert Horry and Soumaila Samake.</TE>
<TE>   Fox received his ring, slapped everybody's hands, hugged Bryant,
his jaw set, like always. Then, instead of pulling off his golden
warmup and stepping to the floor, he left through a tunnel to a car
whose engine was still warm.</TE>
<TE>   "You know what, it's different now, not being able to go play,"
Fox said, clutching a box with the ring in it. "But it's a good
reminder. We got three of these for a reason, because we're good at
what we do."</TE>
<TE>   The valet never parked Fox's car, just left it in the garage, and
now security was rushing around, looking for the driver. Fox spread
his arms helplessly, happy for the alibi.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, I tried to leave," he said, smiling, "but I couldn't. Hey,
no rush ... "</TE>
<TE>   Back on the floor, the Lakers began their quest for a fourth
consecutive title by missing 16 of their first 22 field-goal
attempts, which brought them a minute into the second quarter.
Bryant, perhaps too eager to start quickly with O'Neal on the bench,
missed eight of his first 11 shots.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers stayed close to the Spurs, who couldn't shoot much,
either. Duncan was three for 14. Tony Parker missed all 10 of his
shots. But the Spurs shot 46 free throws (to the Lakers' 30) and made
32.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to have to play well and execute better and make less
mistakes, keep teams off the free-throw line, if we expect to win,"
Laker guard Brian Shaw said. "We already have enough against us with
those guys being out, so we're going to have to play pretty near
perfect basketball in order to get these wins."</TE>
<TE>   There had been a huge roar for Fox, viewed by more than a few in
the partisan crowd as heroic, both for his years as a Laker and his
unyielding quest to pummel Christie.</TE>
<TE>   During Randy Newman's live version of "I Love L.A." the Lakers
milled around, hugged, and held one last time to a three-peat won in
the strangest places, some of them in San Antonio, as it turned out.</TE>
<TE>   And then it was over, the Lakers run off the floor like Newman's
piano, leaving them holding themselves together, waiting on O'Neal in
particular.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be fine," O'Neal said.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scorer, rebounder, passer. That was the Grant Hill the Orlando Magic
thought they were getting two long years ago, and that was who came
to play Tuesday night.</LD>
<LD>   Looking nothing like the player last seen limping away on a
brittle left ankle, the five-time All-Star had 18 points, seven
assists and six rebounds in his first game since December as the
Magic beat the Philadelphia 76ers, 95-88, at Orlando, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   "Physically, I felt good," Hill said. "Mentally, I was a little
rusty. But it was great to get out there, it was good to play."</LD>
<TE>   Tracy McGrady had a 31 points and five assists for the Magic.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought Hill and Tracy, the last eight minutes, played the
two-man game off each other as well as you can play," Orlando Coach
Doc Rivers said. "They're going to keep getting better."</TE>
<TE>   Hill showed no effects from the three ankle surgeries that have
held him out of all but 18 games over the last two years, shooting
five of 10 from the field and eight of nine from the line.
Occasionally playing point forward, he turned the ball over three
times in 33 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Van Horn had 19 points and 10 rebounds to lead Philadelphia,
while Aaron McKie also had 19. Allen Iverson shot seven for 25,
missing his final eight attempts, for 18 points.</TE>
<TE>   The Magic held Philadelphia to 35% shooting (18 of 52) after the
first quarter and scored 25 points off 20 turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   "I know we're trying to win, but we need to learn how to win
helping each other," Philadelphia Coach Larry Brown said. "We shot so
many times without any opportunity to control the tempo or get other
people open."</TE>
<TE>   The Magic lost Horace Grant, still recovering from off-season
surgery, to a sore left knee at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento 94, Cleveland 67 -- Peja Stojakovic scored 17 points
and Chris Webber had 14 rebounds as the Kings opened a season of
great expectations with an easy victory at Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings unveiled a banner as the defending Pacific Division
champion beforehand.</TE>
<TE>   Playing without their starting backcourt of Doug Christie
(suspension) and Mike Bibby (foot injury), the Kings had no trouble
with the Cavaliers, who made 24 turnovers and shot less than 33%.</TE>
<TE>   Ricky Davis led Cleveland with 17 points.</TE>

<LD>Hi, I'm Rick Fox for Cintas, reminding you that being in uniform
makes all the difference.</LD>
<LD>   Don't I know.</LD>
<LD>   Another opening, however ceremonial. Another show, however
deferred.</LD>
<TE>   A journey of 1,000 miles starts with a single step but for teams
like these, which aspire to play into June, it seems like it's even
longer than that, with many tests along the way....</TE>
<TE>   Like the Lakers' ring ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   It may have been fun for them but what about the Spurs, who were
champions before their three-title run started, who were humiliated
by the Lakes in the 2001 playoffs and pummeled again by them last
spring?</TE>
<TE>   How do you think the Spurs feel when they hear Santana is playing
outside on the balcony and that rendition of "I Love L.A." isn't a
recording, but Randy Newman, himself?</TE>
<TE>   Actually, the Spurs didn't think anything of the Lakers' ceremony
because they skipped it, waiting it out inside their dressing room
until it ended.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the option [of watching it] because we were invited here
to play and we can stay out there if we want to," said Coach Gregg
Popovich before the game.</TE>
<TE>   So what were they going to do?</TE>
<TE>   "I got no clue," said Popovich. "Whatever the guys want to do,
they can do."</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, they voted to stay inside.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, the Spurs were holding the ring ceremony,
although their guests that night, the 76ers, watched. Popovich had
been an assistant under 76er Coach Larry Brown and considers him a
mentor.</TE>
<TE>   Let's just say Popovich and Laker Coach Phil Jackson don't have
quite the same relationship.</TE>
<TE>   Someone asked Popovich if he thought of wearing his own ring
Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   "No," he said. "I'm not [crazy]. Besides it's three [titles for
the Lakers] to one [for the Spurs] here, anyway. I don't think anyone
would have been that impressed."</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the game.</TE>
<TE>   For the Lakers, looking overmatched but playing better than that
before succumbing to the superior force, 87-82.</TE>
<TE>   The problem for the Lakers isn't one night but the next two weeks,
which threaten to be just as ceremonial. Jackson suggests they could
start 0-7, 1-6 or 2-5 and, although he laughs when he says it and
people assume he's joking, he may not be.</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs are in better shape than the Lakers right now, but who
isn't?</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs' new hope, Argentine shooting guard Manu Ginobili, is
still backing up 33-year-old Steve Smith. After three seasons of
transitioning from his 1999 champions to his Spurs of today, before
David Robinson retires this summer and they go out looking for
another big man, Popovich has learned to value stability.</TE>
<TE>   "We had guys that were older," Popovich said. "We had to change.
Sean [Elliott] and Avery [Johnson] basically couldn't play any more.
The core is there but we had to make some changes.</TE>
<TE>   "But I think it's gone very, very smoothly, as transitions go.
Usually, when teams make transitions, they go in the dumper for a
while and have a tough time.</TE>
<TE>   "I think [Tony] Parker coming in was just huge for us. Without him

in big trouble, if he hadn't developed as quickly as he did."</TE>
<TE>   Popovich said Parker even went after 7-0, 250-pound teammate Kevin
Willis in a recent practice for elbowing him.</TE>

everyone.</TE>

<HD>Knicks Extend Chaney's Contract</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Coach Don Chaney received some added job security Tuesday, getting a
one-year contract extension from the New York Knicks.</LD>
<LD>   The extension is the second for Chaney in less than a year since
taking over after Jeff Van Gundy's unexpected resignation in
December. It also perhaps signals that the Knicks will not make
Chaney a fall guy during a likely poor season.</LD>
<LD>   "We have great confidence that Don is the right person to lead the
Knicks," said James Dolan, chairman of Cablevision, the Knicks'
corporate owner.</LD>
<TE>   With a career record of 276-409, Chaney is entering his 11th
season as a head coach. He coached the Knicks to a 20-43 record last
season after replacing Van Gundy</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota Timberwolf guard Terrell Brandon is unsure when or if he
will play again after February surgery for a fractured knee
cartilage.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone tries to give me a due date this, a due date that,"
Brandon said. "Some say one month, some say two, some say February,
some say next year.... If I play, then I feel like I'm the best point
guard for this franchise. And if I don't, I've had 11 years -- I
can't complain about that."</TE>
<TE>   Troy Hudson and Rod Strickland will play the position in Brandon's
absence.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he can control his competitive urge and keep his playing
time down as a nonstarter for the first time, Washington Wizard
swingman Michael Jordan said: "Probably not."</TE>
<TE>   "I can't honestly say how I'm going to react," said Jordan, who
struggled with knee problems while playing heavy minutes last season.
"It depends on how the guys in front of me react."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Doug Collins wants to play Jordan about 25 minutes per game,
a figure that will go up after the All-Star break if Jordan hasn't
had a physical setback.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A record 67 international players are on NBA rosters for the start
of the season, led by the Dallas Mavericks with five.</TE>
<TE>   The league said the players -- active and injured -- were from 35
countries and territories.</TE>
<TE>   Following the Mavericks, the Memphis Grizzlies, San Antonio Spurs
and the Utah Jazz have four international players each. Yao Ming, the
overall No. 1 draft pick and the third player from China, makes his
debut with the Houston Rockets tonight. There are a record nine
players from Yugoslavia.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Two years after bypassing college for the NBA, DeShawn Stevenson
will start at shooting guard for the Utah Jazz tonight at New
Orleans. He has a career average of 3.8 points per game.... Backup
forward-center Jeff Foster, 25, signed a contract extension with the
Indiana Pacers. Terms were not disclosed.</TE>

<HD>Putting the CART Before the Hearse</HD>
<DH>Rumors of racing league's demise continue, but Pook says
it's 'positioned better now than it has been for the last 10 years.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martin Henderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roger Penske has gone to the Indy Racing League. Michael Andretti,
Honda and Toyota are going. Chip Ganassi may or may not be going too.
The IRL seems to have all the momentum in the open-wheel race car
war.</LD>
<LD>   And yet, Championship Auto Racing Teams is hanging in there.</LD>
<LD>   The series with the iron chin arrives at California Speedway this
week for the Toyota 500 and the only things running faster than
demise rumors will be the cars going 230 mph around the two-mile
oval.</LD>
<TE>   Yet, CART President and CEO Chris Pook, who masterminded the
hugely successful Grand Prix of Long Beach in 1975, before he knew
anything about the business of auto racing, says, "CART is positioned
better now than it has been for the last 10 years."</TE>
<TE>   It's Pook's job to spin things in a positive light. But is he
really on to something? Consider:</TE>
<TE>   * CART has adopted a marketing plan in the North American Free
Trade Agreement countries, which Pook says will be twice as large as
any other market by 2007.</TE>
<TE>   * With the addition of races in Tampa-St. Petersburg in 2003, and
Houston in 2004, CART will be racing in 11 of the top 25 U.S.
markets. It also races in Canada's three largest markets, Toronto,
Vancouver and Montreal, and Mexico's top two, Monterrey and Mexico
City.</TE>
<TE>   * By 2005, Pook says, there will "definitely be 15 races in NAFTA
markets, three in the European economic community, and two in the
Pacific Rim." CART must add one more Pacific venue -- it extended its
Australia race over the weekend though 2008 -- and two more in
Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the day," Pook says, "manufacturers want to be in
those markets, and we want to be the company that provides that."</TE>
<TE>   CART can also better market its strength, which is the diversity
of its tracks and drivers, by creating the NAFTA Cup -- a series
within the series linking a road race in Monterrey, a city street
race in Toronto, and the oval race in Fontana -- to create additional
in-season interest. Pook has other cards up his sleeve. While in
Europe last month for CART's race in England, he said, he spoke to
half a dozen car manufacturers. By 2005, he added, CART could be
racing cars powered by Maserati, BMW, Audi, Mercedes, Nissan
Infiniti, Hyundai and Jaguar engines.</TE>
<TE>   That would appeal to CART's strongest demographic, affluent men
between the ages of 17-34 and 45-60. But the bridge to 2005 is
critical, and that's why Pook -- who started on the job last Dec. 18
-- has focused on creating a stable business platform. That's where
Cosworth, the engine manufacturer owned by Ford, plays an important
role. It will provide detuned -- from about 800 to 700 horsepower --
turbocharged engines for the series, thereby reducing costs to teams,
for the next two years.</TE>
<TE>   Cars won't have traction control, which should allow for more
passing, and aerodynamic packages are being developed to create the
kind of side-by-side oval racing common in the IRL.</TE>
<TE>   And in 2005, assuming CART lives that long?</TE>
<TE>   The series then will have new engine and chassis specifications.
Pook wants normally aspirated gas-powered V-10 engines, the power
plants used in Formula One.</TE>
<TE>   Did somebody say, "Formula One?"</TE>
<TE>   Last February, Pook reached out to the IRL, offering to use a
common chassis and adopt the IRL's basic engine formula, a precursor,
perhaps, to the merging of the two. The olive branch was broken,
though, by IRL President Tony George, who demanded IRL chassis
exclusivity. Thus, the racing leagues seem destined to go their
separate ways.</TE>
<TE>   But might Pook be taking a similar approach to Formula One? In
Europe, he talked with friend and Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone,
which heated up the rumor mill. The Toronto Sun recently reported
that CART's board of directors would consider selling 51% of its
shares to Ecclestone. Among other rumors are that Ecclestone is one
of several investors who want to buy the publicly held company and
privatize it.</TE>
<TE>   CART champions have long made a habit of skipping off to F1, to
the point where critics consider CART racing little more than a
development series for Grand Prix racing.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a huge compliment to be a development series for
Formula One," Pook says. "Some of our predecessors in CART had the
mistaken impression that we could challenge Formula One."</TE>
<TE>   If you can't beat them, join them?</TE>
<TE>   Pook, though, says there is no immediate end in sight for CART as
a separate entity. At Fontana, about 140,000 are expected over three
days. Last year's race produced a record 73 lead changes before
Cristiano da Matta edged Max Papis by .007 of a second before a
caution flag came out for the final five laps. No one dismisses the
success of CART's street events in major cities, which will make up
at least half of its scheduled 20 races in 2003. Chicago, currently
the site of an oval race, may eventually be added to that list.</TE>
<TE>   If things are looking up, however, problems remain:</TE>
<TE>   * The series was hit hard by reduced sponsor income in a
post-Sept. 11 economy. Federal Express won't return as a title
sponsor next season, but CART is on the verge of announcing a
replacement, possibly two.</TE>
<TE>   * A race in Germany was canceled because of EuroSpeedway's
bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   * Besides Andretti, who has probably the most recognizable name in
American racing, drivers Dario Franchitti (IRL) and Christian
Fittipaldi (NASCAR), two of the series' better-known drivers, are
leaving because they aren't sold on the solidity of CART.</TE>
<TE>   * The series had to pay to have a third of its races televised on
cable's Speed Channel. Speed Channel, owned by Fox, will get bigger,
though, and CART's television package can only get better.</TE>
<TE>   * Two teams halted operations during the season for lack of
sponsors, leaving the field with only 18 cars instead of 20.</TE>
<TE>   * Questions abound regarding the car count in 2003. Pook promises
at least 18, probably 20, maybe 22, yet no more than 10 cars have
publicly committed to 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "There are teams coming," Pook said, implying that they'll be
coming from somewhere other than Toyota Atlantic, CART's development
series, and the IRL. There is also money coming. On Oct. 18, Pook was
authorized by CART's board of directors to spend up to $30 million on
the 2003 season. That's on top of the series' plan to provide up to
$850,000 a car, for the first 20 cars, as part of the Entrant Support
Program. In a cost-efficient environment, it's conceivable that Pook
could use some of CART's $120-million war chest to provide matching
funds for serious owners, such as Frank Arciero, or prospective
owners, such as Mario Andretti, Michael's father, and Emerson
Fittipaldi, or European Formula 3000 or sports car teams.</TE>
<TE>   It may also be significant that CART's race in Miami this month
was a success, despite legal wangling by International Speedway to
prevent it from taking place. Pook was willing to fight -- and won.</TE>
<TE>   There are other fights ahead, to be sure. But it showed that he
isn't rolling over -- and that there might be life in CART after all.</TE>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Andre Agassi overcame 35 unforced errors and beat Argentina's Gaston
Gaudio, 6-4, 6-7 (1), 6-4, Tuesday to advance to the third round of
the Paris Masters.</LD>
<LD>   Agassi, a two-time tournament champion, will face the winner of
the second-round match between Australian Open champion Thomas
Johansson and Tommy Robredo.</LD>
<LD>   Top-seeded Lleyton Hewitt also reached the third round in Paris,
easily defeating Finland's Jarkko Nieminen, 6-2, 6-4. The Australian
next meets Yevgeny Kafelnikov, who eliminated Nicolas Lapentti of
Ecuador, 6-3, 7-6 (8).</LD>
<TE>   Agassi trails Hewitt by only 43 points in the ATP Champions Race,
which determines the year-end rankings. The American hasn't won a
major this season, but he has taken three of eight Masters Series
events, which are second only to majors in importance.</TE>
<TE>   "Feeling like I'm out there competing for it keeps my juices
flowing through the end of the year," Agassi said. "It motivates me
to do it next year. It makes me feel like I can do it next year."</TE>
<TE>   In another match, American James Blake rallied to defeat Chile's
Fernando Gonzalez, 6-7 (4), 6-4, 6-4.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The parents of Venus and Serena Williams have completed their
divorce.</TE>
<TE>   The divorce won't affect the advisory roles Richard and Oracene
Williams play in their daughters' tennis careers, said Raymone Bain,
a publicist for Oracene and Serena Williams.</TE>
<TE>   The Williamses married in 1980 and separated about 18 months ago,
Bain said.</TE>
<TE>   Jurisprudence</TE>
<TE>   Boxing promoter Bob Arum testified in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., that
he believed rival Don King forged a contract with Julio Cesar Chavez
and underpaid him before Arum signed the fighter for two matches in
1998.</TE>
<TE>   King is seeking at least $14 million in damages for losing 1 1/2
years of profits on Chavez. King testified that Arum should have
known the fighter was lying about his agreements with him.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ian Thorpe, Australia's three-time Olympic swimming champion, was
granted a restraining order against a man and woman who had earlier
been charged with stalking him at his local pool.</TE>
<TE>   Thorpe, 20, went to a local magistrates court in Sydney to seek a
personal Apprehended Violence Order against 27-year-old stripper
Taylor Martin, and Vernon Ray Hopkins, a 32-year-old married father.</TE>
<TE>   Thorpe contacted police in January after the pair left a series of
notes on his car, the last of which was accompanied by a bumblebee
soft toy and a single rose, the Daily Telegraph newspaper said. The
attention prompted Thorpe's management to increase security at the
swimming center he uses for training.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always appreciated the genuine attention and support of my
fans and I've always recognized my responsibility to meet the needs
of my genuine fans," Thorpe said in a statement. "However, this was
not such a situation."</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Prada avoided an upset loss in an all-Italian duel with Mascalzone
Latino, and Oracle had a win ripped from its grasp within 150 yards
of the finish today in a bizarre round of America's Cup challenger
racing at Auckland, New Zealand.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle had a winning lead against Sweden's Victory Challenge when
racing time expired.</TE>
<TE>   The clash of American rivals OneWorld and Stars &amp; Stripes also was
abandoned on its last leg when the time limit expired. The race was
already contentious, thrown under protest by both teams because of
the race committee's handling of a baffling downwind leg.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Michael Weiss, a two-time U.S. champion and Olympian, is changing
coaches from Audrey Weisiger to Don Laws.</TE>
<TE>   Weiss, the 1999 and 2000 national champion, was with Weisiger
since 1984. But a recent slump -- he finished fifth against a weak
field at Skate America last week -- led to the switch to Laws.</TE>
<TE>   Laws coached Scott Hamilton to the 1984 Olympic gold medal, as
well as to four national and world crowns. He has been working with
Weiss on a part-time basis for several months.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New York Giant receiver Ike Hilliard will sit out the rest of the
season after dislocating his right shoulder on a hit by all-pro
safety Brian Dawkins of the Philadelphia Eagles.</LD>
<LD>   An MRI exam Tuesday disclosed a tear in both Hilliard's labrum and
pectoralis muscle. He will undergo surgery in about a month and will
at some point be put on injured reserve.</LD>
<LD>   The normal rehabilitation period for the surgery Hilliard will
undergo is three months.</LD>
<TE>   This is the second season-ending injury for Hilliard, who sat out
most of his rookie season after suffering a neck injury that required
surgery.</TE>

<TE>   The Seattle Seahawks, needing help at quarterback after Trent

<TE>   Rodney Harrison, the hard-hitting San Diego Charger strong safety,

Harrison must sit out Sunday's home game against the New York Jets.</TE>

<TE>   Pittsburgh Steeler running back Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala will be
sidelined at least two games because of a torn chest muscle that will

weeks because of a knee injury.... The Carolina Panthers waived
quarterback Tim Hasselbeck, exactly one week after they signed him to
provide immediate depth.... The Denver Broncos released 10-year
veteran punter Tom Rouen and signed punter-kicker Micah Knorr. The

<LD>Lubomir Sekeras scored 3:43 into overtime Tuesday night to lift the
Minnesota Wild to a 3-2 victory over the Colorado Avalanche at St.
Paul, Minn., giving the third-year franchise an NHL-best 16 points.</LD>
<LD>   Skating in front of the net, Sekeras took a backhanded pass from
Sergei Zholtok from the left side and wristed the puck past David
Aebischer to send the sellout crowd into a frenzy.</LD>
<LD>   The Wild, which skated to a 3-3 tie at Colorado on Sunday, is
7-1-2.</LD>
<TE>   Colorado looked dominating early, outshooting the Wild, 14-1, in
the first period. But the Wild outshot the Avalanche, 22-9, the rest
of the way and again got strong goaltending from Manny Fernandez, who
finished with 21 saves.</TE>
<TE>   Aebischer, who started in place of a resting Patrick Roy, made 20
stops and fell to 0-2-0.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Sakic scored Colorado's goals, and Peter Forsberg had two
assists.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 3, San Jose 2 -- Sergei Fedorov scored two power-play
goals, including the game-winner in the third period, as the Red
Wings won at Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Fedorov scored on a five-on-three 2:12 into the third period to
break a 2-2 tie. His one-timer from the top of the right circle beat
goalie Evgeni Nabokov between the pads.</TE>
<TE>   Fedorov has eight goals this season, and five in his last three
games. Jason Williams also scored and Luc Robitaille had two assists
for the defending Stanley Cup champions.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 3, Columbus 2 -- Tyler Arnason deflected in Alexander
Karpovtsev's shot from the point with 6.2 seconds left in the third
period to give the Blackhawks a victory at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Arnason got the game-winner after Alex Zhamnov won a faceoff in
the Columbus zone. Steve Sullivan also scored for Chicago and
assisted on Lyle Odelein's goal. Jocelyn Thibault stopped 20 shots
for his 200th NHL victory.</TE>
<TE>   Jaroslav Spacek and Espen Knutsen scored for Columbus, winless on
the road this season at 0-3. Marc Denis made 19 saves.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 3, New York Islanders 2 -- Landon Wilson batted in a
rebound with 3:31 left to give the Coyotes a comeback victory at
Uniondale, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   The Coyotes won the only regular-season meeting between the teams
and haven't lost to the Islanders since Dec. 6, 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Boucher made 31 saves as Phoenix improved its road record to
4-3-0-1. Mike Johnson and Daniel Briere also scored for the Coyotes,
who are winless at home (0-3).</TE>
<TE>   Carolina 2, New Jersey 1 -- Jeff O'Neill had a goal and an assist
as the Hurricanes again got the best of the Devils in winning at East
Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Weekes made 34 saves and Jaroslav Svoboda also scored as the
Hurricanes beat the Devils for the second time this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Devils' last six losses have all been to Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   The Hurricanes beat them, 4-2, in the first round of the playoffs
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 2, Ottawa 1 -- Keith Primeau scored twice to lead the
Flyers over the Senators at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Flyer goaltender Roman Cechmanek stopped 29 shots, including
several key saves in the final minutes, as Philadelphia remained
unbeaten at home (3-0-1).</TE>
<TE>   Vancouver 1, Buffalo 1 -- Rookie Ales Kotalik scored with 2:39
left in the third period to give the Sabres a tie with the Canucks at
Vancouver, Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Jovanovski scored his first goal of the season for Vancouver in
the second period.</TE>

<LD>I missed Chick.</LD>
<LD>   This is supposed to be a column about Laker opening night, the
ring ceremony, the banner raising, and it will be, in a minute, but
indulge this old fool for a minute.</LD>
<LD>   I missed Chick.</LD>
<TE>   His widow Marge was at midcourt. His voice was coming out of the
scoreboard.</TE>
<TE>   His name is on every championship ring.</TE>
<TE>   But there was no spotlight on his seat, no pre-game introduction,
no standing ovation, no him.</TE>
<TE>   On a night of connections between a glorious past and promising
future, the most important one was absent, Chick Hearn having died
last summer and the pain returning anew.</TE>
<TE>   "I kept looking up there," said Marge.</TE>
<TE>   "But I know if he was looking back, he just would have been
laughing at me."</TE>
<TE>   Jack was there, Dyan was there, Lawrence Tanter was booming
through the public-address system, shoes were squeaking, Kobe was
scowling.</TE>
<TE>   But I wondered what Chick would be saying.</TE>
<TE>   I wondered if he would have said something funny when announcing
Rick Fox's name during the ring ceremony, maybe beg him not to belt
Doug Christie with it.</TE>
<TE>   I wondered if he would have said something cute about newly shaven
Phil Jackson, who showed up looking about 10 years younger, a
take-this-Red-Auerbach look.</TE>
<TE>   I wondered if he would have complimented the wardrobe of Shaquille
O'Neal, who stunningly showed up wearing a suit that contained not a
single green polka dot.</TE>
<TE>   Then the game started, and I wondered what he would say about the
Lakers' misshapen attack. Without O'Neal and Fox, they were
overmatched inside against the San Antonio Spurs, and looked like a
team that will struggle for the next couple of weeks, and Chick would
have had fun with that, no?</TE>
<TE>   Finally, late in the second quarter, when Soumaila Samake replaced
Samaki Walker, I wonder if Chick would simply spike his mike.</TE>
<TE>   It was indeed a night of celebration and remembrance.</TE>
<TE>   The pre-game ceremony started with Commissioner David Stern
honoring a memory by saying, "Chick, let's give out the rings."</TE>
<TE>   It ended with a splendid surprise that may have some people still
stunned.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, that was Randy Newman playing the piano at midcourt.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, he was singing that song.</TE>
<TE>   Three times the sellout Staples Center crowd sang, "We love it!"
as Newman played the "I Love L.A." song that has become a center of
this town's championship fabric.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers play it after wins. The Dodgers play it after wins. The
Kings play it after wins.</TE>
<TE>   Yet this was the first time Newman, a longtime L.A. resident, has
ever played it live at a sports event.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have pursued him before, yet he has always been busy.</TE>
<TE>   "His song is woven into the fabric of every Laker victory, it ties
everything together, he is the perfect person for this," said Tim
Harris, Laker vice president.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been chasing him for a long time."</TE>
<TE>   This time, with children Patrick, 10, and Alicea, 9, becoming
Laker fans, Newman found the time.</TE>
<TE>   "My kids are old enough now to appreciate it, and I think it would
be kind of neat," he said, sitting appropriately rumpled in a locker
room before his performance. "I never had any idea it would get this
kind of response when I wrote the song, but it's really nice."</TE>
<TE>   Newman acknowledged that the song, released in 1983, pokes fun at
parts of L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not exactly a chamber of commerce song," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, there's a bum in it."</TE>
<TE>   But he said he's gratified that the locals not only understand it,
but celebrate it.</TE>
<TE>   "The people here get it, and I'm proud of that," he said. "I think
the song sets the place right."</TE>
<TE>   There's only one problem with the song, according to Newman.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really a Clipper fan, but they won't play it," he said,
laughing.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess because the Lakers got it first."</TE>
<TE>   The only thing more surprising than the song was the shoes.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant, currently without a contract, showed up wearing Air
Jordans.</TE>
<TE>   Does this mean that Michael Jordan has to play his first game with
the Wizards wearing ugly yellow shoes?</TE>
<TE>   Yet the more things change, the more they ... well, you know.</TE>
<TE>   The loudest ovation during the ring ceremony wasn't for the game's
best coach or best two players, but for Robert Horry.</TE>
<TE>   In case anybody here was wondering why, early in the fourth
quarter of their eventual 87-82 loss to the Spurs, Horry made that
same weird, wonderful, top-of-the-key-and-to-the-moon three-pointer
again.</TE>
<TE>   Earning the evening's second loudest ovation.</TE>

<HD>Jackson Is Positively Back to Old Tricks With Lakers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So I read in the newspapers that Phil Jackson, the big lug who sits
on the Laker bench doing nothing until it's time to stand up every
year and accept another ring, wants to finally make himself useful
and work as spokesman for the Positive Coaching Alliance.</LD>
<LD>   This comes on the heels of telling everyone the Lakers "could get
off to an 0-7 start this season," and so right away I'm wondering if
he's positive about this.</LD>
<LD>   "It could be 1-6 or 2-5," he says Tuesday night before the Lakers'
season officially begins, and I'm sure that ought to fire up the guys
knowing Phil feels better about their chances of winning a game or
two.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW BACK in his sitting-Bulls' days when Phil perfected the art of
doing nothing while watching Michael Jordan make him look so smart,
Jackson read the book: "Positive Coaching: Building Character and
Self Esteem through Sports." I'm guessing Mike Ditka wasn't the
author.</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, according to this book, a coach should be promoting a 5-1
praise-criticism ratio, which probably explains why sometimes Jackson
just sits there doing nothing: Do you think you could think of five
positive things to say to Isaiah Rider?</TE>
<TE>   "We have 40 million kids playing youth sports in this country,"
Phil is quoted as saying in the newspaper, "yet PCA's research shows
70% stop by age 13, many citing the win-at-all-costs experience."</TE>
<TE>   I've always thought the Lakers could go 82-0 if they elected to
play hard every night, but there's never been an attempt here to win
at all costs during the regular season, and now we know why.</TE>
<TE>   It'd be tough to win in the playoffs if Kobe or Shaq quit because
they were tired of being pushed to succeed by a mean coach.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I WAS watching TV the other night and Jeanie Buss was on and
talking about how her boyfriend didn't get a single vote when it came
to picking the NBA coach of the year last season. I've never received
a vote for writer of the year, and the wife hasn't said a word in my
defense. She hasn't read any of my columns either, and that's
probably a good thing.</TE>
<TE>   Jeanie, of course, is just trying to butter up Phil in the hopes
he might coach the U.S. Olympic team, take her to Greece in 2004 and
see the sights. How much coaching do you think there's going to be
when it comes to a bunch of professional All-Stars? Talk about a job
tailor-made for Phil</TE>
<TE>   If Jeanie's arithmetic is correct, Phil has received one vote over
the last two years when it comes to coach-of-the-year balloting, and
I had no idea Jeanie was allowed to vote. Since it's pretty obvious
he doesn't do anything much of the year, I asked Phil why he should
be getting a ring.</TE>
<TE>   "The coach-of-the-year award is based on the regular season," he
said, and while he has been with the Lakers, his team has a .736
winning percentage in the regular season -- averaging nearly 22
losses a season with Kobe and Shaq on his side.</TE>
<TE>   He has a .776 mark in the playoffs -- including three consecutive
titles.</TE>
<TE>   Now you would figure regular-season games would be easier to win
than playoff contests, but this guy has been in charge of the team
that has won it all nine of the last 12 years.</TE>
<TE>   I guess that tells you when it comes to winning at all costs,
Phil's the coach of the year, and everyone else in the NBA might as
well just call it quits.</TE>
<TE>   The only concern now is the Lakers don't go 0-82 in the regular
season and miss the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ON PAGE A15 in The Times on Monday, there was a very nice JC
Penney ad congratulating the Angels and showing World Series Angels'
T-shirts with this offer in small print: "Commemorative World Series
Championship Baseball is yours FREE with any $30 Giants' purchase."
You've got to buy $30 of Giants' junk to get a free baseball -- hold
me back.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ON PAGE A24 in The Times' on Monday, there was a very nice
Robinsons-May ad congratulating the Angels and displaying "limited
edition Waterford Crystal" baseball bats and caps with each numbered
and including a certificate of authenticity. Only one problem: The
logo pictured on the crystal Angels' cap is last year's logo --
making them real collector's items.</TE>
<TE>   Robinsons-May issued a release, after several Angel fans brought
it to the attention of operators taking orders, explaining the
official Waterford crystal caps will include the "new" Angels' logo
when orders are filled. It'll only cost you $165 to be sure.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DAVID H. e-mailed to ask: "Just out of curiosity, how is it that
UCLA's basketball coach, several young girls and a good portion of
his team are in field box seats for Game 6 of the World Series? At
$145 a seat, that would seem a little high for a student to afford on
their stipend."</TE>
<TE>   So I asked Coach Steve Lavin, and he had an explanation. He said
none of his current players were with him when he attended the game.
He said he treated his girlfriend, her friends, several former
players and a former team manager to the field level seats. I would
imagine his current players were back on campus in study hall.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE NICE thing about Disney owning the Angels -- I'm sure Disney
just deducted the cost of admission to Disneyland and California
Adventure from the players' paychecks before they entered each park
to ride in the parade.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Dale Red:</TE>
<TE>   "The most illuminating information to come out of Fox's World
Series broadcasts was total accumulated miles of Bonds' career home
runs. I think it was 42 or 43. Why do I need to know this? Who could
possibly keep track?"</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Ross Porter is really the brains behind Fox.</TE>

<LD>The United States all but mathematically secured its place in the
semifinals of the CONCACAF Women's Gold Cup by shutting out Trinidad
and Tobago, 3-0, at Cal State Fullerton's Titan Stadium on Tuesday
night.</LD>
<LD>   In the second game of the doubleheader, Mexico got back into the
hunt for a place in the final four with a 5-1 victory over Panama.</LD>
<LD>   The Americans out-shot the islanders, 30-1, but only Cindy Parlow
in the 19th minute, Brandi Chastain in the 54th and Tiffeny Milbrett
in the 62nd beat Trinidad and Tobago goalkeeper Lisa Jo Ramkissoon.</LD>
<TE>   Most shots flew high and wide, with a Cat Reddick drive from
distance that hit the crossbar and another effort by Shannon
MacMillan that glanced off the right post being the closest anyone
else came to scoring.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate to say it, but when you are a weak country in terms of
women's soccer as Trinidad and Tobago is, a 3-0 defeat to the United
States is indeed a victory for us," said Trinidad and Tobago Coach
Jamaal Shabazz.</TE>
<TE>   The game, played before a crowd of 4,210, was marred by an injury
to Mia Hamm shortly before halftime when she collided with Ramkissoon
while both were going for the ball. Hamm was writhing in pain for
some time, clutching her right ankle. She later limped off the field
and was taken to a hospital for X-rays.</TE>
<TE>   National Call</TE>
<TE>   U.S. men's Coach Bruce Arena called 23 players into camp Tuesday,
including the Galaxy's Danny Califf and Sasha Victorine, to prepare
for the national team's first game since the World Cup -- against El
Salvador in Washington on Nov. 17.</TE>
<TE>   All 23 players are from Major League Soccer teams and 11 have
never represented the U.S. before at the full international level,
although several have played for the U.S. under-20 national team or
the U.S. Olympic team.</TE>
<TE>   Only four World Cup players -- DaMarcus Beasley, Landon Donovan,
Pablo Mastroeni and Clint Mathis -- were called up to begin training
in Washington on Nov. 10.</TE>
<TE>   None of the 16 U.S. national players based in Europe were on the
roster, although two of the players who were chosen, goalkeeper Tim
Howard and former UCLA defender Carlos Bocanegra, are training with
Feyenoord in the Netherlands.</TE>
<TE>   The average age of the roster is just under 24, and Arena clearly
is looking at players who will be at their peak in 2006, when the
World Cup is held in Germany.</TE>
<TE>   "The challenge of building a team capable of qualifying for the
World Cup begins again," he said. "There are a lot of talented young
players with great potential in MLS, and over the course of the next
two years we plan to provide them with quality international
experience in order to evaluate who can compete at the international
level."</TE>
<TE>   The roster:</TE>
<TE>   Goalkeepers: Adin Brown, Howard and Nick Rimando.</TE>
<TE>   Defenders: Wade Barrett, Bocanegra, Califf, Brian Dunseth, Chad
McCarty, Eddie Robinson and Ryan Suarez.</TE>
<TE>   Midfielders: Beasley, Leo Cullen, Daniel Hernandez, Chris Klein,
Kyle Marino, Mastroeni, Ben Olsen, Eric Quill and Victorine.</TE>
<TE>   Forwards: Jeff Cunningham, Donovan, Mathis and Taylor Twellman.</TE>
<TE>   Champions League</TE>
<TE>   Former champion Juventus and last season's runner-up, Bayer
Leverkusen, each earned shutout victories and became the fourth and
fifth teams to advance to the final 16 of the European Champions
League, but another former winner, Bayern Munich, crashed out of the
competition.</TE>
<TE>   Juventus was outplayed for large stretches of its match in Turin
by Feyenoord, but came away with a 2-0 victory on goals in each half
by forward Marco Di Vaio.</TE>
<TE>   Bayer Leverkusen, which had been embarrassed, 6-2, by Olympiakos
in Greece earlier in the tournament, gained revenge at home with a
2-0 victory in Germany that not only clinched its place in the next
round but eliminated the Greek team with a 14th-minute goal from
Brazilian forward Juan and a last-minute penalty kick goal by Bernd
Schneider.</TE>
<TE>   Four-time champion Bayern Munich, needing to beat Deportivo La
Coruna in Spain or be eliminated, fell, 2-1, in heavy rain. Victor
gave Deportivo the lead 10 minutes into the second half, but
Paraguayan forward Roque Santa Cruz tied it up in the 77th minute.

<HD>When They Reign, It Pours</HD>
<DH>Angel title is the latest in a recent run of local
championships</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Wharton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From Santa Clarita to San Juan Capistrano, there is a glow these days
that has nothing to do with sunshine.</LD>
<LD>   Switchboards are lighting up at radio stations across the region,
fans calling sports talk shows, still buzzing over the Angels winning
the World Series.</LD>
<LD>   In a victory parade Tuesday, Mike Scioscia and the players carried
their sparkling new trophy down the streets of Anaheim.</LD>
<TE>   Add that glossy hardware to trophies won in recent seasons by the
Lakers, Galaxy and Sparks -- even the Xtreme of the defunct XFL --
and you know what the glow is all about.</TE>
<TE>   The Southland, which went a dozen years between major
championships, has become Title Town.</TE>
<TE>   Or Title Towns.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to do this every year," Angel reliever Troy Percival told
thousands of fans gathered at Edison Field for Tuesday's celebration.</TE>
<TE>   This sentiment echoed across the county line at Staples Center,
where Laker guard Brian Shaw said: "It's a fun type of pressure. The
next team wants to keep it going."</TE>
<TE>   If momentum has spread from team to team, it has been fueled by
equal parts inspiration and envy. Just ask Galaxy players who lost in
the Major League Soccer Cup three times before finally winning the
title last week.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course we noticed it when the Lakers were winning and we
weren't," Galaxy midfielder Peter Vagenas said. "We watched those
parades."</TE>
<TE>   Front offices notice too.</TE>
<TE>   A successful team across town is a potential boon to everyone
because it grabs the attention of casual fans and new sponsors, gets
them thinking about sports. But local teams, no matter which game
they play, compete against each other for fans' discretionary income.</TE>
<TE>   "You have the guy who tells his wife, 'Honey, I want to go to the
Lakers game,' " said David Carter of the Sports Business Group, a Los
Angeles consulting firm. "She says, 'OK, honey, but then we can't
afford those tickets for the Dodgers.' "</TE>
<TE>   While players and executives ponder over such matters, a larger
question emerges: Has the recent string of titles done anything to
improve the quality of life in Orange County and Los Angeles?</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials say that beyond isolated incidents -- a
riot outside Staples, a stabbing death near Edison -- the crime rate
does not change when teams win.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County mental health administrators see no rise or
drop in incidents of people requiring emergency care at their
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   In business terms, winning teams certainly profit from the
postseason. The Angels figure to make as much as $7 million from
ticket sales, concessions and parking from the postseason. But it is
hard to prove the economic impact extends beyond the franchise, the
stadium or arena and a few nearby businesses.</TE>
<TE>   So why do outside observers get excited about winning teams?</TE>
<TE>   "There's certainly a lot to be said for what a championship does
for the community in terms of pride and self-worth and self-esteem,"
said Peter Roby, director of Northeastern University's Center for the
Study of Sport in Society.</TE>
<TE>   People start wearing team colors around town. They chat in bars,
barbershops and grocery stores. Flags fly from homes and cars.</TE>
<TE>   "Our city has been electrified the entire month of October,"
Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly said. "Our community has never been so united
and so excited."</TE>
<TE>   The bonding extends beyond city limits.</TE>
<TE>   Though Orange County might be savoring this victory as all its
own, something it can hold apart from neighboring Los Angeles,
geographical distinctions blur when it comes to sports.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County residents cheer for the Lakers. The Angel bandwagon
is carrying more than a few Dodger fans.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe that we've taken calls about the Angels from West
L.A. and the Valley," said Doug Krikorian, a talk show host at KSPN
(1110) sports radio and columnist for the Long Beach Press-Telegram.
"Usually West L.A. and the Valley could care less about Orange
County."</TE>
<TE>   Angel first baseman Scott Spiezio recently said: "As long as
they're supporting us, I don't care when they came on."</TE>
<TE>   In a vast and often fragmented metropolis, a story like the
Angels' playoff run gives millions of people an opportunity to share
a common sentiment, which can make a difference on a personal level.</TE>
<TE>   "Sports events bring us together as a community," said Dr.
Roderick Shaner, medical director of the Los Angeles County
Department of Mental Health. "Strong communities are associated with
a better quality of life, a decrease in stress. These are good
feelings and benefits that come from great sports events."</TE>
<TE>   Such benefits cannot be measured. Maybe, as several experts
suggested, we merely want to believe they exist.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe the best way to understand the glow that has come over
the Southland is to look back a few years.</TE>
<TE>   "We had become spoiled by the success of the Rams and the Dodgers
in the '70s," Krikorian said. "USC was always a national championship
contender. We had Showtime with Magic in the '80s and we had the
Raiders."</TE>
<TE>   Then the winning stopped. People called Krikorian's show wondering
why the nation's second-biggest market could not produce a title.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until recently this frustration was replaced by joy.</TE>
<TE>   "The big thing is, and I've said this on the air, I've never seen
a reaction like the Angels have inspired," Krikorian said. "They're a
likable team, but I think a lot of it is due to that terrible
drought."</TE>
<TE>   The situation could be even better -- "We're missing a football
team," Laker forward Rick Fox said -- but with so much celebrating
the last few seasons, Roby believes sport is serving a valuable
function: helping people forget, even for a moment, the worries of
the real world.</TE>
<TE>   "What's the alternative?" he said. "If the newspapers and
television stations and radio stations weren't covering the victory,
they would probably be talking about crime or budget cuts or people
losing their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "This definitely makes life a little better."</TE>

<LD>Competition at quarterback could last a week. Or it could last four
years.</LD>
<LD>   The principals in the race, UCLA freshmen Matt Moore and Drew
Olson, cringe at the thought of the latter.</LD>
<LD>   "I think we want a starting quarterback, we don't want an ongoing
battle," Olson said. "The decision will be made by our performance on
the field."</LD>
<TE>   Both quarterbacks downplayed what is perceived to be their
question marks.</TE>
<TE>   Olson, who injured his right shoulder against California on Oct.
19, experienced soreness Tuesday, but he is pleased with his arm
strength and accuracy.</TE>
<TE>   Moore, who played for the first time Saturday and directed the
Bruins to a victory over Stanford, believes he understands the
offense as well as Olson.</TE>
<TE>   "Drew is going to make me better and I'm going to make him
better," Moore said. "Whoever starts, starts."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bruin quarterback-receiver Josh Roenicke might be the only person
in the Southland to turn down an invitation to the seventh game of
the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   His parents had two tickets courtesy of his uncle, Angel third
base coach Ron Roenicke, so his father, former major leaguer Gary
Roenicke, offered to let Josh go in his place.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a nice offer, but I thought he should go," Josh said.</TE>
<TE>   Roenicke, who plans to walk on the UCLA baseball team in the
spring, is content with having attended the Angels' 13-5 victory over
the Minnesota Twins in the final game of the American League
championship series.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, and there was the day last summer he and teammate Spencer
Havner took batting practice at Edison Field with Angel Manager Mike
Scioscia pitching.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a great day, I won't forget that," Roenicke said.</TE>

<HD>Fargas to Start Against Stanford</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tailback Sultan McCullough ranks fifth in the Pacific 10 Conference
in rushing, but the senior is No. 2 on the Trojan depth chart after
Justin Fargas' performance against Oregon.</LD>
<LD>   McCullough gained 176 yards in 39 carries on Oct. 12 against
California and leads the Trojans with 562 yards. Fargas, however,
rushed for 139 yards in 27 carries in his first start against the
Ducks.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Pete Carroll indicated Tuesday that Fargas will start Nov. 9
against Stanford.</LD>
<TE>   "The guys play best when they play a lot," Carroll said. "Sultan
did well with his opportunity and Justin did well with his. We'll go
through these two weeks and see where we are, but I would think that
Justin, coming off his game, he'll have the first shot."</TE>
<TE>   McCullough, the Trojans' leading rusher the last two seasons, said
he found out Oct. 22 that he was not starting against Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to get an attitude -- I'm a team player and it's
all about winning," said McCullough, who gained 16 yards in two
carries against the Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just like you have two Porsches. One's white and one's red.
You have to choose which one you want to drive."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans had a field-goal attempt and extra-point attempt
blocked against Oregon, so Carroll had 16 to 20 players rush the
kicker during drills.... Freshman middle linebacker Oscar Lua was
expected to sit out at least a week because of a sprained left ankle,
but Lua worked with the first team in place of senior Mike Pollard,
who has a hip-pointer.... Receiver Mike Williams limped to the
sideline after getting tangled with cornerback William Buchanon
during a drill. Williams also went down on his next turn against
cornerback Marcell Allmond, but finished practice without further
incident.... Kicker David Davis, who has a sore right foot, did not
take part in drills and said he was scheduled to see a doctor after
practice.... Receiver Jason Mitchell, who was expected to be a
redshirt after hurting his back, said he will try to play against
Stanford.</TE>

<HD>Jail Sentence Is Overturned in LAPD Case</HD>
<DH>A whistle-blower who violated a court order by giving
documents about police abuse of spouses to a reporter was convicted
of contempt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Henry Weinstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court Tuesday overturned the sentence of a man
convicted of contempt of court for leaking documents that led the Los
Angeles Police Department to reform the way it disciplines officers
who commit domestic violence.</LD>
<LD>   But the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 3-0 that Robert
Mullally, 58, did violate a court order when he gave a television
reporter copies of LAPD documents that showed the department had
failed to discipline officers who beat and in some cases raped wives
and girlfriends.</LD>
<LD>   The court directed that Mullally be resentenced, stressing an
earlier recommendation for probation.</LD>
<TE>   Mullally had access to the documents because he was an expert
witness hired by a lawyer who sued the department on behalf of Melba
Ramos, who had been murdered by her husband, an LAPD officer.</TE>
<TE>   The Ramos lawsuit alleged that the LAPD routinely failed to act on
complaints of domestic violence by its officers.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the suit, the LAPD turned over documents on officers
who engaged in domestic violence and the department's response -- on
the condition that they not be made public before trial. The case was
settled for $2.2 million without a trial.</TE>
<TE>   Mullally gave the files to a television reporter who aired stories
on officers who attacked their wives, breaking bones, but against
whom the LAPD took no action.</TE>
<TE>   The reporting prompted reforms after an internal LAPD
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   But after Chief Bernard C. Parks lodged a complaint with the
California Bar Assn., U.S. District Judge William D. Keller ordered
the U.S. attorney's office to investigate. Mullally admitted that he
was the source.</TE>
<TE>   Keller found Mullally guilty of criminal contempt for violating
the protective order. Keller sentenced Mullally to 60 days in jail,
even though Assistant U.S. Atty. Thomas D. Warren recommended
probation.</TE>
<TE>   The Fund for the Feminist Majority and the American Civil
Liberties Union came to Mullally's aid, arguing that if he were
jailed, he would be the first person ever imprisoned for violating a
protective order in a civil lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit Court upheld Mullally's conviction, even though it
found that the protective order was unclear. The appellate judges
said that under Supreme Court precedents, Mullally is legally barred
from challenging the validity of the order after he violated it.</TE>
<TE>   Mullally could have legally challenged the order, the court noted.</TE>
<TE>   But the federal appeals judges vacated the sentence because two
paragraphs of the protective order were vague, and because Keller
erroneously concluded that the whistle-blower was motivated by ego
when he gave the files to a reporter.</TE>
<TE>   The appellate judges -- Alfred T. Goodwin, Pamela A. Rymer and M.
Margaret McKeown -- sent the case back to Keller for resentencing,
hinting strongly that Mullally should not be imprisoned:</TE>
<TE>   "We ... note that the government advised the district court that
sentencing Mullally to imprisonment would be extreme, and that some
term of probation would be appropriate given the circumstances. We
are confident that the district court will give serious consideration
to this recommendation on remand."</TE>
<TE>   Mullally, who now works as a substitute teacher in Cedar Rapids,
Iowa, said he was "grateful" that the 9th Circuit Court vacated the
jail sentence. But he said he remained disturbed by the idea that
"it's OK for a federal judge to hide evidence of felony crimes with
the application of a protective order."</TE>
<TE>   New York University law professor Stephen Gillers, an expert on
court procedures, applauded the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "Sending [Mullally] to jail would be spiteful and unnecessary,"
Gillers said. Though there are valid reasons for courts to enforce
protective orders, Mullally's actions "corrected a malfunction" in
how the LAPD deals with domestic violence, Gillers said. "That ought
to count for something" when it comes to sentencing, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. attorney's office declined to comment. No date has been
set for the resentencing hearing.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Neil Bogart Memorial Fund has made a promise of $12 million to
Childrens Hospital Los Angeles for cancer research, the largest
single gift from a foundation that the hospital has received,
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, the hospital dedicated the Neil Bogart Pediatric Cancer
Research Program, which will get $9 million of the gift over the next
six years.</LD>
<LD>   The gift "is a beautiful commitment to us," said Ken Wildes, a

<LD>After touring a Northridge home with toxic mold infestation,
insurance commissioner candidate John Garamendi said Tuesday he would
work to boost construction standards and protect homeowners whose
policies are canceled after filing a claim.</LD>
<LD>   Joined by consumer activist Erin Brockovich, Garamendi said mold
problems are made worse by insurance companies that process claims
too slowly, allowing mold to spread.</LD>
<LD>   Garamendi, examined the home of Laura and Rob Boles. Started by a
leaky shower valve, the mold spread to the kitchen, causing $45,000
in damage.</LD>

<HD>Capps' Poll Gives Her 24-Point Lead</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Catherine Saillant</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new poll commissioned by Rep. Lois Capps (D-Santa Barbara) shows
the two-term incumbent leading her well-funded Republican opponent,
Carpinteria businesswoman Beth Rogers, 56% to 32%.</LD>
<LD>   The Capps campaign released the poll results Tuesday, apparently
to rebut recent comments by GOP strategists that a Rogers upset in
the Nov. 5 election is not out of the question.</LD>
<LD>   Rogers' campaign manager, Bob Tapella, refused to release Rogers'
own poll numbers. But he said the 24-point advantage in the Capps
poll will not cause Rogers to change her strategy.</LD>
<TE>   "We are trying to take out an entrenched incumbent, and we have
known that from the beginning," Tapella said. "Whatever the poll
shows, it won't affect what we will be doing between now and election
day, which is talking to voters about why they should vote for Beth
Rogers."</TE>
<TE>   Capps' poll shows 65% of Latino voters preferred her. That would
be a blow to Rogers, a fluent Spanish-speaker who has presented
herself to the 23rd District's large Latino population as a moderate
alternative .</TE>
<TE>   Rogers, from a fourth-generation Ventura County farming family,
has raised $1.44 million to battle Capps, half of it from her own
wallet. Capps has raised $1.34 million.</TE>
<TE>   The 220-mile-long coastal district, stretching from San Luis
Obispo to Port Hueneme, has become safer than ever for a Democrat
after last year's redistricting.</TE>
<TE>   In the survey, pollsters Garin-Hart-Yang interviewed 411 likely
voters Oct. 23 and 24. The survey has a 4.9% margin of error.</TE>

<HD>Learning What Lies 'Beyond the Headlines'</HD>
<DH>A popular UCLA Extension lecture series satisfies students'
hunger for knowledge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rebecca Trounson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The regulars start trickling in 30 minutes or more before class,
impatient to launch the day's discussion on terrorism, secession,
Indonesia or the volatile Middle East.</LD>
<LD>   These eager, often-opinionated students, many with white or
graying hair, greet longtime acquaintances, pour their coffee and
settle in, ready for another session of the weekly world affairs
class that some have been attending for nearly 40 years.</LD>
<LD>   "We're news groupies," explained Gert Trauring, a longtime student
who helps out by checking names off as others arrive. "We can't get
answers to our questions from the people we watch on the news shows.
Here, we get our answers."</LD>
<TE>   The Sept. 11 attacks and other sobering events of the past few
years have prompted many Americans to increase their knowledge of
national and international affairs. But participants in this class,
one of the longest-running for UCLA Extension, needed no such
impetus.</TE>
<TE>   The lecture series, known now as "Beyond the Headlines: The World
Today," was launched in 1964. Then as now, its aim was to help
participants gain insight into issues and areas of global -- and
occasionally local -- tension and to learn their implications.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Tuesday morning, for example, class members had come
to hear a political science professor from Cal State Fullerton,
Raphael Sonenshein, lecture on efforts by the San Fernando Valley and
Hollywood to secede from Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   They listened attentively as Sonenshein, an expert in Southern
California politics, led them through the history of the breakaway
movements and up to the pending vote.</TE>
<TE>   Then the questions began. Would the secession vote affect public
schools, a man in the second row asked. (It won't, said Sonenshein.)
And what about the borough idea, one woman asked? Doesn't the very
term carry its own East Coast baggage, reminding everyone of corrupt
big-city politics? (Yes, agreed the professor. "Maybe we could have
called them 'intermediate-level city governments' or 'absolutely not
New York-style boroughs,' " he joked.)</TE>
<TE>   Later, Sonenshein praised the group's lively interest and informed
questions, which he said compared favorably with those of his college
students. "It's such a pleasure to lecture to an audience like this,"
the professor said. "It really reminds me of why I do political
science."</TE>
<TE>   Many speakers react similarly, said Max Epstein, dean emeritus of
UCLA's international students and scholars, who has acted as
moderator for the class for the last five years.</TE>
<TE>   "A couple have said they just wish their students at UCLA were so
lively," he said. "These are people who read, who travel and who ask
challenging questions. It's a kick for speakers to have that kind of
audience."</TE>
<TE>   The first sessions of the class were held in the tearoom of the
Bullocks Wilshire store in Westwood, where young mothers like
Trauring gathered with their friends for intellectual "mornings out,"
away from their children.</TE>
<TE>   "It was wonderful, a time for us to speak to each other as adults,
about adult things," said Trauring. Many students have stayed with
"Beyond the Headlines" through changes in moderator, title and venue,
moving along with it from the tearoom to a local synagogue, to a
series of private homes, to a church and now, to a UCLA Extension
building in the heart of Westwood.</TE>
<TE>   When the course went on hiatus last year while administrators
searched for better, less expensive classroom space, many of its
loyalists wrote or called UCLA Extension to appeal for its speedy
return.</TE>
<TE>   "The same names are on the list year after year," said Eve
Haberfield, who helps oversee the program as a director at UCLA
Extension, which offers 4,500 courses a year. "And when we put it on
hold, the same loyal people said, 'No, no, you have to give us our
course back.' "</TE>
<TE>   This fall they did, housing it in a large, airy classroom big
enough to accommodate the 100 students who signed up and a handful of
extras who show up regularly for individual sessions, paying $15 at
the door. (The full series costs $70 for seniors and college
students, $90 for others.)</TE>
<TE>   Most class members are retired, although occasionally there is a
smattering of younger people sent by their professors to hear a
particularly well-known speaker. At least a handful of participants
have taken the class, at least intermittently, since the beginning;
many others have attended for a dozen years or more.</TE>
<TE>   Many, like Gertrude Shinbane, 85, take notes, although the course
is not for credit and no one is ever tested. "It helps me remember
all the interesting things I'm learning," said Shinbane, a retired
Santa Monica bookkeeper who often sits in the front row.</TE>
<TE>   Shinbane, who was among the course's original students in the
mid-1960s, arranges her active volunteer schedule around the class.</TE>
<TE>   "I enjoy talking with all these people interested in something
besides cards, bingo or shopping," she said. "And being as old as
most of us are, it's a great way to keep our minds active and make us
better informed."</TE>
<TE>   Shinbane and others applaud the work of UCLA Extension official
Elizabeth Brooks, who often draws academics from UCLA, USC, the Rand
Corp. and other institutions as speakers during the eight-week
series.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, many participants say, they have introduced
friends and colleagues to the course. Others, like Mike Zweig, 79,
make a practice of going from the lectures to meet lunch partners,
who often quiz them on what they've learned.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to review the class for them every Tuesday," Zweig
complained jokingly of his friends. "They want to know all the
details. I really ought to charge them."</TE>
<TE>   Zweig, who has been attending the class for 12 years, said he
missed out on graduate school because he joined the Army Air Forces
during World War II. Like many of his classmates, he said, "I never
really had enough of going to school."</TE>

<LD>The Los Angeles County district attorney's office is investigating
whether City Council members in several outlying municipalities have
been illegally using government credit cards to pay the dinner tabs
of people they meet to discuss government business, according to a
top county prosecutor.</LD>
<LD>   The investigations stem from citizen complaints in three or four
cities, not including the city of Los Angeles, said David E.
Demerjian, head of the district attorney's public integrity division.
Demerjian said the complaints allege that officials "are using City
Council credit cards for personal stuff, and that a lot of it is for
dinners." The questionable expenditures amount to a "few hundred
dollars per month on each card," he said, declining to reveal further
details.</LD>
<LD>   If convicted, council members would be forbidden to ever again
hold public office and could be sentenced to up to four years in
prison.</LD>
<TE>   The existence of the inquiry emerged last week as a result of an
official legal opinion issued by the California attorney general's
office in response to a question from Demerjian's office.</TE>
<TE>   The D.A. asked whether municipalities can reimburse city officials
for their expenses in buying meals for constituents, legislators,
business owners or others "at meetings held to discuss legislation or
other matters of benefit to the city."</TE>
<TE>   The legal opinion said general law cities cannot use public funds
for such purposes, while charter cities, such as Los Angeles, can if
their charters permit it. General law cities are ruled by state
codes; charter cities are governed by a locally written charter.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney general's opinion is not binding, Demerjian said.
"But we can use its reasoning if we decide to go into court and file
charges."</TE>
<TE>   Demerjian said the complaints involve general law and charter
cities that do not expressly authorize using credit cards to pay for
others' meals.</TE>

<KH>THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR</KH>
<HD>Davis, Simon Both Claim Mantle of Schools' Savior</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Duke Helfand</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ask Gov. Gray Davis why he deserves a second term and he'll tell you
that he kept his word with California voters: public school test
scores have risen steadily since he took office.</LD>
<LD>   "For the first time in decades, California's schools are showing
real improvement," he says.</LD>
<LD>   But Republican challenger Bill Simon Jr. believes that Davis'
education policies have failed, particularly for students in the
state's worst schools.</LD>
<TE>   "There has been marginal improvement ... but it's not the type
that anyone should be proud of," he says.</TE>
<TE>   As the Nov. 5 election approaches, both candidates are trying to
position themselves as saviors of public education -- the top issue,
according to polls, in the minds of California voters.</TE>
<TE>   Davis is capitalizing on the rising Stanford 9 test scores,
repeatedly emphasizing the upbeat news in television commercials and
on the campaign trail.</TE>
<TE>   What he doesn't tell voters is that the pace of improvement has
slowed and that California students look far less impressive on
separate tests linked to the state's new academic standards. Those
results show that just one-third of students are proficient in
reading, math, history and science -- a subpar performance that
educators chalk up to tests that are both highly challenging and new.</TE>
<TE>   Vow to Press Ahead</TE>
<TE>   The governor said he would press forward with reforms he set in
motion over the last three years. They include teacher recruitment
and training programs, a new high school exit exam and an
accountability system that ranks campuses by their test scores and
punishes schools that continually falter.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said he would also do his best to once again protect
education funding during difficult budget years ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Simon says he wants to empower parents, teachers and their schools
by freeing them from the state's bureaucratic dictates -- what he
calls the command-and-control culture of Sacramento. He would require
local school leaders to develop their own education plans for their
campuses, complete with goals and budgets. And he advocates expansion
of charter schools.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican candidate also says Davis has not enforced
punishment of all schools that perform poorly.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the two men have found common ground on several key issues.</TE>
<TE>   Both want more financial incentives to attract qualified teachers
to the lowest-performing schools. Both want smaller campuses so
students can get more personal attention.</TE>
<TE>   Both, seeing a need to upgrade the state's aging schools, support
a state bond measure on the November ballot that would raise $13
billion to build new campuses and repair existing ones. And both say
they will try not to raise fees for in-state students at Cal State
and UC campuses.</TE>
<TE>   Budget Crisis</TE>
<TE>   But whoever wins will probably see his education plans held
hostage to California's ongoing budget crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The state's financial woes have already forced Davis and the
Legislature to scale back funding for school libraries and for
programs to retrain ineffective teachers, and have eliminated a
popular tax credit meant to reimburse teachers for spending money for
class supplies out of their own pockets.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has even suspended some of his own pet initiatives,
including multimillion-dollar awards programs for teachers and
schools whose students surpass expectations on state tests.</TE>
<TE>   "If the economy doesn't rebound, everyone is going to be facing
extraordinarily difficult decisions," said Bob Blattner, director of
legislative services for School Services of California, a private
consulting and advocacy organization in Sacramento. "If we don't get
more tax revenues, we're looking at a world of hurt."</TE>
<TE>   Davis vowed early in his administration not to seek reelection
unless Stanford 9 test scores rose. In fact, the scores have gone up
each year since. Now, 45% of students statewide are at or above the
national average in reading, and 55% meet that mark in math. The
results represent a 6-percentage-point gain in reading, and a
13-point gain in math since the test was introduced four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the rate of improvement has slowed: 53% of schools
statewide met their state-set test score targets this year, down from
72% just two years ago. And the results show that a wide achievement
gap continues to separate rich and poor students.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Davis sees reason for celebration.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question we've made great progress," he says. "I'm
very proud that we have laid the groundwork for the restoration of
California's schools to their right place, which is at the top of the
pack."</TE>
<TE>   Simon calls the Stanford 9 test results "false comfort," arguing
that test familiarity and coaching explain part of the gains. He
maintains that the "bottom third of schools are failing."</TE>
<TE>   Simon stresses that California's public school students have done
far worse on tests other than the Stanford 9. He points to results
from the National Assessment of Educational Progress, which rank
California dead last or near last in reading, math and science when
compared to most other states that participated.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look where we stand nationally, we're in the basement,"
Simon said. "We should not rest comfortably. I think we have a long
way to go."</TE>
<TE>   Simon says the answer lies in mandatory accountability for the
lowest-performing schools -- those primarily serving Latino and
African American students.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, these schools have been allowed to voluntarily sign up
for a program that offers extra money but also imposes sanctions --
such as having principals or teachers replaced -- if they fail to
make adequate progress.</TE>
<TE>   Only half of the eligible schools have voluntarily applied over
the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   "To Gray Davis, accountability means a voluntary system where
schools can choose to participate or opt out if they feel like it,"
Simon said. "So does it surprise us to learn that our failing schools
... are choosing to opt out?"</TE>
<TE>   Simon would require all such schools to join, and he would give
them two years to improve -- rather than the three they have been
getting. Those that didn't make progress would have their principals
replaced, and an outside team of experts would be sent to help. (A
separate federal accountability program gives failing schools four
years before they face special scrutiny.)</TE>
<TE>   Some education analysts say Simon's attacks on Davis and his
policies could fall flat because the governor has been so active on
the issue.</TE>
<TE>   In the first three years of his administration, Davis exceeded the
basic levels of education funding required by state law by cutting
social services, state government operations and other programs. This
year, while making some trims, he avoided major cuts to schools even
with the budget gap.</TE>
<TE>   "Education is probably the strongest part of the governor's
record. It's not a place where he is vulnerable," said Kevin Gordon,
executive director of the California Assn. of School Business
Officials, which has not endorsed either candidate. "The governor has
a real track record on these issues. Bill Simon has no place to
maneuver."</TE>
<TE>   But Davis' policies have also attracted critics, most notably the
state's largest teachers union.</TE>
<TE>   The California Teachers Assn. has assailed Davis' teacher awards
program, now suspended because of the budget problems, as divisive
and has said his accountability system places too much importance on
standardized tests.</TE>
<TE>   CTA leaders also were angry with Davis this year for opposing a
bill that would have given local unions the right to bargain over
textbooks, curriculum and other classroom issues. Davis said
collective bargaining is the wrong forum for such decisions. The bill
later died.</TE>
<TE>   Union leaders then publicly embarrassed Davis by saying the
governor had solicited a $1-million donation from the union at a
February meeting in his Capitol office. Davis later said he did not
recall details of that meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Union's Donations Drop</TE>
<TE>   The CTA contributed $2 million to Davis' first gubernatorial
campaign. This year, the union gave him just $10,000. Still, union
leaders are urging their 330,000 members to vote for the Democratic
governor, fearing that Simon's support of charter schools and other
policies would run counter to the union's interests.</TE>
<TE>   "Gray Davis has alienated the teacher base in this state. There's
no enthusiasm for him at all," CTA President Wayne Johnson said. "But
we feel very strongly that it's in our interest to have Davis
reelected."</TE>

<HD>Rudin Faces Long Odds</HD>
<DH>Gallegly's foe has little experience and is vying against a
Republican incumbent in a congressional district with a GOP majority.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Chawkins</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three days before the deadline for filing candidacy papers, Fern
Rudin still was just an interested bystander. But her old friend Don
Katz, a Ventura County Democratic Party official, was at the door,
again urging her to run for Congress against Elton Gallegly.</LD>
<LD>   This time she was compelled to go forward. She was still in tears
from watching an installment of "The Oprah Winfrey Show" on oppressed
Afghan women. And since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, she had felt
an urgent need to do something that would make a difference.</LD>
<LD>   So the 49-year-old Rudin, a first-time candidate, is
optimistically running against a former Simi Valley mayor who is
seeking his ninth term in Congress with a $1-million campaign
treasury at his disposal. Libertarian Gary Harber also is vying for
the office.</LD>
<TE>   "The time is right," Rudin said. "When things are going well and
people's senses are not piqued to a critical point, the status quo is
OK. But that's not the time now -- not following the presidential
election of 2000, not following 9/11."</TE>
<TE>   Gallegly is confident that the 639,000 people in his newly
reconstituted 24th Congressional District would benefit from the
experience of a seasoned lawmaker. He reels off a list of
improvements that he says stem from his efforts in Congress: a new
interchange at Rice Avenue and the Ventura Freeway, a widened Highway
23, new planes for the Air National Guard, funds for local Boys &amp;
Girls Club branches, dredging at Ventura Harbor and high-tech
communications equipment for county police agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had great success," he said. "When you've got a doggone
solid record, people know where you are."</TE>
<TE>   While Gallegly has not made many national headlines besides those
generated by his tough stand against illegal immigration, he says his
lengthy stay in Congress has afforded him "the opportunity to gain
the respect of more folks."</TE>
<TE>   "The [majority] whip will check with me," Gallegly said. "They
don't take my vote for granted."</TE>
<TE>   Gallegly's critics, though, question his effectiveness on the
national stage.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not a very viable congressman," said Katz, a member of the
county's Democratic Central Committee. "You could see it on TV during
the Clinton [impeachment] hearings; when he asked a question, [House
Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry] Hyde ignored him like he wasn't
there."</TE>
<TE>   Democratic officials acknowledge that a Rudin victory over
Gallegly would be a huge upset.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Gallegly handily beat Michael Case, a Ventura attorney
who was widely seen as the strongest challenger Gallegly had faced
since taking office. A founder of the city's largest law firm, Case
poured more than $725,000 in donations and his own funds into his
effort.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Rudin has a treasury that is virtually empty, not
meeting the $5,000 threshold required for reporting to the Federal
Elections Commission. Running her campaign from a kitchen table piled
high with papers, she admitted that she was one of the only local
Democrats willing to face the longtime incumbent on turf made solidly
Republican by redistricting.</TE>
<TE>   In the newly drawn 24th District, Gallegly picks up Thousand Oaks
and inland Santa Barbara County, giving up Oxnard, Carpinteria and
part of Ventura. The changes give Gallegly a majority Republican base
-- 46% GOP to 35% Democratic -- for the first time in a decade.
Previously, his district was split 40% to 39%, with Democrats holding
the edge.</TE>
<TE>   "No one was going to run against Elton," Rudin said. "It was just
something that had to be done."</TE>
<TE>   She contends that Gallegly slights his constituents, spending
insufficient time at events in the district. She also faults him for
what she and other Democrats have seen as a reluctance to debate.</TE>
<TE>   Gallegly scoffs at the accusations. He said he returns to the
district almost every weekend and has engaged in past debates,
although, he acknowledged, they have not been a high priority. In any
event, his record is more important than his rhetorical ability, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Rudin, a self-employed public relations consultant, has not held
or run for office before. However, she has been politically active,
coordinating the Clinton presidential campaign in eastern Ventura
County in 1992 and 1996.</TE>
<TE>   She advocates a universal health-care system, easier access to
prescription drugs, more government emphasis on renewable energy
resources and a restructuring of schools with an eye on how children
actually learn.</TE>
<TE>   Active in a group called Americans United for Separation of Church
and State, she said she supports the deletion of "under God" from the
Pledge of Allegiance.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to be a nation that's inclusive, not exclusive," she
said. "Pushing a deity on people is not how we can be inclusive."</TE>
<TE>   Gallegly was confident that Rudin's conviction wouldn't fly with
voters. "Does she need some money to help get her message out?" he
said jokingly, implying fewer people would vote for her if they knew
her stance on the pledge.</TE>
<TE>   A conservative on most issues, Gallegly has received high grades
from business and agricultural organizations. Groups advocating
environmental and women's causes have given him low ratings.</TE>
<TE>   While most of his campaign contributions come from individuals,
political action committees representing communication, health care,
energy and real estate interests are among his larger donors.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond national security, Gallegly said he intends to focus on a
number of issues, including immigration enforcement and economic
recovery. A separate enforcement agency should be broken out of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, he said. And the government
must boost the economy by encouraging savings, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Libertarian candidate Harber said he wants to end income taxes and
the war on drugs and institute a government that is dramatically
smaller.</TE>
<TE>   Like other Libertarians, Harber believes government in the U.S.
has long since overstepped its bounds. National parks and other
federal lands should be transferred to private control, with citizens
given expanded opportunities to homestead, he says. And U.S. borders
should be open to all immigrants, but most welfare programs for
newcomers and residents alike should cease.</TE>
<TE>   "It comes down to the simple idea that you own yourself," Harber
said.</TE>

<HD>3 Face Trial in Drug Killings</HD>
<DH>Death penalty will be sought in Tennessee against three
alleged L.A. gang members.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal authorities in Tennessee said Tuesday that they will seek the
death penalty against three reputed Los Angeles gang members accused
of killing seven people and wounding a 3-year-old girl, allegedly to
protect a vast drug enterprise.</LD>
<LD>   It was the latest development in an ongoing investigation in which
40 people have been indicted for gang-related drug trafficking, money
laundering and firearms offenses in Los Angeles, Nashville, Oklahoma
and Memphis.</LD>
<LD>   The indictments allege that three members of a notorious Los
Angeles street gang, the Rollin' 90s Crips -- Jamal Shakir, 29; Eben
Payne, 24; and Donnell Young, 27 -- are responsible for the slayings
of six other gang members or associates.</LD>
<TE>   Execution is the appropriate penalty because the crimes were
intended to prevent the victims from cooperating with police,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   "This case should serve as a wake-up call about the dangers of
gangs, drugs and guns," said Jim Vines, U.S. attorney in Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   "The indictment charges that the defendants killed members of
their own gang to protect their criminal enterprise," Vines said.
"Anyone who may be tempted to join a gang should pay attention to how
gang members actually treat one another."</TE>
<TE>   The three defendants, who are all in federal custody in the Los
Angeles area, are scheduled for trial on May 19, according to
Assistant U.S. Atty. Sunny A.M. Koshy, who is co-prosecuting the case
in Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   Payne and Young have pleaded not guilty. Shakir will also plead
not guilty, according to his attorney, Natman Schaye of Tucson.</TE>
<TE>   "The government has chosen to hide virtually all of their evidence
from us," Schaye said.</TE>
<TE>   "But the case, as we understand it, will be largely based on the
testimony of many informants who have been arrested or convicted of
terrible crimes and who are being compensated by the government to
testify," the attorney said.</TE>
<TE>   Shakir, Schaye said, "is not the terrible, evil person the
indictment paints."</TE>
<TE>   The indictment, originally filed in 1999 and expanded last month,
charges Shakir with killing or aiding and abetting in the shooting
deaths of six people.</TE>
<TE>   The first of those slayings occurred on Sept. 30, 1995, in Los
Angeles, when a gun with a silencer was used to kill a purported
Rollin' 90s member named Solomon Harris.</TE>
<TE>   That case, investigated by Los Angeles Police Department
robbery-homicide detectives, eventually led federal, state and local
authorities to form a task force that allegedly linked half a dozen
other killings to the three men.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the LAPD detectives, the investigation included
Nashville and Oklahoma City police and agents of the FBI, the Drug
Enforcement Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the U.S. Postal Service.</TE>
<TE>   Shakir, authorities allege, led a faction of the Rollin' 90s Crips
known as the Rollin' 90s Neighborhood Crips or the Bangside 90s. That
faction, which included Payne and Young, over time distributed more
than 330 pounds of cocaine and trafficked in marijuana and crack
cocaine, investigators allege.</TE>
<TE>   Shakir, being prosecuted under a federal drug "kingpin" statute,
allegedly used juveniles to run drugs, provided guns to one juvenile
courier and, with others already prosecuted, engaged in money
laundering.</TE>
<TE>   In one particularly gruesome crime, Shakir and Payne are charged
with the fatal shooting in Oklahoma City of Kenard Murry and his
pregnant girlfriend, Regina Suetopka, and seriously wounding
Suetopka's 3-year-old daughter, Kimberly.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators allege that Murry was a hit man for the gang who
helped Shakir kill Harris in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Less than two years later, Shakir allegedly directed Payne to kill
Murry and his girlfriend in their home.</TE>
<TE>   The 3-year-old had been shot in both elbows and was found days
after the shootings lying next to her mother's body in a bloody bed.</TE>
<TE>   The girl was eventually handed over to an aunt.</TE>
<TE>   Her injuries drew so much attention in Oklahoma that state
lawmakers helped set up an education trust fund for the girl, who
became known as "Baby K."</TE>

<HD>County OKs Hospital Cuts</HD>
<DH>Supervisors approve closure of Rancho Los Amigos and vote
to reduce the number of beds at County-USC.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County supervisors voted 4 to 1 Tuesday to begin closure
of Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center in Downey, a
renowned specialty hospital for victims of stroke and traumatic
injury.</LD>
<LD>   Struggling to close a massive health-care deficit, the supervisors
also voted to reduce the size of the county's flagship hospital,
County-USC Medical Center, from 745 beds to 695.</LD>
<LD>   But as expected, the board delayed action for three weeks on
whether to end inpatient and emergency services at Harbor-UCLA and
Olive View-UCLA medical centers.</LD>
<TE>   Supervisors said they were awaiting the outcome of a ballot
initiative next week that would raise property taxes to fund trauma
and emergency care. They also are hoping to secure more money in
negotiations with state and federal officials.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to close Rancho blindsided its advocates and
employees, who said they learned of the impending vote late Monday
and did not have time to rally a defense.</TE>
<TE>   Rancho Los Amigos, built in 1888, offers highly specialized
services that are not available at other county facilities. The
hospital has 207 beds and a staff of more than 1,400. It treated
2,600 inpatients and 8,700 outpatients last year -- stroke and
diabetes patients as well as those with spinal cord and head
injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Rancho Los Amigos officials had hoped the hospital would be able
to operate under an independent hospital authority to be established
by the state Legislature. But the Department of Health Services
determined that the hospital could not be financially viable, even
with a planned county subsidy of $14.7 million annually.</TE>
<TE>   With the closing, the health department predicts that it will save
$58.6 million next year and then $65 million to $70 million annually.
The closure of 50 beds at County-USC would save $16.1 million per
year.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Dan Lammertse, president of the American Spinal Injury Assn.,
said county officials are wrong if they believe they will save money
by closing a rehabilitation center. The cost will merely shift to
acute-care hospitals and emergency rooms.</TE>
<TE>   "The public," he said, "has the wool pulled over its eyes."</TE>
<TE>   Rancho Chief Executive Consuelo Diaz and other Rancho Los Amigos
officials had argued that before voting on the hospital's fate, the
county should hire consultants familiar with rehabilitation hospital
management to determine whether the hospital could sustain itself.
That was not done.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors did agree Tuesday to hire an independent
consultant to examine the health department's fiscal analysis of the
hospital and make a report within 45 days. If the numbers hold up,
supervisors would hold another hearing in January to finalize the
hospital's closure, planned for June.</TE>
<TE>   Insured patients will be all right, Diaz said after the vote,
because they can be treated in private hospitals. But many uninsured
patients won't get the rehabilitation services they need and will
spend long periods of time at acute-care hospitals, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone is persuaded, however, that Rancho Los Amigos
ultimately will close. Once before, in the mid-1990s, the county made
plans to privatize the hospital, then backed down.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen this before -- when they tried to sell the hospital in
1995," said Gail Reeves, a member of Las Floristas, a charitable
organization whose volunteers have raised millions of dollars for
children's care at the hospital over the years. "I'm waiting to see
what's going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Don Knabe, whose district includes the hospital, was
the lone vote against Tuesday's cuts, saying the proposal was made
too hastily and without enough information. Knabe said hospital
supporters didn't have enough time to make their case to save the
hospital, which he called "very, very unfair."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Gloria Molina criticized Knabe for voting against the
health cuts, saying it undermines the board's unanimous voice in
trying economic times. The county faces a projected deficit of $500
million to $750 million in three years.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just very, very disappointed," Molina said of Knabe's
opposition. "None of us want to make these decisions.... I think it's
the beginning of painful decisions all around."</TE>
<TE>   In an earlier round of cuts in June, the supervisors voted to
close 11 health centers and four school-based clinics. They also
agreed to convert High Desert Hospital in the Antelope Valley into an
outpatient clinic next year, and trim public health spending by about
10%.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, speakers at Tuesday's public hearing praised
the board for delaying its vote on Harbor and Olive View. Harbor has
created a powerful community coalition seeking to head off any cuts
to the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach Mayor Beverly O'Neill said Harbor is important to the
2.2 million residents in the South Bay. Because of the hospital's
proximity to Los Angeles International Airport and the Port of Los
Angeles, it must be available in case of a major disaster.</TE>
<TE>   "As the need is increasing, it is ludicrous to think that cutting
back on a life-or-death facility is an answer," O'Neill said. "To
close this would be absolutely having blood on our hands."</TE>
<TE>   Hospital industry officials said the closure of Harbor or Olive
View would have a domino effect on the county's private hospitals,
which would quickly be overwhelmed.</TE>
<TE>   "Bottom line: There isn't any elasticity left in the system to
absorb any of the cuts that you make," said Jim Lott, executive vice
president of the Healthcare Assn. of Southern California, a hospital
trade group.</TE>
<TE>   Most supervisors said Tuesday that they are prepared to vote Nov.
19 to close Harbor and Olive View --two of the county's four
full-service public hospitals -- if more money is not forthcoming.</TE>
<TE>   "I question whether or not we can avoid bankruptcy of the county
if we keep going" without making changes," said Yvonne Brathwaite
Burke.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Mike Antonovich agreed. "We need to reform the system.
We need to have fiscal responsibility and accountability."</TE>
<TE>   The vast majority of speakers pinned their hope on Measure B, a
parcel tax on next Tuesday's ballot that would raise $168 million
annually for the county's emergency and trauma-care network.</TE>
<TE>   If approved, the tax would cost the owner of an average-sized
property about $42 per year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's critical, make no mistake about it," Supervisor Zev
Yaroslavsky said.</TE>
<TE>   At a rally on the steps of the county Hall of Administration,
several speakers implored the crowd to push for passage of the parcel
tax.</TE>
<TE>   "Measure B is the most important thing on the ballot in L.A.,"
state Sen. Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar) said.</TE>
<TE>   Former Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks weighed in as
well.</TE>
<TE>   "It's of no value to have a first-class paramedic service and not
have a trauma center to take people to," he said.</TE>

<KH>TIMES HOLIDAY FUND</KH>
<HD>Holiday Season Is Tough on Poor at San Gabriel School</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephanie Chavez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Halloween and its trappings -- costumes, candy, pumpkins -- signal
the start of what the director of La Casa de San Gabriel Preschool
describes as the "delicate holiday season."</LD>
<LD>   Thanksgiving, Christmas and Halloween tend to be holidays of
consumption, said Brenda Rincon, and most of the 60 children who
attend La Casa preschool have very little to consume. No $38 Buzz
Lightyear costumes for them on Halloween; they make theirs from paper
bags.</LD>
<LD>   Rincon's simple request to a parent last week typifies the need.</LD>
<TE>   "I asked a mother if she could help out with the snack for our
Halloween party, and she pulled me aside to tell me she couldn't
because she didn't have any food at home," said Rincon, who promptly
packed a bag of beans and rice for the mother. The school keeps two
20-pound bags of each next to the copy machine for such situations.</TE>
<TE>   La Casa preschool is part of a larger, 55-year-old community
center in San Gabriel that serves more than 6,000 clients, mainly
working poor Latinos and Native Americans. The center's programs
include courses for parents, health screenings and food and clothing
distribution. During the week, the center's squat concrete block
buildings, a few blocks from the historic San Gabriel Mission, house
the bustling preschool.</TE>
<TE>   About 85% of the students come from low-income families. Their
parents hold minimum-wage jobs in hospitals, convalescent homes,
carwashes and nearby restaurants, said Cheryl Prentice, chief
executive of La Casa. Tuition is based on family size and income:
Most families pay $1 a day, which includes breakfast and lunch.</TE>
<TE>   More than 75 children are on the school's waiting list.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the Los Angeles Times Holiday Campaign gave $10,000 to
the preschool to help launch a new class of 12 children. The
2-year-old campaign, part of The Times' efforts to raise money for
worthy causes, is run by the Los Angeles Times Family Fund, a fund of
the McCormick Tribune Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation matches the first $700,000 raised at 50 cents on
the dollar. The foundation and The Times absorb all administrative
costs.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the holiday appeal and matching funds raised $653,000,
which was given to 56 charities serving Los Angeles, Orange,
Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties.</TE>
<TE>   During the next two months, teachers and children at La Casa
preschool will focus on reading, coloring pumpkin pictures, making
Pilgrim hats and chattering about Santa Claus. But the staff is
sensitive to the poor children they serve.</TE>
<TE>   "We tell the children that Santa Claus can only bring what he can
afford," she said. "And that it's OK if they don't get all the things
they ask for."</TE>

<KH>THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR</KH>
<HD>Fewer Latinos Back Davis This Time</HD>
<DH>Most still support the governor, but not as
enthusiastically as they did in 1998, poll shows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Matea Gold</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's Latino voters, who energetically supported Gray Davis'
candidacy in 1998, still favor the Democratic governor but are
decidedly less enthusiastic about him this year, according to
interviews with voters and experts on Latino politics.</LD>
<LD>   At this point in the 1998 governor's race, 72% of Latino
voters said they were backing Davis. He ultimately won 71% of the Latino
vote, according to Los Angeles Times exit polls of voters. According
to a Times poll published Tuesday, however, Davis is currently
supported by 57% of likely Latino voters.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said that dismay over Davis' veto of a bill that would
have allowed some illegal immigrants to get driver's licenses, apathy
toward both major gubernatorial candidates and an absence of
competitive legislative races have contributed to a sense of
ambivalence about this year's election.</LD>
<TE>   "I think Latinos are affected by the same malaise that is
affecting voter participation as a whole," said Antonio Gonzalez,
president of the William C. Velasquez Institute, a Los Angeles-based
research group that studies Latino political trends. "A big majority
are still going with Davis and the Democrats, but they're not
enthusiastic because the perception is that the gains made over the
last four years were really like pulling teeth with the
administration."</TE>
<TE>   Linda De Los Reyes, a student and mother of four in
Sacramento, said she has many friends who are contemplating a vote for
Green Party candidate Peter Camejo because of their frustration with
Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of Latinos are dissatisfied with him," said
the 48-year-old, who was polled by The Times. "No one is really like,
'Hey, we want Davis,' but they definitely don't want [Bill] Simon."</TE>
<TE>   The Republican gubernatorial candidate has tried to appeal to
Latinos by promising to improve schools and the economy, and touting
his platform on Spanish-language television. At the same time,
however, he has embraced the support of former Gov. Pete Wilson,
whose backing of a controversial anti-illegal immigration measure in
1994 angered many Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   While Davis' Latino support has softened, Simon has not succeeded
in drawing those voters to his candidacy. A quarter of Latino voters
surveyed by The Times said they plan to cast ballots for Simon -- the
same proportion that historically vote for Republican candidates in
state and national elections.</TE>
<TE>   Almost a fifth of Latino voters surveyed by The Times described
themselves either as undecided or supporting a third-party candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Small Gain in Turnout</TE>
<TE>   Without a compelling ballot initiative or candidate to propel
large numbers to the polls, Latino turnout is expected to make only
modest gains on Nov. 5. According to voting experts, Latinos are
expected to make up about 17% of the electorate next week, up from
13% in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Perez, an artist and teacher who lives in Los Feliz,
exemplified the ambivalence that many said exists in the Latino
community. She said she's voting for Davis only because she doesn't
want a Republican to win.</TE>
<TE>   "I have been really feeling let down by him, particularly in the
energy crisis," said Perez, 50. "I'm really not very moved by
anything I've heard about him."</TE>
<TE>   The mood of Perez and others is dramatically different from 1998,
when Davis was swept into office by a wave of union members, Latinos
and other Democrats eager to end a 16-year stretch of Republican
governors. They also helped elect Cruz Bustamante as the state's
first Latino lieutenant governor.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, thousands of Latino voters had recently registered to
vote, their political activism fueled by Wilson's advocacy for
Proposition 187 during the previous governor's race.</TE>
<TE>   "People were excited about getting rid of Pete Wilson's legacy,"
said Los Angeles labor leader Miguel Contreras. "I don't think
there's that excitement this time."</TE>
<TE>   Although Davis was recently praised by Latino labor leaders for
signing a measure mandating arbitration between growers and farm
workers, he drew criticism for vetoing the bill that would have
allowed illegal immigrants in the process of becoming citizens to get
driver's licenses.</TE>
<TE>   "There's kind of a mixed review" of the Davis administration, said
Harry Pachon, president of the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute, a
Claremont think tank. Many Latinos are happy that the governor
expanded a health insurance program for low-income families, but are
disappointed with the decisions Davis made during bill-signing
season, he added.</TE>
<TE>   "The farm workers' [measure] was very important symbolically, but
in effect, the driver's license issue had a greater impact on more
people," said Pachon, noting that the majority of the state's Latinos
live in urban centers.</TE>
<TE>   Support Is Fractured</TE>
<TE>   While a majority of Latinos surveyed in the Times poll favored the
governor's veto of the driver's license measure, his actions
fractured his support among the 22 members of the Latino legislative
caucus. Early this month, the group decided not to endorse Davis'
reelection. Assemblyman Gil Cedillo (D-Los Angeles), the original
author of the measure, said he felt betrayed by Davis and will not
vote for him. Later, however, 17 of the 22 signed onto a Davis
endorsement that ran in the Spanish-language newspaper La Opinion.</TE>
<TE>   Arturo Vargas, executive director of the National Assn. Of Latino
Elected and Appointed Officials, said the dissension among Latino
leaders has affected their constituents.</TE>
<TE>   "Enthusiasm is not the highest," Vargas said.</TE>
<TE>   Guadalupe Gomez, president of the Mexican Federations of Los
Angeles, which represents about 150,000 Mexican immigrants, said that
Davis' opposition to the driver's license bill generated anger among
many new voters who have undocumented friends and family members.</TE>
<TE>   Many will probably still vote for Davis, he said, but with mixed
feelings.</TE>
<TE>   "They're confused, they're hurt, they're sad that we were not able
to get the driver's license initiative passed," Gomez said.</TE>
<TE>   Boyle Heights resident Rosalinda Cabrera, a 22-year-old student,
was among those upset by Davis' veto.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that was fair," Cabrera said. "I have family who
wanted their licenses, and they couldn't get them."</TE>
<TE>   But 79-year-old Angel Sanchez said that although he did not agree
with the governor's veto, he still thinks Davis is a good leader.</TE>
<TE>   "Latinos will be angry, but they have to realize that that was his
decision," the Riverside resident said. "It doesn't mean that Simon
is thinking any differently about it."</TE>
<TE>   In the last few weeks, Davis has made a concerted effort to build
back support among Latinos by campaigning with Sen. Richard Polanco
(D-Los Angeles), United Farm Worker co-founder Dolores Huerta and
other community leaders. His campaign has run commercials on
Spanish-language television, taken out ads in La Opinion and sent out
bilingual mailers touting Davis' friendship with legendary civil
rights leader Cesar Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   Unimpressed by Mailer</TE>
<TE>   Alfred Reyes, a carpenter from Riverside, recently received the
Chavez mailer, but said he was unimpressed by its message.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's just politics," said Reyes, 56, adding that his
dismay with Davis' performance during the energy crisis and veto of
the driver's license bill has made him uneasy about voting for the
governor.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not really happy with him, but of choices that we have,
I think I will go with him," Reyes said. "He's the lesser of two
evils."</TE>

<HD>Solicitors Face New Restrictions at LAX</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jennifer Oldham</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Solicitors at Los Angeles International Airport will be restricted to
marked areas in the facility's nine terminals starting in early
December under an ordinance approved 12-0 by the Los Angeles City
Council on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The law is the latest in a 28-year effort by city officials to
rein in fund-raisers at the world's fifth-busiest airport. Mayor
James K. Hahn is expected to sign the measure in the next week.</LD>
<LD>   The city's airport agency will issue monthly permits on a
first-come, first-served basis to charitable groups that designate
areas, days and times they can request donations.</LD>
<TE>   City officials argue that the law is necessary because solicitors
distract travelers and impede traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Civil liberties lawyers said they will seek a restraining order
prohibiting the city from enacting the new law.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997 the city banned fund-raising in airport terminals, on
sidewalks and in parking lots. That ordinance was found
unconstitutional by a federal judge last summer, but the city has
appealed the ruling to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which is
expected to hear the case Dec. 2.</TE>
<TE>   The city considers the new law -- restricting but not banning
solicitations -- a provisional measure pending outcome of the appeal.</TE>

<KH>Steve Lopez POINTS WEST</KH>
<HD>If Alleged Theft Was a Rehearsal, What Was Her Motivation?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A bewildered Winona Ryder kept peering over her left shoulder in the
Beverly Hills courtroom, looking in the direction of relatives and
her publicist as if she wanted to say something.</LD>
<LD>   I don't blame her. I was bewildered, too.</LD>
<LD>   What in the world was the L.A. County district attorney's office
thinking when it kept the guy who ran Sony Pictures on the jury?</LD>
<TE>   Peter Guber was the grand poo-bah at Sony Pictures Entertainment
when the company produced "Bram Stoker's Dracula" and "Age of
Innocence," both of which starred Ryder. "Dracula" raked in $82
million and "Innocence" did $32 million.</TE>
<TE>   Guber also got a third Ryder picture going, and although he was
gone when it was released, "Little Women" grossed $50 million.</TE>
<TE>   Now look, I realize how hard it can be to find a juror in Beverly
Hills who hasn't owned a studio, produced a movie, directed a star,
married one or had an affair with one. But how could the prosecutor
be comfortable allowing a man who'd done more than $100-million worth
of business with Ryder to sit in judgment of her?</TE>
<TE>   It'd be like me going on trial for, say, attempting to strangle
one or two candidates for governor of California, and having my book
agent on the jury.</TE>
<TE>   "I have about as much of a chance of getting on this jury as the
man in the moon," Guber himself had said in the courthouse the day
before he was picked. "I only made three pictures with the lady."</TE>
<TE>   Guber sat in the jury box Tuesday scribbling in a notepad. For all
we know, he could have been writing a script for Ryder's next
picture. I called the D.A.'s office to ask what gives, and it fed me
the same "no comment" it's been dishing out all week.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley figured this thing was a slam-dunk,
no matter who was on the jury, and you'd have to say it hasn't gone
particularly well for Ryder so far. The very first witness, a Saks
security man, testified that Ryder told him she was shoplifting to
rehearse a movie role. Half of L.A. could give that answer.</TE>
<TE>   If true, I like the spirit of it. I could stalk Jennifer Lopez,
and if I happen to get arrested, I could say I was working on a
column.</TE>
<TE>   I suppose we should count our lucky stars Ryder doesn't play a
serial killer in this movie she's preparing for, whatever it might
be. And based on her performance in the 90-minute video of her
alleged shoplifting spree at Saks, I don't think she's going to get
the role.</TE>
<TE>   Don't get me wrong. Although the drama is plodding at times and
Ryder seems to be holding something back, it surpasses her
performances in both "Mr. Deeds" -- the movie's tag line was "Don't
let the fancy clothes fool you" -- and the disposable "Autumn in New
York." Wonder how she rehearsed for those?</TE>
<TE>   Ryder seems to know nothing about shoplifting, which I suppose is
going to be part of her defense. Then there's the obvious argument
that a millionaire movie star doesn't need to go around stealing
duds.</TE>
<TE>   First of all, there's scarcely another shopper in the store, which
is a bad time to do that kind of work. Winona pretty much has the
third-floor designer boutiques to herself, with no other shoppers to
serve as a distraction or human shield.</TE>
<TE>   The video shows her schlepping around like a high-priced bag lady,
for crying out loud, grabbing Gucci this and Yves St. Laurent that.
She's carrying more cargo than a Himalayan camel, shouldering all
manner of designer clothes, hats, purses, shoes. More than once,
allegedly boosted items are half falling out of a big red Saks
shopping bag.</TE>
<TE>   Then you've got the security man testifying that he found those
little white electronic sensors clipped off of clothing she had her
hands on in the Chanel section.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, the prosecutor held up a cream-colored Mark Jacobs
sweater that had been mutilated. It had a hole where the sensor would
be.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder allegedly was carrying a pair of orange-handled snippers
when she was nabbed the moment she left the store. She shook her head
ever so slightly in court when the prosecutor held those scissors up
for all to see.</TE>
<TE>   "I think various people had a motive to set up Winona," her
attorney Mark Geragos has claimed.</TE>
<TE>   It's going to be interesting to hear who, exactly.</TE>
<TE>   Was it social outcast Edward Scissorhands, Ryder's co-star in the
movie by that name, and a man with both a motive and a weapon?</TE>
<TE>   Was it a disgruntled former director or producer, or an envious
salesclerk?</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Geragos will call the whole thing a publicity stunt by Saks.
It could make for a terrific promotion on the eve of the holiday
shopping season:</TE>
<TE>   WinonaWear(TM), half off.</TE>
<TE>   It's a steal!</TE>
<TE>   I ran to Saks during the lunch break to see what they thought.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's a good idea," a salesclerk said on the third floor
that had just been featured in the courtroom video.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the $1,595 Gucci dress Winona had her hands on was
gone, and so was most of the rest of the nearly $6,000 worth of goods
in question. I think I found the Natori purse ($900), but the rest
was out of season or out of style. Designer goods have a shorter
shelf life than actresses.</TE>
<TE>   If Ryder hadn't gone to such a high-priced store, she might be
looking at misdemeanors instead of felonies. In fact, when she turned
from the defendant's table with that look of bewilderment and
silently mouthed something to supporters, I think it was this:</TE>
<TE>   "I should have gone to Ross Dress for Less."</TE>

<HD>Garamendi Cites Mold Cases</HD>
<DH>Insurance chief hopeful promises to upgrade construction
standards.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephanie Stassel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After touring a Northridge home with toxic mold infestation,
insurance commissioner candidate John Garamendi said Tuesday he would
work to boost construction standards and protect homeowners whose
policies are canceled after filing a claim.</LD>
<LD>   Joined by consumer activist Erin Brockovich, Garamendi said mold
problems are made worse by insurance companies that process claims
too slowly, allowing mold to spread.</LD>
<LD>   Garamendi, a Democrat running against Republican Gary Mendoza,
examined mold removal and reconstruction work underway at the home of
Laura and Rob Boles. Started by a leaky shower valve, the mold spread
from the shower to the adjacent kitchen, causing $45,000 in damage.</LD>
<TE>   Laura Bole's 81-year-old mother has moved temporarily to a
retirement home while the bathroom and kitchen are being redone. Rob
Boles and his 14-year-old daughter and 20-year-old son all had
physical problems -- ranging from sinus infections to mononucleosis
-- that they attributed to the mold.</TE>
<TE>   If elected, Garamendi said he would work with the construction
industry to reduce the number of mold infestations by improving
building materials and making sure homes are properly built.</TE>
<TE>   Brockovich said she has spent $850,000 removing mold from her
Agoura Hills home.</TE>
<TE>   "It almost destroyed me emotionally, mentally, physically and
financially," she said.</TE>

<LD>Pat Wright, the Libertarian Party's nominee for lieutenant governor,
is running on a platform to legalize the ownership of ferrets in this
state (no, really -- see accompanying). Pro-ferret folks say the
weasels can turn on the charm and are very intelligent. Opponents
counter that they have a vicious side. I dunno -- ferrets don't sound
much different from lawyers.</LD>
<LD>   Blowin' in the Brentwood wind: Guess whose gardener recently
received a citation for using a gasoline-powered leaf blower? Why,
ex-mayor Richard Riordan's. It was Riordan, you may recall, who
signed a city ordinance banning the blowers in 1996.</LD>
<LD>   Were her initials carved into the bark? The police log of the
Huntington Beach Independent recently recounted that "a woman
reported the theft of a pine tree in July, and Wednesday she said she
found it in the 2500 block of Delaware Street."</LD>
<TE>   Couldn't they be more specific? The crime log of Laguna Beach's
Coastline Pilot said that "police received four calls about an
out-of-control, three-legged deer in the area."</TE>
<TE>   On the road: Rosemary LeForte of Huntington Beach came upon a back
road in Hawaii that did not seem beloved by locals (see photo). Or
was the editing of the sign a trick to keep tourists away?</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of mysteries, Gordon Shaffer of Yorba Linda wasn't sure
about the meaning of the warning to motorists (or owls) that he saw
in South Africa (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Cro-Magnon country: Mike Blumenthal of Monrovia noticed that the
latest list of restaurants cited by the L.A. County Health Department
included Hollywood's Adult Cave. Its violation was "no potable water
supply or no hot water." Of course, I would think that primitive
conditions would be part of the charm of a place with a name like
that.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels surprised most everyone: Several readers, including Tom
Thomas, Pat Mooney and Jeff Krinock, noted that on Monday The Times
published an ad from a department store that offered a free
"commemorative World Series champion baseball" with "any $30 Giants'
purchase."</TE>
<TE>   I'm not perfect, either. I was wrong when I said that the annoying
Fox-TV network ran commercials for a program called "24 Hours"
countless times during the World Series. Actually, annoying Fox-TV
ran commercials for a program called "2' "countless times.</TE>
<TE>   In case you missed it: Angel first baseman Scott Spiezio went to
bat on TV's "David Letterman Show," narrating a list of the "Top Ten
Things Overheard in the Angels Locker Room." A selection: 10: "Mmm,
this Rally Monkey is delicious."</TE>
<TE>   5: "Here's to the California Angels ... or the Anaheim Angels or
whatever the hell we are."</TE>
<TE>   And ...</TE>
<TE>   1: The victory parade is Tuesday -- start thawing Walt!"</TE>
<TE>   MiscelLAny: Just for the record, I'll repeat that the urban myth
is not true -- Walt Disney's body was not frozen at his death in
1966. He was cremated and his remains were interred at Forest Lawn in
Glendale.</TE>
<TE>   Still the rumor lives on, bolstered by such comics as Paul Reiser,
who observed during one Emmy broadcast that two networks
(Westinghouse's CBS and General Electric's NBC) are owned by
companies that sell freezers, while a third, ABC, is owned by a
company "whose founder is in a freezer."</TE>

<HD>Goodbye to a Mousy Image</HD>
<DH>As much as the World Series victory is about sports, it's
also about being more than Disneyland's home, say fans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Evan Halper</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For a while there it looked as if Los Angeles was going to steal the
thunder on this one too.</LD>
<LD>   Giants fans chanted "beat L.A.," and the television cameras
continued to zoom in on John Travolta and other Hollywood celebs. But
as the series wore on, even outsiders began to get it.</LD>
<LD>   This wasn't about L.A.</LD>
<TE>   So Tuesday, as thousands of fans converged on Anaheim to celebrate
the Angels' World Series championship, the party was as much about
long-overdue civic recognition as a miracle baseball season.</TE>
<TE>   The world, it seems, has finally realized that the champion Angels
represent a thriving, multicultural metropolis and not just an
offshoot of the big city to the north.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been L.A.'s little brother," said one celebrant at Edison
Field, 40-year-old Dave Marriott of Westminster. "Nobody knows where
Orange County is. Now they will."</TE>
<TE>   Marriott hopes the Angels' win will finally get Orange County out
of Los Angeles' shadow.</TE>
<TE>   "When you go out of state and people ask you where you're from,
when you say 'Orange County,' people just look at you and say
'Where's that? Is that where Disneyland is? Is that in L.A.?' " he
said.</TE>
<TE>   In the minds of some fans, the victory also helps lift the
inferiority complex some have about their more glamorous neighbor on
the other side of the "Orange Curtain" that divides Los Angeles and
Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "This will help show that we're a different breed than L.A.," said
Jim Bonsteel, 50, of Anaheim. "L.A. has always had the better ball
team, the money, everything. All we were known for is Disneyland. But
we're not just Disneyland -- we're Anaheim, and this is where the
Angels play. It makes you proud to be a citizen of Anaheim."</TE>
<TE>   Some in the outside world refuse to face how Orange County has
changed since its days as a conservative bedroom community
distinguished by a few nice beach towns.</TE>
<TE>   That the mighty Yankees were downed by a team from a young city
that sprouted from the California sprawl may be especially hard for
New Yorkers to accept.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one thing to lose to a team from Hollywood," said Robert
Lang, a demographer who has tracked the dynamic growth of "edge
cities" like Anaheim. "It's completely something else for the Yankees
to get bumped off by a team known for Disneyland. New Yorkers can't
cope with that.</TE>
<TE>   "Anaheim alone is now bigger than Pittsburgh," Lang added. "No one
would make fun of Pittsburgh this way. On any scale, Anaheim is a big
place. But because it is a new place, it is not taken as seriously as
traditional cities. That is a mistake."</TE>
<TE>   Orange County's two largest cities -- Santa Ana and Anaheim--are
each rapidly approaching the population of Miami. There is nearly as
much office space around John Wayne Airport as there is in downtown
Dallas or Atlanta, and it has become a national economic hotbed.</TE>
<TE>   An influx of immigrants from Asia and Latin America has made the
county one of the most diverse places in America. That is not what
postwar planners envisioned for Orange County. It was supposed to be
a quiet suburb full of meticulously planned subdivisions -- a refuge
from the urban life of Los Angeles. Yet, with nearly 3 million
residents and growing, Orange County looks more and more like its
rival to the north.</TE>
<TE>   "Orange County is being redefined the way the San Fernando Valley
and other older suburbs are," said Rick Cole, a former director of
the California Local Government Commission who is now the city
manager of Azusa.</TE>
<TE>   "The perception of Orange County as a suburb of Los Angeles is
wildly and hopelessly out of date," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Angels victory gives the world a chance to reassess the
county and see for themselves that it is an example of a post
suburban reality that is diverse, and changing and complex."</TE>
<TE>   The fans who came out to the parade Tuesday couldn't agree more.
Diana Cook, 51, of Anaheim wore a homemade shirt that had "ANAHEIM
Angels" painted on it. Emphasis on Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   "Respect," she said. "That's what this is all about. Respect. It
put Orange County on the map. We all deserve this."</TE>

<HD>Store Videotape Is Shown, Security Manager Grilled in Ryder
Trial</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anna Gorman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Actress Winona Ryder spent her 31st birthday in a Beverly Hills
courtroom Tuesday watching herself on a Saks Fifth Avenue
surveillance tape that showed her being confronted by three security
guards moments after she left the store in December with her arms
full of shopping bags.</LD>
<LD>   Saks security manager Kenneth Evans, who provided narration of the
tape to jurors, testified that Ryder had no permission to take some
$5,560 worth of merchandise found in her possession. He also showed
jurors four sensor tags that he said matched items Ryder took from
the department store.</LD>
<LD>   Later, during cross-examination, Evans admitted that he made
several inaccurate statements during Ryder's preliminary hearing and
during his direct examination Monday. Evans also acknowledged that he
did not mark the sensor tags in a log when he placed them in a Saks
evidence locker, saying he did not believe they were crucial to the
case against Ryder.</LD>
<TE>   "I didn't think [the tags were] necessary to prove that Winona
Ryder had shoplifted on Dec. 12," he told jurors during the second
day of testimony in Ryder's felony trial.</TE>
<TE>   The Oscar-nominated film star is accused of stealing $5,560 in
merchandise and is charged with grand theft, burglary and vandalism.
She paid for roughly $3,700 in merchandise the same day as her
arrest. Her trial is expected to last less than two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Evans identified several pieces of evidence, including a pair of
scissors he said Ryder used to cut sensor tags off merchandise in a
store dressing room, along with two designer blouses with holes in
them. He also said Ryder cut herself with those scissors, and pointed
out a section on the videotape when a sales associate helps the
actress place a bandage on her finger.</TE>
<TE>   The high-end department store has a program, called "Fifth Avenue
Club," for regular shoppers to borrow clothing without paying, as
long as they sign the items in a "borrow book," Evans said. But Evans
stressed that Ryder did not do that during her shopping spree.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder's attorney, Mark Geragos, repeatedly attacked Evans'
credibility Tuesday, poking holes in his testimony and accusing him
of lying on the stand.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Superior Court Judge Elden S. Fox said, "Mr.
Geragos, you're trying my patience."</TE>
<TE>   The attorney responded, "Judge, the witness is trying my
patience."</TE>
<TE>   Evans acknowledged that he was inaccurate when he testified in
June that he found the sensor tags on Dec. 13, the day after Ryder's
arrest. He told jurors Tuesday that he located them in a pocket of a
jacket in the store between Dec. 14 and Dec. 18 and admitted never
noting the discovery in a written report.</TE>
<TE>   Evans also admitted that he took two other sensor tags found by
one of his security guards in the dressing room that Ryder used and
put them back into circulation.</TE>
<TE>   Geragos also suggested to the jury that Ryder gave her credit card
to a sales associate and told him to leave her account open.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a state appellate court ruled Tuesday that Fox did not
appear to follow correct procedures when he held closed court
hearings and sealed motions related to Ryder's case. The justices
strongly urged Fox to reevaluate his actions and gave him until 5
p.m. Thursday to hold a hearing on the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Fox did not follow rules set by a 1999 California Supreme Court
case that requires judges to find that there is a compelling interest
that justifies secrecy and to consider less restrictive alternatives,
the appellate court said.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling was in response to a writ filed by The Times, the
Associated Press and the Daily Journal on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very prompt," said Al Wickers, attorney for The Times.
"We're very happy that the court acted so quickly."</TE>

<HD>Trash a Bone of Secession Contention</HD>
<DH>Hahn says Valley would send its refuse to South- Central
L.A. transfer station. Supporters of breakup accuse mayor of using
scare tactics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the election one week away, the debate over San Fernando Valley
secession turned Tuesday to trash talk, literally and figuratively.</LD>
<LD>   While secession leaders accused the other side of ethical lapses,
Mayor James K. Hahn said a breakup could lead to creation of a trash
transfer station in South-Central Los Angeles to handle Valley
refuse.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn also announced that he opposes plans to expand Bradley
Landfill in Sun Valley, which has become a hot-button issue for
northeast Valley residents.</LD>
<TE>   "When people start talking about bringing trash to your
neighborhood and people start saying, 'We're going to take money away
from the city treasury,' which is going to hurt our ability to
provide services to all of you, it is going to affect you," Hahn said
during a campaign appearance at Central Avenue Jazz Park in
South-Central.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said a provision of the environmental impact report on Valley
cityhood raised the possibility that the Valley could truck its trash
to central Los Angeles, where it would be placed on trains for
hauling to remote desert landfills.</TE>
<TE>   "The new Valley city shall pursue the development of a transfer
station in the central Los Angeles area that will allow the new
Valley city access to desert rail-haul disposal facilities," the
report says.</TE>
<TE>   Secession leader Carlos Ferreyra said the report's language only
represented an option and the Valley would never try to put a trash
transfer station in a central Los Angeles neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no need to build it there," Ferreyra said. He said a
Valley city could instead transfer excess trash to rail cars in an
industrial area of the port.</TE>
<TE>   Ferreyra accused Hahn of misleading residents. "It just goes along
with his tactic all along to scare the public," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn also announced his opposition to a request by Waste
Management Corp. to raise the height of the Bradley Landfill in Sun
Valley by 43 feet.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't need a trash mountain there that is four stories high,"
Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists have long sought to close that landfill and others
in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, Ferreyra and other secession proponents questioned
the propriety of a $5,000 campaign contribution to the anti-secession
side from the Ferraro Officeholder Committee, a political account
that was maintained by former City Council President John Ferraro
until his death last year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unethical," said Ferreyra. "The poor man is dead. We don't
know what side he would have taken."</TE>
<TE>   Ferraro was an outspoken opponent of secession, but it was unclear
who authorized dipping into the account to contribute to an
anti-secession campaign committee set up by Councilmen Eric Garcetti
and Tom LaBonge.</TE>
<TE>   LaBonge, a former aide to Ferraro, said the decision was made by
another former Ferraro aide, Pat Gobler, who now controls the fund.</TE>
<TE>   With little money to counter Hahn's ad blitz, the secessionists

<HD>Bratton Issues a Stern Warning on Gangs to LAPD Commanders</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Street gangs pervade Los Angeles, and their criminality may soon turn
the city into American's most violent, Police Chief William J.
Bratton warned Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "It is quite likely this year we will become the murder capital of
the United States," Bratton told a gathering of the Los Angeles
Police Department's top leaders in a blunt, hourlong,
profanity-studded speech that alternated between praise and threats.</LD>
<LD>   Bratton told 114 LAPD leaders that they must reverse the tide by
quickly putting more officers on the streets. Bratton identified the
gang problem as one of more than two dozen priorities for the first
60 days of his administration.</LD>
<TE>   Pledging to run a transparent department, Bratton insisted that
officers will enforce the law without breaking the law. "There will
not be another Rampart," Bratton said, referring to the corruption
scandal that has rocked the department</TE>
<TE>   Some of those attending -- commanders of the rank of captain and
above -- characterized Bratton's address as unprecedented.</TE>
<TE>   While praising the dedication of the force, Bratton cursed those
who would work against his program, telling them of their careers,
"kiss it goodbye."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking in the glare of television lights, Bratton promised to
"flip the department upside down" in an effort to return it to past
glory.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the city is extremely safe, Bratton said. But, he added,
"there is not enough appreciation for the destructive nature of gangs
and the image the rest of the country has in some parts of the city.
In the long term, gang violence in the city will destroy the city. It
is in their [good neighborhoods'] interest to get into this fight."</TE>
<TE>   The chief said the biggest sin a commander can commit under his
watch is not knowing the specific reasons behind any crime trends.</TE>
<TE>   He also promised an open department with no secrets, said he would
detail neighborhood-by-neighborhood crime statistics and revealed
that there are 60 officers assigned to desk duty because of domestic
violence complaints.</TE>
<TE>   To do more with less, Bratton said the LAPD has to go after
federal money that is available in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks and cooperate with other police agencies, from the Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Department to the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, he said, the LAPD needs to protect its own turf
by retaining its contract with the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority to provide security.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton also expressed concern about the department's
comparatively thin staffing, greatly exacerbated by the fact that as
many as 10% of sworn officers are unavailable for street policing due
to sick leave, light duty or legal issues.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton said the city must develop a citywide crime strategy while
strengthening compliance with terms of a court settlement reached
after federal officials found a pattern of civil rights abuses by the
LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton said he will personally oversee the meetings in which
captains are held responsible for knowing about crime trends and
producing plans of action.</TE>
<TE>   Citing the release this week of 2001 FBI statistics, he said he
wanted an immediate picture of crime in Los Angeles, saying: "We need
to know what happened an hour ago."</TE>
<TE>   There have been 553 murders in Los Angeles so far this year,
according to the LAPD. Last year, there were 483 murders during the
same period and 591 for the year. The rate has dropped considerably
from 1992 when 1,092 people were murdered.</TE>
<TE>   To return more officers to patrol, commanders need to place more
value on civilians as employees, Bratton said.</TE>
<TE>   He promised to seek "quick hits" to improve the daily lives of
officers. He drew laughter and applause when he said one of the first
orders he signed allows officers to stop shining their Sam Browne
belts with black polish.</TE>
<TE>   Former Chief Bernard C. Parks issued a special order last year
forbidding the use of a polish substitute that is easier to maintain.
Complaining that the black polish on his new belt got on everything,
Bratton added, "I don't like dirty fingernails."</TE>
