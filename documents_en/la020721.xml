<LD>I returned here in February of this year after living in Reno, Nev.
Your Annual Restaurant Issue (June 23) was a wonderful reminder of what I
had missed so much. As a Southern California native, I see that some old
favorites have weathered the changing trends and hard economic times.
What I missed most was the amazing diversity that we have in food. From a
fiery Thai seafood soup to a sublime carne asada taco, we have it all.
Your issue presents a great cross-section of classic eateries and new
culinary haunts. I will enjoy exploring the many locations for months to
come. It is good to be home. Thank you for a fantastic reminder.</LD>

<TE>   As a teenager, I am constantly trying to find restaurants that are
reasonably priced, interesting and good-which is why the article on
'Cheap Eats' sparked my attention. The first entry, Ammo, immediately
sounded like a great choice: hip and tasty without being outrageously
overpriced. I thought this would be the perfect place to take two
friends.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after glancing over the menu, though, I was shocked that
Ammo could be included in the 'Cheap Eats' section. A soup for $8 is far
from 'cheap,' and only one or two of the pasta dishes stayed in the $14
range. Many of the entrees reached well into the neighborhood of $25. I
was so embarrassed that I had suggested such an expensive restaurant that
I offered to treat my friends.</TE>
<TE>   We managed to have a relatively pleasant meal-the food was
delicious-yet the three of us struggled to share a minuscule salad, a
small pasta and a slightly larger seafood dish to keep costs down. Our
$25 ahi dish was by no means a bargain, but if the portion had been truly
large enough to share, then it could have been considered a better value.
The portions at Ammo, however, are surprisingly small. This restaurant
should not be considered 'cheap' in any way. The entry was extremely
misleading.</TE>

<HD>Another Look at the Siege in Bethlehem</HD>

<LD>I don't know if The Times gives out medals, but Carolyn Cole
certainly deserves one for her excellent photographs taken inside the
besieged Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem ('Bringing Bethlehem Home,'
June 16). This reader is truly grateful for the scenes from within one of
Christianity's holiest places during terrible times. Thanks also to Eric
Pape for the very meaningful text.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This is anything but an even-handed review of the siege that took
place in Bethlehem. First, the Palestinian terrorists-and they are
terrorists-sought protection inside a holy place of worship. This is a
cowardly act in itself. Second, they held the Christian clergy hostage in
their own church. Third, they desecrated holy artifacts and trashed the
interior of the church.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli soldiers, on the other hand, were extremely respectful of
the church and careful not to inflict any damage-though they were
fighting a well-armed and dangerous enemy.</TE>
<TE>   The photographs and accompanying text describe these terrorists as
placid, religious and respectful of the church. If you only looked at the
pictures and didn't read the text, you'd think that these despicable
characters were altar boys and not cowardly killers. The text simply
confirms the pictures. The Times should be ashamed of such biased
journalism. William Osterman</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The photo essay revealed some of the consequences of the ongoing
Palestinian-Israeli war. It convinced me that there are no 'right sides'
in this issue. Obviously neither side will consider compromise in
exchange for peace. Perhaps all of Israel should be put under
international control and the city of Jerusalem be made a separate
'shrine city'-holy to three religions-until all concerned can live with
each other in peace.</TE>

<LD>I would give a lot to have known the kind of loving closure
experienced by the talented Joe Donnelly and his brave father ('Driving
Vince Donnelly,' June 16). I was moved to tears by the author's deft
prose and obvious respect for his complex, charismatic 'old man.' I lost
my alcoholic Irish dad almost 20 years ago, four years before I got
sober. What a wonderful, mystical trip the Donnellys shared together. We
should all be so lucky.</LD>

<LD>Like those ghostly footprints and missing-link hominid bones that
surprise lucky paleoanthropologists in the African desert, the vestiges
of L.A.'s mid-century design heritage are beacons to the urban fossil
hunter. "Miramar Melmac Dinnerware," reads the stylish if understated
sign that hovers over the 710 Freeway on Ford Street in East L.A. Kicky
colored plastic dishes accented with futuristic motifs may not figure
prominently in the Martha Stewart kitchen, but Melmac dinnerware was
quite the thing during Southern California's postwar boom years.</LD>
<LD>   Melmac is the trade name for melamine, a sturdy hard plastic developed
in the World War II era by the ominous-sounding American Cyanamid Corp.
For better or worse, Melmac dinnerware symbolized the postwar modernist
ethos of affordable mass-produced design. From the late 1940s to the
early '60s, hundreds of companies manufactured Melmac serving ware in
Atomic Age patterns and memorable contemporary shades such as salmon and
olive green. Manufacturers snagged mid-century design names such as
Russel Wright (dubbed 'The Original Modfather' by one collector site) and
Irving Harper of George Nelson Associates(creator of the sublime
"Marshmallow Sofa" made by Herman Miller during the '50s) to create arty,
sophisticated Melmac pieces that are highly collectible today.</LD>
<TE>   Melmac names ranged from the fanciful-Air Flite, Harmony House,
Branchell and L.A.'s own Miramar-to the ridiculous-Aztec, Rivieraware,
Debonaire. All were mainstays in many a postwar kitchen, though Melmac
proved vulnerable to a variety of ailments, including scratches, stains
and scalding. Still, modern-day devotees calling themselves Melmaniacs
troll dealers' collections for surviving pieces, snapping up finds at
prices that are respectable, if unlikely to generate an "Antiques
Roadshow" gasp. On a given day you can find several Miramar Melmac pieces
posted on EBay in shades of orange, aqua or pink, or perhaps in the
line's Bird of Paradise pattern (look for the manufacturer's imprint on
the underside).</TE>
<TE>   The old Miramar Melmac factory on Ford Street is still bustling,
though it's no longer churning out turquoise serving bowls or plates
festooned with bird of paradise motifs. La Fortaleza, a supplier of
tortilla products to the restaurant industry, has been on the premises
since 1980. "I think they went to Valencia," says tortilla kingpin Ramiro
Ortiz Sr. of the former occupants-although efforts to track them down in
Valencia proved, well, fruitless. "However," he points out, "what we make
is still round." "A couple of years ago someone came in and asked for the
sign," adds Ramiro Ortiz Jr. "We told them no. We like it. It's our sign.
It's a landmark."</TE>

Cal State Northridge for the "Day of Puppetry Jamboree." Hosted by the
Los Angeles Guild of Puppetry, the affair featured workshops with titles
such as "Anatomy of a Hand Puppet" and "How to Write a Great TV Script
for Puppets." We spoke with a few incurable hams, whose handlers may have
been pulling our strings.</LD>

<LD>Accessories designer Beth Frank didn't deliberately set out to
trample on the conventional wisdom as to how to build a hot fashion
business. It was more like a happy instance of what Zen mystics would
call 'beginner's mind.' When the frustrated former entertainment
assistant quit her job, she says, she knew absolutely nothing about the
fashion industry. 'I had never read Vogue, even at the airport,'
confesses Frank, 34. 'What I didn't know-like, ah, how to sew, draw,
sketch, design-would fill a book.'</LD>
<LD>   But the creative spark was a different story. Frank had a vision:
transforming her flea market stash of funky old stainless steel buckles
and monochrome vintage belts with a riotous brace of rhinestone color.
'All I needed was the glue,' says the designer, whose retail space FRANK
opened in October across the street from the Farmers Market.</LD>
<LD>   Since that glue outlay one year ago, Frank's artsy, one-of-a-kind
buckles and hand-tooled painted belts ($275), vintage purses ($325) and
watches ($650) have appeared on many of Hollywood's chichi limbs and hips
and have sold in stores such as Barneys New York, Fred Segal and Henri
Bendel (United States), Harvey Nichols and Fenwicks (London) and Colette
(Paris). 'When a rep here in L.A. first called about representing me, she
said they needed a belt line at their retail mart. I did not know the
meaning of the words 'rep,' 'mart,' or 'line,' ' she laughs. 'I took the
meeting. And then I got to work.'</LD>
<TE>   In the artist's workshop (that would be the rear of the FRANK store),
scores of naked umber, black and brown leather belts dangle from windows,
stairs and rafters primed for paint, while tub-sized boxes stuffed with
thousands of un-glitzed buckles clutter the walkways. 'I can't help but
feel this was one of the Lana Turner-at-the-drug-counter experiences,'
Frank says. 'I've learned literally by jumping in the water and flapping
my arms. It's been the most interesting swim I've had in my life.' In the
tough fashionita world, certainly a nice pond if you can successfully
make the plunge.</TE>

sunbathers and, aided by fellow Long Beach grommets, dragged the 10-foot

the 1960s, O'Mahoney, who's the son of TV Tarzan Jock O'Mahoney and
half-brother to 'Gidget' girl Sally Field, slashed it up tough in the
Huntington Beach West Coast surf contest, though he wouldn't earn a top
trophy until 1993. In 1976, he pocketed $500 a day as a skateboarding
Ronald McDonald for a TV commercial filmed at Santa Monica's legendary
Bellagio banks, the same slopes where Dogtown's Z-Boys carved history.</LD>
<LD>   Today O'Mahoney, 56, is a professional surfer, skateboarder and
photographer, but his memories and much more reside on a narrow side
street along downtown Santa Barbara's waterfront. O'Mahoney's Santa
Barbara Surfing Museum cradles a diverse collection of surf memorabilia
and all things related. For starters, he's arranged flowery aloha shirts
near Bing Crosby's ukulele. Grass skirts sway alongside a 1958 Fender
Stratocaster played by surf-guitar king Dick Dale. Mellow surf tunes
whisper from speakers hidden behind bamboo walls near which are displayed
a quiver of surf-era skateboards.</LD>
<TE>   But coolest of all are the surfboards: towering stands and overhead
rows of some 50 rare and vintage redwood and balsa boards shaped by
masters such as Renny Yater, Greg Noll and Bob Simmons. There's also an
aircraft-aluminum replica of the Silver Surfer comic book character's
surfboard, which O'Mahoney says 'goes like seven times the speed of light
in outer space, but in the ocean, it's really lame.' Another highlight is
former Los Angeles Times publisher Otis Chandler's 1940s-era Pacific
Systems 10-footer, ridden in the Santa Monica surf by the newspaperman on
his first date with his first wife.</TE>
<TE>   O'Mahoney's most famous conversation piece? The 8 1/2-foot imitation
Yater belonging to Lt. Col. Bill Kilgore, played by Robert Duvall in
1979's 'Apocalypse Now.' 'A few years ago I was offered $25,000 for it,'
he says, 'but there's nothing for sale here.' That would include
admission: In O'Mahoney's museum, it's always free to ride the waves of
nostalgia.</TE>

<LD>You'd think it would be easy to find a designer-quality model of
the Chrysler Building in New York. But when Marcus Brandly tried while
residing in Gotham during the mid-'90s, he was disappointed. "They were
little 5- or 6-inch tabletop casts for tourists," recalls the West
Hollywood resident. Others might have settled for a nice photo, but
Brandly was obsessed. "The Chrysler Building is the most extravagant
example of Art Deco architecture. That building almost has a magical
spell on me." There appeared just one solution: Build it himself. Little
did he know he would also be building a new career.</LD>
<LD>   The task wasn't altogether farfetched. After all, Brandly had been
building models since he was a kid (granted, out of a box), and he had
earned a mechanical engineering degree in his native Switzerland. He also
had most of the necessary tools through his then-job of fashioning
prototypes for a New York inventor. Brandly obtained drawings of the
building from the New York City Department of Buildings, took hundreds of
photographs, measured ground-level doors and windows and even faked an
appointment with a dentist on the Chrysler's upper levels to get closer
to the skyscraper's deco-gothic gargoyles (made of radiator caps, in the
Chrysler's case). While the receptionist searched her appointment book,
Brandly was at the window snapping photos.</LD>
<TE>   Two years later back in Los Angeles, he put the finishing touches on a
4-foot-tall, 257:1 scale Chrysler Building model prototype constructed
mainly of smoked acrylic and resin and reproducible within weeks. One of
the first to see the piece was Emmy award-winning production designer Roy
Christopher, who had commissioned props from Brandly in the past. (As a
neon artist during the late '80s and early '90s, Brandly created custom
fabrications, including "RoboCop 2's" brain and a neon backdrop for a
Playboy shoot starring a little-known actress named Pamela Anderson.)
Christopher commissioned Brandly to construct a model building for a TV
show whose plot line involved real estate investment (the result,
needless to say, had deco touches). Christopher also commissioned a stage
model for the 2001 Oscars.</TE>
<TE>   About this time, Brandly began another valentine to Art Deco
architecture, a model of L.A.'s Pan Pacific Auditorium, a classic built
in 1935 that burned down in 1989. "It's one of those icons which are
timeless," he says. Unable to locate original drawings, he used old
photos to gauge measurements and scale. The Pan Pacific's original color
took further detective work. "When I asked around, some people said pink.
Others said green or brown," Brandly recalls. By chiseling multiple
layers of paint from a surviving lamppost at the site, he found the
answer-an unapologetic green.</TE>
<TE>   He recently completed a model of Anaheim's Edison Field for an
upcoming girl action flick and is working on a model of the Empire State
Building, which Brandly will sell along with his other architectural
models at his new La Cienega gallery and studio, ARTpiece (the gallery
also features work by other artists). For his next L.A. landmark, Brandly
is thinking City Hall or Bullocks Wilshire. "L.A. is not very good to its
history," he laments. "But I can bring a little back for your personal
pleasure."</TE>

<DH>How Did Pastor Matthew Barnett Build the Decidedly Downscale 'Dream
Center' Into One of the Fastest-Growing Churches in the U.S.?</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The truck and its cartons of free food--this morning a collection
of oranges, grapes, raisins, bread, celery and green beans--arrived at
this corner deep in Echo Park at 9:30 and people were already waiting.
Now, an hour later, the line still stretches around the corner. There are
Asian and Anglo faces in line, but most are Latino, mothers with a child
or two in tow, a few old men. No one in line is saying much, the air
unusually muggy.</LD>
<LD>   In the back of the truck, where everyone is sweating profusely, the
workers have an assembly line going: hands flying, bodies twisting as
they put food into containers and hand them down to the waiting people.
It was all moving smoothly until about a minute ago, when the worker
whose job it is to pass out the food got involved in a convoluted
conversation with a broad-faced, middle-aged woman in black.</LD>
<LD>   He's a slight young man in sweats and running shoes, with wispy blond
hair and the features of an earnest teenager. He's a head shorter than
the woman, who is attempting to reply to his rudimentary Spanish with
rudimentary English. It's clear neither has much idea what the other is
saying, and they're both laughing about it. In the back of the truck, the
workers are growing impatient. Finally the girl in charge of the grapes
plucks one from the bunch she's holding, cocks her arm and beans the
slight young man in the back of the head.</LD>
<TE>   "You're holding up the works, pastor," she says.</TE>
<TE>   The assault brings laughter and catcalls from the people in line, from
the workers in the truck and from other church workers busy sweeping the
sidewalks and cleaning up this poor and dilapidated neighborhood. Matthew
Barnett grins, wipes grape juice from his hair and thrusts the food into
the woman's arms. The 28-year-old is the pastor, founder and prime
motivator of the Dream Center, which is impressing church-growth experts
and is being hailed as a model for how to conduct a massive inner-city
social ministry while also appealing to throngs of worshipers. The church
has drawn accolades--including one from President Bush--and at the same
time has raised red flags among some more tradition-minded religious
authorities. None of which matters at the moment.</TE>
<TE>   "How many people love Jesus today?" Barnett calls out to all around.
They call back:</TE>
<TE>   "I do!"</TE>
<TE>   "I do!"</TE>
<TE>   "I do!"</TE>
<TE>   John Vaughan is the director of church growth today, a research center
in Bolivar, Mo. As one of the country's foremost church-growth experts,
he calls the Dream Center one of the fastest-growing churches in the U.S.
Playing a numbers game is a little tricky, though. Barnett's church has
no membership rolls, which more traditional churches use to gauge their
size. What can be said is that the church regularly draws more than 5,000
people to its several worship services each week, a startling increase
over the initial 30 congregants it had seven years ago. Even more
striking is Vaughan's prediction that the church could become one of the
largest in the country; Barnett hopes for 100,000 worshipers in the not
so distant future.</TE>
<TE>   Megachurches are not a new phenomenon. Southern California is home to
several that arose during the past two decades, including Faithful
Central Bible Church, which had a congregation of about 200 in 1982. It
purchased the Forum in Inglewood in December 2000 and this year drew a
crowd of 15,000 for an Easter Sunday worship service and reenactment of
Jesus' arrival in Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   What distinguishes Barnett's church, though, is the staggering array
of 200 ministries that operate from the former Queen of Angels Hospital,
towering above the Hollywood Freeway near Alvarado Street, just a few
miles from the new $200-million Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels. Some
of the ministries conduct church services for different ethnic
communities, but the vast majority are social-service programs targeted
at gang members and other at-risk youth, prostitutes, AIDS patients, the
homeless, the hungry, drug addicts--the list goes on. There's even a
ministry for transsexuals.</TE>
<TE>   Building a church by focusing on the immediate, temporal needs of
potential worshipers--"customers," as Barnett sometimes calls them--isn't
new. What some call the New Church Movement has been employing the
technique for years, striving to build large congregations by creating a
user-friendly atmosphere. But for the most part the resulting
megachurches sprouted In affluent suburban communities and provided
services designed for upscale congregations.</TE>
<TE>   Barnett's church, however, has grown up in the heart of the city, in
one of L.A.'s poorer neighborhoods, where the "customers" for whom its
programs are targeted are those on the margins of society. Its ministries
reach 500,000 people a month. This surprises no one more than Barnett,
who nearly quit in frustration months after coming to L.A. to be a
pastor.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, the 20-year-old Barnett--who once wanted to be a sports
announcer and who, as a teenager, spent weekends going from church to
church as a traveling evangelist--found himself the pastor of Bethel
Temple in Echo Park. Once one of the vibrant centers of the religious
revival that swept Southern California in the early 1900s, Bethel Temple
had fallen into a long and sad decline. Barnett's job was to turn that
around. That task alone was enough pressure for a young man taking up his
first major position. But Barnett also bore the weight of his father's
dreams: For 35 years the senior Barnett, Tommy, a famous preacher who had
pastored large and well-known churches in Iowa and Arizona, had cherished
the notion of building a church in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   At Bethel Temple, the young Barnett's congregation consisted of just
30 people--Filipinos, most over the age of 60. But he was confident that
with the traditional tools of church building--creating a great choir,
refurbishing the building, preaching rousing sermons--he eventually could
establish a thriving church. Events took a different course. During his
first several months in the job, Barnett's flock lost interest one by
one. One Sunday Barnett peered out from the back of the church to gauge
his congregation. What he saw, sitting there, patiently waiting for the
service to begin, was a congregation of exactly two. Recalling the
embarrassment of that moment eight years later, Barnett still gives a
little shudder.</TE>
<TE>   Watching his flock desert him was bad enough for the preacher's son
accustomed to the thousands who crowded his father's services. But
Barnett also faced a mutiny among the young people from his father's
church in Phoenix who'd volunteered to help out. They had held a private
meeting and concluded that it was time for them to move on. "I just went
home and wept," Barnett recalls. "It was all down to absolutely nothing.
I was ready to go home and tell my father I'd failed. Instead, something
in me said to go out and take a walk in Echo Park."</TE>
<TE>   Barnett is sitting at his desk in his spare, businesslike office at
the Dream Center, just off the conference area they call the War Room,
where part of the church's weekly TV program is taped--it airs on the
Trinity Broadcasting Network--and where people brainstorm, pray and study
the Bible. He looks like a kid who wandered in by mistake and decided to
try the pastor's chair. Leaning forward and eager, he describes how,
after his moment of doubt and despair, he developed a plan to turn things
around. "We had set out to establish a traditional sort of church,"
Barnett says. "We wanted to minister to the inner city, but basically it
was a traditional kind of church. And we thought that's what success was,
building a big, traditional church." He smiles. "Fine, except it didn't
work."</TE>
<TE>   So that night he walked around the neighborhood, past the bodegas, the
little mom-and-pop stores, the Chinese and Mexican restaurants, past the
grimy apartments, the little bungalows with peeling paint. The
gangbangers were out doing their thing. There were homeless people
pushing shopping carts, drunks mumbling to themselves. Barnett took it
all in. "And suddenly it came to me," he remembers. "I came alive to the
idea that we should be a blessing to this community, not a church that
had set itself apart like many other churches had. And to be able to be a
blessing, you have to put yourself into the lives of the people."</TE>
<TE>   If this was the community he wanted to serve, he realized, then the
people who lived in it were his "customers." Like a businessman with a
start-up, he set out to learn what they needed. First, he literally moved
his office out to the sidewalk and greeted anyone passing by. He started
going door to door in his free time, introducing himself, inviting the
residents to the church and, most important, asking questions: What can
we do to serve you? What do you need?</TE>
<TE>   Barnett eventually expanded on this idea. Every Saturday morning, he
and a couple of assistants and local volunteers would pick a nearby block
and knock on the door of every home and apartment. "It took awhile for
people to open up, overcome their doubts," says Barnett. "They'd have too
much pride to say they needed something. Or they'd look at me like they
didn't really believe me, like, 'Hey, you're just some kid.' We had to
earn the right to be heard by them. We had to gain the consumers' trust."</TE>
<TE>   The first breakthrough came a few months later. Behind the church was
a dirt lot with a basketball hoop; a church member had added benches and
weights. One day a couple neighborhood teenagers approached Barnett. "You
the preacher going around the neighborhood asking what people need?" the
boys wanted to know. Barnett said he was. "OK," they said, "what we need
is a place to lift weights." They seemed extraordinarily insistent.</TE>
<TE>   Barnett told them they were welcome to use the weights and the dirt
lot. But he was curious about their urgency. Well, the teens explained,
we need to bulk up quick. We're getting to that age where we can expect
to be going off to prison.</TE>
<TE>   Seeing those boys planning for the time when they would be sent away
gave Barnett a perspective he probably could have acquired no other way.
"As a pastor," he says, "I think you prepare yourself to meet people who
lost their way. But to listen to those kids who just had no hope of
anything else, those kids--" He shakes his head. "I'm not going to tell
you it was some really major revelation. It was more like just realizing
that this is really what you're called to do."</TE>
<TE>   Barnett built on the breakthrough with the weightlifters by organizing
other ministries. Aided by a handful of volunteers, he put together
parcels of food--some of it donated, some purchased out of his own
pocket--and delivered them to local people who were hungry. Homeless
people were bused to the church, fed from the donated supplies and urged
to attend services. Many people in the neighborhood faced immigration
difficulties; they were directed to advice and assistance from legal
clinics and pro-bono attorneys. Bethel Temple owned some vacant houses in
the neighborhood; these were turned into residential support centers for
addicts.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next six months or so, into 1995, attendance at services
steadily rose to more than 500, approaching Bethel Temple's limit. What's
more, new programs were constantly being added. Many days the area around
the church would be jammed with homeless people and others coming for
help. Congestion and the general bustle around the place were increasing
and Barnett was afraid neighborhood nerves would begin to fray.</TE>
<TE>   Gloria Sanchez, who lives in an apartment near Bethel Temple, attended
services there and then followed Barnett to the Dream Center. She
remembers walking to services one day and finding herself in the middle
of what she thought was a demonstration: "People everywhere, buses
stopped in the middle of the street, cars, cars, cars. What's going on?
Well, somebody had forgotten to unlock the door!" She laughs. "Pastor had
to go out and direct traffic!"</TE>
<TE>   Clearly the church needed a new--and bigger--building.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of miles up the freeway from Bethel Temple rose the white
towers of Queen of Angels Hospital, its buildings sprawled across nine
acres, empty, dilapidated and smeared with graffiti. Driving around one
day, still thinking in terms of a traditional church building to house
his growing congregation, Barnett stopped at Queen of Angels for a look.
Allowed by a watchman to tour the 1926 building, Barnett became entranced
by the litter-strewn labyrinth of decay.</TE>
<TE>   Wouldn't these rooms be perfect for the homeless? Couldn't this tower
shelter volunteers from all over the world? Wouldn't this meeting room
make a perfect medical center?</TE>
<TE>   The whole notion seemed crazy. What use could they possibly make of
all that space? And besides, the building's owner was asking for more
than $10 million for the property--a considerable sum for anyone to
contemplate, let alone the young pastor of a church whose congregation
was composed in large measure of street people. But the more Barnett
thought and prayed about it, the more perfect it all seemed. He infused
his initially skeptical father with an equal zeal for the old building.
Negotiations commenced and eventually the owner agreed to a sale price of
$3.9 million, the kicker being that it had to be paid within 18 months.
Should the deadline go unmet, the collateral--Bethel Temple--would be
lost.</TE>
<TE>   "Talk about going on faith," Barnett says.</TE>
<TE>   The Assemblies of God, the Pentecostal Protestant denomination to
which the Barnetts belong, swung into action. More importantly, Barnett's
father swung into action. It was the senior Barnett who, on a visit to
Los Angeles nearly 35 years earlier, had driven past Angelus Temple,
Aimee Semple McPherson's grandly extravagant Echo Park legacy, and
conceived his own vision of building an inner-city church. In the decades
since, the senior Barnett had become one of the foremost pastors in the
Assemblies of God, a dynamic and sought-after speaker, nationally known
from his books and TV appearances. Now he began crisscrossing the
country, tapping into an extensive network of acquaintances and potential
donors and preaching at every church that would have him, with that day's
offering being dedicated to the cause.</TE>
<TE>   Money began trickling in. "There were times when we really didn't
think we were going to make it," the younger Barnett remembers. "We would
pray, but it would just seem impossible. My father was exhausting
himself. We'd talk on the phone every day and sometimes both of us would
just cry."</TE>
<TE>   But contributions began to flow more strongly, bolstered by the
occasional large check from a major benefactor. Those seemed to arrive
just at the moment when everything seemed most hopeless. In the end, the
deadline was met, the contract fulfilled. On that day, Barnett stood on
the roof of the hospital, beneath which lies the whole sweep of Los
Angeles from the hills to the downtown towers. He prayed, thanking God.
And then he leapt into the air, pumping his arms, like one of his
basketball heroes who's just made a game-winning three-pointer. (Bethel
Temple remains an Assemblies of God church but is not part of the Dream
Center.)</TE>
<TE>   Today, the Dream Center is a $10-million-a-year operation, with much
of the equipment, supplies and vehicles donated, the programs supported
by offerings, donations from benefactors and the untiring fund-raising of
the senior Barnett. There's a paid staff of 25 and a volunteer staff of
200. All of this is overseen by Barnett, who draws a salary of $60,000 a
year.</TE>
<TE>   Jesus Alva is a longtime resident of the neighborhood surrounding the
Dream Center. "Having the hospital there, that was one thing," he says,
watching a church bus pull up and disgorge a load of worshipers. "But
then this church. There were all these new people everywhere. Cars and
buses everywhere on Sunday. We didn't know if we liked it."</TE>
<TE>   Like those neighbors leery of the congestion and commotion associated
with what Barnett had created in their midst, some religious leaders are
uneasy about the needs-based approach to building a congregation.
Differences of opinion over what a church should be are nothing new, of
course: In broadest terms, they date back 2,000 years to the
church-planting journeys of Paul and the other Apostles. But the debate
has gained fresh energy during the past 20 years with the growth of the
New Church--or, as some call it, the Next Church--Movement.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways an American phenomenon, the New Church Movement has set
aside centuries of Christian European tradition and many of the
generations-old trappings associated with it. In place of hard pews and
kneelers, solemn hymns and pipe organs, rote prayers and doctrine and
fire and brimstone, the New Churches feature a relaxed atmosphere,
contemporary music that is often rock-inspired and a message that cuts
across denominational lines. It also focuses on solving contemporary
problems, and emphasizes both the temporal and spiritual needs of the
flock.</TE>
<TE>   The New Churches that have sprung up as a part of this movement are
often huge, often independent and often firm believers in using secular
marketing strategies to attract more loyalists. The largest and best
known of them sometimes supplement worship with, for instance, sports
leagues, workshops in drama and dance, classes in "divorce dynamics,"
"women in the workplace" and "life development" and ministries aimed at
their suburban members.</TE>
<TE>   "The emphasis on a consumer agenda by churches in many ways merely
represents a part of the larger society's emphasis on consumer rights
with 24-hour supermarkets and enhanced customer service and so forth,"
says Lyle E. Schaller, an author and independent scholar of the New
Church movement.</TE>
<TE>   By focusing on service over services, critics say the New Churches may
risk overlooking some elements that should be at the heart of their
faith, including awe, reverence, fear of God's judgment for sins, and
redemption through Christ--in short, the fire-and-brimstone parts.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, churches should be out working for the social good," says the
Rev. John MacArthur, pastor of Grace Community Church in Sun Valley and a
well-known author, teacher and broadcaster, "but they also need to
remember that their primary responsibility is for the soul. The message
must always be the Gospel and salvation, and the problem is that
importing too much of the everyday culture risks diluting that central
message. Church has to be about substance and not just style."</TE>
<TE>   "The point is never numbers," says Marva Dawn, a theologian, author
and teaching fellow at Regent College in Vancouver, British Columbia.
"The point is being faithful. If we don't focus on helping people deal
with sin and redemption, then we are losing the essence of why
Christianity matters. The so-called New Churches have to remember that."</TE>
<TE>   The Dream Center shares characteristics of a New Church, but "it is a
unique place," says Donald Miller, director of the Center for Religion
and Civic Culture at USC. He's also familiar with the Dream Center
through one of his former students, a one-time drummer in the church's
band. "It's one of what I call the new-paradigm churches that are
flowering with the use of nontraditional methods and a real openness to
the Holy Spirit. But what they've done is added this whole dimension of
an incredible social ministry. It's distinctive, a very attractive model.
It's a church, but it's also something more."</TE>
<TE>   While Barnett wants the Dream Center to be thought of as "That
Church," or "The 24-Hour Church," he allows it's really more like a
movement. About 130 other churches around the country have affiliated
with the Dream Center, almost like franchises, by taking on the name and
the desire to plunge heavily into social ministry.</TE>
<TE>   Barnett says he takes to heart the criticisms that have been raised
about the New Church Movement. "I know that it's possible to get too sold
on, too involved in, trying to reach out to secular needs, even if those
needs are critical, like breaking addiction. I know that and I want to
make sure that every ministry we start points back to Jesus Christ." He
says he intends to stay focused on prayer. "I know that I have to stay
vertical."</TE>
<TE>   Across the sprawling campus of the former hospital there's activity
seven days a week, nearly 24 hours a day.</TE>
<TE>   People are everywhere, the parking lot always filled with the buses
used to transport volunteers or haul worshipers. The center has nearly
500 residents, some in rehab for various problems, some in the AIDS
hospice. Volunteers come from across the country to spend a year working
on the streets. There's a bookstore, a cafeteria that serves 1,500 meals
a day, a martial arts class, a Christian school for grades 3-12, several
Bible study programs, a vocational training center, a wellness center
that provides medical treatment and also sends a mobile clinic out into
the neighborhoods. Off to one side is the brightly painted Metro Kidz
truck that drives out into the community and puts on a combination
variety show and worship service for kids. The Dream House Studio, a
professional-quality recording studio, is run by David Hanley, who
oversees the production of Dream House CDs and also directs the band and
singers.</TE>
<TE>   You'll find offices for the Cambodian ministry, the Filipino ministry,
the El Shaddai ministry for the transsexual community, the food ministry,
which oversees the distribution of 65,000 pounds of donated and federal
surplus food every week; the Dream Street ministry, which dispatches
volunteers to Skid Row; the discipleship program whose members, former
street people, head back to the streets to preach and counsel. Many of
the ministries were the inventions of community members who saw a
particular need and came to the Dream Center for office space, financial
assistance and guidance. All of the activity, of course, has brought to
the surrounding neighborhood of modest homes and apartments a level of
commotion that escalates on Sundays or during special events such as the
Christmas program, when toys and food are given away to needy kids and
families. Barnett is aware of the importance of keeping the neighbors
happy, so every day young residents of various programs at the Dream
Center are dispatched to sweep the streets and sidewalks, tidy the lawns,
paint out graffiti and do various chores for homeowners.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good for the kids and it's good for the residents," says
Barnett. "And, sure, it's good public relations for us."</TE>
<TE>   Watching the Sunday buses pull up, Jesus Alva agrees. "All this
started up and we weren't sure about it. Was this a good thing or not?
But people from the church would come around and knock on the door and
say who they are and did I need something. They were out there sweeping
and painting. They wanted to be good neighbors. Nice and polite and
happy. Now I go there myself sometimes."</TE>
<TE>   Barnett and the dream center have embarked on another great leap into
the unknown. Seeing Angelus Temple had inspired the senior Barnett's
dream of establishing an inner-city Los Angeles church. That circle
closed last fall when the Dream Center took over Angelus Temple and the
younger Barnett became pastor there in addition to the Dream Center. He
set in motion a project to refurbish by this month the temple's main
auditorium.</TE>
<TE>   This is a major step toward further growth, finally solving what
proved</TE>
<TE>   to be a problem with the former hospital's floor plan: Its only large
meeting space was a gymnasium that could seat just 700 people. The only
way to accommodate the growing congregation was by adding more and more
services; sometimes there simply wasn't room for everyone. But beneath
its soaring dome and eight magnificent stained-glass windows, the main
auditorium of Angelus Temple will allow 3,500 people to worship at once.</TE>
<TE>   As a manager, Matthew Barnett's style continues to develop but seems
characterized by calmness and a real desire to empower others. "It's all
based on giving permission," says Aaron Jayne, an associate pastor and
one of Barnett's earliest staffers. "Pastor is not into micromanagement
at all." Instead, says Jayne, Barnett's notion is that "if you encourage
people to have their own dreams and then release them to carry those
dreams out, they remain enthusiastic and loyal. He's a great CEO."</TE>
<TE>   As he moves from one meeting to another or gives precise instructions
to an assistant, Barnett does seem the young executive, engrossed in the
business of his company. But he says he is determined to keep himself
rooted in the Dream Center's mission; on many Saturdays he goes knocking
on doors as part of Adopt-a-Block or participates in food programs. And
every service at the Dream Center ends with an altar call, when those
facing some particular trial or those simply feeling a special presence
of Christ are urged onstage to kneel and pray.</TE>
<TE>   On this particular Sunday, as soft music plays and the lights dim,
people come forward, old and young, in fine clothes or jeans. They pray.
Dream Center pastors move among them, joining their prayers. Kneeling by
the lectern is a crying young woman, thick, dark hair falling forward to
cover her face, her shoulders trembling. Barnett kneels beside her. He
places his hand on her head and leans close.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, Lord, lift this burden. Oh, Lord . . . Oh, Lord . . . " he prays.
The woman takes his hand and holds it for a moment. Then Barnett stands
and raises his hands. "Praise the Lord," he says above the murmuring of
prayer. And on his face there is a look of pure, serene joy.</TE>

<HD>Secession's Seductive Undertow</HD>
<DH>For Many Who Live in the San Fernando Valley, Breaking Away From
Los Angeles Isn't  About Taxes and City Services. It's About Yearning for
Simpler Times, Respect and Other Desires Unvoiced in the Public Debate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NITA LELYVELD</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles may be just a few months away from being dismantled. in
one November day at the polls, the nation's second-largest metropolis
could lose half its territory and become, at least in the big-city big
leagues, a mere shadow of its former self.</LD>
<LD>   While pollsters and pundits attempt to measure the pulse of the city,
it's unclear how many Angelenos care about this deeply. What is clear is
that secessionists, once written off as crazies, are energized and
mobilized and seem to be striking a chord. They argue that outlying parts
of Los Angeles don't get their fair share of city services. They rattle
off statistics--the San Fernando Valley has fewer police officers, some
parts of Los Angeles have more libraries, the city isn't repaving their
streets, trees are not being trimmed. In the coming months, Angelenos
following the debate could easily drown in statistics and city budget
number crunching. But dollars and cents aren't what makes secession so
seductive.</LD>
<LD>   The real allure is in this pitch: Los Angeles is too big. Smaller is
better.</LD>
<TE>   Secessionists hold that idea up against their own experiences and it
seems to fit. It capitalizes on a yearning for simpler times, for a
chance to be heard without shouting so hard, for respite from the
big-city problems lapping right up to suburban front doors. People want
to catch their breath in a place where change can seem relentless. They
want to feel more in control.</TE>
<TE>   Countering that powerful emotional draw is difficult. The city's sheer
size--about 470 square miles--is overwhelming. Its City Council members
each represent nearly a quarter million people. Its mountains and
freeways cut parts of the city off from each other. Making a sprawling,
multicentered city feel united is no easy task.</TE>
<TE>   This is a city, after all, whose very history may argue against deep
communal bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles grew from a small, sleepy town to a big city not because
of its natural assets. It didn't have many. Unlike San Francisco or
Seattle or New York, it didn't abut a big natural harbor or rivers that
made it a perfect center for manufacturing.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles grew because its boosterish leaders willed its growth.
They fought hard to make the railways land at their doorstep. They
brought in water to turn a desert into something more lush and inviting.</TE>
<TE>   Cities whose growth was driven by their rivers and harbors quickly
developed strong downtown centers, dense with people whose livelihoods
depended on location. When the downtown areas filled with people,
buildings grew taller to accommodate them. Even today in New York, Boston
and other cities, residents rub shoulders in crowded subway cars, on busy
downtown sidewalks, in elevators. Lives in densely built, more
traditional cities are full of close encounters and shared experience.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, skyscrapers and huge apartment buildings are more the
exception than the rule. People don't have to do so much sharing. They
can more easily exist in their own bubbles, seeing their fellow citizens
from behind car windshields, rarely encountering crowds except at
ballgames or concerts.</TE>
<TE>   They can do so because Los Angeles grew out rather than up. Downtown
Los Angeles was still a pretty new place when a vast network of electric
railways made living outside the center easy. There was open land all
around, and the city's leaders, many of whom were also land speculators,
encouraged people to settle on the outlying lots they were promoting.
Streetcar owners were developers, too, and they made it easy to commute
from new subdivisions to downtown jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Then the automobile caught on, and by 1920, the city's still young
downtown was jammed with cars. Streetcars whose rails shared the crowded
streets began moving more slowly in traffic. Rather than battle the
congestion and the higher downtown property costs, industries and
businesses moved to residential neighborhoods. Railway lines, losing
their riders, were dismantled. Before long, the old downtown was just one
of a number of business districts, not a true city center.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles' rapid growth occurred not organically but through
large-scale acquisition. Without a natural harbor, the city wanted to
create one, so in 1906 it obtained a shoestring of land between Los
Angeles, San Pedro and Wilmington, and then wooed those communities in
1909 to join the city.</TE>
<TE>   The city needed water to expand. It was imported, and doled out only
to those communities willing to join it. Hollywood came aboard in 1910.
The San Fernando Valley was annexed in 1915.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of other communities joined, too, out of expediency more than
love. "They were over the barrel, so to speak, and the barrel contained
water," says Michael Dear, director of the Southern California Studies
Center at USC. "This is a place that has been patched together."</TE>
<TE>   The city's political structure mirrored the sprawl. From its earliest
days, L.A. was proud to be different from older, grimier, more crowded
cities. Instead of the big-city machine politics of many Eastern cities,
which were ruled by powerful mayors, Los Angeles spread the power around.
City Council members had more clout here, the mayor, less. It is all very
democratic, but a government of council members who are primarily
beholden to their districts dilutes the notion of shared interests.</TE>
<TE>   Without any common city center, many Angelenos focus on the parts of
the city that are central to their lives. They have a cult of hearth, a
devotion to their own homes and neighborhoods. They don't turn out in
large numbers to vote. Many wouldn't recognize the mayor if he passed by
them.</TE>
<TE>   A large number of Valley residents say they rarely venture over the
mountains to L.A. "I call everything over the hill downtown," says
Rosalind Boyd, who has lived in a small bungalow in the Lakeview Terrace
section of the northeast Valley for 30 years. "I don't know anything
about L.A. They give me an address, I get on the freeway to that address.
If they say 'Detour,' my heart skips a beat. And you know I can run all
over the Valley blindfolded and find my way."</TE>
<TE>   The city is so vast that even lifelong residents drive with
phonebook-sized road atlases. Those who drive long distances regularly do
most of their traveling on freeways, monotonous miles of cars and
concrete. It gives them little sense of the communities they are passing
through.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, a city assembled by patchwork and governed district by
district, whose residents are familiar only with their own small piece of
the whole, were never glued tightly together in the first place, and may
now break apart.</TE>
<TE>   In Hollywood, secessionists dream of a small, stylish city, its old
buildings and grand boulevard restored to their former glory. They see
tourists strolling down sidewalks, drawn to a place that lives up to the
glamour of its name.</TE>
<TE>   But it's in the San Fernando Valley where the desire for secession has
its deepest roots. Valley voters will additionally choose a name for
their would-be city when they go to the polls Nov. 5. Even if secession
doesn't pass, the vote will serve as a record of their hopes. In a public
meeting in April, more than 100 secessionists showed up to narrow the
choices to five. Their mood was jubilant, their rhetoric revolutionary.</TE>
<TE>   One man suggested Valparaiso--Spanish for Paradise Valley. A woman
gave a fiery speech about her choice: Liberty Valley. The overwhelming
favorite was simply San Fernando Valley, a place people said they'd be
glad to call home. The feelings were summed up by one man who reminisced
about being young in the 1960s, when "the Valley was the Valley and you
lived in the greatest place in the world."</TE>
<TE>   Secession leaders pushed hard for the most fanciful choice--Camelot,
which also made the list and may be the most fitting. For others, the
fairy-tale aspirations of the name evokes laughter. Camelot, they say, is
a far cry from the Valley's 222 square miles of endless tract homes,
mini-malls and gated McMansions.</TE>
<TE>   But desire often isn't rooted in reality. Supporters of secession are
full of desire--to turn back the clock, un-build the ugly buildings,
create cozy town centers with lots of green spaces where they can walk
with their families to restaurants, recreation centers and shops. This is
the dream of the future that hundreds of activists came up with when the
nonprofit Economic Alliance of the San Fernando Valley held meetings to
create Vision 2020, a road map for the Valley's next two decades.</TE>
<TE>   It's a vision that sounds a lot like the past, and that's just what
appeals to Dana Berg, who last year moved from Chatsworth to Portofino, a
luxury gated community in Porter Ranch. Her new place is on the edge of
the edge, pushed up to the very border of development at the foot of the
Santa Susana Mountains. Raised in the Valley, she's now come as close to
leaving it as she can without actually doing so.</TE>
<TE>   Other longtime Valley residents are heading out to newer suburban
havens in Calabasas, Santa Clarita, Valencia and Simi Valley. Berg
understands the impulse--to escape the graffiti and the petty crime and
the sense that big-city problems are heading their way fast.</TE>
<TE>   She thinks secession just might stop all of that. "I feel that by
living in the Valley my whole life, growing up and seeing how things have
changed, I just don't see good things happening." She reminisces about
the old days on her Chatsworth street, where neighbors mixed margaritas
and sat out together watching their children play. "With the economy, the
house values dropped low, and different types of people moved in. There
were problems with drugs, with noise, with loud people up all night," she
says.</TE>
<TE>   The Bergs have season tickets to the Lakers. They zip into downtown
Los Angeles for games, then zip out. Otherwise, Dana Berg has all she
needs nearby. She can drive a few minutes to the Starbuck's at the Porter
Ranch Town Center, a strip of shops that includes a sushi restaurant, a
Wal-Mart and a Toys 'R' Us. For dinner out, she and her husband like to
head farther west to Calabasas. Berg would be pleased if the Valley
seceded and were remade to resemble Calabasas or Porter Ranch--clean,
new, controlled developments occupied by fairly affluent families.</TE>
<TE>   Others in the Valley see Burbank or Glendale as the model for the
future--older, independent, small cities within the L.A. area that seem a
little better tended, a little more user-friendly than their neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the ideal, a lot of residents want the Valley to be a place
that celebrates itself, instead of being continuously sneered at from
over the hill. They see secession as an opportunity to redefine the
Valley not as a bland suburban slice of Los Angeles but as something
positive and distinct. They're sick of being Los Angeles' New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   "People say things like, 'She looks very Valleyish,' " says Jan
Zuchowski, 49, who grew up in Van Nuys and now lives in North Hollywood,
within walking distance of her Orthodox synagogue. "They hear where
you're from and you're identified as Valley, which isn't always meant
nicely. But I like the Valley. I like the smaller, the closer. I hate the
traffic in the city. I feel like I'm part of a small community."</TE>
<TE>   So many dreams are wrapped up in secession that satisfying them all
would be a tall order. Creating a new Valley city could be exciting--a
new mayor sworn in, a new city council convened for the first time. For
secessionists, the act of taking on a huge city and winning would be
tremendously empowering. There would be a sense of new energy, of people
taking control of their own fates, of plans to start transforming the
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   A new city of Hollywood would start life as a small place. The same
can't be said for a Valley city. It would be nearly the size of
Philadelphia, and in some places just as urban. It also wouldn't be new.
It's filled with old buildings and old problems. Parts of the Valley are
densely packed. One-third of Valley residents are foreign-born. People,
including new immigrants, would still keep moving in. Would the crime
rate fall? Would the Valley free itself of traffic jams? Could it be
transformed into a place of cozy town squares with cafes and shops and
lush, green parks? Would everyone agree on which community was first in
line for a fix?</TE>
<TE>   Would residents eventually find their desires still being unmet? Would
the wealthier West Valley want to split away from the poorer East Valley?
Would Porter Ranch then want to break away on its own? Maybe one day
every neighborhood in L.A. will be its own independent entity, with nary
a metropolitan government in sight.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe splitting a city that never was tightly stuck together is a good
idea. Maybe new, smaller cities would be better. Or maybe it would be
like yanking a loose yarn on a sweater, pulling and pulling and not
knowing where to stop.</TE>

<HD>A Terrorist's Second Thoughts</HD>
<DH>Twenty-six years after he killed an exiled Chilean ambassador, the
assassin and the victim's son, an L.A. muralist, understand a simple
truth about young men blinded by ideology</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC PAPE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Look into the face of Virgilio Pablo Paz Romero. Do you see a
terrorist?</LD>
<LD>   Sitting in Versailles, a sprawling Cuban restaurant in the heart of
Miami's Little Havana, the only thing that seems to separate Paz from the
middle-aged, Cuban-born fathers eating with their kids is the distinctive
cleft in his chin. There is no trace of the hardened gaze of his youth
three decades ago.</LD>
<LD>   Then he speaks, explaining intensely that he didn't realize how
American he had become until Sept. 11. "I see pictures, footage, and I
feel like crying. I never thought that anybody could do something like
that. The people who were killed could have been anybody. They had
children and families--and this was done because some religious fanatics
think that all infidels should have their same damn beliefs.</LD>
<TE>   "I was so shocked, so mad, so insulted by this atrocity that the only
thing I regret is not being 25 again to enlist and go kick ass," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Others said the same after the attacks, but Paz of all people should
understand. Half a lifetime ago, a similar passion led him to enlist in
another war. But on which side?</TE>
<TE>   In 1976, a decade after arriving in the U.S., Paz was stateless,
having refused U.S. citizenship amid his self-imposed exile from Cuba. "I
thought that becoming an American citizen was pledging allegiance to a
flag other than that of my fatherland. I never considered it." Then 24,
he was a member of a right-wing Cuban exile group that sought to
overthrow the Cuban government--an objective aligned with U.S. foreign
policy at the time. "That's how I got in trouble in the first place. The
fervor was there in me, and I always thought that we could make a change
and that it was our duty to do it."</TE>
<TE>   That year, he would cross paths with another exile, Orlando Letelier,
a former Chilean ambassador to the U.S. Letelier had been Chile's defense
minister on Sept. 11, 1973, the day Gen. Augusto Pinochet led a military
coup that toppled the elected leader, Salvador Allende, a socialist who
ruled in coalition with the Communist Party. Letelier, Pinochet's direct
superior, was arrested, nearly executed, and imprisoned for a year of
hard labor. He eventually was released on the condition that he go into
exile. He and his family fled to Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Others who survived the coup weren't so fortunate. In the ensuing
years, Pinochet's secret service eliminated his exiled critics one by
one--in Argentina, Italy and elsewhere. Letelier felt safe by comparison.
Tapping into his old diplomatic contacts in the United States, he began
to emerge as a charismatic exile leader, speaking out against the
U.S.-backed Pinochet government.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, Letelier and Paz were two halves of the same coin-- two
men living in exile in the United States, working against what they saw
were illegitimate and unjust dictatorships. If their paths crossed today,
they might enjoy each other's company. But an ideological abyss separated
them during the Cold War. Paz's enemy was a communist regime. Letelier
wanted a leftist government restored.</TE>
<TE>   On the overcast morning of Sept. 21, 1976, Letelier drove toward his
Washington office at the Institute for Policy Studies with two American
colleagues. Ronni Moffitt rode in the passenger seat of the baby blue
Chevrolet Chevelle; her husband, Michael, was in the back. They didn't
notice the late-model gray sedan tailing them. Inside were Paz and
Cuban-movement colleague Jose Dionisio Suarez Esquivel. When Letelier
reached Sheridan Circle on Washington's Embassy Row, Paz pushed a lever.
Letelier's car exploded. Fragments of glass and metal cascaded onto
neighboring embassy lawns.</TE>
<TE>   The bomb had been placed under the car, just to the right of
Letelier's seat. Still strapped into the seat, he mumbled for a few
seconds and then went silent. His legs had been blown off. A severed foot
remained in a shoe on the ground nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Michael survived without serious injury, but a piece of metal severed
Ronni's carotid artery. She died later at a hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The Pinochet regime had succeeded in murdering another political
opponent. Many Americans regarded it as a political assassination.</TE>
<TE>   To many Chileans, it was an act of terror.</TE>
<TE>   Miami's Cuban exiles, of course, have their own bogeyman. Most have
never seen Fidel Castro in person, and it is unimaginable they ever will.
But he is everywhere in Little Havana. Amid the U.S. flags, the
Spanish-language signs fronting small shops and the eternal flame for the
martyrs of Giron, he is conjured up daily--in messages scrawled onto
patches of cardboard and taped onto walls, painted in graffiti, typed in
leaflets, chanted in rallies.</TE>
<TE>   Extremist elements revile Castro as they conspire against him and
strip him of human traits. They baptize him: el dictator, el matador, el
diablo. They seek God's help against him. They have made him into an
integral part of their identity. Castro is the embodiment of their
disconnection, their dispossession, perhaps even their nostalgia.</TE>
<TE>   It is widely known that most Cuban exiles hate Castro, but few people
realize that many of those exiles also adored Pinochet. The more extreme
elements still do. Pinochet stopped his country's slide toward communism,
they say. He was a role model. That explains why Paz says he never
expected any financial payment for his role in the Letelier
assassination. It was an honor to be associated with Pinochet and the
professionals who worked for Chile. Paz's movement hoped that the
Pinochet regime might one day return the favor. They were all fighting
for freedom, all combating the communist tide. It only made sense that
they would collaborate, he thought.</TE>
<TE>   When Paz was 14, his family left the small town of Santa Clara, Cuba.
It was the mid-1960s, and girls were on his mind. Politics and communism
were abstractions until his father took his last breath, in Mexico City
in 1966, as the family awaited papers to migrate to the United States.
His father had hated communism. His death planted a seed in his son.</TE>
<TE>   After settling with his mother in a burgeoning Cuban community in New
Jersey, Paz was drawn toward political mentors who criticized the
communists. At 16, Paz became the youngest member of the small, radical
Cuban Nationalist Movement, an adolescent among angry and uprooted men.
The older exiles offered Paz an outlet for his youthful rage. They wanted
to overthrow the Cuban government. "We believed in being efficient and in
being committed," Paz says, his voice still proud.</TE>
<TE>   In America, Paz had little to lose. He was unmarried, childless,
careerless. He gave up his university studies for the exiles' war. In an
insular and nostalgic community, he found himself seeking acceptance, and
the price seemed to be dedication to the cause.</TE>
<TE>   When he first observed Letelier in Washington in September 1976, Paz
knew little about him. He had been told that Letelier was a friend of
Castro, which might have been enough for him. Paz had gone to Washington
because he was asked by fellow exiles to work there with Michael Townley,
an American who had spent several years as a hit man for Chile's secret
service. Paz insists that he did not know in advance that he was supposed
to assist in an assassination. The mission was one of reconnaissance, Paz
says.</TE>
<TE>   But then it changed. Townley received orders to take action. He
assembled the bomb in a hotel room with help from Paz and Suarez, whose
nickname was "charco de sangre"--puddle of blood.</TE>
<TE>   "Perhaps I should have left, but I didn't," Paz says. "God, I was
there. I was already part of the conspiracy." But Paz was hardly a
passive victim of circumstance. U.S. investigators later determined that
Paz and Suarez had helped Townley assemble the bomb, and that Paz and
Suarez had driven Townley to Letelier's home to plant it under his car.</TE>
<TE>   As for the FBI's conclusion that Paz pushed the lever that blew up the
car, Paz obliquely claims that he was in New Jersey when the car
exploded. Then he quickly changes the subject.</TE>
<TE>   If Paz was troubled by his involvement, as he now suggests, his fear
of criticism back then from his peers prevented him from abandoning the
mission. The ultimate shame for Paz would have been to not live up to his
commitment. "You don't believe," they would have said. "You aren't man
enough. You don't have the dedication."</TE>
<TE>   francisco javier letelier is one of four sons of orlando and isabel
Letelier. At 42, he is just two years younger than his father was when he
was killed. For more than a decade, Francisco has lived in an artist's
loft in the hardscrabble Oakwood neighborhood of Venice. He is a visual
artist. A lush, oversized painting of a Buddhist child in a saffron robe
is on the wall of an unfinished addendum to his work studio. The child,
head shaven, might look fragile were it not for the haunting,
aged-beyond-his-years wisdom of his eyes. The child seems beyond hatred.</TE>
<TE>   A year after the assassination, Francisco went to Cuba for a Youth
Festival and decided to study art. After returning to Washington, he
jumped on a Greyhound bus and moved to Oakland, where he attended an arts
college and painted murals, many in the Bay Area. In 1980, he traveled to
Nicaragua to paint murals as part of a literacy campaign, then returned
to California and earned a bachelor's degree from UC Berkeley in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   When Francisco speaks about his father's assassination today, it
becomes clear that every murder is, at its core, personal. Francisco
still imagines that he was awakened by a noise as a man slid under the
car in the driveway to plant the bomb--awakened only to fall back asleep.
He is still shaken by the knowledge that other family members used the
car before the explosion. He wonders about a world where a father could
be killed on an avenue famous for international diplomacy.</TE>
<TE>   He also still yearns for the truth.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, declassified documents from the early 1970s showed
that President Richard M. Nixon and former National Security Advisor
Henry Kissinger actively promoted the overthrow of Allende, Chile's
democratically elected president, despite decades of denials. Files
linked to the Letelier assassination remain classified, however, while
Pinochet has avoided prosecution. Pinochet, 86, still lives in Chile, but
he is in declining health and there is little chance that he will ever
face justice.</TE>
<TE>   But for Francisco, the truth is about more than convicting those
responsible for the killing. He believes his family is engaged in a
struggle to reclaim history, as his father had made clear after he was
told that Pinochet had stripped him of his Chilean citizenship. Just 10
days before the assassination, the former ambassador gave an impassioned
speech to 5,000 supporters at Madison Square Garden to commemorate the
third anniversary of the military coup. "I was born a Chilean, I am a
Chilean, and I will die a Chilean," he said. "They, the fascists, were
born traitors, live as traitors, and will be forever remembered as
fascist traitors."</TE>
<TE>   Francisco has spent the last six months completing a vast mural called
"Becoming the Circle," which includes the tumultuous history of Chile
and, with it, that of his own family. The mural, unveiled June 29, is on
the wall of the Pioneer Bakery at 5th and Rose in Venice.</TE>
<TE>   After years of struggling to understand, years in which his father
became a martyred political figure for many in Chile, Francisco says he
is coming to terms with the loss. He says he feels more focused, and more
mortal, than ever before. "I am no longer that 17-year-old child whose
father got killed. I am at the other side of 40 and my youth is behind
me. I still feel young, but I am not a kid anymore. It is sobering. It
gives me a great sense of urgency to say the things I want to say and to
create the things I want to create."</TE>
<TE>   The shrewdest terrorists hide in full view, dressed in the obscurity
of normalcy. Frank Baez had been well-known in his suburban community in
southern Florida, where he ran a landscaping business. He was an
anti-Castro activist who was married with two children.</TE>
<TE>   You can hate Castro with a vengeance, but out in the suburbs you have
to earn money, support your kids, balance a checkbook and call in the
orders to keep your small business functioning. It is simply impossible
to hate Cuba's leader every hour of the day. Nor, as the years pass, is
it possible to be a fugitive 24/7.</TE>
<TE>   That is probably why Baez wasn't watching "America's Most Wanted" on
television one Friday night in 1991. If he had, he would have seen a
series of 1970s-era reenactments: a party at the Letelier house, the head
of the Chilean spy service ordering Letelier's elimination, a fiery
slow-motion pyrotechnic explosion of a car. The segment ended with a
photo of Baez, along with his real name: Virgilio Pablo Paz Romero.</TE>
<TE>   After 15 years in hiding, Paz had begun to relax. He had come to
believe that he might not be responsible for his actions. Frank Baez,
after all, was an innocent man. "Sometimes out of innocence, you think,
'Well, I didn't do it.' And I feel that I didn't do it. I mean, I knew
that I had been part of a conspiracy, but to what extent?"</TE>
<TE>   By failing to see the broadcast, Paz didn't know he needed to flee
once more, as he had in 1978 when Michael Townley was finally extradited
from Chile to offer evidence against his co-conspirators. Townley had
turned on his associates under terms of a plea bargain, after which he
served five years in prison and was placed in an FBI witness protection
program. Three days after the television broadcast, Paz was arrested as
he parked at work.</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors agreed to drop four counts from a 13-year-old
indictment in exchange for Paz's guilty plea to a single felony of
conspiracy to murder a foreign official. In 1998, after serving seven
years of a 12-year prison sentence, he was due for parole. But instead of
being set free, he was handed to the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, which placed him in an immigrant detention center for an
indefinite period.</TE>
<TE>   Paz could only blame himself. His intense Cuban nationalism had kept
him from trying to become a U.S. citizen. Now he was a noncitizen parolee
from a country that would not honor a deportation order from the United
States. His status meant that the government would not release him in
this country. Instead, he remained at the detention center until 2001,
when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that INS detentions for indeterminate
periods were illegal. The ruling also freed Suarez, who also had been
held after being paroled from prison.</TE>
<TE>   Their release from detention in Florida was little more than an
afterthought to Francisco Letelier, who was awaiting the birth of his
second child, a boy. He named the child Salvador, for the late Chilean
president, and thereby wed the names of two of Chile's most famous
anti-Pinochet martyrs.</TE>
<TE>   It's nearly midnight now in Little Havana. As diners leave the
restaurant, the chatter fades, as does Paz's moral tone. It's clear that,
at 50, his feelings about his responsibility for the killing remain
peculiar--if shifting.</TE>
<TE>   After his release from the detention center, Cuban Americans in Miami
feted him like a good soldier returning home. He was more hero than
terrorist. He received many offers of support in his business endeavors,
he says. "They said, 'We loved you and here you are, regardless of what
your name is, and we are here for you in whatever way we can be.' "</TE>
<TE>   Paz does not seem to feel fortunate that he was locked away for just
over 10 years, yet he does seem troubled by at least one thing. Just as
the element of the Sept. 11 attacks that most disturbed Paz was the
killing of "noncombatants," he is bothered by the death of Ronni Moffitt,
the passenger killed with Letelier. "I almost started to cry over that
girl that died," he says. "I have always felt very, very bad, more so
than with Letelier, who was a soldier for his cause--like anybody else
who works for or who tries to work against a government. But that girl,
she was a helpless person who was sitting there by coincidence."</TE>
<TE>   It is beside the point that Letelier fought only with words here in
the U.S., where free speech is cherished. Somehow, to Paz, it is more
acceptable to conspire to murder a Chilean man who opposed a coup leader
who killed thousands than it is to accidentally kill a young American
woman who worked alongside the target. Maybe that is why Paz repeats a
mantra when he talks about the killing: "Orlando Letelier was a soldier
for his cause."</TE>
<TE>   The restaurant has closed. We have moved to the sidewalk and continue
talking under a starry sky. Asked if he ever spoke with Letelier, Paz
says: "Perhaps I should have. Who knows . . . ." His voice trails off. "I
am not happy with what happened. Orlando Letelier was a soldier for his
cause and everything, but it was not our thing. We should never have got
involved in something like that."</TE>
<TE>   He longs to avoid having his life defined by what he now sees as a
stupid action from his youth. "But it is too late. It is 25 years later."
He looks down and then begins to rub his eyes. They are watery. Perhaps
it is fatigue from his night shifts as an alarm company dispatcher.</TE>
<TE>   Later, in a follow-up phone conversation, Paz explains, "I wasted 23
years of my life. I don't want to go back and rehash and relive something
that I have already paid for. It is a little bit tiring to think about
these things. It isn't that I am ashamed, but at my age now, looking
back, I would like to kick my ass about my involvement in this."</TE>
<TE>   If only Paz could take these shreds of remorse a little further, he
might tell the Letelier family: "We are sorry for killing a family man, a
human being. We were wrong to murder." Pinochet's spy chief, Manuel
Contreras, was convicted in Chile of ordering the killing. The Leteliers
believe the order ultimately must have come from Pinochet himself. If
only Paz would tell them--Orlando Letelier would be fixed in history.</TE>
<TE>   september is a difficult month for Chilean exiles. It is littered with
grim anniversaries: the military coup that spurred their flight and the
elimination of opponents of the Chilean regime abroad. For the Leteliers
and the Moffitts, it is a time when they try to build something. On the
anniversary of the bombing, members of both families gather each year in
Washington, D.C., to offer an annual human rights award commemorating
their lost loved ones.</TE>
<TE>   Last September, 10 days before the 25th anniversary of the
assassination, Francisco turned on the television and saw the World Trade
Center buildings crumble. "Sept. 11 was huge for me. It was so enormous,
so staggering. I was thinking, 'There are people who know about rubble
and digging people out, and people who know about going on with their
lives after these sorts of things--what you do with the pain after a
year, after two years, after a decade, after two decades."</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, Francisco joined his family for the anniversary in
Washington. Walking by a small memorial to his father and Ronni Moffitt
at Sheridan Circle, he began to see Ronni's death in a new light. "It was
the first time I really saw Ronni as this echo of victims of terrorism on
American soil." He also has realized that closure, the widely touted
grail of the traumatized, is an empty one. Some traumas are simply too
shocking to ever come to grips with. "I very clearly felt that some
things never get resolved."</TE>
<TE>   As for those who conduct such attacks, Francisco says, "I feel in many
ways that they are kind of victims of a world in which young men come of
age and get their heads full of crap." His sympathy, however, only goes
so far.</TE>
<TE>   "I can only say to Paz, 'If you had the means, you would have done the
same thing,' " he says. "You would have flown a plane into Havana and
killed all the 'damn commies' at once--if you had thought of it.</TE>
<TE>   "What you saw was the logical outcome of the same kind of insanity. It
grows and grows, and it becomes Sept. 11. Bin Laden took Islam and
twisted it into a weird, murderous agenda that has nothing to do with
Islam. You just did it in the name of freedom and democracy and twisted
it around until it became a mockery."</TE>
<TE>   Francisco senses that the killers and the families of their victims
are inextricably linked by the moment of terror, one that the assassins
created, and one that only the Leteliers and the Moffitts can move
beyond. "I don't think I am the agent of his [Paz's] healing. I can give
him benediction, but I don't think it will heal him. Yes, he harmed me,
my family and all the people who loved Orlando, but he also harmed
himself. Paz is very right on when he says, 'This isn't what I am about.'
This isn't what any of us are here for."</TE>
<TE>   Today, even Paz appears to be about other things. He has served his
legal debt to a society that he finally seems to have a stake in. He
lives and works under his own name. As the father of two children--his
son is about the same age that Francisco was at the time of the
assassination--Paz now understands what his disappearance would mean to
them, and what theirs would mean to him.</TE>
<TE>   His link to his own children seems to prevent him from understanding
how radicalized young men could steal away sons, daughters, husbands,
wives, lovers, mothers and fathers in places like New York and
Washington, D.C. He is no longer the disconnected adolescent looking for
acceptance in a brotherhood of extremism. He has something to lose.
Perhaps there is one less terrorist in the world.</TE>

<LD>"I dreamed about rhubarb and white peach cobbler last night,"
Natasha MacAller says while glancing nervously at her watch for the tenth
time in the last two minutes.</LD>
<LD>   We are standing in the middle of the intersection of 2nd Street and
Arizona Avenue at the Wednesday Santa Monica farmers market. Waiting,
waiting, waiting. Most of the vendors have been here since 7 or 8,
stylishly mounding tables with purple-tinted Scots kale, spiky Greek
oregano, bundles of round, golf-ball-size roasting carrots and, of
course, luscious fruit: blackberries the size of stuffed olives, peaches
with names only a grandmother would recognize, and apricots so fragrant
you can smell them over the heat waves rising off the asphalt.</LD>
<LD>   MacAller often dreams about desserts. Last night, she tells me, at 2
in the morning she had this vision of rhubarb. Now she can't stop
thinking about it.</LD>
<TE>   But unlike most people obsessed with food, MacAller doesn't dream of
eating it--she dreams of preparing it for others. She is the pastry chef
for Santa Monica's Union restaurant. The young chef, who stands not much
more than 5-foot-4 in clogs, doesn't so much walk as glide--hips and toes
out, heels in--like the ballerina she once was. She has already made a
mental checklist of what she wants to buy this morning. But she has to
wait for the blow of an air-horn, precisely at 9, to begin shopping. Even
so, once the market opens, she is easily distracted by tempting
delicacies missed the first time through, from the first-of-the-season
lapin cherries, with their yellow blush, being sold by a farmer in a
curling straw hat from Pritchett Farms in Visalia, to the deep-red
Chandler strawberries covering the tables of Harry's Berries from Oxnard.
"He's really expensive," MacAller whispers before sampling berries so
soft that the juice runs down her chin as she takes a small bite.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, God," MacAller says, grabbing my arm. "I have to have some of
these." MacAller isn't alone in her pursuit of the best and the brightest
berries. The market is filled with chefs looking for organic apricots for
compotes and black raspberries for complex Merlot sauces. But while the
primary purpose of these weekly, or even twice-weekly, market jaunts is
ostensibly to find rare gooseberries and downy white peaches, there's
something else going on here. The downtown Santa Monica farmers market is
to these mostly young and up-and-coming culinary stars what Manolos are
to shoe lovers. It's the place where young pastry hotshots mingle, talk
shop and even do a deal or two ("I'll work your charity dinner if you'll
work mine"). They hug, kiss each cheek--there and there-- and ask about
each other's restaurants the way film stars might make small talk about
an upcoming project. "I heard you're doing that dinner with Raphael."
"I'd love to work with him but I can't. I already committed to an event
with Peel that week."</TE>
<TE>   In a city where celebrity status is often times conferred on
hairstylists and fitness trainers, pastry chefs are suddenly hot--very
hot. Look at the bottom of your menu: If the pastry chef isn't named,
it's hardly worth ordering the mascarpone cheesecake or Meyer lemon tart,
no matter how good it looks. We don't just want a souffle--we want the
Valrhona chocolate souffle with a delicate scoop of prune-Armagnac ice
cream, whipped up by Shelly Register of Aubergine in Newport Beach. If
you really feel like finishing off that dry-aged New York steak with
baked Alaska, then it simply must be Annie Clemmons' baked Alaska at
Balboa in West Hollywood, with little peaks of singed meringue, rising up
like Brad Pitt's spiked hair, prettily pouting in a pool of
blackberry-Cabernet-lavender sauce. Why would you settle for anything
less?</TE>
<TE>   Just as wine aficionados easily order a Joe Heitz Cabernet or maybe a
Gary Eberle Zinfandel instead of just "a glass of red wine," these days
true gourmets want signature desserts. Dishes, like the Swedish Princess
cake at Gustaf Anders in Orange County, that are every bit as impressive,
if not more so, than the appetizers and entrees.</TE>
<TE>   If anyone doubted it before, the coronation in May of Spago pastry
chef Sherry Yard as a James Beard Foundation Award winner--the Oscars for
chefs--made it clear to foodies everywhere that dessert chefs in L.A.
have been elevated to culinary royalty. (Appropriately enough, Yard, the
unofficial queen bee of L.A. pastry chefs along with Campanile's Nancy
Silverton and Kimberly Boyce, received her award while wearing a tiara
above her blond bangs and hoisting a glass of champagne.) This is, to
coin a phrase, The Age of Patisserie.</TE>
<TE>   But why the sudden limelight on the creators of sweet plates? after
all, our love affair with chocolate dishes is as ancient as the Mayan
civilization that first discovered the cocoa tree around 600 AD. Our
homage to decadent cakes goes back at least as far as the 7th century
French bishop of Amiens, Honore, who had a sugary gateau, ringed with
caramel-coated cream puffs and filled with gooey creme patissiere, named
after him, and is also the patron saint of pastry chefs (cradling an
armful of baguettes, the French mystic is often portrayed in artists'
renditions holding a baker's shovel).</TE>
<TE>   "Dessert is such a celebratory event," says Annie Clemmons of Balboa
restaurant, tucked inside the Grafton on Sunset hotel in West Hollywood.
"It's like a present you give the table, and every pastry chef in Los
Angeles wants their present to be so damn good that you leave no question
in their mind who made it."</TE>
<TE>   Like MacAller, Clemmons did not start out as a pastry chef--or chef of
any sort, for that matter. While doing graduate work in French and
political studies in Washington, D.C., Clemmons had plans on pursuing a
career as a foreign diplomat. "I was studying for my master's degree when
I suddenly realized that the best part of my day was coming home and
cooking." Much to her parents' chagrin, she enrolled in a culinary school
in Boston, eventually moving to Los Angeles to take a job at Campanile,
where she worked with Kimberly Boyce in the pastry kitchen. It was there
that she learned to combine the discipline and structure she'd developed
studying foreign policy with the whimsical creativity lacking from the
rest of her life, a key part of most pastry chefs' fascination with the
job.</TE>
<TE>   "I get a giggle coming up with ideas," she says, swinging her feet,
cloaked in red-and-white striped Raggedy Ann stockings. She's taking a
break from perfecting several grape sorbets--Muscatel and Concord--that
she'll freeze in plastic beach toys used to hold sand and purchased that
morning from Toys 'R' Us. "When I send something special to a table, I
love to peek out from the kitchen and watch the reaction," she says.
"It's like being Santa Claus." The flip side to Balboa's fanciful baked
Alaska, for instance, is her cupcake picnic dish--three mini-cupcakes in
ice cream-like flavors such as orange-vanilla--accompanied by ants made
from chocolate-covered coffee beans. Diners love it.</TE>
<TE>   There's something very childlike--and comforting--about such desserts,
says Kimberly Boyce, pastry chef at Campanile. Boyce started out studying
anthropology at UC San Diego before first hiring on at Spago to work
under Sherry Yard. She thinks something like her strawberry-rhubarb
custard tart with rhubarb ice cream is "very elegant and has intricate,
layered flavors." She admits that a menu favorite for many at the La Brea
Avenue restaurant is the "Childhood Favorites" plate: homemade Oreo
cookies with a shot of chocolate pudding (made with Valrhona chocolate,
of course) accompanying a small hot fudge sundae. "It's comfort food done
on a really, really high level," she says.</TE>
<TE>   English-born T'ai Chopping of Melisse in Santa Monica found
inspiration for her vanilla crepes with candied kumquat ice cream from a
childhood breakfast served by her British mum. High-end comfort
food--desserts that remind us of our childhood but are made with more
flair and better ingredients--seems to be everyone's favorite these days.
JiRaffe's pastry chef, Artemio Sanchez, can't help but break into a smile
while describing his banana cream pie, caramelized and served with
caramel sauce, while next door at Union, MacAller is hard at work
perfecting what she calls a "sophisticated" Scooter-Pie. She's also
working on her own version of a Hostess cupcake. "These are desserts that
bring back warm memories," she says, "except people have never had them
like this before." Order one of MacAller's brownies, 1718579744Berger
chocolate propping up a mound of black raspberry ice cream covered in hot
fudge and toasted almonds. "Not exactly your mom's recipe," she says. "We
dress it up not only in the way it looks but the way it tastes.
Everything is more intense."</TE>
<TE>   Shelly Register  was pursuing a career in medicine when a friend
convinced her to try her hand in the kitchen instead. You would think she
might be restrained working within the confines of Tim Goodell's
French-inspired Aubergine restaurant in Newport Beach, with its
five-course prix fixe menu featuring delicacies such as Maine scallops on
"raw and cooked" asparagus with truffle vinaigrette. But she manages to
explore her inner child anyway. "Like the other day I had a craving for
pancakes so I created a Napoleon short stack, silver-dollar size, that
was my version of bananas Foster. Today I'm obsessed with tapioca. I
found this lime-green tapioca in a Vietnamese market and I'm just dying
to use it in a sorbet course."</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to pastry chefs, cravings often seem to be the mother of
invention. Working with a formal French menu at L'Orangerie has not
stopped Donna Claxton from exploring her obsession with spices. Yes, the
restaurant's signature dessert remains the chocolate souffle, and the
crepe suzette, profiteroles and creme brulee probably won't depart the
menu any time soon. Yet Claxton also blends such startling combinations
as a strawberry tart served with balsamic ice cream, and--in
summer--fresh berries mixed with hibiscus jelly and hot pepper and topped
with yogurt sorbet.</TE>
<TE>   "There really are no limits to what we can do," says the 26-year-old
chef, who took cooking classes while in high school in Canada. Then, as I
stand up to leave, she adds with a girlish smile, "It's an exciting time,
I think, for pastry chefs, and it's only going to get better. They are
becoming restaurant stars, don't you think?"</TE>

<HD>My Dinner With Fidel</HD>
<DH>CUBA DIARIES: An American Housewife in Havana, By Isadora
Tattlin, Shannon Ravenel / Algonquin Books: 308 pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN LOUISE BARDACH</AU>
<BD>Ann Louise Bardach is the author of the forthcoming
"Cuba Confidential: Love and Vengeance in Miami and Havana" and the
editor of "Cuba: A Traveler's Literary Companion."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before arriving in Cuba in the early 1990s, Isadora Tattlin asked a
friend to explain in detail what the problem was with that
beleaguered country. The friend, a former resident of Havana, summed
up its troubles with one sentence: "Fidel is an old man who can't
admit that he made a mistake."</LD>
<LD>   Tattlin, the pseudonymous author of "Cuba Diaries: An American
Housewife in Havana," is taken aback by her friend's breezy
bluntness. "But surely it can't be as simple as all that," she
argues. Three and a half years later, however, at the end of her
family's stay, she concludes that her friend may have been right.
That the raging force behind the four-decade Cuban-U.S. cold war is a
prideful, aging comandante who is incapable of backing down.</LD>
<LD>   Tattlin's diary of her extended stay in Cuba offers a sharp and
sassy evocation of daily life in that complicated and troubled
Caribbean country. Written as a series of impressionistic vignettes,
it is a viable alternative to the half-dozen trips to Cuba that seem
necessary in order to penetrate the smoke, mirrors, rumors and
conspiracies at play on this self-important island.</LD>
<TE>   Tattlin's book is balanced between carefully observed reportage
and chisme, or gossip. Also referred to as Radio Bemba (loosely,
Radio Big Mouth) or la bola en la calle (the word on the street),
chisme in Cuba is a complex and valued medium. It is the central
organ of news dissemination and one that is often more reliable than
what one reads or hears on the government-controlled news. Most of
the book's chisme comes from Tattlin's household staff of seven, a
luxury, she admits with some embarrassment, that comes with the perks
of her husband's job, her "own small legacy" and the cheap cost of
labor in Cuba. As a bonus, there are some exquisite cameos of Fidel
Castro, his brother Raul and other movers and shakers in the Cuban
firmament.</TE>
<TE>   Tattlin soon learns the requisite Cuban slang, such as the word
gusanero, a portmanteau of gusano (worm, and the traditional epithet
for those who have emigrated) and companero ("comrade"), which
combined mean "a Cuban who makes foreign currency and returns a
portion of it to the Cuban government in exchange" for holding onto
his citizenship and unrestricted travel. Some of the more interesting
exchanges come from Lety, who teaches the Tattlin children gymnastics
and who offers a lively treatise on race and "dating," the euphemism
for freelance prostitution.</TE>
<TE>   Lety's digression on the nuances of race in Cuba is particularly
edifying. " 'There are two basic kinds of Negroes in Cuba,' Lety
tells me. 'Negros de pasas are black or brown people with kinky hair.
Negros de pelo are black people or brown people with straight or wavy
hair. To be un negro de pelo in Cuba is to get the best of both
worlds.... It's as good as having a visa to Canada or Western Europe,
guaranteed. And being una negra with blue eyes,' Lety shakes her
fingers again like they have been scalded, 'when the girl turns
fourteen, people say, 'El norteno [a foreigner] is coming, guapita
[pretty one], pack your bags!' "</TE>
<TE>   Tattlin's stay in Cuba coincided with the nadir of the Special
Period, a euphemism for the bleak years that followed the demise of
its Soviet patron in the early '90s. Habaneros often tell her how
things were "not so bad" in the 1970s and '80s before life became
primarily the grim pursuit of three meals a day. The underlying
assumption throughout "Cuba Diaries" is that most Cubans, natural
entrepreneurs bristling under the constraints of a suffocating
bureaucracy, are hungry for an exit. This remains the case for a
segment of the population, but many more are simply hungry for more
and better food, more stuff and more freedom. Indeed, Tattlin's
scolding of improvised life in Cuba might strike some readers as
Martha Stewart hits the Malecon.</TE>
<TE>   "Call me Isadora," begins "Cuba Diaries" with a wink to Herman
Melville, and readers will immediately want to know who Isadora
Tattlin is and why she has penned this work under a nom de plume.
Their quest to discover her identity will likely end unfulfilled as
Tattlin conceals herself and her family superbly, fudging on the
dates of her stay and the details of key personalities in the book.
To further thwart the curious, she has limited herself to radio
appearances, such as National Public Radio, to promote her book. She
describes herself only as the mother of two and the "wife of a
European business executive," who needs anonymity to protect the
Cuban staff who worked for them and other Cuban friends. She reminds
the reader that criticism that could be construed as anti-government
is often sharply dealt with in Cuba, which is altogether true.
Nevertheless, far harsher accounts have been penned about Castro's
Cuba. Hence, it would be fair to say--having met "Tattlin" and her
family in Havana a few years ago--that the protection of her family,
in particular her husband's career, was an equally vital
consideration.</TE>
<TE>   Among the best scenes in Tattlin's book is a lunch at her home for
Manuel Pineiro, the aristocrat turned revolutionary known as
"Barbaroja" (for his carrot-red beard). The hard-drinking Pineiro, a
Politburo luminary, was the former chief of intelligence who ran
Cuba's guerrilla operations in Latin America throughout the 1970s and
'80s. "Pineiro remains the favorite of the international set in
Havana because if you have to have an old revolutionary over, Pineiro
is the most schmooze-worthy," observes the tart Tattlin. "He listens
well of course--he has spent his life listening .... The true
fascination of Pineiro, of course, lies in the contemplation of the
size and scope of the secrets contained in one unkempt head. He knows
how [revolutionary icon] Camilo Cienfuegos died, he knows how on
purpose it was that Che was not resupplied in the Bolivian jungle."
Hence, when Pineiro crashes to his death while driving under the
influence in 1998, Tattlin, who clearly took a dim view of the wily
spook, is decidedly unsentimental.</TE>
<TE>   And Pineiro was hardly the biggest score at Tattlin's dinner
table. Among the many members of the nomenklatura--the Cuban ruling
class--to honor her home was the country's most famous brother act,
Fidel and Raul Castro. One of the ironies of Cuba's socialist
powers-that-be is their curiosity for the rich and powerful, and
clearly the Tattlins proved irresistible. Tattlin has a wicked eye
for the odd detail, such as the fact that Raul Castro, who is about
half a foot shorter than his brother, wears hefty lifts on his shoes
and how Raul's entourage seemed more solicitous toward Raul than
Fidel's entourage was toward Fidel.</TE>
<TE>   On the day of the Fidel dinner, Tattlin receives a flurry of phone
calls from Castro's personal security chief. The secretary of her
husband, Nick, also fields calls, including one informing her that
the beverage of choice for El Jefe is Chivas Regal Scotch. Tattlin
quickly learns that no item is too small or quotidian for the
attention of Castro's security detail. A team of men arrive at
noontime. "The head of security," she writes, "asks me to list the
names of the help. He asks me to give him and his men a tour of the
house. He asks me what bathroom the president will use. I say we have
only one downstairs bathroom. He tells me the president will use that
bathroom and that all other guests should use the guest bathroom
upstairs. He asks me what kind of toilet paper the president will
use.... He asks me if it is Cuban toilet paper. I say it is. He asks
me if we don't have any better quality toilet paper. I say we don't.
The head of security asks me to take a roll, put it in a plastic bag,
tape the bag shut, and leave it beside the toilet for the president."</TE>
<TE>   Tattlin is quizzed on how the meal will be served and by whom,
including "what side of the table the president will be served from."
She is then instructed "to seat the president with his back facing
the wall." Two hours later, more security people arrive to case the
house along with "the food taster" who will "spend the rest of the
afternoon in the kitchen with Lorena [the cook]. The checkers start
combing the house delicately, looking under every piece of furniture
with flashlights, tapping the furniture in some places. They get
ladders and peek into chandeliers and rub the insides of lampshades
with the flats of their hands. They pick up cushions and squeeze
every part of them between their hands. They take out the telephone
in the despacho [the office] and install a red one. They install a
green one in the garden in the bushes near the entrance."</TE>
<TE>   And so it goes until the Castro entourage arrives by caravan.
Castro, it turns out, is a man of courtly manners and is as avid a
listener as he is a talker, with a sponge-like attention to detail.
But when he speaks, there is no telling what arcane
digression--Angola, Eritrea--he may indulge in for any length of
time. At the Tattlin dinner party, the maximum leader rescues himself
with a sense of humor. "Amazing how time flies when you're doing all
the talking," he quips at midnight as he prepares to leave.</TE>
<TE>   Not everything in "Cuba Diaries" is new or compelling. The
sections on Santeria, the widely practiced Afro-Cuban syncretic
religion, may be helpful to the novice Cuba-phile but seems more
dutiful than inspired. Tattlin's book is a bit scattershot, sort of
like a traveler's photo album. There are some penetrating portraits,
some candid and hilarious shots, while some are a bit out of focus.
But altogether, these stories, snippets and recollections meld into
an alternative travel book, offering the reader a sagacious reading
of Cuban life.</TE>
<TE>   Where Tattlin excels is in the plethora of telling, incisive
details of the surreal daily life on the largest island in the
Caribbean and her keen understanding of power and powerlessness in
Cuba. At one Havana dinner party, the non-Cuban guests agree that
"what is driving Cuban policy" are the vanities of its politicians.
"They cannot have their pride offended," she writes, deftly summing
up one of the most most intractable stumbling blocks of the
decades-long showdown. "That is the most important thing."</TE>

<HD>The Mysteries of Latin</HD>
<DH>LATIN: Or the Empire of a Sign, By Francoise Waquet,
Translated from the French by John Howe, Verso: 400 pp., $30</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLEY CHAMBERLAIN</AU>
<BD>Lesley Chamberlain is the author of "The Secret Artist:
A Close Reading of Sigmund Freud."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not so long ago, Latin was part of everyday life. It was the
incomprehensible but attractive language of the Western church and
its music, the language of memorials and tombstones, and of doctors'
notes. It was the language of instructions to (human)
printers--"stet," for example--and of advertising. We ate Hovis bread
(hominis vis, "the strength of man") and cleaned the bathtub with Vim
(vis, "strength"). Latin was part of things, mostly not understood
but entailing respect for history and arcane scholarship.</LD>
<LD>   To a modern sociological eye however, the dominance of Latin looks
like so much humbug. Few moderns ever mastered it, even in the
Christian Church, doctors used it to hide information from patients,
or, as in Moliere's comedies, cover their own incompetence. Slimy
savants used Latin to have sly fun talking about sex without being
caught or losing dignity. Freud notoriously talked about seeing
"matrem nudam."</LD>
<TE>   The Paris-based scholar Francoise Waquet warms to the idea that
Latin was one way or another mostly a conservative social conspiracy.
For too long, it entailed a privileged background. It wasn't taught
to lower class children, however gifted. Meanwhile, in a tradition of
gross hypocrisy, Latin scholars were expected to do badly. It was de
rigueur to fail. Western society only required of its ruling classes
that they come into contact with Latin. The question I asked myself
while reading this detailed, and wide-ranging, but not quite engaging
study, was two-fold: What has been gained by "unmasking" Latin, and
has anything superior replaced it?</TE>
<TE>   Latin was a sign of universality when people believed the West was
the universe. But it was also convenient that educated men from
different countries had a common language. For several centuries
international diplomacy was conducted in Latin (conferences in Latin
were still proposed in the early 20th century). The universality of
Latin suggested potential unity and peace. The Jesuit diplomatist
Joseph de Maistre called the surviving language of the Romans "the
European sign." Until the 1950s, across the world projects for an
easier universal language like Esperanto were still based upon its
lexicography and simplified grammar. English has stepped into the
breach, but surely not with the same neutral and exalted status.</TE>
<TE>   The supremacy of English seems more like the result of a marketing
drive. The grouse against Latin in modern education was the
combination of its difficulty and increasing irrelevance. When, as a
small boy, Churchill famously queried the second case in the
declension "mensa mensa mensam," he was told its use was vocative.
His reply, "But I rarely need to address a table, sir," earned him a
sharp rebuke, whereas today it's what the teachers also think.</TE>
<TE>   Doubts had already arisen in the 18th century as to whether this
tongue that no one had ever heard was worth pursuing. But as I was
told in school, Latin was there to train the mind and expand the
vocabulary and provide a foundation for the love of literature, and
while education had no finer purpose than these things, Latin wasn't
a bad vehicle. At least we could understand grammar, and inflected
grammar at that.</TE>
<TE>   Waquet identifies three defining moments between the 16th and the
20th centuries: the assured age of Latin's monopoly, the 19th century
age of grandeur and the post-1968 age. In the age of grandeur Latin
was treated like royalty and religion, its exclusivity relentlessly
cultivated in a already society defensive of its class privileges.
Had Waquet not been French she might have cited the tragedy of Thomas
Hardy's "Jude the Obscure," whose hero is kept by his lowly origins
from studying at Oxford, though he had taught himself Latin and loved
its very sound coming from beyond high, forbidding college walls.</TE>
<TE>   Instead Waquet tells us that the French Revolution left Latin in a
strengthened position. It gave the consolation of tradition. Few
minded that they did not understand it. Initiating the contemporary
age Oxford and Cambridge dropped their Latin entrance requirement in
the mid-1970s. It rapidly declined to a minority option at school.</TE>
<TE>   Barely 150,000 students across the United States now study it, and
the figures aren't much better for Europe. In France, Latin became an
option in secondary education in 1968, with a decree from the
conservative minister of education, Edgar Faure. The end of Latin and
the 1968 student revolutions were surely part of a wave of
liberalization happening out of anyone's individual control.</TE>
<TE>   Waquet's book is part of the ongoing demystification and
democratization process.The English public school with its top-heavy
Classics curriculum is anathema. Latin always attracted chancers and
fakers. "Upper-class" speech was peppered with intimidating and
obfuscatory Latin phrases. Some of what she says is true, and still
true.</TE>
<TE>   But what Waquet misses for me is a sense of the tragedy that
befell classical education in the few decades when it became open to
allcomers on merit. This great wave of desire to learn rose up and
carried with it many talented, diligent "ordinary" people whose lives
were transformed by love of scholarship. Waquet records a 1969
statistic for a Welsh town--by coincidence my hometown for a year
when I was still at school--stating that Latin teachers in schools
were now almost all from lower-middle class backgrounds. What she
doesn't record is how the wave of enablement all too soon overturned
when it smashed against a newer impulse toward social leveling. Latin
went within a couple of decades from being a tool of enablement to a
means of cultural undoing.</TE>
<TE>   Was it somehow repressive? Latin was mysterious, but so is science
to most of us. We take it on trust that it's relevant. That the Latin
mass generated fear and mystery in an ignorant congregation doesn't
for me make the case against Latin. Modern advertising and party
political discourse are more manipulative discourses. Moreover,
neither of them have the advantage of beauty and poetry, which
provided a mass aesthetic education when the majority were
churchgoers.</TE>
<TE>   After World War II the Italian writer and Auschwitz survivor Primo
Levi was walking back to Italy from Poland.Tired and starving, he met
a priest, who spoke neither French, or German, or Italian. Ubi est
mensa pauperorum? Levi asked. Where is the table for paupers? The
West had almost destroyed itself, but in a few words the cultural
hope it had nourished for centuries was reborn.</TE>

<HD>What He Saw at the Revolution</HD>
<DH>VIDA CLANDESTINA: My Life in the Cuban Revolution, By
Enrique Oltuski, Translated by Thomas and Carol Christensen, John
Wiley &amp; Sons: 336 pp., $24.95, (forthcoming in September)</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC COOPER</AU>
<BD>Marc Cooper is the author of "Pinochet and Me: A
Chilean Anti-Memoir."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How could Enrique Oltuski's well-written memoir of his double life
during the Cuban Revolution not be compelling? The son of
Polish-Jewish immigrants, his relatives consumed in the Holocaust,
the young Oltuski chafes at his comfortable middle-class life in
Havana and, still a teenager, burning with nationalist fever, finds
himself drawn into the revolutionary conspiracies against the
dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista. From the outset, he's living on
parallel planes. During a stint at the University of Miami, his
public persona has him dating the exotic daughters of the Latin
American oligarchy while in his "underground" life he's trying to buy
arms for the revolution back home.</LD>
<LD>   After college he takes a high-ranking day job with Shell Oil Co.
but devotes his real passions to organizing the guerrilla movement in
Havana and to collaborating closely with Che Guevara and, of course,
Fidel Castro. Right up until the day of the revolution's triumph,
neither the police authorities nor even Oltuski's parents know of his
secret role as "Sierra"--a key organizer of the rebellion.</LD>
<TE>   This memoir's greatest strength is in leading the reader deep
behind the scenes into the rivalries and alliances that arose between
Castro's Rebel Army fighting in the mountains and the often chaotic
network of insurgents in the less glamorized urban underground. The
factional divisions that would soon after the revolution erupt in
blood and betrayal and leave Castro standing alone and unchallenged
are all sketched here in their embryonic state. But in those heady
days of the late '50s, the cream of Cuban youth was united against a
Batista regime that they viewed as a clumsy and repressive extension
of the foreign (namely, American) domination of their island nation.</TE>
<TE>   Oltuski's crisp recounting of the dreams and ideals that drove the
Fidelista revolt abruptly ends with his being seated as a cabinet
minister at age 28 in the first revolutionary government. "I swung
around in the giant chair to look out the large window," he writes of
his first day in office. "Life went on, and I thought, 'What the hell
do I do now?' "</TE>
<TE>   Least satisfying about this book is that it covers only the period
of the revolutionary war. Oltuski went from his position as minister
of communications to working five years at the side of Guevara. And
he's spent the last 31 years as deputy minister of fisheries, where
he continues at age 72. This begs a second volume of memoirs, one
that details how those early passions wound up ossifying into the
sort of regime under which he holds the same high post for three
decades and the jefe maximo is shooting for a neat half-century alone
in power. What stories Oltuski could tell us about compromise,
disillusionment and realpolitik!</TE>
<TE>   Today's Cuba, of course, doesn't permit that sort of writing,
especially from within its own borders and certainly not from one of
its government ministers. In the most inauthentic passage of the
book, Oltuski writes: "People also always ask me what will happen to
the Cuban government and society when Fidel dies. The answer is
nothing. Nothing will happen...." Fat chance.</TE>

<HD>The Danger of Evil</HD>
<DH>UNDER RADAR, A Novel, By Michael Tolkin, Atlantic Monthly:
212 pp., $23</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL HARRIS</AU>
<BD>Michael Harris is a regular contributor to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What's Michael Tolkin up to? We begin his latest novel, "Under
Radar," expecting another black comedy like his best-known work, "The
Player"--a cynical exploration of guilt or its absence among the rich
and powerful. "Under Radar" conforms to this pattern at first, then
turns into something quite different: a fable of spiritual
redemption.</LD>
<LD>   If we'd been paying attention, though, we might have spotted a
hint of this sort of thing in Robert Altman's movie version of "The
Player," for which Tolkin wrote the screenplay. The antihero,
Hollywood studio executive Griffin Mill, kills a writer and seduces
the girlfriend. He not only gets away with it but (subject to a
little blackmail) lives happily ever after. He escapes into the
anti-reality, the Hollywood ending, that almost always trumps real
life on the screen.</LD>
<LD>   In "Under Radar," Tolkin takes this notion several steps further.
Tom Levy, a lawyer who enriched himself in a fake-accident scam to
defraud insurance companies, kills a man while on vacation with his
wife and daughters in Jamaica. He is arrested and sentenced to life
in prison. Behind bars, he hears, from a convict about to be hanged,
a story so powerful that it turns his hair white and shocks him into
a walking coma that lasts seven years. When he awakens, he's
transformed--an honest man.</LD>
<TE>   This is magic, of course, not psychology. And it's at the heart of
the novel--not just a final note of irony, followed by the credits.
So it comes as a jolt, and Tolkin isn't comfortable enough yet in the
territory of affirmation to bring it off smoothly. He's still at his
best as a cold, sardonic observer of hypocrisy and sleaze.</TE>
<TE>   In the beginning, Levy, who has banked the proceeds of the scam
and leads an outwardly normal life, tells himself that his secret
adds piquancy to existence: "[T]he knowledge of an unpunished crime
grinds a lens through which the world looks small and more easily
managed."</TE>
<TE>   Other people look small, too. Levy suspects that many have similar
secrets, and that those who don't are dull and unadventurous. He
feels stifled at family-friendly resorts and distant from his wife;
he has imaginary affairs with women he meets, each a "dense unwritten
novel of travel, secret meetings, murder, punishment, and passionate
enlightenment." Such a novel, in fact, is what Tolkin writes for him.
In Jamaica, he lusts after a woman, Debra Seckler, whose husband
encourages Levy's 4-year-old daughter, Alma, to dance lewdly at a
reggae party. Levy's awareness of his own corruption leads him to
overreact: He fears that Alma has been emotionally damaged for life.
Levy's dark side, hitherto "under radar," far from being confined to
a single illegal act years ago, moves him to violence: He pushes
Seckler's husband off a cliff.</TE>
<TE>   This is all persuasive, though the action has an odd, accelerated
quality to it, as if we were reading a film treatment rather than a
novel. Tolkin's dialogue is OK in brief exchanges but stilted when
characters speak at length. His descriptions, given the exotic
settings, are sparse--a sign of Levy's obsessive, peephole-like
vision, perhaps, but the awkward prose doesn't help.</TE>
<TE>   Once Levy is imprisoned, however, his wife divorces him and his
children are told he's dead, and "Under Radar" abandons any pretense
at realism. We enter a world of prophecies and witches and wild
coincidences, in which Levy is led to conclude: "I never understood
the danger of evil until now."</TE>
<TE>   The hanged man's story, which Levy can't remember hearing but
which pours from him under prompting by his fellow prisoners, is a
fable within a fable, about a missionary to Jamaica whose efforts are
subverted by an American woman who tempts his congregation with pagan
orgies. It's a subtle and interesting story, but we're left unsure
why it affected Levy so powerfully, or why, for the convicts, it's
the key to their liberation.</TE>
<TE>   Once free, the physically altered Levy hopes to reenter his
family's life without revealing his identity or causing more pain. To
accomplish this worthy goal--another irony--Levy has to call on his
old skills as a scam artist. It's the real world's revenge on the
Hollywood ending.</TE>

Translated from the French of Jusef Vrioni by David Bellos, Arcade:

<AU>JONATHAN LEVI</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>What is Albania? During the mid-1980s, our image was of a country
hunkered down behind the inscrutable wall of its Communist tyrant
Enver Hoxha. Albania was the Tibet of Europe, swathed in fabrics of
language and culture unidentifiable to the uninitiated. The war in
Kosovo changed all that. CNN taught us that Albania was part of the
Balkans, that its people were part of a larger European Muslim
population (who knew there were Muslims in Europe?). But what did we
learn of Albanian culture, of Albanian writing? Did, in fact,
Albanians write?</LD>
<TE>   "As he was crossing the intersection, Mark Gurabardhi noticed a
crowd of people, which was growing by the minute, gathering on the
right-hand side of the street. Most likely he would have walked past
without a second glance if he hadn't heard someone say the word
snake!--spoken not in fright but in astonishment." Where does a
sentence like this one from the opening of Albanian novelist Ismail
Kadare's marvelous new novel "Spring Flowers, Spring Frost" come
from? Fans of the fantastical, veterans of Borges and Kafka, may
recognize the familiar combination of the mundane and the
extraordinary. The incidental traffic-related details combine with
verminous surprise to provide a diagram for do-it-yourself Central
European writers; remember that hit from Prague: "One morning, as he
woke from troubling dreams, Gregor Samsa found himself transformed
into a monstrous dung-beetle"?</TE>
<TE>   And yet, along with the familiar Western name Mark comes the
subcontinental Gurabardhi. His friends are named Zef and Cuf. Mark
himself is a painter with a mysterious young girlfriend as a model,
much like the dozens of disaffected artists that wandered through
southern European literature in the 1950s, most prominently in
Alberto Moravia's "Boredom." Mark is, in fact, wandering from the
destiny of the men in his family--a long line of police officers--but
he is also a dreamer (albeit as troubled a dreamer as Gregor). His
dreams not only reach back into an Albanian mythology of snakes who
marry young girls but also to the more famous stories of Albania's
neighbor to the south, Greece.</TE>
<TE>   His dreams take on color and complexity when the provincial town
in which he works is shaken by a crime wave. First, a bank is robbed.
Next, Mark's boss, the head of the cultural center, is murdered.
Though the first crime seems to be a result of the modernization of
Albania that followed the death of Hoxha, the second is the product
of a revival of the Kanun, an ancient code of laws that had been
suppressed by the Communists. Central to the Kanun is the Book of the
Blood, " ... a list of all blood feuds since the beginning ... who
redeemed the blood, and who still has to do some redeeming ... it
even lays down cases where there is just a half-blood still to pay
off."</TE>
<TE>   In Mark's dreams these crimes mix with his vague memories of other
original mythological sins. He dreams of the Greek gods reacting to
Tantalus' betrayal of the secret of immortality as if Olympus were a
suburb of Tirana. "Lights go on in the gods' villas and offices.
Chariots dash through the night. Various classes of investigators are
roused: special intelligence officers, then the spies who investigate
special intelligence officers, then those who keep an eye on the
spies. And in all the hustle and bustle the whole of the ministry's
staff awakens--professional delators, epileptic whistle-blowers,
informers whose words are believed once in a thousand years,
lead-swinging supervisors, allegedly blind tipsters, people who claim
they would prefer to die rather than cease to be informers, and, in
their train, all the cloak-and-dagger men, alone with the bisexual
scouts, the decoders of posthumous messages, the intuitives, the
lunatics, and dealers in every kind of hocus-pocus."</TE>
<TE>   Is this Albania--an imagination spiked with classical myth,
superstition and totalitarian paranoia? Mark's friend Zef, who
himself has mysteriously disappeared, "had likened the monstrosities
of modern Albania to the ancient tale of the girl who had married a
snake. And he'd added, with dark foreboding: All these faces that
change their masks from one day to the next, like in some Greek drama
... they don't inspire a lot of confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Mark is troubled by the more proximate intimations of the crime
spree. Not only does he suspect that his girlfriend is implicated,
but he also worries that the long bloodline of policemen in his
family may be dangerous. "In recent times his second life--which for
so many years had existed as a silent parallel--had not, as
anticipated, dwindled to nothing but rather had seemed to reassert
itself ever more firmly. It sometimes weighed upon him so much that
he imagined that his police uniform was right there, waiting for him.
At the back of the studio he had an old chest that he was afraid to
open because he feared his uniform was already inside it."</TE>
<TE>   Kadare, born in 1936, has spent a life fighting the twin enemies
of Albania: totalitarianism and superstition. As a storyteller,
rather than a painter, however, the uniform in his trunk is a good
deal hipper than Mark's police uniform. With a breezy fluency, he
solves his mysteries with a political and mythical flair that
includes an image of Leonid Brezhnev and the blind Oedipus Rex
stumbling out of the agora like a pair of vagabonds from a Bob Dylan
tune. At the end, gods and demons gone, Mark looks to the sky, "a sky
bereft of its masters, a sky in mourning stretching to infinity." It
is an Albanian sky that looks very much like our own.</TE>

<HD>Poet, Writer, Orator, Statesman, Martyr</HD>
<DH>SELECTED WRITINGS: By Jose Marti, Edited and translated
from the Spanish by Esther Allen, Penguin: 462 pp., $15 paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM MILLER</AU>
<BD>Tom Miller is the author of "Trading With the Enemy: A
Yankee Travels Through Castro's Cuba" and editor of "Travelers'
Tales: Cuba." He is a fellow of the Gilder Lehrman Institute of
American History.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jose Marti is the most remarkable figure in the history of Cuba,
though he spent almost all of his adult life outside his homeland.
His importance can't be overestimated. Marti was born in Havana, in
January 1853, to a low-level Spanish officer and his wife. At 16, he
wrote passionately against Spanish control of Cuba, activity that
landed him hard labor in a stone quarry for "disloyalty," after which
he was granted clemency and banished to Spain. In 1878, after living
in Mexico and Guatemala, Marti returned to his patria. He was
arrested and deported again the following year, this time for
conspiring against Spain, a charge he would be guilty of for the rest
of his life. Pepe, as he was universally known, left Spain that same
year for New York City, which was to be his home base until just
before his death.</LD>
<TE>   There, in Spanish, English and on occasion French, he wrote
poetry, plays, essays, polemics and art criticism. For a few years,
he wrote commentary about life in the United States, its politics,
literary heroes, industry, expansion and personalities. These essays
on Walt Whitman, the Brooklyn Bridge, Coney Island and Buffalo Bill
appeared in Latin American newspapers. Marti was, in effect, a
syndicated columnist for the Americas, describing subjects such as
the memorial service in New York for Karl Marx, organized crime in
the states, the Haymarket rioters and women's suffrage.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, he also worked as a translator and for an
import-export concern, taught night-school Spanish and took part in a
hemisphere-wide conference on economics that, in retrospect, dealt
with globalization as it existed at the time. His grief-stricken
poetry often dealt with nature and love, frequently infused with a
subtle sensuality.</TE>
<TE>   Most of what Marti wrote, whether personal letters, verse, public
tracts or journalistic essays, has been saved and published. The
collected works, some 27 volumes, were brought out most recently in
Havana in the mid-1970s. Some of it has been translated, but no
English-language collection is as comprehensive as "Selected
Writings," the handsome new addition to the Penguin Classics series
edited and translated by Esther Allen, a book that follows Marti's
thinking, his activities and his pen, starting with his thoughtful
teenage letters to his mother from the stone quarry right up to the
day before he died. It also includes the
never-before-translated-into-English "War Diaries."</TE>
<TE>   The motivating force that drove Marti was not gaining a reputation
for his writing or for his worldly expertise but rather for a
two-word slogan coined by him: "Cuba libre." He organized tirelessly
on behalf of a Cuba free of Spain, writing, raising money, giving
speeches, forming a political party and meeting publicly and
clandestinely to further this singular goal. As U.S. annexation of
his homeland was bandied about, he grew increasingly fearful of
Washington's ham-handed foreign policy. He envisioned "a free Cuba
ruled by love and justice," writes Yale scholar Roberto Gonzalez
Echevarria in his admirable introduction to this new volume, "free of
prejudice and oppression, exempt from arbitrary rule by military
leaders, in harmonious commerce with the rest of the world, and
enjoying absolute self-determination." His dreams faced the
Caribbean.</TE>
<TE>   The broad sweep of his humanist and optimistic outlook is
available in this new volume, intelligently selected and in a
translation neither obsessed with late-19th century formality nor
condescending to contemporary idioms. There's not one off-key note.</TE>
<TE>   A Marti sampler: About Emerson, he wrote, "Marvelous old man, I
lay my sheaf of green palm fronds and my silver sword at your feet!"
Of Coney Island: "Everything is out in the open: the noisy groups,
the vast dining rooms, the peculiar courtship of the North Americans
... the theater, the photographer, the bathhouse." On graduation at
Vassar: "May the education of women become so common that she who
possesses it is not marked out." The qualities of Whitman's poetry:
"sudden silences, vibrant tones, hymnlike elan, and Olympic
intimacy."</TE>
<TE>   To fellow Cuban revolutionary Maximo Gomez, who, unlike Marti,
foresaw a military role in an independent Cuba: "A nation is not
founded, General, as a military camp is commanded." And of race:
"Anything that divides men from each other, that separates them,
singles them out, or hems them in, is a sin against humanity."
Shortly after moving to New York: "Everywhere, a woman's soul has
come to bless and sweeten my exhausted life. But I have not found in
New York my two lovely eyes! ... American women seem to have only one
necessary thought when they see a new man: 'How much is that man
worth?' " Madison Square Garden, after a walking marathon: "Full of
rinds, cigarette butts, empty kegs, and red-shirted ruffians, the
Garden reeks!"</TE>
<TE>   There is more. Those who came to Benjamin Harrison's inauguration:
"a mass of fanatics, pugilists, politicians, job-seekers, gawkers,
peddlers, vagabonds, and thieves." He noted that Washington's
prostitutes sported new outfits for the occasion. Of bare-knuckled
boxing: "Men charge at each other like bulls here. They gamble on the
strength of their necks, bite and claw in the fight, and then
go--covered in blood, their teeth knocked out, their foreheads
bruised, their knuckles raw, weaving and falling, through the mob
that shouts and flings its hats in the air and surges around them,
cheering." He assumed a Noble Savage impression of Indians.</TE>
<TE>   Marti lived in Manhattan and later Brooklyn, making note of
Chinatown's Mott Street, the great snowstorm of 1888 and Big
Business: "The railway companies, with legislatures and venal judges
as their accomplices, have falsified the public laws and have
wrongfully gained and distributed their wealth." I ask you, who could
have a problem with that observation?</TE>
<TE>   Marti's best-known lines achieved popularity decades after he
died. In the 1940s, a Havana radio show featured the tabloid news of
the day using a song titled "Guantanamera." Years later, a Cuban
music student grafted a few stanzas from Marti's "Versos Sencillos"
to the tune, a version that made its way north to Pete Seeger, then
teaching music at a New York state summer camp for red diaper babies.
Today the song, with its Marti lines intact, is the island's
best-known song, sung internationally, obligatory among conjuntos in
every Cuban tourist restaurant and used in advertisements for
Coca-Cola's bottled water, Dasani.</TE>
<TE>   Marti's range was wide; he could alternately be compared to Nelson
Mandela and Jimmy Breslin, Simon Bolivar and Tom Wolfe. More than a
century after he wrote them, his aphorisms are often manipulated out
of context by anti-Castroites and by Fidel himself, who claims Marti
as the "intellectual author" of the Cuban revolution. There are more
than enough pithy Marti quotes to support all points of view. All
sides routinely refer to him as the Apostle. The 26-year-old statue
of Marti at the northwest corner of Echo Park in Los Angeles--Jose
Marti Plaza--is undergoing restoration, but you can see him astride a
horse at the Sixth Avenue entrance to New York's Central Park. One of
his most militant essays was deliciously titled, "The Truth About the
United States." If Marti lived in the States today, he'd win a
MacArthur Fellowship "genius" grant and Bill Moyers would interview
him.</TE>
<TE>   As momentum for Cuban independence accelerated in the early 1890s,
so did Marti's activities. He started a Cuban newspaper in New York,
Patria, took a leadership role in the junta plotting the forthcoming
war of independence, rallied cigar rollers in Florida and continued
to write. His companeros muttered that while he sat pretty in the
States, they were risking all in the Caribbean. Finally he packed his
bags, settled his affairs and joined the others. His "War Diaries"
reveal a man at the peak of his powers of observation, fatalistic and
driven, possessed and obsessed. He quoted Goethe and carried a
science book. He wrote exquisite passages about nature; the
cleverness of ravens, rats, bats and toads fascinated him. He
described Maximo Gomez--the two had reconciled--as "splendid and
tender, at the foot of the mountain, on a path shaded by banana
trees, with the gully below."</TE>
<TE>   In April 1895, Gomez made him a major general in the independence
army. Together with others, the two traveled clandestinely through
eastern Cuba, Marti continuing to write letters and journal entries.
"Every day now I am in danger of giving my life for my country and my
duty," he wrote a friend on May 18, "in order to prevent, by the
timely independence of Cuba, the United States from extending its
hold across the Antilles and falling with all the greater force on
the lands of our Americas. All I have done up to now and all I will
do is for that.... I lived in the monster and I know its
entrails--and my sling is the sling of David." The next day the group
encountered a Spanish army contingent and, countermanding Gomez's
orders, 43-year-old Maj. Gen. Jose Julian Marti y Perez rode out in
front. Three bullets killed him.</TE>

Documents, 1958-1960, Edited by Mark Falcoff, U.S. Cuba Press: 452

<AU>LOUIS A. PEREZ JR.</AU>
<BD>Louis A. Perez Jr. is the author of numerous books on
Cuba, including "On Becoming Cuban: Identity, Nationality and
Culture," and teaches at the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After more than 40 years of confrontation with the United States,
Fidel Castro remains in power, defiant and determined to outlast one
more hostile administration in Washington. Ten years after the
collapse of socialism in Eastern Europe, at a time when the United
States projects power across the globe virtually uncontested, the
Cuban government, a mere 90 miles away, amends its constitution to
proclaim the inalterable character of socialism on the island. The
resolve and resilience of Cuba's leaders in the face of decades of
unrelenting pressure from Washington remains a source of perplexity
and pain to U.S. policymakers.</LD>
<LD>   Debate and dispute, of course, have long characterized the U.S.
response to Castro's Cuba. In the Cuban revolution, one comes face to
face, at one time and in one place, with issues of enduring vitality
and moment: power and powerlessness, dictatorship and democracy,
nationalism and imperialism, the quest for social justice and the
economic imperative. These issues prompt, on every side, vigorous
partisanship. Detachment and disinterest are almost impossible.</LD>
<TE>   Cuban history is similarly implicated, of course, and especially
those facets of the Cuban past that bear most directly on the
present. One such debate involves Castro's 26th of July movement
(named for the date in 1953 that saw his ill-fated attack against a
military barrack) and the armed insurrection against the government
of president-turned dictator Fulgencio Batista.</TE>
<TE>   The debate is over which of the two components of the 26th of July
movement--the civilians who fought in the urban underground, or
llano, or the soldiers who made up the guerrilla columns in the
mountains, or sierra--played the more decisive role in toppling
Batista.</TE>
<TE>   It is a debate that is at the heart of the complicated social and
class composition of the broad-based opposition to Batista.
Understanding this debate helps to illuminate the purpose to which
power was put after the 1959 ouster of Batista. As Julia E. Sweig
makes clear in "Inside the Cuban Revolution," the llano was made up
principally of middle-class professionals seeking to restore civil
liberties and free elections guaranteed by Cuba's 1940 constitution.
The sierra, on the other hand, represented by Castro, was composed of
peasants and workers and sought a thorough-going egalitarianism based
on social justice. The sierra prevailed, and many of the llano fled
into exile, claiming that the revolution had been betrayed and that a
liberal democratic program, rooted in a return to law, had been
subverted by a radical socialist whose principal objective was his
own power.</TE>
<TE>   In a thoughtfully argued and carefully researched book, Sweig, a
senior fellow and deputy director of the Latin America Program at the
Council on Foreign Relations, provides what will almost certainly be
the standard account of the Cuban insurrection for years to come.
Using a wide range of archival records and manuscript sources,
including important Cuban materials, Sweig successfully explores the
complex and often contradictory relations between the llano and the
sierra. She pays attention more to similarities than to differences
and, by emphasizing collaboration and coordination, provides a
coherent and cogent explanation of the astonishing success of
Castro's movement. Keenly aware of the larger historical context
which gives her tale meaning, Sweig shows how Castro held together
the disparate elements of his often-fractious movement while
providing considerable insight into his personality and the politics
that often divided his followers.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Falcoff, a longtime commentator on Latin American affairs, is
interested in Castro's ideological disposition and its origins. "The
Cuban Revolution and the United States" addresses the debate over
why, when and how Cuba became aligned with the Soviet Union. Some
observers insist that Castro was driven into the Soviet camp by
hostile U.S. policy. Others, like Falcoff, argue that he rose to
power disposed, if not determined, to align Cuba with the Soviet
Union, that he was probably from the outset a communist--or at least
a fellow traveler--and that his decision to seek ties with Moscow was
unrelated to U.S. policy.</TE>
<TE>   To this end, Falcoff has assembled a "history in documents" of
U.S.-Cuban relations between 1958 and 1960. His book is made up of
State Department documents (all of them previously available in an
officially published government volume). It is designed to tell "the
real story," namely, as Falcoff asserts, that "Castro's decision to
take his country into the Soviet bloc was not a reaction to specific
American policies but part of a grand design which proceeded
according to its own imperative."</TE>
<TE>   But "the real story" about Castro's "larger designs" cannot be
divined from State Department records alone. These documents reveal
less about Cuban motives than they do about Washington's perceptions
of Cuban behavior. Insight into Castro's motives and objectives is
not to be found in American documents but rather in Cuban materials,
such as the texts of Castro's speeches, interviews and
correspondence. These are precisely the kinds of sources that Sweig
uses to such good effect in her book but that are ignored by Falcoff.</TE>
<TE>   If Falcoff's use of documents is one-sided, so too is his
chronology. His selection of March 1958--the occasion of the U.S.
arms embargo against Batista--as the starting point of his history is
disingenuous. The author implicitly suggests that the United States
played a generally salutary and principled role in the Cuban drama of
the 1950s. But relations between Washington and Havana have a far
larger history. Ignoring this history makes it virtually impossible
to understand much of anything that followed the revolution's
triumph. Any serious examination of U.S.-Cuba relations during the
crucial years of 1959 and 1960--and thereafter as well--must be set
against the larger historical setting.</TE>
<TE>   It is true that Castro rose to power with an "attitude" toward the
United States. But even the most cursory review of the previous 60
years of relations between the United States and Cuba provides some
understanding of the sources of this attitude. But it is enough to
begin with March 10, 1952--the date of Batista's illegal seizure of
power--to appreciate Cuban attitudes. It was the unabashed warmth
that the United States showered upon the Batista government that
irked so many Cubans, a warmth made all the more egregious in the
face of U.S. exaltation of democratic principles.</TE>
<TE>   The United States trained and equipped the Cuban army units
deployed against Castro and his men in the Sierra Maestra. Falcoff
acknowledges the U.S. role in supplying the Batista government with
arms but pleads that "since Cuba was a sovereign state, there was no
way for the United States to control effectively the deployment and
use of its weaponry once transferred to it." It is difficult to
reconcile this disclaimer with the pronouncement made by Earl Smith,
the former U.S. ambassador to Cuba, who boasted to Congress in 1960
that "[T]he United States, until the advent of Castro, was so
overwhelmingly influential in Cuba that ... the American Ambassador
was the second most important man in Cuba; sometimes even more
important than the President."</TE>
<TE>   What Falcoff fails to grasp (and what the selective documents he's
at pains to promote do not reveal) is that momentum for change in
Cuba was related less to political issues than to social and economic
problems. Falcoff's allusion to "Cuba's large and dynamic private
sector" obscures the structural sources of the Cuban predicament. By
the middle of the 1950s, sugar production could no longer sustain the
country's economic development. Twenty-five percent of Cuba's workers
were chronically unemployed: It was much like what the United States
had experienced during the worst years of the Depression, except that
in Cuba it happened every year because of the dependence on the
annual sugar harvest. All through the 1950s, Cuba's economy was
contracting, unemployment was spreading, the cost of living was
increasing and the standard of living was declining.</TE>
<TE>   This was the situation confronting Castro when he came to power.
The new government was subject immediately to powerful popular
mobilizations to do something about the deepening crisis. Reforms
could not have been undertaken without challenging the historically
privileged place the United States occupied in Cuba. Castro's
determination to advance the primacy of national interests led
inevitably to confrontation with the United States. It is, of course,
no surprise that Washington would have responded with all the means
at its disposal to defend what it regarded as its legitimate
interests. It is, however, at this point that Cuban actions, U.S.
reactions and Cuban counteractions become complex, climaxing in the
rupture of U.S.-Cuba relations and the establishment of Cuba-Soviet
ties.</TE>
<TE>   To suggest that Cuban actions were unrelated to U.S. policy, as
Falcoff does, is simply not tenable. U.S. policy has consequences.
That these consequences are often not the ones intended--or perhaps
even the ones desired--should not obscure the fact that they are
nevertheless consequences of U.S. policy. To recognize this
relationship is to acknowledge that the United States is often
implicated in misfortunes of its own making. The question then
becomes how to undo the effects of misjudgments and miscalculations.</TE>
<TE>   One place to start is to recognize that responsibility for
outcomes must be assumed jointly by both sides. Or to put it another
way, as Jean Renoir has his character remark in the "Rules of the
Game": "Everyone has his reasons."</TE>

<LD>REFLECTIONS AND SHADOWS</LD>
<LD>   By Saul Steinberg</LD>
<LD>   Translated from the Italian</LD>
<TE>   by John Shepley</TE>
<TE>   Random House: 128 pp., $24.95</TE>
<TE>   "I managed to get out of a number of cul-de-sacs," Saul Steinberg,
one of America's most beloved artists and cartoonists, says, by which
he means "the vulgarities of humorous drawings and the banalities of
commercial art." This memoir is the product of many conversations
with and recorded by his friend Aldo Buzzi in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Steinberg was born in Romania in 1914. In 1933 he immigrated to
Italy, ostensibly to study architecture, but "my chief interest just
then was in girls." He was arrested for being Jewish in 1940, was
detained for a year and came to America in 1941. Steinberg had no
professional artistic training; this volume, with its brief memories,
adds much to our understanding of his inspirations and motivations:
family photographs, the primitive and avante-garde cultures of
Romania in his youth; and a strange collection of uncles: a sign
painter, a stationer, a watchmaker and a croupier.</TE>
<TE>   Steinberg, who died in 1999, is cheerful about everything, even
his arrest; his contempt is reserved for American children and
American food. He speaks briefly about his own work, particularly his
"Reflections," whimsical drawings of daily life upside-down and
right-side up. "These reflections enchant me," he writes, "by the
strangeness of their existence (strangeness is a quality of
miracles)." This parenthetical phrase illuminates what is so
appealing about Steinberg's drawings: their very strangeness.</TE>

<TE>   PERMA RED</TE>
<TE>   By Debra Magpie Earling</TE>
<TE>   Blue Hen: 288 pp., $24.95</TE>
<TE>   A new writer comes straight at us out of the West, bypassing the
conscious mind in describing her world of Indian reservations, so
that we almost smell that world before we understand it. Like Eskimos
and snow, Debra Magpie Earling has a hundred different ways of
describing clouds: "clouds faded overhead like wide ghosts," "clouds
bleaching to wind, a haze of dust changing light like silt changes
water," "clouds lit the high moon." Her writing is the most physical
I have read in a long time: a "blister-blue truck," a "dull-fisted
warmth in her throat," "dark silky wood," "wind spinning close to the
ground, gruff-voiced and angry." There are countless smells, sounds,
even feelings that are unfamiliar to many readers: the smell of smoke
and chokecherries, for example, or the "scorched wind puls[ing] at
the door," "dizzy beads of blood spun black in her vision," "the
thought made her breathless as clouds." Verbs and adjectives dance in
new configurations. All this and plot too.</TE>
<TE>   "Perma Red" is the story of a young, redheaded Indian girl,
Louise, who is pursued through her teens and young adulthood by three
men: Baptiste, violent and often drunk, "with his love so hateful it
made her wish for peace"; Charlie Kicking Woman, the tribal officer
who risks his marriage and his job to save her from Baptiste; and
Harvey Stoner, a rich, cruel cowboy. Louise will not be confined and
keeps running, first from truant officers, then from these men.
Finally, she marries Baptiste, fierce and dark, "the last of the old
ones," to escape the truant officers. After four days she runs away.
Earling, a member of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of
the Flathead Indian Reservation, captures Louise's wildness and in so
doing explains a great deal about how life once was for the Indians
in Montana.</TE>

<TE>   SHADOW MOUNTAIN</TE>
<TE>   A Memoir of Wolves,</TE>
<TE>   a Woman, and the Wild</TE>
<TE>   By Renee Askins</TE>
<TE>   Doubleday: 336 pp., $24.95</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, Renee Askins founded the Wolf Fund, the organization that
helped reintroduce wolves to Yellowstone National Park. "Shadow
Mountain" is the story of how she came to love and admire wolves, but
it is also an attempt to inspire readers to form relationships with
animals. "The other," she often calls them, describing the
recognition of sameness and difference, the sense of companionship,
not "ascendancy," that she feels with them.</TE>
<TE>   Through high school and college, she took several internships to
study owls, wolves and deer. Raising a wolf pup named Natasha, Askins
formed an attachment that was broken when her mentor sent Natasha to
another compound, where she died in captivity. This break fueled
Askins' ferocity and her skepticism toward academics and bureaucrats.</TE>
<TE>   Askins writes about the importance of wildness inside of us as
well as wilderness in our world. She raises the question: Why do we
destroy everything organic in our environment? She insists on the
importance of animals and nature to children. "I believe," she
writes, "that places make us who we are, that landscape carves out a
certain character and community, and that ultimately the places in
which we choose to live govern the unfolding of our lives."</TE>

<LD>PASSING STRANGE</LD>
<LD>   By Sally MacLeod</LD>
<LD>   Random House: 310 pp., $23.95</LD>
<TE>   Pungently erotic, searingly violent and ultimately tragic, Sally
MacLeod's ambitious first novel is a high-wire act, and she writes
with such devil-may-care abandon that you get the sense that she has
no need for a safety net. "Passing Strange" is a novel about plastic
surgery, infidelity, the New South, class resentment and interracial
sex. It's part "Madame Bovary" and part bus-station novel. And its
heroine, Claudia, is a melancholic soul who's as recklessly willful
as she is disturbingly passive. Born to a white working-class Vermont
family and painfully ugly, Claudia somehow snags a well-born New York
WASP husband, a lovable frat-boy jackass. When the unlikely couple
decide to move to North Carolina, he arranges radical surgery for
Claudia, and she is transformed, at least on the outside, into a
beauty: "this unearned esteem would weigh on me, and paw at me like
the hand of a beggar." Once in North Carolina, the new Claudia is
stunned by the local black population, by "rear ends like
Lycra-coated melons." When she starts meeting Calvin, the black
yardman, for illicit encounters in an abandoned farmhouse, she is
"perfected," and all hell breaks loose.</TE>
<TE>   With its sexual obsessions, "Passing Strange" dares us to call it
racist, but each page is full of brave truths about everything from
love, desire and family to strip malls, country clubbers and
even--when this daring novel heads for home--the death penalty.</TE>

<TE>   THE SOLACE OF LEAVING EARLY</TE>
<TE>   By Haven Kimmel</TE>
<TE>   Doubleday: 240 pp., $23.95</TE>
<TE>   "They were curious about nothing, they exhibited no restlessness,
they seemed to want nothing more than they had." This is the Rev.
Amos Townsend reflecting on the mild-mannered Midwesterners who
attend his Lost Creek Church of the Brethren in rural Haddington,
Ind. For grad-school dropout Langston Braverman, the daughter of one
of Amos' parishioners, Haddington is similarly alarming. "Some days
she was able to ignore the aesthetic travesty of her hometown;
sometimes she felt it acutely." "The Solace of Leaving Early" is a
kind of contemporary "Winesburg, Ohio" as seen through the gimlet
eyes of two seemingly opposite outsiders: There's Amos, toiling at
his awkward sermons, obsessing over theologian Paul Tillich and
patiently counseling the unhappily wed of Haddington. And then
there's Langston, condescending, militantly feminist and supposedly
writing a postmodern novel in the attic of the aluminum-sided house
she grew up in. Yet both share a fondness for Kierkegaard and John
Donne, and both are intensely caught up in the nuances of
Christianity.</TE>
<TE>   Telling this story in alternating chapters that give us the
overlapping viewpoints of Amos and Langston, Haven Kimmel puts these
frustrated small-town intellectuals on a collision course as they vie
for influence over two orphaned sisters who call themselves
Immaculata and Epiphany. With Amos and Langston racing toward either
hatred or true love, Kimmel gives us a stunning bird's-eye view of
rural American life, as damning as it is affectionate: Haddington may
have its gun-toters and religious kooks, but for at least some of the
locals, Emily Dickinson and Ezra Pound are as cherished as the
Farmer's Almanac.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HIMALAYAN DHABA</TE>
<TE>   By Craig Joseph Danner</TE>
<TE>   Dutton: 288 pp., $23.95</TE>
<TE>   Craig Joseph Danner, the author of this novel about an American
doctor's tenure in a snowy Himalayan outpost, has a knack for food
imagery. At various points, the sky over the remote village where
Mary has come to heal (or, at least, not harm) resembles chicken
broth, salad greens and, when ravens circle, pepper on scrambled
eggs. There are frequent mentions of meals being shuttled from a tiny
cafe--the dhaba of the title--by Amod, a shy waiter with a lazy eye
and a crush on Mary. If the many invocations of food highlight the
centrality of the dhaba for the assorted townsfolk and interlopers
who wander through this engaging tale, Danner also makes sure to
avoid making us hopelessly hungry: For all of "Himalayan Dhaba's"
rich exotica, there's more realism than magic here, and the
overriding tone is one of lean anxiety rather than feast-like
sensuality. Mary, it turns out, has journeyed here because her late
husband once volunteered his medical services in the village
hospital. But Mary soon discovers she has little time--amid breech
babies and ruptured appendixes--to ruminate over her loss: She's
surrounded by cultural miscommunication and by a weird plot by the
town drug dealer to kidnap a well-to-do British backpacker.</TE>
<TE>   Danner, himself once a doctor in the Himalayas, is a convincing
guide in the operating room and throughout this odd village, with its
Western stoners, bemused locals and an earnest young woman testing
the limits of her grit.</TE>

<DH>REPUBLIC OF DREAMS: Greenwich Village: The American
Bohemia, 1910-1960, By Ross Wetzsteon, Simon &amp; Schuster:  620 pp.,
$35</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WENDY SMITH</AU>
<BD>Wendy Smith is the author of "Real-Life Drama: The
Group Theatre and America, 1931-1940."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Greenwich Village! Those two words conjure up a rush of images.
Narrow, winding streets defiantly at odds with the grid pattern
imposed on the rest of Manhattan in the early 19th century. Tiny
theaters presenting plays no commercial producer would touch.
Precariously financed magazines publishing articles so incendiary in
language, so blunt that the contributors frequently found themselves
in court. Smoky coffee shops crowded with people dressing and
behaving in ways that would never have been tolerated in the
hometowns they had fled.</LD>
<LD>   For more than a century, the Village gave refuge to the nation's
misfits, enfolding them in a community that embraced individual
eccentricity. This community may now seem fragmented, dispersed to
New York City's outer boroughs as rents skyrocket and the investment
bankers move in, but fragmentation, dispersal and gentrification are
nothing new. "Greenwich Village isn't what it used to be," critic and
editor Ross Wetzsteon reminds us, was uttered as early as 1916.</LD>
<TE>   Wetzsteon's sweeping yet intimate history of America's most famous
bohemian neighborhood is, regrettably, both the first and last book
he wrote. (He edited two collections of plays.) The intelligence, wit
and shrewd analytical abilities that distinguish "Republic of Dreams"
will be familiar qualities to those who read Wetzsteon's theater
reviews and essays in the Village Voice during the three decades
before his death in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The structural flaws of the narrative's second half may be
attributed in part to the fact that he didn't live to finish or
revise the manuscript; his daughter Rachel's afterword states that he
planned a final chapter bringing the story up to the present.
However, it's unlikely that chapter would have resolved these
technical problems, which spring from the author's generous spirit
and ambitious desire to encompass the entire Village experience. Like
the rebels he profiles with such sympathy and acuity, Wetzsteon's
successes and failures are inextricably intertwined.</TE>
<TE>   To begin with the good news, he has written the best account to
date of the explosion of artistic and political energy between 1912
and 1917 that has been called everything from "the joyous season" to
"the lyric years." Wetzsteon achieves a delicate equilibrium of
abiding affection and clear-eyed criticism as he examines such
outsized personalities as Mabel Dodge, John Reed, Max Eastman, Emma
Goldman, Margaret Sanger, Jig Cook and Eugene O'Neill, with
long-overdue attention paid to lesser-known women like Crystal
Eastman and Mary Heaton Vorse.</TE>
<TE>   Through such seminal, though short-lived, institutions as The
Masses magazine and the Provincetown Players, he argues, this
generation gave shape to the amorphous notion of what it meant to be
a bohemian in America and located its geographic center: "Young men
and women dissatisfied with a small-town or middle-class life but
only vaguely attuned to the insurgent sensibility began to hear tales
of an almost mythical place called Greenwich Village ... where people
pursued love and beauty and justice without having to respond to
parental invocations of responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   Many writers, particularly academics, have condescended to the
prewar Villagers' exuberant but intellectually sloppy intermingling
of socialism, feminism, Freudianism, modernism and any other -ism
they could find. Popular histories such as Allen Churchill's "The
Improper Bohemians," while more sympathetic, have tended to jovially
trivialize the rebellion as a simple expression of youthful high
spirits, which is hardly a full assessment of the risks of lengthy
jail terms knowingly taken by Sanger when she disseminated
birth-control information or by The Masses editors when they opposed
in print the United States' entry into World War I.</TE>
<TE>   Wetzsteon avoids both of these traps. He's well aware that his
subjects "alternated between the frivolous and the fearless," and
he's particularly shrewd on the role played by their well-publicized
antics (climbing to the top of Washington Square Arch to declare the
Village "a free and independent republic" is typical) in establishing
"a common phenomenon of the twentieth century--success measured not
by praise but by notoriety."</TE>
<TE>   But he values their espousal of personal liberation as a political
principle, spotlighting it as an enduring trait of American
dissidence in all its varieties: "Wasn't heightened consciousness the
path both to individual happiness and social justice? Change yourself
and change the world--the agenda of the Lyrical Left in the prewar
Village may have been naive but it was hardly modest."</TE>
<TE>   That all-encompassing ethos reemerged during the 1960s, and
Wetzsteon (who arrived in the Village early in that decade) clearly
shares it. He knows the difference between a visionary and a crank,
but he understands that the Village has been shaped by both, and he
refuses to leave out the cranks. This decision, in many ways
admirable, has an ultimately unfortunate impact.</TE>
<TE>   The book's first half, perfectly balanced between individual lives
and communal endeavors even in its chapter titles ("Mabel Dodge's
Salon," "Max Eastman and The Masses") closes with a
characteristically astute portrait of Edna St. Vincent Millay and the
shift in mood during the 1920s, when new residents saw the Village
primarily as a place where they could lead their unconventional lives
unmolested by the bourgeoisie, rather than a staging ground for
social and sexual revolution.</TE>
<TE>   Had Wetzsteon stopped there, he might well have produced the
definitive history of Greenwich Village's most culturally significant
period, with suggestive foreshadowings of how 20th century
bohemianism would be altered by the mass media.</TE>
<TE>   That's not what he wanted to do. From Millay he moves on to a
chapter called "Eminent Villagers," which showcases his gift for
vivid thumbnail sketches and his mounting difficulties in controlling
the material. This chapter takes charlatan Guido Bruno ("the Barnum
of Bohemia"), genuine nut case Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven
(famous for bizarre costumes that several times got her arrested for
indecent exposure), wealthy dilettante Robert Clairmont (whose
open-door parties went on for days) and "hobo poet" Harry Kemp (first
of the great Village self-mythologizers) and tosses them together
with more substantial figures who are hardly Villagers at all.</TE>
<TE>   Margaret Anderson paused there with The Little Review for a few
years en route from Chicago to Paris; Willa Cather lived there from
1906 to 1932 because it gave her "order, comfort, security, and
especially privacy--the very things most young people came to the
Village to escape"; and Theodore Dreiser stayed there not because he
found a community but, like the Abstract Expressionists several
decades later, he found a neighborhood of "low rents, cheap bars, and
willing women."</TE>
<TE>   Wetzsteon's point, made with increasing insistence as his
chronology becomes choppier, is that the Village "was a community in
service of individuality." He doesn't flinch from showing that as
individualism came to the fore, eccentricity often degenerated into
neurosis, and the celebration of difference became the cult of
failure.</TE>
<TE>   When elderly writer Djuna Barnes, asked for her ID in order to
cash a check, loftily declares, "Do I look like the sort of person
who would have a driver's license?"  it's a hilarious moment that
subtly demonstrates how many Legendary Village Characters happily
brandished their inability to deal with modern society instead of
aspiring to change it.</TE>
<TE>   But as the characters grow more self-obsessed, both they and the
author's well-articulated themes are more tenuously related to
Greenwich Village. Hart Crane and e.e. cummings both came to dislike
Village bohemians; Dylan Thomas was a foreigner who made them an
audience for his self-destructive theatrics. Thomas Wolfe was as
crazy in Brooklyn as in downtown Manhattan; Delmore Schwartz as
alienated on college campuses as on Greenwich Avenue. Wetzsteon's
decision to thread his narrative through personalities, which worked
well at first, begins to seem like a mistake.</TE>
<TE>   From time to time--in solid chapters on Maxwell Bodenheim and Joe
Gould, a tender one on Dawn Powell--he persuasively reforges the
Village link. But the book closes, running out of steam rather than
wrapping up with the Abstract Expressionists, who in Wetzsteon's
words "never really regarded themselves as Villagers at all."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it's appropriate that the author ends his account in the
days just before he came to the Village; as he notes in the
introduction, "from its very birth, bohemia seemed to exist in the
past."</TE>
<TE>   There is much to like about this admittedly flawed book. It's a
consistent pleasure to read prose studded with such marvelous
sentences as these, "The Village is the only community in America
where Edgar Allan Poe could score drugs in the 1840s and Henry James
could stroll past grazing cows in the 1890s," and "Village women ...
soon learned that many men all too enthusiastically encouraged them
to throw off their clothes along with their shackles."</TE>
<TE>   Wetzsteon has sympathetically articulated a crucial tenet of
bohemianism--the insistence that personal and political change go
hand in hand--and gently identified some of its pathologies, in
particular the cult of failure and self-destruction. Anyone who cares
about American culture should read "Republic of Dreams." Its
contradictions are our contradictions, and its largeness of heart is
something that has been sorely lacking in our public discourse for
several decades.</TE>

<DH>THE DECLINE AND FALL OF THE LETTERED CITY:  Latin America
in the Cold War, By Jean Franco, Harvard University Press: 320 pp.,
$22.95 paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRANCES STONOR SAUNDERS</AU>
<BD>Frances Stonor Saunders is the author of "The Cultural
Cold War: The CIA and the World of Arts and Letters" and is the arts
editor of the New Statesman.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During the first week of June 1962, Robert Lowell flew to Brazil with
his wife, Elizabeth Hardwick, and their 5-year-old daughter, Harriet.
They were met in Para by journalist Keith Botsford. All went well
until Elizabeth and Harriet returned to the United States, leaving
Lowell to continue his trip without them. On Sept. 4, accompanied
only by Botsford, Lowell left for Argentina.</LD>
<LD>   In Buenos Aires, the trouble started. Lowell threw away the pills
prescribed for his manic depression, took a string of double martinis
at a reception in the presidential palace and, to the bewilderment of
the assembled generals, announced that he was "Caesar of Argentina"
and Botsford his "lieutenant." He then gave a speech extolling Hitler
and the superman ideology before stripping naked and mounting an
equestrian statue in one of the city's main squares. After continuing
in this way for several days, he was eventually overpowered in his
hotel, wrestled into a straitjacket and taken to the Clinica
Bethlehem, where his legs and arms were bound with leather straps
while he was injected with vast doses of Thorazine. Botsford's
humiliation was completed when Lowell, from this position of
Prometheus bound, ordered him to whistle "Yankee Doodle Dandy" and
"The Battle Hymn of the Republic."</LD>
<TE>   Later that month, Mary McCarthy wrote to Hannah Arendt that she
had just learned "that Cal Lowell was in a mental ward in Buenos
Aires and that Marilyn Monroe committed suicide because she had been
having an affair with Bobby Kennedy and the White House had
intervened .... Our age begins to sound like some awful colossal
movie about the late Roman Emperors and their Messalinas and
Poppaeas."</TE>
<TE>   These episodes don't feature in Jean Franco's book, but the
disintegration of Lowell and the decadence of the Kennedy prefecture
speak eloquently to its title, "The Decline and Fall of the Lettered
City." Franco's lettered city is Latin, not North, America, of
course, but the two could never be separated as long as the Cold War
continued. Indeed, Lowell's tour was a small chapter in the
kulturkampf at the heart of that conflict, planned as it was by the
CIA-backed Congress for Cultural Freedom, which had chosen him "as an
outstanding American to counteract ... Communist people like Neruda."
As it turned out, Lowell was less an emissary for the virtues of
American anti-communism than for the efficiency of Thorazine, but the
failure of his trip merely encouraged the CIA to refine its
machinations.</TE>
<TE>   Franco's project is to examine the efforts of writers, over the
Cold War decades, to open a new space in the cultural and political
imagination of Latin America and to chart the loss of their utopian
aspirations in the course of the continent's conversion to
neo-liberalism and a free-market economy. It's curious, therefore,
that she shows only a glancing interest in U.S. strategies to muscle
in on this space. To this end, the CIA owned several highbrow
magazines circulated behind the Tortilla Curtain, notably Cuadernos
and its successor, Mundo Nuevo (edited by Uruguayan literary critic
Rodriguez Monegal, and designed to promote the theme of Fidelismo sin
Fidel). To ignore the influence of these journals and the
significance of their links to the U.S. intelligence community seems
almost perverse in a study built around the phrases "Cold War" and
"Lettered City."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the omission is in deference to existing scholarship, in
particular Maria Eugenia Mudrovcic's "Mundo Nuevo: Cultura y Guerra
Fria en la decada del 60." More likely, Franco simply couldn't find
room for such investigation in a study that is already bursting at
the bindings with discoveries of a different kind. For example:
"Progress is illusory from its initiation, giving Schopenhauer's veil
of illusion and Mauthner's radical nominalism a certain plausibility
in the Latin American context." Er, right. Or, of Carlos Fuentes,
Gabriel Garcia Marquez and several other writers: "What is
interesting about them is not so much their heuristic potential as
their ascending hierarchy that puts a totally diverse group ... at
the highest level of abstraction and hence creativity." Just so. Or
even (under the section heading "The Scopic Regime"): "Power seduces.
The penis is the instrument of phallic power, that which activates
meaning and fantasy."</TE>
<TE>   Adorno, Horkheimer, Althusser, Eagleton, Levi-Strauss, Lyotard,
Foucault--these murderously difficult figures who refused to stay
murdered--bleed all over this book, the Banquo's ghost of all that
frenzied excitement about critical theory and post-structuralism.
Franco is rarely able to shrug them off in her prodigious survey of
postwar Latin American literature; when she does, her insights--as
well as her writing--are illuminating. In a section on "powerful
cadavers," she is fascinating on the post-mortem myths that congealed
around the corpses of Che Guevara and Eva Peron (whose body made a
nomadic tour of several continents before being repatriated to
Argentina in 1974). Franco goes on to reveal how potent images of the
body in Latin America are intrinsic to the phenomenon of
"disappearance." She retrieves the origins of magical realism and
correctly identifies the moment of its debasement in Western culture
("When Bloomingdale ads began to mention magical realism, it was
clear that the term had passed into the twilight zone of 'idees
recues.' "</TE>
<TE>   Franco rightly observes that "Latin America had, from the conquest
onward, been an experimental body on which the developed world showed
off its virtuosity." She gives many examples of this, but her most
piercing critique is of Werner Herzog's 1982 film, "Fitzcarraldo,"
which staged imperial nostalgia as cultural enrichment. In tracing
the impact of the rubber boom and its exploitation of native labor,
the film's makers seemed to find nothing odd about the fact that for
their reenactment, "they deployed a plane, a helicopter, three
ancient steamboats, a cast of about 700 extras--including Campa,
Machiguenga, Camisea and Shivancoreni Indians, some prostitutes,
flush toilets, cold-water showers and electric generators, and a
bulldozer that used 150 gallons of fuel that had to be flown in by
light plane and ferried up the river in dugout canoes. All of this
was mobilized, at great expense, to give the film its air of
'authenticity,' which was ironically underscored when lives were
lost. One of the Indians drowned, others got sick, and a plane crash
severely injured the pilot and five Indians who were being flown in."
Herzog was recorded as saying, without a hint of irony, that "we will
probably have one of the last feature films with authentic natives in
it. They are fading away very quickly."</TE>
<TE>   While closing on a note of optimism, Franco's study is really an
extended exposition of the failure of Latin American writers' to
claim that creative freedom they sought. It wasn't so much the Cold
War as the pressures of globalization and the ooze of low culture
that destroyed their dreams. Fuentes anticipated this when, in 1966,
he complained: "No sir, we no longer have Parnassus of the spirit nor
Arcadias of good taste: we are up to our necks in the rat race, we
are submerged like any gringo or Frenchman in the world of
competition and status symbols, the world of neon lights and Sears
Roebuck and washing machines, the films of James Bond and Campbell's
soup cans."</TE>
<TE>   Franco shares Fuentes' disgust, I suspect. Ultimately, it's
impossible to discern her views, buried as they are in a welter of
academic obfuscation. Because the book is part of a series, edited by
Edward Said, called Convergences, it is a pity that it simply fails
to converge.</TE>

<HD>When We Were Young</HD>
<DH>BACK THEN: Two Lives in 1950s New York, By Anne Bernays,
and Justin Kaplan, William Morrow: 310 pp., $25.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WAKEFIELD</AU>
<BD>Dan Wakefield is the author of the memoir "New York in
the 50s," which was the basis of a documentary film of the same name.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the 35th reunion of the Columbia College class of 1955, Rabbi
Harold Kushner told his classmates that there were shelves and
shelves of books on the '60s in any library, but only a few, if any,
volumes about our own decade, the '50s. We were dismissed as "The
Silent Generation," part of the boring "Eisenhower Age," descriptions
that the late Meg Greenfield once called "a sort of a libel" on a
decade she believed was "badly researched and badly reported."</LD>
<LD>   Since Kushner made his observation 12 years ago, there has been at
least a trickle (if hardly a flood) of books that chronicle that era
as it played out in New York City. Earlier this year the musician
David Amram published "Offbeat: Collaborating With Kerouac," an
insider's corrective account of the Beat scene, and now Pulitzer
Prize-winning biographer Justin Kaplan and his wife, novelist Anne
Bernays, have written a lively double memoir of the time.</LD>
<TE>   Though the young, single Bernays made forays to Greenwich Village
to meet her lover, the book reviewer Anatole Broyard, ("an erotic
villain"), she and Kaplan were hardly part of the cold-water flat and
Thunderbird wine scene of the Beats. They were "both children of
privilege," Anne being driven to private school by "the Bernayses'
uniformed chauffeur," while Justin was sent to a "private progressive
school equipped with a swimming pool, gymnasium, woodworking shop,
and rooftop playground," before entering Harvard.</TE>
<TE>   Daughter of the colorful public relations czar Edward L. Bernays,
Anne ("Growing Up Rich") met such megastars as Gloria Swanson and
Salvador Dali and went to a Thanksgiving dinner cooked by Marlene
Dietrich; later she dated a Brit whose aunt was a niece of Queen
Victoria and a writer who had served as Trotsky's bodyguard. Through
a Harvard pal, Justin partied with W. Somerset Maugham and Dame Edith
Sitwell.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their star-studded social and working lives, these native
New Yorkers were as dazzled by Manhattan as my fellow hayseeds and I
who got off the train from Indiana to behold the cathedral of Grand
Central Station. "During the 1950s," Bernays and Kaplan write, "we
saw the city as if finding something unmatchable anywhere in the
world." For Kaplan it was "the Promised Land where, for someone my
age, almost anything wondrous and unexpected could happen."</TE>
<TE>   The authors don't attempt a portrait of the period beyond their
personal experience, told in alternating chapters, yet some of its
big themes come alive through their own stories. Like so many young
people in New York then, both were in psychoanalysis. Kaplan
observes: "For better or worse, Sigmund Freud was the Pied Piper of
my generation .... We fell into line behind him, like the children of
Hamelin." Bernays, a great-niece of Freud, was "an instant postulant"
to analysis: "Why not? Everyone else was doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Both authors were part of the vital literary life of the day,
Bernays working on the groundbreaking mass-market literary journal,
discovery, Kaplan as an assistant to publisher Max Schuster and then
as an editor at Simon &amp; Schuster.</TE>
<TE>   He found "ferment and excitement" in working with such writers as
sociologist C. Wright Mills, "an intellectual hero of the time," but
took less pleasure negotiating contracts with the likes of Bertrand
Russell and the "legendary financier, presidential advisor, and
park-bench blowhard Bernard Baruch." It was a time when "[w]riters
like Philip Roth, Bernard Malamud, Saul Bellow and Allen Ginsberg
challenged the traditional WASP hegemony in American letters,"
creating "their own mainstream along with a literary language." Young
New Yorkers were also still in thrall to the legends, as well as the
language, of literary heroes like Hemingway and Fitzgerald, the
exiles of the '20s. The sacred pilgrimage of the generation was the
trip to Europe by ocean liner ("the speediest crossed the Atlantic in
four and a half days") and going there was "like dying into a new
life."</TE>
<TE>   Literary aspirants also inherited the hangovers glamorized by
Hemingway and his crowd, believing booze was a required element of
creativity rather than the curse that killed so many so young, like
Fitzgerald at 44 and Dylan Thomas at 39. "Strong drink, the
obligatory lubricant of publishing lunches, sales conferences, and
trade events, was an occupational hazard for editors and agents,"
writes ex-editor Kaplan. One young editor came back from lunch so
drunk his boss "sent him out to be sobered up by means of a fire
hose."</TE>
<TE>   In their early 30s, with two children, Bernays quit her publishing
job and Kaplan left his with a $5,000 advance to write a biography
("Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain," which would win the Pulitzer.) After
living all her life in the city with "the world's fastest pulse,"
Bernays wanted the "slow heart rate" (or as Kaplan called it, "the
slower pulse rate") of Cambridge, Mass., where they've lived since
1959. As if re-creating part of their youth, their home became a
literary salon that would make the subject of another fine memoir,
with the likes of Updike, Malamud and Galbraith in the stellar cast.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From `Back Then'</TE>
<TE>   We were lucky. We met, began our careers and adult lives, and
opened our eyes to the world of possibilities in New York, in the
1950s, when the pent-up energies of the Depression years and World
War II were at flood tide. You could see this in the rush of crowds,
in big fish-finned cars on the streets and in showrooms, in store
windows crammed with things that had been scarce for
years--high-fashion shoes, kitchen and laundry appliances, generously
cut dresses and suits, Scotch whiskey, prime cuts of beef, caviar ,
imported cheeses, sugar-saturated cakes--and now in the first
affordable, invariably temperamental television sets. (To own one,
too large to move or disguise, was something of a guilty secret, a
cultural sellout according to our sniffier friends.) We discovered
the luxury of the inessential--two-tone refrigerators, electric can
openers, the conversation pit.</TE>
<TE>   Postwar meant abundance, rapid change, physical and social
mobility, a farewell to the lingering effects of the years 1941 to
1945: austerity, scarcities, postponements for "the duration." It
also meant urban sprawl, intimations of conflict with a new enemy,
the Soviet Union, fallout shelters marked by black and yellow signs

<HD>When Havana Danced With Hope</HD>
<DH>HAVANA: The Revolutionary Moment, By Burt Glinn, Umbrage
Editions: 128 pp., $39.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE WASSERMAN</AU>
<BD>Steve Wasserman is Book Editor of The Times. He has
visited Cuba numerous times.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nothing is as seductive as making history; taking pictures of it is
nearly as intoxicating. Burt Glinn, a young American photographer,
knew a good story when he saw one. He persuaded his roommate, Clay
Felker, to lend him the money to hire a charter flight to Havana to
witness what he felt in his bones was an epochal event. For Glinn, an
intrepid 33-year-old member of the Magnum Photographic Cooperative
since the start of his career in 1950, the revolution was just a shot
away.</LD>
<LD>   Glinn's photographs record the weeklong trek Castro and his men
made as they emerged victorious from two years' combat in the remote
Sierra Maestra and marched the length of Cuba on their way to Havana.
As they rolled through province after province, city after city, en
route to the nation's capital to proclaim their mastery of the
island, Glinn snapped hundreds of photographs (of which more than 60
are reproduced in this book). They depict Castro and his men, weary
with fatigue and near-disbelief stamped on their youthful faces, and
a thronging populace beside itself with exhilaration. Eyes dance with
hope; the radiant future beckons.</LD>
<TE>   "Havana: The Revolutionary Moment" is about the eros of
revolution. Not only were Castro and his barbudos better-looking than
the corrupt politicians and gangsters they overthrew, they knew it,
and it is easy to see, on the evidence of these iconic photographs,
how it was that a "golden legend," as Regis Debray once called it,
arose. It reduced the Cuban Revolution to a romantic fable of the
charismatic Castro and his 12 apostles, whose numbers multiplied
faster than players in a pyramid game and who, in only 24 months of
guerrilla warfare, succeeded in toppling the tyrant Fulgencio
Batista.</TE>
<TE>   It is hard at this remove to apprehend the appeal that Castro
exuded the moment he burst onto the international scene by spoiling
Batista's 1959 New Year's Eve party. These photographs help, but they
conceal more than they reveal. Understanding a revolt whose victory
engendered passionate partisans on both sides of the Florida Straits
is a daunting task. Most Americans, despite the passage of more than
four decades, still know little about Castro beyond the fact that
Castro, a bearded character once given to long cigars and longer
speeches, has successfully survived Washington's persistent efforts
to topple him from his island perch. Washington continues to brand
Castro as a revolutionary brigand; American enmity, of course,
benefits him enormously by permitting Castro to rationalize
repressive rule as necessary for national defense. By now, however,
the history of U.S.-Cuba relations reads like stale fiction: The plot
is threadbare, the characters are caricatures.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't, perhaps, have to turn out this way. Even the most
cursory perusal of this book tells why. These photographs freeze a
historic moment bursting with hope and possibility. The tyrant was
gone and revolutionary idealism had yet to curdle into cynicism; nor
had the effort to survive soured into despotism. Here are pictures of
Sunday patriots, rebels with and without a cause, city girls flirting
with shy guerrilleros, a general chaos engulfing a people in
near-erotic tumult even as Castro seeks to hold a disparate movement
together by the sheer force of his considerable personality and his
demonstrated and widely admired willingness to risk his life in the
fight against the dictatorship.</TE>
<TE>   It was, of course, Castro's legendary eloquence, strength of
character and unyielding commitment to action that drew men and women
alike to his side. Personality trumped politics. It was this
charismatic element--an element that infuses many of Glinn's pictures
of Castro with a nearly electric charge still palpable after all
these years--that caused the Cuban Communist Party, among others, to
consider Castro, during the early years of the revolt against
Batista, to be a dangerous extremist. Indeed, following his abortive
attack on the Moncada barracks in Santiago de Cuba on July 26, 1953,
it had condemned him as a "petit bourgeois adventurer" and refused to
have anything to do with him until Batista's fall was imminent.</TE>
<TE>   Others, like Che Guevara, were drawn to him, although Guevara,
too, originally regarded Castro's movement as bourgeois, even while
conceding that it was led by a man whose "image is enhanced by
personal qualities of extraordinary brilliance." Later, Castro's
willingness to embrace more radical solutions when necessary would
continually surprise and please Guevara, as much as it dismayed the
movement's moderates. The seduction of the 32-year-old Castro's
flamboyant, nearly bohemian leadership, his spontaneity of spirit,
were almost impossible to resist. He was virile, glamorous; in a
word, sexy. He relied less on Marxism than on photogenesis to capture
the minds and hearts of millions.</TE>
<TE>   But photographs, notoriously, lie. Piercing their romantic
aura--partly of Castro's own making--is the challenge that confronts
any serious observer of the Cuban Revolution. One would not know from
these ravishing pictures, for example, that the movement to oust
Batista was riven by ideological differences--differences that had
their origin in the diverging strategies and priorities of those who
fought in the mountains and in the cities. The seeds of future
conflicts (and defections), which would reflect the contradictions of
class, are, at least in these photographs, yet to erupt. Still, it is
all but impossible to gaze at these naive pictures of armed
campesinos, many of them still boys barely able to boast peach fuzz
on their cheeks, as they sprawl about the lobby of the newly occupied
Hilton Hotel, promptly dubbed the Havana Libre, without the knowledge
of future betrayal and heartbreak. Castro, after all, wouldn't
declare his revolution socialist until he had defeated the
U.S.-backed attempt to overthrow it following the Bay of Pigs in
1961.</TE>
<TE>   But neither Glinn nor the many photographers from the United
States, Europe and Latin America (or from Cuba itself, for that
matter) who followed him over the course of the next decades would
succeed in capturing the complexity of the history they were
privileged to witness. The medium of photography is inherently
coarse. While it brilliantly captures people in anguish and ecstasy
(and in every conceivable human state in between), buildings standing
tall and in decay or in ruins, the abundance and absence of
vegetation, the misery of the city dweller and the poverty of the
peasant, the contrast between the opulence of the haves and the
despoilments of the downtrodden, the political or social or
historical context exists, as it were, outside the frame. Context
eludes the camera's eye and, from the standpoint of aesthetics, is
arguably irrelevant.</TE>
<TE>   It all seems so long ago and far away. Castro will mark his 76th
birthday next month. He has been in power longer than any other
political leader alive. The promise of his early years has succumbed
to a tyranny whose end is nowhere in sight. A police state has been
created to enforce an ethic of self-denial, frugality, austerity,
unremitting labor and self-discipline. His early ideals of
libertarian socialism are nowhere in evidence. Today it is abundantly
clear that Castro is essentially a practical caudillo for whom power
matters above all else. Confronting implacable hostility from the
Colossus of the North, Castro destroyed the revolution in order to
save it. Had he died shortly after overthrowing Batista, his
unsullied place in Cuba's history would have been assured. His work
as a revolutionary would have been fruitful up to the moment when he
failed to recognize that it was time to step aside. He was unable to
do so. A combination of pride, lust for power and a sense of
messianic mission prevented him. What Simon Leys has written of Mao's
China is equally true of Castro's Cuba: "Nations which do not have
the opportunity of getting rid of their geniuses are sometimes liable
to pay very dearly for the privilege of being led by them."</TE>
<TE>   Or as Bertolt Brecht put it: "Unhappy the nation that needs
heroes."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"In the Clear" is a howl. Steve Lopez probably overdoes the
hilariousness, but reading him is too much fun to notice, let alone
to mind.</LD>
<LD>   A Times columnist, Lopez introduces us to Albert La Rosa, sheriff
of a small town, Harbor Light, on the New Jersey shore, where
independent fishermen have been squeezed out by conglomerates and
where local storekeepers waste away, pressured by Bargain Acres,
which bills itself as the largest retail space under one roof in
North America.</LD>
<LD>   Bored from a diet of nothing-much-doing, Albert is middle-aged,
graying at the edges, tired round the eyes, weary of playing it safe.
Then he's offered a job as chief of security at a new casino to be
built in town and all hell breaks loose. The prospect of Atlantic
City moving in splits the little town. Albert's friends turn against
him. His father, proud owner of "La Rosa's Hardware &amp; More, Service
With Pride Since 1950," practically disowns him. The woman he planned
to marry, who runs an eatery, "Peg's As You Like It," named after her
mother, walks out on him.</LD>
<TE>   Shots are fired, cars blown up, Bargain Acres goes up in flames,
death threats and an actual death disrupt the sedative routine of
many years, upsetting Albert's plans, bringing in the FBI
(predictably ineffectual) and challenging his cop's instincts.</TE>
<TE>   The listless world of Harbor Light is vivified but threatened. So
is Albert. Will his sister's warning that there are no fresh starts
in life, just new opportunities to screw up, prove right? No chance.
Albert fends off both filthy lucre and his rutted groove to solve the
mysteries and live as a free spirit. The casino is fended off,
corporate retail recedes, the town revives. And Albert recaptures his
girl.</TE>
<TE>   "Courting Trouble" is Lisa Scottoline's latest romp and
demonstration of wordplay. Anne Murphy, a smart, good-looking
redheaded lawyer, has fled L.A. to get away from a murderous stalker,
Kevin Satorno. Neither a restraining order nor police helped protect
her when, at her door, the evil nut had pulled a gun on her.</TE>
<TE>   With Kevin in prison, but only for two years on a charge of
aggravated assault, Anne had put the country between them, changed
her life, changed jobs to an all-female law firm in Philadelphia
where she lives with Mel, a multipersonality cat. She's trying an
important case and doing well with it. Then Kevin escapes from
prison, and all's to do again.</TE>
<TE>   When a young woman who is cat-sitting Mel is cut down with a
sawed-off shotgun in Anne's unlighted hallway, police and the media
assume that the disfigured corpse is Anne. Anne lets them assume to
save her life as well as her job, because she doesn't want to fall
down on the case she's trying (her colleagues learn that Anne is
still very much alive and in the game): an allegation of sexual
harassment that could ruin her client.</TE>
<TE>   It's the Fourth of July weekend. Undermanned and overstretched,
Philadelphia police are not much help. It's left to Anne and her law
firm partners to run the erotomaniac into the ground. They do and
Kevin is disposed of; but silly Anne cannot "help wishing it hadn't
ended with such an awful death."</TE>
<TE>   She gets her wish, because things are not as simple as they
seem--all of which makes for a fast-moving and suspenseful thriller,
cheerful, charming, ditsy, a bit contrived, frequently funny and a
good read. Lots of detail about clothes, lots of detail about
interpersonal relations, lots of detail about details. If it weren't
un-PC to say so, I'd say it was a girl thing.</TE>
<TE>   Classicists among our readers should enjoy Jose Carlos Somoza's
"The Athenian Murders." They may even savor its scholarly apparatus:
the goofy, semi-spoofy footnotes that turn a mystery about mysteries
into a running maze of conundrums.</TE>
<TE>   In Athens in the 5th century BC, Tramachus, son of the widow Itys
("He was a boy.... His gaze was pure") is found in the night, mauled
as if by wolves. That's what the Athenian physician concludes, and
the captain of the Guard concurs. But the lad had been a student in
Plato's Academy and one of his teachers, Diagoras, not satisfied by
the dismissal of a victim whose "soul seemed as if burnished by
Athena herself," turns to a local detective: the short, fat
"Decipherer of Enigmas" Heracles Pontor, whose investigation draws
the two men into a noxious web of intrigue and leads to further
grisly killings of other youths, Tramachus' companions. No thanks to
his friends, Heracles winkles out the mystery and the louche
mysteries that surround it: Dionysian rituals, sacrificial cults,
torn-out hearts and the asininity of scholars.</TE>
<TE>   But "The Athenian Murders" is also a reworking of Euripides'
2,400-year-old "Bacchae," the post-classical takeoff of a gory play
in which an insistently rational Platonist and a positivist detective
face covert devotees of the god Dionysus, wonky worshipers and
dangerous fanatics all prey to infectious delusions that leave torn
corpses behind. So here's a fable for cognoscenti, a flummery that
you can take at face value (which is fun) or parse for allusions, a
fiction designed to show off the author's talents but one that, if
you read on, you won't forget.</TE>

<AU>JONATHAN KIRSCH</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Kirsch is a contributing writer to the Book
Review and the author, most recently, of "The Woman Who Laughed at
God: The Untold History of the Jewish People."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Less than 5% of the artists in the Modern Art Sections are women,"
proclaims a poster issued by an art collective called the Guerrilla
Girls in 1989, "but 85% of the nudes are female."</LD>
<LD>   A healthy corrective to the plight of women in the art world,
however, can be found in "Art/Women/California," an impressive and
illuminating survey of art by women in California during the last
half of the 20th century. The book offers more than 100 color plates
and black-and-white reproductions of artwork by female painters and
sculptors, photographers and videographers, performance artists and
installation artists.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the images are intentionally shocking and unsettling, some
are fanciful and lyrical, some are unashamed works of agitprop, and a
few are all of these at once. The artists reflect such diversity in
race, class and sexual orientation--and their artwork is so different
in style and theme--that it sometimes seems that the only thing they
have in common is the fact that they are women. Yet the editors and
the contributing essayists manage to find the commonalities in
experience and aspiration that bind the artists while, at the same
time, embracing "a sensibility that identifies and cherishes
differences."</LD>
<TE>   A wide-ranging collection of essays by about 20 scholars comment
upon and explain the art. Most of the essays are enlightening, even
if a few are encoded in the arcane language that art critics and
historians sometimes use. The art, however, always speaks for itself,
and thus allows us to understand what the essayists are trying to
say. "Spirit Catcher," for example, is a mixed-media assemblage by
Betye Saar, a Southern California native whose ancestry is European,
African and Native American. Her childhood experiences included
visits to her grandmother's home in Watts, where she saw Simon Rodia
at work on those monumental constructions of "found art" that survive
as the Watts Towers.</TE>
<TE>   When she started making art of her own in the 1960s, Saar followed
Rodia's example by fashioning armatures of wood and basketry and
embellishing them with stones, shells, bits of broken glass and other
objects, creating works of art that "refer to the spiritual
traditions of Haiti, Mexico, and Africa while also drawing on deep
resources of personal memory and experience." The result, as we see
in "Spirit Catcher," is a vaguely human form that looms as a kind of
modern totem.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the artists in "Art/Women/California" are visionaries who
"explored ways for making art unfettered by the male-dominated
aesthetics of the time," co-editor and co-curator Daniela Salvioni
explains, even if their work was "marginalized and relegated to the
status of curious asides in the official histories."</TE>
<TE>   Other artists, less revolutionary in style and intent, she adds,
"were often dismissed as feminized versions of the 'real' thing."
What set these artists free, according to the editors, were the
cultural upheavals of California in the '60s and, in particular, a
renewed militancy and sense of mission in the feminist movement.</TE>
<TE>   "Feminism," Salvioni insists, "forcefully made content, instead of
abstraction, art's essential and critical component."</TE>
<TE>   That point is illustrated, for example, by "Mattresses and Cakes,"
a 1993 work by Nancy Rubins in which the artist "molds the feminine
domestic raw materials into a threatening, bulging sculpture some
twenty feet high," writes essayist Laura Meyer, thus confronting the
viewer with "the storage (and threatened release) of terrific amounts
of energy."An example of art as political theater is found in a
conceptual art piece titled "Ready to Order?" by The Waitresses, a
group of performance artists who performed vignettes in various Los
Angeles restaurants in 1978 to dramatize the problems of women who
work in the food service industry, including issues of "work, food,
money, stereotypes of women, and sexual harassment."</TE>
<TE>   And sometimes the artist's message is both artful and forceful, as
in Yolanda M. Lopez's pen-and-ink drawing of a fierce Aztec warrior
in an "Uncle Sam Wants You" pose: The figure points at the viewer
with one hand, crumples a set of "Immigration Plans" in the other
hand, and demands of us: "Who's the illegal alien, PILGRIM?"</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, all of the artists whose work is presented and
scrutinized in "Art/Women/California," whether they are activists or
aesthetes, remind us that art has the power to change the way we
experience the world around us--and to thereby change the world.</TE>
<TE>   "Perhaps by reflecting on the myriad ways California women artists
and activists have urged us to disengage from those aspects of our
lives that we tend to take most for granted, and strive for new
social and psychic landscapes," urges Angela Y. Davis, one of the
contributing essayists, "we can begin to redefine the promise of
California." (The companion exhibit to the book is at the San Jose
Museum of Art through Nov. 3.)</TE>
<TE>   Ruth Harriet Louise, too, was a pioneering female artist in
California, but the medium that she chose was the "glamour shot."
When she joined Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1925 at the age of 22, she was
the only woman in Hollywood working as a chief studio photographer.
Over the next four years, until she lost the job to George Hurrell,
she created about 100,000 negatives--a vast archive of publicity
stills that were displayed in theater lobbies, mailed out to
clamoring fans and featured in the pages of movie magazines.</TE>
<TE>   "[I]n the uncharted cultural space that the movies were creating
for modern women, Louise was a crucial figure," insist Robert Dance
and Bruce Robertson, authors of "Ruth Harriet Louise and Hollywood
Glamour Photography." "Indeed, given the importance of the stars
Louise photographed, and the power and pervasiveness of the studio
she worked for, it is not going too far to say that Ruth Harriet
Louise was one of the most influential women photographers of the
century; more people have seen her images than those of any other
woman photographer."</TE>
<TE>   Often surprising and always fascinating, "Ruth Harriet Louise" is
a biography of Louise herself, a history of portrait photography in
the early years of the Hollywood studio system and a showcase for
some of her most accomplished work.</TE>
<TE>   Born Ruth Goldstein, the daughter of a New York rabbi, she aspired
to be a painter but settled for commercial portrait photography,
adopted a professional name and landed a job with MGM. Although her
career was brief, she played a decisive role in inventing an
important and enduring element of American culture.</TE>
<TE>   "No one can breathe [Hollywood's] atmosphere long and not be
profoundly conscious that some tremendous force is stirring here,"
wrote the young Louise on her arrival in Los Angeles. "It is for our
generation an almost incredible experience to watch the beginnings
and development of a wholly new art."</TE>
<TE>   Much of Louise's photography is solemn and highly stylized--a 1928
portrait of an unrecognizably young Joan Crawford resembles the
sacred art of ancient Egypt, and a 1926 shot of Norma Shearer is an
example of Art Deco come fully to life. A photograph of Lon Chaney in
circus regalia (a publicity still for "Laugh, Clown, Laugh") is
superficially comic, but it still conveys the blend of terror and
pathos for which he was famous.</TE>
<TE>   Her photographs of Greta Garbo are more various and inventive, but
no less iconic. Indeed, the authors point out that Louise's work with
Garbo amounts to the purest expression of the culture that she helped
to create: "the definitive image of Hollywood beauty and
glamour."(The exhibit "Ruth Harriet Louise and Hollywood Glamour
Photography" will be on display at the Santa Barbara Museum of Art
from July 27 to Oct. 6.)</TE>

<DH>Dave Barton's Rude Guerrilla Theater seeks hope as it
probes the dark side of humanity</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Dave Barton regrets that he spent his teens and early 20s putting up
a false front. That's one reason why he now devotes himself to
staging plays that frankly depict sex, brutality and the dark side of
the soul.</LD>
<LD>   During the past five years, the artistic director of the Rude
Guerrilla Theater Company in Santa Ana has earned a reputation--and
frequent critical acclaim--for taking audiences to the limit.</LD>
<LD>   The Rude aesthetic was on display in the company's recent West
Coast premiere of "Cleansed," by the late British playwright Sarah
Kane--a play largely made up of beatings, rapes, killings,
mutilations, extensive nudity and numerous bluntly portrayed sex
acts. It fit Barton's predilection for making audiences face the
darkest impulses in human nature--and his insistence that some vision
of tenderness and love be allowed to flower amid the bleakness. If a
play descends deep into darkness but not to the point of nihilism,
Barton is interested.</LD>
<TE>   "I've had people tell me that the ending of 'Cleansed' is very
depressing," he says. "But I look at it as very hopeful, because you
have these two people who have gone through hell together, wounded,
messed-up people who reach out to each other. What's more beautiful
than that?"</TE>
<TE>   Barton is 42. His big frame, ample belly, inelegant dress and
round, meaty face would be more stereotypical of a longshoreman than
an artiste. One of the most resonant experiences he ever had, he
says, came during the early 1980s, after that face had been multiply
fractured by a gang called the Suicidals during a punk rock show at
the Olympic Auditorium. He staggered to the bathroom, where Gary
Floyd, the hulking, Mohawked, ranting Marxist singer of the Dicks,
saw him and bathed his bloody face.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the most gentle, kindly act, and it was in such marked
contrast to what he sang onstage," Barton recalls. "My life seems to
revolve around these light and dark moments and the blending of the
two, and that's often why I'm attracted to the material that I am.
Horrible things happen to the characters, but there are some loving
moments in all of them."</TE>
<TE>   Barton credits punk rockers and existentialist philosophers with
delivering him from the trap he found himself in during his teens: "a
budding queer boy" closeted deep in fundamentalist Christianity.</TE>
<TE>   He grew up in Orange, where he still lives, the oldest of four
children of a police officer and a nurse. His mom found Jesus, and as
he entered his teens, Barton followed. At his Christian high school,
he targeted effeminate boys, hurling epithets, cracking jokes and
mocking them with a limp wrist.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a religious fanatic, sadly," he says. "And as a boy whose
sexuality was highly confused, I did my very best to find those who
were similarly confused and point the finger at them so people
wouldn't look at me. I'm very ashamed of that."</TE>
<TE>   He remains a Christian, but his abhorrence of fundamentalism
motivated him during the early 1990s as he became a founder of the
Orange County chapter of the confrontational anti-AIDS activist group
ACT UP. In 1991, Barton and three others disrupted a right-wing
Christian conference in Anaheim on "Preservation of the Heterosexual
Coalition." Barton read a passage from the New Testament about the
importance of love. He was arrested, tried and convicted of
disturbing the peace--drawing a $100 fine and a year of probation.</TE>
<TE>   Soon this veteran of politics-as-theater discovered theater as an
art form. After starting film studies at Orange Coast College in
Costa Mesa, he attended an evening of short plays on campus and was
struck by how free the student actors and directors were to explore
sexual themes and use uncensored language. Barton began taking
theater classes and directing plays.</TE>
<TE>   Rude Guerrilla debuted in 1997 with "In the House of the Lord," a
play about an abortion clinic held hostage by fundamentalists. Barton
was the director and co-writer, and he felt humiliated when the
critics drubbed it. But the company persisted, led by Barton and his
two contentious but loyal co-founders--Dawn Hess, a roofing company
owner who provided cash and set-building know-how, and Michelle
Fontenot, a former girlfriend of Barton's who made a point of
reconnecting with him years after they had broken up. "If there's a
way to ruffle people's feathers, he'll find it," Fontenot says. "He's
fully convinced that society doesn't feel anything, so if he can do
something to change that, he does."</TE>
<TE>   By its second season, Rude Guerrilla was earning strong reviews.
In 1999, it cemented its reputation as the edgiest performing arts
troupe in Orange County when Barton directed the West Coast premiere
of "Corpus Christi," Tony winner Terrence McNally's play envisioning
Jesus as a sexually active gay man. In 2001, Mark Ravenhill's
"Shopping and ..." pushed the envelope with its bleak, grisly and
sexually violent depiction of people reduced to commodities. It's all
enacted within a coin's toss of playgoers in Rude Guerrilla's 50-seat
Empire Theater.</TE>
<TE>   Audiences know what they are getting into, Rude Guerrilla's
founders say, so there are never walkouts. "Every once in a while
there's an image where people go, 'I wish you had never put that in
my head,' " Barton says. "But anything less than full brutality, full
sexuality, full vulgarity, even, is dishonest. I'm not interested in
soft-pedaling stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the fun of doing Rude Guerrilla Theater is hearing gasps
from the audience, says Jay Michael Fraley, a CalArts-trained actor
who has been a linchpin of many of the company's signature
productions. "It means they're into it, they're reacting. I enjoy
doing Neil Simon and knowing people have giggled and forgotten their
problems for two hours. The difference here is people may go home and
talk about it for two days."</TE>
<TE>   Barton's obsessions are Rude Guerrilla's trademark, but he only
directs two or three shows each year; most of what the company
presents in its nine-play seasons does not involve the baring or
mangling of flesh.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Provocative' has lots of different meanings," says Sharyn Case,
who has directed three Rude Guerrilla plays with no nudity or graphic
violence. "Dave's vision is what has guided the theater to what it
is, but he lets me pretty much have my head. He's far too
intellectual to do anything strictly for shock value."</TE>
<TE>   Recent Rude Guerrilla productions have included Howard Korder's
"Search and Destroy" and Yasmina Reza's "Art," both previously seen
at South Coast Repertory. Christopher Durang's "Sister Mary Ignatius
Explains It All for You" opens July 26; the season also includes the
West Coast premiere in September of Ping Chong's "Truth &amp; Beauty." In
November, Barton will direct the sexually explicit "Sleeping Around,"
written by four British playwrights including Ravenhill.</TE>
<TE>   The only thing that seems to make Barton and his co-founders
squeamish is the very thing Rude Guerrilla must do in order to grow.</TE>
<TE>   "Isn't it weird?" business manager Fontenot asks. "We show naked
people [simulating sex] onstage, and we're too meek to ask for money.
It's really pathetic, but it's true."</TE>
<TE>   At present, she says, Rude Guerrilla spends just $35,000 a year
and rarely is able to budget more than $1,000 per play for props,
costumes and stage sets. Actors used to earn $5 for each performance,
but the non-Equity company had to rescind that pittance last fall
when its rent went up. Barton says pay for actors will resume when
Rude Guerrilla can secure an operating cushion of $10,000. Even in
lean times, the company contributes 10% of each production's net
proceeds to a charity chosen by the show's director or suggested by
the play's theme. The donation usually comes to about $300.</TE>
<TE>   Barton, who earns his living as a technician for an electronics
company in Cypress, says his combination of Christian and socialist
values makes him leery of wealth and constitutionally incapable of
asking for money. Others in the 30-member company are trying to take
on that job.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're going to be visionary, you've got to grow, and to grow,
you've got to have money," says actor Fraley, who serves on the
nonprofit troupe's board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   Given its edgy mission, Barton doubts that Rude Guerrilla ever can
grow to inhabit more than a 150- or 200-seat house. He would like to
bring a production to L.A. someday.</TE>
<TE>   "If I couldn't eventually run a theater full time and actually
make a living off of it, I think I'd like to work for the post
office," he says. "I love the idea of being able to wear shorts every
day if I want to, working outside in the sun and fresh air. And I'm
already disgruntled, so I'd fit right in."</TE>

<LD>Come All Ye: "Sabbatum" is a tribute album to the perennial metal
band Black Sabbath, but there's a twist. The 12 songs are sung in
Latin, with medieval arrangements.</LD>
<LD>   The Court Jester: Mihkel Raud, 33, record producer and president
of Beg the Bug Records in Estonia, is the brain behind the concept.
He first heard Black Sabbath 15 years ago after his dad smuggled the
English band's early-'70s records into Estonia, then part of the
Soviet Union.</LD>
<LD>   "I'll never forget when I first heard the band," he says. "The
music was not like any of the pop or rock music I had heard before. I
always wondered what they would sound like if the music was played
with medieval instruments."</LD>
<TE>   M&amp;M: For whatever reason, Raud says, metal and medieval music are
very popular in Estonia. "After years of flirting with the idea about
putting Sabbath to medieval music, I finally did something about it
about two years ago. I asked around the medieval scene to find out
who might be the one to approach about my idea. The name Rondellus
kept coming up."</TE>
<TE>   The Minstrels: Rondellus, also from Estonia, is a five-piece
ensemble that is well known in the Baltic states, Scandinavia and
elsewhere in Europe. Besides, "Sabbatum" ("Sabbath" in Latin), the
band has three other albums out. However, don't expect any AC/DC
songs. It's strictly medieval and renaissance music on those
collections.</TE>
<TE>   A Natural Transition: "They thought I was crazy," says Raud of his
first meeting with the band. "But after listening to the songs, they
began to see my vision. The chords, the keys, the transitions, even
the Latin, all seemed to cross over very well. We all agreed Sabbath
would have been at home in the 1300s."</TE>
<TE>   Ozzy and Beyond? Raud says he has sent copies to all four original
band members, but has yet to hear from Sabbath's most famous member,
singer Ozzy Osbourne. "He's probably too busy with touring and his
hit TV show," the producer speculates.</TE>
<TE>   Where Art Thou? The album is available at www.sabbatum.com. Or, if
you're in the area, at Estonia's finer record stores.</TE>

<LD>More than a dozen women, many cloaked in mantillas or fingering
rosaries, hover behind several rows of straight-back wooden chairs.
Their faces are a rainbow of skin hues, their shapes and sizes as
various as their ages.</LD>
<LD>   Suddenly, a young woman in a peasant skirt bursts into the room.
As the others turn to watch her, she throws herself on the ground in
an erotic lamentation. "You won't be lifting my skirts behind the
barn door anymore," she moans, writhing prone on the floor. "Your
warm rough fingers will never trail and map my inner thighs.... Of
all who served you, family or maid, bet you didn't know, I was the
one who loved you most of all."</LD>
<LD>   A stern matriarch draped in black enters, glaring at the servant.
"Silence!" she intones.</LD>
<TE>   The conflict about to unfold takes place in Federico Garcia
Lorca's "The House of Bernarda Alba," which opens Thursday at the
Mark Taper Forum, directed by Lisa Peterson and starring Chita
Rivera.</TE>
<TE>   Yet theatergoers who know "Bernarda Alba," the drama of a widow
who decrees that her five daughters will mourn their father for eight
years, may not recall this scene. That's because it wasn't in the
original. It is part of a new adaptation, by playwright Chay Yew. And
therein lies a world of difference.</TE>
<TE>   The servant who had neither name nor much stage time has become
Blanca, a character who figures more prominently and is about 30
years younger than in the original. The result is a heightening of
the play's sexuality and class politics.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia Lorca "had her but didn't use her," Yew says. "By adding
the servant class, I'm adding someone who could talk about sex in a
visceral way. I went with Blanca because I felt she had a delicious
longing, and I understand that. As someone who grew up in
authoritarian Singapore and as a gay man, oppression is second nature
to me. I understand it sexually and racially."</TE>
<TE>   The aim of adaptation is to make classics speak more directly to
contemporary audiences. It can also be a way for artists like Yew to
insinuate themselves into a tradition that has long relegated them to
the margins, staking a claim to the greatest texts in the history of
the Western stage.</TE>
<TE>   "I came from a place where we had to do white plays because that's
the thing that you do," says the personable 36-year-old Yew,
referring to his upbringing in Singapore. He moved to California in
the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   He is seated in his office at the Mark Taper Forum, where he is an
associate artist and director of the Asian Theater Workshop. Two
walls of the tiny room are plastered with a dizzying sea of
postcards, with a purple feather boa tacked on top of it all, a
bright slash of artful impudence.</TE>
<TE>   "Now there's a way to do a classic play by claiming it as your
own," continues Yew, who's writing an adaptation of Anton Chekhov's
"The Cherry Orchard." "I can have this cross-culture international
collaboration with Mr. Lorca and Mr. Chekhov. Just as new works are
important, it should also be important to see the old ones in
contrast and in a new context."</TE>
<TE>   A look at who's adapting classics these days shows it's not the
old boys' club anymore. The majority are people of color, women, gay,
disabled or otherwise "other" voices. For theaters that have
struggled for more than a decade to include a greater range of
artists, this provides a convenient compromise. Producing adaptations
by writers like Yew can satisfy the imperatives of diversity without
scaring off the more conservative audience members, as happened
during the peak of multicultural programming in the early '90s.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the situation raises as many questions as it answers. "Is the
reason why all these young playwrights are doing adaptations because
they can't get some other work produced in the regional theater?"
asks Yew. "I think the problem is not only with works by writers of
color, but also new plays."</TE>
<TE>   Playwright Luis Alfaro, a former MacArthur Foundation "genius"
grant recipient and co-director of the Taper's Latino Theatre
Initiative, states the problem even more bluntly. "If you're a
straight white guy, you don't have to write an adaptation to get
produced, right?" he asks. "So it is by necessity that you start to
look at these things."</TE>
<TE>   With careers that were given a kick-start by the multiculturalism
movement of the late 1980s and '90s, artists like Yew and Alfaro are
hitting a glass ceiling. Branded in part by an early success
predicated on works that focused on the identity politics of being
gay and nonwhite, they're having a tough time breaking out of that
pigeonhole, even though their writing has since broadened its focus.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's no big secret that doing an adaptation came to me at
a time when, as an artist, I've been thinking a lot about how I get
to the next level," says Alfaro, whose "Electricidad," an adaptation
of Sophocles' "Electra," will be given a workshop at South Coast
Repertory this summer. (His one act "The Gardens of Aztlan [An Acto
Hecho a Mano]" can be seen at the theater's Hispanic Playwright
Project starting Saturday.) "I'm 40. How do I get produced in the
regional theater, and how are they looking at Latino work?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking at what people are relating to, and adaptation just
seemed right politically," continues Alfaro, recently named associate
producer of new play development at the Taper. "I wish I wasn't so
cynical about it myself, but of course you see it and think this is a
way in through that big weird door."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the situation may be symptomatic of a malaise even more
profound than the multicultural glass ceiling. "People are
adaptation-mad right now because they hate and fear new ideas, and
new writing especially," says Philip Littell, whose
translation-adaptation of Georges Feydeau's "He Hunts" was
commissioned and staged at the Geffen Playhouse this season, directed
by David Schweizer. "It's as if a collective nausea has hit the
performing arts about this."</TE>
<TE>   In Garcia Lorca's 1936 "The House of Bernarda Alba," each
frustrated daughter finds her own way of enduring the mother's
punishing edict, but not without tragic consequences. Although it's
more realistic than Garcia Lorca's other dramas, it is fundamentally
a work of poetry, written in verse rife with symbolism.</TE>
<TE>   Both the sexuality and the lyricism would seem to make it an
interesting fit with Yew, whose works, including "Red," "Wonderland"
and "A Language of Their Own," have received praise for their poetic
elements. Seen at such prestigious venues as London's Royal Court
Theatre, New York's Public Theater and La Jolla Playhouse, Yew has
also been staged locally at the Celebration Theatre and East West
Players, where he has also directed.</TE>
<TE>   When the National Asian American Theatre Company, a 66-seat venue
in Manhattan, approached him, it was not to adapt, but to direct
"Bernarda Alba." He ended up both writing the adaptation and
directing it in late 2000. Because it was for an Asian company, Yew
chose "to take out the Spanish content," he says. "So what I did was
fit it in between, in the Philippines."</TE>
<TE>   That location was in Yew's direction, not in the text. "What we're
doing is saying it's Spain, but we're inspired by Arab-Andalusian
art," explains Taper resident director Peterson. "I cast it
multiethnically because I wanted to treat the play as if it were a
Greek play or a Shakespeare as opposed to a realistic family drama."</TE>
<TE>   Peterson, who has staged several of Yew's plays, was the driving
force behind getting the Taper to produce "Bernarda Alba." "I liked
the tension between Chay's rhythms and the force of the rough,
large-size emotion that's happening in Lorca's play," she says. "It's
the most radical adaptation of this play that I know of. The language
is quite spare and rough, and the sexuality is more extreme."</TE>
<TE>   In spirit, Yew feels he is being faithful to Garcia Lorca. "I had
read that Lorca wanted 100 women on stage, and of course no theater
company can do that," he says. "But that became the aesthetic for my
play, to have many women on stage to create the community, always
watching."</TE>
<TE>   The result is a melding of two sensibilities. "I began to
understand the characters more by diving into my own life, which is
strange because who am I to identify with women? And then I realized
that Lorca was a man, he was gay and he was an exile to some extent,
like I am.</TE>
<TE>   "I decided to go into the play, and of course this gay thing came
out and this Asian thing came out," Yew continues. "I understood how
these women were fiery. I have that, but I demonstrate it very
differently. I think the play still lends itself to big feelings, but
I like it a little more pressurized."</TE>
<TE>   There was also pressure from the Garcia Lorca estate. Yew found
out, to his chagrin, that he'd have to pay $3,000 for the rights to
do the adaptation again. "I was laughing because this is the first
time I paid to work on a play," he says. "So, to all aspiring
playwrights, if you want to adapt something, make sure the play is in
public domain!"</TE>
<TE>   As happy an occasion as it is for Yew's work to make it to the
main stage of the Taper, there's some irony that it happened with
"Bernarda Alba." After seven years on staff at the downtown house,
he's finally reaching this theatrical high ground, not with a play of
his own, but with an adaptation.</TE>
<TE>   This fact hasn't escaped notice among his peers. "I want to feel
positive, so I try not to go there," Alfaro says. "But looking at the
body of his work, it's the moment when Chay is least vocal about his
sexuality that he's most present for most people."</TE>
<TE>   Personal politics may still be present, but the less overt they
are, the better the script's chances. "When I tell my story--the gay
Latino Luis--my story is not that interesting to theaters that have
to fill certain seats," Alfaro says. "We know now, as people of color
working in these mainstream theaters, they don't want to hear that
story."</TE>
<TE>   Call it the latest plateau in the long climb toward diversity in
the arts.</TE>
<TE>   Multiculturalism hit L.A. in the late 1980s and lasted, full
throttle, into the mid-'90s, when the sentiments, institutional
practices and granting policies of major national arts funders began
to shift.</TE>
<TE>   In large regional theaters, it drove changes in staffing,
programming and audience cultivation and spawned the kind of
development labs that remain a cornerstone of the Taper's
bureaucracy. These include the Asian Theatre Workshop that Yew heads
and the Latino Theatre Initiative, co-directed by Alfaro and
performer-director Diane Rodriguez, which was launched in 1993 with a
$1.47-million grant from the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund. Other
Taper labs include Blacksmyths for African American writers, and the
Other Voices Project for disabled theater artists.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-'90s, however, the tide began to roll back. Critical
response was increasingly negative and, while new theatergoers were
courted, there was a kind of "white flight" among subscribers.
Artists began to chafe at some of the politically correct excesses,
particularly in the areas of casting and commissioning, which
demanded that, for instance, Latino-themed plays be cast exclusively
with artists with Latino surnames.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Alfaro and Yew had gained a beachhead within the
institutions. But their charge was to nurture the work of upcoming
writers, and they often had to turn to smaller theaters to see their
own work produced.</TE>
<TE>   Now, they're looking for new ways to work within the system.
Alfaro had a commission from South Coast Rep for a long time before
he decided to submit his adaptation. "I've written three plays since
I got it, but they were all things that I just never thought they
would do," he says. But with "Electricidad," "there was definitely
the sense that I was writing toward a larger audience."</TE>
<TE>   Written in Spanglish, "Electricidad" was created during a
residency with Borderlands theater in Tucson. "There was an incident
that happened as soon as I got there, involving girl gangs, with a
mother and daughter involved in killing people," Alfaro says. "So I
started thinking about Clytemnestra and Electra."</TE>
<TE>   Just as Alfaro chose to infuse the Greek text with a Chicano
sensibility, others have chosen to use their personal vantage points
to recast classics.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly Stuart, 41, adapted Aeschylus' Oresteia trilogy at the
behest of San Diego's Sledgehammer Theatre, where it was produced in
2000. "I was struck by how blatantly hostile the Oresteia was to
women," Stuart says. "I decided I wanted to highlight exactly what
was being said, because I felt that the message gets obscured under a
lot off puffery and macho heroism in modern adaptations. In a sense
you could say that I attacked Aeschylus as much as adapted him."</TE>
<TE>   John Belluso, 32, is the co-director, along with Victoria Ann
Lewis, of the Taper's Other Voices Project. "Eyolf," his adaptation
of Henrik Ibsen's "Little Eyolf," about a partially paralyzed boy and
his resentful mother, was recently given a reading at the Manhattan
Theatre Club.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason that I was drawn to this particular play is it
contains within it a fascinating narrative about disability, and I
saw it therefore as part of my overall project of examining
disability on stage," says Belluso, whose "The Body of Bourne" was
seen at the Taper in 2001 and whose "Gretty Goodtime" will be staged
at the Falcon Theatre in Burbank this spring.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my direct experience as a disabled man that allows me to add
a new dimension to these characters," says the writer, who's now
working on an adaptation of Sophocles' "Philoctetes." But "I
definitely don't think it's my place as a writer to 'correct the
mistakes' that Ibsen made in representing a disabled character."</TE>
<TE>   Philip Littell, best known for his librettos for the operas "The
Dangerous Liaisons" and "A Streetcar Named Desire," is a veteran
performer and translator-adaptor. Now 52, he moved back to New York
in 1999, after spending most of 23 years in L.A., where he also
created a number of provocative original works, including his and
Eliot Douglass' "The Wandering Whore," a chamber musical about "the
birth of the gay world" in London's criminal milieu, circa 1700.</TE>
<TE>   It's as though Littell has financed his original works with his
adaptations, having had major commissions from a wide range of other
sources, including Disney, which had him create text for Michael
Torke's millennium symphony "Four Seasons," for the New York
Philharmonic, and an equestrian Zorro show for Euro Disneyland. "I
guess I'm an adapting fool, but I still consider it a very minor
percentage of my activity," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, it's still artistic attraction that determines which
projects he tackles. "Feydeau is perfect, the greatest farce writer
ever, and his work is also disturbing and destructive ... of values,
which I really admire," says Littell, whose rendition of the late
19th century French playwright's work has a pointedly contemporary
edge.</TE>
<TE>   Following Littell's lead, Alfaro is also ready to do more
adapting, possibly of a Thornton Wilder or Tennessee Williams play.
"I can't wait to get my hands on something else," he says. "Now I
want to do 'Nuestro Town.' Or a Chicano adaptation of 'Summer and
Smoke.' "</TE>
<TE>   As for Yew, his version of "The Cherry Orchard"--moved to China,
with Mao Tse-tung's long march passing through--was given a workshop
in the Singapore Arts Festival in June. "Chekhov and Lorca were great
indirect mentors, and I learned much more about myself as a
playwright," he says. "Ultimately, the lesson about adapting is, what
about my plays? Can I see them 4,000 years from now, and if not, why
not?"</TE>
<TE>   Such questions are not merely personal, but a matter of the future
of the art form. "The real question to ask of an adaptation is
probably the same one that has always been asked: Do we need it and
can it change our lives and affect the development of our future
work?" says Littell. "It's a question that needs an unequivocal yes."</TE>

<TE>   First-prize winner at the 1997 Queen Elisabeth Competition in
Brussels, Nikolaj Znaider brings a fervent, full and rich tone to
Prokofiev's bittersweet, reluctant farewell to 19th century
Romanticism. The Andante soars as Znaider ranges from almost ethereal
pianissimos to strong-bodied presence. Unfortunately, the young
violinist is more perfunctory in the Glazunov Concerto. It may not be
the greatest music, but it has many grand and tuneful moments and the
last movement ought to be a joyful romp, which it isn't here.
Tchaikovsky originally planned the Meditation, which is album filler
here, as the slow movement of the Concerto in D, but the dedicatee
soloist talked him out of it because of its length (10 minutes) and
moodiness. Znaider plays it lyrically, but it remains minor
Tchaikovsky. Throughout, Jansons is an alert and sensitive
collaborator.</TE>

<TE>   Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Chorus,</TE>
<TE>   Robert Spano, conductor</TE>
<TE>   Telarc</TE>
<TE>   This vast choral work based on Walt Whitman poems is one of the
most imposing first symphonies ever written. The ecstatic opening
minutes alone--with the cry of "Behold, the sea itself" punctuated by
a depth-charged orchestral chord--stamp it as a great work, even
though the inspiration doesn't always reach this high later on. Sir
Adrian Boult used to own this piece--and as Spano hurries through the
first movement's proclamations, you miss the massive emotional effect
that Boult could create just by slowing down at the right climactic
points. Nor is Telarc's sound, though impressive on the stereo CD
version, as detailed and spacious as EMI's engineering on Boult's and
Haitink's recordings. Yet Spano does have a better chorus, sporting
clearer diction; his soloists are excellent; and with his energetic
conducting, he frequently makes a thrilling impression with this
score.</TE>

<TE>   Bell's playing of these familiar masterpieces is handsome,
reserved and able, but missing that element of passion that would
make them definitive. These performances are strong but they aren't
memorable. One must, however, admire the inventiveness shown in
Bell's new cadenza to the first movement of the Mendelssohn piece; it
lights up this recording. The violinist also creates viable,
attractive, if over-the-top cadenzas in the Beethoven concerto.
Norrington and the ensemble aid modestly.</TE>

<TE>   Harmonia Mundi</TE>
<TE>   Here's an ingratiating cross-genre experiment that can be placed
either on the early music shelf or in the world-music department.
Lawrence-King has revived a setting of the Latin Mass by the
Spanish-born, 17th century Mexican composer Juan Gutierrez de
Padilla, prefacing each section with Latin American or African folk
dances from the period. Most of the dances--some by Padilla, most
from other sources--with the Harp Consort's voices backed by a
battery of Mexican guitars and percussion instruments--are a lot of
fun, often highly rhythmic, almost contemporary sounding, and they
make the actual Mass seem a bit staid. Yet the experiment
accomplishes its purpose: You can hear the rhythms of the dances
echoed in portions of the Mass.</TE>

<TE>   Shostakovich composed these lesser known songs and arrangements
during the 1950s, when once again he was on the outs with Soviet
officialdom. The style is deliberately simple in order to make them
accessible to the working masses. Many are quite lovely. Still,
there's a world of difference between the banal "The Motherland
Hears" (later made famous when pioneering cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin sang
it--badly--as he circled the Earth) and the weighty settings of four
bitter and ominous texts by Pushkin. Songs to lyrics by E.
Dolmatovsky vary from cute to catchy. The arrangements of six Spanish
songs are irresistible. But the arrangements of four Greek songs show
heroic sinew, backbone and spirit. The vocal soloists, from various
Russian universities and opera houses, aren't world-class, but they
do a respectable job, as does pianist Yuri Serov. Half the works are
billed as world-premiere recordings; the others are first CD
recordings.</TE>

<TE>   In 10 excerpts from "Siegfried" and "The Twilight of the Gods,"
Pappano conducts some mightily impressive Wagner playing from the
virtuosic Covent Garden orchestra. The tenor's singing is solid and
accomplished. By now, Domingo must be counted a Wagnerian, because he
has been singing the German composer for more than a decade. But live
or on recordings, he does not convince those listeners who expect
Wagnerian amplitude and size. Intelligent, informed and musical he
remains; the rest must be supplied by the listener's imagination. In
these excerpts, he has good colleagues: Violeta Urmana as the
"Twilight" Brunnhilde, Natalie Dessay as the Voice of the Forest-Bird
and, most strongly, David Cangelosi as Mime. Pappano conducts with
ear-opening authority.</TE>

<TE>   Simon Rattle, conductor</TE>
<TE>   EMI Classics</TE>
<TE>   This recording does as much justice as any to the impossibly large
forces--400 singers and instrumentalists--Schoenberg calls for in
this wild, strange, unruly score that occupied him for 13 years. The
composer starts out by outdoing Wagner in Romantic extravagance but
ends by kissing that 19th century style goodbye. Rattle's passion and
control are evident in the score's delicacy and finesse as well as
its roof-rattling climaxes. All the soloists succumb to some strain
in singing over the orchestra. Thomas Moser is less taxed than most
tenors in the leather-lung role of Waldemar. Karita Mattila is a
creamy, seductive Tove. Anne Sofie von Otter is a luscious Wood Dove.
Philip Langridge provides much needed ironic relief as Klaus the
Jester. Thomas Quasthoff (both Peasant and Speaker) is rich-voiced,
but occasionally buried by the orchestra. The combined choirs sound
distantly placed. A short, bonus CD provides expanded answers to
questions addressed to Rattle in the program booklet. C.P.</TE>

<TE>   Hailed by some after his last-minute substitution for Luciano

recording of 14 familiar arias. The vocal gift is exceptional, but
Licitra's accomplishment meager and unpolished. He sings well some of
the time, hits a few impressive high notes on occasion, but the only
thrills come from his inconsistency. He seems for the most part
unburdened by either musicality or intelligence. D.C.</TE>

<DH>In the third section of a Smithsonian survey, black
photographers go into critical mode</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In Todd Gray's "Odysseus," a writhing black male nude is bound with
ropes, and enveloped in shadows and odd polemical texts. Bill
Gaskins' "Tireka and Tamana, Easter Sunday, Baltimore, Maryland"
features two self-assured young women whose formidable coiffures
glisten like towers of plaited licorice. In "A Virtuous Negro's
Head," Carla Williams reveals that beauty simultaneously exists as
fact and mystery. And the toughs in Dennis Callwood's "Signs/Signos:
In Their Own Words" series stare out, tight-mouthed and remorseless,
in portraits crowded with chatter, in the form of tattoos, stylized
confessionals and gangland calligraphy.</LD>
<LD>   These are but a few of the images of modern African American life
depicted in an exhibition of photography that opened Saturday at the
Luckman Gallery on the campus of Cal State L.A.</LD>
<TE>   Subtitled "A History Deconstructed," the Luckman show is the third
and culminating section of the Smithsonian Institution's survey of
African American photography, "Reflections in Black: A History of
Black Photographers 1840 to the Present." Based on a book by Deborah
Willis, a New York University photography professor and former
curator of collections at the Smithsonian Institution's Center for
African American History and Culture, the survey opened in 2000, with
300 images in all. "A History Deconstructed" represents works from
1980 through 2000, including 70 images from 35 artists.</TE>
<TE>   The book and the survey got their start when Willis was an
undergraduate at the Philadelphia College of Art (now the University
of the Arts). "I grew up in a family of photographers," Willis says,
"but I was really concerned that there were no African American
photographers in my history books. We only knew of blacks as
struggling, as running away from slavery and as survivors. But there
had to be another story. I decided to do a research paper for my
history class. Where were the other photographers? That was 25 years
ago. And that's how I began this work."</TE>
<TE>   The survey looked at photographers at the very beginning of the
medium's history. In another section, it followed African American
photography through the civil rights era, from the 1940s through the
1970s.</TE>
<TE>   But, Willis says, the photographers in the third part of the
survey, which makes up the Luckman show, are different from the
documentarians, commercial photographers and photojournalists who
came before them. They have been trained in art school and
transformed by the culture of hip-hop, among other phenomena. Their
collected works can be viewed as both a critique and a demolition of
stereotypical motifs.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically these artists are looking at the past and
deconstructing and reconstructing contemporary experiences," Willis
said by phone from her New York studio. "They use symbolism and
expressive ways of telling stories, as Willie Middlebrook does with
the body, and the same with Todd Gray, where he's looking at the male
figure and writing on it."</TE>
<TE>   The images are broken into five categories: "Street Photography
and Cultural Landscape," "The Constructed Image," "Portraits,"
"Landscapes" and "Digital Imagery." Some of the photographs have been
altered, cropped, torn or otherwise manipulated, and they resemble
paintings, sculptures, collages or mixed-media works.</TE>
<TE>   "They all start off with a camera, with film and with darkrooms. I
see photography as being constructed, or abstracted," she explains,
"but it is first and foremost a photographic image."</TE>
<TE>   Middlebrook, one of 11 Los Angeles-based artists included in the
Luckman collective, is represented by a 20-by-24-inch self-portrait,
part of a series he began a decade ago while in a 30-day residence at
the Light Works photography program in upstate New York. "I wanted to
show that I could come up with an image that, one, has color, and
two, looks very painterly," Middlebrook said. "Using no gimmicks, no
computers, no double exposures, just me and a black-and-white
negative, paper, chemicals and darkroom."</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Callwood, another L.A. artist, collaborates with graffiti
taggers and gang members--he takes photos, they add color and text to
the images in a process that has been dubbed photo-fusion. The series
began when he was teaching photography to incarcerated gang kids.</TE>
<TE>   He kept forgetting their street nicknames. "So I decided why don't
I just give the kid the photograph and let him put his name on it,"
Callwood said. "I gave a photograph to one kid and he jerked it out
of my hand and started writing on it. When I saw the writing, it
flashed in my head that the aesthetic of the graffiti and the
aesthetic of fine arts photography went together. That's when
everything started to evolve."</TE>
<TE>   Gray, who also adds text and draws on his photographs, sees his
work as dealing with the theme of "otherness."</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the images are from Greek mythology and some of the
drawings that I do on them refer to African mythology or icons. The
third component is myself, which is the written word. I get myself in
a state of what the Surrealists called automatic writing, and I just
literally attack the photograph. I have an idea of what I want to
say, but how I say it is very direct and unconscious."</TE>
<TE>   Originally, Los Angeles was slated to be a host of the historical
sections of the Smithsonian show. "It was supposed to be at the
California African-American Museum in June 2002," Willis said. "It
was canceled because the museum is under construction. I was very
disappointed."</TE>
<TE>   Cal State L.A. stepped in in the spring of 2000. CSULA photography
professor Donald Bernard (whose work is in "A History Deconstructed")
suggested it to Clifford Harper, executive director of the Luckman
Fine Arts Complex, and gallery director Julie Joyce. They got funding
help from the Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department, but they
couldn't afford--or find space for--the entire exhibition.</TE>
<TE>   Just taking one part of it has been a challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "The show is so large, we are sharing it with the gallery in the
fine arts department on campus," Joyce said. Both spaces will provide
maps and signs to link the two exhibition sites. According to Joyce,
showing the contemporary section of "Reflections in Black" was a
logical choice for the Luckman.</TE>
<TE>   "It coincides with the thrust of the gallery programs," she said,
"which has primarily comprised contemporary work from the 1960s
onward." It was also fitting, she said, that many of the
photographers were from Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   These days, Willis is spending time as a photographer as well as a
curator, along with her teaching. In 2000 she was named a MacArthur
fellow, and she and Carla Williams have finished a book, "The Black
Female Body in Photography," which includes their work and the work
of other photographers.</TE>
<TE>   She still sees "Reflections in Black" as a crucial accomplishment.</TE>
<TE>   "The importance of the show is its sense of normalcy," she says.
"This is a history that has been neglected, overlooked. And this is a
story that shows that the American experience is mainly
transformative. Not for just blacks, but for whites, for Asians, for
people who have entered this country voluntarily and involuntarily.
It tells a story about a people that's not one story, but a
culmination of many stories."</TE>

<LD>American Movie Classics observed its 10th anniversary by issuing a
colorful poster to celebrate "Ten Years of Dedication to the
Classics." Decorating the poster were pictures of Cary Grant, Audrey
Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe, Charlie Chaplin, Ingrid Bergman, Gary Cooper
and the outlet's genial host, Bob Dorian, as well as a banner
headline proclaiming: "Entering Its 10th Year, Cable's American Movie
Classics Remains a Movie Fan's Best Friend."</LD>
<LD>   For nearly 14 years, AMC was one of my best friends. It was the
place to go to see uncut, uninterrupted classics, from Katharine
Hepburn's first film, 1932's "Bill of Divorcement," to Marilyn Monroe
and Laurence Olivier in 1957's "The Prince and the Showgirl." Not
only was the schedule chockablock full of golden oldies, but Dorian,
an actor, was folksy and funny--the heart and soul of AMC.</LD>
<TE>   The cable channel, now nearly 20 years old, also produced
award-winning specials that profiled such stars of yesteryear as Roy
Rogers and Gene Autry, and explored intriguing topics, including
early women directors and the Hollywood blacklist. Its first original
dramatic series, "Remember WENN," was a sweet, nostalgic look at the
heyday of radio that had a small but devoted following. And for the
past nine years, AMC has held film preservation festivals to educate
movie fans on the necessity of restoring and preserving vintage films
and to raise funds for the nation's film archives.</TE>
<TE>   Over the past few years, however, the joy has gone out of the
network. Truth be told, I have only watched one movie on AMC this
year--the 1955 Jimmy Stewart drama, "Strategic Air Command," on
Independence Day.</TE>
<TE>   AMC has changed radically, and it's going to change even more. A
few years ago, it began showing commercials between films, adding
"intermissions" during its movies last October. Granted, the network
interrupts a film only once, but it's disheartening to see ads for
Paxil in between watching Stewart romance June Allyson.</TE>
<TE>   Dorian is now retired and lives in South Carolina, and the much
younger, competent, but far less charismatic John Burke has replaced
him. Although AMC continues to run films from the '30s, '40s and
'50s, more and more contemporary films from the '80s and '90s like
"The Deer Hunter," "Brubaker," "Next Stop, Greenwich Village," "The
Verdict" and "Grand Canyon" have been creeping into the schedule, and
are in heavy rotation on the network.</TE>
<TE>   Because AMC is basic cable, it has to show the "director approved"
TV-edited versions of these films in prime time. Not only are nudity
and language edited out of the R-rated fare, even PG films such as
the 1972 "Sleuth" have been edited for content and time. Yet recent
specials have such sensationalized titles as "Sins of Hollywood" and
"Shirtless: Hollywood's Sexiest Men." The 10th annual film
preservation festival set for September will also be
contemporized--concentrating on rock movies of the '70s.</TE>
<TE>   AMC is owned and managed by the Long Island, N.Y.-based Rainbow
Media Holdings Inc. The company did the same turnabout with Bravo.
That network began as a premium cable outlet for foreign and art
films and arts programming, then started editing films for content
when it went basic and slowly introduced commercials with the
unveiling of more and more original programming. Rainbow's WE:
Women's Entertainment network also now shows commercials; only
Rainbow's Independent Film Channel has remained commercial-free. So
far.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in October, AMC will add more contemporary titles to its
playlist and offer more original programming designed to appeal to a
"younger, broader audience." Theses changes will also coincide with
an increase in commercials, although admittedly far fewer than most
basic cable networks. To satisfy older viewers, the network is
spinning off a digital, commercial-free outlet, AMC's Hollywood
Classics, that will air the movies that used to be the network's
mainstay.</TE>
<TE>   Kate McEnroe, president of AMC Networks, didn't seem very upset
when I told her I was no longer watching the network. "You'll have to
watch Hollywood Classics," she said matter-of-factly. Addressing the
changes at AMC, she explained: "What happened is time has moved
forward. This has been an evolution, not a revolution. What I like to
say is no brand is immortal. Even the Wall Street Journal had to get
their act together and reformat."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe so, but I'm not the only one upset by AMC's changes. Several
friends and co-workers also have abandoned the network. Producer
Peter Jones, grandson of old-time movie star Conrad Nagel, shares my
opinion of the revamped AMC. "It's awful," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jones worked for AMC for roughly seven years, producing snappy,
fun features about old Hollywood. They parted company in 1994, and he
currently produces episodes of A&amp;E's "Biography" series and
documentaries for Turner Classic Movies, the 8-year-old nostalgia
channel that has remained commercial-free.</TE>
<TE>   In trying to reach a younger crowd, Jones said, "they have sadly
dumbed-down their product. Everything they said they would never do
they have done. Do you remember several years ago when they said
'unedited and commercial free'? ... I think when you try to alter
your identity so much, you really run the risk of annihilating
yourself because you are not standing on the principles that defined
you."</TE>
<TE>   At least among film buffs, the changes at AMC have doubtless been
a boon to its principal rival, Turner Classic Movies. Whereas AMC has
to purchase films from various studios, TCM has the pick of the great
Turner library of MGM titles plus pre-1948 Warner Bros. releases. For
years, friends taped movies for me that aired on TCM. Last August, I
finally got the outlet when I switched from analog to digital cable.
Whenever I turn on the television, I immediately go to TCM to check
what's on.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, for example, TCM featured some of the best-known
Italian films from the post-World War II neo-realism period as well
as a festival of Greta Garbo films. The channel pays tribute to Joan
Crawford in August with a new documentary and a 41-film
retrospective.</TE>
<TE>   In short, Turner Classic Movies, which is available in more than
60 million U.S. homes (compared with the 84 million that receive
AMC), has taken up the standard AMC relinquished. "They have put us
in a position which is wonderful," said Tom Karsch, executive vice
president and general manager of TCM. "We really feel very strongly
... that we have enough commercial brand in this company that we can
stay pure with TCM. I am working on plans for the next couple of
years and there is no discussion of adding commercials."</TE>
<TE>   TCM does occasionally run R-rated movies but airs them outside of
prime time. "The no-editing rule is really my rule more than the
company rule," Karsch said. "I just feel that if you are in the
business and commercial-free, you should be showing the movies the
way the directors and the writers meant for you to see them.."</TE>
<TE>   Just the evening before, Karsch said, he tuned into AMC to see how
it would handle Sergio Leone's R-rated epic "Once Upon a Time in
America." "It was unwatchable," he said. "We get a lot of press and
e-mail and regular mail, and the viewers are complaining about what
AMC is doing."</TE>
<TE>   Karsch says TCM's motto is "we are about the history of film. The
bread and butter of this network have been and always will be the
films of the '30s, '40s and '50s. We do show a good amount from the
'60s, and I think every now and then we will show a title from the
'80s or the '90s if there is a compelling reason."</TE>
<TE>   AMC, he added, says its programming changes follow the desires of
its focus groups. Karsch doesn't buy that. "We are constantly doing
focus groups with the younger potential viewers because we feel as
AMC did--how are we going to get that next generation of film fans?
There are two ways of going about it. When you talk to 25- to
35-year-olds, they say run newer movies. But that is not what we are
about. We are about having a great library and trying to figure out
ways to bring that audience to appreciate that library and not
turning over the network completely."</TE>
<TE>   McEnroe insists her service's viewers haven't objected to the
addition of commercials.</TE>
<TE>   "To some degree, people expect commercials with a basic cable
network," she said. She doesn't expect much outcry when commercial
spots increase in the fall to pay for the new programming and digital
channel. "It is about 40% less than the TNTs and the USAs of the
world," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She also maintains that AMC's viewers will embrace the more
contemporary movie titles and new original programming, like the
network's first animated series, "Monsters Wanted"--a comedy about
real monsters living in Hollywood and auditioning for the movies. She
also has high hopes for "DVD TV"--also set for the fall--which
re-creates the DVD experience by airing a documentary about a film,
followed by the movie and then a repeat of the movie with commentary
by the director.</TE>
<TE>   "We have finished some focus groups, and people thought it was a
phenomenal idea," McEnroe said.</TE>
<TE>   Time will tell how viewers react to the changes, but it's hard not
to agree with Karsch, who contends AMC has turned its back on older
viewers who helped establish the network. "I think it's a terrible
thing to do the consumer," he said. "I like to look at us as a movie
service run by movie fans, for movie fans."</TE>

<LD>I just wanted to express my deep satisfaction with Robert Hilburn's
piece on Bruce Springsteen ("Hope Won Out," July 14). I live in New
York City--a transplanted Jerseyite--and have been an ardent Bruce
fan since 1978.</LD>
<LD>   Throughout Hilburn's career, he has continually delivered the
humanity of the man to readers. The current article just strengthens
the fact that Springsteen honestly values the importance of taking
his audience on something more than a sexually charged,
profanity-spewed amusement ride. I can only hope this album finds a
few souls in need of some comfort.</LD>

<TE>   Great piece on the yet-to-be released Springsteen album. As a
longtime fan of Springsteen's, I find it an absolute torment to wait
for a specific release date--your descriptions of some of the songs
will have to do until the album is released here in New Zealand on
Aug. 1. I've just been listening to "Into the Fire" from
brucespringsteen.net. I hope the rest of the album lives up to my
expectations. Although that won't be hard sitting here in my
Springsteen T-shirt, thinking of ways to afford a trip to at least
Australia for a few shows next year.</TE>

<TE>   I thought Hilburn captured a lot of the essence of what Bruce
Springsteen's been saying in recent years, both on a practical and
spiritual level. Leave it to him, the quintessential American artist,
to make our first major statement about what we've been through.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As a longtime (former) Springsteen fan, I'm curious to know how
Hilburn, as one of Springsteen's biggest supporters in rock
journalism, reconciles his "speaking for the people" image with his
plan to charge $75 per ticket. Don't you think gouging the fans works
against the working-man ethic he likes to identify with? He's often
invoked Woody Guthrie; somehow I don't think Woody, if he were alive
today, would be charging those who wanted to hear his songs $75.</TE>
<TE>   I know escalating ticket prices for major acts is the norm, but in
Springsteen's case it strikes a particularly sour note because he has
always cultivated the image of maintaining his ties to the
working-class ideals of his early days.</TE>
<TE>   I had hoped that with his new album supposedly having a post-9/11
vibe, he wouldn't raise prices again or that perhaps he would charge
a little less this time around to make the shows more accessible to
the working people he used to identify with (especially in these
trying economic times). I was stunned and disappointed when I
discovered that the standard ticket price this time was even more
than last time, during the big-money reunion tour of a couple of
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   I can't even listen to his music anymore; so much of it seems so
false. It seems to me that where Springsteen used to look out into
the crowd and see a community of like-minded fans, now he looks out
from the stage and only sees dollar signs.</TE>

<TE>   I think that it's time that someone stand up for Hilburn. Too many
of your readers see fit to belittle this fine writer, seemingly for
no other reason than they disagree with his opinions about music.
Respectful disagreement with his opinions would be one thing, but
these are personal attacks, calling into question his motivation for
writing what he does. To my mind, that's uncalled for.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly offensive are the repeated assertions that Hilburn is
only trying to be "hip" when he supports today's new artists. I take
this kind of personally, being that I too am an aging rock fan who
finds new bands like the White Stripes and ... And You Will Know Us
by the Trail of Dead to be fresh and exciting. I had always thought
that keeping an open mind to new things was a good thing, but when
Hilburn does this, he's accused of being, in the words of one recent
letter, a "wannabe rock guru." Perhaps those of us over a certain age
are just supposed to clasp our old records to our chests and moan
about how things aren't as good as they used to be.</TE>
<TE>   Well, to me, the fact that Hilburn refuses to do this is exactly
why he's as relevant as he was when I read him more than 20 years
ago. I still consider him to be everything a rock writer should be:
open-minded and fair, possessed of a sense of historical context, and
a skilled writer. I hope that he knows some of us out here appreciate
how lucky The Times is to have one of the best rock writers out there
on your staff.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hardly a week passes without someone writing and complaining or
disagreeing with something Hilburn has published. For those people I
have a modest proposal: Quit reading him. I find your rants tedious.
You know what he is going to say, so why bother. I never read him.
After all, it's not as if Hilburn is writing about something really
important. It's only about rock, which is not serious music, in any
case.</TE>

<LD>As a 30-year veteran writer and radio host in the field of world
music, I would like to respond to Agustin Gurza's piece about Cuban
artist Juan-Carlos Formell ("Enemies: A Musical," July 7).</LD>
<LD>   Formell is a brilliantly original guitarist-composer-arranger and
one of Cuba's most interesting contemporary artists. His new record,
"Las Calles del Paraiso," is by deliberate design a subtle and
intricate album that does not fit squarely into any category of Cuban
music. As a musician-composer and vocalist, he is easily the equal of
Caetano Veloso and Milton Nascimento, to whom it would be a more
appropriate comparison. That he had to go into exile to make his
first record, which was almost immediately nominated for a Grammy,
does raise questions about how nurturing the socialist schools of
Cuba really are and why a person of his gifts could not find an
outlet in his own country.</LD>
<LD>   AL ANGELORO</LD>
<TE>   Brooklyn, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gurza's article was a personal and political diatribe, not a
professional review of a work of art.</TE>
<TE>   It is impossible to fathom how anyone listening to either of
Formell's two albums (the first, "Songs From a Little Blue House,"
was a Grammy nominee) could draw Gurza's conclusions. Formell's voice
is hauntingly melodic and perfect for his songs. Missing from the
review is mention of Formell's breathtaking mastery of the guitar; he
is an undeniable virtuoso in the much-admired Trova style. Formell
has been critically and appropriately compared to Caetano Veloso,
among others.</TE>
<TE>   As an admirer of Formell's music and an anthropologist, I was
dismayed by the naive "essentialism" in Gurza's comment about the
music of Cuban refugees. Gurza implies that the real Cuban music can
only come from true Cubans in Cuba. It is by now a commonplace
observation that the crucible of exile often gives rise to the most
innovative music, literature and art.</TE>
<TE>   To call Formell's music "nostalgic" (Gurza's label for the work of
Cuban musicians here) is to profoundly misunderstand his
re-examination and fresh rendering of Cuban themes and traditions.
The review was a travesty of the work of an accomplished and
important artist.</TE>

<DH>Singer-songwriter Kristian Hoffman addresses personal
issues through duets with a who's who of L.A. pop</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NATALIE NICHOLS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When singer-songwriter Kristian Hoffman decided to make an album of
duets, he didn't envision a composite musical snapshot of himself
with the cross-generational cream of Los Angeles pop. But by
filtering his own material through such collaborators as Van Dyke
Parks, Rufus Wainwright, Maria McKee, El Vez and Stew, his new
collection honors the legacy of L.A. song craft while illuminating
more personal concerns.</LD>
<LD>   "Hopefully, even with the variety of voices, people will hear that
this is an experience, like running through various permutations of
pop songwriting," says Hoffman, 50, an animated, intense
conversationalist whose statements often lilt upward like questions.</LD>
<LD>   Wearing black jeans and a silky white shirt with silver spiral
buttons, he cuts a slightly fancy figure during lunch at a restaurant
in his Los Feliz neighborhood. On the chair beside him lies a green
blazer with an elaborately patterned lining. His many
self-deprecating comments reveal a flair for mock drama and a
neurotic streak that makes you want to reassure him somehow. In other
words, he's the perfect image of a smart, charming,
sophisticated-yet-approachable old-fashioned pop artist.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, despite his heavy guest list, Hoffman is undeniably the
glue that holds the album, titled "&amp;," together. He first gained
underground status as the keyboardist and songwriter for wild-living
'70s pop-punk band the Mumps, a New York group led by the late Lance
Loud, the effervescent oldest son on the PBS documentary series "An
American Family." Hoffman later formed the jokey rock band the
Swinging Madisons, worked with singer-actress Ann Magnuson and wrote
the cult hit "Total Eclipse" for '80s oddball glam artist Klaus Nomi.</TE>
<TE>   Both Hoffman and Loud, who died last December of HIV- and
hepatitis C-related complications, came out of the closet as Santa
Barbara teenagers during the 1973 run of "An American Family." But
Loud was the one who became a gay hero. In a way, Hoffman still casts
himself in the shadow of his friend, who is memorialized in the new
album's final track, "Lullabye."</TE>
<TE>   "He opened my eyes," says Hoffman, his blue irises widening a bit
for emphasis. "We discovered music together, but Lance was the one
who got there first. He was the one who knew to get the Velvet
Underground record, or [the Stooges'] 'Raw Power.' He sort of held my
hand during the first baby steps of getting excited about music. So
anything musical I do is a lot because of him."</TE>
<TE>   Released last month by Fullerton-based Eggbert Records, "&amp;" is
Hoffman's third album, following "I Don't Love My Guru Anymore"
(1994) and "Earthquake Weather" (1997). The 17 alternately mournful
and playful selections include the orchestral "Get It Right This
Time" with Anna Waronker, the castrati lament "Sex in Heaven" with
Magnuson and the funky, Bowie-esque "Series of You's" with Paul Zone
of vintage New York power-poppers the Fast.</TE>
<TE>   Also among the participants are Russell Mael of Sparks, New York
"no wave" poet and singer Lydia Lunch, Paul Reubens (a.k.a. Pee-wee
Herman) and Steve McDonald of Redd Kross.</TE>
<TE>   This impressive grab bag of collaborators reflects Hoffman's
musical depth, which is what attracted veteran songwriter-producer
Van Dyke Parks to the project.</TE>
<TE>   "I was interested in a new generation of pianist-songwriters,"
says Parks, who met Hoffman through Wainwright and did the string and
horn arrangements on "Revert to Type." "There was a dearth of them,
after the '70s had produced a great deal. Kristian reflects a broad
experience in music that informs his work. He is more than ordinary.
Any time somebody seems like he's been to a theater show or cabaret,
that's appealing to me."</TE>
<TE>   Eggbert owner Greg Dwinnell suggested the idea of a duet album
when he heard that Hoffman and the Go-Go's Belinda Carlisle had
talked about recording Paul Anka's "You're Having My Baby." Hoffman
initially resisted. "At first, I was like, 'Well, I wanna do my
album,' " he says with mock petulance. "Then suddenly it blossomed
into this wonderful thing. It was like a bigger-budget movie. I got
to hear people taking these fun little journeys with the songs."</TE>
<TE>   The duet approach also helped to free his work from the
constraints of his own voice, he says. For example, he was able to
record "Scarecrow," a poignant rumination on the 1998 beating death
of gay college student Matthew Shepard, because Wainwright could sing
parts of the tune that Hoffman couldn't. Still, Hoffman, who wrote
most of "Scarecrow" immediately after the incident, had doubts about
including it.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, 'Can I do this again? Hasn't it been done? Didn't
Elton John do it? Didn't Melissa Etheridge do it?' Then a friend of
mine said, 'These are stories you need to repeat.' It's good to add
to the lexicon of witnessing this outrage."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Shepard's ghost had a less powerful effect on "&amp;" than Loud's
did during the year and half it took Hoffman to complete the album.
When he and Stew, leader of acclaimed L.A. band the Negro Problem,
recorded the old Mumps tune "Anyone but You," for example, Loud was
already extremely ill.</TE>
<TE>   "Lance sang vocals on the original version, so that was very
freaky," Hoffman says quietly.</TE>
<TE>   Loud initially was supposed to be among the collaborators, but he
became too sick. "I wanted to co-write a song with him, but he never
got it together," Hoffman says. "So that was tragic."</TE>
<TE>   The word "tragic" seems to fall lightly from his lips, but it's
neither exaggeration nor dismissal. It's more a function of Hoffman,
who, like many older gay men, has long grown accustomed to losing
people to AIDS. The brief "Lullabye" is the only solo turn on the
album, and it poignantly captures Hoffman's sorrow at seeing Loud
while he was dying, as well as Loud's public bouts of regret about
his life.</TE>
<TE>   "People say parents aren't supposed to bury their children," he
says. "But when you read history, there's always been plagues. Or
wars. Parents always bury their children. But still, you never find
yourself accepting [losing] your best friend from high school."</TE>

<DH>Rod Stewart's bid to sing the standards has won over his
new label boss, J Records' Clive Davis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Playing a lot of new music for his guests during a vacation cruise
around Sicily and Capri recently, J Records Chairman and Chief
Executive Clive Davis says he got the strongest reaction from the
rough mixes of an upcoming album by a newly signed artist.</LD>
<LD>   The album is a collection of American pop standards including
George and Ira Gershwin's "They Can't Take That Away From Me," the
Jerome Kern-Dorothy Fields chestnut "The Way You Look Tonight" and
others including "These Foolish Things," "Moonglow" and "I'll Be
Seeing You," all done in straightforward, traditional settings.</LD>
<LD>   "There were about 20 people on the yacht from different areas of
the world, and not many knew each other," Davis says. "But the most
unifying and uplifting and entertaining evenings were the ones where
I put on this record, even in a rough state. To see its emotional
impact, to see people singing along--it was infectious."</LD>
<TE>   The singer?</TE>
<TE>   Rod Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   The still-untitled package, due Sept. 30, marks the first teaming
of Stewart and Davis. The singer joined J after parting ways late
last year with the Warner Music Group family of labels, his musical
home for more than two decades. Davis is known for a hands-on
approach that's resulted in one of the music business' most
impressive resumes, from Whitney Houston's biggest hits to Santana's
"Supernatural" to Alicia Keys' 2001 breakthrough.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been working very closely with Rod and [producers] Richard
Perry and Phil Ramone," says Davis, the album's executive producer.
"I'm a song man. I love the idea that great songs that have been
memorable in people's lives can be reinvented and have life long
beyond when they were written."</TE>
<TE>   Davis has had input about arrangements and approach, and also is
in the process of recruiting some big-name instrumental soloists.</TE>
<TE>   But Davis says he wants nothing to detract from the songs or from
Stewart's voice--and gives the singer full credit for the concept.</TE>
<TE>   "This actually began in 1983," says Arnold Stiefel, Stewart's
manager. "Rod and I were having dinner as I just became his manager
and he said, 'I'd like to make an album where I get to sing the songs
my parents loved when I was growing up' " in Scotland.</TE>
<TE>   The marketing plan being drawn for the album will by and large not
treat this as a pop project. Stiefel and Davis describe an
unprecedented campaign that will cross genre and age demographics.
Rather than spend money to make videos, the first priority will be TV
commercials and a network special, currently in negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   The key, Stiefel says, is simply for people to hear the music.
"When he'd play some of the roughs, people would say, 'Why hasn't he
been doing this all along?' "</TE>
<TE>   BOSS TOUR: The recent announcement that Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E
Street Band would play the Forum in Inglewood on Aug. 24 raised a
couple of issues.</TE>
<TE>   One is why the show is at the Forum--now rarely used for rock
concerts--rather than the newer Staples Center, which Springsteen
opened with shows in October 1999. The other is why this performance
is being promoted jointly by the Nederlander Organization and House
of Blues Concerts without any participation by Avalon Attractions,
which has been involved with nearly every Springsteen show in the
area for more than 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Neither representatives for Springsteen nor the promoter would
comment, but business insiders attribute the Forum move to both an
aesthetic preference--the star is said to have found Staples too
cavernous and was uncomfortable with its emphasis on luxury
skyboxes--and its lower cost.</TE>
<TE>   The break from Avalon is clearer. The company, run by founder
Brian Murphy, is now owned by mammoth Clear Channel Entertainment,
which rejected the business arrangement Springsteen has set for the
tour. In standard concert tours, promoters guarantee the act a fee
for each show (as much as $500,000 for an artist of this level) and
keep whatever ticket sales top that. Instead, Springsteen is taking
all ticket revenues and offering promoters a flat fee of $5,000,
which leaves concessions as their primary source of revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "Philosophically, promoters don't like to look at themselves as
people who are merely hired to put on concerts," says Gary
Bongiovanni, editor in chief of concert business monthly Pollstar.
"They prefer the approach that they take financial risks to give a
guaranteed payment to the artists, and if they do a good job, they
make money."</TE>
<TE>   MINE EFFORT: Paul McCartney and Brian Wilson, who both performed
at the recent Buckingham Palace celebration of Queen Elizabeth's 50th
year on the throne, will headline the second annual "Open Hearts,
Clear Mines," a Sept. 18 gala at the Century Plaza Hotel in Century
City benefiting the Adopt-a-Minefield effort to find and dispose of
land mines around the world. Jay Leno will emcee, and other
entertainers will be announced.</TE>
<TE>   People who bought tickets or donated to the event last year
recently received a letter promoting this one from McCartney and new
bride Heather Mills, who has long been active in the land-mine
cleanup effort.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who went last year knows that tickets don't come cheaply,
starting at $500 for each of a limited number of single seats and
running as high as $100,000 for "partner" packages that include two
tables of 10, two seats at the head table and admission to a VIP
reception. For information, call event coordinator Levi, Pazanti &amp;
Associates at (310) 201-5033.</TE>
<TE>   SMALL FACES: Shawn Colvin has recorded a version of the Beatles'
"In My Life" for a soundtrack album for the NBC-TV series
"Providence." The Chantal Kreviazuk-sung version of the song that
serves as the series theme also is on the album, along with songs by
Marc Cohn, Dar Williams, Eva Cassidy, Andrea Bocelli and Beth Nielsen
Chapman, among others. The album is due Aug. 6 from MCA Records

<LD>   SOLOMON BURKE</LD>
<LD>   "Don't Give Up on Me"</LD>
<TE>   Fat Possum</TE>
<TE>   Burke is one of the all-time great soul singers, an artist with
the character and command of such legendary figures as Otis Redding,
Ray Charles and Sam Cooke. But the Philadelphia native, who did his
most acclaimed work for Atlantic Records in the '60s, has been off
the pop radar screen for so long that he is probably known today only
by soul cultists.</TE>
<TE>   His profile will be lifted by this album, which follows Burke's
induction last year into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Produced by
singer-songwriter Joe Henry, the collection (due in stores Tuesday)
features songs written for Burke or contributed by such respected
writers as Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, Tom Waits and Elvis Costello.</TE>
<TE>   For those familiar with the horn-driven arrangements on the
records Burke made for Atlantic, including "Cry to Me," the spareness
of these small-combo recordings may see like little more than demos.
Burke's vocal power does call at times for more dynamic support--and
some of the songs aren't the writers' best.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, though, the tracks work wonderfully well. They showcase
Burke's voice in ways that highlight the personal, intimate nature of
his singing style. The tunes range from plaintive and winsome to
philosophical, and Burke's spectacular voice updates the intensity
and desire of soul's golden age. He plays Wednesday at the House of
Blues in West Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Hilburn</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   DJ SPOOKY</TE>
<TE>   "Optometry"</TE>
<TE>   Thirsty Ear</TE>
<TE>   DJ culture does have its Zappa, its Stockhausen, its Cage, an
artist defying fashion and changing the possibilities of music
forever, and that man is Paul Miller, a.k.a. DJ Spooky. He's never
promised a dance-floor hit and you won't find one here. Instead, his
15 albums since 1995 have chased a mind-blowing future music binding
classical composition, jazz and electronica. On "Optometry," that new
music arrives at last.</TE>
<TE>   This is an expansive work of avant-garde jazz with a humanized
electronic soul. With a live group that includes such New York "new
music" standouts as accordionist Pauline Oliveros, Spooky and his
turntables inhabit the urban mix like an invisible agent in a William
S. Burroughs book.</TE>
<TE>   Without vinyl pyrotechnics, Spooky reveals how free jazz is also
the highest expression of outlaw classical composition, German
proto-electro like Can, the '80s-'90s new-music scene of John Zorn's
Naked City or Sonic Youth, the beat-theft of hip-hop and the
turntablism of the X-Ecutioners.</TE>
<TE>   Spooky, who plays Wednesday at the Galaxy in Santa Ana and
Thursday at the Knitting Factory Hollywood, gives this mix a heart,
and a light one. Like the Romantic poets, Spooky puts his overplayed
intellect in the service of beauty, and "Optometry" features his
sweet new sound in its full glory.</TE>
<TE>   Dean Kuipers</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   THE CRYSTAL METHOD</TE>
<TE>   "Community Service"</TE>
<TE>   Ultra</TE>
<TE>   The four years that the Crystal Method took between the release of
its 1997 debut, "Vegas," and its follow-up, "Tweekend," was too long.
As self-described perfectionists who have a hard time letting go of
their music, Angelenos Ken Jordan and Scott Kirkland had to come up
with a way to avoid a repeat of the long lapse.</TE>
<TE>   "Community Service," the first mix CD from Jordan and Kirkland (in
stores Tuesday), is the answer. Unlike the pair's first two albums,
when they composed all the music, this is a mix CD--which includes
some tracks they admire from other artists. But "Community Service"
is more than just a mix CD. It also features several rarities and
exclusives, including Crystal Method remixes of P.O.D., Garbage and
Rage Against the Machine tracks.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the inclusion of those rock remixes, "Community Service"
still plays like a traditional mix CD, moving continuously from style
to style. The record kicks off with a series of beat-laden dance
tracks, the best of which is Stir Fry's propulsive "Breakin' in the
Street." Among the rarities, a remix of the Crystal Method's "Name of
the Game" turns it into more of a dance-friendly club track, while
the remix of P.O.D.'s "Boom" maintains the song's explosive nature
among the synthesized beats.</TE>
<TE>   The Crystal Method has achieved much of its success because, like
the Prodigy, it resides comfortably in both the rock and dance
worlds. "Community Service" shows both sides of the band with equal
aplomb. It will both DJ and play a live set at Spundae, Saturday at
Circus in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Baltin</TE>
<TE>   In Brief</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2 Toby Keith, "Unleashed," DreamWorks. For the first time,
the brawny Oklahoman has written or co-written everything on an
album. The results reaffirm rather than redefine his niche in country
music as a plain-spoken man's man, with a hint of Romeo beneath the
surface. His chest-thumping side comes out in the subtlety-free hit
"Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American)" and his
duet with Willie Nelson on "Beer for My Horses." Things get more
interesting when he allows some complexity into his writing. In
stores Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Lewis</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2 Mario, "Mario," J. At 15, this R&amp;B-pop singer has already
scored with his hit "Just a Friend 2002," an homage to Biz Markie's
1990 Top 10 single. On his debut album, Mario uses his smooth, pretty
voice to beg for an older girl's attention ("What Your Name Is"),
pledge his devotion ("Never") and assert his romantic viability ("Put
Me On")--all in a seductive yet age-appropriate style. Despite the
army of producers and contributions from star label-mate Alicia Keys,
the high school sophomore's personality glimmers through the
slickness, recalling the more innocent days of Michael Jackson, or
maybe Prince at his most sweet-talking. Natalie Nichols</TE>
<TE>   *** Styles, "A Gangster and a Gentleman," Ruff Ryders/Interscope.
Jadakiss, another member of hard-core rap group the LOX, had more
hype surrounding his solo album last year, but Styles delivers a much
better effort. The Yonkers, N.Y., artist's straightforward delivery
goes down easy, and the moving, autobiographical title track's vivid
narrative comes off like a gripping sonic movie. Elsewhere, Styles'
clever, street-centered wordplay and the punishing, drum-driven
production make for a bruising listen.</TE>
<TE>   Soren Baker</TE>
<TE>   Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair),
three stars (good) and four stars (excellent). The albums are already
released unless otherwise noted.</TE>

<LD>   "Diaspora Blues"</LD>
<TE>   Tzadik</TE>
<TE>   Many artists who record for this indispensable label have explored
the links between jazz and Hebraic music, but few have done so as
eloquently as trumpeter Bernstein, who's assisted here by the Sam
Rivers Trio.</TE>
<TE>   Using ancient cantorial chants as his starting point, the
trumpeter creates deeply affecting, fantastically melismatic horn
lines. Meanwhile saxophonist Rivers' trio produces a swirl of
accompanying sound.</TE>
<TE>   The music veers from serene to tumultuous, from primeval to
modern. Yet neither the spirit of improvised jazz nor the minor-key
phrases of Jewish liturgical music ever recede into the background.
Instead, they merge into one exultant ensemble sound, as if born of
the same source.</TE>
<TE>   The triumph of this recording is not simply that Bernstein and
Rivers' band found common ground, but that they forged a startling
new musical language, fusing jazz, blues and Jewish music in original
and seamless ways.</TE>
<TE>   ****</TE>
<TE>   WYCLIFFE GORDON</TE>
<TE>   &amp; ERIC REED</TE>
<TE>   "We"</TE>
<TE>   Nagel Heyer</TE>
<TE>   Trombone-piano duos are not exactly commonplace in jazz, but
trombonist Wycliffe Gordon and pianist Eric Reed transcend the
presumed limitations of such a partnership.</TE>
<TE>   Like a great vocalist, Gordon unspools gloriously inventive lines,
his plunger mute so expressive in "Embraceable You" and his phrases
so sinuously unpredictable in "Paris Blues" that one nearly forgets a
trombonist is at work.</TE>
<TE>   Reed, a nimble accompanist for all occasions, gives Gordon
precisely the musical contexts he requires, from gospel-tinged
pianism on "The Lord's Prayer" to Fats Waller-like stride style on a
Gordon original, "This Rhythm on My Mind" (with Satchmo-inspired
vocals from Gordon).</TE>
<TE>   Thomas A. Dorsey's "Precious Lord, Take My Hand" stands as the
most moving cut on the disc, but its spirituality is characteristic
of a unique, unflaggingly optimistic recording.</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   LARRY GOLDINGS TRIO</TE>
<TE>   "Sweet Science"</TE>
<TE>   Palmetto Records</TE>
<TE>   On his newest trio outing, Goldings--an exceptionally versatile
jazz organist--combines harmonically clever organ riffs with sleekly
understated ensemble playing. And although the music-making might
seem practically nonchalant on first hearing, the precision, control
and balance of these performances are far more difficult to attain
than one might assume.</TE>
<TE>   Listen to Goldings' elliptical solos and soft but relentless
accompanying figure on "Lookout" or his breezy musical dialogue with
guitarist Peter Bernstein on the title cut, and there's no question
that these musicians prefer to say more with less.</TE>
<TE>   The anthem for this economical brand of playing has to be the
venerable Burt Bacharach-Hal David tune "This Guy's in Love With
You," which Goldings, Bernstein and drummer Bill Stewart deliver with
delectable restraint.</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   JOE MORRIS</TE>
<TE>   "Age of Everything"</TE>
<TE>   Riti Records</TE>
<TE>   Only a few young artists legitimately can claim to be expanding
the expressive possibilities of their instruments, and this
avant-garde guitarist stands out among them. Anyone who has heard
Morris in concert already has experienced his phenomenal virtuosity
and extraordinarily subtle use of color and shading.</TE>
<TE>   But those who haven't yet encountered him should find "Age of
Everything" an excellent and mostly accessible introduction to his
art.</TE>
<TE>   Although there's no doubt that Morris and his trio explore
sometimes arcane, nontraditional harmonies and revel in ferociously
volatile rhythms, there's usually some element of the music-making
that even casual listeners can latch onto.</TE>
<TE>   Whether improvising freely above a straight swing backbeat by
bassist Timo Shanko and drummer Luther Gray, or creating openly lyric
melody lines in unaccompanied statements, Morris takes pains to give
listeners entree into an otherwise rarefied but daringly innovative
musical language.</TE>

<HD>First the Trains, Now the Arts</HD>
<DH>Museums and other cultural groups are putting old rail
facilities to useful purposes. But the projects are fraught with
difficulties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a breezy morning down by the old Santa Fe station in San Diego,
the palm trees rustle, the rail commuters bustle and, along the
platform, the broad doors of an 87-year-old baggage storage building
groan open.</LD>
<LD>   Following the footsteps of countless baggage handlers, Hugh M.
Davies, director of the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, steps
in, looks up at the scarred tile walls and steel trusses that support
a 38-foot-high ceiling, and says something no baggage handler has
ever said.</LD>
<LD>   "The whole space is thought of primarily as a sculpture space,"
says Davies, waving an arm. "It's about volume, not pristine white
walls."</LD>
<TE>   If Davies has his way, this blue-collar building will be reborn in
two years as an exhibition space--which may seem a novel transition,
at first glance. But follow the tracks north for 120 miles, to a
long-bedraggled, semi-bohemian corner of downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Since September, about 400 undergraduates and grad students have
been gathering here to make little wooden models and pace the halls
of a vast, concrete curiosity of a building, 40 to 60 feet wide and
1,250 feet long. This is the new home of the Southern California
Institute of Architecture: a freight depot, built in 1907 by the same
company that built the Santa Fe station in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "We like the unrelenting and extreme nature of the building," says
Gary Paige, the SCI-Arc faculty member who served as principal
architect of the adaptation.</TE>
<TE>   The prospects may seem dimmer by the day for Amtrak and interstate
passenger rail service, but across the U.S., museums and other
cultural groups are making over old rail facilities at a startling
pace. Within the last five years, redevelopment campaigns in Los
Angeles, San Diego, Baltimore, Kansas City, Mo., Tacoma, Wash., and
elsewhere have transformed historic railway buildings into museums or
campuses, or both.</TE>
<TE>   In Baltimore, where Baltimore &amp; Ohio railway workers laid the
nation's first mile of long-distance railroad track in the 1820s,
several buildings from the early years of railroading have been
converted to cultural uses, most recently the city's 1849 President
Street Station, which in April 1997 reopened as home of the Maryland
Historical Society's Baltimore Civil War Museum.</TE>
<TE>   In Tacoma, the University of Washington won a 1999 National Trust
for Historic Preservation award for its renovation of six brick
warehouses in the Union Station district to create a new campus.
Federal officials had already turned the main station nearby into a
courthouse and filled it with native son Dale Chihuly's art glass
pieces, including a massive cobalt chandelier. Now the campus
enrollment has reached 2,000, and in the neighborhood surrounding the
terminal, a history museum has opened, the Tacoma Art Museum is
putting up a new building (to open in 2003), and a glass museum
opened this month.</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Monica, city officials in the early 1990s found
themselves in possession of Bergamot Station, a 7-acre rail yard
where trolleys stopped as long ago as 1875. There was no grand
terminal, just a collection of warehouses. But developer Wayne Blank
saw possibilities, made a deal with the city, and put together a
complex of more than three dozen art galleries and related
businesses, including jewelers, framers, an auctioneer and a cafe.
The complex opened in late 1994, and the Santa Monica Museum of Art
joined the scene, taking over an adjacent plot owned by Blank and his
wife, gallery operator Shoshana Blank, in early 1998.</TE>
<TE>   All these relocations come despite many strong practical arguments
against the attempted rescue of a railroad property. Restoration
costs can be staggering, surrounding neighborhoods are often rotten,
and tales are plentiful of redevelopment campaigns awash in red ink.</TE>
<TE>   But to paraphrase an old Amtrak ad slogan, there's something about
a train station. Admirers cite the soaring ceilings, the broad
passages for foot or freight traffic, the bold, purposeful
architecture, and, in some cases, the economics. Many rail buildings
come cheap because of their location, and many offer the chance to
defray costs with preservation grants from governments.</TE>
<TE>   Cultural groups often step into these projects when entrepreneurs
fail. In other cases, developers seize upon nonprofits as
collaborators when they need a civic-minded partner to ease
government approval. In San Diego, for instance, the Santa Fe
station's owner--Catellus Development Corp., a publicly traded
offspring of the old Santa Fe Pacific Railroad--has pledged
renovation, donation and reuse of the baggage building space (with
the museum as tenant) in exchange for permission to build two
residential towers next to the tracks.</TE>
<TE>   Not all of these efforts are vast projects full of strange
juxtapositions. At smaller stations where there's less money on hand,
local railroad museums often sprout. In fact, the national Railroad
Station Historical Society counts a dozen such enterprises in Los
Angeles County alone, many stations moved from their original spots
to points like the Travel Town Transportation Museum in Griffith
Park, Heritage Junction Historic Park in the Santa Clarita Valley and
the Los Angeles County Fairgrounds in Pomona. But as redevelopment
veterans note, the public can only patronize so many railroading
museums</TE>
<TE>   And there are a lot of idle train buildings. Rail historians have
estimated that 80,000 rail stations once stood across the U.S., and
that 12,000 to 20,000 remain. Although many serve as hubs for bus
service and other modes of transportation, fewer than 600 of those
stations are served by Amtrak. With federal officials considering a
radical restructuring of Amtrak--which many observers expect to
result in curtailed passenger service on unprofitable routes--the
number of stations awaiting adoption could soon climb much higher.</TE>
<TE>   The Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, born in La Jolla and
headquartered there since 1941, has long embraced conceptual art,
sometimes to the great befuddlement of the uninitiated: One
installation earlier this year by artist Sarah Sze was a mixed-media
work in wood, plastic, paper and metal that, in the museum Web site's
words, "distends, distorts and deconstructs the shapes and materials
of a bed, creating a mutant form that defies gravity and the regular
geometry of the museum's architecture."</TE>
<TE>   Yet the museum's leaders have also been eager to build a downtown
identity. Since 1993, the museum has had a 10,000-square-foot
satellite exhibition space across the street from the Santa Fe
station, a high-traffic site near not only intercity train service,
but San Diego's light-rail system. Director Davies acknowledges that
perhaps because neighboring residential projects have lagged, the
satellite facility has never met visitation targets.</TE>
<TE>   The museum's response: Take more space in a more interesting
building.</TE>
<TE>   This campaign intensified in January 2001, when city officials
chose the museum in a competition among cultural institutions
interested in using the space. (The competitors included the San
Diego Railroad Museum, which has for years been using part of the
baggage building as an archive repository.) Since then, museum
officials have been huddling with the site owner, along with New York
architect Richard Gluckman, a seasoned adaptor of commercial
buildings to museum and gallery uses, and San Diego architect Milford
Wayne Donaldson, a seasoned restorer and adaptor of California rail
facilities, including stations in Santa Barbara and San Bernardino.</TE>
<TE>   "I first came in here in the '80s, when we were talking to Count
Panza di Biumo, a great collector in Italy," about possible
exhibition spaces, Davies recalls. The count eventually sold and
donated most of his works elsewhere, but the feel of the space stuck
with Davies. Because Amtrak had little need for the building's
generous dimensions, the museum was able to put up a handful of
temporary installations there in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   For the museum and the architects, the baggage building offers the
opportunity to put highly abstract art in a highly utilitarian
building and see what happens. (The founders of the Massachusetts
Museum of Modern Art did the same thing on a far larger scale in May
1999, when they opened their institution in 27 old factory buildings
on a 13-acre site in North Adams, Mass.)</TE>
<TE>   In December, the San Diego museum unveiled its ambitions, and in
September, the museum expects to seek a more specific go-ahead from
the San Diego City Council. With no details yet, museum officials
say, it's impossible to estimate a budget for the transformation. But
their ballpark guess is that the combined costs for the museum and
Catellus would fall between $10 million and $20 million.</TE>
<TE>   If the renovation goes as planned and city officials approve a
proposed addition that's also part of the project, MCA San Diego
could be showing modern sculptures and art installations in the Santa
Fe baggage building by 2004. For the first time, the museum would
have more exhibition space along the tracks than in La Jolla.</TE>
<TE>   The station's exterior is done in Spanish Mission-Colonial Revival
style. Designed by San Francisco architects John R. Bakewell and
Arthur Brown Jr., it was built by the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe
Railway to welcome visitors to the city's Panama-California
Exposition in 1915-16.</TE>
<TE>   Apart from its high ceilings, the Santa Fe baggage space includes
clerestory windows, concrete floors, a dozen old benches and a faded
8-by-10-foot green sign that seems to list long-forgotten departures.
But it only seems to. The faded sign was part of a work by artist
Gary Simmons for a museum special event in the space in 1997, then
left behind--a playful hint, Davies says, of the possibilities ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the exhibition rooms, the museum addition would feature
offices, a space for special events, and an artist-in-residence
studio. As plans stand now, exhibitions would stay up for six
months--longer than is typical at the museum's other location.</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposed deal, the city would take over ownership of the
baggage building and an adjacent structure from Catellus Development
Corp., and in exchange give Catellus development rights on property
it owns nearby. Catellus would pay for exterior renovations to the
13,000-square-foot baggage building, and the museum would pay for
interior improvements and a 14,300-square-foot building addition.
Still to be decided: the length of the lease and the museum's annual
rent payment to the city--details that will determine in large part
whether the museum's move is a big gamble or an easy bet.</TE>
<TE>   Public fund-raising probably won't begin, Davies said, until the
necessary city approval is in place.</TE>
<TE>   He looks again at those high ceilings, which slope from 38 feet at
the highest point to 13 feet at the sides. "The lowest ceilings
here," Davies said, "are the same height as the highest we have in La
Jolla."</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, the number of idle rail structures has been growing
since the 1950s, when the widening freeway and highway network and
increase in air travel began luring away train passengers by the
millions.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, many historians say the historic preservation movement in
the U.S. was basically launched by a railway station--or rather, by
the recriminations following the destruction of one. After
preservationists failed to save New York's Penn Station from
demolition in 1963, historians say, local and state governments
nationwide started strengthening their laws to preserve old
buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Train station aficionados won another big victory in 1991 with
Congress' passage of a measure that offers federal aid when local
governments return old stations to public use. Erich Strebe, director
of planning and economic development for the Las Vegas, N.M.-based
Great American Station Foundation, says grants can cover as much as
80% of construction costs, and the new public use need not include
train service.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest railway redevelopment and restoration projects in the
U.S. in the last 20 years have been retail affairs, including St.
Louis' Union Station reopening in 1985, Washington, D.C.'s Union
Station face-lift in 1988 and New York's Grand Central Station
upgrade in 1998. But Strebe estimates that perhaps 250 more modest
projects, from campuses to museums to offices, are in various stages
across the country.</TE>
<TE>   For an art museum director, just the idea of an idle train station
may be enough to inspire dreams of Parisian grandeur. The Musee
d'Orsay, once a 1900 rail terminal in Paris, fell idle after World
War II and was derelict for decades before its 1986 conversion. Now,
as the showcase for France's most-admired Impressionist paintings and
thousands of other works produced between 1848 and 1914, it is among
the top tourist attractions in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   But a train is still a hard act to follow. Many of this
generation's most ambitious rail-side redevelopments have been
massive commercial failures, leaving entrepreneurs awash in tens of
millions of dollars in red ink, and often leaving local governments
responsible for enormous empty spaces that can cost a fortune to
maintain.</TE>
<TE>   For gory details, ask anyone who lived through the Johnson, Nixon,
Ford or Carter administrations in Washington, D.C. That city's Union
Station is known these days as a spectacular redevelopment success, a
station-adjacent shopping mall with thick crowds circulating among
130 shops and restaurants. But the mall, which opened in 1988, was
not the first redevelopment plan for that station. In the late 1960s,
as rail travel waned and crowds thinned in the 1908 terminal, federal
officials decided to revive it by making it a National Visitor Center
and in 1968 put the National Park Service in charge.</TE>
<TE>   It was a disaster. Through a much-lamented partial renovation in
the early 1970s and an opening on July 4, 1976, park service
officials spent an estimated $117 million but never drew enough
visitors to justify the center's existence. Although train service
continued, the visitor center closed in 1978, and soon the roof was
leaking and mushrooms were sprouting in the maple floorboards. It was
only after that failure that officials embraced the idea of a
shopping mall.</TE>
<TE>   For more recent cautionary tales, look to Kansas City, Mo., where,
after $170 million in public spending on a 1999 restoration and
adaptation, a science museum and neighboring enterprises in Union
Station have struggled with anemic attendance and staff turnover. Or
look to Indianapolis, where a mall development in that city's Union
Station closed its doors in 1997, then reopened with tenants
including a Go-Kart track and a pair of alternative schools for
at-risk teens.</TE>
<TE>   As in San Diego, Kansas City and Indianapolis, most railway
stations these days are owned by local governments or for-profit
development companies that have been spun off from the old freight
rail dynasties.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest mistake these enterprises make when they start redoing
a station or depot, says Strebe of the Great American Station
Foundation, is presuming that "if you rebuild it, they will come."</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego and Los Angeles efforts are less chancy projects
than most. The buildings they've targeted require no exotic materials
or heroic restoration measures. Further, the audiences that the San
Diego and Los Angeles efforts aim to serve, modern-art enthusiasts
and architecture students, respectively, are about as adventurous as
consumers get. But whenever people trail after trains, architects and
historians agree, the transition is tricky.</TE>
<TE>   For SCI-Arc, an innovative, informal institution with a slim
budget and a reputation for creative improvisation, the 1907
Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe freight depot off Merrick Street wasn't
just a singular design challenge; it was a chance to make a true
home.</TE>
<TE>   For more than two decades, SCI-Arc had been a semi-nomadic
institution, occupying provisional homes in Santa Monica and the
Marina del Rey area. But under a deal made in May 2000, the
400-student school took over the graffiti-marred building and began a
$6.1-million preservation and conversion effort. (Aided by a
$1-million grant and a $500,000 loan from the city of Los Angeles,
SCI-Arc is leasing the building with an option to buy, school
officials say.)</TE>
<TE>   The building stands in an old industrial precinct that city
redevelopment mavens have dubbed the Artist District.</TE>
<TE>   Designed by architect Harrison Albright, the depot was considered
a pioneering use of reinforced concrete. While the structure was
updated, students and faculty endured a year in neighboring trailers
and tents that leaked when it rained.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of things that are really a good fit for us. One
is the part of town that it's in. We wanted to be downtown. We really
see this as an opportunity to be a catalyst in the city," says
SCI-Arc faculty member Paige.</TE>
<TE>   Further, Paige says, "the fact that it's horizontal is emblematic
of an attitude that we have about organizations--far less
hierarchical than most institutions. The building in a certain way is
a physical manifestation of that."</TE>
<TE>   But it's not exactly luxurious. The $6.1 million ran out before
anyone could buy window treatments, so students improvised shades of
fabric netting and cardboard to keep the afternoon sun at bay. Most
of the furniture is simple plywood. Also, as the economy turned soft,
companion plans for 280 housing units next door evaporated (although
possibilities remain open for an 8-acre lot next to the building).</TE>
<TE>   Yet in some cases, the school's lack of amenities has already done
the neighborhood some favors. In the absence of a cafeteria, students
get their coffee at nearby Cafe Metropol of the Gourmet Coffee
Warehouse, which opened Feb. 4. In the absence of a campus bookstore,
they buy their architecture texts at Form Zero, a design bookstore
that gave up its Santa Monica address last summer and followed
SCI-Arc downtown. And in the absence of on-campus student housing,
scores of SCI-Arc students have joined the downtown loft-dweller
population, a notable boost for a community whose numbers had dropped
dramatically during the economic gloom of the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   The raw and eccentric nature of the old freight depot "goes with
what SCI-Arc is known for," said Johan Roa, 24, of Montebello, an
incoming student who has been spending time on SCI-Arc campuses since
the school was based in Marina del Rey. "It gives us freedom to do
pretty much anything."</TE>
<TE>   One risk of the move is that the downtown location might scare off
prospective students, whose tuition is on average $17,000 yearly. But
officials say applications to the school's graduate program are up
slightly, which extends a pre-existing growth trend. Further, adds
admissions director Debra Abel, she's seen a big jump in campus
visitors--"hundreds of people, from all over the world."</TE>
<TE>   Faculty member Paige calls SCI-Arc's new home "a found
object"--one with ceilings up to 29 feet high and broad views of the
downtown skyline.</TE>
<TE>   The campus is slightly longer than the Empire State Building is
tall, with a wood shop at its south end and a library at the north
end. Along the 1,200 feet in between, some stretches are one floor
with high ceilings; others are two floors with metal catwalks
connecting rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the space is set aside as studios for students, but there
are also offices for 60 faculty and 30 staff. Here and there remain
"unprogrammed spaces"--corners for which nobody has yet discovered a
purpose.</TE>
<TE>   When facilities manager Chris Seals had the building measured in
detail recently, he discovered that one end is five feet lower than
the other. That's an imperceptible difference to anybody walking
through the building, but for the new occupants, it's one reminder of
the wonders that can be revealed when an old building is made new.</TE>
<TE>   Walking SCI-Arc's long halls these days, "you can watch history
move right in front of your face," says architect Eric Owen Moss, who
took over as director of the school in January.</TE>
<TE>   It seems that just the other day, "that Santa Fe [locomotive] was
pulling up. And now it's a school," Moss says. "It gives you a sense
of the continuity of ideas, and the movement of a city over time. And
you have to think, 'Well, if it's a school now, what might it be in
another 75 years?' "</TE>

<DH>Merce Cunningham choreographs apart from music and relies
on chance. Not only does it work, it's liberating.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Last year, Merce Cunningham was lured back to acting. He played Erik
Satie, the quirky French composer, who was made to seem all the more
quirky given that the play's text, from his writings, was assembled
by chance procedures. The piece, "Alphabet," was a staging of a radio
play by John Cage, Cunningham's creative and life partner.</LD>
<LD>   After a performance at UCLA, when I complimented him on making
Satie completely irresistible, Cunningham raised his eyebrows in mock
horror. The lines were almost impossible to memorize, he protested.
He was a dancer, not an actor.</LD>
<LD>   "What about your student days in theater?" I asked.</LD>
<TE>   "Yes," he said, "but that was performing playwrights like Chekhov.
And they made sense!"</TE>
<TE>   This week at the Lincoln Center Festival in New York City,
Cunningham begins a 1 1/2-year celebration of the 50th anniversary of
the founding of his company in 1953. It has been an exceptional run
for a radical artist tirelessly exploring dance with no story, no
symbolism, no specified emotional character, no center.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, he has been admired and scorned, but seldom has he
been accused of making sense--not, anyway, in the way that most
people think about dance.</TE>
<TE>   No one throws tomatoes at the Merce Cunningham Dance Company
anymore (as they once did in Paris nearly 40 years ago). But even
after half a century, it still goes against convention that the
choreographer and his dancers work apart from music, that the dances
are conceived and rehearsed in silence. The music, along with the
decor, arrives at the dress rehearsal or first performance. And
Cunningham's penchant for using chance procedures to order movement
still strikes people as a scary, nonsensical way to make art.</TE>
<TE>   In 1968, the cover of the Saturday Evening Post was taken up by a
stark photograph of Cunningham, his face painted half white, half
red. "Who is this man?" the headline read, as if he were an alien
from another planet.</TE>
<TE>   The image of Cunningham has softened considerably of late. His
white hair an Einsteinian tangle, he has, at 83, a sagacious,
avuncular presence.</TE>
<TE>   He is regularly hailed as the world's greatest living
choreographer: Then-President Francois Mitterand made him a Chevalier
of France's Legion of Honor; the first President Bush awarded him the
National Medal of the Arts. His portrait hangs in the company of
Elvis, Marilyn and Jackie in the Warhol show at the Museum of
Contemporary Art.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the question persists. Who is this man? And another: How is it
possible that Cunningham has managed to survive and finally thrive
after 50 uncompromising years in the avant-garde, that ever-shrinking
tributary in the flood of mainstream popular culture?</TE>
<TE>   I first saw the Merce Cunningham Dance Company at UCLA in 1963 and
have seen it hundreds of times since. I first met him formally about
a dozen years ago, requesting interviews for a book on Cage. It was
just the kind of imposition Merce hates, and he was cool in response.
But he warmed. Now the chats are informal, over occasional meals and
social gatherings, and, once, we shared a train ride from Brussels to
Bonn. Mutual friends keep me up to date.</TE>
<TE>   That, of course, hardly qualifies me as a Mercist, as dance critic
Anna Kisselgoff once dubbed the faithful. I'm an unsophisticated
outsider in the dance world. I don't have a good memory for movement.
Given how complex some of his dances can be, I often watch pieces
I've seen many times as if for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Still, even my fragmentary view is enough to persuade me of this:
Not only do Merce and his work make sense, but it is the kind of
sense that really matters. And it is the secret of his genius,
longevity and, now, celebrity.</TE>
<TE>   One thing you have to know about Merce is that he is essentially a
naturalist. Take a look at his drawings, just published in "Other
Animals: Drawings and Journals." He began making sketches about 20
years ago on the road in Los Angeles, whiling away a travel delay by
sketching a tree. He said the result was terrible, but he had become
so engrossed in looking at the tree that the time passed in an
instant. From that moment on, he was hooked.</TE>
<TE>   Now he sketches as daily discipline in his journal, and also makes
more formal color-pen drawings of the natural world he encounters on
the road and of animals he finds in books. The style is somewhere
between, say, Audubon and Saul Steinberg. To me, these wonderful
drawings--an adorable reindeer, quizzical giraffe and goofy,
self-possessed birds and insects--are idealized Cunningham dancers.
In these superb, mysterious creatures, we can see ourselves and
something completely outside of ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   It is therefore ironic that for a long time his dances were
interpreted as depersonalized and unnatural simply because they evade
narrative and embrace randomness. In fact, Merce's dances, just like
his animals, personify nature--mysterious, unpredictable (the
function of chance)--as seen through the human eye, as rendered by
the human touch.</TE>
<TE>   I remember him once talking of his father, who practiced law in
Centralia, Wash., where Merce was born and raised.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing he liked better than law," Merce said, his
delivery punctuated by theatrical flourishes and exclamations, "was
more law." As he laughed at the absurdity of that, his face
registered affection and admiration, as well as acknowledgment that
he could never have followed in his father's footsteps, as both of
his brothers did.</TE>
<TE>   He was a popular kid in Centralia, but escaping the confines--of a
small town, of usual ideas about being in the theater--became his
metier. He left Centralia for Seattle and then New York City. Once in
New York, he got his start as a spectacularly virtuosic dancer in
Martha Graham's company in the 1940s. In that milieu, he was clearly
acquainted with choreography as a vehicle for psychological probing,
and he was good at it. But that, too, proved confining. He wanted
real liberation.</TE>
<TE>   Merce formed his own company out of a workshop at Black Mountain
College, in North Carolina, in the summer of 1953. At the same time,
Cage had begun to devise a method to widen the scope of music,
bringing in indeterminate elements by tossing coins and consulting
the Chinese oracle, the I Ching, to determine details of a score. The
result was like viewing the night sky, where a large impression is
gathered from noting the random placement of the stars.</TE>
<TE>   With Cage as the music director for his company, Merce discovered
that he could make use of chance procedures, within reason, in
creating movements--you can't have the dancers bumping into each
other. It was also only natural to "liberate" the dance from the
music, as well.</TE>
<TE>   "Slavery is abolished," Cage proclaimed of this new autonomy.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, it is. Not only is the choreographer provided a greater
sense of freedom, but the spectator is unburdened as well. As someone
more attuned to music than dance, for instance, I don't always like
the way conventional dance attempts to control the way I listen to
music.</TE>
<TE>   Natural as the urge to dance to music may be, we, in the modern
world, are equally comfortable moving with music that is an
independent soundtrack in our lives. Music meant to suggest one thing
is very often playing while we are thinking or doing something
unconnected to it. You may have music on the stereo right now  that
has nothing to do with what you are reading.</TE>
<TE>   The other great advantage of dance that is independent of music or
narrative is that you don't have to know what is going on to like it.</TE>
<TE>   Traditional ballet, and even some modern dance, operates through a
language of visual codes that must be learned and that require a
significant suspension of disbelief. By now, I'm pretty good at
following the way dance expresses the story of "The Nutcracker" and
"Swan Lake," but I'm still not so sure about "The Firebird." I sort
of know what Martha Graham was saying in her dances, but not what
each phrase means. Balanchine and Mark Morris cleverly illuminate
musical gesture and structure, but even with those choreographers I
find myself worrying about what those dance phrases are signifying.</TE>
<TE>   All you need to appreciate the Cunningham company, however, is a
pair of eyes and an open (or even better, empty) mind. You look as
you would at animals in their habitat, as you would at street life
from an outdoor cafe.</TE>
<TE>   Just as music's independence from dance makes sense in that it
replicates real life, it also makes sense as a way to collaborate. In
fact, liberation is possible because Merce has been able to set up
ideal conditions of trust and knowledge, where collaborators don't
impose too strongly on each other.</TE>
<TE>   This may account for the army of creative people who have signed
on to serve with Merce over the past 50 years: from artists Jasper
Johns and Robert Rauschenberg, who have provided the company with
costumes and sets and general artistic direction, to a host of
composers in addition to Cage--Morton Feldman, Pauline Oliveros,
Robert Ashley, along with an occasional pop musician such as Brian
Eno.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the best way to understand the way it works is to look at
the rare occasion when something goes wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Although Christian Wolff, a composer who began working with Cage
in 1950, often wrote music successfully for the Cunningham company,
he once let his politics get in the way. Instead of the abstract
music he had normally supplied, he used songs with adamant left-wing
texts. He said the moment the performance began, he realized that it
was a mistake, that the music, in effect, shouted down the dancers.</TE>
<TE>   Although Cage and Merce never actually said so, Wolff felt that
they had thought this a kind of betrayal, that he had missed his
cues. Merce may work outside of the music, but he willingly discusses
the general tone of a work with his collaborators and welcomes them
to rehearsals.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the musical faux pas also nicely illustrates the kind of
thrilling drama that only a first night with his company can provide.
(The composer, incidentally, was soon forgiven; Merce's newest work,
"Loose Time," which will be performed next week at Lincoln Center and
at UCLA on Jan. 31, has a new score by Wolff.)</TE>
<TE>   More typical with Merce, however, is the way music that one might
not expect to work, in fact, does.</TE>
<TE>   La Monte Young's score "2 Sounds," for "Winterbranch," a violent
dance of falling bodies from 1964, is legend. It includes the sound
of ashtrays scraped against a mirror and wood rubbed against a gong;
both are amplified to excruciating volume. Although this was what
provoked the tomatoes in France, it also provoked audiences
everywhere to come to terms with the meaning of violence in American
culture.</TE>
<TE>   I discovered how close the dancer could feel toward composers when
I was riding with him to a concert in 1996. I blurted out something
about Toru Takemitsu's death a week earlier, assuming that he surely
had heard about it. But he had been traveling and the news had missed
him. His face turned ashen, and he said hardly a word for the rest of
the evening.</TE>
<TE>   Such emotion from a practitioner of the coolly abstract should
come as no surprise. By not telling you what to feel, when you see
the dancers and hear the music, there is nothing you can't feel.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings us back to what makes sense: to Merce the naturalist,
distilling and animating raw nature, human and animal. And to the
power of liberation, which when we achieve it, we like to call
exhilaration.</TE>

<HD>He's Trying Humor--Really</HD>
<DH>With 'Happy Times,' Zhang Yimou puts a comical spin on
everyday Chinese lives, even as he worries that his country is
changing too fast for him to keep up</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>China's best-known filmmaker, Zhang Yimou, in recent years has moved
away from the period epics that depicted China's turbulent 20th
century history with stinging social criticism--"Red Sorghum," "Raise
the Red Lantern" and "Shanghai Triad"--to more intimate contemporary
dramas such as "Not One Less," about a teenager drafted into a
teaching position, and "The Road Home," in which an illiterate wife
devotes her life to her husband, a rural teacher. Both these films
deal with seemingly ordinary young women confronting extraordinary
challenges.</LD>
<LD>   With "Happy Times," which opens locally Friday, he continues his
concern with the lives of everyday people and the value of striving
for a worthy goal, but expressed with considerable humor, which is
unusual for a Zhang film. Zhao Benshan plays a hapless, foolhardy,
aging bachelor who believes he has at last found the woman of his
dreams and in desperation pretends he is wealthy. Needing funds, he
turns to his friend (Li Xuejian), who hatches a scheme to turn an
abandoned bus into the Happy Times Hotel, which privacy-starved young
couples can rent by the hour.</LD>
<LD>   The humorous pitfalls of this endeavor give way to the bachelor's
growing concern for his beloved's neglected and ill-used blind
stepdaughter (Dong Jie), which takes the film in an unexpected and
far more serious direction.</LD>
<TE>   "I read the novel, which the film is based on, and the inspiration
came to me," said Zhang, 51, on a recent trip through Los Angeles. He
was accompanied by Dong Jie and actress Lisa Lu and interpreter Sarah
Xu, although Zhang does speak a little English.</TE>
<TE>   "For years, China has been gradually becoming a more commercial
society, and I think that the 'small' people who are caught up in it
really appeal to the public. I am just describing simple emotions in
these people. The character in the novel was a hero for his class, a
model citizen, but becomes corrupted," he said. "The government
doesn't want pictures to be shown with somebody of that kind of
status who becomes so corrupt, so we turned him into a retired
worker. Then we added the character of the young girl, played by Dong
Jie."</TE>
<TE>   Zhang said the film has been a popular and critical success in
China, which has not always been the case for him. One example was
"To Live" (1994), with its unblinking depictions of the excesses of
the Cultural Revolution. While the government restricted some of his
earlier period films, Zhang said that now only "To Live" is
restricted; all the others are available.</TE>
<TE>   After "Shanghai Triad" (1995), which marked the end of his
professional and personal relationship with actress Gong Li, Zhang
said he wanted to change his style, and he began to think about
everyday contemporary life.</TE>
<TE>   Toward that end, making "Happy Days" proved a satisfying
experience.</TE>
<TE>   "It took only around 40 days to make 'Happy Days,' which is quite
fast for me. I was able to do this because the actors are very
experienced and the plot quite concentrated. Zhao Benshan is the most
famous comedian in China today, but he seldom takes parts in films.
He works mainly in the theater and in stand-up comedy."</TE>
<TE>   The challenges of filmmaking in China, including censorship,
remain about the same and have not gotten any easier. Concerning
censorship, "in different periods there are different requirements
but no change," he said. "And if you have a script that you cannot
get approved, then the film will not be approved. There's not much
foreign co-production because the requirements are so hard to meet."
However, veteran producer Edward R. Pressman and director Terrence
Malick, both Americans, are executive producers of "Happy Times."</TE>
<TE>   "Every day, the number of young people going into film is
decreasing," Zhang said. "People like to watch TV shows and that's
all they want to watch. TV series are very popular in China, and TV
is a far greater influence than film. Those TV series can really make
an actor a star."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, he said, "every year there is a new generation of
filmmakers from the universities. In China, the actors come from
either the Beijing film school or from a stage acting school. Most of
the Chinese directors are now independent producers."</TE>
<TE>   A graduate of the Beijing Film Academy, Zhang in 1985 returned to
his hometown, Xian, where he began working as a cinematographer at
its renowned film studio.</TE>
<TE>   After 14 years as a director, he has changed creative direction
again. "I am just finishing 'Hero,' a period action movie like
'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,' set 2,000 years ago, the opening
period for China with the Ching Dynasty. I shot it in my hometown,
and it's about the Ching emperor and a swordsman. It stars Jet Li and
two other big international Hong Kong stars, Maggie Cheung and Tony
Leung. It's a big picture, and it's fun, but I also just want to
express something about Chinese tradition and culture. I want to
break through the traditional kung fu movie, like Ang Lee did."</TE>
<TE>   Like Ang Lee, Zhang also admires the late King Hu, whose period
martial arts movies, most notably "A Touch of Zen," possess a strong
spiritual dimension. "A lot of Hong Kong movies are a total mess
because they lack this," he said. "I just want people to think back
and realize that the characters are three-dimensional. I want to
learn from King Hu, and I may want to make some other kung fu movies.</TE>
<TE>   "I have many plans, but maybe some of them I cannot accomplish,"
he continued. "I want to shoot another film about the Cultural
Revolution, but maybe I should wait for a time when conditions are
good enough that I could shoot it. I would like to shoot historical
movies about China. I have few plans for more contemporary movies. I
think that Chinese society is changing so fast that maybe I cannot
catch up. The biggest problem is that China is becoming very
westernized.</TE>
<TE>   "The current situation of the Chinese film is not very good," he
said. "The new generation of directors is doing its best to make good
Chinese films. Many are doing TV series to gain experience. They also
have many opportunities in the non-Chinese film--in Korea they have
many opportunities. They can absorb things very quickly. I think that
maybe in 10 years there will be some great, great directors."</TE>

<HD>Train Station Conversions: A Tale of 4 Cities</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kansas City, Mo.: Built in 1914, Union Station lost much of its
passenger train service, then its commercial tenants, then closed
altogether in the late 1980s. After years of fizzled redevelopment
efforts, a public-private partnership launched a revival effort with
the Kansas City Museum's Science City as a centerpiece. Since the
reopening in 1999, results have been mixed. In December, the Kansas
City Star reported that the Science City museum's attendance was
running at about half of the 800,000 projected annual visitors.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Tacoma, Wash.: Built in 1911, this city's Romanesque-style Union
Station was refurbished in 1990, and then converted into a courthouse
enlivened by a 98-foot-high rotunda and glass sculpture by Dale
Chihuly. Neighboring warehouses were converted into a new campus by
the University of Washington, which has spent an estimated $112
million on land and construction, with another $41 million expected
in a new phase. Nearby are the Washington State History Museum
(opened in 1996), the $63-million Museum of Glass, which opened
earlier this month, and the building site of the new Tacoma Art
Museum, expected to open in 2003.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Indianapolis: The 1888 Union Station terminal, built in elaborate
Romanesque Revival style, closed in 1979. It reopened as a mall in
1986 after a $50-million make-over paid for by public and private
money. But by 1997, the doors were closed again. In the most recent
bid at revival, the mall's disparate tenant list includes a go-cart
business and an alternative school.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Washington, D.C.: Completed in 1908, this Union Station is a
Beaux-Arts design of massive size. Its usage dwindled in the 1960s,
prompting a plan to revive it as a National Visitor Center. The plan
was a bust, and the station closed in 1978. Its deliverance didn't
come until 1988, when workers finished a $160-million effort to
convert much of the vast building into a mall. The station reports
more than 23 million visitors yearly.</TE>

<HD>There's Joy in Nellyville</HD>
<DH>A potential big-league baseball player, the St. Louis
rapper keeps his eye on the ball when it comes to music</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC WEINGARTEN</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When Nelly emerges from his dressing room at CBS Television City half
an hour before taping his performance on "The Late Late Show With
Craig Kilborn," he looks as spry and hale as a morning talk-show
host. The rap superstar, dressed in his requisite public attire of
football jersey and baseball cap, with a diamond-encrusted ram's head
pendant hanging from his neck, is placid and cooperative, exchanging
pleasantries with the show's talent booker and other bystanders.</LD>
<LD>   But once he and his group, the St. Lunatics, hit the show's tiny
performance area, it's a different story. The cameras seem to unleash
Nelly's dormant feral energies, and he and his four cohorts break
through the program's carefully tended show-biz facade like
Rottweilers through chiffon. The polite, tourist-dominated audience
responds with waving hands and pumping fists.</LD>
<LD>   Nelly is working the crowd in his own distinctive way, alternating
his gruff rap voice during the verses with a playful singing voice on
the lubricious chorus. It's a style unlike any other mainstream
rapper, and it has turned Nelly into a hip-hop superstar.</LD>
<TE>   Nelly, 23, doesn't like to mess around. The rapper, who sold 9
million copies of his 2000 debut album, "Country Grammar," on the
strength of the hits "Ride Wit Me" and the title song, likes big fun,
but he's also a micromanager who leaves nothing to chance. If
something needs to be done, he'll do it.</TE>
<TE>   Keep in mind that the man is a terrific baseball player who had
enough talent to seriously consider a major league career. He has a
professional athlete's steely resolve and discipline, a determination
to set goals and then exceed them. Ask Nelly why he chose shortstop
as his position and he'll tell you it's because "he's the leader."</TE>
<TE>   "He's ultra-competitive," says Kevin Law, the Universal Records
executive who signed Nelly to a record contract. "I am too. It's one
of the reasons why we have a good relationship."</TE>
<TE>   That iron will has led Nelly up from the underclass into the
pantheon of rap superstars that includes Eminem, Dr. Dre and Jay-Z.
Confronting the sophomore jinx head-on, Nelly's new follow-up album,
"Nellyville," sold 714,000 copies in its first week of release and
has now been No. 1 on the U.S. pop album chart for three weeks with
1.5 million copies sold.</TE>
<TE>   The rapper likes to think of "Nellyville" as a loosely structured
concept album--a hip-hop rarity--in which each song represents a
different facet of urban St. Louis life. "Hot in Herre" is about guys
out on a strip-club bender; "Kings Highway" is a nighttime cruise
through the city's underbelly. According to Law, who is also the
album's executive producer, "Nellyville" is in many ways the artist's
true coming-out album.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Country Grammar' was more of a group collaboration than this
one," Law says. " 'Nellyville' was written from a more personal
perspective. The thing I always stressed was that he take his time
with the record. There was no need to rush it out. Everyone's waiting
for you to fail the second time. When it was done, we all just knew."</TE>
<TE>   Talking to Nelly about his short sprint to success is like
attending an Anthony Robbins seminar on awakening the giant within.
He's a firm believer in the Protestant ethic. "Anything you want, you
can have, if you work hard enough for it and don't hurt anyone in the
process" he says, sitting in the studio's green room before the
Kilborn taping. "That's all I did. I was just worn out, man, from
where I came from.</TE>
<TE>   "The block was on fire. I had to get myself out of there by making
the rap thing work for me."</TE>
<TE>   Nelly makes it sound easier than it really was. He often boasts
about being the first significant rapper to emerge from St. Louis,
and that was no small task. The city isn't a hotbed of mainstream
hip-hop by any means, and Nelly couldn't look to any regional artist
for a path to success. As the first St. Louis-bred major rap star,
Nelly has sent label talent scouts scrambling through the Gateway
Arch looking for emerging talent.</TE>
<TE>   "The underground scene is much better now," he says with some
satisfaction. "People are starting to believe more. It's a big
commotion!"</TE>
<TE>   Nelly is as proud of drawing attention to Missouri rap as he is of
his own accomplishments. He's pumped full of civic pride and eager to
discuss the virtues of his hometown, even though he was reared in
some of St. Louis' toughest neighborhoods and had a troubled
childhood.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there it is in the lyrics of "Nellyville's" title song, the
rapper's vision of his native town as a shining city on a hill.
Imagine a place with "blocks and blocks of no cocaine, blocks of no
gunplay" and "no lotteries, no pick threes or pick twos," Nelly raps,
a city where everyone has "40 acres and a pool."</TE>
<TE>   "If I could, I would build this perfect place to put those less
fortunate than others," he says. "I'm trying to relieve a lot of
people's stress right now, and that's what it's all about."</TE>
<TE>   Nelly, born Cornell Haynes Jr., has endured his fair share of
stress. The only child of a retired Air Force officer and a mother
who toiled as a fast-food server for 30 years, Nelly felt the tug of
warring impulses--9-to-5 industriousness versus the life of the
streets.</TE>
<TE>   His parents split when he was 7, and neither was up to the task of
taking care of him. So they just let him drift from relative to
relative. He attended eight schools in 12 years. His mom took him in
during high school, but Nelly got his own place during his senior
year and he never looked back.</TE>
<TE>   "I was used to bouncing around, fending for myself, so it wasn't
anything to live on my own," he says. This is also around the time
that he began hanging with his street-minded cousins and encountering
the drug trade. "I was affiliated with that, but I never took the rap
for anything, because everyone thought I was gonna be a ballplayer,"
he says.</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by his boyhood idol, Hall of Fame shortstop Ozzie Smith,
Nelly was good enough to play in the St. Louis Amateur Baseball
Assn., which serves as a kind of farm system for professional teams
scouting regional high school talent. His prospects were encouraging,
but Nelly didn't want to spend years moving through the minor league
system before he got a chance at glory.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted money," he says. "That's why I went back to the streets.
But then I realized that was a dead end. I mean, did I want to be
another statistic or make something of myself?"</TE>
<TE>   Nelly knew his salvation could only come through hustling and
work. A rap career was something Nelly had dreamed about, but he'd
never acted upon.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, he formed the St. Lunatics with five close
friends--Robert Cleveland, Tohri Harper, Ali Jones, Corey Edwards and
Lavell Webb. All remain with the group except Webb, who is serving a
10-year prison sentence on drug charges.</TE>
<TE>   They started hitting the club circuit with copies of a homemade
single, "Gimme What You Got."</TE>
<TE>   "We did every hole in the wall, anywhere we could possibly go,"
Nelly says. The record garnered modest radio play locally but nothing
earth-shattering. So they made another record, "Country Grammar,"
which became a huge underground hit.</TE>
<TE>   But when it came time to shop for a deal, every major label
passed. Except one. "They were very rudimentary recordings, but I
fell in love with the stuff," says Universal's Law. "Nelly's voice
was so melodic, it caught me immediately. I called their manager and
told him they should come to New York right away."</TE>
<TE>   It was Law's idea to pull Nelly from the St. Lunatics as a solo
act. "The group agreed that it was a good idea," Law says. "There
wasn't any commotion about it." Law has signed every member to solo
deals as well, and the St. Lunatics released their group album, "Free
City," a platinum-selling album released last year.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no separation between Nelly and us," says Edwards. "He's
never made a high-profile appearance without us. The decision for him
to go solo first was a group decision. I can't say how proud I am of
him. The way he's matured as an artist and a person, it's
unbelievable. And you know the ladies love him."</TE>

<HD>Wait, It Gets Even Worse</HD>
<DH>Those golden years are turning to lead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Balzar</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I'm hearing the same unsettling lament again and again from family,
friends and acquaintances: They were planning for retirement, they
explain. No more. Now they'll have to stay on the job until they're
70. Or 75. Or whatever.</LD>
<LD>   They were going to travel or move to the Rockies or build a
sailboat or write that long-deferred novel. But now these baby
boomers are contemplating another 10, 15 or 20 years at the
wage-and-salary grindstone.</LD>
<LD>   Considering circumstances, you have to believe that these people
are more than half serious. If so, we're headed for a chain-reaction
collision of generations just around the next bend.</LD>
<TE>   Today's headlines about the flimsy, sometimes fraudulent,
foundation of our boom in wealth spell out facts, though not yet the
consequences. The nest eggs of millions of working Americans have
shrunk by a third or more. Compared to expectations, their loss is
far greater. Countless productive workers in their late 40s to early
60s had been putting the finishing touches on retirement dreams,
presuming a continued double-digit annual growth of their 401(k)s.
Now, instead of doubling their savings in the next few years, they
find themselves dragged backward.</TE>
<TE>   No, I'm not reaching for my violin to gin up public sympathy for a
generation--my generation--that has zigzagged its way through the
fanciful fields of self-indulgence since the 1960s, throwing its
heart ahead of good sense in quest of everything from free love to
easy riches. But the fallout of the boomer bust will leave no
American untouched, and mostly for the worse, I suspect.</TE>
<TE>   Biologists use the phrase "dominant-year class" to define a
cyclical bulge in the population of a species of animals. Such a
group has a disproportionate effect on resources, and thus on the
lives of all fellow creatures in front of them and all those behind.
The post-World War II boomers are something of a dominant-year class
of living Americans and will be for the next 25 years or so.</TE>
<TE>   The first of these 14.2 million employed boomers face the
retirement age of 65 in less than a decade, hardly enough time to
find comfort in that old nostrum about taking the long-range view of
the markets. Behind them are an additional 30 million workers aged 45
to 54.</TE>
<TE>   Let's suppose for a moment that a significant number of these
graying Americans now hope to forestall their retirement plans. Will
they really be able to keep their jobs? Can employers afford to carry
60-year-old workers for another 10 years, paying them high-end
salaries and vacations, covering their rising health insurance costs,
investing in their training? If so, what about the crushing effect on
aspirations of younger workers itching to rise in the firm?</TE>
<TE>   More likely, many boomers will be flushed out of their careers.
Corporate reform as now discussed has nothing to do with making
companies more paternal, only less reckless. And our laws provide
scant protection against age discrimination. So where will these
workers go? And how much will they squawk while going?</TE>
<TE>   You don't have to ponder this for more than a second or two to
realize that there isn't enough Prozac in the world to prevent a
boil-over of social tensions. The seeds were planted 20 years ago
when employers successfully--and quietly--secured government approval
to revolutionize the nation's pension system.</TE>
<TE>   Company-paid retirement plans began to be phased out, steadily
replaced by 401(k)s and the like as the retirement foundation of the
wage and salary work force. Recent studies show that workers ended up
with the lesser end of the deal as corporations took advantage of the
opportunity to reduce their pension contributions by about 18% per
worker. But employees did not complain very much. Their quarterly
mutual fund statements spelled out their futures in lump-sum numbers,
and the markets promised only growth.</TE>
<TE>   Tomorrow's fallout is unlikely to be quiet at all. Even optimists
who foresee a market recovery are realizing that they cannot
realistically expect to catch up and attain the savings balances they
recently counted on--at least not in time for their planned
retirement. Pessimists fear that the bust will spread to housing,
draining away cherished equity gains.</TE>
<TE>   Quite suddenly, we feel the future pinching in, not opening up. To
generalize about us boomers, we are not very practiced at what seems
to confront us: a diminished tomorrow. Meanwhile, the immutable rule
of the "dominant-year class" assures that everyone else will suffer
too.</TE>

<HD>Alarcon's Blow Against Secession</HD>
<DH>Latino leader has staggered the movement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRANK del OLMO</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five years ago, when he was a city councilman from the San Fernando
Valley, Richard Alarcon was the odds-on favorite to be Los Angeles'
first Latino mayor of the modern era. He was well regarded by Latino
activists but, being from the Valley, had crossover appeal to
conservative voters.</LD>
<LD>   In 1998, Alarcon opted to pursue his political fortunes in
Sacramento rather than City Hall; he's now a Democratic state senator
representing the East Valley.</LD>
<LD>   But no matter where Alarcon's political ambitions lead him next,
he recently rendered a great service to Los Angeles--arguably greater
than if he somehow had managed to become mayor.</LD>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, Alarcon cast what may be the decisive vote that
keeps the city whole. That happened when he announced that he would
not support the effort to break the Valley away from Los Angeles and
also rebuffed Valley residents who were urging him to run for mayor
of the proposed new city.</TE>
<TE>   Like a boxer's one-two punch, Alarcon's decision knocked the wind
out of the secession movement, at least temporarily.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, city voters may yet approve proposals to allow the
Valley and Hollywood to secede in November. But without Alarcon's
help, those campaigns will be much harder to win.</TE>
<TE>   Why? First, because Alarcon is one of the Valley's best-known
elected officials and is especially popular among the 49% of Valley
residents who are Latino. Of course, not all Latinos in the Valley
vote. Many are too young or are not yet citizens. But Alarcon has
proved in close contests that he can turn out those Latinos who do
vote.</TE>
<TE>   A recent Times poll found that among Latino voters in the Valley,
52% favored secession and 33% were opposed--numbers similar to those
of their neighbors. Alarcon's decision could sway many of the 15% who
were undecided and even erode support among those Latinos who favor
it. (The Times poll found Latino voters citywide opposed secession,
45% to 36%).</TE>
<TE>   A handful of respected Latino activists in the Valley have talked
about running for office in the proposed new city, which will assure
at least some Latino voter support for secession. But a high-profile
candidate for mayor would have energized Valley Latinos to support
secession in a big way, and Alarcon was the only hope that
secessionists had.</TE>
<TE>   Every other Latino politico in town is already fighting secession,
including City Council President Alex Padilla. He has gone so far as
to form his own campaign committee, focusing on voters in his East
Valley district.</TE>
<TE>   Even former Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, who was almost
elected the city's first modern Latino mayor last year, has agreed to
temporarily forget the nasty campaign that Mayor James K. Hahn ran
against him in order to co-chair, with Hahn and former Mayor Richard
Riordan, a citywide campaign against secession.</TE>
<TE>   On the city's Eastside, where the Valley's concerns often draw the
bored yawns they do most places south of the Santa Monica Mountains,
county Supervisor Gloria Molina is trying to organize a unified
Latino campaign against secession. Her argument to Eastside voters is
that one big city has more clout in Washington and Sacramento, where
lots of the tax money to pay for L.A.'s infrastructure and social
needs comes from, than two smaller cities.</TE>
<TE>   But as helpful as all of these Latino political leaders will be in
trying to keep the city together, none has the influence with Valley
voters that Alarcon does.</TE>
<TE>   Only Padilla can rival Alarcon's roots in the Valley. Yet Padilla
is somewhat neutralized in the secession campaign. If Padilla even
flirts with secession, as Alarcon briefly did, he'll be ousted as
council president. And precisely because Padilla holds a prestigious
City Hall position, secession backers can dismiss him as a stooge of
the downtown interests that they claim control City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   That's unfortunate because lifelong Valley residents like Alarcon
and Padilla bring bona fides to the campaign against secession that
few other politicians can. They know first-hand the frustration that
Valley residents sometimes feel when trying to get City Hall's help.
Padilla and especially Alarcon are living proof that Valley
representatives can have real clout if they play their politics
smart. Speaking of which, if Alarcon helps beat secession he may find
himself back where he was as a city councilman--as one of the
favorites to become Los Angeles' first Latino mayor of the modern
era.</TE>
<TE>   And that's all of Los Angeles--not the abbreviated version.</TE>

<HD>Perilous Nuclear Tunnel Vision</HD>
<DH>U.S. can breach Iraq's bunkers in other ways.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL LEVI and THERESA HITCHENS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Deep beneath Iraqi soil, armored bunkers protect Saddam Hussein's
arsenal of chemical and biological weapons. As the Bush
administration lays plans for taking Baghdad, these bunkers are much
on the minds of military planners.</LD>
<LD>   The problem has brought back to life the idea of tactical nuclear
weapons on the battlefield. Powerful administration proponents often
characterize their position as choosing a lesser evil: Either develop
the nuclear bunker killers or let Hussein and his cronies hide safely
underground with their weapons. Unfortunately, this tunnel vision
downplays both the consequences of nuclear weapons on the battlefield
and the impressive potential of U.S. nonnuclear forces against
hardened bunkers.</LD>
<LD>   During the Cold War, the primary deep-buried targets were Soviet
missile silos. The choice was easy: Detonate nuclear-tipped ballistic
missiles above a silo and destroy it. In the context of a full-scale
nuclear war, this strategy made perverse sense. There would be no
friendly ground troops to endanger, no complex war strategy to
disrupt. Thankfully, this scenario is now implausible.</LD>
<TE>   The wars in Afghanistan and Kosovo are the models for future
conflicts: tightly coordinated, maneuverable Special Forces units
working with local resistance and coordinating precise airstrikes. A
massive bunker-busting nuclear weapon does not fit this strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Using nuclear weapons to destroy buried targets would irradiate
battlefields for friendly and enemy troops alike. A strike even
within several miles of a town or city would cause mass civilian
casualties. This would be true even if, as some supporters have
suggested, the weapon was a low-yield earth penetrator far smaller
than the bomb used on Hiroshima.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, there is a better way. Command and control bunkers
can be effectively rendered useless by strikes against their
vulnerable above-ground communications stations. Entrances to buried
facilities can be sealed using precision weapons, including
incendiaries and thermobaric vacuum bombs that kill the occupants.</TE>
<TE>   Advanced penetrating missile technology can also be used to
directly attack buried targets. Consider the BLU-116, a 2,000-pound
penetrating weapon already in the U.S. arsenal. A new "smart fuse" is
being developed to allow the warhead to detonate at a very precise
depth, increasing its effectiveness against buried targets.</TE>
<TE>   These conventional weapons are also better penetrators than their
nuclear counterparts. Such a weapon experiences massive shock as it
slams into the earth; the warhead it carries has to endure that
traumatic impact. Nuclear weapons are exquisitely sensitive items,
making the engineering of nuclear earth-penetrators significantly
more difficult than that of conventional penetrators.</TE>
<TE>   Other, more futuristic solutions are in the works. The military is
exploring a system known as Deep Digger, which would look like a
conventional missile but operate on principles of dry drilling used
in oil exploration. It would use a rapid-fire cannon to quickly
hammer a hole deep into the ground. The digging projectiles fired by
the cannon would be filled with a high-density gas so that pulverized
rock would be cleared away by the rising gas. A smart fuse would
detonate the payload once Deep Digger reached its target. All of this
is designed to weigh only 100 to 200 pounds, so it could be carried
by Special Forces units or launched from an aircraft. Even more novel
weapons could include foam that would harden inside a bunker.</TE>
<TE>   It is simply not necessary to choose the lesser of two evils in
handling the bunker threat. Nuclear weapons can remain the option of
last resort, not routine battlefield tools that, once deployed, could
lower the bar to the use of nuclear weapons against the U.S. and its
allies.</TE>

<HD>The U.S. in Contempt of Court</HD>
<DH>International tribunal takes a crippling hit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISA NEWMAN</AU>
<BD>Alisa Newman is an attorney working for the United
Nations in East Timor.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the battle of the U.S. versus the International Criminal Court,
which ended recently with a compromise agreement, the Bush
administration proved that you can blink with your eyes already
closed.</LD>
<LD>   After weeks of disregarding the contempt of the international
community at U.S. arrogance toward principles of international law
and justice, the Bush administration stepped down from its insistence
that American peacekeepers receive wholesale immunity from the ICC,
the world's first permanent war crimes tribunal.</LD>
<LD>   Under the compromise deal, countries that oppose the court--such
as the U.S.--would be exempt from investigation and prosecution for
one year, rather than be given a blanket exemption. However
deplorable the likely outcome of the Bush administration's
intransigence--the crippling of an institution dedicated to providing
justice to victims of heinous and universally condemned acts--its
tactics were even more so.</LD>
<TE>   As part of its hard-sell negotiating strategy, the administration
played a dangerous game of brinkmanship with U.N. peacekeeping
missions around the world. It threatened at the eleventh hour to
block the renewal of the U.N. mission in Bosnia and yanked out the
three U.S. soldiers who were assigned to the U.N. mission in East
Timor. The decision of the administration to use peacekeeping
missions as pawns in the struggle over the ICC was as ironic as it
was cruel.</TE>
<TE>   With one blow, the administration struck at the heart of the
world's two most effective institutions that address genocide and war
crimes. The advantages to humankind of a permanent international war
crimes tribunal have received much ink in recent weeks. But the
peacekeeping mission also fulfills important roles in post-conflict
societies--as interim government in countries whose civil
administrations have collapsed, as border security, as trainer of
nascent police forces and armies. Both the war crimes tribunal and
the peacekeeping missions are necessary to prevent wobbly postwar,
post-genocidal societies from descending into chaos.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest losers in the battle over the ICC are, of course, the
war-torn, genocide-plagued nations of the recent past and the near
future. Take, for example, East Timor, the tiny half-island nation
that lost as much as one-third of its population under brutal
Indonesian occupation from 1975 to 1999. A country such as East Timor
would have been doubly punished had the U.S. succeeded in killing off
both the ICC and the peacekeeping mission. This is because, to date,
the international community has not mustered the political will
needed to establish an international war crimes tribunal (such as
those for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda) for East Timor, which has
the misfortune to be small, impoverished and not in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Had the ICC been established in time, the East Timorese could have
redressed their grievances before it. Instead, they had to settle for
the second-best alternative: The U.N., as part of its peacekeeping
mission, has created and funded a special "serious crimes"
prosecutor's office and court that are part of the Timorese national
justice system and responsible for trying crimes against humanity.</TE>
<TE>   For the time being at least, the threat to justice and peace in
East Timor, Bosnia and other post-conflict nations has abated. One
hopes that when it comes time for the inevitable round two between
the U.S. and the ICC, the Bush administration will choose from its
arsenal a weapon other than the peacekeeping missions.</TE>

<HD>Redding Wants to Become a Destination for Ecotourists</HD>
<DH>Business: To replace tapped out industries such as logging,
the Northern California town wants to be an ecotourist spot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON THOMPSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>REDDING, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Visitors to the city's new Turtle Bay Museum blink as they leave the
summer's hot glare and enter a cool limestone cave that mimics
popular nearby Lake Shasta Caverns right down to the fake bats and
cave crickets.</LD>
<LD>   They emerge face-to-face with a 22,000-gallon open-air aquarium
teeming with steelhead and sturgeon, giving the illusion that they
have waded head-deep into the Sacramento River 100 feet away.</LD>
<LD>   The subliminal shift is crafted to draw visitors' attention to
some of Redding's top tourist attractions in hopes they'll stay for a
longer visit.</LD>
<TE>   Like many Western cities built on industries such as mining and
logging that are now tapped out, Redding is trying to change its
economy. The Redding area lost 1,000 jobs in the early 1990s, and
more than 400 last summer when the Shasta Paper Co. mill closed.</TE>
<TE>   The museum complex is the centerpiece of Redding's latest and most
ambitious effort to become a destination for motorists heading
through the northernmost end of the hot, dry Sacramento Valley on
Interstate 5.</TE>
<TE>   "We were an extraction-based culture and an extraction-based
economy," said Judy Lalouche, Redding museum president and chief
executive.</TE>
<TE>   "Those days are over. So how do we use these resources in a more
sustainable manner and also support an economy?"</TE>
<TE>   Backers want to market the city of 82,000 not just as another
tourist stop, but as an ecotourist destination, catching the latest
green wave.</TE>
<TE>   They also hope to appeal to residents and prospective residents,
many from more urban areas, who want cultural amenities like museums
nearby.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people, when they think of Redding, they think of heat,
they think of stopping for gas, they think of all the wonderful
scenic opportunities around us. But they don't think of Redding
itself," said Shannon Phillips of the nonprofit McConnell Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation has contributed $26 million so far to the museum
and other eye-catchers in an $82-million, 300-acre riverfront park.
In two years, those will include a neighboring $7.3-million, 200-acre
arboretum and a dramatic $19-million harp-shaped Sundial Bridge,
designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, to glow at night
through translucent panels.</TE>
<TE>   The museum is structured to draw visitors' attention to the
Sacramento River paralleled by a newly designated National Recreation
Trail network so extensive and ambitious that American Trails moved
its national headquarters here.</TE>
<TE>   The riverside trails echo horse and mountain bike trails in the
surrounding mountains with which they will someday connect, trails
that are themselves a new use for abandoned logging roads and mining
ditches.</TE>
<TE>   The museum and even its furniture are conspicuously built of
environment-friendly material. Visitors are greeted at the door with
recycling bins advising them that "garbage is a choice."</TE>
<TE>   Its displays--from an Ansel Adams photography retrospective to a
socially conscious look at mistreatment of the native Wintu Indian
tribe--are centered on the tug-of-war between development and
environment.</TE>
<TE>   Promoting Redding as an ecotourist stop is not without its
detractors in a city built on the earth's dwindling bounty.</TE>
<TE>   Museum proponents were derided as "a bunch of greenies," Lalouche
said. "A lot of the time people think [sustainability] is no-growth,
it's antidevelopment.... We're not saying don't use the resources;
we're saying understand the resources and make wise choices about
using them."</TE>
<TE>   The Redding-based McConnell Foundation's extensive involvement
also drew objections from residents who worried that the community's
future was being planned--and paid for--by the nonprofit group.</TE>
<TE>   The Sundial Bridge became a lightning rod for residents who
consider it a too-radical departure from the city's past.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Zauher, president of the Economic Development Corp. of Shasta
County, is among those concerned about tying the city too closely to
ecotourism.</TE>
<TE>   He points as well to the city's 700-acre industrial park and
pending $16-million sports complex, $5-million aquatic center, public
library and renovated theater.</TE>
<TE>   Similar construction across the nation aimed at supporting
recreation and culture is so extensive that the National League of
Cities equates it to "previous periods of great city-building in the
late 19th and early 20th centuries," when roads, sewers, telephones
and electricity were installed.</TE>
<TE>   Redding's effort, Zauher said, "sends a message to a company that
this is a very vibrant community; it's not just another rural
outpost."</TE>
<TE>   That's important when "we've just constantly been trying to pick
up the pieces of the timber industry," Zauher said. "It's an uphill
battle."</TE>
<TE>   There are signs that it is working.</TE>
<TE>   Redding has seen a 50% increase in its hotel and motel traffic in
the last five years, and a surge after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks
as people look for drivable destinations, said Joseph Kerr, manager
of the Redding Convention Center and Visitors Bureau.</TE>
<TE>   He hopes to use the distinctive Sundial Bridge, once it is
completed in 2004, as a readily recognizable symbol of Redding in
much the same way that the Golden Gate Bridge is identified with San
Francisco.</TE>

<LD>These are trying times for Democratic Gov. Gray Davis. He seeks a
second term amid a deficit-driven budget deadlock and the chaos of
the state's electric power system. His job rating is in the pits, and
the grim, colorless Davis is catching flak for obsessive
fund-raising--$50 million for this campaign so far, with plenty more
to come.</LD>
<LD>   Still, Davis is well off because his Republican challenger is Bill
Simon Jr., whose major claim to the governorship is that he has been
a businessman and investor. What a year to make alleged business
smarts the foundation of a candidacy.</LD>
<LD>   From the outset, Simon has snubbed the public trust by refusing to
release his income tax returns, something that is routine in major
races. It's hard to tell whether he's even the successful steward of
a family fortune that he claims to be. Trouble mounted for Simon when
the Internal Revenue Service filed a lawsuit naming Simon and others
as beneficiaries of an offshore tax shelter that the government says
might be illegal.</LD>
<TE>   Simon could have scored points by tackling the issue head-on last
week, describing the investment candidly and in detail. But Simon
obfuscated by saying, "Everybody looks to be tax-efficient." Most
voters don't have the luxury or financial freedom to fret over their
tax efficiency. They do want to know whether the candidate who seeks
their trust pays a fair share of state and federal taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Davis and money were in the news too. To get to $50 million, Davis
took at least 15 contributions of $100,000 or more, including
$251,000 from the prison guards union, whose members got Davis'
approval of a hefty pay raise while other state employees got almost
nothing. Most candidates running this year in California have to live
within campaign funding limits enacted in 2000. But not Davis and
other statewide candidates. Davis let it be known as the campaign
finance bill moved through the Legislature that he would veto it if
it did not exempt his 2002 campaign--his last run for governor under
term limits--from contribution limits.</TE>
<TE>   Davis also has shamelessly used his office for campaign photo ops,
such as last week when he stood with Air National Guard personnel and
an F-15C Eagle and appealed to Washington for more planes like it so
he could combat terrorism on the California home front. True, there
is probably not a breathing politician who would turn down a good
photo op with a military airplane. (Well, maybe Michael Dukakis would
think twice.) But a letter to the Pentagon would have sufficed.</TE>
<TE>   Alas, this dreary campaign has more than three long, long months
to run. Have we seen a healthy debate about energy policy? About the
broken state budget process? About runaway growth and California's
fragile, often threatened environment? No, no and no. It's all about
money, Davis' behavior to get it and Simon's secrecy about how he
handles it. We wish it were different but can't say it's likely to
change.</TE>

<LD>In the end, as we might predict if we could bear to anticipate, it is
the little things that loom largest. This past week they finished
sifting through 1.6 million tons of debris from the World Trade
Center. That's 3,200,000,000 pounds of matter from two immense office
towers, two giant airliners and all the lives within them.</LD>
<LD>   For 10 months, workers at an abandoned Staten Island garbage dump
combed through everything hauled from the disaster site. Nearly
20,000 human body parts rest in cold storage for identification. So
far, remains of fewer than half the 2,823 victims have been
identified. The medical examiner hopes, ultimately, to ID 2,000, or
70%, of them, a gruesome task but one that can bring comfort to so
many waiting families.</LD>
<LD>   Due to the force of the explosions and the power of the collapses,
which turned reinforced concrete into talcum-like dust, the workers
found little recognizable--not a desk, not a single chair, not even a
complete desk phone. Nothing they came upon wouldn't fit in a desk
drawer. They found thousands of personal items, more than 75,000 of
them, enough to barely fill a modest garage. A few things were
returned to survivors, folks who fled in time. But most await
connection with possibly unidentifiable owners.</LD>
<TE>   The items are mostly small stuff, normal everyday things from the
pockets, purses and desks of people, many of whom no longer exist.
Some paperweights, pagers, loose change, combs and baseballs. More
than 400 watches, some ticking, some that stopped when the buildings
fell. Some items are weird: no wallets or purses but numerous credit
cards--and baby photos--that survived while massive steel beams
melted.</TE>
<TE>   They also found 119 earrings.</TE>
<TE>   Those of us who were mere witnesses to the awful events need know
no one who was actually there to grasp the power within such tiny
items. Everyone who has ever lost anyone loved, even to natural
causes, has gone through a drawer later and unexpectedly come upon a
driver's license with a face from before. Or maybe it was a watch
from a familiar wrist and another time; the watch can no longer keep
time but no one can discard it. Or a birthday card you once sent with
a forgotten sentiment that apparently became someone else's timeworn
treasure in silent storage.</TE>
<TE>   As witnesses we need not touch or see those little items to
imagine and understand their big power. They are, to be sure, just
things. But in the end, it turns out these little things are not mere
lost items. They're important keys into the memories of those now
gone.</TE>

<HD>Fair Deals for Mentally Ill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investigators from the Justice Department  visited Metropolitan State
Hospital in Norwalk last week to check out allegations that staff at
the institution for the mentally ill had excessively restrained and
medicated patients. Whether federal charges result or not, the
investigation illuminates a deeper problem: a steady decline in
funding for inpatient care of the seriously mentally ill.</LD>
<LD>   To his credit, President Bush has acknowledged a piece of the
problem: that health insurance often discriminates by paying for
serious physical illnesses like cancer but not for equally
debilitating mental illnesses like autism and schizophrenia. Bush
should go beyond sympathy to action.</LD>
<LD>   Specifically, he should pressure GOP leaders in the House to
schedule a vote on HR 4066, a measure by Reps. Marge Roukema (R-N.J.)
and Patrick J. Kennedy (D-R.I.) and co-sponsored by a majority of
House legislators that would end disparities in coverage of mental
and physical illness. Since the bill is a mirror image of legislation
that has already passed the Senate, it would quickly become law if
Bush supported it.</LD>
<TE>   Employers and health insurers want the legislation to exempt them
if they can show that it would increase premiums by more than 1%.
This issue is ripe for compromise, as the sponsors of the Senate
measure have already agreed to a 2.5% exemption trigger.</TE>
<TE>   The bills also need work on their unclear definitions of
qualifying mental illnesses. A final bill should limit the mandate to
diseases that psychiatrists agree cause significant "functional
impairment." This would clearly cover severe schizophrenia, but not
moderate anxiety. There is room to fight in the middle, but at least
"impairment" draws a line.</TE>
<TE>   State leaders also can help correct discrimination in care of the
mentally ill. By all accounts, conditions at state hospitals like
Metropolitan nose-dived after the state, to cut costs, shuttered
Camarillo State Hospital in 1997. Camarillo was a national model of
inpatient care for mentally ill children. Metropolitan--now the last
state hospital to accept such children--is overcrowded and no one's
ideal.</TE>
<TE>   Its 101 children ages  11 to 18 have been rejected from an average
of 15 prior placements in group or foster homes. They look out not to
the green agricultural fields that surrounded Camarillo but to
charcoal gray razor-wire fences and guard towers that separate them
from the 803 adult patients, including 370 prison inmates, also
housed in the facility.</TE>
<TE>   The state doesn't have the money to reopen Camarillo, but
legislators could help by rethinking the current policy of sending
sexually violent predators to state mental hospitals rather than
prisons. That would make room at other state hospitals for the
inmates housed at Metropolitan. And the children who are at the end
of the line at Metropolitan might at least feel like they're in a
hospital, not a prison.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I'm having a hard time finding a good accountant or
financial planner. I've handled most of my mother's affairs for the
last 10 years, but I'm concerned I may be making mistakes without
knowing it. Considering my mother's age and infirmity, I am reluctant
to make drastic changes in her finances on the recommendations of a
planner or accountant whom I don't really trust. I'm not comfortable
using the Yellow Pages or relying on word of mouth (how do I know the
people giving recommendations know any more than I do?). My mother
lives in a different state, which complicates estate planning. Thanks
in advance for any help or direction.</LD>
<LD>   Answer: There are a few professional designations that help
separate the wheat from the chaff. Though the following information
is far from exhaustive, it should give you a place to start and point
you to advisors who meet certain education, experience and ethics
requirements. You still will need to interview prospective candidates
to make sure you're compatible and that they have experience dealing
with clients like you and your mom.</LD>
<TE>   Ideally, you could use a whole team of professionals: an
accountant to deal with tax issues, a planner to talk about
investments, an estate-planning attorney, an elder-law attorney and a
geriatric case manager to look after your mother because you're not
close by. In a perfect world, this team would work together as a
smoothly functioning unit to help you fill in the gaps in your
ability to help your mom, and it wouldn't cost you a fortune.</TE>
<TE>   Because the ideal isn't always possible, you might want to find a
few advisors who can fill more than one role, such as an accountant
who specializes in financial planning. Certified public accountants
who hold the "personal financial specialist," or PFS designation,
might fit the bill. You can contact your local CPA Society for
referrals or visit www.cpapfs.org.</TE>
<TE>   You also could call the National Assn. of Personal Financial
Advisors, a select group of fee-only financial planners who can be
reached at (888) FEE-ONLY or at www.napfa.org. Most of these advisors
can refer you to a good accountant.</TE>
<TE>   Good financial advisors will have some training in estate
planning, but you probably will need an estate-planning attorney as
well. Call your local bar association for a referral to an attorney
who is a certified estate-planning specialist. It would be great if
the attorney also is a member of the National Assn. of Elder Law
Attorneys, which you can find at www.naela.org. This specialty deals
with the financial, health and legal issues faced by people in their
later years.</TE>
<TE>   Geriatric case management is a relatively new but growing
profession that caters to folks who are trying to help a relative
from long distance or who are baffled by many of the day-to-day care
issues of dealing with the elderly and infirm. Geriatric care
managers can help you hire and monitor aides to assist your mom at
home, for example, or research nursing facilities if she's no longer
able to live alone. You can get referrals from the National Assn. of
Professional Geriatric Care Managers at (520) 881-8008 or
www.caremanager.org.</TE>
<TE>   Home Strategy</TE>
<TE>   Not the Right Move</TE>
<TE>   Q: We are a childless couple in our early 50s. My wife is retired
and our goal is for me to retire by age 65, if not sooner. Our
retirement assets so far total $285,000, and we have more than
$200,000 of equity in our home without any outstanding debts, other
than our mortgage. For the last several years, we have employed a
strategy of buying a new home, occupying it for two to four years and
then selling it. Our concern is that this strategy may not be very
sound as we get closer to retirement. As housing prices increase, we
feel that we may be forced to downsize or move out of the area to
maintain a reasonable mortgage payment.</TE>
<TE>   A: Each time you sell a home, you lose about 10% of the value to
commissions, fees and moving expenses. That's a substantial setback,
and you need substantial home-price appreciation to offset those
costs. Unfortunately, very few real estate markets remain hot enough
to make your strategy financially viable for the long run. That's why
most people are better off staying in homes as long as possible and
building up their equity, rather than siphoning it off by moving
every few years.</TE>
<TE>   Most people in your situation would be looking for ways to build
their assets and pay down their debt rather than looking for another
home with another 30-year mortgage. (Think about this: Do you really
want to be making mortgage payments in your 80s or even 90s? If
you're comfortable with that, fine. But many retired people like the
security of a paid-off home.) Moving less often would free more money
to put into your retirement funds.</TE>
<TE>   You can get a rough idea of whether retirement at 65 or earlier is
feasible by checking out retirement planning calculators on the
Internet. The Financial Engines calculator at
www.financialengines.com is a particularly robust one that uses
probability analysis to figure out your chances of retirement
success.</TE>
<TE>   You also can pay one of the leading mutual fund companies such as
Vanguard or T. Rowe Price $500 for a retirement-planning review or
hire a financial planner to give you a more customized look at your
possible futures.</TE>

<LD>There is a sad truth about the failed synergies behind the merger
that created AOL Time Warner Inc., which led to last week's
resignation of Chief Operating Officer Robert W. Pittman, a key
merger architect.</LD>
<LD>   It is that the America Online division would have prospered if it
had concentrated on offering customers new services on the Internet
instead of trying to wed movies, television and
magazines--yesterday's technologies--to the new technology of the
Internet.</LD>
<LD>   The Internet is not television. People don't merely watch it--they
use it and interact with it.</LD>
<TE>   That's why some Internet companies are highly successful. EBay
Inc., the service through which customers buy, sell and trade goods
and services, is thriving.</TE>
<TE>   Expedia Inc., the publicly traded online travel reservation
service, is doing well. Expedia is one of more than half a dozen
firms that form USA Interactive Inc., Barry Diller's holding company
for providers of online purchasing services. And USA Interactive is
prospering. What all those firms have in common is that they rely on
transactions for which they can charge fees.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly interesting is the success of education on the
Internet, as exemplified by University of Phoenix Online, which has
grown to more than $200 million in revenue and more than 125,000
students in the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   University of Phoenix is a subsidiary of Apollo Group Inc., a
Phoenix-based holding company for several adult education businesses.</TE>
<TE>   So far, much of the adult education field is led by privately
owned firms--prominently Knowledge Universe, a educational service
holding company launched six years ago by financier Michael Milken
and Oracle Inc. founder Larry Ellison.</TE>
<TE>   Education is a field uniquely suited to interaction with students
or customers.</TE>
<TE>   (Yes, pornography is successful on the Internet too. But that is
not surprising--porn has been successful in every medium dating at
least to Pompeii.)</TE>
<TE>   AOL has been a huge success in its basic Internet business. It has
30 million subscribers who pay monthly fees. And AOL benefits from
advertising. Last year, fees and advertising brought the AOL segment
of AOL Time Warner $8.7 billion in revenue and almost $3 billion in
pretax profit.</TE>
<TE>   AOL's biggest attraction is its e-mail and instant-messaging
services that allow customers to easily keep in touch with family and
friends. Some of the greatest businesses in the world have been
founded on serving the humble needs of family and friends. Think, for
example, of Eastman Kodak Co., founded when George Eastman invented a
Brownie camera so families could take pictures on a Sunday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   If AOL had concentrated on offering new Internet services to its
customers instead of getting caught up in movies and such, the stock
market might have seen more value in its success. After all, AOL's
main rival as an Internet service provider, Microsoft Corp.'s MSN,
has only 7.5 million customers.</TE>
<TE>   But submerged within AOL Time Warner and seen as a failed
experiment, AOL essentially is granted no value by investors in the
current stock price of the parent company, says analyst Jeffrey
Logsdon of Gerard Klauer Mattison, a New York-based investment firm.
AOL Time Warner closed Friday at $11.58 a share in New York Stock
Exchange trading .</TE>
<TE>   The Time Warner side of the company--the cable, movies, cable
networks, music and publishing businesses--might be better off today
if they never had merged with AOL. The Time Warner segments might
have attained valuations comparable to those of Viacom Inc. or Walt
Disney Co., diversified entertainment firms that are not trying to
achieve the scale of Internet synergies that AOL Time Warner had been
attempting.</TE>
<TE>   Logsdon calculates that the Time Warner businesses could have a
market value of more than $15 a share, after deducting corporate
debt, minority ownership of some of its cable assets and factoring in
intangibles of the market's judgment.</TE>
<TE>   If the AOL side alone could command $5 to $6 a share, the
potential "breakup" price of AOL Time Warner could be $20 to $21 a
share, Logsdon says. Such a breakup value, he suggests, might attract
adventurous investors, such as cable mogul John Malone.</TE>
<TE>   But other analysts don't think the present favors adventures.
Jordan Rohan of Soundview Technologies Inc., a research firm based in
Stamford, Conn., sees investors as too unnerved by the stock market's
instability and uncertainty at AOL Time Warner to make any moves now.</TE>
<TE>   In any event, the company selling at roughly half its breakup
value testifies to the fact that highly paid but unimaginative
executives have once again misunderstood a new medium. It also
happened when many movie moguls misread television, and when
phonograph executives misunderstood the promise of radio.</TE>
<TE>   Yet lessons can be learned and mistakes corrected. The new
policies of AOL Time Warner Chief Executive Richard D. Parsons,
announced Thursday, dictate that each of the company's many
businesses work to succeed individually.</TE>
<TE>   Synergy is out. Striving to be top of the class is in.</TE>
<TE>   So it's a good idea to see what the future is promising for
entertainment and the Internet business.</TE>
<TE>   For traditional entertainment companies, owning many lines of
business, from movies to television and cable and other interests,
remains the way to go, argues David Miller, a Los Angeles-based
entertainment analyst for Sanders Morris Harris, an investment firm.
He cites the relative success of Viacom, which manages CBS, Paramount
Pictures, Infinity Broadcasting and cable channels MTV and
Nickelodeon.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, contact with the Internet has been poison for
entertainment companies. Disney lost on its investment in Go.com
before abandoning the effort. Vivendi Universal's attempt to marry
entertainment to Internet transmissions over cellular telephones also
is in disarray amid reorganization of that firm.</TE>
<TE>   So there is doubt and confusion in entertainment circles about the
Internet.</TE>
<TE>   But there is no doubt elsewhere about the enormous future of the
Internet. After all, some 130 million Americans are hooked up to the
Internet, and the linkage for all but a minor portion of consumers is
through telephone lines. The delivery of broadband capabilities
through two-way cable or digital subscriber phone lines is stalled by
the heavy capital expense faced by cable and telephone providers.</TE>
<TE>   If those companies could make a breakthrough on costs, or figure a
different way to amortize the capital expenditure, broadband could
spread faster--and with it an explosion of services.</TE>
<TE>   The public likes to use the Internet. The amount of merchandise
sold through Internet sites--from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to the
smallest specialized companies--has grown to more than $200 billion a
year, about 6.5% of retail sales.</TE>
<TE>   Online education services total more than $20 billion a year. And
the opportunities for online medical services have scarcely been
touched.</TE>
<TE>   Internet companies, such as Amazon.com Inc. and Yahoo Inc., no
longer are distracted by the boom and have settled down to serious
business, trying to come up with services that customers can interact
with and for which the Internet providers can charge. An example is
the HotJobs.com employment search service that Yahoo owns.</TE>
<TE>   Digital photography, with family pictures being sent across the
country via the Internet, is doing for family heirlooms what George
Eastman did with snapshots more than a century ago. And when
broadband capability arrives, virtual family visiting will be a
growth business.</TE>
<TE>   The way to think about the Internet, in short, is as the biggest
new consumer market that ever existed. AOL and others got sidetracked
from that vision through a lack of imagination. But the correction
process may have just begun.</TE>

Breakup Value?</TE>
<TE>On the heels of management turmoil at AOL Time Warner, some Wall Street
analysts are hypothetically separating the parts of the company,
calculating a value for the Time Warner and the AOL parts, and coming up
with a total breakup stock price almost double the current market price.
Here's how one analyst figures the sum of the parts.</TE>

<LD>This stock market is like your worst hangover: You're kicking
yourself for being so stupid and your savings are gone.</LD>
<LD>   After the "irrational exuberance" of the '90s, we are paying
dearly for our fun. WorldCom Inc. is just the last straw. Not only
have I lost money personally, I now find my pension company also had
a lot of that stock.</LD>
<LD>   People like me are never going to have faith in the market again
unless these CEOs, CFOs and boards of directors are forced to give
back the money they have stolen. It's fine to tighten regulations on
accounting firms, but those executives will feel no pain unless they
have to return the money. They had exorbitant salaries and stock
options that made them millions before the truth was found out about
their companies.</LD>
<TE>   Congress is a lot to blame for what has happened. They took
millions from accounting lobbyists while keeping the Securities and
Exchange Commission from enforcing regulations. Now they say they are
shocked.</TE>
<TE>   The only way for the market to regain people's trust is for the
money to be given back to employees, pensioners and shareholders.
Otherwise, employees won't agree to have their 401(k)s invested in
it. At least when you buy a CD from an FDIC bank, you end up with
what you put in, and that sounds like a pretty good deal. Jeanne H.

<TE>   Massive stock market losses amounting to more than $6.5 trillion
in recent years were not primarily the result of corporate fraud and
accounting dirty tricks.</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, they were the inevitable byproduct of unprecedented
investor greed and stupidity, magnified by unrestrained optimism on
the part of an excessively promotional Wall Street establishment
shamelessly hyping overvalued stocks at their peak and a largely
passive Federal Reserve that piously professed concern but did
nothing to stem the speculative madness.</TE>
<TE>   If history runs true to form, investors will have two decades or
more to contemplate the damage done by their reckless disregard of
risk. We're in a weak recovery with puny profits and stock price
indexes closer to valuation levels normally associated with bull
market tops, not bear market bottoms.</TE>

<TE>   Jackson's Woes Have Nothing to Do With Race</TE>
<TE>   Pity poor Michael Jackson ["Power, Money Behind Jackson's Attack
on Sony, Insiders Say," July 9]. It is sad to see how far the mighty
pop star has fallen, but even worse to witness his reaction to his
own demise. Jackson's depiction of Sony Music Chairman Thomas D.
Mottola as an evil, devilish racist is a desperate attempt to stay
relevant, but at the expense of his own dignity.</TE>
<TE>   It's time for Jackson to stop playing the race card and just admit

<TE>   These Aren't the Good Old Pre-Union Days</TE>
<TE>   During the management tour of the unnamed shipping facility,
industry consultant Frank Hanley "chuckled and shook his head" when
at 11:30 a.m., the "noisy, outsized and frenetic" work scene ceased
for lunch. According to "Making Waves on the Waterfront" [June 30],
he "couldn't have asked for a better demonstration of the union's
power."</TE>
<TE>   What's with the chuckle and the shaking of the head? What is he
implying here? Is he opposed to these union members taking a lunch
hour? Are they supposed to wait until "work slows down" before they
have a meal? Why would it be a problem if they all took lunch at the
same time? Lunch breaks are not a job perk.</TE>
<TE>   This is not the pre-labor union days of the Industrial Revolution,
where outhouse (a luxury) breaks and meals were nonexistent.</TE>

<TE>   Homeowners Could Rely on Props. 60, 90</TE>
<TE>   "Sellers Market Tightens as Homeowners Won't Let Go" [July 7]
pointed out that many homeowners are wary of selling properties with
a pre-Proposition 13 assessment and then finding themselves paying
higher taxes on a replacement property. That's something to consider.</TE>
<TE>   But it should be noted that Proposition 60 (and the lesser-used
Proposition 90 involving moving to another county) does allow
homeowners 55 or older a one-time purchase that could result in the
transfer of a Proposition 13 value from one property to another
without an increase in taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Information about these propositions can be obtained by logging on
to our Web site at assessor.co.la .ca.us and accessing the Property
Owners Overview Section, by calling toll-free to (888) 807-2111 or by

<TE>   Chrysler Needs More Than a Warranty</TE>
<TE>   Re: "Chrysler to Offer 7-Year, 70,000-Mile Warranty," July 8.</TE>
<TE>   I wish them luck.</TE>
<TE>   I have a '99 Chrysler Town &amp; Country with about 22,000 miles on
it--my third Chrysler minivan since 1985. A couple of months ago, the
transmission started acting up and I took it in to the dealer.</TE>
<TE>   They ended up having to replace most of the innards of the
transmission. The 3/36 warranty had expired about a month earlier.
Fortunately, I had purchased a service contract and I was out only
the $100 deductible. When I wrote to Chrysler about the situation,
they sent a form letter back saying how sorry they were that I was
unhappy with the car and they'd forward my letter to somewhere within
the bowels of the corporation.</TE>
<TE>   My previous car was a '92 Dodge Caravan with a 7/70 warranty. At
about 74,000 miles the transmission went out during a trip.
Fortunately, I was able to leave the car with a Dodge dealer and rent
a car for the rest of the trip.</TE>
<TE>   When I wrote to Chrysler, they refunded about one-half of the cost
of the replacement transmission, since I had evidence of earlier
problems.</TE>
<TE>   I do hope that Chrysler will be able to actually improve its
reliability, but I doubt whether I'll be buying another Chrysler
product.</TE>

<TE>   Technology Can Miss the Connection</TE>

<TE>   My husband and I are among the millions of normal Americans who
refuse to own a cell phone to feel connected. We connect by talking
to real people face to face by attending many community events and
being out in the world.</TE>
<TE>   It is our feeling that many of these electronic conveniences
really isolate people from one another. It is possible for one to
totally avoid personal contact by communicating only via cell phones,
e-mail, voice mail, Internet shopping, etc. Is this really being
"connected"?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Sellers Market Tightens as Homeowners Won't Let Go" [July 7] pointed
out that many homeowners are wary of selling properties with a
pre-Proposition 13 assessment and then finding themselves paying
higher taxes on a replacement property. That's something to consider.</LD>
<LD>   But it should be noted that Proposition 60 (and the lesser-used
Proposition 90 involving moving to another county) does allow
homeowners 55 or older a one-time purchase that could result in the
transfer of a Proposition 13 value from one property to another
without an increase in taxes.</LD>
<LD>   Information about these propositions can be obtained by logging on
to our Web site at assessor.co.la .ca.us and accessing the Property
Owners Overview Section, by calling toll-free to (888) 807-2111 or by

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re: "Chrysler to Offer 7-Year, 70,000-Mile Warranty," July 8.</LD>
<LD>   I wish them luck.</LD>
<LD>   I have a '99 Chrysler Town &amp; Country with about 22,000 miles on
it--my third Chrysler minivan since 1985. A couple of months ago, the
transmission started acting up and I took it in to the dealer.</LD>
<TE>   They ended up having to replace most of the innards of the
transmission. The 3/36 warranty had expired about a month earlier.
Fortunately, I had purchased a service contract and I was out only
the $100 deductible. When I wrote to Chrysler about the situation,
they sent a form letter back saying how sorry they were that I was
unhappy with the car and they'd forward my letter to somewhere within
the bowels of the corporation.</TE>
<TE>   My previous car was a '92 Dodge Caravan with a 7/70 warranty. At
about 74,000 miles the transmission went out during a trip.
Fortunately, I was able to leave the car with a Dodge dealer and rent
a car for the rest of the trip.</TE>
<TE>   When I wrote to Chrysler, they refunded about one-half of the cost
of the replacement transmission, since I had evidence of earlier
problems.</TE>
<TE>   I do hope that Chrysler will be able to actually improve its
reliability, but I doubt whether I'll be buying another Chrysler
product.</TE>

<LD>Pity poor Michael Jackson ["Power, Money Behind Jackson's Attack on
Sony, Insiders Say," July 9]. It is sad to see how far the mighty pop
star has fallen, but even worse to witness his reaction to his own
demise. Jackson's depiction of Sony Music Chairman Thomas D. Mottola
as an evil, devilish racist is a desperate attempt to stay relevant,
but at the expense of his own dignity.</LD>
<LD>   It's time for Jackson to stop playing the race card and just admit
the truth: His time has passed. It's time to move on.</LD>

<TE>   As a black person, my first reaction to hearing Michael Jackson
singing the racism refrain of "the white man trying to keep the black
man down" was, which one is Jackson? Tommy Mottola is at least five
shades darker than Jackson and Jackson probably is five times
wealthier. I mean come on, Michael Jackson playing the race card?</TE>

a hard time performing.</TE>

refuse to own a cell phone to feel connected. We connect by talking
to real people face to face by attending many community events and
being out in the world.</LD>
<LD>   It is our feeling that many of these electronic conveniences
really isolate people from one another. It is possible for one to
totally avoid personal contact by communicating only via cell phones,

<HD>401(k) Sticker Shock Can Be a Wake-Up Call</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For workers in 401(k) retirement savings plans, the sticker shock may
be severe as midyear reports arrive in the mail.</LD>
<LD>   June statements probably will show that the typical 401(k)
investor has lost substantial ground this year--courtesy of the stock
market's harrowing decline. And those statements won't include the
damage from the market's continuing plunge this month.</LD>
<LD>   The heavier the investment in stocks, of course, the greater the
losses are likely to be. A Hewitt Associates survey of 401(k) plans
covering 1.5 million workers showed that about 58% of plan assets
were in stocks in June.</LD>
<TE>   That is down from about 67% in June 2000, principally because the
market has declined so sharply rather than because investors have
stopped buying stocks through their 401(k) plans.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, many investors have continued with the same asset
allocation plan all through the now 2-year-old bear market. But as
stocks' losses deepen, the question of whether it's time to make
significant changes in 401(k) assets is looming larger for more
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Should you change your investment mix? Should you cut back on
stocks in favor of safer assets? Or should you just stand pat?</TE>
<TE>   There's no single answer that applies to every person. But here's
an action plan that can help 401(k) investors who are debating
whether they should make some changes:</TE>
<TE>   * First, get your bearings. Knowing how much money to allocate to
various investment options is as much art as science, said Marc
Pressman, owner of Pressman Financial Consulting in Oak Park, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   But it helps to create an "investment policy statement" specifying
your goals and the amount of risk you're willing and able to take.</TE>
<TE>   Those with predominantly long-term goals--retirement 10 or more
years away, for example--should still feel comfortable allocating a
larger percentage of their assets to stocks, both domestic and
international, than those who are within a few years of needing to
spend retirement money, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Near-retirees will want at least five years of spending power
sheltered in plan options that promise a stable principal value, many
financial advisors recommend.</TE>
<TE>   As part of your 401(k) review, make sure you know all of the
investment options available in your plan. New options may have been
added by your company since you last changed your allocations.</TE>
<TE>   * Focus on basic diversification. Despite the Enron Corp. debacle
and other huge corporate bankruptcy filings this year, Hewitt's
recent survey found that many workers continue to allocate large
percentages of their 401(k) savings to their own company's stock.</TE>
<TE>   Roughly one in three investors have 75% of their retirement assets
in company stock, while 15% have all of their retirement savings in
their own company's stock, the survey found. On average, nearly 28%
of plan assets are in company shares.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, "The rough rule of thumb is that you shouldn't have more than
5% to 10% of your assets in your own company's stock," Pressman said.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't just that investing in one stock is exponentially more
risky than investing in a broad basket of shares. Workers also must
remember that if their savings are concentrated in their employer's
stock, they risk having both their job and their savings in jeopardy
at the same time. As former Enron, WorldCom Inc. and Global Crossing
Ltd. employees can attest, that can be a terrible combination.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, some investors have heavy company stock allocations
because their employer matches their contributions solely in company
stock. But to the extent an investor can reduce the total allocation
to company shares, it's wise to do so, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Basic diversification also means owning both domestic and foreign
stocks, and smaller stocks as well as blue-chip issues. It also
demands owning some fixed-income securities, such as bonds or
so-called stable-value funds offered in many 401(k) plans.</TE>
<TE>   In the long run, returns on fixed-income options should be lower
than returns on stocks, because the risk typically is lower with the
former. That's why investors should be wary of rushing into income
options now, even though their returns on midyear statements will
look attractive relative to stocks' losses, advisors say.</TE>
<TE>   The reason to always own some income securities is that they can
partially offset stocks' losses in down markets, giving more
stability to your overall portfolio, said Judy Lau, a certified
financial planner in Wilmington, Del.</TE>
<TE>   That's a lesson many investors may feel that they're learning too
late. But it's never too late to provide a portfolio with essential
diversification, advisors say.</TE>
<TE>   For help determining what your best asset mix might be, try mutual
fund company Vanguard Group's Web site, at www .vanguard.com.</TE>
<TE>   * Remember that you have two ways to change your mix. You can
dramatically alter how your assets are allocated by shifting money
among investment options--for example, by telling your plan
administrator to sell 20% of your stocks and use that money to buy
into a fixed-income option.</TE>
<TE>   You also can make more gradual changes by altering how your new
contributions, and those of your employer, are allocated.</TE>
<TE>   Many advisors favor the gradual approach because they note that
the other option is a form of market timing, which is a game few have
ever been known to win.</TE>
<TE>   By simply shifting new (401)k contributions into safer assets,
investors who now are fearful about stocks can sleep better at night
knowing that they have taken steps to safeguard more of their
portfolio in the long run.</TE>
<TE>   They also won't have to live with the fear that they might be
taking a big chunk of money out of stocks right before the market
recovers.</TE>
<TE>   * Realize that you may want to invest more in stocks now rather
than less. Once a year, investors should look at their 401(k)
balances and make sure that the percentages allocated to each asset
class still match their goals. This is called "rebalancing."</TE>
<TE>   Normal market gyrations often throw a portfolio off balance,
Pressman said. Given the stock market's two-year dive--the blue-chip
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 has fallen 26% this year alone--some investors
may find that they now have far less in stocks than they planned, as
a percentage of total assets, said Lori Lucas, a benefits consultant
with Hewitt in Lincolnshire, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   As painful as it might be to throw good money after bad, experts
maintain that it's usually wise to shift money out of asset classes
that have performed well recently into the areas that have performed
poorly. This is especially true for investors who have a long time
before retirement--say, 15 or 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Investing is counterintuitive," said Mark Brown, partner at
Denver planning and investment firm of Brown &amp; Tedstrom. "When things
are going lower, you are wringing risk out of the market, which makes
it a good time to buy. It is the essence of buying low and selling
high."</TE>
<TE>   * Boost your contributions to your plan. The average employee
contributes 7.5% of pay to a 401(k). The law allows workers to
contribute substantially more--usually about 15% of wages.</TE>
<TE>   The result of low contribution rates is that the median 401(k)
balance is less than half of one year's pay--clearly far too little
to supplement a comfortable retirement. What's more, some 30% of
active plan participants have saved less than $5,000 total, according
to the Hewitt study.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's tax law boosted the maximum amount individuals can
contribute to a 401(k) to $11,000 this year, from $10,500. In coming
years, the maximum contribution amounts will rise further.</TE>
<TE>   Why boost contributions? Even if stock market returns are subpar
for years to come, any returns are growing tax-deferred in a 401(k),
and that's a big advantage.</TE>
<TE>   If your employer matches any percentage of your contribution, the
more you pay in, the more your employer does as well. That's "free"
money--or lost money, if you don't take advantage of it.</TE>

<LD>Markets Tumble; Dow Closes Below Sept. Low</LD>
<LD>   The bears were in full force on Wall Street, as stocks suffered
severe declines and major indexes closed at multiyear lows amid fears
of further selling Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average crashed through its
post-terror-attack lows--the last major index to do so--in a
390-point sell-off Friday.</LD>
<TE>   It was the average's seventh biggest point-drop ever. Analysts
attributed the declines to Wall Street's unwillingness to make any
bets in a market that appears capable of falling further.</TE>
<TE>   The declines also gave the three major indexes their ninth
straight losing week.</TE>
<TE>   Investors, fed up with accounting scandals and concerned that
business isn't recovering strongly or quickly enough, have been
unloading shares for fear stock prices will continue to fall.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow finished the week at 8,019.26, putting the average 216
points beneath the Sept. 21 close after the terrorist attacks.</TE>

<TE>   Congress Deliberates on Corporate Reform</TE>
<TE>   Under pressure from the White House and the public to act on
corporate reform, House and Senate leaders began talks on the final
version of legislation to crack down on accounting abuses, and set a
goal of finishing work before Congress adjourns for its August
recess.</TE>
<TE>   House Republican leaders balked at speeding the process by simply
accepting the more stringent bill approved unanimously last week by
the Senate. Instead, they insisted on formal negotiations to
reconcile differences between the Senate bill and a measure the House
passed in April.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate bill would create an independent board to oversee the
accounting industry, limit the ability of accounting firms to do
consulting work for companies they audit, ban corporate loans to
company insiders and crack down on other business practices that
contributed to the scandals. It also would add new penalties for
fraud and make it easier to prosecute dishonest executives.</TE>
<TE>   The House bill also would create an accounting watchdog panel, but
its makeup and powers would differ from those proposed by the Senate.
The House bill did not include the stricter penalties for corporate
crime. However, the House passed a separate bill authorizing
increased penalties--going further than the Senate in some respects
and not as far in others.</TE>

<TE>   Greenspan Gives Upbeat View of Economy</TE>
<TE>   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said the nation's economic
recovery was on track, but warned Congress that corporate scandals
threaten to injure the economy and should be treated with stiff new
penalties for executives who cheat.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. economy is poised to resume a pattern of sustainable
growth," the central bank chairman said. But only, he added, after
current problems "linger for a bit longer ... and absent significant
further adverse shocks."</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan's remarks came as the Fed boosted its forecast of
economic growth for the year to as much as 3.75% from 2.5% to 3%.</TE>

<TE>   AOL Reorganizes Top Execs; Pittman Out</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner Inc. shook up its top management ranks in an
effort to breathe new life into a hybrid company that has seen its
vision for a digital future fade as its fortunes sank.</TE>
<TE>   The latest casualty of the company's miserable stock performance
was Robert W. Pittman, who resigned under pressure as chief operating
officer of the corporation and head of the struggling Internet
flagship, America Online. Pittman, 48, had been a key architect of
the merger between Internet giant AOL and entertainment powerhouse
Time Warner. Pittman's replacement by two veteran Time Warner
executives puts the old-media executives very much back in control
and leaves Chairman Steve Case without his closest ally.</TE>
<TE>   Richard D. Parsons, the Time Inc. veteran who took over as AOL
Time Warner chief executive in May, announced a new, two-legged
structure for the sprawling company, intended to restore some of the
autonomy stripped away by the merger. Don Logan, chairman and chief
executive of Time Inc., will head a new Media &amp; Communications Group
consisting of America Online, Time Inc., Time Warner Cable and the
AOL Time Warner Book Group and Interactive Video unit.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Bewkes, chairman and chief executive of HBO, will run the
new Entertainment &amp; Networks Group, including HBO, New Line Cinema,
the WB Network, Turner Networks, Warner Bros. and Warner Music. Both
executives will report directly to Parsons. And significantly,
analysts said, both men tend to let subordinates run their operations
as they see fit, providing that they produce results.</TE>

<TE>   Coke, Post to Expense Stock Options</TE>
<TE>   As corporate accounting scandals continued to roil the stock
market, Coca-Cola Co. and Washington Post Co. said they will count
employee stock options as normal business expenses, a move executives
hope will boost investor confidence.</TE>
<TE>   The move also may prompt other companies to follow suit.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, the use of stock options, once considered a
valuable tool to link the interests of corporate executives to those
of shareholders, has been cited as a potential culprit in the recent
spate of accounting debacles.</TE>
<TE>   Critics, including President Bush, have been looking for ways to
rein in the practice of providing top corporate managers with huge
grants of stock options, which give the right to buy company shares
at a set price in the future.</TE>

<TE>   Pfizer Agrees to Acquire Pharmacia</TE>
<TE>   Drug giant Pfizer Inc. agreed to acquire rival Pharmacia Inc. for
stock valued at nearly $60 billion, a deal that would create a
leading international pharmaceutical firm.</TE>
<TE>   Although investors, concerned about its price and timing, hammered
Pfizer's stock after learning of the deal, many analysts said the
deal made strategic sense and could be expected to trigger a round of
mergers as brand-name drug companies consolidate in the face of
pressure from cheap generic competition.</TE>
<TE>   Henry McKinnell, Pfizer's chief executive, would serve as chairman
and CEO of the new company; Fred Hassan, Pharmacia's chairman and
CEO, would be vice chairman and a board member.</TE>
<TE>   Pharmacia, formed by the mergers of Pharmacia of Sweden with
Upjohn and Monsanto, also would move ahead with previously announced
plans to spin off its remaining 84% ownership of Monsanto to its
current shareholders.</TE>

<TE>   Southland Home Prices Hit New Record</TE>
<TE>   Home prices surged in June to another record high across a wide
swath of the Southland as falling mortgage rates and a tight supply
of housing continued to boost property values.</TE>
<TE>   The median cost of a Los Angeles County home jumped 18% from a
year ago to $269,000, marking the eighth consecutive month that the
county set a record price, according to DataQuick Information Systems
Inc. In Orange County, the median price jumped 19% from a year ago to
$359,000, reflecting the sharpest rate of increase for any month
since May 1989, DataQuick said.</TE>

<TE>   Intel to Cut Jobs in Limp PC Market</TE>
<TE>   Intel Corp., still reeling from one of the chip industry's worst
downturns, posted anemic earnings and announced it would cut 4,000
jobs, or about 5% of its work force, by year-end.</TE>
<TE>   The cut, on top of 7,000 jobs eliminated last year, suggests the
worst is not over for the world's largest semiconductor maker.</TE>
<TE>   Emerging from a dismal 2001, Intel had joined numerous industry
analysts in projecting a rebound in the second half of the year.</TE>
<TE>   But corporations have been reluctant to upgrade their computers.
Intel, whose chips run eight of 10 personal computers, relies on the
strength of the PC market, which continues to sag.</TE>

<TE>   Aerospace Firms Post Strong Earnings</TE>
<TE>   Defense contractors, led by Northrop Grumman Corp., posted strong
second-quarter earnings as the industry continued to benefit from an
uptick in spending for weapons and homeland security after the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop, Boeing Co. and General Dynamics Corp., the nation's top
defense contractors, reported better-than-anticipated earnings,
fueled mainly by new contracts and increases in sales of certain arms
such as smart bombs, missiles and unmanned spy planes used in
military operations in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Lockheed Martin Corp. said second-quarter profit more than doubled
on increased sales of aircraft and because of a tax credit.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Auto Makers Post Upbeat Results</TE>
<TE>   Riding strong U.S. sales and aggressive cost management, General
Motors Corp. said it beat expectations and earned an operating profit
of $1.5 billion, or $2.63 a share. The results were about twice those
of last year's second quarter, when GM earned $766 million, or $1.37
a share.</TE>
<TE>   Emerging from its disastrous financial performance last year, Ford
Motor Co. said it turned a profit in the second quarter and probably
would earn "a modest profit" for the year.</TE>
<TE>   And the struggling Chrysler Group finally broke into net
profitability in the second quarter, spurring its parent company,
DaimlerChrysler, to a 52% leap in profit and to increase its earnings
forecast for the full year.</TE>

<TE>   Deutsche Telekom Chief Resigns Under Pressure</TE>
<TE>   Deutsche Telekom Chief Executive Ron Sommer resigned, driven out
of one of Germany's top executive posts by election-year politics and
angry shareholders who have watched the stock fall 90% from its peak.</TE>
<TE>   The telecommunications giant's supervisory board named former
Chairman Helmut Sihler interim chief executive. The 72-year-old
confirmed that his chief task would be to find a long-term solution
to the leadership problem.</TE>

<HD>1995 Tort Reform Act Said to Provide Safe Harbor for Fraud</HD>
<DH>Legislation: Critics say curbs on shareholder suits have
contributed to the rash of scandals, but some lawmakers still stand
behind the law.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A controversial law, passed in 1995 to curb shareholder lawsuits, is
under attack for contributing to corporate fraud and possibly
allowing alleged wrongdoers to avoid liability. But efforts to repeal
or modify the law are meeting stiff resistance.</LD>
<LD>   Consumer advocates and corporate governance experts say the tort
reform legislation raised the burden of proof for lawsuits against
corporations that mislead shareholders--weakening an important
deterrent against corporate fraud.</LD>
<LD>   Loopholes in the legislation also could allow former Enron Corp.
Chief Executive Kenneth L. Lay, wayward accounting firms and other
alleged scofflaws to avoid liability for shareholder losses.</LD>
<TE>   "We in 1995 said this is going to create fraud like we've never
seen before, and I would say our predictions came true," said Sally
Greenberg, a lawyer for Consumers Union.</TE>
<TE>   Yet lawmakers, poised to send to the White House the most sweeping
financial reforms since the 1930s, have rebuffed efforts to restore
most shareholder rights lost to securities tort reform. Many of the
lawmakers, both Democrat and Republican, who supported the
legislation several years ago remain in Congress and continue to back
their handiwork.</TE>
<TE>   "It never made a good suit impossible," said Rep. W.J. "Billy"
Tauzin (R-La.), who wrote the legislation and stands behind it as he
leads congressional investigations of possible corporate wrongdoing.
"It was not about giving bad corporate officials any breaks. It was
never about that."</TE>
<TE>   The legislation was passed as part of the pro-business,
Republican-led Contract With America reforms that swept Congress in
the mid-1990s under the leadership of then-House Speaker Newt
Gingrich.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation, called the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act, was advanced by a coalition of hundreds of large corporations,
led by accounting and high-tech firms, in an effort to curtail
so-called strike suits.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers were filing strike suits as soon as a stock price dropped
precipitously, often without evidence of wrongdoing, corporations
said. Tort reform proponents said the suits were legal fishing
expeditions designed to shake down corporate targets for settlements,
which could drain profitability and deter the kind of risk-taking
that is essential to expand a business.</TE>
<TE>   Major consumer, senior citizen and labor organizations opposed the
measure, viewing it with alarm as a powerful hunk of legal kryptonite
that would hurt shareholders and open U.S. markets to unprecedented
chicanery. They said the regressive measure would make even the most
worthy shareholder suits difficult to mount.</TE>
<TE>   John Bryant, a Dallas trial lawyer and former Democratic
congressman who opposed the bill, said it passed--even though many of
his colleagues had reservations--in a legislative and economic
environment that was almost the opposite of what it is today.</TE>
<TE>   "It was completely counterintuitive to pass this bill," he said.
"It was passed in a frenzy of ideological zeal with Silicon Valley
throwing gasoline on. Arthur Andersen was aggressively lobbying for
this bill. Andersen was way out front.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody knew it was a bad idea, and they succeeded in
overriding [then-President Clinton's] veto and did so with the help
of a lot of Democrats who were scared and running for cover. The
economy was flying high, and they were afraid to be seen as not
trying to help out."</TE>
<TE>   Curbing Strike Suits</TE>
<TE>   But Tauzin said the bill passed with overwhelming bipartisan
support because lawmakers wanted to stop strike suits, which he
described as "nothing but blackmail." He said rolling back the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act would not deter corporate
crime.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Tauzin said, he supports reforms that encourage the
imposition of prison time and more vigorous efforts by the Securities
and Exchange Commission to force corporate criminals to pay back
victims with ill-gotten gains.</TE>
<TE>   "The answer is to get the money back into the hands of the
corporations and the shareholders, rather than the lawyers," he said.
"When a corporation gets shaken down by strike suits, the shareholder
gets hurt."</TE>
<TE>   But Bryant said increasing the prison sentences attached to
corporate crimes is not enough to deter them.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys don't go pull the penal code off the wall and say, 'Oh
my goodness--the penalty has gone from five to 10 years. I'd better
not do this,' " he said. "What they do look at is, 'Oh my God. If I
do this, I will lose everything. I better not do this.' "</TE>
<TE>   One loophole in the '95 reform act, known as the safe harbor
provision, shields executives from liability for knowingly making
overly rosy projections about their corporations--as long as they
include a disclaimer. Lay and others are using the provision in their
efforts to fend off shareholder lawsuits, citing it in pending
motions to dismiss.</TE>
<TE>   Suits on Record Pace</TE>
<TE>   The fact that Enron shareholder targets are wrapping themselves in
the safe harbor provision is ample reason to revisit the reform act,
said Rep. Bart Stupak (D-Mich.), one of several lawmakers who have
waged unsuccessful attempts to dismantle the law.</TE>
<TE>   "This was their big effort to end all frivolous lawsuits," Stupak
said. "But what it really did was shred investor rights."</TE>
<TE>   Architects of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act point
to an increase in securities fraud settlement amounts as evidence
that shareholders have not been shut out of the courthouse.
Shareholder suits are on a record pace this year.</TE>
<TE>   "In cases with real fraud, the settlements went up, and the
frivolous suits are dismissed," said Mark Gitenstein, a Washington
lawyer who pushed for the law and now is representing Andersen.
"There aren't any serious changes in the PSLRA that are going to take
place because there is not evidence that there should be. This
argument that the PSLRA made Enron possible is ludicrous."</TE>
<TE>   Others said the rise in the number of lawsuits instead may be a
measure of a greater incidence of fraud fueled, at least in part, by
the handcuffs tort reform put on shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   "The current spate of scandals is consistent with this argument
that the 1995 act overshot in terms of its permissiveness," said USC
law professor Eric Talley, who has studied the law's effects. "It
most certainly set the table for those sorts of activities to occur."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecution Not Enough</TE>
<TE>   Corporate governance experts said they were encouraged by
congressional reform proposals. But, they said, improved regulation
and government prosecution are not enough.</TE>
<TE>   "The SEC will always have to watch too many companies to be able
to really know what's going on at every firm," said Jennifer Arlen, a
New York University law professor who specializes in securities
fraud. "And one always has the problem that the SEC will be
vulnerable to a kind of political pressure that plaintiffs' lawyers
are not."</TE>
<TE>   But Joseph Grundfest, a Stanford University professor and
securities law expert, said it is not clear that shareholder lawsuits
act as a deterrent to corporate malfeasance. Most major instances of
fraud are discovered and reported by the companies or by an acquiring
company, he said. And shareholder lawsuits rarely result in the
perpetrators themselves paying damages.</TE>
<TE>   "Shareholders get paid out of insurance policies and out of
corporate coffers, so shareholders end up paying themselves out of
their own corporations, and the lawyers end up getting paid a third,"
Grundfest said. "The two factors that would lead to deterrence--the
probability of detection and personal liability--plaintiffs' lawyers
don't do."</TE>
<TE>   The Senate reform bill would extend the statute of limitations for
shareholder suits and seek a study of enforcement efforts against
accountants, investment bankers, lawyers and other corporate advisors
who aided and abetted fraud. But shareholder advocates said those
steps are not enough.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.) proposed the study after he was
unable to get a hearing on his investor protection bill, which would
have repealed much of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-Lawyer Sentiment</TE>
<TE>   Congressional observers said securities tort reform faces several
obstacles. It may be too complex, they said, for lawmakers to wade
through while they are still reeling from and reacting to the Enron
meltdown and subsequent almost daily announcements of new corporate
accounting scandals.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts also are hung up on the fact that shareholders would not
be the only beneficiaries of a reform of securities litigation rules.
"The anti-trial-lawyer feeling in the Congress is so great that it's
in the way," said former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is taking no chances. Its president
and chief executive, Thomas J. Donohue, issued a statement this month
saying the organization would fight attempts to "expose companies to
unfair attacks by trial lawyers."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the safe harbor shield for false corporate
projections, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act raised the
bar on shareholder lawsuits by requiring plaintiffs to provide
evidence at the time of filing showing how the defendants defrauded
investors and that they did so with intent or reckless disregard for
the truth.</TE>
<TE>   The act granted defendant corporations a stay on discovery as soon
as they file motions to dismiss. This took away shareholders' primary
vehicle for investigating their suspicions and created a unique
Catch-22, lawyers said. Without specific evidence of the alleged
wrongdoing and the defendants' intent, shareholder suits face
dismissal before they have a chance to review corporate documents
that might bolster their claims.</TE>
<TE>   The act also came under attack for what it left out. The reform
act debate came several months after the Supreme Court, in a 5-4
decision, took away from shareholders the right--granted by the 1934
Securities Exchange Act--to name accountants, lawyers, bankers and
other advisors as aiders and abettors in fraud suits. Congress
restored that right to the SEC, but declined to do the same for
shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   Initially at least, shareholders found a way around the reform
act's higher standards, taking their grievances to state courts. But
Congress shut down this end-run in 1998 with a follow-up law.</TE>

<HD>A Leap From Cyber Cool to Corporate Conformity</HD>
<DH>Freewheeling Yahoo has grown up, trading youthful
exuberance for the stability of profitability</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Henry Sohn joined Yahoo Inc. in 1996, when Nerf-gun fights were
frequent and the long hours spent at the online portal constituted a
labor of love.</LD>
<LD>   Vast fortunes from stock options were not far off. Everyone shared
a tireless dedication to enhancing the user experience, and, yes, to
changing the world. At least it seemed that way.</LD>
<LD>   "We were deluged with requests from companies who wanted to
understand what we were doing and how we were doing it," said Sohn,
Yahoo's 50th employee and now vice president of network services. "We
were having an impact everywhere."</LD>
<TE>   Yahoo still thinks big. But in today's depressed online market,
talk about changing the world has been overtaken by a feverish
dedication to something more basic--turning a profit.</TE>
<TE>   Now that the new economy is not so new, Yahoo's leaders are trying
to craft a sustainable business model in a business that is still
making itself up as it goes along.</TE>
<TE>   "In the early days, there was not a real strong need to prioritize
growth," said Susan Decker, Yahoo's chief financial officer. Now
services are carefully vetted for their potential to generate
revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "We [want] to get deeper into those users' hearts, minds and
hopefully their pocketbooks," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Yahoo's transformation from geek hobby to corporate conformist
symbolizes the life cycle of the Internet economy. Although it has
managed to eke out profits while other sites went belly up, the
freewheeling Yahoo that Sohn and other early employees joined exists
largely as a memory.</TE>
<TE>   The company's revamped home page, launched July 1, symbolizes that
shift. The changes seem subtle at first, but on close examination
they are substantial: Fee-based personal ad listings, shopping and
music downloads are front and center; free news and search services
that form the core of the Yahoo experience for most users are pushed
down the page.</TE>
<TE>   The new pragmatism was inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   "The Web used to be a cool, alternative media source--now the
Internet is mainstream," said Patrick Keane, an Internet analyst with
Jupiter Media Metrix. "We're talking about a medium that has 60%
penetration of the U.S. audience. It's closer to cable [TV] every
day."</TE>
<TE>   And Yahoo has become more like a typical TV network.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past, Yahoo was seen as this
Stanford-computer-science-altruist company," Keane said. "Now they
are clearly out to exploit consumers."</TE>
<TE>   For investors, at least, that may be great news.</TE>
<TE>   After six consecutive quarterly losses amid the carnage of the
Internet advertising market, Yahoo announced a modest profit for its
second quarter: $21.4 million, or 3 cents a share, contrasted with a
loss of $48.5 million, or 9 cents a share, in the period a year
before. Revenue rose to $225.8 million from $182.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Some wonder whether the online pioneer--despite on-again,
off-again rumors that it will be acquired by a larger media
company--might be finding a model for stability.</TE>
<TE>   New Business Plan</TE>
<TE>   That was precisely the goal when former Warner Bros. Co-Chief
Executive Terry Semel was hired as Yahoo's CEO a little more than a
year ago amid the steep decline of the Internet economy. He was
charged with developing a new business plan for the ad-dependent
site--based largely on selling services to consumers and
corporations.</TE>
<TE>   The company's Sunnyvale, Calif., campus, which it moved into
shortly before Semel arrived, is dotted with volleyball nets,
espresso bars and park-like courtyards--all purchased during the
heady days when Yahoo's market value exceeded $100 billion. At its
Friday closing stock price of $13.37 per share, Yahoo is worth $8
billion.</TE>
<TE>   In the old days, people would work until 10 p.m., then go to an
adjacent field for a pick-up soccer game to blow off steam. Those
days are gone.</TE>
<TE>   "It's part of growing up," Sohn said, but Nerf-gun skirmishes,
such as a recent battle involving 50 engineers, still erupt on
occasion.</TE>
<TE>   But even as Semel tolerated Yahoo's youthful exuberance, he reined
in the company's occasional excesses--such as its Christmas party.
The 2000 holiday bash, at the height of the dot-com boom, featured
four live bands and unlimited oysters on the half shell. Employees
drank their martinis extra cold--they were poured through holes in
bars carved from ice.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Semel's first at the company, layoffs hit a few days
before Christmas. Many employees decided to skip the scaled-back and
decidedly somber holiday affair.</TE>
<TE>   Semel also curtailed the company's freewheeling tendency to
finance any new project that sounded cool. And he adopted a
hard-nosed approach to Yahoo's business and image:</TE>
<TE>   * Last fall, a pay-for-position policy was instituted at Yahoo's
search service--long touted as the company's pristine, noncommercial
core and its raison d'etre as an honest broker of information. Now
advertisers rise to the top of Yahoo's search results.</TE>
<TE>   * In March, Yahoo changed its privacy policy, giving itself
permission to deluge tens of millions of registered users with
marketing pitches.</TE>
<TE>   * In April, the company began charging for e-mail--the staple of
the bygone "information wants to be free" era. Now frequent users of
Yahoo e-mail pay $29.99 a year.</TE>
<TE>   * In June, Yahoo suspended its Internet radio service and in-house
financial news production--pioneering services that never paid their
way.</TE>
<TE>   Semel, who declined to be interviewed for this report, gradually
has replaced Yahoo's youthful executive corps with business
graybeards--such as former Warner Bros. executive Jim Moloshok, a
Semel confidant who heads Yahoo's media and information division.</TE>
<TE>   He also has pushed edgy advertising initiatives that began before
his arrival. Yahoo users have seen animated Ford Explorer SUVs and
Pizza Hut pizza slices traversing the once sacrosanct home page.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the clearest sign of the graying of Yahoo's purple and
yellow logo is the demise of Yahoo Internet Life--a print magazine
published by Ziff Davis Media Inc. that was devoted to the fun,
fantasy and novelty of the Yahoo experience. The magazine folded this
month despite a circulation of 1.1 million, a victim of the declining
ad market.</TE>
<TE>   Attracting 'Eyeballs'</TE>
<TE>   Yahoo began as the classic Silicon Valley grad-student experiment
and rapidly became an overnight media titan during the Internet land
grab. During the late '90s, everything revolved around quickly
building an audience. Success was measured in "eyeballs"--the number
of people looking at the site.</TE>
<TE>   Sohn was brought into the company to help launch Yahoo's Japanese
site. On his first day, March 4, 1996, he was told "By way, you have
until April 1 to launch it," Sohn said. "That was pretty typical of
the time frame we were looking at ....There was a lot of low-hanging
fruit."</TE>
<TE>   But sites had to grab it before someone else did.</TE>
<TE>   "That game is over. And Yahoo would probably accurately claim that
they won, with something like 200 million worldwide users," said Safa
Raschtchy, an analyst with US Bancorp Piper Jaffray.</TE>
<TE>   Yahoo survived the devastating dot-com bust--while once-gigantic
competitors such as Excite.com and Go.com failed--with its momentum
and sheer scale, said Stanford business school professor Joel Hyatt.</TE>
<TE>   "As one of the few icons of the Internet age," Yahoo survived
"long enough to reinvent themselves--or at least adjust," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The company has entered a long-predicted but uncharted challenge
of the new-economy life cycle--how to become an Internet-based
business that can last for the long run.</TE>
<TE>   This means adding services that users will pay for.</TE>
<TE>   In February Yahoo purchased HotJobs.com, a major source of online
classified revenue, and has partnered with SBC Communications Inc. to
sell access services, an effort to cash in on the potentially
lucrative market for high-speed Internet links.</TE>
<TE>   Fees and services account for about 40% of Yahoo's revenue base,
up from about 10% only two years ago, though a big part of the change
is from a precipitous drop-off in ads.</TE>
<TE>   A Model for the Future</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say it's too soon to tell whether Yahoo is developing
genuine stability, or whether it can survive at all as an
Internet-only player in a world of diversified media giants.</TE>
<TE>   "Traditional media companies should not take satisfaction in the
difficulties of a Yahoo or even an AOL. The same challenges await
them as more mainstream consumers increasingly use digital
technology," said Chris Charron, an analyst with Forrester Research.
"They are laying the groundwork of a new-media model for the future."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, some who experienced the full bloom of boundless
expectations feel bitter about what might have been.</TE>
<TE>   "Wall Street put pressure on companies to do dumb stuff, like
giving things away all the time," said a former Yahoo executive who
left before the steep downturn had run its course, and declined to be
named. "Then Wall Street demanded both predicable business models and
increasing revenues and profits.</TE>
<TE>   "So rather than exploring their businesses, companies quickly
moved into what may have been the wrong business."</TE>
<TE>   Yahoo weathered that irrational storm, said the former executive,
but at great cost.</TE>
<TE>   "Yahoo could have built one of the great brands of all time. Now
they are just another little company," he said. "What a waste."</TE>

<LD>Re "Transforming a Symbol of Tragedy," July 17:</LD>
<LD>   I'm calling for everyone's support to reject all six proposals for
rebuilding at the World Trade Center site. They have some merit in
that they all incorporate a large, green memorial park. However, none
of them propose a building as high as the soaring 110-story twin
towers.</LD>
<LD>   Why are Americans cowering in the face of terror? Rebuild the
towers as big, if not bigger, than before. That is the American way.</LD>

<HD>Taking Stock of CEOs' Options</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "House, Senate Leaders Move on an Accounting Bill," July 18: If
Congress really wants to reform corporate America it must eliminate
stock options for corporate executives. These options for executives
are equivalent to giving them the keys to the greenback vault. These
same executives who are privy to insider information are committing a
crime if they exercise the options, under the insider laws.</LD>
<LD>   If members of a company's board of directors feel that some
executives should have a compensation increase, let them give it in
the form of a bonus, the same as to the blue-collar guy. If they
retain the stock-option plan for employees in the blue-collar ranks,
all well and good. Above all, the company must claim this as an
expense. Should we head into a double-digit recession and probable
depression--along with confusion and terror in the market--abuse of
the stock-option plan and just plain greed will be the main reasons.</LD>

<TE>   It took much gall and very little dignity to publish "For CEOs
It's a Lot Lonelier at the Top" (July 18). In the past 30 years we
have watched the gap between CEOs and their workers increase over a
thousandfold. We have seen the decline of the middle class and the
rapid separation between rich and poor. We have had unprecedented tax
cuts for the wealthiest people in America, while the minimum wage
continues to decline in value. Now we are supposed to find sympathy
for these super-rich members of the elite because they feel
embarrassed to identify themselves as CEOs when vacationing in Hawaii
in the wake of recent business scandals?</TE>

<TE>   CEOs are not satisfied with just power, perks and lavish (even

we give them that, it won't be long before attorneys and politicians

somewhere!</TE>

<TE>   So, President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney want to increase
criminal penalties whenever corporate executives are found to have
committed fraud, insider trading, obstruction of justice and all of
the other criminal acts out of what Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan calls "infectious greed" ("Scandals Called a Threat to
Recovery," July 17).</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, I have watched my 401(k) savings plummet by
$15,000 over the last six months while executives from Enron, Global
Crossing, WorldCom and Halliburton are being allowed to keep hundreds
of millions of loot they cashed in. And some took jobs in the Bush
administration. Special prosecutor, anyone?</TE>

<TE>   Re "Cheney's Grimy Trail in Business," Commentary, July 16:</TE>
<TE>   Robert Scheer's commentaries usually try to hustle sound thinkers.
During this week's game of editorial three-card monte, he indicts the
Bush administration (again) because of the vice president's business
history. But follow the con game closer: Scheer can't actually blame
Bush for the lies, corruption and greed that Wall Street began to
instigate in the '90s.</TE>
<TE>   Liberals back then excused lying and fraudulent financial
statements--as exemplified by the Democrats and their illegal
campaign cash. "Everybody does it" was the justification, and
Clinton's White House led the orgy of irrational exuberance. Bush
arrived after the wild party had trashed Wall Street, and liberals
want to fine him for littering.</TE>

<TE>   The amount Bush sold his Harken stock for: $850,000. Cheney's
final-year payoff at Halliburton: a package valued at $34 million.

events: priceless.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I can't be the only one who remembers that the press insisted that
Cheney couldn't represent the people if he had all those stock
options. So he sells what he can and forfeits the ones that are not
available yet. So in that way there was a loss. Now the media are all
over him for selling the stuff they wanted him to sell. Get a grip
and get over it. Why don't the media check into any Democrats? Oh, I
forgot; only Republicans do bad things.</TE>

<TE>   If Bush doesn't cut the rhetoric and get this corporate thievery
mess settled immediately, his well is going to run dry mighty fast.

stability of this country on a solid footing--action will. The
American people want action now.</TE>

<HD>Anger and Grief Over Killing of an Innocent</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The abduction and murder of 5-year-old Samantha Runnion made me
angrier than any crime in my recent memory (July 18). It was a cold,
calculated, brutal and senseless murder of an innocent child. Even as
an African American, it strengthens my belief in the death penalty.
For in crimes like this, children, the most innocent among us,
haven't the capacity to defend themselves. One can only imagine the
pain, suffering and agony she went through.</LD>
<LD>   I found it almost unbearable to watch as her mother, in the depth
of her pain, anguish and sorrow, pleaded for her safe return on TV on
Tuesday, to no avail. One can only imagine the lifetime emotional
devastation that she and everyone else connected with this young girl
will experience from this heinous act.</LD>
<LD>   I pray to God this perpetrator receives his just reward: death.
For it'll be a sad day if we ever come to a consensus in this country
that justice for a person who commits a crime such as this is three
meals a day for the remainder of his life, all at taxpayers' expense.</LD>

<TE>   In Texas, there is a system called Amber Alert [America's Missing
Broadcast Emergency Response], named for a little girl who was a
victim in 1996. Several children victimized in Texas have been found
alive. The news must get out in those first few hours after a child
is taken--while the dirty dog is on the road after taking his victim.
Drivers listening to their radios can look around for a blue Camaro
or a black Ford or a person fitting the description with a child in
the vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Let's get a similar law put into effect. If even one or two
children can be saved, it is worth the effort. Next time it might be
your child, grandchild or neighbor who could be saved.</TE>

child's life is lost?"</TE>
<TE>   A partial explanation as to why this nation can do one but not the
other is that the ACLU has yet to see that it needs to protect the
rights of warm engines or invisible planets. But hang on ... you

<HD>Focus on Israel, Not 'Jew-Hatred'</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Call It What It Is: a Global Surge of Anti-Semitism," Commentary,
July 17: Yossi Klein Halevi wrote a brilliant piece bringing our
attention to what he identifies as "Jew-hatred." He even anticipates
and inoculates his argument against the obvious criticisms, yet he
succeeds only in citing as examples of anti-Semitism the actions of
very few individuals and fewer states or institutions.</LD>
<LD>   Far from denying the Holocaust, which is Halevi's corollary
charge, I imagine that having survived that horrible period, when
anti-Semitism was not just a notion of a few ignorant zealots but the
overt policy of more than a few governments and an operative
undercurrent even in the U.S., Jews everywhere might accept as
incumbent upon themselves the principles of compassion, tolerance,
peace and nonviolence.</LD>
<LD>   Since Halevi writes that it is legitimate to criticize specific
Israeli policies, why don't we (why doesn't he?) take active
exception to Israel's policies of extrajudicial executions,
preemptive strikes, torture of detainees, suppression of
international media and flouting of U.N. resolutions, for starters?</LD>
<TE>   It is idiotic and futile, not to mention barbaric and against the
spirit of Islam, for suicide bombers to continue their ignorant
violence against Israelis. Israel has exercised an iron fist for
decades and is showing no signs of unclenching. Has anybody noticed
that neither strategy is working? Do Israelis or Palestinians enjoy
peace and security? One definition of insanity is said to be to
repeat an action but to expect a different result.</TE>

<TE>   The subheading on the commentary on the recent anti-Semitic
killings and rhetoric all over the world so frankly states: "Amid
blindness to hate crimes, something familiar and sinister is
arising." Well, I can truly and sadly attest to the validity of this
comment.</TE>
<TE>   I am a Jewish woman who, as a child, survived the Nazi Holocaust
in Europe. Unfortunately my six siblings, mother and father did not.
While all this was going on, the world turned a blind eye. Frankly, I
never dreamed that I would witness a similar pattern during my
lifetime. I am concerned for everyone! That includes my five
grandchildren and their parents.</TE>
<TE>   What is so disturbing is that our U.S. officials refuse to call
the terrorists what they are--terrorists. I believe that they should
know better.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I would like to thank you for printing Sandy Goodman's July 17
commentary, "Air Force Dodges Sept. 11 Flak," which finds fault with
the lack of response from the U.S. Air Force on Sept. 11. To this
day, I am shocked and outraged by the inactivity demonstrated by the
Air Force in failing to protect our nation's capital on that tragic
day.</LD>
<LD>   While the two separate attacks in New York came as a big surprise,
one would think our government would, at the very least, have had the
common sense to have fighter jets protecting the skies over
Washington, particularly since more than an hour had elapsed from the
time the FAA discovered that planes had been hijacked until the
Pentagon was hit.</LD>
<LD>   It does not take a Rhodes scholar to realize that New York City,
Washington and California, in no particular order, are the three most
likely terrorist targets in this country, does it?</LD>
<TE>   Of course, the public will never be given a much-deserved
explanation as to what really went wrong on that day, given the Bush
administration's desire to blame others and for its policy of
operating in secrecy.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Joan Bentler's students at Bassett Street Elementary in Van Nuys like
the following park rides.</LD>
<LD>   * My favorite is the Log Ride at Knott's Berry Farm. It makes me
feel tiny. I would recommend this ride to a friend because when it's
hot, they could cool off. The ride is fast, and it goes up and down.
I got wet from my head to my shoes! When I got off, I couldn't walk.
(Karla, 8)</LD>
<LD>   * My favorite ride is the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland. It makes
me feel spooky because there are a lot of ghosts. (Fabiola, 7)</LD>
<TE>   * My favorite ride is Jurassic Park at Universal Studios. It makes
me feel scared. I thought I was going to be eaten by a T. rex. It
popped out so fast it scared me. You go down fast. I thought I was
going to fall off the seat. (Daniel, 8)</TE>
<TE>   * My favorite ride is Deja Vu at Six Flags Magic Mountain because
it makes me feel so cool. It goes back and forth. I would recommend
this ride on hot days. (Luis, 8)</TE>
<TE>   * My favorite ride is the Mummy Returns at Universal Studios
because there are a lot of mummies that are scary. I feel afraid when
I ride it. It is scary and fun too. (Isla, 8)</TE>
<TE>   * My favorite ride is the Disneyland Railroad. It makes me feel
happy. (Leonor, 8)</TE>
<TE>   * My favorite is High Extreme at Raging Waters because it goes
fast. It makes me feel dizzy and great because it is colorful and
makes my heart go down. It is good for a hot day. (Kristen, 8)</TE>
<TE>   * My favorite ride is Back to the Future. It makes me dizzy. It's
at Universal Studios. I'll go back to the ride on a hot day because
it has fresh, cool air. (Ronny, 8)</TE>
<TE>   * My favorite ride is Jurassic Park, the Ride. I saw a raptor, and
everyone looked up at the T. rex. It made me feel like I was going to
die or be eaten. I liked it because I like going really high, then
down really fast. (Carlos, 8)</TE>

<TE>   "Rufferella"</TE>
<TE>   by Vanessa Gill-Brown and Mandy Stanley</TE>
<TE>   Rufferella is a dog but wants to be like all the other kids. She
especially wants to be a real girl. One day, Rufferella's owner,
Diamante, figured out she was sad because she wanted to be a girl.
Diamante dressed Rufferella with clothes girls would wear and put
makeup on her so she could look kind of like a human. In the end, all
of Diamante's friends liked Rufferella. She even had a birthday
party. But she realized she didn't want to be a girl anymore, so
Diamante took off Rufferella's clothes and makeup so she could be a
normal-looking dog again.</TE>

<HD>Hollywood's Other Walk of Fame</HD>
<DH>For the studios, it's not a movie happening without a red
strip of carpet, glitz and lots of yelling</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GINA PICCALO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The movie star is expected any minute. A thicket of bright lights,
boom mikes and TV cameras are sprouting in front of the theater in
Beverly Hills. Autograph seekers are poised to strike. A city police
officer in a wide-brimmed hat paces the sidewalk, his mustache
twitching as he surveys the scene. "Three, two, one," a TV reporter
counts down to her cameraman. "Thanks, Debbie! I'm here on the red
carpet .... "</LD>
<LD>   Suddenly, several men in suits rush an arriving limousine as if
there's a life-threatening emergency. Chatty reporters hush and crane
toward the action. A limo door opens, the storm of shouts and
flashbulbs erupts. "To your right! Tom! To your right!" Tom Hanks has
arrived.</LD>
<LD>   It's Hollywood's ubiquitous red carpet, the carefully executed
promenade that precedes every awards show, gala affair and movie
premiere, in this case, "The Road to Perdition." Studios can spend
millions of dollars for this one-night-only fanfare, an event that
some consider an expensive exercise in celebrity worship that
ultimately does little to boost box-office revenues. But others in
the industry say the red carpet is as vital as the movie itself. It's
Hollywood's security blanket, they say, a reassuring tradition for an
industry consumed by anxiety.</LD>
<TE>   For celebrities, though, the red carpet can be surreal. "It's like
being on acid," says Hanks, as microphones are thrust into his face.
"The first time ... you feel as though the attention is somehow
warranted and everyone has a true, genuine fascination with what you
have to say."</TE>
<TE>   And now?</TE>
<TE>   "It's something to be survived. It's just a goofy, more fun way of
getting into the theater. None of it matters."</TE>
<TE>   With that, he is off to the next reporter, who drills him on what
he got for his birthday.</TE>
<TE>   Photo Ops</TE>
<TE>   Celebrities attend premieres primarily to get their pictures
taken. Those images, according to their publicists, communicate an
actor's relevancy to the world. "You want to be in people's
mind-set," said Stan Rosenfield, publicist to Robert De Niro, Will
Smith and George Clooney. "You want people to know you are part of
the dynamics of the evening." Those who refuse to pose for
photographers, such as Britney Spears at the recent opening of her
New York restaurant, are roundly booed.</TE>
<TE>   Photographers on the red carpet can be a rowdy bunch. "They yell
... because they need the star to look in their lens," People
magazine reporter Mike Fleeman said. They are often separated from
the rest of the media because they require sturdier barriers. Angry
shoving matches break out if a newcomer tries to horn in on an
old-timer's spot. Twenty-year red carpet photographer Steve Granitz,
whose company WireImage.com sells thousands of photos to scores of
publications each month, is always in the front row. Celebrities know
him as the voice shouting "It's me! It's me!" in attempt to make eye
contact. "I have my little gimmicks," Granitz said. "You want them to
laugh."</TE>
<TE>   These attempts at joviality are motivated by money. One photo can
earn thousands of dollars and sell for many years, like the one of
Tom Cruise and Frank Sinatra taken at the Beverly Hilton in the
mid-1980s or another of Madonna posing in her "Evita" garb at the
film's 1996 premiere in Los Angeles, Granitz said. "The life of a
photograph is a lot longer than a sound bite," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Reporters are granted positions according to their relationship
with the studio and they lord over these tiny squares of space.
"Entertainment Tonight" is always first, followed by "Access
Hollywood" and E! Entertainment Television. All three are often
elevated above the rest of the crowd on special platforms while
scores of local and foreign television crews fight below them over
camera positions. "There's a pecking order," Rosenfield said. "The
further down on the red carpet, the less dominant."</TE>
<TE>   Reporters pass the time waiting for celebrities by exchanging
gossip and catty remarks, sometimes within earshot of the actors. At
the June premiere of "Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys," two female
reporters scrutinized 17-year-old actress Jena Malone on the carpet.
She wore a skimpy dress held together with safety pins. "She's so
young!" one said. "That's why she's wearing that dress," said the
other. At the premiere of "The Mexican," two reporters made bets on
whether one young male star was stoned.</TE>
<TE>   For the behind-the-scenes film folks, winning the media's
attention is often a cruel sport on the carpet. At the premiere of
the skateboarding documentary "Dogtown and Z-Boys," a reporter for
ESPN's youth-oriented "extreme" sports show passed on speaking with
one middle-aged woman involved with the film. "We'd talk to her, but
she doesn't fit our demo."</TE>
<TE>   Waste of Time, Money?</TE>
<TE>   The red carpet tradition is a vulgar waste of time and money, say
some publicity executives from several major studios. (None of those
execs was be willing to be named for this story.) Studios devote
entire departments to the planning of movie premieres, yet the events
contribute virtually nothing to the overall revenues of a picture,
they claim. The invited media outlets rarely have the same
demographic that a film is targeting. "If you never had another movie
premiere again, you wouldn't see the grosses on a single movie
affected," one executive said.</TE>
<TE>   The stories from a movie premiere that get the widest distribution
often have little or nothing to do with the film. At the premiere of
"Windtalkers," for instance, the story beamed around the world was
that Lisa Marie Presley and Nicolas Cage had reunited. Reporters at
"The Others" waited breathlessly to see the newly divorced Tom Cruise
(the movie's co-producer) and Nicole Kidman (its star) in the same
room together.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, say some studio publicity executives, who are resigned
to the tradition, the studio has premieres to demonstrate its support
to the filmmaker. "It's stroking the ego ..." one said. "It's a
political thing."</TE>
<TE>   Other studio execs, however, defend the premiere as an integral
part of Hollywood culture. "That's where the tapestry of life in the
entertainment industry gets woven," a studio executive said. "It's
necessary for there to be that kind of cross-pollination of people to
see each other and acknowledge each other's accomplishments."</TE>
<TE>   No Expense Spared</TE>
<TE>   All the fanfare doesn't come cheap. The bill starts at $250,000,
and the sky's the limit for the premiere of a major studio film.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Touchstone Pictures, a division of Walt Disney Studios,
spent about $5 million for the "Pearl Harbor" premiere aboard a
nuclear-powered aircraft carrier docked at Pearl Harbor in Honolulu.
Disney footed air fare and hotel accommodations for scores of
reporters, who ended up lining a 1,740-foot red carpet that Disney
claimed was one of the longest in movie history.</TE>
<TE>   In June, Columbia Pictures spent around $1 million for the "Men in
Black II" premiere. The studio commandeered the amusement park on the
Santa Monica Pier and gave hundreds of guests tokens for games and
rides.</TE>
<TE>   For event engineer John Chuck, "red carpets" generate about $3.5
million a year for his North Hollywood company Entertainment Lighting
Services. Chuck is the man who lays the carpet, hires security,
negotiates street and sidewalk closures, redirects bus routes,
compensates merchants for lost business and pays the city for
occupied parking meters. He also provides bleachers and metal
barriers for media and fans, and positions photographers and TV crews
to capture the film title with every shutter. The roots of his
business stretch back 85 years, to a company founded in 1917 by Otto
K. Olesen, among the first to use searchlights at premieres.</TE>
<TE>   "The premiere business today is like night and day from where it
started," Chuck said. During the 1960s, Chuck lugged the same short
piece of red wool carpeting to every event. A truck equipped with a
generator and a few lights was parked in front of the theater along
with a couple of anti-aircraft searchlights. By the late 1960s, the
proliferation of synthetics made red carpet more available. "Now we
use miles of it," Chuck said.</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear how red carpets were introduced to the movie
premiere. Some say studio chiefs wanted to treat their stars to the
same honor bestowed upon bona fide royalty. Movie house developer Sid
Grauman is said to have introduced the concept of a movie premiere in
1916 in San Francisco when he informally invited local business
owners near his theater to stand outside and watch stars arrive for
the film opening. During the 1920s and 1930s, he earned fame with
elaborate lighting and outrageous publicity stunts at his spectacular
theaters in Hollywood. For the 1930 premiere of the Jean Harlow
picture "Hell's Angels," an aerial dog fight was staged over the
Hollywood Boulevard theater.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1950s and 1960s, movie premieres were infrequent,
relatively unsophisticated affairs. A studio announcer interviewed
the stars while the media looked on. "In the old days, the
celebrities would wait in line to be on the mike," former announcer
Johnny Grant said. "It was a more collegial group. If I was
interviewing William Holden, and Humphrey Bogart came up, he would
wait .... "</TE>
<TE>   Back on Wilshire Boulevard, limousines now line the curb. Actress
and inveterate premiere attendee Thora Birch is smiling brightly
through a barrage of commands from photographers. She tries a few
poses, then turns to go. Her smile vanishes when she notices the
press line. "Oh," she says to herself. Then to the 50 or so reporters
staring her way: "I'll catch you some other time." "Which means,
'Bye-bye!' " mutters one reporter. Birch heads into the theater.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, everyone's attention turns to a young man in an expensive
suit. He stands with adolescent awkwardness. The boy is Hanks'
14-year-old co-star, Tyler Hoechlin, but a publicist identifies him
to inquiring reporters only as "the kid in the film." "Bring him down
here!" shouts a TV reporter who wears a little black dress and body
glitter. "He's cute!" Moments later, Tyler stands before the
reporter's microphone. This is his second premiere in as many days.
He says he's getting the hang of it. "This one is starting to feel
more comfy," he says, adjusting his shoulders, sounding almost
convinced.</TE>

<LD>I fielded the phone call impatiently. Another earnest PR agent,
trying to interest me in her client's concern. This one wanted me to
write about cancer, the kind of cancer that killed Ann Landers, an
under-the-radar variety that too few people know about, and too many
people fear.</LD>
<LD>   I cut her off. Too busy, I told her. No one wants to read a column
on disease. But she stopped me cold when she said the name: Multiple
myeloma.</LD>
<LD>   That's the cancer that killed my mom. The thief that stole my
innocence, that left four children motherless, that has shadowed my
life ever since.</LD>
<TE>   "We're trying to do something to stop it," said the woman on the
phone. And I let her ramble on because I couldn't speak. Because my
heart still pounds and eyes grow moist whenever I think about this
disease.</TE>
<TE>   Like me, Susie Novis had never heard of multiple myeloma until its
diagnosis shattered her dreams. She was an accomplished sales
manager, engaged to be married to a successful young executive.
They'd found the perfect home in Laurel Canyon and planned their
lives down to the last detail.</TE>
<TE>   "Brian wanted to increase his life insurance so he had to have a
physical," Novis recalled. "Simple. He was young, healthy. But
something was wrong with the blood work. The doctor called. 'You have
multiple myeloma. You have three to five years to live,' he said."</TE>
<TE>   Brian Novis was 33 and not one to give up easily. He made the
rounds of medical libraries, researching multiple myeloma, an
incurable cancer of the marrow in which uncontrolled growth of plasma
cells dissolves surrounding bones and tissues. He enlisted the help
of Dr. Brian Durie, one of the country's foremost myeloma
researchers, and they created a foundation to fund research, share
information and provide support for patients living beneath the
shroud of the disease.</TE>
<TE>   But the disease pursued him relentlessly. For the next four years,
Susie watched him die, his bones disintegrating until the former
soccer player shrank from 5 feet 11 to 5 feet 2. From his hospital
bed in their living room, he organized the first clinical conference
for myeloma specialists. And though he had to strap on protective
braces to hold his body together so he could walk, he made it to the
group's first fund-raiser, in 1992 at the Four Seasons Hotel in
Beverly Hills. Most of the few hundred people in attendance were his
personal friends.</TE>
<TE>   Six months later, Brian was dead and Susie took over his legacy.
Today, the International Myeloma Foundation in North Hollywood has
90,000 members in 64 countries--patients, doctors, caregivers, family
members. Its hotline fields calls from all over the globe; it
sponsors support groups in dozens of cities; its seminars around the
world bring patients and their families together with doctors on the
front lines in the fight against the disease.</TE>
<TE>   There are no high-profile myeloma walks or rides or runs for the
cure. The foundation has raised $3 million for research mostly
through small events--garage sales, carwashes, fashion shows--hosted
by families touched by the disease.</TE>
<TE>   The disease has no celebrity spokesperson like Magic Johnson or
Michael J. Fox or Betty Ford. Its mortality rate is 100%, and the
most famous person to die of myeloma--Eppie Lederer, known as Ann
Landers--kept her six-month struggle with the cancer a secret.</TE>
<TE>   But the swelling ranks of sufferers guarantee it won't stay secret
for long. Although it is still relatively rare--the incidence rate is
29 per 100,000 among people 65 and older, and 2 per 100,000 for
people younger than 65--myeloma is now considered one of the
fastest-growing types of cancer in the world.</TE>
<TE>   More than 14,000 new cases are diagnosed each year in this country
as are 1,000 cases a day worldwide. And the number of doctors
specializing in research and treatment has jumped from 200 10 years
ago, to more than 1,000 today.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be we'd say 'myeloma' and people would say 'Oh yeah,
skin cancer' [called melanoma]," Novis said. "Now everywhere I go,
somebody will ask what I do and I'll mention 'myeloma' and they know
somebody who died from it."</TE>
<TE>   And it is no longer considered a disease of the elderly.</TE>
<TE>   Myeloma was once almost unheard of among people younger than 65.
But today, 10% to 15% of new cases are among those younger than 45.</TE>
<TE>   That makes early treatment even more essential, so that patients
can remain active and bone deterioration can be held at bay.</TE>
<TE>   Much has changed since my family's ordeal 26 years ago. Then,
there was no Internet, few clinical trials, scanty understanding of a
disease that made my mother's bones so brittle, she was confined to
bed and wracked with pain.</TE>
<TE>   At 19, all I knew was that my mother had cancer; that there was
nothing that could be cut off or removed, that she was going to die
within a few months if she didn't respond to treatment, and within a
few years if she did. Eight months later, at 52, she was dead.</TE>
<TE>   The gloomy prognosis hasn't changed much. The average life
expectancy for those diagnosed with myeloma still hovers between
three and five years. But the percentage of patients living longer is
growing and the quality of their lives is much improved, particularly
for those who detect their cancer early and start treatment before
their bones are destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   Promoting early identification of the disease is one of the
foundation's primary missions, particularly among younger people, who
tend to ignore or blame myeloma symptoms--such as bone pain and
exhaustion--on overwork or injuries.</TE>
<TE>   A marker of the disease--elevated levels of protein in the
blood--is relatively easy to spot in a blood test, and tests far more
sophisticated than in my mother's day can help determine a course of
treatment that can delay bone loss and minimize pain.</TE>
<TE>   "But chances are if you're a 40-year-old and you have back pain,
you're going to go to an orthopedist or a chiropractor," Novis said.
"You're not going to see your family doctor and ask for a blood test
'because I think I might have cancer.' "</TE>
<TE>   Unless, that is, you are someone like me, who runs to the doctor
at the slightest sign that my bones, like my mother's, have begun to
give way. "It changes your life," I tell Novis, over lunch. She nods
and her face flushes with pain, and we share a long silence full of
hard lessons and cruel memories--and hope that, as Brian used to say,
"one person can make a difference, and two can make a miracle."</TE>

<HD>Lucky Us: The SAT, Take 2</HD>
<DH>The addition of an essay question to the test causes some
pro wordsmiths to slip back into high school mode</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The essay question, like so many things in life, divides people into
two discrete camps: Those who view it with anxiety and a sense of
doom, and those who see it as their only real chance of survival in
school. If blessed with a certain facility for words, a student can
often present limited, or even wrong, information in such a way that
it seems insightful or creative.</LD>
<LD>   These are the kids who often hand in plays or poetry as their
final projects in classes where, perhaps, a footnoted research paper
might be more appropriate--astronomy, say, or biology. The kids who
might let a grade slip just a tad so they can pull all-nighters at
the campus newspaper or magazine office. The kids who often wind up
writing mid-list novels, doing time for fraud or working as reporters
for city dailies.</LD>
<LD>   Three weeks ago, the Trustees of the College Board voted to add an
essay question to the SAT, which is used by many colleges and
universities to evaluate applicants. For years, educators have
debated the usefulness, and morality, of standardized testing, and
though it remains a widespread requirement, it has gone through many
modifications.</LD>
<TE>   The most recent changes occurred after the University of
California, the biggest client of the SAT, threatened to switch to
another test. They include the new handwritten essay question, the
deletion of a time-honored analogies section and questions on
advanced algebra. College Board officials hope the new version will
provide a more well-rounded evaluation of what a student knows and
can comprehend, which is an admirable goal.</TE>
<TE>   It's just too bad it can't have a grandfather clause. Hearing of
the new writing section, many of us grown-ups were doused with a
sense of frustrated vindication. As we had suspected for so long, the
quiet desperation of our lives was indeed due to being ahead of our
time. Had there been an essay question on the SAT in our day, no
doubt we'd all be living the high life today.</TE>
<TE>   And yet. How easy is it to write an essay under such circumstances
even for those who love to write? Even for those who do it every day.
In 20 to 30 minutes, with no computer, no helpful copy editor, no
Google, no co-worker who actually knows how to spell "adjudicate."
Just you and that blue book and those No. 2 pencils with the clock
gobbling up the minutes of your future, of your destiny, like a
5-year-old popping bubble wrap. No deadline extensions, no blaming it
on AOL. What kind of prose could possibly come from conditions such
as these?</TE>
<TE>   Ten reporters from throughout this newspaper agreed to try to find
out. They answered a question, provided by the College Board, similar
to those that will be included in the new SATs. Conditions were as
authentic as possible--in a stuffy silent room there were blue books
and No. 2 pencils, there was a non-gum-chewing proctor (although I
also took the test, which was probably cheating somehow) with a watch
borrowed from a reliable source.</TE>
<TE>   No one save the proctor knew the question until the clock began.
The Trustees of the College Board said it would be a 20- to 30-minute
exercise, so we compromised on 25, but the essay was the only part of
the test we took, which certainly gave us an advantage over
11th-graders stuck in a classroom filling in bubbles for three hours.
That and the fact that we write on deadline for a living.</TE>
<TE>   The good news is we all passed. According to Tom Ewing at the
Educational Testing Center, the two professional graders who read the
essays were not told who had written them but caught on almost
immediately (which wasn't really hard since many essays made
reference to journalistic careers or to the exercise itself. But even
in those that didn't, Ewing said, "it was pretty obvious that these
were adults, and seasoned writers").</TE>
<TE>   Seasoned writing is apparently not always a good thing. Almost all
of the participants chose to write narratives rather than academic
analyses, which, one scorer noted, "made it difficult to judge the
kind of verbal reasoning the writers might, or might not, have." A
"faux-ironic mocking tone," they felt, permeated several of the
essays. Furthermore, there was, according to Ewing, "an almost
mechanical skill indicative of people who write for a living that
made them less authentic." Ouch.</TE>
<TE>   Reporters' Scores Come as a Relief</TE>
<TE>   But as everyone who's taken the SAT knows, the important thing is
the score and most of us got perfect 6s. Which was a big relief,
since the participants were not just risking public professional
humiliation but also dancing with the ultimate anxiety dream--you
know, the one in which you discover that your college degree and all
subsequent achievement has mysteriously been rendered null and void
and so you must repeat all of high school, often in your underwear.</TE>
<TE>   Still, as our teachers always told us, there's more to taking a
test than the actual results, there's the experience. And there were
many notable facets to this experience. The extreme delight some
editors expressed when they heard the plan, for instance, was a bit
chilling and might have explained why many of the writers approached
for the experiment, including several big-time award winners,
demurred. (Many cited their original, and mostly very high, SAT
scores as they declined, proving that even decades later, those
numbers remain vivid, a benchmark.)</TE>
<TE>   Oh, what a great idea, they said, but, gee, they had dentist
appointments and kids that needed to be picked up, interviews and
deadline editing, they had last-minute scheduling conflicts, some of
them quite vague, some seemingly contradicted by bosses and
colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   "If I prove that I can write on that kind of a deadline," one
Pulitzer Prize-winner half-laughed into the phone, "my editors would
expect me to do it all the time." Others were more up front. "No
way," said one former reporter turned editor. When shown a bagful of
books, he made a sign reminiscent of Bram Stoker's Transylvanian
peasants. "I don't even want to see them," he said, hurrying away
into the mist.</TE>
<TE>   Even those who proved game faltered a bit at the doorway when they
saw that telltale baby blue. Who doesn't have some grim memory of
blue book hell? Of getting halfway through that honors French history
final question only to realize you've spent the last 30 minutes
writing about the wrong war? Or discovering moments after handing in
your midterm that you were supposed to answer not two but three of
the five questions listed? Those anxiety dreams do not come from
nowhere.</TE>
<TE>   When the time came for the journalists to turn over and read the
question, groaned profanity weighted the air. For a few strained
moments it seemed some would bolt, but no, grimly wrapping fingers
around pencils, everyone went to it. Soon the only sound was sharp
lead on paper and the sudden curt shush of an eraser.</TE>
<TE>   Pages were angled and hunched over and smoothed and tapped
impatiently. Chins were propped on hands, or tucked toward chests.
Some of the writers, mostly the men, slumped back in their chairs,
putting physical distance between themselves and the paper.</TE>
<TE>   One woman rested her head on her arm as she wrote, staring at her
words sideways. In 10 minutes, the grown-ups were gone and the
students had slid into their places, guarding the test with their
forearms or writing while staring into the middle distance as if the
arm had no relationship to the eyes.</TE>
<TE>   After 15 minutes, one of the men stood up and handed in his paper.
"Different deadlines in sports," T.J. Simers deadpanned as he left.
But then there's always one kid in class who has to turn his test in
first.</TE>
<TE>   The hardest thing was the actual writing, the reporters said after
they were done. Although during an interview many take notes in
longhand, rarely do they write a story using anything but a keyboard
these days.</TE>
<TE>   During the test, several shook out their writing hands, an
unconscious gesture that everyone instantly remembered from those
long-ago finals. Joe Mathews, an education reporter, said his arm
hurt for days afterward. "They ought to let you ice it down," he
said. "Like an athlete."</TE>
<TE>   The amount of anxiety around the exercise surprised many of the
participants. "Even with nothing at stake, it's amazing how such
tests still have the power to conjure long-dormant fears," said Roy
Rivenburg, who writes for Southern California Living. "Everything
seems to move in slow motion--your brain, the pencil, your ability to
read and comprehend a simple two-paragraph essay question."</TE>
<TE>   The dragonfly analogy was roundly denounced as an actual hindrance
to creativity. "That was just so lame," said P.J. Huffstutter, who
writes for Business. "Why do SAT questions have to be so lame? I
wasted time sitting there wondering this."</TE>
<TE>   Geoff Boucher, an entertainment reporter, was shocked to see how
quickly he slid back into essay-speak. "That smarmy, earnest,
eager-to-please voice I had on tests was right there," he said, "even
after all those years. That was pretty disturbing."</TE>
<TE>   Empathy for Young Test Takers</TE>
<TE>   Many of us found it hard to turn in writing that hadn't been
edited; I worried about my lead, the opening paragraph, for the rest
of the day. "The most important thing I've learned in journalism,"
said Lorenza Munoz, an entertainment writer, "particularly since
coming to features, is the role of rewriting and editing a story. I
hated that I didn't have time to go back and tinker around."</TE>
<TE>   "I gained new empathy for 18-year-old SAT takers," said Dana
Calvo, who also writes for Calendar, "realizing how crazy it is to
respond to a provocative question within minutes after reading it. I
had a much better essay mapped out in my mind later that night after
mulling it over."</TE>
<TE>   All were giddy when they learned they did so well, although some
of us were frankly surprised. My use of run-on sentences, fragments
and double-dashes should have led to major points off. Not to mention
the handwriting issue, portions of my and at least one other's essay
were all but illegible. As grateful as many of us might have been in
our youth to see an essay question on our SATs, it's difficult to
imagine how standardized the scoring of an essay can really be. One
look at any sort of review makes it clear that one critic's idea of a
masterpiece is another one's turgid failure.</TE>
<TE>   "How are they going to grade these, really?" Huffstutter wondered.
"It is completely subjective. And can you imagine reading thousands
of these? You would completely numb out."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the essays were stories, some personal, rather than
scholarly discussions of the topic. Which, rather than signaling an
inability to use verbal reasoning, as the scorers uncharitably
feared, probably reflected what many have learned in this
profession--that one person's story, well told, can illuminate an
issue in a way no amount of academic debate ever can.</TE>

<LD>This essay question was administered to 10 Times staffers. For 25
minutes, they wrote their answers in blue books with No. 2 pencils.
Then, in keeping with the American Red Cross tradition after any
donation of blood, they were given cookies.</LD>
<LD>   Question: A student saw an aquatic insect drying out on a rock.
Saddened by the prospect of the insect's death, the student
nevertheless watched the process and to her surprise observed the
emergence of a brilliantly colored dragonfly. She noted the following
in her journal: "a change that at first appears to lead to
destruction may instead lead to unexpected and dramatic results."</LD>
<LD>   Assignment: Think of a change that at first appeared to be for the
worse but that led to unexpected and dramatic results. Write an essay
in which you discuss that change. You may draw your example from
literature, the arts, science, history, current events or your
personal experience or observation.</LD>
<TE>   Excerpts from a few of the essays:</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing worse than going into a Major League Baseball
season without a relief pitcher. The Dodgers chose to do that in 2002
and all the sportswriters began criticizing them, predicting when
they would be eliminated and telling fans to stay home.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers, however, are much smarter than sportswriters. That's
a proven fact. In fact, most everyone in the world is smarter than
your basic sportswriter.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers took their worst pitcher from 2001 and decided to make
him their No. 1 relief pitcher. The sportswriters said that was
stupid and even some of the Dodger players agreed. It's a well-known
fact most everyone in the world is smarter than your basic Dodger
player.</TE>
<TE>   The first game of the season the Dodgers' worst player took the
mound. The fans booed, the sportswriters went and got another hot dog
and some of the Dodger players sitting on the bench covered their
eyes.</TE>
<TE>   The worst player on the team then saved the game for the Dodgers,
striking out all three Giants he faced.</TE>

<TE>   Dear Son,</TE>
<TE>   Remember the ruckus 25 years ago when the College Board up and
changed the SAT?</TE>
<TE>   Of course you don't. You weren't born until 2009. The first-day
stories were kind and respectful. But it wasn't a week later that the
rest of the country declared war on Princeton, N.J. The members of
the College Board were all detained on Army bases. (There had been a
loosening of the civil liberty laws then. President Tiger Woods
restored habeas corpus a few years later after the water war with
China.)</TE>
<TE>   They eventually let the board members out of jail but they never
worked in education again.</TE>
<TE>   What was the trouble? The board not only added an essay--which
upset American kids who had stopped learning essay-writing in about
1983--but also removed the analogy section. Until 2002, analogies
forged the foundation of American arts and letters. The entire
society made decisions about how to allocate resources on the basis
of analogies. Students who could decode them went on to good
colleges, built fruitful careers and shopped at Restoration Hardware.
Everyone else ate at McDonald's if they weren't already flipping the
burgers there.</TE>
<TE>   When they dropped the analogies, chaos ensued. How could they even
evaluate the essay? Intellectuals also pointed out that this was just
penmanship. Yale couldn't fill its 2003 class. But eventually things
settled down. The country started to consider other values in meting
out opportunities. Clarity of thought. Succinct expression. Some
folks even evaluated others on honesty and integrity. (Before changes
in the SAT, people who seemed honest couldn't even get job interviews
in the accounting, telecommunications and energy industries.)</TE>
<TE>   Everyone loved the SAT. That feeling lasted almost 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately in 2019, the College Board added a new section. It's
the one that will give you the most trouble when you take the test
next Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Metaphysics.</TE>
<TE>   Good luck, son.</TE>

<TE>   Dear Old Dad</TE>

<TE>   This was my chance to swim in the big leagues. I would swim with
champions and hopefully make my way to the Olympics. I called my
mother on the pay phone. I could barely speak I was so excited. I
didn't care that I had won or that I had nearly broken a junior
national record. "That is wonderful, my baby," she told me. "Come
home soon."</TE>
<TE>   I practically danced over to my coach, giddy with the experiences
and my dreams.</TE>
<TE>   And then he broke the news that shattered me--you can't go to the
U.S. Nationals because you are not a U.S. citizen. When I left
Indianapolis, I came home and huddled with my parents. That night we
decided to explore the possibility of my swimming for Mexico, the
country where I was born.</TE>
<TE>   Within a few months I was off to a competition in Mexico. And then
Japan and then Australia and then Cuba. But through swimming for
Mexico, I traveled abroad. I competed against the cream of the crop
for every country. But most importantly, I learned that my heart was
with America, that even though I was born in Mexico, I had lived in
the States most of my life and that I was now an American in spirit
and in soul.</TE>
<TE>   --Lorenza Munoz</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When we went into Afghanistan I was curious about what the
soldiers would find there. Machete-wielding Taliban? Fortresses?
Instead, the images that would not let me be were those of women
floating along the dusty streets in blueberry-colored burkas. Who
were they? What was it like at night for them, when they lay in bed
next to their husbands?</TE>
<TE>   As the U.S. military action began to yield "results," i.e. the
Taliban fell from power, news broke that some brave women were
shedding their coverings. They were able to breathe freely. They
didn't pass out from the heat under the heavy cloth. They could laugh
in public and not earn a beating for it.</TE>
<TE>   I know the freedom of a few thousand women, however temporary,
does not mathematically compute to the deaths of a few thousand Wall
Street employees. But this essay question asked for a change that led
to unexpected results. Appreciation of my rights, everyday basic
rights, was unexpected. I was raised as a strong, aware feminist. It
took the liberation of women in Kabul to make me value that
upbringing.</TE>

<LD>After years of living it up at the Concern Foundation's annual Block
Party at Paramount Studios, supporters were introduced to a new
venue: The Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   "Following Sept. 11, Paramount closed the studio to major public
events," explained Beth Goldsmith, executive director of the
foundation that has raised $25 million for cancer research since it
was founded in 1968.</LD>
<LD>   Not to worry. Following the food-and-fun format it has used for
more than two decades--restaurant stations, casino, dancing and a
sprawling silent auction--the "Road to a Cure" benefit July 13 drew
2,500 guests and netted a record-setting $1.3 million.</LD>
<TE>   What the event lost in glam, it made up for in dazzle: On view
were 150 classic automobiles housed in the 300,000-square-foot
facility on Wilshire Boulevard that was once Orbach's department
store.</TE>
<TE>   Armed with appetites and a desire to stamp out the disease that
has touched many of their lives, guests sipped cocktails served up by
celebrities--among them, Daphnee Duplaix, who has a role in Steven
Spielberg's "Catch Me If You Can"--and sampled fare from restaurants
including Lawry's the Prime Rib, Factor's Famous Deli and Cafe
Santorini.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Thom, a survivor of colon cancer, was recognized at the
event for his community leadership and fund-raising on behalf of the
foundation. Including a personal donation of $250,000, Thom has
helped raise $400,000 for the organization during the past year. "I
like Concern because 90% of the money raised goes to research," said
Thom, who attended the benefit with his wife, Diana.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation has a sole purpose, said president Rick Powell:
"Find a cure and put an end to cancer."</TE>
<TE>   On the scene were event co-chairs Derek Alpert, Julie A. August,
Wendy Bachelis, Mitchell Baker, Todd Elliott, Steve Freed, Rebecca
Golden and Robert Goldman. Also attending: Rhonda Fleming, Robert
Ahmanson, Jack Gilardi, Frank Mottek, Joyce and Larry Powell, Jackie
and Stan Gottlieb, Bill and Patti Bloomfield, Bill and Dana Schwartz,
Myrna and Stanley Zimmerman, and Ed Blinn.</TE>

<TE>   Palate Pleasers</TE>
<TE>   In a first for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the historic
William Randolph Hearst-Marion Davies Estate will be featured in its
Art of the Palate dinner party series.</TE>
<TE>   The Spanish-Mediterranean-style digs owned by Nataalia and Leonard
M. Ross is frequently the site of formal affairs. "I like elegant
gatherings where everyone dresses up the way they do in Europe,"
Nataalia Ross said during a museum reception at the Peninsula Hotel
in Beverly Hills that feted hosts of the Sept. 26-28 fund-raisers.</TE>
<TE>   The Rosses will welcome 40 guests into their Beverly Hills home
for a $1,000-a-ticket, black-tie dinner, followed by dancing in their
Deco Room. The richly appointed residence has served as a backdrop in
films such as "The Godfather" and "The Bodyguard." The estate
"combines a little bit of history with a little bit of Hollywood,"
Leonard Ross said.</TE>
<TE>   The biennial benefit will showcase 53 dinner parties in homes and
special venues throughout Los Angeles, with guests paying an average
of $400 to attend. Proceeds will go toward museum exhibitions and
community outreach programs.</TE>
<TE>   The series marks the "fifth time the museum's 12 support councils
have joined forces," museum chairman Walter L. Weisman told the
crowd. "Last time we raised more than $700,000."</TE>
<TE>   Also attending the July 10 reception where guests cruised a
gourmet buffet underwritten by the Peninsula--Peking duck, sushi,
blinis with salmon and caviar--were Linda and Maynard Brittan, who
will host a $400-per-person dinner at the Venice showroom of
California contemporary artist Billy Al Bengston. "We're doing a
five-course sit-down catered by Joe's of Venice," said Linda Brittan.
"And besides Bengston, an old friend, architect Frank Gehry will be a
special guest."</TE>
<TE>   Guests included actress Thora Birch ("American Beauty," "Ghost
World"), who plans to attend the series' $100-per-ticket Young
Collectors Dinner Party at the Forum, G. Ray Hawkins and Michael Kohn
galleries.</TE>
<TE>   "I go to the museum all the time," said Birch. "I'm a
card-carrying member of LACMA."</TE>
<TE>   Also on the scene: Palate co-chairwomen Judy Henning and Georgina
Rothenberg.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Art Prize</TE>
<TE>   Capturing the crystalline light of a summer morning on the coast,
artist Ken Auster won first place and $5,000 at the Lincoln Plein Air
Painting Invitational benefiting the Laguna Art Museum and the Laguna
Plein Air Painters Assn. Fifty artists from around the country
participated in the competition held July 8-12. On July 13, the
artists joined 400 art lovers at the museum for a gala dinner and
preview sale, netting $209,000.</TE>
<TE>   The win marked the second time Auster has taken the top prize. "Do
I like this invitational? I'd better!" the Laguna Beach artist said
as he stood next to his Impressionistic oil titled "Rare Morning
Light."</TE>
<TE>   This year, the event added a new twist: On the day of the Quick
Draw competition in Heisler Park, 50 budding grade-school artists
took their places next to the competitors. "The students painted with
instructions from the artists and took their canvases home," museum
director Bolton Colburn said. Co-chairing the event were Jill
Michaels and Dave Rahn.</TE>

<LD>Every Tuesday, Grandmother worked at the animal shelter. Sometimes
Rosie visited. She liked seeing rescued animals brought to a safe
place.</LD>
<LD>   It felt good to see people take them to live in a new home.</LD>
<LD>   That was how Wags had come to live with Rosie and her grandmother.</LD>
<TE>   One Tuesday, Rosie was visiting when Mr. Carmen came into the
shelter.</TE>
<TE>   He was Rosie and Grandmother's next-door neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to select a kitten for Mrs. Carmen," he said. "But it's a
birthday surprise and a secret until Saturday."</TE>
<TE>   "I won't say a word," Rosie promised.</TE>
<TE>   Rosie and Grandmother showed Mr. Carmen three kittens.</TE>
<TE>   "I like them all," he said, "but I'll take the gray tabby with the
white face and pink nose."</TE>
<TE>   "We must sign some papers and make proper arrangements,"
Grandmother explained. "You can pick up the kitten Saturday in time
for the surprise."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday Rosie and Grandmother were shopping at the
supermarket when they ran into Mrs. Carmen.</TE>
<TE>   Rosie started to say something about the kitten, but she caught
herself just in time.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday when Rosie saw Mrs. Carmen return from work, Rosie
only said, "Hi."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday Mrs. Carmen was weeding her garden. Rosie waved and said
nothing at all. Keeping a secret sure was hard.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Saturday arrived. Mr. Carmen came home with the kitten
and invited Rosie and Wags to join the surprise.</TE>
<TE>   When Mrs. Carmen opened the door, Rosie and Mr. Carmen cried,
"Happy Birthday!"</TE>
<TE>   "How wonderful!" Mrs. Carmen said, taking the kitten in her arms.</TE>
<TE>   Then she looked at Rosie.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you know about this?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   Rosie smiled and nodded.</TE>
<TE>   "You are very good at keeping a secret," said Mrs. Carmen.</TE>
<TE>   Just then, Wags barked, and the kitten meowed.</TE>
<TE>   "Wags and the kitten both agree," said Mr. Carmen, and everyone
laughed.</TE>

<AU>ANA MARIE COX</AU>
<BD>Ana Marie Cox is the Washington columnist for In These
Times.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>War produces celebrity journalists, writers whose words or deeds make
them household names and occasionally provides the launching pad for
illustrious careers. World War I gave us Walter Lippmann. World War
II gave us Ernie Pyle. Vietnam, David Halberstam. The war on terror
has given us ... Ann Coulter.</LD>
<LD>   Coulter was not unknown before Sept. 11. In 1996, she
springboarded from her job as then-Sen. Spencer Abraham's deputy
press secretary to full-blown ''constitutional scholar" and
professional Clinton hater. She then successfully parlayed a job as
part-time MSNBC-TV commentator into a regular slot on the
now-canceled ''Politically Incorrect," largely because of her
willingness to go for sound-bite overkill. She brought new vigor to
her career when she called for the wholesale conversion to
Christianity of Muslims in the Arab world. Her new best-selling book,
''Slander: Liberal Lies About the American Right," was in preparation
before Sept. 11, and she hastily amended it to include sections on
how liberals actually hate America more than Muslims and how they
have deviously maneuvered to undermine the war on terrorism. ''In
lieu of a military response against terrorists," she writes,
"liberals wanted to get the whole thing over with and just throw
conservatives in jail."</LD>
<TE>   Coulter is one of many faces that have come to dominate the post-
9/11 datasphere, but whose expertise on terrorism is, to be
charitable, dubious. For the most part, these faces serve to cheer on
the Bush administration in whatever counterterrorism plans or arrests
it may announce and offer chilling predictions about what might
happen should we let down our guard. Some of these ''experts" play an
eager role in drumming up support for the Bush team's not-so-secret
dream of invading Iraq and in maintaining the healthy glow of a
presidency that cannot afford to let us forget we're at war. This
tacit complicity between policymakers and media is not benign: It
contributes to an atmosphere of hysteria that undercuts our good
judgment and weakens our loyalty to civil rights.</TE>
<TE>   Before 9/11, one might have wondered why the Family Research
Council, whose primary policy positions revolve around getting prayer
into schools and keeping homosexuals out, had a ''military and
national affairs" specialist. Indeed, retired Army Lt. Col. Robert L.
Maginnis spent most of his time arguing against the decriminalization
of marijuana, which hasn't been a national security issue since
audiences realized that ''Reefer Madness" was a comedy, not a
documentary. But lately, Maginnis has been called upon by news
networks to offer expert opinion on everything from the civil rights
of John Walker Lindh (he doesn't deserve them) to the limited torture
of terrorist suspects (not a problem).</TE>
<TE>   One would not expect the New York Times to stand next to the
Family Research Council on any sort of political spectrum, but in
ranking the alarmists, Times reporter Judith Miller is not that far
away from Maginnis. While superficially apolitical in her comments on
the news networks and in her reporting, it's difficult not to pick up
the hint of hysteria that garlands stories in which, for instance,
the destruction of the Al Qaeda network in Afghanistan is touted as
having actually ''complicated counterterrorism efforts."</TE>
<TE>   Is this tone intentional? Who knows. Will Miller's forthcoming
book on terrorism benefit from such stoking of fears? Of course it
will.</TE>
<TE>   At least Maginnis and Miller are experienced talking heads. Others
have sprung fully formed into media stardom. One example is Stephen
Gale, a University of Pennsylvania professor. His opinion on national
security has been sought by the likes of NBC, the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, the Washington Post and the U.S. Senate. He has
been uniformly pessimistic in his evaluation of our chances of
winning the war on terror (he gives Al Qaeda a ''50-50 chance" of
decimating the U.S.) and claims a certain prophet-in-the-wilderness
authority on the subject.</TE>
<TE>   A favorite talking point: The story of how he approached the
Federal Aviation Administration in 1998 with the likely scenario of
terrorists using planes as bombs but got turned away by agency
bureaucrats. Rebecca Trexler, a spokesperson for the FAA who handled
security issues for the agency at the time, says that the first she
heard of Gale's visit was when she read about it in the New York
Times.</TE>
<TE>   ''I called him and asked him who he had spoken to about this, and
the person he named has been dead for a few years," Trexler says.
''The people in that person's office don't remember that meeting, and
there's no record of it, so there's no way knowing what was said."</TE>
<TE>   Trying to turn up evidence of Gale's terrorism expertise before
the Sept. 11 attacks is largely fruitless. He developed software that
calculates the ''value added" by corporate security measures and
co-wrote a paper on terrorism that is now nearly 10 years old.</TE>
<TE>   Although he teaches a freshman seminar on terrorism, this hardly
seems a basis for heeding his advice on ensuring power-plant
security. Presented with a scenario of four teenagers scaling a
perimeter fence, Gale was blunt: ''You have to kill them," he told a
reporter. "I can't afford to ask what you're doing there."</TE>
<TE>   Compare this mind-set with that of Brian Jenkins, a widely
recognized terrorism expert who has written several books and
hundreds of reports on national security. Pressed repeatedly by a Fox
News interlocutor about his personal fears of an attack on nuclear
plants, Jenkins insisted, ''The risks are really very, very small."</TE>
<TE>   Which helps explain why the media return again and again to Gale,
despite his relatively weak background. But Gale and Maginnis are
freelancers; their warnings don't carry the import and untold
legitimacy of equally adept scaremongers dubbed ''news analysts."</TE>
<TE>   No doubt 9/11 left all news organizations scrambling for insight
and wisdom. CNN, however, didn't look very far. ''Law enforcement
analyst" Mike Brooks was already on board. In that incarnation, he
provided insight on the disappearance of former federal intern
Chandra Levy. But when the Levy story evaporated, the former
Washington, D.C., police detective's gig didn't: CNN tacked
''homeland security" onto his title, and an expert was born. Brooks
appears a few times a week on the network. Just before the Fourth of
July, he answered viewer questions about border security.</TE>
<TE>   Over at Fox News, the war on terror has become a full-employment
plan for a small army of in-house commentators--a study sponsored by
PBS' ''NewsHour With Jim Lehrer" last winter counted 17 in one week,
including five former national security officers: an ex-CIA agent, an
ex-Green Beret, a retired colonel and two retired generals. Their
military experience may be indisputable, but one wonders what makes
them conversant in international diplomacy and racial profiling, two
topics they contribute on regularly.</TE>
<TE>   Maj. Gen. Paul Vallely went from a single appearance on any
network in the year before Sept. 11 to more than 65 on Fox since. Lt.
Gen. Thomas McInerney has had a less-meteoric rise (climbing from
seven guest spots pre-9/11 to more than 25 since), but McInerney's
talking-head status says the most about the career arc of these newly
minted terrorism experts.</TE>
<TE>   As an expert on the war on terror, McInerney has beaten the drum
for a ''preemptive" attack on Iraq, telling Fox's Brit Hume last
month that despite the lack of a declared war, we should invade that
country. In the wake of 9/11, he said, ''we have to write new laws
and new strategy." McInerney was promoting an attack on Iraq under
the old laws and old strategy before Sept. 11, too.</TE>
<TE>   Tacit collusion between the government and the news media isn't
new. It may be the only way that the war on terror is like other
wars. That this collusion is less the product of orchestration than
coincidental opportunism does not make it any less troubling.
Forgotten are the consequences of giddy paranoia. For one, the
anxiety and distress that come with crying ''terrorism" first and
asking questions later are, in fact, one of the goals of terrorism.
And making decisions based on hyperbole almost guarantees that we
will come to regret them.</TE>
<TE>   It is probably unreasonable to ask that we be completely free from
worry or apprehension about the terrorist threat--our memories are
still too fresh for that. Yet we need to preserve some degree of
skepticism about it because it is such skepticism that will help us
determine the necessarily flexible line between keeping the public

<AU>TODD GITLIN</AU>
<BD>Todd Gitlin is a professor of journalism and sociology
at Columbia University and the author, most recently, of "Media
Unlimited: How the Torrent of Images and Sounds Overwhelms Our
Lives."</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>There's been a lot of talk recently about connecting dots--at least
when the enemy is terrorism. Connecting the dots: That's what the
FBI, CIA, NSA and the rest of the so-called intelligence agencies
failed to do before Sept. 11. Important facts got to somebody's
files, but the crucial work of interpreting them, of connecting them
to other important facts, never happened, and so the full picture
remained hidden. Thanks to whistle-blowers and belatedly mobilized
members of Congress, the difference between dots and pictures is now
well understood.</LD>
<LD>   But let's look at our other current troubles. There are plenty of
other dots going unconnected, seemingly isolated facts about current
and future hazards of every variety--corporate corruption, economic
fragility, ecological damage, alliance ruptures, foreign policy
calamities. But these many vexations are not, in fact, disconnected.
At the heart there is a pattern.</LD>
<TE>   The big, unacknowledged picture is this: The people in power
represent an economic clique whose interests are only superficially
tied to the well-being of the country as a whole. In collusion with
their delighted big-money supporters, President Bush, Vice President
Dick Cheney and their Cabinet-level entourage spent years lining
their pockets with sweetheart loans, option deals and golden
parachutes from oil companies and other related industries. They
built political careers thundering against regulation, fueled by a
cozy camaraderie with Enron and like companies that grew fat
on--surprise!--deregulation. In office, these men make energy policy
in cahoots with their ultra-wealthy sponsors, a club of very special
Americans whose membership list they still keep secret. They
consistently fight to secure America's energy dependency on oil and
related fuels. Toward that end, defying the understanding of
virtually everyone else in the world, they have denied the existence
of global warming, willfully distorting the scientific evidence. When
its own government scientists sounded alarms, the Bush posse
dismissed them as ''the bureaucracy" and kept galloping down the oily
path toward even more catastrophic global climate changes associated
with petroleum dependency.</TE>
<TE>   These bullheaded good old boys prate about patriotism but see no
problem with moving corporate headquarters offshore to avoid taxes.
They prate about fiscal responsibility yet guarantee vast deficits by
protecting billionaires from inheritance and other taxes. They
declare war on terrorism yet arrange buddy-buddy deals with the same
Saudi ruling caste that turned a calculated blind eye to Al Qaeda and
America-hating madrasas. They talk ''under God" but they walk under
oil. Is the pattern not obvious? These are the leaders who are going
to lead America out of grave trouble?</TE>
<TE>   Democrats have a golden opportunity now to pound the podium and
make a case to the nation that the interests in power--the interests
who won a minority of the ballots cast but a majority of the Supreme
Court during the 2000 presidential election--cannot be relied on to
solve problems that their entire careers were devoted to creating.
These interests are in revolt against plain American value and
virtue. Even the honest men and women among them cannot muster the
resolve to reform--their thinking is too deeply molded by the lives
they've led.</TE>
<TE>   Lifelong defenders of subsidized laissez faire for the wealthy who
can afford the price of the ticket (remember the savings and loan
rip-offs?), averse to the enforcement of public justice for everyone
else (remember Ronald Reagan's ''government is not the solution;
government is the problem"?), they are true believers in the superior
rights of people like themselves. Now, late in the game, they dress
up and pretend to be sheriffs, but they are more in the mold of
trickle-downer Herbert Hoover than of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who
understood that capitalism had to be saved from capitalists.</TE>
<TE>   We might properly ask, where were the Democrats when the clique
was mobilizing to win back the White House in order to push for yet
more deregulation? The man who, more than anyone else, drew the
necessary diagram to connect the dots was not Al Gore but the
underappreciated political theorist (and Hollywood filmmaker) Rob
Reiner. After the Republican convention of 2000, where African
Americans trotted out on stage far outnumbered African American
delegates, and self-congratulation about ''diversity" was the order
of the day, it was left to Reiner to make the elegant point that the
Republicans truly did believe in diversity: After all, they nominated
executives from two different oil companies.</TE>
<TE>   Was it not obvious once you heard it?</TE>
<TE>   But Democrats were timid about pressing the point. It wouldn't
sound nice. It would sound like, well, too anti-business, too
liberal, too 1960s or otherwise retro. The hard-charging Dow, they
thought, would undercut their point.</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, the Democrats were too compromised. They had made too many
of their own deals with the oil-deregulation-and-book-cooking
complex. After President Clinton and Gore tried to tamper with their
entitlements and prerogatives early in their first administration,
only to get slapped down, the top Democrats convinced themselves that
corporate growth (never mind who kept the books) was the emolument
not only for America but for global inequality across the board.
Feeling middle-class complacency, under pressure from hate-mongering
Republicans and an unrelenting press, Clinton and his party decided
they could not do better than believe in Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   The approach worked--for as long as it worked. But they spent far
more time catering to the tycoons than doing right by the teachers
and cops and firefighters, who, we now understand, are the real
heroes.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the Democrats need to do more than win the votes for this or
that new corporate regulation. They need to move beyond merely
feeling smug about how the Republicans have sabotaged themselves.
They need to confess their own sins--as Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.)
has done. But even more, they need to back the Republicans into their
chosen corner. They need to connect with the healthy side of American
skepticism. They need to be thunderous and clear on the essentials.</TE>
<TE>   If the Democrats forfeit the opportunity now handed them to
connect all the flaming dots, they are truly as flabby, corrupt and
venal as Ralph Nader says.</TE>

<AU>DENNIS HAYS</AU>
<BD>Dennis Hays is a former ambassador to Suriname and
former head of the Cuban affairs desk at the State Department.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>For more than 20 years, the Soviets swore they were not producing
biological weapons. They signed treaty after treaty outlawing such
weapons and dismissed the testimonies of defectors who contradicted
the official line as politically motivated.</LD>
<LD>   They were lying.</LD>
<LD>   After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russian President Boris N.
Yeltsin publicly acknowledged that the Soviets had a bioweapons
program of staggering dimensions.</LD>
<TE>   Similarly, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has always denied that
he is in the bioterrorism business. Yet, during the brief window when
he allowed on-the-ground inspections, more than 40 ''dual-use"
facilities were discovered to be involved in prohibited research and
production.</TE>
<TE>   Now Cuban President Fidel Castro says we should trust him when he
states that Cuba has no biological weapons program. Instead of taking
his word, we should accept the offer he made in May to former
President Jimmy Carter and conduct a full inspection of key biotech
facilities. We need to know, one way or the other, if a nation 90
miles from our shores is experimenting with deadly biological agents.</TE>
<TE>   It is important to separate what we know from what we suspect.</TE>
<TE>   Here is what we know:</TE>
<TE>   * Cuba has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to develop a
sophisticated biotechnology industry. It has imported advanced
equipment and invested in containment technology far beyond what is
needed for traditional medical research. Cuba has hundreds of
scientists who were trained in biotechnology in the former Eastern
Bloc. No one questions the technical capability of Cuba to produce
biological agents.</TE>
<TE>   * Cuba is a hostile state. Castro's enmity toward the U.S. is a
lifelong obsession. During the Cuban missile crisis, he urged the
Soviets to launch a nuclear first strike on us. For more than 40
years, he has harbored fugitives from U.S. justice and supported an
alphabet soup of revolutionary, subversive and narco-terrorist
groups. As recently as last summer, he and his agents traveled to
Iran, Iraq, Libya and Syria seeking common cause against our
interests.</TE>
<TE>   * Cuba has exported technology and provided training to other
terrorist states. Unable to generate sufficient income from the
legitimate production of biotech products, Cuba has turned to the
sale of its expertise, according to the former head of research of
Cuba's Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Jose de la
Fuente. He has charged that the Cubans have placed ''the prized
fruits" of the center in Iran's hands.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is what we suspect: A former colonel of the Cuban air
force, Alvaro Prendes, possesses documents smuggled out of Cuba that
describe in detail the biotechnology facilities that may serve as
fronts for the production of deadly toxins.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Wotzkow, a leading Cuban scientist forced into exile in
Switzerland, has written that the early phases of Cuba's biological
warfare program were carried out within the Institute of Zoology.
Wotzkow's account has been corroborated by another
scientist-defector, Luis Roberto Hernandez, who has described
Castro's interest in finding nontraditional ways to deliver
pathogens, such as via migratory birds. While such methods would have
seemed farfetched before Sept. 11, they now must be considered
seriously.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Ken Alibek, the former Soviet scientist responsible for
hiding the Russian program from international scrutiny, has noted the
striking similarity between what the Soviets did to avert suspicion
in the 1970s and 1980s and what the Cubans are doing now.</TE>
<TE>   This issue is too important to allow it to become captive to the
usual debate over Cuba policy. The effectiveness of the trade embargo
or the best way to bring democracy to Cuba is not the issue here.</TE>
<TE>   The question is, do the Cubans have biological or chemical weapons
that threaten the United States?</TE>
<TE>   As we have seen in Russia, Iraq and elsewhere, the only way to
know for sure is for qualified experts to conduct unannounced
inspections. As it happens, Cuba is a signatory to both the 1992
Biological Weapons Convention and the 1993 Chemical Weapons
Convention. Under the latter accord, it must submit to such
inspections when challenged by another signatory state.</TE>
<TE>   It may, however, be unnecessary to force the issue. Castro opened
the door to international scrutiny when he offered Carter
''completely free and total access, along with any specialists whom
you may choose, to inspect any of our prestigious scientific research
centers." Castro may well have thought that we would not call his
bluff. But we should. It is in everyone's interest, even Castro's, to
resolve this question--unless, of course, he has something to hide.</TE>

<BD>Gale Holland writes regularly on the media for Opinion.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The great question that has never been answered, and which I have not
yet been able to answer despite my 30 years of research into the
feminine soul, is: "What does a woman want?"</LD>
<LD>   --Sigmund Freud</LD>
<LD>   A lull in the war on terrorism has left the chattering classes
hanging. The slowing of the Afghanistan campaign has rendered
countless pro- and antiwar screeds obsolete. And bombs over Baghdad
haven't started falling. How best to fill the void but with the
question that confounded no less a thinker than Sigmund Freud?</LD>
<TE>   Yes, the topic of the day for both right- and left-wing
publications is women. And that means trouble, with a capital T and
that rhymes with P and that stands for ... Plumbing. Over at the
conservative National Review Online, Jessica Gavora is worked up over
a study claiming sex discrimination in high school vocational
education. Conducted by the National Women's Law Center, the study
found girls ghettoized in cosmetology and child-care classes while
boys filled the ranks of classes for would-be plumbers, pipe fitters
and engineers. Gavora thinks the study is a front for creeping gender
quotas. Gender quotas are Gavora's specialty. Her book, ''Tilting the
Playing Field: Schools, Sports, Sex and Title X," posits that men are
being forced to hand over athletic teams and programs to women who
participate less in sports, in the unholy name of gender parity.</TE>
<TE>   Now the gender quota lobby is moving on to vocational education,
Gavora says. ''When they fail to convince high school girls ... to
take more classes in welding and auto mechanics, activists will begin
to agitate for boys' representation in these classes to be
curtailed," Gavora writes in NRO. ''Boys will lose. No girls will
gain. But the law will be complied with."</TE>
<TE>   Gavora's musings inspire NRO Editor Jonah Goldberg--not
coincidentally, Gavora's husband--to take on women in plumbing. Or,
more precisely, his wife's piece got him "to thinking about how silly
and hopeless feminism has become," Goldberg writes.</TE>
<TE>   To Goldberg, the explanation for gender apartheid in vocational
education is simple: Girls would no more forgo ''pretty things" for
clogged toilets than join the Taliban. Goldberg does not explain the
male taste for stopped-up plumbing, but he's sure it has nothing to
do with gender bias.</TE>
<TE>   Feminism is so over, and the girls have won, Goldberg says. After
all, ''chicks" have the vote, and equal pay for equal work is a
reality ''if you control for childbearing, time in the work force and
other relevant factors." As if that weren't enough, ''the executive
editor of National Review Online is a dame ... for Pete's sake,"
Goldberg notes. Such things, he says, have eliminated the need for a
feminist movement.</TE>
<TE>   ''What studies and polls do show is that most young women don't
want to be called 'feminists.' Why? Because the term has become
synonymous with 'unreasonable ideologue,' 'chronic complainer,'
'crypto-lesbian' and, perhaps most of all, 'humorless toothache of a
human being,' " Goldberg wraps up.</TE>
<TE>   ''Humorless toothache" was one of the kinder things leftie Katha
Pollitt of The Nation was called after her post- 9/11 piece about her
aversion to flying the flag. This month, defending the United
Nations' 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
Discrimination Against Women against U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft's
attacks, she takes a global view of the woman question. And her
appraisal couldn't be more different from Goldberg's.</TE>
<TE>   ''What would the world look like if women had full human rights?
If girls went to school and young women went to college in places
where now they are used as household drudges and married off at 11 or
12? ... If they had recourse against traffickers, honor killers,
wife-beaters?" she wonders, decrying gross inequities women suffer in
the world.</TE>
<TE>   The doggedly leftist In These Times magazine also has a look at
women, this time in politics, and the publication's assessment is,
like Pollitt's, gloomy. It took a woman (Oakland Democratic Rep.
Barbara Lee) to vote against bombing Afghanistan, says Laura
Washington. But why, she wonders, didn't more women join her? ''Of
course, we must hold elected and appointed office and move into
controlling roles in corporations, academia and other influential
institutions," she writes, acknowledging gains in these areas. But,
she continues, ''Women in traditional authority positions too often
got there by playing by the old boys' rules--rules that limit them to
the values and rules of a male-defined and male-dominated world."</TE>
<TE>   How's this for coincidence: Back at National Review Online,
contributing editor Stanley Kurtz makes the same point! He, too, says
women shouldn't be trying to play by men's rules. Of course he has a
slightly different take. According to Kurtz, the national nurse
shortage is the fault of feminism, for bringing about ''the
replacement of a traditional ethic of sacrifice by a post-'60s ethos
of self-fulfillment."</TE>
<TE>   ''Nursing was once built around a spirit of feminine compassion
and sacrifice. In the new, feminist world, that is unacceptable,"
Kurtz laments.</TE>
<TE>   Conservative Commentary magazine scribe Lisa Schiffren takes aim
at  professional women. Discussing Sylvia Ann Hewlett's ''Creating a
Life: Professional Women and the Quest for Children," Schiffren takes
issue with the book's thesis that female professionals were duped
into giving up having children without knowing it. Schiffren says
women do make a choice--and they can't have it both ways, making
money and making babies. ''To pretend that women can have everything
and sacrifice nothing is a recipe for widespread misery," Schiffren
sniffs.</TE>
<TE>   Across the right-left divide, pundits are taking shots at uppity
women media figures, real and imagined. At front pagemagazine.com,
David Yeagley fumes over ''Xena: Warrior Princess," the eponymous
heroine of the now-canceled cult TV hit. Applauding a recent Pentagon
decision to further limit the role of women in war zones, Yeagley
says women like Xena can't and shouldn't exist. ''A beautiful woman
who does combat is a creature of our imagination only.... Is there
room for a woman who admires men for their strength in war, and yet
herself remains humble and noble enough not to interfere with
national security in the name of political correctness?" Yeagley asks
wistfully.</TE>
<TE>   Also at frontpage (leftie-turned-rightie David Horowitz's Internet
journal), radio host Larry Elder, in a commentary also posted
elsewhere, is up in arms over former White House press corps dean
Helen Thomas retaining her front-row seat at presidential newscasts.
Elder unmasks Thomas, who left the UPI news wire to become a
columnist, as an American-Taliban-loving liberal, and challenges her
privilege. ''Sorry, despite Thomas' entertaining and feisty
questions, she no longer qualifies to continue sitting there!" Elder
writes.</TE>
<TE>   In a  cover story in The Nation, Richard Goldstein assails what he
calls ''homocons," gay pundits who hide their conservative colors
behind a facade of ''independent" views. Chief among them is Camille
Paglia, who, he says, despite being a gay woman, is a not-so-secret
''masculinist."</TE>
<TE>   ''For Paglia, masculinity is the source of creative energy, while
femininity is a 'chthonian swamp' from which real men (and the women
who adore them) struggle to escape," Goldstein writes.</TE>
<TE>   What is Paglia herself thinking these days? Let's just say, they
also serve who only stand and gloat. While she acknowledges in a
recent frontpage.com piece that ''the small cells still stoking their
fury in feminism," remain, she dismisses them as ''mostly
fanatics--those who are still nursing childhood wounds and who cling
to 'the movement' as a consoling foster family." Meanwhile, and more
important, she writes, ''There have been seismic shifts in feminism
... over the past decade. My wing of pro-sex feminism has triumphed."</TE>
<TE>   Women, hear them roar.</TE>

<BD>Jo-Ann Mort is co-author of the forthcoming "Our Hearts
Invented a Dream: Can Kibbutzim Survive the New Israel?" and national
secretary of Americans for Peace Now.</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>When the peace process grinds to a halt, this city feels the stoppage
through all of its pores. The fear of more suicidal violence has
nearly brought the downtown to a standstill. Many stores on Jaffa
Road, the main street along the spine of downtown in West Jerusalem,
don't even bother to open at night, knowing they won't have
customers. And with the Israeli government's policy of closure, it is
nearly impossible for Palestinians to travel from Ramallah to East
Jerusalem to work.</LD>
<LD>   The economic situation here is grave. My hotel has so few guests
that the room where breakfast is usually served is not used, replaced
by one much smaller. It is the same everywhere in town. Tel Aviv
hotels are even emptier. In the Palestinian territories, things are
worse, with widespread starvation suddenly seeming like a real
possibility.</LD>
<LD>   So where are all the American Jews who march and rally by the
thousands to support Israel and the current Israeli government? A few
staunch leaders still make pilgrimages--as have conservative
Christian activists like Gary Bauer, whom I saw in the lobby of my
hotel deep in conversation with former Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu. But the rank-and-file Jews and conservative
Christians who shout their support for Ariel Sharon while safe on
U.S. soil are unwilling to risk a visit.</LD>
<TE>   The "situation," as Israelis call this new intifada, has cost the
Israeli economy 2 million tourists a year. Economic growth is
expected to be less than 1% in the coming year, while unemployment is
projected to hit nearly 14%.</TE>
<TE>   The combined weight of security costs, lack of tourism and general
gloom has slowed the economy dramatically. According to the Likud
finance minister, Silvan Shalom, foreign investment has almost
completely dried up, and Israeli investment is also slowing. The
situation has prompted Shalom to call for steep cuts in the defense
budget.</TE>
<TE>   The only Israelis holding their own economically--at the expense
of the rest of the country--are settlers in the West Bank and Gaza,
because their schools, housing and transportation are heavily
subsidized as part of this government's desire to keep them in place,
rather than offering them incentives to leave.</TE>
<TE>   A terrible feeling of stalemate hangs in the air here--a feeling
exacerbated for all but the most hard-line by President Bush's recent
speech, which many believe added to the lack of movement on both
sides. There is also a profound disconnect between Israeli public
opinion and the current Knesset leadership, with consistent public
support, even among the right wing, for a two-state solution, for a
cold peace, if not a warm one. About 60% of the public supports
unilateral withdrawal to the 1967 lines, and a clear majority even
supports unilateral evacuation of most of the settlements. But with
the Labor Party a participant in the current government, and with
Sharon managing the Labor members of his Cabinet with the skill of a
master puppeteer, there is no leadership strong enough to rally
support for the kind of policy changes that could alleviate Israel's
security and economic concerns. The new head of Labor, Binyamin
Ben-Eliezer, who still sits as defense minister in the current
right-wing government, hopes that the economy will resurrect Israel's
center-left from oblivion when new elections are set. But real change
will take more than hope.</TE>
<TE>   The only growth industry currently in Israel is security services,
as every business requires a guard. Young soldiers patrol the
Jerusalem streets intermittently in their green army jeeps. With
Palestinians in the territories on virtual lockdown, suicide bombings
were certainly slowed, but as Israelis learned last week, they have
not been eliminated. And the human suffering among Palestinians is
becoming intolerable.</TE>
<TE>   It is just a matter of time--as even Israeli security officials
acknowledge--before Palestinians, frustrated by the lack of movement,
attempt attacks on the Israeli army that is occupying Palestinian
cities. These same officials also realize that the reserve soldiers
necessary to staffing the occupation will soon become frustrated with
their security duties.</TE>
<TE>   Even the wildly popular fence currently under construction to
separate the bulk of Israel from the Palestinian territories points
up the contradictions in the country's current policies. The fence is
being constructed essentially along the "Green Line" marking Israel's
pre-1967 boundaries. It excludes most of the settlements, which will
become even more vulnerable to attack, raising tough political
questions about their viability.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon has announced that Israel has no plans to end the
occupation, which means that Israel will have to take charge of civil
administration for the Palestinians. The Palestinian Authority, with
or without Yasser Arafat, has been shattered by Israel's actions,
leaving it unable--even if willing--to institute the reforms called
for by Bush and others.</TE>
<TE>   It's understandable that people feel nervous about venturing to
Israel, but if that is the case, one must ask how to resolve this
stalemate, because as the empty streets attest, Israel is in a dire
state. Just last year, Jews in Argentina considered Israel a possible
refuge from that country's economic collapse. Now, one hears
comparisons between the Israeli and the Argentine economies.</TE>
<TE>   For those who have dreamed of a strong Zionist state that could
take in the world's Jews in need, blanket support for the Sharon
government is simply not good enough.</TE>

<AU>CAROL MUSKE-DUKES</AU>
<BD>Carol Muske-Dukes is a poet and professor of English at
the University of Southern California. Her forthcoming book is
"Married to the Icepick Killer: a Poet in Hollywood."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Judging by the number and alarmed tone of the e-mail messages, the
threat is significant and ongoing. It has certain members of the
military--both active and retired--on high alert, cautioning each
other to remain attentive. A ubiquitous ''pass it on" at the end of
each message telegraphs an urgency about getting the word out to
others.</LD>
<LD>   What is this menace keeping so many of our nation's self-declared
patriots awake at night? Osama bin Laden? Saddam Hussein?</LD>
<LD>   No, it's our former first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton. As a
feminist and longtime casual admirer of the New York senator, I am
probably not a typical recipient of these oddball battlefield
communiques. But through the dubious courtesy of my late husband's
estranged relative (a furious-at-the-world retired military man in
his 70s), I've been placed on a ''copy to" list, presumably in the
hope that if I can't be educated I can at least be provoked. In fact,
I'm almost grateful for the fascinating glimpse into a bizarre world
of overwrought, blitzkrieg-style ''bulletins" passed along by a group
of furtive character assasins that has focused all its paranoid zeal
on one woman.</LD>
<TE>   A while back, I was included in an ''alert" that breathlessly (if
belatedly) recounted the details of then-President Clinton's
appointment of a former Black Panther sympathizer to a government
post. The narrative turned out to concern itself not so much with the
president's choice, but with how the so-called "smartest woman in the
world," Hillary Clinton, had defended this choice. A further charge:
Hillary was a ''radical" while at Yale Law School, where she
organized pro-Black Panther Party demonstrations to support the
group's ''murderous" policies. Ultimately, the demonstrations ''shut
down" the school. The narrative ended with the (now-familiar) ''pass
this on!" and exhortations to remember this transgression ''if and
when she runs for president!"</TE>
<TE>   One primary source of information cited in many of the messages is
a Web site called NewsMax.com, a buzzing online hub proffering
''exposes" and the ''news behind" many current events. The site,
which acknowledges that it ''has a big job ahead as we seek to expose
the real Hillary Clinton," is filled with ''facts" about the
senator--from the ''fact" of her torrid love affair with the late
White House Deputy Counsel Vince Foster to testimony (audiotape for
sale) from former Arkansas state trooper Larry Patterson about crude
remarks he said she made behind closed doors about ''blacks, Jews,
police officers, Republicans and others." Her future compensation is
explored, with the conclusion that even if she ''is not reelected,
she'll get her full salary as a pension. If Clinton dies, his full
presidential pension goes to Hillary."</TE>
<TE>   If that's not sufficiently headline-worthy, how about this item
from an e-mail bulletin I received attacking Sen. Clinton for
snubbing the American Gold Star Mothers, an organization of women
whose sons and daughters died in the line of duty with the U.S. armed
forces or its allies. According to the e-mail, a delegation from the
group's New York chapter made a trip to Washington ''to discuss
various concerns with their elected representatives." And, naturally,
it was the one politician who ''has never showed [sic] anything but
contempt for our military" who refused to meet with the delegation.
Who? Who else: ''the Queen herself, the Hildebeast--Hillary Clinton."
She had, according to the e-mail, ignored ''repeated requests" from
the Gold Star Mothers to meet with her. The message ends with a non
sequitur postscript about how the Clintons are charging the Secret
Service $10,000 a month rent for housing the agents that guard them,
thereby covering the family's $10,000 monthly mortgage payment on the
house they bought to establish a New York state residence for Hillary
Clinton's Senate run. ''Please forward this to as many people as you
can," the missive concluded. ''We don't want this woman to even think
of running for president."</TE>
<TE>   One problem with the torrent of anti-Hillary missiles is that the
payload's a dud--the stories are largely based on untruths. At a Web
site that investigates the veracity of urban legends,
truthorfiction.com, the Black Panther story is put into perspective.
Hillary Clinton may have been involved in college demonstrations
during the 1970 murder trial of Panther party co-founder Bobby Seale,
but these were peaceful demonstrations and did not ''shut down" the
university.</TE>
<TE>   The statements about her salary are just plain false: She would
not leave office with a pension equaling her full salary, and she
would get only part of Bill Clinton's current $166,000 annual pension
if she survived him. As for the Gold Star Mothers, an official notice
has been posted on that group's own Web site regarding ''the
misunderstanding about Senator Hillary Clinton." The organization
points to a NewsMax article as the initial source of false
information, and ''deeply regrets" any misunderstanding and ''would
appreciate it if the e-mails and negative comments about Senator
Clinton would cease." According to press officer Jim Kennedy in
Clinton's Washington office, the rumors began after two Gold Star
moms visited Clinton's office without advance notice. The senator was
not present and so could not see them. Later, she met at length with
both the Gold Star Mothers and the Gold Star Wives. She is currently
''co-sponsoring legislation at the request of the Gold Star Mothers
and is working with the Gold Star Wives on their legislative agenda,"
Kennedy said.</TE>
<TE>   The government-paid mortgage? Patently false. In fact, according
to truthorfiction.com, the Clintons would be eligible for government
reimbursement of more than $1,000 per month for housing the agents,
but they have turned down the money.</TE>
<TE>   The cyberspace warnings about Sen. Clinton, while ostensibly
written out of outrage at her politics, are inevitably interspersed
with personal and physical insults--she is ''icy-cold and
crocodilian," her legs are heavy, she is ''violent," a ''batterer."</TE>
<TE>   It all recalls the intensely personal attacks on Eleanor Roosevelt
during and after her husband's presidency. Not since then has a
former first lady (and independent woman) been the object of such
unrelenting scorn, invective and smear. Some of these attacks may
seem like mere bottle rockets, but they also reveal a broad cultural
streak of misogyny and terror of women. The cynical pitting of the
selfless Gold Star Mothers against the independent and outspoken
Clinton seems designed to invite a burn-the-witch electronic bonfire.
In this peculiar morality play, the Gold Star Mothers are cast as
perfect models of female acquiescence and propriety--women who have
no ambition for themselves, who have ventured to Washington seeking
only to be heard. Clinton then becomes the self-promoting,
unscrupulous schemer, a driven, electioneering feminist who has no
time for clueless altruists.</TE>
<TE>   The unfairness of this false dichotomy (and its partisan nature,
as Clinton staffer Kennedy points out) underscores a long-standing
ambivalence about women and their right to power. I believe that the
national antipathy shown Eleanor Roosevelt stemmed from a fear that
she was ''taking over" her husband's role. It was assumed that she
was trying to be president, unlike the more traditional first ladies
who preceded and followed her. The violent reactions to Hillary
Clinton seem to have generated this same quality of fear and outrage
at a woman who ''doesn't know her place."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, though, it's impossible to fully grasp the motivation
behind these pillory-Hillary dot-coms. But one thing's clear:
Somebody out there is scared silly of her. Hillary for President?
Pssst, pass it on!</TE>

<AU>GREGORY RODRIGUEZ</AU>
<BD>Gregory Rodriguez, a contributing editor to Opinion, is
a senior fellow at the New America Foundation.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Latino civil rights establishment suffered a major setback last
month when a panel of three federal judges unanimously dismissed a
voting-rights suit filed by the Mexican American Legal Defense and
Educational Fund. The judges found that ''California's political
system is far from closed to Latinos" and that the contemporary
record painted a ''far more encouraging picture of racial voting
attitudes" than it did a decade ago.</LD>
<LD>   This ruling is not only a milestone in Mexican American history,
it also opens up an opportunity for ethnic Mexican organizations--and
the mainstream foundations and corporations that fund them--to shift
their priorities. If, as the judges imply, anti-Latino political
discrimination is easing, full-time advocacy is unnecessary. Instead,
more ethnic institutional energy should be directed toward providing
aid to Latinos, particularly immigrants, in need. By creating a
statewide clearinghouse for ethnically targeted charity, California's
Mexican American activists can capitalize on their successful rights
advocacy and preserve their relevance in an era of growing Latino
political power.</LD>
<TE>   Historically, ethnically based organizations served two purposes:
self-defense and self-help. In the days after slavery, freed blacks
formed organizations to defend their rights and provide economic
relief. During the great immigration wave at the turn of the 20th
century, scores of ethnic groups, including Mexican, depended upon
the services of mutual-aid societies. By the 1920s, many ethnic
agencies offered their clients everything from employment services
and relief benefits to day care and burial. Mutual-aid societies also
provided legal assistance, particularly to immigrant Mexicans
suffering from a virulent anti-Mexican backlash after World War I.</TE>
<TE>   Many of these ethnic-aid societies collapsed during the Great
Depression, and the Roosevelt administration's subsequent New Deal
supplanted their reason for existing: The federal government began
assuming the welfare burdens. Jewish organizations have been the
chief exception. Today, there are approximately 4,000 Jewish
philanthropic funds with roughly $10 billion in assets.</TE>
<TE>   Through the years, ethnic Mexican organizations also became
increasingly dominated by native-born Mexican Americans rather than
immigrants. In contrast to their predecessors, which stressed
cooperation between immigrants and Mexican Americans, the post-New
Deal voluntary associations tended to exclude noncitizens from
membership.</TE>
<TE>   The three most prominent contemporary Latino organizations were
founded circa 1970, when immigrants represented the lowest percentage
of the U.S. population in the nation's history and when Mexican
Americans were overwhelmingly U.S.-born. Modeled after existing
African American groups, MALDEF, the National Council of La Raza and
the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project were all formed
when major philanthropic foundations were abandoning their old
mission of building institutions in favor of challenging existing
ones. None of the three was designed to provide constituency
services.</TE>
<TE>   This is not exceptional. It has been a century since these
foundations got out of the charity business. Andrew Carnegie and John
D. Rockefeller believed that philanthropy should identify root causes
of problems and sponsor systemic change. Accordingly, most large
foundations today seek to resolve entrenched social problems using
''theories of change" and ''logic models." They shy away from
supporting direct services to the needy, preferring instead to bring
about high-level changes in the courts and state capitols.</TE>
<TE>   A quarter of a century of massive immigration into the U.S.,
coupled with a decisive change in the demographics of poverty, has
not changed this outlook. Recently, the Pew Charitable Trusts
considered creating yet another national Latino advocacy group before
deciding on a Latino research center.</TE>
<TE>   But Sept. 11 has helped to restore the social value of the
handout. A few foundations sought to protect low-wage workers near
the damaged sites or safeguard the rights of immigrants. But the
overwhelming need was for straightforward aid to the families of
victims.</TE>
<TE>   It is precisely this kind of Victorian-era charity Latino
organizations should take up. Ideology aside, sometimes a handout is
a hand up. The group most vulnerable to the whims of the economy,
contemporary immigrants, could benefit from direct help as did
newcomers a century ago. Emergency or medical relief, widow's
insurance, tuition and burial assistance are just a few kinds of
grants that would be helpful.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, there are plenty of ethnically oriented social-service
outlets offering everything from AIDS testing and mental-health
therapy to parenting classes and day care. But they do not constitute
a cohesive network of providers. They are, at best, a patchwork of
independent operators heavily reliant on public funds and guided by
government priorities. There is not one broad-based ethnic Mexican
charity in California or anywhere else. In the nascent world of
Latino philanthropy, there is not one organization to match the
stature of the national advocacy groups. Nor is there a nationally
recognizable group to which the growing Mexican American middle class
can contribute money to help newcomers in need.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican immigrants have their own informal social
networks--primarily their extended families--that offer aid and
support. There is also a growing network of Mexican hometown
associations with the potential to provide more formal types of
mutual aid to immigrants here. But for now, most of their donated
money and efforts are focused on helping the communities they left
behind. Immigrants send an estimated $6 billion in remittances back
to Mexico each year.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the largest ethnic Mexican social service provider in
the nation--the Mexican American Opportunity Foundation--relies
largely on government and corporate support. Its founder, Dionicio
Morales, has bemoaned the lack of Mexican American financial aid.
Broadly, he laments the lack of ethnic Mexican self-help
institutions, citing an ambivalent Latino identity as the reason.</TE>
<TE>   Studies have found that Latino charity is mostly confined to
informal networks of family and friends, and immigrants' rates of
formal philanthropic giving and voluntarism are lower than among
those who are native-born. While similarly situated Mexican Americans
give at the same rate as Anglos, they are not necessarily donating to
Latino organizations. In fact, one major national survey showed that
Latinos had lower rates of involvement with Latino than with
non-Latino organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the creation of a broad-based Mexican American mutual-aid
society is an achievable--and desirable--goal. Ethnic Mexican
organizational energy has been spent almost exclusively on advocacy.
It's now time to shift more of that energy to community-financed
self-help.</TE>

<DH>For Israeli and Palestinian youth, a longing for normalcy
has been dashed by the tide of violence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMY WILENTZ</AU>
<BD>Amy Wilentz is the author, most recently, of "Martyrs'
Crossing: A Novel."</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>When Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was killed in the fall of
1995, I was at a Jerusalem hospital with my newborn baby, who doctors
mistakenly thought had pneumonia. New to the city, I didn't know
where the hospital was or how to get there, so a friend, an older
Israeli woman with a bad sense of direction, got me there,
circuitously, and while we were sitting waiting for the baby's X-rays
to come back, the news came on that Rabin had been shot; we did not
know yet whether he would survive.</LD>
<LD>   I remember her face, already weathered by so much experience in
crisis. She had participated in the War of Independence, had been in
Jerusalem during all the many really rough times, had even known
Rabin and his wife in the days when they were all young and hopeful
and comrades in arms--and now it had come to this. When they finally
broadcast the news that he had died, her face collapsed.</LD>
<LD>   "He was the only one," she said. "This is the worst news."</LD>
<TE>   The next night, I walked over to Rabin's Jerusalem residence, a
few blocks from my house. An important Israeli art school is nearby,
and all the art students were out, wearing black jeans and white
T-shirts (not a special uniform for the occasion but their everyday
outfit), sitting on the ground in front of the fences and walls,
lighting candles and writing poems the way teenagers do to mark any
meaningful passing. They were trying to pluck hope out of what looked
like a really bad situation: the senior statesman, prime minister of
peace, a man of their grandparents' generation, shot down by a
radical right-wing Israeli religious militant their own age, more or
less. Israel was changing.</TE>
<TE>   "What will come next?" one serious, thin, blond girl asked me. Her
mother, a Peace Now activist and, therefore (as they used to be)
eternally hopeful, answered, "A resurgence of support for the peace
process." No one wanted to frighten the children, and back then,
peace seemed unstoppable. Even people who were traditionally
pessimistic could not deny its imminent advent.</TE>
<TE>   We were wrong, of course, and now many of those same young people
and their contemporaries--called since that night of remembrance "the
children of the candles"--are fighting at close quarters in Jenin and
reoccupying the West Bank. They and their contemporaries are dying in
suicide bombings or suffering terribly in rehab centers for trauma
injury. When they go out and try to be teenagers and young adults,
they're exploded in lines waiting to get into nightclubs, blasted to
smithereens because they went out to have a cup of coffee, bombed as
they go into the grocery store for a red pepper to complement the
fish dinner. Even little kids are not exempt: Schoolchildren are
killed on buses and babies are torn apart sitting in strollers in
pizza parlors.</TE>
<TE>   War is a terrible thing. For years during the Oslo peace process,
Israelis could imagine that they lived in a country not at war, one
that was close to normalizing its relations with its enemies and
therefore close to normalizing its own interior, domestic life. It
was a different world then. The red Egged Co. buses were a sign of
national cohesion, not rolling engines of a possible death. Places
where people congregate were exactly that: places where people
congregated, not vast empty pedestrian plazas or cave-like shopping
malls or echoing cafes and restaurants. Soldiers were in some places,
but not everywhere. Now the space for secular life is gone.
Playgrounds are sparsely played in. And although people still go
out--teenagers, the most intrepid of all--there is a sense of
foreboding with each social foray. Better to invite people over, the
kids think. Better skip the bagel in Zion Square. I have an espresso
maker in the kitchen; why should we go out to Kafit?</TE>
<TE>   In these conditions, for a large swath of Israeli youth, it's
harder to believe in a place called Israel. Israel was home; now it's
a waking nightmare. Though they continue to believe in the country,
and to fight and die for it (or its leaders' version), they are
frightened for the future and beginning to question. No one can say
for how long these kids will be willing to uphold an old embattled
general's idea of what Israel should be.</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to empathize with the cut-off lives of Israeli kids and
teenagers because they seemed to hold so much potential, seemed so
like the lives of American or European children and teenagers, with
their consumerism, their education, their video games and shopping
malls.</TE>
<TE>   What, then, of the Palestinian kids across the Green Line? Similar
things are happening there as the violence escalates. Palestinian
children's lives never promised quite as much as those of Israeli
kids across the way, but during the cool years the Palestinians were
also beginning to think that perhaps something more normal might
await them in life, more normal than tanks and guns and checkpoints,
more normal than Areas A, B and C (of Oslo's formulation), which were
already a small improvement over total explicit occupation.</TE>
<TE>   Now young Palestinians, like everyone else on the West Bank, live
under curfew, sometimes 24 hours a day. Their schools are more often
shut than not. The universities they attend or hope to attend are
closed by the Israelis. They are taught to love martyrdom. Because
martyrdom is at least a path you can choose. Most other paths are now
closed off. Even to buy candy is a risky venture. Boys riding bikes
home from the store get chased down by tanks and shot. Their elders
are forced out of their offices by the Israelis. Doctors cannot visit
their young patients during curfew or travel across checkpoint lines.
No grown-up seems to have any real power over his or her own life,
and so no adult holds real authority or can set a real example of how
to live life when you have choices to make.</TE>
<TE>   What, then, can these two sets of children, enemies politically
but in fact so alike, make of the future of their homelands and, by
extension, of their own future?</TE>
<TE>   A piece of satire, written by the Israeli humorist B. Michael of
the Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharanot and translated by Amos Elon,
the respected Israeli political writer, illustrates the feeling of
normal people on both sides of the conflict, though it was written
strictly about the Israelis:</TE>

an isolated piece of land in the Middle East. We are decent people,
but ... we are now at the mercy of a particularly stupid group of
leaders: mostly generals, colonels, clergy and other thugs. These bad
people insist that God himself directed them to fight endlessly for a
few useless pieces of real estate.... They are forcing us to
participate in their war games, finance and sometimes take active
part in them. If you find this note, please take it to your
leaders.... We still have food and water but only a few drops are
left in the supplies of sanity.</TE>
<TE>   --P.F.L.N.P. (The Popular Front for the Liberation of Normal
People)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The piece sounds a note of desperation, and the young people of
Israel are both desperate and depressed. At Passover this year I met
a group of Israeli teenagers who had come to New York to celebrate
and to spend a week, and their relief at being away from home was
palpable. "We're all so sad," one girl said from across the table.
"It's terrible in Jerusalem." This was the night of the Passover
suicide bombing in Jerusalem, incidentally. She and her friends
didn't really want to go back at all. Who would? But they did because
Israel is home and where their families are, their friends. Their
future.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli politicians have a grave obligation to these children who
in a year or two will be serving in the army. The politicians must
figure out a way to ensure that there is a future to be lived in
Israel for this generation. If they don't figure that out, if they
don't turn away from total and eternal war toward some new kind of
peace, and soon, there may well be no future generation in Israel to
continue their bloody and fruitless occupation for them.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A national home builders group has ended its Sept. 11 relief effort
after distributing $10 million to victims of last fall's attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The Home Builders Care Victims' Relief Fund was established by the
National Assn. of Home Builders, with the assistance of its
philanthropic arm, the National Housing Endowment.</LD>
<LD>   To launch the fund, the home builders' group pledged $250,000, and
its employees donated $60,000. The endowment provided an additional
$125,000. More than 5,000 members of the home-building industry
contributed to the $10-million total, with some builders each giving
$1 million.</LD>
<TE>   About 89% of the funding went directly to victims residing in New
York City, in the form of mortgage grants, rent and other
housing-related expenses.</TE>
<TE>   About 3,000 families in the greater New York area received
assistance. Another 10% went to a survivors' fund.</TE>

<HD>New Law Lets Condo Owners Display the Flag</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Wedner</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis has signed into law a bill allowing homeowners in
common-interest developments to fly the American flag.</LD>
<LD>   Following Sept. 11, many homeowners wanted to display Old Glory,
but some condominium and townhome owners were forbidden to do so
because of covenants and restrictions that govern aspects of owners'
and residents' conduct in those developments.</LD>
<LD>   Under the new law, sponsored by Sen. Dick Monteith (R-Modesto),
homeowners may display the banner without fear of legal
repercussions. Homeowner associations may restrict a flag display
only if it is necessary to protect public health and safety.</LD>

<HD>After Cleaning a Deck, Moisturize to Maintain the Wood</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MORRIS CAREY and JAMES CAREY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: What do you recommend for washing and finishing a wood
deck?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Powdered laundry detergent and hot water are usually
enough to clean a moderately dirty deck. But if the deck is older, it
might need a chemical wood brightener along with a pressure-washing.</LD>
<LD>   Once it's clean, moisturize the wood with an oil-base stain or
wood preservative.</LD>
<TE>   But don't buy any product with wax in it. When you wet a wood
surface that has been sealed with wax, the water will bead
beautifully.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, that beautiful coat of wax doesn't penetrate as far
beneath the surface as oil does. Wax evaporates far more rapidly than
oil--about two to three times as fast.</TE>
<TE>   A good wood preservative also has chemicals that prevent damage
from the sun's ultraviolet rays and from mildew attack.</TE>
<TE>   Windows Sweat Because Airtight Seal Was Broken</TE>
<TE>   Q: I have casement windows that used to have blinds between the
two panes of glass. The previous owner removed the blinds. The
windows sweat terribly.</TE>
<TE>   Must I replace the windows or is there some type of repair? They
sweat winter and summer. I need a permanent repair, not a temporary
fix.</TE>
<TE>   A: When the last owner removed the blinds, he permanently broke
the airtight seal around your insulated glass windows. We find it
interesting that the prior owner had the wherewithal to disassemble
the windows, remove the blinds and reassemble everything without
realizing he was permanently destroying the insulating value of each
window he worked on.</TE>
<TE>   The brand you have is probably Pella. They have been making this
type of window for a long time. You would be wise to call a Pella
dealer and ask to have just the insulated glass sections replaced.</TE>
<TE>   Pella will probably be more expensive than a local glass company,
but the warranty might be better.</TE>
<TE>   With insulated glass, warranty is everything. Some window
companies now offer lifetime warranties.</TE>
<TE>   Use Existing Frame to Install Vinyl Window</TE>
<TE>   Q: How do I replace a window that is double-hung with sash
weights? I want to replace it with a new vinyl window.</TE>
<TE>   A: Replacing a double-hung wood window with a vinyl one is simple
and cost-effective, as long as the main frame of the existing window
is in good condition and can be reused.</TE>
<TE>   First, remove all the trim from the four inside faces of the main
frame. You don't have to remove the ropes and weights; they can be
left in the frame's hollow sides. We suggest spraying expansive foam
into the balance of the void to improve energy efficiency.</TE>
<TE>   Without the trim, it's apparent that the main frame has an offset
in it that goes all the way around. The inside half of the frame is
slightly smaller than the outside half of the frame.</TE>
<TE>   The replacement window comes in its own frame and is set in place
from the outside, fitting into the larger opening. It butts against
the face of the smaller portion of the frame.</TE>
<TE>   If the main frame doesn't have a jog, wood trim is added to create
one. Trim is used to cover the caulked joint between the frame of the
new window and the old one. Our first double-hung window replacement
job took about 60 minutes per opening--removal, installation,
caulking, trim and paint touch-up. This can be done as a
do-it-yourself project.</TE>
<TE>   Mitering, Coping: Two Ways of Cutting Corners</TE>
<TE>   Q: In putting up crown molding, I understand that there is a more
attractive way to do corners than mitering. What is it? How do you do
it?</TE>
<TE>   A: Mitering is the quickest and easiest way to cut and join
moldings at corners where it is important for the moldings to appear
that there is no seam at the joint.</TE>
<TE>   With mitering, the ends to be joined on each of the two pieces of
wood are cut at an angle equal to half that of the corner angle. For
example: miter cuts at a 90-degree corner would each be at 45
degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Coping is an optional technique, and some say it is better than
mitering. But it can only be used for inside corners. Here, a coping
saw is used to cut the shape of one molding into the one joining
it--an end-to-face connection. A coped cut is best made with a slight
bevel to ensure a tight joint at the face of the molding.</TE>
<TE>   Coping cannot be used for outside corners. Here a miter must be
used. Properly cut, a miter is every bit as good as--if not better
than--a coped joint, especially when the molding is large and has an
intricate pattern.</TE>
<TE>   Prefab corners are available with some crown moldings that
eliminate the need for a miter cut and simplify installation.
However, most crown moldings are stand-alone items and must be
installed with a miter and/or a cope cut.</TE>

<LD>Actor Charlie Sheen, who married actress Denise Richards in mid-June,
has again put his contemporary-style home overlooking Malibu Lake on
the market, this time at $3.6 million.</LD>
<LD>   Sheen originally listed his 2.5-acre furnished home and compound a
year ago at $4.5 million. When it fell out of escrow, he took it off
the market.</LD>
<LD>   Now he and his bride want to move on to create a different type of
home. The compound has been described as "the ultimate bachelor pad,"
and it was the scene of many parties during Sheen's wilder days.</LD>
<TE>   The four-bedroom, 6,000-square-foot home has a poker room, cigar
room, billiards room and media room with four TVs. The house also has
an office and a batting cage. Sheen loves baseball and has
temperature-controlled cases for his collections of baseball
memorabilia.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the main house, there is a guest house, which Sheen turned
into "the aqua room" with walls of salt-water aquariums. There also
is a full gym.</TE>
<TE>   One of the more unusual features is a fire pole in the master
suite, which descends from a closet to the front entrance. There is
an infinity pool, rock spa and grotto on the grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Sheen, 36, spent 10 years redesigning the home, which was built in
1991.</TE>
<TE>   In the fall of 2000, he replaced Michael J. Fox on the ABC sitcom
"Spin City," which was canceled this spring. Sheen co-starred in such
movies as "Platoon" (1986) and "Wall Street" (1987).</TE>
<TE>   He met his wife in 2000 while shooting the movie "Good Advice."
They began dating after Richards made a guest appearance on "Spin
City" last year. They announced their engagement in January.</TE>
<TE>   Richards, 31, appears in the movie "Undercover Brother." She
played James Bond girl and nuclear physicist Christmas Jones in "The
World Is Not Enough" (1999). She co-stars in the upcoming movies "The
Third Wheel" and "Empire."</TE>
<TE>   Adrian Grant of Prudential John Aaroe &amp; Associates, Beverly Hills,
has the listing.</TE>
<TE>   Shavo Odadjian, bassist with the rock band System of a Down, has
become a first-time home buyer with his purchase of a Woodland Hills
house for $690,000, $5,000 more than the asking price.</TE>
<TE>   Odadjian, 26, bought a five-bedroom, 3,400-square-foot house that
was built in 1964. The house has been updated and has a kitchen with
a commercial stove, granite counters and marble floors. The master
suite has a spa tub, steam shower and walk-in closet. The grounds
have a pool and spa.</TE>
<TE>   The main-stage lineup of the U.S. leg of the Ozzfest 2002 summer
music tour features System of a Down as well as Ozzy Osbourne,
P.O.D., Rob Zombie, Drowning Pool, Adema, and Zakk Wylde's Black
Label Society.</TE>
<TE>   System of a Down, formed in 1994, sold 750,000 copies of its 1998
American Records debut and had a modern-rock radio hit with its song
"Sugar." The group is known for its raging sound, social conscience
and onstage theatrics, with its four members streaked with paint. The
band's recent "Toxicity" album sold about 4 million copies.</TE>
<TE>   Chad Rogers at Hilton &amp; Hyland, Beverly Hills, represented
Odadjian in his purchase.</TE>
<TE>   The Trousdale Estates home of the late art director-producer
Jacque Mapes and his late companion, producer Ross Hunter, has come
on the market for the first time since it was built in 1966. The
asking price is just under $4 million.</TE>
<TE>   Mapes died in June at 88. He was art director for such musicals as
"Singin' in the Rain" (1952).</TE>
<TE>   He and Hunter, who died at 75 in 1996, produced the films
"Thoroughly Modern Millie" (1967), starring Julie Andrews, and
"Airport" (1970). Hunter produced more than 60 movies, including
"Flower Drum Song" (1961), "Pillow Talk" (1959) and "Tammy and the
Bachelor" (1957).</TE>
<TE>   The couple worked with architect Hal Levit in the design and
construction of the Trousdale house, which has two master
suites--each with its own sitting room--and two guest suites in more
than 7,100 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   Designed for entertaining, the house has rooms that open onto the
grounds with a pool and city-to-ocean views. The living room has a
fireplace and a wet bar. A screening room area has a bathroom, steam
room and separate entrance.</TE>
<TE>   Cissy Wellman of Coldwell Banker Previews in Brentwood and Studio
City has the listing.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Tennenbaum, co-producer of "The Bourne Identity," and his
wife, former Napa Valley chef Julie Anne, have purchased a home in
the Beverly Hills area for close to its asking price of $895,000.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Tennenbaum is also a personal manager of writers and
directors at Flashpoint Entertainment, which he heads.</TE>
<TE>   The three-bedroom, three-bathroom home was built in 1941 for
Roswell Hoffman, who was recognized in the film industry for his
camera work and special effects for director Alfred Hitchcock.
Hoffman died last year.</TE>
<TE>   The Tennenbaums are restoring and updating the home with its
lawns, greenhouses and extensive gardens.</TE>
<TE>   Judy Lubin of DBL Exceptional Homes represented the buyers,
sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Michael McColl, an actor/voice-over artist heard in ad campaigns
for such movies as "Die Another Day," and Gwyn Fawcett, actress and
founding member of the Circle X Theatre in West Hollywood, have
purchased a nearly $800,000 house south of Ventura Boulevard in the
San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The gated, French Normandy-style home was built in 1936 and has
two bedrooms, an office or third bedroom, and two bathrooms in about
2,600 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   McColl also has been involved in Circle X productions, and Fawcett
has appeared on the TV series "That's Life" (2001-02).</TE>
<TE>   Robert Lee Walters of Leland Properties, Studio City, represented
the buyers, and Robert E. Howell, Coldwell Banker, Beverly Hills
East, had the listing.</TE>

<LD>Regarding "Taking Back the Streets" by Karen E. Klein (July 7):
Own-your-owns were not apartments converted to cooperatives but were
built specifically for retiring adults who wanted to own their
residence but not have grounds upkeep.</LD>
<LD>   They are mostly in Long Beach and Pasadena, built between 1958 and
1962 when there were no condominium codes. They have their own deeds.</LD>
<LD>   The developers did not envision many buyers would have cars, so
few of them have garages or parking, and those garages were sold
separately with their own deeds.</LD>
<TE>   Bylaws of the time have items that do not conform to current laws
on discrimination and thus are invalid but are a red flag to lenders.
Most of these bylaws have since been changed, and many own-your-owns
have been grandfathered into condominiums, although they do not have
the amenities of current condominiums.</TE>

<LD>Regarding "Excluding Owner With AIDS Would Pose Problems" (July 14):
Bravo to Stephen Glassman and Donie Vanitzian for their forthright
and unflinching response to the condo board member who wanted to
exclude a homeowner with AIDS--and his friends--from using the common
facilities.</LD>
<LD>   I find it shocking and appalling in this day and age, and in this
city in particular, that there are still people so ill-informed about
this subject.</LD>
<LD>   The next-to-last paragraph says it all--to this person and anyone
else still in the dark about AIDS--educate yourself.</LD>

<LD>Ownership method -- A July 7 story about Alamitos Beach misstated
that purchasers of "own-your-owns" buy shares in a cooperative. In
fact, "own-your-owns" are a form of common interest subdivision,
regulated in California by the Davis-Stirling Act, in which the
individual owner gets a deed entitling him or her to an undivided
interest in the project and the exclusive right to occupy a specific
unit.</LD>

<HD>Mission Statement</HD>
<DH>A trip to California historic sites inspires a North
Hollywood couple in the conversion of their outdated garage</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY PRICE-ROBINSON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Janice Stango-Gonzales and Daniel Gonzales decided to convert
their dirt-floored, rat-infested garage into a mission-style cottage,
they took their inspiration from the real thing.</LD>
<LD>   During a week-and-a-half-long road trip, the couple visited all
but two of California's missions, reveling in the materials, shapes
and colors that would one day infuse their own project.</LD>
<LD>   The idea for the transformation came during Stango-Gonzales' daily
meditation, when a vision of the finished building came into her
mind. "It looked like a little California mission," she said.</LD>
<TE>   The $10,000 remodel, which includes such mission elements as a
bell tower inspired by one at Mission La Purisima Concepcion in
Lompoc, occurred during six months in 2000 as a part-time project
that evolved as materials were discovered at flea markets or salvage
yards, bought through the Recycler or given to them by friends.</TE>
<TE>   "We found something we loved and said, 'It'll find its own place,'
" said Stango-Gonzales, who met her husband at the Bodhi Tree
bookstore in 1997; they married two years later. At about that time,
the couple realized they needed some extra space in her 1926 North
Hollywood house, which bustled then with the energy of her two
teenage children. Converting the garage--which had openings too
narrow for modern-day cars and was used only for storage--seemed like
a good idea.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted it for my counseling," said Stango-Gonzales, a counselor
and massage therapist.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted it for painting," recalled Gonzales, an artist and
carpenter of Basque heritage who had already brightened the house
with vivid colors, unique angel sculptures (called "caretakers") and
his specialty, "sacred spirit altars."</TE>
<TE>   The building, however, did not look promising with its flat roof,
old stucco, open rafters and interior walls that were little more
than bare studs over tar paper. A shed had been tacked onto the rear.</TE>
<TE>   But Gonzales saw beyond all that to the basic structure, which was
sound. "It's old redwood," he said. "The beauty was there." And the
garage had a pleasant setting, next to a pool and shaded by
eucalyptus.</TE>
<TE>   Before they got started, the couple consulted a real estate broker
about the ramifications of turning the garage into a studio. They
were told that a carport would have to be built when they sold the
house, or a lower appraisal would result.</TE>
<TE>   The garage already had electricity, and because it was near a
pool, it could be plumbed and considered a recreation building or
pool house.</TE>
<TE>   The major tasks were building a front facade with a bell tower,
window and door, creating a floor, finishing the walls and creating a
bathroom and bedroom in the rear shed portion. Redoing the ceiling
was unnecessary, as the couple, inspired by the exposed wood ceiling
of Mission San Fernando, decided to keep theirs in the same rustic
mode.</TE>
<TE>   To give the front a mission motif, Gonzales and a friend built a
parapet. It has whimsical curves, the bell tower and round post butts
attached to the front to suggest vigas.</TE>
<TE>   An old French window was added, and Gonzales dabbed or
"snowflaked" the panes with various colors of acrylic paint.
Streaming sunlight gives it a stained-glass look.</TE>
<TE>   A sturdy pair of French doors was a find for only $10 in the
Recycler. Thick exterior moldings were applied around the doors.</TE>
<TE>   When it came time to paint the exterior, the couple chose a rich
salmon, inspired by the vibrant colors at the mission in Lompoc.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, the couple decided on a granite mosaic floor after they
discovered that some stone yards throw away broken fragments. After a
wood subfloor was laid, Gonzales let the accumulated stack of granite
pieces determine the layout of the floor--a mandala.</TE>
<TE>   "We only had one of this color," he said, standing on a large
remnant in the middle of the mandala; "so many of this color," he
said, stepping out from the center; "so many of this color." And so
on, with larger areas of color building to the edges of the room.
Near the doors, the thresholds are different colors.</TE>
<TE>   The walls were drywalled and a counter was added to hold the most
expensive item in the remodel, a $100 sink from Mexico. A wooden
shutter turned on its side became the hinged cover for a horizontal
cabinet.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, the bathroom came together with found and discovered
items. The old tub, which Gonzales painted, was a gift from a friend.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't just give it to us," Gonzales said. "He delivered it."</TE>
<TE>   The wainscoting was fashioned from the wood of the old cedar
garage doors. Moldings around the windows match those on the exterior
and throughout. The small bedroom, with a wood floor, was intended to
be a remove-your-shoes-before-entering meditation room but has turned
out to be "a place where people like to hang out," Stango-Gonzales
said. Two giant French windows were made into sliding doors
overlooking a private patio.</TE>
<TE>   The flowers and vines on the patio, and landscaping around the
pool and courtyard in front of the cottage, were inspired by the
flower gardens around Mission Carmel, and the courtyard itself was
inspired by Mission Buenaventura.</TE>
<TE>   The back patio, with a large Buddha statue sitting in a chair, has
turned out to be Stango-Gonzales' special spot. It is her daily
ritual here to "drink coffee, pray, meditate and give thanks."</TE>
<TE>   "We have been really blessed," she said.</TE>

<LD>Shattered glass was near the doorstep when the tenant returned home.
A small window had been broken out. The burglar apparently had
reached inside, flipped the latch and climbed in.</LD>
<LD>   Like most of us, the resident never expected to come home to find
that a stranger had gone through his home and stolen his valuable
belongings.</LD>
<LD>   According to the California attorney general's office, more than 6
million break-ins will occur this year--that's one every 10 seconds.
Almost half of those burglaries are through unlocked doors or
windows, meaning burglars simply walked or crawled into the place.</LD>
<TE>   How can you avoid becoming the next statistic? Here are some tips
from detectives at the Los Angeles Police Department's West L.A.
division (www.lapdonline.org) and other sources:</TE>
<TE>   * Lock your doors at all times, even when you're home, and every
time you go out--even if it's "just for a minute." Close windows when
you go out too.</TE>
<TE>   * Deadbolts should be installed on every exterior door. For
renters, California Civil Code 1941.3 requires the owner or manager
to provide "an operable deadbolt lock on each main swinging entry
door of a dwelling unit." Details are available at
www.leginfo.ca.gov.</TE>
<TE>   * Sliding windows and doors can be secured with a wooden dowel,
broomstick or metal rod that fits snugly in the track. Frame pins are
also available. For wood windows, a metal pin or lock (available at
most hardware stores) can be installed.</TE>
<TE>   * Be sure to get the landlord's permission in writing before doing
anything that permanently alters the property.</TE>
<TE>   * Warning: Installing window security bars may violate state law.
In 1996, two laws regulating the type of security bars allowed in
California were passed after five children trapped behind security
bars died in a 1995 Oakland house fire. A 1997 East Palo Alto fire
that killed more than nine people prompted another revision of the
law, which became effective in 1999. For details, check with your
local fire department's business division (the number can be found in
the front of the phone book's white pages).</TE>
<TE>   * There are thousands of types of alarms, but remember: They are a
deterrent, not a guarantee.</TE>
<TE>   * If you're going out of town, have a trusted person come by and
collect your mail and any fliers, etc. Be sure to put several lights
on timers. Vary lights in the dwelling and include a radio that comes
on to a loud station.</TE>
<TE>   * Communicate with your neighbors and watch out for each other.
Recently, a burglar was captured and arrested while still in an
apartment. A concerned neighbor saw someone unfamiliar pulling out a
louvered glass panel at an apartment next door. The neighbor called
911. Police arrived and arrested the suspect.</TE>
<TE>   * Start or join a neighborhood or apartment watch group. Your
local police department can help you organize a group in which
neighbors learn crime-prevention techniques and are trained to
recognize and report suspicious activity. Such groups also inspire
community spirit.</TE>
<TE>   * Even with the best security, break-ins happen. Be sure you have
renter's insurance for your belongings, especially valuables. Your
landlord's policy will not cover your property.</TE>
<TE>   * Burglars threaten more than your home. They can commit rapes,
robberies and assaults if you surprise them or are home when they
break in. If you get home and notice a torn screen, open door, broken
glass or anything unusual, don't go inside or touch anything. Leave
immediately and call the police from another location.</TE>
<TE>   * If you think you hear someone breaking in when you're home,
leave safely if you can. If you can't, lock yourself in a room with a
telephone and quietly call 911. If the intruder is in your room,
pretend to be asleep.</TE>
<TE>   With a little diligence and cooperative neighbors, everyone can
rest easier and perhaps avoid becoming another burglary statistic.</TE>

<LD>An automatic garage-door opener will enhance the comfort and safety
of your home.</LD>
<LD>   Contrary to belief, automatic openers can't be activated by
low-flying planes, microwave ovens or transistor radios. Yet a
transmitter in the wrong hands could expose your home to entry by
uninvited strangers.</LD>
<LD>   Transmitters should be treated like house keys. When parking
somewhere other than in your garage, make sure the transmitter is
locked inside the car.</LD>

<HD>USC Helps Staff Buy in Community</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Even one year later, Ken and Billie Wallace still marvel that they
can practically reach out and touch Los Angeles' downtown skyline and
watch Dodger Stadium fireworks from their Boyle Heights home, a
purchase made through a special USC homeownership program.</LD>
<LD>   Established in 1995 by USC President Steven Sample as part of a
broad effort to strengthen ties within the communities surrounding
the university, USC's Neighborhood Homeownership Program so far has
helped 77 qualified employees, including the Wallaces, make monthly
mortgage payments, replace outdated plumbing, build fences and
landscape properties situated within walking distance of the school's
two urban campuses.</LD>
<LD>   Currently, about 6% of the USC University Park faculty and staff
live within the two ZIP Codes encompassing that campus.</LD>
<TE>   Under the guidelines of the Neighborhood Homeownership Program,
qualified participants--faculty and staff who work at least half time
and own and occupy homes near campus--receive $25,000, paid in
increments over seven years, according to program administrator
Maxine McNeal.</TE>
<TE>   The participants must show proof of homeownership first, and must
remain in good standing with the lenders throughout the life of the
contract. If they move out of the home or sell it, the payments stop.</TE>
<TE>   "Twenty-five thousand dollars doesn't sound like a lot of money,
but it can make the difference of whether people are lifetime renters
or property owners," Sample said. "The program benefits us at the
university too because property owners make the best neighbors. We
also have tremendous stability in our workforce here."</TE>
<TE>   In the Wallaces', case, the promise of funding actually helped
them get a bigger and better house than they had hoped for.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Wallace, 56, a longtime public safety employee at the school's
health science campus, and his wife, Billie, 57, a South Pasadena
Police Department employee, did not believe they could qualify for a
home, so they never tried. After hearing about the program, however,
the couple was spurred to get a home loan and then qualified for the
university stipend, which helps pay the mortgage.</TE>
<TE>   The three-bedroom house, which cost about $120,000, is the
couple's first.</TE>
<TE>   "Getting that money shoved me into homeownership," Ken Wallace
said. "It has given me a sense of self-worth, to feel that I've
arrived."</TE>
<TE>   Patty and Ralph Cardenas were among the first to enroll in the
homeownership program, nearly seven years ago. The couple, who had
one baby at the time (they now are parents of three children),
originally had not planned to look for a home near the university's
health science campus.</TE>
<TE>   But after finding their $160,000, three-bedroom home in Hillside
Village, across the street from an elementary school, the pair joined
the program, which allowed them to buy a bigger house than they could
have afforded otherwise, said Patty Cardenas, an 11-year USC
employee.</TE>
<TE>   Universities across Southern California increasingly are having to
find incentives to attract faculty and staff to a region where median
home prices today run from $258,000 in Los Angeles County to a
staggering $346,000 in Orange County, according to DataQuick
Information Services, which tracks home prices and sales across the
state.</TE>
<TE>   UC Irvine offers luxury homes for affordable prices in the
school's University Hills, a faculty-only community where one can
qualify for special low-interest loans backed by the university.</TE>
<TE>   Several Cal State campuses also are buying up land on which they
will build affordable homes for faculty, a strategy that is paying
off in attracting sought-after professors.</TE>
<TE>   The USC program, in addition to helping staff members achieve
homeownership, boasts some success in bringing faculty and staff to
neighborhoods whose residents historically have viewed the university
as an island of wealth that often ignored its neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Sociology professor Leland Saito, 46, a first-time buyer and
recent participant in the USC homeownership program, jumped at the
opportunity to join the university community and is thrilled to live
minutes from campus after years of apartment living at his previous
teaching post in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Saito is studying the economic revitalization of downtown Los
Angeles and said he now will get first-hand experience of
neighborhoods undergoing demographic changes and economic
transformation. As an added bonus, he rides his bicycle to campus
from his three-bedroom, Spanish-style house, a convenience he never
imagined enjoying. "This gives me a chance to be a part of the campus
life here," Saito said.</TE>
<TE>   Close proximity to campus and downtown cultural events propelled
physics professor Tu-Nan Chang, 57, and his wife Hsiao-Lin Chang, a
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center biologist, to their University Park
townhouse four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   After commuting to campus from West Covina for about 23 years,
Tu-Nan Chang now leases from the university the land on which his
townhouse sits and owns the townhouse itself.</TE>
<TE>   "I was sick and tired of all that traffic," said Chang, who served
on the original committee that established USC's outreach programs.
"We wanted to improve the neighborhood, to get community members
involved with the university, rather than have them view us as
outsiders."</TE>
<TE>   The only downside to USC's neighborhood improvement plan,
according to those involved, is the impact on renters, especially
university students, who now are facing higher rents as property
values have increased in some areas around the campus.</TE>
<TE>   But most of the residents in the area are happy to see their homes
appreciate in value, said Carolyn Cohen, 33, who with her husband,
Steve, 40, bought their home near the University Park campus a year
and a half ago.</TE>
<TE>   The couple, both of whom work for the university, flipped when
they saw the 103-year-old, 3,000-square-foot Craftsman house just
blocks from the campus. After searching for months for an appropriate
home for themselves and their numerous pets, they jumped at the
chance to fix up the house that features three bedrooms, an
entertainment room, two offices and a breakfast room, all for
$260,000.</TE>
<TE>   "I love this house," said Carolyn Cohen, who is using the USC
funds to help with the mortgage and to refurbish the house. "I feel
more a part of the community.... It's been a real positive
experience."</TE>

<HD>Juggling Justice in a Confounding Case</HD>
<DH>Courts: Victoria Banks had said she was pregnant, even
though she'd been sterilized, and had pleaded guilty to manslaughter.
A fertility test could clear her.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>

<LD>Last in a weekly series</LD>
<LD>   BUTLER, Ala.--Rick Hutchinson drove two hours straight from the
doctor's office in Birmingham, his excitement building as he barreled
down the country roads past piney woods, logging trucks and pulp
mills.</LD>
<LD>   At the end of a dirt road on the edge of town, the Banks clan and
their friends had gathered to hear his news. The lawyer stepped from
his sport utility vehicle clutching a set of X-rays.</LD>
<TE>   Victoria Banks' fallopian tubes were blocked, he said; her tubal
ligation was intact.</TE>
<TE>   It was quiet for a moment as the group grasped the importance of
this information. Then they hooted, hugged and danced.</TE>
<TE>   This was all the evidence he needed, Hutchinson thought. The three
mentally retarded residents imprisoned for killing a baby must be
innocent. There had never even been a baby!</TE>
<TE>   Hutchinson represented only one of the three--Victoria Banks'
estranged husband, Medell Banks. He quickly asked a court to overturn
his client's conviction. Lawyers for the other two, Victoria and her
sister Dianne Tucker, didn't join the appeal. They waited to see what
the court would do.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 20, 2001, Banks' family members and their supporters
packed Judge Lee McPhearson's sweltering courtroom on the second
floor of the Choctaw County Courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Michael Steinkampf, director of reproductive endocrinology and
fertility at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, was the main
witness for the defense. The test he had conducted on Victoria Banks,
he said, proved with absolute certainty that she was sterile.</TE>
<TE>   He had no doubt, he said, that the woman had faked her pregnancy.</TE>
<TE>   Dist. Atty. Bobby Keahey argued the test proved nothing of the
kind.</TE>
<TE>   Victoria Banks still could have given birth in 1999, he
said--although this would have required an improbable chain of
events:</TE>
<TE>   After her tubal ligation, the tubes spontaneously repaired
themselves (which happens in one out of 100 cases), allowing her to
get pregnant. After she gave birth, she acquired a sexually
transmitted disease, leading to a pelvic infection that reblocked the
fallopian tubes.</TE>
<TE>   Keahey called Dr. Timothy Hughes, a Mobile, Ala., gynecologist, to
the stand to testify that this was all possible. And the prosecutor
introduced evidence that Banks had indeed been treated for a sexually
transmitted disease a few weeks after the suspected birth date of the
baby.</TE>
<TE>   Steinkampf disputed this scenario. X-rays of the blockage in
Victoria Banks' fallopian tubes were not consistent with this, he
testified. Blockage caused by disease would occur higher in the
tubes. Instead, the X-rays showed the tubes ending close to the
uterus in neat, symmetrical nubs -- just as one would expect in a
successful tubal ligation.</TE>
<TE>   To Judge McPhearson, this sounded like a draw: two competing
theories by two reputable physicians.</TE>
<TE>   But the prosecutor wasn't finished. He called Victoria Banks to
the stand.</TE>
<TE>   Did she remember admitting giving birth when she pleaded guilty to
manslaughter, Keahey asked her.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," said Banks, her voice barely audible.</TE>
<TE>   "Tell the judge if that's the truth or not," the prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," she answered.</TE>
<TE>   Keahey sat down and Hutchinson rose to cross-examine her.</TE>
<TE>   Why had she accepted the plea agreement, he asked, his tone
soothing, fatherly.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't remember," Banks said.</TE>
<TE>   You were afraid of the electric chair, weren't you, Hutchinson
said.</TE>
<TE>   Banks hesitated, then said: "I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   "For your sake, and the sake of this court, we all need to know
the truth," Hutchinson said. "Did you have a baby in the summer of
'99?"</TE>
<TE>   Banks did not respond.</TE>
<TE>   "And [were] Medell and Dianne present?"</TE>
<TE>   Still, she was silent.</TE>
<TE>   Judge McPhearson told her she needed to answer.</TE>
<TE>   "No," Banks said.</TE>
<TE>   "Pardon?" McPhearson said.</TE>
<TE>   "No," Banks said. "I didn't."</TE>
<TE>   For a moment, the courtroom was still. Then Keahey rose.</TE>
<TE>   Hadn't Banks told her doctor that she was pregnant, he asked.</TE>
<TE>   She admitted that she had.</TE>
<TE>   And hadn't she told the same thing to Sheriff Donald Lolley?</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," she said.</TE>
<TE>   And her cellmate, Connie James?</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Were you pregnant when Dr. Hensleigh saw you?" Keahey asked.</TE>
<TE>   Banks paused a moment, then said: "No."</TE>
<TE>   Soon, the hearing was over, leaving Judge McPhearson to ponder
where justice was to be found in this confounding case.</TE>
<TE>   He could give no weight to Banks' testimony, he thought. She never
told the same story twice. But Steinkampf's test--that was
significant new evidence.</TE>
<TE>   To throw out the conviction, the judge had to find that the new
evidence "probably" would have resulted in a different verdict. Was
the test enough to overcome the witnesses who said Victoria Banks had
looked pregnant, the prison doctor who was convinced she had been?
The judge, as he admitted later, was torn.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 28, a month after the hearing, McPhearson gathered the
attorneys in his chambers to announce his ruling. His first words:</TE>
<TE>   "None of you are going to be happy with this."</TE>
<TE>   He could not find that Steinkampf's test probably would have
resulted in a different verdict, only that it might have. So Medell
Banks' conviction would stand.</TE>
<TE>   However, he said, he was reducing Medell Banks' sentence to 28
months followed by five years' probation. Having already served two
years, he would soon be a free man.</TE>
<TE>   Months later, McPhearson explained his thinking to a reporter.
"Under Alabama law, I'm not so sure that the defense met their
burden," he said, "but you've got a situation where you can't ignore
that test."</TE>
<TE>   How important was it?</TE>
<TE>   "There could be an innocent person in jail," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Medell Banks is innocent, the judge said, overturning his
verdict might not be "the proper thing to do." Keahey would just
retry him, exposing the retarded man once again to the risk of life
without parole.</TE>
<TE>   Unable to determine the truth, Judge McPhearson did what other
participants in the case had done before him. He weighed the risks
and benefits, figured the odds.</TE>
<TE>   The judge thought his decision would bring the 2-year-old Medell
Banks case to a reasonable conclusion. It did not.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking complete vindication for his client, Hutchinson went to
the state Court of Appeals on Oct. 5, asking it to overturn the
verdict and grant a new trial.</TE>
<TE>   Keahey responded by appealing the sentence reduction, noting that
state law gives a judge only 60 days to reduce a sentence after it is
imposed. When McPhearson ruled, that deadline had expired.</TE>
<TE>   The Court of Appeals, which has not yet ruled on the request for a
new trial, quickly agreed with the prosecutor about the sentence
reduction, reinstating the 15-year term late in November.</TE>
<TE>   Medell Banks and his two co-defendants were back where they
started, but now they had a small army of supporters. Led by Carrie
Johnson, a 73-year-old retired schoolteacher and the mother of a
young civil rights worker run down 30 years ago near the courthouse,
a group held a news conference and started a legal fund. A petition
was circulated and fliers were posted.</TE>
<TE>   The Equal Justice Initiative, a civil rights group in Montgomery,
Ala., that usually limits itself to death penalty cases, has taken up
Tucker's cause too. It contends that she is innocent, that she had
incompetent legal counsel and that prosecutors withheld evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Medell Banks has completed the substance abuse program at
Draper Correctional Facility. Hutchinson attended his graduation
ceremony in May.</TE>
<TE>   Victoria Banks is taking GED classes at Julia Tutwiler Prison for
Women. Her sister, Dianne Tucker, couldn't pass the qualifying test
for the program and is working as a prison housekeeper. Their mother
died recently, and their father, suffering from diabetes and cancer,
is near death.</TE>
<TE>   As for Keahey, the district attorney, he isn't done with Victoria
Banks yet.</TE>
<TE>   She lied when she told Judge McPhearson she had not been pregnant,
Keahey says. He has brought a new charge against her--perjury.</TE>
<TE>   To folks in town who think this seems vindictive, he says this:</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to let it lie until they do."</TE>

the test enough to overcome the witnesses who said Victoria Banks had
looked pregnant, the prison doctor who was convinced she had been?
The judge, as he admitted later, was torn.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 28, a month after the hearing, McPhearson gathered the
attorneys in his chambers to announce his ruling. His first words:</TE>
<TE>   "None of you are going to be happy with this."</TE>
<TE>   He could not find that Steinkampf's test probably would have
resulted in a different verdict, only that it might have. So Medell
Banks' conviction would stand.</TE>
<TE>   However, he said, he was reducing Medell Banks' sentence to 28
months followed by five years' probation. Having already served two
years, he would soon be a free man.</TE>
<TE>   Months later, McPhearson explained his thinking to a reporter.
"Under Alabama law, I'm not so sure that the defense met their
burden," he said, "but you've got a situation where you can't ignore
that test."</TE>
<TE>   How important was it?</TE>
<TE>   "There could be an innocent person in jail," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Medell Banks is innocent, the judge said, overturning his
verdict might not be "the proper thing to do." Keahey would just
retry him, exposing the retarded man once again to the risk of life
without parole.</TE>
<TE>   Unable to determine the truth, Judge McPhearson did what other
participants in the case had done before him. He weighed the risks
and benefits, figured the odds.</TE>
<TE>   The judge thought his decision would bring the 2-year-old Medell
Banks case to a reasonable conclusion. It did not.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking complete vindication for his client, Hutchinson went to
the state Court of Appeals on Oct. 5, asking it to overturn the
verdict and grant a new trial.</TE>
<TE>   Keahey responded by appealing the sentence reduction, noting that
state law gives a judge only 60 days to reduce a sentence after it is
imposed. When McPhearson ruled, that deadline had expired.</TE>
<TE>   The Court of Appeals, which has not yet ruled on the request for a
new trial, quickly agreed with the prosecutor about the sentence
reduction, reinstating the 15-year term late in November.</TE>
<TE>   Medell Banks and his two co-defendants were back where they
started, but now they had a small army of supporters. Led by Carrie
Johnson, a 73-year-old retired schoolteacher and the mother of a
young civil rights worker run down 30 years ago near the courthouse,
a group held a news conference and started a legal fund. A petition
was circulated and fliers were posted.</TE>
<TE>   The Equal Justice Initiative, a civil rights group in Montgomery,
Ala., that usually limits itself to death penalty cases, has taken up
Tucker's cause too. It contends that she is innocent, that she had
incompetent legal counsel and that prosecutors withheld evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Medell Banks has completed the substance abuse program at
Draper Correctional Facility. Hutchinson attended his graduation
ceremony in May.</TE>
<TE>   Victoria Banks is taking GED classes at Julia Tutwiler Prison for
Women. Her sister, Dianne Tucker, couldn't pass the qualifying test
for the program and is working as a prison housekeeper. Their mother
died recently, and their father, suffering from diabetes and cancer,
is near death.</TE>
<TE>   As for Keahey, the district attorney, he isn't done with Victoria
Banks yet.</TE>
<TE>   She lied when she told Judge McPhearson she had not been pregnant,
Keahey says. He has brought a new charge against her--perjury.</TE>
<TE>   To folks in town who think this seems vindictive, he says this:</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to let it lie until they do."</TE>

<TE>   THE STORY SO FAR</TE>
<TE>   Fearful of being sentenced to life without parole, or even to
death, all three retarded defendants accepted a plea bargain. All
three were sentenced to 15 years in prison. But one of their lawyers
remained unsatisfied. He saw little evidence that the baby they had
supposedly killed had ever been born. After all, Victoria Banks'
tubes had been tied years before, and the chances of the fallopian
tubes reattaching spontaneously were only 1 in 100. He arranged a
medical test to determine whether her tubes were still blocked. Three
lives depended on this, he knew, as he awaited the results.</TE>

<HD>California's 'Secret' Past Beginning to Be Told</HD>
<DH>History: Indians campaign to tell the story of the near
extermination of the state's native inhabitants. They score some
victories, including at Round Valley.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHELLE LOCKE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>COVELO, Calif.</DL>
<LD>For decades, the state landmark declaring that the majestic Round
Valley was discovered by white settlers in 1854 was like salt on a
wound to valley tribes.</LD>
<LD>   Native Americans, after all, had lived in the region for eons
before settlers arrived. Also missing from the plaque was any
reference to the tide of Indian deaths and cultural destruction
unleashed by the "discovery."</LD>
<LD>   This year, state officials installed a revised plaque
acknowledging the valley's original inhabitants and explaining what
happened to them.</LD>
<TE>   To some, it was a victory in a long-running campaign to set the
record straight on California's still largely secret history--the
forces, accidental and deliberate, that swept away all but a handful
of the state's native inhabitants.</TE>
<TE>   "The way I feel is the way the East Berliners felt when the wall
started getting knocked down," said Round Valley tribal council
member Ernie Merrifield. "It's a sense of new freedom and the key
word is 'truth.' "</TE>
<TE>   The truth about Indians in California isn't pleasant. Driven from
the land that sustained them, decimated by unfamiliar diseases, they
were hunted nearly to extinction during the Gold Rush. Once estimated
at 300,000, only 15,000 remained by the 1900 census. Almost 95% of
the original population had vanished.</TE>
<TE>   "Californians are unaware, generally, that our forbears committed
themselves to the literal extermination of the California Indian
people," says James J. Rawls of Diablo Valley College, who has
written several books about California history.</TE>
<TE>   But confronting that past isn't easy.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in the West, the question of historical perspective has
been tackled. In Montana, the 1876 battle where the 7th Cavalry was
defeated was characterized as Custer's Last Stand and portrayed for
decades as the site of a tragic U.S. loss rather than a resounding
Indian victory.</TE>
<TE>   The battlefield was named for Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer,
and the only memorial was to the men who fought and died with him.
But after years of effort by American Indians, the site was renamed
the Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument, and construction
has begun on an Indian memorial.</TE>
<TE>   It took Round Valley tribes four decades to get the wording on
their plaque changed. Clashes over historic symbols elsewhere have
also led to protracted battles.</TE>
<TE>   A statue of early San Jose Mayor Thomas Fallon has been stowed in
an Oakland warehouse for more than a decade after protests from
Mexican Americans that it represented U.S. imperialism.</TE>
<TE>   The Fallon statue is expected to be installed downtown this
summer, now that other new monuments are in place, recognizing the
area's Latino, Spanish and Indian leaders.</TE>
<TE>   In San Francisco, statues of Juan Bautista de Anza, who led the
first group of settlers from Mexico to San Francisco, and King Carlos
III, who supported the United States during the Revolutionary War,
sit in a warehouse, banished from public display because of
controversy over their association with colonialism.</TE>
<TE>   A compromise was reached on a third San Francisco statue, the
Pioneer Monument, which stands near the main library.</TE>
<TE>   The century-old statue raised hackles in the 1990s because it
portrays an Indian in a subservient position to a Spanish missionary
and a cowboy.</TE>
<TE>   The Roman Catholic Church and the Spanish consul objected to
initial efforts to write a plaque explaining the history of American
Indians, complaining that it unfairly singled them out as responsible
for the Indians' demise. The plaque was eventually reworded to detail
other factors as well.</TE>
<TE>   The compromise didn't satisfy everyone; some American Indians
wanted the statue mothballed.</TE>
<TE>   Rawls, who worked on the plaque wording, thinks old symbols should
be put in accurate context, but not swept away entirely. "We all know
if we're ignorant of the past, we're condemned to repeat it. We Homo
sapiens need to be reminded of our capacity for evil just as we need
to be reminded of our capacity for good."</TE>
<TE>   In Round Valley, a breathtaking bowl of fir-lined mountains about
150 miles north of San Francisco, reservation residents hated the
plaque from the day it went up in 1959.</TE>
<TE>   People threw paint on it, wrote the word "LIES" across it and even
shot at it.</TE>
<TE>   But until recently, no one expected to change it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just like the attitude was, 'You can't fight City Hall,' "
Merrifield said.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the state Office of Historic Preservation began
holding community meetings and reviewing proposals for new language
for the plaque.</TE>
<TE>   Descendants of the original settlers liked the plaque the way it
was. Indians and other whites, including some with family histories
of being run out of the valley by some of the original pioneers,
wanted it changed.</TE>
<TE>   There were some state-brokered compromises. Indians wanted
"genocide," to reflect how their numbers were ravaged by disease,
malnutrition and attacks. "The state mellowed that out and toned it
down to 'conflict,' " Merrifield said.</TE>
<TE>   The final wording acknowledges the Yuki Indians as the original
inhabitants of the valley and points out that, after conflict with
European settlers in the 1850s, the region was declared a reservation
and other tribes were forced onto the land. In 1864, the government
reduced reservation land by four-fifths.</TE>
<TE>   One sunny afternoon last spring, about 200 people gathered on
Inspiration Point under a bright blue sky to dedicate the new marker.</TE>
<TE>   "Forgiving is not forgetting," Round Valley tribe member Cora Lee
Simmons said. "It's just letting go of the hurt."</TE>

<HD>New Home for Yangtze's 'Goddesses'</HD>
<DH>Preservation: China's plan to save freshwater dolphins and
other rare animals underscores the environmental cost of the nation's
rapid economic growth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN FACKLER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>SHANGHAI</DL>
<LD>Chinese scientists are preparing a drastic rescue plan for one of the
planet's rarest animals -- a dolphin with the misfortune of living in
one of China's busiest and most polluted rivers.</LD>
<LD>   The plan calls for fishermen to round up all the fewer than 100
Yangtze River dolphins, one of only four freshwater dolphin species
in the world. The captured dolphins would then be released in a
protected reserve.</LD>
<LD>   Government scientists say the dolphins' only hope is to be moved
from their sole natural habitat, the lower Yangtze River in central
China. Their numbers have dwindled rapidly with the increase in
fishing, boat traffic and industry along China's longest river.</LD>
<TE>   Other experts agree that unless something is done, the blue-gray
dolphins -- the same size as their more playful ocean cousins but
with longer, thinner snouts -- will be extinct in 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   But they say that simply relocating the dolphins won't solve the
river's worsening condition, or help other species. They also say
there may be difficulty catching the smart, fast-moving creatures and
getting them to accept their new home.</TE>
<TE>   "Tracking down the dolphins will be like looking for a needle on
the bottom of the ocean," said Zhou Kaiya, an expert on dolphins at
Nanjing University.</TE>
<TE>   The extreme nature of the plan to transplant an entire species
underscores the mounting environmental costs of China's rapid
economic growth.</TE>
<TE>   The government has begun or is considering expensive programs to
save other rare animals as well, including leopards, tigers and
China's most distinctive wild animal, the panda.</TE>
<TE>   The dolphins have lived in the Yangtze for 25 million years.
Called the "Goddesses of the Yangtze," they were a traditional symbol
of peace and prosperity to Chinese living along the river's banks.</TE>
<TE>   But in recent decades, the dolphins have been decimated, most of
them by becoming entangled in fishermen's nets and hooks. There were
about 6,000 in the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   "The dolphins have no chance of survival if they stay in the
river," said Wang Ding, deputy director of the Institute of
Hydrobiology in the central city of Wuhan.</TE>
<TE>   The institute will oversee the relocation effort, which Wang said
has been approved by the Ministry of Forestry and could begin next
year.</TE>
<TE>   The $6-million plan would hire 50 fishermen in boats to search a
1,100-mile stretch of the Yangtze and capture the dolphins using
nets.</TE>
<TE>   The animals would then be released in the newly created
Tian'erzhou nature reserve in Hubei province. The reserve is built
around a 13-mile segment of the Yangtze that was left behind when the
main river changed course.</TE>
<TE>   The reserve is already home to 20 finless porpoises, another
threatened aquatic mammal found in the Yangtze and elsewhere in Asia.
Wang said the porpoises, which were put there on a trial basis 12
years ago by the biology institute in Wuhan, have thrived.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say the Yangtze River dolphins aren't as hardy as the
porpoises.</TE>
<TE>   They note that only one has survived in captivity, at the
institute in Wuhan. Attempts to breed the 24-year-old male, named Qi
Qi, have failed. Three prospective mates died soon after capture, as
have all other caught dolphins.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts also doubt that the captive population would offer a
big enough gene pool. They say inbreeding could become a problem.</TE>
<TE>   The plan's backers say mammal populations in captivity have been
successfully increased in the past.</TE>
<TE>   They point to the reintroduction into the wild in the late 1980s
of Pere David's deer, another species found only in China. The deer
was hunted to extinction in the wild 1,000 years ago, but a few dozen
survived until modern times in the pleasure parks of China's
emperors, and later in European zoos.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a perfect solution, but it's the best option we have,"
Wang said. "And there's no time to lose."</TE>

<HD>Inventor Sets Sights on Quake-Proof Bed</HD>
<DH>Greece: Architect's contraption turns the sleeping area
into a heavy-framed cage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEREK GATOPOULOS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>PREVEZA, Greece</DL>
<LD>A Greek inventor believes that he's come up with the ultimate home
accessory for places under the constant threat of earthquakes: a bed
built to withstand them.</LD>
<LD>   Architect Giorgos Kondodimas' creation is a heavy-framed bed
that--by releasing a latch and pulling the headboard--turns into a
protective cage.</LD>
<LD>   "This can take anything ... it doesn't break," Kondodimas said as
a worker dropped a third, five-ton pile of slate onto the frame near
the western Greek city of Preveza, about 180 miles northwest of
Athens.</LD>
<TE>   Kondodimas seeks to first market his quake bed in Greece, which is
riddled with fearsome fault lines. If successful, he has his sights
set on other quake-prone nations such as Italy and Turkey.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, a magnitude 5.9 quake struck Athens, killing 143 people
and forcing thousands out of their damaged homes. A recent public
spat between Greek seismologists over their claimed ability to
predict earthquakes has added to the nation's jitters.</TE>
<TE>   Kondodimas, 49, has spent five years working on the bed. He said
it could help the elderly and people who live in homes built before
stricter construction codes were introduced.</TE>
<TE>   "People always talk about the new buildings and ways of making
them safer. But what about the old buildings? There doesn't seem to
be anything planned for them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The bed is equipped with survival essentials stored inside one of
the legs --cookies, bottled water, a whistle, a bag to hold urine and
a dynamo-powered flashlight.</TE>
<TE>   Kondodimas' eyes light up as he lies on the bed and squeezes the
flashlight lever. "This has everything you need to survive," he
boasts.</TE>
<TE>   When a quake hits, the person in bed releases a catch and pulls
the headboard, which joins with the metal footboard to form a
cage-like barrier. An opening at one side provides room to crawl out.</TE>
<TE>   He hopes to have a single bed on the Greek market by the end of
the year, selling for about $500. He is working on the queen-size
mattress version.</TE>
<TE>   A similar reinforced frame is used in Kondodimas' earthquake
couch, which is not yet on the market.</TE>

<HD>Morocco-Spain Dispute No Threat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CIARAN GILES</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>CEUTA, Spain</DL>
<LD>Residents of this multi-ethnic Spanish enclave on the Moroccan coast
of North Africa say they don't feel threatened by the confrontation
over a tiny, seemingly worthless island a few miles away in the
glistening Mediterranean Sea.</LD>
<LD>   "Most people here don't care who owns that rock," Delores Roman
Perez, a 21-year-old Ceuta housewife, said Friday of the island,
known in Spanish as Isla Perejil -- Parsley Island -- and in Arabic
as Leila, or night.</LD>
<LD>   "We all get along here -- Muslims, Jews and Indians -- and we want
it to stay that way."</LD>
<TE>   Morocco's brief occupation of the island was reversed Wednesday by
Spanish troops, who escorted them off peacefully. But the diplomatic
impasse remains -- and the fact that it happened at all raises
concerns that it was meant to be the first step in a bid to gain
control of Spanish territories along Morocco's northern coast.</TE>
<TE>   "Ceutis," as residents of Ceuta are known, play down such fears.</TE>
<TE>   "Morocco should spend its energy eradicating its own poverty
instead of trying to capture bits of rock that have little value,"
said Abselam Hamadi, leader of the local Islamic community.</TE>
<TE>   Residents said they feel protected by Spain and just want the
dispute over the rocky outcrop to be resolved quickly so they can
live in peace again with their Moroccan neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Mosques and Catholic churches dot the skyline of this
seven-square-mile isthmus. The hourly ringing of church bells mingles
with Muslim calls for prayer.</TE>
<TE>   More than half the approximately 80,000 residents are Roman
Catholic. Another 30,000 are Muslim and the rest are mainly Hindus
and Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Ceuta is just three miles from the island both countries claim.
The garrison town has been in Spanish hands for more than four
centuries.</TE>
<TE>   But Morocco, which became an independent nation in 1956, claims
Ceuta along with a second coastal enclave, Melilla, and other tiny
territories, including the island.</TE>
<TE>   The situation prompts comparison with Gibraltar, a British colony
across the strait on Spain's southern tip that was ceded to England
in the early 18th century. Spain and Britain are negotiating the
future status of Gibraltar.</TE>
<TE>   But Ceutis reject any such comparison.</TE>
<TE>   "Ceuta is not like Gibraltar," insisted Jose Perez Garrido, 74, a
former Spanish army commander in Ceuta. "This is Spanish and before
that it was Portuguese.... Gibraltar was once Spanish, but Ceuta was
never Moroccan."</TE>
<TE>   Spain's military power dwarfs that of Morocco's, but there seems
little likelihood the diplomatic impasse will degenerate into armed
conflict.</TE>
<TE>   The government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has proposed
withdrawing the several dozen Spanish troops on the island if Morocco
agrees not to attempt to reoccupy it.</TE>
<TE>   Morocco's response Friday was that Spain must remove its troops
before any negotiations start.</TE>
<TE>   "No negotiation, no discussion can take place between Spain and
Morocco before there is a complete withdrawal of Spanish troops,"
Foreign Minister Mohamed Benaissa said in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   Compared to the grinding poverty that is found on the Moroccan
mainland, Ceuta is wealthy, with hotels, classy restaurants and
fashion boutiques doing a bustling business.</TE>
<TE>   Conservative politicians say the city is a haven for hashish
traffickers, but police say the problem is no greater than in any
other Spanish city.</TE>
<TE>   Around 40% of its population are either military, police or
Spanish civil servants and earn more than their counterparts on the
Iberian peninsula because of bonuses given to encourage people to
stay in the enclave.</TE>
<TE>   While tens of thousands of Moroccans cross the border every day to
work or sell merchandise, Ceuta's Muslims fill the more menial jobs
mostly in tourism and construction.</TE>

<HD>Israel Cracks Down on Thefts of Antiquities</HD>
<DH>History: Almost as many people have been arrested in the
last seven months as in all of last year. But catching everyone is
impossible.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON KEYSER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>SHEKEF, Israel</DL>
<LD>Against a moonlit sky, six dark figures cast silhouettes as they
crept along a rocky hill and disappeared down a 2,000-year-old tunnel
in search of coins, oil lamps, jewelry, pottery and other precious
artifacts.</LD>
<LD>   Hiding in thick bramble and weeds, three agents from Israel's
Antiquities Authority watched the Palestinians through night-vision
goggles before tracking them down in a three-hour search through tiny
passageways, caves and cisterns deep below the Judean foothills.</LD>
<LD>   Archeologists say an increase in looting of ancient sites is a
consequence of the worsening economy and collapsed law and order in
Palestinian areas that has resulted from nearly two years of roiling
conflict.</LD>
<TE>   In the past, Israeli authorities have nabbed about 90 thieves each
year for pilfering tombs, ruined cities, palaces, forts and other
sites in Israel. This year, however, 80 arrests have been made in the
first seven months.</TE>
<TE>   About 30 suspects were Israeli citizens -- some Jewish and some
Arab Bedouins. The rest were Palestinians from the West Bank who told
investigators that they were driven by poverty and unemployment.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of the economic situation, they don't have anything to
lose," said Israeli Antiquities Authority agent Alon Klein, who is
responsible for a portion of central Israel rich in ancient sites and
just across the unmarked boundary with the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Many Palestinians have been unable to reach the jobs they once
held inside Israel because the military has sealed off their cities
and towns in hopes of keeping militants out of Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Armed with metal detectors and farming tools, some have taken to
the hills in search of artifacts that might bring them a few hundred
dollars from antiquities dealers.</TE>
<TE>   In the West Bank, near Hebron, ancient Persian and Hellenistic
settlements have been especially hard hit, emptied of precious
writings inscribed on pottery shards.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost every inch has been looted," said Hamdan Taha, director of
the Palestinian Antiquities Authority.</TE>
<TE>   The region's unrest has ended cooperation between Palestinian and
Israeli antiquities policing, Taha said, and looting in the West Bank
is up 20% this year, with 50 reported cases. So far, there have been
no arrests, Taha said.</TE>
<TE>   The Judean hills in central Israel, south of Jerusalem and just
across the West Bank boundary from Hebron, also are heavily
plundered. There are thousands of sites, dating from the Iron Age on
through the first millennium B.C. to the Roman and Byzantine eras.</TE>
<TE>   None of the officials could put a value on the damaged or
plundered antiquities, but they agreed that the losses are great --
and unrecoverable.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the richest area," Klein said. "On every hill you find
something."</TE>
<TE>   Bandits, some traveling by donkey from nearby Palestinian
villages, are also after cars, tractors and cows. But the prize for
many is the artifacts. Many sites, undiscovered by archeologists, are
well-known to Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "They know," Klein said. "Their fathers know. Their grandfathers
know. They feel it with the hands, the feet."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the plundered goods end up in shops in the West Bank and
Jerusalem's Old City, sold to tourists or other traders overseas.</TE>
<TE>   "Merchants have to produce proof of where they got the items,"
said Gideon Foerster, head of Hebrew University's Archaeology
Institute. "So, they say they bought it from another dealer or that
it came from Jordan. They always have prepared stories."</TE>
<TE>   Klein and a colleague patrolled the hills recently looking for
signs of digging. They scrutinized maps and talked to farmers and
shepherds, sifting for clues.</TE>
<TE>   Carrying a pistol, flashlight and walkie-talkie, Klein scanned the
hills through binoculars, moving along a dirt road running between
Israel and the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   On this spot two millenniums ago, the charismatic leader Bar
Kochba led a band of Jews in a failed three-year rebellion against
the Romans, who sent them into exile. Hiding from the Roman
legionnaires, families carved underground shelters linked by narrow
tunnels.</TE>
<TE>   It was in one of those tunnels that the six Palestinians were
caught in June, after the three-hour search by Klein and two other
agents, peering through "Rat" night-vision scopes.</TE>
<TE>   The thieves, from the nearby Palestinian village of Deir Samet,
had used rocks to seal themselves in a tiny niche in the ceiling of
the tunnel, which burrows about 30 feet below ground.</TE>
<TE>   "We moved the rocks and saw their shoes and pulled them down,"
Klein said.</TE>
<TE>   Before they were apprehended, the robbers used their axes to
collapse a ceiling, filling the tunnel entrance with dirt.</TE>
<TE>   The six men were sentenced to eight-month prison terms and were
fined $430 each.</TE>
<TE>   "I think most of the time we don't succeed to catch them," Klein
said. "But we are trying."</TE>

<HD>Ship's Recovery Spurs Another Gold Rush</HD>
<DH>History: A weighty book details the 1857 sinking of a
steamship filled with California gold, and its recovery off South
Carolina in 1987.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID TIRRELL-WYSOCKI</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>WOLFEBORO, N.H.</DL>
<LD>Caught in a vicious hurricane in 1857, the steamship Central America
went to the bottom of the Atlantic with more than 400 people and a
vast treasure of California gold.</LD>
<LD>   More than a century later, the depths surrendered the gold, more
than $100 million of it. It was the end of a long mystery involving
the worst peacetime disaster at sea in American history, but the
beginning of the story for historian and coin scholar Q. David
Bowers.</LD>
<LD>   He's written a weighty book containing an abundance of information
about the discovery of gold; how it transformed California and the
country; and how the Central America was lost, then found, rekindling
a second gold rush of sorts that continues today.</LD>
<TE>   "A California Gold Rush History" tells the stories of people--in
their own words--who headed west by wagon, ship and train in hopes of
making a fortune. A few succeeded; most failed. Some made fortunes
without digging even an ounce of gold.</TE>
<TE>   People tell of passing hundreds of graves next to dusty trails, of
sailing past shipwrecks at the rocky tip of South America, of swift
justice for lawbreakers, of crews abandoning ship in San Francisco
harbor to search for gold.</TE>
<TE>   "Among the deserters from my squadron are some of the best petty
officers and men having only a few months to serve," Thomas Catesbury
Jones, commander of the Navy's Pacific Squadron, wrote to the
secretary of the Navy in December 1848.</TE>
<TE>   One cargo ship captain awoke the morning after anchoring to
discover his entire crew gone.</TE>
<TE>   Bowers, president of the Bowers and Merena Gallery in Wolfeboro,
has been in the rare coin business for 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to a lifetime of personal research, he used material
gathered by researchers from period newspapers, ledgers, diaries and
other sources.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I've climbed Mt. Everest," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The 1,055-page work weighs 11 pounds. The average 49er, so named
for the mass migration of prospectors in 1849, found much less in
gold, Bowers said.</TE>
<TE>   Published by the California Gold Marketing Group, the book is an
adventure story, a political story, a meticulous account of a
tumultuous era, a window on human nature and an expert's record of
gold bars preserved on the Central America only by the disaster that
destroyed it. The book's $500,000 in research was financed through
sales of the treasure.</TE>
<TE>   Before being shipped east to be made into coins, most of the gold
dust and nuggets found in California were melted and molded into
brick-shaped ingots. "None were saved that anyone knows about,"
Bowers said.</TE>
<TE>   So the more than 500 ingots and 8,000 coins found in the Central
America in 1987 drew great interest among collectors and others
yearning for a piece of the Gold Rush.</TE>
<TE>   Legal battles with insurance companies tied up the treasure for
years, but most of it now has been sold. Included was the largest
known ingot from the California Gold Rush, a 10-inch-long brick that
sold for a reported $7 million in November.</TE>
<TE>   The "Eureka ingot," worth $17,000 in 1857, was part of a
breathtaking sight revealed by remote cameras that first scanned the
wreckage off South Carolina in the late 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   "The gold was stacked on the ocean floor like brownies and loaves
of bread," Bowers wrote. "Further along, they found piles of coins
spread amid the wreckage, heaped in towers, and spilling into what
looked like a frozen waterfall."</TE>
<TE>   The book easily could have dealt with a small slice of the Gold
Rush, such as the sinking of Central America or its rediscovery. But
Bowers said he tried to cover it all, because coins and ingots are
more than meets the eye.</TE>
<TE>   Take any ingot from the Central America. A miner found some gold
dust or nuggets, brought them to San Francisco, deposited them and
got a receipt. The gold was made into an ingot and, on Aug. 20, 1857,
loaded onto a steamer named the SS Sonara headed for Panama.</TE>
<TE>   There, the ingot traveled by rail 48 miles to the Atlantic, where
it was loaded aboard the Central America.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 12, 1857, a day after being damaged in a hurricane, the
ship sank about 160 miles off Charleston, S.C., in 8,000 feet of
water. More than 400 people died.</TE>
<TE>   "This ingot got tossed back and forth in the storm and finally
sank with the ship," Bowers said. "This little ingot has been there.
To me, that's endlessly fascinating."</TE>
<TE>   The gold sat on the ocean floor for 130 years.</TE>
<TE>   Bowers' company coordinated marketing the treasure and is one of
several firms that sold it to collectors, history buffs and museums.
An estimated 5% of the treasure remains for sale.</TE>
<TE>   Personally, he is thrilled just to have been alive for the
discovery of the Central America and the recovery of its gold.</TE>
<TE>   "Generations of scholars of the Gold Rush and coins were born and
died and never saw these coins," he said.</TE>

<HD>Commemorating a Journey That Opened the West</HD>
<DH>History: States along the Lewis and Clark route hope the
upcoming bicentennial will lure tourists and their dollars to trek
the trail.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIRANDA LEITSINGER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>SIOUX CITY, Iowa</DL>
<LD>On a bluff overlooking the Missouri River, a sandstone obelisk stands
as a tribute to the only member of the Lewis and Clark expedition to
die on the trek to the Pacific Ocean nearly 200 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Local history buff Bev Hinds said the monument marks the success
of the 1803-06 journey even as it serves as a memorial to Sgt.
Charles Floyd, who is believed to have died of appendicitis.</LD>
<LD>   "The fact that they survived all the accidents that happened to
them" was incredible, Hinds said. "You couldn't do it today."</LD>
<TE>   States along the route are hoping that the upcoming bicentennial
of the Corps of Discovery will lure tourists and their dollars to
trek the trail.</TE>
<TE>   Between 20 million and 30 million people are expected to retrace
at least part of the trail between 2003 and 2007, said Mark Monson,
chairman of the Iowa Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Commission.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the reason that people are going to travel the trail is
because it's about America," Monson said. "It's kind of like the
genealogy of the United States."</TE>
<TE>   On a recent summer afternoon, the Stauffer family of Roswell, Ga.,
stopped at Lewis and Clark State Park in Onawa, Iowa, about 30 miles
south of Sioux City, their first stop in a three-week trip along the
trail.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just always amazed by the big sky of the West," said Kirk
Stauffer, 44. "The discovery of the West, that sense of discovery, is
what inspires me."</TE>
<TE>   Bill "Buffalo Bill" Sanders, a park volunteer clad in an elk-skin
coat and buffalo cap, estimates that nearly half of the park's
visitors come because the explorers camped there in early August
1804.</TE>
<TE>   In nearby Sioux City, organizers are planning a pageant and play
to commemorate the trip. They'll also hold public lectures this fall
about the area's people, plants and animals 200 years ago. An
interpretive center, which will feature murals of the expedition and
hands-on exhibits, is set to open in September.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush unofficially opened the bicentennial celebration
this month, declaring that the expedition "will stand forever as a
monument to the American spirit, a spirit of optimism and courage and
persistence in the face of adversity."</TE>
<TE>   In 1803, President Thomas Jefferson sent Meriwether Lewis and
William Clark and a corps of 33 men to explore the newly acquired
Louisiana Purchase and the route to the Pacific Ocean.</TE>
<TE>   When Lewis and Clark journeyed up the then-curvy Missouri, they
labored against a strong downstream current and slogged through waves
of mosquitoes. They also battled dysentery, struggled to find food
and their way along parts of the route.</TE>
<TE>   The explorers also were aided by American Indians, such as
Sacagawea, a Shoshone woman who made the trip with her infant son and
helped the expedition secure horses at a critical time.</TE>
<TE>   "Lewis and Clark were successful because of the assistance they
received from Native American tribes," Monson said.</TE>
<TE>   That's why for some the bicentennial is seen as a commemoration,
rather than a celebration: "It did change their culture, I would
suspect for the worse," he said of the tribes. Many American Indians
say the expedition was a prelude to an invasion of the American West
that wiped out countless Indians and nearly destroyed their culture.</TE>
<TE>   Daphne Richards-Cook, an Ogalala Sioux, is organizing a circle of
tepees at Oacama, S.D., to represent nine tribes in the state.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to clear up the misconceptions and stereotypical views
they have about our Sioux tribes in South Dakota," said
Richards-Cook, chairwoman for a tribal tourism group.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis and Clark returned from their trip laden with journals
describing the people, plants, animals and landscape they
encountered.</TE>
<TE>   In one respect, they returned empty-handed: They discovered that
the Northwest Passage to the Pacific -- a long-dreamed of waterway
through the U.S. that would link Europe to Asia -- didn't exist.</TE>
<TE>   Experts said it took years before people understood what they
really had brought back.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the highway of the time that opened the West," Hinds said.</TE>

<HD>A Home for Espionage Relics</HD>
<DH>History: Museum houses spy technology and methods that have
helped the U.S. and its allies stay a step ahead of adversaries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAIME HERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>ANNAPOLIS JUNCTION, Md.</DL>
<LD>Raymond Moran spent half a century wondering how his outnumbered Army
unit in South Korea was able to hold off North Korean troops around
the southern coastal city of Pusan. He found his answer at the
National Cryptologic Museum.</LD>
<LD>   "I didn't know about all the great intelligence and what they used
to get it," said Moran, 73. "The intelligence people provided us
information to set up defenses at the right places. They saved us at
the Pusan perimeter."</LD>
<LD>   The Ft. Meade museum features equipment that has helped keep the
United States and its allies a step ahead of adversaries. More than
two dozen exhibits showcase how spy technology and spy methods were
used from the early 1800s through Vietnam.</LD>
<TE>   The museum is funded by the National Security Agency -- located a
few blocks away -- and is free to the public. Most of its volunteers
are former NSA employees.</TE>
<TE>   "People are routinely surprised at how nice the exhibits are, how
much we have out and how good the docents are," said Jack Ingram, the
curator. "Some people read every sign and look at every picture in
the place and soak it all up."</TE>
<TE>   The espionage relics include the American "Purple" code system for
cracking encrypted Japanese messages and the Navy Cryptanalytic Bombe
used by the Navy's WAVES service--an all-female group of code
breakers--to decipher German Enigma codes. Both systems were used
during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Several Enigma machines are encased in glass displays with plaques
explaining how they originated and evolved. The sophisticated
machines--which used thousands of permutations to try to fool Allied
cryptologists--allowed German U-boats to communicate with commanders
in Berlin during their battle to control Atlantic shipping channels.</TE>
<TE>   "The favorite exhibit, the most known ... that people come to see
is the Enigma," Ingram said.</TE>
<TE>   The machine, which looks like a typewriter with three metal wheels
on top, was featured in the 2000 movie "U-571," a fictional story
about American submariners who steal an Enigma from a German U-boat.</TE>
<TE>   Another exhibit shows how American code breaking allowed the Navy
to surprise the Japanese in June 1942 at the Battle of Midway. The
United States turned the tide of the war in the Pacific after sinking
four of Japan's main aircraft carriers.</TE>
<TE>   A Korean War section explains how cryptology allowed the Allies to
intercept North Korean radio transmissions between pilots and their
ground commanders, helping give Allied pilots a 7-to-1 kill ratio.</TE>
<TE>   The small force around Pusan held out long enough to allow United
Nations reinforcements to arrive and drive the North Koreans past the
border between the two countries at the 38th Parallel. Code breakers
helped defenders at the Pusan perimeter by learning where and when
the enemy was going to attack.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Kaufman, an 82-year-old retired Army captain, said he wishes
that he had known how much intelligence was being gathered by the
Allies.</TE>
<TE>   "The intelligence I got was from the front lines," said Kaufman,
who along with Moran paid a visit to the museum on the 52nd
anniversary of the start of the Korean War. "I'm surprised as hell to
see all this."</TE>
<TE>   A replica of a bugged Great Seal of the United States pulled from
the American Embassy in Moscow in 1960 hangs on a wall.</TE>
<TE>   Another wall displays a Hall of Honor, a list of great
intelligence workers that includes the "Father of American
Cryptology," William Friedman. He cracked the Purple code and is
credited with establishing the field of code breaking in the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   A room that borders the camouflage-painted Vietnam War section
holds giant computers used by the U.S. government for espionage
during the Cold War.</TE>
<TE>   The Vietnam area contains radios and other devices used for
snooping on the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army.</TE>
<TE>   Ingram said the museum has grown from the eight or nine small
exhibits since it opened in 1994. Because most of today's
intelligence-gathering equipment is classified, there is no
technology on display resembling what U.S. forces are using in the
war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   However, Ingram said, the role intelligence plays in winning wars
is clear.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people can see how important it's been in the past, and
they certainly can realize how dangerous the world is today," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "This type of work is still important, just as important as it
ever was. I think that's the underlying message people get out of
here."</TE>

<HD>Timber-War Enemies Find Unity</HD>
<DH>Northwest: Saying it's better to lose most of the forest
than all of it, conservationists ally with logging companies against
development.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA COOK</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NORTH BEND, Wash.</DL>
<LD>Sometimes you have to cut the trees to save the forest.</LD>
<LD>   Environmentalists who fought the timber wars of the 1980s and '90s
have a tough time embracing that notion. But as suburban development
spreads steadily over once-rural landscapes, some tree-cutters and
tree-huggers are finding common ground, or at least a common enemy:
suburbia.</LD>
<LD>   Some environmentalists are forging alliances with the timber
industry, taking the pragmatic view that responsible forestry beats
strip malls.</LD>
<TE>   The conservationists' biggest victory so far has been the promise
that 100,000 forested acres in the Washington Cascades
foothills--most within commuting distance of Seattle--will be
preserved as forest and never developed.</TE>
<TE>   A coalition of veterans from both sides of the timber wars
announced their plan in January. They want to sell tax-free bonds to
pay for the property, then sell timber from the land to pay off the
bonds. If Congress approves their unprecedented financing method,
land-conservation groups across the West and around the country are
poised to copy it.</TE>
<TE>   Big land deals like the Evergreen Forest Trust, as it's called,
grab headlines and are undeniably important. But a quieter battle is
being waged on small family forests.</TE>
<TE>   People like Lee and Louis Kahn are on the front lines. They own a
45-acre tree farm near North Bend, not far from the 100,000-acre
Evergreen Forest Trust site.</TE>
<TE>   Family Holds Out</TE>
<TE>   Like thousands of family foresters near urban areas and interstate
corridors, they could sell out to developers for a big payday instead
of relying on an uncertain, long-term crop. But they stick with it,
even as the value of their land surpasses the value of the timber on
it.</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't a financial thing," explains Lee Kahn, 69, as she
struggles to explain why she and her husband, Louis, 79, are
determined to keep working their tree farm. They live about 45
minutes from Seattle, and their property value is assessed at more
than $1 million. They make about $14,000 a year selling Christmas
trees. Douglas firs they planted 20 years ago won't be ready to
harvest for another 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good feeling inside both of us to look and see what we've
done," Louis Kahn said.</TE>
<TE>   On the ridge above them, million-dollar homes are for sale. At the
nearby Uplands Reserve, three- to seven-acre lots sell for $300,000
and up.</TE>
<TE>   "We're right in the center of what is turning into an area with
big lots and big houses," Lee Kahn said. "We are really trying to be
a working tree farm."</TE>
<TE>   They hope their children will do the same, but it's a touchy
subject.</TE>
<TE>   "They know I don't want it divided. It's not a secret," Louis Kahn
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not an easy topic to talk about," Lee Kahn added.</TE>
<TE>   Suburban growth, rising land values and declining timber prices
have already cost Washington a lot of forested land.</TE>
<TE>   According to the state Department of Natural Resources, every day
100 acres of forest in western Washington is converted to commercial,
residential or industrial uses. The department, which owns 2.1
million acres of forested land, has converted some of it to more
profitable uses--the Fred Meyer next to the Krispy Kreme in Issaquah
leases land from the department, for instance. The department's goal
is to preserve forest land wherever possible, spokesman Todd Myers
said.</TE>
<TE>   Timberland that used to be owned by big companies has been broken
up and sold, repeatedly. In the western foothills of the Cascades,
the land eventually gets too expensive for timber companies, and
developers snap it up.</TE>
<TE>   "When you can sell one acre in Washington state and buy 10 acres
in Maine, some of the companies are doing that," said Doug
McClelland, asset stewardship manager with the Department of Natural
Resources. "It's not wrong; it's just the economics of forestry."</TE>
<TE>   In the past, McClelland said, leaders thought zoning was the
answer. But zoning can change with a simple county council vote. The
real answer, he said, is changing the economic equation. State,
county and federal programs buy private land for forestry and
compensate family foresters for their unused development rights.</TE>
<TE>   Good intentions aren't enough--conservation today takes cash.
That's where the Evergreen Forest Trust comes in, with its plan to
buy the $185-million property from timber giant Weyerhaeuser and pay
it off by logging 80% of the land. The remaining 20% will be
preserved permanently as forest land.</TE>
<TE>   Many environmentalists were skeptical at first. The board of the
Cascade Land Conservancy debated vigorously before joining the
project. The group now holds the conservation easement on the
property and will monitor the logging.</TE>
<TE>   "We can have all kinds of discussions about what's the best
forestry, as long as you have a forest. Once it's a shopping center
or a parking lot, you don't have much to talk about anymore," said
Charlie Raines, a longtime leader with the local Sierra Club and
director of the Cascade Land Conservancy's Foothills Forest
Conservation Program.</TE>
<TE>   Although most environmental groups support the Evergreen Forest
Trust, or at least are willing to give it a chance, not everyone
approves.</TE>
<TE>   Raines has been criticized--and in one case, hit in the face with
a pie--for his willingness to deal with timber companies.</TE>
<TE>   King County Councilman Larry Phillips, an Evergreen Forest Trust
board member, said he has no doubt that if the 100,000-acre forest
isn't protected, it will be developed.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be sold for subdivisions and shopping malls. That's going
to happen," Phillips said. "You're harvesting the forest to save it."</TE>

<HD>Remembering the Black Dust, and Black Days</HD>
<DH>Labor: A W.Va. black miner lived and toiled next to white
miners. It seemed an unlikely place for bias, but Bob Armstead found
it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICKI SMITH</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>MORGANTOWN, W.Va.</DL>
<LD>MORGANTOWN, W. Va.--Bob Armstead was a gentle man in a rough
profession.</LD>
<LD>   A black miner in decidedly white West Virginia, he toiled in a
place where coal companies had recruited tens of thousands of blacks
for jobs everyone else thought were too dangerous.</LD>
<LD>   For 40 years, Armstead worked hard, staying underground as racism
pushed others out.</LD>
<TE>   "Some said the black coal dust was a race equalizer," he wrote.
"They said we were all black because of the coal dust, so blacks and
whites blended, and there was less prejudice in a coal mine. I really
didn't see it that way."</TE>
<TE>   Armstead's story, "Black Days, Black Dust," released earlier this
year by the University of Tennessee Press, has become the first
published memoir of a black American coal miner.</TE>
<TE>   It's a story of a quiet, hard-working, cheerful man. It's also a
255-page primer on coal mining and a window into a nearly forgotten
piece of history -- those few decades when tens of thousands of
blacks moved into the mountains to help make West Virginia's mines
among the most productive in the world.</TE>
<TE>   In 1880, only 25,886 blacks lived in West Virginia, a state with
592,537 whites.</TE>
<TE>   But as miners unionized and went on strike, mine owners recruited
blacks by the trainload from the Deep South.</TE>
<TE>   By 1920, the state's black population had grown to 86,345. Whites
made up nearly 1.4 million. In southern coalfield counties, blacks
accounted for more than 68% of the population in the 1930 census.</TE>
<TE>   Four generations of Armstead's family were part of the great coal
mine migration, moving from the iron district of Bessemer, Ala., to
north-central West Virginia in 1924.</TE>
<TE>   Later, when other families moved on, the Armsteads stayed.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Armstead died in 1998 at the age of 71, but his voice survives
on the pages of his book.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "When our shift ended, white miners and black miners took their
showers in separate facilities and went their separate ways. I
wondered if the company prolonged segregation by having white and
colored showers, or if the white men demanded it. Underground we were
equal, dependent on each other and friendly. Once we hit the showers,
a mental separation took place. We were black men and white men, no
longer equal."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   By 1947, when Armstead followed his father into Marion County's
mines, the number of black workers had already dwindled.</TE>
<TE>   Machines had begun to replace men and, among those left, white men
were preferred.</TE>
<TE>   "There were people who actually recruited blacks. On this side of
the mountain, some owner would have recruited. On the other, they
wouldn't. It's a polka-dotted pattern," said Ron Lewis, a history
professor at West Virginia University. "But in the end, as a system,
it worked as racial preference."</TE>
<TE>   Blacks were nudged out, and those who remained were generally
low-level laborers in the most dangerous areas of the mine. Often,
both their union and their seniority failed to protect them.</TE>
<TE>   "All men who weren't white native West Virginians faced losing
their jobs," Armstead wrote.</TE>
<TE>   When he was laid off, Armstead cooked and waited tables. He
carried bags as a bellhop. He washed floors. He delivered newspapers.
Along the way, he married twice and reared five children.</TE>
<TE>   He moved from town to town and job to job, but he always returned
to the mines.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of other black families left, abandoning assimilation in
the hills for factory jobs in Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Chicago and
Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   "They just moved on," Lewis said, "and so they're lost."</TE>
<TE>   So, too, are their stories.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "When those white fellows were out with their families or friends,
they didn't know me.... I had to change my thinking that they were my
'mine buddies' and reduce them to my 'former co-workers.' That truth
bothered me for a long time, but I got over it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Writer Sharon Gardner believes that Armstead's experiences are
worth telling.</TE>
<TE>   Gardner met Armstead in 1997 and drew his story out in bits,
interviewing him three hours at a time every few weeks for 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   Gardner, a former teacher and librarian living in Fairmont, W.Va.,
had been fascinated with coal since moving from her native Bedford,
Pa., in 1996 and seeing "trains, as far as you could see."</TE>
<TE>   Armstead read one of Gardner's stories about the Dakota coal camp
and called to talk. He proposed a feature on his family, but after an
hour, Gardner had bigger plans.</TE>
<TE>   Armstead retired in 1987 and succumbed to lung cancer on Dec. 9,
1998.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Hate is not in my vocabulary. I can honestly say that I've never
hated anyone. I sometimes felt resentment for things said or done to
me, but I never let anyone see my resentment, and I rarely spoke of
it.... I knew from a young age that life was too precious to carry
around the burden of hatred and bitterness, so I chose not to do it."</TE>

<HD>President's Niece Out of Jail and Back in Drug Treatment</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>MIKE SCHNEIDER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Noelle Bush, Gov. Jeb Bush's 24-year-old daughter, was released from
jail and allowed to return to a drug rehab center Friday, two days
after being locked up for allegedly taking prescription pills from a
nurse's cabinet.</LD>
<LD>   "I would not allow you to go back to the facility if I didn't
think you could do the program," Circuit Judge Reginald Whitehead
said in giving the president's niece a second chance in rehab.</LD>
<LD>   "You're very intelligent, you have the support there. You just
need to work on the decisions that you're making, and I know that you
can do it."</LD>
<TE>   Bush, accompanied by her brother, George P. Bush, and her
attorney, said nothing in her defense during the two-minute hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "She's definitely remorseful with what happened," George P. Bush
said afterward. "She recognizes her errors, that she's not perfect
and that she made a mistake."</TE>
<TE>   Bush was jailed Wednesday for contempt of court for violating the
terms of her court-ordered drug treatment program. She was accused of
taking prescription pills from a cabinet in a nurse's office at the
rehab center where she was being treated.</TE>
<TE>   Whitehead sent Bush to jail for three days. Jail spokesman Allen
Moore said any part of a day was counted as an entire day.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's lawyer, Pete Antonacci, said his client tested negative for
having taken the pills. He said he did not know what kind of pills
they were.</TE>
<TE>   Bush was arrested in January at a pharmacy drive-through window
after allegedly trying to buy the anti-anxiety drug Xanax with a
fraudulent prescription. She was admitted to the treatment center a
month later, with the possibility charges would be dropped if she
completed the program.</TE>
<TE>   The governor was allowed to visit his daughter in jail for several
minutes Wednesday, even though visits are usually limited to
weekends.</TE>
<TE>   "She realized there are consequences to her actions and that she
has to pay a price," he said. "I respect the judge's decision."</TE>

<HD>Teen Suicide Foundation Expands</HD>
<DH>Prevention: Partnership with Nashville hospital chain pumps
more than $1.2 million into program begun after 16-year-old's death.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>Five years after 16-year-old Jason Flatt killed himself with his
father's pistol, a suicide prevention foundation founded by his dad
is expanding its national presence.</LD>
<LD>   The Jason Foundation, started in his hometown of Hendersonville,
has formed a partnership with Ardent Health Services, a
Nashville-based hospital chain.</LD>
<LD>   Ardent will establish suicide prevention centers for teens at
hospitals in Chicago, Los Angeles, Seattle and Sacramento, company
CEO David T. Vandewater said this week.</LD>
<TE>   The centers will feature hot lines and school-based programs
affiliated with the Jason Foundation, the organization that Jason's
father, Clark Flatt, runs from a couple of suites in a small
Hendersonville office building.</TE>
<TE>   Flatt estimated the value of services that Ardent will provide the
foundation at more than $1.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Vandewater said Ardent, a for-profit health care firm, hopes
gradually to expand its Jason Foundation alliance to "all 22 of our
behavioral hospitals in the company," which also has hospitals in
Oregon, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Arkansas, Missouri, Indiana, Ohio,
Louisiana and Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   The Jason Foundation, which uses teens to counsel other teens, has
spread to schools in 47 states, including more than 160 Tennessee
high schools, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Despondent over a school relationship, Jason Flatt shot himself to
death five years ago this week, his father said.</TE>
<TE>   The high school fullback was one of 47 Tennesseans ages 13 to 19
who killed themselves that year, state records show.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, more than 3 million American youths seriously
considered suicide and more than 1 million attempted it in 2000, the
U.S. Health Department reported recently.</TE>
<TE>   In Clark Flatt's view, though, the official numbers are low.</TE>
<TE>   Many youth deaths reported as accidents, such as drug overdoses
and single-car accidents with no apparent mechanical failure, are
likely intentional acts, Flatt said.</TE>
<TE>   After his son's death, the insurance business owner started
leaving more and more work to employees while he enlisted teens,
teachers and parents to focus attention on the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Within two years, he was devoting all his time to the foundation,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation's medical advisory board includes former U.S.
Surgeon General David Satcher. University of Tennessee football coach
Phillip Fulmer serves as national spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Fulmer joined the effort in 1998 after the organization's first
"teen board" suggested the foundation try to enlist him.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation was barely six months old and just trying to move
from parent seminars into the schools, said Flatt, who doubted the
cause could get Fulmer involved. But the board sent Fulmer a letter
asking for help and he called Flatt a week later.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'If you're looking for just a name, I'm not interested.'
He wanted to be involved."</TE>

<HD>Firefighting Air Tankers Grounded For Safety Concerns</HD>
<DH>Wildfires: Planes are ordered to be inspected after the
second deadly crash within a month.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON SARCHE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>The nation's firefighting fleet of heavy air tankers was grounded
Friday during one of the worst wildfire seasons on record after the
second deadly crash since June in which a plane broke apart while
battling a blaze in the West.</LD>
<LD>   Thirty-two of the planes were ordered to remain on the ground for
24 hours by the National Interagency Fire Center.</LD>
<LD>   "The purpose is to allow contractors to inspect planes and give
crews some rest," said Jack deGolia, spokesman for the fire center.</LD>
<TE>   In addition, four tankers of the same model as the one destroyed
in the latest accident will not fly until federal investigators
figure out what went wrong.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, wildfires across the West are being fought with
smaller, single-engine tankers, helicopters, smokejumpers who
parachute into burning areas, and ground crews equipped with
bulldozers.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, a World War II-era PB4Y-2 Privateer crashed while
battling a wildfire 45 miles northwest of Denver. Witnesses said it
broke apart in the air. The two crew members were killed. The
National Transportation Safety Board and U.S. Forest Service are
investigating.</TE>
<TE>   On June 17, a C-130A air tanker crashed after its wings snapped
off near Walker, Calif. The five remaining C-130A firefighting
aircraft were grounded at the time and have yet to return to the air.
The accident is still under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be irresponsible on a structural failure that severe to
fly them until we knew why that happened," deGolia said of the
C-130A's. "Was it that particular aircraft, was it a mechanical
fluke, or something common to that type of airplane?"</TE>
<TE>   Both tankers that crashed were owned by Hawkins &amp; Powers Aviation
Inc. of Greybull, Wyo. The tankers were under contract to the U.S.
Forest Service.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's crash brought to 11 the number of people killed
fighting wildfires nationwide this year. Five died in a traffic wreck
in Colorado en route to a fire, and one was crushed by a fire-damaged
tree in Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   The grounded planes are 42 years old, on average. Industry experts
said they believe the aging fleet could continue flying safely.</TE>
<TE>   "Older airplanes do not mean unsafe airplanes," said William
Broadwell, executive director of the Aerial Firefighting Industry
Assn. "The military flies airplanes that are exactly as old. As long
as it's maintained properly, it's a safe aircraft."</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Powers, operations assistant for Hawkins &amp; Powers, said the
company's planes are inspected by both the Federal Aviation
Administration and the U.S. Forest Service.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't simply say it's an old airplane. A lot of newer
aircraft have a lot more time on them," he said. He said Hawkins &amp;
Powers is working with the FAA and the NTSB.</TE>
<TE>   The Privateer had made several drops of fire retardant and was
carrying another load when it went down. The crew members were using
routine tactics, said Larry Helmerick, a Rocky Mountain Fire
Information Office spokesman. "It was a normal day for aerial
resources," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The tankers' absence was felt Friday at the 1,000-acre wildfire
where the Privateer crashed. "The fire is in rough terrain. It is
hard to get crews in. Air power is about the only thing you can do,"
incident commander Joe Hartman said.</TE>
<TE>   Tanker pilot Gene Wahlstrom, a 22-year firefighting veteran, said
from Grand Junction that he is confident his occupation is as safe as
possible.</TE>
<TE>   "The planes are taken in each winter and gone through
extensively," he said. "I wouldn't be doing this if they weren't."</TE>
<TE>   So far this year, 3.5 million acres have burned in U.S. wildfires.</TE>

<HD>White House Moves to Tighten Loose Lips, Stop Leaks to
Media</HD>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration, until now considered one of the most
effective ever at controlling information, is suddenly struggling to
plug leaks that threaten political embarrassment and, officials say,
harm to national security.</LD>
<LD>   FBI investigators recently were interrogating the staff of a
congressional panel probing intelligence failures of Sept. 11, and
they may take the unprecedented step of using polygraph exams.</LD>
<LD>   After a public display of anger by Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld, Pentagon officials have begun an inquiry into who gave
newspapers draft war plans for a possible attack on Iraq.</LD>
<TE>   And the State Department took the highly unusual step recently of
detaining a reporter at its Foggy Bottom headquarters in an effort to
find out who leaked a classified diplomatic cable that contained
embarrassing information about the department's visa program.</TE>
<TE>   Top administration officials have said from the beginning of
President Bush's term that they are serious about enforcing the laws
that make it a crime to leak classified documents. But not until now
has it become fully apparent how vigorous they are willing to be.</TE>
<TE>   The cases also demonstrate the limits on how tightly any
administration can control information. Though Bush's team is known
for keeping the lid on--even Cabinet members were unaware of Bush's
plan to create a Department of Homeland Security--the president's
team has not been able to control everyone in the executive branch or
in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   And questions are beginning to arise about the wisdom of even
trying to root out the sources of leaks.</TE>
<TE>   William Kristol, who was chief of staff to former Vice President
Dan Quayle, said the government should only mobilize against leaks
that genuinely threaten lives and national security.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not much evidence that any of the leaks here are of that
character," said Kristol, now editor of the Weekly Standard magazine.</TE>
<TE>   The Capitol Hill investigation was launched last month after news
organizations, citing congressional sources, disclosed contents of a
classified briefing by the ultra-secret National Security Agency.</TE>
<TE>   In closed-door testimony, NSA officials reportedly acknowledged
that the agency had intercepted Al Qaeda messages Sept. 10 saying
"tomorrow is zero day" and "the match begins tomorrow," but had not
translated the messages from Arabic until Sept. 12. Within hours of
the officials' testimony, those messages were being reported on
television and on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Angered by the disclosure, Vice President Dick Cheney called the
chairmen of the House and Senate intelligence committees, demanding a
crackdown. The lawmakers, Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.) and Rep. Porter J.
Goss (R-Fla.), responded by sending a letter to Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft inviting an inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   Among the questions staff members faced was whether they would be
willing to submit to polygraph tests, according to one aide.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon inquiry began after The Times and, later, the New
York Times, published the broad outlines of a proposal for attacking
Iraq. The plan called for using land-, air- and sea-based forces to
hit Iraq from three directions.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld said in a TV interview last week that the document
appeared to be from a lower-level planner. A defense official told
Associated Press on Friday that investigators were having difficulty
figuring out which document the reports were based on.</TE>
<TE>   State Department security officials detained reporter Joel Mowbray
of the National Review magazine July 12 after Mowbray said during a
daily briefing at the department's headquarters that he had a
classified cable from the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, about
embarrassing problems with the granting of visas there.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics, including some conservative members of Congress,
have complained that an accelerated visa program has opened U.S.
borders to Saudis who may pose security threats.</TE>
<TE>   Mowbray was detained for about 15 minutes, he said in an
interview, while Diplomatic Security Service officials sought to find
out whether he had the cable with him. State Department officials
said he was stopped because his comments to chief spokesman Richard
Boucher indicated he had a copy with him. In those circumstances,
they said, security officials could not simply allow him to leave the
building without trying to recover it.</TE>
<TE>   As congressional critics have argued, the administration sometimes
has used classified information to make its case in public.</TE>
<TE>   In May, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer, during a news
briefing, outlined a covert CIA plan the administration was close to
approving in the summer of 2001 that was designed to help guerrilla
fighters oust Afghanistan's ruling Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   The disclosure was widely seen as an effort by the White House to
deflect criticism that it was not pursuing Al Qaeda aggressively
enough, even though Bush was warned during a CIA briefing that the
terrorist organization might seek to hijack commercial aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Many administrations have tried to halt leaks, including President
Nixon's "plumbers" unit from the Watergate era.</TE>
<TE>   But many legal experts say leak investigations tend to be
frustrating--often fruitless--undertakings, in part because secret
information is distributed so widely and so quickly among officials.</TE>
<TE>   For example, former FBI Director Louis J. Freeh told Congress
that, because of this problem, the FBI was unable to pinpoint who had
leaked the information that former security guard Richard Jewell was
under suspicion in the 1996 bombing during the Summer Olympics in
Atlanta. It turned out that Jewell was falsely accused.</TE>
<TE>   "It's often the case that people 'know' who did it, or think they
know, but don't have the proof," said Jeffrey Smith, a former general
counsel at the CIA.</TE>
<TE>   In one telling sign of just how prickly a subject leaks can be, an
internal report on the issue by the Justice Department has been
bottled up for months, amid infighting within the administration.</TE>
<TE>   The report, commissioned last year by Congress, is supposed to
weigh in on what government can do to curb leaks and whether
additional legislation is necessary.</TE>
<TE>   A draft of the report was completed months ago, recommending
against new legislation. But it has been held up, largely by
opposition from CIA Director George J. Tenet, according to sources
familiar with the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet is said to be dissatisfied that the report doesn't advocate
more aggressive enforcement of leak laws by Justice.</TE>

<HD>Preventable Hospital Infections Prove Deadly</HD>
<DH>Medicine: Investigation finds poor sanitation and unwashed
hands cause thousands to die needlessly. Budget cuts hurt prevention
staffs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL J. BERENS</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Deadly infections fueled by poor sanitation, contaminated instruments
and unwashed hands in the nation's hospitals are needlessly claiming
tens of thousands of lives annually, according to an investigation by
the Chicago Tribune.</LD>
<LD>   While the hospital industry often characterizes deaths by
infection as random and unavoidable, the Tribune, in the first
comprehensive analysis of patients deaths linked to infection in
5,810 hospitals across the nation, found otherwise. Not only are many
deaths by infection easily preventable, the newspaper said, but
soaring infection rates also have been exacerbated by hospital budget
cutbacks in infection control staffs and housekeeping services.</LD>
<LD>   The problem has grown so severe that deaths linked to hospital
germs now represent the fourth-leading cause of mortality among
Americans, behind heart disease, cancer and strokes, according to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Infections connected to
hospital-based germs kill more people annually than auto accidents,
fires and drowning combined.</LD>
<TE>   "The number of people needlessly killed by hospital infections is
unbelievable, but the public doesn't know anything about it," said
Dr. Barry Farr, a leading infection-control expert and president of
the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America.</TE>
<TE>   "For years, we've just been quietly bundling the bodies of
patients off to the morgue while infection rates get higher and
higher."</TE>
<TE>   Infections that would be no problem for healthy people can become
fatal for hospital patients who are too old or too weak to fend them
off.</TE>
<TE>   The Tribune's analysis, which adopted methods commonly used by
epidemiologists, found an estimated 103,000 deaths linked to hospital
infections in 2000. The CDC, which bases its numbers on
extrapolations from 250 hospitals, estimated there were 90,000 that
year.</TE>
<TE>   Though the CDC does not attempt to classify any infections as
preventable, the Tribune examined federal health inspection reports
and other public documents in all 50 states to make its analysis. The
paper found that in 2000--the latest year health care records were
available nationally--75,000 of the deadly hospital infections took
place in conditions that were preventable.</TE>
<TE>   The Tribune investigation uncovered disturbing and largely
unreported cases of fatal infections that might have been avoided had
hospitals held themselves and their staffs to adequate sanitation
standards.</TE>
<TE>   In a Detroit hospital, as doctors and nurses moved about the
pediatric intensive care unit without washing their hands, a germ
killed four babies in the same row of bassinets in the spring of
1997, according to interviews and court records. It took two full
months for administrators to close the nursery for cleaning.</TE>
<TE>   Staphylococcus germs, common on the skin and in nasal passages,
invaded more than 100 cardiac patients at a West Palm Beach, Fla.,
hospital over the past four years, killing 13 of them. The survivors
underwent agonizing surgeries and long rehabilitation periods as
rotting bone was cut from their bodies.</TE>
<TE>   Eight Chicago children died in 1998 as germs from a South Side
pediatric medicine center spread into a hospital. Fever-ridden health
care workers who tended to patients spread the germ, as did other
workers who failed to wash their hands. The outbreak was stopped
months later after 36 workers, some with fevers and sickness, were
ordered to stay home.</TE>
<TE>   The rare bacteria found in Chicago has since been linked to the
deaths of dozens of children in medical facilities in three states.</TE>
<TE>   Hospitals are not legally required to disclose infection rates,
and most don't. Doctors are not required to tell patients about risk
or exposure to hospital germs. There is little government oversight
in the area of infection in hospitals, which combines with the
industry's long-apparent penchant for secrecy to hide the problem.</TE>
<TE>   The problems stretch far beyond isolated cases in specific
hospitals. The Tribune's investigation found systemic problems
pointing to abysmal infection-control efforts across the nation:</TE>
<TE>   * Life-threatening violations of infection-control standards are
common in hospitals. Since 1995, the investigation showed, 75% of all
U.S. hospitals have been cited for serious cleanliness and sanitation
violations.</TE>
<TE>   * In thousands of cases, surgeons performed operations without
washing their hands or wearing surgical masks. In one case, records
show, surgeries were performed in a Connecticut operating room even
while dust floated in the air and flies buzzed overhead during open
heart surgery.</TE>
<TE>   * Hospital cleaning staffs are overwhelmed and inadequately
trained, which leads to unsanitary rooms or wards where germs can
grow and multiply, sometimes for years. Since 1995, hospital cleaning
staffs have been cut by 25%. In that same period, almost half of all
hospitals have been cited for failure to properly sanitize their
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   * Rampant payroll cutbacks have gutted staffs devoted to reducing
infections. These staffs have been cut by an average of 20%
nationally in the past three years. A majority of hospitals ignores
the CDC's recommendation that hospitals have one infection-control
person for every 250 beds.</TE>
<TE>   Budget cutbacks are cited as one reason infections are on the rise
in the nation's hospitals. Nurses report their hospitals are so
understaffed that they don't always have time to wash their hands
between patient visits.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is not likely to go away. The American Hospital Assn.
predicts further cutbacks in staff and patient care, leading to more
problems with infection control.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,700 American hospitals, about a third of the total, are
operating at a loss. An equal number are on the edge of bankruptcy,
the AHA reports.</TE>
<TE>   At Bridgeport Hospital in Bridgeport, Conn., germs flourished in
areas that are supposed to be the most sterile places in the
hospital, according to a review of thousands of pages of hospital
records collected in a lawsuit and opened for public inspection by
the Connecticut Supreme Court last year.</TE>
<TE>   The court case involved four patients who contracted infections
inside the hospitals. Operating Room No. 2, where one in five
patients at times contracted infections, epitomized the hospital's
problem. The air was often contaminated by dust because of faulty
ventilation. Flies buzzed overhead during operations. Doctors wore
germ-laden clothes from home into the operating room. Many did not
wash their hands before operating.</TE>
<TE>   "Bridgeport had a long history of high infection rates but
corrective action was not taken until it was too late," said Peggy
Haering, an attorney who represented a patient in a suit settled out
of court. "What became clear is that these infections were
preventable."</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody here intentionally spread germs, but we've learned that
even the smallest breakdown in infection control can have devastating
consequences," said hospital spokesman John Capiello. The hospital
has undergone a $30-million remodeling. Infection rates have dropped
to nearly zero.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital-monitoring system is a checkerboard of local, state
and federal regulators who do little to encourage better infection
control. All hospitals must have general standards to quality for the
federal Medicaid program, but each facility is allowed to draft its
own rules.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you imagine the medical community outcry if even a single
doctor died from germs because of a failure to wash hands?" said Mark
Bruley, a forensic investigator who studies hospital conditions for
ECRI, a nonprofit laboratory near Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   "Health care workers aren't the ones getting hurt. Because they
don't always see the outcome, they are blind to the problems."</TE>

<LD>Thomas obituary--A correction in Thursday's Times regarding the April
7 obituary on Venice beat poet John Thomas misstated the charge that
led to his 120-day jail term. It said he pleaded no contest to a
charge of sexually molesting his daughter when she was 14. In fact,
the charge that led to his jailing was one count of sexual contact
with a 15-year-old.</LD>

<HD>Navy Sets Its Sights on Tiny Bird's Island Home</HD>
<DH>Military: The service has worked to save San Clemente's
shrike but says it needs to expand its exercise range.</DH>

<DL>SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND</DL>
<LD>On this sun-scorched, barren patch of land 78 miles from San Diego,
the Navy has been engaged on two fronts for more than a decade:
training for armed conflicts abroad and trying to save an endangered
bird at home.</LD>
<LD>   Many of the West Coast-based Marines, sailors, pilots and Navy
SEALs who were key to the quick knockdown of the Taliban government
in Afghanistan trained on this island.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, the Navy has been funding and overseeing a
$2-million-per-year program of captive breeding and habitat
protection for the tiny loggerhead shrike. Thanks to the combined
efforts of the Navy and the San Diego Zoo, the little bird, once on
the brink of extinction, has been experiencing a population
explosion.</LD>
<TE>   But now the two missions are coming into conflict as the Navy says
it is feeling pressure to expand bombing and training into areas
favored by the birds.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy says it must respond to increased demands from all
branches of the military since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The birds, however, are protected by the Endangered Species Act.</TE>
<TE>   Training on the island has increased 25% since the terrorist
attacks on America. The Department of Defense broke ground last week
on a $21-million simulated U.S. embassy compound to train troops in
rescuing Americans trapped in war zones.</TE>
<TE>   And with the planned closing in 2003 of the controversy-plagued
bombing range on the island of Vieques, in the Caribbean, San
Clemente Island will become the Navy's last ship-to-shore live-fire
range.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything you need to go into combat can be practiced on this
range," said Tom Soden, a former Marine who serves as range manager
at the island's China Point site. "This is one-stop shopping for
Naval warfare."</TE>
<TE>   The "shopping" is not unrestricted. During the shrike's breeding
season--from February to August--the Navy can use the China Point
bombardment range only three days a week. Restrictions are also
imposed because of the danger of wildfires. Although the Navy has
been able to overcome these restrictions in the past, officials say
the increased demand for training is shrinking its "work-around"
flexibility.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel we're running a marathon but there is no finish line,"
said Capt. David R. Landon, commanding officer of the Coronado Naval
Base, which has jurisdiction over San Clemente Island.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service is assessing the Navy's shrike
program and preparing a recovery plan for the bird that could give
the military more room to maneuver. The plan could be ready for
public comment by September.</TE>
<TE>   It could be the first step toward changing the shrike's status
from endangered to merely threatened. That would allow the Navy
greater freedom to use the island, even if it meant that some shrikes
may be killed.</TE>
<TE>   "The Navy's shrike program is going along well," said Jane
,Hendron, spokeswoman for the Carlsbad office of the wildlife
service, although she added that it is too early to determine what
the recovery plan will recommend.</TE>
<TE>   Hendron noted that, even without a recommendation to alter the
shrike's protected status, the Navy could request an exemption from
some of the restrictions imposed by the Endangered Species Act. But
Navy officials are reluctant to seek an exemption because it would
require periodic renewal and hinder long-term planning.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy would like to see the shrike removed from endangered
species protection altogether by 2005 and is optimistic that the
growing bird population will justify that.</TE>
<TE>   Once flourishing on the island, the small black-and-gray songbirds
were devastated by the presence of thousands of goats that foraged on
the island's vegetation--a holdover from the days when the island was
a goat, sheep and cattle ranch.</TE>
<TE>   After the goats were shot and trapped--amid much protest from
animal-rights activists--aerial bombardment by the military continued
to thin the shrike population.</TE>
<TE>   Although the island is 21 miles long by 1.5 miles to 4 miles wide,
one of the shrike's favorite nesting grounds is in the gullies near
the China Point range. Although there are other species of the bird,
this subspecies ofshrike lives only on San Clemente Island.</TE>
<TE>   As recently as 1998, only 13 loggerhead shrikes remained. Today,
with captive-breeding and bombardment restrictions, the island boasts
123 shrikes in the wild and 64 in breeding pens.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental groups are impressed by the shrike's progress, but
not enough to support the Navy's bid to "downlist" it, even if the
current population trend continues.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a matter of numbers," said Kieran Suckling, a bird
specialist with the Tucson-based Center for Biological Diversity. He
said the shrike's continued recovery would depend on habitat
protection by the Navy and on the military's willingness to fend off
predators.</TE>
<TE>   "Shrikes are pretty dependent on human interaction," Suckling
said. "Regardless of numbers, you can't say a population is safe if
they're that dependent."</TE>
<TE>   Suckling added, "The Navy has done a good job. It would be a shame
to send the shrike victory toward a controversial breakdown."</TE>
<TE>   Wholly owned by the Navy since 1934, San Clemente Island is home
to several species of endangered and threatened animals and plants.
The loggerhead shrike was added to the list in 1977 and the
population plan adopted in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating the environmental dilemma on the island, one of the
eight Channel Islands, is the presence of the Channel Island fox, a
cat-sized creature that likes to eat shrike eggs.</TE>
<TE>   To protect the shrike, the Navy has tried to keep the foxes away,
by trapping and fencing. To date, no one is sure whether these
measures have reduced the number of foxes.</TE>
<TE>   The fox populations on four of the Channel Islands have been
proposed for additional federal protection.</TE>
<TE>   San Clemente Island is not among those four islands, but Navy
officials fear that the protections imposed on San Miguel, Santa
Catalina, Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa might later be extended to San
Clemente.</TE>
<TE>   The shrikes like specific sites on the island, but the foxes,
fearless and fleet, like to roam, prowling shoreline areas where
Marines and SEALs train.</TE>
<TE>   Suckling said he believes that the Navy is crying wolf over the
fox and that the San Clemente Island population will never be subject
to federal protection.</TE>
<TE>   Navy officials worry about a day when areas frequented by the
foxes are put off-limits to training because, by protecting the
shrike, the Navy has hurt the fox. "We could become a victim of our
own success," said Landon. "It's a Catch-22."</TE>

<LD>A little bit of hope died with Benny Hernandez. Educator, politician,
activist, speaker--it's hard to decide which label captured the man
who died July 11 at age 45.</LD>
<LD>   More than anything else, Hernandez defied expectations. His last
18 months flew in the face of doctors' predictions that he would
survive no longer than 12 weeks after being diagnosed with a
fast-growing brain tumor.</LD>
<LD>   Hernandez's optimism was evident in an unlikely run for the
Anaheim high school district board. He spent all of $8.13 on the
campaign, yet unseated the incumbent. The victory allowed us all to
again believe that the little guy still has a chance in politics.
Earlier, Hernandez had interrupted a career as a youth counselor to
work on the congressional campaign of Loretta Sanchez--at a time when
few believed she could defeat former Rep. Robert K. Dornan. And, late
in his life, Hernandez began teaching sixth-graders.</LD>
<TE>   Hernandez devoted much of his life to persuading little guys--and
girls--that they could succeed. He led a program that brought
inner-city kindergartners from uneducated families to college
campuses, planting the seed that they too merited a college
education. As a substitute teacher, Hernandez was not content to be a
baby-sitter; instead, he urged his young charges to study hard and
surprise the world.</TE>
<TE>   He had barely begun his new life as a teacher and high school
trustee when the tumor surfaced in January 2001. Hernandez responded
by using his remaining days as an inspiration to whomever he could
reach. He tweaked doctors by inserting joking references in his
calendar to "systems shutdown" the day doctors thought he would die.
He went past that day by nearly six months. He traveled to China,
where he struck up conversations with shopkeepers, tourists and
anyone who would listen. And, until his last days, he spoke and sang
at schools and churches, always seeking out children.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever you do in life, do your best," Hernandez exhorted them
and all of us. "Tell people how you feel about them. Learn as much as
you can. Don't wait until tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez could not overcome the ultimate reality of life, so the
world lost him, too young and at a time when his brand of optimism
and willingness to help are sorely needed. Left behind is the
question of whether we'll embrace this humble and humorous man's
beliefs. If we accept the challenge, Benny Hernandez will have made
the world a far richer place.</TE>

<HD>Helping to Shut Illegal Clinics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's been more than three years since a pair of Orange County
toddlers died after being treated in backroom clinics. County
officials have taken some action to combat the illegal shops--but
clearly not enough, because clinics are still threatening the health
of vulnerable residents.</LD>
<LD>   The district attorney's office is going after shops where people
with little or no training treat patients and illegally sell
prescription drugs. The drugs might be tucked away in gift shops,
health food stores and swap meets that often are located in the
county's immigrant communities. Prosecutors, for example, are
preparing to file charges against four shops in Little Saigon.</LD>
<LD>   Law enforcement alone, though, won't stamp out the shops. As long
as the demand exists, some people will risk supplying bogus drugs and
possibly life-threatening treatment.</LD>
<TE>   These fraudulent medical shops have strong appeal to Latino and
Vietnamese immigrants in part because they offer a cheap and readily
available source of treatment for low-paid workers who often lack
insurance. But the clinics raise a broader health issue than simple
access to safe care.</TE>
<TE>   Many Latino immigrants distrust U.S. doctors, according to a
recent study. Mexican immigrants, for example, are used to quick,
convenient and aggressive care, often featuring shots of penicillin.
Doctors in Mexico also are more likely to respect their patients'
belief in folk remedies and in the role that spirituality and
community play in health and illness.</TE>
<TE>   Illegal clinics are a danger to all Southern Californians. The
medications sold usually have been smuggled into the U.S. Many are
counterfeit, mislabeled, outdated or don't meet stricter U.S.
standards. And the overuse of antibiotics for every cold or flu
encourages resistant strains of bacteria.</TE>
<TE>   It's important to move quickly and decisively to shut down these
shops. County officials created the Safe Healthcare Program four
years ago to steer immigrants away from fraudulent clinics. The
program puts up posters, trains health-care providers who work with
immigrants and provides doctors with information about cultural
sensitivity. These attempts, though well-intentioned, fall short of
the creative street-level campaign needed to reach the people who
most need it.</TE>
<TE>   Schools could play a crucial and low-cost role in spreading the
word. The Latino and Vietnamese populations tend to have great
reverence for teachers and schools, creating an easy avenue to reach
parents.</TE>
<TE>   Immigrants often rely on their U.S.-educated children as the main
connection to their adopted country. Public schools already teach
children about the dangers of tobacco and drugs; it would be easy to
add illegal and inexpert medical care into the message. Fliers
warning about the dangers of illegal clinics should be going home in
students' backpacks.</TE>
<TE>   Spanish-language television and radio talk shows are immensely
popular among Latinos. These shows should be approached about their
willingness to tackle the subject because it would provide a needed
service to the community.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, it's important to take a closer look at how U.S. medical
care, with all of its superior science and technology, is failing
immigrants. Many of their health-care issues mirror those that
U.S.-born patients complain about--but grudgingly have come to
accept.</TE>
<TE>   Immigrants aren't alone in turning to alternative medicine and
self-treatment in the face of a cold, impersonal medical system. And
immigrant dissatisfaction with the status quo could help fuel
improvements for every patient.</TE>

<LD>Re "O.C. Lawman's Son, 17, Held in Rape," July 12:</LD>
<LD>   Your article detailing the career of Assistant Sheriff Donald G.
Haidl seems to have implicated the father instead of his accused son
for the rape. Anyone with children can tell you that we have little
control over our kids once they have become teens.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, our laws have made it nearly impossible for parents to
discipline their wayward children at all regardless of their ages. We
should be held no more responsible for our ancestors' acts than our
older children's. Certainly this alleged rape deserves some space in
your paper, but the episode should have been more prudently treated
as any other rape case be the parent of the accused a janitor or
senator.</LD>

<HD>WWII Papers Reveal a Rift Between Allies</HD>
<DH>History: Churchill objected to Eisenhower's D-day security
plans, an unsealed dossier shows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Prime Minister Winston Churchill took U.S. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower
to task over D-day security plans and a proposed radio address to the
German people in the closing months of World War II, according to
documents unsealed Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Churchill objected to attempts by Eisenhower, then commander in
chief of the Allied forces preparing to invade Normandy, to extend a
diplomatic blackout -- a ban on diplomatic activity, designed to
prevent D-day plans from being leaked -- beyond the day of the
offensive in June 1944.</LD>
<LD>   Churchill rejected Eisenhower's request because it would cause
"enormous inconvenience and friction" for his Foreign Office,
according to the dossier of wartime correspondence released by
Britain's Public Record Office.</LD>
<TE>   Writing to Eisenhower on May 31, 1944, Churchill said Britain
would not agree to an "indefinite diplomatic ban" after D-day that
Eisenhower requested.</TE>
<TE>   "It was we who first suggested this ban, and we did so to
reinforce the security measures for which you asked. The object was
to prevent D-day direction, method, etc., from leaking out,"
Churchill wrote.</TE>
<TE>   But he said Britain would not agree to prolong it "unless you are
able to show some new facts."</TE>
<TE>   "You probably have no idea of the enormous inconvenience and
friction which this system has caused," Churchill said.</TE>
<TE>   Churchill also objected to a proposed radio address to the German
people toward the end of the war, telling Eisenhower that the War
Cabinet was opposed "to this kind of propaganda."</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear from the documents what the address contained,
though it apparently touched on postwar arrangements for Germany.
Churchill told the general that the script he had seen would be
"ineffective and look like begging before we have won the battle."</TE>
<TE>   "I could also show that we are not telling the truth to these
people. The governments have not decided upon the many questions
connected with the partitioning of Germany.</TE>
<TE>   "The proposals which the British government put forward are very
drastic, but they are child's play compared to those of the United
States and Russia," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Churchill's information minister, Brendan Bracken, also complained
that American plans for a British Broadcasting Corp. radio service to
Allied troops created "all sorts of difficulties" for the government
and the BBC.</TE>
<TE>   "It is, in fact, a nightmare to us," Bracken told Churchill in a
memo forwarded to Eisenhower. Bracken and the BBC eventually agreed
to the U.S. plans.</TE>
<TE>   Other papers made public Saturday showed that Churchill suggested
blocking any telegrams that Gen. Charles de Gaulle of France might
send before D-day, to prevent him from revealing the invasion plans.</TE>
<TE>   Documents released in June showed that the British prime minister
told President Truman that the French leader was "one of the greatest
dangers to European peace."</TE>

<HD>24 Die After Fiery Performance in Peruvian Disco Triggers a
Blaze</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR and NATALIA TARNAWIECKI</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>LIMA, Peru</DL>
<LD>A fire-juggling act in a dangerously overcrowded nightclub here went
awry early Saturday and ignited a blaze that left at least 24 people
dead and dozens more injured.</LD>
<LD>   Most of those who perished were young adults who died of
asphyxiation as they tried to flee the flames at Utopia, an
unlicensed, recently built club that did not have fire alarms,
sprinklers or properly marked emergency exits, Peruvian authorities
said.</LD>
<LD>   The fire started about 3 a.m. and spread quickly through the
four-story disco in the Surco district of Lima. Among the victims
were children of some of Peru's most prominent political families.
The fashionable club is adjacent to the capital city's premier
shopping center, favored by the elite.</LD>
<TE>   "I started to run. I was one of the first three people out," said
one young man, who declined to give his name, as he waited outside a
morgue here. "There was so much smoke and I was choking.... There
were people jumping from the windows of the second floor."</TE>
<TE>   When the blaze broke out, about 1,000 people were inside
Utopia--more than double its capacity of 400, officials said.
Peruvian media reported that the dead and injured included relatives
and friends of the first and second vice presidents of Peru, Raul
Diez Canseco and David Waisman.</TE>
<TE>   Several caged animals that were part of the show--including a lion
and a Bengal tiger--died of asphyxiation, authorities said. A horse
survived, however.</TE>
<TE>   "This disco doesn't have a construction or an operating permit,"
said Carlos Dargent, the mayor of Surco, who promised a full
investigation. "There has been profound negligence on the part of the
people operating the club."</TE>
<TE>   The blaze started when a fire-eating juggler inadvertently set
fire to the ceiling, witnesses said. Some witnesses said a performer
standing next to the club's disc jockey was breathing columns of fire
toward the ceiling when nearby curtains ignited.</TE>
<TE>   Many people at the club thought, for a few moments, that the
spreading blaze was part of the show.</TE>
<TE>   "The music was cut, but it seemed like a controlled fire," said
Jimena Mariategui, a 25-year-old television reporter who was among
the people crowded into the club. "But then the fire got bigger, and
people started running."</TE>
<TE>   Some bartenders and patrons tossed beer and other drinks at the
spreading flames in a misguided attempt to extinguish the blaze.</TE>
<TE>   President Alejandro Toledo offered his condolences to the families
of the victims and promised to punish "with a hard, firm hand ... the
irresponsible people who run these types of establishments without
fulfilling the law."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Special correspondent Tarnawiecki reported from Lima and Times
staff writer Tobar from Buenos Aires.</TE>

<HD>Spain Leaves Disputed Islet Empty Again</HD>
<DH>Sovereignty: Troops depart rocky outcropping after
diplomatic intervention, but quarrel with Morocco is not resolved.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>Spain withdrew its military forces from a disputed islet off the
northwest coast of Africa on Saturday as part of a deal with Morocco
that returned the speck of rock to its previous status: empty.</LD>
<LD>   Though the move eased a military and diplomatic confrontation that
began more than a week ago, it did not bring a decisive end to the
rift over the outcropping, which the Spanish call Isla del Perejil,
or Parsley Island, and the Moroccans call Leila.</LD>
<LD>   Rather, the pullout was more akin to fighters returning to their
corners and agreeing to continue the match another day--although it
now appears that both sides have decided that diplomatic channels,
and not a military conflict, would probably be the best way to settle
ownership of an uninhabited rock best suited to grazing goats.</LD>
<TE>   "The Spanish government has withdrawn its forces from the Moroccan
islet of ... Leila after contacts, crowned with success, undertaken
by His Majesty King Mohammed VI with the American administration,"
Morocco's Foreign Ministry said through the country's official news
agency.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy over the rock inflamed Europe, outraged the Arab
world, and threatened to undermine U.S. efforts to combat
international terrorism by alienating two key players in the battle,
Spain and Morocco. The conflict also aggravated already raw feelings
between the Arab world and the West.</TE>
<TE>   From Spain's perspective, it was Morocco that instigated the
conflict July 11 when it ferried about a dozen police officers to the
islet, where they set up tents and, most alarming to Spain, raised
the Moroccan flag.</TE>
<TE>   But from Morocco's perspective, the whole affair began in 1956,
when Spain ended its colonial grip on Morocco but held on to several
enclaves just off the coast. Spain says the two nations signed a
treaty that gave Spain control of the enclaves; Morocco says the
treaty is just a nicety for occupation of Moroccan territory and must
be changed.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's be realistic," Moroccan Foreign Minister Mohammed Benaissa
said Friday. "Sooner or later, we must confront this subject. Spain
says it has a treaty, but it is a treaty of occupation. You can
change it."</TE>
<TE>   Few outside of Spain and Morocco had ever heard of these
territories--or, if they had, never calculated that such
strategically inconsequential areas could spark such a messy
conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Then Morocco sent its forces to the islet. It said the point was
to set up a watch post for illegal immigration and smuggling and to
aid in the war on terrorism--but it also pressed the point that the
rock's name was Leila and its nationality Moroccan.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, Europeans were aghast at what was being called the first
invasion of West European territory since World War II. Spain
threatened to suspend its friendship treaty with Morocco, and the
European Union was talking about imposing economic sanctions. The EU
said the issue was respect for international law.</TE>
<TE>   Morocco's king was celebrating his wedding when his police climbed
up on the rock, but his ministers seemed genuinely surprised at the
reaction to the country's maneuver. The government was even more
surprised when Spain moved warships into the vicinity, and it was
more shocked still when, on Wednesday morning, elite Spanish forces
landed on the island and took six Moroccan police officers prisoner.
They were later let go.</TE>
<TE>   Events were spiraling faster than either side had anticipated, or
cared for. Washington stepped in to help mediate between the two
nations, both of which it counts as friends.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department was first to announce Saturday that both
sides had agreed to return to the status quo, at least for now.</TE>
<TE>   "Following consultations by the United States ... the two sides
have agreed to restore the situation regarding the island that
existed prior to July 2002," Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials on both sides said Spanish Foreign Minister Ana Palacio
would meet Benaissa in Rabat, the Moroccan capital, on Monday. The
terms of the agreement were not disclosed. Spain said only that both
sides agreed to return the disputed rock to its previous status, void
of anything but some bugs, parsley and the occasional goat.</TE>

<DL>LAHORE, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Faisal Rahman pushed through the streets, looking for his boys.</LD>
<LD>   It was just after sunup. The crowds in Lahore were already hot and
unruly. His two sons, Bahram, 16, and Moona, 12, worked at a tea
cart, putting little white cups on little cracked saucers and serving
boiling-hot tea.</LD>
<LD>   But when he got there, Bahram was gone.</LD>
<TE>   Faisal Rahman sat for a moment with Moona, a beautiful boy with
huge brown eyes, and sipped some tea.</TE>
<TE>   The old man spilled one mouthful at a time onto the saucer, where
it would cool quickly, so he could slurp from the little plate and
savor the delicious coating left on his tongue. It tasted like creamy
candy.</TE>
<TE>   When he returned to the tea cart in the afternoon, Bahram still
had not come.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know where he is," Moona said.</TE>
<TE>   Then, Faisal Rahman would remember later, he heard men talking
excitedly in an alley. He moved closer and leaned against a tree to
hear. The men were from his village.</TE>
<TE>   "The boys left today," he heard a tall man say. "They went to
fight the infidels. They went with a mullah who took them to
Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   Someone else blew a kiss into the air. "Congratulations!" he said
to the tall man. "Your son is now a Taliban! It was his fate, his
kismet. Blessed that kismet!"</TE>
<TE>   Faisal Rahman listened. He did not want to talk. Something inside
him had broken, like the little saucer in his hand.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For boys from a poor village, the mullah's message was a call too
spellbinding to ignore.</TE>
<TE>   Faisal Rahman is from Gunbat Banda, a village near the Afghan
border where mountain peaks cut white teeth into the sky and the
hillsides are sown with wheat and rice. It is in the northwestern
corner of Pakistan, and most of its people are Pushtuns, the dominant
ethnic group in southern Afghanistan that brought the Taliban to
power six years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Once Rahman had a farm in Gunbat Banda, but a drought baked his
soil hard as stone.</TE>
<TE>   He left with his two sons and found work as a mosque watchman in
the city of Lahore, 300 miles away. For the boys, this meant no
school, no dreams, only countless cups of tea and the steady ticking
of time. Sometimes, on long, empty afternoons, Faisal Rahman would
take his boys to a juice bar and buy them cool banana shakes with
what little money he had.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes his sons would return to visit their mother. Just the
other day, for instance, Bahram had asked if he could go.</TE>
<TE>   Fine, Rahman recalls saying, but be back soon.</TE>
<TE>   The day after he found out about the boys joining the Taliban, he
stuffed a few things into a cloth sack and took the long bus ride
home.</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Zarina, was waiting for him in their hut, made of rock
and perched on the side of a hill.</TE>
<TE>   "Faisal, Faisal," she remembers telling him. "We tried to convince
Bahram not to go. We told him he would get killed."</TE>
<TE>   She cried as if Bahram were already dead.</TE>
<TE>   Rahman hugged her, but the pain was squeezing his chest too.</TE>
<TE>   Faisal Rahman is 55 and has a white beard, exhausted blue eyes and
a goiter that swells under his chin like a big, angry muscle.</TE>
<TE>   He walked down the hill to where the elders meet. Mohammed Razzaq
pressed his hand to Rahman's heart, a Pushtun greeting. He told
Faisal Rahman about the spellbinder.</TE>
<TE>   "Faisal, they have left," Razzaq said. "God has sent our boys
away. Yours too. We can only hope they return, inshallah," which
means "God willing."</TE>
<TE>   A mullah, Sufi Mohammed, had recruited them in November to fight
the invaders who came to Afghanistan after the terrorist attacks in
the United States. He used loudspeakers riveted onto pickup trucks to
blast his message.</TE>
<TE>   "Those who die fighting for God don't die! Those who go on jihad
live forever, in paradise!"</TE>
<TE>   The boys weren't madrasa students, primed for holy war. These were
simple boys, farm boys, illiterate and poor. "They were unsatisfied
with life," Razzaq said.</TE>
<TE>   About 500 went. Some brought knives. They declared that they were
ready to die for their Pushtun brothers, the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Some were as young as 12.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trapped and Under Siege</TE>
<TE>   In the end, there would be no escape.</TE>
<TE>   They were taken in trucks to the city of Mazar-i-Sharif in
northern Afghanistan, to the Sultan Razia girls school, which had
been converted into an army barracks. It is in a very poor
neighborhood, where women in muddy burkas peer from doorways and
children play along the road in slime-green ditches.</TE>
<TE>   It was Nov. 8, and the Northern Alliance had finally broken
through Taliban lines south of Mazar-i-Sharif. Nine thousand Northern
Alliance soldiers, under a sky full of American jets, were advancing
toward town, and the Taliban had gone into full retreat.</TE>
<TE>   By the next evening, when the Northern Alliance troops entered
Mazar-i-Sharif, all of the Taliban had escaped--except 750 recruits,
including the boys from Gunbat Banda.</TE>
<TE>   "We heard one Taliban commander radio to another: 'What should we
do about the newcomers in the school? They're trapped,' " remembers
Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, one of the Northern Alliance leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "The other commander radioed back: 'Forget about them.' "</TE>
<TE>   Bahram, the boy who had worked at the tea cart, later would recall
that he and the others were jammed together in classrooms on the
first floor. About 9 p.m., the sky cracked open with gunfire. Red
tracer bullets arced toward the moon. The walls groaned from heavy
explosions.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the boys cheered. They yelled that the Taliban was
attacking American planes. Some crouched under the windows and
pointed their rifle barrels outward. But one boy looked terrified,
Bahram related. "He said, 'No, those weren't Taliban bullets. It's
the people in the city, celebrating.' He told us it was the end."</TE>
<TE>   At dawn, the boys saw that the school had been surrounded by more
than 400 Northern Alliance soldiers. All night, they had not heard a
word from any of their Taliban commanders.</TE>
<TE>   The boys called a shura, a meeting. One proposed a "Hudaibiya
Pact," a treaty similar to one in the Koran in which Muhammad makes
peace with the Quraysh tribe in Mecca.</TE>
<TE>   But a man with a white beard didn't like this, Bahram said. He
asked the boy if he really was on a jihad. "He pulled out a knife,
and his eyes got big, and he said he would slit the boy's throat
right there and wash the floors with his blood.</TE>
<TE>   "The boy stopped talking."</TE>
<TE>   When the recruits refused to surrender, the Northern Alliance
began hammering the school with .50-caliber machine guns. The
recruits shot back. Several bystanders were cut down in the
cross-fire, which went on for hours. Inside the battered school, some
of the boys scrawled on the walls the words of their mullah: "Die for
Pakistan" and "Never Surrender."</TE>
<TE>   At midafternoon, American military advisors approved the school
for a bombing run. "We had determined the school was an appropriate
target," said Army Col. Rick Thomas of the U.S. Central Command. "Our
philosophy has been surrender or die."</TE>
<TE>   At 3:30 p.m., an F/A-18 jet dropped a 1,000-pound bomb on the west
end of the school, Thomas said, and three minutes later another bomb
fell.</TE>
<TE>   The roof crashed down. Black smoke boiled up. Burning boys ran out
screaming. Some had pieces of twisted metal sticking out of their
chests.</TE>
<TE>   "May God never show us such things again," said Amin Mohammed, a
neighbor, who later helped round up at least 200 of the boys. Some
were bleeding to death.</TE>
<TE>   Bahram ran outside and hid in a pile of sticks. An hour later, the
Northern Alliance troops captured him.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'I Did It to Save Her Life'</TE>
<TE>   Winter came to Gunbat Banda, outside and in the hearts of its
people.</TE>
<TE>   The elders made a list of all the boys who had gone to
Afghanistan. By now, weeks had passed, the rivers had iced over, and
none had returned.</TE>
<TE>   Bahram's mother thought that she was going blind. "The crying, the
crying, it's killing my eyes," she told her husband during one of his
visits.</TE>
<TE>   Faisal Rahman had to do something.</TE>
<TE>   So one night, he wrapped himself in the thickest shawl he could
find and set out with two other fathers. In the freezing cold, they
hiked to a border checkpoint on the banks of the Swat River. From
there, he would recount, they thought that they could cross a bridge
and catch a ride up the Karakoram Highway into Afghanistan. They
wanted to see their sons.</TE>
<TE>   But a soldier at the checkpoint would not lift the gate.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he leveled an assault rifle at Faisal Rahman's hollow
chest. No one was going into Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "It is their fate," Abdul Sharif Khan, one of the fathers, said of
their sons.</TE>
<TE>   "No," Rahman replied, "God would not approve."</TE>
<TE>   Two of the fathers returned to Gunbat Banda, their backs bent,
along the snow-dusted banks of the river.</TE>
<TE>   But Rahman went straight to Lahore. There he sent a letter. He is
illiterate, so a card wallah wrote it for a few rupees.</TE>
<TE>   Dear Zarina, it began. I have just returned from Jalalabad and
seen our son. He is good. He is healthy. He has enough food....</TE>
<TE>   "I did it," Rahman said, "to save her life."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Finding a Survivor</TE>
<TE>   Too often horror begets more horror.</TE>
<TE>   By now it was early spring in Mazar-i-Sharif, and I had been
assigned to write about the battle at the girls school, one of the
bloodiest confrontations of the war in Afghanistan. I had spoken to
Northern Alliance commanders, U.S. commanders and residents who had
witnessed the siege and the bombing. One piece of information was
missing.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody knew what had become of the young Taliban recruits from
Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   I tried a prison in Sheberghan, two hours east. It was a medieval
fortress with huge, mud walls and long, frightening hallways, where
men thrust their arms through bars and shook dirty plastic buckets.</TE>
<TE>   "Aab, aab," they moaned--"Water, water."</TE>
<TE>   The place smelled of sweat, urine and rotting flesh. Some of the
captives picked crawling lice out of their hair and flicked them
through the bars.</TE>
<TE>   But none of the prisoners were from the girls school.</TE>
<TE>   Northern Alliance commanders had different explanations. One said
all the boys were killed instantly in the bombing. Another said a few
survived but died of their wounds. A jailer spoke of a "road
accident" that claimed 43 prisoners' lives.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, a young Northern Alliance commander, Sayed Zahir, said
some of the Pakistani recruits were alive.</TE>
<TE>   They were being held as slaves, he said. "I know where one is."</TE>
<TE>   Zahir and three of his men drove to a cinder-block house with a
blue metal gate at the edge of Mazar-i-Sharif, in a place called
Dasht-i-Shardian, which means "the desert of happy people."</TE>
<TE>   At first, soldiers would not let us see their prisoner. They said
he was too frightened. Then they said their commander was out of town
and would be angry.</TE>
<TE>   Nonsense, Zahir replied. He glanced at his men, standing behind
him with guns.</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers brought out a boy.</TE>
<TE>   That was how I met Bahram. They sat him in the middle of a bald
little room with concrete walls and a smoking stove that put out a
thin circle of heat.</TE>
<TE>   He looked horrible. He had on a filthy shalwar kameez, worn and
ghost-thin. His arms were crisscrossed with cuts. His big, dark eyes
were glassy. His hands shook. He kept wiping away tears.</TE>
<TE>   Where was he from? How had he been captured?</TE>
<TE>   How old was he?</TE>
<TE>   He saw I was an American. "Don't hurt!" he cried. "Don't hurt!"</TE>
<TE>   Gently, I told him that I was going to Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   He stopped staring at the floor and began to speak of Faisal
Rahman, his father, who swept the floors of a mosque in Lahore;
Zarina, his mother; Moona, his younger brother, and how they had
worked together at the tea cart. He spoke of his journey over the
mountains into Afghanistan and of the other boys and of the girls
school--all in broken, breathless sentences.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, he spoke of the bombing. And the fire.</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers said it was time to go. I took his picture. He seemed
sad. Before he disappeared down a frosty hallway, he looked at me and
said, "I have never seen such days as these."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Not Our Problem'</TE>
<TE>   There was no help. A man at the Red Cross in Mazar-i-Sharif
listened closely. When he heard about the puffy cuts on Bahram's
arms, he closed his eyes. "There's little we can do," he said. "The
Red Cross has to be careful not to alienate itself from the factions
we work with."</TE>
<TE>   A United Nations human rights officer said the same.</TE>
<TE>   So did an American soldier at a post the Army keeps in
Mazar-i-Sharif, mostly for humanitarian projects like fixing
generators and passing out soccer balls. He said, "Sounds bad. But
not our problem."</TE>
<TE>   A Northern Alliance security official said he too was helpless.
"It's wrong what they're doing," Shajaudin said, as he lighted a
clove cigarette. He said Bahram was being held in a private jail by a
local commander. "We can ask him to release the boy, but we can't
make him, because that could cause trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Shajaudin said at least 1,500 prisoners, mostly boys, were being
held in private jails.</TE>
<TE>   Could it be that Bahram was being sexually abused?</TE>
<TE>   "It is a custom," Shajaudin declared, blowing a ring of
sweet-smelling smoke around his head. "With boys that age, before
they have hair on the faces, these things happen."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Game of Horror</TE>
<TE>   It was hopeless.</TE>
<TE>   "Allah, Allah, Allah," Faisal Rahman prayed, when he saw the
picture of his boy.</TE>
<TE>   At the mosque in Lahore, he told me about the morning that Bahram
disappeared and about finding out why. Then he reached into a pocket
and pulled out a 5-inch square of notebook paper, worn and very soft.
It was a ransom demand.</TE>
<TE>   A newly released prisoner named Jimshade had brought it in
January. The note listed numbers to call and people to ask for. There
was a figure at the bottom: 125,000 rupees, about $2,100.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes," Rahman said, "I wish Bahram had been martyred."</TE>
<TE>   We went from Lahore to a village near Gunbat Banda, where Jimshade
said he too was a follower of the mullah Sufi Mohammed. He said he
had gone to the girls school in Mazar-i-Sharif and was captured. He
spent six weeks as a slave, he said, before his family bought his
freedom for the equivalent of $1,100.</TE>
<TE>   "The soldiers do things to you," he said, "that make you want to
kill yourself.</TE>
<TE>   "They have this game--they think they are so clever for thinking
it all up--they call keel," which means "nail."</TE>
<TE>   "They start with the youngest prisoners and ask them their age,"
he continued. "If a boy says 13, they send 13 soldiers to him. If he
says 16, the boy gets 16."</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers take turns raping the boys, Jimshade said. "They take
them to an underground room and hold the boys down, and the whole
house fills with screaming, and the soldiers yell louder than the
screaming, like they are mad or crazy or have turned into wild
animals: 'Keel! Keel!'</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes," he said, his voice shrinking, "I still hear them."</TE>
<TE>   Faisal Rahman, a watchman living under a blanket on the roof of a
mosque with a bar of yellow soap and a little jug of water, has been
trying to save 10 rupees a day to free his son.</TE>
<TE>   At that rate, it would take him 34 years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Clinging to Hope</TE>
<TE>   The elders would say it was a sign from God.</TE>
<TE>   In early April, planting season, I finally reached Gunbat Banda.
The chunk-chunk-chunk of spades driving into the dirt rang across the
hills.</TE>
<TE>   Bahram's mother, Zarina, small, thin and once beautiful, was
sitting outside her rock hut. There was very little inside, but from
somewhere she produced a silver pitcher, poured cool spring water
into it and placed it on a simple white cloth.</TE>
<TE>   "Here," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She looked at the picture.</TE>
<TE>   "Bahram! Bahram! Bahram!" she cried.</TE>
<TE>   The hut was filled with dark eyes watching--aunts, uncles,
cousins.</TE>
<TE>   "They all ask me where he went," Bahram's mother said. "I told
him, 'You don't have any money. You've never put a gun in your hands.
Your father is not here.' But he wouldn't listen."</TE>
<TE>   Village elders came. They brought little pieces of paper with a
name on each. Find my son, please, they asked.</TE>
<TE>   There are a hundred Bahrams here, Mohammed Razzaq said. "They
aren't terrorists. They are uneducated children who listened to a
mullah give them the concept of heaven and hell.</TE>
<TE>   "He deceived them, under the name of Islam."</TE>
<TE>   While the elders were shaking their heads, Faisal Rahman pulled
out a picture of Bahram. It was in a silver frame and covered with
cracked glass. He carried it everywhere in his sack but usually kept
it hidden.</TE>
<TE>   The elders admired it in silence.</TE>
<TE>   "You are trying hard, Faisal," Razzaq said finally. "But all this
has been written, written by God."</TE>
<TE>   Faisal Rahman put the picture back into his sack. He hugged
Razzaq.</TE>
<TE>   As he walked away, he spun his hand up and pointed toward the sky,
as if to say, heaven knows what will happen and heaven is on my side.
Inshallah.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 19, 2001, Sufi Mohammed, the mullah who had recruited
Bahram and the other boys from Gunbat Banda, was arrested by
Pakistani authorities, along with 29 of his followers, near the
Afghan border. He was sent to prison for seven years for carrying
lethal arms and entering Pakistan illegally.</TE>
<TE>   Bahram remains in captivity.</TE>

<HD>Pope's Health Fuels Debate</HD>
<DH>Canon law does not require an ailing pontiff to step down</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VATICAN CITY</DL>
<LD>In plain sight of a global audience, Pope John Paul II has endured an
assassin's bullets, a broken hip, four operations, an arthritic knee,
the ravages of old age and the debilitating, immobilizing symptoms of
Parkinson's disease.</LD>
<LD>   Now, as he prepares for a trip this week to the Americas, the most
public of pontiffs is beset by an indignity no predecessor has had to
face: increasingly open debate in the Vatican and the Roman Catholic
Church over whether he should quit because of ill health.</LD>
<LD>   The worry is not so much that he will suddenly die, but rather
that he will become senile or be left in a coma, throwing the church
into a leadership crisis. Under Catholic canon law, a pope may resign
but cannot be retired against his will, even if he is mentally unfit
to rule.</LD>
<TE>   Concern has grown in the last 10 months as Parkinson's, a
neurological disorder whose symptoms first appeared in John Paul a
decade ago, began to steal the pope's already quavering voice. John
Paul, 82, often looks like a spectator to his own pontificate,
sitting passively as aides read homilies that he starts but cannot
finish.</TE>
<TE>   No one in the Vatican, a secretive bureaucracy that resembles the
court of an absolute monarch, has dared to call publicly for the
pope's abdication.</TE>
<TE>   But German Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger broke a taboo in May, telling
reporters that he believed the pope would resign if his condition
became so bad that he felt incapable of carrying on in his job.
Ratzinger, the Vatican's top theologian, is one of the pope's most
powerful aides, and his remarks were echoed by a leading Latin
American cardinal, Oscar Rodriguez Maradiaga of Honduras.</TE>
<TE>   According to Vittorio Messori, a Catholic writer who co-wrote a
book with the pope, several unnamed cardinals have privately urged
John Paul to "examine, in the presence of God," the possibility of
quitting, to avoid the scenario of a church paralyzed by his eventual
incapacitation. Such appeals, Messori says, come as much from the
pope's allies as from his detractors.</TE>
<TE>   John Paul, who trembles badly despite medication and who can no
longer walk unassisted, has replied emphatically that he has no
intention of stepping down. No pope has done so willingly since 1294.
On Tuesday, he will begin an 11-day journey to Canada, Guatemala and
Mexico--his latest display of will to soldier on.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel every day that my ministry is sustained by the incessant
prayer of the people of God, of so many people ... who offer their
prayers for the pope," the pontiff told pilgrims in St. Peter's
Square at the end of June. "In moments of great difficulty and
suffering, this spiritual strength is an immense help and an intimate
consolation."</TE>
<TE>   Vatican officials said the pope's remark was meant to silence
debate over his health. It has not.</TE>
<TE>   In a nationwide poll in Mexico this month, 58% of Catholics,
concerned about his frailty, said they wished John Paul would cancel
his scheduled visit. In the survey by the Mexican newspaper Reforma,
52% said popes should retire after a certain age or term of office.</TE>
<TE>   A Latin American cardinal who works at the Vatican said last week
that John Paul should stay home. Catholic commentators now question
the value of putting the pope's suffering on display--a condition
that adds poignancy to his pilgrimages but dramatizes his limitations
as chief executive of a billion-member church.</TE>
<TE>   A further decline of the pope's health could cripple the Holy See
and limit its voice in world affairs. Only the pope may appoint
bishops and form dioceses. Vatican departments and diplomats require
his approval on a wide range of decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "In a church so exceptionally centralized, where does the balance
lie between everyday weakness at the administrative center and the
pope's continuing capacity for occasional--but still sometimes
astonishing--displays of charismatic leadership on the world stage?"
the Tablet, a London-based Catholic weekly, asked in a recent
editorial weighing the pros and cons of resignation. "The danger is
that the pope's frail physical state could be seen as a sign of
church sclerosis."</TE>
<TE>   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls acknowledges that the pope
"is operating under limitations that are visible to all" but insists
that John Paul's memory, sense of humor and ability to plan "are all
intact."</TE>
<TE>   And people who have seen John Paul up close recently say that, on
a good day, he seems more lucid than the anguished glimpses of him on
television might suggest.</TE>
<TE>   But Parkinson's in its advanced stages can cause dementia--a loss
of memory and other mental functions. As many as 30% of Parkinson's
patients older than 70 develop this condition, scientists report, and
some drugs that relieve tremors and other physical symptoms of the
disease might actually aggravate dementia.</TE>
<TE>   Experts noted that the pope's difficulties in talking are a
symptom of the disease rather than of mental impairment. And they
cautioned that dementia, if it develops, can progress very
slowly--beginning with mild symptoms and evolving into full-blown
disease over two to three years.</TE>
<TE>   In previous centuries, Catholics could muddle along with senile or
sick pontiffs. The pope was less visible, his decisions less urgent,
the church less centralized. Today an absent John Paul would be
missed immediately.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more of a problem now that modern medicine can keep a pope
alive well beyond his ability to function in the job," said Father
Thomas J. Reese, a Jesuit and author of a study on the workings of
the Vatican. "What the church needs is an equivalent of the 25th
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution," which provides for a successor
if the president is unable to discharge his duties.</TE>
<TE>   Before his death two years ago, Father James H. Provost, then a
professor of canon law at Catholic University in Washington, put
forward such a proposal. He called for the adoption of church laws
that would specify who would determine whether a pope was
incapacitated and how the church would be governed until a new
pontiff could be elected. His idea found no support in the Vatican,
in part because no one wanted to be seen as trying to oust John Paul.</TE>
<TE>   "John Paul should resign," said a prominent Catholic theologian,
noting that bishops must retire at age 75 and cardinals may not take
part in electing a pope at 80.</TE>
<TE>   "It's absurd," the theologian added. "If he were a priest, his
bishop would make him resign. If he were a bishop, the Vatican would
make him resign. The only job he's qualified for is that of pope. But
I can't say that publicly, because someone would make me resign."</TE>
<TE>   Some officials and observers here believe that John Paul may have
taken the problem in hand by preparing a resignation letter to be
made public in the event of his total disability. Part of the debate
here over John Paul's condition centers on whether such a letter
exists.</TE>
<TE>   "John Paul II is a man of profound responsibility; it's
inconceivable he hasn't thought of that scenario," said George
Weigel, an American theologian and author of a biography on the pope.
"What measures has he taken to put his decision into effect? I have
no idea."</TE>
<TE>   Italian Cardinal Ersilio Tonini insisted this month that "no such
[resignation] letter exists," although Vatican watchers doubt that he
has inside information.</TE>
<TE>   "The pope is not ashamed to show himself weak, tired," the
cardinal told the Roman newspaper La Repubblica. "He feels that it is
divine will that leads him, and because of this he will never stop."</TE>

<HD>Culinary Tradition Poses a Health Risk in Hong Kong</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEXANDRIA SAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HONG KONG</DL>
<LD>Public health concerns threaten to end a generations-old tradition of
Hong Kong food shoppers: buying their poultry live at special
markets.</LD>
<LD>   The problem is a recurring avian influenza virus that in recent
years has become both difficult and costly for the public health
authorities to control. Government leaders, aware of the political
sensitivities involved in ordering an end to such a popular
tradition, are hesitant to talk of banning poultry, especially
chickens, from these markets for good, but many of those involved in
the trade believe that it's just a matter of time.</LD>
<LD>   "Eventually, people have to face the fact that we must deal with
frozen or chilled chicken," said Mark Yiu-tong, president of the
Federation of Hong Kong Restaurant Owners. He predicted that within
two years, live chickens will no longer be sold.</LD>
<TE>   Freshly slaughtered chicken is a popular part of the traditional
Chinese meal, and in Hong Kong, about 100,000 live birds are sold
each day, according to government figures. The live birds--along with
fresh fish, meat and vegetables--are sold at "wet markets," so named
because the market floors are hosed down at the end of business each
day.</TE>
<TE>   For a region that has kept precious few traditions during its
transformation from a small immigrant haven to global financial
center over the past 50 years, the loss of live poultry in Hong
Kong's 80-plus wet markets would be a blow.</TE>
<TE>   Although homemakers love the markets because they can handpick
their birds, see them slaughtered on site and know that they are
fresh when they hit the dinner table, virologists view them
differently. For them, the wet markets are perfect breeding grounds
for the airborne flu virus that killed six people in 1997 and early
1998 and led to the slaughter of every chicken in Hong Kong.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, two strains of the extremely mutable virus have
surfaced. Although they did not affect humans, they devastated the
poultry markets. In May 2001, about 1.2 million chickens from Hong
Kong farms and markets were slaughtered as a precaution, and in
February thousands more were destroyed when a variation of the virus
was discovered on 22 local farms.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, a government-commissioned investigation into the most
recent incident found that eliminating the flu is impossible as long
as the trade in live poultry exists. By lengthening the time that
chickens and other fowl are in the production chain, wet markets
provide more opportunity for a virus to develop, mutate and turn
deadly.</TE>
<TE>   "There will always be a risk of further outbreaks ... with the
accompanying potential risk to public health," the report concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the public health dangers, the virus has also become a
financial burden on the government. So far, authorities in the
Chinese territory have paid out more than $15 million in workers'
compensation payments during the three avian flu crises and are now
forced to spend almost $5 million annually on a surveillance program
to monitor markets and farms for any new possible outbreaks.</TE>
<TE>   At least for now, the government seems prepared to spend that
money because the wet markets are so popular. Certainly local
residents agree that freshly killed chickens taste better than the
chilled or frozen alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   "Local Chinese know the difference," said Allan Zeman, a prominent
local restaurateur. "There is a distinct taste difference. Some
restaurants try to use frozen chicken, and the public just won't
accept that."</TE>
<TE>   Livelihoods also are an issue. The local poultry industry, which
employs more than 5,000 people, has adamantly opposed any major
changes in the way chickens are sold. An underlying fear is that
eventually all chicken will be imported chilled from mainland China,
essentially putting the Hong Kong poultry industry out of business.</TE>
<TE>   "If live chicken is banned in the wet markets, all the people
working in this industry will lose their jobs," said Lee Yuet,
spokesman for the Poultry Trade Workers Union. "The government has to
be very careful in dealing with this."</TE>
<TE>   Health officials have been trying to improve cleanliness in the
wet markets. The markets are closed a day every month for a full
disinfection, and there is talk of shutting them down for a second
day each month. But that would cut further into already-tight
incomes.</TE>
<TE>   Others have proposed a highly controlled central slaughtering
facility, but there are doubts that the government would commit to
such an expensive plan when eliminating the virus isn't guaranteed.</TE>
<TE>   Although many believe that chickens in wet markets will eventually
have to go, few believe that the change will be accepted quietly.</TE>
<TE>   "There would be a huge outcry," Zeman predicted. "And then ...
you'd see an illegal chicken market spring up."</TE>
<TE>   One 76-year-old shopper, who identified herself only as Mrs.
Leung, seemed to personify the public's reluctance to give up the old
tradition, even if the markets do eventually change.</TE>
<TE>   "If the government bans live chickens here, then I'll just have to
go to mainland China to buy them," she said, smiling. "I'll find
them."</TE>

cooked properly, the chicken poses no risk, despite warnings about
avian flu.</CP>

<HD>Lives Forever Scarred After Suicide Bombings</HD>
<DH>Israel: Survivors labor to recover physically and mentally.
Some still have shrapnel in their bodies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Motti Mizrahi groans and clenches his teeth. "Wait, wait!" he hisses
to the therapist, whose expert form of torture is to push, lift and
stretch Mizrahi's mangled arm.</LD>
<LD>   He lowers his lifeless limb, encased in a spiked contraption meant
to hold the slowly re-fusing bones in place. He sighs, inhales and
tries again.</LD>
<LD>   Four months have gone by since Mizrahi was critically wounded in a
Palestinian suicide bombing at a Jerusalem cafe where he was chatting
with a friend. Steel nuts and bolts packed inside the bomb pierced
his chest and the back of his skull. They smashed all the bones in
his left forearm and upper arm. His hand was nearly sheared off, held
on by pieces of flesh and ligament.</LD>
<TE>   Today, three surgeries later, a nut still rests about a third of
an inch from his heart. Nine nickel-size holes are gouged in his arm.
Mizrahi's recovery, if there is to be one, takes five hours of
body-bending physical therapy four days a week, and X-rays every two
weeks to monitor his progress.</TE>
<TE>   Mizrahi is one of an estimated 2,500 Israelis--40 last week
alone--who have been wounded in suicide bombings since Palestinians
rose up against Israeli occupation nearly 22 months ago after the
collapse of peace talks. Headlines have focused on the fatalities:
About 270 people, most of them Israeli Jews, have been killed in more
than 70 bombings.</TE>
<TE>   But the lasting impact may best be measured in an emerging
population that is permanently scathed and scarred, living reminders
of the horror of the bombings. They will require years of costly and
complicated physical and mental rehabilitation. In addition to paying
for most of the medical care, the state must also absorb the losses
to its work force.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli doctors calculate that 40% of the injured will have
significant permanent disability.</TE>
<TE>   Israel has a long experience with suicide bombings and car bombs.
What has made the current campaign more lethal--and more debilitating
in the long term--is the increased use of hardware loaded into the
explosive packages.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier generations of bombs were packed with small ball bearings;
today, heavier, deadlier metal is used. From screws and nails to
scrap metal from construction sites and, in one case, blood-thinning
rat poison, the additives boost the devastating nature of each
explosion.</TE>
<TE>   "It's much more insidious," said Dr. Ricardo Segal, chief
neurosurgeon at the sprawling and busy Hadassah hospital in Ein
Kerem, just west of Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't have the same energy that you have with high-velocity
injuries, so many more pieces of metal go through the body and are
stuck there. It may not be damage that will kill, but it creates a
major dilemma: how to correct the damage without causing more
damage."</TE>
<TE>   Digging into a brain to retrieve a bolt lodged there can easily
harm the patient more than the original injury, Segal said. Such are
the questions that the Argentine-born surgeon weighs on a regular
basis. He said his earlier wartime experience of caring for bullet
and regular explosive wounds only partially prepared him for what he
has seen in the last months.</TE>
<TE>   A year has gone by since Paulina Valis and Emma Skuleshevsky, two
Israeli high school students, put on their dancing shoes, touched up
their eye shadow and headed out on a Friday night for their favorite
disco, the Dolphinarium on Tel Aviv's bustling seafront boardwalk.</TE>
<TE>   They were waiting outside the club in a thick queue of friends,
classmates and others when a 22-year-old Palestinian, Said Hotary,
detonated the nail-studded bomb strapped to his body. An impossibly
bright flash of light, a rushing roar of noise, the acrid smell of
blood and burning flesh, and Valis and Skuleshevsky flew through the
air before crashing to the ground and blacking out. Twenty-two people
were killed, more than 100 wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Skuleshevsky walks around today with a nail in her head and two
more in her abdomen. She and Valis have so much shrapnel in their
bodies that every now and again, small pieces rise to the surface of
their skin and fleck off like metallic dandruff.</TE>
<TE>   "They told me to expect such surprises in my life," Valis said.</TE>
<TE>   Once a runner, dancer and aerobics enthusiast, Valis, 19, has had
to learn how to walk again. A crinkly ribbon of a gash marks her
right shin and calf where several inches of flesh were ripped away.
She moves gingerly, taking a flight of stairs in a mall slowly. Her
weak hand frequently touches her face, in hesitation.</TE>
<TE>   "I had lots of plans," said the native of Uzbekistan with curly
red hair, who immigrated to Israel 12 years ago. "I wanted to go into
the army, and I wanted to go to university and travel. Now I can
study, but it's going to be very hard. It's hard for me to
concentrate. I can't travel. I can't go into the army because the
army won't accept me. Now I depend on hospitals."</TE>
<TE>   Valis spent two months in the hospital after the blast and has had
many surgeries. It took a good eight months, she said, before she
could go to a sidewalk cafe or ride a public bus. She was so
terrified.</TE>
<TE>   Between regular visits to orthopedists, neurologists, plastic
surgeons, physical therapists and a counselor, Valis has managed to
finish her senior year of high school. But she has lots of questions.</TE>
<TE>   "My main question is, why?" she said. "God decided I should stay
alive, but I don't think I should thank him for that because he took
a lot of my friends. There are no answers."</TE>
<TE>   Skuleshevsky, 18, has managed to recover most of her ability to
walk and dance, but she tires easily and has to do everything in
moderation. She has narrowed her circle of friends--few people can
really understand what she's been through--and limited her education
to correspondence courses with a local university.</TE>
<TE>   Mizrahi, the man with the injured arm, also had a lot of plans.</TE>
<TE>   An athletic 31-year-old computer software engineer who heads the
information technology department for the Israeli city of Modiin,
Mizrahi has been sidelined from work since the attack. He tries to
maintain telephone contact with his staff, but it's not the same.
Meanwhile, the municipality's soccer team, where he was a star
forward, has sunk from second to fifth place in his absence.</TE>
<TE>   The pain, he said, is still constant, months after the injuries.
He is reluctant to continue taking the morphine and other painkillers
that the doctors prescribe because they impair normal activity and he
worries about addiction.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to believe that I will recover my life and do the same
things I did before," he said. "But I know it will be hard and it
will take a long time."</TE>
<TE>   For him and others, it's an open question whether recovery will
ever be complete.</TE>
<TE>   Adi Hudja, who just turned 15, will never fully recover. She was
strolling with friends through the Ben Yehuda pedestrian mall in
Jerusalem late on the night of Dec. 1 as they tried to decide where
to go and what to eat. Two bombers standing a few feet apart blew
themselves up that night, killing 11 people and wounding 100.</TE>
<TE>   About 40 steel nuts bored their way into Adi's body--two in her
rib cage, six in the pelvic region and most of the rest in her legs.
Both tibiae and femurs were fractured. Photographs from that night
show her legs looking like bloody Swiss cheese.</TE>
<TE>   One of the bombers used rat poison in his explosive device,
according to Dr. Avi Rivkind, head of emergency care at the Hadassah
hospital. The poison works as a blood thinner and causes those
exposed to bleed profusely and die more quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Adi "bled like hell," Rivkind said. He finally staunched the flow
with a drug used for hemophilia patients.</TE>
<TE>   Adi spent weeks in intensive care, underwent 15 surgeries,
numerous bone grafts and only narrowly averted amputation of a leg.
She faces additional surgery to improve the alignment of her legs.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels like it's been a year in and out of the hospital," Adi
said the other day, lying in a hospital bed with the latest cast
enveloping her leg, punctuated by a discolored and misshapen foot
poking out of the end. "It's not so bad. I'm walking now, but just
with one leg."</TE>
<TE>   Adi's worried mother, Malka, a police officer, sat at her side.
"We don't know how long [recuperation] will be," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Meir Liebergall, who heads the hospital's orthopedics
department, said his patient will always have, at the minimum, a limp
and numerous scars.</TE>
<TE>   "If she can walk, even with a cane or a walker, then we will
consider that a tremendous success," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon Maman, 22, also was at the Ben Yehuda mall that night. The
bolt in his brain has left him severely disabled. A fun-loving youth
who had just finished his military duty as an air force mechanic,
Maman now lies limp in a hospital ward, unable to speak. He cries and
moans a lot.</TE>
<TE>   "He hurts physically, but I think even more spiritually," said his
sister, Fanni Romberg, at his side along with their mother.</TE>
<TE>   In six months, he has learned to shave and feed himself, his
therapists said.</TE>
<TE>   In Israel's crowded emergency rooms after each bombing, the motto
is "life, then limbs." Triage and urgent surgery save the lives, and
decisions are made later about whether limbs are amputated or
reattached.</TE>
<TE>   "The first 24 hours are a struggle for life," Liebergall said.
"Then the struggle is for the quality of life."</TE>
<TE>   The question of whether people can function independently again
has a far-reaching impact on society. Will the victims return to the
work force, or will they rely forever on state care? Unlike the
Palestinians, whose numbers of wounded in the conflict surpass those
of Israelis by an enormous margin, Israelis can count on a social
services system in which medical and psychological care are paid for
by the government.</TE>
<TE>   Still, many of the wounded say they feel forgotten, overlooked in
the outcry over the dead and in the numbing succession of attacks.
They are little more than a statistic, usually referred to in local
parlance as the "lightly injured"--meaning they survived.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing I learned is, it never really ends--the trauma goes on,
the nightmare, the fear of vulnerability," said Sara Levinsky Rigler,
a writer who volunteers with a Jewish Orthodox organization to assist
victims and their families.</TE>
<TE>   "We think, 'lightly injured.' 'They got off lucky.' 'They'll be
OK.' They'll never be OK. It's a misnomer. Lives are ruined."</TE>

<DL>NAIROBI, Kenya</DL>
<LD>The Sudanese government and southern rebels have agreed on how to
resolve the major issues in one of Africa's longest civil wars and
reached a framework Saturday for talks next month to draft a final
peace deal, delegates said.</LD>
<LD>   Ghazi Salah al Din Atabani, the government's peace advisor, and
Samson Kwaje, spokesman for the Sudan People's Liberation Army, said
they have reached agreement on the separation of state and religion
as well as self-determination for the southern Sudanese.</LD>
<LD>   Both men said the remaining issues will be relatively easy to
resolve when the parties meet again in August.</LD>
<TE>   The rebel delegation was led by the group's second in command,
Salva Kiir, who signed the agreement, which was reached in
negotiations held for the last month in the Kenyan town of Machakos,
about 30 miles southeast of Nairobi, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say there is a deep distrust between the two sides, and
many deals signed in the past were violated. The agreements reached
Saturday remain fairly vague, and details must be settled before they
can be implemented.</TE>
<TE>   But renewed international interest in recent months--most
significantly from the United States--has restoked the desire to end
the war, and observers welcomed the fact that the sides appeared to
have found some common ground.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a major break with the past," regional political analyst
Moustafa Hassouna said. "I think there has been a creation of a
middle ground ... that has yielded concessions that have never been
verbalized before."</TE>
<TE>   "We have agreed that unity must be the priority," Atabani said. He
added that the government will allow an internationally monitored
referendum in the south after a six-year interim period to allow the
people to decide whether they want to be part of Sudan. That period
will begin once a final peace deal is signed, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kwaje said that "the most critical issues have been solved,"
including the government's attempts to impose Islamic law, known as
Sharia, on southerners, who mostly follow traditional religions and
Christianity. The Sudanese Constitution would be rewritten to ensure
that Sharia law can be used in the north but will not infringe on the
rights of non-Muslims in the south.</TE>
<TE>   Sudan's civil war broke out in 1983. An estimated 2 million people
have died, mainly through war-induced famine, and about 4 million
have been forced to flee their homes.</TE>

<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israel said Saturday that it was willing to take new measures to
improve life for Palestinians--provided the attacks against Israelis
end--in a resumption of high-level talks that had been called off
after bombings last week, Israeli officials and news reports said.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres met with a Palestinian
delegation headed by Palestinian Cabinet Minister Saeb Erekat for
more than three hours, said Yaffa Ben-Ari, a Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman.</LD>
<LD>   The Palestinians urged the Israelis to end their occupation of
Palestinian cities and towns in the West Bank, saying they couldn't
prevent terrorist attacks if the Israelis were in control, Israel
Radio said. In addition, Palestinians demanded that Israel release
tax money it has withheld, the report said.</LD>
<TE>   The Palestinian economy has been shattered by nearly 22 months of
fighting--and more recently by Israel's occupation of West Bank
cities.</TE>
<TE>   Before fighting erupted in September 2000, an estimated 125,000
Palestinians crossed daily into Israel for work. Israel has since
blocked most Palestinians from entering. Closures in the West Bank
and curfews in individual towns have further prevented Palestinians
from working.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, Israeli Cabinet members approved some measures to
ease the situation, including increasing the number of permits for
Palestinians to work in Israel from 2,000 to 7,000, a security
official said.</TE>
<TE>   After two attacks in Israel last week claimed 12 lives, Defense
Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer froze implementation of the decisions.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Peres told the Palestinians that the 7,000 work
permits would be issued in the coming days--provided there were no
more attacks, Israel's Army Radio said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Israel said it was willing to extend the permitted
fishing zone off the Gaza coast and to keep open Gaza's Karni
crossing for longer periods to allow more merchandise to pass
through, Army Radio said.</TE>
<TE>   Peres said Israel was willing to do more--and wanted to pull out
from the West Bank--if the attacks end, the radio reports said.</TE>
<TE>   Ben-Ari said the talks would continue in the coming days.</TE>
<TE>   Peres and Palestinian Cabinet ministers had relaunched high-level
meetings in early July, resuming a dialogue that had been stalled for
months.</TE>

<HD>Lawyers Bid for Exhibit A as Evidence Surfaces on EBay</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a heated bidding war on EBay, Mark Lanier recently paid $2,125
to win a 1941 naval machinery manual.</LD>
<LD>   It sounds like a peculiar collecting hobby, but to Lanier it was
serious business. The Houston lawyer, who sues companies on behalf of
asbestos exposure victims, was bidding against a defense lawyer to
get his hands on an evidentiary trophy filled with details on where
and how asbestos was used aboard ships.</LD>
<LD>   EBay may be best known as a place to buy bobblehead dolls, ancient
Roman coins and millions of other idiosyncratic collectibles, but the
world's most famous Internet auction also has become an unlikely
source for legal evidence. It's a place where a growing number of
lawyers bid--often against each other--for everything from
smoking-gun documents to killer products.</LD>
<TE>   While "evidence" is not one of EBay's 18,000 product categories,
lawyers who know what they are looking for can filter 11 million
items by punching in keywords. There are dozens of active "asbestos"
auctions every day. Asbestos lawyers aren't the only ones shopping
for evidence on EBay. A Los Angeles lawyer preparing lawsuits for
lung cancer victims, for instance, recently bought a cache of old
cigarette advertisements that he figures he can use to re-create for
jurors the atmosphere in which his clients got hooked.</TE>
<TE>   EBay is a particularly rich source of evidentiary ephemera for
asbestos litigators, primarily because their sickest clients, those
with an incurable and rare form of cancer, don't develop symptoms
until decades after they were exposed to the hazardous mineral fiber.
A virtual time capsule, EBay holds out a seemingly endless supply of
commercial and household artifacts, historic corporate documents,
maintenance manuals and product catalogs that can help asbestos
lawyers pin down where clients encountered the hazardous
material--and who can be held liable.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no better place to shop and buy real evidence than on
EBay," Lanier said.</TE>
<TE>   EBay's evidence market still is a largely unknown phenomenon. At
the Internet marketplace's headquarters, where the stated mission is
to help "practically anyone trade practically anything on Earth,"
spokesman Kevin Pursglove said he was unaware that EBay had become an
evidence bazaar. Detecting such highly specialized, micro markets "is
a bit of a challenge," he said, with millions of items for sale on
any given day.</TE>
<TE>   It is not widely known within the legal community either. "You can
quote me as saying, 'Wow,' " said Deborah Hensler, a Stanford
University law professor who tracks legal trends.</TE>
<TE>   Surprise aside, Web-trolling for evidence is a logical extension
of lawyers' increasing use of the Internet for everything from
identifying causes of action to publicizing class-action lawsuits,
Hensler said. "Technology is changing the dynamics of litigation."</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Gillers, vice dean of the law school at New York
University, said he expects EBay evidence sleuthing to grow. "Both
the ability to locate evidence and the ability to get it quickly are
valuable to lawyers and their client," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Most asbestos injury cases are settled before reaching a jury
verdict, but lawyers say the evidence they gather online often can
help tip the balance toward a favorable settlement for their clients.</TE>
<TE>   Al Brayton, a Novato personal-injury lawyer, said he first used
EBay to hunt for evidence a couple of years ago when he took on the
case of an Oregon farm wife who was dying of mesothelioma, the rare
cancer caused by asbestos. The only possible source that Brayton
could identify was a hairdryer that the woman had purchased before
the substance was banned for that use in 1980. But his client no
longer had the suspect hairdryer.</TE>
<TE>   Using EBay's "personal shopper" feature, Brayton publicized his
desire to buy a hairdryer identical to the model she remembered
using. "Within four or five hours, I had four responses and bought
three pre-1980 hairdryers," he said. "We found a hairdryer from the
same manufacturer and we were able to settle the case." Brayton said
his staff now searches the Web auction for evidence every couple of
days.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers from the other side of the bar also search for help in
defending companies against allegations of decades-old asbestos use.</TE>
<TE>   "You are talking about activities that occurred 20, 30, 40 years
ago," said Eliot S. Jubelirer, a San Francisco lawyer who represents
corporations. "There's nobody alive today who was in those companies
years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers who frequent EBay evidence auctions say the number of
bidders has grown noticeably over the past 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   "There were not a lot of people bidding on these things early on,
and you could pick things up very reasonably," Brayton said. "Today,
you get not only the plaintiffs' bar bidding, but you have the
defense bar bidding. The prices have gone up a lot in the last year.
A lot."</TE>
<TE>   The escalating prices, particularly for items that contain or
describe the use of asbestos, are drawing more merchandise out of
attics and garages.</TE>
<TE>   "The market has grown dramatically from what it was a year ago,"
Brayton said. "People are now catering to the market and going to
flea markets all over the country and looking for things with
asbestos in them that they can sell."</TE>
<TE>   The creation of such niche markets is one of EBay's most valuable
functions, said Florian Zettelmeyer, an assistant professor of
marketing at UC Berkeley. "What these lawyers have done is tap into
the core strength of the Internet, which is to pull together
suppliers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ernie Chmura, a Chicago-area computer programmer, became a
purveyor of asbestos evidence almost by accident. He initially went
to EBay's Web site last year to sell "three generations of junk" and
his prized electric train collection to help pay for funeral and
medical expenses after his wife died of cancer.</TE>
<TE>   As he searched the Web site to see what similar items were
fetching, he noticed a 1949 plumbing supply catalog, with a section
on asbestos products, that went for $350. Chmura pulled one just like
it out of his late father's attic and put it up for auction. "From a
sales standpoint, only fishing equipment and the book 'Dracula Was a
Woman' were as nutty--way out of expectation," Chmura said.</TE>
<TE>   It's impossible to know how many lawyers are plying EBay for
evidence, but it's hard to believe anyone spends more time--or
money--at this form of discovery than Mark Lanier. The Texas lawyer
paid $1,025 recently to win a 47-year-old pack of sealed cigarettes
believed to have asbestos filters. The 1955 Kent Micronites may
become Exhibit A in litigation he is preparing on behalf of more than
20 clients who have asbestos-related cancer and who smoked the brand.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, he paid $1,325 for a 1951 General Electric Supply
Corp. wiring materials and power apparatus catalog, with pages of
advertisements for asbestos-containing products from elevator control
cables to yarn.</TE>
<TE>   Lanier's most prized EBay purchase is a 1958 draft report of an
asbestos industry-commissioned study that linked asbestos to cancer.
Only 63 copies of the draft were prepared, stamped "restricted" and
numbered, one through 63, so that they could be accounted for as they
were circulated for industry review.</TE>
<TE>   Each copy was to be returned and destroyed. When the study was
published a year later, it said the results showed that asbestos does
not cause cancer, Lanier said. The report was later shown to have
been a lie when the test results came to light and insiders testified
to the falsification of the final report.</TE>
<TE>   But everyone believed that all 63 draft reports had been destroyed
until a couple of years ago when Lanier spotted one while surfing
EBay auctions. He eagerly paid more than $3,000 to obtain it.</TE>
<TE>   "Lo and behold--restricted copy No. 8 was never destroyed," he
said. "I keep it locked up. I have a slipcover on it. I take it to
trial and tell the story like it's the Holy Grail. Then I pull out
the actual restricted copy. It's irreplaceable. It's the only one
that's known in the world."</TE>
<TE>   Lanier has no idea where the document came from. Because buyers
and sellers use handles on EBay, the exchanges can be anonymous.</TE>
<TE>   The "power seller," as EBay describes high-volume vendors,
operates out of Thetford Mines, Canada's asbestos-mining capital, and
uses a cryptic handle. The seller did not respond to e-mail requests
for an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of where it comes from, Lanier said EBay evidence is a
boon to the development of cases. In the days before he discovered
EBay, Lanier would fly a team of investigators to search for
documents in the public libraries in the hometowns of target
companies.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to convince the librarian to take things out of the case
to take photographs and Xeroxes for hard data," Lanier said. "I'll
still do that kind of stuff, but generally what I can get off EBay is
better than what I can find elsewhere. It's a phenomenal thing."</TE>
<TE>   Noticing Lanier's penchant for asbestos items on EBay, an Ohio
engineer offered to sell him a collection that he described as his
personal museum. Lanier paid $5,000 for the collection that includes
household appliances, dozens of samples of different floor and
roofing tiles, a firefighter's uniform, a baseball mitt and even an
action-figure believed to have appeared in the 1960s known as
"Asbestos Man."</TE>
<TE>   "He came with a comic book, where Asbestos Man is the villain
against The Torch, who is in the Fantastic Four," Lanier said.
According to the story line, he said, "the Torch can't burn Asbestos
Man. I looked at it as, much like the tobacco industry, the asbestos
industry [tried] to get even children sensitized to their product. I
was very surprised to see that."</TE>
<TE>   Lanier, who has the items sealed in plexiglass to prevent the
release of hazardous fibers, wastes no time introducing his
collection at trial, often using products as props in a pedagogic
shtick he puts on during his questioning of potential jurors.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll ask jurors, 'Who has worked around asbestos?' and get 20% to
raise hands," he said. "I'll bring 20 to 30 products into the
courtroom [and] then I say where they put this stuff. When I'm done,
100% of the people will realize they've been exposed to asbestos. It
helps the jury understand this is not just an issue for the plaintiff
in this case. But this is really a larger issue that commands
attention."</TE>

<HD>Fed Chief Now Blamed for Inflating Stock Bubble</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Americans desperately seeking to understand what happened to their
once-ballooning investments and retirement nest eggs were offered a
striking answer last week by the nation's premier economic
policymaker.</LD>
<LD>   "Infectious greed" is behind the stock crash and corporate
scandals that are erasing trillions of dollars of paper wealth,
declared Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Otherwise, the
economy is sound, he asserted.</LD>
<LD>   But a growing group of economists and financial players have come
to believe that the economy's troubles go beyond the avarice of a few
executives. Among the principal problems, they say, is Greenspan
himself and the pivotal role he played in feeding a classic
stock-market bubble that began to pop in early 2000.</LD>
<TE>   "Greenspan clearly was the lead character in the drama of the
market's upside, and he's the lead now it's on the downside," said
Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in New York
and one of a small group of analysts who long decried the dangers of
an overheated market.</TE>
<TE>   As scandal has broken over one company after another, sending
stocks tumbling, Americans have been offered the comforting thought
that corporate America's problems--and therefore the economy's--could
at least partly be solved with a few accounting reforms and some jail
time for executive bad actors. Greenspan's prescription was only the
latest version.</TE>
<TE>   What is really underway, analysts say, is the collapse of a
classic stock bubble, in which share prices were driven to
stratospheric heights by the hope of further gain rather than
remaining tethered to something fundamental like a company's profits.</TE>
<TE>   If that is true, the future may require reduced expectations for
millions of Americans who staked their hope for their comfortable
retirement on stocks. The average recovery time--the length of time
it takes the market to return to its boom-time peak--during the big
busts of the 20th century was 20 years. Those declines were 1906,
1929 and the late 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   And, as even President Bush acknowledged in his Saturday radio
address, the effects are likely to reach well beyond retirees. "This
is a crucial moment for the American economy," he said. "Investors
have lost money ... workers have lost jobs and the trust of the
American people has been betrayed."</TE>
<TE>   So who or what was behind the stock bubble?</TE>
<TE>   There was no single cause, but as much as any factor, say
analysts, was Greenspan's increasingly optimistic assessment of the
economy during the late 1990s and especially its high-tech
productivity gains.</TE>
<TE>   "His comments about productivity definitely were fuel for the
bubble," said Gail Dudack, chief investment strategist for SunGard
Institutional Brokerage Inc. in New York. She was among the group of
analysts who warned of the bubble.</TE>
<TE>   A comparison of the Fed chairman's current assessment of the
economy and the markets and his sunny pronouncements at the height of
the 1990s boom suggest that, at a minimum, Greenspan mistook some of
the bubble's effects for evidence of a new economy.</TE>
<TE>   Given his knowledge of economic history and his own repeated
mention of bubbles during the final years of the decade, there is
another possibility as well. That is that Greenspan may have been
aware that a bubble was forming but decided he did not have the
political power to stand in its way. Perhaps he was willing to stand
aside because he was confident that he could guide the economy to a
gentle landing when the bubble popped.</TE>
<TE>   Whichever is closer to the truth, both the country and the central
banker's reputation as an economic manager face a serious challenge
now.</TE>
<TE>   "Central banking was really invented to stand in the way of
excesses, whether it's in the real economy or financial markets,"
said Morgan Stanley's Roach. "In this case, that didn't happen," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Some observers argue that Greenspan can be forgiven for not
wanting to stand in the path of the expanding bubble when even his
mildest, early warnings set off a political hue and cry.</TE>
<TE>   Consider, for instance, his December 1996 "irrational exuberance"
speech, which is remembered as the central bank equivalent of Horatio
at the bridge. In fact, the phrase came on the eighth page of a
10-page speech on the history of central banking in America, and then
only in a question: "How do we know when irrational exuberance has
unduly escalated asset values ... ?" But the words made front-page
news, and the criticism directed at Greenspan was swift and savage.</TE>
<TE>   Or consider the Fed's decision four months later to nudge up
interest rates a modest quarter of a point. "People went wild,"
remembered veteran Fed watcher and economist David M. Jones. "I've
never seen the right and the left of the political spectrum so up in
arms over such a tiny move."</TE>
<TE>   Even if Greenspan knew a bubble was forming, he can also be
forgiven for being confident he could protect the economy from it.</TE>
<TE>   After all, he had already guided the country through the 1987
stock crash and the late 1980s-early 1990s commercial real estate
bust seemingly without a scratch.</TE>
<TE>   What is harder to understand is the lengths to which the Fed
chairman went after the early warnings of 1996 and 1997 to highlight
positive economic developments, especially involving productivity.</TE>
<TE>   What's also hard to understand--or square with his current
assessment--is a slow shift in Greenspan's focus: from embracing the
new economy notion that technology was transforming America, to a
seemingly uncritical defense of sky-high and rising stock prices.</TE>
<TE>   A review of Greenspan's speeches and testimony show that he knew
as early as 1995 that the stock market was changing the economic
landscape.</TE>
<TE>   He warned participants at the annual economic conference in
Jackson Hole, Wyo., that year that old ways of measuring prices and
production no longer worked.</TE>
<TE>   "There are important but extremely difficult questions surrounding
the behavior of [stock] prices" that must be answered before
policymakers can be confident again of their ability to steer the
economy, he said.</TE>
<TE>   There are records showing that, in the fall of 1996 and again in
the spring of 1998, members of the policymaking Federal Open Market
Committee argued for raising interest rates to pop the bubble.</TE>
<TE>   And in a May 1998 interview with Lawrence B. Lindsey, a former Fed
governor who has since become President Bush's chief economic
advisor, Greenspan acknowledged striking parallels between the years
leading up to the 1929 crash and the late 1990s. But he noted
confidently that if actions after the 1929 crash "were taken
differently ... we would not have had the deep fall that we know as
the Great Depression."</TE>
<TE>   Despite all these indications that Greenspan understood the
danger, the Fed chairman seemed to move ever closer to embracing the
wild run-up in stock prices.</TE>
<TE>   When asked, for example, at a January 1999 congressional hearing
how much of the dot-com boom was "based on sound fundamentals and how
much is based on hype," Greenspan snapped, "You wouldn't get hype
working if there weren't something fundamentally, potentially sound
under it."</TE>
<TE>   In a speech a few months later, he suggested that Wall Street
analysts must have known what they were talking about when they
predicted a historically unprecedented 15% annual growth in profits
for the following five years because they were so close to the
companies they covered.</TE>
<TE>   By June 1999, he appeared to have given up any effort to put a
brake on the upward arc of stock prices, arguing, in effect, that
markets know best. To conclude otherwise, he warned a congressional
committee, "requires a judgment that hundreds of thousands of
informed investors have it all wrong."</TE>
<TE>   The Fed chairman's defenders argue he was deterred from acting
against the bubble by the triple whammy of the Asian currency crisis,
Russian debt default and the collapse of hedge-fund giant Long-Term
Capital Management. They point out that within weeks of the June
testimony, the central bank approved the first in a string of
interest rate hikes that brought an end to the great bull market of
the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   But the fact that stocks have continued to tumble and that one
company after another has admitted using shady accounting to prop up
share prices suggests that the Fed's action came too late certainly
to protect investors and, perhaps, to protect the economy as well.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, some analysts worry the central bank's decision to reverse
course last year, driving interest rates to a 40-year low and hold
them there to limit the market damage and cope with fallout from
Sept. 11, could be setting the stage for the next bubble, this one in
housing.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan said recently he does not see a housing bubble in the
works.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1990s, "an irrationally exuberant equity bubble was
... rationalized by a Fed that embraced the new economy with open
arms," Morgan Stanley's Roach recently wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's script seems hauntingly familiar."</TE>
<TE>   An overly long rise in housing prices "is being legitimized as a
sustainable source of economic expansion," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "From bubble to bubble, there seems to be no stopping the follies
and perils of [stock-] and debt-driven economic growth."</TE>

<HD>'Level-Headed' Guys Brave Shark Threat, Currents for City
of Hope</HD>
<DH>Charity: Six-man relay raises $63,360 for pediatric cancer
research. All of the swimmers have been touched by cancer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MILTON CARRERO GALARZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carolyn Suttle could not restrain herself from whistling Saturday
evening when she realized that her 49-year-old husband, Michael, and
five other team swimmers were about to reach the San Clemente Pier
after struggling for 33 hours in the water separating the coast and
an island 60 miles away.</LD>
<LD>   It was about 4:50 p.m. when she first saw Brendan Halffman's arm
emerging from the water and then splashing down again, leaving a
faint trail in the calm ocean waters.</LD>
<LD>   Seven hours after their scheduled arrival time, the team
accomplished its goals: swimming from San Clemente Island to the
coast for what they say is the first time, and raising $63,360 for
pediatric cancer research at the City of Hope.</LD>
<TE>   Although Suttle never doubted that her husband would meet the
challenge, she was apprehensive about weather conditions, the
current, and the idea of his sharing the water in the last legs of
the swim with sharks.</TE>
<TE>   "You always get nervous," she said. "These guys are all pretty
level-headed, but they are contending against Mother Nature."</TE>
<TE>   The team encountered no sharks. Aside from relentless and strong
current near Catalina Island, Mother Nature cooperated. The water was
warmer than normal and nearly flat, which made for a smooth swim. A
group of dolphins escorted the swimmers most of the way.</TE>
<TE>   The team left San Clemente Island at 7:53 a.m. Friday, when Dave
Yudovin, 50, an experienced distance swimmer and cancer survivor, set
off on the team's initial one-hour leg.</TE>
<TE>   Yudovin was followed by Scott Zornig, 42; Halffman, 32, Craig
Taylor, 49; Jim Fitzpatrick, 47, and Suttle.</TE>
<TE>   The most trying hours of the swim came when the team neared Santa
Catalina Island.</TE>
<TE>   They had to swim into a current approaching two knots at sunset
Friday. When the sun rose the next morning, the swimmers discovered
they'd made little headway during the night.</TE>
<TE>   It was the most discouraging part of the swim, Zornig said. Team
members began wondering if the marathon swim was a good idea.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a lot of second thoughts," said Halffman, his legs still
trembling soon after arriving ashore. "Swimming in the middle of the
night is really difficult."</TE>
<TE>   Still, about 5 p.m., when the team finally arrived at the San
Clemente Pier, there were no signs of exhaustion.</TE>
<TE>   The team members, who average just under 45 years, waved at the
welcoming crowd. They thanked the support ship crew for their help,
especially Dr. Gus Gialumas of San Clemente Hospital and Medical
Center, who provided and skippered the support boat.</TE>
<TE>   Zornig highlighted the work of the City of Hope Cancer Center,
which he said helped his wife survive cancer.</TE>
<TE>   All of the swimmers have been touched by cancer directly or
indirectly. Yudovin said he hoped his ability to defeat cancer and
remain an athlete would inspire others.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have something to look forward to, and you make it a
goal, it really helps to deal with an illness."</TE>

<HD>Agencies Struggle to Raze Invasive Cane</HD>
<DH>Conservation: Districts have amassed nearly $25 million to
root out the giant stalks clogging Southland waterways.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The tractor thrashes through a 40-foot-high wall of jungle, biting
off hunks of tangled grasses and spitting them out onto the parched
earth.</LD>
<LD>   The work along the bone-dry San Jacinto River in western Riverside
County is just one piece of the battle to eradicate a fast-growing
invader known as Arundo donax. The giant cane is so thirsty that it
is sucking the life out of Southern California waterways.</LD>
<LD>   The world's largest member of the grass family, arundo can grow a
foot a day. An acre of it swallows enough water to sustain 10
California households for a year.</LD>
<TE>   "It's kind of unstoppable," said Kyle Washburn, who walked ahead
of the tractor, hacking at the nearly impenetrable foliage with a
machete to uncover abandoned cars or other large objects buried in
it.</TE>
<TE>   Worthy of a role in "Little Shop of Horrors," the oversized reed
has taken over 20,000 acres of riverbed in three Southern California
counties. Nearly every river in the Los Angeles Basin now has some
giant cane, experts say, and it has been spotted as far north as
Willamette, Ore., and as far east as New Or- leans.</TE>
<TE>   The plant illustrates vividly how a nonnative species transplanted
to new territory with no natural enemies can run amok. Cut it down,
and new shoots spring up. Let it dry out, and it becomes a superb
fire carrier.</TE>
<TE>   Dense dry stands caught fire in the Santa Ana riverbed in a San
Bernardino suburb last week, one of numerous river blazes regularly
fueled by the cane.</TE>
<TE>   During El Nino storms in the early 1990s, a mass of arundo that
had been uprooted and washed downstream by flood waters piled up
against a bridge between Corona and Norco. It lifted the bridge 18
inches off its struts, forcing it to close and preventing ambulances
from reaching emergency rooms on the other side.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing I can compare it to is cancer. It spreads so fast,
and it won't let anything else live in its midst," said Kerwin
Russell, an environmental horticulturist with the Riverside Corona
regional conservation district. Russell has spent nine years fighting
giant cane, and says he will retire before the war is won.</TE>
<TE>   Accounts of the plant's history and how it first arrived on
American soil vary. A native of the Mediterranean and possibly parts
of India, it has been around for at least 5,000 years.</TE>
<TE>   The Bible mentions it and it is the likely source of the Pan's
pipe of Greek myth, say researchers at the U.S. Department of
Agriculture and UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   The cane, with its firm, straight structure, is still considered
the best material available for clarinets and other reed instruments.
However, efforts to harvest the plant commercially for musical
instruments or paper have all failed in California, said Paul
Frandsen, head of Riverside County's parks, who has been dubbed "Mr.
Arundo" for his unflagging crusade to eliminate the plant.</TE>
<TE>   Frandsen said Spanish settlers used it as a building material for
California's missions.</TE>
<TE>   But it wasn't until the federal government began planting arundo
along riverbanks in the 1960s to control erosion that the cane began
its rampant colonization.</TE>
<TE>   "They had the right idea, but they put it near water," Russell
said. "It loves water, and it has no natural enemies here.</TE>
<TE>   "I suspected it was a drinker, and it is," said Frandsen, who
commissioned a UC Riverside study in the early '90s that showed the
plant consumes more than three times as much water as native plants.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Ana River has been hardest hit. The river runs 100 miles
from the San Bernardino mountains through Riverside to Huntington
Beach. At numerous points, the cane fills the river from bank to
bank.</TE>
<TE>   Arundo is so all-consuming that it has changed the ecology of much
of the Santa Ana River, said Dick Zembal, a longtime biologist with
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service who now is natural resources
manager for the Orange County Water District.</TE>
<TE>   Zembal explained that, for thousands of years, a multitude of
creatures evolved in tune with the river's seasonal floods and dry
spells. In just a few decades, arundo and other fire-resistant
species have taken over, he said, replacing much of the river's plant
and animal life.</TE>
<TE>   While the stalks burn fiercely, the plant's massive underground
root system allows it to re-sprout overnight.</TE>
<TE>   "The roots act like a belly, or a gas tank--they store water and
nutrients that the plant can just live off of, even in dry years,"
Russell said.</TE>
<TE>   At least a dozen threatened or endangered songbirds, toads and
other species that are unable to cope with fire have been pushed out.</TE>
<TE>   Five water districts and an array of conservation districts--all
members of "Team Arundo"--have gradually amassed nearly $25 million
to root out the pernicious plant from the river.</TE>
<TE>   An eradication campaign began in earnest in 1992 at the river's
headwaters, and is moving slowly downstream. Crews work by hand with
chain saws and buckets of pesticide, and sometimes with specially
fitted tractors.</TE>
<TE>   In the last 10 years, about 1,000 acres has been painstakingly
cleared--one-twentieth of the total infested acreage in the
watershed.</TE>
<TE>   Once they are bulldozed or ripped out, the stalks must also be
shredded, because one green shoot stuck in damp earth can sprout
again. The underground root system must also be eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   "This is about three weeks worth of growth," said Russell,
standing under seven-foot-high stalks that have grown anew in the
tractor's wake.</TE>
<TE>   Biologists say pesticides must be used to ensure that the plants
die. An herbicide called Rodeo, recently renamed Aquamaster, that is
approved by the Environmental Protection Agency, is applied. The
herbicide contains a moderately toxic ingredient, glyphosate, that
can be harmful to fish and birds. Studies by UC Berkeley researchers
in the early 1990s also found that glyphosate, if inhaled, caused
illness in some people who worked near it.</TE>
<TE>   Once the cane is conquered, native plants and animals quickly
return, Frandsen said. Songbird counts are increasing rapidly near
Riverside's Van Buren Avenue bridge, site of one of the first arundo
removal programs.</TE>
<TE>   There are stumbling blocks. For instance, some large nurseries
still sell the plant.</TE>
<TE>   A number of residents in rural Silverado Canyon at Orange County's
eastern edge don't like the herbicides and worry that, if the
erosion-resistant plants are ripped out, their homes might fall into
the creek.</TE>
<TE>   "The offending reed is not a 'native.' Well, neither am I, nor my
septic line, nor my electricity lines," wrote Cybele Rowe in a
community newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Rowe, who lives 30 feet from Silverado Creek above a bank of the
giant cane, said it would cost her thousands to obtain permits to
build a retaining wall instead.</TE>
<TE>   "I came to America to be free," said Rowe, a native of Australia.
"They can go for it, knock themselves out [taking out the plant].
It's just not necessary on my property."</TE>
<TE>   Russell disagreed, saying if a stand is left in one spot, it can
quickly spread downstream. He said conservation districts may provide
native replacement plants for free.</TE>
<TE>   Other residents can't wait for the work crews to arrive.</TE>
<TE>   Bonnie Smith, owner of Bonnie's Gardens and a longtime resident of
rural Modjeska Canyon, said community cane clearance programs hadn't
worked in the past.</TE>
<TE>   "You chop it down, and it just grows right back," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Those who have worked for years to bring attention to the arundo
threat are optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   From firefighters and developers to members of Congress, a wide
array of interests has gradually joined the fight.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest boost of all may be $20 million worth of park bond
money set aside for restoration of the Santa Ana River--most of it
for elimination of the giant cane. By 2020, its enemies predict,
they'll have licked the last of it.</TE>
<TE>   "We will reach the sea," said Zembal of the Orange County water
district.</TE>

<HD>Conservancy Taking Habitat Under Its Wing</HD>
<DH>Open space: State coastal agency plans to use part of $490
million in bond funds to buy and preserve important wetlands.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than any other agency, the state Coastal Conservancy has emerged
as a force in Ventura County's environmental preservation movement--a
big spender with big plans that are quickly becoming reality.</LD>
<LD>   After years of preparation, the conservancy has received a
$490-million windfall from California voters through two huge
parkland bond measures passed since 2000. And it plans to spend a
sizable chunk of that to preserve or restore Ventura County wildlife
habitat.</LD>
<LD>   The conservancy has already committed $32 million to buy more than
1,400 acres of prime coastal and riverside property in the county,
and expects to spend tens of millions more to preserve thousands more
acres.</LD>
<TE>   Conservancy officials say semirural Ventura County--pressed
between the Los Angeles megalopolis and rugged wilderness areas--has
become a high priority because it still has so much to save and so
little time to save it.</TE>
<TE>   "Ventura's at a critical threshold: It has this window of
opportunity where it can save its natural and recreational resources
before they're overwhelmed by forces from outside," said Peter Brand,
the conservancy's local point man. "The threat is there and the
resources are there. When you combine those two elements, it looks
like this is the place to spend a healthy amount of our [money] right
now."</TE>
<TE>   Among the conservancy's primary targets for acquisition are the
banks of Southern California's last free-flowing river, the Santa
Clara, and one of the region's few remaining large wetlands on the
ocean, Ormond Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Both the river and the wetlands are sanctuaries for threatened and
endangered birds and fish. Ormond is recognized by the American Bird
Conservancy as a "continentally important bird area" because it is a
breeding ground for California least terns and provides habitat for
coastal Western snowy plovers.</TE>
<TE>   The Coastal Conservancy has also focused on contributing to the
possible demolition of silt-filled Matilija Dam to restore the
Ventura River to an unobstructed channel, allowing steelhead trout to
spawn.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, Ventura County is one of the prime coastal areas that
still has open land available for purchase," said conservancy board
member and Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara). "Los
Angeles and other areas in the region are so heavily developed that
their ecosystems have been devastated. In our area, we can still
restore the habitat cost-efficiently."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said she would not be surprised if the conservancy
eventually spends $100 million in Ventura County. "It sounds like a
lot, but when you consider the cost of land and restoration projects,
it's not."</TE>
<TE>   In a broader context, the Coastal Conservancy is playing a key
role in an anti-sprawl movement that has dominated Ventura County
politics for nearly a decade.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1995, residents in every major local city have
overwhelmingly approved Save Open Space and Agricultural Resources
measures intended to restrict urban expansion by requiring voters to
ratify any new project outside municipal boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1998 advisory ballot, 68% of county voters supported creation
of an open space district to buy farm and ecologically valuable
lands. The Ventura County Board of Supervisors agreed this year to
put the issue to voters as a binding proposition in 2004. A committee
is now deciding the wording of the ballot measure and the size of a
tax to support the district.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the Coastal Conservancy is buying land, some of
which it hopes to eventually turn over to the open space district or
other trusts so that they could assume responsibility for its
maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   "The Coastal Conservancy has been invaluable in launching us to
the next level," said county Supervisor Steve Bennett, co-author of
the SOAR laws. "We started with [anti-sprawl] regulation and now we
have to be thinking about permanent protection."</TE>
<TE>   That has always been the plan, Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   "When we had the SOAR campaign going forward, we were told that if
the citizens of Ventura voted for regulations to stop urban sprawl,
it would make the Coastal Conservancy more interested in investing
dollars here," Bennett said. "Peter Brand said they were pretty good
with coming up with money if they had viable organizations to turn
the lands over to."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, following Brand's lead in Ventura County, the conservancy
started spending money even before it had much. With annual budgets
of only about $10 million in the mid-1990s, the conservancy provided
funds for coastal access reports and a study on the value of the
farming industry in Ventura County and put up $300,000 in seed money
for a fledgling farmland trust.</TE>
<TE>   It also conducted detailed studies of Ventura County's principal
river watersheds--the Santa Clara and Ventura rivers and, in the east
county, the Calleguas and Conejo creeks. So when the bond money began
to flow two years ago, the Ventura projects were lined up for
consideration.</TE>
<TE>   "In Ventura County, the projects presented have been extremely
well-defined and well-organized," Jackson said. "That's critical,
because there are hundreds of projects presented to the conservancy.
The ones here demonstrated the best bang for the buck."</TE>
<TE>   So far, the conservancy's biggest commitments have been $9.7
million for about 270 acres at Ormond Beach and $6.6 million for 10
properties along a 15-mile stretch of the Santa Clara River.</TE>
<TE>   The Ormond Beach deal, completed last month, was probably the most
complicated.</TE>
<TE>   The seller, Southern California Edison, refused to clean up
possible contamination on the site, which had housed fuel tanks
serving a power plant. If the conservancy had balked, a competing
bidder, Occidental Petroleum Corp., stood ready to acquire the land
for a $250-million energy facility.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in awe," said Russ Baggerly, president of the Environmental
Coalition of Ventura County. "I thought we'd be fighting for Ormond
Beach for the rest of our lives."</TE>
<TE>   Baggerly noted, however, that about 400 more acres must be
purchased at Ormond to make it a sustainable wetlands outside the
reach of development.</TE>
<TE>   Brand said he hopes to reach agreement to buy about 300 of those
acres from the city of Oxnard and the Metropolitan Water District
within a few weeks. Then he wants to buy adjacent land from a farmer
to complete an ecosystem that includes a stopover for birds on the
Pacific flyway and a sand-dune habitat for insects, amphibians, birds
and mammals.</TE>
<TE>   The goals of the Santa Clara River Parkway are also only partly
realized, with about 1,100 acres purchased out of 6,400. The
ambitious plan would establish wildlife and nature preserves by
separating stream-loving plants and animals from urban areas.</TE>
<TE>   The Nature Conservancy, the largest nonprofit environmental
organization in the country, is a partner with the Coastal
Conservancy on the Santa Clara project--using state grants to execute
individual purchases.</TE>
<TE>   "The Nature Conservancy feels that the Santa Clara River is
extremely valuable," said E.J. Remson, director of the Los
Angeles-Ventura Project for the group. "A number of threatened and
endangered species need that river to survive."</TE>
<TE>   But if the efforts of the Coastal Conservancy are widely admired,
planning expert William Fulton said work still needs to be done to
pull together the parts of the local preservation movement.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we've done a great job locally in leveraging this
interest by the Coastal Conservancy," he said. "I don't think we've
figured out how it all fits together. We've focused on building our
SOAR boundaries, but we haven't done much to understand the
interconnectedness of the rural and the urban."</TE>
<TE>   An example, he said, is the lack of discussion about the
environmental effects of a huge new housing project for the hills
above Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a typical Ventura County problem," Fulton said. "We all
think X or Y or Z is important, but we don't talk to each other about
it."</TE>

<HD>Warning Children: a Delicate Balance</HD>
<DH>Reaction: Since Runnion slaying, parents have been more
watchful and tried to offer stern advice without being paranoid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE CHAVEZ and MILTON CARRERO GALARZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For parents of children small enough to be carried away against their
will, these past days have been a time for holding hands a bit
tighter, turning casual supervision into constant vigilance and
grappling with ways to gently explain a horror story.</LD>
<LD>   Talk to most parents or their children Saturday--at swim lessons,
at the park, at a birthday party, at home--and it's as if a phantom
had followed them on their normal routines, putting them on guard,
invading their thoughts.</LD>
<LD>   "My heart is twisted," said Liliana Florido, an Anaheim mother of
a 10-year-old girl.</LD>
<TE>   "It clenches you up. I feel nauseated when I think about it," said
Consuelo Brennan, 36, a Burbank mother of a 2-year-old boy.</TE>
<TE>   "It could have been my little girl," said Gary Byrne, the Alhambra
father of 4-year-old Janelle.</TE>
<TE>   Then talk to children, and eyes open wide with concern. For them,
this has been a week of sternly worded admonitions and mean-man
role-playing. Never fall for the lost puppy routine. If a stranger
tries to take you away, what do you do?</TE>
<TE>   "Scratch, scream, try to get away," said Elianna Florido, who has
been so upset by the slaying that she and her mother went to the
Stanton kidnapping site Saturday to leave a condolence card. Liliana
said her daughter is old enough to understand the news, but young
enough to have cried in fear on and off all week.</TE>
<TE>   "I think somebody is going to come up and steal me," Elianna said,
as she gripped her mother's hand and placed a card on one of 11
makeshift memorial tables outside the Runnion family home.</TE>
<TE>   "It told her mom that I feel very, very sorry for her, and my
family is praying for them," Elianna said.</TE>
<TE>   Danyelle Vasquez of Rancho Cucamonga, 12, said she decided to
avoid meeting with her friends in the frontyard and instead retreat
to the safety of her backyard.</TE>
<TE>   Samantha's body was found Tuesday near a mountain road west of
Lake Elsinore, the city where Alejandro Avila, 27, the man suspected
of killing her, was arrested Friday. The case has drawn national
media attention, and authorities received more than 2,000 tips.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been scared," Danyelle said. "I wanted to sleep in [her
parents'] bed."</TE>
<TE>   Vigilance became a full-time job last week.</TE>
<TE>   "Just stay there, honey. Stay there. Don't go anywhere else. I
need to see you," shouted Jeanette Guerrero, 37, to her 7-year-old
son, who was attending a birthday party Saturday at Griffith Park.</TE>
<TE>   Hers was a common plea, typical of the instructions doled out to a
child in the course of a day. But Saturday, Guerrero said, her orders
felt more profound.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a case that hit home," the Diamond Bar mother of two
said. "The more you heard about it, the sadder and more cautious you
became."</TE>
<TE>   She and her husband decided to buy a Sony PlayStation just to keep
the children occupied when the couple can't be outside to watch
afternoon play.</TE>
<TE>   Overnight, the frontyard seems to have become a kind of danger
zone for children, a place where only supervised play time is
allowed--a responsibility that can stretch into hours during warm
summer evenings.</TE>
<TE>   "Dinner is just going to have to be late, the housework is going
to have to be neglected," said Claudia Soto, 29, of Compton. The
mother of three children, 11, 7 and 4 months, gathered the two eldest
early in the week to gently explain what happened to Samantha.</TE>
<TE>   Although she usually shields her children from the crime stories
of the day, this was one event that she said she didn't have the
luxury to ignore. "It was my responsibility to let them know what can
happen," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Soto, like others, calmly, matter-of-factly told the story of the
"very mean man" who hurt a little girl, who is now up in heaven. The
moral: Stay close to your parents; listen to what they say.</TE>
<TE>   At Mayo Elementary School, where she is a parent advocate teaching
English and other parenting classes, Soto said parents met last week
to organize adult-supervised "walking home" groups.</TE>
<TE>   "As parents, we said it is our responsibility to make sure no
child walks alone," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Nitza Becerra, 26, of Gardena also decided to tell her girls, 5
and 8, that the Stanton girl had died after being hurt, to drive home
the seriousness of the lesson at hand. Her oldest had seen the story
on television and asked what happened to Samantha.</TE>
<TE>   Amber, 8, "was surprised and gave me that oh-my-God kind of look.
She understands death," said Becerra, who followed up with an
explanation of rules. "I know she just didn't blow this one off. The
way she looked at me, I knew she understood this."</TE>
<TE>   It's the difficult balance between caution and paranoia that many
parents said they grappled with. How much do children really need to
know about sexual predators?</TE>
<TE>   Nothing. That's what Scott and Linda Folsom of Mount Washington
decided. They don't watch the evening news because it's too
sensational, they said. And their 11-year-old daughter knew little,
if any, details of the killing.</TE>
<TE>   Explaining the crime to an older child, they said, would have
meant delving into details they felt were inappropriate.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to have to explain about rape," Scott Folsom said.
"I just didn't see a whole lot of benefit to her at this point in her
life."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Linda, a production executive at Disney, said work
conversations last week were dominated by Samantha's fate. Parents,
grandparents, anyone close to a child, she said, felt violated as
they tried to fathom the cruelty of the crime.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no possible explanation that man could have that would
cause him to be forgiven for what he did, making a child suffer like
that," Linda Folsom said.</TE>
<TE>   Avila's arrest did little to ease the minds of some worried
parents, who, while comforting their children, protected them from
the truth that made their hearts quake.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing is, I know that this isn't the only guy like this
around," Byrne said as he guided his 4-year-old daughter to her swim
lesson. "Kids change your life so much, and then it is so scary to
think of how quickly they can be taken from you.... It's hard. It's
hard."</TE>

<HD>Teens Get a Second Chance at Literacy</HD>
<DH>Education: L.A. Unified begins a back-to-basics reading
program for secondary students. The effort is being watched by
districts nationwide.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUKE HELFAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Unified School District is embarking this month on a
remedial reading program for 35,000 middle school and high school
students who lack skills they should have learned by second or third
grade.</LD>
<LD>   Educators across the country say the initiative is unusual for its
focus on teenagers instead of elementary students, and for the sheer
number of youngsters involved. Its success or failure, they add,
could set the agenda for other big city school systems.</LD>
<LD>   At all 123 secondary campuses in the Los Angeles district, the
worst readers in sixth through ninth grades are forgoing electives
such as music and art to attend mandatory classes as much as two
hours a day that stress the phonics usually taught to 6-year-olds.</LD>
<TE>   English teachers--some reluctantly, others enthusiastically--are
shelving classics such as "Romeo and Juliet" for rudimentary
storybooks with big pictures, large print and sentences as simple as
"Dad had a sad lad." As the students master such materials in what is
called the "Language!" program, their lessons grow more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Unified leaders say the back-to-basics
intervention--which will cost $16 million this year--is necessary
because tens of thousands of students drop out or graduate without
the skills to succeed in college or get good jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Many students, at least during its early phases, say they dislike
the program and are embarrassed to be in the classes, which they
think of as special education.</TE>
<TE>   "People think you're dumb. It's little kids' stuff," Delfina
Terrazas, a ninth-grader at Jefferson High School, said after she
practiced the alphabet on flash cards.</TE>
<TE>   When 13-year-old Damian Polk was asked to sound out "cat, hat and
bat" during the first week of classes at John Muir Middle School, the
eighth-grader blurted out: "Are we retarded?"</TE>
<TE>   "Of course you're not retarded," the teacher, Susan Glazebrook
assured Damian and his classmates. But she told them that they needed
help: They had landed in the class because of their low reading
scores on the Stanford 9 exam.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's secondary schools are filled with struggling readers
like those in Glazebrook's class. These students' academic problems
often have been overlooked as attention and money focused in recent
years on reforms at the elementary level, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Teenage illiteracy is now attracting broader attention. The Bush
administration will convene a meeting of researchers and teachers
this fall to examine the best ways of improving reading beyond the
fourth grade. The gathering, sponsored by the U.S. Department of
Education, is expected to examine the Los Angeles program.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to look at this closely," Assistant U.S. Secretary of
Education Susan B. Neuman said. "I am very enthusiastic about any
kind of intervention that squarely takes on this huge problem."</TE>
<TE>   Gerald N. Tirozzi, executive director of the National Assn. of
Secondary School Principals, agreed. "What Los Angeles is doing is
light years ahead of what most districts are doing," he said. "I give
them huge kudos."</TE>
<TE>   The magnitude of adolescent illiteracy in Los Angeles was
demonstrated earlier this year when the district tried to establish
qualifications for enrollment in the new classes. District officials
targeted the 67,000 students entering sixth through ninth grades who
scored in or below the 20th percentile in reading on the Stanford
9--those in the bottom fifth.</TE>
<TE>   About half that number were taken off the list, either because
they had passed a separate third-grade reading test or because they
were still learning English and qualified for another intervention
program. That left the 35,000 who will spend the next two years
learning how to read all over again.</TE>
<TE>   The phonetic exercises that start this month with the most basic
lessons linking sounds and letters will gradually take on more
complex and challenging material as students tackle grammar, learn to
write essays and study methods to improve their comprehension.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Unified is using state and federal money for teachers,
their training and new books. Those funds could have gone to other
programs, but the remedial classes are a priority for district Supt.
Roy Romer.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to force something to happen for these low-performing
youngsters," he said. "I'm sick at heart that we have kids in
secondary schools who carry around books they can't read."</TE>
<TE>   The intervention comes at an urgent moment for many students.</TE>
<TE>   Starting with this year's 11th-graders, high school students in
California must pass a rigorous "exit exam" to earn diplomas. Los
Angeles Unified students performed dismally on a trial run last year:
Just 44% of ninth-graders who voluntarily took the test passed the
language arts section. Statewide, 64% of ninth-graders passed.</TE>
<TE>   District officials say they expect slow but steady progress in the
remedial classes, which have as few as 20 students, compared with 35
or more in other English classes. The lessons also are twice as long
as those for other classes.</TE>
<TE>   But even with intensive help, students may never fully make up
their missed vocabulary or learn all the history, science and math
they missed because of poor reading skills, teachers say.</TE>
<TE>   "We have so many kids at such a low level that they may never
catch up," said Kristin Szilagyi, the English department chairwoman
at Marshall High School in Los Feliz. "We have to do something for
them. I hope this is the curriculum that will produce quick results."</TE>
<TE>   The remedial classes are placing new--and sometimes
unwelcome--demands on English teachers, who must abandon much of the
literature they once taught and be retrained to lead elementary
school-style lessons. Some criticize the new phonetic materials,
calling them "gibberish" and "garbage."</TE>
<TE>   But others say they are keeping an open mind. "At first, my ego
got in the way. It said, 'C'mon, what am I doing here?' " said Levi
Stanton Frisk, an English teacher at Van Nuys High School who is
teaching two remedial classes. "But at the same time I saw the need
for this type of program. And I'm happy to fill it. I can see this is
going to work. I believe in it."</TE>
<TE>   Standing at the front of his classroom at 7:30 a.m., Frisk
launched into a lesson that focused on six consonants and one
vowel--B, T, S, C, M, F and A.</TE>
<TE>   "Say sat," Frisk told his ninth-graders.</TE>
<TE>   "Sat," they responded.</TE>
<TE>   "Say the sounds in sat," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "S-s-a-a-t-t," they chanted.</TE>
<TE>   A couple students yawned. One girl rolled her eyes. But most paid
attention and played along as they used hand gestures suggested by
the program to reinforce each letter. Then Frisk had the students
create new words by changing the first letters--for example, turning
"sat" into "fat." The class finished with timed tests. The students
took turns in pairs, reading as many words as possible in one minute
from lists of 100 that included at, bat, sat and Sam.</TE>
<TE>   Cynthia Marron correctly read 74 out of 79 words in one minute.
But the exercise left her frustrated. "All the words look the same to
me. They're confusing," the 14-year-old said. "They all have A in
them." On her second try, Cynthia got 97 out of 100 correct. Then she
said: "It's too easy. I don't consider myself a fast reader, but I
can read."</TE>
<TE>   Frisk has been pleased with the progress he has seen in just three
weeks. "This has to work," he said. "For many of them, it's their
last chance."</TE>
<TE>   Parents have the right to refuse their child's enrollment in the
classes. So far, none has objected, district officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Donjae White is a somewhat reluctant student at John Muir Middle
School, putting his head down during his remedial class. But his
mother, Mary Willford, is pleased that he's learning phonics over
again. Willford said she already sees a difference at home--Donjae
uses new words. "It's a very good thing. I say it enhances the skills
in his life," she said. "I want him to do well in school and graduate
from each grade and go to college. It's very important to me."</TE>
<TE>   About 2,000 schools nationwide are using the "Language!"
curriculum for their poor readers. But Los Angeles Unified's is by
far the largest and most ambitious effort, officials said. Experts
wonder if the school district can succeed on such a large scale and
with so many teachers of varying experience. Others question whether
the "Language!" program is the solution.</TE>
<TE>   "Phonics is misdirected and will bore the students," said James
McPartland, a researcher at Johns Hopkins University. "Almost every
child of that age can sound out words. The real way to deal with this
is real reading in real books, not exercises on handout sheets."</TE>
<TE>   The Sacramento City Unified School District began remedial reading
programs in its secondary schools five years ago. Today, its eight
middle schools and five high schools all have such classes, serving
about 10% of 14,000 secondary students. "We are sending many fewer
kids to high school with serious reading problems," said Kathi
Cooper, assistant superintendent of instruction. "We have seen enough
growth to keep at it."</TE>
<TE>   A handful of Los Angeles schools, including Jefferson High, began
the remedial "Language!" classes last year on their own.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's Jefferson ninth-graders resisted, as their peers
elsewhere are doing this year. The Jefferson students were
embarrassed. They were bored. But they stuck it out and say it
helped. "Now I know my nouns, my verbs, my adjectives," said Clara
Cuezzy, who is a Jefferson 10th-grader. "My spelling is so much
improved."</TE>
<TE>   Clara's friend, Martin Calzada, used to ditch school because he
couldn't keep up in his classes. Now he opens his backpack and shows
off a fiction book about fugitive slaves he is reading--at home. "I
used to hate reading," he said. "Now it's like my favorite thing."</TE>

<HD>Taking It All in Stride</HD>
<DH>The sharp stock market decline of the last two years has
Americans concerned about their retirement savings. But patient
investors from Southern California and across the country are
confident Wall Street will rebound from a Great Bear Market that will
not seem to end.</DH>

<LD>Bob Adams, 69, retired five years ago after a career in radio
broadcasting and later, community college teaching. With most of his
retirement savings tied up in the market, Friday's 390-point drop got
his attention.</LD>
<LD>   ''This one is a real knot in the stomach," he said. ''Anytime you
have that kind of a drop, especially in light of the market this
year, it's worrisome, of course. I'm basically waiting. I told my
wife the other day that we better select a brand of beans that we're
going to eat for a while."</LD>
<LD>   Still, Adams is philosophical. ''I'll put it this way: There are
two things you have to have in order to invest in the market. You
either have to have a lot of time or you have to have a lot of money.
In both instances, an event such as what we've gone through this year
isn't going to bother you very much. Because if it's the difference
between having a million dollars or 3 million, so what? Or if you
have lost half of your value but you're young enough that you don't
have to use it right away, then again, it's not a big deal if you can
build some confidence that the market will respond at some point. And
it always has.... This is a great country we live in."</LD>
<TE>   But with 85% of his retirement savings in the market, ''I'm
watching ... I pray a lot," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, investing on his own over the last 10 years (he used a
broker for 10 years before that), Adams figures he has bettered the
market every year for the last 11 years. ''I look for growth
companies. I look at the history of a company and gauge from its
history what it's likely to do in the next five years and make some
decisions based on the historical values of the company."</TE>
<TE>   Adams avoided big losses on the Nasdaq by avoiding companies--the
dot-coms, telecoms--he saw as overpriced.</TE>
<TE>   ''I've lost money over the course of a year, but if the market is
down 10%, I'm down 5%," he said.</TE>
<TE>   ''This is a learning experience. We've been through '87, when the
market dropped so much in a single day, I can remember watching the
experts on 'Wall Street Week' and they looked like deer in the
headlights. They looked scared to death.... [I]t didn't bother me
that much. I knew the market would come back, and it did.</TE>
<TE>   ''We're not going to go back to into ... 20%-plus growth rate
again, I'm sure, but the market will return to its normal 12%
growth."</TE>

<LD>Former U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno revved up her campaign supporters

the skit, and supporters say it shows she is down to earth.</LD>
<LD>   Reno is seeking to unseat Republican Gov. Jeb Bush. Polls show her
trailing him by double digits.</LD>

<LD>A Roman Catholic priest who was accused of molesting two women has
sued the Archdiocese of Miami for ruining his reputation by
publicizing the allegations.</LD>
<LD>   Father Jan Malicki was sued in 1998 for alleged molestations at
St. David Catholic Church in Davie. The archdiocese suspended
Malicki, but prosecutors never filed charges because they thought
they couldn't get a conviction.</LD>
<LD>   Malicki said in his suit that the archdiocese authorized a church
tribunal to review accusations against him in 1998, then held a news
conference to announce Malicki was under investigation.</LD>

<HD>Bush to Press Congress on Economic Plan</HD>
<DH>Politics: As the public's mood sours over the plunging
stock market, the White House shifts strategy with an eye on the
midterm elections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Faced with a plunging stock market, a souring mood among voters and
anxious cries from his fellow Republicans, President Bush has decided
not to push forward new policy proposals but to "ramp up the focus on
Congress" to complete action on corporate reform legislation and
approve key elements of his economic agenda.</LD>
<LD>   A day after the Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 400
points to a four-year low, a senior White House official said
Saturday that Bush's economic strategy for the immediate future is to
take advantage of a president's ability to make his voice heard above
the competition.</LD>
<LD>   "History shows when presidents focus on solutions, Congress tends
to tie itself in knots by getting down in the weeds," the White House
official said. "Congress has an uphill battle when it comes to
communicating with America."</LD>
<TE>   Accordingly, Bush will focus his energies this week on pressing
Senate and House negotiators to move faster on corporate accounting
reforms and the House to complete action on the new Department of
Homeland Security. He will also sign a supplemental appropriation
bill that should pump more money into the economy.</TE>
<TE>   The emerging Democratic strategy, which will carry forward to the
fall elections, when Democratic control of the Senate and GOP
dominance in the House are on the line, is to tie the economy's
troubles to corporate misconduct and then to tie Bush and
congressional Republicans to big business.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, in his radio address Saturday, previewed the Republican
response: While trying to identify himself with the cause of
corporate reform, he pointed a finger at Congress for failing to
provide him enhanced authority to negotiate trade deals and to
control spending, which he said threatens a "decade of deficits."</TE>
<TE>   "As Congress approaches the August recess," Bush insisted, "it
must take decisive steps to provide economic security to the American
people."</TE>
<TE>   Substantively, the White House believes, at least for now, that
the president has done all he can, or needs to do, to stem the stock
market decline.</TE>
<TE>   Rhetorically, however, Bush is casting himself as a leading
proponent of corporate reform. And the White House has sidestepped
questions about how far the president would move toward the
Democratic Senate's version of corporate accounting reform, which is
seen as tougher than Bush's.</TE>
<TE>   The White House will say only that Bush and Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes
(D-Md.) share many goals and that the president will wait to see what
emerges from the conference committee that is trying to reconcile the
House and Senate bills.</TE>
<TE>   While leaving the door open on tougher corporate reform, the White
House continues to resist GOP suggestions to shake up the
administration's economic team. Even some Republicans are telling
Bush he could bolster consumer confidence and the market by getting
get rid of Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Securities and
Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt. Bush and his aides say they
remain firmly behind both men.</TE>
<TE>   The White House drive to focus public attention on Congress is
meant to send the message that, while Bush is standing pat on policy
and personnel, he is not insensitive to the pain and apprehension of
voters.</TE>
<TE>   "From a political point of view, he needs to be out there, show
empathy, convey an impression he is in charge," political consultant
Stuart Rothenberg said. "A lot of times in politics, politicians just
have to hold on and ride out the storm."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mood Grows Gloomy</TE>
<TE>   The backdrop for this maneuvering is a sharp deterioration in the
country's mood. While Bush's job approval rating has remained high,
the share of Americans who say the country is on the right track has
plummeted with the stock market.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a lack of a sense of security that is turning people into a
foul mood," says independent pollster John Zogby.</TE>
<TE>   This widening unease may be changing the landscape for the midterm
elections in November. For months, Republicans have hoped Bush's
astronomical approval ratings would boost their prospects. Now there
is growing concern that anxiety about the country's direction may
prove a more decisive factor in the election--and slowly erode Bush's
strong support as well.</TE>
<TE>   "Privately, Republican consultants are a little worried. Polls
tend to lag," conservative analyst William Kristol said, but he
predicted the tide will turn.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now we're in the panic mode where everyone wants to be
tough. I predict there will be a moment in the next week or two where
the president turns on the Democrats for being too indiscriminate in
attacking business," Kristol said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet if optimism about the country's direction continues to fall,
"then inevitably Bush is going to fall with it," says Republican
pollster Bill McInturff.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with that prospect, Republicans appear to have decided that
the best defense is a good offense. Over the last few days, key GOP
leaders have escalated criticism of congressional Democrats for
blocking key elements of Bush's agenda.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Republican National Committee Chairman Marc Racicot
told a party meeting in San Francisco: "It seems to me that the
Democrats are so eager to win at virtually any cost that they aren't
really interested in helping the economy grow ... because they feel
they can win if the economy is disrupted."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Democrats Lack a Plan</TE>
<TE>   The Republican focus on the White House economic agenda may
highlight the weakest link in the Democratic argument for the midterm
elections: their lack of a competing economic plan. Democrats are
accusing Bush of mismanaging the economy and blaming his
$1.35-trillion, 10-year tax cut for the return of federal deficits.
On Saturday, Al Gore, Bush's rival in the 2000 presidential election,
compared the administration's handling of the economy to business
decisions that led to the collapse of Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to lead to bigger deficits than when the first Bush"
was in the White House, the former vice president said.</TE>
<TE>   But Democrats have not advanced an alternative plan to revive the
economy or eliminate the deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than sending a broad economic message, Democrats are
focusing on the corporate scandals. "Voters draw very much of a
straight line from what is happening at WorldCom and Enron to what is
happening in the larger economy," says Democratic pollster Geoff
Garin. "So a corporate accountability message becomes an economic
message, not just a statement of moral values."</TE>
<TE>   That corporate accountability theme is infusing Democratic
campaigns. Increasingly party leaders are citing the turmoil on Wall
Street, and the parade of accounting scandals, as a new count in
their indictment against Republican plans to partially privatize
Social Security by allowing workers to divert part of their payroll
taxes into individual investment accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Most broadly, Democrats are trying to paint the White House and
congressional Republicans as too close to the corporate executives
now accused of fraud. In many campaigns, Garin said, the overall
message will increasingly focus on ensuring "that corporations treat
consumers, workers and investors fairly, rather than plundering the
economy."</TE>
<TE>   A new ad for Sen. Tim Johnson (D-S.D.), who is locked in one of
the nation's closest Senate races against Republican Rep. John R.
Thune, may prefigure a trend. As Johnson's campaign criticizes Thune
over his support for a House corporate reform bill less stringent
than the Senate version, the ad declares: "Tim Johnson believes
guilty corporations should be held accountable for their actions."</TE>
<TE>   The prospect of Democrats, who traditionally portray themselves as
the party of the "little guy," auditioning for the role as protector
of the investor class underscores how much the trend toward mass
participation in the stock market is reshaping the political
environment.</TE>
<TE>   Zogby and other analysts say the anxiety over the stock market is
the key factor in growing gloom about the overall economy and the
country's direction.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Optimism Has Faded</TE>
<TE>   Polls in recent weeks show a sharp deterioration in voter
assessment of the economy, even though, as Bush now repeatedly
stresses, the gross national product grew sharply in this year's
first quarter. In a CBS/New York Times poll released last week,
Americans split 49%-49% over whether the economy was doing well or
poorly; that's a sharp drop just since May, when two-thirds of
Americans said it was doing well.</TE>
<TE>   These concerns are puncturing the bubble of optimism that formed
after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. That's evident in the measure
that many political operatives watch above all: the share of
Americans who think the country is moving on the right track.</TE>
<TE>   For most of the period since Sept. 11, a majority of Americans
have said the country is on the right track. But that number is
falling precipitously: In the latest McInturff survey, just 37% of
Americans said the country is on the right track. What's happened, he
said, is that traditional economic concerns are reasserting
themselves in shaping voters' assessments of the country's direction.</TE>
<TE>   If this gloom lasts through this fall, the election could prove
more tumultuous than has seemed likely until now, analysts in both
parties agree.</TE>
<TE>   Mitch Bainwol, executive director of the National Republican
Senatorial Committee, said the increasing pessimism is most likely to
hurt congressional incumbents in both parties.</TE>
<TE>   But Democrats remain confident that voters will follow the
traditional pattern in midterm elections of taking out
dissatisfaction with the country's direction on the party in the
White House. "This is very much the kind of thing that has the
potential to transform races," Garin said.</TE>
<TE>   Persistent gloom is also likely to change Bush's position over
time. McInturff's research shows that historically the president's
job approval rating runs about 20 percentage points ahead of the
number of people who think the country is on the right track.</TE>
<TE>   With his post-Sept. 11 glow, Bush has been beating that precedent:
In the latest McInturff survey, his approval rating is 65%, a full 28
points higher than the right track. That "bonus" is likely to erode
over time, McInturff said, and unless the sense of optimism improves,
Bush's approval rating may drift down toward 60% or below.</TE>

<HD>Reform Group Calls for Church Changes</HD>
<DH>Religion: Voice of the Faithful asks the pope to adopt the
policies that U.S. bishops approved on priest sex abuse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>At its first national meeting Saturday, a non-clergy reform group
born out of the Roman Catholic priest sexual abuse scandal called for
drastic changes in the way the church is governed.</LD>
<LD>   An estimated 4,000 Voice of the Faithful members from 35 states
and seven foreign countries signed a petition urging Pope John Paul
II to endorse the reform policies that U.S. bishops approved in June.</LD>
<LD>   In a statement, the group vowed to find ways for lay Catholics to
"actively participate in the governance and guidance of the Catholic
Church."</LD>
<TE>   Included among proposals under discussion were policymaking power
for lay church members and giving parishioners a role in the
appointment of bishops and pastors.</TE>
<TE>   Father Thomas Doyle, keynote speaker and an Air Force chaplain in
Germany, said the abuse scandal resulted from "the delusion that the
clergy are somehow above the rest." He said some clergymen's
"unbridled addiction to power" was a contributing factor.</TE>
<TE>   The word "democracy" strikes fear in many clergy, he said, but lay
Catholics need to shed "timidity or fearful deference to the very
structures that have betrayed us."</TE>
<TE>   Catholics must also "stop enabling through financial support the
power structures" responsible for the "horrific consequences" of the
scandal and cover-ups, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Panelists at the meeting included Thomas Arens of Germany, an
organizer of a petition drive in the mid-1990s urging the church to
accept married priests and women priests, and lay theologian Lisa
Sowle Cahill of Boston College.</TE>
<TE>   Although the group has not called for Boston's Cardinal Bernard
Law to resign, participants planned a procession later Saturday to
the cathedral to express their unity and solidarity with victims of
abuse by priests.</TE>
<TE>   Law has come under criticism for allegedly letting abusive priests
keep getting new assignments in parishes that were not warned of the
priests' prior conduct.</TE>
<TE>   Since February, the reform group says it has attracted 19,000
supporters, forming chapters in 68 parishes around the nation, half
of them in Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   Voice is "the fastest-growing Catholic lay organization in the
world," James E. Post, a Boston University professor and the group's
president, said.</TE>
<TE>   The group called on members to fill out forms rating bishops'
compliance with reform policies. Results are to be issued before the
bishops' November meeting.</TE>

<KH>The Cooks Prefer to Accent Quality of Life Amid Stock Market
Turmoil</KH>
<HD>Taking It All in Stride</HD>
<DH>The sharp stock market decline of the last two years has
Americans concerned about their retirement savings. But patient
investors from Southern California and across the country are
confident Wall Street will rebound from a Great Bear Market that will
not seem to end.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeanette Marantos</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ardent savers Liz and Rob Cook of Woodland Hills watched Liz's 401(k)
retirement account drop by more than 20% before she pulled her
remaining $245,000 out of the stock market in January. And Liz, a
52-year communication technician, says it would take more than
analysts' recommendations or congressional action to get her back in
the market.</LD>
<LD>   "I want to see the market go up for at least a month before I put
my money back in, and then I think I'll be cautious about getting in.
I won't put it all back at once," Liz said.</LD>
<LD>   "People say, 'Put it back in now or you'll miss the big run-up.'
But I think, 'What if it becomes the big run-down?' Rob says if I was
brave I'd put my money in the market now, because it's got to be at
the bottom. And I said, 'Yeah, that's what they said a month ago. You
can do whatever you want with your money.' "</LD>
<TE>   Rob, 56, a rural postal carrier, has about $75,000 in his 401(k),
which remains in the market. He sheepishly admits he's been
predicting the bottom for some time.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we were there at 9,000 (on the Dow Jones industrial
average) and then at 8,500. I can't imagine it going anywhere under
8,000, but then I didn't think it would drop anywhere near 450 points
today," he said of Friday's decline, during which the Dow actually
fell below 8,000 for a time before closing at 8,019.26, down 390.23.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really a scary time, and I've given up on the analysts, even
the ones I used to have so much faith in, because they seem to be as
much in the air as we are. They're just making excuses, the same ones
they made two years ago. It's hard to know what to do."</TE>
<TE>   Rob says he's glad Liz pulled her money out of the market, even
though it's only earning from 2% to 3% in a fixed-income fund. His
401(k) is still invested in a Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index mutual
fund, the fund Liz had invested in as well, and he figures that's
enough market exposure for the family right now. The vast majority of
their retirement savings are in their 401(k)s.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, when the Cooks were the subject of a Los Angeles
Times Money Make-Over, Rob had about $115,000 in his 401(k).</TE>
<TE>   "I've probably lost 40% of what I had, but I'm not thinking of
pulling out. I can't afford to, and I figure the market will always
come back. I have a little time [before retirement]--three to five
years--and I'm sure in that period it will come back. It's just
fortunate we're both working. It's nice to have two salaries while
there's so much uncertainty."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the market drop hasn't really affected the quality of
their lives. The Cooks still love to eat out. Liz is still addicted
to crafting and Rob likes to buy cars.</TE>
<TE>   "He went to the grocery store recently and I got a little worried
because he was gone so long," Liz said. "Then he called and said,
'Can you pick me up? I just bought a car. It was such a good deal....
' "</TE>
<TE>   But their car payments are their only debt. The Cooks pay off
their credit cards every month. Their $400,000 home will be paid off
in September--two years ahead of schedule--and their daughter, Dana,
is out of college. It took her a year, but Dana finally found a job
in communication and will soon be living on her own.</TE>
<TE>   "We know people who can't afford to retire because they owe so
much money," Rob said. "There's so much more personal debt than there
used to be, and at some point I think it's really going to affect
everyone financially."</TE>

<HD>U.S. to Withhold $34 Million From U.N. Population Fund</HD>
<DH>Aid: Agency offers services in 142 countries, covering
contraception to abstinence education. White House says money will go
to other efforts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration has decided to withhold $34 million for
international family planning programs administered by the United
Nations, a move that delights conservatives but intensifies a battle
with Congress and women's rights advocates about global assistance
and reproductive health policy.</LD>
<LD>   According to administration and congressional sources, the State
Department will announce within the next few days that the
administration will not pay its contribution to the U.N. Population
Fund. The fund operates projects in 142 countries, ranging from
contraception to abstinence education to gynecological services.</LD>
<LD>   The decision, reached by the State Department in coordination with
the White House, embraces the contention of abortion opponents and
conservatives that the fund tacitly perpetuates a "one-child" policy
in China that has led to forced abortions and sterilizations. They
cite a provision routinely included in the foreign affairs spending
bill that forbids funding of groups that allow such practices.</LD>
<TE>   That view is vehemently disputed. A State Department team that
traveled to China two months ago to investigate the allegations found
no evidence that the U.N.'s program was linked to such abuses,
according to officials in the administration and on Capitol Hill. The
findings, contained in a report that has not been made public,
parallel the conclusions of an investigation conducted in April by
members of the British Parliament.</TE>
<TE>   To try to blunt the political and practical repercussions of
cutting the $34 million, the administration plans to announce that it
will devote the same amount of money to other international aid
efforts, possibly to the U.S. Agency for International Development,
which subsidize nonprofit relief agencies operating population
programs that President Bush favors.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll keep the funding at the same level, but we're just not
going to fund people who are involved in abortions," a senior
administration official said.</TE>
<TE>   The boycott of the U.N. fund is a sequel to the first substantive
action of Bush's presidency. Two days after his inauguration, he
banned the award of family planning grants to international groups
that use other sources of money for abortion services. The ban,
reversing a Clinton administration policy, was an immediate sign of
support for social conservatives who helped put Bush in the White
House.</TE>
<TE>   The earlier ban differs from the latest move because it had a
direct effect on family planning groups, not foreign governments. The
U.N. fund works primarily through governments overseas.</TE>
<TE>   The opposition to the U.N. fund represents an administration
reversal. Last year, Bush asked Congress to devote $25 million to the
program, and the administration eventually agreed with lawmakers to
allot as much as $34 million this year.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell has praised the program for
carrying out "invaluable work."</TE>
<TE>   However, abortion opponents, including the three top leaders of
the House, have lobbied the administration to cut off the money, even
though the program does not directly pay for abortions.</TE>
<TE>   In January, the White House suspended the funding on a temporary
basis, saying it needed time to examine the complaints about China.</TE>
<TE>   Like many decisions under Bush, this one has been tightly held.
Senior administration officials had begun to inform a few key
lawmakers, and word was beginning to circulate among allies in
interest groups.</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth Connor, president of the Family Research Council, called
the move "very sound policy" that "continues to give shoe leather to
the president's pro-life commitments."</TE>
<TE>   "It's also good politics. It helps the president energize his
base."</TE>

<HD>Nonprofits Yet Another Victim of Dow Rout as Grants Drop
Off</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dean Gladden never imagined that the Dow could dictate the season
lineup at the Cleveland Playhouse. But it has.</LD>
<LD>   The stock market rout has forced Gladden to stage only plays with
small casts because he doesn't have enough money to hire lots of
actors.</LD>
<LD>   Nonprofit programs across the nation face an equally painful
pinch. It's not because they invested in stocks. Most have barely
enough cash to pay the rent, much less to gamble on Wall Street. But
the foundations they depend on for grants do invest--and many have
taken a tremendous hit.</LD>
<TE>   Endowments have tumbled. Income has dried up. And many foundations
have been forced to reduce grants, delay payments or cut off
nonprofits that have depended on them for years.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of the untold side effects of the stock market. It's
that trickle-down," said Joel Goldenbach of Casita Maria, a New York
social service agency that relies on grants.</TE>
<TE>   Almost overnight, hundreds of millions of grant dollars have
evaporated, jeopardizing tutoring programs and domestic violence
shelters, fisheries monitors and ethnic dance troupes, job training
services and physician visits to the homebound elderly. Foundation
directors, desperate to save their shriveling endowments, predict
that even more grants will be yanked next year.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first time in my life I've rooted for the rich
people," sighed one social activist whose grants are in jeopardy--and
who has taken a sudden interest in the twists and turns of the Dow
Jones industrial average.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow plunged to a four-year low Friday, losing 390 points to
finish at 8,019.</TE>
<TE>   The blue-chip index is now off nearly a third since hitting a peak
of 11,722 on Jan. 14, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation perhaps hardest hit by the bear market has been the
David and Lucile Packard Foundation in Los Altos. Its endowment is
invested almost entirely in the stock of computer company Hewlett
Packard. And it has lost nearly 75% of its value in the last two
years.</TE>
<TE>   The result: The foundation will award just $250 million in grants
this year, compared with $615 million in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Another Bay Area group, the Valley Foundation in Los Gatos, cut
its awards about 15% this year and predicts another 15% cut, at
least, in the next cycle of handouts. That means $1 million less for
arts organizations in Santa Clara County.</TE>
<TE>   The story echoes across the country. In Atlanta, the Robert W.
Woodruff Foundation has trimmed at least $10 million from its grant
pool in the last two years. And at the Central Indiana Community
Foundation, President Brian Payne says, with a forced chuckle: "I
think our threshold for pain has been crossed just in the past couple
of days. We're evaluating what's going to have to go. We don't know
the answers yet, but certainly, we're going to have less money to
give."</TE>
<TE>   Foundations generally adjust their giving to reflect their
financial health over the previous 12 to 36 months. So even if stocks
roar back, the dismal returns this year and last could continue to
drag down grant awards through 2005.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're hearing right now is only distant thunder. Next year
is going to be a lot worse. The year after that, watch out,"
predicted Jack Shakely, president of the California Community
Foundation in Los Angeles. He has watched his endowment shrink by $60
million in the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   Shakely has warned even his favorite nonprofits that they had
better start seeking other funds. One potential target: the Read With
Me program, which gives preschool children a free backpack full of
books and then tutors them on how to "read" the stories to their
parents.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be making far fewer grants next year," Shakely said. "I'm
sorry about it, but that's the truth."</TE>
<TE>   The cutbacks are not by any means universal.</TE>
<TE>   Some foundations with limited stock exposure have held steady. The
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, for example, has done quite well
by its investing in bonds. It does not hold a single share of Bill
Gates' Microsoft Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Other foundations have lost significant sums but are determined to
ride it out. The New York Community Trust endowment stands at $1.72
billion, down from more than $2 billion when the stock market was
flying high. But the trust has cut such administrative expenses as
travel and advertising to avoid reducing grants.</TE>
<TE>   "We anticipate that we're going to be OK," spokeswoman Ani Hurwitz
said.</TE>
<TE>   In response to the Wall Street woes, some foundations have begun
to shift the type of grants they offer. A few have stopped funding
expensive capital projects, such as new buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Others have cut back on grants for arts and environmental
projects, reasoning that help for the hungry and homeless is more
vital in a recession. Start-up projects are also unlikely to get
grants these days; foundations are directing what money they have to
programs with good track records.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to [focus giving] on projects that can clearly be
sustained even in a bad economy," explained Charles H. McTier,
president of the Woodruff Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   A few foundation directors are even experimenting with ways to
help nonprofits without writing checks--by holding seminars in such
skills as accounting or public relations.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of foundations understand that times are tough for them,
but they're tough for their grantees too, so they're trying very hard
not to cut back," said Dot Ridings, president of the Council on
Foundations, a trade group for grant givers.</TE>
<TE>   For some nonprofits, however, the year has already proved a
disaster.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Marine Conservation Council, which works to preserve
sustainable fisheries, lost its entire grant from the Packard
Foundation. That wiped out 35% of the council's budget. Directors are
scrambling to come up with other grants to plug the hole. But there
are few to be had. "Everyone's tightening up," said Bob Eaton, the
executive director.</TE>
<TE>   Packard also was unable to renew a $10,000 grant for the
Masterworks Chorale, an adult choir based in San Mateo. Without that
money, which represented about 8% of its budget, the choir has had to
adjust its repertoire. No longer can it perform majestic pieces, such
as Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, because it can't afford a full
orchestra to back it up. At a recent concert, the 60 singers
performed with just two pianos as accompaniment.</TE>
<TE>   "It lets your audience down when you have to scale back like
that," said Sean McNeal, the executive director.</TE>
<TE>   The cuts in foundation grants are especially devastating to
nonprofits this year because other donations are also down.</TE>
<TE>   Corporate giving plunged 14.5% last year; this season does not
look to be much better. Individual donations are also iffy, with some
agencies reporting that supporters are less willing to buy tickets to
gala benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Some chapters of the United Way fell so far short of campaign
goals that they have had to slash grants to social service agencies.
State governments are also cutting back grants to nonprofits in a
struggle to balance budgets.</TE>
<TE>   And this is all happening at a time when need is soaring,
especially for programs to help the poor and jobless.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the last couple of years, our requests are up substantially,
so we're probably having to disappoint more people," said David
Morse, a spokesman for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Count Dean Gladden among the disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   Four of the Cleveland Playhouse's most loyal corporate sponsors
have either pulled out or sharply reduced their gifts. A local
foundation that had contributed $75,000 last year could not renew the
pledge. Another cut way back. All told, Gladden has had to cut $1
million out of a $7.5-million budget.</TE>
<TE>   That means he can hire just 55 actors for his eight shows this
season. And that means no more extravaganzas like the blockbuster
musical he delighted in staging last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Certain plays don't even get on the table," said Gladden, the
theater's managing director.</TE>
<TE>   At least he can still put on performances.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland dancers Tom and Susanna Evert aren't so sure they'll be
able to keep their small troupe on stage. They were hoping for a
$20,000 grant this year from the Gund Foundation. They got $5,400
instead.</TE>
<TE>   The Everts are frantically soliciting money from individual
supporters. But "to miss a few grants, even though the amounts are
small, is crippling," Tom Evert said. "If we can't fund our
operations ... we can't dance."</TE>

<HD>Preventable Hospital Infections Becoming a Deadly Epidemic</HD>
<DH>Medicine: The problem is now the fourth leading cause of
mortality among Americans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL J. BERENS</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Deadly infections fueled by poor sanitation, contaminated instruments
and unwashed hands in the nation's hospitals are needlessly claiming
tens of thousands of lives annually, according to an investigation by
the Chicago Tribune.</LD>
<LD>   While the hospital industry often characterizes deaths by
infection as random and unavoidable, the Tribune, in the first
comprehensive analysis of patients' deaths linked to infection in
5,810 hospitals across the nation, found otherwise. Not only are many
deaths by infection easily preventable, the newspaper said, but
soaring infection rates also have been exacerbated by hospital budget
cutbacks in infection control staffs and housekeeping services.</LD>
<LD>   The problem has grown so severe that deaths linked to hospital
germs now represent the fourth leading cause of mortality among
Americans, behind heart disease, cancer and strokes, according to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Infections connected to
hospital-based germs kill more people annually than auto accidents,
fires and drowning combined.</LD>
<TE>   "The number of people needlessly killed by hospital infections is
unbelievable, but the public doesn't know anything about it," said
Dr. Barry Farr, a leading infection-control expert and president of
the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America.</TE>
<TE>   "For years, we've just been quietly bundling the bodies of
patients off to the morgue while infection rates get higher and
higher."</TE>
<TE>   Infections that would be no problem for healthy people can become
fatal for hospital patients who are too old or too weak to fend them
off.</TE>
<TE>   The Tribune's analysis, which adopted methods commonly used by
epidemiologists, found an estimated 103,000 deaths linked to hospital
infections in 2000. The CDC, which bases its numbers on
extrapolations from 250 hospitals, estimated there were 90,000 that
year. Though the CDC does not attempt to classify any infections as
preventable, the Tribune examined federal health inspection reports
and other public documents in all 50 states to make its analysis. The
paper found that in 2000--the latest year health-care records were
available nationally--75,000 of the deadly hospital infections took
place in conditions that were preventable.</TE>
<TE>   The Tribune investigation uncovered disturbing and largely
unreported cases of fatal infections that might have been avoided had
hospitals held themselves and their staffs to adequate sanitation
standards.</TE>
<TE>   In a Detroit hospital, as doctors and nurses moved about the
pediatric intensive care unit without washing their hands, a germ
killed four babies in the same row of bassinets in the spring of
1997, according to interviews and court records. It took two full
months for administrators to close the nursery for cleaning.</TE>
<TE>   Staphylococcus germs, common on the skin and in nasal passages,
infected more than 100 cardiac patients at a West Palm Beach, Fla.,
hospital over the last four years, killing 13 of them. The survivors
underwent agonizing surgeries and long rehabilitation periods as
rotting bone was cut from their bodies.</TE>
<TE>   Eight Chicago children died in 1998 as germs from a South Side
pediatric medicine center spread into a hospital. Fever-ridden
health-care workers who tended to patients spread the germs, as did
other workers who failed to wash their hands. The outbreak was
stopped months later after 36 workers, some with fevers and sickness,
were ordered to stay home.</TE>
<TE>   The rare bacteria found in Chicago has since been linked to the
deaths of dozens of children in medical facilities in three states.</TE>
<TE>   Hospitals are not legally required to disclose infection rates,
and most don't. Doctors are not required to tell patients about risk
or exposure to hospital germs. There is little government oversight
in the area of infection in hospitals, which combines with the
industry's long-apparent penchant for secrecy to hide the problem.</TE>
<TE>   The problems stretch far beyond isolated cases in specific
hospitals. The Tribune's investigation found systemic problems
pointing to abysmal infection-control efforts across the nation:</TE>
<TE>   * Life-threatening violations of infection-control standards are
common in hospitals. Since 1995, the investigation showed, 75% of all
U.S. hospitals have been cited for serious cleanliness and sanitation
violations.</TE>
<TE>   * In thousands of cases, surgeons performed operations without
washing their hands or wearing surgical masks. In one case, records
show, surgeries were performed in a Connecticut operating room even
while dust floated in the air and flies buzzed overhead during
open-heart surgery.</TE>
<TE>   * Hospital cleaning staffs are overwhelmed and inadequately
trained, which leads to unsanitary areas where germs can grow and
multiply, sometimes for years. Since 1995, hospital cleaning staffs
have been cut by 25%. In that same period, almost half of all
hospitals have been cited for failure to properly sanitize their
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   * Rampant payroll cutbacks have gutted staffs devoted to reducing
infections. These staffs have been cut by an average of 20%
nationally in the last three years. A majority of hospitals ignores
the CDC's recommendation that hospitals have one infection-control
person for every 250 beds.</TE>
<TE>   Budget cutbacks are cited as one reason infections are on the rise
in the nation's hospitals. Nurses report their hospitals are so
understaffed that they don't always have time to wash their hands
between patient visits.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is not likely to go away. The American Hospital Assn.
predicts further cutbacks in staff and patient care, leading to more
infection-control problems.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,700 American hospitals, about a third of the total, are
operating at a loss. An equal number are on the edge of bankruptcy,
the AHA reports.</TE>
<TE>   At Bridgeport Hospital in Bridgeport, Conn., germs flourished in
areas that are supposed to be the most sterile places in the
hospital, according to a review of thousands of pages of hospital
records collected in a lawsuit and opened for public inspection by
the Connecticut Supreme Court last year.</TE>
<TE>   The court case involved four patients who contracted infections
inside the hospitals. Operating Room No. 2, where one in five
patients at times contracted infections, epitomized the hospital's
problem. The air was often contaminated by dust because of faulty
ventilation. Flies buzzed overhead during operations. Doctors wore
germ-laden clothes from home into the operating room. Many did not
wash their hands before operating.</TE>
<TE>   "Bridgeport had a long history of high infection rates but
corrective action was not taken until it was too late," said Peggy
Haering, an attorney who represented a patient in a suit settled out
of court. "What became clear is that these infections were
preventable."</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody here intentionally spread germs, but we've learned that
even the smallest breakdown in infection control can have devastating
consequences," said hospital spokesman John Capiello. The hospital
has undergone a $30-million remodeling. Infection rates have dropped
to nearly zero.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital-monitoring system is a checkerboard of local, state
and federal regulators who do little to encourage better infection
control. All hospitals must have general standards to quality for the
federal Medicaid program, but each facility is allowed to draft its
own rules.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you imagine the medical community outcry if even a single
doctor died from germs because of a failure to wash hands?" asked
Mark Bruley, a forensic investigator who studies hospital conditions
for ECRI, a nonprofit laboratory near Philadelphia.</TE>

<LD>The sharp stock market decline of the last two years has produced the
longest bear market since the 1940s, driving the Dow Jones industrial
average and other major indexes to their lowest levels since at least
1998. It's a market decline that has wiped out trillions of dollars
in wealth in two years. A market decline that seems unwilling to
stop.</LD>
<LD>   But it's not just a market of brutal facts and figures. It's a
market of real people. With more than half of U.S. households owning
stocks, many have seen their hard-earned savings decline, their
dreams of greater wealth or early retirement delayed.</LD>
<LD>   Some have compensated by cutting back on vacations, eating out
less, trimming other expenses. Some have delayed retirements. Some
have cut back on charitable donations. Some are working to earn more.</LD>
<TE>   Some have thrown in the towel on the market. Some are sticking it
out, hoping for the declines to end. Some want to invest more.</TE>

<LD>Georgi Krom, a 49-year-old Seattle graphics designer, has been
investing her family's modest savings and retirement money since the
late 1980s and has seen it grow to more than $1 million through a
combination of patience, caution and nerves of steel--qualities she
says she's not about to abandon now, when the market is tough.</LD>
<LD>   "It's depressing because it'd be nice to think if I'd just sold
everything a year ago, I'd have more money than I do now. But that's
risky too, because you have to pay commissions, and you never know
when the market is going to go up again. I guess I feel if you have a
long-term investment strategy, you shouldn't necessarily panic.
People are probably selling now, when they probably should be
thinking about buying.... We have better prices right now than we
have had in a long time."</LD>
<LD>   Krom and her husband, Steve, a tool machinist who owns a small
hauling company, have two teenage boys, 13 and 16, who are
approaching college age. For them, she has put money in short-term
corporate bonds, cash and some zero-coupon bonds she bought a few
years ago. When her father died recently, Krom paid off her mortgage
rather than making a big stock investment.</LD>
<TE>   "It just felt good having no mortgage," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But overall, about 67% of the family savings account and Steve's
individual retirement account is invested in the stock market. Krom
looked suspiciously at others around her, especially in the Pacific
Northwest, who were investing heavily in technology stocks over the
last decade.</TE>
<TE>   "My husband's sister invested all of her money with a broker in
tech stocks, and she absolutely wiped out her retirement fund," Krom
said. "Hundreds of thousands of dollars went down the drain because
she was so convinced that tech stocks were the way to go; that was
the new economy. I said I was not comfortable with that, and I wanted
to make my own decisions. I liked companies that had good products
and a stable outlook."</TE>
<TE>   Krom does have more than a thousand shares of Microsoft stock,
which she bought on a cost basis of $5 a share. Even with the recent
downturns, Microsoft Corp. is trading at $49.56 a share and is likely
to remain a good investment, Krom believes. "They execute very well,
they have a lot of cash, they have no debt, they're a very healthy
technology company, and I wouldn't sell them."</TE>
<TE>   But most of the rest of her portfolio is old standards: General
Electric Co., Pfizer Inc., Washington Mutual Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's kind of goofy when people pay enormous prices for
companies that don't have good earnings," she said. "My philosophy
has always been companies with good earnings growth that are good,
solid companies, and if they go down in price because people are
selling them off, if they are good quality, you should add to them."</TE>

<HD>Attorney in 'Sleeping Lawyer' Case Hits Roadblock in Texas</HD>
<DH>Court: It took 15 years to get inmate a retrial. Now Robert
McGlasson fights to just stay on the job.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After waging a 15-year battle all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court
to convince the legal system that Calvin J. Burdine should not be
executed because his attorney slept through significant portions of
his 1984 murder trial, Burdine's appellate lawyer is engaged in a new
legal fight over whether he can continue working for Burdine.</LD>
<LD>   In Houston, Harris County Judge Joan Huffman ruled in late June
that she will not appoint Robert McGlasson to represent Burdine, 49,
in his retrial on charges that he stabbed his roommate to death in
1983. Huffman said that, even though McGlasson was entitled to
continue representing Burdine, she would not permit him to be paid
with state funds.</LD>
<LD>   The judge said that McGlasson, a Yale Law School graduate who once
ran a death penalty defense project in Texas and is a federal public
defender in Atlanta, is not on a recently created list of lawyers
qualified to handle capital cases in Harris County.</LD>
<TE>   "I intend to follow the rules, as I believe I'm required to do,"
Huffman said at a June 26 hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys in Texas say Huffman's actions are bizarre and ironic in
several regards. Prime among them is that McGlasson is a highly
experienced capital litigator, a member of the Texas bar, said Austin
lawyer David Botsford, who has litigated several cases involving
similar representation disputes. And McGlasson clearly could handle
the case much more efficiently and with less expense to taxpayers
than any other lawyer because he has a rapport with Burdine and is
familiar with the case's voluminous record, Botsford said.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Harris County created the list of approved lawyers last
year to improve the quality of representation for indigent
defendants--a requirement of reforms passed by the state Legislature
in no small measure because of the Burdine case.</TE>
<TE>   The case came to national attention during the 2000 presidential
election, when reporters questioned then-Gov. George W. Bush about
"sleeping lawyers" in Texas death penalty cases.</TE>
<TE>   Burdine was "the poster child that symbolized the failure of the
Texas approach to indigent defense, and indigent capital defense in
particular," said Bill Beardall, executive director of the Equal
Justice Foundation in Austin who played a key role in getting Texas'
Fair Defense Act passed.</TE>
<TE>   "Now you might have the new reform designed to prevent what
happened to Burdine coming back to his detriment. No one intended for
that to happen," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Beardall also emphasized that the Fair Defense Act, cited by
Huffman, does not apply to crimes that occurred before Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   On June 21, Burdine, who was granted a new trial by a federal
appeals court last year, filed an affidavit with Huffman seeking
continued representation by McGlasson. "I am very confident in Mr.
McGlasson.... He knows me and my case better than anybody. I trust
him. I can talk to him," Burdine wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "After my first trial," in which court-appointed attorney Joe
Frank Cannon was asleep for significant periods of time, "it took me
a very long time to be able to trust even Mr. McGlasson. I know that
I will not be able [to] trust another lawyer very quickly, especially
not without Mr. McGlasson being there with me," Burdine added.</TE>
<TE>   McGlasson said he would take a leave of absence from his job in
Georgia, would handle the case for the same court-appointed fees that
any other lawyer would get and would not seek travel expenses.</TE>
<TE>   But at the June 26 hearing, Huffman made it clear that she would
not appoint McGlasson, meaning if he wanted to continue to represent
Burdine, he would have to do it on his own nickel.</TE>
<TE>   "You obviously have a right to represent Mr. Burdine," Huffman
said. "And if you want to sign on the case, I'm going to do nothing
to terminate that relationship. The whole crux of this is whether I'm
going to appoint you and you're going to get paid for it. We all know
that's what we're talking about."</TE>
<TE>   After McGlasson made it clear that he intended to challenge this
decision, Huffman, who worked as an assistant district attorney in
Houston for 14 years before being elected a judge in 1998, said she
intended to appoint veteran Houston attorney Anthony Osso to
represent Burdine and scheduled a retrial for Oct. 7.</TE>
<TE>   Osso, whose knowledge of the case is limited to what he has read
in newspapers, said last week that his appointment is on hold until
Burdine's challenge is resolved.</TE>
<TE>   The Harris County district attorney's office has taken no position
on the dispute. "That's between the judge and Mr. Burdine's lawyers,"
Assistant Dist. Atty. Paula Storts said.</TE>
<TE>   Last Monday, the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers Assn. and the
National Assn. of Criminal Defense filed suit in the Texas Court of
Criminal Appeals asking the court to order Huffman to appoint
McGlasson. The lawsuit contends that Huffman is required under the
5th, 6th, 8th and 14th amendments to the U.S. Constitution and
sections of the Texas Constitution to reappoint McGlasson.</TE>
<TE>   Burdine's defense "has been thrown into disarray by the effective
removal of McGlasson," the suit states.</TE>
<TE>   "[Huffman] threatens to turn what is supposed to be a fair
adversarial event into a decidedly lopsided one," reads the brief
filed by H.F. Rick Hagen of Denton and Lisa Kemler of Alexandria, Va.</TE>
<TE>   "The fundamental issue in this proceeding is the extent to which
the trial judge may permissibly interrupt or interfere with a
long-standing and existing attorney-client relationship," the suit
states. Huffman's "refusal to continue McGlasson's appointment ...
especially where McGlasson seeks appointment on the same terms as any
other attorney ... is an unreasonable denial of [Burdine's] right to
effective assistance of counsel."</TE>
<TE>   Huffman has not filed a response, and under Texas legal rules
there is no firm timetable for action on the suit.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit notes that during the last decade McGlasson was
appointed by a state judge and a federal judge in Houston to
represent Burdine in separate proceedings seeking reversal of
Burdine's conviction and death sentence. Burdine has admitted that he
was present when his former roommate, W.T. Wise, was robbed at his
trailer in 1983, but he denies that he killed Wise. However,
Burdine's co-defendant pleaded guilty, got an eight-year sentence and
testified against Burdine.</TE>
<TE>   The suit emphasizes that there are numerous precedents--including
three rulings in Texas since 1989 and decisions in California,
Georgia and Louisiana--that a criminal defendant has the right to
have continued representation from a lawyer with whom he has a
long-standing relationship.</TE>
<TE>   "Although an indigent defendant does not have the right to counsel
of his own choosing, once counsel is appointed, the trial judge is
obliged to respect the attorney-client relationship created through
the appointment," the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ruled in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   And Thursday, there was a reminder in the nation's capital of the
symbolic importance of Burdine's case. After the Senate Judiciary
Committee approved the Innocence Protection Act--which, among other
things, is designed to raise the quality of attorneys in death
penalty cases--Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), the bill's main
sponsor, said if the bill becomes law, "we will finally put an end to
the sleeping lawyer syndrome."</TE>
<TE>   And the Houston Chronicle, in an editorial Thursday headlined,
"He's Awake," urged Huffman to reconsider her decision--and at the
very least, appoint McGlasson as co-counsel for Burdine. Harris
County had already "suffered enough embarrassment over the case that
is known around the world as the 'sleeping lawyer' trial."</TE>

<HD>Power Plant Fire in Manhattan Causes Blackout, Snarls
Traffic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A fire at a utility plant Saturday blacked out power for tens of
thousands of people in a swath of Lower Manhattan and snarled
transportation around the city.</LD>
<LD>   Crews had restored electricity by early evening, largely ending an
emergency that brought back disconcerting memories of the days after
Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   During Saturday's outage, residents around the fallen World Trade
Center again found themselves navigating dark hallways and descending
gloomy stairwells for dozens of floors as sirens wailed outside.</LD>
<TE>   National Guardsmen, a fixture on the streets after the terrorist
attack, returned, helping police direct traffic on roads crowded with
onlookers.</TE>
<TE>   A stretch of Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, a major highway along
the east side of Manhattan, was closed.</TE>
<TE>   Most subway traffic through downtown was suspended or rerouted.
Smoke could be seen for miles.</TE>
<TE>   There was no evidence, though, that the midafternoon fire was
caused intentionally, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said.</TE>
<TE>   The apparent cause was a transformer explosion at the plant, which
provides power for much of Lower Manhattan, said Joe Petta, a
Consolidated Edison spokesman. "It sounded like a jet plane crashing,
and then a big thing of black smoke went up in the air," witness
Michael Koster said.</TE>
<TE>   About 63,000 customers lost power in areas south of 14th Street to
the lower tip of Manhattan, the utility said. The neighborhoods
affected included Greenwich Village, SoHo and TriBeCa.</TE>
<TE>   Shops in the blacked-out areas began shutting their doors shortly
after losing power. "We have no choice; we have to close. Can't open
the register, can't give anybody a receipt," said Jimmy Vejerano,
manager of a discount store.</TE>
<TE>   Consolidated Edison said some of its workers were inside the plant
at the time of the explosion.</TE>
<TE>   No injuries were reported.</TE>

<KH>For the Rings of Laguna Woods, No Big Vacation and Less for
Charity</KH>
<HD>Taking It All in Stride</HD>
<DH>The sharp stock market decline of the last two years has
Americans concerned about their retirement savings. But patient
investors from Southern California and across the country are
confident Wall Street will rebound from a Great Bear Market that will
not seem to end.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kelly Yamanouchi</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bob Ring, a 69-year-old retiree who lives in Laguna Woods with his
68-year-old wife, Bette, says the recent market declines have led him
to put off plans for a vacation and cut back on his charitable
donations.</LD>
<LD>   "We would love to go to Australia, and Australia is what, $10,000
a person for a four-week trip," Ring said. "She said, 'You know what,
we'd better not do that.' "</LD>
<LD>   Ring, who retired in 1993 as president of a company in Monrovia
that makes precision welding equipment, has about 60% of his net
worth tied up in stock mutual funds, with the rest in bonds, cash and
real estate.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't like to look at the numbers at the end of the day," Ring
said.</TE>
<TE>   But Ring is better off than most. He says he has lost about
$25,000 in stock market investments since the start of the year, only
a small percentage of his total retirement savings. That's better
than many people who have invested in the stock market, and thus he
isn't planning to pull his money out of stocks.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a financial advisor, and she doesn't panic," Ring said.
He's confident his conservative portfolio will stand up to the bumpy
economy.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, "it certainly affects my outlook." Because he is retired,
"all this money has to last," Ring said. He's hoping the stock market
will recover with the election season, and he may invest more heavily
in stocks then.</TE>
<TE>   Ring has stuck with the same advisor since 1985, one who is paid a
fee instead of a sales commissions.</TE>
<TE>   "I get all pumped up and she says, 'Now Bob, let's settle down
here. Do you really want to do that?' When we had the dot-coms, I
said, 'Hey, I want to be in that.' She said, 'Do you really want to
invest in companies that don't make money?' " Ring said. "We get that
dose of reality."</TE>
<TE>   Ring, who is a member of the Laguna Woods City Council and
volunteers for the Laguna Canyon Foundation, a nonprofit organization
to preserve the Laguna Coast Wilderness Park, said he's looking at
cutting his charitable donations because "my income's way down and I
certainly don't need the write-offs."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Ring, who has three grown children and two grandchildren,
tries to keep his lifestyle the same otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   "We still give birthday presents to the kids and we still go out
to dinner," Ring said, but he only eats out a few times a month.</TE>
<TE>   "Depression babies--we always save money."</TE>

<HD>Romance Is in the Air in Denver, as Novelists Gather for
Conference</HD>
<DH>Literature: Their world of happy endings contrasted by
Sept. 11, writers contemplate how their work fits into the larger
scheme of things.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.R. MOEHRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Their world is filled with lanky cowboys who can lasso any heart, and
bare-chested brutes who can be tender. Their world is filled with
fiery heroines named Belle and Dee and Savannah, who fend off the
cowboy or the brute for a few dozen pages, then succumb.</LD>
<LD>   Sweat sometimes glistens in their world. Bosoms often heave. And
curtains fluttering in and out of an open window can mean one thing
and one thing only.</LD>
<LD>   But good guys always win in their world, and every ending is
happy, and love is always the blessing that it should be, which makes
their world a nice place to be nowadays.</LD>
<TE>   Last week they brought their world to Denver's Adam's Mark Hotel
for the 22nd annual Romance Writers of America National Conference.
Nearly 2,000 writers and fans of what may be America's most popular
literary genre, which accounts for more than half of all paperback
fiction sold in the U.S., gathered for three days to trade ideas,
talk shop and contemplate how their world of fantasy can fit into the
larger world, which is suddenly focused on harsh reality.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge was daunting. But the mood among the attendees,
nearly all women, was upbeat. Large crowds still turned out to meet
superstars like Nora Roberts, who sold more paperbacks last year than
John Grisham or Stephen King. Editors and agents still held impromptu
meetings against a backdrop of blown-up covers from books like "Devil
in a Kilt" and "Taming the Tabloid Heiress." Aspiring authors still
flocked to writing workshops called "How to Marry an English Lord"
and "Waiting to Climax: Living on the Verge of Publishing."</TE>
<TE>   Despite a dramatic downturn in the publishing industry, demand for
romance novels has remained steady since Sept. 11, according to
convention organizers, who say the reason for $1.4 billion in yearly
sales is simple: Sex sells, but romance soothes. And romance fiction,
they insist with pride and prejudice and a dash of patriotism, can be
a healing balm for a nation with shredded nerves.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the most popular writers at this year's conference,
however, were those with voices and styles best suited to the war on
terrorism, writers who combine the armor of Tom Clancy with the amour
of Judith Krantz. Heading that list was Suzanne Brockmann.</TE>
<TE>   Brockmann, a mother of two from Massachusetts, is considered a
"rising" star in the romance world, though she's published 33 novels,
more than Ernest Hemingway and Henry James combined. Her books have
sold millions of copies, and many have been translated into a dozen
languages. But with her flair for military heroes and her interest in
terrorism, Brockmann could be poised to move into that next realm, to
become the Nora Roberts of the war era.</TE>
<TE>   Brockmann's heroes have always been Navy SEALs, and many of the
foes and pitfalls she's had them face have proved prophetic. "Over
the Edge," the novel Brockmann wrote months before Sept. 11, featured
a hijacked commercial airliner. The next manuscript she mailed to her
publisher, on Sept. 10, described a character boarding a flight with
a Swiss army knife.</TE>
<TE>   And yet Brockmann said she tries to use realism sparingly.</TE>
<TE>   "I provide people with an escape," she said Friday after signing
books for more than 150 fans. "But I also hear from people who say,
'Thank you for writing books ... where terrorists get their [tails]
kicked, Navy SEAL-style.' "</TE>
<TE>   Everywhere Brockmann went at the conference, a crowd gathered. Her
book-signing outdrew even the popular workshop in which a panel of
authors gave graphic instructions for writing about sex. ("No more
euphemisms," one author pleaded. "No more 'hidden pearls of ecstasy.'
")</TE>
<TE>   When not lunching with her editor or advising an aspiring young
writer, Brockmann was polishing her keynote speech for Saturday's
closing luncheon. "I'm going to talk about Sept. 11," she said,
sounding nervous about the reception she might get.</TE>
<TE>   Also drawing considerable attention was newcomer Susan Grant. Fans
approached Grant throughout the conference, not for autographs but
for reassurance that she's all right. They know she is a 13-year
co-pilot for United Airlines, and they worry about the stress she
endures on her day job.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the added fear and extra security, Grant says, working
for an airline is ideal. The cockpit gives her ideas and a place to
compose. She often plots a romance while co-piloting a 747 to Sydney,
Australia. She recalled one flight when the muse unexpectedly became
her co-pilot, and the idea for her fourth novel took off.</TE>
<TE>   "It's dark over the Pacific," she said. "You're crossing the
equator. You can see the Milky Way. It's just you and the stars. I
look over at the pilot and I say: 'What if an alien spaceship opened
up and swallowed this whole plane?' "</TE>
<TE>   The book that came of that inspiration, set for release this fall,
was part romance, part science fiction. But it had enough reality,
and enough details about how it felt to be a pilot after Sept. 11,
that Grant was able to express much of her pain and grief over the
flight crews who died in the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "I was able to put emotions and feelings on the page for the first
time. It's been a great outlet."</TE>
<TE>   Charis Calhoon, spokeswoman for Romance Writers of America, said a
novel needs two things to qualify as a romance: a central love story
and a happy ending. But such novels are not "escapes," said Emily
Toth, the Robert Penn Warren professor of English literature at
Louisiana State University.</TE>
<TE>   "Romances are more about reality and real-life things than any
other genre," Toth said, "because they are about emotions."</TE>
<TE>   Toth, who has written one romance novel to go along with many
academic papers and several critical studies of Kate Chopin, said
romance novels date back to the birth of the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "Around the time of the American Revolution," she said, "there
were a lot of novels, very popular novels, about women seduced and
abandoned. They didn't have happy endings, but they did instruct
women to avoid the lures of rakish guys with smooth promises. That's
one of the threads that runs through over 200 years of romances.
Women are speaking to women, giving warnings and cautionary tales and
role models."</TE>
<TE>   The same rule applies to gatherings of romance writers, Toth said,
where women mentor one another and train their own competition.</TE>
<TE>   Brockmann addressed that spirit of community in her speech
Saturday. But first she talked about Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   After the attacks, Brockmann said, she asked herself if she wanted
to continue. Did she really want to write another romance novel? "My
answer was yes, because there's one thing I learned this past
year.... Love wins. Love conquers terror. Love conquers fear. Love
cancels out hate."</TE>
<TE>   Her voice choked with emotion, Brockmann said all the best
responses to the terrorist attacks were those borne of love. The
passengers on the doomed planes, and in the buildings, phoned their
families immediately. "In the face of that madness, their first words
were of love.</TE>
<TE>   "I know we all got letters and e-mails after Sept. 11, thanking us
for our books--books about love and hope. Our books, our occasionally
picked on and sometimes scoffed at and often overlooked romance
novels, provide light and love in a world that has far too much
darkness."</TE>
<TE>   Gathering herself, she leaned into her audience and romanced them
into a round of applause.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's ever been a time," she said, "that I've
been more proud to be a romance writer than this past year."</TE>

<KH>'More Important Things to Worry About' in Life</KH>
<HD>Taking It All in Stride</HD>
<DH>The sharp stock market decline of the last two years has
Americans concerned about their retirement savings. But patient
investors from Southern California and across the country are
confident Wall Street will rebound from a Great Bear Market that will
not seem to end.</DH>

<LD>Margie Smith likes money as much as anyone else. But she doesn't get
all bent out of shape about it.</LD>
<LD>   The retired neurologist was washing her dog Saturday in her home
in steamy Terry, Miss., watching "one of those stock shows" on
television.</LD>
<LD>   "People spend too much time chasing money," she said. "There's a
lot more important things to worry about."</LD>
<TE>   Smith owns about 20 stocks, including many big retailers, and as
the market began to plummet again last week, she began paying more
attention.</TE>
<TE>   "I was surprised it went so low so fast," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, I'm lucky that my husband and I can live comfortably
without having to worry. But the market sure took a beating."</TE>
<TE>   One of her more exciting new stocks, Orthodontic Centers of
America, lost 27% of its value last week, sliding from $18 per share
to close Friday at $13.02. MBNA Corp., a credit-card issuer, hit the
skids, finishing the week at $16.40, compared with a high of $26 two
months ago. She also owns Dollar Tree Stores and Cost Plus Inc.,
retailers down about 10% for the week.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, who retired 11 years ago and declined to give her age,
finds investing "interesting." But she leaves most big decisions to
her broker, who has split her savings between bonds, about 75%, and
stocks, 25%.</TE>
<TE>   Like a lot of investors, it's been a tough couple of months. First
there was Enron Corp., which she owned, though she said she got out
right before it went "kaplooey." And then came WorldCom Inc., the
Mississippi-based telecommunications company that locals
celebrated--and loyally held on to, even after an accounting scandal
sent the stock, once as high as $60, into the pennies.</TE>
<TE>   "I told my broker, hands off on that one," Smith said. "And look
where that got me. Now what am I going to do? Sell WorldCom when it's
worth 10 cents?"</TE>
<TE>   Before she got too carried away, though, Smith caught herself.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe one of our problems these days is that we care too much
about all this," she said. Then she finished drying off her Yorkshire
terrier, Elly, and began talking about baking a cake.</TE>

<HD>Firefighting Tankers Return to Air After Being Grounded</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>An order grounding much of the nation's firefighting fleet of aging,
heavy-duty air tankers was lifted Saturday, two days after the second
deadly crash since June in the middle of a busy wildfire season.</LD>
<LD>   Still grounded pending results of federal investigations, however,
were nine planes of the same types as those that crashed in June near
Walker, Calif., and Thursday near Lyons, Colo., killing a total of
five crew members.</LD>
<LD>   A PB4Y-2 Privateer, a former Navy bomber that saw duty during
World War II, came apart in the air Thursday while carrying a load of
fire retardant to a blaze near the rugged Rocky Mountain National
Park, about 45 miles northwest of Denver. The fire had grown to about
4,000 acres Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, the government ordered a 24-hour stand-down of 32 other
tankers to allow inspections of the aircraft and to give crews a
rest.</TE>
<TE>   The order was lifted Saturday. Not all of the planes returned to
service immediately, as some contractors asked for more time to get
planes ready, said Jack deGolia of the National Interagency Fire
Center in Boise, Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   The four-engine Privateer was built in 1945, and investigators
were examining whether age was a factor.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't ruled out anything yet," said David Bowling, a
National Transportation Safety Board safety specialist.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Forest Service hires the tankers from private companies
that own, operate and maintain them. The nation's firefighting
aircraft average 42 years old, and the newest were built in the late
1950s, said interagency fire center spokeswoman Venetia Gempler.</TE>
<TE>   The planes are subjected to high stress because of numerous
takeoffs and landings, and quick changes in weight when the cargo of
retardant is dumped.</TE>
<TE>   On June 17, a C-130A air tanker crashed when its wings snapped off
near Walker, about 25 miles north of Yosemite National Park. The five
remaining C-130A firefighting aircraft have yet to return to the air.</TE>
<TE>   Both crashed tankers were owned by Hawkins &amp; Powers Aviation Inc.
of Greybull, Wyo.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile Saturday, two wildfires crackling through sagebrush and
juniper in south-central Oregon merged Saturday to create an
83,000-acre blaze. Residents of more than 60 homes were urged to
evacuate.</TE>
<TE>   Crews said they'll have a better shot at containing the blaze now
that it's concentrated in one area. "The fire crews are getting
together and talking about what's going to happen next," said Dale
Warriner, a fire spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   The wildfire was the second-largest in the nation, trailing only a
complex of fires burning across 94,000 acres in a remote area
northwest of Green River, Utah, said Marc Hollen, spokesman for the
Northwest Interagency Coordination Center.</TE>
<TE>   So far this year, wildfires have burned more than 3.5 million
acres around the United States.</TE>

<KH>DISPATCH FROM TAOS</KH>
<HD>Serene Town Confronts Urban Ills in 2 Killings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TAOS, N.M.</DL>
<LD>It's a brilliantly sunny day and the Sangre de Cristo mountains etch
themselves against a blue sky. Tourist traffic snarls near the
historic colonial plaza, which is being gaily transformed for the
summer's most-awaited event, Las Fiestas de Santiago y Santa Ana de
Taos.</LD>
<LD>   The lone, ugly intrusion on the convivial scene announces itself
in a lurid banner headline on the front page of the Taos News:
"Knifed to Death--2 Single Women Killed in Their Homes."</LD>
<LD>   For a serene town like Taos, where police officials strain to
recall the one homicide last year, two brutal slayings in one week
were chilling, especially to women here who are accustomed to walking
alone at night with impunity. Now shop owners say saleswomen are
requesting to leave work early to avoid being out after dark.</LD>
<TE>   An unusual tension has seized this laid-back town where few lock
their door and car keys are left in the ignition.</TE>
<TE>   "I admit I keep my door unlocked," said Jennifer Lynch. "But I did
get a little freaked out when I heard about the killings. I think
women are more alarmed now. I guess this proves crime can happen
anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   By any measure, Taos is not just anywhere. Despite its modest
size--a full-time population of 6,200--the town is a sophisticated
international destination, 60 miles north of Santa Fe. Its ruggedly
stunning setting has inspired artists and writers such as Georgia
O'Keeffe, Ansel Adams and D.H. Lawrence. Today Taos is a culturally
rich mecca for New Agers, spiritual seekers and wealthy city
escapees.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the steady swell of outsiders who clog the narrow
streets and alleys, residents here still live a trusting,
know-your-neighbor existence, mostly free from crime.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Taos officials face a delicate task: to remind citizens that
no American town is immune from criminal acts while not discouraging
the friendliness and accessibility that define small-town life.</TE>
<TE>   "When we discussed alerting people, we asked ourselves, 'Do you
want to start a panic?' " said Taos County Dist. Atty. Donald
Gallegos. "It's incumbent upon us as law enforcement officials to
tell people what the potential danger is out there and what steps can
be taken for safety.</TE>
<TE>   "We tell them, 'Don't give up your small-town mentality and your
culture, but open your eyes to the reality that there is big-town
crime here.' I'd like to say there isn't, but there is."</TE>
<TE>   The two slayings are the talk of the town at a time when locals
would otherwise be discussing the drought and whose children would be
performing at the fiesta. Amateur sleuths reveal their theories
across lunch counters. But it is the brutal manner of the deaths that
has unsettled many here.</TE>
<TE>   Marioara Shand, 38, of nearby Ranchos de Taos was killed first,
found July 9 face down in a pool of her own blood. Last Sunday, the
body of LeAnne Martinez, 23, of Taos was discovered. Both women, who
lived alone, were stabbed multiple times and their throats were slit,
police said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities now believe the two crimes, though similar, are not
related. On Friday, Taos County sheriff's deputies arrested Nathaniel
Duran on charges of murder in Shand's death. Duran, 18, lived next
door to Shand and is the grandson of her landlords.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a man who was seen driving Martinez's car is still at
large. Authorities said Richard Sabino Fresquez, a 23-year-old
recently paroled from prison, is being sought on warrants charging
him with parole violation and unlawful possession of a stolen
vehicle. Martinez's car was found abandoned in Albuquerque. The FBI
and the U.S. Marshal's Service are also involved in the
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The news that one local man has been charged with murder and that
another, although not officially a suspect in the second killing,
remains at large, has generated a wave of home security
consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   "My neighbor is 65 years old and she's been pretty upset," said
Gwynne Tyksinski. "She knocked on my door and said, 'Let's agree to
look out for each other.'</TE>
<TE>   "I was raised in Chicago and I'm pretty aware. There's the myth of
'mystical Taos,' the illusion that people see. [Tourists] come here
and see the mountains and the clean air and want it to be this
mystical haven. But we have trouble with alcohol, drugs and domestic
violence."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, a woman was raped, a kind of crime that resident Linda
Madrid chalks up to "women out at night running with a bad crowd."</TE>
<TE>   Gallery owner Nancy Bucholtz said Taos is no more unsafe than any
other town its size but that it is the perception of immunity that's
changing.</TE>
<TE>   "What's fueling the fear is that people here are not used to
crime," she said. "They don't lock their doors, they don't take the
simplest of precautions. Crime and violence can come into your home.
People here have to realize Taos is growing up. That's what's going
on."</TE>
<TE>   So far, few tourists seem to be aware of the murders, and Taos
remains free from common street crime that would deter tourism.
Indeed, on a recent day, streets were teeming with seemingly carefree
vacationers.</TE>
<TE>   But it's the psyches of residents that town officials are
concerned about. Thomas Lorenzen, Taos' new chief of police, is still
trying to determine how the murders will affect the town, so long
sheltered in the foothills.</TE>
<TE>   One thing the former Los Angeles Police Department officer is sure
of, it's time to reconsider the rhythms of small-town life.</TE>
<TE>   "It does kind of shatter our image of Taos," Lorenzen said. "This
is a wake-up call. The reality is we are not without crime. People
get lulled to sleep. Crime has come to small towns. That's the myth
of Taos. The real world has come to us."</TE>

<LD>Chris Weber, a single mother from the Washington area with a good job
in the documentary film business, has moved her investments out of
individual stocks and into mutual funds. She says she is trying not
to panic and, in the belief a recovery is inevitable, still puts
$3,000 every month off the top of her earnings into funds.</LD>
<LD>   "But it's horrific getting the statements," she says. "This fund's
down $10,000, that one $5,000. I e-mailed my accountant last week and
said, 'Al, this is getting really depressing. Shouldn't we be
thinking about getting out of some of these funds?' He said no, don't
sell at the bottom. Basically, I'm comfortable with that."</LD>
<LD>   Weber, 47, has held on to only four stocks--Pfizer Inc., Lucent
Technologies, Novell Inc. and Avaya Inc., all so battered that
selling would have been tantamount to giving them away, she says--and
believes the diversification of mutual funds offers her protection in
the long run.</LD>
<TE>   She shuns any high-risk funds and has brought her spending habits
in line with the new economic reality of her life.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't cut back on what I spend for David," she said of her
5-year-old son. "What I've done is cut back on my stuff. All the
usual stuff: No more shopping for shoes. No more shopping for
clothes. We go out to dinner less. When I bought my house, I'd
planned to remodel a bathroom. Now that's absolutely out.</TE>
<TE>   Weber has decided she won't put her life on hold waiting for the
markets to recover. Saturday, she and her son left their home and
headed north to Maine on a week's vacation she had budgeted long
before her mutual funds went sour.</TE>

<HD>Plans for Trade Center Site Get Public Airing</HD>
<DH>Meeting: With 5,000 New Yorkers under one roof, it was a
remarkable display of civility. 'This is a day that connects all of
us to ordinary citizens,' one official says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>It had all the trappings of a Big Apple nightmare: Put 5,000 New
Yorkers in a room and, with TV cameras rolling, ask them to vent
their opinions on how to rebuild the World Trade Center.</LD>
<LD>   But the high-tech town hall meeting Saturday was anything but
disorderly. In a remarkable display of civility, victims' families,
rescue workers, residents of Lower Manhattan and thousands of others
calmly dissected six development plans recently unveiled by the city.</LD>
<LD>   The reviews were mostly negative, with participants chastising
planners for creating drab, workmanlike blueprints lacking creative
vision.</LD>
<TE>   "We lost something precious on Sept. 11. It was like part of the
city was amputated, and we need imaginative plans to restore our
skyline," said Robert Friedrich, a ponytailed accountant who spent
the hot summer day quietly debating the future of ground zero with
fellow New Yorkers.</TE>
<TE>   "Not to be critical," retired political science professor Arthur
Galub said, in apology, sitting across from Friedrich at one of the
500 tables set up at Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, "but I don't
think that's the big issue at all. What about more open space?"</TE>
<TE>   It was a day when the quiet tapping of computer keyboards replaced
the brawls that often pass for public hearings here. As they sat in
groups of 10, participants pondered the blueprints floated by city
planners to rebuild 16 acres of prime Lower Manhattan real estate.
They registered support or disapproval for individual proposals on
hand-held computer keypads, and the results quickly flashed on large
TV screens suspended throughout the hall.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a day that connects all of us to ordinary citizens," said
Larry Whitehead, chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corp.,
which helped sponsor the meeting, one of the largest public hearings
ever held in New York City. "We're looking forward to hearing all of
your comments."</TE>
<TE>   Under the city's plan, New York will winnow the six
blueprints--which call for varying blends of office and retail space,
a memorial site and open space--into three competing proposals
sometime in September. A final design would be selected in December,
based in large part on the feedback planners get from a series of
public hearings.</TE>
<TE>   Judging by some of the early responses, however, officials may
have to return to the drawing board sooner than planned. New York
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani have
voiced opposition to the initial proposals, saying they are short on
imagination. Those views were echoed at Saturday's events, with many
saying the design lacked a "heroic" feeling.</TE>
<TE>   On the plus side for planners, more than 57% said it was very
important for the final plan to add a new, big symbol to the New York
skyline, an idea promoted by all of the blueprints. And 64% said they
wanted to hasten the project by designing a memorial in tandem with
other development, instead of delaying commercial and office
construction.</TE>
<TE>   More important, participants voiced broad agreement with planner
Roland Betts that a victims memorial, no matter how somber a
structure, should turn the World Trade Center site into hallowed, but
not morbid, ground.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody is treating this like a beauty contest, in which you have
to approve some ideas and vote thumbs down on others," said Carolyn
Lukensmeyer, president and founder of America Speaks, a firm that
sponsors such interactive events across the nation. She served as the
emcee of Saturday's meeting. "The main goal is to find out what
you're thinking."</TE>
<TE>   When asked what they disliked most about the blueprints, almost a
third said the New Jersey Port Authority, which controls the site,
should cancel the leases held by private developers to rebuild office
and retail facilities. The city should "start fresh" with
less-densely developed office structures, many said, and sponsor
more-affordable housing projects.</TE>
<TE>   "Why not?" asked Tomar Arnaz, a New Jersey college student. "Why
not take an opportunity to really dream big and do something very
special?"</TE>
<TE>   Some sponsors tried to discourage such thinking. When he spoke
about various development alternatives, Frank Lombardi, the Port
Authority's chief engineer, appeared to deliver a short lecture on
economic realities.</TE>
<TE>   "Some ask why these plans include so much commercial and office
space," he said. "But the site is not a blank slate. Last summer we
leased parts of the area for 99 years, and those parties have a right
to rebuild."</TE>
<TE>   Lombardi was referring to Silverstein Properties, which held a
lease to operate the twin towers, and Westfield America, which ran
the commercial real estate at the doomed site. Although Port
Authority officials insist they need to restore 11 million square
feet of office space that was obliterated when the two buildings were
destroyed, a host of critics strongly disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   Developer Larry Silverstein "is like a 900-pound gorilla in the
room," professor Galub said. "He limits the kind of planning we can
do."</TE>
<TE>   As she lobbied participants on the periphery of the large
convention hall, environmental activist Jenna Orkin said planners of
the meeting had ignored many competing concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole issue of environmental protection has been buried
here," she complained. "The air is still polluted, still contaminated
in Lower Manhattan, and many people are living with toxins in their
homes. But this meeting is talking about putting up new buildings as
soon as possible."</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, however, the event was rancor free. And a key
reason was that special "facilitators" sat at each table, guiding the
discussions and keeping the participants focused.</TE>
<TE>   The event was a bit overwhelming for Susan Nurre, a quiet,
Dallas-based facilitator. When New Yorkers at her table began
quibbling over which Lower Manhattan neighborhoods had the worst
early morning traffic congestion, her eyes glazed over. But she
remembered why she had come to the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard some victims' families say only they should have been
here, and I don't agree," Nurre said. "We all lost something on Sept.
11--not just victims, but people who had their hearts broken all over
the country."</TE>
<TE>   Approving the right design for the World Trade Center site is not
just a Manhattan decision, she added, "because the whole world is
watching."</TE>

<HD>Exceptions to the Pricey Hawaiian Holiday</HD>

<LD>Summer bargains to Hawaii aren't easy to come by, but you can find
exceptions to those high prices. One place to start looking is among
the specials offered by Pleasant Hawaiian Holidays, flying to Hawaii
from Los Angeles and San Francisco. For most of July and August,
rates for round-trip air and a five-night hotel stay near Waikiki
Beach come to $499 per person, double occupancy. Five-night stays in
Maui start at $629 from Pleasant Hawaiian, and on the Big Island at
$666.</LD>
<LD>   Rates go down after Labor Day. From the first week in September
through early December, a five-night package in Waikiki starts at
$443, with flights out of Los Angeles. Pleasant Hawaiian offers many
other packages that combine visits to two or more islands. Call
Pleasant at (800) 742-9244 or visit www.2hawaii.com.</LD>
<TE>   SunTrips allows children 2 to 17 to fly round trip with an
accompanying adult from Oakland to Honolulu for $149 to $199 on
certain days during July and August. (The company operates a
chartered aircraft from Oakland to Hawaii, so you need to factor in a
trip to Oakland to take advantage of SunTrips' rates. Round-trip
tickets will run about $105 each.) Based on kids using two such fares
but excluding the cost of going to Oakland, a weeklong vacation on
Waikiki Beach would cost $1,836 for a family of four, including
round-trip air fare from Oakland, transfers from the Honolulu airport
to Waikiki and seven nights' accommodation at the Aston Waikiki Beach
Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   If the family prefers to stay in the more laid-back precincts of
Maui, the total price at the Aston Maui Lu comes to $1,576 for two
adults and two children, this time including a rental car for the
week. Again, that's on a flight from Oakland. For reservations or
more details, call SunTrips at (800) SUN-TRIP (786-8747),
www.suntrips.com.</TE>
<TE>   Guided tours to Hawaii aren't usually inexpensive, but they can be
affordable when accommodations and transportation are kept simple.
That's the policy of Suntrek, whose clientele tours by vans in small
groups by day and camps in tents by night. Most of Suntrek's trips
take place on the U.S. mainland, but it offers one option in Hawaii:
a 15-day, 13-night tour that visits Kauai, Oahu and the Big Island.
Prices for the tour are $1,149 per person in summer, going down to
$1,079 for most of winter. You are also expected to chip in about $35
a week to a group food fund. Although transpacific air fare from the
mainland to Hawaii is not included, your flights between the islands
as well as entrance charges to national and state parks (including
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on the Big Island) are covered by the
package price.</TE>
<TE>   Passengers in a Suntrek group are expected to help out with
setting up tents, packing gear, preparing food and generally cleaning
up. Yet unlike some tour operators, Suntrek does not impose a maximum
age limit on its participants. Visit www.suntrek.com on the Web or
call (800) SUN-TREK (786-8735) for details and reservations.</TE>
<TE>   Some visitors to Hawaii might prefer to make their own independent
arrangements, usually by taking advantage of special offers by
Hawaiian chain hotels. Few of these properties have much character,
but they are often spectacularly priced.</TE>
<TE>   Marc Resorts, (800) 436-1304, www.marcresorts.com, which
periodically lists "super specials," will this summer be offering
rooms at the Marc Diamond Head Beach Hotel on Oahu, usually priced
from $185, for as little as $65 per double on certain days--and
that's a big savings.</TE>
<TE>   Or you can contact the large, popular chain of Ohana Hotels, (800)
462-6262, www.ohanahotels.com, whose special summer offers can bring
the cost of a night's lodging down to $69 per double room in a
high-rise Waikiki hotel. You can also ask Ohana to create a package
that includes car rental and/or meals.</TE>

<LD>We are cruising along the Rhine River past fairy-tale castles,
haunting ruins, villages of half-timbered houses and rows of
vineyards marching over steep hillsides; it's like a tantalizing mix
of Wagner's "Ring" Cycle and "The Sound of Music." Here and there are
campgrounds beside the river and sunbathers wave cheerfully as we
pass. It's only past 10 a.m., but the sun is already hot, and the bar
waiter struggles up the outdoor stairs to the top deck with the first
of many tray loads of cold beer he'll deliver this morning.</LD>
<LD>   Our fellow passengers on the Deutschland are mostly German and
British, with a sprinkling of Americans, Austrians, Swiss, French,
Italians, Russians, Romanians, South Africans, Mauritians, Portuguese
and Spanish. Menus and announcements come in German, English and
French. Guided tours and tour buses are divided into German/Spanish
and French/English, and we notice that the Russian family always hops
aboard the French/English bus, where their shy, serious 12-year-old
daughter in blond braids whispers translations to her parents. Since
all our excursions are included in the basic fare, attendance is
usually high. We take city tours of Dusseldorf, Cologne, Heidelberg
in Germany and Strasbourg in France, and go wine tasting along the
Moselle River in clean, air-conditioned buses that never seem
crowded.</LD>
<TE>   Our boarding in Amsterdam was one of the easiest we've ever done.
We got off the Thalys high-speed train at Centraal Station, went out
the back door and walked a few minutes along the sidewalk by the
river rolling our luggage behind us to the spot where the Deutschland
was moored. Although our cabin was not yet ready--we were an hour
early for boarding time--we were welcomed into the lounge.</TE>
<TE>   We found the Eurostar and Thalys as fast or faster than air
connections between cities, since the trains travel from mid-city to
mid-city, and much more comfortable, because we could get up and walk
around whenever we wished. Pairing surface train travel with river
vessel travel in Europe let us see much more of the scenery as well.</TE>
<TE>   Our six-day Rhine cruise aboard KD Rhine's Deutschland is the
heart of a 12-day package called "European Panorama," which also
includes a two-night stay in London with a city tour, a transfer to
the high-speed Eurostar "Chunnel" train to Paris, two nights in Paris
with a Seine River sightseeing cruise, and Amsterdam, where we
boarded the boat. The fare includes breakfasts in each city hotel,
and daily shore excursions, beer, house wine and soft drinks, plus
sparkling wine at breakfast and the captain's welcome board champagne
party. When we disembark in Basel, Switzerland, a transfer to Zurich
is included, so we can fly home or tour Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Departure dates for the 12-day package are July 17 and 26; Aug. 4,
13, 22 and 31; Sept. 9, 18 and 27; and Oct. 6. You can also book only
the Rhine cruise between Amsterdam and Basel, at prices starting at
$1,015 per person, double occupancy. Depending on the date,
departures can be made from either city. Prices begin at $2,695 per
person, double occupancy. Air fare between the U.S. and Europe is not
included.</TE>
<TE>   The Deutschland carries 182 passengers in 92 cabins, most of them,
like ours, at the water line. We have a pair of windows, one of which
can be opened at the top, but we were cautioned not to open the
window when the boat is in motion. Cabins have two lower beds, one of
them a sofa bed, the other a Pullman berth that fits into the wall
during the day. Storage space is adequate if not generous; what we
lack is enough drawer space. There is also an armchair, a small
table, a telephone, and built-in shelving. A color TV set picks up
local channels, CNN in English, and plays feature films in various
languages. A bowl of fresh fruit is replenished frequently.</TE>
<TE>   The washbasin is in the cabin, as in European budget hotels, and
the small, step-down bathroom has an easy-to-operate shower and
toilet. Our eastern European attendant fetches our laundry and
returns it, pressed, the same day, with a bright smile and a sizable
bill.</TE>
<TE>   The food is fairly rich and served in lavish portions; we find the
copious salad bar enough for lunch, although there are always soups
and two main dishes offered each day. (One day the choice was between
a baked potato lashed with sour cream and bacon or a veal piccata
Milanese with plenty of cheese and tomato sauce.) Self-service
continental breakfasts are laid out each morning, along with chilled
bottles of German sparkling wine and juices, and we can order eggs,
bacon and pancakes. Dinners began with appetizers, soup and salad, a
choice of two or three main dishes (all beef is from Argentina) and a
dessert, followed by fruit and cheese.</TE>
<TE>   The staff is mostly Eastern European and so very serious we can't
joke with them or they get confused. Our cruise director was a
handsome Romanian who speaks German, French and English, none of them
perfectly, in his announcements and presentations. We find his French
and German easy to understand because he never links words but
pronounces each one separately and distinctly.</TE>
<TE>   We find the best part of each day to be when we sit in one of the
lounge chairs by the railing (some of them are shady and some sunny)
with a picture map of the river so we can identify each one of the
more than three dozen historic castles and castle ruins on the banks
of the Rhine. No other river in Europe has such dramatic scenery
surrounding its castles, churches and medieval town gates.</TE>
<TE>   For a free color brochure and more information, contact a travel
agent or KD River Cruises of Europe at (800) 346-6525 or
www.rivercruises.com. To preview the Rhine cruise at home, order a
VHS format video for $12 shipping and handling fees via the toll-free
number above and ask for "Romance of the Rhine."</TE>

<HD>Deal of the Week: Death Valley</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Talk about extreme. The Furnace Creek Inn &amp; Ranch Resort in Death
Valley National Park, which has the lowest elevation in the U.S. and
often its hottest temperatures, is reducing already low summer rates
through August. The main reason is that the resort has unsold rooms
because fewer foreigners are visiting this summer, a spokeswoman
said. Displaying a sense of humor about the situation, the Furnace
Creek Inn, rated Four Diamonds by AAA, is offering rooms starting at
$134--matching what it says is the highest temperature ever recorded
in the valley. (The average July-August high is 115 degrees.) Rooms
at the inn usually start at $175 from May to October and $260 from
October to May. The Furnace Creek Ranch, rated Two Diamonds by AAA,
has rooms starting at $87--the average low temperature in July and
August. Rooms at the ranch usually start at $133 year-round. The
deal, dubbed the "Cool Hot Summer Special," is subject to
availability; a few dates are excluded. Ask for Booking No. 1215 for
the inn and No. 5335 for the ranch. (760) 786-2345,

erupting since 1983 on the southeast side of the Big Island, has
become more accessible to visitors in the last few weeks than it has
been in seven years, rangers and geologists say. A short hike from a
park road puts you within a few feet of molten rock. As many as 1,500
people a day make the trek, officials say.</LD>
<LD>   The Mother's Day Flow, named for the day on which it began, has
created a lava delta that oozes and morphs less than a mile from the
end of Chain of Craters Road. Using bright yellow flags and
reflectors, park rangers mark the shifting footpath to the flow each
day. They are on hand from about 10:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. along the
trail to answer questions and keep visitors from tumbling in fissures
and large cracks. Lava flow is unpredictable and can change course or
stop at any time, geologists say.</LD>
<TE>   The best time to visit is at night, when lava cascades down the
mountainside like a stream of bright fire.</TE>
<TE>   To avoid the crush, go after sunset when the crowds begin to thin
and parking at the end of the road opens up. (At sunset cars
sometimes have to park two miles from the trail head.) Sturdy shoes,
long pants, water and a flashlight for night hikes are recommended.
The trail's surface is uneven, and falling on hardened lava can mean
sharp cuts.</TE>
<TE>   For eruption updates and cautions, visit www.nps.gov/havo or call
(808) 985-6000. Park admission is $10 per vehicle.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Dreading the hassle of schlepping your steamer trunk through
airports? A couple of cruise lines are making it easier on their
customers by shipping their bags for them.</LD>
<LD>   Passengers booking the entire 108-day world cruise of Holland
America's Amsterdam, which begins Jan. 4 in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
can ship up to 100 pounds of luggage for free from their homes to
their ship stateroom in Fort Lauderdale and back from Los Angeles,
where the cruise ends. An excess baggage fee of $1 per pound above
100 pounds will be waived for certain cabin categories.</LD>
<LD>   Starting Aug. 15, the small, luxury Seabourn line will ship
luggage via DHL from passengers' homes to any of its ships'
embarkation points worldwide--for a price. The so-called "Personal
Valet" service varies by weight and destination. For instance, a
suitcase up to 30 pounds shipped from the U.S. to London will cost
$200, the line says.</LD>

<HD>San Francisco Square Reopens With New Look</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Compiled by Jane Engle</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Union Square, the heart of San Francisco's tony downtown shopping
district, will reopen this week after 18 months and a $25-million
redesign, its first since the 1940s.</LD>
<LD>   Little that is familiar remains. A notable exception is the
striking Dewey Monument, a 90-foot-tall Corinthian granite column,
crowned with a bronze goddess of Victory, that dates to 1903.</LD>
<LD>   Visitors will find a new, larger stage area, moved from the Powell
Street to the Post Street side, and new landscaping that has shifted
green space to the perimeter. Overall, there's about 20% less lawn
area, said Linda Mjellem, executive director for the Union Square
Assn. Four palms have been planted at each corner of the 2.6-acre
square, and gardens in the center have been replaced with 60
flowerpots around the square.</LD>
<TE>   The square is now handicapped-accessible from three corners
(formerly there were stairs at three of the four corners), and its
underground parking garage has an elevator that lets users exit onto
the square instead of across the street.</TE>
<TE>   The renovation is not complete. Still to come in the fall are four
light sculptures by R.M. Fischer, a visitor information center and
half-price theater ticket booth (the ticket booth is now in a
temporary facility); and a cafe next year.</TE>
<TE>   The purpose of the redesign was to make the square "more
accessible and more inviting," Mjellem said. She described the old
square as "intimidating," partly because of hedges that sheltered the
homeless and made it hard to see inside the park. The redesign has
been criticized, most recently in a letter to the San Francisco
Chronicle, as sterile and skimping on greenery. Visitors can make
their own evaluation starting Thursday, when the square reopens with
four days of concerts and other free events. (415) 391-2000,

<HD>Family Trip Insurance Takes to the Road</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Compiled by Jane Engle</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When most of us think "travel insurance," we're apt to see airplanes
and cruise ships and exotic locations. But a new plan that made its
debut this month covers something more modest: the family road trip.</LD>
<LD>   Travel Guard International, a Wisconsin-based company that claims
to be the largest travel insurer in the U.S., offers a "Travel
America Plan" that adds roadside assistance to the usual menu of
coverages, such as trip cancellation and interruption, medical
expenses and emergency medical evacuation and hotel overbooking.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike traditional plans, which are usually priced per person and
vary by the age of the insured and trip cost, the Travel America Plan
is $65 for one or two people (regardless of age), $109 for three or
four and $17 extra for each additional person. It covers trips up to
14 days within the U.S. and Canada only and limits payouts for trip
cancellation to $1,000, said company spokeswoman Carol Mueller. (800)

<HD>America West Clarifies Policy on Remarks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff and Wires; Compiled by Jane Engle</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>America West has clarified its policies after a July 8 incident in
which a passenger was escorted off an America West plane in San
Francisco and rebooked on another airline after she asked a flight
attendant, "Have you checked your crew for sobriety?"</LD>
<LD>   The question referred to an incident this month in Florida in
which America West fired two pilots arrested on charges of trying to
fly a jet while drunk.</LD>
<LD>   In San Francisco, the airline had cited security concerns for its
actions. But last week spokeswoman Janice Monahan said America West
erred in taking the customer off the flight. She said flight crews
are being instructed to "engage" customers who make remarks related
to airline safety "to try to determine the nature of the comment"
before taking any action.</LD>

<KH>Weekend Escape</KH>
<HD>A Hop Above Santa Barbara, Camp Cushy</HD>
<DH>At El Capitan Canyon, guests get close to nature without
really having to rough it</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GOLETA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>It's always a little sad when the great coast road strays inland.
There you are, blasting north on the 101, passing Ventura, passing
Santa Barbara, then, sigh, waving goodbye to the shoreline when the
freeway veers inland at Gaviota Pass. This landscape is gorgeous too,
but the beach is the beach.</LD>
<LD>   So it felt a little like cheating one Friday last month when, with
Santa Barbara fading in the rearview mirror and the great veer inland
just a few miles off, up jumped our destination.</LD>
<LD>   We were bound for the cabins of El Capitan Canyon, which sit by a
creek, pool and upscale country store about 20 miles north of Santa
Barbara, 115 miles north of Los Angeles. The canyon has no neighbors
in the city sense of the word--just the vast acreage of Los Padres
National Forest.</LD>
<TE>   Once we pulled off the 101, parked, checked in and stepped into
that country store, the cheating sensation only deepened. El Capitan
Canyon, for years a rustic campground, has gone fancy.</TE>
<TE>   These days the mile-deep canyon is devoted not to campsites, but
mostly to 100 cedar cabins with electricity, beds and linens,
kitchens, bathrooms and upstairs sleeping lofts for kids. (A few have
fireplaces and spa tubs.) El Capitan State Beach, reachable via a
freeway underpass, is a five-minute walk from the canyon entrance and
is usually staffed by a lifeguard. Although the canyon's lodging
offerings include 25 "deluxe safari tents" here and there on
permanent platforms, this is camping in the same sense that Universal
CityWalk is Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Not that I'm complaining. I'm a fan of wimp camping from way back.
When a San Francisco hotelier opened the ritzy Costanoa campground
near Half Moon Bay in 1999, I headed to Northern California within
two months and was won over almost immediately. The new El Capitan is
the same sort of largely domesticated animal.</TE>
<TE>   Although I do have a few niggles (which will follow) about prices
and logistics at the place, the big picture is a pleasant one: Since
new owner Chuck Blitz took over in 2001 and reoutfitted the
campground with all these comforts (and reduced its capacity from
about 3,000 to about 300), this is a good place to bring your spouse
or your children, sidle up to the Central Coast, sit around a
campfire and creep up a ridgeline trail without getting, you know,
dirty.</TE>
<TE>   By the time my wife, Mary Frances, and I arrived, it was
midafternoon on Friday, and we had been preceded by our friends Lois
and Michael and their daughters, 15-year-old Rachel and 13-year-old
Deborah. The first step was to drop off our bags and leave our car at
the lot near the entrance; parking is forbidden farther up the
canyon, and that contributes immensely to the countrified,
kid-friendly feel of the place.</TE>
<TE>   Though an employee told us the place was about 80% occupied, the
area seemed largely empty. The sun filtered down through the leaves
of old oaks and tall sycamores, a pair of hawks hung high overhead,
and the canyon walls were upholstered with thick brush.</TE>
<TE>   Our creek-side cabin cost more than others, but we figured we
would pay for a little better atmosphere. On arrival we were assigned
to No. 203. I immediately envied 204 and 205, where bushes and a bend
in the creek provided more privacy.</TE>
<TE>   Still, we had it pretty good: a clever cabin design that offered a
view of trees and sky from the bed, a porch with a pair of chairs, a
picnic table and fire ring out front, a microwave and coffee maker in
the kitchen, fancy shampoo and conditioner in the bathroom, and a
location not far from the cache of 25 one-speed beach-cruiser
bicycles that are loaned free to guests on a first-come, first-served
basis.</TE>
<TE>   The price for the cabin will give true campers sticker shock: $172
per night (marked down from $215 because of our auto-club discount).
That seemed a bit high to me, and I got crankier when we caught up
with Lois, Michael and the girls. They had settled into a plain old
"canyon cabin" that was virtually identical to ours but farther up
the canyon and farther from the (nearly dry) creek, amid a slightly
greater density of units. Their rate: $132.</TE>
<TE>   Next time, we probably will go for a canyon cabin, and we may wait
until fall, when the seasonal rates change. Nov. 1 to April 30,
weekend rates are 15% to 20% lower than in summer. The cheapest
option is a safari tent--no private bathroom and no sleeping loft--on
a weekday in winter. Or, if you really want to camp and don't mind
tussling for space through the state-park reservation system, (800)
444-7275, you can put up a tent at El Capitan State Beach for $12
nightly.</TE>
<TE>   With birds in the trees and the sun in the sky, it is possible to
put finances out of mind, and that's what we did Friday night. We
made dinner, sat at a picnic table and gnawed on hunks of cheese
while a blue jay flew tabletop sorties in search of bread crumbs.
After dinner, we pulled out the guitars and sang around the campfire.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the weekend was about that simple. We rode bikes to
the often-understaffed store, where we liked the trendy magazines and
books on adobe home design but marveled at "s'mores kits" priced at
$15.75. We sipped coffee on the porch. We sang and strummed and read.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of driving through the Santa Ynez wine country or fishing
from the pier at Gaviota State Beach about 10 miles north, we nosed
around tide pools Saturday morning (terrific sand crabs, mussels,
anemones and star fish), then again on Sunday. On Saturday afternoon,
we hiked about two miles on the occasionally steep Paradise Point
trail, which follows a ridge overlooking the canyon. Mostly, we were
very happy.</TE>
<TE>   But we did agree on a few suggestions for canyon management:
First, the place should offer better maps of the nearby trails. One
employee described a couple of them to us, but nobody mentioned the 2
1/2-mile biking and walking trail that connects El Capitan State
Beach with Refugio State Beach to the north--something I'd like to
walk or ride next time.</TE>
<TE>   Also, about the toilets: The private bathrooms in El Capitan's
cabins have an eco-friendly design that works like an RV's holding
tank. Typically, workers empty canisters every few days. But
sometimes, either through forgetful employees or a fume snafu in the
system, odors arise and afflict the innocent. (We weren't the only
such victims: "Ohh! I can smell it too," we heard a neighbor exclaim
one morning.)</TE>
<TE>   It's not a hard problem to solve. When we raised this issue with
the desk staff, workers were dispatched and the air was cleared. But
at $172 (or $132) at night, the scent of poo will not do.</TE>
<TE>   Before I begin sounding too grumpy, let me say also that late
Saturday afternoon, we grabbed a table in the group picnic area,
watched the canyon crew light a bonfire, then tucked into dinners
(including tomato-and-feta salad and twice-baked potatoes) prepared
by the store's vegetarian chef. We settled in with a few hundred
guests and day-trippers to hear Tom Ball and Kenny Sultan, who have
been playing acoustic blues in Santa Barbara County for more than a
decade. Dinner and concert were $15 per person. The food, the fire,
the music, the darkening sky--it was enough to make Sunset magazine
look like a gritty documentary.</TE>
<TE>   The last big test came Sunday as we prepared to leave. I asked the
girls to assess their weekend. Rachel liked the store and the picnic
area but not the long walk between her cabin and the store. Deborah
thought the Paradise Point trail featured no paradise and had no
point, but she liked "being able to look out the window and see
something that isn't manufactured." And they both loved the sleeping
lofts. In other words:</TE>
<TE>   Assuming all is OK with your pocketbook and the plumbing, thumbs
up on El Cap.</TE>

<TE>   Competitions include categories such as biggest bunny and largest
pigeon. The butter sculptures will include a life-sized cow. For
sustenance: 20 foods-on-a-stick.</TE>
<TE>   It's the Iowa State Fair, Aug. 8 to 18 in Des Moines, and it's the
state's largest tourist attraction. The event dates to 1854 (1886 at
its current location), and its grounds are listed on the National
Register of Historic Places. This year's fair will have the
traditional livestock shows, a Heritage Village exploring Iowa's
pioneer past, and grandstand entertainers such as Alicia Keys.</TE>

<TE>   The National Folk Festival, a traveling celebration of musicians
and craftspeople that dates to 1934, will be held Aug. 23 to 25 this
year along the Penobscot River in Bangor.</TE>
<TE>   This year's festivities will include the Cajun band BeauSoleil, a
hula dance troupe, puppets, break dancers, a New Orleans brass band,
Franco-Canadian step dancers and what's described as a Texas-Polish
polka band. Also planned: ethnic food booths, storytelling, parades
and crafts exhibits and demonstrations.</TE>
<TE>   Each year the host city celebrates regional heritage too. In
Bangor, the focus will be on the Abenaki tribes of northern New
England and Quebec, as well as Maine's fishing and logging
traditions.</TE>

<TE>   The Mountain Dance &amp; Folk Festival, a lineup of concerts Aug. 1 to
3 in Asheville, is considered the granddaddy of Southern folk
festivals.</TE>
<TE>   Begun in the 1920s, it has grown to showcase the best mountain
musicians, balladeers, cloggers and storytellers. All are focused on
keeping alive 18th and 19th century traditions of the Blue Ridge and
Great Smoky mountains. All concerts will be held at the Diana Wortham
Theatre.</TE>

<TE>   The city of Fall River is home to a large Portuguese and Azorean
population. So it makes sense that Fall River Celebrates America, an
event Aug. 8 to 11 along the historic waterfront, will kick off with
a Portuguese Night featuring dancing, music, traditional dress and
food. Think chourico (sausage), fava beans and malassadas
(doughnuts).</TE>
<TE>   A parade on Aug. 11, carnival and fireworks are also part of the
celebration. Year-round attractions on the waterfront include the
destroyer Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. and the submarine Lionfish.</TE>

<TE>   National Mustard Day, Aug. 3, is celebrated in a big way at the
Mount Horeb Mustard Museum. Main Street in this town, about 20 miles
southwest of Madison, is blocked off for the gala: free hot dogs with
a variety of mustards, mustard painting, mustard bowling, mascots
from the big mustard manufacturers, plus clowns and a band. The
museum displays more than 3,800 varieties of the condiment, and more
than 500 flavors (chocolate fudge, peanut, espresso) are available in
the gift shop.</TE>

the West Michigan Tourist Assn., maps out a 1,100-mile route around
Lake Michigan. It lists about 100 lighthouses, current and historic,
along the way. Much of the 45-page booklet is devoted to advertising
and promotional essays about areas near the lake. More detailed
descriptions of lighthouses can be found at www.wmta.org. (Click on

<HD>Fare Warning: Better to Be Safe Than Sorry and Sick</HD>

<LD>Savvy travelers know they must be careful in destinations where the
sanitation isn't up to standards: They don't drink the water, and
they pass up food from street vendors. They also know the mantra
about food in unknown regions: "Cook it, peel it or forget it."</LD>
<LD>   But just when road veterans think they know everything about
minimizing their risk of food-borne illness, along comes research
like the recent guacamole study: Texas researchers evaluated tabletop
sauces at Mexican restaurants and found that some were crawling with
disease-producing organisms.</LD>
<LD>   As surprising and disgusting as that was, it proves that food
safety is an ever-evolving challenge. To stay current, travelers
should consider checking in with their physician or a travel medicine
specialist before departing. They might also strengthen their resolve
to follow his or her advice; research shows that only 5% of travelers
earn a perfect score at observing food and drink precautions.
Travelers should also consider checking established Web sites,
including those of the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (www.cdc.gov) and the World Health Organization
(www.who.int), for bulletins and updates related to food dangers on
the road. WHO also posts "A Guide on Safe Food for Travellers" at
www. who.int/fsf/brochure/trvl1.htm.</LD>
<TE>   The recent Texas study is a good example of a newly recognized
risk. Researchers at the University of Texas-Houston Medical School
evaluated tabletop sauces from Mexican restaurants in Houston and in
Guadalajara, Mexico--including red sauces, green sauces and
guacamole. They found that 47 of the 71 sauces from Guadalajara were
contaminated with E. coli, a leading cause of traveler's diarrhea,
versus 10 of the 25 sauces from Houston. And the average level of
contamination was 1,000 times higher in the Guadalajara sauces.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is not just that the sauces often sit out on the
tables all day, says Dr. Charles Ericsson, director of the Travel
Medicine Clinic at the medical school and an author of the study.
Many customers' hands--some not clean--are in and out of the sauces,
he says, and the preparation may not have been sanitary to begin
with.</TE>
<TE>   He advises travelers not to eat the sauces in Mexican restaurants,
even if they are in chilled dishes. "Just because [the container]
feels cold doesn't mean the original ingredients weren't
contaminated," he says.</TE>
<TE>   To avoid other food-borne illness, Ericsson advises travelers to
"stick to freshly prepared food that is cooked and too hot to put in
your mouth" when served. Once it cools, it should be safe. Foods that
are too hot to taste are at about 160 degrees Fahrenheit or more, he
says--and that temperature should kill disease-causing organisms. If
a food meant to be served hot isn't, Ericsson advises travelers to
send it back.</TE>
<TE>   Salads are also "notoriously associated" with food-borne illness,
Ericsson says. Again, it has to do partly with the number of hands,
some unclean, that are in and out of the serving bowls.</TE>
<TE>   In general, table-service dining is safer from a
food-contamination point of view than dining at salad bars or
buffets, according to Christine Bruhn, an expert in food safety and
the director of the Center for Consumer Research at UC Davis.
Food-safety authorities in the U.S. advise restaurants to rotate
buffet foods in specific ways, such as removing an old tray of food
and replacing it with a new one, rather than pouring new food on top
of what remains in the tray, she says. But these are only guidelines;
the regulations vary from state to state.</TE>
<TE>   And you also need to watch the customers, Bruhn says. They have
been known to dip a finger in the salad dressing, for instance, to
evaluate taste.</TE>
<TE>   Choosing table service over buffet is probably wise, she says, for
anyone with reduced immunity--and that doesn't just mean those with
immune deficiency disorders. After about age 50, she says, your
stomach isn't as well equipped to handle contaminated food as it once
was.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Brian Terry, a Pasadena physician with a special interest in
travel medicine, tells his traveling patients that it's fine to eat
salads "if you're going to Japan, Western Europe or Canada." But in
developing countries, forget about salads, he suggests.</TE>
<TE>   In countries with poor sanitation, Ericsson tells travelers to
avoid most raw food. One exception, he says, is food that can be
peeled; contaminants will probably be eliminated with the skin.</TE>
<TE>   Some raw fruits are more likely to be contaminated than others,
Terry says: "Berries are notorious because there are lots of nooks
and crannies, and they are hard to clean."</TE>
<TE>   He tells travelers to be wary of dairy products in developing
countries because they may not be pasteurized. Skip the mayonnaise,
he says.</TE>
<TE>   And what about drinking bottled water? Can you be sure it's safe
everywhere?</TE>
<TE>   Regulating organizations are different in the United States and
overseas, says Stephen Kay, a spokesman for the International Bottled
Water Assn. In the U.S., bottled water is regulated by the Food and
Drug Administration and by individual state regulations. Other
countries may not agree to follow similar standards set down by the
World Health Organization.</TE>
<TE>   Bottled water beats tap water in regions of substandard
sanitation, but there's still no guarantee that a bottle bought
overseas won't have organisms in sufficient quantities to cause
illness, Ericsson says. He suggests choosing bottled water with
plastic rather than metal caps because "plastic caps are harder to
tamper with"--making it easier to spot a used bottle that has been
refilled with tap water by a profit-minded restaurant owner or food
vendor. Spending a little more for a brand name might be wise too, he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Terry tells his traveling patients not to drink from a carafe of
water marked "bottled water" in a hotel room in developing countries.</TE>
<TE>   According to the World Health Organization, other drinks, such as
hot tea, wine, beer, carbonated soft drinks or juices that are
bottled or otherwise packaged, should be safe.</TE>
<TE>   Ice cream can be contaminated, according to the World Health
Organization. If in doubt, pass it up.</TE>
<TE>   Fish and shellfish can contain poisonous biotoxins, the CDC says,
even when well cooked. Ciguatoxin, the most common type of seafood
biotoxin, is found in barracuda, red snapper, sea bass and many
tropical reef fish.</TE>
<TE>   Fish in the scombroid family, such as yellowfin tuna, mackerel and
bluefin, can cause poisoning because of high levels of a substance
called histidine in their flesh. When these fish are improperly
refrigerated or preserved, the histidine converts to histamine,
causing flushing, vomiting, diarrhea and itchy welts.</TE>
<TE>   Terry tells travelers to consider the source of the fish and
exercise common sense. If you're sportfishing in areas with
potentially contaminated fish, don't eat your catch. But if it's from
a hotel dining room, it's probably OK.</TE>
<TE>   Another commonly overlooked habit that can go a long way toward
reducing illness on the road, Terry says, is simple hand-washing.
"People don't wash their hands often enough," he says, sometimes
because they don't have access to soap and water before eating. "Take
along antiseptic towelettes."</TE>
<TE>   Travelers who decide to break a few rules--remember, that's 95% of
us--should consider packing an over-the-counter anti-diarrheal
remedy, Ericsson says, and asking their doctor for a prescription
antibiotic to take if diarrhea sets in.</TE>

<HD>A Natural History Lesson in Morro Bay</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN McKINNEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Morro Bay State Park is one of the most developed on the Central
Coast: a large campground and picnic area, an 18-hole golf course and
a marina with a cafe and kayak rentals. But the park's undeveloped
east side--former ranchland gone wild--beckons hikers with grassy
swales, scrub-covered hills and coastal live oaks.</LD>
<LD>   A well-signed trail system provides lots of options, including
"mini morros" (some unnamed) that offer fine views from easy-to-climb
promontories. For a panorama of Morro Bay, Morro Rock and the
estuary, hike up volcanic Portola Hill. I like starting on the Park
Ridge Trail simply because few hikers use this trail head.</LD>
<LD>   Just remember that parking is limited to half a dozen cars, and no
facilities are available. (The main eastern trail head, which has
plenty of parking, is a short distance north along South Bay
Boulevard.)</LD>
<TE>   To learn more about the bay's ecology, visit the state park's
Museum of Natural History. It closed in November to install 26 new
exhibits, which will make it the largest natural history museum in
the state park system.</TE>
<TE>   The $3-million modernization project is nearly complete, and the
grand reopening is scheduled for Aug. 4.</TE>
<TE>   "We're telling the story of the natural history of California's
Central Coast in a whole new and interactive way," curator Nancy
Dreher said. "The fabulous coastal view, the new exhibits and a new
nature hike program add up to a great experience for the visitor."</TE>
<TE>   Museum docents will lead "Half-Hour, Half-Mile Hikes" that explore
the bay shore and estuary. If the hikes are popular, they will be
offered regularly.</TE>
<TE>   Our hike this week, however, focuses on a different route: a loop
from Park Ridge Trail to Quarry Trail and the point atop Portola
Hill.</TE>
<TE>   Directions to the trail head: From U.S. 101 south of San Luis
Obispo, exit at Los Osos Valley Road and drive 9 1/2 miles. Turn
right onto South Bay Boulevard and go 2 1/4 miles to the Park Ridge
Trail parking area on the right. (If needed, you can find a larger
parking lot about a quarter-mile farther up the road.)</TE>
<TE>   The hike: From the Park Ridge Trail head, follow the path to
signed junctions with Live Oak Trail on the left and Crespi Trail on
the right. The latter, named for Father Juan Crespi (diarist for the
1769 Gaspar de Portola expedition along California's coast), is a
loop that meanders through grassland and offers fine views of Morro
Bay Estuary. This side trip will add two miles to your hike.</TE>
<TE>   Back on Park Ridge Trail, you'll see a tiny, unnamed morro before
descending toward Quarry Trail. Head west a short distance on Quarry,
then swing south on Live Oak Trail.</TE>
<TE>   From here, a signed summit trail less than half a mile long rises
up Portola Hill to the best views of Morro Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Retrace your steps to Live Oak Trail, where you will turn south
among handsome oaks. Rejoin Park Ridge Trail, head west and soon you
will be back at the trail head.</TE>

<HD>In an Era of Turbulence, Airline Satisfaction Rising</HD>
<DH>Recent polls show us mellowing about the industry we once
railed against--but we may have lowered our expectations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE ENGLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Do we still hate the airlines? Or only some of them?</LD>
<LD>   It seems like only yesterday that the clamor for "passenger
rights" reached sonic-boom level, as overloaded, overscheduled planes
struggled through labor strife and bad weather and languished on
tarmacs waiting for takeoff.</LD>
<LD>   Remember the prisoners of Northwest Airlines--thousands of
passengers detained inside jets for up to eight hours at the
snowbound Detroit airport in 1999?</LD>
<TE>   Much has happened since then. In this age of terrorists, "air
rage" has a new, darker meaning. And we're mellowing toward the
airlines we once railed against, if recent polls and statistics are
to be believed.</TE>
<TE>   We may not love to fly, but we're complaining less about it, and
we have a higher opinion of the industry.</TE>
<TE>   Sixty-three percent of Americans think airlines "generally do a
good job ... of serving their customers," according to a Harris
Interactive survey of more than 1,000 adults that was taken in May
and published last month.</TE>
<TE>   That is a hefty increase from the 51% who had a positive view in
last year's survey, taken about the same time, although still below
figures for 2000 (66%), 1999 (71%) and 1998 (78%).</TE>
<TE>   The increase moved airlines from ninth to fourth place in the
survey's rankings of 13 industries. We appear to like airlines more
than computer, drug, telephone and oil companies but less than banks
(No. 1), hospitals (2) and car manufacturers (3).</TE>
<TE>   The third annual Fortune/Roper Corporate Reputation Index, issued
earlier this year based on interviews in January and February with
17,000 U.S. adults, found a similar trend. "The public was much more
positive than in the previous two years," says John Gilfeather, vice
chairman of Roper- ASW in Harrison, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   The approval rating of the airline industry increased from 6.2 to
6.9 this year on a 1-to-10 index where 10 is the highest. The index
is based on respondents' overall impression of companies, not
specifics like leg room and flight delays, Gilfeather explains.</TE>
<TE>   Although improving, airlines are still toward the lower end of the
spectrum of the 51 industries in the index, he adds.</TE>
<TE>   Gilfeather and Humphrey Taylor, chairman of the Harris Poll/
Harris Interactive, say they can only speculate on the cause of the
airlines' newfound popularity; the reasons weren't in their surveys.</TE>
<TE>   In the Roper poll, hotels and financial services also climbed up
the index, making Gilfeather suspect a Sept. 11 effect. After the
terrorist attacks, "I think people said, 'We've got to stick
together. It's wrong to be hypercritical of anybody,' " especially
industries hurt by the crisis, Gilfeather says.</TE>
<TE>   Like Gilfeather, Taylor suspects a post-9/11 sympathy vote. He
also notes that the decline in passenger traffic may have reduced
rates of lost baggage and flight delays.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed it has.</TE>
<TE>   In May--the most recent month for which statistics are
available--major U.S. airlines logged the lowest rate of mishandled
baggage reports from passengers since the U.S. Department of
Transportation began collecting the statistic 14 years ago. The
figure, which includes complaints of lost, damaged, delayed or stolen
baggage, dropped to 3.32 reports per 1,000 passengers from 3.85 in
May 2001.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, most types of consumer complaints in the DOT report, from
"bumped" passengers to bad customer service, were down in May. The
total rate of complaints per 100,000 passengers on major airlines
dropped more than 27% between May 2001 and May this year. It was not
just that there were fewer complaints because fewer people have been
flying since Sept. 11; the rate per 100,000 passengers also was down
and has been throughout this year.</TE>
<TE>   The DOT report is even shorter on explanations than the pollsters,
but it's hard to escape this conclusion: Things are getting better in
the air. Still I wonder: Are things really getting better, or are we
just getting more tolerant?</TE>
<TE>   "Part of this is illusory," based on a change in expectations,
says Rolfe Shellenberger, a Palm Desert-based travel consultant and
longtime airline expert.</TE>
<TE>   Passengers, expecting a huge amount of hassle at the airport, are
pleasantly surprised when they don't find it and are therefore less
inclined to complain, in his view. Also, some of the anger that
passengers once directed at airlines "has been displaced onto the
security screening situation," says David Stempler, president of the
Air Travelers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   But it does appear that fewer flights--about 20% fewer since Sept.
11, by some estimates--mean smaller crowds at the airport, fewer
delays and therefore more satisfied customers. Most of our attitude
toward the airlines is determined by whether our flight is on time,
say Shellenberger and Mike Taylor, senior director of travel for
marketing information services company J.D. Power and Associates in
Westport, Conn. Taylor believes jets are spending less time parked on
the tarmac because of lighter traffic, even though DOT statistics on
late departures, which are based on when the plane leaves the gate,
have improved only marginally.</TE>
<TE>   Our attitudes toward some low-fare and smaller airlines border on
cuddly, compared with how we feel about the majors, according to
statistics reported in the monthly Consumer Reports Travel Letter,
whose July issue analyzes DOT complaint rates for 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Aloha, JetBlue, Midwest Express and Hawaiian fell below the
majors' average of 2.09 complaints per 100,000 passengers. Southwest,
which is low-fare but also among the 10 largest airlines, logged by
far the lowest complaint rate among the 14 smaller and discount
airlines for which the newsletter gives statistics.</TE>
<TE>   Not all the smaller airlines fared as well. AirTran Airways,
American Trans Air, Frontier, Midway and National were among those
with a higher complaint rate than the majors' average, according to
the newsletter.</TE>
<TE>   We seem to be voting with our boarding passes too. Last month all
the majors except Alaska Airlines (up 3.2%) and Southwest (up 4%)
continued to carry fewer passengers than during the same month last
year. By contrast, AirTran was up 23.4%, Frontier rose 5.5% and
JetBlue rose 110%.</TE>
<TE>   Smaller airlines are appealing because they often have better
fares--and simpler fare structures--than the majors, fly out of
smaller, less congested airports and have newer fleets, among other
advantages, notes Consumer Reports Travel Letter.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's the question of expectations. "Southwest doesn't
promise much, but what they promise, they really deliver," says
Stempler of the Air Travelers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, if you expect less, you complain less.</TE>
<TE>   Which might explain much of the current public sentiment on
airlines.</TE>

<LD>After two days at sea, the Olsons were in high spirits as they left
their cruise ship to explore the Caribbean island of St. Martin.</LD>
<LD>   Then 2-year-old Haley was hit by a truck.</LD>
<LD>   "I was right there," said Doug Olson of Racine, Wis., still
incredulous a year later. "One second was all it took."</LD>
<TE>   One second and the entire group--14 members of the extended family
were traveling together--was plunged into a vacation nightmare, made
worse because they were in a foreign country. Haley was conscious,
her leg badly injured. Someone called an ambulance, and the family
raced to a small nearby hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't even want to look at her at the hospital without cash
up front," Kim Olson said. "We had trouble getting an outside line to
call off the island. I was a complete basket case."</TE>
<TE>   Even the most minor mishap or illness--a sprained ankle in
Colorado, the stomach flu in San Francisco, an ear infection at the
beach--can wreak havoc with a family vacation. That's why it's
important to play the "what if" game before you go.</TE>
<TE>   What if somebody gets sick?</TE>
<TE>   "Treat a minor illness the way you would at home," said Dr. Tim
Vega, an Illinois family practitioner and spokesman for the American
Academy of Family Physicians.</TE>
<TE>   Make sure you have a thermometer and fever-reducing medication, as
well as first-aid supplies like antibiotic cream, adhesive bandages
and gauze.</TE>
<TE>   When traveling with kids to Third World countries, don't leave
home without anti-nausea and anti-diarrhea medication, and remember
that dehydration can become a major problem, said Kurt Kutay, founder
of the adventure outfitter Wildland Adventures, which sends many
families to exotic locales.</TE>
<TE>   Don't stubbornly adhere to a vacation itinerary if an ailing
family member isn't up to it.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't push a child to keep going if they really feel sick," said
David Fassler, a Vermont child psychiatrist. "It's important to make
sure a child doesn't feel like they've done anything wrong or ruined
the family's trip. Everyone gets sick sometimes."</TE>
<TE>   If the ailment is worse than a minor injury or illness but still
not an emergency situation, first call your pediatrician or family
physician at home, suggests Dr. Richard Wayne, medical director of
the Christus Santa Rosa Children's Hospital in San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   Physicians say that if someone in your family has a chronic
condition such as asthma or diabetes, it's wise to get a just-in-case
referral before you leave home and to carry a list of medications the
family member uses.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States and other countries with sophisticated
health-care systems, families can find medical help at a children's
hospital or university-affiliated medical center. And American
consulates abroad can sometimes refer American tourists to
English-speaking and Western-trained physicians.</TE>
<TE>   The Olsons weren't that lucky. The doctors on St. Martin couldn't
assess the true extent of Haley's injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "The medical equipment they had just couldn't compare to the
United States," Doug said.</TE>
<TE>   Even the ship's doctor who came to the hospital couldn't help.
That's when the Olsons became the poster family for travel insurance
when traveling outside the country. Haley's grandmother remembered
that the family had purchased a policy from a leading travel
insurance carrier.</TE>
<TE>   "We never considered the possibility of a medical emergency," Doug
said. "We just wanted to cover costs in case our luggage got lost."</TE>
<TE>   Within 36 hours of the accident, Haley and her parents were flown
to Miami, where orthopedists quickly discovered that she had multiple
leg and pelvic fractures and put her in a body cast. The insurance
covered the medical evacuation, the flight home from Miami and
Haley's follow-up orthopedic treatment for a year--more than $30,000
worth of coverage. The cost for the rest of the cruise was refunded.</TE>
<TE>   "This could have wiped out all our savings," Kim said. "I won't go
anywhere now without travel insurance."</TE>
<TE>   That's true of many travelers who are willing to pay hefty charges
(typically 5% to 7% of the cost of their trip) for travel insurance.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake the events of Sept. 11, insurers have added new
lower-cost policies to cover travelers who get stranded as a result
of a terrorist incident or face a medical emergency.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a new focus on safety," said Dan McGinnity, a company
spokesman for Travel Guard.</TE>
<TE>   Travel insurance policies can cover families if a child (or
parent) gets sick and the family can't go on the vacation they had
planned or if the family is forced to return home in case of
emergency.</TE>
<TE>   If you're traveling solo with children, some policies will provide
a chaperon for the kids in case you are incapacitated.</TE>
<TE>   The Web site www.insuremytrip.com highlights travel insurance
plans from different companies and lets consumers shop for the best
deal.</TE>
<TE>   Other choices:</TE>
<TE>   * Travel Guard is offering new "Sense of Security" plans. Call
(800) 826-1300 or visit www.travel-guard.com.</TE>
<TE>   * Access America offers "Travel With Ease." Call (866) 807-3982 or
visit www.accessamerica.com.</TE>
<TE>   * Travelex Insurance Services offers free coverage to children
younger than 16 if their parents have coverage. Call (800) 228-9792
or visit www.travelex-insurance.com.</TE>
<TE>   Jeanne Salvatore, vice president of consumer affairs for the
nonprofit Insurance Information Institute, warns travelers to make
sure they need the extra protection before signing on the dotted
line. She says these policies are an especially good idea for those
who have paid in advance for expensive trips or for those taking
active vacations during which they may face a higher risk of injury.</TE>
<TE>   As for the Olsons, young Haley has recovered from her injuries,
her mother said.</TE>
<TE>   "People always say it won't happen to them, but it can and does
happen to you," Kim said. "You've got to be prepared."</TE>

<LD>Thomas Curwen's nostalgic Huntington Lake feature ("Lakeside in the
High Sierra," July 7) more than did justice to this magnificent
wonderland.</LD>
<LD>   I was raised in Big Creek in the '40s and '50s and, amazingly, the
area has changed little. Especially all those wonderful
adventures--backpacking, fishing, hunting, trapping.</LD>
<LD>   The writer asked, "I wonder if the children who toast marshmallows
for s'mores today will have the same feeling 30 years from now." Yes,
Mr. Curwen, they will.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I was disappointed by your description of Huntington Lake as
scruffy and not as pretty as Bass Lake.</TE>
<TE>   At 3,000 feet, Bass Lake is a moderate-elevation lake surrounded
by forest. Huntington is a high-elevation lake at 6,950 feet, amid
10,000-foot-high peaks and a true alpine climate.</TE>
<TE>   God created the blue sky and water, the green trees and white
clouds. That combination never seems to get old.</TE>
<TE>   We in California are so blessed with high mountains, the oldest
and largest living trees and a great history.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks for a great article about a truly unique spot.</TE>

<LD>With reference to Carla Hall's "Downtown, a New Standard in Hip
Hotels" (Weekend Escape, July 7): Hall must have visited a different
Standard hotel from the one some friends and I visited. Instead of a
"hot hangout," I found the rooftop bar area provided inadequate
seating, rude waitresses, watered-down drinks and minute food
portions at exorbitant prices. Instead of "hip downtowners," I found
boys and girls playing at being "hip." The only part of Hall's story
with which I concur is the quote from a local artist, "Wow, you're
really slumming." That sums up my experience perfectly.</LD>

<LD>I am fascinated by Shirley Slater's and Harry Basch's ability to be
on the road for three months, each carrying nothing more than a
roll-aboard small enough to stow in the overhead and yet having
almost everything they needed for a Queen Elizabeth 2 crossing
("Dressing to Sail Takes the Gift of Garb," Cruise Views, July 14).
The QE2 requires a tuxedo or dark suit every evening, except on
embarkation night. That would indicate that ladies also need formal
attire.</LD>
<LD>   We have cruised for years, and as hard as we try not to overpack,
we have never been able to accomplish the miraculous feat of carrying
nothing more than a roll-aboard and carry-on camera/computer case.</LD>

<LD>Concerning "May the Road Rise With Volunteers Who Adopt a California
Highway" (Her World, July 14): I disagree with Barry Kaufman and Jan
Davidson's conclusion about why people trash highways. The reason is
obvious, based on their observation of the high percentage of
alcoholic beverage containers in the litter. The consequences for
littering are much less than those for driving with an open alcohol
container, especially if the driver is driving while intoxicated.</LD>
<LD>   I noticed the same distribution of litter on the section of U.S.
395 that I help clean. There were some things that fell off vehicles,
some fast-food trash and a lot of alcohol containers.</LD>

<LD>Kristine Kadlec, an Angeleno, recently sent me an e-mail that said,
"I always use public transportation. If I want to get out of the city
for one to two days, how do I do it without a car?"</LD>
<LD>   She is a traveler after my own heart, motivated by need or
desire--it doesn't matter which--to hit the road without driving.
Pure inventiveness, not gasoline, fuels trips for people like Kadlec.
They must lay their plans more carefully than those who throw their
suitcases in the trunk and take off. They have to rely on buses and
trains, ride bikes and walk, which makes getting around slower. Their
excursions can't cover as much territory as driving tours.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, it's like whispering into an amplifier at a rock
concert to tell Southern Californians to leave their cars behind when
they go on trips. Also, the hassles of plane travel have persuaded
more people to take driving vacations.</LD>
<TE>   But I can attest to the surprising pleasures of carless
travel--the way inventive planning pays off, the pleasures of going
slowly, the adventures caused by delays and the satisfaction of
really getting to know one manageable place.</TE>
<TE>   When I lived in New York City, I didn't have a car, but I still
used to get antsy to get away in the summer. Once, I took a lumbering
little local train to the leafy Victorian town of Spring Lake, N.J.,
for a weekend at the shore. Another time, I took a commuter train
from Grand Central Station to Tarrytown on the Hudson River to tour
Kykuit, the lavish Rockefeller family estate and gardens.</TE>
<TE>   Similar carless getaways abound in L.A. Here are a few:</TE>
<TE>   * Trains and more trains: Amtrak's Southwest Chief, Coast
Starlight, Pacific Surfliner and other California trains leave L.A.
from Union Station, the landmark railroad station downtown. Built in
the '30s in a blend of Spanish and Art Deco styles, it's a treat in
itself, with a restaurant and bar, a 135-foot clock tower and deep
leather seats in the waiting room.</TE>
<TE>   An overnight ride on the Southwest Chief takes you from L.A. to
Williams Junction, Ariz., where a free shuttle will take you to the
Grand Canyon Railroad Station in the town of Williams. The trip to
the canyon takes about two hours and ends paces away from the South
Rim. Once there, you can settle in at one of the historic South Rim
hotels or join a Grand Canyon Field Institute backpacking trip for a
more intimate experience of the Colorado River canyon.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara and Solana Beach are two to three hours from L.A. on
the Pacific Surfliner. The station in Santa Barbara is walking
distance from the beach, pier and downtown shopping district and a
handful of convivial little inns and B&amp;Bs. Heading south on the same
line, there's a stop at Solana Beach, where a free shuttle takes
passengers to and from beautiful Del Mar Thoroughbred Club, started
by Bing Crosby and cronies in 1937.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak trains like the Coast Starlight connect L.A. to Oakland and
Emeryville, where bus connections are available to downtown San
Francisco. My idea of an inviting long weekend there would be to
watch a video of Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 thriller "Vertigo," take the
train to the City by the Bay, where the movie is set, and check in at
a fancy Nob Hill hotel. The Huntington would fit the bill, with
doubles starting at $195. The San Remo Hotel, a European-style
pension nearby, is less, with shared-bath doubles for $55 to $75.</TE>
<TE>   * Outdoors with a group: The Sierra Club, REI Adventures and other
groups offer trips of all kinds into the great outdoors. I want to
try one with the outdoors outfitter Adventure 16, which offers such
wilderness expeditions as a six-day backpacking trip in the Inyo
National Forest, over Rohn and McGee passes, for $545.</TE>
<TE>   * Get away in the L.A. area: Almost every weekend I'm in town, I
fantasize about pretending I don't live here, packing a bag and
finding a wonderful little hotel where I can hide away. I did this
once in Culver City, where I went ice skating, ate Italian, heard a
free band concert and felt away from it all. Now I'm thinking of
checking in at the chic little Avalon Hotel on West Olympic Boulevard
(doubles $199 to $229), where, after listening to hipsters strike
deals while drinking martinis by the pool, I would explore Beverly
Hills. You could tour West Hollywood by staying at the reasonably
priced Standard Hotel on Sunset Boulevard (doubles $135 to $185) or
Malibu from a room at the Malibu Beach Inn on Pacific Coast Highway
(doubles $249 to $279, including continental breakfast).</TE>
<TE>   I could ride my bike to the lovely Ritz-Carlton Huntington Hotel
in Pasadena or the secretive Hotel Bel-Air. Do you suppose they have
valet parking for bicycles there?</TE>

<HD>St. Albans' Sacred Place in History</HD>
<DH>Outside London, Roman ruins and an ancient abbey hint of an
enchanting past in a quaint town that is too often overlooked</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN LEE</AU>

<DL>ST. ALBANS, England</DL>
<LD>I've lived in Tokyo, traveled on the Trans-Siberian Railroad and
built an igloo in the snowy wilderness of British Columbia, but the
only trip I make almost every year is to St. Albans, my hometown.</LD>
<LD>   These visits usually are about staying in touch with friends and
family. But last time, with a day to spare in January, I decided to
become a tourist--albeit one who knows his way around.</LD>
<LD>   St. Albans, 30 minutes northwest of London by train, is not as
popular as some other historic English towns. But it has at least as
much to offer, thanks to its rich, lively history. Here around AD 50,
the Romans built Verulamium, their third-largest settlement in what
is now Britain. St. Albans is also where the Magna Carta was drafted;
where England's only pope, Nicholas Breakspear (Adrian IV), was born
around 1100; and where King John II of France was imprisoned in the
14th century.</LD>
<TE>   Under a brilliant blue sky, I set off for the thousand-year-old
Cathedral and Abbey Church of St. Alban, known to locals as the
Abbey. At 550 feet, it's longer than two 747s nose to tail, and it
dominates the skyline like a giant too large for a quiet town of
about 67,000.</TE>
<TE>   The structure combines an unlikely array of architectural
features, from Norman to Victorian neo-Gothic. It was built in 1077,
11 years after the Battle of Hastings established the Normans as
rulers of England. But its story really begins circa 209, with a
soldier from Verulamium named Alban.</TE>
<TE>   Religious nonconformity was punishable by death in the Roman
Empire, but Alban converted to Christianity anyway. On a hill not far
from here, he was beheaded. Britain's first Christian martyr later
was canonized, and a vast abbey bearing his name was constructed near
the site of his execution. Rebuilt in the 11th century, the abbey
still contains the ancient red Verulamium bricks used in its original
construction. You can see these narrow bricks in the squat central
tower, one of the finest surviving Norman structures in the country.</TE>
<TE>   I found the cavernous abbey as cool and tranquil as I had
remembered. Strains of a rehearsing choir echoed against the walls,
and scattered individuals in silent reflection reminded me that this
is still a working church. Colorful and stylized 13th century Norman
paintings of biblical scenes have been discovered under layers of
whitewash on many of the towering pillars, which are still being
restored.</TE>
<TE>   The stone shrine, thought to contain the sacred remains of St.
Alban, also has been rehabilitated. It was smashed to pieces in 1539,
after Henry VIII violently ended the pope's jurisdiction in England
and encouraged people to ransack houses of worship. Pieces of the
shrine were recovered during excavations around the abbey in the 19th
century, and the structure is revered again.</TE>
<TE>   My favorite feature of the abbey has always been the creaky wooden
steps that lead to a platform overlooking the shrine. As a child, I
used to imagine I could see a solitary monk hidden in the shadows,
taking his turn at keeping a continual watch over Alban's remains.</TE>
<TE>   The abbey's Chapter House extension, opened by the queen in 1982,
houses a refectory with a friendly staff and home cooking. This is
the place for piping hot tea or coffee along with sausage rolls,
sandwiches and cakes. It's a comfortable and busy self-service cafe,
and tables often fill quickly.</TE>
<TE>   For a bird's-eye view of St. Albans, I made my way to the clock
tower, a short walk from the abbey toward the town center. The slim,
flint-faced structure was built between 1403 and 1412 and is said to
be the only free-standing medieval belfry in England. Residents
constructed the tower to assert their secular freedom in defiance of
the abbey, marking their own hours and sounding a curfew bell, an
important expression of political power.</TE>
<TE>   I climbed the 93 stone steps toward the top. To the right loomed
the abbey, representing the town's past. To the left, the current
population was engaged in a far more modern occupation: shopping.</TE>
<TE>   Shoppers have been coming to St. Albans' twice-weekly street
market since it was established more than a millennium ago. Started
as a farmers' buy-and-sell, the colorful market is now like an
elongated outdoor department store running the length of St. Peter's
Street, the town's main thoroughfare. Vendors at more than 170 stalls
offer antiques, secondhand books, shoe repair, jewelry, clothing,
fresh fish and gourmet pastries.</TE>
<TE>   The place brought back memories. When I was 18, I ran a stall
selling gaudily painted wooden duck ornaments, parrot-shaped earrings
and glow-in-the-dark surfing shorts. These imported Indonesian goods
were original and trendy, and profits were healthy most weeks. When
business was slow, I would wear the brightest pair of shorts on my
head and wander in front of the stall trying to drum up trade. On
this visit vendors didn't need to go to such great lengths; business
seemed brisk everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   It's a good idea to walk the length of the market and compare
prices before buying. If you don't want to fight a crowd, skip the
market on Saturday in favor of Wednesday, which is less busy, though
smaller. The best bargains in fresh fruit, vegetables and cut flowers
come as the market begins to wind down after 3 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   After snacking on a peppery brie-stuffed tart and packing away a
lattice-topped spinach pie for later in the day, I headed off in
search of more history. Because St. Albans wears its medieval
heritage on its sleeve, it's easy to overlook the earlier Roman
presence, remains of which lie away from the town center.</TE>
<TE>   The centrally located Museum of St. Albans covers the town's
history.</TE>
<TE>   Historians think the settlement of Verulamium was a vital outpost
of the Roman Empire. Extensive archeological digs between 1930 and
1934 showed that a sophisticated town stood here, housing hundreds of
people in dozens of brick homes that were palatial for the era.
Remnants of shops, temples and paved roads--believed to have stood
for 300 years--also were unearthed.</TE>
<TE>   The ruins are protected in 100-acre Verulamium Park, where the
foundations of buildings lie within gentle green hills. The only
visible evidence of the ancient town is a crumbling stretch of wall
and the outline of its London gateway.</TE>
<TE>   I found it hard to imagine the bustling settlement that stood
here, but a visit to the recently expanded Verulamium Museum quickly
solved that problem. Exhibits showcase hundreds of pieces from
everyday Roman life: coins, toys, clay pipes, glass vases, fine
jewelry and decorated earthenware pots. The museum puts the artifacts
in context by providing vivid descriptions and placing them in rooms
that depict a wealthy merchant in his townhouse, a carpenter busy at
work and a woman preparing food in her kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   The museum also houses some of the most intricate floor mosaics
found outside the Mediterranean. Carefully recovered from the buried
villas of Verulamium's most affluent citizens, these highly patterned
and detailed mosaics--some more than 10 feet across--depict Roman
gods and fanciful nature scenes.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby at St. Michael's Church lay more evidence of the Roman
occupation. Like a reclining skeleton, the ruins here are only a
vague outline of the Roman theater that stood on the site. But with
my imagination fired by the museum visit, I sat on a grass bank
facing the stage and, as the sun set, daydreamed of a chattering
audience awaiting the performance.</TE>
<TE>   Before the curtain fell on my day, I wanted one more glimpse of
the past. I found it at dozens of St. Albans' medieval inns, built to
serve horse-drawn coaches passing through the town on their way to or
from London. Many of these public houses still operate, and some even
retain their coaching yards and stable buildings.</TE>
<TE>   To learn about their colorful history, I took a self-guided
walking tour with a booklet from the local tourist information
center. I looked in on the cozy, Tudor-framed Rose &amp; Crown and Six
Bells pubs, a short walk from the Roman theater. Then I trekked back
toward the center of town, passing the 19th century Black Lion Inn
and the leaning timber walls of the Tudor Tavern, a 100-year-old bar
in a 400-year-old building.</TE>
<TE>   I learned that King John II of France had been briefly imprisoned
near the Fleur de Lys pub after his capture at Poitiers in 1356, and
that a ghostly brigade of Roman soldiers reportedly had been seen
marching through the basement of a local inn.</TE>
<TE>   Some of St. Albans' best pubs are hidden on back streets, away
from the large, bustling establishments in the central part of town.
The Lower Red Lion on Fishpool Street is a great spot for beer
drinkers. It has a celebrated selection of ales, including rare and
unusual beers from smaller breweries. On warm summer evenings,
patrons enjoy their drinks outside at the Blue Anchor, a short walk
from the Verulamium museum. The Garibaldi, unlike most pubs here,
serves dinner--gourmet meals, actually, and a popular Sunday roast.</TE>
<TE>   I finished the day with a drink at Ye Olde Fighting Cocks, so
named because it used to be a venue for cockfighting.</TE>
<TE>   It's said to be the oldest public house in the world. Although the
current building is Tudor in design, the original structure was built
in 950. The low ceiling at the bar, built in an age when people were
shorter, forced me to stoop to place my order.</TE>
<TE>   Appreciation for one's hometown often comes with age and
reflection. As I sat at a dark wood table, I vowed that on my next
visit to St. Albans, I would reserve more time to explore it.</TE>

<HD>On Iona, Scotland's Lore and Legends Come Alive</HD>

<AU>ROSEMARY McCLURE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The tiny Scottish isle of Iona is so remote that you need to take a
train, two ferries and a bus to reach it from Glasgow or Edinburgh.
Once there, you find it has just two roads, one pub and a few working
farms.</LD>
<LD>   So what kind of tour group would spend six days in such a place? A
tour group for people who appreciate the art of storytelling.</LD>
<LD>   Although the Hebridean island of Iona might lack big-city
excitement, it makes up for it with an abundance of mysticism and
history. Legend has it that Macbeth is buried there, along with a
host of other Scottish kings, saints and Viking warlords. Legend also
has it that when the world is covered with water at Judgment Day,
only Iona will rise above.</LD>
<TE>   Maryland resident Bob Wilhelm, who has a doctorate in
storytelling, regularly leads tours to Iona. "We set out each morning
with our walking sticks and go to different parts of the island," he
said. Once there--on the cliffs or moors or sandy beaches--stories
are told: Celtic and Viking stories, folk tales, legends and myths.</TE>
<TE>   The tour is scheduled Oct. 5 to 10. Other upcoming Storyfest
Journeys include Ireland, March 9 to 15; and Iceland, May 27 to June
2.</TE>
<TE>   Cost: $2,271 per person, including lodging, meals and seminars on
the island. Transportation to the island and air fare from Los
Angeles to Scotland are not included.</TE>

<HD>Enjoying Alaska at a Glacial Pace</HD>

grizzlies that roam through town</DH>

<DL>YAKUTAT, Alaska</DL>
<LD>As the Cessna six-seater droned comfortably along, we adjusted our
headsets so we could hear Les Hartley, the pilot. "Look for the
mountain goats," he urged. No goats came into view.</LD>
<LD>   But what we did see was far more impressive. To the east,
brilliant in sunlight, was snow-wrapped Mt. Fairweather. To the west
was the sharp, 18,008-foot peak of Mt. St. Elias, dominating a spiky
range of mountains. Below was such a labyrinth of rivers and lakes
that many are unnamed.</LD>
<LD>   Soon we were over Russell Fjord, a long green inlet lined with
Sitka spruce. As we flew down the length of the fiord, the water
turned milky with glacial flour, the fine rock dust that ice grinds
from the stone below it. At the outlet of the fiord, stretched out in
front of us, was the great, fractured ice tongue of the Hubbard, the
largest tidewater glacier in North America.</LD>
<TE>   Of the various kinds of glaciers, tidewaters are what many
tourists think of when Alaskan ice comes to mind. They flow down
mountain valleys and end in the sea, where they break off--or
calve--great chunks of ice into the water. The Hubbard wends its way
76 miles through the St. Elias Range to spread out as a six-mile-wide
ice cliff that eventually stands 300 feet above the water of
Disenchantment Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Most visitors come to Yakutat for the fishing and hunting. I came
for the glaciers, partly because I'm writing a book about these
still-mysterious ice rivers.</TE>
<TE>   Alaska has thousands of glaciers, and Glacier Bay, more than 100
miles southeast of Yakutat, is the place most non-Alaskans connect
with images of the distinctive light-blue ice. Yet some of the
largest, most dramatically active and most thoroughly studied
glaciers in the world ring this tiny town. This is why the annual
meeting of the International Glaciological Society has come to
Yakutat--and why I've come here too.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the tidy decks of the cruise ships navigating Glacier Bay,
Yakutat also offers visitors a chance to experience an older, less
developed Alaska. It is a village of 800, with a few dozen commercial
buildings tucked among the trees. It has one taxi, one bank, a lot of
wildlife and genial folk who haven't made their town into a tourist
concession. Local people wave to one another, and they will to you
too.</TE>
<TE>   And so I was in a small plane flying over the glaciers with a
bunch of glaciologists, the people who study these icy behemoths.
Hubbard Glacier is causing a great hubbub around town this summer
because it is within about 100 feet of closing off the mouth of
Russell Fiord for the first time in 16 years. When it does this,
tributary streams entering the fiord create a freshwater lake behind
the ice dam. The opening is already so constricted that the fiord has
risen by a couple of yards. In 1986, when complete closure last
occurred, an international effort developed to rescue harbor seals
and porpoises trapped in the new lake. But the ice barrier broke
apart on its own six months after it formed, liberating the beasts.</TE>
<TE>   For the moment, the Hubbard is only threatening. And on this June
evening under the summer Alaskan sun, which will keep the land light
until almost midnight, an impressive dozen of the world's best-known
glaciers slid into view under our wings.</TE>
<TE>   We were now crossing Disenchantment Bay, named in 1791 by Spanish
explorer Alejandro Malaspina when he turned the corner from Yakutat
Bay and saw the forbidding face of Hubbard Glacier instead of the
fabled Northwest Passage. Valerie Glacier comes next, then Haenke,
then Turner, which is streaked with dirt and a jumble of broken ice.
Some of these glaciers carry so much dirt and rock on their
surface--a meter or more of what glaciologists call moraine--that we
often seem to be flying over expanses of bare earth. Only the glint
of blue ice in crevasses and potholes reveals the glaciers beneath.</TE>
<TE>   Finally there is the great, round Malaspina Glacier, a variety
known as a piedmont glacier, which looks like a chunk of Antarctica
and covers more surface than the state of Rhode Island.</TE>
<TE>   After a couple of hours that pass in an instant, we leave the
glaciers and head back to Yakutat, crossing over Monti Point, where
world-class surfing draws its own class of visitors.</TE>
<TE>   Yakutat is a predominantly Tlingit village. It's in the southern
region of the state, in the temperate rain forest along the Gulf of
Alaska, a different and far wetter world than Anchorage or Fairbanks.
The average annual rainfall in Yakutat is 85 to 130 inches. Snow may
fall nine months of the year. Spring temperatures are in the 40s and
50s; summer often reaches the high 60s.</TE>
<TE>   Though glacier gazing is becoming more popular, the big draw for
visitors is the fishing: sockeye, silver and king salmon; the
world-famous steelhead, actually an oversized rainbow trout; and
halibut that can weigh more than 250 pounds. When hung up on a dock
for a photograph, a Yakutat halibut can easily be taller than the
person who catches it.</TE>
<TE>   Others show up for hunting: bear, mountain goats, moose, geese and
ducks. A few come for whale watching, or for hiking the Tongass
National Forest, or for the relics, scattered around town, of
Yakutat's role in World War II. One such artifact is the Yakutat
airport runway, the second longest in Alaska because it was built to
handle large military aircraft, to deter a Japanese invasion.</TE>
<TE>   The village is strung out, without a conventional center of town.
Most buildings are outposts among the trees; it's a five-mile hike
from the airport at one end to Leonard's Landing, a hotel compound at
the other. Consider renting a car if you don't like walking and don't
want to rely on the vans at your lodge, or on the town's single taxi.
Cell phones don't work here, and many lodgings offer only a pay phone
down the hall. Be sure to ask about Internet access if that's
important. Monti Foods, a grocery store, has an ATM that usually
works, but don't count on it. Alaska Pacific Bank is open from 10
a.m. to 3 p.m., weekdays only. The Postal Service, U.S. Park Service
and Forest Service have offices in town.</TE>
<TE>   I stayed at an inn with a far better view, Leonard's Landing
Lodge, on the other side of town. If I were traveling with a small
party, I'd be tempted to find out whether rooms were available at one
of the several bed-and-breakfasts around town, particularly the Blue
Heron Inn. The Blue Heron is spotless and well run, and its dining
room offers a knockout view of Mt. St. Elias and Mt. Logan.</TE>
<TE>   I had a good time at Leonard's Landing, however, where the
glaciology conferees bunked. It's on a promontory at the entrance to
Yakutat's small-boat harbor. Walking around town was a delight,
particularly along Max Italio Drive, next to the water. I saw blue
heron, auks, kingfishers, woodpeckers and a moose. Other visitors saw
a black wolf. Wild strawberries, elderberries, high-bush cranberries
and blue lupines were everywhere. The summer ponds were full of lily
pads, bald eagles were commonplace overhead, mosquitoes were frisky
and bears could be seen hanging around town. Southeast Alaskans speak
of "brown bears," which to the rest of us are known as grizzlies.</TE>
<TE>   The week I was there, the Alaska Department of Fish &amp; Game issued
a notice: "Over the past few days, a female brown bear and her three
yearling cubs have been seen numerous times along the road near the
Sunrise apartments in Yakutat.... Adhere to basic bear safety
etiquette." In fact, my first day in town, I and many of the
scientists watched the mother grizzly and her cubs lolling around
next to the main road. Everyone took pains to observe bear etiquette,
which includes making noise, giving bears plenty of space and never
running from a bear. And the bears hung around town in peace. They
became an amiable common topic for the rest of the week: "Have you
seen the bears today?"</TE>
<TE>   If you're here during a holiday, you may see an exhibition of the
St. Elias Dancers, a young troupe of Tlingits who perform traditional
dances. I was lucky this time and saw the group present dances that
were as much as 1,000 years old. The Tlingit believe in the "people
of the glacier," David Ramos, a tribal leader, told the audience.
Each glacier has a spirit, "and they're not nice when they come out
of the glaciers," he said. To placate them, Ramos recommended not
cooking food in front of the glacier--the glacier people are partial
to human grub--and offering tobacco, hard candy and prayers.</TE>
<TE>   Avoiding all affronts, later in the week I took a charter boat to
see several of the glaciers. It's about a four-hour trip from
Yakutat's small-boat harbor to the snout of Hubbard Glacier and back,
with plenty of time along the way to admire porpoises, harbor seals
and otters floating idly on their backs.</TE>
<TE>   Early on a Saturday, John Alder, a former Coast Guard rescue
crewman who grew up in Long Beach and Orange County, skippered a fast
fishing boat of the Yakutat Charter Boat Co. across 17-mile-wide
Yakutat Bay and into Disenchantment Bay. There he maneuvered into the
middle of the water, amid chunks of floating ice calved from Hubbard,
Valerie and Turner glaciers. Alder shut off the engine and turned up
his CD player. I might have picked Beethoven, but he chose Enya, the
Irish singer known for delivering New Age chants in Celtic and Latin.
It turned out to be an oddly appropriate choice as we drifted
peacefully in the unearthly splendor. "Usually you can hear the
Turner Glacier growling, but it's quiet today," Alder noted.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the floating ice hunks were the size of houses, though all
were too small to be considered true icebergs. A confusion of
superficial currents kept each chunk of ice waltzing by in a
different direction, as at a stately but mad tea party. Each floating
island was a unique creature--some striped with moraine, others
clear, others snow white, others glacial blue.</TE>
<TE>   One especially large blue hunk the size of a railroad car had
melted on its underwater side to the point that it was unbalanced.
Just a few yards away from our small boat, it suddenly turned
upside-down in a majestic roll.</TE>
<TE>   Alder leaned over the railing and pulled out a clear,
bread-basket-size chunk--"for cocktails tonight," he suggested.
Later, in a glass of water, the 200-year-old ice made occasional
popping sounds as trapped air bubbles, formed long ago at a higher
elevation, burst. It served well in a celebratory cocktail.</TE>
<TE>   I was reminded of a Tlingit phrase, "Ee tu si xan," which tribal
leader Ramos had translated with a grin as "We love you guys." I felt
much the same about Yakutat, its low-key people and those mammoth
glaciers.</TE>

<LD>If the Swiss ran the world, trains and planes would be on time. Every
hotel room would have a view, and reservations would never be lost.
Communicating would be easy because the Swiss seem able to speak
whatever language you greet them in. You would never have a bad meal.
In fact, nothing bad would ever happen.</LD>
<LD>   To the casual observer, the Swiss run their country with a
by-the-book precision that is no empty cliche, as I discovered last
month spending a week in Zermatt, a mile-high village in the heart of
the Alps. A winter skiing center so close to Italy that you can get
there by lift, Zermatt is wedged between mountains at the end of a
deeply cut valley, with the fabled Matterhorn looming to the
southwest, solitary and singular. In summer when the snow melts and
the wildflowers bloom, it is a classic Alpine postcard of a place,
cozy, traditional, family oriented, right out of "Heidi."</LD>
<LD>   Just getting there is a sightseer's delight and a lesson in Swiss
managerial expertise. I flew to Zurich airport, which has a railway
station. A ticket clerk confirmed the schedule I found on the
Internet before leaving home, complete with the train and track
numbers for my two connections to Zermatt.</LD>
<TE>   The last leg of the six-hour train trip was on a trunk line that
follows the cloudy, glacier-fed Vispa River, hugging the
mountainsides, crossing and recrossing the waterway like a
high-strung filly. There is a road through the valley as well. But
cars are allowed only as far as the hamlet of Tasch, about five miles
north of Zermatt, where drivers must leave their vehicles and
continue by train or electric taxi, which is a little like a golf
cart.</TE>
<TE>   Horse-drawn carriages and whining electric cabs wait outside the
train station in Zermatt to take arrivals to their hotels, most of
which are Alpine chalets with balconies and flower boxes, the models
for the phony ones you see in tourist traps. Then you look up and
gasp as you see the Matterhorn, too boldly sculpted and invincible to
seem hackneyed. You find yourself repeatedly going to the window to
make sure it's still there.</TE>
<TE>   My room at the immaculate Hotel Biner, where I stayed the first
two nights, had a balcony with a view across Zermatt's vegetable
gardens and slate roofs to the Matterhorn. I had booked a double for
$145, including breakfast, but when I arrived, the front-desk clerk
said I should take a single for $66. It wasn't the money; it was as
though he felt it only right that a solo traveler stay in a single
room.</TE>
<TE>   I loved the view and the orderliness of the room, which had simple
pine furniture, a single bed covered with a duvet and a full bath
with faucets that took me awhile to figure out. The breakfast buffet
was a typically Swiss fortifying feast: muesli, fruit, hard-boiled
eggs, cold cuts, cheese, rye bread, pastry and good, strong coffee.</TE>
<TE>   During my first evening stroll, I quickly discovered that this
village of 5,600 isn't as small as it seems, sprawling up the sides
of the valley. Cranes were poised over the central square where a
hotel conference center is being built, and Bahnhofstrasse, the main
artery, has Benetton, Patagonia, a Swatch outlet, myriad outdoors
outfitters and kitschy souvenir shops where tourists buy Swiss Army
knives.</TE>
<TE>   Bahnhofstrasse is intersected by winding alleyways lined with
old-fashioned larchwood storehouses and stables. Chalkboards outside
restaurants advertise traditional Swiss fare: fondue, raclette (a
melted cheese dish), rosti (like hash brown potatoes). The signs are
in German, which predominates in Zermatt although the village is near
the French-speaking section of Switzerland and just across the
mountains from Italy.</TE>
<TE>   In the mornings it is clear why people come to Zermatt in the
summer. There is skiing at high altitudes, where snow always clings
to the mountains. It is also a mountain walker's paradise, where the
risks are few and the pleasures of the scenery great. They come out
after breakfast with rucksacks and walking sticks and head toward
paths that lead to meadow-encircled hamlets with lonely little
chapels, then upward to tundra, Alpine lakes, scree, snow and ice.</TE>
<TE>   The mountains nearby look as steep and forbidding as the Grand
Tetons of Wyoming or the Canadian Rockies. But the hand of man has
made them extraordinarily accessible by a network of railways, ski
lifts and cable cars, including the highest in Europe, which
terminates at 12,533 feet near the top of the Klein (or Little)
Matterhorn. Sightseers can take an aerial cableway or train into the
mountains and walk back to the village, downhill all the way.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, serious Alpinists come to Zermatt, complete with
crampons (spikes attached to hiking boots for snow and ice) and ice
axes, to climb the 14,691-foot Matterhorn or nearby peaks considered
technically harder, like Dent d'Herens and the Weisshorn. In season
and in fair weather, 200 climbers a day sometimes reach the top of
the Matterhorn, usually with a Swiss mountain guide from the Alpin
Center in town. Blind climbers, amputees, 90-year-olds and a French
violinist who played Bach on the summit have all made it up the
Matterhorn.</TE>
<TE>   The mountain is a demanding climb, testing the most experienced
Alpinists and striking fear in the hearts of those who know its
tragedies. The first and most unforgettable of these occurred July
14, 1865, the day the Matterhorn was finally conquered, after a party
of seven climbers, led by Englishman Edward Whymper, successfully
raced for the summit against a team of climbers approaching from the
Italian side of the infamous Alp. Whymper's group was coming down
from the top, roped together, when one man lost his footing and fell,
dragging three others to their deaths. Then the rope broke, saving
Whymper and two Swiss guides.</TE>
<TE>   Strangely, the accident put Zermatt on the map, attracting
mountaineers from everywhere, above all Britons during the Victorian
era. And Zermatt still has a decidedly English air.</TE>
<TE>   The Hotel Monte Rosa at the center of the village bears a plaque
commemorating Whymper, who stayed there before his bitter victory.
Above it is poised little St. Peter's Anglican church, built in 1869
for English climbers and fresh-air vacationers. It contains the
remains of Charles Hudson, the Lincolnshire clergyman who died on the
first ascent of the Matterhorn with others in the Whymper party.</TE>
<TE>   I spent more than an hour in Zermatt's Alpine Museum, below the
English church. It has a stuffed mountain goat known as an ibex; a
topo model of the Monte Rosa massif, which bounds Zermatt to the
south; and a room devoted to Alpine tragedies. Most compelling to me
was the rope that broke on the first ascent of the Matterhorn, frayed
and weak-looking in its case, and a letter written by Whymper shortly
after the calamity, saying of the mountain, "Now the very name of it
is hateful to me."</TE>
<TE>   The next day I walked about 45 minutes to the hamlet of Blatten,
really just a cluster of rustic houses and stables. There I had a
picnic lunch of soft cheese on a rye croissant from the grocery in
Zermatt, while I waited for clouds to disperse around the Matterhorn
so I could photograph it.</TE>
<TE>   I walked for about half an hour on to Furi, which has a lift
station. There I got into the car to Klein Matterhorn. At the last
minute, I changed my mind for no particular reason and switched to
the car to the Furgg lift station, underneath the Theodul Glacier. I
realized as soon as the door closed that I had left my camera behind.
I told the attendant about it in French, then in English and then in
frantic sign language. Patting my shoulder, he told me in one of
those languages--I don't remember which--to go on up to the
Schwarzsee lift stop on the Matterhorn's shoulder, then said, "Ciao."</TE>
<TE>   There's something about Swiss men you don't want to contradict, so
I did as I was bidden. On the way, I joined a group of Japanese
tourists, who spoke English and commiserated with me about the loss
of my camera. "Yes, yes, an Olympus," one of them said, shaking his
head dramatically.</TE>
<TE>   At the Schwarzsee stop, near the bottom of the Matterhorn's
easiest ridge to climb, there's a hotel with, as usual, pristine
public bathrooms and a cafe where I had a cup of tea. While
contemplating the stupendous scenery, I thought how civilized it was
of the Swiss to provide mountaineers with places like this. No need
to get grubby and camp out. Indeed, there's a hotel even higher on
the Big M, the Belvedere, at 10,700 feet.</TE>
<TE>   After an hour's respite at Schwarzsee, I went back down to the
Furi station. There the attendant returned my camera, which had
ridden up the Klein Matterhorn in the other car without me. When my
new Japanese friends saw it hanging from my shoulder, they applauded.</TE>
<TE>   This little expedition was hardly enough conditioning for the
Matterhorn, but trying a little Swiss snow and ice climbing appealed
to me nonetheless. The clerk at the Alpin Center in Zermatt said the
hike up the Breithorn, a 13,685-foot peak, was easy, starting at the
Klein Matterhorn cable car stop and ascending 1,456 feet to the
summit. So I booked a trip (for $93) with a guide and two other
people, then went to an outfitter in town to rent crampons, a
climbing harness, gloves, a ski pole and an ice ax.</TE>
<TE>   The weather was perfect. I made it to the top of the Breithorn in
shirt sleeves. From there I saw the valleys that push into the Alps
from Italy; Zermatt to the north; the Matterhorn completely unveiled,
as if on a coin; and, far to the west, Mont Blanc.</TE>
<TE>   That, however, is the only positive thing I can say about an
otherwise miserable experience. Urs, my happy, helpful Swiss mountain
guide, who said he had climbed the Matterhorn 200 times, could have
put Spanish Inquisition torturers to shame. Maybe I overestimated my
fitness and underestimated the need to get used to the altitude and
the challenges of the climb. But after we made it over the shoulder
between Klein Matterhorn and the Breithorn in hiking boots and put on
crampons, I faltered. With every step, my feet sank into the snow,
which is to be expected but makes the walking hard, especially on an
incline.</TE>
<TE>   "Urs," I cried, "can't we go a little slower?"</TE>
<TE>   "If we go any slower," he said, "we stop."</TE>
<TE>   Then he tugged the rope that connected us, not gently. I kept
trying to joke with him, but apparently he didn't share my sense of
humor.</TE>
<TE>   At the top I plopped down on the Breithorn's snowcap and ate a
protein bar, and for awhile I felt exhilarated. But by the time I was
back down in Zermatt, my body felt like a junkyard, I'd caught a cold
and my face was burned because I hadn't used sunscreen.</TE>
<TE>   Walking adventures that were more pleasant followed. I moved for
two nights to the Hotel Riffelberg, at the third-to-last stop of the
Gornergrat railway. You can see it from Zermatt below, sitting in
splendid isolation above the tree line at 8,471 feet, on an Alpine
meadow dappled by wildflowers and marmot holes.</TE>
<TE>   There I paid $92 a night, including breakfast and a four-course,
set-menu dinner, for a single room with a carved pine bedstead and
armoire, TV, telephone, full bath and casement window.</TE>
<TE>   The morning after I arrived, I took the train to its terminus
beside the Gornergrat glacier, where there's another hotel,
restaurant and snack shop. Outside the station, several enterprising
Swiss had set up a photographic concession, taking pictures of
Japanese tour groups with sleepy Saint Bernards wearing whiskey kegs
around their necks.</TE>
<TE>   Back down one stop, I got out to walk, making my way carefully
along a muddy path to Riffelsee, a lake that reflects the Matterhorn
like a mirror. Just as I got there, I slipped and landed in the mud,
which coated my backside from collar to heels. So I lay down on a
rock by the lake to dry off. Soon an elderly Englishwoman ambled down
the path, followed by her husband, who came over to me.</TE>
<TE>   "I must tell you a story," he said, then described how he and his
wife had gone walking shortly after they married.</TE>
<TE>   At one point she sat in a pile of deer scat, but he didn't want to
trouble her so he didn't mention it. "All the way up the mountain, I
followed the green blotch," he said, laughing merrily at the memory.</TE>
<TE>   This encounter put me in a perfect frame of mind for my last two
days in Zermatt at the venerable Hotel Monte Rosa, where the service
is faultless and a sense of decorum prevails. It opened in 1839 and
has long been favored by vacationers from Great Britain.</TE>
<TE>   There's a pocket bar on the first floor with red tartan wallpaper,
lined with vintage prints of mountains and climbers. The second floor
has a billiards room and library. My single room on the third floor,
about $148 including breakfast and dinner, had a balcony and elegant,
traditional European furnishings.</TE>
<TE>   The afternoon I checked in, the management held a cocktail party
for guests, complete with beautiful canapes served on a silver
platter. There I met a cast of characters out of an Agatha Christie
novel: sedate English couples; a large, ruddy Scot; a Frenchman and
his wife who stayed at the fringes of the group; a family from New
Hampshire with three strapping teenage daughters; and a man from
South Carolina who had been coming to the hotel for 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   The South Carolinian sat at a single table next to mine in the
dignified dining room, where the place settings had more forks than I
knew what to do with, the butter came in little rosettes, and there
was a cheese cart. The meal was a lavishly served and presented
five-course affair, featuring potato cream soup, English roast beef
and rhubarb tart. To accompany it, I ordered a split of Valais Dole
des Monts, a Swiss red that seemed tasty enough until my American
friend offered me a glass of Chateauneuf-du-Pape, an exquisite French
red prized by oenophiles. I sat musing.</TE>
<TE>   I had climbed the Breithorn and sat by the Riffelsee. Still, the
Swiss had remained mostly unknowable to me, though their country
really does run like a Rolex. Meanwhile, there was such good humor
and conviviality in the dining room at the Monte Rosa, full of happy
tourists doing what they love in a magnificent setting, that these
people and this meal remain my fondest memory of Zermatt.</TE>

<DH>The cast of Lifetime's 'For the People' feels right at home
in the L.A. that it depicts: a place of many races and beliefs</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whereas the broadcast networks continue to struggle to bring
diversity to their prime-time series, cable seems to embrace
multiracial casting--especially Lifetime. The network's two current
Sunday evening series, "Strong Medicine" and "The Division,"
celebrate ethnic diversity, as did the earlier series "Any Day Now."</LD>
<LD>   The practice continues with Lifetime's new drama series, "For the
People," premiering Sunday. Set in Los Angeles' district attorney's
office, the hourlong drama examines the divergent backgrounds and
political philosophies of the dedicated attorneys and support staff
who work to uphold justice in the City of Angels' melting pot.</LD>
<LD>   Lea Thompson plays Camille Paris, a liberal who has worked her way
up the career ladder to become the chief deputy-assistant district
attorney. Debbi Morgan is Lora Gibson, the newly elected district
attorney, an African American and a staunch Republican. A Martinez
co-stars as Camille's ex-husband, a public defender, and Cecilia
Suarez plays the ambitious new head prosecutor, who, like her boss,
is a conservative.</LD>
<TE>   Thompson says one of the reasons she was drawn to the series was
because of its commitment to diversity. She had always wanted more
diversity in her previous series, the NBC sitcom "Caroline in the
City," which was set in a very lily-white New York. "But it seemed so
difficult," she remembers. "This is more like the real world. It's
much more interesting to have different people and energies in the
room. It's much more fun and dramatic."</TE>
<TE>   The crew, she adds, is also "more diverse than any other crew I
have seen in terms of women being represented and different
directors--we'll have a woman director and then an African American
director and a Latino director."</TE>
<TE>   Morgan echoes Thompson's sentiments. "I don't think we have quite
seen it on television before," she says. "I am wondering if it would
happen on network television even now. It makes it seem like real
life because that is what we see everyday, but it's not represented
on television."</TE>
<TE>   The actress feels her character is a groundbreaking role for an
African American. "It really seems to be the first television role
for a female of color that is so comprehensive," says Morgan. "Even
if a role like this does happen to pop up, it is relegated to only a
section of the character's life, most often her professional life.
But with this character, you get the full scope of her life, from her
position as the newly elected district attorney to a warm and loving
home with an adoring husband and two daughters. We know that very few
dramas have provided a life at home between a black husband and
wife."</TE>
<TE>   Catherine LePard, the series' creator and executive producer, says
she just wanted the series to reflect the ethnic diversity of both
the D.A.'s office and Los Angeles. Lifetime, she says, has been very
supportive of her commitment to diversity both in front of and behind
the camera.</TE>
<TE>   What also sets "For the People" apart from most legal series is
that it examines what LePard calls the district attorney's role as
"protector" of the justice system.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just about the conviction rate; it is also about
maintaining the integrity of the system," she says. "If they know
something that may cost them a conviction but uphold the system, they
have to reveal this kind of information."</TE>
<TE>   LePard modeled Morgan's character very loosely on President George
W. Bush's national security advisor, Condoleezza Rice.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan jokes that she didn't have "any personal Republican
friends" to talk to about her character's political leanings. "She
is, like, 360 degrees away from me," she says. "She is not your
conventional black professional woman. I see this woman as an
individualist--a free thinker and probably somewhat of a maverick in
the sense that she is a black woman working to break free from the
notion that all blacks belong to the Democratic Party."</TE>
<TE>   "For the People" can be seen Sundays at 10 p.m. on Lifetime. The
network has rated the premiere episode TV-PG-LV (may be unsuitable
for younger children, with advisories for coarse language and
moderate violence).</TE>

<KH>ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE</KH>
<HD>Dory Fleet Must Face Realities</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Newport Beach's dory fleet has weathered storms, a massive oil spill,
hard economic times and the continued urbanization of Orange County.
But the colorful fleet isn't likely to survive if an emergency ban
adopted June 20 leads to an indefinite prohibition against fishing
the continental shelf off Southern California. The uncertain future
is a painful reminder for dory men that, when it comes to keeping the
Pacific healthy, it's necessary to think globally but act locally.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists who study offshore fish populations say the time for
debate has ended, that it is time to protect bottom-dwelling fish. Of
16 types of rockfish studied off the California coast, nine have been
grossly overfished. It will take several decades of protection before
the rockfish species, often sold at markets and restaurants as red
snapper, will be able to recover.</LD>
<LD>   Those who have watched fishermen pilot their 18-foot boats through
the pounding waves--or held their breath as an open boat surfs back
to shore--have glimpsed Orange County's past. The last working dory
fleet on the West Coast has been anchored in the shadow of Newport
Pier since 1891. Outboard engines have replaced oars and sails, but
dory men still use mile-long lines studded with thousands of hooks to
catch fish--removing their catch by hand while battling the elements.
Said one veteran: "It's always been a tough buck."</LD>
<TE>   Dory men have been drifting away from the fleet for decades in
search of less dangerous and more predictable work. Some left after
the 1990 oil spill off of Huntington Beach fouled a popular fishing
spot.</TE>
<TE>   Just six dory men remain, down from nearly 20 a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   The fleet's catch represents a small and steadily declining
fraction of the state's $550-million annual fish harvest.</TE>
<TE>   Dory fishermen probably are right to blame depleted fish
populations on larger commercial fishing operations. But scientists
who monitor fish populations say stocks are so severely depleted that
it no longer matters who's doing the fishing.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard not to feel sympathy for men whose livelihoods are
threatened by regulations. But commercial fishermen who head to sea
in small boats seem destined to go the way of the area's
once-plentiful orange groves and, as The Times reported last week,
the cowboys who long have ridden the county's now-disappearing
ranchlands.</TE>
<TE>   It would be easy to demand that the federal government exempt the
dory fleet, with its long and colorful history, from the ban. But if
scientists' studies are to be believed, a ban is necessary to ensure
the long-term health of the overall fishing industry--no matter if it
prohibits huge trawlers trailing massive nets or a six dory men using
their hands to pull fish from the ocean.</TE>

<HD>Tollway Agencies' Bid to Skirt Rules Is Shameful</HD>

<LD>Re "Activists Decry Plan to Bypass Tollway Rules," July 12:</LD>
<LD>   The attempt by the Transportation Corridor Agencies to exempt
itself from all California laws is unprecedented and dangerous. This
stealth move, attached as a "rider" to a federal military bill, would
place the proposed southern extension of the Foothill toll road
literally above the law.</LD>
<LD>   Whatever one thinks of this controversial project, exempting it
from the California Coastal Act, our water quality, public health and
safety regulations, the California Environmental Quality Act, and the
California Endangered Species Act bespeaks a remarkable disregard for
due process and public participation.</LD>
<TE>   When the ruin of popular San Onofre Beach State Park is at stake,
the TCA should have more respect for the public than this shameful
ploy suggests. For the TCA, the end apparently justifies the means.
TCA board members should rein in this out-of-control bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Chandos</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There is language in a military appropriations bill before
Congress that would exempt the proposed Foothill South toll road from
regulatory oversight by the Coastal Commission or any laws that might
affect roads through state parks.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Dianne Feinstein needs to help protect Camp Pendleton and our
state park from the financially risky and environmentally damaging
toll road. This legislation would harm Camp Pendleton's training
mission in order to build a toll road that the TCA doesn't even know
it can afford.</TE>
<TE>   Camp Pendleton is endangered by urban encroachment, a problem that
the Foothill South toll road would only make worse. In fact, the
Marines are only reluctantly agreeing to study the route that would
affect San Onofre State Beach. They would prefer the road not be
built through the park or the base.</TE>
<TE>   TCA always prides itself on fulfilling requirements of
environmental law. If that's the case, why are they seeking this
special exemption from all California law? Aren't we all equal under
the law or is this just more special treatment for the privileged
few?</TE>

<TE>   Re "Tollway Trial at a Dead End in California," July 7:</TE>
<TE>   The fundamental question that the article fails to answer is who
will pay for new roads to keep pace with a soaring population? If the
choice is between privately financed tollways, where users pay their
own way, or new roads, where all taxpayers bear the burden of higher
gas-tax rates, then the choice is obvious.</TE>

<TE>   I would like to commend you for your coverage of the toll road
controversy. To this reader, your coverage has been balanced and
frequent enough so the issue does not get resolved without public
awareness.</TE>
<TE>   I don't understand why those traversing specific routes should be
the only ones paying for road service. If we charge for using some
routes, then we should charge for all similar routes. If the state
makes some revenue, that's OK in lieu of taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, this may be fair but it is contrary to what would be
accepted by voters and probably not in the best interests of any of
us. The conclusion I draw is that toll roads should not be an option
for California.</TE>

<TE>   Wow, I'm always amazed at how short the Los Angeles Times' memory
is. Back in the 1980s when there was no money to build highways, the
state formed the TCA joint powers authorities to obtain private
financing to build desperately needed roads the state couldn't and
wouldn't provide.</TE>
<TE>   My quality of life in San Clemente dramatically improved the day
the San Joaquin Hills toll road opened in 1996 and my husband no
longer had to spend close to two hours each way grinding through the
El Toro Y commuting to Costa Mesa. I can't wait for Foothill South to
open to take the pressure off Interstate 5 through my beach
community.</TE>
<TE>   This so-called "failed experiment" of three TCA toll roads has
200,000-plus daily riders paying for a better ride than they can get
on the freeways. Don't confuse issues of bond financing with market
success.</TE>

<TE>   For those of us living in crowded south Orange County, a proposal
to place a tollway down the middle of the San Onofre State Beach
campground has been a continuing nightmare.</TE>
<TE>   The toll road arrangement may be threatened, but undoubtedly
interests wishing to carpet the pristine countryside of inland south
Orange County will exert pressure on the Legislature to approve some
sort of highway through land that was designated as open space and
habitat to myriad birds and wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   Californians now understand that promises of reduced traffic
congestion are merely the blandishments of developers who will ensure
the return of congestion to each new highway, by surrounding it with
densely packed housing on postage stamp-sized lots. Highways are the
ventricles feeding overdevelopment. Better solutions to our
transportation needs can and should be developed.</TE>

<TE>   Re "O.C. Toll-Road Boards Move Closer to Merger," June 6:</TE>
<TE>   In actuality, the extension of the Foothill South will create
another El Toro Y problem that will be in our backyards and will not
solve traffic problems.</TE>
<TE>   What the Transportation Corridor Agencies and Chairman Scott Diehl
are pushing will mean more congestion on the southbound Interstate 5
in San Clemente. The northbound Interstate 5 is no problem, but
southbound traffic is not going to get any better regardless of what
the TCA and San Clemente City Hall bunch have to say.</TE>
<TE>   What the pundits failed to address in their shiny information
sheet is that the TCA has overstated traffic demand while grossly
understating financial resources needed to pay for the Foothill
South. Pouring more and more concrete does not solve the capacity
problem envisioned by the TCA and San Clemente City Hall.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Freeway Atop Rail Line Offered as 91 Relief," July 11:</LD>
<LD>   I read with great amusement The Irvine Co.'s silent admission of
the seriousness of Orange County's ground transportation gridlock
problem, and their stack-'em solution to the problem. The Santa Ana
Canyon Y has by far the worst gridlock in the county, second to the
El Toro Y. Both of these major gridlock areas can be attributed to
none other than the Irvine Co. in its greed to build out its
90,000-acre Irvine Ranch property.</LD>
<LD>   Apparently, the company's trademark "Better planning goes a long
way" statement hasn't been read by Donald Bren, the company's
ruthless, unseen owner. The company's four-legged cattle occupying
the original Irvine Ranch never contributed to the county's gridlock
problem. The ranchers of the day had unlimited open space. Thanks to
Bren and his developer friends' grand master plans, not only is the
county bursting at the seems, so too are our ground and air
transportation infrastructures.</LD>
<TE>   So how did the company arrive at the ground transportation
stack-'em alternative? No doubt they got the idea from their
stack-'em and pack-'em luxury apartment developments sprouting up
faster than weeds after a rainstorm. What's the company's next
alternative? A double-decker second county airport atop John Wayne
Airport?</TE>
<TE>   It's time for the company to take responsibility for the nightmare
traffic problems it has inflicted on all us residents and freeze
their remaining future developments until the transportation problems
have been adequately addressed. Isn't Bren rich enough yet?</TE>
<TE>   Russell Niewiarowski</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Heights</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I share the skepticism of the Irvine Co. regarding the solutions
to congestion on the Riverside Freeway discussed in the article. I
would like to offer what I know is a shockingly radical alternative.
The Irvine Co. and its fellow developers could cease building
$500,000-and-up five-bedroom mansions for the privileged few and
instead build affordable housing in Orange County for those of us who
work here and provide the services and labor that keep the region
afloat. Then most of Orange County's middle-class workforce wouldn't
have to commute from the hot, smoggy Inland Empire housing tracts to
which the county's politicians and developers have consigned them.</TE>
<TE>   Gayle K. Brunelle</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I do not know what the Irvine Co. is thinking, but we do not need
to destroy our nature and quality of living any further?</TE>
<TE>   Constructing that freeway atop the rail line between Orange and
Riverside counties will not only look awful but will destroy the
already precarious quality of life of hundreds of families living
next to that railroad line.</TE>
<TE>   I think the Riverside Freeway has room enough to accommodate four
more lanes. On top of that, why don't we learn from advanced
countries like Canada where the central lanes are shifted in
direction according to the needs of the traffic? In the mornings,
give more lanes to the west-bound traffic, and vice versa for the
afternoon.</TE>

<HD>Vouchers Won't Solve Public School Problems</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Voucher Revision," July 13:</LD>
<LD>   At first glance, Burt Becker's proposal for a revised version of
school vouchers seems like a good idea. However, one of the problems
inherent with the school voucher system is the fact that private
schools have a choice as to which students they will accept. They do
not want and will not take the slow learning, unruly and least
motivated kids. This is one reason why a voucher system is not the
solution to the inadequacies found in some public schools.</LD>
<LD>   Becker's proposal is based upon the often erroneous assumption
that private schools provide a better education than public schools.
Hopefully, Times readers also read the commentary by Ray Richmond ("A
Public School Wins Top Marks," July 14) regarding his son's success
in a public school (in the lowly Los Angeles Unified School District
of all places!) My children have also received an excellent education
in public schools. We have been in the Capistrano Unified School
District for 12 years, and I would choose my children's public
schools over any local private school.</LD>
<TE>   I know many parents who have tried both private and public
schools. Most of them have come back to the public schools, not
because they were dissatisfied with the private schools, but because
the money they were spending was not providing a better education.</TE>
<TE>   With all the voucher proposals I have seen, none appear to
guarantee that "difficult" children (including special-education or
special-needs children) will be accepted by quality public schools.
This issue alone should be enough to table the voucher issue forever.</TE>

<HD>At Issue Is Separation of Cottonwood and Cypress</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Cypress Suing to Block Initiative," July 12:</LD>
<LD>   This is despicable behavior by one of our cities. I can't believe
that for the years that property was vacant, the city didn't want it.
Now that a church [Cottonwood Christian Center] has purchased it,
they decided to use eminent domain laws on it.</LD>
<LD>   If they succeed, this is a violation of separation of church and
state laws. The whole reason our founding fathers started this
country was to keep the government out of church affairs and vice
versa. What will the government be able to do next, tell [us] that
saying "One nation under God" in the Pledge of Allegiance is
unconstitutional? Oh, they did that.</LD>
<TE>   They kicked the name of God out of the public eye and now they are
kicking out people who believe in him from their own land. This is an
abomination and a threat for all churches and religions. First the
Christians, then Muslims, then Hindus, then Buddhists and the list
goes on. It starts here, but it will not stop here. What if the
Cypress City Council decides your land looks like a good place for a
7-Eleven? Say goodbye.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Petitions May Be for Cottonwood ... or Not," July 7:</TE>
<TE>   On a daily basis I see misrepresentations regarding the Cypress
vs. Cottonwood land use issue.</TE>
<TE>   People should investigate their facts a little better before
forming their opinions, rather than relying on the propaganda
campaign that has been so successfully waged by Cottonwood Christian
Center.</TE>
<TE>   This is not a church being seized. This is a piece of vacant land
speculatively purchased in spite of prior notice and warnings that it
was the prime plot in a specific plan in a redevelopment zone, and
could not be used for church purposes without approval of a
conditional use permit that was not likely to be granted due to
preexisting redevelopment plans.</TE>
<TE>   While anyone can buy land, even convicted felons serving time in
prison, the land comes with all the existing benefits and burdens.
This organization bought the vacant land in spite of being on notice,
presumably confident that they could conjure up enough political
pressure to strong-arm their will upon the citizens of Cypress.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, in light of the L.A. Times' position espoused in its
editorials, their plan is working quite well.</TE>
<TE>   Additional facts are as follows:</TE>
<TE>   Cottonwood sells itself as a poor little local church being picked
on by a powerful municipality. Nothing could be further from the
truth. It is high time that Cottonwood be exposed for what it is: an
opulent televangelist organization akin to the Trinity Broadcasting
Network minus the glitz and perpetual Christmas lights.</TE>
<TE>   Cypress is not preventing Cottonwood from practicing its religion.
In fact, they are encouraging them to continue to do so at their
wonderful existing facility in Los Alamitos.</TE>
<TE>   Cottonwood had opportunities to buy acceptable land within the
same general area but declined.</TE>
<TE>   Cottonwood claims 400 of its worshippers live in Cypress, a
dubious claim. But even if true, this is only about 0.8% of Cypress'
population.</TE>
<TE>   It is irrelevant that this happens to be a religious organization.
They were warned, they ignored such warnings, and they have forced
the city's hands on this issue with their first-strike lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Cottonwood has been fairly deceptive during this entire process.
They failed to adequately inform their congregation of the
speculative nature of the land purchase.</TE>
<TE>   Their Citizens for Property Rights group supposedly gathered many
signatures under false pretense.</TE>
<TE>   Cottonwood's "Poor me" act is getting quite old. Pastor Bayless
Conley's diatribes at Cypress council meetings would earn five stars
at the Tammy Faye Bakker School of Crocodile Tears. Meanwhile, the
Rev. Mike Wilson's selective memory when reciting event chronology
destroys his credibility.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Cottonwood's land is not being seized. The Constitution
guarantees that property shall not be taken without just
compensation. If the eminent domain process is successful, Cottonwood
will be paid the current fair market value for this vacant land.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Christian Center Stirs Passion on Both Sides," Letters, June
2:</TE>
<TE>   Regarding the letter from Marlena and Larry Howard of Cypress, I
need to let the Howards know how incorrect they are concerning the
zoning of the property at the corner of Katella and Walker. The
zoning for the property and designated use [is] clearly shown on the
redevelopment map of 1990. The map that the residents approved shows
"professional offices and hotel." Their characterization that it was
"zoned for a shopping center" is patently wrong. Furthermore, I'm
sure they were not aware of it, but Cypress had approved an office
building on the site shortly before Cottonwood became the owner.</TE>
<TE>   A church was a "permissible use" under that zoning at the time and
clearly was stated as such in a letter from the city in 1999. If the
facts were disseminated, people wouldn't be as confused as they are.</TE>
<TE>   I feel sorry for people like the Howards, who want to believe in
their city government, but who are being fed a lot of bait by the
good public servants. Many of the city's residents are swallowing it
hook, line and sinker.</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth Dean Hinkle</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Living in South County, we are not affected by what happens in
Cypress. If a Costco is built, it's too far away for us. If a
Cottonwood Christian Center is built, it's also too far away for us
to worship. What does affect us is how The Times seems so one-sided
in its support of the church. Cottonwood is not proposing a small
community church; it wants to build something like the Crystal
Cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   We used to live in Garden Grove, and the Crystal Cathedral did
nothing to financially help the community since it is a nonprofit.
City services in Garden Grove deteriorated while the Crystal
Cathedral became world-famous. That's why we moved. If we could say
anything to the people of Cypress it would be to support your city
council so you don't see your city services reduced and your home
values go down--and be forced, like us, to move away.</TE>

<HD>Local Autism Centers Have Spanish Resources</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Latino Group Bridges the Barriers of Autism," July 8:</LD>
<LD>   Thank you for your interest in the challenges facing parents of
children with autism. With the recent dramatic increase in autism
diagnoses, the media can provide a tremendous public service by
helping make people aware of the resources available to children and
adults with autism.</LD>
<LD>   Your article highlighted one of those resources, Grupo de Autismo
Angeles. However, as the nonprofit organization contracted by the
state of California to coordinate services for Orange County's more
than 13,000 people with developmental disabilities, we at Regional
Center of Orange County are concerned that this story could leave
some Spanish-speaking readers with a sense of hopelessness.</LD>
<TE>   All parents, regardless of the language they speak, need to know
that there is a wealth of resources available to them through their
local regional center. At Regional Center of Orange County, for
example, where we serve a large number of Spanish- and
Vietnamese-speaking families.</TE>
<TE>   We employ bilingual service coordinators. All information we
produce is also provided in Spanish and Vietnamese.</TE>
<TE>   Translators are available upon request at all public meetings
Regional Center of Orange County organizes.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the autism service providers that we fund employ
Spanish-speaking staff.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, we are always working to improve the resources we
provide. We welcome suggestions for how we can better respond to
people's needs.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The special education aide N. Good who wrote in to say that
autistic kids can never function normally and "drain" a school system
of funds for "normal" kids may be onto something. Just think of how
much money we could save if we let disabled kids sit on the curb at
home all day until it was their turn to get into an institution.
That's what we used to do, and it worked fine, right?</TE>
<TE>   Think about how much therapy these kids need, how much food they
eat. Hey--why not kill them? They'll never return the efforts spent
on them. Then we'll have much more money for the rest of us ... but
wait ... the first crematorium was built in Germany by the Nazis just
for disabled people. Hmm, better think of something else.</TE>
<TE>   My son is 90% recovered from autism due to the money "wasted" on
him. Now he won't cost society $2- or $3 million over his lifetime.</TE>

<HD>Mother Arrested in Death of Her Infant Allegedly Left Alone
in Car</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Hacienda Heights woman is being held on
$1-million bail after questioning by deputies. She is set to appear
in court Tuesday.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Hacienda Heights woman was arrested Saturday on suspicion of
killing her 4-month-old baby, who died after being left in a car for
more than seven hours, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Roxanne Rodrigo, 23, left her son, Christian, inside her Toyota
Camry at an undisclosed location Wednesday in the San Gabriel Valley
and found him dead when she returned seven to eight hours later, Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. Larry Lincoln said. She did not
immediately report the death, Lincoln added.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday, Rodrigo was behaving bizarrely while at a carwash
with friends, who decided to call her father.</LD>
<TE>   When he arrived, Rodrigo said she had something to tell him, and
led him to her car, parked at St. John Vianney Catholic Church on
Turnbull Canyon Road in Hacienda Heights, authorities said. Her
father looked inside the car and saw the baby in the back seat.</TE>
<TE>   The father called 911, and sheriff's deputies discovered the dead
baby at 1:45 p.m. After questioning Rodrigo and her father, deputies
arrested Rodrigo about 2:15 p.m. and booked her at the Industry
sheriff's station on suspicion of murder, authorities said. She is
being held in lieu of $1-million bail and is scheduled to appear
Tuesday at the Rio Hondo Courthouse in El Monte.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said there were no visible signs of injury on the
baby's body.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said Rodrigo lived with Christian, a young daughter, the
children's father and a roommate. The baby's father is in jail on
domestic violence charges, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's detectives are still investigating the case, and the
coroner's office had not determined a cause of death late Saturday.</TE>

<HD>Grant Beglarian, 74; Composer, Dean of Performing Arts at
USC</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Grant Beglarian, the composer, foundation executive and educator who
served as dean of performing arts at USC from 1969 to 1982, has died.
He was 74.</LD>
<LD>   Beglarian died July 5 of lung cancer at White Plains Hospital, not
far from his home in Scarborough, N.Y.</LD>
<LD>   As a composer, Beglarian wrote band, choral and chamber music. His
works have been performed by the New York Philharmonic, Philadelphia
Orchestra, and the Dallas, Detroit and Seattle symphonies. Perhaps
his best-known composition is "Of Fables, Foibles, and Fancies for
Cellist and Actor," written in 1971.</LD>
<TE>   As USC's dean of performing arts, Beglarian oversaw the faculties
of music, cinema/television and drama, which were later divided into
separate departments.</TE>
<TE>   Beglarian became the driving force in establishing the Arnold
Schoenberg Institute to house the composer's manuscripts and
memorabilia.</TE>
<TE>   Schoenberg, a modernist who developed the 12-tone system of
composition in the early 1920s, spent the last 17 years of his life
in Los Angeles, composing and teaching at USC and UCLA, and a number
of the composer's heirs still live in the area.</TE>
<TE>   The Schoenberg family donated the collection to USC in 1973. But
following a bitter battle between USC and the composer's heirs over
appropriate use of the building, the collection was moved to a new
home in Schoenberg's native Vienna in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "From my standpoint, he was completely responsible for bringing
the institute to USC, and I've been obliged to him ever since, even
though it ended up in Vienna," pianist Leonard Stein said of
Beglarian. Stein, considered the paterfamilias of Los Angeles new
music and a former student and teaching assistant to Schoenberg,
headed the Schoenberg Institute from 1975 to 1991.</TE>
<TE>   "Putting up the institute was not an easy job--he had to talk the
USC trustees into it," Stein said. "He had people write letters from
all over the world to show USC how important this was."</TE>
<TE>   Ronald Schoenberg, son of the composer and a retired Los Angeles
municipal judge, agreed with Stein. "It always takes one person with
the foresight to see what something is--and he was, in this case,
that person. It was something that was a little bit daring to do."</TE>
<TE>   Ronald Schoenberg added that Beglarian was upset to learn that the
Schoenberg Institute was leaving USC. "He was very disappointed; he
called me to ask if there was anything he could do. He was willing to
call or write or do whatever he could," Schoenberg said. "But at that
point, it was beyond repair."</TE>
<TE>   Beglarian was born in 1927 in Tiflis, Georgia, in the Soviet
Union. He was raised in Iran and received his early music education
there. In 1947, he came to the United States to study music at the
University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where he received his
bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees.</TE>
<TE>   He studied with Aaron Copland at Tanglewood in 1959-60, and
counted the American composer among his principal influences. After
Copland's death in 1990, Beglarian would become instrumental in the
restoration and administration of the Copland House in Westchester
County, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Beglarian served as an editor at Prentice-Hall (1961-69) and
concurrently as field director and project director for the Ford
Foundation (1961-68). After his stint at USC, he became president of
the National Foundation for the Advancement of the Arts, based in
Miami. From the mid-1990s until his death, Beglarian oversaw
innovative collaborations between educational organizations and the
Internet as international coordinator and director of global
partnerships for Thinkquest.</TE>
<TE>   Beglarian's career inspired his daughter, Eve, to become a
composer too--although in a roundabout way. After high school, she
headed to Princeton University to study neurobiology, but "after two
months, I was ready to climb the walls," she said in a telephone
interview from her New York home. "I needed music. In a way, I had to
leave home to realize that I needed to do music myself. Because it
was so much a part of the air in the house, so much a part of normal
life, I didn't realize I was dependent on it."</TE>
<TE>   Beglarian's son, actor and screenwriter Spencer Beglarian,
received his bachelor's degree from USC before getting his master's
at the Yale School of Drama. By the time Spencer Beglarian attended
USC, his father had left the institution. "The joke was, my parents
moved away for college," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think my father's life is really about an investment of his
personality and energy for future generations, and also continuing
the legacy of those artists he appreciated in the past who inspired
him," Spencer Beglarian added. "He wanted to provide access, not just
archives and monuments."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his son and daughter, Beglarian is survived by his
wife, Joyce. A memorial service will be announced at a later date.
The family has requested that donations in his memory be sent to
Copland House.</TE>

<HD>Man on Sex Crime Probation Arrested</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 22-year-old convicted sex offender has been arrested on suspicion
of violating his probation for allegedly posing as a teenager to
enter the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Ventura on Johnson Drive.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Angel Hinojosa remained in Ventura County Jail on
Saturday, where he was being held without bail since his arrest July
11, a jail employee said. He is slated to appear in court Aug. 15.</LD>
<LD>   "He came as a guest of a girl who is a member," said club
spokesman Matthew Guasco, a member of the club's board of directors.
"[Staff members] said he was very youthful looking ... polite and
quiet."</LD>
<TE>   Hinojosa, according to court records, pleaded guilty last year to
three felony counts of committing a lewd act on a child under the age
of 14. The crimes occurred, according to records, in November 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Hinojosa was sentenced to 360 days in jail and three years'
probation and was ordered to register as a sex offender, court
records show. He was released from custody earlier this year after
serving about two-thirds of his term.</TE>
<TE>   Guasco said Hinojosa came to the club with the girl an unknown
number of times during a three- or four-week period that ended July
8. During each visit, Hinojosa lied about his age, Guasco said.</TE>
<TE>   Club rules require members and guests who are not family members
to be 19 years old or younger. Guests are not required to show
picture identification, Guasco said.</TE>
<TE>   Hinojosa attended practice sessions for a hip-hop dancing group,
Guasco said. A staff member monitored each practice and reported no
unusual behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Guasco said a parent who came to pick up a child at the club
recognized Hinojosa as a convicted felon and called police. Probation
officers interviewed staff members and the girl who had been
Hinojosa's host before arresting him.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they were investigating whether Hinojosa committed any
new crimes while at the club. So far, he was being held only on
suspicion of violating his probation, which bars him from being in
the presence of children without official approval.</TE>
<TE>   Guasco said the club's directors will discuss the case at their
meeting in September. "We have really stringent policies in place,"
Guasco said. "I'm comfortable with the attention and supervision and
screening of people at the door."</TE>

<HD>Child-Care Program a Welcome Addition to Ojai Curriculum</HD>
<DH>Family: District will offer low-cost supervision for
preschool-age kids of teachers and staff.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ojai school officials are set to launch a program this fall to
provide low-cost child care and preschool specifically for its
teachers and staff, becoming the first school district in Ventura
County and among few in the state to offer the benefit.</LD>
<LD>   Though growing numbers of employers across California are acting
to make work environments more family friendly, Ojai appears to be a
leader among school districts in providing on-site care, according to
child care advocates and state education officials.</LD>
<LD>   It may seem elementary, but employee child care has yet to become
a priority for school districts, said Fred Glass, spokesman for the
California Federation of Teachers.</LD>
<TE>   "There are plenty of teachers who are parents, and it would be a
great help for them if they were able to drop their kids into child
care right where they are," he said. "In an underfunded environment,
[however,] it's not a high priority."</TE>
<TE>   The need certainly exists in Ventura County, where a recent state
report showed children under 5 outnumber licensed child-care slots by
a 2-to-1 ratio and the average annual cost for enrolling an infant in
day care is $8,690.</TE>
<TE>   "We have eight to 10 people on partial leaves or working half time
because of child care," said Ojai Unified School District Supt. Van
Riley. "We're becoming more aware of the need out there."</TE>
<TE>   A Pricey Proposition</TE>
<TE>   Consider Kimberly and John Hoj.</TE>
<TE>   She is a counselor and he is a teacher at Nordhoff High School in
Ojai, which is among the county's priciest communities. With a
3-year-old daughter and 5-month-old twins, their day-care costs could
reach $2,200 a month--more than the cost of a semester at UC
Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   And that is assuming the couple can even find three day-care
openings in Ojai, where waiting lists for infant care begin before
children are even born.</TE>
<TE>   "Just the concept of trying to pay for three kids' child care, as
a public school employee, is frightening," Kimberly Hoj said.</TE>
<TE>   She is on extended maternity leave from the district--a financial
sacrifice the family decided to make--but said she would apply for
the Ojai district's program when she returns to work part time next
fall. At $75 a week per child, which is the district's proposed cost
to employees, it's a deal that can't be beat, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It might permit us to pay for college," said Hoj, 32. "It might
permit us to be able to do some long-range financial planning for our
family. Honestly, it's very difficult to live on a teacher's salary
in Ojai."</TE>
<TE>   That is increasingly the case for young teachers throughout the
state. In areas with sky-high housing costs, such as San Francisco,
one simply cannot buy a home on $34,000 a year, Glass said.</TE>
<TE>   A program to help teachers and other school employees with
child-care expenses could make a difference, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately it's not something I've heard happening in many
districts," Glass said. "Ojai is certainly among the first, if not
the first."</TE>
<TE>   Borrowing an Idea</TE>
<TE>   Riley said his inspiration for the idea came from his wife, Mary,
who is working on a project funded by Proposition 10 tobacco tax
money to make Ventura County a "family friendly employment zone."</TE>
<TE>   Ten employers in the county--from Camarillo-based Zebra
Technologies to the city of Oxnard--are receiving grants to determine
their employees' child-care needs. Employers will then get technical
support to devise solutions and to make those ideas a reality, Mary
Riley said.</TE>
<TE>   Those solutions could include on-site child-care centers, such as
the ones offered by Patagonia Inc. in Ventura and Amgen Inc. in
Thousand Oaks; subsidies for workers to use at private centers; a
child-care referral system; or more flexible benefits for working
parents.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a whole cafeteria of options," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Under Ojai's plan, an unused classroom at the district's
headquarters on Ojai Avenue will become a full-day, child-care center
for up to 12 children ages 2 to 5.</TE>
<TE>   While their parents work in the district office or in nearby
schools, the children will be supervised by a certified preschool
teacher, a district administrator and at least two child development
professionals, according to the plan approved by the school board
last week.</TE>
<TE>   Four hours out of the day--from 8 a.m. to noon--will be dedicated
to preschool activities, from development of fine motor skills to
beginning academics such as counting and ABCs.</TE>
<TE>   The day-care portion of the program, provided from 7 to 8 a.m. and
from noon to 5 p.m., will include play time and group activities, Van
Riley said.</TE>
<TE>   Expansion Planned</TE>
<TE>   If applications outnumber available slots, a waiting list and
lottery system will be developed, he said. The district hopes to
expand the program to include infant care by October.</TE>
<TE>   Nordhoff High teacher Ann Inman said she would jump at the chance
to enroll her 3-month-old son in a less costly program when she
returns to work in January.</TE>
<TE>   Now, she has him on a waiting list to enroll at the Ojai Center
for Children, which she said will cost $700 a month.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's an incredible need," she said. "Even more than
that, if you have your children near where you work, it can make such
a huge difference to being a parent and an employee. It allows you to
do both jobs well."</TE>

<HD>A Message of Abstinence</HD>
<DH>Carla Osorio, 16, is a mentor to young girls. Her aim is to
lower pregnancy rates among Latinas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSE CARDENAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Carla Osorio's volunteer work to prevent teen pregnancy, the high
schooler's message is captured in a cheer she and a few other
like-minded girls from Montebello composed:</LD>
<LD>   Give me a T</LD>
<LD>   Give me an E</LD>
<TE>   Give me an E</TE>
<TE>   Give me an N</TE>
<TE>   Give me an S</TE>
<TE>   What do we want from teens?</TE>
<TE>   ABSTINENCE</TE>
<TE>   Make your decision</TE>
<TE>   Make it a vision</TE>
<TE>   And let it be your mission.</TE>
<TE>   Osorio, 16, carries this message to other girls in Los Angeles
partly through her position as one of the spokeswomen for the Los
Angeles chapter of Girls Inc., a national nonprofit organization that
mentors girls. Whether speaking locally at Girls Inc. conferences,
appearing in a television documentary or working with other teens in
the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, Osorio's message of
abstinence makes sense to her.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess it's kind of like in my values already, to be abstinent
right now," said Osorio, a junior at Montebello High School, "because
my priority is my education."</TE>
<TE>   Osorio, a 3.8-GPA student who likes hanging out at the mall with
her friends, is well-versed on the rates of teen pregnancy. In
California, teen pregnancy among Latinas remains high, at 90.5 births
per 1,000 girls ages 15 to 19, compared with 59.9 for black teenagers
and 20.7 for whites.</TE>
<TE>   For her, it's especially satisfying to work to prevent teen
pregnancy in communities like hers.</TE>
<TE>   In her Montebello neighborhood, "we see girls getting pregnant
every day and every year," she said. "Me, being a Latina, I should
get this information to other Latinas."</TE>
<TE>   Her choice of abstinence also is inspired by lessons from her
family life: Her mother, an aspiring actress in Guatemala, became a
teenage mother.</TE>
<TE>   "Although she had the support of my dad, she couldn't do the
things that were important to her," Osorio said. "She was going to
have the opportunity to go to France because of her acting and
instead she couldn't because she had me."</TE>
<TE>   Girls Inc. is a well-established nonprofit based in New
York--www.girlsinc.org--that for decades has aimed to make girls
"strong, smart and bold" with its mentoring programs nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles chapter, with offices in Pasadena, has five other
spokeswomen devoted to other topics, such as economic literacy and
philanthropy. But it's all geared toward preventing teen pregnancy,
said Tatyanna M. Wilkinson, program coordinator for Girls Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether dealing with your economics or your day-to-day
relationships with males and females or your parents, that is all
pregnancy prevention," Wilkinson said. "Because the girls who get
pregnant, if you sit down and you talk to them, they didn't have the
opportunities that Carla had."</TE>
<TE>   Girls Inc. does not consider abstinence its sole solution for
preventing teen pregnancy. The organization advocates many other
solutions, including use of condoms and other forms of birth control.</TE>
<TE>   "There are other girls we work with who have been through our
pregnancy prevention programming who are not pregnant, but who are
sexually active, and they protect themselves," said Wilkinson.</TE>
<TE>   For Osorio, abstinence--the only 100%-effective way to prevent
pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, she said--is the right
choice. She traces her commitment to preventing teen pregnancy to her
first contact with Girls Inc. when she was 11.</TE>
<TE>   Her mother, Patricia--still an amateur actress who puts on
community plays about HIV/AIDS and domestic violence--introduced
Osorio to Girls Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Patricia was a promoter--a community worker who teaches classes
sponsored by Planned Parenthood and Girls Inc. about health and
pregnancy prevention to women and girls in Southeast, East and
Northeast Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Osorio and her mother also went through a Girls Inc. program
called "Growing Together" for 9- to 11-year-old girls. The program
consists of a set of classes in which a girl and her mother, father,
or another adult, bond as they learn about the human anatomy. "We had
to write the male and female organs and then test ourselves," Osorio
said. "You were learning 'vagina,' 'penis' and you were not
embarrassed to say the specific name of the organ."</TE>
<TE>   Another course that Osorio went through is called "Will
Power/Won't Power," for 12- to 14-year-old girls. The program exhorts
girls to be assertive about what they want and don't want, what they
will do and what they won't.</TE>
<TE>   Osorio's enthusiasm about preventing teen pregnancy cemented
itself when she was 13. On a panel of girls at a Girls Inc.
conference, she spoke adamantly about her mission.</TE>
<TE>   "I was struck by the fact that she was just turning 14, and
already decided that she wanted to lower the rates of teen
pregnancy," Wilkinson said. "In fact, she said that that day, she and
two of her friends, 'We are going to lower the rates of teen
pregnancy.' "</TE>
<TE>   Her efforts led her to become a Girls Inc. spokeswoman on this
issue.</TE>
<TE>   But she has branched out.</TE>
<TE>   Because of an essay she wrote, she was chosen to be part of a
youth leadership group of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen
Pregnancy, a nonprofit organization based in Washington D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Participating youths from around the country were responsible for,
among other things, passing out posters and speaking about the issue
at their own high schools.</TE>
<TE>   Osorio was taped in her daily life as part of "Breaking the
Silence--Sex is not a Four Letter Word," by documentarian Michael
King that may run on television by early 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Osorio's focus on abstinence is not complicated. She's focused on
going to college and becoming a psychologist.</TE>
<TE>   And she can see in the teen mothers who attend a special section
of Montebello High that her plans could be compromised if she had
sex.</TE>
<TE>   "Teens are not ready to be parents," she said. "We are not
emotionally, mentally and physically ready to have sex."</TE>

<HD>William Gorog, 76; Helped Create High-Tech Information
Systems</HD>
<DH>In the Ford administration he was deputy director of the
President's Economic Policy Board and executive director of the
Council on International Economic Policy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>William F. Gorog, a technology entrepreneur who played key roles in
the development of the LexisNexis computerized information and
telephone credit card authorization systems, died of lung cancer July
14 at a hospital in Falls Church, Va. He was 76.</LD>
<LD>   Gorog was chairman of InteliData Technologies Corp., which
pioneered electronic banking and bill-paying systems.</LD>
<LD>   He founded the company in 1990 as US Order, and it was sold in
1994 to Visa International. Gorog retained the title of chairman.</LD>
<TE>   He was also a White House economic advisor during the Ford
administration, and a former president of Magazine Publishers of
America.</TE>
<TE>   Gorog, a resident of McLean, Va., was born in Warren, Ohio. He
served in the Army during World War II, and in 1949 graduated from
the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.</TE>
<TE>   After Army service during the Korean War, he settled in the
Washington area and was co-founder of Data Corp., a high-technology
research and development company.</TE>
<TE>   He was the company's chairman and chief executive, and in the
1960s he presided over the development of a full-text retrieval
system for the massive amounts of data being stored in computer
systems at that time.</TE>
<TE>   This eventually became the LexisNexis computerized law and news
information systems now used by thousands of law firms, courts,
federal agencies and businesses across the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The company also worked with the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration and developed the photo-optics systems for the Apollo
moon missions.</TE>
<TE>   The firm merged in 1969 with Mead Corp., but Gorog remained
chairman of the Data Corp. subsidiary.</TE>
<TE>   He joined the Ford administration in 1975 as deputy director of
the President's Economic Policy Board.</TE>
<TE>   In 1976, he became executive director of the Council on
International Economic Policy.</TE>
<TE>   When President Ford left office in 1977, Gorog established a
trading company that specialized in the export of U.S. computer
products to the Far East.</TE>
<TE>   From 1983 to 1987, he was president of Magazine Publishers of
America, whose members included such organizations as Time Inc.,
Conde Nast and Hearst.</TE>
<TE>   In 1987, Gorog became chairman and chief executive of Arbor
International, a company that specialized in financing energy,
high-technology and real estate ventures.</TE>
<TE>   In this role, he was instrumental in the financing and marketing
of the VeriFone credit card authorization system, and was a director
of VeriFone.</TE>
<TE>   While at Arbor International, he began working on the electronic
banking and bill-paying operation that became InteliData
Technologies.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, Gorog was named Nasdaq's entrepreneur of the year.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife of 53 years, Gretchen Meister Gorog;
six children, Christopher, Jonathan, Peter, Robin, Jennifer Gorog
Nichols and Lesley Gorog Harris; and 21 grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>A Battle Rages on the Home Front</HD>
<DH>Santa Monica: The practice of demolishing old houses to put
up 'monster mansions' pits historic preservation versus property
rights.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTHA GROVES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All Marc Schrobilgen wanted was to follow in the footsteps of scores
of others: Buy a so-so house in Santa Monica, rip it down and build a
two-story dream abode. A year and $65,000 later, it is his demolition
permit that remains a dream.</LD>
<LD>   Schrobilgen is swept up in a fractious debate over preservation
versus homeowners' rights in this eclectic beach-side community,
where hundreds of modest bungalows that helped give the town its
flavor have been bulldozed and replaced with colossi known as
"monster mansions."</LD>
<LD>   Bemoaning a loss of charm and character, preservationists have
raised an alarm. But they have been shouted down by rankled
homeowners, many of them elderly, who fear a mass evaporation of
equity should the city restrict tear-downs or remodelings.</LD>
<TE>   Up and down one leafy street after another, well-tended lawns are
sprouting "No Historic Districts" signs. And a pro-development lawyer
has been gathering signatures for a ballot initiative that would
leave the choice of preservation up to homeowners.</TE>
<TE>   Countering that, a preservation-minded developer has just launched
the nonprofit Santa Monica Conservancy to raise awareness of the
city's architectural and historical treasures.</TE>
<TE>   Each side accuses the other of spreading misinformation and sowing
confusion. In an extreme case, one homeowner had the impression he
would not be allowed to replace a leaky toilet, even though the
city's existing rules put no limits on interior changes--and
certainly not plumbing repairs. Rather, the aim of preservationists
is to protect the exteriors of buildings considered to be
significant.</TE>
<TE>   And that is where Schrobilgen ran into trouble.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, the 31-year-old video producer and editor paid a bit
more than $1 million for a property on 18th Street just south of San
Vicente Boulevard. Engineers told him the foundation was crumbling
and that the 1930-vintage Spanish Revival house was beset with toxic
mold, asbestos and termites. They advised him to raze it and start
from scratch.</TE>
<TE>   Schrobilgen was no stranger to the tear-down mania that has swept
Santa Monica and other California cities where real estate values are
sizzling. In the last three years, he has bulldozed two houses and
built big replacements on lots north of trendy Montana Avenue. Both
fetched millions of dollars. With those proceeds, Schrobilgen said,
"I finally [had] enough money to build a house for myself and my
girlfriend and start a family. So I started going through the
process."</TE>
<TE>   "The process" entailed applying for a demolition permit. Under the
city's existing policy, requests for "demo" permits for houses older
than 40 years face review by the Landmarks Commission, members of
which are appointed by the City Council. Usually, the process is a
formality, as 224 demo permits issued from 1988 to 2001 for
properties north of Montana attests.</TE>
<TE>   But in this case, concerned neighbors asked the Landmarks
Commission to consider establishing a "historic district" on 18th
Street. Such a designation involves a long public review process. As
a stopgap, the commission designated Schrobilgen's house a "structure
of merit"--a classification designed to give time to consider
alternatives to demolition. It falls well short of "landmark" status
and does not preclude remodeling or alteration.</TE>
<TE>   "The house was a good candidate for some neighborhood
preservation, a house that could be saved and added onto," said
Ruthann Lehrer, a landmarks commissioner who works as a historic
preservation planner in Long Beach. "That sort of initiated the whole
controversy over historic districts."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, faced with hefty mortgage payments for a house he deemed
uninhabitable, Schrobilgen began mobilizing neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Larmore, a pro-development attorney, created the Homeowners
Freedom of Choice Initiative. The initiative would prohibit the city
from designating a home in an area zoned for single-family residences
as historic or as a landmark without the owner's consent. Larmore
failed to amass the required 6,000 signatures to qualify the
initiative for this November's ballot and said he is now aiming for
the 2004 election.</TE>
<TE>   In March, a consulting firm hired by the city finished updating an
inventory of Santa Monica's historic resources, focusing on the area
north of Montana. It includes properties that have been or could be
designated as landmarks, structures of merit or contributors to
historic districts.</TE>
<TE>   About 9% of the properties, or 358, are listed. Those include the
"18th Street Grouping," also known as Gillette Regent Square. The
pocket is named for King C. Gillette, who invented the safety razor
in the early 1900s and then turned to developing housing for Santa
Monica's burgeoning middle class. Also included in the listing are
Adelaide Drive, a stretch of Craftsman and other expansive homes with
views of Santa Monica Canyon and the ocean, and La Mesa Drive.</TE>
<TE>   The prospect that the Landmarks Commission might begin designating
wide swaths of such neighborhoods as historic districts riled
homeowners.</TE>
<TE>   One late-June evening, about 250 residents filled an auditorium to
hear Schrobilgen's tale of woe. Some had been drawn by a flier
contending: "You are in imminent danger.... The Santa Monica
Landmarks Commission can take control of your home.... All
single-family homes in Santa Monica are under siege." It suggested
that the declaration of a historic district could devastate property
values. The alarmist tone made preservationists bristle.</TE>
<TE>   Lehrer noted that a city ordinance has been in place for more than
25 years and has resulted in the designation of just 16 landmarks and
two historic districts. Home prices in the larger district, on 3rd
Street in the Ocean Park neighborhood, are buoyant, and several
renovation projects are underway there. Existing guidelines allow
homeowners to remodel, add on and even relocate, within limits, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most important, Lehrer said, studies show that historic
districts nationwide tend to boost property values. Santa Monica is
far from alone in experiencing a raze-and-rebuild frenzy. In June,
the National Trust for Historic Preservation put tear-downs in
historic neighborhoods on its annual list of "11 most endangered
historic places."</TE>
<TE>   "Tear-downs radically change the fabric of a community," said
Richard Moe, president of the National Trust. "Without proper
safeguards, historic neighborhoods will lose the identities that drew
residents to put down roots in the first place."</TE>
<TE>   Among the casualties of this trend are trees, backyards and
sunlight, blocked by towering new structures built right up to the
property lines.</TE>
<TE>   "People are looking for the convenience of the established, older
neighborhoods with all the amenities but also a big house that's
tough to fit on their lot, and there's the rub," said Jim Lindberg of
the trust's Denver office.</TE>
<TE>   Schrobilgen, who is in the process of starting up a company after
being laid off from Sony Music, continues his quest for a demolition
permit. He could well get it in September, because the homeowner
backlash has prompted landmarks commissioners to back off on pursuing
an 18th Street historic district.</TE>
<TE>   But Schrobilgen now owes money to family and friends who came to
his aid. As soon as the house is built, he said, "I most likely will
have to sell it."</TE>

<HD>Tips Led to Fast Arrest in Girl's Killing</HD>
<DH>Crime: The breaks came quickly in the kidnapping of
Samantha Runnion. Without them, the hunt could have been long and
even fruitless.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was late Wednesday morning, and the army of detectives
investigating the kidnapping and murder of 5-year-old Samantha
Runnion was still at square one.</LD>
<LD>   A day and a half after her kidnapping and nearly a day after her
body was discovered, a massive dragnet had checked out scores of sex
offenders, pulled over dozens of green cars and fielded hundreds of
tips--but still produced little to go on. FBI profilers privately
predicted they were in for a long search to identify the killer.</LD>
<LD>   Then, about noon, a caller provided a name that transformed the
investigation. Check out Alejandro Avila, the caller said. Within a
few hours, two more people had called with the same advice.</LD>
<TE>   So began a frenetic two days of police work that ended with
Avila's arrest Friday. The quick result contrasts sharply with other
high-profile abduction cases around the country, some of which remain
under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Police officials Saturday said three factors were crucial in
making a speedy arrest: a clear description of the suspect supplied
by Samantha's 6-year-old playmate, finding the body within a day and
the phone calls pointing them in Avila's direction.</TE>
<TE>   "If his name hadn't come up, we'd still be checking every sex
registrant in California, polygraphing them, checking alibis," said
one law enforcement source, adding that the trail would ultimately
have proved fruitless because Avila wasn't a registered sex offender.</TE>
<TE>   While the Orange County Sheriff's Department said Saturday that it
doesn't want to jeopardize Avila's prosecution by releasing details
of the investigation, several officials spoke on the condition of
anonymity about how they built the case.</TE>
<TE>   Avila maintains he had nothing to do with Samantha's death, saying
he was at a shopping mall when the kidnapping occurred. His family
says a bitter ex-girlfriend pointed police in Avila's direction.</TE>
<TE>   Police won't identify the tipsters. But within hours of those
calls, officers began questioning anyone who knew him well. Their
initial investigation was promising.</TE>
<TE>   Avila had been accused, then acquitted, of child molestation in
2001. One of the alleged victims had lived in the same Stanton
townhouse complex where Samantha was snatched. And Avila's Lake
Elsinore apartment is just a few miles from the mountainous ravine
where Samantha's nude body was left.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors at Avila's apartment complex told investigators they had
recently seen him meticulously cleaning a green car--resembling the
one Samantha's playmate said the kidnapper drove.</TE>
<TE>   "In a case like this, you really depend on getting breaks," said
one official who worked the case. "We got breaks."</TE>
<TE>   By late afternoon Wednesday, investigators decided that the
27-year-old was one of their best leads. At 5:20 p.m., they began
surveillance of Avila, who remained inside his apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Surveillance continued through the night until Thursday morning,
when detectives watched Avila prepare to drive away from the
apartment complex in a friend's car. Detectives had a choice: Stop
Avila for questioning or let him leave and risk losing him.</TE>
<TE>   "If you lose him, that's a huge public risk that most of us aren't
going to take," said the same law enforcement source. "They had to
contact him."</TE>
<TE>   Playing Their Hand</TE>
<TE>   Undercover officers in a white van stopped the Toyota Tercel that
Avila and his friend were riding in. The detectives took him to a
hotel in Santa Ana, where they began a 12-hour interrogation, Avila
said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the buildup of circumstantial evidence, some detectives,
including FBI profilers, remained doubtful that the investigation was
near an end. Hundreds of leads were still pouring in to the sheriff's
command post in Stanton.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives were examining as many as 50 other possible suspects,
among them a Fresno man driving a green car similar to the
kidnapper's who was arrested after failing to stop for California
Highway Patrol officers.</TE>
<TE>   At the Santa Ana hotel, investigators continued a marathon
interview. Avila strongly denied he was involved in the murder, but
detectives didn't believe his claim that he was shopping alone at the
Ontario Mills mall. The interview went on until 6 p.m., Avila said,
when the questioning turned hostile and he asked for a lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, detectives pieced together the evidence they had so
far and asked a judge for a warrant to search Avila's apartment, his
workplace and his mother's apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Police executed the search warrants late Thursday evening, and
television news helicopters showed a caravan of police cars and
undercover vans pulling into Avila's apartment complex. Officials
impounded a white Buick Century that belonged to Avila's mother, a
pale green Thunderbird he drove, and the Toyota Tercel.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, they took a sample of Avila's blood and photographed
one of his legs, which Avila said bore a scratch from a child's
safety gate in his sister's apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Forensic analysts began drawing up a DNA profile of Avila to see
whether it matched materials they had found under Samantha's
fingernails, hoping she scratched her attacker.</TE>
<TE>   Down to the Wire</TE>
<TE>   Avila remained at the Santa Ana hotel--he was not under arrest and
repeatedly called his mother early Friday morning. Detectives
realized that once their search was over, they'd have to either
release Avila or arrest him. The big fear at the command center was
that Avila would be released and flee.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were him, and I didn't do it, I would get out of the
country," said another law enforcement source. "And if I did [do it],
I would certainly get out."</TE>
<TE>   Preliminary tests determining whether DNA evidence found on
Samantha's body matched Avila's genetic profile would not be ready
until Friday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   But top investigators decided they couldn't wait and arrested
Avila at 9:55 a.m. Fifteen minutes later, Sheriff Michael Carona
announced the arrest at a news conference.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot we have to do in the next few hours," Carona told
reporters. "This in no way concludes this investigation. We are still
trying to ensure that we bring the man who did this to justice."</TE>
<TE>   By 3 p.m., the crime lab reported a match with Avila's DNA, law
enforcement sources said. And three hours later, a far more assured
Carona strode to the podium to address reporters.</TE>
<TE>   "We're confident that Mr. Avila is in fact the murderer of
Samantha Runnion," said Carona, calling it a "100%" certainty.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that our physical evidence, the investigative
information we pulled together, the help that we received from the
public--combined--will prove in fact that he is that individual."</TE>

<HD>Warning Children: a Tough Balancing Act</HD>
<DH>Safety: Since slaying, many parents are more watchful and
try to caution without paranoia.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE CHAVEZ and MILTON CARRERO GALARZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For parents of children small enough to be carried away against their
will, these past days have been a time for holding hands a bit
tighter, turning casual supervision into constant vigilance and
grappling with ways to gently explain a horror story.</LD>
<LD>   Talk to most parents or their children Saturday--at swim lessons,
at the park, at a birthday party, at home--and it's as if a phantom
had followed them on their normal routines, putting them on guard,
invading their thoughts.</LD>
<LD>   "My heart is twisted," said Liliana Florido, an Anaheim mother of
a 10-year-old girl.</LD>
<TE>   "It clenches you up. I feel nauseated when I think about it," said
Consuelo Brennan, 36, a Burbank mother of a 2-year-old boy.</TE>
<TE>   "It could have been my little girl," said Gary Byrne, the Alhambra
father of 4-year-old Janelle.</TE>
<TE>   Then talk to children, and eyes open wide with concern. For them,
this has been a week of sternly worded admonitions and mean-man
role-playing. Never fall for the lost puppy routine. If a stranger
tries to take you away, what do you do?</TE>
<TE>   "Scratch, scream, try to get away," said Elianna Florido, who has
been so upset by the slaying that she and her mother went to the
Stanton kidnapping site Saturday to leave a condolence card. Liliana
said her daughter is old enough to understand the news, but young
enough to have cried in fear on and off all week.</TE>
<TE>   "I think somebody is going to come up and steal me," Elianna said,
as she gripped her mother's hand and placed a card on one of 11
makeshift memorial tables outside the Runnion family home.</TE>
<TE>   "It told her mom that I feel very, very sorry for her, and my
family is praying for them," Elianna said.</TE>
<TE>   Danyelle Vasquez of Rancho Cucamonga, 12, said she decided to
avoid meeting with her friends in the frontyard and instead retreat
to the safety of her backyard.</TE>
<TE>   Samantha's body was found Tuesday near a mountain road west of
Lake Elsinore, the city where Alejandro Avila, 27, the man suspected
of killing her, was arrested Friday. The case has drawn national
media attention, and authorities received more than 2,000 tips.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been scared," Danyelle said. "I wanted to sleep in [her
parents'] bed."</TE>
<TE>   Vigilance became a full-time job last week.</TE>
<TE>   "Just stay there, honey. Stay there. Don't go anywhere else. I
need to see you," shouted Jeanette Guerrero, 37, to her 7-year-old
son, who was attending a birthday party Saturday at Griffith Park.</TE>
<TE>   Hers was a common plea, typical of the instructions doled out to a
child in the course of a day. But Saturday, Guerrero said, her orders
felt more profound.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a case that hit home," the Diamond Bar mother of two
said. "The more you heard about it, the sadder and more cautious you
became."</TE>
<TE>   She and her husband decided to buy a Sony PlayStation just to keep
the children occupied when the couple can't be outside to watch
afternoon play.</TE>
<TE>   Overnight, the frontyard seems to have become a kind of danger
zone for children, a place where only supervised play time is
allowed--a responsibility that can stretch into hours during warm
summer evenings.</TE>
<TE>   "Dinner is just going to have to be late, the housework is going
to have to be neglected," said Claudia Soto, 29, of Compton. The
mother of three children, 11, 7 and 4 months, gathered the two eldest
early in the week to gently explain what happened to Samantha.</TE>
<TE>   Although she usually shields her children from the crime stories
of the day, this was one event that she said she didn't have the
luxury to ignore. "It was my responsibility to let them know what can
happen," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Soto, like others, calmly, matter-of-factly told the story of the
"very mean man" who hurt a little girl, who is now up in heaven. The
moral: Stay close to your parents; listen to what they say.</TE>
<TE>   At Mayo Elementary School, where Soto is a parent advocate
teaching English and other parenting classes, she said, the parents
met this week to organize adult-supervised "walking home" groups.</TE>
<TE>   "As parents, we said it is our responsibility to make sure no
child walks alone," Soto said.</TE>
<TE>   Nitza Becerra, 26, of Gardena also decided to tell her girls, 5
and 8, that the Stanton girl had died after being hurt, to drive home
the seriousness of the lesson at hand. Her oldest had seen the story
on television and asked what happened to Samantha.</TE>
<TE>   Amber, 8, "was surprised and gave me that oh-my-God kind of look.
She understands death," said Becerra, who followed up with an
explanation of rules. "I know she just didn't blow this one off. The
way she looked at me, I knew she understood this."</TE>
<TE>   It's the difficult balance between caution and paranoia that many
parents said they grappled with. How much do children really need to
know about sexual predators?</TE>
<TE>   Nothing. That's what Scott and Linda Folsom of Mount Washington
decided. They don't watch the evening news because it's too
sensational, they said. And their 11-year-old daughter knew little,
if any, details of the killing.</TE>
<TE>   Explaining the crime to an older child, they said, would have
meant delving into details they felt were inappropriate.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to have to explain about rape," Scott Folsom said.
"I just didn't see a whole lot of benefit to her at this point in her
life."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Linda, a production executive at Disney, said work
conversations last week were dominated by Samantha's fate.</TE>
<TE>   Parents, grandparents, anyone close to a child, she said, felt
violated as they tried to fathom the cruelty of the crime.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no possible explanation that man could have that would
cause him to be forgiven for what he did, making a child suffer like
that," Linda Folsom said.</TE>
<TE>   Avila's arrest did little to ease the minds of some worried
parents, who, while comforting their children, protected them from
the truth that made their hearts quake.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing is, I know that this isn't the only guy like this
around," said Byrne as he guided his 4-year-old daughter to her swim
lesson. "Kids change your life so much, and then it is so scary to
think of how quickly they can be taken from you .... It's hard. It's
hard."</TE>

<HD>Age of Kitsch and Clutter Fading Fast in Anaheim</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When wrecking balls demolish the Rip Van Winkle Motel and
circus-tent-styled Melodyland this summer, some will cheer Anaheim's
continued transformation into a modern resort city with thousands of
hotel rooms, towering palm trees and manicured medians bursting with
lush, yellow flowers.</LD>
<LD>   Others long for the city of old and see only what is disappearing,
bit by kitschy bit.</LD>
<LD>   Since 1995, when Anaheim embarked on its resort makeover, the neon
signs have been vanishing. Themed hotels and just about everything
Googie--that exaggerated, space-age diner architecture from the 1950s
and '60s--also is gone.</LD>
<TE>   With it, some say, went the city's personality.</TE>
<TE>   "All that character is gone," said Daniel Paul, a Googie
architecture fan who grew up near Disneyland. "What is there now is
not an honest assessment of the fun and whimsy that people associate
with Disneyland. It's something ... much more sterile. It's the
out-churning of a bunch of marketing studies."</TE>
<TE>   What city officials liken to a renaissance Paul calls a
"blandification."</TE>
<TE>   Not so long ago, for every "land" at Disneyland, it seemed there
was a matching motel on the outside. Stovall's Space Age Motel or
Cosmic Lodge weren't much of a stretch from Tomorrowland, and some
had pools shaped like space capsules. Satellites and even a flying
saucer were perched on roofs. Cheesy advertisements beckoned tourists
by offering "moon-level luxury at down-to-earth prices."</TE>
<TE>   The tiki totem pole outside the Samoa Motel on Katella Avenue
could have been transplanted next to the Enchanted Tiki Room in
Adventureland.</TE>
<TE>   But city officials grimaced at the rusting, deteriorating signs
and bare concrete landscape with no unifying theme.</TE>
<TE>   "The signs were having to compete with each other," said Mary
McCloskey, Anaheim's deputy planning director. "They just got bigger
and gaudier and more cluttered.... I don't think it felt like a
resort. It was feeling old and tired."</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, the city embarked on a massive overhaul with $6 billion
in public and private funds. Telephone lines were moved underground.
Hotels were remodeled and given new facades. The Santa Ana Freeway
was widened. The futuristic Convention Center, which looks like
something out of "The Jetsons," still stands, but with a $177-million
face lift and expansion.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most dramatic change grew out of the City Council's
restrictions on signs. All the neon signs that loomed high above the
ground--cherished as historic artifacts by Googie lovers--had to be
replaced with eye-level monument signs.</TE>
<TE>   "While there will be people who might miss what was there
historically, if we were going to remain competitive, we had to
reinvent and transform that resort into a very pleasant garden
environment," McCloskey said.</TE>
<TE>   Across the country, cities were pouring money into their
convention centers, drawing conferences away from Anaheim. New theme
parks and resorts were also vying for tourist dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Palm trees now line Katella Avenue. Flowering Tipuana Tipu trees,
strung with lights, twinkle at night along Harbor Boulevard. When
mature, they'll form a canopy like the trees and lights on
Disneyland's Main Street, McCloskey said.</TE>
<TE>   The city recently gave final approval to GardenWalk, a
$600-million project that will include four new hotels along with
shops and a slate of popular restaurants. It will take the place of
the landmark Melodyland, the musical theater turned mega-church.</TE>
<TE>   Some preservationists argued that Melodyland and the old motels
were architectural jewels. John English, a board member of the Los
Angeles Conservancy, used to offer Anaheim tours to Googie
aficionados.</TE>
<TE>   At its peak, Anaheim boasted the highest concentration of Googie
in the United States. No more. "I've pretty much written it off,"
English said.</TE>
<TE>   So it doesn't get forgotten, , English, Paul and other
architecture buffs are helping the city document what used to be.
Jane Newell, a city librarian, has filled a box with photographs and
old postcards. A dilapidated neon sign leans against a wall at the
downtown library's history room, not far from Disneyland.</TE>
<TE>   When Newell drives through the resort area with her camera, she
notices all the little changes. A missing tiki. A demolished sign.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I drive by, I look around and I think, 'My God,
something else is gone,' " Newell said. "It really is sad."</TE>
<TE>   This summer, when Melodyland gives way to GardenWalk, it will end
up alongside other pieces of Anaheim's Googie history as a photograph
in Newell's box.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, there will be the stories of bands such as the Chambers
Brothers and the Classics Four, the second-tier touring musicals such
as "Babes in Toyland" with Connie Stevens, and children who danced
and sang in the circular, 3,000-seat theater.</TE>
<TE>   Others will recall the mega-church, where an Anaheim doctor rushed
a baby's delivery so it would be born just before a televised New
Year's Eve service with the Rev. Ralph Wilkerson.</TE>
<TE>   Church officials have no regrets about leaving. People drawn to
Jesus will keep coming, with or without the iconic building, church
spokeswoman Donna Perotin said. The church will move next month to a
yet-to-be-announced site in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   Preservationists expected this day. Melodyland has been on their
"deathwatch" list for months.</TE>
<TE>   "We've known about this for awhile," said Paul, who once went to
Melodyland as a child. "It's just another non-surprise of this whole
process that's uprooted so much."</TE>
<TE>   Newell will keep taking pictures until there are no more left to
take. City officials plan to continue refining the resort--keeping it
competitive and current--and watch as GardenWalk, the newest project
with its luxury hotels and waterfalls, rises out of Melodyland's
rubble.</TE>
<TE>   "Beauty," McCloskey said, "is in the eye of the beholder."</TE>

<HD>Idea for the Road: There's No Such Thing as a Free Way in
L.A.</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's not even rush hour, but I'm jammed up on the I-5 between L.A.
and Downey. This is irritating enough, obviously, but now the vehicle
in the next lane keeps crowding me.</LD>
<LD>   I look across and find an anorexic woman on a cell phone, driving
a humongous Ford Extinction. You've seen her, I'm sure. And if
there's not a model called Extinction, there ought to be.</LD>
<LD>   So I turn on the radio and learn:</LD>
<TE>   A) Traffic is bad everywhere, but, B) It's going to be mostly
sunny today and tomorrow.</TE>
<TE>   It's not clear to me why such reports don't also inform us that
fish are in the ocean and day will follow night. Of course there's
horrible traffic everywhere. Los Angeles just topped the national
charts for the 15th year in a row, nosing out the San
Francisco-Oakland area, with Angelenos stuck in traffic an average of
136 hours a year.</TE>
<TE>   And guess what. It's going to get so disastrously worse, we're
going to look back longingly on the mess we've got now.</TE>
<TE>   The most frightening projections tell us that, in the next 20-30
years, barring an economic collapse or some unforeseen calamity,
Southern California will add on the current population of Chicago,
and the entire state will add the current population of Texas.</TE>
<TE>   There's not a transit master plan in place that would keep up with
the expected growth, and that includes the proposal to double-deck
the 101 Freeway through the San Fernando Valley. By the time it's
completed, we'd need to go to a triple-decker, anyway, so why not
play it safe and go four-high, with parking on Level 4?</TE>
<TE>   Transportation planning is so shortsighted, traffic experts say,
that even if we complete the billions of dollars worth of projects
now scheduled in the Los Angeles area, average freeway speeds will
drop from the current 30 mph to 20 mph or less in the year 2025.</TE>
<TE>   Misery will abound. We'll all point fingers and wonder why nobody
did anything.</TE>
<TE>   So the question is, is there any way to keep ourselves from
descending into eternal gridlock hell? And the answer is yes, but
you'll never hear these solutions from any politician.</TE>
<TE>   "Freeways should remain free," California Gov. Gray Davis has said
in denouncing the state's tollways.</TE>
<TE>   As is often the case, the governor could not possibly be more
wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Everything about driving ought to cost more, not less. Any nitwit
with $6 in a bank account can drive a $35,000 set of wheels off a
new-car lot, fill the tank for $25, and cruise all day. You don't
even have to know how to drive, which is the case with half the
people on the road.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of gas, you know how we all gripe when a gallon of petrol
creeps up to $1.60, then $1.70, and then $1.80?</TE>
<TE>   I'd bump it up to $2, just to get everyone's attention, and then
I'd go to $3 and keep it there. But the increase wouldn't feed the
fat of oil company executives. It would be added to the meager
37-cent tax we now pay per gallon.</TE>
<TE>   So now, at $3 a gallon, piloting that Ford Extinction like a bug
driving a dump truck is even more ridiculous. But if you insist, go
ahead. The tax you generate can be pumped into buses, trains, and
subway cars, and we can do smart, previously unheard of things, such
as extend the airport rail line so that it actually MAKES IT TO THE
AIRPORT!</TE>
<TE>   Brian Taylor of UCLA's Institute of Transportation Studies says
drivers are getting a great bargain as things stand. For a lot of
employees, there's free parking at work, even if it means the boss
loses money on the deal. And drivers don't pay for environmental or
health-care costs caused by the pollution they spew.</TE>
<TE>   It's almost a free ride, which is why Taylor is such a fan of
tollways.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's badmouthing them, but the transportation world is
going gaga," he said of experiments like the private 91 Express Lanes
between Anaheim and Riverside County.</TE>
<TE>   When the private two-lane tollway was built several years ago, the
Orange County Transportation Authority agreed not to widen or improve
the adjacent free roadway, so as not to compete with the tollway. Now
the OCTA is buying back the tollway so it can make those
improvements, and tollways are considered an endangered species in
California.</TE>
<TE>   But Taylor would like to see more tollways, more options for
drivers, and more direct user fees, not fewer. If you want to live in
Agoura Hills and work in Long Beach, fine. But you'll pass several
electronic toll booths on the 101 and the 405, and you'll get the tab
in the mail.</TE>
<TE>   "It ought to be like a cell phone bill, where you pay for exactly
what you consumed. And if you want to travel during peak hours, you'd
pay a premium."</TE>
<TE>   This would encourage people to live closer to work, to carpool,
and to avoid using the highways when they're most congested.</TE>
<TE>   Those who say the heck with it, and decide to pay premium, will
help subsidize a transit system that makes it more attractive to get
out of your car.</TE>
<TE>   Roughly 19 million people live in Southern California today. In
the next 20 years, as many as 7 million more will be moving in.</TE>
<TE>   If we don't act soon, early Californians, who sped about on
burros, are going to seem like an advanced culture.</TE>

<CX>   Toll road--In his July 20 column in the California section, Steve
Lopez incorrectly reported that the Orange County Transportation
Authority had signed a non-compete contract with the owners of the 91
Express Lanes Toll Road. In fact, it was Caltrans and the state of
California, not OCTA, that signed the agreement with the private
operator.</CX>

<LD>And a child shall lead us.</LD>
<LD>   No, I'm not reading anything biblical into the kidnapping and
killing last week of 5-year-old Samantha Runnion. I'll leave that to
others who understand better the workings of such things.</LD>
<LD>   But I am a man holy enough to seek something, anything, uplifting
from such a spiritually demoralizing event as the murder of a child.
It doesn't have to be written or spoken but imagining a child in the
extended custody of an abductor is not an exercise that will make you
feel good about humanity.</LD>
<TE>   So is there anything to take from the horribleness-- besides the
relatively quick capture of her alleged killer?</TE>
<TE>   For her family and friends, maybe not. No one would be surprised
if they never got over it.</TE>
<TE>   But in the perhaps overly optimistic search for something to feel
good about, maybe there's this: Samantha unified the public and
police in a way we seldom see. At least in this case, and more so
than I remember seeing in any case in memory, the public and police
rose almost as one to find her killer.</TE>
<TE>   "I have worked a number of these cases, and I haven't seen the
kind of public response nationally that I have seen in this case," an
FBI agent said last week before Alejandro Avila was arrested Friday.
"The public is out there, and they are watching."</TE>
<TE>   Wouldn't it be something if that were the norm? If somehow the
citizenry and the law-enforcement community trusted each other enough
to band together to fight crime?</TE>
<TE>   Wishful thinking, perhaps, in a society where some citizens
sometimes see police as a potentially dangerous enemy, and cops often
are wary of everyone but themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, it all came together when a little girl was snatched
while at play. "I think everyone fell in love with Samantha," Orange
County Sheriff's Department spokesman Jim Amormino said Friday night
after a long week. "It brought people together. Hopefully, everything
will stay together."</TE>
<TE>   Amormino said Sheriff Mike Carona is a big believer in
public-police cooperation. Lots of top cops say that, but it only
works in places where the public trusts the police. We need look no
further these days than Inglewood to see that that isn't a given.
While police there are under siege for the rough handling July 6 of a
teenaged arrestee, Carona was thanking the public and press Friday
for helping in the arrest of Avila.</TE>
<TE>   "We had thousands and millions of eyes and ears out there,"
Amormino said.</TE>
<TE>   That's the way it should work in a civilized society. Understaffed
law- enforcement agencies should be able to rely on the public at
large for help. Police often don't tap into that enough. Part of the
reason is that cops don't always distinguish themselves in dealing
with citizens--even on such relatively mundane things as traffic
stops or handling citizen complaints.</TE>
<TE>   For a few days last week, at least, the hunt for Samantha's killer
showed us how it could be. If Avila turns out to be the killer--and
Carona literally addressed his pointed remarks to him by name at a
news conference Friday--it will be because someone turned him in. All
the police work in the world may not have nabbed him, otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   However, the law- enforcement agencies also did their part by
putting out a lot of information, even giving some behavioral clues
to look for in a potential suspect.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it was Samantha's photo in the papers and on TV that unified
the good folks against the unseen bad one. "I think that was part of
it, yes," Amormino said. "Her picture, her darling smile, that
precious little girl."</TE>
<TE>   When I talked with him by phone Friday night, Amormino had just
gotten off duty. I asked where he was, and he said he was just
pulling out of the Runnion's driveway in Stanton. "I wanted to stop
on my own time," he said of the place that he and Carona had visited
often during the week in their official capacities.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the Runnion home, people of all ages had left a memorial
of teddy bears, cards, flowers, candles and notes. "It's definitely
not just her picture," Amormino said. "It hits hard when it's a kid.
Everyone can relate to that."</TE>

<HD>Bernie Zilbergeld, 63; Psychologist Wrote About Male
Sexuality</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Bernie Zilbergeld, 63, a psychologist and author who wrote widely on
the subject of male sexuality, died June 12 at his home in Oakland of
complications from diabetes.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Freehold, N.J., Zilbergeld graduated from Ohio State
University and earned his PhD from UC Berkeley.</LD>
<LD>   He became one of the original directors of training in UC San
Francisco's Human Sexuality Program, which taught staff how to treat
male sexual problems in a clinical setting.</LD>
<TE>   In the late 1970s, Zilbergeld gained prominence by challenging the
work of the noted sex therapists William Masters and Virginia
Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Writing in Psychology Today, Zilbergeld and associate Michael
Evans called the Masters and Johnson research "flawed by
methodological errors and slipshod reporting."</TE>
<TE>   His book "Male Sexuality," published in 1978, challenged the
notion that male sexual function was simple and without problems.</TE>
<TE>   According to Zilbergeld, male sexuality was as "complex,
mysterious and full of problems as female sexuality."</TE>
<TE>   He later wrote "The Shrinking of America," which offered the
proposition that all forms of sex therapy are oversold.</TE>

<LD>Dwight Steele, 88, a lawyer and environmental activist who played a
leading role in efforts to protect Lake Tahoe, died July 11 of
injuries suffered in a fall at his home near the lake.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Alameda, Steele earned his undergraduate and law
degrees from UC Berkeley. In the late 1930s, he hitchhiked around the
world.</LD>
<LD>   During World War II, he was a member of President Roosevelt's War
Labor Board and War Manpower Commission. Steele also served on the
National Wage Stabilization Board in 1952-53.</LD>
<TE>   A resident of Hawaii from 1946 to 1959, he gave up much of his
work as a successful labor lawyer in the 1960s to tackle
environmental issues.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s, he led the opposition to plans for the so-called
Southern Crossing bridge, which would have connected San Francisco

<LD>Clifford Possum, 70, one of the first Australian aboriginal artists
to gain an international following, died June 21 in Alice Springs,
Australia.</LD>
<LD>   The cause of death was not announced by his family.</LD>
<LD>   Known as Kumuntjayi Tjapaltjarri to the members of his Ammatyerre
tribe, Possum adopted his nontribal name after a Lutheran missionary
rescued him from starvation.</LD>
<TE>   With no formal education, he become proficient first at
woodcarving while working on a cattle ranch for 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   He took up painting in the early 1970s and developed a style that
mixed spiritualism and abstraction.</TE>
<TE>   His better pieces would eventually sell for as much as $20,000
each. One Possum painting, a 1972 landscape, was purchased at auction
last year for $68,000.</TE>
<TE>   In 1980, his art had its first U.S. exhibition in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   His work is now included in the collections of the University of
Miami's art museum, the Pacific Asia Museum in Pasadena and the
Kelton Foundation in Santa Monica.</TE>

<HD>Greuel Takes Her Pothole Repair Effort to the Streets</HD>
<DH>Streets: Councilwoman vows to spruce up the district,
though some residents are skeptical.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WENDY THERMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What does it take to get a pothole repaired in Los Angeles?</LD>
<LD>   Ask city officials, and they'll assure you relief is only 24 hours
away for anyone who calls in a complaint. Ask a resident like Jose
Roy Garcia of Sun Valley, and he'll scoff at that claim.</LD>
<LD>   Now the city is being put to the test.</LD>
<TE>   Saturday, Councilwoman Wendy Greuel launched a "pothole patrol" in
her district and pledged to fill "within days" every pothole logged
that day.</TE>
<TE>   With the city's top pothole-patching official at her side, Greuel
shoveled asphalt into a tire-eating crater in North Hollywood to
start the campaign, which included a search for dumped furniture,
graffiti and cracked sidewalks.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Robertson, assistant director of the Bureau of Street
Repairs, said crews would work through the weekend to fill potholes
and remove dumped furniture.</TE>
<TE>   "See how easy that was?" commented Garcia, 47, after watching
Greuel fill a 2-foot-square pothole. "That took only 10 minutes. Why
not just have a truck go up and down the streets and do this? I've
been here over 20 years, and the city has never been good about
giving us services."</TE>
<TE>   Robertson said his workers patch about 200,000 street holes,
three-quarters of them spotted by roving crews.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia's pet peeve is a gaping pothole, about 4 square feet, that
has been in his neighborhood for a week. A city crew came by Thursday
and put up a barricade but didn't fill the hole, he said. "I want to
know how long it will take to fix it," he told Arturo Gonzalez,
Greuel's field deputy.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll do it very soon," Gonzalez promised.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Garcia wondered whether the pothole campaign will
quietly die if a proposal on the fall ballot fails to split the
Valley from the city of Los Angeles. "We're happy to see that they're
out here doing this," he said as workers tidied up Greuel's
handiwork. "But what happens after November?"</TE>
<TE>   The councilwoman said her pothole pledge has nothing to do with
the secession campaign. "I'm out here doing this because I think what
people want to know is whether their council members are doing their
jobs," Greuel said.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel, who took office in April, says she does not believe
secession is the answer to Valley residents' complaints of being
ignored by City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   By midafternoon, 54 volunteers had logged 287 potholes, 24 badly
cracked sidewalks, 11 places needing graffiti removal and 55 bulky
items dumped in public places. Greuel's district reaches from Van
Nuys to Sunland-Tujunga.</TE>
<TE>   Like Garcia, Lillian Scharf, 82, of North Hollywood was glad to
see the attention but was skeptical that her own problem will be
fixed. She said she has repeatedly asked the city to fix a
dangerously buckled sidewalk in front of her home.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't tell you how many times they've been out here and marked
the pavement. They said, 'We'll be back in two weeks. We'll be back
in two months.' It's been five years."</TE>
<TE>   Greuel and Robertson promised her the repair will begin this week.</TE>
<TE>   The city's toll-free number for reporting potholes is (800)
996-2489.</TE>

<HD>Tight Market Slams Door on Renters</HD>
<DH>Housing: Experts say available apartments are becoming so
rare and expensive that many low- and middle-income workers are
forced to move out of the county.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA BLANCHARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Leah Coulter has done everything she can think of to find an
apartment in Ventura County since moving from Chatsworth in March.</LD>
<LD>   She pored over classified ads, which yielded nothing but a handful
of apartments well out of her price range. She walked through
neighborhoods, knocking on doors and inquiring about rental
possibilities.</LD>
<LD>   She even wrote letters to 40 homeowners, asking if they would be
interested in leasing out their guest houses. She has yet to receive
a response.</LD>
<TE>   So, for the past four months Coulter, 38, has been staying with
friends in Newbury Park and commuting to her job at an Oxnard real
estate agency.</TE>
<TE>   Real estate analysts say the rental market is so tight, and
available apartments and houses are becoming so rare and expensive,
that many low- and middle-income workers are slowly being forced to
move out of the county.</TE>
<TE>   "We're living in one of the places in the world where everybody
wants to live, figuratively," said Paul Sheehan of the Dyer Sheehan
Group, a Ventura-based real estate consulting firm. The housing
shortage will continue to be a problem, he said, "as long as there
are people out there who can reach in their pocket and pay the higher
costs."</TE>
<TE>   The apartment vacancy rate dipped to a mere 1.69% in July,
according to preliminary findings by the Dyer Sheehan Group, which
conducts biannual surveys of 18,000 apartments in Ventura County.
That figure is well below the desired rate of about 5%, which is
considered healthy, allowing both tenants and landlords to be
selective.</TE>
<TE>   "It's approaching a crisis situation," said Kay Wilson-Bolton,
owner of Century 21 Buenavista and Century 21 Ojai Valley. Of the 300
units her agencies manage in Santa Paula, Fillmore and Ojai, there is
only one vacancy.</TE>
<TE>   "There are very few places for people to go, and competition is
excessive," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Harried real estate agents from around the county report being
swamped with applications from desperate apartment hunters, even for
listings that are sight-unseen.</TE>
<TE>   Renters are snapping up apartments and houses, with some of the
highest rents and lowest vacancy rates occurring in the east end of
the county. The average rent for a two-bedroom apartment countywide
is $1,261.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very grim," said Elaine Pettersen, owner of Hacienda Realty
in Camarillo and past president of Coastal Real Estate Assn.
Pettersen said she sees an increasing number of people looking at
purchasing a home and paying a mortgage, rather than continuing to
pay the going rate for an apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Because it's been a landlord's market for about six years, many
apartment managers and land management companies have had the
opportunity to be very selective about their potential tenants,
Wilson-Bolton said.</TE>
<TE>   "Some [owners] are even requesting full background checks on
potential tenants, because they want the 'best of the best,' and
that's maybe one way to determine it," Wilson-Bolton said.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, so much competition for the few apartments
available means property owners don't have to make much of an effort
to attract prospective tenants, said Dawn Dyer, president of the Dyer
Sheehan Group.</TE>
<TE>   "Landlords have less incentive to improve their units," she said.
"Not that all of them don't, but if they have a renter lined up,
there's no real need to clean a unit, make improvements to the
building, and so on."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County has long been a difficult rental market to break
into, but analysts say it is rapidly reaching the point where it may
negatively affect the county's economy.</TE>
<TE>   "We are just not producing housing that meets the demands of the
types of jobs we're producing," Dyer said.</TE>
<TE>   "And, unfortunately, we may start to see negative impacts to our
economic base if we can't do something. Companies may choose not to
expand here or may relocate to other areas. At the very least, it
certainly impacts a company's ability to recruit and retain good
employees."</TE>
<TE>   The same factors that have fueled the current rental housing
shortage--natural population growth, a strong economy and a shortage
of available apartments and houses to rent--still exist, and are not
very likely to change anytime soon, Dyer said.</TE>
<TE>   That isn't comforting for Coulter, who estimates she has spent an
average of 12 hours each week on her apartment search.</TE>
<TE>   She says she can stay with friends until October, and that she
will just keep looking.</TE>
<TE>   But after four months of fruitless searching, it's hard not to get
frustrated. "There's just nothing out there," she said.</TE>

<HD>Fire Risk Increased by Fuel, Terrain</HD>
<DH>Danger: Those living near wild lands are particularly
vulnerable to fast-moving blazes. Heat and drought heighten the
threat.</DH>

<LD>It could be a cigarette, flicked carelessly out a car window. A blue
spray of sparks kicked up by a low-leaning motorcycle on a sharp
mountain curve. An arsonist, an illegal campfire, a dry lightning
strike on a lazy fall day.</LD>
<LD>   This much is certain: One day, a fire will start in the majestic,
jungle-thick forest ringing Lake Arrowhead. And if conditions are
right--if the day is hot, if the Santa Ana winds are blowing, if the
brush has been baked dry by the sun--one of Southern California's
most beloved vacation spots will become a raging circle of fire.</LD>
<LD>   "If a fire got going here ... it would be catastrophic," said Bob
Hertel, an architectural inspector at Lake Arrowhead. Then he
corrected himself: "It's not a matter of if," he said, "but when."</LD>
<TE>   Ask any Southern California fire chief which places are at highest
risk this summer, with conditions the driest on record, and he will
answer that the risk is equally high wherever houses abut wild land.
But some places, he might concede, are more equal than others. Dozens
of communities in Southern California, Lake Arrowhead among them,
have been built on a dare, in places where nature could readily
reclaim them.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters weigh a range of factors--climate, topography,
building styles, road width, fire history--as they consider which
places are most vulnerable to, and least defensible from, fire.</TE>
<TE>   Lake Arrowhead, where the forest has been allowed to grow
unchecked since the area was clear-cut by loggers in the late 1800s,
is near the top of many experts' lists of at-risk places. There,
nearly all the danger signals converge.</TE>
<TE>   Also at high risk is Topanga Canyon, where the Santa Ana wind can
blow like a bellows and roads dotted with wooden houses snake up
brush-choked ravines. So are most of the "front range" communities
along the San Bernardino and San Gabriel mountains--places such as
Redlands and Upland, Sierra Madre and Tujunga.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, Fire Chief Bob Roper worries especially about
portions of the Ojai Valley, Camarillo Heights, Conejo Valley,
Wildwood Park, Ventu Park and some of the hilly places where Thousand
Oaks spills into brushland.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Stephen Miller of the Orange County Fire Department declined
to single out any communities, saying all are at risk. But a map of
the county's highest-risk areas shows hot spots abutting parts of
Irvine, San Juan Capistrano and San Clemente.</TE>
<TE>   Battalion Chief Mark Stormes of the Los Angeles Fire Department
described his worst-case scenario: "A night-time, wind-driven,
mountain-area fire. Everybody's home. Everybody's in bed."</TE>
<TE>   Where could that happen? He pointed to the map, vast swaths of
which were colored red for danger.</TE>
<TE>   "All of the canyons," he said, "probably from the 405 to the
Hollywood Freeway."</TE>
<TE>   Asst. Chief Herbert Spitzer of the L.A. County Fire Department has
his own mental list of disasters waiting to happen: Glendale,
Pasadena, Claremont, La Verne, Malibu and Pomona are among the names
on it.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer also has this nightmarish vision: A fire breaks out along
the Golden State Freeway frontage of Griffith Park in Los Angeles. It
spreads unchecked through rugged canyons up and over the top of the
park, driven by strong Santa Ana winds. The wind shoots showers of
glowing embers onto tightly packed neighborhoods in Los Feliz, Silver
Lake, Hollywood. A wild-land fire becomes an urban conflagration</TE>
<TE>   "That," said Spitzer, "wouldn't be a very friendly fire at all."</TE>
<TE>   It would join a long list of unfriendly fires in California, from
the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire to the 1993 blazes that
swept through Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The worst was the Oakland Hills fire of October 1991. Ignited in
brush, it blew through hillside neighborhoods that had long prided
themselves on balancing urban life with nature. Within hours, 25
people were dead and nearly 3,000 homes had been destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   The Oakland blaze prompted redrafting of building codes to make
homes in fire-prone areas less likely to ignite. Along with the 1993
fires in Southern California, it also pushed people to reconsider
their notions of beauty. Is manzanita beautiful or ominous when it
nuzzles up to a wooden patio deck? What's lovelier, an overhanging
fir or a firebreak? And it prompted the state to undertake the
massive task of classifying the places in California at highest risk
of wildfire. Portions of more than 100 cities or counties in
California were designated as Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones,
roughly two-thirds of them in the five-county Southern California
region. These places are generally held to more stringent building
and zoning standards by local officials.</TE>
<TE>   Such zoning is not, however, a foolproof guide. The assessments
were made in the mid-1990s and have not, in many cases, been updated.
And many jurisdictions were exempted because they already had tough
fire-safety guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   "As a result, true hazards throughout the state were not
necessarily identified," according to the state's Field Hazard Zoning
Field Guide, published in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters, for the most part, know where the hazards are. As
human encroachment into wilderness has grown, so has fire science.</TE>
<TE>   They know, for instance, that steep slopes burn faster than flat
places. That south-facing slopes, which receive more sun, are more
likely to burn than north ones. That a place that hasn't burned for
many years will have more fuel and be harder to control than a place
that has burned recently.</TE>
<TE>   They know which kinds of buildings survive best, and how wide a
road needs to be to allow fire engines in while residents head out.
That tree limbs drooping near the ground can catch fire and spread it
to the crown, where the flames can jump from treetop to treetop--the
hardest kind of fire to fight.</TE>
<TE>   One gauge of danger is the burn index, a measurement of the
relative difficulty of fire control. In a winter rainstorm, the burn
index would be zero. The highest it can go is 350, a largely
hypothetical peak that might be reached on a broiling fall day when
humidity is near zero and strong winds are buffeting a steep
south-facing slope of extremely dry brush.</TE>
<TE>   "When the Old Topanga fire burned [in 1993], it was running in the
170 to 190 range in the Santa Monica Mountains," said Spitzer, the
county fire official. "Any time you get up there to those kinds of
numbers--160, 170--those fires are going to be very difficult to
control."</TE>
<TE>   Several weeks ago, Spitzer noted that the fire index in the Santa
Clarita area of northern Los Angeles County was 191. Shortly after
that, firefighters struggled to control blazes on two consecutive
days there. The fires charred 400 acres and damaged one home.</TE>
<TE>   A key component of the burn index is what firefighters call "live
fuel moisture," a way of expressing a plant's water content. When the
water in a plant weighs 60% as much as its dry material, live brush
burns as if it were dead. Much lower, and the plants die.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, where last winter's rainfall was the lowest
on record, the live fuel moisture at the end of June averaged 72%. By
mid-July, it was just above 60%--normal for the beginning of
November, when plants typically are at their driest, but unheard of
for the middle of summer.</TE>
<TE>   "We're into new ground. We've never been here before," Spitzer
said.</TE>
<TE>   Not all disastrous fire seasons have followed extremely dry
winters. Some of the worst--1978 and 1993--followed wet winters, when
rainfall nurtured plants that were then dried by the summer heat.</TE>
<TE>   What worries fire officials this year is not an overgrowth of
brush from last winter but the trees and brush that have grown over
many years, protected by vigilant firefighting policies.</TE>
<TE>   You can see this growth by the truckload any day at the Heaps Peak
dump near Lake Arrowhead, to which anxious homeowners are carting
mountains of brush and tree limbs, some of it built up over decades.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Minnich, a professor of earth science at UC Riverside, has
spent years studying the forests and brush lands of Southern
California and northern Baja California. At the moment, he said, the
Lake Arrowhead-Crestline area has the densest forest in the region.
It's two to three times as thick as similar terrain in Baja, where
Mexican officials have allowed fires to burn periodically over the
years.</TE>
<TE>   When fires burn in Mexican forests, he said, they have a
rejuvenating effect, clearing out deadwood and leaving the strongest
trees alive. That wouldn't happen today around Lake Arrowhead, he
said. Not only are forests dangerously dense, many trees are dead or
dying from a bark beetle infestation.</TE>
<TE>   Most homes are built of wood, many with wooden roofs. Given the
right conditions, a fire could incinerate everything in its path.
"You could change the whole ecosystem in one event," Minnich said.</TE>
<TE>   His is not exactly a voice in the wilderness--not anymore. His
warning is echoed by Donna Newlin, a resident of the Smiley Park area
just southeast of Lake Arrowhead, parts of which burned in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "A fire that would burn in here," she said, "would be so intense
that you couldn't even get close."</TE>
<TE>   Newlin, a member of the ski patrol at a nearby resort, scrambled
down the slope behind her home, an airy, alpine-styled place with a
big wooden deck. She and her husband, a Redlands firefighter, have
done what they could to protect themselves. Their roof is made of
fire-resistant composite materials. They have cleared brush and
trimmed trees in a wide ring around the house. They keep their garden
well watered.</TE>
<TE>   But Newlin recognizes certain realities. The house faces south and
stares into a ravine--known in fire science as a "chimney." The road
leading to their home is narrow and winding--a dubious reach for a
fire engine. And beyond their land is an area that hasn't burned for
the better part of a century.</TE>
<TE>   Newlin is active in the Mountain Rim Fire Safe Council, which
works to raise awareness of fire danger, and has helped get grants to
clear brush around Smiley Park. Near her home is one such area that
was cleared: The forest floor is sun-dappled for the first time in
years, and so many broomstick-sized trees have been removed that
Newlin's husband was able to build a Frisbee golf course.</TE>
<TE>   A fire that started there might be relatively easy to put out. Not
so behind the Newlin residence.</TE>
<TE>   "Why do we live here?" she said. "It's beautiful, it's quiet, we
have a lot of space. The kids can ride their bikes all over the
neighborhood without being afraid of getting hit by a car."</TE>
<TE>   A homeowner can do only so much to protect herself. Ultimately,
vast tracts of forest will have to be thinned before this place can
be anything close to safe.</TE>
<TE>   Fire officials speak of creating "defensible space" to retard the
growth of fires. They also talk of fires "coming into alignment,"
meaning conditions are ripe for a fire to spread. Minnich considered
what might happen if the forces align this summer, if a fire breaks
out in Southern California in the wrong place at the wrong time.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an indefensible situation," he said.</TE>

<HD>Santa Ana's Investment in Shade</HD>
<DH>Environment: The city's tree-planting program aims to make
its image softer, future greener.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Ana will plant 1,000 more trees in the coming months to cap an
effort that has brought more trees to the city than most area
communities its size and age.</LD>
<LD>   The city boasts 2,037 trees per square mile, more than five
neighboring cities. By the beginning of next year, the city will end
its planting program, which began in the late 1980s, and focus on
maintenance.</LD>
<LD>   The planting represents the city's commitment to soften the
asphalt and concrete effect in this city of 335,000 better known for
its large influx of immigrants.</LD>
<TE>   City Manager David N. Ream said the goal is to plant on every
street that doesn't have a tree.</TE>
<TE>   "We really think a streetscape is important," he said. "It can add
a lot of value to a home, besides a lot of shade to a neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   Public Works maintenance manager Manuel Gomez said that for the
last six years, the city has invested $1.5 million a year in planting
and maintaining trees. Ream said the campaign was intensified in the
late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Trees are planted mostly on parkways, the strips of city property
between a street and sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   Gomez said 30 species were planted. Adjacent streets usually
receive the same kind of tree. The list includes jacaranda, queen
palm, oak, magnolia, ash and willow.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning next year, the city generally will plant trees only when
others die or are knocked over--about 300 a year, Gomez said.</TE>
<TE>   It's a way to ensure some greenery in an urban environment.</TE>
<TE>   "We are lacking in open space," Gomez said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a way to compensate.... We are probably more aggressive
than most cities."</TE>
<TE>   Newer cities don't need to plant many trees because developers
generally do it.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Bourke, Irvine's public works superintendent, said older
cities have the advantage of homes with their own parkways. Newer
homes are usually built without them to save on land costs, and often
come with a common area with trees planted by the developer.</TE>
<TE>   Although Irvine counts 53,000 city trees outside its parks, there
are probably that many trees planted by developers in private
complexes, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana City Councilwoman Lisa Bist said trees help keep
temperatures down.</TE>
<TE>   "It's beautification and it's cooling," she said. "It's a good
idea in an inland city in Southern California."</TE>
<TE>   Retired electrician Henry Mayerhoffer said he and his neighbors on
West Flora Street watched as city employees planted dozens of
Australian willows about six months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Some older trees were removed because their leaves block storm
drains.</TE>
<TE>   "The old trees were messy. Now we have new ones and more of them.
I really enjoy them," said Mayerhoffer, 75, who has planted lemon,
nectarine, eucalyptus, banana and palms on his property and welcomed
the city's willows. "They suck in carbon monoxide and that is what we
need. It cleans our air."</TE>

<HD>Secessionists Battered by Setbacks</HD>
<DH>Breakup: Problems include a dearth of candidates and
sluggish fund-raising. Leaders say the campaign will peak in time for
the election.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY and SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A series of setbacks and missteps this month have cast a gloom over
the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood secession campaigns and put the
leadership under pressure from supporters to be more aggressive in
recruiting backers and raising money.</LD>
<LD>   Secession leaders say that the situation is not as grim as some
inside and outside the movement claim and they are building campaigns
that can be sustained over the nearly four months before the Nov. 5
election.</LD>
<LD>   But even the staunchest secession supporters say the campaigns
have to quickly overcome the reversals that have marked the early
weeks of the drive to break up Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   "It's been a tough month. It's very discouraging," Valley VOTE
board member Carlos Ferreyra said. "We are moving forward but we have
been set back a couple of steps."</TE>
<TE>   The campaigns have been hurt by the disclosure that Valley
secession leaders Richard Close and David Fleming held secret talks
about possibly removing the cityhood measures from the ballot in
favor of a borough plan. Close further angered his fellow
secessionists when he threatened to file a lawsuit if voters citywide
reject the breakup measures.</TE>
<TE>   The secession campaigns also suffered when state Sen. Richard
Alarcon (D-Sylmar) announced that he would not run for mayor of a new
Valley city but would fight to keep Los Angeles intact. That leaves
Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge) as the only declared
candidate for mayor.</TE>
<TE>   The secessionists have been unable to attract other well-known
candidates for mayor and council of the proposed cities. Their cause
has won no major endorsements, beyond those of Valley-area chambers
of commerce and, in the case of Hollywood, Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante.
Plus, their fund-raising has been sluggish.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Mayor James K. Hahn's campaign against secession has
enlisted one big-name backer after another--including former Lakers
star Earvin "Magic" Johnson--and has raised $1.6 million to the
secessionists' $300,000.</TE>
<TE>   Jaime Regalado, executive director of the Pat Brown Institute of
Public Affairs at Cal State Los Angeles, said the secession campaigns
have lost momentum. "It's going to be an uphill battle," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And Joel Kotkin, a Valley political scientist who favors
secession, said the movement is beset by "incompetent leadership."</TE>
<TE>   But former Assemblyman Richard Katz, chairman of the Valley
Independence Committee, said the campaigns are just now emerging from
the planning stage. The number of volunteers has reached 3,000, block
captains are being organized and financial contributions are coming
in, Katz and other leaders said.</TE>
<TE>   "Campaigns go through cycles," Katz said. "If the opponents are
peaking right now, that's great. We will peak in November."</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood secession campaign will send out its first
fund-raising letter next week and has hired an experienced staff of
political operatives, said Hollywood Independence Committee President
Gene La Pietra. He and other board members have contributed $160,000
to the effort.</TE>
<TE>   "Ours just started. We've got a lot of catch-up," La Pietra said.
"There is an excitement. People believe this is actually going to
happen."</TE>
<TE>   The cityhood backers are pinning big hopes on a large number of
candidates filing nominating petitions for Valley and Hollywood
offices before the Aug. 9 deadline. They had predicted up to 150
would sign up for mayor and 14 council seats in the Valley, but only
35 had taken out papers as of Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Eight candidates have begun the paperwork to run for the five
Hollywood council seats.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Mardesich, a leader of harbor-area secession drive that
failed to make the ballot, said the Valley and Hollywood campaigns
should have done more to recruit candidates early on.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an error on their part," he said. "They thought once it
got approved for the ballot there would be a stampede of candidates.
They should have started recruiting candidates last year."</TE>
<TE>   Valley VOTE President Jeff Brain said more than 90 people are
considering runs for the Valley and Hollywood offices that will not
exist if the secession measures lose.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if we have 50 candidates, that's a lot of money and effort
spent to promote themselves and the cause," Brain said.</TE>
<TE>   Jay Rosenzweig, a Valley council candidate, said the campaign will
pick up steam in the weeks ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a marathon. The other side is sprinting way faster than
us right now, but it's not necessary to do that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But other secession supporters expressed frustration at a Valley
VOTE meeting last week.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Volper, who has provided T-shirts for the cause, said his
heart trusts that the campaign will prevail.</TE>
<TE>   "But my mind wants to ask why nothing has been done in our
campaign," he told the Valley VOTE board. "The tide is tilting not in
our favor."</TE>
<TE>   Gerry Gunster, a political consultant hired by the secessionists,
told the gathering the campaign has a detailed plan. But he declined
to discuss it because reporters were present.</TE>
<TE>   Noticeably absent from the meeting was Katz, who has spent much of
his time in Sacramento recently as an unpaid advisor to Gov. Gray
Davis. And though Katz and secession campaign co-chair Laurette
Healey said they are confident of winning in the fall, both have
mixed records at the polls.</TE>
<TE>   Katz lost his last election, for the state Senate, to Alarcon, and
Healey lost by a wide margin to Laura Chick in last year's race for
city controller.</TE>
<TE>   At City Hall, officials say they are not taking victory for
granted, but some are beginning to gloat.</TE>
<TE>   "The Hollywood and Valley secession movements are sinking like a
lead balloon," said David Gershwin, a spokesman for City Council
President Alex Padilla.</TE>
<TE>   Summing up the battle between Hahn and Valley secessionists,
secession supporter Kotkin said, "The powers of inertia are
triumphing over the ill-organized supporters of change."</TE>

<HD>Resort Was an Oasis for Blacks Until Racism Drove Them Out</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>CECILIA RASMUSSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A small green park on the Strand in Manhattan Beach is dedicated to
international brotherhood these days, but it began as a beach resort
for black Angelenos that was destroyed by racism in the 1920s.</LD>
<LD>   In its heyday during the 1910s and '20s, the resort was called
Bruces' Beach. It offered ocean breezes, bathhouses, outdoor sports,
dining and dancing to hundreds of African Americans who craved a
taste of Southern California's good life.</LD>
<LD>   Now the oasis is called Parque Culiacan. Since the 1970s, its name
has signified the friendship between the California beach community
and its sister city in Mexico's Sinaloa state.</LD>
<TE>   No sign in the parque recalls the history of Bruces' Beach. No
monument memorializes one of Manhattan Beach's founders,
developer-benefactor George Peck, or the beach resort's black
founders, Charles and Willa Bruce. When the Bruces built it, there
were no resorts on Los Angeles' coast that welcomed blacks.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the resort endures only in books, in the memories of a few
elderly townsfolk and in faded snapshots of happy summers and
weekends. But yellowed clippings in scrapbooks and a 1956 thesis by a
local resident, Robert L. Brigham, tell its story.</TE>
<TE>   When Manhattan Beach was incorporated in 1912, with 600 residents,
Peck flouted tradition and set aside a two-block area fronting the
ocean between 26th and 27th streets and Highland Avenue for minority
residents.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruces, born during the Civil War in Union parts of the United
States, were the first black Americans to buy lots. On their
adjoining oceanfront lots they built the resort that bore their name.
By 1919, four other black families owned cottages alongside
white-owned lots.</TE>
<TE>   Little is known about the Bruces. Census records of 1920 show that
Charles Aaron Bruce had been born in Washington, D.C., and worked as
a cook most of his life. Willa, who was sometimes known as Willie,
had been born in Missouri. Their son, Harvey, was born in New Mexico
about 1888 and had worked as a cook for the railroads.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1920s, most Los Angeles real estate was bought and sold
under racially restrictive covenants that had been enacted to keep
neighborhoods white. Hotels, restaurants, beaches and parks barred
blacks.</TE>
<TE>   But Peck, who sold real estate out of a tent, helped the Bruces
and their black neighbors build a fishing pier, all the while tossing
out fistfuls of coins for black and white children along the
boardwalk.</TE>
<TE>   As coastal land became more valuable and Los Angeles' black
population increased--bringing more African Americans to Bruces'
Beach--so did whites' hostility and racism.</TE>
<TE>   The California Eagle, an influential black newspaper in Los
Angeles, reported on July 4, 1924, that three blacks had been fishing
off the Redondo Beach Pier when several members of the Ku Klux Klan
handed them a pamphlet titled "Principles of KKK and Ideals of PURE
AMERICANISM."</TE>
<TE>   In the margin of one of the pages someone had scrawled: "Colored
Folks Beach three miles north"--in other words, telling them to move
along to Bruces'.</TE>
<TE>   Soon the Klan's bigoted tentacles spread to Manhattan Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Klansmen organized a 24-hour phone committee to intimidate and
terrorize the Bruces anonymously. Blacks who ventured off the Bruces'
roped-off beach were harassed and insulted by hooded white men who
slashed or let the air out of their tires. They also torched a house,
set fire to a mattress under the Bruces' deck, and posted "10 minutes
only" parking signs. They burned a cross nearby.</TE>
<TE>   When harassment failed to drive the Bruces and other blacks out of
town, city officials condemned the neighborhood in 1924, ostensibly
to build a park, although Live Oak Park was already nearby. Four
percent of the city's population petitioned against the condemnation,
to no avail.</TE>
<TE>   City officials tried pressuring the black property owners to sell
at prices below fair market value. Four of the five families refused,
including the Bruces, so the city attempted to seize the land under
eminent domain.</TE>
<TE>   Manhattan Beach officials insisted that the common good should
take precedence over the interests of a few families who could easily
and "equitably" be moved.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruces and three other families sued, alleging racial
prejudice. The Bruces demanded $120,000 in compensation--$70,000 for
their two lots and $50,000 in damages--but specified that they really
wanted the land, not the money. Another plaintiff asked for $6,500.
They failed to stop the condemnation proceedings, but the judge put a
crimp in the city's complaint. He insisted that the ejected property
owners had the right to purchase property elsewhere in the city, just
not on the Strand. He said he would "throw the case right out of
court" if the black families' rights were not guaranteed. Although
the resort was closed, black Angelenos continued to flock to Bruces'
Beach. Nearby, a City Council crony put up a "no trespassing" sign on
city property, making it illegal to enter Bruces'.</TE>
<TE>   In 1927, a black UCLA student, Elizabeth Cately, 19, was arrested
for swimming and "trespassing" on the "private beach." Manhattan
Beach police refused to allow her even to change into dry clothes and
kept her in jail for five hours.</TE>
<TE>   Others, too, were soon arrested, and that's when the National
Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People stepped in. The lawyer
for the NAACP got the City Council crony to admit the sign had been
meant only to deter blacks, and the sign was removed.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, the California Eagle's banner headline crowed:
"NAACP Wins Beach Victory."</TE>
<TE>   But the victory was short-lived. That same year, Bruces' Beach
Resort was razed, along with other cottages in the two-block area.</TE>
<TE>   Pending a final legal resolution, the owners' group held out for
another two years before the city finally settled on payment. The
Bruces received $14,500 and left the city. Other plaintiffs received
between $2,000 and $4,000--as did their white neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   All but the Bruces took the judge up on his order and purchased
property elsewhere in town. But the only black beach resort in Los
Angeles was history.</TE>
<TE>   Black Angelenos began spreading their blankets on a blacks-only
section of Santa Monica beach near Pico Boulevard called the Inkwell.
It had been established in 1924.</TE>
<TE>   Manhattan Beach didn't rush to build its park; for almost three
decades, the property remained vacant. In the 1950s, City Treasurer
Lee Younggren estimated that the vacancy had cost the town about
$80,000 in compensation fees and tax and assessment losses.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, in the 1950s, the Manhattan Beach Recreation Commission
began to worry that heirs of the former property owners might sue to
regain their land unless it was used for the purpose for which it had
been originally taken. The park was born.</TE>

<HD>Gang Truces All but Forgotten as Homicides Soar</HD>
<DH>Crime: Police and activists seek new ways to stop the
killings. Only a treaty in Watts is still functioning, and a Valley
cease-fire is in the works.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ten years ago, the gangs of the Watts housing projects signed a peace
treaty. Other truces followed in South Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   San Fernando Valley gangs agreed to their own peace accord in
1993, a year in which Los Angeles police counted 346 gang-related
homicides in the city.</LD>
<LD>   By 1999, thanks to factors including law enforcement efforts and
the treaties, gang killings in the city dropped to 136.</LD>
<TE>   But now, except in Watts, the treaties no longer seem to be
working. Gang-related killings last year matched the 1993 total,
police say. And, at the current pace, this year's total could be even
higher.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I remember hearing about the truce," said 20-year-old Jose
"Chuy'' Gonzalez. "I remember hearing about JFK getting killed too."</TE>
<TE>   Like others, he recalled the peace treaty as if it were part of a
history lesson.</TE>
<TE>   Alejandro Novoa of the Pacoima Project Boys pulled his Chevy to a
stop in an alley next to the San Fernando Gardens housing project on
Van Nuys Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, the treaty was so good because I could go out shopping,
could go out and have fun and not worry about being shot," Novoa
said. "But now, you can't go nowhere. It's worse than before."</TE>
<TE>   Novoa, 24, blames the violence on "the rookies," young and new
gang members trying to earn a reputation for being fearless.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles police said there had been 158 gang killings through
May, the most recent statistics available. At that pace, gang
killings would surpass 370 for the year.</TE>
<TE>   Many police, gang-intervention workers and community activists
agree that the resurgence in killings is related to newcomers who had
nothing to do with the pacts from years ago. Gang membership has
changed and some new gangs have emerged, they said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, some are critical of efforts such as truces and
treaties, saying that they do little to address the core problem of
youths joining gangs and getting involved in illegal activities.</TE>
<TE>   "The gang treaties of the 1990s were a temporary, short-term fix
that have not lasted," said Lt. Gary Nanson, commander of the Los
Angeles Police Department's Valley Bureau gang unit. "We readily
credited the lull to the peace treaties, but we don't know that for
sure. We like to think they helped."</TE>
<TE>   Nanson and others said their goal remains to find ways to keep
youths from ever joining gangs.</TE>
<TE>   Some police and activists support the multi-agency, anti-gang
Community Law Enforcement and Recovery program, which has been
credited with reducing crime in various neighborhoods by combining
the resources of the police, city and county district attorneys, and
parole and probation departments.</TE>
<TE>   "CLEAR is one of the best policing programs the LAPD has ever been
a part of," said Sgt. Andrew Chase, head of the gang unit at Pacific,
adding that the program is currently in only a handful of the city's
18 police divisions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the way gang violence will be targeted in the future
citywide," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Though crime persists in Watts, it is not a result of gang
rivalries, according to gang members, residents and LAPD Capt. Dick
Bonneau of the Southeast Division.</TE>
<TE>   Police and community activists say that in addition to organizing
a sports league and celebrating the anniversary of the truce, some
residents of the area rush to quash any potential problems when they
arise.</TE>
<TE>   They said that several gang members who recently had been released
from prison were not very receptive to the idea of a cease-fire, but
peacemakers intervened.</TE>
<TE>   "We school those guys that get out and try to be destructive,"
said Daude Sherrills, 34, an activist from the Jordan Downs housing
projects. "We educate them on the value of the treaty and of unity.
We work at it all the time. You've got to work on the healing."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Martinez, a consultant who teaches gang intervention at Cal
State Los Angeles, said the newcomers who make it through the current
violent times may be the ones who ultimately make a push to stop the
killing.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to go through the rough times to appreciate the value of
peace," said Martinez, who credits the treaties as a major reason for
the drop in homicides in the 1990s. "The kids on the streets are
going through those rough times now."</TE>
<TE>   William "Blinky" Rodriguez, who helped broker the peace effort in
the Valley in 1993, said a new treaty, actually a cease-fire, is in
the works.</TE>
<TE>   "You can sense the excitement in my voice because it has taken a
long time to get back to this," said Rodriguez, a former professional
kick boxer and boxing manager who got into the peace movement after
his 16-year-old son was gunned down. "The 'hoods are willing to talk
again."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez feels the truce from nearly 10 years ago was a learning
experience.</TE>
<TE>   "We have more experience, more infrastructure," said Rodriguez,
executive director of the nonprofit Communities in Schools, a social
service agency that does job training but specializes in gang
prevention and hard-core intervention. "It's more of a group effort
this time. Police. More community organizations. Churches. More grass
roots. Hopefully, more gang members."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Chief Ronald Bergman, commander of the Valley Bureau, went
to Rodriguez last year to discuss what could be done to combat the
rise in gang crime. That led to several strategy meetings this year
with community organizations, parole officers, probation officers,
elected officials and police.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez, while recognizing the seriousness of gang violence,
passionately argues that the public in general and the police in
particular stereotype all gang members.</TE>
<TE>   "I recognize the need to suppress the guys who are out of
control," Rodriguez said. "But they are not all shooters. Not all
terrorists. You got 50 guys from a 'hood, maybe three of them are
crazy. But you got 47 guys that are OK."</TE>

<SE> One in an occasional series of conversations with
California voters.</SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FORTUNA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>FORTUNA, Calif.--Corky Cornwell is the picture of small-town
prosperity, with his ample belly, ruddy cheeks and the service-club
pin neatly fixed to the lapel of his tweed sport jacket.</LD>
<LD>   His chain of six cell phone stores is thriving, even as much of
the North Coast struggles economically. As Cornwell says, the little
gadgets are as much a staple these days as bread or milk.</LD>
<LD>   But his hail-fellow disposition melted at the mention of WorldCom,
one of the blackest hats in the recent parade of corporate villains.
"Terrible, terrible," Cornwell sputtered. "I wish I had that CEO
standing right here. I'd punch him right in the nose."</LD>
<TE>   But Cornwell doesn't want or expect the government to start
storming the boardrooms of America to haul off its wayward
chieftains. "We have enough government control," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Platt isn't counting on much of a corporate crackdown either.
The rangy 24-year-old, who makes a living as a glass blower in the
woods around the Trinity River, was on a weekly grocery run to one of
Eureka's natural-food stores. "That's kind of how things go in
America," he said, shrugging off the growing litany of blue-chip
malfeasance. "Corporations run the world."</TE>
<TE>   For more than a decade, California's North Coast was one of the
country's most polarized places. Loggers and environmentalists
occasionally waged literal hand-to-hand combat over the region's
primeval forests, part of a bigger fight between hard-pressed locals
and a hard-charging Texas businessman. The result left few satisfied;
the only consensus here seems to be a shared skepticism about big
business and big government alike.</TE>
<TE>   The fight started in the mid-1980s, after a Houston financier,
Charles Hurwitz, seized control of the family-run Pacific Lumber Co.,
siphoned $60 million from the employees' pension fund, then
dramatically stepped up timber production to service his massive load
of debt.</TE>
<TE>   But the battle was much larger than a struggle over logging; it
was a fight over culture and values and change and who controlled the
region's destiny. It was a battle, too, involving junk bonds, hostile
takeovers and a community's fealty to far-off Wall Street. It was
fought long before talk of business ethics and good corporate
citizenship came into their recent vogue.</TE>
<TE>   After years of confrontation, many here are angry and mistrustful,
fatigued from the skirmishing and perhaps more wary than most about
the nature of unbridled capitalism and whether government has the
ability to rein in capitalism's excesses--or should even try.</TE>
<TE>   Debby Williams was sticking small American flags into the green
flower boxes outside the Antique Depot on Fortuna's main drag as she
lamented how "big CEOs are getting rich dumping companies, and the
little guys are taking the fall." Hurwitz did the same thing, she
went on, "except he did it with logs. He left the timber industry
hanging here."</TE>
<TE>   But it wasn't just corporate exploitation that ravaged the
industry, she said. All around, luxuriant, tree-covered slopes
stretch as far as a human eye could behold--much of it now off-limits
to logging. "A lot has to do with environmentalists and all the rules
you have to go through," Williams went on, with a frown. "You have to
file too many reports. You can't do anything if there's a bird in the
forest."</TE>
<TE>   Irv Parlato, 59, shared that seeming ambivalence. His family
restaurant, famous for its red sauce, has operated in Fortuna for 46
years, and he plies the tidy streets on his mountain bike like a
roving goodwill ambassador.</TE>
<TE>   Back in the 1950s, when the local timber industry was at its peak,
one in two Humboldt County residents worked in the wood-products
business or a related industry. Today that figure is about 8%.
Parlato blames the decline on overly stringent environmental
regulations, which "protect this bird and that salamander" at the
expense of hundreds of workers.</TE>
<TE>   But at the same time, he said, "there has to be more regulation"
of big corporations to prevent the kind of misdeeds that took place
at Enron, the Arthur Andersen accounting firm and, apparently, at
many other major companies. "Some government agency maybe overlooked
those issues," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Decades of accumulated tension peaked here in the 12-year battle
over the Headwaters Forest, which stood as the last unprotected grove
of ancient redwoods on earth.</TE>
<TE>   After taking control of Pacific Lumber, Hurwitz made clear his
intention to cut down the biggest of the trees, some of which date to
the first millennium. Years of lawsuits, bloodshed, mass
demonstrations, thousands of arrests and a widely publicized
tree-perching by environmental activist Julia Butterfly Hill finally
culminated in a government-brokered deal.</TE>
<TE>   Under the 1999 settlement, Pacific Lumber received $480 million
from the state and federal treasuries to permanently set aside
roughly 10,000 acres of North Coast forest. The agreement also
established strict new guidelines for protecting water quality and
wildlife habitat on another 200,000 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Today, neither side is happy with the arrangement. Mary A.
Bulwinkle, a Pacific Lumber spokeswoman, said the company has "given
up a lot over the years. We've gotten more and more restrictions and
are able to harvest less and less." Last year, Pacific Lumber--the
fourth-largest employer in Humboldt County--shuttered two of its huge
redwood processing mills. Its payroll under Hurwitz has shrunk to 900
employees, from a high of 1,500 in the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, anti-logging demonstrations and guerrilla acts of
sabotage continue, though on a much smaller scale than the "Redwood
Summer" protests that drew thousands to the mountainous forests 250
miles north of San Francisco more than a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Bertain, a Eureka lawyer who grew up in the company town of
Scotia, where his family ran Pacific Lumber's laundry operation, said
Hurwitz "destroyed the local economy" with "the complicity of [a lot]
of elected officials and regulators. It's like Edmund Burke said, all
that's necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing."</TE>
<TE>   The resentment on both sides has taken myths and hardened them
into truths, which are lobbed as ammunition in the timber wars.
People talk of the famous Avenue of the Giants stripped bare of its
majestic redwoods, or of Hill's having been seen on a bar stool
during the time she was supposedly spending two years in a tree.</TE>
<TE>   The divide is as simple and complex as the question of whether the
forest is half full or half empty. State Sen. Wes Chesbro, an Arcata
Democrat, joked, "All of my constituents love trees. Half love them
standing up, the other half lying down." The line is an old one,
passed from one generation of North Coast politicians to the next,
like a kind of hard-luck heirloom.</TE>
<TE>   The decade's relentless economic and social turmoil made the
region's 1st Congressional District one of the most tumultuous in the
country. The congressional seat turned over four times in the 1990s,
back and forth between Democrats and Republicans on either side of
the timber industry/environmentalist split. But things have settled
down; the incumbent Democrat, Mike Thompson, is a popular centrist
overwhelmingly elected in 1998 and expected to win a third term
easily in November. Chesbro is also considered a shoo-in for
reelection, and Democrats, who enjoy a huge registration advantage,
are likely to hang onto the area's open Assembly seat.</TE>
<TE>   The race for governor, to the extent anyone here pays attention,
is viewed pretty much as it is elsewhere. While incumbent Democrat
Gray Davis and Republican rival Bill Simon have their partisans,
there is nothing approaching enthusiasm for either man.</TE>
<TE>   "The devil we know versus the devil we don't know," was how J.
Warren Hockaday, head of the Eureka Chamber of Commerce, summed up
the choice.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, an investment banker and political newcomer, is mostly a
mystery. But given the atmosphere, his high-finance background gives
at least some people pause. "I'd definitely want to know more about
how his businesses operated, how ethical they've been and how
successful," said Duncan Thomas, 44, a grocery store maintenance
manager. "Did he make all his money by farming jobs overseas, or did
he pay his employees a decent wage?"</TE>
<TE>   There is a strong sense of isolation here, a separation both
physical and psychological. While most of California was sweltering
last week, the North Coast was swaddled in a blanket of fog. Even in
July, the hillsides are bursting green and carpeted with purple and
yellow wildflowers.</TE>
<TE>   The region accounted for less than 2% of the vote in California's
last statewide election, barely enough for a candidate to bother with
the long trek from Los Angeles or Sacramento. Even though people
understand that, many still feel overlooked and irrelevant. "What we
say doesn't matter," said Greg Siler, 41, who had just gotten off the
graveyard shift fixing heavy machinery at the pulp mill in nearby
Samoa. "You people down there have all the money, so you have all the
clout."</TE>
<TE>   But in some ways, the rest of the country may be just catching up
with the North Coast.</TE>
<TE>   Long before Enron, Tyco and WorldCom gained their notoriety, and
matters like stock fraud and executive excesses became the stuff of
kitchen-table conversation, there was the Headwaters fight and all
that it came to symbolize.</TE>
<TE>   Marilyn, a 55-year-old government worker, laughed--a dry, mordant
chuckle--as she considered the ticker tape of corporate misdeeds. She
would not give her last name because, she said, feelings here are
still too raw. "It seems workers invest huge amounts of time and
money, just to have the rug pulled out from under them," she said,
offering Pacific Lumber as a case in point.</TE>
<TE>   But she's not counting on any politician to fix things. "The way I
feel," she said, with another little laugh, "the politicians are
probably responsible for most of the bad stuff that happens."</TE>

<HD>Worthless Mailers Are Moneymakers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHIRLEY GRINDLE</AU>
<BD>Shirley Grindle is a longtime community activist</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Who among us is not fed up with the overkill of campaign literature
that lands in our mailboxes during the last weeks before an election?
Is it not enough that candidates mail upward of a dozen or so
self-aggrandizing brochures? Now, a new source of campaign fodder
called slate mailers is hitting voter households at a fast and
furious pace.</LD>
<LD>   Slate mailer organizations are uniquely defined and regulated by
the California Political Reform Act. They consist of one or more
individuals who collect money from candidates, ballot measure
proponents and others to produce and distribute slate mailers.</LD>
<LD>   The first slate mailer organizations were closely tied to
political parties--largely the Republicans and Democrats--that used
slate mailers to tell voters which candidates their party was
supporting. Naturally a Republican slate mailer organization promoted
Republican candidates and the Democrat organizations promoted
Democrats.</LD>
<TE>   It didn't take long for those looking for a fast buck to figure
out that slate mailings could be turned into a cash cow because there
are few regulations, and slate mailings can be created with little
effort and cost. As a result, people with access to databases of
voters' names and addresses have formed numerous slate mailer
organizations.</TE>
<TE>   These organizations for the most part now have no association with
political parties or with any particular conservative or liberal
organization. Instead, they operate under innocuous-sounding names
such as the Good Government Guide, Citizens Voting Guide for
Preserving Home Rule, or Police and Fire Services Voters Guide. The
names are specifically chosen to deceive the voting public into
thinking that candidates whose names are listed in the slate mailers
are endorsed by established organizations--when in reality the slate
mailers are produced by only a few people.</TE>
<TE>   The only real asset that these organizations provide to candidates
is the ability to access databases of mailing lists of registered
voters--but these databases are not all that hard to come by in
today's highly computerized world. Just about anyone could get into
this business.</TE>
<TE>   Candidates pay varying amounts to be listed on the slate mailer.
Often, a headliner candidate, such as the president or governor, is
featured on the slate. The high-profile candidate is used to attract
lesser-known candidates--the cash cows who pay varying amounts to
have their name included. One candidate might pay $5,000 to appear on
a slate mailer; another candidate might pay 10 times as much to be
included on a mailer sent to the same database. Each candidate
negotiates separately with the individuals running the slate mailer
organization.</TE>
<TE>   So what is wrong with this scenario? First of all, it's time for
the voters to wise up to these slate mailers. Just because a
candidate's name appears on a slate mailer doesn't mean he or she has
been endorsed by a reputable association or political party. The
truth is that most of the candidates whose names appear on the slate
mailer are listed only because they paid to be listed. And they are
not necessarily endorsed or supported by anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Second, the fact that a slate mailer organization is free to
charge candidates varying amounts for identical services is the same
as providing a discount to certain candidates. The California
Political Reform Act requires that any discounts on printing,
catering for a fund-raiser or other campaign services be considered
as in-kind contributions to the candidate. Whoever provides the
services is supposed to report the value of the in-kind contribution
to the candidate, who then discloses it on his or her campaign
disclosure statement. Mysteriously, discounts offered by slate mailer
organizations are not considered in-kind contributions to the
candidate, which creates a giant loophole in those jurisdictions
where contribution limits are in effect.</TE>
<TE>   Another anomaly in the laws governing slate mailer organizations
is that the individuals operating the organization are allowed to
turn the excess funds into personal income. But a candidate who has
money left over after campaign expenses isn't allowed to pocket the
money for personal use. So the strict rules governing the use of
campaign funds are completely lacking when it comes to slate mailer
organizations. Whatever funds are left over after paying for
producing and distributing the slate mailers are pure profit.</TE>
<TE>   That's why these pseudo-businesses are such cash cows.</TE>
<TE>   One organization recently reported expenses of just under $400,000
for a series of slate mailers for which it received in excess of $2
million from a few candidates and ballot measure committees. That's a
$1.6-million profit.</TE>
<TE>   My advice to all voters is to do what I do with slate
mailers--throw them in the trash can. They no longer represent
endorsements by reputable associations or political parties. They're
merely another form of campaign literature disguised to deceive the
voting public. Once the public realizes this, slate mailers will
cease to have any value to either the candidates or the voters.</TE>

<HD>Regulations on Slate Mailers Put a Muzzle on Free Speech</HD>
<DH>The Constitution protects a local candidate's desire to be
linked with a popular state or national candidate on a slate mailer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES V. LACY</AU>
<BD>James V. Lacy served as counsel to slate mail
publishers in the successful challenge to Proposition 208. He is a
Dana Point resident and chairman of the city Planning Commission.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orange County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday made an ill-advised
bid to regulate the content of election slate mailers, an
increasingly popular campaign tool.</LD>
<LD>   The effort was hardly inspired by the high ideals of a Thomas
Jefferson. Instead, it looks more like a page out of the Tammany Hall
playbook, as well as a form of retribution for Chris Norby's defeat
of Supervisor Cynthia P. Coad last March. But supervisors should have
risen above old divisions created by the proposed airport at the
closed El Toro Marine base and rejected this ill-advised infringement
on freedom of speech.</LD>
<LD>   Slate mailers are widely used in California. Voters receive plenty
of slate mail before each election, often advocating party or
"issue-based" campaigning. Slate mail also is highly regulated by the
state. Publishers must print certain disclosures and file instant
electronic financial disclosure reports with the state; these public
records are open to examination by any interested party.</LD>
<TE>   To avoid conflicts with local government campaign laws, state law
provides that the costs for production and distribution of slate
mailers are not considered contributions or expenditures for
candidates. The state rules explicitly regulate county-only slate
mailers. California has preempted local regulation of slates in favor
of one consistent, logical and statewide set of rules so publishers
won't face potentially conflicting rules in the 58 counties.</TE>
<TE>   State preemption, though, makes local rules unenforceable and
unconstitutional. In addition, slate mail has also been found by a
federal judge to be a highly protected form of speech.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, a federal judge declared the slate mail provisions of
1996's Proposition 208 to be unconstitutional. In the case of
California Prolife Council PAC vs. FPPC, a federal judge determined
that: "Since the slate mailers are a form of 'core political speech,'
I must apply 'exacting scrutiny,' and uphold the restrictions only if
they are narrowly tailored to serve an overriding state interest."</TE>
<TE>   The judge ruled Proposition 208's requirements on slate mail
violated the 1st Amendment. The judge also found that slate mail was
not only an inexpensive form of campaigning that assists candidates
and causes with low budgets, but also one that "lends itself to
coalition campaigning" based on issues.</TE>
<TE>   The slate mail controversy in Orange County brings into focus a
county attempt to regulate (some might say stifle) coalition
campaigning and political speech. Coad complains that a slate mail
organization that received significant funds from the Measure W
campaign for advertising gave Norby strong exposure--what Coad
believes amounted to an "unreported campaign donation."</TE>
<TE>   Norby was a well-known opponent of an airport at El Toro and
supported Measure W. Coad was a key member of the pro-airport
majority among county supervisors. Norby became the first challenger
in 22 years to oust an incumbent supervisor. Coad believes Norby's
featuring in the slate mailers was unfair.</TE>
<TE>   The fact is that slate mail publishers have a right to list any
candidate or measure they wish in their mailings, and they don't have
to charge candidates whose names appear.</TE>
<TE>   State law provides that publishers must publicly disclose the
"free" candidates on forms filed with the state. It is extremely
common for slate mail publishers to give prominent space to a
presidential candidate at no charge. The Constitution protects a
local candidate's desire to be linked with a popular state or
national candidate on a slate mailer.</TE>
<TE>   The same is true on issues of common interest, say, support for
Measure W. A statewide candidate might, for example, want to be
associated with such a popular local issue or candidate.</TE>
<TE>   The only overriding interest that the U.S. Supreme Court has found
to justify a campaign restriction is political corruption. Like other
forms of election media, slate mail is subject to deception and
abuse. But the judge in the California Prolife case found slate mail
was not subject to any more abuse than other forms of political
campaigning, including TV, radio, telephone calls, newspaper
advertising and direct mail.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Coad's proposal singled out slate mail for a proposed "25% of
the surface area" litmus test. That means if 25% of the mailer deals
with a county campaign, it gets regulated. But the county has not
revealed or articulated any government interest in support of the
restriction that can pass constitutional muster. The county hasn't
told us how it can justify the "25% of the surface area" of a slate
mailer represents political corruption, whereas 24% is not.</TE>
<TE>   Coad may feel that Norby received an unfair advantage. But under
state law, a "pro-airport" slate mailer could have just as easily
featured Coad. Supervisors must understand that any lesson to be
drawn from Coad's defeat has more to do with issues, performance in
office and campaign strategy, than it does with enacting a new slate
mail law that is unconstitutional on at least two counts.</TE>

<LD>All those things the Dodgers love to talk about--cohesion, heart,
resiliency--won them a baseball game Saturday. Whether it can get
them a pennant remains to be seen.</LD>
<LD>   It's apparent that the little things are all the Dodgers bring to
the table, like Jack coming home with a pocketful of beans.</LD>
<LD>   They magically bounced back from Friday night's depressing
extra-inning loss to San Francisco and beat the Giants, 4-2,
Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   On the surface, it wasn't that impressive.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants didn't have Barry Bonds in the lineup, out because of a
hamstring he hurt the night before. The Dodgers needed their leadoff
hitter to drive in three runs on a day the heart of the lineup went
one for 11. They came close to wasting a fine effort by Omar Daal,
who was the losing pitcher when he left after the seventh inning
despite giving up only five hits and two runs.</TE>
<TE>   And yet they emerged victorious, thanks to a three-run rally in
the bottom of the eighth. Knowing what they'd been through the night
before, when they squandered a 2-1 lead and then wasted an
Olympics-frequency triple by Eric Karros in the 11th inning, it ranks
among their bigger victories. They took it as a referendum on their
season.</TE>
<TE>   "That just shows the character of this team," center fielder Dave
Roberts said.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers are in second place in the National League West, a
half a game ahead of the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   They're still here.</TE>
<TE>   You've seen just about all their flaws lately. Their bench is
thin. They don't have a pitcher who gives the team the sense they've
got this game won every time he steps on the mound.</TE>
<TE>   And when Shawn Green's bat is cold, the way it is now and the way
it was in the first month of the season, they have no real other
threats in the lineup. As Jeff Reboulet said, "Fundamentals are good,
but you've got to have those big hits."</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, those hits came courtesy of Roberts, who singled home
Mark Grudzielanek to tie the score, 1-1, in the fourth inning, then
drove in the go-ahead runs with a hit in the eighth. That gave him a
grand total of 24 runs batted in this season; then again, that's not
his job hitting in the leadoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not my forte by any stretch of the imagination, but that's
what it called for today," Roberts said. "I'll do whatever it takes
to get us over the top."</TE>
<TE>   His jersey stood as proof. It had dirt stains all over it, and the
script Dodgers lettering looked worn and frayed.</TE>
<TE>   But there was some incriminating evidence about the Dodger bats in
Roberts' box score line. When the leadoff hitter gets three hits and
steals three bases, he shouldn't have a 0 in the runs category. Paul
Lo Duca went one for five in the second spot, Green went 0 for 4 and
Eric Karros was 0 for 2 before he took a fastball to the chin in the
seventh inning.</TE>
<TE>   Lately, Green is getting something close to Bonds-like treatment
from opposing pitchers. I'm surprised they ever bothered to pitch to
him in the first half of the season, when he hit 26 home runs, but he
might not see another good pitch until spring training next year.</TE>
<TE>   So they got hits from Roberts at the top and six more from the
resurgent bottom of the lineup. They got two from Adrian Beltre, two
hits and an RBI from Alex Cora, who is their most valuable reserve,
and a couple more hits from Grudzielanek, who is 13 for 35 since the
All-Star break.</TE>
<TE>   Add it up and the Dodgers scored four runs Saturday after
producing a total of three in their previous three games.</TE>
<TE>   After dropping nine of 10, things had gotten so bad that Manager
Jim Tracy said Friday's game was "a tough loss....I'm not going to
skirt the issue on that one." And he said that had the team's recent
slide come in September, it would "begin to be somewhat of a
devastating situation."</TE>
<TE>   But he said the victory Saturday validated all the good things he
had talked about.</TE>
<TE>   "I've mentioned about the resolve of this team, the fact that they
won't roll over for you," Tracy said. "They don't know how to do
that."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps turning this thing around is really as simple as flipping
a switch.</TE>
<TE>   Silence reigned in the clubhouse before the game, before Odalis
Perez wondered, "Why are we not playing music? Because we are down?"</TE>
<TE>   So he walked over to the clubhouse stereo, turned it on and the
tunes started thumping. A little bit of life returned.</TE>
<TE>   Power 106 played quietly after the game as well. A five-game
losing streak was over.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as we keep with the energy and the good at-bats and we
can build on this, we'll be fine," Roberts said.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, the Dodgers regained some of their confidence. It
might be their best asset.</TE>

<LD>Dave Burba hit Olmedo Saenz with the bases loaded and two out in the
bottom of the ninth to score the winning run as the Oakland Athletics
beat the Texas Rangers, 6-5, Saturday night at Oakland.</LD>
<LD>   "The bottom line is win the game," Saenz said. "Get the job done.
Get the runner in from third base. It doesn't matter how I get it
done. I'll take it."</LD>
<LD>   It was the Rangers' eighth consecutive loss, the longest current
streak in the majors and their most since a nine-game streak from
June 6-16, 2000.</LD>
<TE>   Rafael Palmeiro homered off A's closer Billy Koch in the ninth
inning to tie the score. The shot to right was Palmeiro's 25th.</TE>
<TE>   With two out in the ninth, Burba (4-5) walked Eric Chavez and
Jermaine Dye. Both runners advanced on a wild pitch, and Burba
intentionally walked John Mabry to load the bases for Saenz.</TE>
<TE>   Saenz was hit in the upper left side on a 0-and-1 count.</TE>
<TE>   "When you lose the game and they didn't have to hit the ball, it's
embarrassing," Burba said. "If I was an ostrich, I'd have my head in
the sand right now."</TE>
<TE>   The A's have won nine of 11, improving to a season-high 18 games
over .500.</TE>
<TE>   In honor of the 1972 World Series champion Athletics, the A's wore
bright gold and green jerseys.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the players from the 1972 squad were on hand, including
Vida Blue, John "Blue Moon" Odom, World Series most valuable player
Gene Tenace and manager Dick Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Known for their infighting as well as their mustaches, the 1972
A's beat the Cincinnati Reds in seven games to win the first of three
consecutive World Series titles.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 12, Tampa Bay 10--Shannon Stewart hit a three-run homer in
a seven-run fifth inning as the Blue Jays sent the Devil Rays to
their 15th loss in 16 games.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay, with the worst record in the majors at 29-66, has lost
a team-record 13 in a row on the road and seven consecutive overall.
The Devil Rays have the major leagues' longest road skid since
Philadelphia dropped 14 in a row in 1997. Toronto has won four in a
row and eight of nine.</TE>
<TE>   The Devil Rays committed four errors for the second consecutive
game, tying a season high.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 14, Detroit 4--Bobby Kielty, playing center field in
place of suspended Torii Hunter, went four for four with a home run,
a triple and three runs batted in at Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   David Ortiz homered twice, rookie Michael Cuddyer had his first
major league home run and four RBIs, and Kielty scored four times as
the Twins won their fourth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota's Joe Mays came off the 60-day disabled list to make his
first start since April 14. An All-Star last season, Mays gave up
three runs and seven hits in six innings to send the Tigers to their
fifth consecutive loss.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 4, Chicago 3--Tony Batista led off the 14th inning at
Baltimore with a double and scored on a one-out single by Brook
Fordyce.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Matthews Jr. had four hits for Baltimore, which forced extra
innings with a run in the ninth and improved to 2-41 when trailing
after eight innings.</TE>
<TE>   It was the fifth time that Chicago lost when taking a lead into
the ninth. The White Sox are a major league-worst 5-17 in one-run
games.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 7-3, Cleveland 5-5--Ellis Burks' second homer of the
game, a three-run shot in the 10th inning, led the Indians in the
second game of a doubleheader, ending the Royals' nine-game winning
streak.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Berger and A.J. Hinch drove in two runs each and Runelvys
Hernandez earned his first career victory as Kansas City won the
opener.</TE>

<HD>Yankee Victory Doesn't Ease Concerns</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Rivera is forced to leave 9-8 win over Red Sox
because of tightness in pitching shoulder. Mondesi returns to
hospital.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Even after an exciting July win over their top rivals, the New York
Yankees were worrying about the player who might make the biggest
difference come October--Mariano Rivera.</LD>
<LD>   After watching Rivera walk off the mound with tightness in his
right shoulder after only six pitches, the Yankees rallied to beat
the Boston Red Sox, 9-8, in 11 innings Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Robin Ventura's one-out roller drove in the winning run. But by
the time Alfonso Soriano crossed home plate, the Yankees already were
focusing on their All-Star closer.</LD>
<TE>   "There's no question it's a matter of concern," Yankee Manager Joe
Torre said.</TE>
<TE>   "But this is not something new with Mo. He's had this before and
usually been able to work through it."</TE>
<TE>   Rivera was optimistic, for now.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be all right, I think," he said. "They'll decide tomorrow
what we're going to do. I don't know what. They haven't told me yet.</TE>
<TE>   "No pain, just tight. I have had this before."</TE>
<TE>   On what was looking like a lost afternoon for the Yankees as a
late lead disappeared after Rivera left in the eighth, they rebounded
to end Boston's four-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   A sellout crowd of 55,526 that took turns shouting for the AL East
rivals for more than four hours saw the Yankees load the bases in the
11th. Soriano led off with a double against Wayne Gomes (1-2), Derek
Jeter was intentionally walked, Enrique Wilson sacrificed and Bernie
Williams was intentionally walked.</TE>
<TE>   That brought up Ventura, one of the best bases-loaded hitters
ever--a .354 average with 15 grand slams in such situations--and he
hit a slow grounder in the hole to the right side that second baseman
Rey Sanchez fielded. But Sanchez had no chance to turn a double play
and instead threw home, and Soriano easily beat it.</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, Yankee outfielder Raul Mondesi returned to the
hospital because of a recurrence of chest pains. A CT scan was
negative, but he did not play in the game.</TE>

<HD>Washburn Puts Streak on Line</HD>

<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jarrod Washburn has won 11 consecutive decisions since starting the
season 0-2. The 27-year-old Angel left-hander has not lost since
April 13 and owns the longest single-season winning streak in
franchise history.</LD>
<LD>   Washburn (11-2) has already matched his victory total of last
season when he finished 11-10.</LD>
<LD>   "Every time out, I'm being consistent," said Washburn, who pitches
tonight. "It's the first time in my career I've really done that for
a long period of time.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm nowhere as good as I want to be or as good as I think I can
be, but I'm happy the way things are going.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't go out there worrying when it's going to end. It's
going to end someday. I'm going to lose. Hopefully, it's not soon."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Matt Wise knew the move was probably coming when the Angels
activated Al Levine from the disabled list, but Wise was still
disappointed when the club sent him to triple-A Salt Lake after
Friday night's game.</TE>
<TE>   Wise, 26, pitched a scoreless ninth against the Seattle Mariners
before receiving word that he was going back to Salt Lake for the
third time this season. Wise is out of options, meaning the Angels
must keep him in the major leagues next season or put him on waivers.</TE>
<TE>   "I know I'm going to have a long career in the big leagues and
every time I get sent down it's more motivation for me to prove that
I can pitch at this level," said Wise, who has a 3.24 earned-run
average in 8 1/3 innings over seven major league appearances this
season. "I still hope my future is with the Angels."</TE>

<HD>Angels Have Power in the Clutch, 7-6</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It had been exactly two years since Scott Spiezio hit a home run
right-handed.</LD>
<LD>   But the switch-hitting Angel first baseman was thinking only of
getting on base when he came to the plate against the Seattle
Mariners with the score tied in the eighth inning Saturday night at
Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   So Spiezio was surprised as anyone when he hit Arthur Rhodes'
first pitch of the inning over the wall in left-center field to
provide the Angels with the winning run in a pivotal 7-6 victory.</LD>
<TE>   "These guys have been on me pretty hard for the last two years--at
least now I've got one," Spiezio said. "I still didn't think it was
even going out when I rounded first and then I heard the crowd
cheer."</TE>
<TE>   The sellout crowd of 43,109 and the Angels had much to celebrate
after a victory that pulled them within two games of the first-place
Mariners in the American League West.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, who beat the Mariners, 15-3, on Friday night, are
assured of winning their first series at home against the Mariners
since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel that we can compete with this team and beat them,"
Spiezio said. "Now, we just have to go do it. We've done it a couple
games and we face them a lot more."</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio got his opportunity to decide the game after the Angels
took a one-run lead with a four-run seventh, highlighted by Troy
Glaus' three-run homer against Rhodes.</TE>
<TE>   Desi Relaford tied the score, 6-6, in the eighth with a home run
against Scot Shields (2-1), setting the stage for Spiezio.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels also got a solid effort from relievers Brendan
Donnelly, Shields, Scott Schoeneweis and Ben Weber after starter John
Lackey faltered.</TE>
<TE>   Donnelly had five strikeouts in 2 1/3 scoreless innings, Shields
struck out three in two innings, Schoeneweis got John Olerud on a
ground ball for the first out of the ninth, and Weber earned his
third save by retiring Edgar Martinez on a ground ball and Bret Boone
on a fly ball to the wall in center field.</TE>
<TE>   "We've played pretty good baseball and put ourselves in position
where we can have a say in what happens here in the end," said Glaus,
who hit his 16th homer--his first since June 28. "Hopefully, we can
just continue to play well."</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners were hoping to rebound from Friday's defeat in a way
that was similar to the last time they lost by 12 or more runs. That
was July 5 of last season when the Texas Rangers pounded them, 14-2.
The next day, the Mariners routed the Dodgers, 13-0.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle did not launch that kind of onslaught against the Angels,
but they did lead, 5-2, before the Angels rallied in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Mariner reliever Shigetoshi Hasegawa walked Adam Kennedy to start
the inning then hit David Eckstein with a pitch.</TE>
<TE>   Rhodes came on to face Darin Erstad and got him to hit a ground
ball to Relaford for a force at second base. But Tim Salmon followed
with a single to left that scored Kennedy, and after Garret Anderson
struck out, Glaus hammered a pitch over the center-field wall.</TE>
<TE>   The lead, however, did not last for long. After Shields struck out
Dan Wilson to start the eighth, Relaford hit a pitch into the
right-field seats for his third homer.</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio immediately answered by leading off the home half with his
fifth homer.</TE>
<TE>   "He picked a good time," Glaus said.</TE>
<TE>   It was a fast finish for the Angels after starting relatively
slowly against Mariner starter Ryan Franklin.</TE>
<TE>   The last time the Angels saw Franklin was April 23 when he made
his first major league start.</TE>
<TE>   Franklin retired 16 of the first 17 batters and gave up three hits
in 5 2/3 innings in a 1-0 Mariner victory that dropped the Angels to
6-14, their worst start in franchise history.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, the Angels began an eight-game winning streak. It
was the start of a tear during which they went 50-25 and climbed back
into contention for the AL West title.</TE>
<TE>   Franklin was not as sharp Saturday, but he was still effective. He
gave up two runs and six hits in five innings before giving way to
Hasegawa.</TE>
<TE>   Lackey was hopeful that he could follow Ramon Ortiz's impressive
performance Friday night with a solid effort. But unlike his previous
two outings, when he pitched well but got no decisions, Lackey had no
command from the outset and suffered through his shortest outing in
five starts.</TE>
<TE>   The rookie gave up five runs and seven hits and walked five in 3
2/3 innings. Lackey, who had issued only seven walks in his previous
26 innings, threw 90 pitches and 46 of them were balls.</TE>

<LD>Thanks to a well-placed hand by defensive specialist Mark Ricks and a
sack by Chad Dukes, the Avengers avoided losing on the game's final
play for the third consecutive game.</LD>
<LD>   Ricks kept Lamont Cooper from catching what would have been the
go-ahead touchdown pass with two seconds left and Dukes sacked Jeff
Loots on the game's final play in a 46-41 victory over the Buffalo
Destroyers on Saturday night before 14,427 at Staples Center in the
Arena Football League regular-season finale for both teams.</LD>
<LD>   It was the highest attendance for a regular-season home game in
the Avengers' three-year history.</LD>
<TE>   Ricks either deflected the pass or distracted Cooper enough to
prevent him from catching a ball he got his hands on in the end zone.
Replays were inconclusive.</TE>
<TE>   With the ball at the 25-yard line, Buffalo had one more chance to
pull out the victory, but Dukes sacked Loots for a five-yard loss.</TE>
<TE>   The Avengers (8-6) clinched the No. 5 seeding in the playoffs and
a first-round home game Saturday.</TE>

<HD>Is Selig Playing by Mob Rules?</HD>

<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No matter how many embarrassing situations Bud Selig has found
himself in, no matter how many blows to his and his industry's image,
it can be said with certainty that the baseball commissioner has now
attained an unprecedented low--sued by 14 former minority partners of
the Montreal Expos under a federal fraud and racketeering statute
more often used to prosecute the Mafia and others of that obviously
criminal ilk.</LD>
<LD>   Bob DuPuy, baseball's chief operating officer, has called the suit
frivolous and without merit.</LD>
<LD>   A court will determine guilt or innocence, if this goes that far,
but make no mistake:</LD>
<TE>   The suit threatens to further besmirch Selig and his office, delay
any resolution regarding the Expos' future, possibly impair the
already impaired labor negotiations, and could force Selig to turn
over thousands of potentially damaging internal documents related to
contraction and the Expos' ownership.</TE>
<TE>   Some business.</TE>
<TE>   Only a week after his All-Star embarrassment, Selig--along with
DuPuy and Jeffrey Loria, the Florida Marlin owner and former Expo
managing partner--is accused by the former Montreal partners of mail
and wire fraud under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act of 1970.</TE>
<TE>   The suit accuses Selig of a duplicitous relationship with Loria in
much the same way he was (and remains) suspected of having a
duplicitous relationship with Minnesota Twin owner Carl Pohlad that
started even before the ill-fated contraction scenario. Then again,
who's the official scorer when it comes to duplicity?</TE>
<TE>   Certainly not Selig's constituents, who seem satisfied with his
leadership, convinced his doomsday message is the right one, and
remain supportive of his attempt to overhaul the economic system,
even if a ninth work stoppage (and Selig spans them all) is first on
the agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, New York Yankee owner George Steinbrenner isn't happy about
the idea of sharing any more of his revenue with owners he is
convinced will only put it in their pockets rather than improving
their teams (if they even knew how to improve their teams). And he
may occasionally chat with friends about how great a commissioner
Rudy Giuliani would make if and when Selig steps down, but there have
been no signs of an organized movement to revoke the commissioner's
recent three-year extension.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if there are any undercurrents of dissent regarding Selig,
San Diego Padre owner John Moores, a staunch ally, said: "I can
almost guarantee there will be none. I'm pretty aggressive in
believing the next bargaining agreement has to fix the game, and I'd
be shocked if there was any even half-hearted effort to ask Bud to
resign. It's just unthinkable. He's so strong that if he wanted to
outlaw Sunday baseball, he'd probably have our support."</TE>
<TE>   So, here's Selig, in court again with baseball's umpires, possibly
headed to court with some of the top families in Canada, in a
revenue-sharing headlock with the players' union and, apparently,
still loved by the owners, although it remains uncertain how the
labor situation will play out, just as it is unclear how the suit by
the former Montreal partners will play out--or play into the labor
dispute.</TE>
<TE>   The suit charges that Selig, Loria and other high-ranking baseball
officials conspired to eliminate baseball in Montreal, reducing the
minority partners' holdings from 76% to about 7%, violating the RICO
Act. It seeks $100 million in punitive damages (which would be
tripled under RICO), unspecified compensatory damages and asks that
the club be placed in trust.</TE>
<TE>   The group has said it will seek an injunction if baseball tries to
move or fold the team, a major impediment to contraction or
relocation, and James Quinn, a partner in the law firm that has filed
the suit, said by phone that the group would also take "immediate
steps to correct" any attempt by baseball to devalue the Expos,
currently operated by the commissioner's office, by dismantling the
roster.</TE>
<TE>   Given the courts' generally slow pace, the Expo suit--unless
dismissed--could be a problem for two or three years.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Routtenberg, one of the 14 minority partners, told the
Montreal Gazette that it is strictly about justice and doubted that
it "has much relevance to the future of baseball in Montreal, other
than maybe acting as a stopgap. We still need a new stadium, a
revenue-sharing deal and a local owner with deep pockets to step up
to the plate."</TE>
<TE>   If it's uncertain what the minority partners would demand in a
settlement, it is suspected that baseball will go to any length to
avoid releasing its internal information.</TE>
<TE>   A similar document quest in the suit brought by the Metropolitan
Sports Facilities Commission to keep the Twins in Minneapolis
recently weighed into the decision by management lawyers to reach an
out-of-court settlement that guaranteed the Twins will remain in
Minnesota through 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The range of discovery in a federal case is generally even wider
than it would have been in the Minnesota state courts, according to
legal experts, meaning this new paper chase could also force baseball
into a reluctant settlement.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, among those watching closely will be the higher but
losing bidders in the Selig-orchestrated sale of the Boston Red Sox,
as well as state officials in Florida, who were thwarted in a recent
court attempt to obtain the contraction documents by the industry's
anti-trust exemption.</TE>
<TE>   "There are many people, in and out of baseball, who have been
looking for a way to get Selig into federal court," a lawyer familiar
with the situation said.</TE>
<TE>   "This may be their best opportunity to get those documents."</TE>
<TE>   Now pursuing Selig and baseball, the New York law firm of Weil,
Gotshal &amp; Manges has been successful in unlocking NFL and NBA
secrets.</TE>
<TE>   There is no hiding the fact that Loria invested about $12 million
in the Expos and, two years later, was bought out by baseball for
$120 million, enabling him to buy the Marlins from John Henry, who
became owner of the Red Sox even though his group's bid wasn't the
highest.</TE>
<TE>   It was another case of the dots leading back to the commissioner,
as they generally do in baseball, and which doesn't seem to bother
any of Bud Selig's electorate--no matter the results.</TE>

<LD>Let's see ... Richie Phillips is no longer a factor, the umpires'
union has been reorganized, several perceived militants and
incompetents have been weeded out, there is no longer a distinction
between American and National League umpires and still baseball can't
avoid legal problems with the men in ... well, sometimes it's still
blue and sometimes it's red, gray or white. Only the Angels change
their uniform colors more often.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers for the new World Umpires Assn. filed two grievances last
week and baseball went into federal court to challenge the union's
right to arbitration on one of the grievances--even though the union
insists that it isn't making a complaint about what baseball
apparently thinks it is.</LD>
<LD>   Putting the complexities aside, the bottom line is the umpires'
continuing concern that they are too often under the scrutiny of Big
Brother.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, amid baseball's desire for lower pitch counts and a
larger strike zone that would fit the rulebook definition, they were
angered by the e-mail from Sandy Alderson, executive vice president
for baseball operations, that ordered one umpire to "hunt for more
strikes."</TE>
<TE>   Now, they have filed grievances over a computerized system that
monitors their ball and strike calls. The QuesTec Umpire Information
System has been installed in four locations at about half a dozen
parks. The initial intent was to use QuesTec as a training tool, but
this season it has been used to inform umpires when the computer
purportedly shows their ball and strike calls to be wrong too much of
the time--as veteran umpire and union president John Hirschbeck was
accused of in a recent letter.</TE>
<TE>   The union has serious concerns over the system's accuracy, and in
a statement Friday said the apparatus has difficulty tracking certain
breaking pitches, there is inconsistency in where QuesTec technicians
draw the top and bottom of the strike zone and, as with last year's
pitch count directives, it "interjects an extraneous element into the
game and pressures umpires to compete with the machine rather than
giving their full attention to calling the game as they see it
unfold.... "</TE>
<TE>   The union has asked the commissioner's office for information on
the system and requested answers to 50 system-related questions posed
in writing to Alderson, but has received no response. Rob Manfred,
baseball's top labor lawyer, said the refusal to respond was based on
the bargaining agreement, which calls for a joint committee of
supervisors and umpires to meet after the season to analyze the
system and determine rating standards.</TE>
<TE>   Manfred said he did not want another distracting legal issue
during the season, but the union, in its statement, said that as long
as the system was being used to evaluate umpires, it did not want to
wait until the season ended for answers.</TE>
<TE>   Two-Party System</TE>
<TE>   It's not a new story, but it continues to be a statistically
compelling one that reflects what the National League West is up
against in trying to dethrone the Arizona Diamondbacks, and what the
Diamondbacks are up against in trying to repeat.</TE>
<TE>   As Randy Johnson faces the San Diego Padres today, he and Curt
Schilling are a combined 7-0 against the West this year and 34-4 over
the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   The Arizona aces are also a combined 29-6 overall, on pace to
match or surpass last year's 43-12 total, and their performance alone
would suggest a division runaway.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, it takes more than two guns in the West, and for the
second consecutive season the Diamondbacks are trying to overcome the
remainder of their rotation, along with the Dodgers and San Francisco
Giants.</TE>
<TE>   They used nine other starters who combined for a 33-39 record last
year and had used four--Rick Helling, Miguel Batista, Brian Anderson
and Todd Stottlemyre--who were a combined 16-24 this year before
Helling went on the disabled list with a sprained ankle and John
Patterson made his major league debut Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   Patterson, 24, was a first-round draft choice of Montreal in 1996,
slipped through the same loophole that Travis Lee did to sign with
Arizona for a bonus of $6.075 million and promptly illustrated the
risks inherent in giving amateur pitchers that kind of package by
requiring elbow and shoulder operations. He had a modest record of
6-4 with a 4.71 earned-run average in triple-A this year, but the
Diamondbacks, who have had their eye on Kenny Rogers of Texas, were
out of internal alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   Happy Days</TE>
<TE>   It has been a long year for former Angel Chuck Finley, starting
with that spring altercation with his wife and their ensuing divorce,
and continuing with a summer of poor support by the Cleveland
Indians, who averaged 2.9 runs in his last 15 starts as he went 4-11
with a 4.44 ERA overall. However, the veteran southpaw got a reprieve
when he was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals, hurting for a Darryl
Kile replacement. Finley, at 39, is likely to get another playoff
opportunity, and the Cardinals' only financial obligation is $1
million of the $2 million remaining on his $5-million salary this
year.</TE>
<TE>   The Indians are obligated for the other $1 million, along with the
remaining $8 million of his $11-million signing bonus.</TE>
<TE>   A major rebuilding project has not left General Manager Mark
Shapiro the most popular figure in Cleveland and he has had to look
for sales pitches where he can find them. He predicted that double-A
outfielder Luis Garcia, obtained for Finley, will be starting in
Cleveland within two years and "could hit ... 30 home runs."</TE>

<HD>Tiger Is History, but Not as He Wanted It</HD>

<DL>GULLANE, Scotland</DL>
<LD>Forget Tiger Woods. Any more days like Saturday at Muirfield and the
only guy who's going to win the British Open is Mark Spitz, but only
with fins, a mask and a snorkel.</LD>
<LD>   As he trudged over Muirfield on his way to a 10-over-par 81, his
worst round as a professional, Woods had a miserable time in
conditions that were pretty much the same.</LD>
<LD>   Think about it. Tiger Woods is in the hunt for a Grand Slam and he
shoots the worst round of his life instead.</LD>
<TE>   He made one birdie. It was at the 17th hole, when the rain had
finally stopped. After the ball disappeared into the hole, the few
fans left in the stands cheered and Woods doffed his cap and took a
bow. At least he didn't get shut out, he said later, in remarkably
good humor for someone whose quest for history had been left in the
mud.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, it was an awful day for anything except flu, thanks to the
rain and wind that struck everywhere. The television coverage by the
BBC was a mess. Unable to keep the lenses of the cameras from getting
drenched, the pictures of the golf looked as if they were shot
through a waterfall.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Woods wasn't the only one with bad luck. It wasn't any
better for anybody else who had an afternoon starting time, but Woods
was the only one with a chance to win the Grand Slam, an opportunity
that doesn't look too good right now.</TE>
<TE>   It is not clear who will win today, but the weather was the
certain winner Saturday. Ernie Els played in what appeared to be a
ski parka. Soren Hansen had more layers than an artichoke.</TE>
<TE>   The prevailing wind is from the west here. But Saturday, it was
blowing out of the northeast. No one knew what that meant, except
that it was bad.</TE>
<TE>   And for Woods, his bid for the Grand Slam went from bad to worse.
Tiger established a pattern right from the beginning.</TE>
<TE>   He drove it into the right rough and bogeyed the first hole. He
drove it into the right rough and bogeyed the fourth hole. He hit his
second shot into the right rough, missed the green and double bogeyed
the fifth hole. He drove it into the right rough, missed the green
and bogeyed the sixth hole. He drove it in the right rough and
bogeyed the eighth hole.</TE>
<TE>   Grand Slam? That's the sound Tiger made when he closed the door on
his own foot.</TE>
<TE>   Six over par after eight holes doesn't really qualify as getting
off to a fast start. His double bogey at the fifth was his first in a
major this year, followed eight holes later by his second, so maybe
Woods was due.</TE>
<TE>   All we know now is that Tiger's chance to win this thing is as
likely as a sellout of suntan lotion at the pharmacy.</TE>
<TE>   In the 110 years since it hosted the Open Championship for the
first time, Muirfield has managed to distinguish itself from the
other venues by the quality of its champions. There have been no
quirky winners, no one-time wonders or otherwise unknowns who have
triumphed at Muirfield.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, such names as Nicklaus, Watson, Trevino, Player, Hagen,
Ray and Vardon have won British Open titles on the East Lothian
course at Muirfield.</TE>
<TE>   What we don't know is if Woods, as the greatest player of his
generation, missed a chance to take his place in line or whether the
odds simply caught up to him.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, weather became a factor for the first time. Shigeki
Maruyama found refuge behind a scoreboard and hid from the wind,
blowing on his hands to keep them warm.</TE>
<TE>   Rain is one thing, but combine it with a blustery wind that could
bend a flagstick in half and temperatures that were dropping faster
than the stock market and then you can seriously dial up the quirky
quotient of something funny happening here.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, you can blame it on the weather, if you want to, but what do
you expect from a country where summer was last Tuesday?</TE>
<TE>   None of this is much consolation to Woods, who was close to
mailing it in a couple of times, but didn't. He tried everything,
including taking off his cap a couple of times.</TE>
<TE>   There was another factor at work as well, but off the course. The
central topic of a lively discussion was whether it would be good for
golf if Woods succeeded in his Grand Slam. The debate hinged on the
merits of a powerful history lesson if Woods won all four majors
contrasted with the idea that Woods would lose interest because of
too much success too soon in his career.</TE>
<TE>   It appears that we've got a moot point right now. In 1972, when
Jack Nicklaus played at Muirfield after winning the Masters and the
U.S. Open, he began the last round six shots behind Lee Trevino and
lost by one.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger isn't close to being that close. There will be no Grand
Slam, not this year. History is going to repeat itself, 30 years
later, on the very same course, passed down from Nicklaus to Woods.
It was one of those days, Woods admitted, one that he would prefer
not to experience again any time soon.</TE>

<TE>   ROUGH DAY FOR TIGER</TE>
<TE>   A hole-by-hole account of Tiger Woods' disastrous third round
Saturday at the British Open, a 10-over-par 81 that was the worst of
his professional career (standing against par for the tournament in
parentheses):</TE>
<TE>   No. 1, par 4--Iron off tee into right rough. Hits second onto
slope of bunker 20 yards short of green. Chips 10 feet past the flag,
misses par putt and taps in for bogey (-3).</TE>
<TE>   No. 2, par 4--Five-iron pulled into thick rough. Punches out onto
fairway 20 yards short of green. Superb chip to one foot and sinks
putt for a par save (-3).</TE>
<TE>   No. 3, par 4--Wood off the tee into the first cut of rough right
of fairway. Finds green with his second but 60 feet short of pin.
Excellent first putt leaves tap-in for par (-3).</TE>
<TE>   No. 4, par 3--Long iron into breeze misses target and finds light
rough right and short of green. Chips to seven feet but misses par
putt for his second bogey in first four holes (-2).</TE>
<TE>   No. 5, par 5--Finds fairway off the tee, but hits second in
driving wind into right rough. Punches out with third but still 120
yards short of green. Hits fourth over back of green, lob wedge to 10
feet, misses putt for double-bogey seven (even par).</TE>
<TE>   No. 6, par 4--Three-wood off tee but again finds thick rough right
of fairway. Hacks out sideways back onto fairway but then overshoots
green. Putts from back apron to one foot and holes bogey putt (+1).</TE>
<TE>   No. 7, par 3--Finds left side of green with tee shot, but still 40
feet from pin. Putts to within three feet and makes it for par (+1).</TE>
<TE>   No. 8, par 4--Three-wood off tee but again misses fairway. Second
shot short of green and chips to 12 feet. Misses putt and taps in for
another bogey (+2).</TE>
<TE>   No. 9, par 5--Finds right side of fairway off the tee and hits
second short of green. His eagle try is long and he settles for a
par. (+2).</TE>
<TE>   No. 10, par 4--Again finds rough right of fairway and forced to
hack back out. Superb third shot to six feet of the flag but misses
putt for par and posts another bogey (+3).</TE>
<TE>   No. 11, par 4--Hits the fairway and finds green with his second
shot. Though a long way from flag, he manages to two-putt for his par
(+3).</TE>
<TE>   No. 12, par 4--Hits the fairway off the tee but then fires wedge
from 152 yards over back of green into rough. Chops out into light
rough and chips close for a tap-in bogey (+4).</TE>
<TE>   No. 13, par 3--Four-iron into bunker on right of green. Has
difficult lie and fails to get out with his first effort. Hits flag
with his second but then misses bogey putt from five feet and has to
settle for another double bogey (+6).</TE>
<TE>   No. 14, par 4--Iron off the tee and second from thick grass to
just short of green. Chips to one foot but misses par putt for
another bogey (+7).</TE>
<TE>   No. 15, par 4--On in two for birdie chance from 14 feet. Two putts
for a par. (+7).</TE>
<TE>   No. 16, par 3--Finds the green with tee shot. Long first putt to
one foot and holes out for another par (+7).</TE>
<TE>   No. 17, par 5--On in three to four feet and raises his arms in
relief as he drains the putt for his first birdie of the day (+6).</TE>
<TE>   No. 18, par 4--Iron off the tee comfortably into the middle of the
fairway. Superb second shot to five feet, but lips out with birdie
putt (+6).</TE>

<LD>In the book "The Hit Men and the Kid Who Batted Ninth," author David
Siroty follows the lives of former Seton Hall baseball teammates Mo
Vaughn, Craig Biggio, John Valentin and Marteese Robinson.</LD>
<LD>   Siroty says that Vaughn might have been destined to play for the
Disney-owned Angels based on his choice of bedding while attending
high school in Pawling, N.Y., 50 miles from his hometown of Norwalk,
Conn.</LD>
<LD>   "Maurice brought his Mickey Mouse sheets and lamp from home and
the other students made fun of him," Vaughn's mother, Shirley, told
Siroty. "But Maurice told them, 'The man makes the sheets, the sheets
don't make the man.'</LD>
<TE>   "The next year, all the kids had Mickey Mouse sheets."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who was the last amateur to win the British Open?</TE>
<TE>   Welcome wagon: Former Gonzaga star Dan Dickau recently got a taste
of the reception he's likely to face as a high-profile rookie in the
NBA.</TE>
<TE>   Playing in a summer league game, the Atlanta Hawk guard set a
screen against the New Jersey Nets' Richard Jefferson, who retaliated
by putting Dickau in a headlock and throwing him to the floor. Both
players were ejected.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not John Stockton," said Jefferson, who accused Dickau of
throwing an elbow. "So if somebody tried to do that to me--he's a
rookie with less experience than me--something's going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Responded Marc Berman of the New York Post: "If only Jefferson
showed this fire against the Lakers."</TE>
<TE>   Ten is enough: From Tom Fitzgerald of the San Francisco Chronicle:
"Former heavyweight champ George Foreman volunteered for a blood test
to prove that he's not the father of Jasmine Christina Foreman, 22.</TE>
<TE>   "For those keeping score at home, here's a list of the kids he
does take credit for: Michi, George Jr., Freeda George, Georgetta,
Natalie, George III, Leola, George IV, George V and George VI. Tip to
Jasmine: Try changing your name to Georgia."</TE>
<TE>   Pulling the plug: A campaign by Mississippi to promote junior
quarterback Eli Manning for the Heisman Trophy has been scuttled by
the player's father.</TE>
<TE>   Archie Manning, a former NFL quarterback who starred at Ole Miss,
said his decision was based on what he observed when his other son,
Peyton Manning, was second in the Heisman voting in 1997 while at
Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   "I hated what they did to Peyton," Archie Manning said. "It wasn't
a pleasant experience for our whole family."</TE>
<TE>   Playing the field: Detroit Tiger announcer Ernie Harwell, 84, as a
camera crew followed him around Comerica Park: "These folks are from
HBO. We're doing a little segment on 'Sex and the City.' "</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Bobby Jones, in 1930.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Recruiting violations contributed to Jim Harrick
losing his job as UCLA's basketball coach. Now academic casualties
could cost him his entire recruiting class at Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   Unless Wayne Arnold can earn a high school diploma before Georgia
classes begin Aug. 19, Harrick will have lost all four incoming
freshmen. Arnold was dropped last week from a summer school class
that he needed to graduate.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unbelievable," Harrick told the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.</TE>

<DH>Woods posts his worst professional score in the cold, wind
and rain at Muirfield, as Grand Slam bid derails in third round</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GULLANE, Scotland</DL>
<LD>They tried playing Saturday at Muirfield, but as they trudged up
sodden fairways, holding on for dear life, the world's best golfers
looked more like deckhands on a fishing trawler stranded in the
middle of the Perfect Storm.</LD>
<LD>   After a mild morning, bitter cold, piercing winds and sideways
rain attacked the east coast of Scotland, washing away Tiger Woods'
bid for a Grand Slam while blowing hopes of many other contenders
into the Firth of Forth.</LD>
<LD>   Woods, the best golfer in the world and a player who builds his
career around major championships, teed off in the heart of the storm
and shot a 10-over-par 81, by two shots his worst as a professional.</LD>
<TE>   Woods is at six-over-par 219, 11 shots behind leader Ernie Els,
who managed to withstand the afternoon weather and played part of his
back nine after the storm had abated. Els stands at five-under 208,
one of only 13 golfers under par after three days.</TE>
<TE>   His round of 72 was one of the best of any of the 30 golfers who
started after 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Nine of those 30 failed to break 80; none broke par.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really tough out there," Woods said. "I don't know if
there was any sleet in that rain, but it sure hurt."</TE>
<TE>   Is his bid for the Grand Slam over?</TE>
<TE>   "There are too many guys between me and the lead," said Woods, who
is tied for 67th place.</TE>
<TE>   Woods didn't get a birdie until the 17th hole and managed
consecutive pars only twice.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just blowing so hard out there that it was difficult to
stand, and the ball is oscillating, the rain is blowing.... I just
hit poor shots, and when you add that with the conditions, you are
not going to end up with a good result," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Els, a two-time U.S. Open champion, holds a two-stroke lead over
Soren Hansen of Denmark, who shot a 73 despite playing about the same
time as Els.</TE>
<TE>   "Those were some of the toughest conditions I've ever seen in an
Open Championship," Els said.</TE>
<TE>   "I was standing there on the fourth tee and we had a half-hour
wait there, and you couldn't believe how the conditions were. At that
moment, I really thought we were in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, at best, to break 76 or 77 today would have been a
hell of a score."</TE>
<TE>   Seven golfers are tied for third at two-under 211: Second-round
co-leader Shigeki Maruyama of Japan shot 75; Des Smyth, the
49-year-old Irishman, shot a 74; Thomas Bjorn of Denmark had a 73;
Scott McCarron a 72; Sergio Garcia of Spain had a 71, the only
even-par round of the late starters; and Justin Rose and Justin
Leonard, who played together before the weather turned, shot 68s.</TE>
<TE>   The Brits have a term for the kind of mild weather that marked the
first two days of the 131st British Open: benign. It turned malignant
about 2 p.m. Saturday, and it turned with a vengeance.</TE>
<TE>   How bad was it?</TE>
<TE>   Colin Montgomerie, who had played his way back into the tournament
in the second round with a 64, shot an 84 Saturday. The 20-stroke
swing matches the British Open record set in 1938 by R.G. French, who
went from a second-round 71 to a 91.</TE>
<TE>   Second-round co-leader Duffy Waldorf had an equally improbable
swing in his round. Waldorf played the first 10 holes in 10 over par,
then birdied five of the next six and finished with a 77. He's at
even-par 213.</TE>
<TE>   There were only four rounds in the 60s Saturday, only nine under
par.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia turned in one of the day's most impressive scores, coming
in with the 71.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I shot at least five or six under par," said Garcia,
who added that he would check out the final groups playing behind him
on television. "First of all, I'm going to take a hot bath, and then
I'm going to just lay down and watch a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   McCarron went out on the course prepared.</TE>
<TE>   "I had like four different jackets in the bag, and my caddie
thought we were going to have to take a trolley just to carry my
extra clothing," he said. "I think I went through all of it by about
the fourth hole."</TE>
<TE>   Smyth, who has played the PGA European Tour since 1974 and is only
a year away from the senior tour, was in the lead late Saturday until
going bogey-bogey on 17 and 18.</TE>
<TE>   "The weather was as bad as I can ever remember," he said. "It's
unbelievable it should happen in July; it was more like a
December/January day."</TE>
<TE>   It was still July when Rose and Leonard teed off in the morning.
They finished just in time with the lowest score of any pairing.</TE>
<TE>   Tied for 50th after two rounds, Leonard and Rose were the 12th of
42 twosomes to tee off and could only hope the weather turned after
they finished. They had no idea at the time how well their scores
would stand up.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we've seen the teeth of the course yet this week,"
said Leonard, who won the 1997 Open at Troon, "but hopefully, the
fellows will this afternoon now that I'm in."</TE>
<TE>   Rose and Leonard, practically out of the tournament after two
rounds, will play in the next-to-last group today.</TE>
<TE>   Four players are at one under: Steve Elkington, who shot a
morning-round 68; Thomas Levet, who shot a 74 in the elements;
third-round co-leader Padraig Harrington, who battled to a 76, and
Peter Lonard, who also played early.</TE>
<TE>   Lonard is an Australian with two top-five finishes on the PGA Tour
this year, including a fifth in the Western Open. He shot a 68
despite hitting a ball out of bounds on No. 9.</TE>
<TE>   Lonard had barely made the cut at two over, which changed his
approach Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "You really have to be careful out there," he said. "But when you
start eight shots behind going into the third round, you're not
playing safe, are you? So I took my chances early."</TE>
<TE>   Lonard birdied Nos. 2, 3 and 4 and eagled No. 5.</TE>
<TE>   And soon thereafter, the British Open took on its full character.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure the Scottish people were really enjoying it today,
watching us play," Els said. "They must have really been laughing
because they probably play in this 80% of the time.... Today the golf
course showed its real teeth."</TE>

<HD>Duval's Defense Is Not Quite Over Yet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE JAMES and THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>GULLANE, Scotland</DL>
<LD>On the third round of last year's British Open, David Duval laced up
his spikes and started sprinting. Saturday, he spend 3 1/2 hours
running in place. Which, by the end of the day, meant he gained a ton
of ground on the field.</LD>
<LD>   Duval trailed Colin Montgomerie by seven shots midway through the
2001 Open at Royal Lytham, fired a six-under-par 65 on Saturday,
followed that with a 67 on Sunday and left Britain with the Claret
Jug, his first major championship trophy.</LD>
<LD>   Saturday at Muirfield, Duval began play at one over, again seven
strokes off the lead, and after bogeying the first hole, appeared to
start making a move, with birdies at the second, third and ninth
holes.</LD>
<TE>   But as has been the case all year for Duval, he began losing
traction, dropped a couple strokes on the back side and wound up
shooting a one-under 70 to stand at even par for the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Duval was downcast.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it sounds like a broken record, but I just didn't finish
off what could have been a really decent round," said Duval, who has
missed the cut in six of his last 11 tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm playing well. I just left a couple of shots out there I
shouldn't have. I felt like if I could get to three, four or five
under, anything could happen on Sunday. But getting close doesn't do
it; it's been like that all year."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, anything did happen Saturday afternoon, when Muirfield
was hit with the kind of weather that would give Seattle a bad name.</TE>
<TE>   Duval's round started to look a lot better. By the time the
waterlogged field slogged in, with the leaders having backtracked
like politicians caught in a lie, Duval stood in 14th place, only
five shots behind leader Ernie Els.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Watson, in 1982-83, was the last player to repeat as Open
champion.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't exactly a day to remember for Phil Mickelson, not after
his second consecutive 76 that coldly followed his opening round of
68 and left him 12 shots out of the lead, but Mickelson did manage a
smile at the 17th hole.</TE>
<TE>   As he trudged off the green after rolling in a short birdie putt,
Mickelson saw a toddler in a pink jacket clapping for him and he
grinned broadly and patted her on the shoulder. Mickelson and his
wife, Amy, have a 3-year-old daughter and a 9-month-old daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Mickelson was philosophical.</TE>
<TE>   "I just haven't played well and I've had a difficult week," he
said. "But the golf course was beautifully set up and it's probably
my favorite of the Open courses, but I just haven't played well."</TE>
<TE>   Second at last year's PGA Championship and then third at the
Masters and second at the U.S. Open this year, Mickelson wouldn't say
his experience at Muirfield was a letdown.</TE>
<TE>   "What I'd say is it's much more frustrating playing like this than
being second, third and second and losing that way because at least I
had a chance ... and that was much easier to deal with than playing
like this."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Players have been so enamored of Muirfield's layout and the
fairness of the challenge, you half expect them to turn out in kilts
for the final round today.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a wonderful golf course," said Justin Leonard, whose 68
Saturday would help anyone's sunny disposition. "I came here two
years ago and played and really enjoyed it, and I'm enjoying it even
more this year."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Montgomerie must love roller coasters. The Scot, still looking for
his first major title, has had rounds of 74-64-84 at Muirfield.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Another player who faded quickly after a quick start was Sandy
Lyle, whose opening round of 68 seems a long time ago. Lyle, who had
a 76 Friday, had a 73 Saturday and is at four-over 217.</TE>
<TE>   Lyle, 44, the 1985 British Open champion and 1988 Masters
champion, said his second round was his most pronounced Muirfield
misery.</TE>
<TE>   "Very disheartening," he said. "I just had to stop the bleeding."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The weather forecasters, who have correctly predicted the
conditions two days in a row, are trying to make it three straight
with a decidedly upbeat version for today: mainly dry and partly
sunny. Rain is in the forecast for the evening.</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Know the Drill, Face the Chin Music</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Errant fastball hits Karros' jaw and inspires his
teammates, who rally for emotional 4-2 win over Giants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All week long, the Dodgers felt they'd been taking it on the chin,
but they didn't understand the true meaning of that term until the
seventh inning Saturday, when they really took one on the chin, a
97-mph Felix Rodriguez fastball that hit Eric Karros in the jaw and
sent the Dodger first baseman to the hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe it was the sight of Karros sprawled face-down in the dirt or
of blood seeping into the towel covering his face as he was escorted
off the field, but the incident seemed to spark an anemic offense
that went 49 consecutive innings without scoring multiple runs last
week.</LD>
<LD>   That streak came to an end in the eighth, when the Dodgers used
some good fortune and some good execution to score three runs for an
emotional 4-2 come-from-behind victory over the San Francisco Giants
before 50,093 in Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   Alex Cora tied the score with an RBI single off Rodriguez, and
leadoff batter Dave Roberts, who had an RBI single in the fourth and
stole three bases, hit the game-winner, lofting a two-run single to
right off Tim Worrell to end the Dodgers' five-game losing streak and
push them back into second place in the National League West.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though the pitch wasn't on purpose, I think it lit a fire
under us," Roberts said of Rodriguez's errant pitch. "We wanted to
pick [Karros] up."</TE>
<TE>   Karros was transported to Good Samaritan Hospital, where X-rays of
his jaw were negative. But he suffered a cut to his chin that
required minor plastic surgery. He also suffered numerous scrapes on
the inside of his mouth and lip and is expected to be out at least a
game or two.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody tried to hit anybody, especially in a situation like
that," Giant Manager Dusty Baker said. "Any time you throw a
projectile 90-100 mph, every once in a while, some are going to get
away."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez, a former Dodger who played with Karros in Los Angeles
in 1995, planned to call him to apologize. "We played together, and
he's a great guy," Rodriguez said. "I would never try to hit a guy
like that."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers trailed, 2-1, when Karros left, and the Giants nearly
blew the game open in top of the eighth when, with runners on second
and third and one out, Rich Aurilia sent a wicked liner back to the
box.</TE>
<TE>   But Dodger reliever Paul Quantrill somehow got a glove on it,
deflecting the ball to shortstop Cora, who threw to first for the
out, the runners holding.</TE>
<TE>   Quantrill walked J.T. Snow intentionally to load the bases, and
Tsuyoshi Shinjo sent a liner toward the middle, but second baseman
Mark Grudzielanek made a diving catch to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   Adrian Beltre opened the bottom of the eighth with a single to
right, and though Rodriguez shattered Grudzielanek's bat into three
or four pieces, Grudzielanek got enough of the pitch to ground a
single into right field, moving Beltre to third.</TE>
<TE>   Cora's single to left-center on a 1-2 pitch tied the score, 2-2,
and pinch-hitter Jeff Reboulet's sacrifice bunt moved the runners to
second and third. Roberts, who had three singles and a walk but
didn't score, followed with his game-winning hit to right.</TE>
<TE>   Closer Eric Gagne retired the side in order in the ninth for his
34th save, the Dodgers shook hands on the field for the first time
since Sunday night, and then their thoughts turned to Karros, their
fallen teammate.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tragic when you see that because it could be a career-ending
injury," Grudzielanek said. "We know it wasn't intentional, but maybe
that woke us up a bit.... We've been pushed around all week and
decided to put an end to it."</TE>
<TE>   A sense of relief outweighed any feelings of bravado, though.
After a devastating 3-2, 12-inning loss to the Giants Friday night,
when the Dodgers failed to score after Karros' leadoff triple in the
11th, Karros said it was the kind of defeat "that can send a team
spiraling."</TE>
<TE>   But the Dodgers bounced back Saturday behind the pitching of Omar
Daal, who gave up two runs and five hits in seven innings, and
Roberts' hitting.</TE>
<TE>   "We can kind of exhale," Roberts said. "Hopefully we can build on
this."</TE>

<HD>Green Is Getting Few Good Pitches, or Hits</HD>

<LD>Shawn Green hit 24 home runs in 45 games from May 21 to July 11, an
86-homer pace that would have shattered Barry Bonds' record-setting,
73-homer season of 2001. Yet during that same period, the Dodger
right fielder drew only 25 walks, a 90-walk pace that wouldn't have
approached Bonds' 177 walks last season.</LD>
<LD>   For some reason, opponents kept pitching to Green during his tear,
but it appears they're wising up, as evidenced by Green's three walks
against the Giants on Friday night and the scarcity of good pitches
he has gotten to hit since the All-Star break.</LD>
<LD>   "You can see teams pitching around Green, just like they do with
Bonds, but when you start doing phenomenal stuff, that happens," said
Dodger batting instructor Jack Clark. "You have to be patient. If
they give you enough to only get a base hit, you take it."</LD>
<TE>   Green has taken nothing since Monday night--he went 0 for 4 in
Saturday's 4-2 win over the Giants and is hitless in his last 21
at-bats. It hasn't helped that those batting behind him are a
combined three for 31 since the All-Star break.</TE>
<TE>   This was one of the Dodgers' biggest concerns when they traded
Gary Sheffield to Atlanta in January--that Green wouldn't have enough
lineup protection. Eric Karros and Brian Jordan provided adequate
protection in the first half, but they need to produce for Green to
get good pitches the rest of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "There may be situations where other teams say Shawn Green is not
going to beat us--that's what happens this time of year," Manager Jim
Tracy said. "So the other guys have to step up."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Add Giant Manager Dusty Baker to the list of critics of the
rubbery surface ringing Dodger Stadium's playing field. Bonds sat out
Saturday's game because of a strained right hamstring, suffered while
chasing Karros' 11th-inning triple on the warning track Friday night,
and the slugger is doubtful for tonight's series finale.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, the Dodger left fielder, injured his knee and lower back
while planting his foot to make a throw on the warning track May 13
and sat out the next six games.</TE>
<TE>   "That surface is really dangerous," Baker said. "You wonder why
they have it. Is it maintenance? Is it cosmetics? It doesn't rain
here a lot. The wind doesn't blow enough."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dodger pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii tweaked his left groin during his
six-inning performance against the Giants on Friday night, but the
left-hander said the injury was not serious and will not prevent him
from making his next start.</TE>

but he is expected to return tonight.</TE>

<HD>Tiger Knows When to Hide Behind the Woods</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BOSWELL</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>GULLANE, Scotland</DL>
<LD>Many athletes, even the greatest, never know when to clam up. The
same ego that drives them to the peak won't allow them to let their
foes have an uninterrupted moment in the spotlight.</LD>
<LD>   If you want to know why Tiger Woods is universally liked, as well
as respected, among his peers, Friday at the British Open was a
perfect example. Tiger shot 68. He's on the leader board--in an
eight-way tie for ninth place. Because he's only two shots behind the
five co-leaders, his chances to win the third leg of the Grand Slam
still intact, he could have hogged the day.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Woods had the locker room courtesy and the innate class
to step aside and force attention on the men who deserved it.
Co-leader Ernie Els, as well as popular veteran Nick Price and
Scotland's Colin Montgomerie (64), were more logical second-round
stories.</LD>
<TE>   So Woods refused a mass interview with every reporter on nine
continents. If you wanted him, then chase him behind the 18th green.
A couple of dozen did, but not hundreds. Then he almost whispered his
answers. And kept them short and boring, too.</TE>
<TE>   Fans don't notice such things. But nothing, absolutely nothing, is
spotted faster by athletes. Reggie Jackson was the quintessential
media hog and widely disliked for it.</TE>
<TE>   In golf, Greg Norman has been a scene-stealer his whole career and
is resented for it. Maybe it's part of Great White Shark marketing.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson, in their primes, knew when to make
themselves scarce. Golfers tend to have good manners. But it's been a
long time since any player effaced himself as gracefully as Woods did
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "I played beautifully the last two days. Hit the ball really well.
And hit good putts. They just haven't fallen. I have stayed patient
and continued to plug along," said Woods. "Any time you are near the
lead in a major championship you have to be happy," cliched Tiger.</TE>
<TE>   Asked his thoughts on the Grand Slam, he just shook his head.
Tiger might as well have held up a sign: "Go interview all those
co-leaders."</TE>
<TE>   Nice try, Tiger.</TE>
<TE>   But Shigeki Maruyama, Padraig Harrington and Duffy Waldorf have
never won a major title. Bob Tway did once, but that was long ago. As
for Els, he's a gentleman, a classic swinger, The Big Easy. But he
hasn't won a major since his second U.S. Open at Congressional in
'97.</TE>
<TE>   Which, not coincidentally, is just about the time Woods showed up.
So far, Els hasn't gone head-to-head well against Tiger. With
emphasis on the "head."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about his course-record 29 on the front nine, Els said, "If
you kept that going, you could shoot a 54. That's a scary thought."
It's pretty scary if Ernie thinks two times 29 is 54. Okay, give him
the benefit of the doubt. With a mulligan, he'd nail it.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Els knows that in showdowns with Tiger, mental mistakes
kill him. Els berated himself Friday about a bogey on the 13th hole
after it took two blasts to escape a trap. "That is the only place
you don't want to be on that hole. That was a mental error."</TE>
<TE>   Els even has his own personal confidence psychologist. Think Woods
needs one? Shrinks go to Tiger for self-assurance therapy. ''He
grinds positive stuff into my head,'' Els said of his mental coach.
''He'll have to do a pretty decent job the next couple of days.''</TE>
<TE>   So, who's going to make the weekend tough for Tiger? Any takers?
Or does the great man just slap it around in 70-70--hitting irons to
fairways, playing to the middle of greens, avoiding mistakes--and
then on Sunday night take home a Claret Jug?</TE>
<TE>   Maruyama accidentally gave his real opinion Thursday: "Tiger lives
in a different world from us."</TE>
<TE>   At least the ebullient Shigeki has provided us his imitations of
the sounds Woods makes after he misses yet another putt by an inch.
On Thursday, that utterance was a huge "sigh." By the second round,
according to Maruyama, Woods grunted like a man being stabbed in the
stomach.</TE>
<TE>   Is Woods in danger of getting flummoxed by the double annoyance of
hitting his driver on only three holes and constantly misreading
greens by a hair?</TE>
<TE>   "It's frustrating when you hit good putts and they're just not
going in," said Woods. "I tried to tell myself again and again and
again, all day, to just stay committed.... Pick the line and go ahead
and hit it. The stroke is good. They're just not dropping."</TE>
<TE>   Part of that is bad luck. But part is an imperfect sense of the
break on Muirfield's greens. And wind, maybe big wind, which always
makes putting even harder, is scheduled for Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   In the hunt for long shots with the grit to face down Woods, many
vets pick the same name--an old-timer tied with Tiger.</TE>
<TE>   "Watch Nick Price," said Els. "This course really suits him."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever happens, Price has had a forum here for his theories on
how major championships should be set up.</TE>
<TE>   Surprise, surprise, Price really likes courses like Muirfield that
maximize the chances of a medium-distance shot-maker such as himself,
while bringing the big bombers, like Woods, back to the field just a
notch.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad every par 4 on this course doesn't have to be 490 yards
long. You can set up a course with bunkering and rough that is better
than that," said Price, who can match his super-accurate driver
against Woods' careful two-irons. "Certainly at the U.S. Open and the
Masters I don't have a prayer unless I get a bazooka for a driver."</TE>
<TE>   So, Nick, is golf being spoiled?</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely. Very sad," he said. "This game has always been the
ultimate David versus Goliath where you had someone like Gary Player
against Jack Nicklaus. Or Ben Hogan, who wasn't very long, against
Sam Snead.</TE>
<TE>   "Now the game is becoming more of a smash from the tee," said
Price. "If you gave West Indies cricket star Brian Lara a cricket bat
that was twice the size of a regular cricket bat, half the weight,
what would happen? One day they'd score 600 runs and not get anyone
out."</TE>
<TE>   Over here, they talk cricket and expect you to understand. They
grow the rough to your waist, then put a century's worth of invisible
bumps in every green.</TE>

<HD>No Butting Rivalry This Time as Forrest Wins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Vernon Forrest beat Shane Mosley at Conseco Fieldhouse on Saturday
night by unanimous decision, no ifs, ands or butts about it.</LD>
<LD>   There were no head butts, controversial or otherwise, as in their
first meeting January at The Theater in Madison Square Garden. The
only controversy this time was over the margin of victory on two of
the three judges' scorecards.</LD>
<LD>   A case could certainly be made that Forrest was the victor in an
extremely close fight, to retain the World Boxing Council
welterweight championship he won from Mosley in January. But while
the majority of ringside writers had one fighter or the other winning
by a point or two, or scored the fight a draw, judge Tony Castellano
had Forrest winning, 117-111. Judge Gary Merritt scored it 116-112,
Jerry Roth 115-113.</LD>
<TE>   The Times scored it 115-114 for Mosley.</TE>
<TE>   Castellano was a late addition to the judging triumvirate, when
first WBC officials and then Forrest's camp asked for the removal of
judge Fred Jones.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to cry that we lost, but the scoring was out of
range," said Jack Mosley, Shane's father/trainer. "It was crazy. At
least score it a draw . Vernon would still retain the title, but at
least give Shane that. He was the aggressor. He had the most
effective punches. Shane was controlling the fight, the whole fight."</TE>
<TE>   Forrest, of course, saw it differently, but after a week of angry
verbal jabs tossed back and forth between the two camps, Forrest was
more than willing to give Mosley some credit.</TE>
<TE>   "When you fight a guy who is equal to you, it's tough," Forrest
said. "He was frustrating me and I was frustrating him. I thought it
was a close fight and I had him by a couple of points."</TE>
<TE>   Both fighters were frustrating to the crowd of 15,775, largest to
watch a fight in Indiana. Eager to see the ferocity and fury
demonstrated by both fighters in the past, hoping to see a replay of
the action in the January meeting when Forrest put Mosley down twice
and Mosley hung on valiantly, but ultimately hopelessly, for 12
rounds, Saturday's crowd instead saw an ugly and, at times, boring
bout.</TE>
<TE>   Mosley, who had charged Forrest with excessive holding in the
first fight, held and held and held all night. And Forrest did the
same. Charge after charge by both fighters ended in a headlock.</TE>
<TE>   Referee Laurence Cole was the busiest man in the ring, imploring
the fighters to break all night long.</TE>
<TE>   As a dance contest, this might have been intriguing, but as a
boxing match, it was bad enough to send the natives of this state
scurrying back to basketball.</TE>
<TE>   The best fight of the night occurred in the stands and drew the
attention of the majority of the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   And why not? There was nothing much going on in the ring.</TE>
<TE>   The punch statistics told the story. Mosley, known as one of the
busiest fighters in the business, threw a total of 259 punches, an
average of 21.6 a round, far short of his usual production.</TE>
<TE>   Forrest threw 446 punches, but connected on only 27%, to 44% for
Mosley.</TE>
<TE>   When asked immediately after the fight how many punches had been
thrown, a member of the stat crew replied, "Not enough."</TE>
<TE>   At the opening bell, it appeared there might be more than enough
punches flying. Mosley, appearing about to burst with anticipation
over facing the man who handed him his first professional defeat in
January and had also beaten him in an amateur fight a decade earlier,
raced across the ring and landed a left hand.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew he couldn't maintain that pace for 12 rounds," Forrest
said. "It took me a little time to adjust."</TE>
<TE>   Mosley, who had been hammered by Forrest's right hand in the first
fight, constantly circled to his right in that opening round to stay
out of range of Forrest's most potent weapon.</TE>
<TE>   But as the fight wore on and the realization sunk in that the
Shane Mosley who had once been considered one of the best
pound-for-pound fighters in the world would not be able to
demonstrate that form against Forrest, the Pomona fighter began to
slip back into his old movement pattern to the left and began to
settle for holding off Forrest.</TE>
<TE>   "I still think I'm a great fighter," Mosley said. "Forrest is the
only guy to get away from my knockout [punch]. But I can make peace
with myself because I thought I fought a great fight."</TE>
<TE>   Mosley, who made $2.8 million Saturday, drops to 38-2 with 35
knockouts. Forrest, who earned $3.2 million, remains unbeaten at 35-0
with 26 knockouts.</TE>
<TE>   What's next for both men?</TE>
<TE>   Hopefully, matches better suited for a ring than a ballroom.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the semi-main event, Antonio Tarver (20-1, 17 knockouts)
avenged his only loss by beating Eric Harding (21-2-1, seven) on a
fifth-round TKO.</TE>
<TE>   Harding was knocked down three times, once at the end of the
fourth round and twice in the fifth, referee Bill Paige finally
stepping in to stop the bout 43 seconds into the round as Harding hit
the canvas for the final time.</TE>
<TE>   After both the first and second knockdowns, ringside observers
yelled at Paige to end the fight because of the punishment Harding
was absorbing.</TE>
<TE>   Tarver, too, was imploring Paige to stop the bout after the second
knockdown.</TE>
<TE>   In a preliminary match, bantamweight Clarence Vinson, a
bronze-medal winner at the 2000 Olympics, won a unanimous eight-round
decision over William DeSousa to remain unbeaten at 10-0 with five
knockouts.</TE>

<HD>Indiana Commission Chairman Says He Wasn't Pressured to
Remove Judge</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Springer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Insisting he did not cave in to pressure from the World Boxing
Council, William Kelsey, chairman of the Indiana Boxing Commission,
said his organization's decision to remove a judge from Saturday's
Vernon Forrest-Shane Mosley welterweight title fight was made at the
request of the Forrest camp.</LD>
<LD>   Kelsey was reacting Saturday to a letter sent to the commission
Friday by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) that charged the switch was made
because of a WBC threat to remove its sanction from the fight.</LD>
<LD>   Kelsey conceded the WBC had asked that judge Fred Jones, an
Indiana official who often works International Boxing Federation
matches, be replaced with Tony Castellano, more closely identified
with WBC fights.</LD>
<TE>   "We told them that we were not going to submit to pressure,"
Kelsey said.</TE>
<TE>   But, according to Kelsey, he was more responsive when a member of
the Forrest camp protested on the grounds that the IBF had stripped
Forrest of its welterweight title before he fought Mosley for the WBC
crown in January. A spokesman for the Forrest camp confirmed the
request.</TE>
<TE>   When the Mosley camp had no objection to the switch, Kelsey said,
the move was made Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, judge Duane Ford was replaced by Jerry Roth for the fight
at the request of the WBC. According to McCain, that was because Ford
had worked last month's Erik Morales-Marco Antonio Barrera fight.
According to Kelsey, it was because Ford had a previous commitment in
Japan.</TE>
<TE>   But it was the Jones-Castellano switch that caused the furor.</TE>
<TE>   "By interfering with the Indiana commission's assignment of
officials," wrote McCain, "the WBC has overstepped its role as a
sanctioning organization and attempted to supercede the powers of a
state regulatory agency. This misconduct is serious."</TE>

<HD>Galaxy Lets Its Defense Down, Ties Wizards</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Galaxy's ownership conglomerate, Anschutz Entertainment Group,
made a concerted effort this week to reach out to the Southland's
Korean community.</LD>
<LD>   So the team played host to a Korean Heritage Night at the Rose
Bowl, inviting fans of the South Korean national team to revel in its
World Cup success at the Galaxy's match against the Kansas City
Wizards.</LD>
<LD>   The thinking was that if enough red-attired Koreans showed up to
the Arroyo Seco, Major League Soccer would have to take notice and
sign a player from Korea and assign what would be a huge box-office
attraction to the Galaxy for next season.</LD>
<TE>   A Korean defender would have helped the Galaxy on Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy defense, which had been so solid in not giving up more
than one goal per game in a six-match stretch, had two mental
mistakes and each cost the Galaxy, which could muster only a 2-2 draw
with the Wizards in front of 17,863.</TE>
<TE>   "One day it's our offense that lets us down," Galaxy Coach Sigi
Schmid said. "Another day it's our defense that lets us down.</TE>
<TE>   "We expected [Kansas City] to come out and play a little bit
defensively so that was something that wasn't unexpected....
Psychologically, we gave up goals at very bad times in the game and
they were very soft goals."</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the Galaxy's feeling of lost opportunity was the fact
that it played with a man advantage for 46 minutes and did not
benefit.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City's fourth-minute score came with Preki bringing the
ball up the middle of the field and spying Chris Klein by himself on
the right flank. Defender Craig Waibel, whose assignment was to mark
Klein, instead closed in on Preki.</TE>
<TE>   Klein took Preki's pass on the run near the right side of the
18-yard box, dribbled a bit and then unloaded a right-footed shot
past goalkeeper Kevin Hartman.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy (8-7-3) tied the score in the 31st minute on a penalty
kick by Carlos Ruiz.</TE>
<TE>   After Chris Albright's straightaway shot from 25 yards was
deflected by a diving Tony Meola, Ruiz closed in to attempt to pick
up the carom.</TE>
<TE>   A collision between Meola and Ruiz ensued, sending Ruiz head over
heels. Referee Rich Grady quickly pulled out a red card for Meola,
sending the goalkeeper to the showers.</TE>
<TE>   Bo Oshoniyi replaced Meola in the goal for Ruiz's penalty kick
attempt and, diving to his right, deflected Ruiz's kick. But Ruiz
picked up the rebound and scored his 14th goal.</TE>
<TE>   After defender Ezra Hendrickson was issued a yellow card for a
reckless foul during stoppage time in the first half, Preki let loose
a free kick into the center of the box. Wizard defender Carey Talley
headed the ball home.</TE>
<TE>   Hendrickson's score in the 56th minute was the equalizer.</TE>
<TE>   The score delighted the approximate 3,500 Koreans who pounded
drums and sang "Galaxy must win" in their native tongue.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing was chanted, however, about a tie.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In other MLS games:</TE>
<TE>   San Jose 4, Dallas 0--Landon Donovan had a goal and an assist, and
Ariel Graziani scored in the third minute in front of 12,616 at San
Jose in a meeting of the league's top teams.</TE>
<TE>   Dwayne DeRosario had a goal and an assist, and Manny Lagos scored
in a three-goal first half as the Earthquakes preserved their place
atop the standings.</TE>
<TE>   The second-place Burn, which beat the Earthquakes, 2-1, in Dallas
a week ago, lost for only the second time in 10 games.</TE>
<TE>   Goalie Joe Cannon posted his league-leading seventh shutout.</TE>
<TE>   New York-New Jersey 4, New England 3--Mamadou Diallo scored two
goals and Andy Williams had a goal and an assist to lead the
MetroStars in front of 13,837 at East Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 1, Columbus 1--Chris Carrieri scored his seventh goal of
the season with two minutes remaining in regulation to give Colorado
a tie in front of 21,432 at Columbus, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 0, Chicago 0--D.C. United's Nick Rimando made eight
saves and Chicago's Zach Thornton made four in front of 14,432 at
Naperville, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   In WUSA games:</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 2, Carolina 0--Kerry Connors and Marinette Pichon
scored first-half goals in front of 6,946 at Villanova, Pa., ending
Carolina's league-record five-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 3, Boston 1--Charmaine Hooper and Nikki Serlenga scored
second-half goals in front of 6,114 at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 1, New York 0--Julie Fleeting scored in the 90th minute
in front of 4,002 at Uniondale, N.Y., extending the Power's
league-record losing streak to nine games.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A few more days like Saturday and everyone will know how to pronounce
Shaun Micheel's last name.</LD>
<LD>   Micheel seized control of the B.C. Open in the morning with a
hole-in-one as he finished his second round, then protected his
three-stroke advantage over Paul Gow as the two shot matching
five-under 67s in the third round at Endicott, N.Y.</LD>
<LD>   Micheel's total of 19-under 197 put the tournament scoring record
of 22-under 266--set when Gow and Jeff Sluman tied after four rounds
of last year's B.C. Open--within reach.</LD>
<TE>   Micheel (Mih-KEEL), in his third year on the PGA Tour, said he's
come to expect people to say his name wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "There are people who will ask you on the first tee, and still
maybe they're a little bit nervous they'll mispronounce it," he said.
"Most people think it's 'Michael.' But there's no 'a' in that at
all.... Normally we'll get to the first tee and I'll introduce
myself."</TE>
<TE>   With Gow three strokes better than the rest of the field, the two
will again play head-to-head in the final round at the En-Joie Golf
Club, with the $387,000 first prize and the all-important two-year
tour exemption on the line.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have any win experience, per se, but I've been out here
long enough that I know the things that you need to do to play well,"
Micheel said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bob Gilder rolled in a 25-foot eagle putt on the final hole to
finish off a course-record 63 and take a one-stroke lead after two
rounds of the SBC Senior Open at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Gilder, the rookie of the year on the senior tour last season when
he won twice and had 11 other top-10 finishes, followed up his
first-day 70 with a bogey-free round to go 11-under 133 on the
links-style course at Harborside International.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Wadkins was a stroke back after a 65.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kelly Robbins shot a four-under-par 68 to take a one-stroke lead
over Mi Hyun Kim heading into the final round of the Giant Eagle LPGA
Classic at Vienna, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   She began the day tied for the lead with Beth Bader.</TE>
<TE>   Kim birdied three of the first four holes to take over the top
spot before Robbins pulled even with a birdie at the eighth hole and
then took over by herself with a birdie at the 14th. Her 68, after an
opening 64, left her at 12-under 132.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Moore defeated Lee Williamson, 10 and 9, to win the U.S.
Amateur Public Links Championship at Washington Township, Mich. The
margin was the second-largest in tournament history behind Jim
Sorenson's 12-and-11 win over Jay Cooper in 1985.</TE>

<HD>Crowned Dancer Recovers</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: After failing in last month's Haggin Stakes,
he wins Hollywood Juvenile by two lengths.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An equipment change and a poor start by the even-money favorite
helped Crowned Dancer make amends for his failure in last month's
Haggin Stakes on Saturday at Hollywood Park.</LD>
<LD>   Racing in blinkers for the first time, Crowned Dancer, the 5-2
second choice, led throughout under jockey Alex Solis and went on to
beat 5-1 shot Outta Here by two lengths in the $108,300 Hollywood
Juvenile Championship.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by the Eastern Sky Unlimited Trust and Charles and Karen
Cono, and trained by Chris Paasch, the son of Tactical Advantage, who
was purchased for $225,000 earlier this year in Florida, won for the
second time in four starts and completed the six furlongs in 1:10.</LD>
<TE>   Outta Here, a maiden making his second start after a runner-up try
at 35-1 behind the promising Inamorato two weeks earlier, finished a
length in front of 11-1 shot Chief Planner, who finished half a
length in front of stablemate and favorite Kafwain.</TE>
<TE>   A $720,000 purchase by Prince Ahmed Salman's Thoroughbred Corp.
who had broken his maiden in quick time on June 22, Kafwain hesitated
leaving the gate and effectively lost all chance. He made a bid while
wide to get into contention around the turn, but weakened a bit late
and wound up 3 1/2 lengths behind the winner.</TE>
<TE>   "His first two races were so good, I thought his last race was too
bad to be believed," Paasch said of Crowned Dancer. "He had a slight
temperature the next day. When he came back to work, my exercise
rider said he seemed to be bored and looked around a lot, so we tried
blinkers. The blinkers really turned this horse around."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A stumbling start wasn't enough to thwart Jilbab in the $350,000
Coaching Club American Oaks at Belmont Park.</TE>
<TE>   Seemingly eliminated at the break when she nearly went to her
nose, the 3-year-old third choice overtook 12-1 shot Tarnished Lady
to win the Grade I by 1 1/2 lengths. Ridden by Mike Luzzi for
Godolphin Racing Inc. and trainer Saeed bin Suroor, Jilbab completed
the 1 1/2 miles in 2:31 2/5. It was her third win in seven starts and
first in a graded stakes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Magic Weisner, the 7-5 second choice, wore down favored Wiseman's
Ferry in the final strides to win the $300,000 Ohio Derby at
Thistledown.</TE>
<TE>   Owned, bred and trained by Nancy Alberts and ridden by Richard
Migliore, Magic Weisner, a gelded son of Ameri Valay, completed the 1
1/8 miles in 1:49 4/5. Best known for finishing second at 45-1 in the
Preakness, Magic Weisner has won seven of 13 and has banked $673,110.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Allamerican Bertie, the 5-2 third choice, rolled to a 6 1/4-length
victory over 9-5 favorite Alternate in the $250,300 Delaware Oaks at
Delaware Park.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Bertram, Elaine and Richard Klein and trained by Steve
Flint, the 3-year-old Quiet American filly completed the 1 1/16 miles
in 1:43 4/5 under jockey Larry Melancon.</TE>
<TE>   Adoration, a two-time stakes winner at Hollywood Park for trainer
Dave Hofmans, finished sixth and last under Garrett Gomez as the 2-1
second choice.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jockey Patrick Valenzuela clinched the riding title at Hollywood
Park with three more victories Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   He has a 70-60 lead over Solis going into the 65th and final day
of the meet.</TE>

<LD>Trainer Neil Drysdale has won a lot of major races during a career
that earned him election to the sport's hall of fame in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   He ranks seventh on the all-time list at Hollywood Park with 60
stakes victories, but one race has escaped him.</LD>
<LD>   Drysdale has yet to win the Sunset Handicap, a Grade II at 1 1/2
miles, a fact he'll try to change today when he sends out Slew The
Red against six others in the $250,000 closing-day feature.</LD>
<TE>   If the 5-year-old son of Red Ransom is successful, it will also
provide the trainer with his first stakes win of the meet, and the
dark bay is one of the top contenders in a weak renewal of the
Sunset.</TE>
<TE>   The stakes is the second race in a pick six that has a carryover
of $191,457. There is a mandatory payout because it is closing day.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Frankel, the meet's leading trainer, will attempt to collect
his third Sunset win when he saddles Lord Flasheart, the 9-5 favorite
on Russ Hudak's morning line.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood Park isn't the only track closing up shop. Belmont Park
concludes its spring-summer meet as the scene in New York shifts to
Saratoga on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The eighth at Hollywood Park is a competitive
turf sprint for $50,000 claimers. Contenders include FJ's Pace, the
3-1 favorite, Cryhavoc, Johnny Be Good, Champ's Star and Is It True
Mex.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Iggy Puglisi. The jockey had three victories Friday
night with two of the wins coming for trainer Paul Aguirre.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Antonio Castanon and Barrington Harvey. The two jockeys
were a combined 0 for 35 at Solano.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: Exactas in the eighth keying Cryhavoc with
FJ's Pace, Champ's Star, Is It True Mex and Johnny Be Good.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 1/166. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $3/$940.60. Total money bet: $1,100.</TE>

<LD>Go Green Go is a model of consistency.</LD>
<LD>   A 5-year-old gelding owned and bred by Alvaro and Raul Ramirez and
trained by Paul Jones, Go Green Go has won five of eight starts in
2002. In his three defeats, he was third and second twice.</LD>
<LD>   With regular rider Ramon Sanchez aboard, the California-bred son
of Blushing Bug will try for another victory in tonight's eighth, a
$12,550 allowance at 350 yards.</LD>
<TE>   Go Green Go will leave from the outside in the field of six and
post six has been kind to him. He won by 1 1/4 lengths from that post
on April 4 and, a little more than three months earlier, he had won

<LD>Alex Barron outran Gil de Ferran over the final two laps after a
restart, winning the Firestone Indy 200 Saturday night at Gladeville,
Tenn., for his first Indy Racing League victory.</LD>
<LD>   Barron, making his 11th IRL start, led only the final 11 laps to
become the fourth first-time winner in the last five series races.
His best finish had been fourth in the Indianapolis 500, where he
earned co-rookie honors.</LD>
<LD>   "I was actually calmer being in front than I was behind," said
Barron, who had not won a race since picking up five victories and
the Atlantic Series season title in 1997. "Once we went green, the
car handled beautifully, and we were flat out until the end. We
showed some really good speed."</LD>
<TE>   For de Ferran, it was his fourth second-place finish of the
season, and it moved him into the points lead by 10 ahead of Team
Penske teammate Helio Castroneves.</TE>

<HD>Saarloos Leads Astros Over the Cubs, 3-2</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The bases were loaded, the Houston Astros were clinging to a one-run
lead and Sammy Sosa was at the plate with the full house at Wrigley
Field cheering him on.</LD>
<LD>   Welcome back to the majors, Kirk Saarloos.</LD>
<LD>   But the rookie, recalled from triple-A New Orleans on Friday,
didn't falter. He retired Sosa on a groundout and went on to his
first major league victory as Houston beat the Chicago Cubs, 3-2,
Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   "He was pitching very well today. I'm very impressed, because he's
got a great changeup," Sosa said. "He got in a few situations and he
made good pitches. He didn't make many mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   Saarloos (1-2), a former Cal State Fullerton pitcher, gave up one
run and four hits in five innings, striking out seven. He did not
walk a batter.</TE>
<TE>   Julio Lugo homered and Geoff Blum drove in two runs for the
Astros. Billy Wagner struck out two in a perfect ninth for his 18th
save.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt a lot more at ease," Saarloos said of his second stint
with the Astros. "I came into the clubhouse, I knew the faces and
they were accepting of me. I was a lot more confident, more at ease
mentally."</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Zambrano (2-2) struck out a career-high 10, but it wasn't
enough as the Cubs stranded seven--including the tying run at third
in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 15, St. Louis 6--Adam Hyzdu hit a pair of three-run
homers and drove in seven runs at Pittsburgh, giving him 11 runs
batted in in two games.</TE>
<TE>   Hyzdu, a 30-year-old outfielder who had more than 4,000 at-bats in
the minors before reaching the majors briefly in 2000, had a
three-run shot in a five-run first inning against Travis Smith (3-1).</TE>
<TE>   Hyzdu, who had only seven career homers before the series, added
another three-run drive in the fifth against reliever Dave Veres, who
has given up two game-winning homers and eight runs in his last three
appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, the Cardinals demoted pitcher Bud Smith to
triple-A Memphis to make room on the roster for Chuck Finley.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 4, Philadelphia 3--Gary Sheffield and Andruw Jones each
drove in two runs, and John Smoltz converted his franchise-record
22nd consecutive save at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Julio Franco had two hits and scored twice for the Braves, who
have won five in a row and 22 of their last 28.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 6, Milwaukee 5--Todd Hollandsworth homered for the second
consecutive game at Denver, and Denny Stark made his second strong
start since joining the rotation.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Walker had two doubles and two RBIs for Colorado, which has
won three in a row and five of seven.</TE>
<TE>   New York 8, Cincinnati 7--Mo Vaughn hit a three-run homer at
Cincinnati and the Mets got solo shots from Mike Piazza and Edgardo
Alfonzo for the second consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 3, Montreal 0--Brad Penny pitched six innings to win for
the first time in nearly three months and Mike Lowell homered to lead
the Marlins at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   The Expos, hopeful that the recent acquisitions of pitcher Bartolo
Colon and outfielder Cliff Floyd would spark a run toward a wild-card
spot, committed three errors en route to their seventh loss in 10
games since the All-Star break.</TE>

<HD>Finley Leads Diamondbacks to Victory</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Outfielder doubles, triples and drives in four
runs as Arizona maintains lead in West with 7-1 victory over Padres.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Steve Finley tripled, doubled and drove in four runs as the Arizona
Diamondbacks ended a five-game losing streak against the last-place
San Diego Padres with a 7-1 victory Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   After being held scoreless through seven innings by rookie Oliver
Perez, the Diamondbacks tied the score on Finley's run-scoring triple
in the eighth inning.</LD>
<LD>   Arizona leads the Dodgers by 1 1/2 games in the National League
West.</LD>
<TE>   Finley capped his big night with a three-run double in the ninth,
eventually scoring on the play on a throwing error by second baseman
Julius Matos.</TE>
<TE>   Jay Bell, playing for the first time since scoring the winning run
in the World Series, singled in the go-ahead run with two out in the
eighth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Bell had been sidelined all season because of an injury to each
calf muscle until being activated Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   He made his season debut Saturday, playing first base for the
first time and going one for three with one RBI.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego's bullpen blew a 1-0 lead after Perez made another
impressive start, holding the Diamondbacks to four hits in seven
innings and striking out seven.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Reed started the eighth and walked the only batter he faced,
Junior Spivey. Lefty Mike Holtz (1-1) came on and got two straight
outs, but Finley tripled into the Diamondback bullpen in the
right-field corner to score Spivey with the tying run.</TE>
<TE>   Two pitches later, Bell singled up the middle to score Finley.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Counsell added an RBI double in the ninth for Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Myers (4-3) pitched 1 1/3 scoreless innings for the win.</TE>
<TE>   After walking Mark Kotsay with two out in the eighth, Myers struck
out Ryan Klesko.</TE>
<TE>   Padre catcher Tom Lampkin homered to right leading off the third
inning against John Patterson, who was making his major league debut.</TE>
<TE>   Patterson, a 24-year-old right-hander who had won his last five
decisions with triple-A Tucson, was recalled Friday after Rick
Helling went on the disabled list. Patterson gave up one run and
three hits in six innings.</TE>
<TE>   Perez, who at 20 is the youngest player in the majors, walked
three and lowered his earned-run average from 3.35 to 2.82.</TE>

<KH>NFL PRESEASON/ By SAM FARMER</KH>
<HD>Jump Aboard the NFL's Quarterback Carousel</HD>

<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NFL training camps begin this week. That can only mean two-a-day
practices, mind-numbing meetings and, in what has become a rite of
summer, a new starting quarterback in Baltimore.</LD>
<LD>   Chris Redman is the latest Raven savior and the team's sixth
starting quarterback in six seasons, following Vinny Testaverde, Jim
Harbaugh, Tony Banks, Trent Dilfer and Elvis Grbac.</LD>
<LD>   If Redman can't cut it, Jeff Blake is waiting in the wings.</LD>
<TE>   Quarterback might be a revolving-door position for the Ravens, but
they are not alone. There is potential for at least one new starting
quarterback in all eight divisions of the realigned league.</TE>
<TE>   The Ravens are in the AFC North, as are the Cincinnati Bengals,
who have added Gus Frerotte to the quarterback mix. He is expected to
compete for the starting job with Jon Kitna. And who knows what will
happen to Akili Smith, the No. 3 pick three years ago, who so far has
been nothing short of a colossal bust.</TE>
<TE>   In the AFC South, the expansion Houston Texans are convinced top
pick David Carr is the right man for the job. He probably will not
begin the season as the starter, however, instead backing up 11-year
veteran Kent Graham for a while. Many onlookers think that is the
smartest move.</TE>
<TE>   "You pay guys a lot of money, the natural tendency is to try to
get your pound of flesh," said ESPN analyst Joe Theismann, a former
Pro Bowl quarterback. "But I also think with a young quarterback in
particular, you stick him out into this environment and you can scar
him for life mentally."</TE>
<TE>   Then, every century or so, a Tom Brady comes along. Brady didn't
get the starting job in New England last season until Drew Bledsoe
went down in the second game and the Patriots already looked to be
circling the drain.</TE>
<TE>   But the team rallied around Brady, who wound up leading them to
their first championship and strolled away with Super Bowl MVP
honors.</TE>
<TE>   Proving he can take a hint, Bledsoe moved on to AFC East rival
Buffalo, where he will try to resurrect the struggling Bills.</TE>
<TE>   In Miami, Ray Lucas will temporarily take over the starting
quarterback job for Jay Fiedler, who will sit out training camp
because of hip surgery.</TE>
<TE>   John Butler, general manager of the AFC West's San Diego Chargers,
came from Buffalo and last season loaded the roster with former
players from the Bills.</TE>
<TE>   So it stands to reason that, like the 2002 Bills, the Chargers
also have a Drew B. angling for the quarterback job. That Charger is
second-year quarterback Drew Brees, who probably will replace Doug
Flutie sooner rather than later.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle is now in the NFC West, and Coach Mike Holmgren will hand
the starting quarterback job to Dilfer, who went 4-0 in replacing
struggling Matt Hasselbeck last season.</TE>
<TE>   There could be two new starting quarterbacks in the NFC North, the
former black-and-blue division. Mike McMahon is penciled in as the
starter in Detroit, although he is only keeping the job warm for No.
3 pick Joey Harrington. And in Chicago, newly acquired Chris Chandler
will challenge Jim Miller for the starting job.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, two of Coach Steve Spurrier's four quarterbacks
played at Florida--a shocker--but he says neither Shane Matthews nor
Danny Wuerffel has been promised the starting job. Spurrier says the
new quarterback could just as easily be Sage Rosenfels or rookie
Patrick Ramsey, which cannot be soothing news to Redskin fans.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Coach Jon Gruden's roster in Tampa Bay is loaded with
experienced quarterbacks. The Buccaneers, now in the NFC South, have
starter Brad Johnson and backups Shaun King and Rob Johnson. All
three have not only been NFL starters, but have started playoff
games.</TE>
<TE>   With Chandler in Chicago, the fate of the Atlanta offense rests
squarely in the hands of quarterback Michael Vick, the first pick in
the 2001 draft.</TE>
<TE>   Vick has astounding arm strength and dazzling speed. He should
provide some thrilling highlights. If things don't work out for Vick
in Atlanta, all is not lost.</TE>
<TE>   There's always Baltimore.</TE>

<LD>Gleanings from the world of the spinning ball, a mix of good news,
bad news and just plain weird news. Take your pick....</LD>
<LD>   Bora for the Birds</LD>
<LD>   No matter where he goes, Bora Milutinovic finds a way to get
quoted.</LD>
<TE>   The former coach of Mexico, Costa Rica, the United States, Nigeria
and China was in Tibet recently on a post-World Cup holiday with his
wife and daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, to be able to see Tibet with my own eyes makes me very
happy," Milutinovic told China's Xinhua news agency.</TE>
<TE>   "Lhasa is beautiful. Everything about Tibet left a very good
impression on me, especially the Tibetan people."</TE>
<TE>   And there was a typical Bora postscript to the visit.</TE>
<TE>   "Just before I leave this world, I will come back to Tibet for a
sky burial," he said, referring to the traditional Tibetan practice
of leaving corpses for birds of prey to pick clean.</TE>
<TE>   Presently, Bora has been cleaning up. The Asian Wall Street
Journal reported during the World Cup that Milu, as he is known to
the Chinese, had "become the king of celebrity endorsements in China,
extolling the virtues of health drinks, air conditioners, digital
recorders, and a fiery rice liquor, and recently licensed his name to
launch his own line of sports clothing."</TE>
<TE>   China went winless in its first World Cup, but Bora did very well
in his fifth.</TE>
<TE>   The Illuminated Phenomenon</TE>
<TE>   Nezio Nascimento--no relation to Edson Arantes do Nascimento,
better known as Pele--has a plan for next year's carnival in Rio de
Janeiro.</TE>
<TE>   Nascimento is president of Tradicao, one of Brazil's top samba
groups, and the group plans to honor Brazil's World Cup victory, and
Ronaldo's role in particular, at the carnival.</TE>
<TE>   The theme for Tradicao's costumed dancers will be "Brazil is
five-time champion; R is 9--the illuminated phenomenon," Nascimento
said.</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo was once nicknamed "the Phenomenon," but is now more
popularly known as R9, for his name and jersey number.</TE>
<TE>   No Pay, No Play</TE>
<TE>   Vampeta, Ronaldo's teammate on Brazil's World Cup-winning team,
has voiced what must be an early candidate for soccer quote of the
year.</TE>
<TE>   The midfielder said he had deliberately played poorly last season
for Flamengo because he was not being paid by Edmundo Santos Silva,
the recently ousted president of the famous but financially
struggling club.</TE>
<TE>   "The Flamengo president pretended to pay me and I pretended to
play," Vampeta said.</TE>
<TE>   Faster and Faster</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Queiroz, the Portuguese coach who netted a tidy sum from
U.S. Soccer a few years ago for drafting the federation's blueprint
for the future, will have a more difficult time improving Manchester
United than he would have had in improving the American players, had
he become U.S. coach.</TE>
<TE>   Queiroz, 49, is now assistant and heir apparent to Alex Ferguson
at Manchester United.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have a sprinter who can reach 100 meters in 12 seconds,
it is easier to make an impact on his times," Queiroz told the
Manchester Evening News. "To bring a sprinter down from 12 seconds to
10.1 or something like that is achievable and can be done a lot
quicker.</TE>
<TE>   "However, when you have a sprinter who can do 9.9 seconds, then to
make him run 9.7 sometimes you can spend your whole life doing it,
but it can be done. Manchester United is the sprinter who has
achieved 9.9 seconds. At this club it is not easy to be better and
better and better.</TE>
<TE>   "The magic here is to make things more perfect."</TE>
<TE>   Final Flight</TE>
<TE>   Even today, more than four decades after it was written, "The Day
a Team Died" remains compelling reading for soccer fans, telling the
story of the 1958 airline crash in Munich, Germany, in which 23
people were killed, including eight Manchester United players.</TE>
<TE>   The team was on its way home from a game against Red Star Belgrade
and the plane crashed on take-off after stopping to refuel in Munich.</TE>
<TE>   One of those who was badly injured in the crash but survived was
journalist Frank Taylor, who wrote the definitive book about the
ordeal.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor died last week at age 81, and Manchester United, to its
credit, made note of his passing.</TE>
<TE>   Ugly Italians</TE>
<TE>   Now that Giovanni Trapattoni has been told he will remain Italy's
coach through the 2004 European Championship in Portugal, one of the
first things he is likely to do is sit down with striker Christian
Vieri and figure out what's bugging him.</TE>
<TE>   Vieri, who needs only one goal in 2006 to become Italy's all-time
leading goal scorer at the World Cup, blasted his countrymen a few
days ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Today in Italy we play badly, we produce ugly football," the
Inter Milan forward told Gazzetta Dello Sport. "The Spanish and
English championships are more entertaining, more spectacular. Our
football is behind in respect to the others."</TE>
<TE>   Trapattoni's World Cup team was too cautious, he said, and lacked
self-belief.</TE>
<TE>   "Have you heard what Ronaldo said?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   " 'We play with three or four attackers because we are Brazil. It
is the others who should be worried about us.'</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to be able to say the same--'We are Italy.' If you
think about the other teams, you are not strong."</TE>
<TE>   The Saga Continues</TE>
<TE>   The reigning women's world champion takes on the reigning women's
Olympic champion today in Blaine, Minn., when the United States plays
Norway in a friendly prelude to next year's Women's World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   The game, to be shown live on ESPN at 10 a.m., has added interest
because it marks the return of forward Mia Hamm and goalkeeper Briana
Scurry, as both set out on a course they hope will take them and the
U.S. to China in 2003 to defend the world title they won at the Rose
Bowl in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Norway has won four in a row over the U.S., most devastatingly in
the final of the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000, and U.S. Coach April
Heinrichs has to find a way to reverse that trend.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is that this is a game we need to win," said
veteran defender Brandi Chastain, who turns 34 today. "Of course, it
doesn't impact on the World Cup or anything, but we haven't played up
to our standards in the last few games against Norway. You can expect
a game that will be combative from the first whistle to the end."</TE>

<HD>Still at a Loss</HD>
<DH>Alan and Sherry Stowers seek answers almost a year after
their son collapsed from heatstroke during football practice and died</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE PUCIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KIRKLIN, Ind.</DL>
<LD>Alan and Sherry Stowers want to know why their son, Travis, a
6-foot-2, 220-pound 17-year-old, died after high school football
practice last year.</LD>
<LD>   They want to know what went wrong, why, how.</LD>
<LD>   "If I have a calf die here on the farm," Alan says, "I do whatever
I have to do to find out why that calf died. Travis wasn't a calf.
Travis was a boy. And nobody seems to care about finding out why he
died."</LD>
<TE>   Alan and Sherry Stowers want to make things better. They want to
know what happened at Clinton Central High's football practice last
July 31 and they want to make sure things have changed. Changed for
their other sons, Jared, a sophomore, and Clayton, an eighth-grader.
And for other sons who head off to football practice every summer.</TE>
<TE>   If practice lasted too long, they want to know it will never
happen again. If not enough water was offered to the players, they
want coaches to make sure that will never happen again. If the boys
on the field weren't being watched closely enough, if no one in
authority paid attention to the boy who vomited in the morning, who
was wobbling in the afternoon and who was dead by evening, then Alan
and Sherry Stowers would like to know that from now on football
coaches everywhere will pay attention.</TE>
<TE>   "We taught our children to be honest, faithful, responsible and
accountable for their actions," Sherry says. "How can we not ask the
same of the coaches and the school?"</TE>
<TE>   On July 31, 2001, Travis Stowers, a nationally recognized
livestock caller, talented public speaker, earnest owner of calves,
hogs and horses, future veterinarian and modestly talented but
fervently interested offensive and defensive tackle, drove himself
and his younger brother Jared to the second day of football practice.</TE>
<TE>   In the morning session of two-a-days, Travis vomited into his
helmet. At lunch, Travis told Jared he wasn't feeling well. After
running a series of 10 40-yard sprints, the Bulldogs left the field
for water. Travis walked unsteadily, Jared said, then rested his
shoulders against his brother.</TE>
<TE>   "Travis said he wasn't feeling good," Jared says. "He sat down and
leaned on my leg. He couldn't get up."</TE>
<TE>   Jared Stowers sometimes blames himself, his mother says.</TE>
<TE>   "Jared was a freshman. It was his second day of high school
football. And Jared keeps trying to figure out what he could have
done," Sherry says. "Jared didn't do anything wrong, but he keeps
trying to figure things out."</TE>
<TE>   The Stowers family is speaking publicly about the death of their
son for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Next week the family plans to file a lawsuit alleging negligence
on the part of the Clinton Central school district and the Indiana
High School Athletic Assn. It took the Stowerses nearly six months
after Travis' death to hire Indianapolis attorney Bruce Kehoe.</TE>
<TE>   This is not about money. According to Indiana law, a state
institution can't be held liable for more than $300,000 in damages.
The Stowerses aren't doing this for the money. Kehoe has held several
settlement conferences with the school. What the family wants most of
all is change. Change in the way practice is conducted and monitored.</TE>
<TE>   Filing this lawsuit hurts. Sherry is a teacher in the county
district. Alan played football at the local high school, as did his
brothers, father and grandfather.</TE>
<TE>   There is a photo montage in the family's living room. Travis'
great-grandfather, Oren, is in his stance, wearing a leather helmet
and no facemask; Max, Travis' grandfather, is standing tall and
looking stern in his football gear; Alan, a 1978 graduate of Clinton
Central, is a proud Bulldog in his gear; and there are Travis, Jared
and Clayton, together, in helmets and pads.</TE>
<TE>   "We are friends with the seven school board members," Alan says.
"The principal [Ron Dunn] was my driver's ed teacher. The athletic
director [Linda Barnett] was a teacher. We know these people. This is
not what we wanted."</TE>
<TE>   In a couple of weeks the Clinton Central Bulldogs will begin
football practice. Two-a-days starting in the morning. A break for
lunch. Then more practice. Just like last year.</TE>
<TE>   George Gilbert will begin his 15th season as Bulldog coach. On his
Web site, Gilbert says the Bulldogs lost a lot of talent from last
year's 7-4 team and that they will need to toughen up on defense. It
will be a busy year for Gilbert. He has added wrestling coach to his
job description.</TE>
<TE>   The summer heat has arrived in central Indiana, just like last
year. The humidity rises during the day. By 1 p.m. at the Stowers
home, it feels as if you must push through a wet paper towel to walk
from the car to the front door. Insects seem suspended in the thick
air.</TE>
<TE>   On the day Travis collapsed at football practice, the heat index
was 110. That's what the Stowers family's attorney, Kehoe, has
discovered.</TE>
<TE>   On the day Travis collapsed at football practice, another athlete,
a big man who made millions of dollars playing the game, also
collapsed at football practice. Korey Stringer, the Minnesota Viking
All-Pro offensive lineman, felt tingling in his hands. He got wobbly
and incoherent and nauseated, just like Travis. Like Travis, he would
soon be dead.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, there has been a minute-by-minute accounting of what
happened to Stringer at his final practice. A state organization
charged with regulating workplace safety investigated Stringer's
working conditions. The NFL has studied the practice situation. A
$100-million lawsuit has been filed against the Vikings by Stringer's
widow, Kelci. A nationally known trial attorney is handling the case.</TE>
<TE>   Alan and Sherry Stowers still don't know what happened to Travis
that day. Other than the standard autopsy and coroner's report, no
county or state organization has done any investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The school did an investigation using its own lawyer. No written
report was issued. All the Stowerses were told was that nothing
improper had happened on the day Travis died.</TE>
<TE>   So what Sherry and Alan have found out is in bits and pieces. What
they know comes from Jared, a couple of other players and emergency
medical personnel.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had had the boys out baling hay with me," Alan says, "and
Travis had gotten sick in the morning and I had told him he had one
more bale to do in the heat of the afternoon, then he died, what
would have happened to me, to our family?</TE>
<TE>   "Children's Services would have been here. I might not have my
kids today. But Travis dies at football practice and nothing
happens."</TE>
<TE>   Kehoe says something was done wrong.</TE>
<TE>   According to the detailed schedule posted on the Clinton Central
football Web site last summer, on the second day of practice the
Bulldogs were to be on the field for 260 minutes. According to IHSAA
rules, "The first two days shall be non-contact practices limited to
two 90-minute sessions per day or less with a two-hour break between
sessions."</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert's practice schedule was followed, Jared says. That means
the Bulldogs spent 80 minutes more than allowed on the field. It was
after the 230th minute of practice when Travis wobbled, then sat and
leaned against his brother.</TE>
<TE>   According to the practice schedule, this would have been about
1:45 p.m. At 2 p.m. an ambulance call went out. Eight minutes later,
the ambulance arrived. Emergency personnel found Travis in a shower.
He was packed in ice. His body temperature was 108 degrees. Travis,
after being transported to the hospital in nearby Frankfort, was
taken by helicopter to a trauma center in Indianapolis, where he
died.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Alan and Sherry Stowers have tried to live life for
Jared and Clayton while trying to learn what happened to Travis.</TE>
<TE>   This is the second son Alan and Sherry have lost.</TE>
<TE>   Travis had been born more than two months prematurely along with
his twin brother, Trent. Travis weighed 3 pounds 11 ounces. Trent was
bigger. He weighed more than 4 pounds but his lungs weren't
developed. Trent was 9 weeks old when he died.</TE>
<TE>   As Sherry and Alan talk about Travis, Jared and Clayton sit
quietly.</TE>
<TE>   After playing football last fall, by rote almost, more as a robot
than as a boy, Jared has quit the sport.</TE>
<TE>   "Jared's a better athlete than Travis," Alan says. "We're glad
he's not playing for this coach and this team the way things are. But
we didn't pressure him and we still love football. Football didn't
kill Travis."</TE>
<TE>   Jared says he just couldn't play for Gilbert. "What happened on
that day shouldn't have happened," Jared says. "We practiced too hard
for too long. There are a lot of things that haven't been answered. I
wouldn't feel right playing football right now."</TE>
<TE>   Clayton will play for his eighth-grade team. "But I will say this
is my last year of football. I really don't want to play for Coach
Gilbert," Clayton says.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Clayton will change his mind. His parents won't stop him.</TE>
<TE>   "I find myself not wanting to let the boys out of my sight,"
Sherry says. "But you can't do that to Jared and Clayton. They
deserve to live life. It's just that football practice was the last
place I worried about sending the boys. The last place."</TE>
<TE>   The Stowers living room is filled with pictures of all the boys.
They share the same smile, the same serious eyes.</TE>
<TE>   It was Travis who first joined Future Farmers of America and began
showing calves, horses and hogs. It was Travis who first become a
nationally known livestock judge and who chose football as the sport
he loved. It was Travis who drove Jared to football practice, who got
Jared to share in raising the hogs and calves for the county fair. It
was Travis, the big junior chaperoning his freshman brother through
the pitfalls and tests of the high school gridiron.</TE>
<TE>   Sherry Stowers makes a point of saying Travis' autopsy report
showed no evidence of steroids or dietary supplements in his system.
"Not even a trace of caffeine," Sherry says. "Travis always made a
big deal about telling Jared and Clayton to drink water and not pop."</TE>
<TE>   Just two days before his high school practice started, Travis had
attended a football camp at nearby De Pauw University. Almost every
day of the humid summer, Travis was out baling hay and caring for his
animals. "My boy was in good shape," Alan says. "This shouldn't have
happened."</TE>
<TE>   But what happened? And why?</TE>
<TE>   On the day after Travis died, Principal Dunn and Athletic Director
Barnett said Travis had died of a brain aneurysm, which, if true,
would have left the school and coaches without culpability. Except it
wasn't true. The coroner's report said he died of heatstroke.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the coach has used obscenities and hung up the phone
on a reporter. The superintendent has refused to comment. The
principal wouldn't leave his office to speak.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to reach all three again last week failed.</TE>
<TE>   The IHSAA issued seven pages of instructions on conducting
practice to coaches and its position is that that is the end of its
responsibility. "Shouldn't the IHSAA want to know if the coaches are
following the rules?" Alan asks.</TE>
<TE>   A month after Travis died, Alan and Sherry received some mail. It
was from Travis, addressed to himself. It was written at a Future
Farmers of America leadership seminar. It was a list of goals Travis
had set for himself.</TE>
<TE>   "Travis, work on your leadership skills. Talk to people. Get out
of your comfort zone. Raise those hogs!</TE>
<TE>   "Remember, you have great parents that always support you.</TE>
<TE>   "Be a role model for your brothers. Love them ... and remember
their help. Support them in all they do.</TE>
<TE>   "Help out all you can on the farm. Work on your academics. It will
get you where you want to go. Keep your faith and improve on it.
Follow the best you can. And with all this for you, you can go
wherever you want. Good luck! Remember, Travis Stowers."</TE>

<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>No revenge, no redemption. No triumphant celebration in the ring, no
victory party.</LD>
<LD>   Not enough hurtful punches, not enough tiring flurries of
combinations, not enough counterattacking, not enough answers for a
man who is better.</LD>
<LD>   And no excuses. Please, no excuses.</LD>
<TE>   Shane Mosley, an energetic mover at the first and a wistful
thinker at the last, lost to Vernon Forrest in a World Boxing Council
welterweight championship fight. Again.</TE>
<TE>   For the second time in six months. For the same reasons. Because
Mosley couldn't duck under enough punches. Because Mosley couldn't
find his way inside to hurt the taller, lankier and steadier Forrest.</TE>
<TE>   "The Rematch of the Century" was more of the same old, same old.</TE>
<TE>   Mosley, 30, a thoughtful man from Pomona, a proud boxer who always
has felt underappreciated even when he stunned the boxing world by
beating Oscar De La Hoya at Staples Center, is not as good as
Forrest.</TE>
<TE>   In 40 professional fights, Mosley has lost twice. Both times to
Forrest.</TE>
<TE>   When the fight was over, before the unanimous decision was
announced, Mosley was hoisted onto the shoulders of his father and
coach, Jack. Mosley raised his arms high, as if to proclaim himself
the winner, as if to pretend that by acting as the winner, it would
be so.</TE>
<TE>   And afterward, Mosley came to an interview room. He was smiling.
He was unmarked. He seemed unhurt by any of Forrest's punches.
Forrest had a swollen cheek under his right eye. Forrest had been
touched by a flurry of Mosley's punches in the ninth round. Not hurt
enough in what had begun at a furious pace but had finished in a
languorous, sleepy rhythm.</TE>
<TE>   It was the rhythm Forrest preferred and which Mosley settled into.</TE>
<TE>   Mosley seemed surprised he didn't receive extra credit for coming
out fast and aggressive. Mosley went at Forrest in the first minute
of the 12-round fight. Mosley was wound tight and throwing punches
here, there and everywhere. He jumped back and forth, bobbed, weaved,
stutter-stepped, danced, wiggled and waggled. Activity disguised as
action.</TE>
<TE>   More amused than worried, Forrest waited.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think it would keep up," Forrest said. "And it didn't.
Pretty soon things settled down into my way."</TE>
<TE>   It was an uncomfortable fight with more holding than punching and
more booing than cheering. It was as if the boxers knew they didn't
belong.</TE>
<TE>   Entertainment? A hearty brawl in the stands between two men and
two women brought the crowd of 15,775 to its feet. That was something
Forrest and Mosley couldn't do. The fans turned their backs on the
ring and roared with approval as five security officials were needed
to eject one writhing and struggling man.</TE>
<TE>   Then they turned back and booed Mosley and Forrest, who were
hugging each other. Is hugging a tactic? Do the judges count the
number of hugs? It seemed they must as often as Mosley and Forrest
clinched.</TE>
<TE>   There had been much made this week by Mosley's camp about a head
butt by Forrest during their last bout at Madison Square Garden. The
accusation was that Forrest planned to use his head as a weapon.</TE>
<TE>   "No head butts this time," Forrest's trainer, Ronnie Fields, said.
"No low blows, no controversy. What excuse can they use this time?"</TE>
<TE>   Jack Mosley tried to make a tepid case that the scoring wasn't
fair, that his son wasn't given credit for his activity.</TE>
<TE>   "It was ludicrous [the unanimous decision]," Jack Mosley said. "If
anything, this could have been a draw. The champion would still have
kept his belt. But at least give Shane that, a draw."</TE>
<TE>   Those are the words of surrender. A father, a coach, a trainer,
begging for a face-saving draw so that Forrest could keep his belt
and his son could, what, keep his pride?</TE>
<TE>   Someone asked Mosley if he'd like a third fight with Forrest. If
the people want it, Mosley said.</TE>
<TE>   The people won't want it. They've had it twice. A winner has been
declared. Forrest is a better welterweight than Mosley. Forrest is
already talking of moving on, of possibly fighting De La Hoya.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people thought this fight was a draw," Mosley said. "Or
maybe that I edged it out. And, no, I don't feel he's better than me.
I guess the judges saw him as better than me. But only in the judges'
eyes."</TE>
<TE>   In more eyes than that. This rivalry is over. It is no more. As
Forrest said, "Next."</TE>

<LD>There were more than 50,000 fans in Dodger Stadium on Saturday, all
with the opportunity to bid on four bases decorated and autographed
by Shawn Green, Paul Lo Duca, Kevin Brown and Manager Jim Tracy to
benefit "Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities."</LD>
<LD>   By the sixth inning the $500 maximum bids had been accepted on
Green's base, the first to sell out. Then Lo Duca's, followed by
Tracy's.</LD>
<LD>   That left only Brown's base available, two Dodger employees
sitting there patiently hoping and begging someone would be excited
about getting an autographed base from the only player on the team
who doesn't play but has use of a private plane, making it a
collector's item.</LD>
<TE>   After eight innings and repeated promotional announcements on the
scoreboard, Brown's base still sat there--fetching a high bid of only
$200 for such a worthy cause.</TE>
<TE>   With one out in the ninth, I bid $250, figuring it'd make a great
conversation piece--probably the only way I was ever going to get to
first base with Brown.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SOMETHING MIGHTY strange happened, however, and I'm not talking
about the Dodgers winning a game. Someone stole my base.</TE>
<TE>   I went to the clubhouse thinking I had tendered the highest
bid--with the rules to the auction stating it'd be open from first
pitch to last. But I noticed the Dodgers were still holding the
auction open after the game, which made me wonder if someone called
Brown in the clubhouse and told him he'd better call one of his
friends to make a higher bid, or I'd be wiping my shoes on him.</TE>
<TE>   I figured I was still safe, knowing how tough it'd be for Brown to
find a friend.</TE>
<TE>   A young Dodger employee had promised to inform me about the final
bid after the game, but I never saw her again. That happens to a lot
of Dodger employees after they've been seen talking with me. Later,
another Dodger employee said the base went for $275 to someone
unknown. I hear Brown's wife was at the game.</TE>
<TE>   I'm just disappointed. I had plans to put Brown's base by the
front door, and step on it every day for inspiration, maybe get a
lead and write another column.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN DAVEY Johnson was the manager of the Dodgers, I found a good
deal in the book "Baseball for Dummies," to help him. Tracy seems
more advanced than Johnson, but he's still prone to making dumb
mistakes like juggling Marquis Grissom and Dave Roberts in center
field.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts has shown speed, improved bunting and even an ability to
hit left-handed pitching. Yet Tracy still goes with a strikeout-prone
Grissom when a left-handed pitcher starts the game for the
opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Why not just make Roberts the Dodgers' every-game leadoff hitter
and center fielder? "I'll sleep on it," Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   My response: It's time to wake up.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ERIC KARROS took a pitch to the chin, and the Dodgers rallied to
beat the Giants. "When something like that happens," Tracy said, "it
will spur you on." How come someone didn't think about having Karros
lead with his chin a week ago?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A TV note during Friday's game said Karros had no sacrifice bunts
in his 12-year pro career. "I've never been asked," he said Saturday.
"The only time I was asked was during winter ball in Venezuela, and I
did it."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy said he didn't consider having Karros bunt. Karros struck
out, and Green was thrown out trying to steal. I wonder if Johnson
left that book behind.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE DODGERS continue to show Lo Duca's photo on the scoreboard
with a mustache, as if he really needs a reminder of how awful he
looked when he had one.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IF I asked you what sport Tommy Haas plays, many of you might
answer golf, thinking the British Open. But I read where he will be
the No. 1-seeded player in this week's tennis tournament at UCLA.
That's how obscure men's tennis has become.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HENRY WINKLER, a.k.a. "The Fonz," was a guest in the box of Dodger
chairman Bob Daly. A reminder, I guess, of Happy Days.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE UMPIRES stopped the game after Jeff Kent complained of a glare
behind home plate. Once they discovered it was only silver-tipped Stu
Nahan, the game resumed. (Jim Healy would have gotten a kick out of
that.)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ERIC GAGNE needed only 13 pitches to strike out Benito Santiago,
Shawon Dunston and Tsuyoshi Shinjo on Friday night, prompting Tracy
to say, "That was as devastating an inning as I've seen in 27 years
of professional baseball. I've never seen three major league hitters
dominated like they were." I guess you would have to consider them
"three major league hitters."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE GIANTS have lost Barry Bonds because of a sore hamstring,
apparently much to the delight of Kent, who homered in the first
inning and crossed the plate without having to worry about shaking
Bonds' hand.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE GRACIOUS, good-natured TV interview Tiger Woods gave with no
excuses after the worst round of professional golf he has played
should be duplicated and given to every pro athlete. As for sports
editor Bill Dwyre, who I'm sure said, "I could do that," after
hearing Woods fired an 81, I'd make a copy of that and send it to
Woods; the guy probably needs a good laugh.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Ruben Rodriguez:</TE>
<TE>   "As a LOS ANGELES police officer, I support the LOS ANGELES
Dodgers, through good times and bad times. As a so-called LOS ANGELES
sportswriter, I suggest you do the same. Or, may I suggest moving to
a city whose team you may actually like?"</TE>
<TE>   Are we talking a police escort out of town?</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mwadi Mabika's finger was a little crooked, but her shot stayed
pretty straight.</LD>
<LD>   Mabika scored 13 of her 15 points after dislocating an index
finger, and Lisa Leslie had 14 points before fouling out to lead the
Sparks to a 63-50 victory over the Cleveland Rockers on Saturday
before 10,420 at Cleveland.</LD>
<LD>   Mabika played only four minutes in the first half, when she
dislocated the finger on her shooting hand while on defense. But the
Sparks' leading scorer returned after halftime with it taped and
scored 11 points in a seven-minute span when the Sparks blew it open.</LD>
<TE>   "They popped it back into place," Mabika said. "I was hoping I
wouldn't have to shoot very much with it."</TE>
<TE>   Mabika made five of eight shots in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   "She stepped up for us," said Leslie, who played on a sore ankle.
"She was afraid to shoot because of her finger. And we were like,
'Wadi, still go strong.' She did a great job of getting me the ball
inside and taking control of the game."</TE>
<TE>   Leslie fouled out with 7:46 remaining, but by then the Sparks had
a 19-point lead.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Nikki Teasley had 14 points, seven rebounds and eight
assists for the Sparks (17-4), who went 3-2 on this road trip.</TE>
<TE>   "This was an important win for us because of the game in New
York," Mabika said. "We needed this game so bad after that loss. I
can't wait to get home."</TE>
<TE>   The Rockers shot just 26% from the floor and lost their fourth
consecutive home game.</TE>
<TE>   Penny Taylor scored 11 points--on three-for-14 shooting--to lead
Cleveland, and Merlakia Jones had nine points and nine rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   The Rockers made only two of 24 shots during a stretch when the
Sparks turned a five-point deficit into a 20-point lead.</TE>
<TE>   "We made them take tough shots, but offensively, we couldn't get
anything going," said Rocker guard Jennifer Rizzotti. "And that
really hurt us in the second half. When they started to pull away, we
started to force some things."</TE>
<TE>   The Rockers led, 23-18, in the first half before making five
turnovers and missing six consecutive shots as the Sparks scored
seven straight points to lead, 25-23, at the break.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In other WNBA games, Marie Ferdinand scored 21 points and Margo
Dydek sparked a late surge to give the Utah Starzz an 83-73 victory
over the Washington Mystics before 16,477 at Washington.... Swin Cash
scored 11 points and Astou Ndiaye-Diatta had 10 as the Detroit Shock
beat the Miami Sol, 69-48, before 5,984 at Auburn Hills, Mich.
Detroit Coach Bill Laimbeer was ejected after receiving his second
technical foul with 4:07 left.... Janeth Arcain's basket from the top
of the key with less than two seconds remaining gave the Houston
Comets a 56-54 victory over the Seattle Storm before 9,686 at
Seattle. Sheryl Swoopes had made a free throw on a technical foul by
the Storm's Michelle Marciniak to tie it.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For a little more than four minutes Saturday night, the Janet Evans
Invitational had the atmosphere of an Olympic-caliber swim meet.</LD>
<LD>   That's the time it took Erik Vendt and Michael Phelps to deliver a
spine-tingling race in the 400-meter individual medley, producing the
top two times in the world in the event in front of about 500 at the
McDonald's Swim Stadium at USC.</LD>
<LD>   Vendt, the NCAA men's swimmer of the year at USC last spring, won
in 4 minutes 13.93 seconds, a personal best by three seconds and the
12th-fastest time in the world this year. Phelps, who was voted
athlete of the year by USA Swimming last year, finished second in
4:14.15, a lifetime best by one second.</LD>
<TE>   "When you're racing against Phelps, you're racing against nothing
short of excellence," said Vendt, the 2000 Olympic silver medalist.
"I think we pushed each other to a new level."</TE>
<TE>   Phelps, a 17-year-old from Baltimore and the world-record holder
in the 200 butterfly, had a two-second advantage over Vendt after the
opening butterfly leg. Vendt, 21, shaved a second off Phelps' lead on
the backstroke, then moved ahead for good during the first half of
the breaststroke.</TE>
<TE>   Lindsay Benko, a USC graduate, won the women's 200 freestyle in
1:59.11, just over a second off the meet record.</TE>
<TE>   Klete Keller won the 200 freestyle in 1:51.97. Keller swam for USC
last spring but left with two years of eligibility remaining to turn
professional.</TE>
<TE>   Amanda Beard, who won two silver medals in the breaststroke at the
1996 Olympics before her sophomore year at Irvine High, finished
second to Tara Kirk in the women's 200 breaststroke. Kirk finished in
2:29.25, Beard in 2:29.29.</TE>
<TE>   Ryosuke Imai won the men's 200 breaststroke in 2:16.40, just off
the meet record of 2:16.09.</TE>
<TE>   Roland Schoeman won the men's 50 freestyle in 22.61, just ahead of
Jason Lezak of the Irvine Novaquatics (22.76).</TE>

<HD>Welcome to the Dog Days of Men's Tennis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL DWYRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>OK, tennis fans. Get out the sunscreen and the Fila caps. Tie your
Nikes with double knots. Monday is kickoff.</LD>
<LD>   The men's summer season begins, right here in Los Angeles, at
UCLA's tennis stadium, home of the ATP Mercedes-Benz Cup. It is a
gateway to that wonderful two months of heat and hell, leading to the
ultimate two weeks of heat and hell, the U.S. Open, which starts Aug.
26.</LD>
<LD>   Usually, there is nothing quite like it. Note the word "usually."</LD>
<TE>   The Australian Open is down and under and so far away that only
the true tennis fan gets goose-bumpy. The French is almost always a
procession of unpronounceable names, sliding around on slow courts
for three and four hours at a time and getting their socks dirty. And
Wimbledon, well, it's just a marvelous aberration, the most important
tournament in the world played on a surface that few will ever play
on and even fewer will master. Grass-court season is a three-week
trophy dash that ends in London and captures everybody's fancy as
much with tradition and folklore as with great execution of the game.</TE>
<TE>   But the U.S. Open and its lead-up hard-court events?</TE>
<TE>   Now there's the true testosterone. There's where men are men and
the weak need not apply.</TE>
<TE>   They make all these silly TV shows out of survival situations and
spend millions producing them when they ought to simply film the next
month and a half of the men's tour at places such as Cincinnati,
Indianapolis, Washington, Long Island, Atlanta and Toronto. These are
places where the on-court thermometer can turn numbers higher than
the serve speed clock. Watch the boys hit huge strokes, watch them
chase down great lobs, watch them go to the back of the court and get
sick to their stomachs.</TE>
<TE>   This is when tennis sells itself in the United States. This is
often make-or-break time for a game struggling to maintain its piece
of the sports-world pie.</TE>
<TE>   And this, tennis folks, could be a two-month disaster for the
men's game.</TE>
<TE>   The summer of 2002 could very well be remembered in the world of
tennis as the summer of David Nalbandian or the summer of our
discontent. Indeed, were it to be the first, it certainly would be
the second.</TE>
<TE>   Nalbandian is the young Argentine who somehow made his way to the
Wimbledon final. He was so unheralded only his mother had heard of
him.</TE>
<TE>   He lost, of course, to Lleyton Hewitt, but the damage was done.
The integrity of the men's game took a stake in the heart.
Second-round loser Pete Sampras, who has won seven Wimbledon titles
and, a few years ago, would have beaten the likes of Nalbandian
left-handed, might as well have been under a suicide watch at his
home in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Were Nalbandian to have shown any flashes of anything, a la Boris
Becker in the mid-1980s when he crashed Wimbledon's party, tennis
could point to a budding star. But Nalbandian has quickly followed
his Wimbledon stunner with a series of early round losses in Europe.
It's not his fault that his sport is so lousy at the moment that he
got to the Wimbledon final.</TE>
<TE>   So attractive was that Hewitt-Nalbandian final that it was soundly
beaten in the TV ratings by the women's doubles final, featuring, of
course, Venus and Serena Williams.</TE>
<TE>   If Gertrude Stein were a tennis fan, she would sum up the state of
the men's game quite easily: There's no there there.</TE>
<TE>   It is currently a sport of baseline bangers, devoid of drama and
purged of personality. It is a tour of young, nice-looking athletes
who mostly handle their nomadic existence like robots and exude the
same kind of charisma. If R2D2 would take up the game, he'd fit right
in. Plus, he might be a better interview.</TE>
<TE>   Sampras, whose attraction is in the artistry of his game and his
successful pursuit of history, and Andre Agassi, as bright with his
quotemaking as with his shotmaking, are still around. But they have
been needed to carry this load on their backs too long.</TE>
<TE>   Their skills are still superb and their chances of winning a bit
more are still decent. But they should have been knocked off the
marquee long ago.</TE>
<TE>   Where is the personality in men's tennis? Where are the story
lines? Where are the players who sell tickets as much by the way they
carry themselves as by the number of matches they win? Where have you
gone Boris Becker and Patrick Rafter?</TE>
<TE>   This isn't an American gap, it's a sportwide chasm.</TE>
<TE>   How many years can men's tennis go with a Wimbledon final between
two guys who, playing on grass, only go to the net to check its
height? How long can men's tennis market itself with a No. 1 player,
Hewitt, who has the game and persona of a washing machine.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, men's tennis is doing more than any other single entity
to boost the ratings of the Golf Channel.</TE>
<TE>   Know what the main topic around tennis clubs is these nights when
the men sit around after their ladder doubles play? The Williams
sisters. Know who the biggest star, the most talked-about male at
Wimbledon was this year? John McEnroe, who never even took his racket
out.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Kramer and his son, Bobby, have been running the Los Angeles
event for years, and running it well. It is a tournament that started
at the old L.A. Tennis Club in 1927 and has the tradition of
legendary winners the likes of Bill Tilden, Pancho Gonzalez, Rod
Laver, Ellsworth Vines, Bobby Riggs, Don Budge, Jimmy Connors, Arthur
Ashe and Sampras and Agassi.</TE>
<TE>   The Kramers deserve more of the same. So does the tennis fan.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, they have to hope that Agassi has a great event, or
that Sampras decides to take a wild card and make the long drive from
Beverly Hills. They have to hope that the long-awaited emergence of
Andy Roddick actually begins, or that Michael Chang gulps from the
fountain of youth. Barring all else, they have to hope Jan-Michael
Gambill takes off his shirt a lot.</TE>
<TE>   Here's hoping that the summer of 2002 is the one that somebody
emerges, that a men's tennis star is born. Here's hoping that Xavier
Malisse becomes Mats Wilander or Tommy Haas becomes Ivan Lendl.
Here's hoping the surgeons put a bionic serving arm on Goran
Ivanisevic.</TE>
<TE>   Here's hoping the Williams sisters take mercy on the men's tour
and take some time off this summer.</TE>

<HD>This Return May Be Haas' Toughest Yet</HD>
<DH>Tennis: German pro, off the tour since parents were injured
in June 8 motorcycle accident, is set to rejoin circuit at UCLA this
week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whether they represent an important career transition or the long
recovery from a trying period in his personal life, the time, July,
and the place, Los Angeles, have become significant markers for Tommy
Haas.</LD>
<LD>   He is rejoining the men's tennis tour for the first time since the
French Open, having been with his parents, Peter and Brigitte, who
were involved in a serious motorcycle accident in Sarasota, Fla., on
June 8. Peter had been in a coma for 2 1/2 weeks and nearly lost his
right leg. Brigitte's injuries were not life-threatening, but she has
been incapacitated after a truck collided with the Harley-Davidson
they were riding.</LD>
<LD>   They recovered enough to be moved to a rehabilitation center in
Germany, and are improving enough for Haas to feel comfortable making
his return to the circuit in the Mercedes-Benz Cup at UCLA, which
starts Monday.</LD>
<TE>   His parents' accident has put life and sports into perspective for
the 24-year-old Haas, whose powerful baseline game had taken him to a
career-high No. 2 world ranking in the spring, when he lost in the
Italian Open final to Andre Agassi.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, he nearly made his first Grand Slam final,
falling to Marat Safin in five sets in the semifinals of the
Australian Open when Safin revived after a rain delay.</TE>
<TE>   "You really start thinking about other things again," Haas said
Friday in a telephone interview from Germany. "Obviously, tennis was
always my No. 1 priority and it will be again someday. But when
something like this happens, something really unexpected, it's your
parents. You only have one set of parents."</TE>
<TE>   His father was the one who started Tommy playing at age 4. Peter
Haas grew up in Austria, was once a European judo champion and is a
former classmate of Arnold Schwarzenegger. The doctors told Tommy
Haas that his father's high level of fitness probably helped save his
right leg.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a little bit of a brain injury," Haas said, "so his memory
is not really good at the moment. But he can talk a little bit.
Sometimes he's back to normal, then he gets tired again and he's
pretty far off from reality. They say that's normal.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a pretty good chance to come back to where he left off.
But nobody really knows that.... It's going to be a long process. The
doctors here are saying he has a good chance to be walking again."</TE>
<TE>   Haas was gratified by the support he received from the tennis
world. The ATP and WTA tours sent flowers, as did many of his fellow
pros. Schwarzenegger called several times as well.</TE>
<TE>   Haas had heard stories about his father and Arnold when they were
youngsters in Austria.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great to see how he's progressed in his life and what he's
accomplished," Haas said of Schwarzenegger. "I got to meet him at the
Planet Hollywood opening in Munich in '98. Since then I've talked to
him on the phone a couple of times. For some reason, if you just know
there's a celebrity on the other phone you always start getting
nervous. It's quite funny. You don't know what to say."</TE>
<TE>   He's gotten over that nervousness and can chuckle about their
conversations.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got this Austrian accent which is quite funny and every time
we do talk on the phone, it's this English, German, Austrian mix,"
Haas said. "He was really nice and supportive with what happened to
my parents. He called three or five times. He's a person who has a
good heart."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the action star surprised Haas by showing up to watch
him play in the UCLA tournament, where he reached the quarterfinals,
losing to Gustavo Kuerten. Los Angeles was also where Haas reunited
with his former coach, David "Red" Ayme, last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I changed coaches because every player in every sport--you have
agents, you have family members, you have other coaches, always
talking in your back. If you didn't have a couple of good weeks, or a
couple of good months, they always try to blame [someone]," Haas
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Another reason is to see what else is out there, if another coach
could help me or give me something that I might be missing. They were
all good coaches but not right for me. I feel like Red knows me like
no other coach does. There's a good chemistry between us.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not very easy to understand sometimes, and he seems to
understand those situations. He always seems to have the right
answer."</TE>
<TE>   The renewed partnership showed immediate results. Haas reached the
semifinals in Montreal last summer, defeated Pete Sampras to win Long
Island, took eventual champion Lleyton Hewitt to four sets in the
fourth round of the U.S. Open and won consecutive titles in the fall
at Vienna and Stuttgart, Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Later on, Haas said he will look back on those previous successes,
as well as his rise to No. 2 in the world this spring. (Haas is
currently No. 3).</TE>
<TE>   More importantly, there will be something else to treasure in the
Haas house when his parents return home.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure at the end of the year when everything is back in
perspective, and the year is over, and I've got a couple of weeks and
my parents are back on their feet, we're going to probably celebrate
and enjoy the time again," Haas said.</TE>

<HD>Armstrong Holds Steady</HD>
<DH>Cycling: Favorite paces himself on a warm day and maintains
his lead, enhancing his chances for fourth straight title.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BEZIERS, France</DL>
<LD>Only the hot weather made Lance Armstrong sweat during the 13th stage
of the Tour de France.</LD>
<LD>   Saving energy for the race's grueling final week, the Texan was
the 30th rider across the finish line in Saturday's leg, nearly 10
minutes behind winner David Millar of Britain.</LD>
<LD>   But Armstrong made sure his closest pursuers for the title didn't
gain any time on him. He kept his overall lead of nearly 2 1/2
minutes and remained on course for a fourth consecutive title when
the Tour ends in Paris next Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   "It was very hot," was all Armstrong had to say about the stretch
from the foot of the Pyrenees to Beziers, near the Mediterranean,
where temperatures topped 85.</TE>
<TE>   Millar covered the mostly flat route of 106 miles in 4 hours 8
minutes 18 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong crossed the finish line with the main pack, 9:56 off the
pace. In the overall rankings, he's still 2:28 ahead of Spain's
Joseba Beloki, thanks to victories in the opening two mountain stages
in the Pyrenees.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike last year, when the Tour ended with nearly a week of flat
stretches, this year's race saves some of the hardest climbing for
last.</TE>
<TE>   Today's 137.3-mile 14th stage ends with a daunting ascent up Mont
Ventoux, which rises to 6,273 feet from flat surrounding countryside.</TE>
<TE>   After Monday's rest day, the riders head into the Alps on Tuesday,
and Wednesday's 16th leg from Les Deux Alpes to La Plagne is probably
the most difficult of the three-week Tour.</TE>
<TE>   It features three exceptionally tough climbs, which should help
Armstrong extend his lead over Beloki. It is followed by another
mountain stage, albeit a much easier one, on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers designed this year's Tour to ensure a more suspenseful
last week, but if Armstrong continues to dominate, the race outcome
will likely be known long before the finish on the Champs-Elysees.</TE>
<TE>   Millar's stage win was his second in the Tour. He beat Armstrong
by two seconds to win the prologue in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   His training for this year's race was delayed several months by
illness.</TE>
<TE>   "When I found out I had glandular fever in January, February, I
thought my season was over," Millar said. "But the team encouraged me
to get fit again."</TE>
<TE>   He said it might be a few more years before he really makes his
mark on the Tour: "I'm waiting for Armstrong to retire."</TE>
<TE>   Millar came in just ahead of David Etxebarria of Spain and Michael
Boogerd of the Netherlands, who both were credited with the same time
as Millar.</TE>
<TE>   Millar fell in the prologue of last year's Tour and finished the
leg in 110th place.</TE>
<TE>   He was fifth in this year's prologue and now stands 59th in the
overall standings.</TE>
<TE>   The leg was quieter than Friday's, when some cyclists were
disciplined. Jacky Durand of France was thrown out of the Tour for
holding onto a car during a difficult climb. His countryman
Christophe Moreau punched Carlos Sastre of Spain after Sastre's bike
pushed against his.</TE>
<TE>   Sastre retaliated by yanking Moreau's jersey. Moreau drew a
two-minute penalty, Sastre a 20-second penalty.</TE>

<TE>   At a Glance</TE>
<TE>   Stage: 106 miles from Lavelanet to Beziers, near the
Mediterranean.</TE>
<TE>   Winner: David Millar of Britain, in 4 hours 8 minutes 18 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   How Others Fared: Three-time champion Lance Armstrong retained the
overall lead despite finishing the stage in 30th place, 9:56 behind
Millar. Armstrong leads second-place Joseba Beloki by 2:28 in the
overall standings.</TE>
<TE>   Quote of the Day: "I'm waiting for Armstrong to retire."--Millar
on why he has yet to make a mark on the Tour.</TE>
<TE>   Next Stage: Today's 14th stage is 137.3 miles from Lodeve to the
top of Mont Ventoux, one of the hardest climbs in France.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: The Big Apple smelled like citrus when Pasadena
reader Lori Latta walked up Fifth Avenue one day in May. At
Rockefeller Center she found the source: an art installation of
fragrant oranges, lemons, limes and grapefruits. Gardeners--up to 20
people at times--drilled holes in the fruit and impaled it on
conduit, replacing pieces as needed during the two-week display.
Fountains in the promenade--drained because of New York's water
shortage--were fitted with platforms and topped with waves of yellow
and orange. "It smelled like I was in the middle of a juicing
operation," says Latta, who happens to be the flower and produce
buyer for 130 West Coast Trader Joe's stores.</CP>
