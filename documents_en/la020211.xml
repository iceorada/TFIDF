<LD>Children in the county's gargantuan foster care maze won a victory
last week when a court ordered social workers to check in on them at
least once a month. But the 2,100 social workers who watch over the
53,000 kids under county supervision were never ultimately to blame
for the neglect some foster children suffer, and they alone can
hardly be expected to solve the problem. The same cannot be said of
the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors.</LD>
<LD>   The Alliance for Children's Rights, a public interest law firm,
filed suit two years ago to get the county's Department of Children
and Family Services to stop allowing social workers to skip monthly
visits to some foster care kids. The state regulations that require
monthly visits also provide grounds for granting exceptions or
waivers. Child welfare advocates had alleged that the department,
chronically short on funds and staff, too often made such exceptions
and as a result failed to closely monitor all the neglected and
abused kids in its care. In some cases, six months passed between
visits. For a child, especially a child with developmental delays or
emotional problems, six months is a lifetime.</LD>
<TE>   Last week, an appellate panel found that the agency granted too
many exceptions to the monthly visit rule, apparently for the
convenience of overloaded social workers. Now any social worker who
wants to skip regular visits must convince a judge that the best
interests of the child involved will remain protected.</TE>
<TE>   A trial court decided last year that the department misused its
discretion in granting exceptions. But the supervisors voted to
appeal and came up with the money to pay county lawyers--who at one
point offered to settle the case by preposterously suggesting that
children as young as 10 years old be allowed to surrender, in
writing, their right to a monthly visit.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday the board will consider a motion by Supervisors Zev
Yaroslavsky and Michael Antonovich ordering county lawyers to drop
the case and the department to comply with the ruling. Easier said
than done. The number of kids in foster care has dipped in recent
months, but social workers complain that the amount of work each case
requires--the visits, conferences, phone calls and documentation--is
up. Some have staged sickouts and other job actions.</TE>
<TE>   There's no doubt that the social workers need reinforcements fast,
and the supervisors should scramble to find money to hire them. In
the interim, however, the supervisors must not tolerate any action by
an employee that puts these children, the most vulnerable among us,
at risk. In fact, they need to keep a much closer eye on the
Department of Children and Family Services in every respect. Court
orders, no matter how forcefully written, won't solve the problems in
this troubled but vital department.</TE>

<LD>Congress has a chance Tuesday to heal some of the corruption and
cynicism that have overtaken American politics. Proponents of the
Shays-Meehan campaign finance bill who saw it stymied last summer
have forced it back onto the House agenda. Although opponents are
preparing every possible sneaky trick to defeat it, with vigilance
the measure can pass intact.</LD>
<LD>   Amid the Enron scandal, the pressure from ordinary citizens to
limit corporate influence on politics has never been greater. But
even the Enron case hasn't budged House Republican leaders, because
they believe that raising hundreds of millions in "soft money" is the
key to defeating Democrats. House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of
Illinois is talking about the bill as "Armageddon." Terrified that
corporate donations will be drastically curtailed, Hastert and his
deputies, with the silent assent of at least a few Democrats, are
staging a frantic last-ditch effort to kill reform.</LD>
<TE>   Hastert and company are contemplating a variety of maneuvers to
derail the bill. The most obvious would be to bring up a substitute
bill offered by Robert W. Ney (R-Ohio) and Albert Russell Wynn
(D-Md.) that would allow unlimited contributions of unregulated soft
money to state party organizations. But the more likely tactic would
be to offer "poison pill" amendments so that even backers of campaign
finance reform would recoil and agree to send the measure to a
conference committee. There, it could be argued to death. One
possibility is a clause saying that if a court ruled any part of the
bill illegal, no matter how minor, the legislation would be voided
entirely. Another could be to bar legal permanent residents from
making contributions--the Hispanic Caucus would reject such a
provision. Other amendments would simply soften the ban against soft
money.</TE>
<TE>   But banned it must be. The example of Enron, which showered
millions on Democrats and Republicans, should be enough. And there is
plenty more. A study by New York University's Brennan Center for
Justice, which examined 3,500 political ads, shows how bogus the
arguments against reform are. Take the claim that soft money is
essential to creating grass-roots voter activity that strengthens
parties. The study concludes that this is a pious myth: A large share
of soft money went to ads that attacked specific candidates, without
ever even naming a political party.</TE>
<TE>   Real campaign reform has never been so tantalizingly close. The
Democrats and Republicans who signed on to reform at the last minute
should not falter. If they close ranks, the bill can be sent directly
to the Senate, which passed its own version of the bill last year.
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota has indicated he
will push the final version through as quickly as possible.</TE>
<TE>   The American campaign finance system is a blot on democracy.
Congress this week could mop up the worst of it.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Angelenos are so familiar with and tired of the same old cliches
about Southern California--how we're so concerned with clothing and
personal appearance, how we spend so much money on and time in our
automobiles, how we live a sunny, provincial lifestyle, spending tons
of dollars on clothing and housing and clothing. Everyone knows
stereotypes are superficial. They're also handy when you have little
space to describe Los Angeles, San Francisco or other foreign
cultures. Trouble is, as a new Bureau of Labor Statistics survey
shows, stereotypes are often based on elements of truth. That's why
we chuckle.</LD>
<LD>   Take San Francisco. Please. If life is so great in the fog, why is
the big entertainment up there watching grapes grow? San
Francisco-area residents, according to the new consumer spending
survey, drown their regional misery in $771 per year of alcoholic
beverages. That's twice the $345 national average and the $337 in
L.A., where everyone must carry his or her own water bottle.
Angelenos are very busy spending $16,550 yearly on housing, a third
above the national average. Not that it costs more to build houses
without basements, but 16 million residents compete here for shelter,
despite the cafes, palms and beaches.</LD>
<TE>   The average L.A. household spends $2,450 on clothing, 35% more
than nationally. Not that wearing skimpier clothing costs more, but
not wearing the same Bolshevik overcoat for six months does require a
more diverse wardrobe if you're going to look mighty fine on TV or
avoid being ignored. And without an NFL team, what's the point of
parkas? Like we really want to look like Chicagoans anyway, leaning
into the winter winds. And what earthquake would bother with Detroit?
Plus Los Angeles saves on firewood expenses. Oh, and windshield
scrapers.</TE>
<TE>   Or take automobiles, which Los Angeles-area residents do a lot.
Our households spend on average $7,701 annually to keep our vehicles
on the road, not necessarily moving, mind you, but on the road. The
national average is only $7,215, but in other locales they don't get
SigAlerts and little lighted freeway signs  with four-word warnings
of imminent doom ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of entertainment, Angelenos spend less on it than San
Francisco residents, even with the grapes, but more than San Diego
and Portland, wherever they are. Angelenos also spend less on tobacco
but give more to charity. How is that provincial?</TE>
<TE>   Now, about those Starbucks-sipping, salmon-eating,
online-book-ordering nerds in rain-soaked Seattle....</TE>

<LD>Re "No Oases for Saudi Youths," Feb. 7: The problem is very clear. As
long as the clergy is in power, Saudi Arabia and other Muslim
countries will not progress out of the 12th century into the 21st
century. If Muslim countries want to progress, then they need to stop
blaming Western society for their plight and see what in their
society is wrong--and right it. What makes the West progress? We have
separation of church and state. Women have a certain degree of
independence. Our young people are not ashamed to work in menial
jobs. No job is lowly and all have dignity.</LD>
<LD>   My suggestion to the Muslim young people: The future of your
country is yours. Hating Americans for their lifestyle or culture is
ridiculous. We have nothing to do with the morality police or the
Muslim extremists who keep you centuries behind the rest of the
industrialized nations.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your article on disgruntled Saudi youth provokes more questions
than it answers. For instance, it's not difficult to understand why
they have a problem with the stifling, repressive social policies of
their country. But how is this the fault of the United States? We
don't write their laws for them.</TE>
<TE>   How do they connect the oppressive morality police of their land
with cheering for the terrorist attacks on America? It's not hard to
understand why they are demoralized by decreased economic opportunity
in their country. But how is this the fault of the U.S.?</TE>
<TE>   If we didn't buy so much of the oil they are selling, how much
scarcer would good jobs be in their desert kingdom? We may be a
global power, but we are not responsible for how all the countries of
the world run themselves. We're damned if we do and damned if we
don't. If we're too proactive in guiding these countries, we're
evidencing our boundless arrogance and interfering inappropriately.</TE>
<TE>   Or if we give them credit for being able to run their own
countries, then our arrogance in not caring about bringing them
liberty is infuriating. It's time some of these hot-headed countries
blamed themselves for the state of their unions, not the U.S.</TE>

<LD>Re "Agriculture Education Withering," Feb. 4: Canoga Park High School
agriculture teacher Carrie Robertson states: "People need to
understand that the strength of any society is the ability to feed
itself." These words should be framed and hung in the office of every
California developer, construction company, real estate agent,
elected official, school and public building. And in the kitchen of
every resident, farmer and nonfarmer alike.</LD>
<LD>   If we've been complacent about our great Central Valley shrinking
from farmland to housing tracts, let's wake up. If L.A. Unified has
only slivers of land left for agriculture education, find a way to
keep them. Her students are learning solid life lessons that they in
turn will teach by example. Classes like Robertson's are priceless.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Why is Amos Oz so mystified as to what happened to the Israeli peace
camp ("Put the Extremist Goals to Rest," Commentary, Feb. 7)? It's
obvious. It got bombed into oblivion.</LD>
<LD>   The Israeli majority that endorsed the Oslo land-for-peace accords
under the Rabin/Peres government was shellshocked when the return of
six major Palestinian cities was not met with peace but with a spate
of suicide bombings and scores of dead Jews. A terrorized electorate
voted out Shimon Peres and voted in the hard-line Benjamin Netanyahu.
After a short time, the peace-seeking majority once again decided to
give Yasser Arafat a try and voted in Ehud Barak and his peace
platform. His groundbreaking (though far from perfect) proposal was
met not with a counterproposal but with a pre-planned violence
campaign and more terrorist bombings aimed at Jewish civilians; in
particular, Jewish youth. Once again, a terrorized Israeli electorate
turned right and voted in Ariel Sharon.</LD>
<LD>   Arafat and the Palestinians have no one to blame but themselves
for the rise of Sharon and the demise of the Israeli peace camp.</LD>
<TE>   Joseph Gold</TE>
<TE>   Torrance</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After reading Oz's commentary, one gets the impression that the
existence of a "dangerous equivalent" extremist attitude on the
Israeli side (i.e., a greater Israel) is a recent development
provoked by Arab terrorism. Unfortunately, nothing could be further
from the truth.</TE>
<TE>   In 1977, when Anwar Sadat came to Jerusalem, he offered the
two-state solution to then-Prime Minister Menachem Begin. The offer
was soundly rejected. Instead, an extensive Jewish settlement program
was undertaken in the West Bank, which continues to this day. Later,
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir bitterly criticized
then-President Bush for refusing to underwrite loan guarantees to

<LD>In "A Dead-End Movement Hits the Wall" (Opinion, Feb. 3), Gene
Lichtenstein refers to me, not by name but by position, as regional
chairman of Americans for a Safe Israel in 1994. He claims that I
called Baruch Goldstein, the gunman in the massacre of 29 Arabs, "a
hero and a Jewish martyr."</LD>
<LD>   Lichtenstein is way off base in his claim. Although, prior to that
incident, based on personal acquaintance, I had a high opinion of
Goldstein as a dedicated doctor and a devoutly religious and deeply
spiritual person, I could not in good conscience call him a
hero--certainly not before the hearings conducted by Israel's
Commission of Inquiry. But, of course, neither could I condemn him
before all the facts were in.</LD>
<LD>   Lichtenstein also singles out AFSI among Jewish groups, branding
it as "far right." It should be pointed out that AFSI's dominant
concern since the Oslo peace process was initiated in 1993 has been
that Israel not relinquish any of its land--for biblical, historical,
legal, moral and security reasons. Now that the vast majority of
world Jewry, including most of the so-called left, has adopted AFSI's
position, then either we are all far right--and if so, so be it--or
perhaps Lichtenstein is far left.</LD>

<LD>Re "Haunted by Memories of Munich '72," Feb. 8: To believe the
statement by Toni Khoury of the IOC executive board that to "honor
the slain Israelis at the ceremony would be an unwelcome political
intrusion" is to believe that the killing of all of the Israeli
athletes was a "political" act. It was not. It was a criminal act. To
treat it otherwise is to encourage and condone terrorist behavior.</LD>
<LD>   It is the world's (and thus the IOC's) duty to treat victims of
terrorist acts as heroes and not worry about the countries that house
the terrorists who perform such criminal acts.</LD>

<LD>In "The Highway Robbery of Your Life" (Commentary, Feb. 6), John
Balzar points out that each of us needlessly burns about $1,000 in
gas a year stuck in traffic. I wonder what that amount would rise to
if it included all the times people leave their cars idling while
they are waiting to pick someone up, or just running inside to pick
up a forgotten item, or chatting to someone in the parking lot, or
waiting for someone to pull out of a desirable parking spot--and add
to that the idling of all the people held up waiting for the person
who's waiting for the spot.</LD>
<LD>   Examples of getting zero miles to the gallon are endless. Worse
still is the fact that emissions are the worst in idle.</LD>

<TE>   It's a good idea to fix our roads, but the real problem with
congestion on our freeways is the absence of decent, comfortable
alternatives, especially on the heavily traveled corridors within
California, such as Sacramento/San Francisco/L.A./San Diego. Travel
between these cities by car is an assault on the central nervous
system. But if you think plane travel is a more benign experience,
think again.</TE>
<TE>   If you take a flight, say, from LAX to San Francisco that leaves
at 10 a.m., you have to be at the airport by 8 a.m., which means you
get on the road at 6 a.m.--if you're coming from the West Valley. If
the flight leaves and arrives on time (don't bet on it), and your
luggage has not been sent to Ft. Lauderdale, you are out of the
terminal and in the city by 1 p.m. That's six hours on the road for a
one-hour flight. And consider the flight itself: seats that fit like
a tourniquet; food that is unrecognizable, inedible and indigestible.</TE>
<TE>   If one good thing comes out of Sept. 11, it should be rapid rail
travel. If I could avoid getting in my car or on a plane, I'd do it
in a heartbeat.</TE>

<HD>Students Benefit From Smaller Class Size</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Contrary to "Role of Class Size in Success Unclear" (Feb. 5),
reducing class sizes in the earliest grades is a proven reform that
benefits children of all backgrounds, especially poor, minority,
inner-city and rural children. Every parent and teacher knows that
students' needs are better met in a class of 20 than a class of 30.
It just makes common sense. And it is supported by comprehensive
studies.</LD>
<LD>   The Tennessee Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio project, launched
in 1985, tracked some 6,500 students in 79 schools since
kindergarten. It found that children who attended grades K-3 in
classes with 13 to 17 pupils did significantly better on tests than
children in classes with the average 22 to 25 pupils. Five years
later, STAR found that these students continued to outperform others
in reading, math and science, even though they'd moved to larger
classes. By eighth grade, kids who had attended the smaller classes
in K-3 were at least one full year ahead of their peers academically.</LD>
<LD>   In a follow-up study released March 2001, Princeton researcher
Alan Krueger found that smaller class sizes can help erase the
minority achievement gap. Alex Molnar of Arizona State University
released data just last month finding that a similar program in
Wisconsin continues to increase achievement among poor students.</LD>

<LD>A landscaping contractor was found guilty of paying his workers only
$8 to $12 per hour for the maintenance of highway interchanges by
having them kick back more than half of their wages (Feb. 7). The
state's prevailing contract wage for this menial work was $24 to $29
per hour. It seems to me the Department of Transportation, which set
the hourly wages of $24 to $29 per hour for raking leaves, etc., is
the culprit. But heck, why should the state care if the job is really
worth $8 to $12 per hour; it's only taxpayers' money.</LD>

<HD>Koizumi Spirals Down</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRANK GIBNEY</AU>
<BD>Frank Gibney is president of the Pacific Basin
Institute at Pomona College and a professor of politics.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi stumbled badly when he
suddenly dumped his close ally, Makiko Tanaka, from the foreign
minister's job in late January.</LD>
<LD>   Within a week, Koizumi's rating dropped from the 70% range to an
anemic 40%-plus in some polls. A storm of press criticism attacked
his tactics in the firing.</LD>
<LD>   On every front, the "Koizumi spiral," as an opposition party
characterized it, continues to go down. Once-tolerant critics grow
increasingly impatient, and there are even predictions that his
Cabinet will fall. Unless he returns to his original reform policy,
his days in office may be numbered.</LD>
<TE>   Tanaka, the blunt-spoken daughter of a former prime minister and
the country's most popular vote-getter, had not been a great success
at a job that calls for at least a modicum of finesse. But she had
tried to take a strong hand in curbing the power of an arrogant but
inefficient bureaucracy mired in scandals. In so doing, Tanaka drew
considerable public support. But she ran afoul of ministry
bureaucrats and their behind-the-scenes boss, veteran parliament
member Muneo Suzuki.</TE>
<TE>   To understand what happened and why, one needs a little
indoctrination into the murky workings of Japan's one-party
government. That would help explain the 10-year stagnation of what
was once the world's most burgeoning economy.</TE>
<TE>   During the half-century of Liberal Democratic Party rule--broken
only for a year in 1993 by an insurgent minority Cabinet--the party's
hierarchy has made common cause with leaders of the once-independent
bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the parliament are divided into groups of zokugiin, a
term that is best translated as "special interest representatives."
Their constituencies include construction, banking, farming,
government-owned corporations, small business, even foreign
relations.</TE>
<TE>   These representatives work with businessmen and bureaucrats to
safeguard each of their special areas. There are few outside
lobbyists in Japan because the parliament members themselves are
lobbyists par excellence.</TE>
<TE>   Koizumi won the prime ministership on a reform platform after his
seven predecessors in 10 years had done nothing to correct the
stalled economy.</TE>
<TE>   His program was simple but sweeping: Cut wasteful public works
spending, deregulate the web of outmoded government "guidance," stop
propping up losing industries and debt-drowned banks, clip the wings
of special interest members of parliament and protected bureaucrats.</TE>
<TE>   The public responded to his message by reelecting his party with a
strong majority. Once in power, however, the party's elected
lobbyists went back to their old ways, each gang defending its own
turf.</TE>
<TE>   One by one, Koizumi initiatives were blocked or watered down by
special interest votes of party factions, a practice that Tanaka had
loudly denounced.</TE>
<TE>   Koizumi's reason for firing Tanaka was that her latest argument
with ministry bureaucrats and Suzuki was holding up passage of the
budget bill. He made no attempt to evaluate who was right or wrong.
His lack of clear decision-making, coming after so many failed
efforts at reform, was enough to exasperate a good portion of the
public.</TE>
<TE>   There is no mystery about the causes of Japan's 10-year recession.
In a new world of globalized finance, information technology and
international economic competition, the old mix of government
guidance, built-in protectionism and indiscriminate bank financing
had become hopelessly outdated and counterproductive.</TE>
<TE>   Economists and big business leaders have agreed that far-reaching
structural reform is needed to reinvent a healthy free-enterprise
economy in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   But the party's parliament lobbyists refuse to accept the
temporary bankruptcies and job losses that come with any major
long-term reform.</TE>
<TE>   Stopgap government pump-priming--the Liberal Democrats' only
tactic--has repeatedly failed. Understandably disillusioned, the
public lost confidence and stopped consuming.</TE>
<TE>   There are businessmen and economists aplenty who know what should
be done. So does the prime minister. The real problem is political.
Until Koizumi starts controlling the party bosses (or goes to the
public with a new multi-party lineup), the economic reforms that
Japan needs will remain an empty promise.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese voters are tumbling to this fact, which explains the
angry phone calls and Koizumi's slipping poll numbers following
Tanaka's dismissal.</TE>

<HD>Parks Hasn't Done Job No. 1: Reform the LAPD's Culture</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CONSTANCE L. RICE</AU>
<BD>Constance L. Rice is a civil rights lawyer.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When former LAPD Chief Daryl Gates received the Christopher
Commission report, he reportedly threw it in the nearest trash can.
The question is whether anyone at the Los Angeles Police Department
ever took it out.</LD>
<LD>   To be clear: Today's LAPD is not Gates' organization. The LAPD has
advanced significantly.</LD>
<LD>   However, the department is as close to claiming the Christopher
Commission mandate to end its insular, retaliatory, paramilitary
policing culture as Mullah Omar is to embracing feminism. When
confronted with the full Christopher agenda, the LAPD just said no.</LD>
<TE>   Ten years later, the department faces federal supervision, yet
another brewing gangster-cop scandal and the unmet Christopher
Commission challenge. It also is facing a controversy over the
reappointment of its chief.</TE>
<TE>   Bone-level reforms are needed here, not the skin-level changes of
improved complaint procedures, better public relations, computer
tracking, senior lead officers and flextime.</TE>
<TE>   The hard-core basics needed to end the LAPD's bunker culture
require:</TE>
<TE>   * Civilian control. As recently as 1999, LAPD Chief Bernard C.
Parks had to be officially reminded that the department is subject to
civilian control and the rule of law.</TE>
<TE>   * Systemic solutions. The Christopher Commission concluded that
the LAPD's problems are systemic, cultural and entrenched. LAPD brass
concluded that the Rampart Division gangster-cop scandal was an
aberrant "incident."</TE>
<TE>   * Eliminating the code of silence. The Christopher Commission
concluded that this code was the foremost barrier to ending the
abusive attributes of the LAPD's culture. The department denies that
there even is a code of silence.</TE>
<TE>   * Perform a cultural transplant. Former Assistant Chief David
Dotson puts this one best: "The problems at the LAPD's Rampart
Division are cultural in nature, the result of an institutional
mind-set first conceived in the 1950s.... Unless this police culture
is overthrown, future Rampart scandals are inevitable."</TE>
<TE>   * An overhaul of internal affairs. The LAPD's self-policing
apparatus continues to shred whistle-blowers and shield cowboys.
Frank Serpico would be just as endangered in Los Angeles as he was in
New York.</TE>
<TE>   When Armando Coronado, a decorated LAPD veteran, blew the whistle
on gangster cops Rafael Perez and Nino Durden in 1997, LAPD's
Internal Affairs Department turned not on the rogues but on Coronado.
It destroyed his career.</TE>
<TE>   When another honest cop also tried to challenge the dynamic duo,
Internal Affairs again turned on the clean, whistle-blowing veteran.
Both times, Internal Affairs enabled the outlaws.</TE>
<TE>   As long as the Los Angeles Police Department continues to
submarine the Serpicos and celebrate the Dirty Harrys, how can anyone
claim that police reform has even started?</TE>
<TE>   * An end to information stonewalling and the
"outsiders-are-the-enemy" mentality. Outsiders still have to mount
the Battle of Gettysburg to get useful information out of this
department. How is it possible that in 2002, the district attorney
had no clue that 60 additional Rampart investigations were in the
pipeline?</TE>
<TE>   As a former LAPD interim chief explains it, "It's us against the
world. We see ourselves as the last bastion of good people in a world
that's crumbling."</TE>
<TE>   The Christopher Commission tagged this G. Gordon Liddy aspect of
LAPD culture as a major driver of community problems.</TE>
<TE>   * Accepting the fact that the LAPD cannot reform itself. The
Police Department still insists that it can reform itself, despite 40
years of failed efforts, two riots sparked by department misconduct
and a devastating gangster-cop crisis that raged unchecked for years
and was eventually stopped not by the LAPD but by a plea-bargained
confession.</TE>
<TE>   * Cooperate with the inspector general. Chief Parks and the LAPD
deep-sixed the first inspector general; they barely tolerate the
presence of the second.</TE>
<TE>   Today's heated discussions should center on the Christopher
Commission mandate and these critical reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, politics have hijacked the agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Sparked by Mayor James K. Hahn's rejection of the city's black
chief of police and a divisive campaign by the Los Angeles Police
Protective League, the fog of this war blocks the reform issue, and
this latest battle crackles with misfires over race, power and
political betrayal.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Parks' reappointment should be assessed on the realization
of the full Christopher Commission mandate and on his approach to
fighting crime--not on the level of racial comfort he inspires or
personal relationships or a tacit quid pro quo understanding between
the mayor and the city's black leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Neither should his reappointment rest on a grievance list from a
hostile union.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it's Bernard Parks or someone else, the next police chief
of Los Angeles will have to unconditionally accept and implement
bedrock reforms. This goes beyond appointing more senior lead
officers. The city needs a task force made up of a top group of LAPD
brass, patrol officers, experts, community members and other
"outsiders" to draft a transition/transformation blueprint for the
department.</TE>
<TE>   Then the city must get ratification by all those who have a stake
in the department.</TE>
<TE>   Absent these basic changes, community policing will remain a
slogan and the Los Angeles Police Department will continue to crush
the Coronados and celebrate the Durdens.</TE>
<TE>   And the mandate to reform will remain in Daryl Gates' trash can,
along with his copy of the Christopher Commission report.</TE>

<HD>Put a Psychiatrist in His Corner</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEN J. SALERIAN</AU>
<BD>Alen J. Salerian is medical director of the Washington
Psychiatric Center in Washington, D.C., and teaches at the George
Washington University School of Medicine.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Nevada State Athletic Commission delivered a stinging blow that
hurt Mike Tyson badly when it denied him a boxing license Jan. 29.</LD>
<LD>   Yet no one seems willing to extend a helping hand to rescue the
powerful fighter from the demons of the mind that pound him with
greater force than any opponent.</LD>
<LD>   For years, people have called Tyson crazy, out of control, a wild
man, even an animal. He's been fined, imprisoned, barred from the
ring and shunned. Yet in all of his glorious years of ear biting,
brawling, lawbreaking and serving time in prison, Tyson has never
once been forced to seek and finish psychiatric treatment.</LD>
<TE>   Tyson needs mandatory psychiatric care. And as a psychiatrist who
for 25 years has worked with terribly troubled people, I have
patiently waited for some sporting or legal authority to force Tyson
to get the help he so desperately needs.</TE>
<TE>   It seems, however, that there's a stigma attached to mental health
disorders that prevents the authorities from treating them like any
other health issue.</TE>
<TE>   I'm sure if Tyson were suffering from a concussion, the boxing
authorities would allow him to fight only after a medical expert
deemed him healthy. Why isn't the same help given to those with
mental health disorders?</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Tyson's race and educational background have influenced why
he hasn't been given help. How long would it take us to commit Andre
Agassi if he jumped across the net and bit the ear or thigh of
competitors like Pete Sampras or Lleyton Hewitt? Probably faster than
a three-minute round in the ring.</TE>
<TE>   I find it interesting that the same people who vilify Tyson for
his actions could not find enough praise for the courage and spirit
of professor John Nash for his triumph over his psychological demons,
as chronicled in the film and book "A Beautiful Mind." Nash was
violent and dangerous like Tyson, and got better only after treatment
was forced on him.</TE>
<TE>   It's sad that the United States is one of the few civilized
countries that consistently does not require treatment for severely
handicapped people.</TE>
<TE>   Our recent history is filled with brutally painful lessons of the
dark consequences of unrecognized psychiatric disorders. There's
evidence that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was psychologically
impaired by depression in 1944 when he let Stalin steal Eastern
Europe at Yalta, and that President Ronald Reagan's Alzheimer's
disease began while he was still at the White House.</TE>
<TE>   And what about the FBI's top counterintelligence officer, Robert
Hanssen, who sold our nuclear secrets to Russia? For 20 years,
Hanssen confessed his spying and his deep psychological problems to
his Catholic priest, but all he received was advice to pray.</TE>
<TE>   What kind of advice are we giving Tyson? I wonder how many people
have said to him: "Don't worry about the Nevada boxing license--there
are so many other states we haven't tried yet," instead of just
having him committed.</TE>
<TE>   It was less than four years ago that the Nevada commissioners
rejected another of Tyson's licensing bids, naming lack of continued
treatment for his erratic behavior as their main reason.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't particularly matter to me whether Tyson ever fights in
the ring again. But as a psychiatrist--and someone who wants to feel
safe with people like Tyson roaming the streets--it does matter to me
that he receives help, even if we have to force it on him.</TE>
<TE>   We don't have to accept Tyson's outrageous acts. For society's
sake, and for Tyson's own sake, we must open our eyes to the perils
of untreated mental disorders.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of continuing to attack this sick man, we need to help him
get well.</TE>

<HD>Ours Is Not to Wonder Why He Fumbled the Ball</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH WAMBAUGH</AU>
<BD>Joseph Wambaugh, a former LAPD detective, is the author
of 16 books, including "Fire Lover," the true story of Glendale arson
investigator John Orr, which will be published in May.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven."</LD>
<LD>   --Paradise Lost</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   So what in the hell took possession of Bernie Parks? Why did he
trade an enviable position of service for a reign of in-house terror?
How could anybody with his experience and brains have squandered the
goodwill of his troops as well as that of his civilian boss so
utterly? Don't look for the answer here. This is a job for Jungians,
Freudians or Dr. Laura.</TE>
<TE>   Everybody wanted to embrace Bernie Parks when Chief Willie
Williams' contract was bought back by remorseful politicians. But
with those new stars on his collar, Parks quickly demonstrated that
his term was going to be as autocratic as Richard III's. He was
rigid, aloof and defensive toward his staff, the L.A. Police
Protective League and certainly his troops. The bell tolled when,
early in his term, he announced that officer morale was not high on
his agenda. That did it.</TE>
<TE>   How many friends do we have who are willing to risk their lives
for us? Two? One? None, probably. But the emergency services are
staffed by people who must be willing to do it even if they risk and
lose. The job offers no monetary incentives for danger or excellence,
no golden parachutes, no stock options. But it requires massive
injections of morale. (Dictionary definition: "Emotional or mental
condition with respect to cheerfulness, confidence, zeal, etc.,
especially in the face of opposition, hardship, etc." What better
describes the lot of a cop?)</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD needs 1,000 officers right now. They are retiring ASAP
and quitting to accept positions at other police agencies where there
are compressed work schedules, a respect for community policing and
due process for the officers from their leader--all things that Parks
has fought against.</TE>
<TE>   In police work, morale is the coin of the realm. A leader who
cannot grasp that fundamental truth is doomed to fail.</TE>
<TE>   And Garbo-ing the media is an indication of a professional death
wish.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Jim Hahn is showing more integrity and courage than we have
come to expect from politicians. If he and 90% of the LAPD rank and
file are heeded, there will be a search for a new chief, and everyone
knows--but will not admit--that white Anglo male applicants need not
apply. It's a fact of life, but it has precedent. In New York and
other Eastern cities, there was a time when a non-Irish candidate for
chief would have had about as much chance as Custer's bugler.
Everyone had to "think shamrocks" when facing a promotion board. Jews
and Italians began talking with a brogue. It wasn't fair, but it was
the reality.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it is time for a Latino, or a woman of any ethnicity, to
be given those unspoken "bonus points" if the city fathers find
themselves searching for a chief.</TE>
<TE>   One example of LAPD talent is Cmdr. Dave Gascon. This 48-year-old
came to our country from Cuba at age 14, served three years in the
U.S. Army and graduated from college with a degree in history. He
joined the LAPD in 1978, attended law school and breezed through the
bar exam. He could be the first lawyer-chief since William H. Parker.</TE>
<TE>   Gascon anticipated the consent decree, and as commanding officer
of the Police Department's Training Group, he devised a course in
ethics, tactics, law and human relations, inviting the U.S.
attorney's office and human relations experts to participate. He
posted the Bill of Rights in training division classrooms, and when
he makes offhand comments about "this great country of ours,"
listeners get a lump in their throats because he knows the
difference. Talk about potential star power. If this guy didn't
exist, Hollywood would have invented him.</TE>
<TE>   One can only wish that a good man like Bernie Parks will take his
well-deserved pension and retire. He must be embarrassed by the race
card being played on his behalf because he knows that this is not a
racial issue. And one can only hope that the LAPD will not again have
to endure a demoralizing search for an "outsider" when there are such
great people within the ranks.</TE>
<TE>   So, in the Los Angeles of 2002, it might be prudent to look harder
for a Latino candidate. Their time has come.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of "thinking shamrocks," Mayor Hahn should "think salsa."</TE>

<LD>When Marcia Gay Harden, last year's Oscar winner for best supporting
actress, steps in front of the microphone Tuesday morning to announce
this year's Academy Award nominations, a lot more than studio
bragging rights will be riding on the outcome.</LD>
<LD>   Hollywood studios have spent millions on advertising to tout their
Oscar hopefuls to voting members of the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts &amp; Sciences, and it's a sure bet they will spend millions more
should their films be nominated.</LD>
<LD>   Handicapping the Oscars can be a difficult process, especially in
a year like this, when there are no clear-cut favorites, but in the
best picture race, many believe that the nominees could come from a
select group of critically acclaimed films that includes "A Beautiful
Mind," "Moulin Rouge," "Black Hawk Down," "In the Bedroom," "Gosford
Park" and "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring."</LD>
<TE>   "The two front-runners are 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'A
Beautiful Mind,'" said Anne Thompson, the West Coast editor of
Premiere magazine. "I think as of Tuesday morning, 'The Lord of the
Rings' is going to get an enormous number of nominations. I've been
talking to a lot of people in the academy, and they love this movie.
They applaud its vision, its artistry, its scope." One movie that
could surprise everyone Tuesday is "Shrek," she noted, should the
academy nominate the animated film in the best picture category.
"Shrek" and "Monsters, Inc." are already considered locks to become
two of the three nominees in the academy's new animation category.</TE>
<TE>   The third nominee is less certain, but one strong contender is
"Waking Life," Richard Linklater's dreamy, philosophical exploration
of various states of consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   The nominations will be broadcast from the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts &amp; Sciences' Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills at
5:38 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   All three network morning TV shows, CNN, E! Entertainment as well
as local TV stations, the BBC and Telecine in Brazil plan to cover
the nominations live.</TE>
<TE>   The Academy Awards will be handed out March 24 from the Oscars'
new home at the Kodak Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard.</TE>

<HD>'Guitar' Tour Hits L.A. Today</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A horde of guitar-wielding youths will be lining up on Sunset
Boulevard outside the Guitar Center in Hollywood today, but not
because of a sale on strings. They're hoping to hit the rock 'n' roll
equivalent of the lottery: a chance to join multimillion-selling band
Limp Bizkit.</LD>
<LD>   The group has been holding auditions around the country for a
guitarist to replace Wes Borland, who quit in October. Today's
session is the last on the 23-city "Put Your Guitar Where Your Mouth
Is" tour of Guitar Center stores, where hundreds and sometimes
thousands of would-be Bizkits have shown up with audition tapes and
guitars in hand, hoping they have the magic sound, look and
personality that will land them the lead-guitar chair.</LD>
<LD>   Musicians will "pre-audition" starting at about 10 a.m. for a
screening committee headed by Danny Wimmer, vice president of artists
and repertoire for Bizkit singer Fred Durst's Flawless Records label.
The lucky few who make the cut, typically fewer than 10 per city,
could find themselves jamming tonight for anywhere from 60 seconds to
10 minutes with Bizkit bassist Sam Rivers and drummer John Otto,
while Durst and DJ Lethal observe the riffing.</LD>
<TE>   There's no guarantee anyone will make it to the jam. When
auditions were held outside Boston last month, none of the aspirants
made it past the pre-audition. "I heard 10 guys that would have been
great for Pearl Jam," Wimmer told the Boston Globe, "but we're
looking for something original, someone to help take Limp Bizkit to
the next level." The same thing happened at the Buffalo, N.Y., tour
stop.</TE>
<TE>   And although Limp Bizkit has been accused of living in a man's,
man's, man's world with its testosterone-fueled music, Paul Reiter, a
publicist for one of the tour sponsors, says a female guitarist who
showed up at one East Coast tryout has made it to the band's short
list of candidates to replace Borland.</TE>

<HD>Orb's Paterson Comes Down to Earth in Engaging Show</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Though Dr. Alex Paterson has been called everything from genius to
eccentric by the electronic community, he has never earned such
descriptions as warm or inviting. One could even argue that since
1989, this member of the Orb has symbolized the idea of electronic
music as cold and detached.</LD>
<LD>   So when the seminal U.K. dance figure came into town Saturday for
a deejay set at the Knitting Factory, it was difficult to know what
to expect. Would he play the kind of spacey, expansive ambient
sounds--hardly dance music, really--that he has produced with the
Orb? Or would he show a different side?</LD>
<LD>   Paterson started his set a little after midnight with Orb sounds,
but his two-hour stint definitely showed an unexpected side. It
wasn't so much the all-over-the map musical selections--which ranged
from a metallic synth version of the Smiths' "There Is a Light" to a
sample of Paterson's own hit, "Little Fluffy Clouds" and included
house, dancehall and pure techno in between--as it was how animated
Paterson was on stage.</LD>
<TE>   Dancing, jumping, smiling and waving his arms, Paterson was
downright engaging. And as he settled into a groove roughly 40
minutes in, he even became a bit playful with the audience, egging on
the dancing fans with his motions. Also unexpected was how
technically adept he was. True, Paterson has been performing as a
deejay since the late '80s, but since most associate him with his own
productions, his slick transitions and well-developed style were a
bonus in a night full of pleasant surprises.</TE>

<HD>Face It: Sex Sells TV News Too</HD>
<DH>Greta Van Susteren joins Geraldo Rivera and a host of
others in the nip-and- tuck world of plastic surgery and ratings
races.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID BAUDER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>You've come a long way on television news, baby. Or have you?</LD>
<LD>   Though admittedly amusing, all the attention paid recently to
Greta Van Susteren's eyes and Paula Zahn's sex appeal is a depressing
reminder of how often journalism comes second to appearance on
television news.</LD>
<LD>   Fox News Channel personality Van Susteren couldn't stop talking
last week about the cosmetic eye surgery that rendered her almost
unrecognizable. Last month, Zahn was featured in a CNN promotion that
described her as "just a little bit sexy."</LD>
<TE>   Veteran "60 Minutes" correspondent Lesley Stahl remembers being
depressed about breaking a story and getting five letters from
viewers in response complaining that her skirt was too short--or a
call from her mother saying she needed a haircut.</TE>
<TE>   Now she just accepts it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the way it's always been," Stahl said. "The one big
difference since I've been around, and I was hired by CBS in 1972, is
that whatever the women have to put up with, the men do too."</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who thinks otherwise probably believes Bill Hemmer is a
weekday anchor on CNN strictly on his journalistic credentials.</TE>
<TE>   "The men feel just as much pressure as the women to keep up,"
Stahl said. "We may even be a little luckier. The stigma for a woman
to wear a lot of makeup and get her hair done three times a day
doesn't exist. For a man, it's still a little embarrassing. But
they're doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Geraldo Rivera--to no one's great surprise--was a pioneer in
public cosmetic surgery for men. Twice he went under the knife on his
syndicated talk show. In 1992, he had fat removed from his buttocks
and injected into his forehead. Four years later, he got an eye job.</TE>
<TE>   Television consultant Al Primo, creator of the local "Eyewitness
News" format, remembers his shock in the early 1960s when the male
anchor at a local station where he worked got an eye job.</TE>
<TE>   Now he wouldn't turn his head.</TE>
<TE>   "Our whole industry has become a part of show business," he said.
"We are an industry that uses the same tools they use to make a movie
or a comedy show: lights, cameras, an actor and a script."</TE>
<TE>   It isn't exactly a secret that sex appeal is considered a winning
trait for a news anchor. Why else would there be a popular Web site
that features attractive actors reading the news while they
methodically undress until nude?</TE>
<TE>   The ad calling Zahn "sexy" was shown briefly one weekend on CNN
before it was yanked by embarrassed executives. It drew plenty of
knowing chuckles in newsrooms across the country.</TE>
<TE>   "The focus on appearance has always been part of the talk behind
the scenes of journalism," said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the
Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania.
"What happened to Paula Zahn is, it leaked to the public."</TE>
<TE>   CNN's new "star power" strategy has left it vulnerable to
criticism. Last year, CNN Headline News hired former "NYPD Blue"
actress Andrea Thompson as a newsreader, despite limited experience,
then kept a stiff upper lip when nude pictures of her turned up on
the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   MSNBC's Ashleigh Banfield has drawn more public attention for her
hairstyles and eyewear than for her journalism. She's expressed
frustration, but it has helped send her on a fast path to stardom.</TE>
<TE>   Zahn, 45, expressed horror at the promotion and has tried to put
the story behind her. Van Susteren, 47, hasn't shied away from
attention.</TE>
<TE>   Her eye job became a story because the first post-surgery pictures
of her that appeared on Fox showed such a dramatic change and because
the brainy lawyer had always seemed a refreshing counterpoint to the
obsession with looks.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you know that I'm the only one who's ever had this done?" she
said sarcastically to Comedy Central's Jon Stewart, whom she
encountered on a media tour that included "Good Morning America,"
"The O'Reilly Factor" and a People magazine cover.</TE>
<TE>   "It was either the eye surgery or get picked up for shoplifting to
get P.R. for the show," she said to Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   Guess what? It worked. An estimated 1.6 million viewers watched
her premiere on Fox, nearly double the crowd tuning in to CNN at the
time and also about twice what Fox averaged in the time slot in
January.</TE>
<TE>   There are some positive signs lost in the lip gloss and unlined
skin. There's a far greater range of looks and ages among women on
the air than in 1983, when 36-year-old Christine Craft sued a Kansas
City station for firing her as a news anchor because she was too old
and too ugly.</TE>
<TE>   Suggest that she tart herself up, and CNN's Christiane Amanpour is
likely to smack you.</TE>
<TE>   "It's become irrelevant," said Susan Zirinsky, executive producer
of "48 Hours" on CBS. "It feels silly. Those of us of a certain age,
we don't want to look like Greta Van Susteren. It took a long time to
get these road miles on my face. I'm proud of them."</TE>
<TE>   Zirinsky, it should be noted, works behind the camera. Not in
front of it.</TE>

<HD>Irony Deficiency Not a Problem for Bernhard</HD>
<DH>Comedy* Despite the nation's recent suffering, the
performer finds that there's enough human folly to nourish her
satiric sensibilities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Without irony as a weapon and celebrities to skewer with it, much of
Sandra Bernhard's comic career as we know it would be nothing.</LD>
<LD>   Since Sept. 11, some pundits have insisted that irony will no
longer play. Furthermore, they reason, a nation shocked into
alertness can no longer be distracted en masse by Madonna's newest
make-over or whoever's latest squeeze. If they are right, Bernhard
could be out of a gig.</LD>
<LD>   The comedian made her first mark in 1983 playing a
celebrity-obsessed stalker in "The King of Comedy." She turned up as
Madonna's buddy--and maybe more--in the documentary "Truth or Dare."
From 1991 to 1997 she played a bisexual waitress on the sitcom
"Rosanne." She cemented her own ambiguous and ironical persona as a
comic and a pop singer in the 1990 performance film "Without You I'm
Nothing."</LD>
<TE>   Now comes "Hero Worship," a stage show of comedy and songs that
Bernhard brings to the Knitting Factory in Hollywood tonight through
Thursday. Never mind the supposed shift in the zeitgeist; Bernhard is
confident that irony will work as long as human folly endures and
that celebrities will always be with us, contributing more than their
fair share of satire-tempting behavior. Not only can she crack ironic
jokes after Sept. 11, but she also intends to crack jokes about Sept.
11.</TE>
<TE>   "There's endless fodder for me that I find funny," she said last
week by phone from the apartment in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood
where she lives with her 31/2-year-old daughter, Cicely.</TE>
<TE>   At one point in her new show, Bernhard speculates wryly that the
celebrities who answered phones during the "America: A Tribute to
Heroes" telethon for victims of terrorist attacks were just chatting
with their celebrity pals.</TE>
<TE>   After declaring that she hopes all contributions will indeed go to
victims' families, she riffs on the irony of such a windfall: "Only
the other day down the Village I was trying to buy this brownstone
for $3.5 [million]. Some fireman's kid was bidding against me." She
burlesques the sexual mores of Islamic fundamentalists, heedless of
multicultural correctness.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Topical Bits About</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 11 and Aftermath</TE>
<TE>   Bernhard's first performance after the terror attacks came on Oct.
19 at an American Liver Foundation benefit in San Francisco. She says
topical bits about Sept. 11 and its aftermath just came spilling out.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think it out. I found an instinctive way of making it
funny and palatable. Initially, of course, I was a little nervous.
Everybody was badly shaken and concerned, but my job is to shed some
deeper light on these experiences. I can filter out things that
obviously don't have any entertainment value. It all worked, and
people laughed."</TE>
<TE>   Bernhard, 46, readily cops to being an ironist, but she sees
nothing inappropriate in that these days. "People [mistake] cynicism
and smugness for irony. It takes somebody who has insight to be
ironic. It just takes a [smart aleck] to be cynical.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to see the betterment of the world," she adds. "This is no
time to get soft and stupid."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, Bernhard says, it's too late to stop now. "I was a
fledgling mistress of irony as a teenager. I was kind of a class
commentator as opposed to class clown." Her lip got her thrown out of
classrooms, she says, but it never landed her in any serious trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Nor, Bernhard says, has poking fun at celebrities earned her any
deep grudges that she knows of. Mariah Carey has come in for special
ridicule in her recent routines. Convinced that actress Angie Harmon
lied about her age in an interview, Bernhard sings a plaintive ballad
in "Hero Worship" urging Harmon to stand up against ageism.</TE>
<TE>   "I think most of the people I take the [starch] out of end up
agreeing with me," Bernhard says. "People who do a lot to stay in the
public eye can veer in dangerous directions. [The satire] is all
based on what goes on in their career at a particular time."</TE>
<TE>   Part of what distinguishes Bernhard is her ability to be a
courtier in the celebrity realm--hobnobber with Madonna and Roseanne,
emcee at fashion awards shows--yet also to satirize it. "She is not a
tourist flying over a landscape. She ... understands the foolishness
of a lot of American guff and is nonetheless an inhabitant," film
critic Stanley Kaufmann wrote in a favorable review of "Without You
I'm Nothing" for the New Republic.</TE>
<TE>   Bernhard says her days caught up in Madonna's whirl taught her to
keep some distance from celebrity's most intense vortexes. "It is
hard not to get swept up into that world when you're hanging out with
somebody of her [stature]. It's not something I would do again. She
came to my show, it was flattering, we hung out.</TE>
<TE>   "I learned that was not the kind of fame I was interested in and
it was not the kind of career I wanted to emulate."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Finding Friends</TE>
<TE>   of Substance</TE>
<TE>   Bernhard says that what troubles her most about Americans'
celebrity-hunger is "the ease and access that relatively untalented
people have" in commanding the spotlight. Among her friends these
days are Chrissie Hynde and Marianne Faithfull, rock stars recognized
for their artistic substance as well as their celebrity sizzle.</TE>
<TE>   For a week last August, Bernhard was host of "The Sandra Bernhard
Experience," a talk show on the Arts &amp; Entertainment network that she
saw as a vehicle for exposing deserving talents during in-depth
discussions.</TE>
<TE>   The five-night trial, which wasn't picked up, was given a special
Thanksgiving turkey award by Times writer Howard Rosenberg for a
surfeit of "Bernhard babbling neurotically about herself." Bernhard
says she still is eager to host a TV talk show and is seeking another
outlet.</TE>
<TE>   Bernhard isn't all ironist. She loves the heart-on-a-lacy-sleeve
music of Stevie Nicks. And, she says, she has been moved by the
impact of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "The immediate unification of people was beautiful, the gentleness
and vulnerability and caring. I think it has on a deep level changed
a lot of people spiritually, and that's fantastic. But you have to
maintain that and not become complacent again. I would imagine it's
going to take more tough experiences for people to make a giant
consciousness shift. I'll be glad to stop doing [irony] if that
happens."</TE>

<HD>'Collateral Damage' Muscles Into No. 1</HD>
<DH>Box Office * The movie about terrorist-hunting collects
$15.2 million, followed by 'Big Fat Liar' and 'Rollerball.' It was a
slow weekend overall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID GERMAIN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Arnold Schwarzenegger as an avenging firefighter hunting terrorists
proved a solid attraction, though not quite a must-see movie.</LD>
<LD>   Schwarzenegger's "Collateral Damage," delayed four months because
of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, opened as the top weekend movie
with $15.2 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   It was Schwarzenegger's first No. 1 opening since "Batman &amp; Robin"
in 1997, but the receipts were so-so compared with that film's $42.9
million debut or the $31.8 million premiere of "Terminator 2:
Judgment Day" in 1991.</LD>
<TE>   The family flick "Big Fat Liar," starring Frankie Muniz of
"Malcolm in the Middle" as a teenager out to prove that a Hollywood
producer stole his movie idea, debuted in second place with $11.7
million.</TE>
<TE>   The remake of "Rollerball," starring Chris Klein, LL Cool J and
Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, opened at No. 3 with $9 million.</TE>
<TE>   Box-office receipts were down overall, with the top 12 movies
grossing $83.8 million, a 22% drop from the same weekend last year.
But that was the weekend "Hannibal" debuted with $58 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Winter Olympics, which opened Friday, probably kept some
moviegoers at home this weekend, said Paul Dergarabedian, president
of Exhibitor Relations, which tracks the box office.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, "Collateral Damage" and "Big Fat Liar" were coolly
received by critics, and reviewers trashed "Rollerball."</TE>
<TE>   Playing in 2,824 theaters, "Collateral Damage" averaged a decent
though unspectacular $5,375 a location. "Big Fat Liar" averaged
$4,641 in 2,521 theaters and "Rollerball" gathered $3,267 at 2,762
sites.</TE>
<TE>   "Collectively, the three new films were the most attractive to
moviegoers, but people weren't beating down the doors to see any of
these movies," Dergarabedian said.</TE>
<TE>   Originally scheduled for release last October, "Collateral Damage"
was put on hold . because Schwarzenegger and distributor Warner Bros.
felt audiences would not have the stomach to see a firefighter hunt
terrorists, especially given the heroism of New York City
firefighters killed in the World Trade Center attack.</TE>
<TE>   Now that time has passed, the firefighter connection may have
heightened the film's appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure of that. It's hard to pick that up in our research,"
said Dan Fellman, head of distribution at Warner Bros. "But based on
the solid performance of the movie, you have to think that had some
effect."</TE>
<TE>   "Monster's Ball," a death row drama that some observers expect to
earn an Oscar nomination Tuesday for Halle Berry, expanded from a
handful of screens to 341 theaters, taking in $2.3 million for a
$6,745 average. The film has grossed $3.9 million since opening in
December to qualify for the Oscars.</TE>
<TE>   That movie and other likely nominees, including "Black Hawk Down,"
"A Beautiful Mind" and "In the Bedroom," should get a box-office
boost from the Oscar attention leading up to the awards ceremony
March 24.</TE>
<TE>   "Black Hawk Down" pulled in $8 million, enough to rank as No. 4
for the weekend, followed by "Snow Dogs" with $6.7 million, "The
Count of Monte Cristo" with $6.3 million, "A Beautiful Mind" with
$5.8 million, "A Walk to Remember" with $5.77 million, "The Mothman
Prophecies" with $4.9 million and "I Am Sam" with $4.5 million.</TE>

<HD>CNN Could Learn a Few Things From Good Old Auntie Beeb</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA GARAPEDIAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Howard Rosenberg is right to pillory CNN in its recent attempts to
create a cult of personality around their news anchors, abandoning
the belief that news is sacred--not the people who deliver it ("Big
Names, Little News--This is CNN?" Feb. 1).</LD>
<LD>   Has CNN sold out to its network news rivals? Yup. Are they conning
the American public into believing that news is only palatable coming
from the lips of a vastly paid, coiffed and hair-sprayed celebrity?
Yup. Is it avoidable? Ask Auntie Beeb.</LD>
<LD>   Imagine a TV world where it isn't the news anchor that matters
most, but the quality of the news coverage. Imagine a news network so
trusted around the world that people of all nationalities listen in
on radio and television because they believe what they're hearing is
true. Imagine newsrooms where the producers and reporters--not the
on-air anchor--decide what goes on air.</LD>
<TE>   Where the journalist will never be told that a story of public
interest can't be covered because it might offend one demographic
group or another, risking a dip in ratings. Where the decision on
what to cover is based on what the public should know as informed
citizens--not on what executives think the public wants to hear,
based on ratings and focus groups.</TE>
<TE>   This news nirvana isn't myth. It really exists. I speak as the
only American ever to anchor the news for the BBC. I was one of the
faces of BBC World, Britain's international news channel and antidote
to CNN.</TE>
<TE>   At the BBC--or, as the British affectionately call it, Auntie
Beeb--cults of personality are distinctly frowned upon, almost to the
point of absurdity. As a previous anchor for CNBC and correspondent
for NBC, I was "de-glammed" by my BBC minders--big "American" hair
trimmed down, Technicolor jackets reduced to easy-on-the-eye pastels.</TE>
<TE>   It was a shock. I became a senior citizen overnight. The BBC
didn't care if the lighting made me look 30 years older, or that I
was sitting in shadow, or that my hair was sticking up. They didn't
blow a gasket when the script printer ran out of paper, or even when,
in true public broadcasting tradition, power cuts knocked out my
TelePrompTer. This was news anchoring by the seat of my pants
(knickers), where every wit I possessed was pulled out of me, and
broadcast live to the world.</TE>
<TE>   I loved it. Never in my experience working for an American network
was I allowed the freedom to do what I was trained for. Yes, I was
downsized as a news personality. To be the face of the BBC meant just
that: I was the mouthpiece for a revered news
organization-cum-national institution. The only unique stamp allowed
me was my accent. Even there, the BBC's language police did their
best to neutralize any of my more objectionable pronunciations (I was
not to use the American pronunciation "Mooslim"; this, I was told,
was the same word as "camel"). Thankfully, my minders never worked

<TE>   My BBC bosses did care about my ability to conduct a live
interview fairly and objectively, whatever country was involved. With
only a minute's notice, unbriefed, I was expected to interview
newsmakers around the world with the expertise of a think-tank
specialist.</TE>
<TE>   As a former foreign news producer with a doctorate in
international relations, this wasn't insurmountable. But it was
fraught with peril. I came close to losing my job over an interview I
did on the Indian elections. A viewer in New Delhi complained that,
by the way I'd phrased a question, I had expressed a preference for
one of the candidates. Auntie Beeb deemed me guilty until proven
innocent--which I later was.</TE>
<TE>   As my career flashed in front of me, I learned all too quickly
what mattered most at the BBC: journalism, not celebrity.</TE>
<TE>   I mourn with you, Howard, the sell-out by CNN. But I can tell you,
I've seen the news messiah. And he's a she.</TE>

<HD>Southside Johnny's Eclectic New Album</HD>
<DH>The New Jersey singer's 'Messin'' mixes his own songs with
bluesy numbers by Memphis Slim, Tom Waits and Percy Mayfield.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROGER CATLIN</AU>
<BD>HARTFORD COURANT</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He got his nickname because of his fascination with bluesmen from the
South Side of Chicago. But Southside Johnny became better known as
the second-most-famous product of the Jersey Shore bar scene.</LD>
<LD>   Even now, his shows with the Jukes evoke the gritty soul of Asbury
Park, where the Stone Pony struggles to survive. But Southside, also
known as John Lyon, has since lived in a number of places, from
Connecticut to California to Tennessee. Now he's moving to Delaware.</LD>
<LD>   Lyon had moved to Nashville during a two-year hiatus. "I was so
fed up with the music business, I quit," he says. "The stupid thing,
of course, was to move to Nashville to try to get away from the music
business."</LD>
<TE>   Music City is filled with players not associated just with
country. Among them are his old friend Garry Tallent, bassist for
Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band.</TE>
<TE>   "Garry and I talked about doing an album together for years and
years," Lyon says. The resulting "Messin' With the Blues," his first
new album in eight years, was a departure.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a straight blues album," Lyon says. "Not just slow English
heavy metal blues but all sorts of styles of blues. I had always
wanted to do something like that, and since I had a lot of road miles
on me, I felt I could do that stuff better now."</TE>
<TE>   Working on the sessions, he says, "was a joy from beginning to
end. I'm more of a live performer than a studio guy, but when we got
into the studio we didn't even always rehearse songs first. We'd just
pick a key and play. Then I'd go back and write lyrics to it."</TE>
<TE>   He also had a chance to do a lot of obscure covers. "Both Garry
and I have these big record collections. We got to listen to a lot of
old B-sides and things we hadn't listened to in years to pick some
good stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Among them are two from Memphis Slim, "Mother Earth" and the title
track; one from Percy Mayfield, "River's Invitation"; and one from
Tom Waits, whose "Gin Soaked Boy" opens the collection.</TE>
<TE>   Southside hopes to take a similar approach to his next album,
which will concentrate more on soul music.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to R&amp;B and soul from the '60s and maybe even some
'70s soul," he says. "We want to get in the studio right away and
take advantage with how happy we are with how the band sounds."</TE>
<TE>   The Jukes lineup is guitarist Bobby Bandiera, keyboardist Jeff
Kazee, drummer Chucki Burke and the ace horn section of Joey Stan,
Richie "La Bamba" Rosenberg, Eddie Manion, Chris Anderson and Mark
"The Lung Man" Pender.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to afford myself the license to do whatever I want to
do," Lyon says. "Not that I didn't do that before. But it's been fun
exploring forms of music that have always been fun to sing along
to--on original songs and covers."</TE>
<TE>   A typical live show these days will swing way back in time to
nuggets including "Hearts of Stone," "This Time It's for Real" and "I
Don't Want To Go Home."</TE>
<TE>   "We'll do something from almost every album of my
less-than-illustrious past," he says. "Even some stuff we don't even
know....</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure you've seen a band do the same show every night. And the
musicians are all just going through a routine, thinking about what
they're going to have for dinner that night. I just can't stand that.
I want everyone to be engaged. So I have to throw a lot of curve
balls on stage."</TE>

<HD>Lesson of 'Lord of the Rings': Clarity in a Time of
Darkness</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NILES ELLIOT GOLDSTEIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What do fire-breathing dragons and flame-spewing skyscrapers have in
common?</LD>
<LD>   The extraordinary commercial and popular success of "The Lord of
the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" has as much to do with
unconscious psychosocial forces as it does with its acting
performances and entertainment value. Though it is a contemporary
movie, it has tapped into a deep and ancient font of human yearning.</LD>
<LD>   The dark events of both Sept. 11 and of the J.R.R. Tolkien fantasy
film represent revelations--not of light, but of night. They present
us--actually in the former case and imaginatively in the latter--with
the opportunity to wrap our limited minds around the almost
unfathomable, larger-than-life ideas of transcendent good and
diabolical evil.</LD>
<TE>   After the collapse of the World Trade Center, I walked through
ground zero. It was during the Days of Awe. Before me was a scene of
cinematic devastation: a wasteland of smashed buildings and shattered
windows, monstrous pillars of twisted steel, smoke rising from the
rubble.</TE>
<TE>   As a law enforcement chaplain, I spoke with police officers,
firefighters and rescue workers from dozens of different agencies and
cities. I was moved by the acts of commitment and expressions of love
that permeated that hellish place. And I was astounded by the vision
of so many people finding their deepest, most beautiful selves in the
heart of such an immense void.</TE>
<TE>   Although most of life is about shadows and ambiguity, occasionally
there are eruptions of absolutes, of clear examples of evil and good.
As uncommon (and at times disturbing) as these eruptions can be, they
offer us a kind of theological comfort food, a respite from the
burdens of doubt and relativism that plague postmodern human beings.</TE>
<TE>   Jung argued that there were no moral absolutes, that everything
was an amoral and interwoven unity. A Jewish mystic once said that
the person who does not see the sacred everywhere will not see it
anywhere. Yet after the Sept. 11 attacks and events like them, such
totalizing worldviews whitewash the discrete reality of evil too
easily. It is a real, ontological power, a dragon that must be
confronted and done battle with. Sometimes it is conveyed through
fairy tales. Other times it slaps us in the face.</TE>
<TE>   We need these mythic moments, these glimpses of moral clarity, to
remind us that life has meaning and order, that the abyss of
uncertainty is only an illusion waiting to be lifted. When it is, we
discover our shared humanity, our community. The paradox is that it
sometimes takes a revelation of night to disclose the sanctuaries
that are potentially all around us. That is our tragedy and our gift.</TE>
<TE>   The myth of the Ring and the myth of the Towers give us a similar
message: Within every experience of darkness there are sparks of
light in need of being kindled. Living without the language and
imagery of myth is the real horror--a black, lonely hole that leads
to nowhere.</TE>

<HD>Imperatriz Leopoldinense Puts Authenticity in Carnaval</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carnaval was all over the place Saturday at the Hollywood Palladium,
which was filled with the festive music and spirit that always mark
the annual Brazilian Carnaval event. The stars of this year's show
were a collection of musicians and dancers from Rio's prize-winning
Imperatriz Leopoldinense samba school, and when they took the stage
shortly after midnight, the initial effect was exhilarating.</LD>
<LD>   Garbed in picturesque green and yellow costumes, the group's six
percussionists kicked off a gripping call-and-response rhythmic
pattern, following it with a torrent of powerful, in-the-pocket samba
rhythms. A few minutes later they were joined by a musician playing
the ukulele-like cavaquino, a singer and their own dancers as they
opened up the proceedings into an animated, mini version of Rio
Carnaval.</LD>
<LD>   "Mini" because the 12 members of Imperatriz Leopoldinense
represented only a tiny percentage of the group's 6,000 members. And
the contrast with the real thing was especially dramatic when one
compared the Palladium proceedings with the ballroom's video screen
images of huge ensembles of elaborately costumed musicians and
dancers surging through the streets of Rio.</LD>
<TE>   But although the Imperatriz drummers did not sound particularly
superior to some of the Southland's own Brazilian percussionists,
they brought an irresistible sense of authentic spirit and vivacity
to an enthusiastic crowd that was intent upon happily dancing its way
into the early-morning hours.</TE>

<HD>Nelson Takes Another Smooth Ride Down the River</HD>
<DH>With an equally adroit Ray Charles sharing the bill, the
country legend ably covers both old and new territory.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whiskey river take my mind, don't let her memory torture me....</LD>
<LD>   Yes, Willie Nelson is on the road again, and he opened his concert
Saturday at the Universal Amphitheatre with "Whiskey River," the
honky-tonk lament he has used to open every concert since, well ...
forever.</LD>
<LD>   And, yes, the free-spirited Texan still sings some of his early
compositions, including "Crazy," which was a smash in 1961 for Patsy
Cline, and "Funny How Time Slips Away," one of the most compact and
poetic country ballads ever.</LD>
<TE>   And, yes, Nelson still sings hits from the Waylon and Willie
outlaw days, including "Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be
Cowboys" and "Luckenbach, Texas."</TE>
<TE>   And, yes, it still sounds delightful.</TE>
<TE>   The discovery of exciting new artists and songs is the most
stimulating part of the pop music experience, but there's a lot to be
said for rediscovery of the masters--and two of them were on the
Universal Amphitheatre stage Saturday: Nelson and Ray Charles.</TE>
<TE>   It was a rare pairing of two great artists who have moved beyond
the boundaries of their respective fields (country and soul) to make
music that speaks with a deep sense of history and truth.</TE>
<TE>   After a 20-minute instrumental segment by his large band, Charles
opened the concert with an hour of tunes--and yes, that meant a
reprise of such signature numbers as Percy Mayfield's "Hit the Road,
Jack," Don Gibson's "I Can't Stop Loving You" and Charles' own
"What'd I Say."</TE>
<TE>   Charles, who accompanies himself on electric piano, can still make
you marvel at his phrasing, which draws from gospel music, but he
seemed too restricted by the big-band arrangements. Things were more
interesting when he stepped away from his routine to interact with
Nelson on Hoagy Carmichael and Stuart Gorrell's "Georgia on My Mind,"
a hit for both co-headliners and the evening's only collaboration
between the two.</TE>
<TE>   Charles, 71, also seemed more involved vocally when he relied on
just a rhythm section to back him on a bluesy, urgent rendition of
Mayfield's "Stranger in My Own Home Town" and on an earnest treatment
of Leon Russell's ballad "Song for You."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the familiar material in the first two-thirds of Nelson's
two-hour set, the music seemed more consistently personal and
involving. Like Charles, Nelson, 68, is a singer with an unusually
distinctive style, and his acoustic guitar work adds even more
character to his music.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson, however, is more effective at broadening his music,
constantly bringing in inviting new strains. He used the final third
of the concert to showcase songs from his last three albums,
including the new "The Great Divide."</TE>
<TE>   Produced by Matt Serletic and featuring such guest writers and
singers as Rob Thomas, Bernie Taupin, Sheryl Crow and Kid Rock, the
album is an ambitious attempt to reestablish Nelson as a mainstream
bestseller, much in the manner of Santana's "Supernatural."</TE>
<TE>   Though sometimes striking, the Lost Highway release feels
overproduced in places, sabotaging the simplicity and grace that are
Nelson trademarks. The singer was more effective Saturday in a
bluesy, customized version of Kokomo Arnold's old "Milk Cow Blues,"
the title song of his 2000 album on Island Records. Guest guitarist
Kenny Wayne Shepherd added some scorching licks.</TE>
<TE>   In another winning segment, Nelson reached back to the '40s and
early '50s for four tunes written by or associated with country
legend Hank Williams, including "Jambalaya" and "My Bucket's Got a
Hole in It."</TE>
<TE>   How fitting that on a night of rediscovery for many in the
audience, Nelson demonstrated that he, too, still knows the value of
looking back.</TE>

<LD>After reading of Patrick Goldstein's disappointment that the Academy
Awards have been overshadowed by excessive campaign advertising and
publicity ("An Oscar Mantra: Press to Excess," Feb. 5), we were
surprised that he chose to use the rest of his column to revisit
those very same "distractions" that he claims to hate.</LD>
<LD>   Inspired by Goldstein's "slightly exaggerated" talking points
(we'd love his help on our press kits), we, the Miramax publicity
staff, have prepared our own list of talking points on Goldstein's
journalistic inquiries on academy hype.</LD>
<LD>   * Don't revisit and breathe life into a controversy that does not
exist. After writing about the alleged Miramax/Universal feud two
weeks ago, and recognizing both studios' on-the-record denials of any
problems, Goldstein chose to recycle the same old charges with no new
substance, wasting valuable space that could have been better filled
by his insights on particular films.</LD>
<TE>   * Referencing one New York Post story that suits your agenda,
while refusing to cite another contradictory one, leads to incomplete
conclusions. Either include both sides or neither--just be fair.</TE>
<TE>   * Excoriating members of the entire "In the Bedroom" cast simply
because Miramax granted Tom Wilkinson's routine request for a talking
points memo before an interview is just plain mean. Instead, why not
celebrate these top actors who accepted lower wages to work on an
edgy, independent movie, heralded by top critics as one of the best
films of the year, one the big studios declined to make?</TE>
<TE>   * Magnifying the attention given to the many rumors, accusations
and allegations that studios plot against each other's films during
this time of year helps spice up a slow news week. In fact, we are
working hard to raise awareness of great independent and foreign
films like "In the Bedroom" and "Amelie."</TE>
<TE>   * When countless critics and journalists from reputable outlets
like the New York Times, Entertainment Weekly and the New Yorker
provide factual complaints about the inaccuracies of a particular
film, don't blame one columnist or one studio as being behind it. We
never blamed other studios for stirring up media attacks on
"Chocolat" and never complained to reporters about our competitors'
hypocritical complaints about our "hiding abortion and incest themes"
in "The Cider House Rules."</TE>
<TE>   * Opposing the use of quotes from non-critics in film ads denies
moviegoers a common benefit offered those purchasing books with
acclaim from non-critics on the book jacket. What exactly is wrong
with using Stanley Donen and Robert Wise to highlight a musical
masterpiece like "Moulin Rouge" or quoting someone whose personal
experiences relate to the difficult issues faced in "In the Bedroom"?</TE>
<TE>   * Rewarding anonymous "studio publicity experts" with the chance
to attack us by contributing to Goldstein's malicious talking points
only contributes to the atmosphere of negative campaigning that he
rightfully complains about in his column.</TE>
<TE>   * Knocking Miramax and others for spending money on academy
campaigns promoting a variety of innovative, risk-taking and
low-budget films discourages the making and marketing of those types
of films. In fact, last year Goldstein chastised a studio for failing
to support exactly that type of film. In addition, our high-profile
campaigns bring attention to much of the less-celebrated but equally
important work of costume and set designers, composers, editors,
sound technicians, writers and cinematographers. These are the people
who need to be celebrated on Oscar night.</TE>
<TE>   * Seeing is believing. We at Miramax have repeatedly said over the
years that we know that all a campaign can do is encourage voters to
see the movie and develop their own opinion. After that, the film
must speak for itself.</TE>
<TE>   When films succeed, it's good for the entire business. To that
end, let's work together to raise the bar, not lower it.</TE>

<HD>In Search of a City's Soul</HD>
<DH>Television * A fledgling filmmaker scoured his New York
neighborhood for tell-tale vignettes. Now he has turned his attention
to L.A. stories.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What do the zookeeper at the Playboy Mansion, the announcer on "The
Price Is Right," a street entertainer who juggles chainsaws on the
Venice boardwalk, and a mechanical bull operator have in common? They
are all "Souls of LA."</LD>
<LD>   Created by Brent Sterling Nemetz, "Souls of LA" showcases unusual
jobs in Los Angeles. Five installments have been completed, each
featuring seven or eight such colorful characters. The series began
in December, with the fourth and fifth episodes to run tonight and
next Mondayon KCET. Additional half-hours are being shot.</LD>
<LD>   "Souls" expands upon an idea that Nemetz initiated after
graduating from New York University film school.</LD>
<TE>   "Having just graduated from school, most people are not banging
down your door," he said. "So I decided to take my future into my own
hands and look in my own backyard for everyday people who have
interesting stories."</TE>
<TE>   The first person he interviewed in New York was a horse and
carriage driver in Central Park. "He had some wonderful anecdotes
about the city, and that's where I got the title for the series,"
Nemetz recalled. "He described Central Park as the 'soul' of New York
because it is the embodiment of all the people who make New York what
it is. I thought it was such a beautiful title."</TE>
<TE>   Nemetz sent WNET, the PBS station in New York, his first
installment of "Souls of New York" in hopes the station would acquire
it. The audience response to the first episode was so strong that
WNET quickly asked for more. "I am working on my 30th half-hour
program in New York alone," he said.</TE>
<TE>   With "Souls of New York" launched, Nemetz decided to try his luck
in Los Angeles last year. "I had been to L.A. many times and had come
across several people who I found to be appropriate for the show," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last year, Nemetz profiled everyone from a mixologist at
the Tiki-Ti Cocktail Lounge on Sunset Boulevard to a young man who
poses in a tank at the Standard Hotel on the Sunset Strip. Nemetz
said his natural curiosity, as well as suggestions from viewers,
leads him to his subjects. "When I have a show air, I receive
tremendous positive response from viewers, not only by e-mail but by
telephone," he said. "They say my neighbor is a 'Soul'; my father is
a 'Soul.'"</TE>
<TE>   Rod Roddy, the announcer on "The Price Is Right," is probably the
most famous "Soul" he has profiled in Los Angeles. Because the
majority of the people Nemetz profiles have never been on television
before, he often has to convince them to participate.</TE>
<TE>   "I have been very persistent," he said. "There are very, very few
people I ultimately don't get in the end. Sometimes it takes as long
or two or three years to get a segment."</TE>
<TE>   The New York version of the series is now in the archives of the
Smithsonian in Washington, D.C. "I think the museum appreciates the
fact that many of these people who I capture won't be around forever,
and many of these jobs are dying off as we enter a new modern age,"
Nemetz said. "A lot of these people are not the type of people who
would be filmed and captured. We generally live in such a
celebrity-oriented world and [the celebrities] receive such
overexposure. I think that one of things people love about the show
is that they can relate to many of these people."</TE>
<TE>   Besides taking on New York and L.A., Nemetz has recently completed
several episodes of "Souls of Miami." He is also exploring taking the
concept to San Francisco, San Diego and a number of other cities.
"We'll see how far it goes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Souls of LA" can be seen tonight and Feb. 18 at 10:30 p.m. on
KCET.</TE>

<HD>Ambiguity's Art</HD>
<DH>Major MOCA show celebrates the power and precision of
Willem de Kooning.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you take a sharpened pencil and draw a continuous line on a piece
of paper, the line will steadily get fatter as the pencil point
dulls. However, if you simultaneously roll the pencil with your
fingers as you go, the line will maintain a more uniform thickness.
The technique isn't easy to master, but with some practice you can
start to get the hang of it.</LD>
<LD>   Now, multiply that difficulty by a factor of 10--or maybe 100--and
you'll have some idea of the jaw-dropping skill with which Willem de
Kooning could link his hand to his eye and brain in order to draw.
When the Dutch-born 20-year-old finished his training at Rotterdam's
art academy in 1924, he was well on his way to developing the
precision and dexterity of a consummate draftsman. As he matured as
an artist in the 1930s and 1940s, after immigrating to New York, he
turned that proficiency toward abstraction.</LD>
<LD>   A powerful, engrossing exhibition of 78 De Kooning drawings that
opened Sunday at the Museum of Contemporary Art shows what he did
with that legendary facility. "Willem de Kooning: Tracing the Figure"
was organized by MOCA curators Paul Schimmel and Connie Butler. It
focuses almost exclusively on a single subject from the academic
repertoire--the female nude--while spanning the socially and
artistically convulsive years 1938 to 1955.</LD>
<TE>   Late in 1952, after two full years of labor, De Kooning had
finished his momentous oil painting, "Woman I," which is today an
icon of postwar American art. (De Kooning died in 1997.) "Tracing the
Figure," bursting with the intense immediacy of artistic thought that
only drawings can reveal, shows how he got there.</TE>
<TE>   Its centerpiece is MOCA's own "Two Women with Still Life," which
rightly occupies pride of place in the show. A bequest to the museum
from the late Marcia Simon Weisman, it is the most complex and
resolved drawing De Kooning made during the summer of 1952, just
before he finished "Woman I."</TE>
<TE>   The large drawing (nearly 2 feet square) is executed in a rich
variety of pastels. Its stormy all-over composition integrates two
monumental figures, a seaside landscape and elements of still life
into a scene at once voluptuous and brittle.</TE>
<TE>   De Kooning took one part Picasso's "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon,"
mixed in a splash of Cezanne's "Bathers," added shards of Manet
("Olympia," "Luncheon on the Grass") and much more, then shook them
all together. The hypnotic result is a ferocious refusal of orthodox
American images of womanhood.</TE>
<TE>   In the years after World War II, women experienced extraordinary
social strains. Their critical participation in the war effort had
radically altered their traditional role in American life. Having
entered the labor force (including the armed services) in
unprecedented numbers, women were then under pressure to return to
hearth and home.</TE>
<TE>   Led by American citizen-soldiers, the Allied victory in an
international conflict of unprecedented brutality created deep, often
unspoken urges for a restoration of normality. And what was normal
before the war was becoming blandly idealized in the burgeoning
imagery of mass culture, where Ozzie's adventures with Harriet began
to flicker across the nation's new television screens at precisely
the moment De Kooning was putting the finishing touches on his fierce
and unruly "Woman I."</TE>
<TE>   De Kooning began his focus on woman-as-subject in 1938, shortly
after he met painter and critic Elaine Fried, who would later become
his wife. An early pencil drawing, circa 1940-41, shows her seated,
returning in kind the intense stare De Kooning necessarily would have
taken to the portrait process. Her head and hands are detailed and
finely rendered, in the manner of Ingres; her torso is just a soft
crumple of atmospheric graphite. A depicted setting is virtually
nonexistent; her venue is instead the abstract environment of art.</TE>
<TE>   The first section of MOCA's exhibition ends around 1945-46, and it
chronicles De Kooning's initial forays from realism into abstraction.
Works such as "Fire Island," "Still Life" and "Seated Woman" reveal
the influence of such New York immigrant-peers as the Armenian
Arshile Gorky, whose transparent color and mutilated organic forms
quickly crept into De Kooning's art, and the older, mystically
inclined Russian, John Graham.</TE>
<TE>   More important as a writer (and gadfly) than a painter, Graham had
published a 1937 book, "System and Dialectics of Art," which was
widely read in local art circles. Its mythic principles of synthesis
and metamorphosis generally characterize De Kooning's work.</TE>
<TE>   Drawing was integral to his painting. He was famous for layering
drawings on top of a painting in progress to chart the ever-evolving
picture. Often he would use tracing paper, copy a section of the
painting, then shift the layered drawing to reorient fragments of the
image.</TE>
<TE>   The fractured planes of Cubism, in which material objects and
ethereal space interpenetrate one another, were always the formal
armature on which De Kooning built his art. The layering technique
heightened the visual appearance of Cubist splintering, which he wove
together with organic brushwork or cobbled with bluntly drawn lines.</TE>
<TE>   'Pink Angels' Launched a Period of Abstract Oils</TE>
<TE>   Surrealism was another linchpin. Partly it was important for its
organic vibrancy. A somewhat tame "Reclining Nude (Juliette Brauner)"
(1938) is all soft and billowy long curves, like an odalisque by Jean
Arp. Other pencil drawings attenuate the forms for expressionist
effect. One of the most beautiful is "Study for 'Pink Angels'"
(1945), where twisting, limb-like forms melt within transparent
layers of warm, buttery pastel color.</TE>
<TE>   The first phase of De Kooning's series of women concluded with the
great oil painting "Pink Angels" (circa 1945), and it launched him
into a five-year period of abstract oils characterized by a reduced
palette and shallow, fragmented space.</TE>
<TE>   Helpfully installed in a gallery adjacent to the drawing show are
"Pink Angels" and a black-and-white picture called "Dark Pond"
(1946), whose classic whiplash brushwork suggests a midnight glimpse
of lightning reflected on black water. Both exceptional paintings
have been lent for the occasion by the Frederick R. Weisman Art
Foundation, and they should not be missed.</TE>
<TE>   The formal inventiveness of Surrealism wasn't all that attracted
De Kooning. Mining the psychosexual power of the unconscious was at
least as important. The dismembered organic shapes hung on an
architectonic framework in the oil, enamel and charcoal drawing
"Mailbox" (1948) reek of ambiguous sexual violence. It's more
explicit in an untitled charcoal and oil on paper from around 1947,
in which a writhing, jagged, reclining figure on a vivid yellow floor
recalls Giacometti's notorious Surrealist bronze, "Woman With Her
Throat Cut" (1932).</TE>
<TE>   The second section of the show follows the run-up to De Kooning's
landmark exhibition at Sidney Janis Gallery in March 1953, where
"Woman I" and five other paintings of the subject were introduced by
a room of 16 drawings (including the MOCA pastel). It reaches a
crescendo in a gallery that features 11 works executed on Long Island
during the summer of 1952, which set the stage for the completion of
"Woman I."</TE>
<TE>   Pushing to the Limits of Figurative Abstraction</TE>
<TE>   The final works demonstrate how, after the stir created by the
Janis show, De Kooning's focus soon shifted. Most of these push
figurative abstraction to its limits--sometimes successfully,
sometimes not. The last one, "Figure in Interior" (1955), barely
contains a hint of human anatomy at all.</TE>
<TE>   De Kooning's images of women have always been controversial. At
first some assailed them for abandoning pure abstraction. Often
they've been read as psychobiography, like Picasso's paintings of his
wives and mistresses.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, given their inescapable violence and caricatured
sexuality, they're derided as misogynist. And certainly the social
repression that created a public vacuum in women's own artistic
representations of themselves established a lopsided context for De
Kooning's ferocious works.</TE>
<TE>   But as these extraordinary drawings at MOCA eloquently attest, his
ambitious art is characterized by nothing so much as hard-won
ambiguity. In postwar mass culture, a woman's image was trapped in a
prison of banality, and nobody has ever accused De Kooning of that.
He tore conventional notions limb from limb, even as he consolidated
new ones in their wake. His "Women" are something peculiar to our
age: iconoclastic icons, suitable for a world in dramatic flux.</TE>

<LD>They were dancing in the aisles on Saturday at the Ivar Theatre, the
erstwhile strip joint that has recently been home to "Spectrum: Dance
in L.A." At least the lusty Swing Brazil Dance Company shimmied up
the aisles during their party-like finale, "Axe Sambando!"Now in its
10th outing, this "Spectrum's" operative words were hair, flair and
bare--skin, that is, as 17 choreographers showcased their works,
helping take up the slack resulting from Dance Kaleidoscope's
downsizing.</LD>
<LD>   Solos proved particularly fertile, with a trio of shining
performances. Jamal Story gave awesome life to "Endangered Species,"
Robert Gilliam's take on a doomed bird, as a nearly naked Story
dazzled with feral leaps and thrilling turns. The incomparable Lisa
K. Lock, in her reworked "Deviation," made inspired use of platform
shoes in balancing feats executed while lying prone on a chair.</LD>
<LD>   Also reworked, and still mind-blowing: Banafsheh Sayyad's trance
dance, "Cycle of Fire." Accompanied by Pejman Hadadi's live
percussion, Sayyad whirled as if possessed.</LD>
<TE>   The night was also a fount of estrogen power. Sarah Bashir showed
promise with her fusion flamenco work, "Contra La Obscuridad," a
female octet displaying deft line formations and unison stamping.
Benita Bike's impressive work in progress, "A Few American Songs,"
saw four women let loose in joyful, knee-slapping jags to a bevy of
banjo-plucked tunes. Rei Aoo's skillful "The Horsemen in Wilderness"
was drenched in energetic fervor.</TE>
<TE>   More, unfortunately, was less in Adam Parson's "Primitive," as
eight women plodded through a host of repetitive jazz kicks. Ditto
for Bubba Carr's "Trip With Salvador Nijinsky," as 11 dancers flailed
about robotically.</TE>
<TE>   Raves and discos punctuated two works: "Communication Without
Manipulation" highlighted a limber Steve Kincade in Chris Payne
Dupre's sadomasochistic excursion; and Omhmar N. Griffin's rollicking
"That 70's Story" was a wiggy hommage to that era. Nalani Wilson's
lively "Bring It!" proved a schizoid-like hip hop-versus-jazz
journey.</TE>
<TE>   Completing the bill: Deborah Brockus' ambitious "Phoenix"; Cindy
Short's clever "Goin' Out West"; Denise Leitner' fiery "Going Home";
Armin Moradian's hilarious "Tap Dance"; and the sole ballet entry,
John Castagna's whimsical "Bianca's Dilemma."</TE>

<LD>Eighteen-year-old Arizonan Michelle Branch, who made her L.A.
headlining debut at the Roxy on Friday, represents the latest twist
on record labels' approach to marketing music to young folks. It's
all about promoting "real" artists who write their own stuff and
therefore (supposedly) speak authentically to their audiences, rather
than simply mouthing the words of songwriting committees a la the
teen-poppers who have been quite successful, though artistically
bereft.</LD>
<LD>   Yet it would seem that even an artist who cites rebels Jimi
Hendrix and Led Zeppelin as influences must take the tried-and-true
teen-scene route of being pushed to MTV's "Total Request Live,"
having songs on TV shows and doing that Internet viral-marketing
thing. Even Branch's 2001 debut album, "The Spirit Room" (written
mostly by her, with some help from producer John Shanks and others),
has more of a slick modern-pop sheen than the stripped-down feel of a
girl and her guitar.</LD>
<LD>   Branch's nearly hourlong Roxy set wasn't as sonically glib, and
most of the singer-guitarist's love-oriented songs were believably
optimistic and wistful, if at times painfully sincere.</LD>
<TE>   Backed by a quartet, she displayed a knack for hooks on such
numbers as the propulsive folk-rocker "Everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   She even inspired a few fans to spark up their lighters for the
affecting "Goodbye to You," a plaintive
leave-behind-the-old-and-face-up-to-the-new ballad recently performed
on TV's "Buffy the Vampire Slayer."</TE>
<TE>   But these quality moments didn't entirely keep tedium at bay, and
Branch's fine-enough voice didn't much distinguish the more generic
sentiments.</TE>
<TE>   Although her admiration for rock's icons may serve her better in
the future, right now she is at best destined for a safer fate as the
next generation's Sheryl Crow or Jewel.</TE>

<HD>Teatro Lirico Singer Flutters Through 'Butterfly'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Puccini's "Madame Butterfly" is foolproof as long as you have a
heartbreaking Cio-Cio San. That's exactly what Teatro Lirico d'Europa
offered in Qilian Chen, who sang the title role Friday at the
Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts.</LD>
<LD>   With her radiant smile and demeanor, Chen easily evoked the
idealistic, trusting 15-year-old geisha who marries the cad
Pinkerton, believing he is as committed to the relationship as she
is. Chen shifted adroitly between childhood innocence and mature
awareness of her pained life up to the point of meeting the American
naval lieutenant. Far greater sacrifice lay ahead, and Chen was up to
revealing the levels of tragedy.</LD>
<LD>   Vocally, her silvery soprano tended to wobble under pressure,
especially in the first act (she did not attempt the high D-flat at
the end of her entrance aria). But she went the marathon distance
with strength and dignity, and with subtle and affecting phrasing.
She carried the opera to its triumphant conclusion.</LD>
<TE>   Her Pinkerton was Roumen Doykov, who spelled his last name Doikov
at the company's appearances in Cerritos in 2000 and 2001. He used
his bright, big tenor with little if any subtlety in dynamic or
phrasing, which matched his broad stand-and-sing acting style. He
did, however, interestingly suggest that Pinkerton's interest in the
teenage heroine had an edge of unsavory prurience.</TE>
<TE>   Nicolai Dobrev sang Sharpless, the American consul, strongly but
without hint of emotional involvement in the story. Elena Marinova
was a sympathetic Suzuki, alarmed even at the marriage about what the
future might bring. Milko Mihaylov was a sly Goro. The other minor
characters were monochromatic, however.</TE>
<TE>   Company director Giorgio Lalov staged the opera traditionally,
except at the end, when he stopped the action as a remorseful
Pinkerton held the dying Butterfly in his arms, leaving their child
in the lurch. Krassimir Topolov led the orchestra briskly.</TE>

<HD>Ailey Troupe Lights a Torch</HD>
<DH>A work that conjures up the spirit and athleticism of FloJo
opens the performance phase of Salt Lake's Cultural Olympiad.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>SALT LAKE CITY--No announcement or program note on Saturday linked
the name of 1980s Olympic track champion Florence Griffith Joyner to
Judith Jamison's new plotless one-act jazz suite "HERE ... NOW." for
the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre. But this modern dance tribute
to selfless athleticism in general and female heroism in particular
borrowed so much from Joyner's unique achievements and persona that
its local premiere at the Capitol Theatre launched the performance
component of the city's 2002 Cultural Olympiad in a blaze of
reflected glory.</LD>
<LD>   The work was commissioned by the Salt Lake City Winter Games as
part of the Olympics' traditional component of an accompanying arts
festival. The work used a varied but invariably forceful jazz score
by Wynton Marsalis to propel six dancers through sequences titled
"Speed," "Strength," "Style," "Pain" and "Heaven." A neon-edged ramp
designed by Al Crawford (with a neon-edged moon above) created a
fantasy track on which Jamison's running poses and other adaptations
of sports moves projected strongly.</LD>
<LD>   She has described the work as honoring Joyner, who died in 1998,
but, says Jamison, it is "not about her life." All three women in the
Saturday cast shared the spotlight in episodes depicting the stress,
isolation and moments of triumphant affirmation in an athlete's
career.</LD>
<TE>   However, ponytailed Linda-Denise Fisher-Harrell emerged as the
closest to a Joyner surrogate, opening and closing the work with a
stately walk across the stage, later observing the others as if
remembering her past and always wearing the signature one-legged
outfits that Joyner once called an "athletic negligee."</TE>
<TE>   Glints of Joyner's lifelong quest for absolute parity with men
surfaced in a double trio in which the women repeatedly matched the
power and bravado of their male counterparts. And since Joyner's
husband was also her coach, the intimate yet often oppressively
manipulative "Pain" duet for Bahiyah Sayyed-Gaines and Glenn A. Sims
made a potent statement about personal relationships that force
professional growth.</TE>
<TE>   The playful "Style" duet by Dwana Adiaha Smallwood and Clifton
Brown portrayed a happier, easier intimacy, and the final "Heaven"
duet for Fisher-Harrell and Matthew Rushing showed athletes as
secular angels, with Emilio Sosa's costumes layering golden Olympic
rings over bare flesh.</TE>
<TE>   Flawless in serene self-sufficiency, the dancing here evoked
stanzas in "Glory," the poem by U.S. poet laureate Robert Pinsky
(also commissioned by the 2002 Olympics) that celebrates athletes
striving:</TE>
<TE>   To animate the air with dancing</TE>
<TE>   feet raising</TE>
<TE>   A golden pollen of dust: a pervasive</TE>
<TE>   blur</TE>
<TE>   Of seedlets in the sunlight,</TE>
<TE>   whirling--beyond mere</TE>
<TE>   Victory or applause or</TE>
<TE>   performance,</TE>
<TE>   As victory is beyond defeat.</TE>
<TE>   A darker vision of prowess fueled "Following the Subtle Current
Upstream," the first creation for the Ailey company by Bay Area
ballet choreographer and LINES company director Alonzo King.</TE>
<TE>   Against recordings by Zakir Hussain, Miguel Frasconi and Miriam
Makeba that generated a disarming mix of idioms and textures, the
dancing evolved from a taut men's trio (highly compressed in ideas,
especially in the brief, overlapping solos) to fast, expansive
fireworks for the full 13-member cast. The smoky darkness of the
stage, however, drained any sense of celebration from the dancing and
left it instead a cascade of beauty, energy, and limitless skill in a
threatening void.</TE>
<TE>   Although his title refers to spinal flow in yoga, King's movement
language increasingly emphasized classical steps and
positions--particularly in solos for Sayyed-Gaines (to bell tones)
and Fisher-Harrell (to vocal music).</TE>
<TE>   Africanisms and twisty modern-dance torso action sometimes
seasoned the vocabulary, and nobody reveled in the changes of context
more than Clifton Brown, exemplary throughout the Saturday program
but released by King's eclecticism to an incandescent versatility
upstream.</TE>
<TE>   Rushing also danced impressively all evening long, sharing a
moonstruck balletic duet here with Linda Celeste Sims, but also
developing an exciting personal chemistry with Fisher-Harrell in
"HERE ... NOW." Their hottest moment, early on, came when they
crouched, Olympic style, as if waiting for the signal to run--right
at each other, hungrily. Along with Brown and a host of Ailey
colleagues, both of them made memorable contributions to the
evening's finale: the inescapable, undimmable "Revelations."</TE>
<TE>   Rushing brought great dignity and technical control to the "Wade
in the Water" baptism scene opposite Smallwood, while Fisher-Harrell
displayed radically extreme backbends in the elegiac "Fix Me Jesus"
duet, partnered by Amos J. Machanic Jr. Jeffrey Gerodias' muscular
pulses in the contemplative "I Wanna Be Ready" solo also defined a
new level of Ailey company sharpness, and the audience, as usual,
went berserk. Salt Lake City knows champions first hand, and these
needed no medals to prove themselves world class.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Olympic Arts Festival performances continue throughout the Games
and into March; art exhibitions associated with the festival extend
into September. The Ailey company dances again on Tuesday and
Wednesday at the George S. and Dolores Dore Eccles Center for the
Performing Arts. Information: (801) 355-2787.</TE>

<HD>One Plus One Yields Many Different Sums</HD>
<DH>In the comic 'Stones in His Pockets,' two actors portray 13
characters. It's fun until an awkward turn toward the serious.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>More than anything else, "Stones in His Pockets" is about the fun of
performance. Two actors play 13 characters: male and female, young
and old, of at least three nationalities.</LD>
<LD>   As long as the actors are proficient and versatile, as are Bronson
Pinchot and Christopher Burns at the Old Globe Theatre, laughs will
follow. At one point during Friday's opening performance, Pinchot
even led the yuks, breaking character briefly because he couldn't
keep a straight face. Because the scene was broadly comic, the
audience simply laughed all the more.</LD>
<LD>   Marie Jones' play, however, is supposed to be more than funny.
It's also about the shattered, media-fed fantasies of Irish villagers
and the arrogance of Hollywood imperialism. This theme isn't
especially fresh--"The Cripple of Inishmaan" also tackled it a few
years ago. And on the serious side of its ledger, "Stones in His
Pockets" doesn't really work.</LD>
<TE>   We're in a village in County Kerry, where a big-budget film crew
has arrived to shoot "The Quiet Valley," featuring the American
superstar Caroline Giovanni. Jones focuses on two extras, both in
their 30s.</TE>
<TE>   Jake (Burns) is a local who has just returned from a couple of
fruitless years in America. Charlie (Pinchot) owned an independent
video store in another part of Ireland, but he was recently driven
out of business by a big chain and has resorted to roaming around the
country with a tent.</TE>
<TE>   Pinchot also plays Giovanni, with a Southern American
accent--"y'all" and all. His other major assignments are the
hard-boiled assistant director Simon, the older but only slightly
courtlier English director Clem and a poorly defined teenager named
Fin.</TE>
<TE>   Burns plays the other female role, an ambitious 20-year-old third
assistant director who directly supervises the locals, plus
Caroline's accent coach, the film's oldest extra and its most
problematic extra, troubled teenager Sean.</TE>
<TE>   Sean is problematic not only in his life--he's a drug abuser whose
family farm is on the skids--but also as a character within the
script.</TE>
<TE>   He carries a heavy-duty burden as the keystone of the play's
tragic elements. He's actually the title character--the stones were
in his pockets--yet he is given very little time in which to develop
beyond his symbolic boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   We later hear that Charlie was equally troubled when he was
younger. This revelation might have shifted some of Sean's burden
onto the shoulders of one of the leading characters, but it's too
vague and brief to matter.</TE>
<TE>   The script deteriorates in the second act. A sudden burst of Irish
dancing that's required of the extras in the second act is designed
to please the theater crowd--and succeeds in that goal. But it's
totally out of the blue. There is no hint that the extras have been
told they would do it, let alone rehearsed it, yet suddenly they're
performing it as if they're accomplished dancers, not mere extras.</TE>
<TE>   The final plot twist is as implausibly upbeat as the ending of
"The Quiet Valley" itself--the sort of ending that Jones generally
mocks.</TE>
<TE>   The flaws in the script are more obvious the second time around (I
saw a San Francisco production in 1999). First-timers will surely
enjoy parts of "Stones." The sights of Pinchot seductively sashaying
as Caroline, or Burns maniacally shoveling turf for the cameras, are
guaranteed laughs.</TE>
<TE>   The play's original director, Ian McElhinney, is still in charge.
Lined across the back of Jack Kirwan's set is a row of about 30 pairs
of shoes, signifying the many characters, though the actors use only
a small fraction of them. A vista of clouds on a backdrop that looks
like enlarged film stock adds some dimension.</TE>
<TE>   A prologue in which voices evoke the trailers prior to a movie in
an Irish cinema seems superfluous. The play would be better if it
were about 15 minutes shorter.</TE>

<HD>Women Wow on Handel's Stage</HD>
<DH>Led by Vivica Genaux, the distaff element shines in San
Diego's somewhat stiff 'Ariodante.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>In 1966, New York City Opera mounted a momentous production of
Handel's "Julius Caesar." It made a star of Beverly Sills, and it
began a Handel revival that continues to this day. By now, nearly
every self-respecting opera company makes room for Handel. Los
Angeles Opera's "Julius Caesar" last season was a hit; San Francisco
Opera stages the opera in June.</LD>
<LD>   But until Saturday, San Diego Opera, which was formed in 1964,
resisted all Handelian temptation. Its new production of "Ariodante"
at Civic Theatre is the first professional Handel staging in San
Diego, and the company seems to have approached it gingerly,
reminding opera-goers in its publicity that there is more to Handel
than "Messiah."</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, there is. And "Ariodante," only one of dozens of great
Handel scores, is hardly unknown. It has caught the attention of some
of today's most impressive singers and directors. There are
outstanding competing recordings of the complete opera with Lorraine
Hunt and Anne Sofie von Otter in the title role. A theatrically
compelling, even shocking, video of David Alden's English National
Opera production is available on DVD.</LD>
<TE>   The production in San Diego, by John Copley, was created by the
Dallas Opera for exciting young singer Vivica Genaux, with New York
City Opera as another co-producer. That alone should be attraction
enough for San Diegans. An unknown when she made her debut with the
company five years ago in Rossini's "The Italian in Algiers," she
immediately won over just about everybody and has been back often.
Now, the world knows the agile 34-year-old mezzo-soprano as a rising
star. Her singing Saturday was spectacular. With nearly as impressive
performances from two sopranos, Rosemary Joshua and Christine
Brandes, this was a wonderful evening for female voices.</TE>
<TE>   But for every right in its "Ariodante," San Diego found a
corresponding wrong. The production almost willfully ignores the
dramatic possibilities in both a theatrically able cast and the opera
itself.</TE>
<TE>   Handel's tale is of the love between the Scottish princess Ginevra
and the knight Ariodante. The King approves the marriage and of
Ariodante as successor to the throne. But the lovers are
self-involved, immature. They are tested by jealousy when an
Iago-like schemer, Polinesso, deceives Ariodante, which leads to
Ariodante's suicide attempt and Ginevra's madness. A happy ending
comes about less through Polinesso's defeat than it does through
painful self-searching. Ginevra's passage from frivolous beauty to
wise woman is portrayed in powerfully expressive arias, as is
Ariodante's passage from superficial youth to responsible leader.</TE>
<TE>   Copley's staging is minimalist historical costume pageant. Against
John Conklin's set of movable marble walls and illuminated screen
with images of sea and sky, characters in Michael Stennett's
sumptuously draped costumes assume stock gestures more or less in the
antiquated style of Handel's time. This is theater not so much
historically correct as casting a knowing glance back at history, in
the process distancing us from direct, affecting, potentially
devastating drama.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is Handel trusted. One of the reasons Handel's operas have
caught on has been that they are now seen as more than mere
opportunities for vocal display. They are long, and the succession of
ornamental arias can seem deadly on stage. But they also give the
modern director the luxury of time in which to explore deeply a
character's emotions and motivations.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego's "Ariodante" did just the opposite. The score was
streamlined in places, and sometimes the most astonishing places.
Removed from the end of the second act, for instance, was the
metaphorical ballet in which Ginevra descends into madness and Handel
radically brings the curtain down following a recitative, leaving the
audience in musical suspension.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, madness was represented by a couple of horses' heads
descending on the stage.</TE>
<TE>   Musically, the performance followed some aspects of period
practice, to both good and bad effect. The orchestra mimicked well
the sounds of Baroque instruments, and the Irish conductor, Kenneth
Montgomery, chose the bracing tempos that modern scholarship favors.</TE>
<TE>   But his attention seemed more directed to the pit than the stage;
some tempos were so fast that singers were forced to drop all
pretense of acting to concentrate on their impossible florid vocal
acrobatics.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Genaux was a thrilling, vocally triumphant Ariodante.
Joshua offered a gorgeously nuanced Ginevra. Brandes demonstrated a
powerful capacity for outrage as Dalinda, Ginevra's maid, who is
seduced by Polinesso. Countertenor David Walker, however, has an
unfinished technique, and it was hard for much malice to surface in
his Polinesso when he spent so much effort simply trying to keep up
with the conductor (however well he pranced about the stage). Tenor
Bruce Fowler (Ariodante's brother Lurcanio) was hard-pressed as well.
Julien Robbins was the moderately sonorous King.</TE>
<TE>   The chorus had a very small part but struggled nonetheless in its
rush to the finish.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Ariodante" continues Tuesday at 7 p.m., Friday at 8 p.m. and Feb.
17 at 2 p.m., $33-$107, Civic Theatre, San Diego (619) 570-1100.</TE>

<LD>Forget Salt Lake City. The real Olympics, in the minds of more than 4
million Americans, is the 126-year-old Westminster Kennel Club Dog
Show. It's the Super Bowl of canine competition--the oldest
continuous sporting event in America except for the Kentucky Derby.
It can be seen tonight and Tuesday at 8 on the USA Network.</LD>
<LD>   The show provides a glimpse into the rarefied world of dog
breeding, where the egos and fortunes of owners are inextricably tied
to their pets.</LD>
<LD>   It's also the ultimate reality programming, with a huge dose of
humor--a slice of Americana expertly spoofed in Christopher Guest's
movie "Best in Show."</LD>
<TE>   Formally dressed handlers trot dogs with names like Sir Lancelot
of Barvan or St. Margaret Magnificent of Clairdale around the ring,
to be scrutinized by poker-faced judges. Though the proceedings are
monitored with an iron hand, expect the unexpected.</TE>
<TE>   Who can forget the short-haired German pointer who left two
deposits on the carpet in 1999 as her mortified handler looked on?
(The feat propelled her into the pages of Newsweek and the stand-up
routines of Conan, Leno and Letterman.) Or the tiny papillon who,
later that night, put one paw on the victory cup, rotated its head
from side to side and soaked up the cheers of the star-studded crowd?
Having snatched the top spot from 2,500 competitors, the pooch was
milking the moment, clearly aware she was champ.</TE>
<TE>   I plan to make the telecast the centerpiece of my night--providing
Luc, my Wheaton Terrier-Standard Poodle mix, gives the OK. Overly
poofed and sculpted purebreds are an acquired taste, he's
convinced--definitely overrated. He'd prefer we tune into the
figure-skating competition--or, better yet, "24."</TE>

<HD>An Unfinished Canvas</HD>
<DH>Art* At 98, artist Bernarda Bryson Shahn remains engaged in
the world, keeping up on current events and finishing works she began
years ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMY WESTFELDT</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>ROOSEVELT, N.J.</DL>
<LD>In a white shed filled with memories, Bernarda Bryson Shahn is
touching up a painting she started 20 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   "When I finish it, I think I'm going to like it," she says,
staring at the canvas of a woman standing on Rome's Appian Way.</LD>
<LD>   In her spare time, she's doing a little light reading: Hegel's
dialectic, a work she read in college but didn't enjoy. She thought
she'd give it another try.</LD>
<TE>   Shahn, after all, hasn't been to college for nearly 80 years. The
widow of 1930s artist Ben Shahn forged an impressive career of her
own: painting, completing public murals, illustrating books such as
"Wuthering Heights."</TE>
<TE>   She turns 99 next month. And after all these years, she's still
curious and active enough to keep creating, even on a canvas she
started decades earlier.</TE>
<TE>   A retrospective of her work runs through March 8 at the Ben Shahn
Gallery at William Paterson University in Wayne, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in a sun-filled room surrounded by her work, Shahn offers
few secrets to her longevity.</TE>
<TE>   "I drink wine and eat potatoes," she says with a laugh. She thinks
she has a happy disposition, but "if you think you're going to live a
happy life, forget it."</TE>
<TE>   Shahn is simply an artist, motivated by the images that pass
before her eyes, and by her imagination. This has been her driving
force as long as she can remember.</TE>
<TE>   As a child in Athens, Ohio, her father would give her colored
chalk. She used it to draw on the walls of her bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   At night, she would go to sleep listening to her parents
recounting Homer's "Odyssey." They would recite "The Rime of the
Ancient Mariner."</TE>
<TE>   The exploits she read about were fuel for her drawings.</TE>
<TE>   She tries to explain her passion.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something that gets hold of you," she says. "If you're not
doing it, you want to be doing it."</TE>
<TE>   After studying painting, printmaking and philosophy at Ohio State
University, Shahn indulged in another passion--writing.</TE>
<TE>   She wrote news articles on the arts for the Ohio State Journal and
in the 1940s wrote and illustrated the children's books "The Zoo of
Zeus" and "Gilgamesh."</TE>
<TE>   Her artistry ranged from lithographs portraying the decline of the
American frontier to the sketches illustrating Emily Bronte's
"Wuthering Heights," and portraits of celebrities interviewed in
Parade, Fortune and Scientific American.</TE>
<TE>   She met Ben Shahn in 1932 while interviewing Diego Rivera in New
York City, and they drove together across the country.</TE>
<TE>   It was during their trip that Ben Shahn captured images of the
Depression and collaborated on two murals, one of which was their
hometown in Roosevelt.</TE>
<TE>   From New Deal Utopia</TE>
<TE>   to an Artists' Colony</TE>
<TE>   The community, named after former President Franklin D. Roosevelt,
was one of several New Deal utopias founded by garment workers.</TE>
<TE>   It later became a sort of artists' colony.</TE>
<TE>   Widowed since 1969, Shahn lives today with her granddaughter
Amanda, also an artist, in the home she and her husband purchased.
Their son Jonathan, a sculptor, lives next door.</TE>
<TE>   Shahn is completely engaged in the world, eager to talk politics
and art. She spends her days reading and working in the studio behind
her home.</TE>
<TE>   She walks without use of a cane. Little betrays her age, besides a
hearing aid and an extraordinarily well-lined face.</TE>
<TE>   Her work is still informed mostly by people's day-to-day lives and
hardships.</TE>
<TE>   "I have always been aware of how people are living," she says,
leaning forward in her chair. "What are people being eaten up by?"</TE>
<TE>   Besides the "unfinished" canvas of the woman in Rome, several
drawings line the walls of her studio: politicians testifying during
the Watergate hearings. Their hands cover their mouths. She plans to
add Richard Nixon to complete the work.</TE>
<TE>   At least 60 of Shahn's works are on display at William Paterson.
The art spans about 80 years and includes early etchings from the
Depression and illustrations from her books.</TE>
<TE>   Also included is a favorite of Nancy Einreinhofer, director of
Shahn Gallery. "Passage" is a portrait of a female figure cloaked in
a sheet, moving through a landscape.</TE>
<TE>   "It's somewhat anonymous, but moving forward," Einreinhofer said.</TE>
<TE>   She believes it is Shahn's self-portrait.</TE>

<HD>Police Chief Stars in This 'Survivor'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Al Martinez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I'm about to propose a new television series to CBS about three
people in public office who are challenged to remain in office while
undergoing a series of obstacles that would easily destroy any
ordinary person. It will be called "Survivor: The City."</LD>
<LD>   As an example of how it would work, let's take a mythical person
and call him Bernard Parks, and let's say he's a police chief.</LD>
<LD>   In order to remain in office, he has to zoom past the snapping and
backbiting of those in his command, duck through a barrage of
poisoned arrows hurled by members of a police union, avoid the tiny
but painful darts of an opportunistic mayor and jump, leap and zigzag
over, around and through barriers placed in his path by various
racial, religious, political, professional, legal, educational and
journalistic factions.</LD>
<TE>   If he wins, he gets another five years in the job, during which he
will suffer the same painful and humiliating attacks, but at least
he'll get paid for it.</TE>
<TE>   I forgot to mention that while the mythical chief is trying to
survive, two others are on tracks beside him. One is a mythical
mayor, Little Jimmy Hahn, and the other the mythical head of a police
union, Mitzi Grasso.</TE>
<TE>   Their job in the contest is to trip, bump or otherwise impede the
progress of Parks in order to allow for their own survival at the end
of his race. Then they compete with each other, and whoever is left
standing wins the city.</TE>
<TE>   If anyone still wants it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Some of you may have noticed that I have fashioned "Survivor: The
City" roughly after the situation that exists today, in which a
police chief, coincidentally named Bernard Parks, has not pleased
everyone. When he walks into a room, 100% of those present in the
place do not simultaneously smile, applaud, pat him on the back and
sing his praises.</TE>
<TE>   But then, come to think of it, he doesn't need everybody. Even
though the job of chief affects the entire population of the city,
very few are given the opportunity to decide whether he's doing the
job he ought to be doing for the $250,000 a year he's being paid by
us taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   Those who make that determination are roughly the same groups of
people who thought Daryl Gates would be a great chief and then,
learning otherwise, had to finally bind and gag him and drag him out
of office by his feet when he wouldn't go. His "greatness" included
smashing in doors with a ramrodding tank, fiddling while L.A. began
burning in the 1992 riots and taking Nancy Reagan along on drug
raids.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Parks, however, Gates was adored by the troops in his
command, which shows that you can't trust the judgment of the rank
and file beyond deciding whether French fries are better with or
without ketchup. One of the criticisms of Parks is that he's aloof,
but since when does a general drink beer with the grunts in a
well-run army?</TE>
<TE>   I have never been asked, for instance, to vote on the permanency
of any of my editors, but I would probably vote against any one of
them who has ever criticized me in any way whatsoever.</TE>
<TE>   A series involving "Survivor: The Newspaper" would have to deal
with brooding, bad-natured, nit-picking guys like me. I shudder to
think of it. I've done pretty well with "Survivor: The Columnist,"
but who knows what barriers I still may be facing? I shudder to think
of that, too.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After Gates, during whose tenure four cops beat the hoo-ha out of
Rodney King, those in charge decided we needed an African American
chief, and in our wisdom we reached out to Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   And we got Wee Willie Williams. He seemed to come and go so fast I
can't even remember what he was like, except that he was jovial and
buddied around with the little people. But that didn't work either,
and out he went.</TE>
<TE>   So now we have Bernard Parks, whose term has been burdened by,
among other events, the Rampart scandal, and who isn't beloved by his
men and who has allowed crime to exist. Under Gates, you might
recall, we had no crime in the city, not a bit, not even a
shoplifting, but we canned him anyhow. It was that battering ram and
his endorsement of the chokehold that kept everything peaceful in the
streets, but not in City Hall. Had he been allowed to use the
battering ram on then-Mayor Tom Bradley, he might still be chief.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I doubt that when the Police Commission meets in May it will give
Parks another five years, and it'll be goodbye, Bernie.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, unlike Disney President Michael Ovitz, who was
canned after just 14 months in office, Parks won't receive a buyout
of $89 million. Maybe he'll get a plaque and a decent pension, but
that's about it.</TE>
<TE>   Then we'll go hunting again for a chief who will be loved by his
men, adored by the mayor, endorsed by the City Council, respected by
the people, feared by the criminals and followed by the paparazzi. He
must be part African American, part Mexican American, part Asian
American and possess a gay daughter, a physically disabled son and a
wife who looks like Halle Berry and sings mezzo-soprano in the church
choir. Anyone out there who meets these qualifications, please feel
free to apply. The Survivor Course is waiting.</TE>

<HD>Pick a Fight With Your Beloved--It Might Help</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHLEEN KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I confess, dear reader, that I have picked fights with my beloved
husband. I have picked fights over a few empty beer cans lined up
like sentries on our kitchen counter, steps from the recycling
container.</LD>
<LD>   I have picked fights over his trail of sandwich makings left out
in the kitchen for the flies to feast upon.</LD>
<LD>   I have picked fights when our dinner, timed to perfection, is
thrown off-kilter because he didn't ignite the gas grill when I asked
the first time. You get the idea.</LD>
<TE>   It's usually the small stuff that incites a quibble, some niggling
detail of life that gets thoroughly under the skin, or so it seems to
the person instigating the tiff. But picking a fight over something
inconsequential has its purpose in the world of couplehood.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, picking a fight often acts to obfuscate a more serious
underlying issue in a relationship, said Michele Baldwin, a
Chicago-based marriage and family therapist who teaches couples
classes with her psychiatrist husband.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't know how to talk about the big issues, like their
feelings about a partner working too much or a partner not feeling
valued enough ... so people pick on something that is a minor thing
to discharge tension," said Baldwin, who recalls that early in her
marriage she used to get "hysterical" to get her husband's attention.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, a partner who picks a fight is often motivated by good
intentions, said clinical psychologist Blaine Fowers, author of
"Beyond the Myth of Marital Happiness" (Jossey-Bass, 2000).</TE>
<TE>   Picking a fight may be an attempt to communicate a dislike or
resolve a conflict, to get an emotional reaction from an emotionally
distant mate or to get a partner to pay attention.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say that 99% of the time there is a good reason that we
pick a fight," said Fowers, an associate professor of counseling
psychology at the University of Miami.</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't that it is good to pick a fight with your partner, but
the underlying question is, 'What do I really want that is leading me
to pick this fight?' Most of the time what we want is a good thing.
We just go about it the wrong way."</TE>
<TE>   Jody and Kevin Rudy of West Los Angeles have been married for 11
years. Jody, 38, said that she picks fights with her husband to
resolve a conflict or in an attempt to get him to pay attention to
her or their children, Willy, 8, and Emma, 5.</TE>
<TE>   "The big one I pick is when he comes home from working all day and
we haven't seen him, and there is a big hockey game on--and they are
all big games to him--and he sits with a beer watching it, ignoring
everyone," Jody said. "Willy will say, 'Dad, look what I made....Look
what I did,' and he will say, 'Not now, Willy, five minutes and 26
seconds.' So I start a fight. I say, 'What is more important in your
life? Hockey or your children?'"</TE>
<TE>   Jody said that sometimes the fight forces a conversation that
might not have happened otherwise with a husband she describes as a
mellow, nonconfrontational guy.</TE>
<TE>   "There are better ways to communicate, but when you are at your
wits' end, you reach for anything, and picking a fight can be the
best defense," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Picking a fight is one way to get an unemotional partner to emote,
and likewise, it can create distance for a partner who feels crowded
or smothered, Fowers said. But in the long run, picking a fight can
backfire and be emotionally defeating.</TE>
<TE>   "If the purpose of a fight is to resolve something that is
bothering you, then you may never get there, and if you do, you are
both likely to be angry, which makes a positive resolution elusive,"
Fowers said.</TE>
<TE>   The best thing a fight-picker can do is "reflect later--when no
longer angry--about what it is he or she wants from the relationship
that is not there," Fowers said. "What people want to get away from
is blaming language, such as 'You failed me.' You want to say, 'There
is something I want with you rather than from you.'"</TE>
<TE>   This would be what John Gottman, a University of Seattle
psychologist, calls the conversation the couple never had but needs
to have. "After you have a fight, you are not done because you have
to talk about it," said Gottman, a leading researcher on the effects
of conflict on couples and co-founder of the Gottman Institute, which
offers therapy and educational materials to couples, therapists and
families. "You can do this with any fight."</TE>
<TE>   Gottman offered the example of a new mother who had given up a
successful graphic arts business to stay at home with her baby.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband, a successful executive, was taking care of the baby
one morning when she came downstairs to find the baby crawling around
the kitchen, where a drawer had been left open. She told her husband
to come and close the drawer. He said, "No, you're right there. You
do it." She proceeded to open all the drawers in the kitchen. He came
in and slammed all the drawers shut. Peeved, she took the baby and
went upstairs.</TE>
<TE>   "This woman needed to tell her husband that she feels he doesn't
respect or appreciate what she does at home," said Gottman, author of
"The Relationship Cure" (Crown, 2001). "He needed to say, 'Here is a
good way to influence me if you want me to do something.' They had
that conversation in the therapist's office."</TE>
<TE>   The reason the couple didn't have such a conversation at home,
Gottman said, is that neither partner grew up with positive parental
models of conflict resolution.</TE>
<TE>   Another theory of what predisposes one to a state of marital
truculence is general negativity.</TE>
<TE>   "Every couple is in one of two states, according to psychologist
Robert Weiss," said Gottman. "Weiss said that a person can be in
'negative sentiment override,' and the negativity overrides
everything and anything. Even a comment like 'Where is the mail?' can
spark a fight. Positive sentiment override is the reverse."</TE>
<TE>   The couples who are least likely to pick fights are those who
respond to each other's attempts to connect, which could be a touch
of the hand, an attempt at conversation or a request to spend more
time together. "When a partner is not emotionally available, a fight
is much more likely because it will get their attention," says
Gottman, whose research suggests that such couples draw from a
reservoir of goodwill so that when there is a fight, it is less
hurtful and resolution is easier.</TE>
<TE>   Among the ripe times for picking a fight are periods when a couple
is reunited after a separation or before a partner goes away.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone dealing with separation or return who notices that she or
her partner always pick a fight might want to make a playful thing
out of it, as in 'OK, let's have our fight,'" Fowers suggested. "One
person may get stuck with a lot of chores, and one may be doing a job
he doesn't really want to do for the income."</TE>
<TE>   As for myself, I shall begin rehearsing the conversation I never
had with my husband. It will be about how I feel unappreciated as the
domestic goddess in his life.</TE>
<TE>   I will tell him that one way he could show his respect, love and
appreciation for my fabulousness would be to put his empty beer cans
not near the recycling bin, but in the recycling bin. After which, in
a spirit of goodwill, I will fetch him a cold one on the spot.</TE>

<LD>CRAZY LOVE</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   By David Martin</LD>
<TE>   Simon &amp; Schuster</TE>
<TE>   288 pages, $23</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What happens when an attractive, well-educated Washington,
D.C.-based animal-rights lobbyist meets up with a big, lumbering,
oddball Appalachian farmer whose nastier neighbors consider him a
"retard"? The answer to this question is contained in the title of
David Martin's 10th novel, "Crazy Love."</TE>
<TE>   Shy, lonely Joseph David Long, more commonly known as "Bear," is
still a virgin at 32. Uncommonly hard-working but slow of speech,
Bear at first glance is not what an ambitious, clever, professional
woman like Katherine Renault would be looking for in a man. The lady
has come to the country to recuperate from a serious illness and
operation. She and Bear meet by chance, intervening to rescue a
mistreated cow. Beneath their apparent differences, the two have at
least one thing in common: They both can't abide cruelty to animals.</TE>
<TE>   It's clear that the perky city gal and the apple-cheeked country
fellow are destined for some kind of romance, especially after we
learn that she has a "perfect" fiance back in Washington who calls
her by all three syllables of her name "Kath-er-ine." (Bear calls her
"Katie," as in "Katydid.") It's pretty clear, too, who the bad guys
are: There's "Scrudde," for instance: "He was a sneaky little man,
age fifty-six, who had acquired a fortune through deceit--cheating
widows, for example. He seldom attacked directly but was relentless
on the back end of a deal, stabbing you with a lawyer if it came to
that. In his younger days he'd been notorious as a dog-poisoner."
When Bear and Katie come between Scrudde and his tormented cow, he
and his henchman, the aptly named Coote, plan their revenge.</TE>
<TE>   In his previous nine novels, including thrillers ("Lie to Me"),
mysteries ("Pelikan") and offbeat love stories ("The Crying Heart
Tattoo"), Martin has shown himself to be a natural storyteller with a
knack for mixing fantasy with reality. "Crazy Love" is chunky with
the gritty details of rural life--the filthy state of a house overrun
by cats, the violence of an assault, the swollen flesh of a wounded
animal or person--yet also manages to spin around them a sheer web of
fantasy, as Bear becomes able to hear--or imagine he can
hear--animals talk to him. Through the reality and fantasy alike runs
a vein of wry humor, softening the harshness of the one, tempering
the extravagance of the other.</TE>
<TE>   "Crazy Love" is a funny, touching--one might even say
sentimental--book about love in many forms: the love between a man
and a woman, the love shared by siblings, parents and children, the
devotion of pets to their masters, the good farmer's care for his
animals. Katie and Bear's romance is chronicled with folksy charm:</TE>
<TE>   "In the living room, Bear asked Katie to tell him the rules.</TE>
<TE>   "'What do you mean?'</TE>
<TE>   "'I do good with rules, tell me what they are and I'll follow
them.'</TE>
<TE>   "She still didn't know what he meant. 'Rules for what?'</TE>
<TE>   "'Loving you ... for how you and me can fall in love.'</TE>
<TE>   "Katie smiled thinly and wondered how the hell she was going to
get out of this without hurting his feelings. 'I'm not aware of any
rules for how people fall in love. Part of it is just the chemistry
between them.'</TE>
<TE>   "'You got the formula?'</TE>
<TE>   "'Bear, be serious.'</TE>
<TE>   "'I am. I am serious as a tree.'"</TE>
<TE>   There's more to Bear--and Katie--than first meets the eye. In the
course of their crusade to rescue mistreated animals, the two of them
also come to find a viable middle ground about the right way for
humans to treat other living beings. Some of the animal-rights people
Katie works with consider it wrong to harm or kill an animal for any
reason, including for food. Bear is a farmer who raises beef cattle.
But unlike some of the other farmers and pet owners in the area, Bear
believes that owning an animal doesn't convey the right to mistreat
it and that raising animals for eventual slaughter as meat doesn't
mean you have no obligation to provide them with happy and healthy
lives up until that point. Even so, Bear finds it's not always easy
to make the right decisions, as he reconsiders his past behavior
toward pests like groundhogs, bats and mice. And what is the right
response toward fellow humans who inflict violence?</TE>
<TE>   For all its easy humor and lightness of touch, Martin has written
a novel that takes on some serious matters. The inevitability of
death and the preciousness of life--its fragility and tenacity--are
present throughout. And, of course, "Crazy Love" is also a
celebration of love, but a celebration that recognizes the hard work
that goes into caring for or about any living creature.</TE>

<HD>These Decoys Fit the Artistic Bill</HD>
<DH>Utilitarian duck lures, when created by such woodcarvers as
Del Herbert, are things of beauty to collectors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURIE K. SCHENDEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Who could blame the ducks?</LD>
<LD>   Try putting your beak within a few inches of an elegantly crafted
decoy, with feathers so fine and skillfully painted it's hard to
believe it's actually made of wood. How can wildfowl on the fly a
hundred feet in the air tell the difference?</LD>
<LD>   They can't, of course, and that's the point. For thousands of
years, hunters have floated flocks of phony fowl with the hope of
luring their prey into range. But in the last half-century, the
current has shifted.</LD>
<TE>   Now the decoys are the hunted.</TE>
<TE>   Since the late 1950s and early '60s, interest has grown among
collectors for what Kenneth Trapp of the Smithsonian American Art
Museum says is truly an American art form. The oldest known decoys
are about 2,000 years old, constructed out of tule reeds and colored
with natural dyes by Native Americans. A dozen of them were
discovered in a Nevada cave in 1924. Today, antique decoys are
greatly valued; a wood decoy made in a factory in Detroit in the
1920s, which would have sold at the time for about $10, sold recently
for $354,000.</TE>
<TE>   Trapp, curator of the Smithsonian's Renwick Gallery in Washington,
D.C., landed a rig--a set of tethered decoys--two years ago for the
museum's permanent collection. The set was made by Del Herbert of
Chula Vista, one of the top U.S. woodcarvers. While looking through a
magazine, Trapp came across some of Herbert's carvings, which won the
1998 Ward World Championship, the top carving competition in the
country, and recognized them as "a particular genre in American craft
... they were just absolutely stunning."</TE>
<TE>   Herbert, 59, who took up woodcarving as a hobby, has trouble
seeing himself as an artist. "I'm an engineer by education," he says
modestly. "I worked for the Navy for 37 years." He took classes as a
beginning carver but concedes that he does have talent. "I was
reluctant to attribute any of my success to talent. I thought I was a
technician that worked hard.... But, nowadays, the competition is so
great, you have to be artistic, you have to be technically accurate
and you have to have a flair."</TE>
<TE>   It was about 20 years ago when Herbert turned a hunk of scrap wood
into a decoy for his wife, Judy. She wanted a duck for the mantel.
Since then, woodcarving has become a passion for Herbert, who is now
retired. He's known to his neighbors as "the duck man" and to the
wildlife-art world as one of its most talented.</TE>
<TE>   He spends 60 to 70 hours a week in his studio, an upstairs loft
that was once their two kids' bedrooms, in the home he and Judy have
shared for 33 years. The couple's vacations always include wildlife
art shows and speaking engagements around the country. In 1999,
Herbert published a how-to book, "Championship Service Class Shore
Birds."</TE>
<TE>   "Del is part of a whole phenomenon in our culture where people
retire and they start to work with their hands, whether it's turning
wood [on a lathe] or carving waterfowl or what have you, and they
find a new meaning in their life," says Trapp. He counts Herbert's
birds among the most meaningful pieces in the collection.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the genre, the fact that they're beautiful birds. I know the
tradition they come out of and that they reveal to our public what
people can do with their hands," Trapp says. "They're such a
beautiful part of the creativity and of the human spirit in
creativity."</TE>
<TE>   Herbert belongs to the Pacific Southwest Wildlife Arts
organization, which does count many retirees among its members. This
weekend, the club will host the 29th annual California Open 2002
Wildlife Arts Festival in San Diego. About 150 woodcarvers and two
dozen wildlife painters will compete, demonstrate or exhibit their
work.</TE>
<TE>   It may not be the best place for hunters to buy decoys, with
prices likely to range from about $800 to $20,000, says Mike Dowell,
the show chairman. But it's one of the best places to see the top
works--four championship winners are expected to attend.</TE>
<TE>   And who would get such valuable birds wet?</TE>
<TE>   "I'll go down right now and throw them in the pool," says Herbert,
explaining that floating the decoys in a water tank is part of the
judging at the shows. They are thrown in upside-down and scored on
how well they right themselves. "They have to pop over, and they have
to float right," as real ducks might get suspicious of a "duck"
floating on its side, says Herbert.</TE>
<TE>   Of the dozen or so decoy categories, the decorative category draws
in the most lifelike pieces. A decorative bird can take 200 hours to
carve and paint. "You carve the bird, you grind all the little
feathers with a high-speed grinder, and then we go back and burn it
with a wood burner so they really look like feathers," Herbert says.</TE>
<TE>   He prefers, however, to carve service-class birds, such as the
pintail hen and others that are used for hunting rather than
decoration. It takes about 20 hours to carve and twice that to paint.
"I can sell them all day long, for $1,000 or $1,200."</TE>
<TE>   Herbert is already booked with commissions through the end of
2002. Occasionally, he carves a decoy rig for a hunter, who will
actually put the decoys to use. "Plastic is so much more practical,"
Herbert says. "If you get a dozen of these, they weigh you down. If a
plastic one floats away, who cares?"</TE>
<TE>   But there's something special about using handcrafted decoys,
which can last for decades. "You're building a heritage if you hunt
over handmade decoys," Herbert says. "Someday someone's going to say,
'Grandpa hunted over these birds.' And if they're plastic birds,
nobody's going to care."</TE>

<LD>The Grand Tour</LD>
<LD>   If you could take a once-in-a-lifetime trip to any place in the
world, where would you go? In the 1700s, lots of young people in
England would have said they wanted to see Italy. In fact, so many
travelers went there that the trip to Italy was given a special
name--"the grand tour."</LD>
<LD>   The grand tour was a very long trip intended to complete a
person's education. It lasted at least a year, or as many as eight
years if part of the time was spent studying in another country along
the way.</LD>
<TE>   Grand tourists went to Italy to see famous artworks and the ruins
of ancient Rome and nearby Greece. They explored sites like the rim
of the volcano Vesuvius. When it erupted hundreds of years earlier,
in AD 79, the lava buried the nearby Roman city of Pompeii. Explorers
discovered the site of Pompeii in 1748, and travelers were eager to
see the ancient buildings and other things that had been buried for
so long by the lava. They also enjoyed festivals and daily life in
Italian cities.</TE>
<TE>   Grand tourists went home with more than an education. They
collected artworks, vases and gems to remind them of their trip and
to show friends and family back home. They also hired artists to
paint their portraits and the places they had visited.</TE>
<TE>   You can see an exhibition about the Grand Tour at the Getty (north
pavilion, plaza level). Be sure to get a copy of the Family Guide and
take your own Grand Tour around the museum. Children ages 12 and
younger are invited to stop by the information desk in the entrance
hall to receive a free pencil with a clear shaft that displays a tiny
rock collection.</TE>
<TE>   For more information or parking reservations, call (310) 440-7300
or visit www.getty.edu. Parking reservations are not needed Saturdays
and Sundays or after 4 p.m. weekdays.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In "The Key to Life? It's in a Handbag" (Feb. 1), Valli Herman-Cohen
says that she was not interested in the other trendy designer bags
because "they spoke of conformity." Somehow, her Dior bag is
different because its design is "very original."</LD>
<LD>   As often as she stresses that she is budget-conscious, her actions
beg the question. Even $200 sunglasses as a consolation prize seem
extravagant, but when you add a $1,200 piece of leather, I wonder
what "priceless lesson about life" was actually learned. She seems
more interested in the compliments received and the special treatment
encountered in other expensive boutiques.</LD>
<LD>   I think if Herman-Cohen wanted to be whimsical and original, she
should take some art classes and learn to create her own interesting
bags. What is really depressing is that she even acknowledges that
she could have put the $1,200 into her charitable donations or more
practical items, but instead, she now craves an "affordable" key
chain to go with her obscenely expensive handbag.</LD>

<TE>   I absolutely loved Herman-Cohen's story about the Dior purse. She
captured why a designer item can make you feel good and also tackled
my favorite topic of purses.</TE>

called me when they read the article to make sure I saw it.</TE>

<HD>Washington's Sarcasm Seemed to Be Lost</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I take strong exception to Gina Piccalo's coverage of the Los Angeles
Film Critics Assn. Awards ceremony Jan. 22 (City of Angles, Jan. 24).
Ms. Piccalo's remarks about comments made by Denzel Washington in
accepting his award for best actor and by me after Mr. Washington sat
down at his table cannot go unchallenged.</LD>
<LD>   Piccalo wrote: "Then, Denzel Washington surprised the crowd by
suggesting straight-faced that his award for best actor in 'Training
Day' should have been presented before [Sissy] Spacek's [award for
best actress]. 'Is that sexist or something?' he asked. After
Washington left the stage, the association's president, Jean
Oppenheimer, took the podium and sniped back: 'That was a real
electric performance.'"</LD>
<LD>   Piccalo seems to have been the only person in the room that night
who didn't realize that Mr. Washington's remarks were made in jest.
When Mr. Washington sat down at his table, I clearly remarked that I
personally had found the actor's performance in "Training Day" to be
electric, something that I feel so strongly about I even included the
compliment in my opening essay on the first page of the program, or
awards, brochure.</LD>
<TE>   I find the overall tone of Piccalo's article to be mean-spirited
and sarcastic, not at all in keeping with the mood of the room that
night.</TE>

<LD>Thank you for giving space and depth to such an interesting and
unusual story, "Singular Commitment" (Jan. 27) about Los Angeles art
collector Kourosh Larizadeh and his importance to the artwork of Mike
Kelley.</LD>
<LD>   Art collectors and their motivations come in many stripes. The
article profiled a person who collects art with the same passion and
purity that a fine artist must summon to create a work of art. How
noble Larizadeh is. How lucky artist Kelley is to have such a devoted
and pervasive supporter.</LD>

<LD>Sandy Banks' Jan. 27 column ("Proud to Be of Color, Yet Trying to Be
Color Blind") complains that when she was in school "our American
history lessons reduced my ancestors' stories to footnotes" and that
this caused her to feel "shame" and "hurt" and like she was in
"shackles."</LD>
<LD>   At least they got into the footnotes. I don't remember ever
reading or hearing the words "Jew" or "Jewish" in the 13 years I went
to public school.</LD>
<LD>   Despite that, I never felt shackled, shamed or hurt by my
education. On the contrary: I felt liberated. I already knew about,
and was proud of, my Jewish background--it was the non-Jews who
missed out by not learning about it.</LD>
<TE>   Perhaps Banks should blame her early lack of pride on something
other than the schools she attended.</TE>

<HD>After Sept. 11, More Couples Choose to Retie the Knot</HD>
<DH>'We've realized how fragile life is,' says one husband who
is renewing his vows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN GILMORE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>In the Tunnel of Love, a kitschy, cherub-painted carport illuminated
with hundreds of twinkling lights, Marla and Kevin Holden of
Westchester, N.Y., exchange rings, repeat their marriage vows and
softly begin to cry. It's a special day for the couple, but it's not
their first marriage. The Holdens were  married a year ago, but it's
been tough going, what with fertility treatments, a miscarriage and
grieving with family and friends affected by the terrorist attacks on
the World Trade Center.</LD>
<LD>   "I think we've realized how fragile life is. We saw so much," says
Kevin Holden after the couple paid $20 for the drive-thru ceremony.
"We want to symbolically move forward from this point."</LD>
<LD>   Most married couples never repeat their wedding vows--once is
enough is the prevailing theory. Hokey, a waste of time and money, a
desperate attempt to save a failing marriage defines many people's
way of thinking about it. OK, maybe hokey still applies, but could a
recommitment of a couple's love ever be a waste of time?</LD>
<TE>   The Holdens, it turns out, may not be  unusual. In fact, wedding
chapel directors from Gatlinburg, Tenn., to Las Vegas describe an
increase in vow renewals since Sept. 11, although no official
statistics exist to  confirm the trend because a license is not
required for such a ceremony. But those in the business of
marriage--from church officials to family therapists--agree the
attacks have had a powerful effect on personal relationships.</TE>
<TE>   "It was terrible to see so many people suddenly lose their
partners," said Diane Sollee, founder and director of
Smartmarriages.com, a Web site that acts as a clearinghouse for
information supporting healthy marriages. "A blow like this makes you
realize who you really value, and couples are finding they want to
celebrate their time together."</TE>
<TE>   Typically, say those in the field, couples who renew their vows
are  happily married people who never had the wedding they wanted or
who felt duty-bound to marry quickly before heading to war or having
a baby. There are also the sentimentalists who want to commemorate a
milestone anniversary. But today more couples are choosing to
celebrate their bond regardless of how long they've been together.
People need marital rituals, says William J. Doherty, author of "Take
Back Your Marriage: Sticking Together in a World That Pulls Us Apart"
(Guilford Press, 2001). We need rituals, he says, that express our
commitment to one another, rituals that look beyond Valentine's Day.</TE>
<TE>   So instead of an annual exchange of chocolates and roses, the
Holdens intend to renew their vows every year. Such a ritual, says
Doherty, not only provides a couple with the opportunity to reflect
on their relationship but reminds them that marriage is an ongoing
work.</TE>
<TE>   In December, on a remote stretch along the Maui coast, Marci Blaze
and Steve Levine of Venice Beach stood before a Hawaiian kuhina, a
female spiritual leader, and rededicated their lives to one another.
"Our first wedding was in Hebrew, and I told my husband I wasn't
really sure what I had agreed to," says Blaze. "Fifteen years ago, we
were married by someone else. This time we wrote our own vows, and we
really felt as though we married each other."</TE>
<TE>   Although the tropical setting is optional, renewals tend to be
small, with the focus on the vows not the event, says Greg Godek,
director of La Jolla-based Romance Research Institute, which holds
workshops on putting the romance back in a marriage. For Godek,
co-author of "1,001 Ways to Be Romantic" (Casablanca Press, 2001),
there is a  distinction between a renewal of vows and a second
wedding, the latter usually attended by more than 20 guests with the
emphasis on the party not the promise.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Valentine's Day, in a simple ceremony on the 80th
floor of the Empire State Building, Eileen and Charles Guigno will
join their family, and, with the skyline of a changed world behind
them, celebrate 35 years of marriage. They say they want to show
their children and grandchildren the way it should be.</TE>
<TE>   At the World Trade Center, the couple lost a nephew and a
neighbor, both firemen who were killed trying to save others. "You
kiss your loved ones goodbye in the morning, and you never know what
is going to happen," said Charles Guigno, who believes the vows
become more powerful when they are spoken in front of the people who
mean the most to you. "It strengthens the family bond."</TE>
<TE>   Recognizing that very need to strengthen the family, the Worldwide
Marriage Encounter, a nonprofit Christian organization dedicated to
enhancing the quality of marriage, successfully encouraged
legislators across the country to designate the second Sunday in
February as World Marriage Day. On Sunday, church communities from
coast to coast honored the state of marriage with workshops,
festivals and renewal ceremonies.</TE>
<TE>   Pansy and Winston Greene are leaders in the Worldwide Marriage
Encounter. Pansy was 16 and Winston 18 when they married against
their parents' wishes in downtown Los Angeles in 1956. It was a cold
and  functional ceremony performed by  a justice of the peace, they
say.</TE>
<TE>   After 20 years together, they realized that they  didn't know how
to talk to one another.  To better their relationship, they attended
a weekend marriage encounter where they learned the fundamentals of
husband-wife communication.  The weekend concluded with a renewal
Mass.</TE>
<TE>   Now married for 45 years, retired and living in Carson, the
Greenes have been leading marriage encounters for more than two
decades. At the end of each retreat, they renew their own vows. "I am
always reminded of how much I love Pansy," Winston Greene says.</TE>

<HD>Stilettos and the City: One Pointy Step at a Time</HD>
<DH>You can blame Sarah Jessica Parker--or you can start
practicing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN CARPENTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I try not to be swayed by peer pressure, but when I wore a pair of
beat-up platform boots to a trendy tapas dinner with a bunch of
stiletto-wearing girlfriends, I had to wonder: Was I really that out
of fashion?</LD>
<LD>   One downward and disapproving glance from the restaurant host
answered my question: Yes. Suddenly I was feeling so ... last
century. It was time, I decided, to investigate whether I should step
out of my Herman Munster-style monster shoes and enter the wildly
popular and precarious world of needle heels.</LD>
<LD>   I know I'm not the only one cursing Sarah Jessica Parker for this
unfortunate trend. I'm sure there are plenty of other women who are
having a hard time pushing their platforms to the back of the closet.
Women who enjoy the height, the intimidation factor, the rock 'n'
roll essence of a sole that appears to have been cut from the tire of
a Mack truck. Women who would sooner saw their wrists with a butter
knife than put on a pair of I'm-so-dainty-I-could-die spike heels. It
is for them that I confronted my own stiletto aversion, traipsing
around town and trying on shoes that could double as weapons.</LD>
<TE>   To set things straight, a stiletto is not any old high heel but
one with a specific, sculptured shape--a dangerously tall heel that
tapers down to an almost immeasurable point. That's what makes them
such a frightening shoe, one that becomes even scarier when coupled
with a toe so pointy it could pry off bottle caps. So it was with a
certain amount of trepidation that I stepped into the Charles David
boutique in Santa Monica, responding to the cluster of spiked boots
and sandals that beckoned from the window. In a best-case scenario,
I'd pinch a toe or twist an ankle. In the worst case, I'd succumb to
the whims of style, forfeiting my pride and maybe even a chunk of my
401(k) to buy something I'd previously scorned.</TE>
<TE>   Confirming my fears, I noticed, upon walking in, that whatever
platforms were there had long ago been relegated to the sale rack.
These days, at least at Charles David, it's all about "the mod" (a
plain-jane, calf-height 3-inch stiletto boot) and "the maze" (a
strappy stiletto sandal with a 2-inch heel). They're the best-selling
items in the store, according to manager Michelle Parker. I asked to
try on both, but there was one problem: How was I supposed to walk in
them? "The best thing to do is to wear them around the house when
you're ... cooking and cleaning," Parker said. "That's the best way
to get used to the feel of them and how high they are."</TE>
<TE>   I slipped on the boot and was surprised by how easy it was to get
around. Then again, it was only 3 inches high.  After years of
clomping here and there on a 4 1/2-inch wedge, under which the earth
practically trembled, I felt lighter. More feminine. Less Gene
Simmons, more Mariah Carey. I felt downright weird. Even worse, I
felt short.</TE>
<TE>   I wanted something taller, something dramatic, something that
would help me retain the skyscraper, six-foot status I'd achieved
with my platforms. Manolo Blahnik and Jimmy Choo? Too predictable. I
headed to Frederick's of Hollywood on Hollywood Boulevard. There, at
the back of the boutique, past the red lace teddies, purple boas and
flossy thong underwear, was a virtual stiletto emporium with more
than 50 styles.</TE>
<TE>   There was an entire wall of spike-heeled maribou mules, Lucite
sandals and shiny vinyl pumps, but my eye was immediately drawn to
something called the Ultimate 2000--a black patent leather stiletto
with a 6-inch heel, the shoe equivalent of a cliff.</TE>
<TE>   I asked to try one on in my usual size 9. Maria Negrete, the shop
manager, brought me a 10. Still, it didn't fit. "Most of the time,
with this type of heel, you go up two sizes," she told me. I tried an
11. (They carry them to a size 14.) Even then, my feet hurt, and I
hadn't even attempted to stand. Negrete extended a hand to help me
up. Like a newborn calf, I stood, I hobbled, I lurched. Then I caught
myself in the mirror. I looked ridiculous.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you think these are sexy?" I asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Not the way you're walking," Negrete answered.</TE>
<TE>   Some women try on the Ultimate 2000 and "it's like they're walking
in tennis shoes," Negrete said. They're the ones who know the secret:
Walk on your toes. But most women take two weeks to get it down.
Negrete recommends that newcomers practice while vacuuming,
presumably so they have something to lean on other than their
boyfriends.</TE>
<TE>   The math with stilettos goes something like this: Their
sexiness is in direct proportion to their height. Of course that ratio
implodes if you trip. So even though I got the height I wanted--hey,
I even gained a couple of inches--I walked out of Frederick's
empty-handed. Besides, patent leather and Lucite really aren't my
style.</TE>
<TE>   Next stop: Diavolina, a stiletto specialty shop on La Brea Avenue
that carries grape-colored ankle boots, Hubba-Bubba-pink slingbacks
and gold lame knee-high numbers with wings on the ankle, among other
things. On my way in, I almost fell over a pair of matching
leopard-pattern chairs in the shape of--you guessed it--stilettos.
Perhaps I'd found the right place.</TE>
<TE>   The trio of salespeople that day was wearing the latest
look--plumber-butt bluejeans and spiked heels. The mood music:
vintage '80s, a perfect soundtrack since the last time stilettos were
truly hot stuff was two decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   The stiletto first arrived on the scene in 1952, when Jayne
Mansfield and other sexpot Hollywood starlets adopted them and forged
the shoes' bad-girl rep. Falling out of favor in the '60s, they
re-emerged on the dance floor in the late '70s and early '80s. While
some would argue that stilettos have never gone out of style as a
dress shoe, over the last few years they have become increasingly
popular for casual daytime wear, especially in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   That's precisely why Evelyn Unguari opened Diavolina four years
ago. "I wanted shoes!" she said. Specifically, she wanted more
feminine, sexy shoes. In a word: stilettos.</TE>
<TE>   There's no denying spike heels are sexy. They create an instant
hourglass figure by arching the back, forcing the breasts and the
buttocks to protrude. They also elongate the body, making the waist
appear slimmer and the legs longer. That's to say nothing of the
calf, which also gets a shapely boost.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder they're so popular. Women can get a complete physical
overhaul for a fistful of twenties. Not a bad deal, unless you factor
in the doctor bills. Stilettos have been blamed for everything from
blisters and corns to stress fractures and swayback.</TE>
<TE>   But never mind that. Stiletto-wearing women are too busy reveling
in the attitude adjustment that is an instantaneous byproduct of
increased altitude. In spike heels, a woman doesn't just look sexier,
she feels sexier--and more confident.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people say that high heels feed a woman's alter persona,"
said Linda O'Keeffe, author of "Shoes" (Workman Publishing, 1996).
"Once she puts on a pair of high heels, she becomes the woman she
believes she really is."</TE>
<TE>   Which is precisely why I've resisted stilettos. To my mind, they
have a damsel-in-distress quality that makes me want to heave.
Stilettos are anti-feminist. Anything that hinders a woman's ability
to walk is disempowering. And anything that hinders my ability to
kick-start a motorcycle? Well, that's just unacceptable.</TE>
<TE>   I asked Unguari, "I can't ride my bike in these, can I?" She
insisted that I could, that girls all over Europe had no problem
reconciling their desire to ride bikes with their fetish for spike
heels. She saw it each time she crossed the Atlantic. That said, she
disappeared into the stockroom to bring me a pair of black boots with
a zipper that spiraled around the calf.</TE>
<TE>   They were so Marianne Faithfull with a millennial twist. I slipped
one on. These boots rocked. And they were comfortable. Should I?
Could I?</TE>
<TE>   At $348, I couldn't quite open my wallet, but my mind had been
opened to the possibility.</TE>

<LD>"So, Charles, what's a dragon got to do with New Year's? It isn't
even New Year's. Here it is February already."</LD>
<LD>   Grandma was cranky because she didn't want to go to the parade. I
pulled her hand to make her go faster. I wanted to see the dragon
dance.</LD>
<LD>   "Dragons I read about weren't any too friendly," she said as we
walked toward Main Street.</LD>
<TE>   "These are different dragons, Grandma. These are Chinese dragons.
My teacher, Miss Peng, says they are wise and strong and chase away
bad spirits or eat them up. That leaves all the good spirits for us.
Then we'll have a good year."</TE>
<TE>   I could see the booths set up all around the street now as we got
closer. There were Chinese paintings and calendars in the booths, and
I could smell delicious things cooking, and there were little tiny
trees and bamboo in pots to sell.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what she says, hah?" said Grandma. "We didn't have Chinese
New Year parades in our town when I was a little girl."</TE>
<TE>   Grandma kept talking to herself as we walked among the booths.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, look at here," Grandma said. "A taco stand! That's not
Chinese."</TE>
<TE>   "Look, Grandma, this is dragon's beard candy. Can I have some?
Miss Peng told us about it."</TE>
<TE>   "All right, child."</TE>
<TE>   "And a sesame seed bun?"</TE>
<TE>   "I guess so, long as we've come, but that's all, you hear?"</TE>
<TE>   I pulled Grandma over to the curb with the other people, then
looked down the street for the dragon. The parade hadn't started yet.
The dragon was going to dance in the New Year's parade.</TE>
<TE>   "First it's your daddy going to that kung fu class. Now it's New
Year's parades here in February. Things sure are changing."</TE>

<HD>A Little Risky and Wry</HD>
<DH>Calvin Trillin's latest novel reflects the author's
characteristic blend of New York attitude and Midwestern sensibility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL J. YBARRA</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>It's 11:30 a.m. and Calvin Trillin slides into a booth at the Fog
City Diner and orders scotch and water. The waitress asks what kind
of scotch he would like.</LD>
<LD>   "Any rotgut," he replies, before launching into a typical
self-deprecating spiel. "People switched to white wine," he says. "I
stuck with scotch. People switched to marijuana. I stuck with scotch.
People switched to Perrier. I stuck with scotch. So now people can
point to me sodden in the corner and say, 'There's a man of
character.'"</LD>
<LD>   Trillin, of course, is quite a character. He's a peripatetic
author, who has called the New Yorker home for 40 years, crafting wry
pieces on everything from crime to food to memoir to fiction. He once
said that he would want his obituary to read that he was the funniest
man named Calvin.</LD>
<TE>   Although he went to Yale and has lived most of his life in
Manhattan, Trillin's sensibility remains that of a Missouri-bred son
of a grocer who might live in the Village but isn't likely to be
mistaken for a native. For one thing he owns a car. "If you find
someone in the U.S. who is an adult and doesn't drive," he says,
"they're a New Yorker."</TE>
<TE>   He drains his scotch and orders a beer.</TE>
<TE>   Part of Trillin's Midwestern upbringing (see his book "Messages
from My Father") is a reluctance to waste anything, whether it's the
last spoonful of his tortilla soup or an idea. In 1985, for instance,
Trillin wrote a short story for the New Yorker about a man who parks
a car and sits in it for no apparent reason. Now he's written an
entire novel about that guy, the recently published "Tepper Isn't
Going Out" (Random), which he is touring to promote.</TE>
<TE>   "I kept thinking one day I'd write a novel and find out what he
was doing," Trillin says. "I had a couple of false starts--and,
depending on whom you listen to, a false finish. A parking novel is a
pretty dubious venture."</TE>
<TE>   Murray Tepper is the retirement-age owner of a mailing list
company who (like Trillin) keeps his car in a garage but regularly
goes out and parks his Chevrolet Malibu on the street, loads up the
meter and proceeds to read the newspaper, unmindful of the catcalls
of angry drivers looking for parking. "Without looking up from his
newspaper," Trillin writes, "he would flick his fingers in the
direction of the inquiring parker. It had taken some time to find
precisely the right velocity of flickering--a movement that contained
authority but lacked aggression."</TE>
<TE>   Trillin digs into a plate of Chinese chicken salad.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to say I was the guy in the car," Trillin says. "But I
was one of the guys circling, [ticked]-off at that guy. You pass
these guys all the time. Who is he? What is he doing?"</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, in New York, Tepper becomes a celebrity. An alternative
newspaper writes a story about him. People line up at the curb to
seek his Delphic advice. "There's always something," is about as
helpful as it gets. A publisher guarantees him a series of
bestsellers.</TE>
<TE>   The crowds bring down the wrath of authoritarian Mayor Frank
Ducavelli (think Rudy Giuliani on a bad day before Sept. 11), who
bans people from stepping into the street to hail a cab and orders a
dress code for public parks. The celebrity parker then becomes a
cause celebre.</TE>
<TE>   "Could I get some jalapeno cornbread, please?" Trillin asks the
waitress. "I want it bad."</TE>
<TE>   The book was in the proof stage when the terrorist attacks
occurred and Trillin made some minor changes to place the story
before those events. "I changed probably 100 words," he says. "Just
so people didn't think Sept. 11 was going to come in the middle of
the book."</TE>
<TE>   That triggers a rare moment of seriousness.</TE>
<TE>   "I assumed that Sept. 11 had destroyed the book along with a whole
lot of things more important," Trillin says.</TE>
<TE>   "But New York now is not that different from what's in the book.
An event of that magnitude becomes a clause in every story," Trillin
says. "Since no one can write anything without saying, 'since Sept.
11,' it may give the impression that New York has changed more than
it has. I don't find it different now."</TE>
<TE>   A more personal tragedy occurred the next day when Trillin's wife,
Alice, died after a long fight with lung cancer. Alice Trillin, a TV
producer and writer, was well-known to her husband's readers as his
muse and foil in such books as "Alice, Let's Eat."</TE>
<TE>   "I wrote this for Alice," is the dedication in "Tepper."
"Actually, I wrote everything for Alice," it continues.</TE>
<TE>   The couple had two daughters, Abigail and Sarah, one now a
children's advocate lawyer in San Francisco, the other a social
worker in Los Angeles. Trillin seems somewhat confused how his
daughters developed such social consciences. Every morning at
breakfast, he remembers, he used to read them the weather report and
the starting salary at a big New York law firm.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it has something to do with the fact that their father
writes for the left-leaning magazine the Nation. (He pens perhaps the
only weekly current events poem published in the country.)</TE>
<TE>   "I write for the Nation," Trillin says, "because it's the closest
magazine to my house."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, like a true son of the Midwest, Trillin insists on the
right to drive his VW Passat when he leaves his house, as when he
ventures uptown for a reading group that sometimes meets in the
apartment of some of its members on the Upper West Side, where
parking is not good. "They're nice people," Trillin says. "But I've
asked them to drop out of the group or move."</TE>
<TE>   Even leaving New York offers no surcease from the pain of
parking--especially when, as is often the case, Trillin is looking to
park so that he can eat.</TE>
<TE>   "Dim sum time in Chinatown is particularly bad," he says of San
Francisco. "So is burrito time in the Mission. Last night we found a
great parking spot and I said, 'Now the burritos will have to be
really great to beat that.'"</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps not surprisingly, Trillin was once co-editor of a
publication called Beautiful Spot: A Magazine of Parking. The first
issue was published in 1962. So was the last one.</TE>
<TE>   "The second issue hasn't come out yet," Trillin admits. "We've had
some production difficulties. We hope to get it out very soon."</TE>

<LD>As Valentine's Day looms, many of us are mulling and musing: "How
much do I love him? How much does she love me? Are we right for each
other? Will it work out?" We should all stop obsessing and get
scientific.</LD>
<LD>   There are "love scales" to measure that kind of thing--and
equations, flow charts, Venn Diagrams, a passel of different-shaped
triangles and symbols. This I learned by flipping through the 383
pages of "The Psychology of Love" (Yale University Press, 1988) and
The Encyclopedia of Human Emotions (Macmillan Reference USA,
1999)--which summarize the history of love research.</LD>
<LD>   Want to know if your dalliance with that handsome chap will wither
on the vine or flower like a rose in June? Try plopping various
numbers into the "Byrne reinforcement model of interpersonal
attraction" (the formula shown in the accompanying illustration)
where PR=positive reinforcement, NR=negative reinforcement, and
Y=attraction. (Love flourishes, says the formula, when we are
rewarded for loving.)</LD>
<TE>   Then there's Yale University psychologist Robert Sternberg's
Triangular Theory of Love. It measures what Sternberg deems love's
three essential ingredients: passion, intimacy and
decision/commitment. And it tells you how well your triangle matches
your partner's. Poets have been emoting about love for eons, but
psychologists only got serious about studying it in the early 1970s,
when University of Michigan graduate student Zick Rubin created the
first psychological scale for romantic love--a questionnaire that
measured how much in love someone was--that was used in later studies
of hundreds of students. Since then, though, there's been an
explosion of love research, and a literature peppered with more
definitions of love than you can shake a stick at--making for mighty
confusing reading. Sigmund Freud believed feelings of love sprouted
out of unfulfilled sexual desire. Others have tried to tally how many
types and styles of love there are and have viewed love through many
a lens:</TE>
<TE>   * As an attachment very similar to what babies feel for their
parents. Scholars cite long lists of similar behavior between moms
and babies and between a doting couple--the propensity to coo at each
other, stare adoringly into each other's eyes, to get anxious when
apart.</TE>
<TE>   * As a physiological reaction--arousal--caused by release of
chemicals like adrenalin. Such arousal is also caused by other
emotions like fear, excitement and anger. Psychologists have designed
lots of wacky-sounding experiments to test their theories. In one,
men crossing either an unsafe, rickety bridge or a safe, stable
bridge were met by an attractive woman who gave her phone number. Men
crossing the rickety bridge were more likely to call the woman, as if
their arousal from fear had "primed" them for passion. Other studies
showed that men are more likely to feel strong emotions toward women
if they've just exercised, been insulted or listened to comedy
routines.</TE>
<TE>   * As an evolved mechanism to help people reproduce. By this way of
thinking--since raising a child is expensive but sperm is
plentiful--women want men with resources to help raise their kids
while men want to impregnate as many women as they can. Thus, women
should fall for men with money (and men should make a big point of
flaunting "displays" like Rolex watches and flashy cars) while men
will court women who are youthful and presumably fertile (explaining
the booming cosmetics industry).</TE>
<TE>   * As a learned response. If something's associated with good
feelings, you learn to like it and seek it. (Just like Pavlov's dogs
learned to associate food with ringing bells.) Thus, some authors in
the '70s advised wives to greet husbands with slippers, martinis and
spotless homes to make them associate coming home to the wife with
pleasant things.</TE>
<TE>   * As an undesirable addiction. The passionate love idealized by
Hollywood is bad news, argued some psychologists. It blots out the
world just as lust for heroin does to a junkie--and similar chemicals
and brain regions could be fueling both behaviors. Prescriptions
offered by experts for those prone to obsessive love: Get involved in
worthy occupations. Be loyal to friends. And read a daily newspaper.</TE>

<HD>Researchers Locate Gene for Deadly Kidney Disorder</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mayo Clinic researchers have identified the gene for a lethal kidney
disorder that kills several hundred infants in the United States each
year.</LD>
<LD>   The disease is called autosomal recessive polycystic kidney
disease--which means that a child must inherit a copy of the gene
from each parent to develop the disorder. Sometimes also called
infant polycystic kidney disease, the condition is characterized by
multiple fluid-filled cysts in the kidney and fibrosis in the liver,
and affected infants usually die before birth or shortly afterward.</LD>
<LD>   Although only an estimated one in every 10,000 to 20,000 children
is born with the disorder, the odds of developing it are one in four
when both parents carry the gene.</LD>
<TE>   Identification of the gene will lead to a better understanding of
how the disease progresses and may lead to the first effective
treatment. It will also allow effective prenatal testing.</TE>
<TE>   More than seven years ago, German scientists narrowed the search
for the gene by concluding that it is located on chromosome 6, one of
the 23 pairs of chromosomes that make up the human genetic blueprint.
Dr. Peter C. Harris and his colleagues at Mayo reported last week in
Nature Genetics online that they first identified the gene that
causes the disease in rats, then identified the corresponding gene in
humans.</TE>
<TE>   The gene, called PKHD1, is the blueprint for a very large protein
called fibrocystin. Researchers do not yet know what the protein
does, however. The discovery of the gene in rats provides researchers
with an animal model for the disease that will help test new
treatments.</TE>
<TE>   Increased Heart Rate Can Relieve Sleep Apnea</TE>
<TE>   Increasing the rate at which the heart beats at night can relieve
the symptoms of sleep apnea, French researchers have found.</TE>
<TE>   Sleep apnea is a cessation of breathing, lasting from a few
seconds to a minute or more, that can occur hundreds of times during
the night. As many as 18 million Americans suffer from sleep apnea, a
disproportionate number of them obese males over the age of 40.</TE>
<TE>   The condition leaves victims sleepy by day, increasing the chances
of such problems as dozing off while driving. It can also contribute
to high blood pressure and heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Stephane Garrigue of the Cardiology Hospital of Haut-Leveque
in Pessac became intrigued by the subject when some of his patients
reported they slept better after receiving pacemakers. He and his
colleagues then studied 15 patients in whom they increased the
nighttime heart rate from 57 beats per minute to 72.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers reported in the Feb. 14 New England Journal of
Medicine that the average hourly number of apnea episodes dropped by
61%, from 28 to 11. The incidence of apnea was reduced in every
patient, Garrigue said. But experts cautioned that more studies need
to be performed before pacemakers are widely used for treating the
disorder.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers are not sure how increasing the heart rate reduces
apnea, but they speculate that the faster heart rate may be
stimulating various nerves, which then prompt the brain to normalize

<TE>   Occasional use of tanning beds and lamps can double the risk of
skin cancer. Dr. Steven Spencer and his colleagues at the Dartmouth
Medical School studied 896 New Hampshire residents with either basal
cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma, comparing them with 540
people who did not have skin cancer.</TE>
<TE>   When they controlled for all other factors, the researchers
reported in the Feb. 6 Journal of the National Cancer Institute, they
concluded that the tanning devices doubled the risk of skin cancer.</TE>
<TE>   "No other factors, including summer outdoor exposure, sunbathing
or sunburns, affected our results," they said.</TE>
<TE>   The greatest increase in risk occurred in fair-skinned young women
who sunburned easily but who used tanning devices anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Early Magnesium Sulfate May Help Stroke Victims</TE>
<TE>   A preliminary UCLA study indicates that paramedics can safely give
magnesium sulfate to stroke victims before they are transported to
the hospital, potentially avoiding some of the debilitating effects
of the strokes.</TE>
<TE>   Magnesium sulfate dilates blood vessels in the brain and may
prevent the buildup of damaging calcium in injured nerve cells when
given soon after a stroke occurs.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Jeffrey Saver and his colleagues organized a program in which
Los Angeles paramedics administered the drug to 20 patients. Saver
reported last Thursday at a stroke meeting in San Antonio that the
drug was given an average of 2 hours and 40 minutes earlier than
conventional procedures and that no adverse effects were observed.</TE>
<TE>   Although Saver perceived that the patients fared better than would
have been expected, the researchers will have to perform a regular
clinical trial to determine if that is the case.</TE>
<TE>   Do Over-the-Counter Cough Syrups Work?</TE>
<TE>   Over-the-counter cough medicines may be a waste of money because
they have never been proved to work, according to British
researchers.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Knut Schroeder and Dr. Tom Fahey of the University of Bristol
analyzed 15 separate trials of the cough medicines that included more
than 2,000 people total. Nine of the studies showed the cough syrups
were no better than placebos, the pair reported in the Feb. 9 issue
of the British Medical Journal. The other six reported only slightly
positive results.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers concluded, therefore, that there is little
evidence that the medicines do work or that they don't.</TE>

<HD>Research Offers a Sweet Surprise: Chocolate Is Good for You</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHELDON MARGEN and DALE A. OGAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We tend to think of chocolate only in its most recognizable form--as
can- dy. It's easy to forget that it is made from a fruit that, like
most other fruits, is a rich source of beneficial chemicals.</LD>
<LD>   Chocolate and cocoa come from the seeds or beans of the cacao
tree, technically known as Theobroma cacao. The heart of the beans
are called nibs, which grow in footlong pods. When cacao beans are
processed, the nibs get finely ground into a "chocolate li- quor,"
which consists of cocoa solids and cocoa butter. The butter and the
solids are separated and then recombined to form different varieties
of chocolate.</LD>
<LD>   Milk chocolate (probably the most popular type) contains sugar,
cocoa butter and milk, and there may be more of these three
ingredients than chocolate itself. Semisweet chocolate, on the other
hand, has a higher proportion of chocolate (a minimum 35% chocolate
liquor). Chocolate products also contain emulsifiers (stabilizers)
and flavorings.</LD>
<TE>   Scientific research on the health effects of chocolate is
relatively new. But preliminary results are encouraging to
chocoholics.</TE>
<TE>   At UC Davis, researchers recently found that the antioxidants in
cocoa produced a positive effect on factors that would normally
produce plaque buildup in the arteries and thus increase the risk of
coronary artery disease. These positive effects on the blood
continued for six hours after eating the chocolate.</TE>
<TE>   At Penn State, another team of scientists showed that subjects who
consumed small amounts of cocoa powder and dark chocolate raised
their levels of HDL (good cholesterol). High HDL levels are known to
be protective against heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   We have also learned that, despite chocolate's high overall
saturated-fat content, chocolate contains fatty acids that do not
raise cholesterol levels as animal-based saturated fats tend to do.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the good news:</TE>
<TE>   * Chocolate does not cause acne. Dermatologists have finally
agreed that diet has nothing to do with acne. It is more likely
related to hormonal changes.</TE>
<TE>   * Chocolate is not addictive. You may think you can't live without
chocolate, but it is not a physical addiction the way nicotine is.</TE>
<TE>   * Chocolate does not cause tooth decay. Unless you eat chocolate
in some very sticky form that stays trapped in your teeth, the cocoa
actually seems to inhibit the bacterial growth that promotes plaque
formation in the mouth.</TE>
<TE>   * Chocolate does not interfere with calcium absorption. Chocolate
does not bind up with the calcium in chocolate milk. In fact,
chocolate milk, flavored with low-fat cocoa is a great way to get
kids to drink milk.</TE>
<TE>   * Carob is not more nutritious than chocolate. Ounce for ounce, it
contains the same amount of fat and calories as chocolate.</TE>
<TE>   * Chocolate and sugar do not promote hyperactivity in most
children. More likely, it is some special event surrounding the
eating of a lot of sugar and/or chocolate that gets children excited.</TE>
<TE>   So what's the moral of this sweet story? Eaten in moderation, any
food--especially a pleasurable one like chocolate--has a place in a
healthy diet.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In his famous oath that many doctors still swear to, Hippocrates
covered many of the basics of medical ethics: from "I will give no
deadly medicine to any one if asked, nor suggest any such counsel" to
"I will abstain from every voluntary act of mischief and corruption."
But the father of medicine, who practiced in the 5th century BC,
didn't have to deal with HMOs, worry about how to pay for fancy
imaging technology or ponder the ethics of drug company-sponsored
junkets to Hawaii.</LD>
<LD>   For today's doctors who do, two prominent medical journals last
week published "Medical Professionalism in the New Millennium: a
Physician Charter," a new statement of tenets meant to galvanize
doctors against what the authors view as troubling trends in modern
medicine.</LD>
<LD>   Among other things, physicians are urged to include patients in
medical decisions; to avoid all conflicts of interest with drug
companies and other commercial interests; to fight racial
discrimination; and to advocate for the uninsured.</LD>
<TE>   The declaration is meant as a challenge to doctors "to resist
efforts to impose a corporate mentality on a profession of service to
others," writes Dr. Harold Sox, editor of the Annals of Internal
Medicine, an American Medical Assn. journal that published the
statement simultaneously with the Lancet, a British medical journal.</TE>

<HD>Hormone Therapy Yields Mixed Results Among Women</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RIDGELY OCHS</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although it helps women with heart disease who have hot flashes,
hormone replacement therapy decreases quality of life for those who
don't have the menopausal symptom, according to a study to be
published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Assn.</LD>
<LD>   The common perception is that taking hormone replacement therapy,
in addition to relieving symptoms of menopause, makes women feel
better, more energized and younger.</LD>
<LD>   However, using data from 2,763 women ages 55 to 79 who had heart
disease, researchers from Stanford University found that the therapy
had mixed effects. The study was conducted from January 1993 to July
1998.</LD>
<TE>   Among the 15.7% of women who had hot flashes when they entered the
Heart Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study, or HERS, hormone therapy
appeared to improve mental health, reduce symptoms of depression and
had no effect on physical function or energy compared with a similar
group on placebos. But among the remaining 84.3% who had no hot
flashes, those on hormone therapy showed greater declines in physical
function and energy with no change in mental health or symptoms of
depression than women on placebos.</TE>
<TE>   The lead researcher, Dr. Mark Hlatky, said he and his colleagues
don't know why women without hot flashes on hormones showed a greater
decline in physical function. "We're very intrigued; that's the next
thing to dissect out," he said. Hlatky speculated that for women who
had no menopausal symptoms, side effects produced by hormone therapy,
such as breast tenderness or a resumption of a period, could
represent a loss of physical function.</TE>
<TE>   But Dr. Kathryn Rexrode and Dr. JoAnn Manson, both of Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston, theorize in an accompanying editorial
that loss of physical function "may well have been due to the
increased rates of cardiovascular events associated with hormone
therapy." In 1998, HERS was the first major trial to show that
hormone replacement therapy appeared to increase the risk of heart
attacks and other coronary events among some women who already had
heart disease. Previously, hormone therapy had been thought to be
heart protective.</TE>
<TE>   The finding from this latest study, like the initial HERS finding,
"challenges widely held assumptions," Rexrode said in an interview.
"There's this very powerful advertising image that it [hormone
therapy] is somehow the fountain of youth, while there's very little
data to back it up," she said. "This study ought to raise big red
flags." Rexrode also pointed out that preliminary data from the
Women's Health Initiative, a continuing federal study looking at
healthy women on hormone therapy, also showed an increase in heart
problems among a small percentage of those on hormone therapy
compared with those on placebo.</TE>
<TE>   For women who have hot flashes or other menopausal symptoms,
hormone therapy "has some clear benefit," Rexrode said. For those who
have no symptoms "the decision is a lot more difficult," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton, director of the Midlife Health Center at the
University of Virginia in Charlottesville, concurred, adding that for
women with heart disease, hormone therapy "does not appear called
for, for heart reasons, aside from quality of life issues."</TE>
<TE>   But she also pointed out that doctors generally use different
doses and combinations of estrogen and progestin, as opposed to HERS,
which used one medication at one dose. "Lots of times with an
individual, it's possible to improve quality of life by identifying
individual negative responses," Pinkerton said.</TE>
<TE>   And, she said, more research is being done examining lower doses
and different combinations of estrogen and progestin that might
reduce negative effects and preserve the benefits of hormone therapy.</TE>

<HD>Studies of Brain-Diseased Patients Seek Clues to Personal
Identity</HD>
<DH>Research pinpoints the spot, the right hemisphere of the
frontal lobe, that defines the sense of self.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMIE TALAN</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A snippet of tissue in the brain's frontal lobe has become the focus
of science's quest to find exactly where we get our sense of who we
are.</LD>
<LD>   Several recent experiments pinpoint the lobe's right hemisphere as
the locus of our identity.</LD>
<LD>   The study of brain diseases has been a factor in illuminating the
research into "self." People who seem to have lost their sense of
self are now said to be suffering from a condition called
frontotemporal dementia. Studies have found that damage to the
brain's frontal lobes can not only impair a person's ability to
recognize parts of his or her body, but also cause them to abandon
aspects of their daily lives and develop wholly new interests and
attitudes. In such cases, scans of the brain have found damage only
on the right side.</LD>
<TE>   "It's as if they've lost biographical memories," said Dr. Bruce
Miller, a behavioral neurologist at UC San Francisco who has studied
about a dozen patients with right hemisphere damage. The loss of self
is actually only the earliest symptom, Miller said, and most cases
have progressed to the memory-robbing symptoms common to Alzheimer's
disease.</TE>
<TE>   So, what exactly is the "self"--and how does it develop? Can these
recent studies of patients with brain damage provide clues to a
search that until recently was largely the province of philosophers?
Clearly, one piece of "self" is our ability to recognize ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   Julian Keenan, a neuropsychologist at Montclair State University,
has used the latest brain-scanning technology to search for evidence
of self recognition. He said the only species capable of recognizing
themselves in a mirror are humans, chimps and orangutans. So Keenan
set out to figure out how the brain gives rise to self recognition.</TE>
<TE>   In one study, he asked volunteers undergoing an MRI scan to look
at two sets of pictures: one of famous people, and one of themselves.
Only when they looked at themselves did the right hemisphere's
frontal lobe become activated.</TE>
<TE>   Keenan then asked doctors whether he could test patients during
their preparations for neurosurgery. A standard procedure, a Wada
test, is performed before neurosurgery to protect important brain
processing centers from disturbance. It anesthetizes one hemisphere
for a few minutes while the other hemisphere undergoes testing, and
then the procedure is reversed.</TE>
<TE>   Keenan took photos of each of five patients who were to undergo
neurosurgery. Then, he morphed prints of each patient's face with a
famous face. Each man's face was morphed with that of Bill Clinton or
Albert Einstein. Each woman's was morphed with Marilyn Monroe's or
Princess Diana's.</TE>
<TE>   During the Wada procedure, when each hemisphere "slept" for a few
minutes, the patient's brain was scanned as the patient eyed the
morphed picture. When the anesthesia wore off, patients were asked
who had been in the picture. Patients said they had seen themselves
in the picture when the brain's left hemisphere was asleep. When the
right hemisphere was resting, it was the famous person's face they
remembered.</TE>
<TE>   It became clear that the "right hemisphere is important for the
phenomenon of experiencing the self," Keenan said.</TE>
<TE>   Damage to the left hemisphere results in a loss of language or the
ability to understand words. Some people with such damage have
developed musical and artistic abilities that had been nonexistent,
Miller has reported.</TE>
<TE>   His theory is that the right hemisphere, which regulates
creativity, is now unleashed to perform its innate ability.</TE>
<TE>   In patient studies, he found that when the right hemisphere
suffers damage, the lifelong sense of self evaporates. One involved a
middle-age woman who had spent a lifetime clad in designer grays and
blues. Suddenly she traded in her wardrobe for flashy reds and
yellows. Gourmet restaurants were out. Taco Bell was in.</TE>
<TE>   Another woman, at 57, replaced her conservative wardrobe with
sweats. Her passion for collecting fine china was lost to an
obsession with teddy bears. Her political allegiances shifted as she
forsook conservative causes to work for the environmental group
Greenpeace.</TE>
<TE>   At a recent meeting of the American Academy of Neurology, Miller
reported on several cases of right hemisphere frontotemporal
dementia.</TE>
<TE>   Miller and his colleagues have identified the damage in the
brain's right frontotemporal region and found that the chemical
serotonin, known to regulate mood, emotion and behavior, is depleted.</TE>
<TE>   In general, people with damage to the right side of the frontal
lobe appear far more comfortable breaking the rules they once
created.</TE>
<TE>   While lesions in the frontotemporal region of the brain were
identified by Dr. Alois Alzheimer at the turn of the last century, it
wasn't until imaging tools offered a clear view of this structure
that doctors could diagnosis this disorder, which was thought to be
rare. Since the 1980s, the number of cases diagnosed each year has
increased, Miller said. It's still not clear how many people suffer
from it, but it does tend to run in families, Miller said, and
generally strikes people between 40 and 65.</TE>
<TE>   Miller estimates that about 75,000 people in the U.S. could have
this type of dementia. Such dramatic behavioral change can disrupt
the business of living.</TE>

<LD>Allow me to boast a bit: I chalked up another one in the loss column
this week. Another pound, that is.</LD>
<LD>   On Jan. 2, I was among the countless overstuffed Americans who
stepped onto bathroom scales and gasped in horror. The digitized
numbers between my toes had climbed to an all-time high--a lousy way
to start a new year. Five weeks later, I've lost 6 pounds and I'm
still counting calories, skipping desserts and exercising for at
least half an hour every day. I've also discovered that men and women
are different creatures when it comes to shedding pounds.</LD>
<LD>   For starters, women have far more dieting experience than we do.
According to the American Dietetic Assn., at any given time 25% of
the males in this country are attempting to lose weight. At the same
time, nearly twice as many females--45%--are trying to trim down.
Statistics from the National Institutes of Health suggest that women
also tend to embark on diets more often and stick with them slightly
longer.</LD>
<TE>   Most everyone agrees that women are more health-conscious than
men, which may partly explain their more frequent weight-loss
efforts. After all, carrying around too much heft can have serious
implications. In December, Surgeon Gen. David Satcher reported that
61% of Americans are overweight, and he added that obesity
contributes to 300,000 deaths per year in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   However, University of Minnesota behavioral epidemiologist Robert
W. Jeffery suspects that women diet more often primarily for
aesthetic reasons. They simply feel more social pressure than men to
be thin.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffery and several colleagues surveyed nearly 1,000 people
involved in a weight-control program and found some other subtle
differences in behaviors and attitudes.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Jeffery has found that men and women are likely to
offer different explanations when they abandon a diet plan. When a
woman slips off the weight-loss wagon, she's apt to blame mood. That
is, she ate an entire bag of peanut butter cups because she felt
depressed. Men, meanwhile, are less likely to cite a psychic need for
caloric comfort. Instead, we deflect responsibility from ourselves
altogether and blame circumstances for sabotaging our diets. We go on
business trips and complain that there was nothing but pizza and
chocolate chip cookies at the airport. We go to a ballgame with the
boys and, heck, you've gotta have a couple of hot dogs and a few
beers, right?</TE>
<TE>   Registered dietitian David Grotto, a spokesman for the ADA, adds
that men frequently blame their wives for buying and preparing foods
that are too fattening. But you can't pass the buck when it comes to
fixing a bad diet, insists Grotto. "A man needs to take the bull by
the horns and make those changes himself," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffery says that men tend to be more confident than women about
their ability to lose weight. But though we may pare off more pounds
than women do, male and female dieters tend to lose about the same
percentage of body fat (since we start out heavier to begin with).
Furthermore, adds Jeffery, women keep weight off longer. "I think
that's because they have a more consistent support network," he says.
"It's easier for a woman to find sympathetic friends."</TE>
<TE>   And if a woman doesn't have any friends who are dieting, she's
likely to go out and look for support elsewhere. Jeffery and other
researchers have found that women are far more likely than men to
join organized weight-loss programs such as Jenny Craig, TOPS (Take
Off Pounds Sensibly) or Weight Watchers. For instance, Weight
Watchers has about 675,000 members nationwide--and only 6% are men.</TE>
<TE>   Grotto, who is also director of nutritional education at Block
Medical Center in Evanston, Ill., thinks more guys should consider
joining a diet club or group. These groups usually meet once a week.
Members get weight-loss and nutrition tips, but the highlight of any
session is the weigh-in. Members who have dropped pounds receive
praise and token rewards for reaching milestones, such as 25 or 50
pounds; gainers get encouragement to keep trying.</TE>
<TE>   Sound hokey? Think again. "We know that accountability works
well," says Grotto, who once ran a weight-loss center. "There's a lot
of benefit to group support."</TE>
<TE>   At least one study backs up Grotto's observation. The New York
Obesity Research Center is conducting a two-year study of more than
400 obese people, who have been divided into two groups. At the
start, half of the subjects met with a nutritionist for diet advice a
few times, received some self-help literature, then set off to lose
weight on their own. The rest of the group was enrolled in Weight
Watchers. Initial data from the study, reported in the American
Journal of Medicine in 2000, showed that after 26 weeks, the people
in the Weight Watchers group lost, on average, more than 10 pounds;
the self-help subjects, meanwhile, were only down about three pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Another study shows that people who lose weight through commercial
programs are less likely to pack it all back on over time, the fate
that befalls many dieters. Researchers at MCP Hahnemann University in
Philadelphia found that 70% of people who lost weight with the help
of an organized diet program were below their initial weight five
years later.</TE>
<TE>   Grotto believes that men may avoid these programs because we're
uncomfortable sharing our health concerns with strangers. If that's
the case, ask around and form your own diet club with a friend or
family member.</TE>
<TE>   It's working for me. Each Wednesday morning I hop on the scale and
then e-mail a weight update to two of my sisters, who are also
dieting.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it's the guy in me, but I frequently have to remind myself
that I'm not battling in the Diet Bowl, that we're supporting one
another and not competing, and that it doesn't make any difference
that Cathy has lost twice as much weight as I have. However, when I
pass the cookie aisle in the grocery store all I have to do is think
about typing the words "I gained a pound this week," and I find the
motivation to keep walking.</TE>

<DH>The search for potent marine chemicals to treat pain and
disease is steaming ahead. Drugs derived from aquatic creatures are
making their way to the market.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beautiful to look at, but lethal to the touch, predatory cone snails
lurk in the tropical reefs of the South Pacific. They secrete a
paralyzing venom that they inject into their prey. But this poison
has also proved to be something of a medical marvel: a powerful
pain-fighting drug for humans.</LD>
<LD>   After more than two decades of trolling the oceans in search of
novel disease fighters, researchers finally are hitting pay dirt. The
new pain treatment, called Prialt, is the first in a wave of
marine-based medicines expected to reach pharmacy shelves during the
next few years.</LD>
<LD>   Prialt, which interrupts the transmission of pain impulses in the
spinal cord, is expected to be available within the next year. And
more than a dozen other novel agents, derived from such sea creatures
as coral, sponges, sea squirts and mosses, are under development to
treat an array of illnesses, from asthma to cancer.</LD>
<TE>   Ever since British physician Alexander Fleming's accidental
discovery in 1928 that ordinary mold destroyed bacteria, a finding
that led to the development of penicillin, scientists have combed
swamps, tropical rain forests and other ecosystems in search of
powerful medicinals. More than half of all prescription drugs,
including antibiotics, morphine and the cancer-fighting drug Taxol,
are obtained from naturally occurring products.</TE>
<TE>   But researchers are running out of good leads. Only 1% to 2% of
soil specimens retrieved during medicinal expeditions contain
previously unknown compounds, according to David Newman, a chemist
with the National Cancer Institute. In contrast, more than half of
extracts culled from sea creatures are unique, according to William
Fenical, director of the Center for Marine Biotechnology and
Biomedicine at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla. Not
surprisingly, marine drug research, once a scientific backwater, is
now attracting the attention of major drug companies, such as
Aventis, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Novartis.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to find drugs that can do things that nobody could
ever find a drug to do, and some of the test results have been quite
remarkable," said Fenical. "People realize the ocean is an incredible
resource for novel and biologically active products."</TE>
<TE>   Though ocean reefs may look like tranquil paradises, beneath the
surface they are sites of intense chemical warfare. Over millions of
years, ocean dwellers have developed a complex repertoire of survival
mechanisms, and the chemicals they secrete to keep predators at bay
must be potent enough to withstand dilution by seawater.</TE>
<TE>   "Organisms that sit on a reef have neither fins, scales, fangs or
claws, and they have to devise ingenious ways of maintaining a
toehold on the reef--otherwise they're dead," said Newman, who heads
the NCI's Natural Products Branch in Bethesda, Md. Algae and sea
grass, for example, secrete noxious-tasting chemicals to discourage
fish from nibbling on them.</TE>
<TE>   But how can compounds that work for sea creatures also help
humans? The answer lies in the fact that we share about 5,000 genes
with marine organisms, which possess primitive versions of human
systems. "It doesn't matter whether you're a microbe or a man," said
Newman. "The genes fulfill almost the same function."</TE>
<TE>   Scientists are hopeful that these marine drugs may prove more
effective than some current therapies. Scientists say Prialt (whose
generic name is ziconotide), for instance, the pain remedy derived
from cone snails, will revolutionize treatment of severe, chronic
pain because the targeted therapy doesn't have the unpleasant side
effects of morphine or other opiates--it's not habit-forming and it
doesn't envelop users in a narcotic fog.</TE>
<TE>   "It's quite exciting because this treats pain conditions that
haven't responded to conventional therapy," said Dr. Michael S.
Leong, an assistant professor at the Stanford University School of
Medicine, who tested Prialt on 108 people with cancer and AIDS. "All
these patients had exhausted everything that was available, and even
the worst patients with intractable pain got some relief."</TE>
<TE>   Researchers knew the snail's venom affected the central nervous
system. But they discovered it was a potent painkiller quite by
accident. A laboratory analysis of the toxin indicated that one
component blocked calcium channels, the chemical pathways that help
cells communicate with one another.</TE>
<TE>   Prialt blocks nerve impulses in a key region of the spinal cord,
where pain fibers from the body connect with the nerve cells that
send pain signals to the brain, said Baldomero M. Olivera, a biology
professor at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, who first
isolated the snail venom in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   This is why Prialt, which is 50 times more potent than morphine,
is so exquisitely precise and doesn't cause the adverse effects of
opiates: It stops pain messages from getting through while allowing
the rest of the nervous system to function normally.</TE>
<TE>   Another component of the cone snail toxin, which prevents nerve
damage, is in the early stages of tests on people suffering from
severe epilepsy.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted preliminary
approval to Elan Pharmaceuticals, the Ireland-based maker of Prialt.
If it gains final FDA clearance, as expected, it could be available
within the year. It is expected that Prialt's use initially will be
limited to patients with intractable pain, from cancer, AIDS or
severe back problems, because the drug must be administered by
catheter directly into the spinal fluid.</TE>
<TE>   In the future, however, this therapy may have broader
applications. "This promises to be the first of a whole new class of
pain drugs," said Stanford's Leong. "We may be able to use it to
treat people resistant to other types of drugs."</TE>
<TE>   Another promising marine drug is derived from a moss-like creature
found in the waters off the West Coast. The drug, bryostatin, is a
cancer-fighting compound that is in the second phase of testing on
humans. (Normally, drugs go through three phases of clinical trials
before companies apply for FDA marketing approval).</TE>
<TE>   Bryostatin is produced by tiny bacteria that live inside Bugula
neritina, a sea organism that often clings to the hulls of boats like
barnacles. Bryostatin seems to work by throwing a monkey wrench into
the DNA of cancer cells, halting the unchecked cell growth of cancer.
By itself, bryostatin isn't very effective. But it seems to enhance
the activity of such chemotherapies as Taxol and cisplatin.</TE>
<TE>   At Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, for
example, bryostatin is being tested in combination with Taxol on
patients suffering from cancer of the esophagus, which is difficult
to treat. Preliminary data indicates that in 60% of patients, tumors
shrink by at least half versus a response rate of 17% from Taxol
alone.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Gary K. Schwartz, an oncologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering
who is conducting these trials, believes that the substances are a
big step forward but said researchers must overcome the treatment's
side effects--severe muscle aches, which afflict some patients. "If
we could find a way to [minimize the muscle aches] and maintain that
response rate, we're going to have a home run," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bryostatin and Taxol may be used in tandem to treat cancers that
respond to Taxol, such as breast, ovarian and lung cancer. Despite
these dramatic benefits, scientists still haven't devised a method of
making enough bryostatin for commercial use. Fourteen tons of Bugula
neritina harvested from waters off the coast of California yielded a
paltry 18 grams of bryostatin.</TE>
<TE>   "All of the drug trials that are going on are using material from
that one batch of bryostatin, which gives you an idea of how potent
it is," said Margo G. Haygood, an associate professor at Scripps.
"But continuing to collect enough of the animals out there to produce
this for people to use would be environmentally destructive."</TE>
<TE>   The alternative is to find a way to produce bryostatin in the
laboratory. Haygood's research team is attempting to identify the
gene responsible for triggering production of bryostatin. Once they
do that--and they're tantalizingly close--they'll smuggle the genetic
material inside bacteria, which replicate exponentially. These
colonies of genetically altered bacteria are transformed into
mini-bryostatin factories because each bacterium is then programmed
to secrete the substance. Still, said Haygood, "it's a big challenge
to crack this problem."</TE>
<TE>   Sea squirts, which live in clusters in the temperate waters off
the Caribbean and Mediterranean seas, contain another potent
anti-tumor agent, ecteinascidin. Scientists have chemically
synthesized the active ingredient in the sea squirts to formulate a
drug, ET-743, which has been used in small studies of patients with
advanced breast, colon, ovarian and lung cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers also are testing it on patients with advanced
sarcomas, malignant tumors that grow in muscles, fatty tissue and
bones. In early testing, tumor progression was slowed or halted in
nearly half of the patients, and more than half survived more than a
year, a much better result than with chemotherapy. "These patients
are very hard to treat because their disease is so advanced," said
Dr. George D. Demetri, an oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute and Harvard Medical School in Boston . "Yet some of them
had their tumors totally melt away; sometimes miracles happen for
reasons none of us can explain."</TE>
<TE>   Though this therapy is not yet on the market, it's already
dramatically affecting people's lives. For Fran Skutta, ET-743 was a
lifesaver. The 51-year-old Greenville, S.C., woman was first
diagnosed with lipo sarcoma in December 1992. Doctors removed a
10-pound tumor from her abdomen that had wrapped itself around one
kidney. In 1999, the cancer returned with a vengeance, and this time
surgeons were forced to cut out almost a third of her colon. By 2000,
the tumor was so immense that it was inoperable.</TE>
<TE>   Skutta's doctors told her she probably had fewer than five years
to live. In desperation, Skutta enrolled in the clinical trial at
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in January 2001. Now, 13 months after
she began treatment with the experimental drug, her tumor has shrunk
by more than 70%. "This drug has given me my life back," said Skutta,
who flies to Boston for treatment every four weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Not quite as far along in development is a group of
anti-inflammatory compounds that seem to be as effective as steroids
but thus far appear not to have the same adverse effects, such as
organ damage, loss of bone density and stunting of growth in
children. Typically, when a pathogen enters the body, white blood
cells, the foot soldiers of the immune system, are dispatched to the
infected area to destroy intruders. But the accumulation of these
cells, which surround the invader to prevent it from spreading,
causes the swelling and redness we associate with infection.</TE>
<TE>   These novel agents, called LSAIDs (leukocyte-suppressing
anti-inflammatory drugs), damp- en this immune response "by
inhibiting the migration of white blood cells to the site of
inflammation," says Jeffrey Bacha, a vice president of Inflazyme
Pharmaceuticals, a Vancouver, B.C., biotechnology firm. One of them,
IPL576092, a chemically synthesized version of a compound found in
sea sponges that inhabit waters near Papua, New Guinea, is being
tested on asthma patients to relieve chronic lung inflammation and
airway constriction. Preliminary research suggests the oral drug
works as well as inhaled steroids, the current standard
treatment.Similar agents derived from these sponges are also being
tested to stop the nerve damage that typifies multiple sclerosis and
the painful joint swelling of rheumatoid arthritis. Eventually, these
drugs may be used to control other inflammatory diseases of the skin,
bowel and lungs.</TE>
<TE>   Another promising source of anti-inflammatory drugs are
pseudopterosins, chemicals made by plants that live on soft coral
found in the Caribbean Sea near the Bahamas. Pseudopterosin extracts
have been used for nearly a decade by cosmetic companies, such as
Estee Lauder, as an additive to prevent irritation caused by exposure
to the sun or the chemicals in the cosmetics.</TE>
<TE>   But the major roadblock standing in the way of its development as
a drug for treating severe burns and allergies, or to accelerate
wound healing, is that scientists still don't have the tools to make
enough pharmaceutical-grade pseudopterosin to test it on humans.
"Supply is always a problem with marine products because you're
invading delicate ecosystems to collect organisms for commercial
purposes," said Robert Jacobs, a professor of pharmacology at UC
Santa Barbara. "But we're getting close to isolating the DNA that
produces the chemical."</TE>
<TE>   Despite these strides, marine drug development is still in its
infancy, and the oceans may soon yield more powerful medications.
"It's taken roughly 30 years to get where we are," said the NCI's
David Newman. "But given that fact that the ocean is home to more
than two-thirds of the world's species, this is only the beginning."</TE>

<LD>THE HEART OF ADDICTION</LD>
<LD>   By Dr. Lance Dodes</LD>
<LD>   HarperCollins Publishers</LD>
<TE>   $24.95, 257 pages</TE>
<TE>   Lance Dodes, a Harvard psychiatrist with a longtime specialty in
addiction, doesn't focus on the genes that may make people
susceptible to alcoholism, drug abuse or compulsive gambling. Nor
does he buy the common wisdom on how to attack addictions. In his
view, Alcoholics Anonymous and other 12-step programs fail because
they don't address the underlying problem behind addictive behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Dodes believes that drinking, drug use and gambling (he directs
the Boston Center for Problem Gambling) are reactions to a person's
feeling of helplessness. When someone with an addiction feels
helpless, Dodes says, he or she has a drink or takes a drug to erase
the resulting rage. The decision to engage in the addictive activity
creates a sense of empowerment, he argues, even though the action can
spin the person even further out of control.</TE>
<TE>   Using composite profiles of patients he's treated in his 25-year
career, Dodes says it's possible to regain control first by
identifying the signal that you're about to give in to the addiction.
Then, he says, you can learn to anticipate it and redirect your
energy to satisfy unmet emotional needs. This requires a more
individual approach than that followed by many support groups.</TE>
<TE>   The question is whether those with addictions can do this on their
own by following examples in this book or whether they need qualified
therapists like Dodes to help tease out the motivations and
situations that drive them back into the addictive behavior.</TE>

<TE>   How to Benefit From</TE>
<TE>   Physical Activity  During</TE>
<TE>   Your Cancer Treatment</TE>
<TE>   By Lisa Hoffman</TE>
<TE>   with Alison Freeland</TE>
<TE>   Perseus Publishing</TE>
<TE>   $15, 92 pages</TE>
<TE>   Exercise physiologist Lisa Hoffman has found in her New York City
practice that moderate exercise helps cancer patients fight fatigue
and depression and maintain muscle while coping with the debilitating
effects of surgery, treatments and the illness itself. Working with
trainers and cancer specialists, she has put together a simple,
step-by-step guide to help patients get moving.</TE>
<TE>   It begins with the most basic movements for those who are still
bed-bound and moves through exercises for those who can walk, jog and
otherwise engage in vigorous exercise.</TE>
<TE>   She uses simple black-and-white sketches to illustrate exercises
that can be done alone or with the assistance of a caregiver or other
partner.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman wisely advises readers to listen to their bodies. There
may be days when they need to ease up on their routine.</TE>
<TE>   With introductions from the head of hematology at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and the chief of that hospital's
integrative medicine program, the book clearly has been vetted and
scrutinized by professionals who can attest to the successes of
patients who have made exercise a part of their healing.</TE>

<LD>   Floral Bouquets Give Seniors a Boost</LD>
<LD>   With Valentine's Day approaching, the nation's florists are
gearing up for their busy season. New research, though, indicates
it's not just young--or even middle-aged--lovebirds whose mood
improves with a floral bouquet. Flowers give the elderly a tremendous
psychological boost that translates into a more positive outlook, an
enhanced social network and improved memory.</LD>
<TE>   Rutgers University researchers studied 104 men and women ranging
in age from 55 to 93, who were asked to keep a daily log of their
activities and were interviewed at three different intervals during a
six-month period.</TE>
<TE>   In one group that received bouquets twice during the six-month
study, 81% reported a reduction in depression, 40% said they
broadened their social circle beyond family and close friends, and
72% scored higher on memory tests than another study group that
received no flowers.</TE>
<TE>   "Instinct tells us that flowers lift our spirits, but their
effects on seniors are especially profound," said Jeannette
Haviland-Jones, a professor of psychology at Rutgers University in
New Brunswick, N.J., who conducted the study with funding from the
Society of American Florists.</TE>

<TE>   Starting Oral Health</TE>
<TE>   in the Womb</TE>
<TE>   The womb is one of the few places left where humans can live
beyond the reach of nagging health advice.</TE>
<TE>   But maybe not for long: In honor of National Children's Dental
Health Month, the American Dental Assn. last week issued a news alert
titled "Good Oral Health Begins in the Womb."</TE>
<TE>   According to the statement, women who don't begin worrying about
an embryo's future teeth run the risk of giving birth to a child with
hypoplasia, "a condition characterized by inadequate development of
the infant's tooth enamel."</TE>
<TE>   The solution? Eat good food (a recommendation already being
embraced by many women in their second and third trimester).</TE>
<TE>   Though not common in normal-weight newborns, enamel problems are
linked to poor nutrition during pregnancy, some doctors say.</TE>

<TE>   PREGNANCY</TE>
<TE>   Hospitals Delay Epidurals to Prevent C-Sections</TE>
<TE>   Proper oral health aside, some expectant mothers have other
concerns in mind, such as, "When will I get the epidural?"</TE>
<TE>   According to the nation's leading group of women health doctors,
an increasing number of hospitals have begun denying epidural pain
relief to women in labor until they have reached a certain stage of
labor; that is, when they have dilated to 4 or 5 centimeters.</TE>
<TE>   A woman is usually prepared to give birth after reaching 10
centimeters' dilation.</TE>
<TE>   How long it takes a woman to go from early labor to birth varies
widely, according to experts at the American College of Obstetricians
and Gynecologists.</TE>
<TE>   The organization has long recommended that epidurals be given at 4
to 5 centimeters of dilation, when feasible, and also that a woman's
request for pain relief during any stage of labor is sufficient
medical reason to provide it.</TE>
<TE>   Hospitals may be denying epidurals--the most effective and popular
form of pain relief during labor--because of some studies that show
the risk of Cesarean section increases when epidurals are given early
in labor.</TE>
<TE>   Cesarean sections increase costs and health risks to the mother.</TE>

<LD>Question: Is it OK for me to do muscle tone exercises such as
crunches, squats and lunges every day?</LD>
<LD>   JILL</LD>
<LD>   La Mesa</LD>
<TE>   Answer: You should allow at least 48 hours of rest for each muscle
group regardless of what you are using as your resistance tool (free
weights, machines, resistance bands or body weight). Generally
speaking, muscle growth occurs as a result of microscopic tears being
made to the muscle fibers. These tiny tears are made when the muscles
work above and beyond what they are accustomed to. The tears are
repaired naturally by our bodies when we are in the "rest" phase. By
not allowing the muscles that necessary break-in action, they're
never given the opportunity to make these repairs.</TE>

<HD>Schools Enlisted in the Effort to Diagnose Spinal Curvature</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN FIELDING and VALERIE ULENE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many California schoolchildren will be bringing notes home this
year--not about their academic performance or behavior, but about the
curvature of their spine.</LD>
<LD>   Abnormal spinal curvature is a problem that most people associate
with aging, but it's also a common problem in youth, affecting 2% to
4% of children between the ages of 10 and 16. The spinal
abnormalities that children develop are very different from those
commonly seen in older adults. In the elderly, the curve is usually
an accentuation of the normal front-to-back S-shape of the spine; the
problem in children is typically a lateral- or side-to-side-curvature
known as scoliosis.</LD>
<LD>   And, though spinal deformities among the elderly are usually the
result of weakening and collapse of the spine's bones (called
vertebra), the cause of most cases of childhood scoliosis is unknown.
(In a very small percentage of cases, however, there may be an
underlying cause such as tumors or spinal cord abnormalities.)</LD>
<TE>   Typically, scoliosis in children is slight and does not cause
significant deformities or discomfort. (Although back pain is common
during adolescence, children with mild scoliosis don't appear to
suffer from it any more frequently than others.) In some children,
however, the curvature is severe or progressive to the point where it
causes disfigurement and serious medical complications such as
difficulty breathing.</TE>
<TE>   California state law actually requires schools to screen children
for this problem. Last year, about 50,000 middle-school students were
examined for scoliosis in the Los Angeles Unified School district
alone--and about 1,500 were referred to doctors for evaluation. The
purpose of the examinations is to detect the more severe cases so
treatment can slow or prevent worsening of the curvature.</TE>
<TE>   However, scoliosis screening is controversial because it's unclear
that current nonsurgical treatments are effective. There is, for
example, no good evidence to suggest that exercises (once routinely
used for this purpose) are helpful. Even back braces--now the
standard of care--may not work as well as once imagined. Although
some studies have shown that they may help prevent curves in some
growing children, others have found them to have no beneficial
effect. For just this reason, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force
does not recommend for or against routine screening, but only suggest
that physicians be alert for evidence of large curves when examining
their adolescent patients.</TE>
<TE>   So, what's a parent to do? Since there is no risk to a child from
the simple examination, many medical experts agree that children
should be screened regularly, starting around the age of 10 (although
scoliosis can develop at any age before a child's skeleton fully
matures, the majority of cases do not occur before this age).</TE>
<TE>   Because it is more common in girls than in boys, the American
Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons recommends screening girls twice--at
ages 11 and 13--and boys once--at age 13 or 14. The American Academy
of Pediatrics endorses a more rigorous screening protocol and
recommends screening both boys and girls routinely at ages 10, 12, 14
and 16. (L.A. Unified screens girls in grade 7 and boys in grade 8.)</TE>
<TE>   If an abnormal curve is found, consult with your child's doctor. A
recheck every four to six months may be all that is necessary if the
curve is relatively small. If, however, the curve is large or your
child is experiencing symptoms associated with it (such as pain or
bladder or bowel problems), you should probably consult an orthopedic
specialist.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the controversy, back braces may be recommended to prevent
moderate curves from worsening. Surgery--which usually involves the
placement of metal rods alongside the spine to straighten it--is
typically reserved for young children with rapidly progressing curves
and adolescents with very large curves. Because of the risk of severe
complications, including paralysis, a second opinion with a doctor
specializing in children's spine surgery is advisable if this
procedure is recommended.</TE>
<TE>   If your child brings home a note from school suggesting the
possibility of scoliosis, don't panic. Many of the children who come
home with notes turn out to have no significant physical problem, and
most of the children who do have scoliosis have such a slight curve
that no problems will result.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What the doctor looks for:</LD>
<LD>   The screening examination for scoliosis is simple and painless.
The doctor first inspects the back for any obvious deformity.</LD>
<LD>   Then the child is asked to lean forward, with feet together,
bending 90 degrees at the waist. In this position, if a child has
scoliosis, a prominent "hump" will be apparent on one side of the
back.</LD>
<TE>   What parents can look for:</TE>
<TE>   Several telltale signs in children suggest the possibility of
scoliosis:</TE>
<TE>   * The child's shoulders, waist or hips appear uneven (one side is
higher than the other).</TE>
<TE>   * One of the child's shoulder blades is more prominent than the
other.</TE>
<TE>   * The child appears to lean to one side.</TE>
<TE>   The mere presence of these signs does not mean that a child has
scoliosis.</TE>
<TE>   That diagnosis can be made only after a complete physical
examination by a doctor and an X-ray of the spine.</TE>

<HD>Blood Test Could Be Right Step Toward Detecting Ovarian
Cancer</HD>
<DH>Diagnosis* The new  procedure identified the disease in
initial stages. Early diagnosis improves patients' chances of
long-term survival.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MALCOLM RITTER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A simple blood test may be able to identify ovarian cancer at its
earliest stage, when it's hardest to spot but at its most curable, a
preliminary study suggests.</LD>
<LD>   Around three-quarters of women with ovarian cancer are diagnosed
in advanced stages of the disease, when they have only about a 20%
chance of surviving five years. But if the disease is caught early,
the five-year survival is around 95%.</LD>
<LD>   So providing a way to routinely identify the disease in its "Stage
1" phase "could have a dramatic impact in what is now a very deadly
cancer," said Dr. Elise Kohn, a study author.</LD>
<TE>   Kohn is clinical director of a joint program of the National
Cancer Institute and the Food and Drug Administration that focuses on
proteomics, the study of the proteins inside cells. Scientists from
those two agencies and elsewhere present their results in a report
published online Friday by the Lancet.</TE>
<TE>   They tested blood samples from 50 women with ovarian cancer and 66
women without the disease. The test correctly identified all 50
samples from the cancer patients, including all 18 samples from women
with Stage 1 disease. And it recognized 63 of the 66 samples that
were noncancerous.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Lance Liotta of the National Cancer Institute, senior
investigator on the study, said the results are "a first step." Now
the test must be studied with larger numbers of women and in
different medical centers "to make sure it's as good as we hope it
can be."</TE>
<TE>   The researchers said that if the test proves useful, it would be
applied initially in women considered at high risk because of their
genetic makeup or family history of the disease. Eventually, it might
be extended to other women as well, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Some 23,300 American women are expected to be diagnosed with
ovarian cancer this year, and the disease is expected to cause 13,900
deaths. It accounts for 4% of all cancers among women.</TE>
<TE>   The experimental test measures the levels of five proteins found
in the blood. The combined result in a blood sample is used to
indicate the presence of cancer, said Emanuel Petricoin of the FDA,
lead author on the paper.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Martee Hensley, an ovarian cancer expert at the Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, called the test innovative
and potentially useful but said it must be assessed in larger groups
of women.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, there's not a great way to find early stage ovarian
cancer," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We clearly need new technology," and the experimental test might
be "at least two or three steps in the right direction," she said.</TE>
<TE>   It could be useful in screening women at high risk of the disease
if a positive result is shown to reliably indicate ovarian cancer,
without too many "false positives" that erroneously indicate cancer,
she said. That's because a false positive could lead to needless
surgery.</TE>
<TE>   The test would need further study in the general population to
assess its accuracy in that group, she said.</TE>

<HD>Pharmacists Struggle on Fraud's Front Lines</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A generation ago, local pharmacists knew all the doctors in town and
remembered each customer by name--making it difficult to obtain
prescription drugs, especially potentially addictive ones, without a
doctor's order.</LD>
<LD>   But Americans became increasingly mobile, switching communities,
doctors, insurance companies and drug plans on a regular basis. And
the number of prescriptions soared, from 1.87 billion in 1992 to 2.98
billion in 2000, a nearly 60% increase in just eight years, according
to the Kaiser Family Foundation.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, pharmacists now are finding it difficult, some say
impossible, to ensure that every prescription they fill is on the up
and up.</LD>
<TE>   Last month, Noelle Bush, the daughter of Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and
niece of President Bush, was arrested on prescription fraud charges
for allegedly trying to buy the anti-anxiety drug Xanax without a
prescription. Authorities say she posed as a doctor to call in an
order, and that a pharmacist, who suspected something was amiss,
contacted police.</TE>
<TE>   Pharmacists and the federal Drug Enforcement Administration say
there's no way to determine how many Americans obtain prescription
medications illegally. Some fake written or verbal prescriptions;
some seek multiple prescriptions for the same drug from several
doctors; countless others obtain drugs from the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   The agency in the last five years has increased the number of
"tactical diversion squads," dedicated to curbing the problem, from
just two in early 1997 to seven scattered around the country today;
it also has investigators working at more than 70 sites nationwide,
an agency official said.</TE>
<TE>   Drug officials acknowledge that little can be done about drugs
purchased overseas or shipped by overseas Internet sites without a
prescription. But, in this country, the agency is pushing for a
system in which doctors would use a digital signature that must be
validated before a drug is dispensed; pharmacists would be able to
tell if the prescription was altered after it was entered into the
computer. The agency hopes to have regulations for the system
finalized in October 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Even with that system, "we won't know how secure it is until
someone tries to beat it," said Susan Winckler, group director of
policy and advocacy for the American Pharmaceutical Assn., the
national trade group for pharmacists. "We have to figure out how to
stop what we can and identify what we can't." Even now, those seeking
prescription drugs may use multiple phone lines, computerized
prescription forms and other sophisticated methods.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush arrest, pharmacists say, highlights not only the problem
of prescription drug abuse, but of a system that relies on them to
find it.</TE>
<TE>   Those who dispense the drugs are the first line of defense, and
law enforcement depends on their tips. They have a professional and
regulatory responsibility to ensure they're dispensing medications
from a legitimate prescription.</TE>
<TE>   When a local pharmacist suspects a prescription has been forged or
altered, he or she has the choice "to fill or not to fill," said
Jesse Vivian, a professor of pharmacy law and ethics at Wayne State
University in Michigan. When there's some doubt, the pharmacist must
decide whether to fill the prescription and potentially put
medications into the hands of a drug abuser, or hold back the
prescription and potentially deny a sick person the relief they need.</TE>
<TE>   Many pharmacists rely on gut instincts to determine if something
is awry, especially when medications with addictive potential are
involved, said John Tilley, owner of 14 pharmacies in Southern
California. He said the two hottest prescription drugs of abuse right
now are the painkillers Vicodin and OxyContin.</TE>
<TE>   If a prescription for such a drug is telephoned in, the pharmacist
may ask questions to filter out phony prescriptions. The pharmacist
also listens for "the cadence of the prescribing physician or nurse.
Are they hesitating with answers?" Winckler said.</TE>
<TE>   With written or faxed prescriptions, pharmacists will examine the
writing style, Winckler said. Physicians typically use Latin
abbreviations and other shorthand, so a doctor would convey a need
for 30 tablets by writing "#30." The forger might write "30 tablets."</TE>
<TE>   Forgers might alter the number of pills or refills, while others
"pharmacy shop" by going to several pharmacists to see who is most
likely to furnish the medications.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the red flags that traditionally tipped pharmacists off in
the past may not be valid today. Ira Freeman, the pharmacist-owner of
Key Pharmacy in North Hollywood, said his radar used to go up if a
patient came in with a prescription for 100 Vicodin pills. But today,
with more doctors attending to chronic pain, pharmacists are
scrutinizing those prescriptions more on the basis of whether they
appear appropriate. For example, they'd be more likely to furnish
large quantities of painkillers prescribed by a cancer specialist
than a dentist.</TE>
<TE>   Freeman has established his own policy about frequently abused
drugs: "If I don't know the patient and the physician is outside of
my area, I don't fill it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   When pharmacists detect fraud, they share that information with
regulatory and law enforcement agencies and with one another.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes that can create other problems. Carmen Catizone,
executive director of the National Assn. of Boards of Pharmacy in
Illinois, cited a case in Washington state in which a pharmacy
suspected someone of pharmacy shopping. The pharmacy gave the
person's name to the state's pharmacy board, but the person proved he
had legitimate prescriptions and won a multimillion-dollar judgment
against the board for invasion of privacy, Catizone said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite that incident, he said, "we're telling the boards again to
be vigilant and continue to do these types of things when they
suspect there's a problem. Sometimes they're going to win; sometimes
they will bear the consequences."</TE>
<TE>   Many pharmacists have set up networks to alert colleagues to
prescription fraud. When a member of the Pharmacists' Professional
Society of the San Fernando Valley gets a phony prescription, he or
she will fax an alert to a pharmacy in Northridge that then faxes the
alert to nearly 400 other pharmacists.</TE>
<TE>   Still, pharmacists say, the gatekeeper role puts them in a
difficult position.</TE>
<TE>   "Detecting fraud is not the pharmacist's primary duty. It's
clearly a secondary duty," Vivian said. "The problem is, do we want
to train pharmacists to be health-care providers first, or train them
to be policemen first? Our first obligation is to the patient."</TE>

<LD>The wind-driven circulation of Pacific Ocean waters has slowed since
the 1970s, resulting in less upwelling of cool water near the equator
and perhaps in an increase in El Nino events, according to scientists
at the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory in Seattle. They
reported in the Feb. 7 issue of Nature that the volume of water
transported from the subtropics to the area near the equator declined
25% from the '70s to the '90s.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>University of Alabama astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope
have discovered a spiral galaxy that may be spinning to the beat of a
different drummer. The galaxy, called NGC 4622, is rotating in the
opposite direction from what astronomers had expected, the team said
last week. The vast majority of spiral galaxies have outer arms of
gas and stars that trail behind as the galaxies rotate. NGC 4622's
arms point toward the direction of the galaxy's clockwise spin. The
galaxy also has a trailing inner arm that is wrapped around the
galaxy in the opposite direction. The researchers speculate that NGC
4622 was formed when two galaxies collided, producing its unusual
characteristics. More information is available at heritage.stsci.edu.</LD>

<HD>Warming May Doom Olympic Peninsula</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Olympic Peninsula's rain forest is probably doomed by global
warming, says a new report from the World Wildlife Fund and the
University of Toronto. As the Earth warms, ecosystems will migrate
north, scientists say. If plants and animals can't adapt to new
conditions--which could include higher temperatures and less water,
for example-- or migrate fast enough to keep up with their accustomed
climate, they will die out.</LD>
<LD>   But the Olympic Peninsula's rain forest has nowhere to migrate to.
The peninsula is likely to undergo a drastic change, the report said,
although scientists say it's difficult to determine how quickly that
change will occur.</LD>

<HD>Birds Lack Feeling When It Comes to Chili Peppers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Q: How do birds so casually eat hot chili peppers, which give humans
fits?</LD>
<LD>   A: They don't feel a thing, say UC San Francisco researchers. The
culprit in the peppers is capsaicin, a chemical known to bind to a
receptor on the human tongue called vanilloid receptor 1, or VR1.
VR1, which produces pain when stimulated, is also triggered by heat.
Biologist David Julius and his colleagues isolated the VR1 from birds
and found that capsaicin does not bind to it and thus does not
produce a painful sensation. The difference between birds and mammals
yields an evolutionary advantage for the pepper plant. Enzymes in the
stomachs of mammals break down the seeds, and the hot taste
discourages them from consuming--thus destroying--them. But the seeds
pass through the intestines of birds undamaged and are dispersed
widely.</LD>

<HD>Scientists Sharing Fewer Discoveries</HD>
<DH>Research: The openness of the past has in some cases given
way to secretiveness, surveys find. Experts fear negative effects on
the quality and progress of work.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT LEE HOTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scientists depend on openness for their research advances--many of
which the public underwrites. More and more, however, they are
keeping information about their discoveries to themselves, new
surveys show.</LD>
<LD>   In the first detailed look at how scientists share information,
analysts at Harvard University Medical School and the Massachusetts
General Hospital questioned 1,800 geneticists and others in the life
sciences at the 100 U.S. research universities that receive the most
public funding from the National Institutes of Health.</LD>
<LD>   They found that almost half of the scientists had been denied
access to information about published research. Their findings were
recently published in the Journal of the American Medical Assn.</LD>
<TE>   The survey adds to a growing body of research over the past decade
that documents greater secrecy among scientists and greater corporate
control of university research.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University in 1990, for example,
studied 1,058 research centers sponsored by industries at 203
universities and found that a third of the agreements governing
research at the centers allowed the industrial sponsor to suppress
research.</TE>
<TE>   In all, those agreements covered about 36,000 researchers--15% of
the U.S. scientific and engineering workforce.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Checking the Results</TE>
<TE>   The trend toward secrecy in science means that it is harder for
scientists to check each other's experiments for mistakes and ensure
the integrity of published research. It also is more difficult for
competing laboratories to build on the advances of others, several
policy analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "Ultimately, it is going to have an impact on the quality of
science," said Tufts University analyst Sheldon Krimsky, who monitors
research ethics and conflicts of interest.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, many scientists kept their work to themselves until
their experiments were completed and their findings could be made
public. But once they published their findings, they also released
the details of how they achieved their results. That allows other
scientists to settle their doubts about new findings by duplicating
the work, checking it for mistakes and independently verifying each
new claim.</TE>
<TE>   Now that practice is becoming a thing of the past. The custom is
changing at a time when university research has become a booming
commercial enterprise. University-based research generates about $40
billion in annual economic activity and thousands of new patents
every year, according to the Assn. of University Technology Managers.</TE>
<TE>   In 1980, Congress loosened legal restrictions on how scientists
could profit from their publicly funded research. Since then, federal
spending on biomedical science has grown from $3 billion a year to
more than $20 billion last year.</TE>
<TE>   Commercial research spending has grown even faster. Drug companies
spent $22.4 billion in 2000, much of it through grants, consulting
fees and partnerships with campus researchers.</TE>
<TE>   As the boundary between academia and industry blurs, the new
possibilities for personal profit may be changing the way researchers
behave.</TE>
<TE>   In the Harvard study, researchers found that:</TE>
<TE>   * Almost one of every two genetics researchers who had asked other
faculty in the last three years for more information, experimental
data or research materials relating to published scientific findings
were turned down at least once.</TE>
<TE>   * Almost one in three had been unable to duplicate published
research findings because the scientists who conducted the work would
not share sufficient details of the experiments.</TE>
<TE>   * Almost one in four had delayed their own research publications
because their colleagues withheld data. An equal number stopped
working with someone because the scientist refused to share data.</TE>
<TE>   * One in five abandoned a promising line of research.</TE>
<TE>   * Of those who admitted they withheld information, eight in 10
said they refused to share data with other scientists because it was
too much work. Half said they were trying to protect their own lead
in research they hoped to publish later.</TE>
<TE>   * One in three said the problem had gotten worse over the last
decade.</TE>
<TE>   "When people don't share published resources, it may slow the rate
of scientific advance," said Eric G. Campbell at Massachusetts
General's Institute for Public Health Policy and the Harvard
University Medical School, who led the survey team. "Geneticists said
it had slowed the progress of their research."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Focusing on Geneticists</TE>
<TE>   The Harvard analysts focused on the behavior of geneticists
because the field has become a hotbed of university and commercial
research. Moreover, the federal government and the leading research
publications, mindful of the potential for conflicts and secrecy in
genetics, have gone to great lengths to ensure that all the
information about published findings will be freely available.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Biologists Pledged to Release DNA Data</TE>
<TE>   An international group of molecular biologists even took the
unusual step two years ago of pledging to immediately release all DNA
sequence data from all organisms into the public domain.</TE>
<TE>   For that reason, bioethics expert George Annas at Boston
University found the survey results all the more surprising.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the incredible amount of public funding," Annas said, "I
would have thought the geneticists would have done better, to be
sharing their data more freely."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the research extended the findings of earlier studies
that have documented how scientists appear to place less and less
value on openness.</TE>
<TE>   The surveys, which the Harvard researchers have conducted since
1997, encompass thousands of scientists at hundreds of research
campuses.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those surveyed have admitted delaying publication of
research to protect a scientific advantage or to slow dissemination
of undesired results.</TE>
<TE>   Secrecy also is interfering with education of graduate students
and hindering those seeking to launch their research careers, a
related Harvard survey of scientists at 233 medical schools shows.</TE>
<TE>   To complicate matters, much of the most advanced science in
genetics and other important areas of medical research today is
conducted by commercial firms, which can prize market performance
over more traditional academic research values of openness.</TE>
<TE>   In the last two years, a private firm, Celera Genomics, played an
important role in completing the Human Genome Project and a
Massachusetts-based company, Advanced Cell Technology, now is taking
a lead role in research that may lead to human cloning. A third firm,
PPL Therapeutics--which helped breed the first cloned mammal, Dolly
the sheep--is helping to pave the way for transgenic animals that can
be used for human organ transplants.</TE>
<TE>   To preserve a competitive advantage, each firm jealously guards
details of its research findings.</TE>
<TE>   The companies often have announced scientific accomplishments
through press releases, rather than through more traditional
peer-review publication that would ensure that other scientists could
independently verify the results.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Restricting Openness</TE>
<TE>   Many university researchers today also may have a financial stake
in their own work that can lead some to withhold data or make
misleading claims about their work.</TE>
<TE>   Others face restrictions on what outside employers and patrons
allow them to talk about openly--rules that greatly hinder the free
exchange of scientific information.</TE>
<TE>   To counter the trend, three influential medical groups --the
American College of Physicians, the American Board of Internal
Medicine and the European Federation of Medicine--this month
published a new code of professional conduct. Among other things, it
emphasizes the importance of scientific knowledge and the need to
better handle conflicts of interest.</TE>
<TE>   Withholding data is a problem, said Harvard health care policy
expert Dr. David Blumenthal: "We can document that.</TE>
<TE>   "Does it slow the pace of science? It is fair to say there are
adverse effects."</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas has dropped accounting firm
Andersen amid questions surrounding its audits of energy trader Enron
Corp., but other major hotel and gaming clients said they would stay
with the firm for now.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen acts as auditor for most of the biggest casino operators
in Las Vegas, including MGM Mirage, Harrah's Entertainment Inc. and
Mandalay Resort Group. It is also a major auditor for the related
hotel sector, with a client list including Marriott International
Inc. and Hilton Hotels Corp., the No.1 and No.3 U.S. operators. So
far, only Hard Rock has said it was dropping Andersen, which admitted
to shredding Enron documents. Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection in December.</LD>
<LD>   "The Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino is a highly principled and ethical
organization," Chief Financial Officer Jim Bowen said in a statement.
"Our board of directors and management group were uncomfortable with
retaining Arthur Andersen as our company's auditors."</LD>
<TE>   Despite the controversy surrounding the accounting firm, other
major casino and hotel clients of Andersen said they have no plans to
switch auditors.</TE>
<TE>   "Our audit committee has always been very diligent in reviewing
the auditor," said Marc Grossman, spokesman for Beverly Hills-based
Hilton. "Andersen is our auditor, and they've done a good job."</TE>
<TE>   Hilton and officials from other hotel and casino companies said
their auditors must be approved by shareholders each year at their
annual meetings. They said committees of company board members will
decide prior to those meetings whether to recommend shareholder
approval for Andersen's continued role as company auditor.</TE>
<TE>   MGM Mirage spokesman Alan Feldman said the auditor issue is less
critical for the casino industry because it is so heavily
scrutinized. "Our industry is so highly regulated that any and all
business relationships outside joint ventures have to be approved by
state authorities. The kinds of transactions that existed in the
Enron case couldn't exist in our industry."</TE>

<HD>Ex-Enron CEO Expected to Remain Silent</HD>
<DH>Hearings: Kenneth L. Lay will refuse to testify,
spokeswoman says. Lawmakers express skepticism about Jeffrey K.
Skilling's testimony.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Former Enron Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth L. Lay will
refuse to testify Tuesday when he appears before a congressional
committee investigating the collapse of the energy trading giant, his
spokeswoman said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   ''Under the instruction of counsel, Mr. Lay will exercise his 5th
Amendment right at the Tuesday hearing,'' Kelly Kimberly said,
declining further comment. The amendment grants constitutional
protection against self-incrimination.Lay's announcement came after a
number of leaders of the various congressional committees probing
Enron's collapse made clear on the Sunday morning talk shows that
they didn't believe the testimony of Lay's former lieutenant, Jeffrey
K. Skilling. He did not invoke the 5th Amendment on Capitol Hill last
week.</LD>
<LD>   The skepticism expressed by lawmakers about Skilling's testimony
could have influenced Lay, who canceled two voluntary appearances
before congressional panels last week because of what his lawyer
called the "prosecutorial" comments of lawmakers on talk shows. Lay
was then subpoenaed by two congressional committees.</LD>
<TE>   Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) said that Skilling could be in
"legal jeopardy" for denying to Congress that he knew about the
shadowy financial transactions that led to the nation's largest
corporate bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   "He really thought he was smarter than everybody in Washington,"
said Tauzin, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and
one of several lawmakers who were skeptical of Skilling's testimony.
"I'm afraid he may have put himself in some legal jeopardy...."</TE>
<TE>   Skilling attorney Bruce Hiler responded, "We are shocked at the
unsupported charges being leveled at our client by those in a
position to know of their inaccuracy."</TE>
<TE>   The once highflying energy company--the seventh-largest
corporation by revenue in last year's Fortune 500--filed for Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection Dec. 2 amid questions about its accounting
practices.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, thousands of workers lost their jobs; many more saw
their retirement plans--largely invested in company stock--become
almost worthless as Enron's stock price tanked.</TE>
<TE>   A dozen congressional panels and several government agencies are
investigating Enron's collapse and examining what new laws are needed
to protect workers and stockholders.</TE>
<TE>   Among the investigating agencies is the Labor Department, which on
Sunday said it is seeking to remove Enron officials from a committee
that oversees the company's retirement plans on behalf of
participants, and replace them with an independent legal
representative. The agency is investigating whether the officials
legally responsible for Enron's 401(k) plan--called fiduciaries--were
prudent and acted only in the interest of the employees and the plan
as required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, which governs employer-provided retirement plans.</TE>
<TE>   The department has been negotiating with Enron lawyers for about a
month, and Assistant Secretary Ann Combs said she hopes an agreement
can be reached without a "lengthy court proceeding."</TE>
<TE>   Eli Gottesdiener, a Washington attorney suing the company on
behalf of employees and retirees who had 401(k) retirement plans at
Enron, said Sunday he would file a motion today in federal court in
Houston seeking removal of the Enron executives overseeing the
savings plan.</TE>
<TE>   Enron had several retirement plans with different administrative
committees, though there is much overlap among the members, according
to the Labor Department.</TE>
<TE>   In an appearance Thursday before the House Energy and Commerce
subcommittee on oversight and investigations, Skilling swore that
when he resigned from Enron on Aug. 14--citing personal reasons--he
was unaware of the off-the-books partnerships used to hide the
company's debt. Many lawmakers and legal experts had expected Lay to
invoke his constitutional right against self-incrimination, as four
other Enron executives did last week.</TE>
<TE>   "Lay's got a good lawyer," Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.),
chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, which subpoenaed Lay to
appear before his panel Tuesday, told "Face the Nation." "I can't
see, with things having gotten worse all week long, him testifying
now." Hollings, complaining about Enron's ties to the Bush
administration, defended his call for an outside counsel, which the
Justice Department has determined is not necessary.</TE>

<HD>For ETrade, No More Monkey Business</HD>
<DH>Marketing: The online broker, hoping to become a financial
services powerhouse, is promoting a more serious image.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL LIEDTKE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Seeking to shed its image as a quirky, irreverent online broker,
ETrade Group Inc. is putting on a pinstripe suit.</LD>
<LD>   The idea is to morph into a financial services octopus, peddling
home loans, checking accounts, credit cards, insurance, financial
advice and stock.</LD>
<LD>   The biggest banks in the world have been attempting similar
transformations for the better part of two decades with little
success, said J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. analyst Gregory Smith.</LD>
<TE>   "The strategy makes sense, but can ETrade be the one to do it
right?" Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   The uninspiring diversification efforts of traditional banks have
only deepened the conviction of ETrade Chief Executive Christos
Cotsakos that his strategy is sound.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody has been able to do it, and that's what makes it an
opportunistic time for us to try it," Cotsakos said. "We have always
been about changing the rules of engagement."</TE>
<TE>   ETrade signaled its new direction on Super Bowl Sunday with a TV
commercial that bid farewell to its playful monkey mascot. The Menlo
Park, Calif., company then introduced a redesigned Web site
highlighting other financial services besides the stock trading that
used to be its bread and butter.</TE>
<TE>   The site also bears a new brand, "ETrade Financial," to emphasize
the new identity, which will be promoted in a three-month marketing
blitz.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't a sudden shift.</TE>
<TE>   During the last five years, ETrade has poured about $5 billion
into acquisitions and technology to help create what it believes is a
one-stop shop for financial services.</TE>
<TE>   Cotsakos, who became CEO in 1996 after studying consumer behavior
at A.C. Nielsen, believed a Web site offering a smorgasbord of
financial products would appeal to an increasingly technology-savvy
audience--primarily people ranging from age 24 to 54.</TE>
<TE>   Although many analysts have questioned the strategy, the
diversification helped ETrade weather the last year's tumbling stock
market better than most online brokers.</TE>
<TE>   "This more holistic approach to financial services really proved
to be their saving grace," said industry analyst Tim Butler of
Pacific Crest Securities.</TE>
<TE>   Like much of the brokerage industry, ETrade downsized in 2001,
resulting in charges that produced a $241.5-million net loss for the
year, on revenue of $1.3 billion. Excluding special charges, however,
ETrade says it has been profitable for six consecutive quarters.</TE>
<TE>   A mortgage division ETrade bought for $36million in early 2001
produced major dividends as interest rates plunged and spurred a rush
to refinance home loans last year. The surge helped boost the
company's fourth-quarter profit from continuing operations to
$24.7million, quadruple the $6million of a year earlier.
Fourth-quarter revenue totaled $345million, up 3% from a year
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   As it broadens its menu, ETrade is becoming less dependent on
stock trading. For example, in the final three months of 2001, ETrade
collected one-third of its revenue from its banking operations; at
the end of 2000 just one-sixth of the company's revenue came from
banking.</TE>
<TE>   ETrade's diversification hasn't been limited to its Web site. The
company also is building a bricks-and-mortar distribution network
with 11,000 automated teller machines and dozens of 400-square-foot
branches in Target stores.</TE>
<TE>   In another step to expand its brand awareness off-line, ETrade has
opened stand-alone investment centers in New York, San Francisco,
Beverly Hills, Boston and Denver, and plans to open at least 20 more.</TE>
<TE>   "We will rely on a few bricks and lots of clicks," Cotsakos said.</TE>
<TE>   But the expansion is raising concerns about new risks for ETrade
as well. "It's becoming a more complicated company, and that means
they are going to have be very careful about how they manage the
different businesses," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to introduce an ETrade credit card this year is
particularly risky, some analysts  say.</TE>
<TE>   Making unsecured loans to consumers is a perennial land mine for
banks--a danger that has been underscored during the last six months
by the heavy loan losses suffered by credit card issuers Providian
Financial and NextCard, whose bank was shut down by federal
regulators Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Cotsakos said ETrade plans to avoid trouble by extending credit
only to the "creme de la creme" of the 4 million households that have
brokerage and banking accounts with the company.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street's wariness about ETrade's expansion plans is evident
in the company's shares: The stock, which peaked at a split-adjusted
$72.25 in 1999 when it was soaring with other dot-com shares, closed
at $9.05 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. It has rebounded from
less than $5 in late September but has traded mostly between $6 and
$13 since January 2000.</TE>
<TE>   On average, analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/IBES expect
ETrade to earn 44 cents a share in 2002 from continuing operations.
At Friday's share price, the stock's price-to-earnings ratio based on
the 2002 estimate is 21.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, the market is affording ETrade rivals Charles
Schwab and Ameritrade Holdings significantly higher P/Es: Both of
those stocks are priced at 31 times the companies' respective 2002
estimated per-share earnings, according to Thomson Financial/IBES.</TE>
<TE>   ETrade's share price has been under pressure in recent weeks as
Japan's Softbank Corp.--once ETrade's biggest backer--has sold more
than half its remaining stake in the firm.</TE>
<TE>   Softbank, which has been pulling back from its once-extensive
Internet-related investments and is attempting to pare down debt,
said it sold 18 million ETrade shares Jan. 30 at $8.80 apiece. The
Japanese company retains about 15 million shares.</TE>
<TE>   If Softbank is pulling away from ETrade, Cotsakos is personally
betting on his strategy: In 2001, he bought 2.34 million shares of
ETrade stock for $12.7 million, or an average of $5.45 a share,
according to Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   The skeptics don't bother Cotsakos because he still remembers the
days when the industry questioned ETrade's staying power as an online
broker.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a lot of people who didn't think we would survive 60
days, let alone six years," Cotsakos said. "We have always tried to
stay ahead of the curve, in good times and bad times."</TE>

<HD>Allied Irish Announces Investigator</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DUBLIN</DL>
<LD>Allied Irish Banks appointed a senior American banker Sunday to
oversee an internal probe into $750 million in allegedly fraudulent
losses at its U.S. subsidiary, Allfirst Bank of Baltimore.</LD>
<LD>   Eugene A. Ludwig is a veteran federal regulator who served as the
Treasury Department's comptroller of the currency during the Clinton
administration.</LD>
<LD>   Allied Irish said Ludwig would publish a report into the losses,
which the bank has blamed on foreign-exchange trader John Rusnak,
within 30 days.</LD>
<TE>   ''Mr. Ludwig is an eminent banking expert. We are extremely
fortunate to have found a man of such skill and expertise, with great
knowledge of the banking system, to head up our investigation,'' said
Lochlann Quinn, chairman of Allied Irish Banks.</TE>
<TE>   Ludwig, 55, serves as managing partner of Promontory Financial
Group in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   He was a banking attorney in Washington before President Clinton
appointed him to direct the bank regulatory agency within the
Treasury Department, where he oversaw 2,600 nationally chartered
banks. He had been a Rhodes scholar at Oxford University at the same
time as Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Allied Irish Banks said Ludwig's investigation
would nail down the facts behind Rusnak's trades, identify what
checks were in place at Allfirst to police Rusnak's work, document
''the manner in which such policies and controls operated or may have
failed to operate,'' and recommend ways of improving them.</TE>
<TE>   Rusnak's attorneys have vowed to fight Allied Irish allegations
that he may have covered up his trading losses for personal profit.
The FBI has interviewed Rusnak, but filed no charges against the
37-year-old Baltimore resident.</TE>

acquire Toymax International in a $54-million cash-and-stock deal
that will further expand the Malibu toy maker's line of products to
include water toys and kites.</LD>
<LD>   Jakks announced the acquisition Saturday, kicking off the annual
Toy Fair in New York. The company is expected to announce today a
deal with Walt Disney Co. to create arts and crafts based on classic
Disney characters, including Mickey Mouse among others.</LD>
<LD>   Toymax's principal stockholders, which own about 64% of the
company, have agreed to sell their shares to Jakks for $4.50 a share.
Jakks agreed to pay Toymax stockholders $3 a share in cash and $1.50
in value of Jakks common stock. Jakks will purchase the remaining
shares in May.</LD>
<TE>   The transaction values Plainview, N.Y.-based Toymax at a 48%
premium over Friday's closing price of $3.05 on Nasdaq. Toymax had
sales of $132.1 million in the fiscal year ended March 31.</TE>
<TE>   Jakks shares rose $1.27 on Friday to close at $18.80 on Nasdaq.
They've risen 56% in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Jakks produces dolls based on World Wrestling Federation
personalities and holds the license to make arts and craft kits
inspired by Warner Bros.' "Harry Potter" movies as well as products
related to the upcoming 20th Century Fox animated movie "Ice Age."
The company also makes Remco die-cast trucks, BattleBots robotic
vehicles and drawing pads, stickers and lunch boxes based on
Nickelodeon program characters under Jakks' Flying Colors brand.</TE>
<TE>   The Toymax deal would be Jakks' ninth acquisition since the
company was formed in 1995, and would make Jakks the nation's
third-largest toy company, President and Chief Operating Officer
Stephen Berman said Sunday. The company had 2000 sales of $252.3
million, a 37% increase over the previous year. Net income for last
fiscal year was $28.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Jakks bought Kidz Biz Ltd., a toy distributor based in
Britain, for an undisclosed price, as the first step in a planned
European expansion. In July 2000, the company acquired Pentech
International, a specialty pen, marker and activity-set maker for
nearly $57 million, including debt. In 1999, the company acquired
Flying Colors Toys Inc. for nearly $53 million.</TE>
<TE>   Toymax produces kites under its Go Fly a Kite brand, R.A.D.
Robots, Mighty Mo's vehicles, Creepy Crawlers Bug Maker and Funnoodle
pool and water toys. Berman said Jakks would reduce the sales volume
of Toymax products, but the company intends to keep the profitable
lines, such as the kites and water accessories.</TE>
<TE>   "With this acquisition, we couldn't be more diverse," Berman said.</TE>
<TE>   Berman said Jakks' toys typically sell well during the third and
fourth quarters, as a run-up to Christmas, and its pen and stationery
items are popular during the second and third quarters for
back-to-school supplies. The Toymax kite and water accessories, which
sell in the spring, will help round out the year.</TE>
<TE>   "We're really set up to have a nice flow of sales throughout the
year," said Berman, who co-founded the company with Jack Friedman,
the company's chairman and chief executive. "After this acquisition
we will be looking aggressively at more acquisitions."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 70% of the company's toys and activities sell for less than
$10. Jakks' largest customers are Toys R Us Inc., Wal-Mart Stores
Inc., Kmart Corp., Target Corp. and KB Toys.</TE>
<TE>   Jakks Pacific expects the acquisition, its second this year, to
close in the second quarter and add to 2002 earnings.</TE>

<HD>Legislation May Lower Cities' Revenues</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES FLANIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State legislation intended to address California's housing shortage
may have the unintended effect of reducing the tax revenue of the
state's hard-pressed cities, according to a survey of business costs
to be released today.</LD>
<LD>   The 2002 Kosmont Cost of Doing Business Survey also found that
taxes, fees and other costs levied on business in California have
stabilized after years of increases. And Los Angeles and San
Francisco impose lower costs on business than a wide range of cities
nationwide, including Tucson, Reno, Miami and Houston.</LD>
<LD>   Worries about California's competitiveness in attracting or
retaining industry have abated somewhat.</LD>
<TE>   "As a result of Proposition 13, business taxes are lower in
California than in neighboring states," said Larry Kosmont, a real
estate consultant and president of Kosmont Cos., which publishes the
annual survey. "But the state has other charges that hurt it with
business, such as workers' compensation insurance costs that have
risen 30% a year for the last two years."</TE>
<TE>   Still, there is little of the concern of the early '90s that
businesses would leave California, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kosmont's survey, however, noted two pieces of legislation that
could have unintended consequences for cities.</TE>
<TE>   One is the pending AB 680, which could shift portions of sales
taxes that cities use to finance police, fire and other municipal
services to help finance affordable housing projects.</TE>
<TE>   Such a diversion of sales taxes is "a good move in principle,"
Kosmont said, because it can help relieve the state's housing
shortage. But he added that many cities depend heavily on sales tax
revenue and would have to raise fees if such legislation is approved.</TE>
<TE>   The bill, which has been approved by the Assembly and sent to the
Senate for consideration, would apportion one-third of future sales
tax gains to affordable-housing projects in the Sacramento area. But
if the concept were broadened, it would hit fast-growing cities such
as Irvine, Temecula and Victorville, which depend on sales taxes for
more than half of their municipal revenues, according to the survey.</TE>
<TE>   The result "definitely would be that local fees would go up,"
Kosmont said, unless the state, which took property tax revenues from
cities in the early '90s recession, finds a way to remedy the
taxation structure for local government.</TE>
<TE>   Kosmont's report also raised a warning flag over recently enacted
SB 975, which expands the number of real estate developments
qualifying as public works. Such a designation would help affordable
housing and other projects become eligible for state funds but would
require that project workers receive "prevailing wages." Such wages
are typically above the minimum wage, Kosmont said.</TE>
<TE>   "So, in effect, Senate Bill 975 is a state-mandated fee on
public-private development deals," which could render them
infeasible, Kosmont said.</TE>

<HD>Lego Steps Into Action Figures</HD>
<DH>Toys: The new line is seen as a risk as the firm moves away
from its interlocking bricks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Lego Co., the Danish toy maker best known for its brightly colored
interlocking bricks, is moving into a new dimension this year: action
figures.</LD>
<LD>   Based on the Fox Kids show "Galidor: Defenders of the Outer
Dimension," which debuted last weekend, Lego's line of 20 moving
figures is part of the company's efforts to broaden its product line
while maintaining Lego's more high-minded creative play.</LD>
<LD>   Lego will introduce the new toys  today at the industry's main
trade show, Toy Fair, in New York.</LD>
<TE>   "We're redefining Lego," said Andrew Black, president of the
company's Americas division. "It's not just about bricks. It's about
learning and different ways of using your mind."</TE>
<TE>   Moving away from bricks, however, also is moving away from Lego's
proven formula. In this case, the risks are greater because of the
highly competitive and trend-driven action figure business.</TE>
<TE>   "It's rolling the dice because this is not a construction toy,"
said Jim Silver, publisher of industry magazine Toy Book and consumer
magazine Toy Wishes. "If you look at anybody in the toy industry with
the introduction of action figs, the success rate is less than 50%."</TE>
<TE>   Lego's track record on new product lines so far is excellent. Both
its 1998 Mindstorms programmable robot-building product and last
year's superhero-like Bionicle robot characters were hits with
consumers and industry groups.</TE>
<TE>   Both of those, however, are patterned on more traditional Lego
building toys. Lego says that the Galidor line is a natural extension
for Lego since it requires interchanging, snap together pieces, each
of which imbues the character with different powers.</TE>
<TE>   "If you bought five or six Galidor toys, took all the pieces apart
and then rebuilt them, you can create products Lego hasn't thought
of," Black said. "What you're seeing us do is creating and redefining
the company. We're creating new forms of building and in this
particular case, we've done what we do so well in creating a new
building system and marrying it with story."</TE>
<TE>   Galidor, which comes from Lego's partnership with Canadian
entertainment company CineGroupe, follows the story of a teenage
boy's adventures as he tries to save a far-away land from an evil
tyrant.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to its toys and licenses, Lego, owned by the founding
Kristiansen family, runs its own stores and LegoLand theme parks,
including one in Carlsbad.</TE>
<TE>   Lego suffered its first loss in the late 1990s, as the growth of
the video game market far outpaced traditional toys, and cut about
10% of its work force. In 2001, the company announced cuts of 500
jobs as well as the end of certain Lego product lines, such as
clothing and watches.</TE>
<TE>   But even if it hadn't lost ground in the 1990s, Silver said, the
company has good reasons to experiment with new ideas.</TE>
<TE>   "Within the construction area, you can only grow so much," said
Silver. "How do you keep growing? First you try things near to your
main product line, like Mindstorms or Bionicle, then you move outside
of that, like action figures."</TE>
<TE>   To that end, Lego also is introducing a new preschool line, "Lego
Explore," which includes Music Builder Composer. That toy allows
children to change the instrumentation of a particular song by
plugging pieces representing different instruments into a base unit
with holes for melody, harmony or rhythm.</TE>
<TE>   Another toy lets children build theater sets to create their own
stories, including multiple backgrounds and characters as well as
sound effects and other components.</TE>
<TE>   Black said each of Lego's new products could be seen as a
construction product, just using different kinds of building blocks.</TE>
<TE>   "With Galidor, you're building action figures," Black said. "With
Music Builder, you're building songs.</TE>
<TE>   "We've taken what was traditional Lego and we've created a brand
new building system that's never been done before."</TE>

<PH>THE FALL OF ENRON</PH>
<KH></KH>
<HD>An Edge to Enron's Lobbying Strategy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHANNA NEUMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Jeffrey K. Skilling was visiting Capitol Hill to press the case for
energy deregulation. It was September 1999, and Enron Corp. was the
darling of Wall Street.</LD>
<LD>   Skilling, then the energy giant's president, had almost
single-handedly imprinted his combative style on the company's
lobbying culture, and he used it now: We're Enron. We're the economy.
Buy it.</LD>
<LD>   But Joe Barton, a Republican congressman from Texas and ordinarily
a fan of open markets, wasn't buying it. As chairman of a House
Energy and Commerce subcommittee, Barton didn't think Enron had the
votes then. Skilling told him he was wrong. So Barton kicked Skilling
out of his office.</LD>
<TE>   "There was no foul language, but he got so frustrated that he
started telling me how to run my subcommittee," Barton recalls of
their meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him I was no CEO of a Fortune 500 company, but I was not
an idiot, and I knew he didn't have the votes. He told me I was
wrong, that I was just being stubborn. I told him there was no reason
to come see me again until things calmed down."</TE>
<TE>   By many accounts, that exchange with Skilling--who subsequently
became chief executive of Enron but resigned in August, before the
company's collapse--was typical of Enron's lobbying efforts. But
while the brash and raw tactics ruffled feathers, Enron was generally
successful in getting its way.</TE>
<TE>   "Enron was willing to be very active physically, as well as
financially--showing up, testifying, walking the halls of Congress,"
said Daryl Owen, a partner at the lobbying firm of Palmetto Group,
who attributes many of Enron's victories to hard work.</TE>
<TE>   "Most companies focus overwhelmingly on Wall Street to the
diminution of Washington," he said. "Enron correctly perceived that
what happens in Washington" has a lot to do with "how successful you
can be in business."</TE>
<TE>   The priority for Enron was electric power deregulation, winning
Washington's approval to open natural gas markets in all the states.
When Congress balked, the company turned to the Bush White House,
convincing the administration to replace the independent-minded
chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission with a
deregulation man--Pat Wood, whose name was on a list vetted by the
company's then-chairman, Kenneth L. Lay.</TE>
<TE>   With Enron's collapse, its hardball lobbying tactics are coming
under fire. This week, the issue of Enron's lobbying the White House
to stay out of California's energy crisis, as well as for changes at
FERC, could flare at hearings on Capitol Hill. However, Lay's views
will remain a secret since he's expected to invoke the 5th Amendment
when he appears before the Senate Commerce Committee.</TE>
<TE>   But Enron's influence wasn't limited to FERC. The company also won
permission from Congress to expand its online futures trading
operations, which gave it a huge competitive advantage. And its
chairman met regularly with Vice President Dick Cheney--a heady level
of access by anyone's measure.</TE>
<TE>   Nor was its influence limited to Republicans. When Bill Clinton
was president, his Commodities Futures Trading Commission approved
rules that exempted energy trading--the heart of Enron's
business--from government regulation.</TE>
<TE>   The Clinton administration also pushed for the Kyoto Treaty on
global warming, which would have given Enron a chance to sell
"credits" to companies that exceeded their carbon dioxide limits,
purchased from those that did not.</TE>
<TE>   In its heyday, the Houston company gilded Washington with campaign
contributions (during the 2000 presidential election, the company was
number 36 on the top 100 list of donors to federal candidates
compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics) and employed hundreds
of lobbyists, lawyers and other influence peddlers.</TE>
<TE>   "Enron was everywhere, literally everywhere," said a Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission staff member, who asked not to be named.
"If you walked into an energy meeting anywhere in the world and Enron
lobbyists weren't there, you figured you were in the wrong place."</TE>
<TE>   Washington lobbyists are trained to play hardball. What Enron
added was arrogance.</TE>
<TE>   "The mentality appeared to be 'We revolutionized the energy
industry; enjoy our brilliance,'" said Christopher Horner, who worked
briefly as an Enron lobbyist and is now a senior fellow at the
Competitive Enterprise Institute, a free-market think tank. "This led
to lobbying efforts ranging from the ambitious to the utterly
hubristic."</TE>
<TE>   Old-line energy lobbyists, who bristled at Enron's depiction of
them as stodgy, take special delight in Enron's fall. Deriding the
Houston company as more hype than heft--the doomed "dot-com of the
energy world" is a common epithet--they note with pride that
old-fashioned lobbying by buttonhole won the day as Enron's flashy
demands for deregulation lost.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not selling potatoes," said one high-ranking energy
lobbyist who declined to be named because he is a direct competitor
to Enron. "Our industry is complex. We were talking substance. They
were doing hubris."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the company's flameout, many think the trend toward
deregulation will continue. Though Enron never won a "date certain"
for retail competition in all the states, even adversaries admit
Enron improved the climate for the idea of loosing the bonds of
government regulation. "They moved the ball forward," said the
competitor energy lobbyist. "There are going to be other companies
that try to capitalize on that."</TE>
<TE>   Enron's Washington offices are closed now. No one sits behind the
proud mahogany desk with its black marble top. The phone goes
unanswered. Instead of high-profile lobbyists like Ed Gillespie (once
described by the New Republic as "the most powerful Bushie you've
never heard of") and the Alexander Strategy Group (home to Ed
Buckham, former chief of staff to House Majority Whip Tom Delay of
Texas), Enron and its in-trouble executives have become the full
employment act for high-stakes lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Bennett, who represented Bill Clinton in the Paula Jones
sexual harassment case, is representing Enron. And David Boies, who
took Al Gore's election appeal all the way to the Supreme Court and
battled Microsoft Corp. for the Justice Department, is representing
Andrew S. Fastow, the ousted chief financial officer who reaped at
least $30 million by running Enron's off-the-book partnerships, and
who took the 5th Amendment in congressional testimony last week.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, some think Enron was so well-connected it did not need
to behave like a bully. Enron had the kind of power that comes of
financial success. When company officials used it quietly, they
usually won.</TE>
<TE>   In the years he led Enron, Lay knew how to play the town. He had
worked as an economist at the Pentagon, while a young Navy officer.
During the Nixon administration, he led the fight against price
controls at FERC and the Interior Department. Mostly, he knew how to
disagree amiably. Sen. Frank H. Murkowski (R-Alaska) then chairman of
the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, remembers how
disappointed Lay was when Murkowski advocated a go-slow approach on
deregulation. Instead of blowing up, Lay went downtown, winning an
agreement from then-Energy Secretary Federico Pena, in February 1998,
for the Clinton administration's help in pushing back deregulation.</TE>
<TE>   Skilling's cockiness--he once told a stock analyst at an investor
conference that his questioning of Enron's finances showed his
stupidity--ignored a key component of life in official
Washington--deference. In a town that treasures presidential dinner
settings and official titles, Skilling broke the china.</TE>
<TE>   "They set an unreachable standard for arrogance," Owen said.</TE>
<TE>   But even competitors suspect the boasting of financial prowess
will continue to be a compelling selling point. "Enron got carried
away; they wanted to call themselves the coolest company," said James
Christian, an attorney at the Washington lobbying powerhouse of
Patton Boggs. For now, he added, everyone is going to "tuck their
chin down a bit," but the lure of winning votes in Washington by
wowing Wall Street is a lobbying tactic sure to resurface.</TE>

<HD>Enron Lobbyist Plotted Strategy Against Democrats</HD>

<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While the Bush administration was drafting its national energy
policy, a leading lobbyist for Enron Corp. was plotting strategy to
turn the plan into a political weapon against Democrats, according to
a newly obtained memo.</LD>
<LD>   Edward Gillespie, who parlayed his close ties to the Bush White
House into a lucrative contract representing the energy giant, warned
that the administration faced "a classic liberal-conservative ...
dynamic," which cast Republicans as the party of big business and
enemies of the environment.</LD>
<LD>   "Instead of picking the fight that has been picked for us, we
should pick a new fight," said the confidential April 2001 memo,
presented to energy companies and industry groups. The memo suggested
the industry "change the dynamic by 'Carterizing' the Democrats"--an
allusion to the dour ex-president. "We need to make them the 'eat
your peas' party."</LD>
<TE>   Gillespie's simultaneous lobbying and campaign strategizing
underscore Enron's influence in Washington before its collapse last
year, as well as the way politics and policy often blur under the
loophole-filled laws governing their combination.</TE>
<TE>   Gillespie said he never shared his memo with the White House, and
his thoughts on political strategy, offered in informal conversations
with administration officials, were never taken.</TE>
<TE>   But within weeks, Gillespie's recommendations surfaced in
advertising promoting Bush's energy plan. One newspaper ad read,
"Remember the 70s? Gas lines were long, rationing was in, Jimmy
Carter was president and he told us to wear a sweater."</TE>
<TE>   The ad was sponsored by a collection of conservative groups,
operating as the 21st Century Energy Project. Gillespie was the
group's director. Under the murky federal laws governing such
"independent expenditure" campaigns, its funding source remains
secret.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the energy industry gave well over $1 million in
campaign contributions to members of the two major political parties.
At the same time, hundreds of thousands more were spent on such
independent expenditure campaigns, targeting environmentalists and
Democratic foes of the administration, including California Gov. Gray
Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Republican Party officials, from the Bush administration down,
have denied involvement. But two of the groups, the 21st Century
Energy Project and the American Taxpayers Alliance, had ties to
prominent GOP strategists.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Castellanos, who produced ads for the American Taxpayer
Alliance, created TV spots the Republican Party ran in 2000 against
then-Vice President Al Gore.</TE>
<TE>   Gillespie, of the 21st Century group, has more direct ties to the
White House. He served as a top communications aide to Bush's
presidential campaign, assisted in his inauguration and helped
Commerce Secretary Don Evans set up his agency during the transition
from the Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   In January 2001, Gillespie's lobbying firm, Quinn Gillespie &amp;
Associates, was hired by Enron to press the company's case on tax and
energy issues. The firm was paid $700,000 for a year's work.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time my firm signed Enron as a client, they were on the
cover of national magazines as one of the best-run companies in
America," Gillespie said in an interview. "We had no idea about their
financial arrangements or their business model."</TE>
<TE>   Gillespie, a longtime GOP activist who was a key strategist in the
party's 1994 takeover of Congress, was frustrated last spring at the
political debate shaping up around Bush's national energy policy,
then being drafted behind closed doors by Vice President Dick Cheney.</TE>
<TE>   On April 10, Gillespie produced his four-page strategy memo. It
was intended, he said, for energy companies and industry trade
groups. He did not share the memo with Bush's political team or
Cheney's energy task force, Gillespie said, but his sentiments were
known from earlier conversations with White House officials.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't seek their approval or disapproval," he said. In fact,
he added, the White House chose not to follow his strategy
suggestions.</TE>
<TE>   But Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), a leading foe of the
administration's energy plan, criticized Gillespie's
behind-the-scenes activities. "Our nation's energy security is too
important to be used as a political weapon," Waxman said. "It's
unfortunate that one of the Bush administration's closest advisors
urged that it be used exactly that way."</TE>
<TE>   Waxman and other Democrats have pushed for details of Cheney's
meetings last year with representatives of Enron and other companies
as the vice president developed his energy policy. The General
Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, is preparing to
file suit to obtain the documents. The Bush administration maintains
that releasing the papers would impede its ability to get candid
advice.</TE>
<TE>   In the memo, Gillespie anticipated the "roll-out" of Bush's energy
plan and offered his ideas for ways to frame the debate in hopes of
taking "the fight to Davis and the Washington Democrats."</TE>
<TE>   "We can not underestimate the extent to which Democrats and
liberal groups will respond to the administration's energy policy
initiative," Gillespie wrote, forecasting a ferocity and intensity
not yet seen by the administration. "The proposal could promise to
meet future energy demands by harnessing wind and gerbils on
treadmills and it would make no difference--the gloves are coming
off."</TE>
<TE>   The memo suggested creating "a narrative about the liberals" to
counter the notion that "Republicans are in the pocket of big
business." To that end, Gillespie said, "We must make sure ... voters
understand their use of their SUVs, microwave ovens and televisions
are threatened."</TE>
<TE>   Gillespie said in an interview that the energy companies and trade
associations balked at his aggressive strategy. So instead, he turned
to conservative groups, which adopted his suggestions and agreed to
push the message under the banner of the 21st Century Energy Project.
The group sought to recast the energy debate as a choice between
abundance and austerity, just as Gillespie urged.</TE>
<TE>   "If some on the left have their way," one newspaper advertisement
read, "'soccer moms' will be forced to sell their minivans. They'll
be a luxury only the elite can afford."</TE>
<TE>   Last May, at a Washington news conference announcing the group's
formation, one member said the 21st Century group planned to spend
$500,000 on ads to counter "enviro-leftist propaganda." But Gillespie
indicated the group never reached that financial goal.</TE>
<TE>   "I struck out," he said, citing the energy companies'
unwillingness "to engage in this debate and take on the environmental
groups head-on."</TE>
<TE>   Nine months after its unveiling, Bush's energy plan is still
languishing in Congress.</TE>

<LD>Investors Await Economic Data</LD>
<LD>   The week's economic data--retail sales, business inventories, the
producer price index and consumer confidence--may show the economy is
starting to perk up.</LD>
<LD>   The Commerce Department will release its January retail sales
report Wednesday and offer Wall Street a hint of how consumer
spending is holding up. It took a dip of 0.1% in December.</LD>
<TE>   The producer price index--a measure of costs at the factory door
and farm gate--will be released by the Labor Department on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Investors also will be eyeing reports on business inventories,
industrial production, jobless claims and consumer confidence--hoping
for more hints the economy is on the path to recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Investors also are pinning their hopes on upbeat news from
companies slated to report quarterly results this week, including
Dell Computer Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co.</TE>
<TE>   More stock analysts are raising earnings estimates than cutting
them for the first time in 15 months--a hint the worst of the market
drops may be over.</TE>
<TE>   Upward revisions to annual earnings rose to 51% of the total in
the week ended Jan. 25, according to research firm Thomson
Financial/First Call. Not since the first week of November 2000 had
estimate increases outnumbered reports slashing forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   More than 80%, or more than 410, of the companies in the Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 have reported quarterly earnings so far, and a few more
results will straggle in this week.</TE>
<TE>   Companies slated to post their results include Applied Materials
Inc. and Viacom Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Other economic data due this week:</TE>
<TE>   * Thursday, the Labor Department will report on prices of imported
goods in January.</TE>
<TE>   * Thursday, the Commerce Department will report on business
inventories in December.</TE>
<TE>   * Friday, the Federal Reserve will report on industrial production
in January.</TE>
<TE>   * Friday, the University of Michigan will issue its preliminary
survey of consumer confidence for February.</TE>

<TE>   Bristol, ImClone Compromise Expected</TE>
<TE>   Pharmaceutical giant Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and its research
partner ImClone Systems Inc., reeling from a setback to their
anti-cancer drug Erbitux, will probably work toward a compromise even
as they fight in public over control of the drug, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   ImClone's directors are expected today to reject an ultimatum sent
several days ago by Bristol-Myers Squibb, demanding a bigger share of
future profit from Erbitux and more control over efforts to gain
regulatory approval. The big drug maker also demanded the resignation
of ImClone's top two executives.</TE>
<TE>   In September, Bristol-Myers Squibb agreed to pay up to $2 billion
for a 20% stake in ImClone in the belief Erbitux would be a
blockbuster drug. But the Food and Drug Administration in December
refused to review the tumor-fighting drug, saying ImClone had
provided insufficient clinical data.</TE>
<TE>   Congress and securities regulators are investigating allegations
that ImClone hid negative information about research into Erbitux.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said both companies have an incentive to compromise and
avoid a lengthy court battle.</TE>
<TE>   Unless a compromise is reached, Bristol-Myers will have to walk
away from its deal with ImClone, or take its partner to court for
breach of contract or fraud, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said a compromise also is in the interests of ImClone,
which needs to rebuild credibility with disgruntled shareholders.
ImClone has lost about two-thirds of its value since the FDA decision
in late December.</TE>

<TE>   Quanta Hopes to Block UtiliCorp Takeover</TE>
<TE>   Quanta Services Inc., which installs power and phone lines, plans
to fight an attempt by UtiliCorp United Inc., its biggest
shareholder, to take control of the company's board.</TE>
<TE>   UtiliCorp, the third-biggest U.S. utility owner, said Friday in a
Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it would present nine
nominees to the board at Quanta's annual meeting. A date for the
meeting hasn't been set.</TE>
<TE>   Quanta Chief Executive John Colson wrote in a letter over the
weekend to UtiliCorp CEO Richard Green Jr. that his company will
"vigorously oppose" the move.</TE>
<TE>   UtiliCorp previously tried to add to its 38% stake, prompting
Quanta to amend its shareholder agreement in November to block a
takeover.</TE>
<TE>   UtiliCorp, based in Kansas City, Mo., said in October that gaining
control of Quanta would allow it to make accounting changes and
benefit from the consolidation of the companies' financial
statements.</TE>
<TE>   In the Friday filing, UtiliCorp said its board nominees, if
elected, would take steps to boost Quanta's share price. UtiliCorp
also would consider selling or acquiring Houston-based Quanta, which
has a market value of about $738 million.</TE>
<TE>   Quanta shares have fallen 58% in the last year while UtiliCorp has
dropped 24%. Quanta rose 50 cents to $12.15 on Friday. UtiliCorp rose
32 cents to $22.74, both on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   UtiliCorp said its decision to try to oust Quanta's board was
spurred in part by the line installer's "disappointing financial
performance." Quanta's earnings fell 88% to $2.4million in the fourth
quarter. The utility owner reported a $6.2-million loss.</TE>

<HD>Bristol, ImClone Compromise Expected</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pharmaceutical giant Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and its research
partner ImClone Systems Inc., reeling from a setback to their
anti-cancer drug Erbitux, will probably work toward a compromise even
as they fight in public over control of the drug, analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   ImClone's directors are expected today to reject an ultimatum sent
several days ago by Bristol-Myers Squibb, demanding a bigger share of
future profit from Erbitux and more control over efforts to gain
regulatory approval. The big drug maker also demanded the resignation
of ImClone's top two executives.</LD>
<LD>   In September, Bristol-Myers Squibb agreed to pay up to $2 billion
for a 20% stake in ImClone in the belief Erbitux would be a
blockbuster drug. But the Food and Drug Administration in December
refused to review the tumor-fighting drug, saying ImClone had
provided insufficient clinical data.</LD>
<TE>   Congress and securities regulators are investigating allegations
that ImClone hid negative information about research into Erbitux.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said both companies have an incentive to compromise and
avoid a lengthy court battle.</TE>
<TE>   Unless a compromise is reached, Bristol-Myers will have to walk
away from its deal with ImClone, or take its partner to court for
breach of contract or fraud, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said a compromise also is in the interests of ImClone,
which needs to rebuild credibility with disgruntled shareholders.
ImClone has lost about two-thirds of its value since the FDA decision
in late December.</TE>

<HD>Quanta Hopes to Block UtiliCorp Takeover</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Quanta Services Inc., which installs power and phone lines, plans to
fight an attempt by UtiliCorp United Inc., its biggest shareholder,
to take control of the company's board.</LD>
<LD>   UtiliCorp, the third-biggest U.S. utility owner, said Friday in a
Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it would present nine
nominees to the board at Quanta's annual meeting. A date for the
meeting hasn't been set.</LD>
<LD>   Quanta Chief Executive John Colson wrote in a letter over the
weekend to UtiliCorp CEO Richard Green Jr. that his company will
"vigorously oppose" the move.</LD>
<TE>   UtiliCorp previously tried to add to its 38% stake, prompting
Quanta to amend its shareholder agreement in November to block a
takeover.</TE>
<TE>   UtiliCorp, based in Kansas City, Mo., said in October that gaining
control of Quanta would allow it to make accounting changes and
benefit from the consolidation of the companies' financial
statements.</TE>
<TE>   In the Friday filing, UtiliCorp said its board nominees, if
elected, would take steps to boost Quanta's share price. UtiliCorp
also would consider selling or acquiring Houston-based Quanta, which
has a market value of about $738 million.</TE>
<TE>   Quanta shares have fallen 58% in the last year while UtiliCorp has
dropped 24%. Quanta rose 50 cents to $12.15 on Friday. UtiliCorp rose
32 cents to $22.74, both on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   UtiliCorp said its decision to try to oust Quanta's board was
spurred in part by the line installer's "disappointing financial
performance." Quanta's earnings fell 88% to $2.4million in the fourth
quarter. The utility owner reported a $6.2-million loss.</TE>

<HD>Employee Not Liable for Customer's Bill</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: After my daughter was hired as a waitress, a customer used
a stolen credit card to pay his $60 tab.</LD>
<LD>   Since my daughter did not ask the customer to show identification,
the restaurant owner said she was responsible for paying the crook's
tab from her tip money. She paid.</LD>
<LD>   Can her boss do that? If not, what can she do to get back the
money?</LD>
<TE>   --L.W., Alhambra</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Your daughter's boss did not have the right to make that
deduction from her tip money just because she failed to ask the
customer to show an ID.</TE>
<TE>   The law generally prohibits an employer from making deductions
from an employee's wages--your daughter's earned tips are just as
much a part of her wages as her hourly compensation--due to cash
shortages or breakage or other losses. The law assumes that is a
normal risk of doing business.</TE>
<TE>   The only exception is where the employer can prove that the loss
was caused by the employee's dishonest or willful act, or that it was
due to gross negligence.</TE>
<TE>   This rule is in Section 8 of the Wage Order that covers
restaurants. It should be posted where your daughter works.</TE>
<TE>   She may want to point out this section to her boss and try to get
her money back. If that doesn't work, your daughter can file a claim
with the California state labor commissioner's office, which will
help her get it back.</TE>

<TE>   Disability Benefits for Injuries Unrelated to Job</TE>
<TE>   Q: I have been told that I must have surgery for a hernia, but my
company does not offer sick days.</TE>
<TE>   Can I collect disability? I did not get the injury at my current
job.</TE>
<TE>   --A.I., Huntington Park</TE>
<TE>   A: You can obtain state disability benefits for injuries unrelated
to work, regardless of whether the company offers you sick days.
Workers' compensation benefits apply to workplace injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Employees should carefully evaluate injuries before designating
their ailment as a disability rather than a workplace injury,
however. If your hernia problem was caused at least partially by
lifting or other workplace duties, you might be justified in
requesting workers' compensation benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Disability benefits are limited to a period of months, whereas
workers' compensation benefits can continue indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   You also might be eligible for workers' compensation if your
injury occurred at a previous job.</TE>
<TE>   If your employer has more than 50 employees and you have worked
there for about a year, you may be eligible under the Family Medical
Leave Act for 12 weeks of unpaid medical leave with an assurance of a
job upon your return.</TE>
<TE>   Even if you have no sick days, you might consider using vacation
time so that you are paid during your absence.</TE>

<TE>   Employer Must Honor Earned Vacation</TE>
<TE>   Q: I suffered an on-the-job injury in the same month that I was
scheduled for a week of vacation. My injury kept me from working the
entire month.</TE>
<TE>   When I asked about rescheduling my vacation, my supervisor told me
they were too short-staffed and that I would just lose the vacation
time.</TE>
<TE>   Since vacations are earned in the previous year, can they legally
drop my vacation without paying for it?</TE>
<TE>   --D.B., Laguna Hills</TE>
<TE>   A: Once vacation is earned, an employer may not require employees
to forfeit it for any reason.</TE>
<TE>   They either have to be allowed to take their earned vacation, or
they must be paid all unused earned vacation at the time they
terminate.</TE>
<TE>   Employers may, however, have a rule that an employee accrues no
new vacation benefits if his or her vacation accrual reaches a
maximum amount under a vacation pay policy.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't sound as though your employer is trying to do that, but
you should make sure you understand your employer's intentions before
you raise the issue.</TE>

<KH>EXECUTIVE ROUNDTABLE</KH>
<HD>Looking at Best Time to Sell Firm</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Executive Roundtable is a weekly column by TEC Worldwide, an
international organization of more than 7,000 business owners,
company presidents and chief executives. TEC members meet in small
peer groups to share their business experiences and help one another
solve problems in a round-table session. The following question and
answer is a summary of a discussion at a recent TEC meeting in
Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Question: I own a small manufacturing company and have been
running it my entire adult life. The business is doing well, but I
just don't have the passion for it that I used to. In fact, I
frequently dread coming to the office in the morning, when it used to
be so much fun.</LD>
<LD>   I constantly think about selling out, but I wouldn't know what to
do with myself after the business is gone. This is all I have ever
done.</LD>
<TE>   Should I sell now, or should I wait and see if this is just a
phase I'm going through?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Running a business is hard enough when you enjoy doing it.
Take away the passion and the fun and it can quickly become
unbearable drudgery. Before dropping your business, however, you
would be well-served to take a long, hard look at the issues
involved.</TE>
<TE>   Getting top dollar for your most important asset requires
analyzing a host of economic factors such as market conditions,
acquisition trends, the health of your business and the availability
of potential buyers.</TE>
<TE>   Do these indicators point to a bull market for sellers in your
industry, or would you get a better return on your investment by
waiting for more favorable market conditions?</TE>
<TE>   You also need to consider your current financial situation and
your long-term financial goals.</TE>
<TE>   If you sell now, will you take enough money off the table (after
taxes) to fund your current and future financial needs? If not, what
does the business have to be worth to enable you to achieve financial
independence, and what do you need to do to get the business to that
point?</TE>
<TE>   The answers to these questions will play a major role in
determining when and how to sell a business.</TE>
<TE>   Equally important, says Seth Krugliak, chief executive of Five
Guys Named Moe in North Hollywood, is the issue of how you intend to
spend your time after you leave the business.</TE>
<TE>   "The worst thing you could do is sell your company without knowing
what you want to do," Krugliak said.</TE>
<TE>   "For the first time in 30 years, you'll have all the time in the
world on your hands with no purpose or aim in life. Before making any
major decisions about the business, you need to figure out a way to
rekindle the spark in you and find something else--whether that
involves another business, recreation, philanthropy or whatever--that
will allow you to have a fulfilling second part of your life."</TE>
<TE>   Charting a course for the rest of your life, however, is no easy
task. Phyllis Murphy, CEO of Burbank-based P. Murphy &amp; Associates,
suggests sticking your toes in the water before diving headfirst into
the unknown.</TE>
<TE>   "Start out slowly," she said. "Find a way to rearrange your
schedule and/or delegate some of your responsibilities so that you
can work five days a week instead of six. This will allow you to see
how you handle an extra day of recreation. More important, it will
give you time to look around for something new that might reignite
your passion."</TE>
<TE>   Arnold Zane, president of the Energy Club in Pacoima, echoes the
need to develop new interests. But he recommends a lengthier period
of exploration.</TE>
<TE>   "Assuming you have a competent management team in place, why not
take an extended hiatus of several weeks or even a few months?" he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "That would allow you to determine whether you truly enjoy having
a lot of free time or just think you want it. On the other hand, you
might discover you still love what you're doing but just need a
change of pace. If so, you could bring someone on board to take over
the day-to-day operations of the company, which would free you up to
do what you enjoy most."</TE>
<TE>   Ted Alred, president of Ontic Engineering and Manufacturing in
Chatsworth, favors a more radical approach.</TE>
<TE>   "I say let go of the business first and then figure out what you
want to do," he said. "As long as you remain in the driver's seat,
any decision you make will come out of a business owner's mind-set.
Consequently, you won't be totally free and open to new ideas as you
begin to explore possibilities for your life beyond the business."</TE>

<HD>Nike Sues Sega and Its Agency Over Game Ad</HD>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nike Inc. has a message for video game publisher Sega of America and
its recent basketball ads: Just don't do it.</LD>
<LD>   The world's largest maker of athletic shoes and clothing filed
suit last week against Sega and its advertising agency claiming their
television ad featuring a shattering dunk shot was an unfair copy of
an earlier Nike campaign starring basketball legend Michael Jordan.</LD>
<LD>   In the suit filed in federal court in Oregon, Nike alleges that
the commercial produced by Sega, a unit of Japan's Sega Corp., and
Leagas Delaney Inc. to promote Sega's "NBA 2K2" basketball game is
too similar to a Nike ad called "Frozen Moment" that depicted Jordan
in slow motion.</LD>
<TE>   Beaverton, Ore.-based Nike is asking for an injunction barring the
ad from further airplay, an order impounding copies of the ad and
either damages for the alleged infringement or a royalty on every
copy of the game sold.</TE>

<LD>Online music distributor FullAudio has chosen Microsoft's
digital-music format and encryption technology for its forthcoming
song-rental service. FullAudio's service, which offers downloadable
songs from Universal and EMI for a monthly fee, is expected to start
rolling out in March on the Web sites of 30 Clear Channel radio
stations, including KBIG and KIIS in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Initially, the rented songs will play only on the subscriber's
computer, but portable devices are expected this year that will be
compatible with the service. Prices and other terms of the service,
which will compete with ventures owned by the major record companies,
have not been announced.</LD>

<LD>Handspring Inc. today will accept U.S. orders for Treo, its new
pocket-sized combination phone and organizer, a move experts say puts
it a step up on rival hand-held makers, but thrusts it into the
bull's-eye of the formidable cell phone industry.</LD>
<LD>   Treo will be available from Handspring's Web site, with the first
orders expected to be delivered by the end of February. The device
will reach electronics retailers in March, the company said.</LD>
<LD>   Available with either a built-in keyboard or handwriting
recognition tablet, Treo will sell for about $400 with a new cellular
activation, and $550 without.</LD>
<TE>   Cingular Wireless and VoiceStream Wireless will offer mobile
service for the device, which boasts 16 megabytes of memory, and can
browse the Web, send and receive e-mail and other messages, as well
as store contacts and appointments.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Not to be outdone by satellite TV provider EchoStar Communications
Inc., cable operator Charter Communications Inc. plans to deploy an
advanced set-top box later this year that offers digital video
recording, telephone service, wireless home networking and a
high-speed Internet connection.</LD>
<LD>   Many details about the box, which will be manufactured by Motorola
Inc. with software from Digeo Inc., won't be disclosed until later
this year. Like EchoStar, which announced plans in January to deploy
a multipurpose box from Moxi Digital Inc., Charter wants to put a
high-powered device into customers' homes to sell more entertainment
and communications services.</LD>
<LD>   Cable companies have resisted these boxes for several years, in
part because the technology wasn't ready and the demand from
consumers was limited, said media analyst Paul Kagan. But Charter,
which is owned by former Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's Vulcan
Ventures, is jumping out ahead of the pack because it wants to be
seen as the technology leader, Kagan said.</LD>
<TE>   Allen also owns Digeo, which develops software for interactive TV
services.</TE>

<HD>Studios Assail ReplayTV Technology</HD>
<DH>Courts: Lawsuits claim the key functions of personal video
recorders violate copyrights.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the makers of personal video recorders broaden the appeal of their
revolutionary devices, a group of Hollywood studios is attacking the
recorders' core functions.</LD>
<LD>   PVRs are the digital successor to videocassette recorders, storing
programs digitally on a high-capacity computer hard drive instead of
removable tapes. They play tricks with live programs--pausing,
rewinding and replaying them in mid-broadcast--and make it simple to
find and record shows that match one's tastes.</LD>
<LD>   Two of the leading PVR brands, TiVo and ReplayTV, recently
announced plans to deliver more types of entertainment through their
devices, including digital music services and online video
programming.</LD>
<TE>   Sonicblue Inc., the Santa Clara-based firm behind ReplayTV, plans
to sell a version of its recorder this fall for less than other PVRs
on the market.</TE>
<TE>   Sonicblue is steaming ahead, despite four lawsuits filed by
Hollywood studios just as the ReplayTV 4000 was being introduced in
November.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuits, which were brought by the largest TV networks and
all seven major Hollywood movie companies, say the ReplayTV recorders
violate copyrights by enabling users to send videos to other ReplayTV
boxes over the Internet and skip commercials automatically.</TE>
<TE>   The suit filed by MGM, Fox, Universal Studios and Orion Pictures
goes furthest, arguing that it's illegal to let consumers record and
store shows based on the genre, actors or other words in the program
description. This claim threatens not just the ReplayTV devices, some
copyright experts say, but all recorders like it.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike VCRs, which require users to record shows by time slot or
unique number, PVRs record based on a show's name or program
description. Users don't need to know when "Friends" is on. They just
need to know the name or a leading actor. Once a program is found,
the device can be set to capture it whenever it's on the air.</TE>
<TE>   The MGM lawsuit contends that ReplayTV 4000's expanded storage and
sorting features encourage consumers to assemble libraries of
copyrighted material, eating into the market for those shows.</TE>
<TE>   "If a ReplayTV customer can simply type 'The X-Files' or 'James
Bond' and have every episode of 'The X-Files' and every James Bond
film recorded in perfect digital form and organized, compiled and
stored on the hard drive of his or her ReplayTV 4000 device, it will
cause substantial harm to the market for prerecorded DVD,
videocassette and other copies of those episodes and films," the
lawsuit states.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with this argument, several copyright attorneys say,
is that consumers already can compile such libraries with a VCR,
albeit less conveniently.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a feature that couldn't be duplicated by someone with
even a minimal amount of effort," said J.D. Harriman II, a patent and
entertainment attorney with Coudert Bros. law firm in Los Angeles.
"And because all these TV guides are online already, it wouldn't be
that hard."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Lemley, a UC Berkeley law professor, said, "It's troubling to
say, 'This thing that everybody does has been illegal for 20 years.
... We're just getting around to catching you.'</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody's suing people who actually infringe copyrights anymore.
Everyone is suing people who make devices," Lemley said. "The
[studios] are going after the creation of new technology."</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the studios involved in the MGM suit said that
although the studios favor new technological advances, "new
technology must go hand in hand with copyright protection." She
declined to comment on the claim that keyword-based recording
violates copyrights, focusing instead on ReplayTV 4000's ability to
send shows over the Internet and delete commercials automatically.</TE>
<TE>   The fundamental question posed by the MGM suit is whether the
financial effect on the studios trumped consumers' ability to copy
programs for personal use, said Douglas Wood, a New York attorney who
specializes in intellectual-property and advertising law. If MGM wins
on that point, he said, "We'd be left with plain old VCRs."</TE>
<TE>   He's not betting on the studios, though, given the Supreme Court's
1984 ruling that consumers could legally record programs for the sake
of watching them later.</TE>
<TE>   "What difference does it make how I do it?" Wood said. "The
dilemma is, the technology is turning the business model upside down.
But that doesn't mean it's copyright infringement."</TE>

<HD>Hand-Held Divergence</HD>
<DH>Computers: Sony Clie T615C is a sleek PDA, whereas Palm
i705 touts wireless features.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM HEID</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This is a tale of two hand-helds: Sony Corp.'s Clie T615C and Palm
Inc.'s i705. It's also a story about how hand-held computers have
diversified--both devices run the Palm operating system, but Sony and
Palm are taking different paths to your pocket.</LD>
<LD>   In one hand, there is Sony's Clie model. (That name is pronounced
clee-AY, and it sits alongside the Vaio model in the "What Were They
Thinking?" wing of the Name Recognition Hall of Fame.) The $400 T615C
is a lovely hand-held, sleeker and trimmer than the Palm i705, with
16 megabytes of memory--twice that of the Palm.</LD>
<LD>   The T615C sports some unique hardware, starting with a spectacular
color screen capable of 320-by-20 resolution, twice that of the Palm
and far brighter. It even does justice to photographs--prop up the
T615C on its flip-over leather cover, run the bundled PhotoStand
software and you have a high-tech picture frame that displays slide
shows.</LD>
<TE>   Like other Sony hand-helds, the T615C has a clever "jog wheel"
contraption that allows for one-handed operation--no grappling with
the stylus while trying to hold on to the pole of a crowded bus. You
still need the stylus to enter text, of course, but the jog wheel
lets you single-handedly start programs and retrieve contacts or
appointments.</TE>
<TE>   It also has a slot for Sony Memory Stick modules. If you have a
Sony digital camera that uses Memory Sticks, you can view your photos
on the T615C's screen. Sony also sells a $149 module that snaps into
the Memory Stick slot and turns the hand-held into a low-resolution
digital camera.</TE>
<TE>   Sony bills the T615C as a "personal entertainment organizer." The
T615C includes software that turns it into a remote control for your
TV and stereo. It works, but tapping tiny buttons with the stylus is
tedious.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its billing, the T615C can't play MP3 music tracks.
(Sony's pricier Clie N760 can.) You can, however, add MP3 playback
with a $129 snap-on accessory.</TE>
<TE>   In the other hand, there is Palm's $449 i705. The 5.9-ounce device
weighs an ounce more than the Clie T615C and it's slightly larger.
But the most noticeable difference is the screen. The screen on the
T615C makes you say, "Wow," but the i705 prompts you to wonder, "Is
it turned on?"</TE>
<TE>   What sets the Palm i705 apart is its wireless e-mail and Internet
features. If Sony is going after the digital-lifestyle set, Palm is
courting the crowd that checks e-mail during romantic dinners.</TE>
<TE>   To make the system work, you have to sign up for Palm .Net
Wireless Service. The i705, with its built-in wireless modem, will
check up to eight e-mail accounts several times a minute, even when
off. When e-mail arrives, a light on top of the i705 flashes. (You
also can have the i705 beep or vibrate.)</TE>
<TE>   Staying in touch isn't cheap. Palm.Net costs $20 a month for an
account limited to 100 kilobytes a month--a limit only the most
reticent users could abide by. Unlimited access costs $40 a month.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder industry analysts describe wireless services as a
potential boon to hand-held manufacturers, whose profit margins are
thinner than a Clie.</TE>
<TE>   The i705 also includes America Online's Instant Messenger
software, so you can chat wirelessly too. And the Palm.Net
subscription includes access to "Web clippings"--condensed, text-only
versions of some 580 major Web sites, 50 of which are preinstalled.</TE>
<TE>   The Clie T615C and Palm i705 are both excellent high-end
hand-helds. I prefer the Clie model for its size and screen, but if
wireless e-mail was my raison d'hand-held, the i705 would be the
obvious choice.</TE>
<TE>   The i705 also holds appeal for Mac users--Sony doesn't include Mac
software for the T615C, though rudimentary syncing software is
available from third-party firms.</TE>

<HD>Nicholas' Niche</HD>
<DH>Broadcom's CEO talks about prospects for the chip firm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. HUFFSTUTTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When it comes to the semiconductor industry, the ride from Wall
Street darling to investor whipping boy can be a roller coaster.</LD>
<LD>   For Irvine-based chip maker Broadcom Corp. and Chief Executive
Henry T. Nicholas III, the ride is a rush--even during down times.
Three years ago, when dot-coms were flourishing and PC sales seemed
never-ending, Broadcom was hailed as the young upstart snarling at
its giant rival, Intel Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of making the brains of the computer, as Intel does, the
Orange County company focuses on the chips used in routers, switches,
networking and PC equipment and in the interactive set-top boxes that
let machines talk to each other.</LD>
<TE>   But the company has hit a low point. The semiconductor industry
suffered its worst year in 2001, with sales falling more than 30%.
Stock prices have plummeted, competition is growing among Asian
companies and the industry is mired in red ink.</TE>
<TE>   One belief inside Broadcom's executive offices remains constant:
High-speed Internet access--whether in the form of cable modems, DSL
or some variation on wireless broadband--is here to stay. That's good
news for Broadcom, which has invested heavily in the technology.</TE>
<TE>   It's maneuvering through the ups and downs of the business that is
the challenge, Nicholas said.</TE>
<TE>   Question: Why is the semiconductor industry having such a hard
time recovering from the tech slump?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Historically, the cycle has been dominated by the personal
computing boom-bust cycle. What we are experiencing right now is kind
of a hiatus in the growth in some segments.</TE>
<TE>   First of all, there was the Internet bubble. In this period of
hyper-growth, a bunch of dot-coms used investors' money to buy
networking equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Then you had those companies cease to exist. They were not only
discontinuing their purchases, but also selling [the networking
equipment] for 50 cents on the dollar on EBay.</TE>
<TE>   The second is in the wide-area networking space: DSL and DSL
equipment. There were large purchases, which were again [fueled] by
Wall Street's irrational exuberance.</TE>
<TE>   Last, the personal computer is fundamentally changing. The
boom-bust cycle was driven principally by successive processor
generations. What's happening is the processor is becoming less
important.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Is there anything that you wish you knew five years ago that
you know now?</TE>
<TE>   A: Boy, it's great to be right. When we took the company public,
the investment bankers were horrified that we didn't want to call
ourselves Broad.com.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Did the semiconductor industry feel the change before the
dot-com market collapsed?</TE>
<TE>   A: I think there were a lot of companies that were completely and
totally blindsided. I think that's shown by the number of
pre-announcements [of lower earnings].</TE>
<TE>   One year ago, you had Cisco make two pre-announcements. You had
Motorola, [Texas Instruments], Intel do the same. These are all
caused by catastrophic events that happened within a quarter.</TE>
<TE>   We essentially made one pre-announcement, which was driven by one
very large event that happened with one of our customers, 3Com.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Why did the bubble burst on dot-coms?</TE>
<TE>   A: The Internet really was not an effective vehicle for building a
business. You had to have ubiquitous access, it had to be always on,
and the most important thing, it had to be transparent. And it's
clearly not transparent today.</TE>
<TE>   Our objective is to make [the Internet] invisible, transparent. It
should be as easy to use as a channel on TV. You should be able to
watch a commercial, press a button that says "buy" and receive the
goods and services you're looking at. If it's not that simple, we
think it's not going to be a successful medium.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: If the Internet and these new communication products don't
succeed, what does that mean for Broadcom?</TE>
<TE>   A: Consumer spending is down quarter on quarter, but consumers are
still spending. Each consumer has a certain amount of disposable
income. Now, he can get into his car and drive to Wal-Mart. Or he can
get onto some electronic network and buy music or a video.</TE>
<TE>   With respect to the semiconductor market, there's very little
silicon that goes into the bricks and mortar of Wal-Mart. There's
quite a bit of it that goes into a consumer electronic device that
helps you more efficiently distribute music or video.</TE>
<TE>   Even in a recessionary time, you have to look at the number of
dollars that consumers spend and convince them to say, "I'm going to
now turn on my TV [or computer]. I'm paying 30 cents a song instead
of $12 a compact disc."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: What happens to Broadcom, and the industry as a whole, if
you're wrong?</TE>
<TE>   A: People would have to discontinue purchasing all the platforms
of today for it to have a material adverse effect.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe we're looking too far ahead. I look at our vision and the
one thing I don't see us missing is the next wave. I look back at
what we've done. I can't think of anything we would have done
differently.</TE>

<HD>Newest Suffixes Help to Increase Net's Population</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The pioneers in cyberspace adopted Internet identities ending in
".net," ".org" and ".com." These days, colonizers of the newest
territory on the Net are staking their claims with suffixes such as
".name," ".info" and ".biz."</LD>
<LD>   The venerable ".com" is still by far the most popular designation,
accounting for approximately 22.5million of the 35 million Internet
domain names registered worldwide. But that popularity prompted the
need for new suffixes to relieve the congestion.</LD>
<LD>   Now, the Art Institute of Chicago can be reached at
www.chicago.art.museum, a more intuitive address than its www.artic
.edu. The New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority is easier to
find at www.mta.info than at www.mta.nyc.ny.us. Altogether, about
277,000 institutions, businesses and individuals have signed up for
the new top-level domain names, or TLDs, as the suffixes are known.</LD>
<TE>   The first, ".info," was launched in September. Four more--".biz,"
".museum," ".name" and ".coop"--have come online since then. This
year, ".aero" and ".pro" are expected to debut and countless more
could follow. Most domain names sell for around $30.</TE>
<TE>   The Internet Corp. for Assigned Names and Numbers, a Santa Monica
organization that oversees Internet addresses, approved the seven new
top-level domains in 2000 to let latecomers to the Internet create
addresses based on names that already have been taken in ".com."
Trademark and legal battles delayed their introduction until
recently. Though the new suffixes compete with ".com," they target
specific groups of Internet users.</TE>
<TE>   "Each one of the domains is going to acquire its own neighborhood
feeling," said Roland LaPlante, chief marking officer of Afilias USA,
the Newtown, Pa.-based company that operates the ".info" registry.
"People will want to have addresses in the right neighborhood on the
Internet, and people will want to go to addresses in the right
neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   The suffixes debut at a time when domain name registration overall
has slowed considerably. Last year, only 600,000 new addresses were
registered ending in ".com," ".net" and ".org," according to VeriSign
Inc., which operates those registries. By comparison, the total
number of registrations more than tripled in 2000, rising to 28.2
million from 8.9 million in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Most businesses and organizations purchased domain names early.
Many addresses have disappeared from the Internet as companies have
consolidated or shut down, and speculators who couldn't resell their
names let their rights expire.</TE>
<TE>   But officials at NetNames International Ltd., an international
domain name management service based in London, still expect to see
substantial growth in the coming years. With billions of people and
businesses worldwide, the 35 million addresses registered are
"actually the tip of the iceberg," said Jonathan Robinson, NetNames'
business development director.</TE>
<TE>   Among the new TLDs, ".info," has been the most popular, with about
700,000 registrations since September. About half a million addresses
have been registered with ".biz" endings. The ".coop" suffix, which
is less than 2 weeks old, has about 5,000.</TE>
<TE>   Other names could be more popular. The ".name" suffix for
individuals, which is managed by Global Name Registry Ltd., creates
addresses with a person's first and last names separated by a period.
By including middle initials and reversing first and last names, each
unique name could be translated into about 40 different addresses
without having to add numbers, said Andrew Tsai, chief executive of
Global Name Registry. That means there are billions of potential
domain names, Tsai said. About 150,000 of them have been registered
since ".name" was launched Jan. 15.</TE>
<TE>   Some suffixes are not expected to receive more than a few thousand
registrations because they are restricted to specific communities.
Only museums can register for the ".museum" suffix, for example.
Because there are only about 40,000 recognized museums worldwide,
registry owner Museum Domain Management Assn. does not expect the
total number of domains to grow beyond five figures, association
President Cary Karp said. About 2,000 addresses have been activated.</TE>
<TE>   The success of the new domain names will largely depend on how
they are used. Japanese auto maker Subaru recently purchased
www.wrx.info to promote its new Impreza WRX sedan. The company
already has a corporate site at www.subaru.com.</TE>
<TE>   Other businesses and organizations that have registered ".info"
and ".biz" addresses simply use the new sites to redirect people to
their ".com" locations, said Ellen Rony, co-author of "The Domain
Name Handbook."</TE>
<TE>   "That's not expanded name space," she said. "That's duplicated
name space."</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, the new suffixes may not make it easier to find the
appropriate site. The new ".info" site for New York's MTA, for
example, is similar to sites for the Los Angeles Metropolitan
Transportation Authority (www.mta.net) and the Market Technicians
Assn. (www.mta.org).</TE>
<TE>   Because people are accustomed to visiting ".com" sites, those
ending in other suffixes may have to work harder to entice visitors.</TE>
<TE>   "Dot-com is going to be, at least for the immediate future, the
Park Avenue of Internet addresses," said VeriSign spokesman Patrick
Burns.</TE>
<TE>   Operating profit at the Mountain View, Calif.-based company rose
80% to $244 million last year, as revenue doubled to $984 million.</TE>
<TE>   "It's what we know and it's part of our vernacular," Burns said.
"But it was built up over time, just like the other Web extensions
have the opportunities to be built up over time."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Site Specific</TE>
<TE>   ".Com" may be the Park Avenue of domain names (distantly followed
by ".net" and ".org"), but new top-level domains are finding their
own place on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   In September, the Internet Corp. for Assigned Names and Numbers
introduced ".info," followed by ".biz," ".museum," ".name" and
".coop." Two other domain names, ".aero" and ".pro," are expected to
debut this year.</TE>
<TE>   Here is the approximate number of registered names for each
top-level domain, as of early February:</TE>
<TE>   * .com: 22.5 million</TE>
<TE>   * .net: 3.9 million</TE>
<TE>   * .org: 2.5 million</TE>
<TE>   * .info: 700,000</TE>
<TE>   * .biz: 500,000</TE>
<TE>   * .name: 150,000</TE>
<TE>   * .coop: 5,000</TE>
<TE>   *.museum: 2,000</TE>

<HD>Workers Have the Godly on Their Side</HD>
<DH>Labor: Clergy's backing of L.A. hotel union is latest sign
of a national trend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Religious activists have adopted the cause of 240 union workers fired
more than a year ago when their airport hotel was sold, staging
vigils and preaching from the pulpit in a campaign that couldn't come
at a worse time for owners of the LAX Radisson.</LD>
<LD>   In recent years, 60 interfaith groups have sprung up from
Pennsylvania to Oregon to address labor issues, all affiliated with
the Chicago-based National Interfaith Committee for Worker Justice.
The trend is particularly strong in Los Angeles, home of Clergy and
Laity United for Economic Justice, known as CLUE, which grew out of
the labor-backed "Living Wage" campaign in the mid-1990s.</LD>
<LD>   Veterans of that effort, which resulted in higher wages for many
employees of city contractors, went on to support union campaigns
involving low-wage workers in the private sector, from hotel
housekeepers in Beverly Hills to airport security screeners and
county home-care workers.</LD>
<TE>   "The beauty of it is we never fail to get energized," said the
Rev. Richard Gillette, an Episcopal minister and former CLUE
director. "At its best the labor movement is for dignity, respect and
a living wage for all working people, and that's something that
people in the religious community can identify with."</TE>
<TE>   Clerics said the LAX Radisson has become a priority for the group
because it symbolizes larger issues, including an erosion of wages,
and jobs, in inner-city communities over the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   Friday night, more than 100 religious leaders, some wearing
vestments, waved picket signs, held candles and prayed with union
activists and former workers outside the Radisson. The gathering
included rabbis, Catholic priests, Muslim clerics and several
busloads of urban Episcopal ministers, who were in town for an annual
assembly.</TE>
<TE>   While police directed traffic around the unusual scene, hotel
managers watched from the lobby doors and a few guests peered out of
windows. It was the largest in a series of monthly vigils held there
since June.</TE>
<TE>   Ashok Israni, chief executive of Pacifica Host Inc., the San Diego
investment firm that owns and operates the hotel, would not comment
on the campaign. The Radisson franchises its name to the hotel but is
not involved in daily operations.</TE>
<TE>   Israni's attorney, Scott Wilson, noted that the hotel workers
union failed to prove charges of discriminatory hiring practices
filed with the National Labor Relations Board.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson said the hotel, which is struggling to build clientele at a
time when the travel industry remains in a deep slump, would rather
the protesters go away. "Obviously, the owners don't like this
publicity," Wilson said. But he added they had done nothing unlawful.</TE>
<TE>   Hotel owners met with union representatives several times during
the summer but failed to reach a compromise. Both sides said they are
at an impasse.</TE>
<TE>   CLUE took on the Radisson--formerly a Wyndham Hotel--soon after it
was sold in the fall of 2000. The hotel had been one of only three
union hotels near the airport, and was the only union lodging on the
busy Century Boulevard corridor. That made it a strategic location
for the hotel workers union.</TE>
<TE>   As it changed hands, the entire work force--including 240 members
of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Local 814--was fired.
The building underwent substantial renovation before it reopened a
year later.</TE>
<TE>   As new employees were hired, they received handbooks that informed
them, among other things, that the hotel preferred to remain
non-union, Wilson confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   Union and religious activists claim the hotel refused to hire
former employees because they might be sympathetic to the union,
although that was not sustained by the NLRB. Wilson said former
employees were free to apply, along with all others, and that they
were judged on their merits.</TE>
<TE>   Lead union organizer Manuel Ramon said only 14 former unionized
employees now work at the hotel, but Wilson put the number at 28. He
noted that because business is slow, the hotel is not fully staffed.</TE>
<TE>   The union, and the religious activists backing them, want the
hotel to hire former employees first. "We have workers who worked
there 20, sometimes 30 years," Ramon said. "They're still 10 to 15
years from retirement, but they're in that age where it's really
difficult to get them placed." Many have not found work since they
were let go. A union contract settled shortly before the hotel was
sold put wages for beginning housekeepers at nearly $10 per hour,
plus fully paid family health benefits, Ramon said. He said the hotel
now is paying the same workers $7.25, with a less generous insurance
plan. Wilson said he could not confirm or deny the wage figures.</TE>
<TE>   The activists also want hotel owners to recognize the union if a
majority of employees sign pledge cards, rather than require them to
go through a lengthy, and probably contentious, federally supervised
election. But Wilson said the so-called card-check process is out of
the question. "If [the union] wants to organize those employees, they
know how to do it the old-fashioned way," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But with a contingent of religious leaders backing them, union
organizers are trying to force the hotel to rehire the workers and
remain neutral in an organizing campaign. Along with the vigils,
religious leaders have brought former hotel employees to address
their congregations and made frequent house calls to the unemployed,
to keep them engaged in the fight.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of my parishioners knew people who were directly affected,"
said the Rev. Anna Olson, associate rector at Holy Faith Episcopal
Church in Inglewood. "This fight represents so many of the larger
issues for that community. We're saying this is a community where
good jobs are the thing that is most needed, and they were taken
away."</TE>
<TE>   Though there have been few tangible victories so far, the
protesters maintain it's only a matter of time before hotel owners
give in. "How many years was Moses in the desert?" asked the Rev.
Alexia Salvatierra, a Lutheran minister who directs CLUE. "You don't
expect it to be resolved in six months. These battles sometimes take
many years."</TE>

<HD>Vacation Home Sales Sliding</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Purchases in California fell 15% last year.
Factors include terrorism, stock market woes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Usually at this time of year, when the desert sun merely sizzles
instead of scorches, people flock to buy vacation homes in the
resorts of the Coachella Valley. But so far, the prime season for
home buying in this area seems as arid as the breeze there.</LD>
<LD>   In Palm Springs, Palm Desert, Rancho Mirage and other cities
across the valley, vacation home sales plunged 20% last year, even
though sales of all homes in Southern California held steady. And
this winter has been particularly slow for higher-end homes in the
Coachella Valley--California's biggest vacation-home market.</LD>
<LD>   "There's no urgency in the market," said Bruce Blomgren, an agent
at Dyson &amp; Dyson Real Estate who specializes in luxury properties in
Indian Wells, east of Palm Springs. "Buyers may look, but it's hard
to get them excited about making a purchase."</LD>
<TE>   Such doldrums are shared in vacation-home resorts across the
country, which have not been as resilient during the downturn as the
housing market overall.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of second homes in California fell 15% last year, according
to DataQuick Information Systems Inc. Comparable figures for the U.S.
aren't available, but brokers from a number of resort areas say sales
have softened.</TE>
<TE>   In the mountains of Park City, Utah, broker Dennis Hanlon
estimated that vacation home sales declined 5% to 8% in 2001 compared
with the previous year. Hanlon is president of the Rocky Mountain
Resort Alliance, which represents Realtors in five states and British
Columbia. He said sales have picked up a bit lately as the economy
has shown signs of improvement.</TE>
<TE>   But in places like northeast Connecticut, there are few
indications of an immediate rebound. Stephen Drezen, a broker at
Landmark Real Estate in Goshen, said sales so far have fallen about
20% from a year earlier, which he attributed to the lingering effects
of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the war in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "A property that a year ago took a few weeks to sell is now taking
a few months," said Christian Duhaime, manager of Remax Consultants
Realty in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He expects the appreciation rate of
second homes in his area to slow this year to between 4% and 5% from
double-digit growth in each of the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   Such talk is a striking contrast to the breathless pace during the
late '90s, when demand for second homes soared along with rising
incomes, an aging population and favorable tax laws. Many of those
factors have led industry watchers such as Clark Thompson, chief
executive of online vacation home seller EscapeHomes.com, to say
sales of second homes should keep growing at a good clip over the
next decade.</TE>
<TE>   But with the economic uncertainties and the sluggish stock market
weighing on people's financial portfolios, many consumers remain
reluctant to splurge on a second or third dwelling. Also, fewer
out-of-town visitors have been flying into resort areas since Sept.
11. Although tourists account for a small share of purchases, their
absence nonetheless has been keenly felt by home sellers and real
estate brokers.</TE>
<TE>   DataQuick, which compiled the second-home figures for The Times by
analyzing transaction records, said some vacation-home areas in the
state still are flourishing. Sales in the San Bernardino mountain
resorts of Lake Arrowhead and Big Bear, for example, jumped 15% last
year to record levels. DataQuick analyst John Karevoll attributed
that to Southern Californians wanting to take advantage of the
generally robust pace of home appreciation in the region.</TE>
<TE>   But the picture is vastly different in more expensive second-home
markets. Second-home sales in the Sierras were off 36% last year. And
in Coachella Valley, vacation-home sales dropped to 4,136 last year,
down 19% from 5,127 in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   As sales have waned, the inventory of unsold homes in the valley
has surged, boosted also by new construction.</TE>
<TE>   "The [buyer] traffic is there, the interest rates are right, it's
just a matter of people saying, 'Do we want to do this or not?'" said
Ron Hanna, an agent at Fred Sands Desert Realty in Palm Desert. Hanna
and some other agents said the market for moderately priced second
homes is beginning to pick up.</TE>
<TE>   But the lack of high-end buyers has led some real estate agents to
decline offers to represent homes worth $1 million or more. Though
prices of vacation homes in the Coachella Valley haven't fallen, they
haven't kept pace with the double-digit percentage gains in much of
Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Blomgren, who represents 50 sellers with homes priced at $600,000
or more in the desert valley, said the unusually cooler weather this
winter has made it even harder to convince snowbirds from the
Midwest, as well as current residents in the area, to buy expensive
homes.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't get as revved up about it when they're drinking hot
chocolate or coffee to keep warm instead of playing golf in shorts,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   These days, even the allure of living in a resort where Hollywood
stars could be neighbors isn't enough.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Langan has been trying to sell his 6,000-square-foot home,
with four master suites and marble baths, a waterfall pool and a home
theater room. This month, he lowered the price on the Rancho Mirage
home again, to $1.79 million, from the original listing of
$2.5million. But the former executive producer and head writer of the
soap opera "Days of Our Lives" said he feels stiff competition for
buyers' attention.</TE>
<TE>   "People look at the home and say it's beautiful," he said. "But no
one's bought it."</TE>

<HD>Tapping Into a Wireless World</HD>
<DH>Experts say the increasingly popular computer networks are
vulnerable to being hacked, raising security concerns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Computer security expert Jonas Luster unearthed more than his e-mail
when he signed on to a wireless network for travelers at San Jose
International Airport.</LD>
<LD>   Within minutes of connecting his laptop using a wireless modem,
the Campbell, Calif.-based consultant gained access to a second
network belonging to American Airlines' curbside baggage check-in
system. It asked if Luster wanted to send data.</LD>
<LD>   "I could probably check in bags that didn't exist and maybe do
other things," said Luster, who was asked by Computerworld magazine
to test wireless security at airports for a recent article. "If they
are not security conscious at that point, one can only wonder, 'When
do they start?'"</LD>
<TE>   Lured by cost savings and the ease of connecting computers without
stringing wires, consumers and businesses are setting up wireless
networks in droves. The number of wireless network shipments for PCs
and other devices has grown to 9 million annually in 2001 and is
expected to increase to about 56 million by 2006, according to the
research group Allied Business Intelligence Inc.</TE>
<TE>   But the technology has raised questions about security and privacy
at a time when the nation is trying to bolster its domestic defense
and protect sensitive data from hackers and other unauthorized users.</TE>
<TE>   "Wireless technology presents an opportunity to do security right,
but so far [that] hasn't been happening," said Gary McGraw, chief
technology officer of Cigital Inc., a computer security company in
Dulles, Va. "Potentially everything is laid bare" by wireless
networks, and someone could access all of your data, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some users believe the concerns about wireless data leakage are
overblown. An American Airlines spokesman, for example, downplayed
the San Jose incident, saying Luster exaggerated any security lapses.</TE>
<TE>   But experts say wireless networks are riddled with
vulnerabilities, starting with the fact that many units come from the
store with critical security features disabled. Few users bother to
implement data-scrambling encryption. And those who do might still be
invaded by sophisticated users armed with software-hacking tools.</TE>
<TE>   The result is that computer data often are broadcast in the open,
allowing others with compatible transceivers to receive the
information if they are within range.</TE>
<TE>   Companies, government agencies and home users have just begun to
wake up to the potential problems. The Bush administration is
considering an advisory to federal agencies, warning them about using
wireless networks to transmit sensitive information. And the White
House has directed the Commerce Department to develop comprehensive
standards to guide federal offices that use wireless technology, an
administration official said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, SchlumbergerSema, a New York information technology
services firm that helped built a computer network for the 2002
Winter Olympic Games, said it was so concerned about wireless
networks that it eschewed the technology for more secure wired
computer networks.</TE>
<TE>   Most wireless networks have been set up in homes and offices to
enable users to share high-speed Internet connections and freely roam
up to 300 feet from the wireless transmitter.The most popular
wireless systems in homes and offices use a standard known as
802.11b, or WiFi. The systems use the same unlicensed airwaves as
household portable phones, and eavesdroppers can capture the signals
from up to two miles away using special antennas.</TE>
<TE>   There also are a growing number of commercial wireless networks,
mainly at airports and other public facilities, that allow travelers
with laptops and wireless local area network cards to surf the Net
for a fee. Wayport, the operator of the San Jose system, has such
networks in about 450 locations.</TE>
<TE>   Wireless networks have been criticized for easily defeatable
encryption and poor password management. Devices using another
wireless standard, HomeRF, and even Palm hand-helds also are
vulnerable, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Aviel D. Rubin, an AT&amp;T Labs researcher who was among the first to
expose the vulnerability of the WiFi encryption standard, said it
takes only a few minutes of examining the information broadcast from
a WiFi transceiver to crack its encryption protection.</TE>
<TE>   "About 5% of the time, it leaks data about the [encryption] key,"
Rubin said. From that data, he said, "you can mathematically
reconstruct the encryption key."</TE>
<TE>   Though wireless technology sounds complicated, defeating its
data-scrambling security is a simple matter, experts said. There are
a number of free software programs on the Internet that allow
unauthorized users to unscramble the encryption on a wireless network
at the click of a mouse.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, experts said, breaking into wireless networks has become
so easy that some hackers are abandoning their desktop computers to
go "war driving"--a term they've coined to describe riding around in
a car with a laptop and antenna to forage on other people's wireless
computer networks.</TE>
<TE>   "I know people who have stood in Hoboken, N.J., and pointed an
antenna to New York City and gotten access to all kinds of [wireless]
networks," Rubin said.</TE>
<TE>   The University of New Mexico was the victim of such an intrusion
when a hacker commandeered several wireless printers hooked to its
computer network. They used the printers to launch an electronic
attack that temporarily disabled a Web site outside the school.</TE>
<TE>   David Grisham, who was the university's computer security
administrator at the time of the attack in September, was so
surprised by the exploit that he e-mailed other security experts to
see if they had experienced similar breaches.</TE>
<TE>   "In a large university environment, there are thousands of devices
connected to the network," Grisham said. "All a hacker has to do is
create a [program] that takes over a device that is not properly
password-protected."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the university's experience, surprisingly few wireless
networks use password protection.</TE>
<TE>   Cruising the streets in the St. Paul, Minn., area with a laptop
hooked to a homemade antenna housed in a Pringles potato chip can,
Minnesota computer security expert Bradley S. Rubin discovered
recently that about 80% of wireless networks in the area were not
password-protected.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people are so happy when they get a wireless network up and
running that they leave all the security on the default [unprotected]
settings," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of automatic encryption protection partly stems from the
recommendation of the industry trade group, the Wireless Ethernet
Compatibility Alliance in Mountain View, Calif., to leave encryption
disabled to ease the setup of wireless systems.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted users to have the best out-of-the-box experience ...
but we are rethinking that" in the wake of concern over wireless
security, said Dennis Eaton, chairman of the alliance. Eaton also
said engineers were working on more secure standards for protecting
wireless networks.</TE>
<TE>   Cisco Systems Inc., the largest maker of WiFi equipment, said it
is marketing gear that has better security features. The company
added that it believes so strongly in the technology, it is
installing it in its offices worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel our [wireless] offerings are extremely secure and are
absolutely ready for prime time," said Larry Birenbaum, a Cisco vice
president.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, new competing technologies also might improve the
security of wireless computer networks.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Communications Commission this month, for example, is
expected to approve a breakthrough wireless technology backed by
Intel Corp., Sony Corp. and other big names that could supplant WiFi.</TE>
<TE>   Called ultra-wideband, the wireless technology is three to 10
times faster than WiFi and offers much better security, proponents
say. That's because ultra-wideband networks not only have strong
encryption, but also can be set up to only communicate with users at
a specific location.</TE>
<TE>   "The [wireless] security we have ... is not perfect, [but] more
competition in the market will lead to better security," said Yale
Braunstein, professor of information management at UC Berkeley.</TE>

<HD>Firms Clean Up on Road Work</HD>
<DH>Transit: Volunteer spirit of Adopt-a-Highway has been taken
over by contractors who do a thriving business.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Few people can honestly say they feel good about picking up dirty
diapers, soiled condoms and used jugs of motor oil from the side of a
road.</LD>
<LD>   But then again, few are as devoted to the environment as Yedvart
Tchakerian. The retired businessman spends hours each week cleaning a
busy stretch of Topanga Canyon Boulevard under the state's
Adopt-a-Highway program.</LD>
<LD>   "When I go out there, I feel like I'm doing a good deed," said
Tchakerian, who patrols his adopted roadway in the Santa Monica
Mountains with a litter pickup stick and plastic bag.</LD>
<TE>   The thousands of Adopt-a-Highway signs posted along California's
immense freeway system may give the impression of civic-minded
individuals like Tchakerian and platoons of private-sector volunteers
keeping the roadways litter free.</TE>
<TE>   But such hands-on volunteerism is increasingly rare in the
California Adopt-a-Highway program. Particularly in urban Southern
California, many busy freeways have become too dangerous and require
too much work for nonprofessionals to maintain.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles and Orange counties, for example, most freeway
stretches have been adopted by big corporations and service groups.
They, in turn, hire professional contractors to perform the
backbreaking labor.</TE>
<TE>   Their motivation could be philanthropic, but self-promotion is
also a factor, given they can advertise their good deeds on freeway
signs seen by millions of drivers.</TE>
<TE>   California was the first state, in 1990, to permit professionals
to perform the work for sponsors. The change gave birth to a small
but profitable group of contractors who specialize in freeway cleanup
work. The largest of these firms manage multimillion-dollar budgets,
scores of employees and branch offices throughout the nation.</TE>
<TE>   That represents a dramatic change since the program began in 1989,
when most of the volunteers were from college fraternities, civic
clubs and religious groups that did the dirty work themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The California Department of Transportation officials have no
preference regarding who cleans state roads. The program is a
success, they say, because it saves the state about $5 million per
year in maintenance costs.</TE>
<TE>   "They are all doing something for the community," said Al Sanchez,
the Caltrans Adopt-a-Highway coordinator for Los Angeles and Ventura
counties.</TE>
<TE>   The Adopt-a-Highway program remains one of the state's most
popular volunteer programs. In 2001, volunteers and their contractors
picked up about 30,000 cubic yards of roadway trash--enough to fill
2,000 dump trucks. That was 17% more trash than was collected the
previous year.</TE>
<TE>   Businesses, service groups and individuals have adopted more than
8,000 miles of freeway, pledging for two-year periods to clean
segments of two miles each. Caltrans offers the segments on a
first-come, first-served basis. Under the program, volunteers can
also remove graffiti or plant trees and wildflowers along state
routes.</TE>
<TE>   But who does the hard labor varies with the landscape.</TE>
<TE>   In rural areas such as Ventura, Marin and Napa counties, most of
the freeway segments are cleaned by untrained volunteers--sometimes
retirees, church groups or families--according to Caltrans officials.</TE>
<TE>   But in Los Angeles County, nearly 80% of the roadway segments are
cleaned by contractors on behalf of individuals or companies. In
Orange County, professionals maintain 60% of the freeway stretches.</TE>
<TE>   That is a surprise, even to some participants in the
Adopt-a-Highway program.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Blue Cross of California said he assumed that
employees of the giant health care provider cleaned up a stretch of
Ventura Freeway adopted by the company. Caltrans records show that
it's actually a contractor, paid by Blue Cross, who does the work.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the reason contractors are cleaning more of the state's
roadways is the increasingly hazardous nature of many urban freeways.
Downtown Los Angeles is considered so hazardous, for instance, that
Caltrans allows only professional contractors to sweep, pluck and
bag. Some of those stretches carry up to 250,000 cars per day.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Connolly, a wholesale carpet salesman who removes graffiti on
an adopted segment of the Santa Monica Freeway, said he has had
several close calls with speeding cars.</TE>
<TE>   "You are talking about people going 65 or 70 mph," he said. "The
cars move very fast."</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans also recommends professional contractors for heavily
littered freeways that require a cleanup at least twice a month.</TE>
<TE>   Volunteers are increasingly finding containers of urine, dead
animals, car batteries and even weapons on the side of the road.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans officials say the volume and nature of the hazardous
trash require the commitment of paid professionals.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, more of the freeway cleanups have been assigned to
trained contractors, some charging up to $300 per month to maintain a
two-mile stretch. (That would typically pay for a cleaning crew to
work on the segment every other week.)</TE>
<TE>   Millions in Sales Generated</TE>
<TE>   The state's oldest and largest freeway contractor is
Adopt-a-Highway Maintenance Corp., a Costa Mesa-based firm that
generated nearly $8 million in sales last year, according to industry
analysts.</TE>
<TE>   The firm, launched in 1990 by three graduates of the Wharton
School of the University of Pennsylvania, employs more than 100
workers in 12 states. In California, the firm cleans about 1,000
miles of freeway under the Adopt-a-Highway program.</TE>
<TE>   "The business has been growing steadily because more and more is
thrown to the contractors," said Tony Decker, who co-founded another
contracting firm, California Highway Adoption Co.</TE>
<TE>   Firms Employee Many Workers</TE>
<TE>   Decker and his four sons previously operated a commercial
landscaping company. Now they employ about 30 workers with offices in
Northern and Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Adopt-a-Highway Litter Removal Service of America was started by
Teryl Macia, a public relations executive who started the business
after she adopted a segment of Pacific Coast Highway in Laguna Beach.
The firm, which has about 40 full-time employees and offices in 10
states, made about $2.6 million in sales last year, according to an
industry estimate.</TE>
<TE>   Freeway contractors do more than collect litter. They also file
applications with Caltrans to get the most coveted, high-profile
freeway segments for their clients. The companies design and install
the roadside signs that give the sponsors credit for the work.</TE>
<TE>   Corporations and groups that adopt freeway segments say they are
primarily motivated by altruism and civic pride. But some concede
that marketing considerations play a role, giving them a chance to
display their names and logos before millions of drivers.</TE>
<TE>   The most coveted roadway sections, not surprisingly, are the most
heavily traveled freeways. The waiting list to adopt a stretch of the
San Diego Freeway in West Los Angeles has been as long as four years.</TE>
<TE>   To ensure that the program is not abused for marketing purposes,
Caltrans prohibits phone numbers or business addresses on the signs.
Its employees also inspect each segment to ensure that the roadway is
kept clean.</TE>
<TE>   Newhall Land and Farming Co. has for six years paid a contractor
to maintain two segments of the Golden State Freeway in Santa
Clarita, near the company headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a nice marketing opportunity that shows that we put our
money where our mouth is," said company spokeswoman Marlee Lauffer.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Schiffer, president of the 99 Cents Only Store, said his
company pays a contractors to maintain three stretches of the Glen
Anderson (105) Freeway in Hawthorne because "it's an opportunity to
be a corporate citizen."</TE>
<TE>   He added that the signs posted on those busy freeways also help
boost the company's image. "It doesn't hurt," he said.</TE>

<HD>Big Box Could Cost Agoura Hills Big Bucks</HD>
<DH>Development: The city has quietly prepared an agreement
pledging public funds for a controversial Home Depot project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ZANTO PEABODY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite claims that a proposed retail development in Agoura Hills
would not cost the city any money, it could cost $1.5 million in city
funds before it is built and millions more in road improvements
afterward, according to an unsigned agreement reviewed by the city
attorney.</LD>
<LD>   The draft agreement to build a shopping center anchored by a Home
Depot calls for the city to help pay for site upgrades and relocation
of a county animal shelter and for developer Dan Selleck to widen
Agoura Road. But the city would contribute its funding up front, and
Selleck would determine when--and if--he would complete a second
phase of retail shops and the road improvements.</LD>
<LD>   Details of the development agreement, which has been the subject
of three years' negotiations, have never been disclosed. The City
Council has repeatedly insisted that no public money would be
committed to Selleck's project, and until last week denied the
existence of the development agreement.</LD>
<TE>   Controversy over the Home Depot project, which has prompted a
municipal vote next month on whether big-box stores should be built
in the city of 21,000, mirrors battles being fought in upscale
suburbs across the country. Those clashes have pitted the nation's
largest home improvement store against community groups backed by
smaller businesses that fear being crushed by Home Depot.</TE>
<TE>   According to correspondence between Selleck and Agoura Hills
officials, the development agreement has been prepared, but the City
Council has not signed it. Mayor Dennis Weber said he had seen the
agreement but didn't remember the terms. He said the amount each side
would contribute is still under negotiation.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe our piece is relocating the animal shelter or doing the
medians," said Weber, who sits on the two-person economic development
committee negotiating with Selleck. "I don't think we're in position
to write checks, but maybe just to share in the costs. Any city that
says it is not going to help [by spending] one dime is stupid."</TE>
<TE>   Under the development agreement, the city would contribute $1.5
million, or nearly 20% of its $8-million operating budget, and may
never see the road improvements. The high costs of leveling a section
of Ladyface Mountain and moving the animal shelter make the second
phase too expensive to complete and not likely to happen, said Ed
Ball, a former minority partner in the deal who parted with Selleck
last month over the financing of an unrelated project.</TE>
<TE>   Selleck, who would earn his profits when tenants move in, said he
plans to find a way to complete all the work without the city's
financial help. The city pegged the area for redevelopment in 1991
because the blue-collar equipment and hardware businesses there do
not match the Southwest-themed stucco and glass office spaces that
have sprung up on the local hillsides since incorporation in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   "In a redevelopment deal, it's customary for the city to
participate somehow," said Selleck, who transformed the old General
Motors plant in Panorama City into an $80-million mall--also anchored
by Home Depot--with $4 million in federal subsidies. The Plant, as it
is called, was heralded as a model public-private partnership. "I
don't envision the city [Agoura Hills] participating financially
unless they want additional improvements above and beyond what our
project would require."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Home Depot's estimates support Ball's claim that the project
is not feasible without substantial assistance from the city.</TE>
<TE>   A Home Depot consultant said the project would cost $15 million
more than investors have committed. To offset the cost, the city
would have to contribute $1.5 million a year over 10 years to make
the project work, the consultant said. However, the store would only
generate $408,000 in sales taxes in its first year and $544,000
annually by the fourth year, making the level of needed assistance
from the city "problematic," the consultant said.</TE>
<TE>   City officials said last week that they had not seen the
consultant's figures.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides have drawn clear battle lines for the March 5
election. Citizens for Responsible Growth has spent about $140,000 in
support of Measure H, which would bar construction of any store
larger than 60,000 square feet, city records show. To combat Measure
H, Taxpayers Opposed to Special Treatment has spent $40,000 and
Selleck and Home Depot have contributed a combined $150,000.</TE>
<TE>   Mel Adams Sr., whose Agoura Equipment Rentals is one of the
businesses targeted for relocation, said the shopping center would
undermine local businesses, make traffic congestion worse and
jeopardize their sleepy, upscale environment.</TE>
<TE>   Al Abrams, spokesman for Citizens for Responsible Growth, said the
council has been too quiet about the "single biggest issue in the
city" because voters might block the development if they knew the
facts.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in the Enron generation now," Abrams said. "I wouldn't
trust anything corporate America says anymore, even in a deal with
the city."</TE>
<TE>   One key document, an environmental impact report that projects how
the store would affect traffic, may not be released for another two
months, well after the election, Selleck said.</TE>
<TE>   For the bedroom community 33 miles north of downtown Los Angeles,
a lot is riding on Measure H. While cities on either side of Agoura
Hills have increased their bottom lines with new retail development,
its more conservative policies have left it with more unoccupied
office space than revenue-generating stores. And there is little room
in the city budget, officials say, for much-need improvements to the
freeway interchange at Kanan Road.</TE>
<TE>   If Measure H is defeated, the Home Depot proposal would be
submitted to the city for consideration, Selleck said. All five
council members have said they support redeveloping the 24-acre site
to replace the worn machinery and rubbish visible from the Ventura
Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   "You can count the number of big boxes in this city easily--there
are none," said City Councilman Jeff Reinhardt, who supports the
Selleck project. "You don't see a big-box store, an auto mall or a
shopping mall, despite rampant development in our surrounding
communities. We have no demonstrated recklessness."</TE>

<CX>   Agoura Hills councilman--A story Monday in the California section

supports the proposed construction of a Home Depot store. Reinhardt has
not taken a position on the project. In addition, the first name of
Agoura Hills Mayor Denis Weber was misspelled in the story.</CX>

Type of Material: Correction </CX>
<CX>   Agoura Hills Home Depot--A subheadline on a Feb. 11 story in the
California section incorrectly stated that the city of Agoura Hills had
"quietly prepared an agreement pledging public funds for a controversial
Home Depot project." Elements of the story reinforced that error. In
fact, the city was merely in negotiations with developer Dan Selleck over
the terms of a Home Depot project, including proposals that the city
contribute funding for related improvements. There is no agreement yet.
The story contained out-of-date estimates, attributed to a Home Depot
consultant, that the project would cost $15 million more than investors
have committed, and that the city would have to contribute $1.5 million a
year for 10 years to cover the difference. New estimates show no cost
overruns.</CX>
<CX>   The story also was incorrect in saying that the proposal called on the
city to help pay for site upgrades and the relocation of an animal
shelter. The proposals under discussion would not require the city to pay
for those items. In addition, the story incorrectly stated that the
proposals would have the city contribute its funding up front. The
proposals, if approved, would tap future sales tax revenues from the
project to fund the city's contribution. The story also incorrectly said
that Selleck and Home Depot had spent $150,000 to fight Measure H, an
Agoura Hills ballot initiative that would ban big-box stores. Selleck and
Home Depot had spent $39,000.</CX>
<CX>   A caption for a photo accompanying the story should not have said that
Mel Adams will see his business disappear because of the Home Depot
project. That is not a certainty.</CX>

<DH>Law enforcement: Genetic samples taken from criminals
provide a boon to investigators. But California lags some states,
critics say.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Years had passed without an arrest in the rape and murder of a
teenage hitchhiker in redwood country's Del Norte County. Then, last
summer, a name popped up on a state computer.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Allen Wigley was a "cold hit" in the state's convicted
offender databank. His DNA matched evidence samples from the crime.</LD>
<LD>   "This is just a wonderful thing that happened," said Del Norte
County sheriff's Det. Gene McManus, who had investigated suspects
since the 1994 killing--but never Wigley. "He was a gift from
heaven."</LD>
<TE>   Wigley's identification and homicide arrest were, more precisely,
a gift of California's 8-year-old DNA databank, which is slowly
kicking into gear after a history of underfunding and neglect.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001 there were 48 cold hits matching DNA evidence from
unsolved crimes with the genetic material of convicted felons--the
program's most successful year by far.</TE>
<TE>   But with the biggest prison system in the country, California
still trails well behind national leaders such as Virginia. Thousands
of rape kits sit untested in law enforcement freezers around the
state. Thousands of prison inmates have not had their DNA sampled and
hundreds are refusing to cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just not working the way it could work, it should work,"
said Alameda County Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Rock Harmon, who chairs
the forensics evidence committee for the California District
Attorneys Assn.</TE>
<TE>   California's program is part of an evolving national law
enforcement effort to use DNA from convicted felons to solve crimes
and take advantage of advances in the forensic DNA field. All 50
states have laws authorizing databanks and more than 30 have them in
operation.</TE>
<TE>   The databanks operate on sophisticated technology and a simple
procedure: Store the DNA profiles of offenders. Run DNA evidence from
unsolved crimes through the banks and see if any match.</TE>
<TE>   The promise of the databanks can be seen in Virginia. With a
population smaller than Los Angeles County's, the state has so far
scored more than 600 hits, compared with a total of 74 in California.
In January alone, Virginia made the same number of hits that
California made in all of last year.</TE>
<TE>   California started a major catch-up effort in 1999. Since then it
has spent millions to eliminate a huge backlog of untested offender
samples at the state lab and get them into the databank.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Corrections collected 50,000 DNA specimens from
inmates, and last year the Legislature expanded the number of felony
crimes subject to sampling requirements from nine to 13.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, $50 million is being distributed over three years to
local and county law enforcement agencies to analyze thousands of
untested specimens from unsolved sex crimes, including those
involving homicides.</TE>
<TE>   Cold Hits Rise to About 1 a Week</TE>
<TE>   With 200,000 offender profiles and DNA samples from 2,500 cases in
the databank, the number of cold hits in California jumped last year
to an average of nearly one a week.</TE>
<TE>   That rate can only go up, promises the Department of Justice. "Now
it's going to keep flying. It's going to grow exponentially,"
spokesman Manuel Valencia said.</TE>
<TE>   But Alameda County prosecutor Harmon and others remain frustrated.</TE>
<TE>   "This could really work. But it's just not being done," Harmon
said. "We make too big a deal out of our few successes."</TE>
<TE>   He points to the thousands of inmates who have not given DNA
samples, including many who refuse to give the blood specimens and
mouth swabs required by law.</TE>
<TE>   "I like to say we have the only volunteer database in the world,"
Harmon said sarcastically.</TE>
<TE>   Refusal to give a DNA sample is a misdemeanor, a meaningless
punishment to those locked up for years. And Corrections Department
rules forbid the use of force in taking the samples without a court
order.</TE>
<TE>   Corrections Department spokeswoman Terry Thornton said there are
800 state inmates who won't give samples, along with the roughly 600
people on death row who have been shielded from the DNA requirements
by a lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Harmon said he believes the number of uncooperative inmates is
much higher, and he faults the Corrections Department for its limits
on the use of force. "Strap 'em down," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A proposal to let corrections officers resort to force without a
court order to get DNA samples was recently introduced in the state
Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   The force issue touches on civil liberties questions that hover
over the entire concept of offender DNA databanks.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a certain specter of Nazi Germany," said Scott Ciment,
legislative advocate for California Attorneys for Criminal Justice, a
private criminal defense bar.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates went to court several years ago to stop the sampling of
eight condemned female prisoners, arguing that the testing violated
their constitutional rights. A court order was issued barring the
sampling, though for procedural rather than constitutional reasons.
The state is appealing the injunction, which has effectively
prevented sampling of all death row inmates.</TE>
<TE>   Ciment's organization opposed the recent addition of four
offenses--residential burglary, residential robbery, arson and
carjacking--to the nine sex and violent crimes requiring DNA samples.</TE>
<TE>   Ciment also says it would be unwise to make it easier for prison
guards to use force.</TE>
<TE>   DNA profiling can be used to prove innocence as well as guilt, and
defense and civil liberties groups concede that the databanks are
helpful to law enforcement. But they worry that the compilation of
genetic material from entire classes of people pushes society in a
dangerous direction.</TE>
<TE>   "It's appropriate that law enforcement have it as a tool," said
Elizabeth Schroeder, associate director of the American Civil
Liberties Union of Southern California. "But it has to be limited so
that we don't wind up as a national DNA databank--and all of us wind
up as a suspect."</TE>
<TE>   Although the DNA samples are collected solely for identification
purposes, they contain all manner of genetic information about not
only the inmates but also their blood relatives.</TE>
<TE>   "It will give extraordinarily private information on health and
other things," Schroeder said. "While we don't see any evidence of
government agencies overreaching in that way, we have some shocking
examples in the past of government collecting information for
seemingly benign purposes and then expanding its use."</TE>
<TE>   ACLU Wants Samples Destroyed</TE>
<TE>   The ACLU, like California Attorneys for Criminal Justice, argues
that once the inmate samples have been profiled, they should be
destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   Databank officials say they don't have the desire, time or
equipment to extract the kind of genetic information that could be
misused.</TE>
<TE>   "There isn't a realistic concern," countered Ken Konzak, lab
director for the state DNA databank. "I don't know why all of a
sudden they assume there's a terrific interest in some '1984'
scenario in California," he added, in a reference to the George
Orwell novel.</TE>
<TE>   Konzak also said it makes no sense to destroy the DNA samples once
the identifying points have been mapped. The state needs to keep them
to verify results later if necessary, and rapid advances in the DNA
field will inevitably produce new techniques with which to analyze
the specimens.</TE>
<TE>   Though some worry that too many crimes now carry sampling
requirements in California, Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty.
Lisa Kahn says not enough do.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no better tool to fight crime, to bring closure to
victims, exonerate the innocent and take violent offenders off the
street," said Kahn, who is in charge of forensic sciences in the
district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   One reason Virginia's offender databank has so many cold hits, she
says, is that the state requires all felons to provide DNA samples.</TE>
<TE>   "We find the vast majority of violent crimes were solved because
we had people in the databank because of property crimes," said Paul
Ferrara, director of Virginia's Division of Forensic Science.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials there routinely collect biological
evidence from burglaries and nonviolent crimes. Most agencies in
California say they are stretched too thin to do that sort of
sampling.</TE>
<TE>   Up in California's Del Norte County, sheriff's Det. McManus is
doing as much as he can. "It's revolutionizing my job," he said.</TE>
<TE>   McManus was working as a deputy in 1994 when an 18-year-old
hitchhiker from Washington was raped, strangled and left dead in a
state park. He found her body, and when he became a detective soon
after he started investigating the case.</TE>
<TE>   He checked out several suspects, obtaining blood samples from them
to check against the rape kit evidence. They didn't match.</TE>
<TE>   At some point, McManus is not sure when, the state entered the
crime specimen into the DNA databank. No hits resulted. Then in
August, after Wigley's DNA sample had been submitted to the bank,
there was a match.</TE>
<TE>   Wigley, 35, had lived in Crescent City and been in and out of
prison. At the time of the match, McManus said Wigley was living in
Oregon and was wanted in California for a probation violation,
failing to register as a sex offender.</TE>
<TE>   After the cold hit, Oregon state police tracked Wigley down and he
was extradited to Del Norte County, where he is in jail. He is
charged with first-degree murder with two special circumstances that
could carry the death penalty: rape prior to a homicide and torture.</TE>

<HD>County Hospital Director Leaving His Post</HD>
<DH>Services: Sam Edwards, who oversaw expansion of health
clinics, says it's time to 'slow down.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. Sam Edwards, who oversaw a controversial expansion of Ventura
County's public health clinics and helped modernize its public
hospital, is stepping down as the hospital's administrator next
month.</LD>
<LD>   Edwards, 64, recently told Health Care Agency Director Pierre
Durand that he wanted to slow down and hand the over the reins of the
Ventura County Medical Center to someone else.</LD>
<LD>   Edwards has been on the job for seven years, leaving a private
practice in Santa Paula in 1995 to supervise the Ventura hospital's
1,000 employees and $142-million budget.</LD>
<TE>   The hospital serves as the safety net for the county's poor and
uninsured residents and has been held up as a model for how
government can efficiently offer quality health care.</TE>
<TE>   "It's bittersweet," Edwards said. "I believe in the mission of
this hospital, and I've made a lot of good friends.... But I'm older
and need a little more time to do the things that I want to do."</TE>
<TE>   Edwards, a grandfatherly figure known as "Dr. Sam" to staff
members and superiors, will stay on to handle special projects for an
undetermined interim period.</TE>
<TE>   "Dr. Sam reflects what is best in medicine. He has been and still
is a mentor to me," Durand said.</TE>
<TE>   "He just wants to decrease his hours. So, in a way, I will not be
losing my partner yet."</TE>
<TE>   Beginning March 3, though, the hospital will be run by Michael B.
Powers, a county attorney who has worked closely with Durand for
three years.</TE>
<TE>   Powers, 39, most recently has acted as the Health Care Agency's
compliance officer, making sure the hospital's billings to the
Medi-Cal and Medicare government insurance programs do not run afoul
of regulations.</TE>
<TE>   Powers previously worked in the county counsel's office and,
before that, was an associate with the Oxnard law firm of Nordman,
Cormany, Hair and Compton.</TE>
<TE>   Powers will earn about $137,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Durand praised Powers' intellect and said the attorney has learned
much about the 223-bed hospital during his tenure as the billing
compliance officer.</TE>
<TE>   Powers also specialized in medical issues while working in the
county counsel's office, Durand said.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike has impressed me as someone who is not only bright but has a
very high work ethic," Durand said. "He is passionate about helping
the people who need access to our system."</TE>
<TE>   Edwards' ties to Ventura County Medical Center go back three
decades. He had privileges at the hospital in the 1970s, was part of
the teaching staff and served as its medical director in the '80s.</TE>
<TE>   During his tenure, Edwards carried out Durand's goal of setting up
public health clinics in low-income neighborhoods. That improved
medical care for those without private insurance and cut by half the
number of costly emergency room visits, Edwards said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lot more expensive to take care of someone in an ER than
in an outpatient clinic visit," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the clinics handled 325,000 outpatient visits, the
doctor said.</TE>
<TE>   But some of the county's private hospitals eyed the expansion with
suspicion, viewing it as an encroachment on their private-pay
patients.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards was also at the helm as the county for years battled
neighboring Community Memorial Hospital. Fearing competition,
Community Memorial bankrolled a $1.6-million ballot initiative in
1996 that killed the county's plan to add a hospital wing and to
upgrade aging facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Tension between the two hospitals continued until a truce was
called last year.</TE>
<TE>   By written agreement, the county will not expand private-sector
enrollments in its low-cost health care plan. In return, Community
Memorial pledged not to stand in the way of upgrades to the kitchen
and laboratory facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Those improvements are underway.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards will be greatly missed around the hospital, predicted
veteran Ventura County Supervisor John Flynn.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows how to run a medical system," Flynn said. "It has to be
run with love and discipline, and that's what he has."</TE>

<LD>It wasn't the nastiest response I've ever gotten from a reader. Not
by a longshot. But a South-Central Los Angeles man did not take
kindly to my questioning of Police Chief Bernie Parks' leadership
skills last week after Mayor Jim Hahn said he wants a new top cop. I
also said we shouldn't pick, or keep, a police chief on the basis of
his color.</LD>
<LD>   "I bet you've never been pulled over and told to lay on the ground
at gunpoint," Derrick Evans wrote.</LD>
<LD>   Evans said I have no idea what it means to be black in L.A., and
offered to show me around. But he suspected I was some yuppie who
never leaves my "gated community" to visit the real world, and he was
certain I'd kill his e-mail message as soon as I got it.</LD>
<TE>   Instead I dialed his number.</TE>
<TE>   "Derrick? Steve Lopez."</TE>
<TE>   Long pause.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, man," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm taking you up on your offer."</TE>
<TE>   Evans, married with two daughters, is a senior account executive
for a company that does background checks and locates deadbeats. As
he drove us through his neighborhood, he told me he's been stopped by
police dozens of times in his 41 years in Compton, Lynwood and Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Five times, he said, he's been ordered out of his car at gunpoint.
But he claimed that except for a two-hour lockup 20 years ago on a
traffic warrant, he's always been clean.</TE>
<TE>   I obviously wasn't there for all this, but it rings true.</TE>
<TE>   "It's DWBs," he said, meaning that he was pulled over for Driving
While Black. "When I was younger, we always avoided driving three and
four deep. If you were rolling with friends, you knew you would get
pulled over."</TE>
<TE>   Evans turned off Slauson and onto a nice street, where he pointed
to a big, peach-colored house.</TE>
<TE>   "That's where Chief Parks lives," he said. "I can't go knock on
his door in the middle of the night if I need something, but he's not
in some gated community. He's right here in the 'hood, and you see
him at the 7-Eleven and he says hello."</TE>
<TE>   Evans drove me past his own house, a sweet little beige job with
orange trim. He cruised sun-washed streets with lollipop palms, tidy
yards and fussed-over Spanish and Craftsman houses. Along the way, he
described the neighborhood with great pride and pointed out some of
his haunts. Woody's Bar-B-Que, Chambers Shine Parlor, the Slauson and
Crenshaw intersection known as The Strip.</TE>
<TE>   On Mullen near Slauson, he stopped the car. Right here, about
seven years ago, he was pulled over with his wife, daughter and niece
while driving to his mother-in-law's.</TE>
<TE>   "Two cars were behind me, starting back before Crenshaw. They hit
the lights, and I turned right here. They got on the loudspeaker.
"'Get out of the car!'"</TE>
<TE>   Evans says he knew the drill. Do as you're told, and don't get
smart or you'll get your head bashed in, if not worse. Four white
cops were crouched behind their car doors, guns trained on him.</TE>
<TE>   "'Drop to your knees! Put your hands behind your head!' They laid
me out right here in the street and handcuffed me with a knee in my
back. It was 85 degrees and this asphalt was hot. They got my wife
and the kids out of the car, went all up through the car, looked in
the trunk. Now my wife is boo-hooin' and of course the kids are
boo-hooin'.</TE>
<TE>   "I was hot now, and I ran my mouth a little bit. I said, 'I'm a
law-abiding citizen, why don't you go bother some real criminals?'
They didn't find anything, and when they let me go they just said I
looked like someone they were looking for. That's what they always
say. My daughter remembers everything from that day. It's seven years
later and she's still afraid of the police."</TE>
<TE>   Evans said there was no change on the streets under Chief Willie
Williams, the African American who preceded Parks, because cops
neither feared nor respected Williams. But since Parks took over, he
says he gets pulled over less often, and cops are more civil.</TE>
<TE>   But couldn't a chief who's not black accomplish the same thing? I
asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," Evans said. "If he was blue with green stripes, I wouldn't
care." But he thinks Parks is the best thing that's happened to the
LAPD in his lifetime. The fact that he's black is a bonus to a man of
color who fears the police are out to get him. "A white cop won't
take me to the limit with roughhouse now, because he's going to be
held accountable."</TE>
<TE>   Here's where we see it differently.</TE>
<TE>   Parks was no friend of the man on the street when he dismissed the
Rampart scandal as a tempest blown up by the press, or when he
resisted collecting data on racial profiling, of all things. He
sounded like those who came before him when he said the gunning down
of a feeble black woman living on the streets was not a bad shooting.
He's instituted some reforms but resisted others, running the
department like a military general who refuses to answer to the
commander in chief. And worst of all, he's barricaded the doors
against any review by citizens or outside investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Hahn should be able to second-guess Parks without being called
a traitor to the black community.</TE>
<TE>   "Hahn hasn't explained what's wrong, or how he's going to find
anyone better," argued Evans, who thinks Hahn has personal rather
than professional differences with Parks. He kicks himself because he
voted for Hahn on the record of his father, L.A. County Supervisor
Kenneth Hahn. "His father put his ear to the ground and heard the cry
of the city, and I thought his son would continue the dream."</TE>
<TE>   The dream, it seems to me, is to move beyond race. But if Parks
gets dumped, Evans predicts a long, hot summer after April's 10-year
anniversary of the riots that followed the Rodney King beating
verdict. "There's lots of knuckleheads in the neighborhood, and the
trouble-makers could go crazy. LAPD has got to watch their backs."</TE>
<TE>   Evans hopes it doesn't come to that, and I second the motion. From
across the divide, an understanding.</TE>

<HD>Murals Must Survive on Trust, Panel Says</HD>
<DH>Art: San Clemente park commissioners vote against
installing protection for nine hand-painted works.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Public art should not have to be protected from the public, says a
San Clemente parks panel. Thus, a plan to install nine hand-painted
murals of beach, ocean and city scenes along Avenida del Mar should
not include city funds to shield the art from vandalism or damage,
the panel is recommending.</LD>
<LD>   The Parks and Recreation Commission had approved the San Clemente
Historical Society's proposal for the murals, each 18 by 3 feet and
composed of individual tiles painted by city residents. However, the
panel recommended that "protective measures not be installed ... to
determine if the public affords the murals the respect they deserve."</LD>
<LD>   The idea behind the unusual move is to trust the public, rather
than spend money to thwart vandalism that might never happen.</LD>
<TE>   "You don't automatically assume the public is going to destroy
public art just because you put it up," said Bruce Wegner, director
of the city's Beaches, Parks and Recreation Department. The
commission, he said, "would prefer to give the public the chance to
prove them right, rather than assume that the public will destroy
public art."</TE>
<TE>   At its meeting last week, the City Council voted to send the
proposal to the Planning Commission for further review.</TE>
<TE>   The Historical Society is sponsoring the fund-raising project,
relying on donations and volunteers to keep costs low.</TE>
<TE>   Blythe Welton, co-president of the society, said the murals would
depict palm trees, dolphins and other "scenes indicative of a coastal
town." The Historical Society is still choosing the artists. Because
the murals would be placed along the city's main street and on a
long, low wall between the community center and library, concerns
have been raised that the art would be vulnerable to damage from
people sitting on the wall or on top of benches and banging their
heels on them.</TE>
<TE>   Guarding against that type damage would most likely require bricks
or stones along the top of the wall to discourage sitting, said
Wegner.</TE>
<TE>   Murals installed earlier at the pier, also on low walls that flank
the entrance to the beach beneath the railroad tracks, have not been
vandalized or damaged, Wegner said.</TE>
<TE>   For the pier murals, the society charged the public $60 each to
paint an 8-inch-square tile. The tiles became part of two large
murals that depicted "San Clemente Morn" and "San Clemente Sunset."
Each tile was sketched in by an artist, and the public was instructed
on how to fill in the lines and what colors to use.</TE>
<TE>   The 88 tiles for each of the murals were sold in one day, raising
more than $10,000, Welton said. "There were so many people who were
not able to get in the first phase," said Welton. "This is another
opportunity for people to paint tiles together with their friends and
family and then see the lasting results."</TE>
<TE>   "San Clemente Morn," by Mary McMenamin, in Parque del Mar at the
foot of the pier, is a scene from the bluffs above the pier, looking
out at red-tile roofs, bougainvillea and sailboats on a calm, blue
sea. Rick Delanty's "San Clemente Sunset" is a warm scene at beach
level looking toward Dana Point.</TE>
<TE>   The results have been praised by the Historical Society,
participants and the artists.</TE>
<TE>   "I was amazed at how serious people were," McMenamin said. "I also
teach art classes, so I take this seriously. I told them that if this
if going to be done and in a public place for the world to see for
years to come, it's got to be done right."</TE>

<HD>Competing Visions of Ormond</HD>
<DH>Oxnard: Beach community seeks balance between nature and
commerce.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After decades of study, Shirley Godwin has sharpened her vision for
Ormond Beach, a coveted stretch of white sand and shoreline on
Oxnard's south side.</LD>
<LD>   The community leader sees it as an uncut ecological jewel, a place
that--with polish--could blossom into a wildlife preserve complete
with nature trails, a visitors center and a living laboratory for
marine research.</LD>
<LD>   She sees room for creation of a small village shopping center,
anchored by a brew pub or a seafood restaurant to serve as an
economic engine for preservation efforts.</LD>
<TE>   Most of all, with a community meeting scheduled later this month
to review prospects for the property, Godwin sees a prime opportunity
to shape a strategy that can benefit nearby neighborhoods while
protecting Ventura County's largest remaining tract of undeveloped
coastline.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to see this pre-planned and developed in such a way as to
preserve the wetlands, enhance the area and make it a very special
place," said Godwin, who has lived about a mile from Ormond Beach for
nearly 40 years and belongs to groups studying its future.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is conscious of the fact that whatever decisions are
made, whatever happens to that land, we're going to have to live with
the rest of our lives," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Long an area of contrasts, the 1,404-acre beachfront property is
once again in the cross hairs of competing interests.</TE>
<TE>   Wedged between the Pacific Ocean and the fertile Oxnard Plain, it
is home to some of the county's most fragile wetlands and some of its
heaviest industry.</TE>
<TE>   The area is host to a paper mill, a metal recycler, a sewage
treatment facility and a power plant. Yet its shallow freshwater
lagoon and saltwater marshes provide habitat for a variety of birds,
including threatened and endangered species.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to save Ormond Beach from the urban sprawl that has
consumed much of the Southern California coastline, environmentalists
and others have scrambled over the years to shield as much of the
property as possible from development.</TE>
<TE>   Even now, the California Coastal Conservancy is trying to buy
hundreds of acres of wetlands and open space--including 309 acres
jointly owned by the city and the Metropolitan Water District--as
part of a statewide effort to preserve coastal habitat.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, city planners are sorting through a flurry of
development interests for Ormond Beach, including a pitch by
Houston-based Sysco Corp., North America's largest food-service
marketer and distributor, to establish a regional headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   City planners say it is important to provide opportunities for
economic development at Ormond Beach, because voter-approved
growth-control restrictions have made the area one of the few prime
development sites left in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   Residents in surrounding neighborhoods, meanwhile, have drawn up a
map detailing a more environmentally friendly approach.</TE>
<TE>   Potential uses for the property are in the early stages of
development. But city leaders have made it clear that before they
start considering the merit of individual projects, they want to see
a master plan for the entire area.</TE>
<TE>   "We know for sure that we don't want any more piecemeal
development," Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez said. "I think part of the
problem is that there are so many competing interests--some don't
want any development, others want it wall-to-wall. Somewhere in
between, we are hoping to have a meeting of the minds."</TE>
<TE>   This wide stretch of wind-swept beachfront has inspired its share
of failed, if not far-fetched, development ideas over the last 20
years.</TE>
<TE>   A Los Angeles company in the mid-1980s pitched a theme park
dedicated to the Space Age, complete with a 150-room hotel designed
to look like a space station. Other proposals include a regional
airport, a horse-racing track and a multimillion-dollar marina-based
residential community.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those projects were rejected by planning officials. But
while the process has been tedious and often frustrating, planners
say it also has provided valuable lessons as they move toward
sketching a master plan.</TE>
<TE>   "We have gotten the benefit of literally years worth of public
expression on the community's goals and objectives for Ormond Beach,"
said Steve Kinney, president of the Greater Oxnard Economic
Development Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there have been opportunities for opinions to be aired
aplenty, so that the city can now legitimately put a plan forth that
really responds to the community and that the council can use as a
guidepost for projects to go forward."</TE>
<TE>   Kinney and development Director Matthew Winegar will unveil a
conceptual plan for the area at a 6:30 p.m. meeting Feb. 20 at the
South Oxnard Center.</TE>
<TE>   The plan looks at efforts by Sysco to buy a 50-acre chunk of the
309 acres jointly owned by the city and the MWD, Kinney said. It also
highlights interest in 22 acres by neighboring Willamette Industries
and Pacific Vehicle Processors, which prepares vehicles for transfer
to dealerships.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Vehicle, which is looking to expand existing operations in
the area, also has expressed interest in buying 38 additional acres
of adjacent privately owned property.</TE>
<TE>   Kinney said the conceptual plan will touch on interest from
property owners north of Ormond Beach to build housing on 250 acres
outside the city limits. And it will examine an offer from the
Coastal Conservancy to buy as much of the city-owned land as possible
as well as additional acreage in the surrounding area.</TE>
<TE>   But planning officials say that, though they may be exploring
economic development opportunities at Ormond Beach, they want to
dispel any notion that they don't care about protecting the wetlands
or other sensitive habitat.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, they say their plan designates more than 100 acres of
the city-owned property for wetlands and beach habitat. They also say
that as much as a quarter of the overall site could eventually be set
aside for such open-space uses.</TE>
<TE>   It's a big beach, Kinney said, and there is enough room to satisfy
all the competing interests.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to provide a realistic assessment of the possibilities
available in the future for that land," he said. "Call me crazy, but
I actually do believe we are dealing with a plan that has a high and
achievable degree of success."</TE>
<TE>   It may not be an easy sell, however.</TE>
<TE>   Many environmentalists and neighboring residents, long at odds
with the city over what to do about Ormond Beach, remain wary.</TE>
<TE>   They point to a closed-door discussion held last week by the
Oxnard City Council on Sysco's purchase offer. That review came less
than a month after council members called for a comprehensive plan
for the property.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm wondering if the staff heard what I heard from the City
Council," said community leader Sylvia Preston, chairwoman of the
Cypress Neighborhood Council and a key member of the Oxnard South
Revitalization Committee.</TE>
<TE>   She was among a handful of residents who showed up last week to
urge the council to delay a decision on selling property until a
master plan is in place. And she will be among those at the upcoming
meeting pushing for more ecologically sound development alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   Preston favors finding ways to restore the wetlands and envisions
creation of a gateway to Ormond Beach that would provide parkland,
educational facilities and beach access to residents as a key part to
preserving the ecological site.</TE>
<TE>   Preston and others are particularly opposed to efforts by Pacific
Vehicle to purchase privately owned land south of Saviers and Hueneme
roads, saying the company's expansion plans will block beach access.</TE>
<TE>   "If it becomes more and more accessible to residents, then I think
their level of commitment to preserving it will increase," said
Preston, who believes that enhancing the beach area also will help
revive south Oxnard neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "There should be an overall plan, and beyond that an overall
commitment, to do the wisest and best planning possible at Ormond
Beach," she said. "If you just slap in development, if you cover this
patch and that patch with asphalt, you're not going to get a second
chance."</TE>
<TE>   It is a delicate balancing act, this effort to protect Ormond
Beach while promoting economic development.</TE>
<TE>   A 1999 report by the Washington, D.C.-based Urban Land Institute
helped provide some common ground. After months of study, experts
recommended that the wetlands and beach be cleaned up and enhanced to
become the centerpiece for a coordinated mixture of homes, businesses
and natural areas.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Brand, the Coastal Conservancy's point man in Ventura
County, said the agency remains in closed-door talks for acquisition
of all or a portion of the city-owned property and is trying to
restart negotiations for hundreds of acres of Southern California
Edison property at Ormond Beach.</TE>
<TE>   A deal in the works to buy the Edison land fell through last year
after the utility decided to hold on to the property in the wake of
the state's energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "The Coastal Conservancy has always acknowledged that we can do
wetlands restoration and still leave room for development that will
meet the community's needs," Brand said.</TE>
<TE>   While Ormond's future remains unclear, it is certain that any
development proposal is sure to face a slew of local interest groups,
all with a stake in the beachfront property.</TE>
<TE>   "The moment of truth for Ormond Beach is approaching," said Oxnard
resident Jean Harris, who, as co-founder of the Ormond Beach
Observers, has worked for two decades to preserve the coveted
coastline.</TE>
<TE>   "I have dreamed of the day when Ormond Beach receives its rightful
status as a precious nature preserve," she said. "Perhaps that day is
dawning."</TE>

<HD>More Psychic Than Miss Cleo--at Least on Enron</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A year ago, it looked like the end of the 10-count: California was on
the ropes, electricity-wise, and Texas outfits like Enron were biting
the state's ear--$1.4 billion just for February 2001--and getting
rich, rich, rich. And state Sen. Steve Peace, the El Cajon Democrat,
the architect of deregulation, was getting the kilowatts beaten out
of him. People phoned his office to gripe. They shouted at him in
airports. He gave up the idea of running for secretary of state; in
his own town they said he couldn't get elected dog catcher.</LD>
<LD>   Against this backdrop, one day a year ago, Peace flagged down
Enron lobbyist and former Assembly member Bev Hansen.</LD>
<LD>   "First he said, in less than five years there won't be an Enron,"
said Hansen. "I said, 'Oh, Steve.' Then he said, 'In less than three
years, they'll be in bankruptcy.'"</LD>
<TE>   They made a bet: Loser buys dinner.</TE>
<TE>   "I never dreamed when I cast that bet that he would be so right,
so soon," said Hansen. "It was absolutely flabbergasting. It took far
less than three years."</TE>
<TE>   Now she regards Peace with awe, as the political incarnation of
the chess geniuses who can see eight or 10 moves ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Alas for Peace's appetite, state law means he may never get his
free dinner. But Hansen, a "longtime friend" who "respects him a
great deal," says, "We'll work something out." (Maybe fast food?
Hansen's Enron lobbying days ended when the company filed for
bankruptcy in December.)</TE>
<TE>   And now, the big musical finish for Peace's psychic act: On the
day last month that Kenneth Lay resigned as Enron's CEO, Peace called
a Times energy reporter and sang into the phone, "Ding dong, the
witch is dead, the wicked witch is dead!"</TE>
<TE>   Recall the winged monkeys.</TE>
<TE>   Simon Boasts, Then Backs Off</TE>
<TE>   As the polls have lifted Bill Simon Jr.'s prospects for governor,
a little hot air has been wafting around, too.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent meeting with its editorial board, the Sacramento Bee
says, Simon bragged that he and his wife were "very active" in their
son's Santa Monica charter school. Ah, but when pressed, Simon
conceded that it was really his wife who was the active one, heading
up the school's beautification committee.</TE>
<TE>   Then he couldn't say what distinguished the school other than the
fact that it has a charter. "My wife was really much more heavily
involved," he limped along.</TE>
<TE>   Simon also put a little extra burnish on his prosecutorial career,
telling the Bee that he left a Wall Street law firm for the U.S.
attorney's office, to go "into the business of going after people on
Wall Street," he said, "as opposed to making money on Wall Street."
Pressed for particulars, Simon acknowledged that most of his time was
spent on civil matters, and he had nothing to do with going after
financial felons. "I did not do anything in the securities fraud
area," he said.</TE>

<TE>   And Speaking of Poetry ...</TE>
<TE>   Probably not in the running for poet laureate is part-time poet
Luke Breit, one of Sacramento magazine's 30 "smart, sexy, eligible

<TE>   Breit told the mag he runs to the mailbox each month for the

would relive the "great poetry reading" in San Francisco, the
post-verse party and "the most amazing night of lovemaking" that

<CP>PHOTO: They call it a retreat, but it's about advancing the cause, and at
the House Republicans' retreat not long ago, the Capitol newspaper Roll
Call reports, Majority Whip Tom DeLay did a comical PowerPoint
presentation, morphing the heads of his colleagues onto the bodies of
celebrities. Reps. John Doolittle of Roseville and Richard Pombo of
Stockton became the two motorcycle cops from "CHiPs." Then, DeLay flashed
onto the screen Democratic Rep. Loretta Sanchez's official Christmas card,
showing Sanchez and her husband, Stephen Brixey III, in a pose with their
white cat, Gretzky. "I think the card would have gone better," DeLay
intoned, "if they had a better-looking cat"--and there was his face
superimposed on Gretzky's. The card--with Gretzky, not DeLay--was
also mailed to Democrats in the 38th District, which is where
Sanchez's sister happens to be running for Congress.</CP>

<HD>Police Chief Debate Is No Longer Black-White Issue</HD>
<DH>LAPD: The role of race is less polarized but more
complicated in Parks' quest for a second term.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA RICHARDSON and K. CONNIE KANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once upon a time, life in Los Angeles was simple: There was the white
police chief, Daryl Gates, on one side, the black mayor, Tom Bradley,
on the other. Opinions about the two often crossed racial
lines--Bradley in particular had substantial white support--but the
debate over the Police Department was largely framed in terms of
black and white.</LD>
<LD>   A decade later, as another chief and mayor go head to head, race
still matters--but with less of its old-fashioned power to polarize
the city.</LD>
<LD>   Among blacks in Los Angeles, anger over Mayor James K. Hahn's
decision not to support Chief Bernard C. Parks for a second term is
widespread. Among other ethnic and racial groups, Hahn's decision has
opened a more divided debate--if it comes up at all. Race still
matters--but in a more nuanced way. In much of the city, Parks tends
to be judged not as a black man but on how he has responded to the
varying needs of L.A.'s ethnic landscape.</LD>
<TE>   Many Asian American leaders, for example, tend to be on Parks'
side, but for a reason largely unknown to blacks: He has promoted
Asians within the department. Among Latinos, many view the Parks-Hahn
feud through a prism of frustration, weary that so much of the
discussion still is framed in black-white terms. Some whites support
Hahn and feel blacks are using race, while others feel Hahn is guilty
of betrayal.</TE>
<TE>   "This has created a very odd circumstance and every group in the
city has a different perspective now on LAPD," said Raphael
Sonenshein, a political scientist at Cal State Fullerton. "It proves
that the city's politics are much more fragmented than they ever used
to be. Now you have very odd alliances and in a strange way that
could be called progress."</TE>
<TE>   Progress, in this scenario, means that as Parks' race becomes less
polarizing, more attention would be paid to specific issues, such as
Parks' accountability for rising crime, for department and community
morale, or complying with a federal consent decree that requires
stronger oversight of problem officers.</TE>
<TE>   Not all blacks--or even all black leaders--oppose Hahn's stand.
But in recent years, African Americans have tended to be more unified
on this and many political questions than other groups, polls show. A
Los Angeles Times poll taken in February 2001 for example, found 58%
of blacks approved of Parks' performance as chief, with 22%
disapproving. Whites, Latinos and Asians were far more divided, with
no group giving the chief more than 34% approval or less than 27%
disapproval.</TE>
<TE>   There are several reasons for the intensity of the response to
Hahn's decision, at least among black leaders. One is that the fight
over Parks comes at the end of a decade of steady decline in black
political power in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   It is also the case, however one judges Parks' record, that many
blacks believe Los Angeles police officers are far more respectful
under Parks.</TE>
<TE>   "Now you can walk up to a police officer and ask a question
without being afraid you're going to get knocked down," said Lauren
Bradley of South Los Angeles. "I don't drive around and see people
lying on the sidewalk face down any more. It was inhuman. You would
see people thrown to the ground like dogs," Bradley said.</TE>
<TE>   At a recent community meeting, when a former police official who
supports Parks began by saying, "You know that we have many, many
sterling officers on the street doing an outstanding job for you,"
many people in the all-black crowd nodded in agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Some fear that Hahn's decision is the first step backward. They
remember days when Los Angeles paid more than any other major city,
except Detroit, to resolve police misconduct lawsuits. Many remember
a night in April 1988 when 1,453 people--mostly blacks and
Latinos--were arrested during a sweep against gangs. All but 100 were
released without charges being filed.</TE>
<TE>   Many blacks who voted for Hahn last year were drawn to him by the
respect his late father, county Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, paid to his
black constituents.</TE>
<TE>   "We loved his father and we love him," said Thomas Wright, chief
executive of Voices Inc., an African American marketing firm. "His
father fought for diversity and we're hoping he keeps the torch in
his hand and not drop it on the ground. But I know what the old
regime is like--the Gates regime--and that is what I'm afraid of."</TE>
<TE>   Some Asian residents feel the same gratitude to Parks that blacks
feel toward Hahn's father.</TE>
<TE>   Asians Promoted Under Chief Parks</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the chief made Capt. Paul Kim, a Korean American, the
first Asian American commander in LAPD history. Parks also has
promoted three other Asians to captain, something that had never
happened in the department's 150-year history.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no means to measure his performance, but because he
promoted Paul Kim ... we have a lot of goodwill toward Chief Parks,"
said Charles Kim, executive director of the Korean American Coalition
and a longtime political observer. Parks, he said, is the only police
chief with whom the Korean American community has had any
relationship.</TE>
<TE>   That opinion is hardly universal. Stewart Kwoh, president of the
Asian Pacific American Legal Center, suggested that Parks' record is
mixed: "In terms of community-based policing and consent decree
issues, I haven't seen forward motion," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some Latino residents can, on one hand, sympathize with blacks
outraged at Hahn's decision. Three years ago, the Los Angeles Unified
School District board demoted the district's superintendent, Ruben
Zacarias, a figure beloved in many Latino neighborhoods for his
decades of experience as a local educator.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, a coalition of organized Latino opposition to
Parks, called Latinos for a New Police Chief, has been meeting for
months. Implicit in its existence is the belief that the time has
come for Los Angeles--where 42% in 2000 were Latinos--to have a
Latino police chief.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd be remiss if I said people aren't thinking about it," said Al
Ruvacalba, a retired police officer and member of the coalition. "But
who's out there? I haven't heard any names. I'd like to say, 'Yes, we
have somebody in mind,' but no, we don't."</TE>
<TE>   The rise in crime is the main issue fueling the coalition,
Ruvacalba said. "But we don't need to tear the chief apart. He's
really a good man; he tried for five years and did his best."</TE>
<TE>   Some Latinos fault Parks for not moving aggressively enough
against officers implicated in the Rampart Division scandal, in which
officers victimized and falsely arrested residents in a poor Latino
district west of downtown.</TE>
<TE>   "He dragged his feet on Rampart; he didn't try to expand it," said
Luis Carrillo, a civil rights lawyer who has handled many police
misconduct cases, including some arising from Rampart.</TE>
<TE>   Raul Nunez, president of a local chapter of the Mexican American
Political Assn. and a member of the new chief coalition, sides with
the chief's foes in the Police Protective League who say that police
officers now are required to spend too much of their time responding
to complaints.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe most of the people who are complaining are the ones who
are committing the criminal acts," Nunez said. "If law enforcement is
tough on them then they shouldn't be out there committing crimes."</TE>
<TE>   Weekly meetings in heavily Latino Boyle Heights have provided an
outlet for fear of crime. Recently, about 300 people crowded a town
hall meeting at the Wabash Library. They grieved at the recent murder
of a young man gunned down in front of his wife and 4-year-old son
and wondered where the police were. On Tuesday, a group of residents
will take a bus to the Police Commission meeting and deliver an
evaluation of Parks.</TE>
<TE>   Many whites, meanwhile, appear to be less likely to draw a direct
connection between Parks' performance and a spike in crime,
promotions within the department or respectful treatment by officers.</TE>
<TE>   Whites' Opinions Vary on the Feud</TE>
<TE>   "You know, being white, I'm not sure I have a proper appreciation
of why there should be a race card drawn here," said David Rose, 6O,
as he leafed through the Wall Street Journal at a Tarzana carwash.</TE>
<TE>   "If I was living in South-Central L.A., I might have a much
different view," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Kassel, 72, of Woodland Hills said she was mystified by
the angry response to Hahn's announcement from black leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "I was amazed that they were disappointed," Kassel said. "I mean,
they don't like the police force any more than anybody else does. And
it all goes back to the chain of command," she said. "The buck stops
at the chief's desk."</TE>
<TE>   Black people, having voted roughly 80% for Hahn, were simply
outmaneuvered by him, said Sandra Soll of Tarzana.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely understand all the rancor, but that's too bad," Soll
said. "That's politics. Any politician is going to say whatever a
particular population wants to hear to get elected."</TE>
<TE>   Frank Bank, also of Tarzana, was furious with the mayor.</TE>
<TE>   "Hahn should be hung," he said grimly. "He knew what Parks' record
was. I think he betrayed the confidence of the African American
community. I really do. I guess it doesn't affect me quite as much as
if I lived in the inner city, but what Hahn did was wrong."</TE>

<HD>2 Competing Visions for Silver Lake Property</HD>
<DH>Land use: Developer finds his plan to build 71 homes on an
old Red Car right of way is a tough sell. Hahn, Councilman Garcetti
back a proposal for an urban park.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEORGE RAMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Developer Dave Tompkins says he isn't discouraged that Los Angeles
Mayor James K. Hahn is against his plan to build 71 homes on an old
Red Car trolley right of way in Silver Lake.</LD>
<LD>   But it was hard for Tompkins to watch Hahn at a recent community
meeting, leading the crowd in chants of "Keep the Red Car green!"</LD>
<LD>   "That was a little unfair," the developer said later, maintaining
that the mayor and area Councilman Eric Garcetti haven't been fully
informed about his housing proposal, which includes three acres for
green space.</LD>
<TE>   Hahn and Garcetti support an opposing plan sought by a residents
group to turn the 10.8-acre parcel two blocks from the Los Angeles
River into an urban park that can be part of a growing river-oriented
network of open space.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't an uphill battle," said Tompkins, a former city
planner in Beverly Hills. "I think that when the public is educated,
they'll see that it's a good project for Silver Lake by creating new
homes."</TE>
<TE>   The competing visions for the property, commonly referred to as
the Corralitas Red Car land, have stirred debate among residents of a
neighborhood where some hillside homes have a panoramic view of the
site, the river and the Golden State and Glendale freeways.</TE>
<TE>   A group called the Community Residents' Assn. for Parks, says an
urban park, with a walking trail running the length of the property,
makes more sense than homes there. "I can't imagine more residential
property placed here in an area that's already so dense with homes,"
Juliett Giordano said. "Parking is incredibly difficult here."</TE>
<TE>   More than 400 signatures have been collected by the association to
support a park governed by the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy.
But in Silver Lake, where many are sensitive to environmental issues
and concerns, there is some dissent from the popular view that a park
is the best use of the land.</TE>
<TE>   Architect Tony Unruh, a resident and one of about 100 who recently
signed petitions supporting Tompkins' project, said new homes would
enhance the property, which he says is an eyesore.</TE>
<TE>   "Single-family homes would bring up the values [of existing homes]
and, aesthetically, the area would look way better," he said. "It
just looks like a big trash can."</TE>
<TE>   The clash of ideas is reminiscent of the battles over proposals to
turn two parcels near the river in nearby communities into parks.</TE>
<TE>   One site in Chinatown, the so-called Cornfield, was designated by
former Mayor Richard Riordan to be an $80-million industrial park.</TE>
<TE>   On the north bank of the river, another City Hall-supported plan
to turn a former Union Pacific rail property, dubbed Taylor Yard,
into an industrial park was opposed by activists and residents in
adjacent Cypress Park.</TE>
<TE>   After lawsuits and community opposition delayed the projects, the
developers dropped their proposals, and the owners agreed to sell the
land to the state for parks.</TE>
<TE>   Tompkins finds himself spending a lot of time trying to rally
converts to his position because of Hahn's and Garcetti's opposition.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been walking door to door for several weeks, trying to tell
folks about what we're trying to do," he said at a local coffee shop,
pointing to an armful of diagrams and photos of his project.</TE>
<TE>   His plan calls for 31 single-family homes, priced from the
mid-$400,000s to more than $500,000, to be built at the north end of
the property--near Fletcher and Riverside drives.</TE>
<TE>   On the parcel's southern end, which faces the Glendale Freeway,
Tompkins has proposed building 40 moderately priced duplex units.</TE>
<TE>   In the middle of the narrow plot would be a three-acre park for
the new homeowners and others who have lived in the area for years.</TE>
<TE>   The residents group and the conservancy, however, envision an
urban park with an enhanced array of natural vegetation, a trail and
an information kiosk. The park would provide walkers, joggers and
others with easy access to the river, which is just on the other side
of the Golden State Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he does face an uphill battle," Garcetti said of
Tompkins. "The community wants to see a park there. Development is a
step backward."</TE>
<TE>   There's another similarity between the dispute over the Corralitas
property and other recent campaigns for river-related parks.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the Cornfield and Taylor Yard, the developers
rebuffed initial attempts to buy the land for park use. In both
cases, activists and residents lobbied the state to buy the parcels,
arguing that parkland was more desirable than warehouses.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, after months of mounting opposition, the developers
agreed to sell the land to the state for nearly $60 million.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, the owner of the Silver Lake property, Liza E.
Torkan, isn't interested in selling the parcel to the conservancy,
which says it has $540,000 in state and county park funds available
to buy it.</TE>
<TE>   Several attempts in recent years to purchase the land for a park
have fallen through--partly, some say, because previous owners wanted
too much for the parcel. Torkan, a Los Angeles businesswoman who took
on investors to acquire the property, bought it last year for
$300,000.</TE>
<TE>   Before World War II, the site was an important right of way for
Red Car trolleys, connecting downtown Los Angeles with Glendale and
other outlying communities.</TE>
<TE>   In 1955, the land was abandoned, when the Pacific Electric
inter-urban streetcars stopped running. The remnants of the bridge
that carried the streetcars over Fletcher Drive, at Riverside Drive,
are still visible near the property.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors say the land is being used as a place to dump trash,
drink booze, scrawl graffiti and other illegal activities.</TE>
<TE>   On two occasions since 1989, various owners of the property have
tried to build homes on the parcel. A plan for 25 homes was approved
in 1989, but the permit to build lapsed. Another plan fell through in
the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Some say Tompkins' proposal may be the last best chance to do
something meaningful with the Corralitas property.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not persuaded" by the arguments of park proponents, said
Wendy Lusby, who has lived in Silver Lake for 26 years. "How far are
we from Griffith Park? Silver Lake [reservoir]?"</TE>
<TE>   Resident Diane Edwardson counters, "I believe the whole city needs
new housing. But this is one of the densest [populated] communities
in the city. We cannot handle the type of density that [Tompkins] is
proposing."</TE>

<HD>Planners Slow Major Irvine Development</HD>
<DH>Infrastructure: Three commissioners balk at the city's
ambitious schedule for approving the latest project, called Northern
Sphere.</DH>

<LD>Two large developments the Irvine Co. wants to build near the former
El Toro Marine base would generate more than twice the traffic that
an airport at El Toro would, prompting fresh concern by Irvine
planning commissioners.</LD>
<LD>   One development would convert the company's remaining strawberry
and bean fields into a 10.2-million-square-foot extension of the
Irvine Spectrum.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, a Superior Court judge halted planning for that
project, saying the city's environmental review was inadequate.</LD>
<TE>   The other would add 7 million square feet of commercial space and
12,350 homes.</TE>
<TE>   Both projects lie just outside the city's boundaries and wrap
around the northwest corner of the former Marine base. The city hopes
to annex the lands, increasing the city's size by 40%, and the
pending decisions are predicated on that prospect.</TE>
<TE>   The developments represent most of the Irvine Co.'s final plans to
develop the city within the next 15 to 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   During a hearing last week, three planning commissioners balked at
the city's ambitious schedule for approving the latest project, the
Northern Sphere, which includes both proposed developments.</TE>
<TE>   The city's schedule has the Planning Commission voting on the
project in early March, but commissioners said they did not expect to
vote until the end of March at the earliest.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioners said they want to be certain that traffic and other
impacts have been addressed, particularly given the city's laser-like
scrutiny of every aspect of the county's airport project.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing is going to be rushed," Commissioner Mark Petracca said.
"This is the end game. We all have a strong appreciation for the
historic importance of this decision. No one is going to push this
through."</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Ken Hansen said the company has been "in a hurry" to
get the two projects approved while the city continues to encourage
development around El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   The city added plans for homes and child-care centers around the
base in an effort to enlist more allies to fight the proposed
airport.</TE>
<TE>   "There shouldn't be any rush on this," Hansen said.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Co. spokesman Mike LeBlanc said the commission's
thoroughness is appropriate. He denied that the company was
attempting to rush the approvals.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been engaged well over a year working on this," he said of
the Northern Sphere project. "The commissioners need to act when
they're comfortable doing so."</TE>
<TE>   On March 5, voters will decide whether to replace zoning for an El
Toro airport with zoning for a large urban park. That vote could
dampen desire for new development around the base.</TE>
<TE>   The Northern Sphere project encompasses 8,150 acres, with
development on 3,000 acres. It would add 35,000 residents to the city
of 150,000, and generate 255,000 more daily car trips in the area.</TE>
<TE>   The adjacent expansion of the Spectrum--onto 600 acres of
agricultural land--would mean an additional 103,000 daily car trips,
for a total of 358,000 daily car trips for the two projects.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, the county's proposed El Toro airport would
generate 176,000 trips a day by 2020. Bob Caustin of the
environmental group Defend the Bay, which successfully sued over the
Spectrum expansion, called the conversion of so much land into office
space "mind-boggling."</TE>
<TE>   The group said in court that the city's impact report failed to
deal with traffic, pollution and the loss of agricultural land that
would be caused by developing the fields.</TE>
<TE>   Development of just that area is projected for 2005 in documents
submitted to the city, and would add an average of 2.5 million square
feet a year.</TE>
<TE>   Over the past five years, all developers in Orange County combined
have built about 3.5 million square feet a year of office and
light-industrial space.</TE>
<TE>   Petracca said he wants to review the recommendations of the city's
Transportation and Infrastructure Commission before taking action on
the Northern Sphere project. The environmental review of the Spectrum
expansion--which was halted by Judge William F. McDonald as a result
of Defend the Bay's suit--also must be reworked and resubmitted.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Doug Rapp said he couldn't vote on the new
development until after the comment period ends for the Northern
Sphere environmental review. Comments are due Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The city's responses to those concerns also should be considered,
Rapp, Petracca and Hansen said; they are due by March 19.</TE>
<TE>   The city's schedule calls for the planning commission to vote
March 7, with City Council approval on March 26.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel like anyone's pushing me," Rapp said. "At the end of
the day, I'm the one who has to vote. Right now, we're being asked to
look at a very large picture. I don't want to ever make a decision
with a major piece of information missing."</TE>

off Redondo Beach. Santa Ana winds, which were out of the east at
about 10mph, caused problems for some surfers. Three- to 5-foot waves
were reported in the South Bay. Warm weather, with temperatures
soaring into the lower 80s, drew thousands of people to Southern
California beaches. More of the same is expected today.</CP>

<DH>Real estate: Renamed neighborhoods often give residents
cachet and higher property values.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Long before there was talk of Valley secession, there was secession
in the Valley. For more than a decade, San Fernando Valley
neighborhoods have been breaking off from established communities,
giving themselves new names and almost instantly reaping benefits.</LD>
<LD>   Starting in 1987, West Hills was carved out of Canoga Park, North
Hills left Sepulveda, Valley Village and West Toluca Lake ditched
North Hollywood, and Valley Glen and Lake Balboa said farewell to Van
Nuys.</LD>
<LD>   Some observers say these neighborhoods haven't changed anything
but their monikers. But members of neighborhood associations and
others say a name change is more than skin deep. It can give a
neighborhood cachet, boost property values and increase its political
clout.</LD>
<TE>   To use the jargon of marketing, a new name can brand a
neighborhood as something more desirable than its surroundings. A
rose by any other name might smell as sweet, but many believe that
West Toluca Lake has a ritzier perfume than North Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "It does make the houses more attractive," said Susan Park, who
manages a real estate agency in Woodland Hills. As a lifelong
resident, she has watched the map of the Valley sprout half a dozen
new names over the last 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I was surprised when I first saw it," Park said of the
phenomenon. She recalled when an attractive area in Reseda, known as
Tampa Estates, suddenly annexed itself to the tonier community to the
south: "One day we turned and said, 'Wait a minute. That used to be
Reseda and now it's Tarzana.'</TE>
<TE>   "It's mostly perception that drives it," she said of the uptick in
home prices that often follows a new neighborhood name.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Sanchez said he has never checked, but he believes his house
in Valley Village is worth more than a comparable house outside the
area. Valley Village, which got City Council approval to rename
itself in 1991, is bounded on the west by the Tujunga Wash, on the
north by Burbank Boulevard, on the east by the Hollywood Freeway, and
on the south by the Ventura Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez, a claims supervisor for an insurance company in Century
City, sits on the board of the Valley Village Homeowners Assn. and is
one of the founders of its new Neighborhood Council of Valley
Village.</TE>
<TE>   "If you sent me a letter, you could put Valley Village on it, you
could put North Hollywood on it, you could put Los Angeles on it, and
it would still get there," Sanchez said. But the designation Valley
Village gives the 22,000 people who live there a distinctive
identity, especially in a sprawling city like Los Angeles, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Valley Village's Roots Extend to 1939</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez put together a brief history of the community for its
newsletter, The Valley Villager. In 1939, residents adopted the name
Valley Village and an ambitious plan for a model community with bike
paths and pocket parks. Although that utopian vision was never fully
realized, more recent residents decided to keep the historic name for
their breakaway community.</TE>
<TE>   At first, most other Angelenos didn't know where the community
was, Sanchez said: "It was probably Valley What?" But over the last
decade, its profile has grown and "the name has helped the community
pull together and to be recognized."</TE>
<TE>   "When I moved here [in 1993], I didn't even know it was Valley
Village. I just liked the house," said Sanchez, who owns a
1,000-square-foot, Depression-era cottage on Irvine Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez quickly learned that a coherent community has more juice
in dealing with local politicians and thus more control over its
destiny. For Valley Village, Sanchez explained, the community's bible
is its council-approved "specific plan," a document that fleshes out
the community's credo that "this is a residential area, and we want
to keep it a residential area."</TE>
<TE>   Neighborhood Sets Its Development Rules</TE>
<TE>   The plan has allowed Valley Village to keep out new fast-food
restaurants, automotive businesses and homes higher than 30 feet. "We
want this to stay a quaint little neighborhood," said Sanchez, who
enjoys such small-town amenities as the Fourth of July parade. The
homeowners association has fought to rid Chandler Boulevard of
billboards on its median strip and to have West Park renamed Valley
Village Park.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever new commercial construction or expansion happens in
Valley Village, the association is watchful," the newsletter
promises. Ongoing quality-of-life battles include a sound wall on the
Hollywood Freeway and blocking expansion of Burbank Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Weston is founder of the Weston Group, a Westside ad agency
that counsels builders on winning names for housing developments. Now
a resident of Brentwood, Weston lived in Woodland Hills during the
late 1980s when western Canoga Park was reinventing itself as West
Hills.</TE>
<TE>   West Hills Just Sounds Better</TE>
<TE>   "It has tremendous impact," Weston said of the effect of a
community name change. "Some of that is as simple as West Hills
sounding better than Canoga Park."</TE>
<TE>   But a more mellifluous name isn't enough to explain the $30,000 or
more spurt in house prices he saw when West Hills was born. Weston
also watched the breakaway of North Hills from Sepulveda and that
change, he speculated, was an attempt by residents of an area where
homeowners had upgraded their properties "to distance themselves from
a perception [of poverty and crime] that was unfair or at least
outdated."</TE>
<TE>   West Hills was a little different, he said. In that case,
developers as well as homeowners were involved in the effort to
create a community that would be perceived as more upscale and
desirable than comparable ones nearby.</TE>
<TE>   The almost magical ability of a new name to change consumers'
perceptions transcends the image-conscious Los Angeles housing
market, Weston pointed out. He cited the success the Japanese
automaker enjoyed in the United States after it changed its name from
Datsun to Nissan.</TE>
<TE>   'Word Weight' Factor in Datsun Name Change</TE>
<TE>   Image makers calculate something called "word weight," he said,
and, in that equation, the name Datsun was thought by some to hark
back to World War II, when Japan was the enemy and its symbol was the
rising sun.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever negativity and whatever stigma was associated with the
too-Japanese name of Datsun was neutralized by the introduction of
Nissan," he said. With a new name, the same car soared in popularity.</TE>
<TE>   "These folks were able to create a new paradigm for themselves and
an almost instant difference," said Weston of the creators of West
Hills and other breakaway communities.</TE>
<TE>   Even he was surprised how effective the change was. "It's not like
your whole neighborhood was moved one mile farther from gang
activity," he said. "That psychological change is remarkable."</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Walker is co-founder of Boardwalk, a Glendale graphic design
firm that specializes in branding. He too believes a new name can
boost a neighborhood's image, but only if the area has intrinsic
value.</TE>
<TE>   "Changing a name in a blighted, crime-ridden area isn't going to
do anything for you," he said.</TE>
<TE>   There are no hard and fast rules for changing a community's name,
but Los Angeles City Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski proposed last
month that a consistent policy be developed. She suggested that the
community left behind be allowed to approve the switch and she called
for a moratorium on new names until guidelines are in place.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, a name change is granted at the discretion of the
council member who represents the district. The council member asks
the transportation department to erect the signs that are the only
tangible evidence of the change.</TE>
<TE>   People do respond to attractive-sounding names, Park said. There
are certain streets she would never consider buying on because their
names are off-putting, she said, which may be why so few streets are
named Hog Wallow.</TE>
<TE>   In Park's view, several of the new Valley names are first-rate:
"Valley Glen sounds like it's nestled somewhere. Lake Balboa sounds
beautiful. It sounds like it's on the lake."</TE>
<TE>   Buyers Looking for Affordable Prestige</TE>
<TE>   But ultimately, she said, the success of renaming is rooted in
human nature and the emotional process of finding a home. "Everybody
always aspires," she said, explaining that people want a prestigious
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   A person may start out looking for a house in Calabasas, find
prices there are too high, then find an equally attractive house in
West Hills, she said. The more communities there are, the more
gradations of desirability there are to explore. Having faced
reality, the person who is priced out of West Hills may find a place
he or she loves in Canoga Park and be very happy, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had my druthers," Park said, "I'd have a Porsche. But I look
in my wallet and say, 'Well, maybe I'll get the Nissan.'"</TE>

<HD>Parking Limits Are Criticized</HD>
<DH>Holiday: Leaders at Garden Grove Buddhist temple say
restrictions will dampen the Lunar New Year observance.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Leaders at one of the largest Buddhist temples in the Vietnamese
community on Sunday criticized a decision by Garden Grove officials
to restrict parking for a popular service on the eve of the Lunar New
Year.</LD>
<LD>   "They've blocked too many streets for such an important day," said
the Rev. Thich Phap Chau of the Vietnam Temple, which attracts about
1,000 worshipers.</LD>
<LD>   City officials marked Magnolia Street, between Chapman and Lampson
avenues, with red signs prohibiting parking between 6 tonight and 6
a.m. Tuesday. Many Vietnamese visit temples at midnight to pay their
respects to ancestors for the Lunar New Year, which falls on Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   "People only come here for mass and they leave," Chau said. "It's
just like going to church on Christmas. I'm not having a festival."</TE>
<TE>   City Councilman Mark Leyes said the parking restrictions were
necessary to protect the safety and peace of surrounding
neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "They have to find a better solution," said Loan Ngo, 25, of
Garden Grove, who said that the parking situation has made it
difficult for her to attend prayer sessions at the Vietnam Temple. "I
come in late--about 1 a.m.--when I can find parking and there's less
of a crowd."</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors of the temple have complained for years about the noise,
litter and traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Residents on nearby Sherlock Circle successfully petitioned five
years ago to block off their cul-de-sac and restrict parking to
residentsduring services.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a nightmare. All we could hear was doors banging and
firecrackers popping at 2:30 a.m.," said Joe Patsy, whose house backs
up to the temple.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not trying to be hard to get along with. We just want our
privacy."</TE>

<HD>Financial Jam Mires O.C.'s Toll Highways</HD>
<DH>Transportation: Rosy predictions were hurt by recessions,
lack of drivers. The system teeters on the economic edge as TCA
officials seek a cure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Traffic consultants for the San Joaquin Hills toll road, which runs
through one of the wealthiest swaths of coastal California, were
effusive back in 1992 when they prepared to sell $1.2 billion in
bonds to finance the turnpike.</LD>
<LD>   The tollway, they predicted, would average about 94,500 motorists
a day within a year of its opening--more than enough to pay expenses
and interest on the project's enormous debt.</LD>
<LD>   A decade later, the sky is not so blue.</LD>
<TE>   The 15-mile tollway, which opened in late 1996, has failed to live
up to its traffic and revenue projections. As of December, an average
of 72,000 motorists traveled the road each day, well short of the
1992 forecast or even a revised, more conservative, estimate issued
in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "It remains a hard sell," said Michael McNally, an engineering
professor at UC Irvine's Institute for Transportation Studies. "It
doesn't surprise me that they are having problems. The road was
premature."</TE>
<TE>   Now, with a Wall Street rating firm reducing the highway's bond
rating to "junk" status, the toll road authority has been going about
the sobering business of revisiting its finances. The CEO for the
toll agency said he fears the road could be in technical default
within five years, a financial path that has put other toll roads
across the nation in financial peril.</TE>
<TE>   All this comes as tolls on the road are being raised to $3 a trip,
a move that could generate new revenue or drive away customers.</TE>
<TE>   The scenario for technical default is real, according to Walter D.
Kreutzen, chief executive officer for the Transportation Corridor
Agencies. He said bondholders were promised that the toll road would
earn $1.30 for every dollar of debt. The ratio was offered as a
margin of security for investors.</TE>
<TE>   If the toll agency fails to maintain that ratio--which Kreutzen
said is very possible--that financial covenant with investors will be
broken. "It is not good," Kreutzen said, "to be in any kind of
default."</TE>
<TE>   Failing to meet the requirement does not mean that bondholders
won't receive their interest payments. The declining margin, however,
is a substantial warning of increased risk and serious financial
problems for the toll road.</TE>
<TE>   The slower-than-expected traffic growth on the toll road had
already prompted two of three Wall Street rating agencies to
downgrade more than $1 billion in corridor bonds to the lowest
investment grade. Last week, Fitch IBCA went a step further and
kicked its rating down to speculative grade, or so-called junk bond
status.</TE>
<TE>   The San Joaquin Hills tollway, which runs from Newport Beach to
north of San Juan Capistrano, is part of a 51-mile network of toll
roads built and operated by the Transportation Corridor Agencies.
Each of the network's two corridors--the San Joaquin and the
Foothill-Eastern--has its own board of directors and financial
obligations.</TE>
<TE>   The San Joaquin Hills tollway has long been the problem child of
the family. Transportation analysts blame its low ridership on
factors that have hampered similar toll-road projects across the
country: lower-than-expected population growth, recessions and
competing public highways.</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego Freeway and Interstate 5, they say, remain viable
options for drivers who might not want to spend as much as $3 to
shave 10 to 15 minutes from a peak-hour trip.</TE>
<TE>   Both freeways, which run through central Orange County, have been
steadily improved over the years, including elimination of the
notorious congestion at the El Toro Y. The dreaded interchange
linking the two freeways has been completely rebuilt and widened.</TE>
<TE>   Two Recessions Take Toll on San Joaquin Corridor</TE>
<TE>   From an economic standpoint, the San Joaquin Hills toll road has
been battered by two recessions since it opened, slowing growth in
Orange County and particularly in the area served by the tollway.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1997 report, traffic consultants Wilbur Smith Associates
concluded that traffic growth was hurt by a significant economic
downturn in Orange County and the rest of Southern California during
the early to mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers said the recession delayed increases in employment in
Orange County for at least six years and somewhat longer along the
San Joaquin Hills corridor.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the toll road opened, the Smith report stated,
employment levels in the project area were still lower than they had
been in 1990 and about 21% less than had been forecast for 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "The 5 and 405 are very viable alternatives and the growth in
housing and commercial development has not occurred as rapidly as
thought," said Kia Mortazavi, manager of planning for the Orange
County Transportation Authority.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Fielding, a professor at UC Irvine's Institute of
Transportation Studies, predicted in the mid-1990s that the San
Joaquin Hills would encounter financial difficulties because of a
lack of motorists for such a large highway. He said a smaller
four-lane road would have accommodated growth for many years as long
as tolls were raised and lowered based on demand.</TE>
<TE>   "This advice was rejected," Fielding said.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the San Joaquin Hills will default on its bond is unclear.
But if it does, it will not be the only tollway in the nation to have
suffered severe financial setbacks.</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago Skyway defaulted on its bonds for about 10 years
before it finally recovered in the mid-1980s. During that time, the
tollway stopped paying interest to bondholders. The Chesapeake Bay
Tunnel went into default as well in the late 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the Garcon Point Bridge, east of Pensacola, Fla., is on the
brink of default on its bonds. The $100-million project includes a
31/2-mile long bridge and more than seven miles of connecting roads.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Samuel, editor of Toll Roads Newsletter, based in Maryland,
said some of these operations recovered and resumed paying interest
to bondholders.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of these roads depended on development for their success,"
Samuel said. "But the expected development often takes a lot longer
than the boosters say it will."</TE>
<TE>   Forecasts by Wilbur Smith Associates had originally called for
94,500 riders a day on the San Joaquin Hills toll road during the
first year of operations. But by spring, six months after its grand
opening, the tollway was averaging only 48,250.</TE>
<TE>   Tollways Fell Short of Projections From Start</TE>
<TE>   Toll officials predicted the shortfall would not hurt the
corridor's ability to meet expenses and pay the interest on its
bonds. They also predicted the gap would disappear within a year.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't.</TE>
<TE>   From July 1998 to June 1999, projections called for the road to
earn almost $51 million in toll revenue from 28.5 million riders. But
it actually collected $42.6 million from 24.8 million transactions.</TE>
<TE>   The latest available figures indicate that the gap is widening.
For the first six months of fiscal year 2001-02, projected revenue
was about $37 million from 18.5 million riders. The actual revenue
was $28 million from 13.2 million riders.</TE>
<TE>   If trends continue, the toll revenue for the current fiscal year
might be about $56 million from 26.5 million motorists. The
projections call for almost $73 million in revenue from 37 million
drivers.</TE>
<TE>   The question facing corridor officials is whether revenue can keep
pace with the road's debt payments, which increase every year for the
life of the bonds. The debt service is scheduled to go up from $46.7
million in January 2003 to $186 million in 2034.</TE>
<TE>   Kreutzen said he is confident that the San Joaquin Hills can meet
its financial obligations until 2007. There is a cash reserve of $140
million and a $12-million federal line of credit, which expires in
five years. The toll agency also has been cutting its administrative
costs to save money.</TE>
<TE>   To help pay the debt service, the corridor agency already has used
a $36-million infusion of cash from the settlements of lawsuits
related to the Orange County bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Today, transportation officials are considering ways to refinance
the tollway, including a merger of the two boards that govern the San
Joaquin Hills, the Foothill and the Eastern turnpikes.</TE>
<TE>   They say they hope to present proposals to the corridor's
leadership this year.</TE>
<TE>   Bond rating reports show that the transportation authority is
considering refinancing the outstanding bonds of all three toll
roads. Revenue would be combined to cover the annual debt service of
the unified system.</TE>
<TE>   "My goal is to do a solid, long-term fix," Kreutzen said.</TE>
<TE>   The Foothill and the Eastern tollways are the healthiest of the
three highways, with ridership running ahead of projections by about
8%. Bond rating agencies that evaluate the agencies' debt have
described the economic outlook of the two turnpikes as stable.</TE>

<HD>Wildfire Gobbles 1,700 Acres in O.C.</HD>
<DH>Safety: The wind-borne blaze near Anaheim Hills may be
under control today. Fearful residents have been braced to evacuate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY and SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pushed by stubborn, shifting Santa Ana winds, an uncontrolled brush
fire blackened at least 1,700 acres by Sunday evening as it burned
for a second day in the wild lands of northeastern Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   The fire began Saturday night and was still burning late Sunday,
with gusts of up to 50 mph spreading flames through thick, oily scrub
and sending ominous pillars of smoke over the nearest neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   No one was injured and no homes were threatened Sunday evening.</LD>
<TE>   But that did not stop panicky residents from packing up precious
belongings and preparing to flee on a moment's notice.</TE>
<TE>   "Last night we could see the flames and feel the wind and smoke
coming into our eyes," said Mark Little as he and his four young
children watched the blaze Sunday from their Anaheim Hills home about
a mile away. "This hillside always burns every couple of years. But
this is the biggest one, combined with the wind. And this is probably
the closest a fire has come to the house."</TE>
<TE>   By Sunday evening, an estimated 1,700 acres had burned in Coal
Canyon, which stretches east of Anaheim Hills and through Chino Hills
State Park between the Eastern toll road and the Riverside Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze was 35% contained, and authorities said they might gain
control of it by today. Firefighters said they were confident they
could keep the flames away from homes because the winds were starting
to die down.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they're getting a handle on it," said Capt. Stephen J.
Miller, a spokesman for the Orange County Fire Authority.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the fire is under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   It began about 9 p.m. Saturday near the Riverside County line in
Coal Canyon before moving swiftly southwest toward the Eastern toll
road.</TE>
<TE>   By Sunday morning, more than 1,000 firefighters were on the scene,
including crews from Orange and Los Angeles counties, the U.S. Forest
Service and the California Department of Forestry and Fire
Protection. Four water-dropping helicopters also were on hand,
although only two were flying most of Sunday because of the winds.</TE>
<TE>   About 650 acres in Coal Canyon became part of Chino Hills State
Park last year, after a development company that planned to build
1,550 homes agreed to sell the property to the park system for $30
million.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates say the canyon is important because it joins two large
wilderness tracts in one of California's fastest-growing areas. That
connection allows animals to roam freely between Chino Hills State
Park and Cleveland National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a critical missing link in that chain of wild lands," said
Claire Schlotterbeck, president of Hills for Everyone, which
spearheaded the deal. "It's an opportunity for plants to spread
themselves where they once were."</TE>
<TE>   The landscape hit by the weekend fire features several rare plants
and trees, including one of the world's four remaining stands of
Tecate Cypress, a species that once blanketed the southwest.
Riversidian sage scrub, dudleyas and Braunton's milk-vetch are among
other shrubbery and flowers in the area.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of these plants and trees are dependent on fire,"
Schlotterbeck said. "It might not be bad for them. But it sure does
pain the heart to see [the canyon] burn after we just saved it."</TE>
<TE>   As ground crews made their way through the rugged terrain with
bulldozers and chain saws to create a fire break, some whipped-up
embers ignited flare-ups.</TE>
<TE>   Although the closest neighborhood to the fire was a mile away in
Anaheim Hills, residents there were not taking any chances.</TE>
<TE>   After a sleepless night, many residents gathered Sunday outside
their homes to watch for signs of danger.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Guesmon said he saw flames glowing over the hills Saturday
night. He sent his wife and 8-year-old son to a relative's in Orange,
and stayed behind.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Parzych, who was driving his 12-year-old daughter around to
sell Girl Scout cookies Sunday, said she was afraid to get out of the
car to look at the fire.</TE>
<TE>   "You get concerned," he said, "when you see flames and ashes going
past you like snowflakes."</TE>

<HD>Winds Topple Trees, Knock Out Power</HD>
<DH>Weather: County endures a second day of strong gusts.
Family narrowly escapes serious injury when car is crushed. Coast
Guard rescues stranded boater.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT and TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the second day in a row, high winds whipped across Ventura County
on Sunday, knocking out power for hundreds of residents, stranding at
least one boater at sea and uprooting dozens of trees.</LD>
<LD>   More than a dozen fender benders and minor crashes were reported
by local police.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff's deputies received more than 120 calls of car and
building alarms activated by the winds. On a normal day there are
about six alarm calls, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   At least one train crossing gate in Oxnard was torn off by the
gusts. Tree limbs and other debris lined the center divider of the
Ventura Freeway between Camarillo and Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   In Oxnard, a family of five narrowly escaped serious injury when
their Oldsmobile sedan was crushed by a eucalyptus tree that fell on
Pleasant Valley Road.</TE>
<TE>   "They were just cruising down the road and this tree ... just cut
this car in half," Oxnard Police Cmdr. Tom Chronister said.</TE>
<TE>   The tree weighed at least a ton, said Leo Ovalle, an Oxnard city
worker called out to remove it.</TE>
<TE>   Two adults and three children were in the car, said Senior Officer
Scott Swenson. All were taken to St. John's Regional Medical Center
in Oxnard, where they were treated for minor cuts and released.</TE>
<TE>   The adults were identified as Miguel Nuno, 40, and his wife,
Braulia, 27, both of Oxnard. The names of the three children, ages
12, 10, and 3, were not released.</TE>
<TE>   "They were in the wrong place at the wrong time, but they were
lucky," Swenson said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, officials at the Ventura County medical examiner's
office said that a 51-year-old Simi Valley man struck by a falling
tree Saturday afternoon died from blunt-force head injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral arrangements for Brian W. Smith, hit by the tree while
playing tennis with friends in Simi Valley, were pending.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, the U.S. Coast Guard sent a rescue boat to Santa Cruz
Island about 2 p.m. after the captain of a 23-foot vessel phoned
authorities saying he needed help motoring back to Ventura through
7-foot swells.</TE>
<TE>   Coast Guard crews escorted the boat back to the mainland without
incident, said Danny Cooley, a Coast Guard coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California Edison spokesman Ernie Villegas said strong
winds snapped several power lines along Las Posas Road in Camarillo
about 8 a.m., knocking out power to about 630 mostly residential
customers.</TE>
<TE>   Edison crews worked all day Sunday to erect new poles and restore
power, which was expected to be back on by late evening, Villegas
said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the National Weather Service in Oxnard said wind
speeds across the county reached more than 70 mph.</TE>
<TE>   The strongest gusts slammed Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks, said
Bill Hoffer, a federal meteorologist. "There was a real intense
low-pressure area in the Gulf of Alaska that was sucking down icy
cold air into a high-pressure area off our coast. It moved east and
came over us, and we received the winds, big time," Hoffer said.</TE>
<TE>   The strong winds were expected to end late Sunday and be replaced
by clear, sunny skies, with high temperatures in the low 70s today.</TE>

<LD>Jack Henry Abbott, whose prison writings were turned into the
best-selling book "In the Belly of the Beast" and made him the
temporary darling of author Norman Mailer and other members of the
New York radical chic literati, hanged himself Sunday in his prison
cell. He was 58.</LD>
<LD>   Abbott was found dead in his single cell at Wende Correctional
Facility near Alden, N.Y., said a spokesman for the New York
Department of Corrections. He said that Abbott hanged himself with a
bedsheet and a shoelace and that he left a suicide note but refused
to reveal its contents.</LD>
<LD>   The son of a prostitute, Abbott went through a string of foster
homes and entered the penal system at age 12 with reform school. He
had two short episodes of freedom as an adult--six months at 18, only
to be convicted of writing bad checks, and for about three months
after Mailer helped free him in 1981.</LD>
<TE>   Abbott stabbed two men to death, the first a fellow prison inmate
in 1966, and the second a New York waiter and aspiring actor on July
18, 1981, during his brief tenure in the limelight.</TE>
<TE>   Like most writers, Abbott wrote about what he knew--in his case
prison life and what he termed the heroic qualities of violent men.</TE>
<TE>   Describing his stabbing of another inmate, Abbott wrote the lines
eloquently delivered by actor Andrew Robinson in the 1984 Mark Taper
Forum play adaptation of "In the Belly of the Beast":</TE>
<TE>   "You can feel his life trembling through the knife in your hand.
It almost overcomes you, the gentleness of the feeling at the center
of a coarse act of murder.... You go to the floor with him to finish
him. It is like cutting hot butter, no resistance at all. They always
whisper one thing at the end: 'Please.' You get the odd impression he
is not imploring you not to harm him, but to do it right."</TE>
<TE>   Comparing the feeling after murder to that of a young man after
his first sexual encounter, he added, "You feel stronger."</TE>
<TE>   In 1977, when Abbott learned that Mailer was writing the book "The
Executioner's Song" about death row inmate Gary Gilmore, he wrote the
author, offering to advise him on how imprisonment affects men.</TE>
<TE>   Mailer, later calling Abbott's letters "as good as any convict's
prose that I had read since Eldridge Cleaver," maintained a prolific
correspondence with the inmate from 1978 to 1981.</TE>
<TE>   In 1980, he had excerpts printed in the New York Review of Books,
prodding Random House to suggest the book, which was published in
1981.</TE>
<TE>   Mailer further went to bat for Abbott with the parole board, and
in June 1981 succeeded in getting him released to a halfway house in
New York's Bowery.</TE>
<TE>   The author bought him a $500 suit and a pair of good shoes, hired
him as his $150-a-week researcher and introduced him to other
influential people, including the late author Jerzy Kosinski.</TE>
<TE>   Abbott the jailhouse writer quickly became a celebrity,
interviewed on "Good Morning America" and other programs and featured
in People magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Within six weeks of his release from prison, glowing in the
attention from his just-published book, he went to New York's Binibon
24-hour restaurant with a girl on each arm, and got into an argument
with the actor-waiter Richard Adan over using an employees' restroom.
Taking the fight outside, Abbott stabbed the waiter to death and
fled.</TE>
<TE>   The Sunday New York Times had just hit the street with a review of
"In the Belly of the Beast," describing the book as "awesome,
brilliant, perversely ingenuous; its impact is indelible, and as an
articulation of penal nightmare it is completely compelling."</TE>
<TE>   The fugitive Abbott was captured two months after the stabbing,
convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 15 years to life. He was
next due for a parole hearing in June 2003.</TE>
<TE>   His book was adapted into an edgy play of the same title first by
Adrian Hall at Trinity Square Playhouse in Rhode Island and then
re-adapted by director Robert Woodruff for the Taper Forum in 1984.
The Los Angeles production was based not only on Abbott's letters but
on transcripts from his manslaughter trial.</TE>
<TE>   One Times reviewer, when the play opened, wrote: "The
dramatization is a gut-wrenching indictment of far more than our
penal system....It gives us Abbott, unadorned, in his own words,
which is enough. He's a devilishly articulate analyst of the system
that has him by the throat. His perceptions are both astonishing and
on the mark."</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, after a bizarre civil trial in which Abbott represented
himself, a jury awarded Adan's widow more than $7.5 million in
damages for the wrongful death.</TE>
<TE>   "I've become a writer," Abbott told jurors during the 1990 civil
trial, inquiring of each if he had read his book. "As good as any
other writer in this country, or even in Europe. This was something
told to me, and I was encouraged to write. It was told to me by some
of the top publishers and editors in this country."</TE>
<TE>   But those once-fawning supporters changed their minds after Abbott
stabbed a man, abusing the freedom they had helped him win. Mailer's
friend Scott Meredith said, "Norman and I are stunned and distressed.
I guess there's some residual regret on everyone's part."</TE>
<TE>   Kosinski was so remorseful that many said the episode contributed
to his subsequent suicide. "Both Mailer and I believe in the
purgatory power of art," he mourned. "We pretended he [Abbott] had
always been a writer. It was a fraud. It was like the '60s, when we
embraced the Black Panthers in that moment of radical chic without
understanding their experience.</TE>
<TE>   "I blame myself again for becoming part of radical chic," he said.
"I went to welcome a writer, to celebrate his intellectual birth. But
I should have been welcoming a just-freed prisoner, a man from
another planet."</TE>

From Far Right</HD>

<LD>   This is an example of one problem gubernatorial candidate Richard
Riordan faces: A flier is slipped under delegates' doors at a
Republican state convention equating Riordan with Gov. Gray Davis. It
claims they have the same "objectives for California: Killing babies,
taking your guns and destroying traditional marriage."</LD>
<LD>   It arrives overnight with two other Riordan hit pieces and an
invitation by "the Bill Simon volunteer organization" to a rally
welcoming Simon to the convention. Maybe it's a coincidence, but the
fliers all are printed from the same paper stock with similar
typefaces.</LD>
<TE>   Republican Riordan and Democrat Davis both support allowing women
to make their own decisions about abortion. They also favor moderate
gun controls and gay rights. That makes them too liberal for many
Republicans, especially the ideological zealots who give up their
weekends to attend a party convention.</TE>
<TE>   A recent statewide Times Poll found an almost even split among
Republican voters over whether abortion should remain legal or be
made illegal. The survey also showed the GOP dilemma: Among all
registered voters, legal abortion is favored by nearly 2 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   The hard fact is that no top-of-the-ticket candidate who opposes
abortion rights has won a California general election since 1988. And
in that span, Republicans have slipped--state GOP chairman Shawn
Steel acknowledged to reporters--to "the verge of irrelevance."</TE>
<TE>   Steel contends the party is turning around, but Democrats still
firmly control the levers of state government and the congressional
delegation.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan's two underdog but scrappy rivals for the GOP
gubernatorial nomination-- superrich businessman Simon and Secretary
of State Bill Jones--both oppose abortion rights. Recent history
suggests these conservatives cannot beat Davis in November, not only
because of their anti-abortion stands, but because they oppose gun
controls and are to the right of the electorate on environmental
protection.</TE>
<TE>   So Davis has been smacking Riordan--the only potential opponent he
fears--from the other end, effectively challenging his "pro-choice"
credentials. In TV ads, Davis notes that Riordan has donated
thousands to anti-abortion causes and, before he was L.A. mayor, once
called abortion "murder."</TE>
<TE>   The GOP front-runner was slow to react after all this boiled over
two weeks ago. Finally, Saturday in a candidates' debate, he tried to
explain: "I very strongly dislike abortion. But I just as strongly
respect the right of a woman to make a choice with respect to her own
body." He "regretted" calling abortion murder.</TE>
<TE>   Delegates loudly booed when a reporter asked about abortion
because the GOP really doesn't want to discuss this losing subject.
The problem is, many Republican activists do talk about it and act
accordingly. In fact, Simon's main goal in a televised debate three
weeks ago was to inform Republican viewers he's "pro-life," an
advisor says.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, this is not a topic the GOP can just ignore--as long as
its candidates oppose abortion rights--because Democrats have learned
they can pounce on their opponents' "pro-life" stands to portray them
as extremists.</TE>
<TE>   Simon declared during the debate--as he does daily--that "this
primary is about the heart and soul of the Republican Party."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed it is. But it's not only about that, unfortunately for
Riordan. It's not quite that simple--just moving the party from the
right toward the center to make it more voter-friendly.</TE>
<TE>   It's also about grudges and resentment--about Riordan having
raised roughly $1 million for Democratic causes over the years, half
of it for the late Tom Bradley, who twice ran against former GOP Gov.
George Deukmejian.</TE>
<TE>   An emotional Deukmejian told reporters Saturday that he doesn't
think Riordan is "trustworthy" and "I don't respect him." Therefore,
Deukmejian said he could not vote for Riordan even over Davis. Three
former state party chairmen also declared they couldn't vote for
Riordan in November.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan's explanations of his bipartisanship have been weak:
Bradley was a "friend," L.A. is a Democratic city and he had to "get
along." In a partisan primary, Riordan still needs to persuade voters
he's a real Republican.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, notes Assemblyman Rod Pacheco (R-Riverside), an
early Riordan supporter: "In one sense, you need the party. But in
another sense, if your party's brand name is not selling anymore,
then running against the party can be very effective."</TE>
<TE>   The GOP has been out there so far on the right it may need a
dramatic shift leftward to get back into a winning position in
California. The party's "heart and soul" definitely could use a new
beat and a reawakened spirit.</TE>
<TE>   "Baby killing" verbiage only inspires Democratic victories.</TE>

<HD>Simon Ends Convention on a High Note</HD>
<DH>Politics: A straw poll shows 40% of state GOP delegates
supporting the businessman, compared with 27% for Riordan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI and MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>California Republicans concluded their state convention Sunday after
a weekend in which businessman Bill Simon Jr. stepped up his
challenge to former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, accusing
Riordan of being too liberal to represent Republicans in the race to
beat Gov. Gray Davis.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, Simon won an unscientific, nonbinding straw poll of
delegates to the state Republican Party convention, edging out
Secretary of State Bill Jones and Riordan.</LD>
<LD>   In the poll, 40% backed Simon, compared with 27% supporting
Riordan, whose campaign had tried to stop the balloting from taking
place. Jones--whose campaign lags in fund-raising and was less of a
presence at the convention--pulled in 32% of the 910 votes.</LD>
<TE>   The survey, in which delegates pay for the opportunity to air
their views, provides no scientific measure of general support and is
derided by some analysts as meaningless. It does, however, capture
the views of some of the party's most devoted members and can be a
valuable public relations tool.</TE>
<TE>   The straw poll capped a three-day event that revolved around a
single, strategic debate: whether a moderate such as Riordan or a
conservative in the mold of Simon or Jones would stand the best
chance of defeating Democratic incumbent Davis in November.</TE>
<TE>   Many delegates entered the convention with firm views on that
question, and, if anything, those opinions seemed to harden over the
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Confrontation Between Two Friends</TE>
<TE>   As he appealed to conservatives, Simon also attracted attention
by, for the first time, directly confronting Riordan, a friend. Simon
challenged Riordan during Saturday's debate and called attention to
the former mayor's views on some touchstone issues.</TE>
<TE>   Simon also has tripled his spending on television advertising and
is expected to air spots criticizing Riordan, who is already being
pummeled by negative ads from Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan leads the three GOP candidates in early fund-raising and
polls. Jones has yet to air advertisements.</TE>
<TE>   Both Simon and Jones spent the weekend trying to rile up the
hard-core Republican activists over Riordan's past support of
Democrats and his insistence that the GOP must modify its positions
on issues such as gun control and abortion to reclaim its political
standing in California. By contrast, Jones and Simon contend that
Republicans must remain true to those values, even if they alienate
some California voters. The two campaigns trotted out a series of GOP
officials who said they would not vote for Riordan in the general
election if he prevails in the primaries.</TE>
<TE>   Activists supporting the Simon campaign slipped fliers under
delegates' doors comparing Davis and Riordan's stances. Under both
candidates' photos were the words: "Objectives for California:
Killing babies, taking your guns &amp; destroying traditional marriage."</TE>
<TE>   The halls were thick with delegates wearing stickers sporting
Riordan's June 2000 description of President Clinton as "the greatest
leader in the free world."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel like he represents the Republican Party and the
principles we really stand for as Republicans," Carol Gordon, 67,
said of Riordan. The Torrance resident said she was leaning toward
Simon or Jones.</TE>
<TE>   'A Bad Weekend for Riordan'</TE>
<TE>   K.B. Forbes, a GOP consultant with wide contacts in conservative
camps, cited Riordan's performance in Saturday's debate, in which he
drew boos when a joke about former Gov. George Deukmejian misfired.
"It was a bad weekend for Riordan. It magnified the doubts," Forbes
said.</TE>
<TE>   But Sean McCarthy, a Los Angeles headhunter and longtime Riordan
backer, said he was not worried about the reactions among some of his
fellow delegates.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a group of people, many of whom have made up their minds
about how they feel," he said. "There were some people who came with
the idea that this was a last stand."</TE>
<TE>   Officials with Riordan's campaign shrugged off the weekend. "It
may have been really important to all the people at the Fairmont
Hotel," said one Riordan strategist, referring to the convention
site. "But it's a bubble."</TE>
<TE>   That did not mute the fervor of the 1,300 people who packed the
sprawling downtown San Jose hotel. State conventions usually draw the
most energetic and ideological chunk of the party, and this weekend
was no exception.</TE>
<TE>   The White House, which recruited Riordan to run, has leaned on the
California party leadership to become more moderate, but there was a
clear gulf between the top officials and some of the rank-and-file.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the board of the party agreed to delay the release of
the straw poll results until today, which the Riordan camp desired.
But it was overridden by a voice vote on the convention floor Sunday,
and the results were released a few hours later.</TE>
<TE>   The Simon campaign trumpeted the results as showing their
candidate had the support of the grass-roots, while the Riordan
operation downplayed the significance of the poll. Jones officials
said they were pleased with the showing because they spent less money
on swaying the delegates who voted.</TE>
<TE>   The convention began Friday with the head of the state party,
Shawn Steel, telling reporters that the GOP would unify behind
whomever was the nominee. Less than 30 minutes later, the Simon
campaign led three past party leaders to the podium in the news
conference room to announce that they would not vote for Riordan even
if he made it to the final contest against Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Party Official Cites Missing Elephant</TE>
<TE>   Former party chairman John Herrington, now the co-chairman of
Simon's campaign, cited Riordan's past support for Democrats such as
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, state Sen. John Burton (D-San Francisco) and
former Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley. He said that Riordan does not
mention his party affiliation in his advertising or literature.
"There's an elephant missing," Herrington said, gesturing toward the
table of Riordan literature down the hall. "Where's the elephant?"</TE>
<TE>   The Riordan campaign fired back with a statement from three other
past leaders supporting him. But the next morning, the Jones campaign
brought in its chairman, Deukmejian, to say he would not vote for
Riordan in the general election. The former governor's stance was the
first question of the debate. Riordan replied: "George has a bad
memory. The only thing he remembers are his grudges."</TE>
<TE>   The misfired joke, for which Riordan later apologized, drew
wounded gasps and boos.</TE>
<TE>   It was the sort of remark that fired up staunch foes of the former
mayor, like Gilroy marketing consultant Mark Zappa. "I don't know who
he thought he was talking to," Zappa said. "The people in that room
respect George Deukmejian."</TE>
<TE>   But there were plenty like Loyola Marymount student Michael
Landers, 19, who thought Riordan had an edge tactically and also
reflected their more moderate beliefs. "We have to look at what
candidate is going to beat Gray Davis," said Landers, who said he was
impressed with the other two candidates but was leaning toward
Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to pull people like Landers away from the former
mayor, the Jones campaign flooded the hallway outside the Imperial
Ballroom with supporters waving massive placards showing a
black-and-white photo of Riordan and Davis clasping hands
victoriously. The Riordan forces responded by lifting up color photos
of Riordan and President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   One man wearing a Rhino costume--a reference to the charge that
Riordan is a "Republican In Name Only"--waved at the crowd, some of
whom wore buttons with a red slash through the letters "RINO."</TE>
<TE>   In his closing statement of the debate, Riordan tried to cut the
tension with humor. "People have on Riordan In November buttons
today--RINO." The crowd chortled.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to get that in," the former mayor said.</TE>

<HD>Valley Secession Group Drops a Few Names</HD>
<DH>Community: The moniker search for prospective new city gets
serious, with local leaders winnowing down the list of contenders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUE FOX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Valleywood? Minimallia? Paradise Bluffs or Severance City?</LD>
<LD>   From the affectionate (San Fernandito) to the jaded (Hellish Pit
O' Despair), there has never been a dearth of proposals for a new
name for the San Fernando Valley--even when the matter of Valley
secession was nowhere near the ballot.</LD>
<LD>   Now, as the name game prepares to move from the parlor to the
polls, cheeky monikers culled from newspaper contests and talk shows
seem to be losing ground to more sober suggestions.</LD>
<TE>   Valley VOTE, the group leading the cityhood bid, has until April 5
to narrow the field down to five names. The options could then be put
to a vote alongside secession itself.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people seem to like including the word 'Valley,'" Valley
VOTE President Jeff Brain said. "We've gotten 'Golden Valley,' we've
gotten 'Star Valley' and 'Valley of the Stars.'"</TE>
<TE>   Valley of the Stars? It might work for those banners promoting the
local entertainment industry that flap from light poles, but would
you really want to scrawl it on your envelopes?</TE>
<TE>   "Names are terribly important," said Hal Kassarjian, a UCLA
professor emeritus of marketing. "In this case, they're selling a
city. They're also disposing of the negative baggage that Los Angeles
carries by choosing a new name."</TE>
<TE>   In keeping with such a momentous task, Valley VOTE plans to send
all names through a rigorous quality-control sieve. Adios, Hellholia.</TE>
<TE>   First, secessionists will collect suggestions from the public via
mail and telephone. They have about 60 names so far, and last week
they sent fliers to schools and civic groups in an effort to round up
more.</TE>
<TE>   In late March, Valley VOTE will convene a committee to choose the
top 25 names, which might be forwarded to a polling firm for further
testing, Brain said.</TE>
<TE>   The group can submit up to five names to the county's Local Agency
Formation Commission. Ultimately, if LAFCO puts secession on the
ballot in November, voters who live in the Valley will choose the
prospective city's name.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists note that an early favorite is, in fact, "San
Fernando Valley." But at least one local is dead set against making
the name official: the mayor of San Fernando, a small town in the
northeast Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "They can try to steal our name away from us, but we'd fight
them," Mayor Cindy Montanez declared.</TE>
<TE>   A moment later, she called a reporter back to add another
objection: The whole thing is just too darn perplexing.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's 'San Fernando Valley,' that means, I guess, that the city
of San Fernando wouldn't be part of the San Fernando Valley," she
said. "It's kind of confusing, now that I think of it. I mean, maybe
if they called it something else, like 'West San Fernando' or
something."</TE>
<TE>   The dilemma has persisted for years, and attempts to solve it
haven't been pretty. Jay Leno has tossed out a few unflattering
suggestions--think "Smogadena"--on national television. The Times
sponsored a "Rename The Valley" contest a decade ago, crowning
"Twenty-nine Malls" the winner.</TE>
<TE>   Runners-up included "Rancho de los Ranchos," "Beige-Air,"
"Suburbank" and "Cute North Lemon View Forest Bog." One reader,
commenting on the local political scene, wryly suggested "[L.A. City
Councilman] Hal Bernson Devel opment Corp."</TE>
<TE>   Such titles positively roll off the tongue when compared to the
Valley's original name: El Valle de Santa Catalina de Bononia de los
Encinos (the Valley of St. Catherine of Bologna of the Oaks). That
mouthful comes from the pages of Father Juan Crespi's diary, penned
during a 1769 expedition led by Spanish explorer Gaspar de Portola.</TE>
<TE>   A generation later, the area acquired the name that stuck for 200
years when the San Fernando Mission was established in 1797. It was
named for Ferdinand III, a 13th-century Spanish king who,
appropriately enough, favored low taxes for his subjects. He was
canonized in 1671.</TE>
<TE>   These days, Valley VOTE must steer clear of classic branding
pitfalls such as bestowing a name that holds unintended meaning,
Kassarjian said.</TE>
<TE>   That means no naming the Valley after some historic figure, he
cautioned. ("Who knows," Kassarjian mused, "maybe the guy [Ferdinand
III] was mean to the Indians, and then it becomes a whole political
issue.")</TE>
<TE>   Kassarjian also vetoed the perky "Valley of the Stars," on the
grounds that it projects a certain airy aura, unbecoming what would
be the nation's sixth-largest city. ("People will call it Glitter
Gulch, all shine and no substance.")</TE>
<TE>   Richard Close, chairman of Valley VOTE, says many locals have
suggested borrowing a page from Staples Center's playbook. Staples,
the office superstore chain, paid $100 million to emblazon its name
on Los Angeles' downtown arena. Might the Valley's own Universal
Studios consider a Valleywide deal?</TE>
<TE>   Imagine it: "Universal City," population 1.4 million, stretching
from the tile roofs of West Hills to the gravel pits of Sun Valley.
Would that make Ventura Boulevard the new Universal CityWalk?</TE>
<TE>   Never mind that most of Universal City is not even part of Los
Angeles--it's unincorporated county land.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, 'Universal City' is an attractive name," Close said. "It's
a well-known name already. It's synonymous with entertainment, and
entertainment is an important part of the Valley. And they may be
willing to assist us with the campaign."</TE>
<TE>   Universal Studios, which has not taken a position on secession,
was notably less enthusiastic.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not support the idea because the name 'Universal City' is
specific to our property as a branded destination and is very closely
associated with our business," said Iris Gelt, vice president of
external communications. "Using the name 'Universal City' to
represent a broader area of the Valley would create confusion in the
mind of the public."</TE>
<TE>   Well, then.</TE>
<TE>   Cute North Lemon View Forest Bog, anyone?</TE>

<HD>Protesters Rally Over Cutting of 40 Oaks to Make Way for
Dam</HD>
<DH>Thousand Oaks: Dozens turn out to bemoan the loss of
ancient trees in the path of Lang Ranch project, after bid to stop
removal fails in court.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Waving placards in a howling wind and chanting various rallying
cries, several dozen people turned out Sunday in Thousand Oaks to
protest the removal of 40 ancient oak trees sitting in the path of a
proposed $5-million dam.</LD>
<LD>   The afternoon rally on Westlake Boulevard was held at a trailhead
about 200 yards from where Ventura County work crews on Saturday
trimmed the limbs off a dozen oaks.</LD>
<LD>   Cutting will resume at 7 this morning.</LD>
<TE>   "It's an emotional time and I understand that, but we have a job
to do too," said Hugh Clabaugh, a Ventura County engineer for flood
control design and construction.</TE>
<TE>   The marchers at the rally included members of the Save Lang Oaks
Fund, which is fighting to stop the dam, and several bird and tree
lovers.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to raise concerns and point a finger, and say shame on
[Ventura County]," said Gerry Langer, a homeowner in the neighboring
Lang Ranch community and the director of the oaks fund.</TE>
<TE>   Langer's group lost a bid Friday to prevent the tree removal, but
it has filed a lawsuit to block the dam.</TE>
<TE>   Its members oppose the dam because they believe the structure will
make surrounding hillsides where homeowners live more susceptible to
landslides.</TE>
<TE>   County officials contend that the project poses no such danger.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, county officials say the proposed Lang Ranch dam is
necessary to protect the Conejo Valley from flooding in the event of
a massive storm.</TE>
<TE>   Langer shouted through a bullhorn at passing motorists while
fellow protesters gripped homemade signs with such slogans as
"Arborcide Here."</TE>
<TE>   "This whole dam is being built on a sinking dam of lies," said Jan
Osterhaven of Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Several passing motorists honked their horns in support.</TE>
<TE>   Camarillo resident Penny Burley said she attended the protest
because the thought of oak trees being replaced by a concrete dam
made her angry and frustrated.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have chained myself to a tree but it's too late," Burley
said.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Ventura County Superior Court Judge Thomas J. Hutchins,
in rejecting the Save Lang Oaks Fund's request for a preliminary
injunction to stop the dam's construction, said the group's lawsuit
has little chance of prevailing.</TE>

<HD>Irish McCalla, 73; Actress Played TV's 'Sheena, Queen of
the Jungle'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Irish McCalla, the voluptuous actress best remembered for bringing
the comic book Tarzan-like heroine "Sheena, Queen of the Jungle" to
television in the 1950s, has died. She was 73.</LD>
<LD>   McCalla, who became an artist in her later years, died Feb. 1 in a
Tucson, Ariz., nursing home of complications following a stroke and
her fourth brain tumor.</LD>
<LD>   "Sheena," the unusual action series about a female superhero in an
era when women were expected to raise children and bake cookies, ran
26 episodes in 1956.</LD>
<TE>   But that TV series, shot in the Mexican jungle and far more
successful than a 1984 motion picture remake, has been so replayed
around the world that McCalla remained popular at superhero
conventions until her death.</TE>
<TE>   "That was amazing," she said after sitting out such appearances
for 15 years and then reluctantly attending the SuperCon gathering in
Anaheim in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   "People of all ages were coming up to me, telling me things about
myself that I'd completely forgotten," she said.</TE>
<TE>   And yes, she told ever-inquiring fans, she could still fit into
Sheena's trademark leopard skin minidress, and did so for photographs
as recently as 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike some forgotten superheroes, McCalla never built a life
around such conventions, and quipped that when she tired of signing
autographs, "I'd get up and say, 'Sheena not used to civilization.'"</TE>
<TE>   At 5-foot-9 1/2, McCalla was so tall her studio could never find
look-alike female stunt doubles. So she did her own vine-swinging and
tree-climbing with her pet chimp, Chim. That is, until she
miscalculated one approaching tree as she clung to her swinging vine
and crashed into it, smashing a knee. After that, the producers hired
male stunt men, dressed in leopard skin and wearing blond wigs.</TE>
<TE>   As one of eight children, McCalla grew up in various places across
the country, mostly in Pawnee City, Nev., and moved on her own to
Santa Monica--"where it was warm"--when she was 17. Her first job was
in an aircraft assembly factory making 80 cents a day.</TE>
<TE>   Always an athletic tomboy, McCalla gravitated quickly to
skin-diving and inevitably was spotted by a photographer who asked if
she would pose for pictures as Miss Navy Day. "Sure," she said, "why
not," and on Oct. 27, 1948, joined the mayor to officially welcome
the aircraft carrier Boxer and the Navy's largest amphibian plane,
the Carolina Mars, to Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Next came modeling--and the attention of painter Arturo Vargas,
king of the pinups, who captured her as a Vargas Girl. Born on
Christmas Day, she posed nude for the December page in a Vargas
calendar.</TE>
<TE>   McCalla liked to joke that Nassour Studios discovered her and cast
her as Sheena after finding her tossing a spear on Malibu Beach.
Actually, it was another photographer who got her the job when the
preferred candidate, Anita Ekberg, failed to show up for work.</TE>
<TE>   The young woman, who had her first painting in an Omaha museum at
14, still considered art her primary interest but, as she told The
Times in 1978, "acting was supporting me at the time." The Sheena
series, she said, paid $365 a week, plus thousands of dollars for
each personal appearance in the mid-1950s.</TE>
<TE>   McCalla took acting lessons later, but said Sheena so typecast her
that "it was almost impossible to get another job." She did act in a
handful of B movies, including "She Demons," "This Rebel Age," "Five
Gates to Hell," "Five Bold Women" and "Hands of a Stranger," and
appeared on a few TV shows.</TE>
<TE>   At the peak of her Sheena popularity, McCalla went through the
first of two divorces. Married to insurance man Patrick H. McIntyre
in 1951, she sought divorce in 1957, claiming he scolded her for
failing to be the high-living consort her screen image might imply.</TE>
<TE>   "He called me a 'pooper,'" she told a judge. "He told hosts and
guests at a party we attended, 'I don't want to be a party pooper,
but mamma wants to go home.'"</TE>
<TE>   She later was married to English actor John Patrick Horgan, but
that marriage also ended in divorce after five years.</TE>
<TE>   McCalla made painting her official profession after a bout with
cancer in 1970. She painted Western scenes in oil, and converted many
canvases to limited-edition plates and prints. Working with her
sister, Flo Tugwell, she marketed the art through her McCalla
Enterprises Inc.</TE>
<TE>   McCalla is survived by two sons, Kim and Sean McIntyre; two
brothers; three sisters; and two granddaughters.</TE>

<HD>Financial Jam Mires O.C.'s Toll Highway</HD>
<DH>Transportation: Rosy predictions were hurt by slow economy,
lack of drivers. The system teeters on economic edge as officials
seek a cure.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Traffic consultants for the San Joaquin Hills toll road, which runs
through one of the wealthiest swaths of coastal California, were
effusive back in 1992 when they prepared to sell $1.2 billion in
bonds to finance the turnpike.</LD>
<LD>   The tollway, they predicted, would average about 94,500 motorists
a day within a year of its opening--more than enough to pay expenses
and interest on the project's enormous debt.</LD>
<LD>   A decade later, the sky is not so blue.</LD>
<TE>   The 15-mile tollway, which opened in late 1996, has failed to live
up to its traffic and revenue projections. As of December, an average
of 72,000 motorists traveled the road each day, well short of the
1992 forecast or even a revised, more conservative, estimate issued
in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "It remains a hard sell," said Michael McNally, an engineering
professor at UC Irvine's Institute for Transportation Studies. "It
doesn't surprise me that they are having problems. The road was
premature."</TE>
<TE>   Now, with a Wall Street rating firm reducing the highway's bond
rating to "junk" status, the toll road authority has been going about
the sobering business of revisiting its finances. The CEO for the
toll agency said he fears the road could be in technical default
within five years, a financial path that has put other toll roads
across the nation in financial peril.</TE>
<TE>   All this comes as tolls on the road are being raised to $3 a trip,
a move that could generate new revenue or drive away customers.</TE>
<TE>   The scenario for technical default is real, according to Walter D.
Kreutzen, chief executive officer for the Transportation Corridor
Agencies. He said bondholders were promised that the toll road would
earn $1.30 for every dollar of debt. The ratio was offered as a
margin of security for investors.</TE>
<TE>   If the toll agency fails to maintain that ratio--which Kreutzen
said is very possible--that financial covenant with investors will be
broken. "It is not good," Kreutzen said, "to be in any kind of
default."</TE>
<TE>   Failing to meet the requirement does not mean that bondholders
won't receive their interest payments. The declining margin, however,
is a substantial warning of increased risk and serious financial
problems for the toll road.</TE>
<TE>   The slower-than-expected traffic growth on the toll road had
already prompted two of three Wall Street rating agencies to
downgrade more than $1 billion in corridor bonds to the lowest
investment grade. Last week, Fitch IBCA went a step further and
kicked its rating down to speculative grade, or so-called junk bond
status.</TE>
<TE>   The San Joaquin Hills tollway, which runs from Newport Beach to
north of San Juan Capistrano, is part of a 51-mile network of toll
roads built and operated by the Transportation Corridor Agencies.
Each of the network's two corridors--the San Joaquin and the
Foothill-Eastern--has its own board of directors and financial
obligations.</TE>
<TE>   The San Joaquin Hills tollway has long been the problem child of
the family. Transportation analysts blame its low ridership on
factors that have hampered similar toll-road projects across the
country: lower-than-expected population growth, recessions and
competing public highways.</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego Freeway and Interstate 5, they say, remain viable
options for drivers who might not want to spend as much as $3 to
shave 10 to 15 minutes from a peak-hour trip.</TE>
<TE>   Both freeways, which run through central Orange County, have been
steadily improved over the years, including elimination of the
notorious congestion at the El Toro Y. The dreaded interchange
linking the two freeways has been completely rebuilt and widened.</TE>
<TE>   From an economic standpoint, the San Joaquin Hills toll road has
been battered by two recessions since it opened, slowing growth in
Orange County and particularly in the area served by the tollway.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1997 report, traffic consultants Wilbur Smith Associates
concluded that traffic growth was hurt by a significant economic
downturn in Orange County and the rest of Southern California during
the early to mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers said the recession delayed increases in employment in
Orange County for at least six years and somewhat longer along the
San Joaquin Hills corridor.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the toll road opened, the Smith report stated,
employment levels in the project area were still lower than they had
been in 1990 and about 21% less than had been forecast for 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "The 5 and 405 are very viable alternatives and the growth in
housing and commercial development has not occurred as rapidly as
thought," said Kia Mortazavi, manager of planning for the Orange
County Transportation Authority.</TE>
<TE>   Professor Recommended a Smaller Highway</TE>
<TE>   Peter Fielding, a professor at UC Irvine's Institute of
Transportation Studies, predicted in the mid-1990s that the San
Joaquin Hills would encounter financial difficulties because of a
lack of motorists for such a large highway. He said a smaller
four-lane road would have accommodated growth for many years as long
as tolls were raised and lowered based on demand.</TE>
<TE>   "This advice was rejected," Fielding said.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the San Joaquin Hills will default on its bond is unclear.
But if it does, it will not be the only tollway in the nation to have
suffered severe financial setbacks.</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago Skyway defaulted on its bonds for about 10 years
before it finally recovered in the mid-1980s. During that time, the
tollway stopped paying interest to bondholders. The Chesapeake Bay
Tunnel went into default as well in the late 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the Garcon Point Bridge, east of Pensacola, Fla., is on the
brink of default on its bonds. The $100-million project includes a
31/2-mile long bridge and more than seven miles of connecting roads.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Samuel, editor of Toll Roads Newsletter, based in Maryland,
said some of these operations recovered and resumed paying interest
to bondholders.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of these roads depended on development for their success,"
Samuel said. "But the expected development often takes a lot longer
than the boosters say it will."</TE>
<TE>   Many Forecasts Fell Short</TE>
<TE>   Forecasts by Wilbur Smith Associates had originally called for
94,500 riders a day on the San Joaquin Hills toll road during the
first year of operations. But by spring, six months after its grand
opening, the tollway was averaging only 48,250.</TE>
<TE>   Toll officials predicted the shortfall would not hurt the
corridor's ability to meet expenses and pay the interest on its
bonds. They also predicted the gap would disappear within a year.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't.</TE>
<TE>   From July 1998 to June 1999, projections called for the road to
earn almost $51 million in toll revenue from 28.5 million riders. But
it actually collected $42.6 million from 24.8 million transactions.</TE>
<TE>   The latest available figures indicate that the gap is widening.
For the first six months of fiscal year 2001-02, projected revenue
was about $37 million from 18.5 million riders. The actual revenue
was $28 million from 13.2 million riders.</TE>
<TE>   If trends continue, the toll revenue for the current fiscal year
might be about $56 million from 26.5 million motorists. The
projections call for almost $73 million in revenue from 37 million
drivers.</TE>
<TE>   The question facing corridor officials is whether revenue can keep
pace with the road's debt payments, which increase every year for the
life of the bonds. The debt service is scheduled to go up from $46.7
million in January 2003 to $186 million in 2034.</TE>
<TE>   Kreutzen said he is confident that the San Joaquin Hills can meet
its financial obligations until 2007. There is a cash reserve of $140
million and a $12-million federal line of credit, which expires in
five years. The toll agency also has been cutting its administrative
costs to save money.</TE>
<TE>   To help pay the debt service, the corridor agency already has used
a $36-million infusion of cash from the settlements of lawsuits
related to the Orange County bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Today, transportation officials are considering ways to refinance
the tollway, including a merger of the two boards that govern the San
Joaquin Hills, the Foothill and the Eastern turnpikes. Bond rating
reports show that the transportation authority is considering
refinancing the outstanding bonds of all three toll roads. Revenue
would be combined to cover the annual debt service of the unified
system.</TE>
<TE>   The Foothill and the Eastern tollways are the healthiest of the
three highways, with ridership running ahead of projections by about
8%. Bond rating agencies that evaluate the agencies' debt have
described the economic outlook of the two turnpikes as stable.</TE>

<HD>Ravens' Lewis Is Hired as Redskin Coordinator</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marvin Lewis will have a new job next season, after all.</LD>
<LD>   Two days after the Tampa Bay Buccaneers backed out of making him
their coach, Lewis on Sunday agreed to become defensive coordinator
of the Washington Redskins.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement came one day after Lewis said he would remain
defensive coordinator of the Baltimore Ravens, a post he has held
since the team moved from Cleveland before the 1996 season.</LD>
<TE>   Although terms of Lewis' deal with the Redskins were not
disclosed, his contract is believed to be around $850,000 plus
incentives, which, if met, would make him the highest-paid assistant
in the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, money talks louder than words, and this is an
opportunity Marvin felt he had to take," Raven owner Art Modell said
in a statement. "I'm disappointed that whoever misled us about Marvin
staying did that to the Ravens."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis is partially to blame. He told the Ravens on Saturday that
he would stay with the team.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm tired of putting my family through this," he said. "My family
is happy with the area."</TE>
<TE>   His contract with the Ravens had expired, and he was expected to
discuss terms of a new deal with Modell over the next couple of
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore will make receivers coach Mike Nolan the team's
defensive coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   The move will be formally announced today in a news conference,
team spokesman Kevin Byrne said.</TE>
<TE>   New England Patriot running back Kevin Faulk was jailed after
police in Lafayette, La., said he became verbally abusive when told
not to move a traffic barricade.</TE>
<TE>   Faulk disputes the charges, attorney Jason Robideaux said. He said
Faulk's passenger moved a barricade and Faulk's wife became
belligerent while Faulk behaved.</TE>
<TE>   "[Faulk] told his wife to call me, and for her to be quiet and go
home," Robideaux said.</TE>
<TE>   Faulk was free on $450 bond.</TE>
<TE>   He was arrested about 3:30 a.m. Saturday in a parking lot, which
was partly barricaded.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Faulk removed a barricade so he could drive off and
when a policewoman stopped him, Faulk allegedly used "vulgar and
inappropriate language."</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago Bears and defensive coordinator Greg Blache agreed on
a three-year contract.</TE>
<TE>   College Football</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas defensive coordinator John Thompson was hired to run the
defense at Florida, Gator Coach Ron Zook said.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson teaches an aggressive style of defense.</TE>
<TE>   The Razorbacks held Oklahoma to 10 points in the Jan. 1 Cotton
Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball</TE>
<TE>   Pitcher Shawn Estes and the New York Mets agreed on a one-year
contract worth $6.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Estes was obtained in December from the San Francisco Giants for
outfielder Tsuyoshi Shinjo and infielder Desi Relaford.</TE>
<TE>   The left-hander was 9-8 with a 4.02 earned-run average last
season.</TE>
<TE>   Soccer</TE>
<TE>   Fernando Morientes scored five goals--and missed a penalty kick
that would have made it six--to lead Real Madrid past Las Palmas,
7-0, and into first place in the Spanish League. Morientes leads the
league with 15 goals.... Manchester United beat Charlton, 2-0, to
regain first place in the English Premier League.... Second-place
Juventus tied first-place AS Roma, 0-0, in the Italian league. Roma
extended its unbeaten streak to 19 games.... Toluca defeated
Guadalajara, 3-0, to remain the only unbeaten team six weeks into
Mexican summer league play.</TE>

race.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs, 38, of Oakland, won the women's 4-kilometer race.</TE>
<TE>   Hockey</TE>
<TE>   The Ice Dogs rallied twice from one-goal deficits at the Long
Beach Arena before suffering their second consecutive loss, 3-2, to

<TE>   Idaho's Bobby Stewart recorded the game-winning goal at 17:39 of
the third period.</TE>

<HD>Kobe Drives Points Home</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: He scores 31 (Iverson scores five), wins
MVP award and is booed by hometown fans in West's 135-120 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Supposedly all grown up, Kobe Bryant returned to his hometown seeking
approval, perhaps even a measure of forgiveness. But there were no
open arms in the City of Brotherly Love, and he left with only
hardware and heartache.</LD>
<LD>   The Laker guard dominated the NBA All-Star game, leading the
winning West team with 31 points, outplaying every nemesis from
Michael Jordan to Allen Iverson to Tracy McGrady, and winning the
most valuable player award.</LD>
<LD>   But he didn't get the last word. The populace that lost Bryant out
of high school and whose 76ers lost the NBA championship to the
Lakers last year enjoyed that honor.</LD>
<TE>   And the word was "Boo."</TE>
<TE>   Catcalls started slowly, unlike Bryant, who scored 12 points in
the first quarter of the West's 135-120 victory Sunday night at First
Union Center.</TE>
<TE>   Somebody yelled, "Pass the ball, Kobe," from the rafters and boos
increased with every shot, which were many. Bryant took 16 in the
first half, nine more than anyone else on either team, but nine went
in and he had 23 points as the West lead grew to 72-55.</TE>
<TE>   Which also contributed to the foul mood of the sellout crowd of
19,581. The East played poorly and so did the players these fans came
to cheer.</TE>
<TE>   Iverson, Philly's adopted son, had no impact, scoring five points
in 25 minutes. Jordan, back after a self-imposed three-year hiatus,
missed nine of 13 shots, including a wide-open dunk that left him
with the sheepish grin of someone whose age is showing.</TE>
<TE>   And Bryant played brilliantly, adding eight points and three
assists in the third quarter as the West lead grew to 100-77.</TE>
<TE>   The boos grew louder every time he touched the leather.</TE>
<TE>   He had ambushed the All-Star game just the way he planned, but
Philly fans ambushed his emotions. He hadn't planned on that.</TE>
<TE>   "I was pretty upset, pretty hurt," he said. "My first game here in
the NBA, my rookie year, they booed me too. And that really hurt,
because it was like my homecoming. That was very, very hurtful."</TE>
<TE>   So he helps the Lakers to an NBA title on this court, and eight
months later believes everyone will turn the page and welcome him as
the prodigal son returning?</TE>
<TE>   Apparently his maturation is not far enough along for him to
realize homecoming doesn't happen on his terms.</TE>
<TE>   Too bad, because he was having such a great time.</TE>
<TE>   "I had like five cheesesteaks," he said. "I was sick the first
night because I ate too many."</TE>
<TE>   He visited friends and swung by his old high school, Lower Merion,
peeking in the locker room "just to see if it smells the same." He
wanted to feel at home, to open the refrigerator, guzzle milk from
the carton and have everyone chuckle at that crazy Kobe.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't work with these people. The unsuspecting, self-absorbed
Bryant was a prime target.</TE>
<TE>   "That reaction is something beyond my understanding," West center
Tim Duncan of the San Antonio Spurs said. "He put on a show for the
fans and that is what this game is all about."</TE>
<TE>   Even Iverson empathized.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd think people would say, 'What if that was their kid,' but
they didn't," he said. "I felt real bad. At a happy moment you just
want to enjoy it. By booing, it took a lot from him."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant sat most of the fourth quarter, his teammates making sure
the East would not repeat the stirring late comeback it made in last
year's game. Gary Payton of the Seattle SuperSonics scored all 18 of
his points in the second half for the West, including 11 in the
fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The East made only two brief surges, one keyed by McGrady in the
second quarter, the other a 13-point run to begin the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   In only his second All-Star game, McGrady, the 22-year-old Orlando
Magic forward, topped the highlight reel with a second-quarter dunk.
He dribbled up in transition, threw the ball against the backboard,
leaped, caught and dunked it in one ferocious motion.</TE>
<TE>   "I did that numerous times in high school and wanted to try it at
the NBA level," he said. "Dirk [Nowitzki] bit on the lob and I threw
it down.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely think the dunks in today's game could have won the
slam-dunk contest."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan's failed effort notwithstanding. McGrady, who led the East
with 24 points, did his best to cover for his 38-year-old East
teammate.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why everybody is tripping because he missed a dunk,
everybody misses dunks," he said. "It's just not the same MJ he was
when he could put his hips up to the rim."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan played 22 minutes, scoring nine points. The single
embarrassing moment overshadowed all.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a while since I've been in that circumstance, and the
wheels start turning," he said. "I start trying to figure out, well
what will you do? And at the last minute, you think, well, just dunk
it.</TE>
<TE>   "As you get older, you just don't have the same type of
confidence. You've got to go through a checklist. And I went through
the checklist and by the time I was ready to dunk the ball, I wasn't
there."</TE>
<TE>   Everyone, it seemed, had a good time except the player who put on
the best show.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant was the obvious MVP choice, and boos rained again after a
public-address announcement that the ceremony would begin a few
minutes after the game. Don Nelson, the West coach, had only a moment
to speak to Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Don't take it personal, they wish they had you,'" Nelson
said. "'Forget about it. Who cares if they boo you?' They were having
some fun."</TE>
<TE>   Was Bryant, or was he just the target of fun? He'll sort it out.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll use it as motivation," he said. "I'm the type of person
where if something occurs in my life that's hurtful, I'm only going
to let it hurt me for so long. I'm going to turn it around and use
it."</TE>

<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Even if he hoped to get here sooner and began to wonder what it would
take, Elton Brand made his All-Star debut Sunday, scoring six points
and taking 10 rebounds in 19 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   The first Clipper to appear in the game since Danny Manning in
1994, he said he was overjoyed.</LD>
<LD>   He also admitted it would have hurt to miss another one.</LD>
<TE>   "It definitely hurt," he said. "I'd see all the festivities and
all the fun the guys would be having. I'd be, 'Oh, I don't want to
see that.' ...</TE>
<TE>   "I just felt like it'll come, my time will come. And it's an honor
that it came now.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been here on the baby level, the Rookie Challenge two years.
On the adult level, it's a lot of fun. It's different."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Joy Nelson, recovering from breast cancer, joined her husband,
Don, on the bench late in the game.</TE>
<TE>   "It was fun," Don said. "She doesn't get to tell her story very
much to the television audience and I think it's an important story.
Early detection saved her life. She preached early mammograms and
took them and as a result, it saved her life. And same with me. Early
detection saved my life.</TE>
<TE>   "I had cancer about a year ago and thank God that we follow our
message ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Maybe he should have put it another way: Boston's Paul Pierce,
asked what happened to the East: "Kevin Garnett at the three [small
forward] spot, killed [Michael] Jordan. That hurt us."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Heisler</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Playing only 16 minutes might have upset some All-Stars, but
Alonzo Mourning of the East team appreciated every one.</TE>
<TE>   The 32-year-old Miami Heat center was voted to start last year's
game, but he could not play because of a serious kidney ailment that
forced him to miss all but 13 games of the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   Mourning's comeback has been astounding--he is among league
leaders in blocked shots and field-goal percentage. And he made the
most of his time in the All-Star game, making six of seven shots for
13 points and grabbing three rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "The weekend was a blast," he said. "Just watching little kids
having a good time and seeing the smiles on their faces because they
are around players they look up to makes it worthwhile."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former UCLA guard Baron Davis was a late add to the East team,
taking the place of the injured Vince Carter.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, a third-year player with the Charlotte Hornets, had five
assists and two points in 13 minutes, and left with a keepsake--he
had his teammates sign his jersey.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The West's 13 three-point baskets and 30 attempts set All-Star
game records, breaking marks of 12 and 29 set by the East in 1997.
Gary Payton made four three-pointers for the West and Peja Stojakovic
had three. Ray Allen made three for the East.</TE>

<LD>Redondo Union, Encino Crespi and Los Angeles Price are the only teams
that can defend Southern Section boys' basketball titles in the same
divisions as last season in the wake of realignment for the
enrollment-based playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   Price, the top-seeded team in Division V-A, probably has the best
chance among the three defending champions. The Knights are seeking a
fourth consecutive section title.</LD>
<LD>   Redondo Union, which last season won its first title since 1943,
is seeded third in Division II-A.</LD>
<TE>   Crespi is a longshot to repeat in Division IV-AA after finishing
fourth in the Mission League and posting a sub-500 overall record.</TE>
<TE>   Glendora won the Division I-AA crown last season but now plays in
Division I-A. The Tartans are one of six defending champions
displaced from the divisions they won in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   A division-by-division preview:</TE>
<TE>   DIVISION I-AA</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion: Glendora.</TE>
<TE>   Seeded teams: 1. Rialto Eisenhower (23-2), 2. Long Beach Poly
(23-3), 3. Fontana Miller (21-6), 4. Oxnard (22-4).</TE>
<TE>   Dark horse: Mission Viejo Capistrano Valley (21-6). The Cougars
advanced to the finals last year as an unseeded team and could do it
again.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: This bracket should hold true to form, pitting Eisenhower
and Poly in the finals. The Eagles defeated the Jackrabbits in
December, and Poly Coach Ron Palmer concedes that his team has had
difficulty as players tried to do too much in big games. Eisenhower
has struggled against the press, but the Eagles and Jackrabbits
possess top-notch frontcourt players.</TE>
<TE>   DIVISION I-A</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion: Santa Ana Mater Dei.</TE>
<TE>   Seeded teams: 1. Mission Viejo (24-2), 2. Glendora (24-2), 3.
Thousand Oaks (23-3), 4. Los Angeles Loyola (22-3).</TE>
<TE>   Dark horse: Los Alamitos (16-10). The Griffins played a tough
schedule and defeated Mission Viejo, Capistrano Valley and Thousand
Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: This division is ripe for upsets, considering the top two
seeds have lost to teams they should have beaten. Look for at least
one "no-name" team to advance to the semifinals or finals.</TE>
<TE>   DIVISION II-AA</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion: Compton Dominguez.</TE>
<TE>   Seeded teams: 1. Mater Dei (22-4), 2. Pasadena (22-4), 3. Villa
Park (24-3), 4. Corona Centennial (22-3).</TE>
<TE>   Dark horse: Newport Harbor (19-6). The Sailors won the Sea View
League title in convincing fashion.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Mater Dei is playing so well that it should breeze
through the section's toughest division. The Monarchs don't face a
potential stumbling block until the semifinals, where they could meet
Centennial. Inglewood's DeAngelo Collins could present some matchup
problems for Mater Dei if the Sentinels get past Villa Park and
Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   DIVISION II-A</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion: Redondo Union.</TE>
<TE>   Seeded teams: 1. Riverside King (24-3), 2. Santa Margarita (20-4),
3. Redondo Union (19-6), 4. Elsinore (22-5).</TE>
<TE>   Dark horse: La Habra Sonora (17-10). The Raiders are better than
their third-place finish in the Freeway League, as evidenced by their
recent 17-point thrashing of Corona Centennial.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Any of the top four seeds are capable of winning the
title, but hard-nosed point guard Marvin Lea (23.5 points per game)
may give King a slight edge. Santa Margarita is the most
battle-tested team, having played in the Serra League and beaten City
power Fairfax.</TE>
<TE>   DIVISION III-AA</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion: None. (Torrance Bishop Montgomery won the
Division III title but there weren't any subdivisions.)</TE>
<TE>   Seeded teams: 1. Lakewood Artesia (18-6), 2. Lakewood Mayfair
(19-7), 3. Palm Desert (22-4), 4. La Puente Bishop Amat (20-6).</TE>
<TE>   Dark horse: Compton Dominguez (14-11). The Dons, winners of three
consecutive state titles, will be dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Artesia has completed its recovery from the
scandal-ridden 1999-2000 season in two years under Coach Scott Pera,
who won a state title at Annville-Cleona (Pa.) High in 1999. The
Pioneers will be tough to beat thanks to a lineup that includes four
players who average double figures in scoring..</TE>
<TE>   DIVISION III-A</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion: None.</TE>
<TE>   Seeded teams: 1. Compton Centennial (25-0), 2. Bishop Montgomery
(20-6), 3. La Canada (22-4), 4. Pasadena Muir (21-5).</TE>
<TE>   Dark horse: Pomona Ganesha (23-4). Michael Efevberha is capable of
scoring 50 in a game.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Considering Muir's recent struggles, Centennial should
plow ahead unscathed into the finals, where it likely would meet
Bishop Montgomery. The Knights' Fred Washington (21.5 points) could
keep things interesting before Darius Sanders, Gabriel Pruitt and
Sterling Byrd help the Apaches pull away.</TE>
<TE>   DIVISION IV-AA</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion: Crespi.</TE>
<TE>   Seeded teams: 1. El Segundo (23-4), 2. North Hollywood
Harvard-Westlake (21-5), 3. Rosamond (20-4), 4. West Hills Chaminade
(20-6).</TE>
<TE>   Dark horse: Pasadena La Salle (19-5). The Lancers beat a tough
L.A. Murphy team twice en route to the Santa Fe League title.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Rosamond was the only seeded team to win its league, but
the Roadrunners are likely to be outmuscled by El Segundo or
Harvard-Westlake. Dashawn Strong and Jeramie Hopson lead the Eagles,
while Bryce Taylor (21.8 points) is a force for the Wolverines.</TE>
<TE>   DIVISION IV-A</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion: Santa Monica Crossroads.</TE>
<TE>   Seeded teams: 1. Los Angeles Verbum Dei (23-3), 2. Downey Calvary
Chapel (22-4), 3. Gardena Serra (23-3), 4. Van Nuys Montclair Prep
(13-11).</TE>
<TE>   Dark horse: Malibu Kilpatrick (19-4). The Mustangs won the Alpha
League and could give Serra a run in the quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Verbum Dei defeated Calvary Chapel when the teams met
three weeks ago, but Grizzly Coach Mark Berokoff likes his chances in
a rematch. And why not? Calvary Chapel's guard tandem of Tim Drisdom
and Ralph Miley can play with anyone when their shots are falling.</TE>
<TE>   DIVISION V-AA</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion: Downey Calvary Chapel.</TE>
<TE>   Seeded teams: 1. Palos Verdes Estates Rolling Hills Prep (15-6),
2. L.A. Ribet Academy (16-8), 3. Oxnard Santa Clara (14-8), 4. Apple
Valley Christian (21-1)</TE>
<TE>   Dark horse: Sherman Oaks Buckley (18-5). Scrappy guard David Gale
was averaging 8.8 assists and 6.4 steals per game as of last week.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Rolling Hills Prep, which has defeated Ribet Academy this
season in two of three meetings, should roll into the finals behind a
trio of sophomores. Forward Curtis Allen (25 points, 11 rebounds) and
guards D.J. Wright (10 points, 11 assists) and Jason Daley (13
points) will present matchup difficulties for all comers. Ribet's
hopes rest on the shoulders of forward Chris Booker.</TE>
<TE>   DIVISION V-A</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion: Price.</TE>
<TE>   Seeded teams: 1. Price (22-6), 2. Tarzana Stoneridge Prep (20-5),
3. Arcadia Rio Hondo Prep (14-8), 4. Lancaster Antelope Valley
Christian (15-8).</TE>
<TE>   Dark horse: Irvine Tarbut V'Torah (15-7). Coach Patrick Roberts
always has his teams prepared.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Led by guard Derrick Williams and forward Oscar Edwards,
Price hasn't lost a game on the hardwood since being defeated by
Verbum Dei on Jan. 5. The Knights forfeited their final two Harbor
League games after it was determined they had scheduled too many
games.</TE>

<LD>PLAYOFF POSSIBILITIES</LD>
<LD>   * Inglewood vs. Villa Park, Division II-AA quarterfinals. Spartan
big men Brice Prather and Sean Phaler would have their hands full
with Sentinel center DeAngelo Collins.</LD>
<LD>   * Redondo Beach Redondo Union vs. Santa Margarita, Division II-A
semifinals. A battle of fast-paced teams.</LD>
<TE>   * Compton Dominguez vs. Lakewood Mayfair, Division III-AA
quarterfinals. Could the Dons' tradition--and a big-time game from
guard Keion Kindred--help them unseat the No. 2 seed?</TE>
<TE>   * Gardena Serra vs. Downey Calvary Chapel, Division IV-A
semifinals. These teams were on a collision course to meet earlier in
the season before Serra lost to Los Angeles Price in Calvary Chapel's
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   WORST MATCHUP</TE>
<TE>   * Santa Ana Mater Dei vs. Hemet, Division II-AA first round. No
offense to the 11-12 Bulldogs, but they will need a lot more bite to
prevent the Monarchs from giving Coach Gary McKnight his 600th career
victory.</TE>
<TE>   TANTALIZING TIDBITS</TE>
<TE>   * All 57 teams that petitioned the Southern Section to receive
entry into the playoffs under the 11-win rule were admitted. Five
teams that were eligible to petition--Long Beach Jordan, Santa Ana
Foothill, Alhambra Keppel, Whittier La Serna and Murrieta Calvary
Chapel--did not.</TE>
<TE>   * Santa Margarita and Mayfair, seeded second in Division II-A and
Division III-AA, respectively, did not receive first-round byes like
the third- and fourth-seeded teams in their divisions because they
finished second in their league.</TE>
<TE>   * Glendora Coach Mike LeDuc could face any one of three former
assistants--Rowland Heights Rowland's Gordon Hamlow, Riverside Poly's
Yancy Dodson and San Bernardino San Gorgonio's Ty Stockham--in the
Division I-A semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   * Orange (13-13), which went 0-10 in the Century League and has
not won a game since Dec. 29, plays host to Katella (12-13) in a
Division II-AA wild-card game.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Georgia basketball Coach Jim Harrick on a Southeastern Conference
teleconference, was asked what's the key to winning the close games.</LD>
<LD>   "I asked that very same question to John Wooden," Harrick
recalled, "and he pondered for a long time, and he said, 'Jim, I
never expected to be in that situation.'"</LD>
<LD>   And that's why he was known as the Wizard of Westwood.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the career UCLA basketball record for most
points scored?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated: Buck Coach George Karl, on the possibility he would
leave Milwaukee: "I don't think anyone is going to pay me more money,
to be honest with you. So, why would I want to leave other than these
guys are driving me crazy."</TE>
<TE>   And this from Buck point guard Sam Cassell, after signing a
$17-million, three-year contract extension: "I play basketball, the
money doesn't matter. I'm still underpaid."</TE>
<TE>   Don't you feel sorry for him?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Opinion: Greg Cote in the Miami Herald: "If curling is a sport,
then guys who shovel snow off driveways for a living should be making
Michael Jordan money."</TE>
<TE>   * "Figure skating, whether solo or in pairs, is not a sport. It is
dancing on ice. It looks like what Gene Kelly was doing in musicals
40 years ago, except that Gene never wore fey sequins."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second guess: Dan Shaughnessy of the Boston Globe, needling John
Madden for suggesting during the Super Bowl that the Patriots should
have settled for a tie late in the fourth quarter to extend the game
into overtime: "When the networks projected Al Gore as the winner in
Florida, Madden no doubt suggested George Bush take a knee and run
again in 2004."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The broom team: Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle: "I
don't understand why the U.S. didn't recruit some witches for our
curling team."</TE>
<TE>   * "Security checkpoints would be a lot more tolerable if we could
invent a metal-detector wand that would also zap the wrinkles out of
pants and shirts."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Beware ... the Lakers! Mark Kreidler of the Sacramento Bee,
commenting on the Lakers: "Easiest team in the league to dismiss
right now because they're in the middle of their winter clown act,
losing twice to the silly Chicago Bulls, playing without Shaq and his
bum toe, lethargic for whole chunks of mind-numbing, life-sapping
game time.</TE>
<TE>   "And therein lies the treachery, of course. No close NBA watcher
takes the current Laker approach seriously.</TE>
<TE>   "Come season's end, O'Neal and [Kobe] Bryant will be back in their
championship trim, and despite a lesser cast around them this year,
they'll be good enough to pound their way into the conference
finals."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1970, the Atlanta Hawks set an NBA
record for most points scored in the third quarter with 54 against
San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Don MacLean, 2,608 points, 1989-1992.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Mitch Lawrence of the New York Daily News reporting
from the NBA All-Star game in Philadelphia: "A quick Philly story: A
reporter once made the mistake of asking World B. Free when he knew
his game-winning shot was going down: Said Free: 'It left my wrist
didn't it?'"</TE>

<LD>A consumer's guide to the best and worst of sports media and
merchandise. Ground rules: If it can be read, played, heard,

<LD>   What: "Muhammad Ali: Through the Eyes of the World" videotape and
DVD</LD>
<LD>   Producer: Universal Studios Home Video</LD>
<TE>   Price: $19.98 (DVD), $14.95 (tape)</TE>
<TE>   If you saw Michael Mann's film, "Ali," and were left with
questions about just who Muhammad Ali really is, this documentary may
help answer some of those questions. This isn't a slick, overblown,
expensive Hollywood production but rather a thorough, objective
documentary about a very complex person.</TE>
<TE>   This is real, "Ali" was not. This 104-minute documentary, which
hit video stores Jan. 29, offers real footage and dozens of
interviews as it follows Ali through his life, beginning with his
childhood in Louisville.</TE>
<TE>   There is so much to Ali's life, and this film manages to touch on
a little of everything. There is of course his boxing career, and
there is footage of most of his fights, although maybe not enough to
suit boxing fans.</TE>
<TE>   There was also his decision to join the Nation of Islam and change
his name from Cassius Clay, and this aspect of Ali is dealt with in
depth. This documentary overall does a better job than the film "Ali"
of delving into Ali's religious beliefs, political convictions and
his decision to refuse induction into the U.S. Army.</TE>
<TE>   Ali is presented as both a strong man who made his own decisions
and also a follower who could be easily influenced.</TE>
<TE>   Dick Schaap called him "malleable," adding, "If I had really tried
I think I could have converted him to Judaism."</TE>
<TE>   Interviews with Veronica Anderson, his third wife, and daughter
Hana Ali, help provide insight into his personal life.</TE>
<TE>   Ali has been married four times and has nine children. Ali was
known for his sexual promiscuity, and that facet of his life isn't
ignored. But on the other hand, as the documentary points out, he
divorced his first wife, Sonji, because she wore skirts that Ali
thought were too short and she liked to have a drink now and then.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to explain Muhammad Ali isn't easy, but this documentary
seems to come pretty close.</TE>

<HD>Next Foe Annoyed With U.S.</HD>

<DL>OKLAHOMA CITY</DL>
<LD>The biggest drama for the U.S. Davis Cup team Sunday involved its
next opponent. During James Blake's 4-6, 6-3, 6-0 win against late
substitute Ladislav Svarc, news emerged that Spain defeated Morocco.</LD>
<LD>   After the United States beat Slovakia, 5-0--Andy Roddick defeated
Karol Beck, 6-4, 7-6 (5), in the final match--Jeff Ryan, the USTA's
director of team events, spoke of trying a grass court indoors,
following what Australia did against France in last year's Davis Cup
final.</LD>
<LD>   Ryan mentioned Shreveport, La., as one possibility. Southern
California remains under consideration but is hurt by closeness to
the Indian Wells event. The match against Spain is April 5-7 and the
site and surface has to be selected by Feb. 25.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Spaniards remain upset about the American
withdrawal from the Fed Cup final last year in Madrid. The U.S.
pulled out because of security concerns. Spanish federation president
Agustin Pujol said there would not be a Spanish boycott of the
quarterfinal in retaliation.</TE>
<TE>   "We do want to be compensated for the economic loss," he told the
Spanish news agency EFE.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. captain Patrick McEnroe had not heard of a potential boycott,
saying: "That would certainly be disappointing. We certainly would
like them to come. We don't want a pass to the next round. We want to
play."</TE>
<TE>   In other Davis Cup competition, Australian Open champion Thomas
Johansson beat Greg Rusedski in four sets, completing Sweden's
comeback victory over Britain to reach the quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   In Birmingham, England, where Sweden entered the day trailing the
series, 2-1, Thomas Enqvist tied it by defeating Tim Henman, 6-4,
6-2, 6-4. Johansson then rallied to top Rusedski, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5, 6-4.</TE>
<TE>   Sweden next plays Russia, which got past Switzerland, 3-2, when
Australian Open finalist Marat Safin beat Michel Kratochvil, 6-1, 7-6
(6), 6-4, at Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   In Metz, France, Sebastien Grosjean created an insurmountable 3-1
lead by beating Sjeng Schalken of the Netherlands, 6-2, 1-6, 7-6 (6),
2-6, 6-3. France's next opponent is the Czech Republic.</TE>
<TE>   Goran Ivanisevic beat Rainer Schuettler, 6-4, 7-6 (4), 7-6 (5), to
help Croatia oust Germany and set up a quarterfinal with Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   Spain advanced when Morocco's Karim Alami quit during the deciding
fifth match while losing, 6-3, 6-0, to Alex Corretja. Alami received
treatment for a muscle injury.</TE>

<HD>A Fast Start for Stewart</HD>
<DH>Auto racing: He wins his second Shootout in a row, edging
Earnhardt Jr. NASCAR makes rules change to help Fords.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>There was something eerie about the finish of Sunday's Budweiser
Shootout at Daytona International Speedway. Tony Stewart won, just
like he did last year. And an Earnhardt was second, just like last
year.</LD>
<LD>   Only it was Dale Jr., not Dale, but don't tell that to Stewart.</LD>
<LD>   "I would have sworn that car behind me was black and had a '3' on
it because Dale Junior may have a 'Jr.' behind his name, but drives
like Dale Sr.," said Stewart, driver of the No. 20 Home Depot
Pontiac.</LD>
<TE>   "He's got all the talent in the world. It was an honor to run with
him. We were both good in practice and we knew if we could ever get
hooked up in the race, we could both get to the front. We proved it
twice. I was good behind him or in front of him, and he was good
behind me or in front of me, too."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart had a .172 second margin after 70 green-flag laps, with
Jeff Gordon inches back of Earnhardt, followed by Ken Schrader and
Sterling Marlin in a pack that had broken away from the rest of the
22-car field of 2001 pole winners.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Stewart held off Earnhardt by a minuscule .145 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "I figured the race was over five laps from the finish," Earnhardt
Jr. said. "The entire time I was behind Tony, I never once had the
opportunity to pass him. Never. I was trying to help him because we
worked together for most of last year's Shootout.</TE>
<TE>   "I was kind of sticking with him, but there's a point in time when
you make a decision to try to win the race for yourself. I never had
that opportunity so I'm kind of disappointed that the guy up front
had such an easy ride.</TE>
<TE>   "From second on back it was one hell of a race. But you just can't
get the leader for some reason."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart led 31 of the 70 laps to win $200,955.</TE>
<TE>   A Ford led the first three laps, but that was because Kurt Busch
drew the No. 1 starting position. He was quickly shuffled back and
finished 14th. The fastest Ford was sixth, driven by Dale Jarrett.</TE>
<TE>   That was better than Saturday's qualifying when only two
Fords--Jarrett 13th and Ricky Rudd 15th--finished in the Top 20.</TE>
<TE>   Needless to say, there was great anguish in the Ford ranks.</TE>
<TE>   "We're four or five-tenths off in qualifying trim," said Jack
Roush, owner of a team of Tauruses. "In racing setup, there's a
tendency for the cars to get stuck together somewhat for the draft so
that makes it look like they're closer than they might really be.</TE>
<TE>   "A Ford has no chance to be competitive to win [next Sunday's
Daytona 500] race."</TE>
<TE>   NASCAR officials reacted to the disparity among manufacturers by
making a rules change after the Shootout that is designed to help the
Fords by lowering the height of their rear spoiler by one-quarter
inch.</TE>
<TE>   Effective Tuesday, rear spoiler heights will be 6 inches for Ford,
61/4 inches for Chevrolets and 61/2 inches for Dodges and Pontiacs.</TE>
<TE>   Roush's complaints amused Gordon.</TE>
<TE>   "They forget two years ago here when I was driving around all day
feeling like all I was accomplishing was filling up a seat," Gordon
said. "In 2000, I was ninth of 10th in the July race here and I was
the first Chevrolet and I ran wide open the whole time and couldn't
make a single pass to get up through there."</TE>
<TE>   In the 2000 Daytona 500, the first five finishers were in Fords.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Helton, NASCAR president, said the change was made late
Sunday so that they can observe the results in Thursday's Twin 125
qualifying race.</TE>
<TE>   "Our rules change judgment was made from wind tunnel tests and the
first opportunity we had to observe it in action was Saturday in
qualifying and today in the race," Helton said. "We said all along
that we would make adjustments if we felt they were needed to
maintain a balance in competition.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not to say that more changes could be made after
Thursday's races."</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's race had a mandatory pit stop under green-flag racing
conditions. Stewart, Schrader and six others stopped on Lap 39, with
the other front-runners stopping a lap later. Stewart did not have a
particularly quick stop, but was able to charge to the front.</TE>
<TE>   "[Schrader] got hooked up out of the pits," explained Stewart. "A
lot of the guys that pitted later were by themselves, which is not
advantageous--to be out there alone. We just had a big run. We had
already passed two or three cars getting to Junior. By the time we
caught him in [turn] four we had a lot of momentum.</TE>
<TE>   "I told the guys in the pits, 'He may have 'Jr.' behind his name,
but he's got just as much skill and talent as his father had.' He
tried the same tricks his father tried to pull last year to get by
me.</TE>
<TE>   "I was mirror-watching. I was kind of conscious of what he was
doing and making sure--I probably looked two-thirds of the time
behind me and a third of the time ahead of me where I was going."</TE>

<KH>DAYTONA NOTES</KH>
<HD>Stewart Satisfied With Alterations</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tony Stewart said last year that racing at restrictor plate tracks
such as Daytona and Talladega was like playing Keno, that under the
2001 rules it was a gamble if you won, and a gamble if you survived a
horrendous wreck.</LD>
<LD>   "You can be going down the backstraight at Daytona in the lead and
look around and see a 20th-place car right behind you," he
complained. "The driver doesn't have control of what's happening on
the race track."</LD>
<LD>   NASCAR safety officials responded by eliminating roof strips on
all cars this season, thus reducing the amount of draft that pulls a
trailing car along behind a lead car. This also served to eliminate
the 20-or-more car freight trains that led to violent multi-car
accidents such as the one Stewart was involved in during last year's
Daytona 500 when he sailed through the air and landed atop Bobby
Labonte's car, or the one on the final turn of the final lap when
Dale Earnhardt was killed.</LD>
<TE>   Stewart, Sunday's Budweiser Shootout winner, was enthusiastic
about the changes.</TE>
<TE>   "With last year's package, I felt like the car was driving me and
I was just riding along," Stewart said. "This year I feel like I'm at
least in more control of my car.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't mean it drives perfectly. We were tight at times
during the race, we were loose at times, but at least I felt like I
was in control of what my car was doing.</TE>
<TE>   "If anything, I can honestly say that I think it's going to make
it a safer race for us. I told [crew chief] Greg Zipadelli after we
had our 'Happy Hour' session yesterday that I didn't feel like I ever
had to hold my breath because I felt uncomfortable out there.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the first time that I've felt comfortable at a restrictor
plate track in two years."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Gerhart, of Lebanon, Pa., drove a Pontiac to victory in the
rain-shortened Discount Auto Parts 200, opening race of the ARCA
season. Gerhart also won in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The race, scheduled for 80 laps, was halted after 54 when a second
rainstorm flooded the track. Shortly after it was stopped, the sun
came out and dried the track in time for the Budweiser Shootout.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran short-track driver Rick Carelli, of Arvada, Colo., was
second in a Chevrolet, followed by Frank Kimmel, the defending ARCA
champion from Jeffersonville, Ind., in a Ford.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that if this race would have gone nonstop to the finish,
I was where I needed to be," Gerhart said.</TE>

<HD>Dixon Wins Round 1</HD>
<DH>Winternationals: He defeats rival Bernstein in the top fuel
final of NHRA's first event of season.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You want storylines for the Powerade NHRA Drag Racing Series? In top
fuel on Sunday at the 42nd K&amp;N Filters Winternationals, the Kenny
Bernstein-Larry Dixon rivalry picked up where it left off in 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Funny car champion John Force nearly cried in a news conference.
And the pro stock winner was the last qualifier in the 16-man field
and won by 9/10,000th of a second--about three inches.</LD>
<LD>   Dixon, Force, and George Marnell were the winners in front of
about 40,000 at Pomona Raceway.</LD>
<TE>   It was also an eventful weekend for Dixon's team owner, Don "The
Snake" Prudhomme, celebrating his 40th season in racing.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Dixon's victory, Prudhomme went nose-to-nose on
Saturday in the parking lot with Force, who made a joke from his
Jaguar about Prudhomme's recent purchase of a Learjet.</TE>
<TE>   "I took it the wrong way," Prudhomme said. "I got in his face. We
kissed and made up ... but I'll tell you one thing, we didn't take
one penny out of the racing budget.</TE>
<TE>   "We're dead serious about what we're doing."</TE>
<TE>   Such is the pressure of racing at this level, and after the Miller
Lite dragster owned by Prudhomme fell short against Bernstein's
Budweiser King in last season's series championship, there were
smiles all around Sunday night. At least for a day.</TE>
<TE>   "[Prudhomme] said you can celebrate today, but tomorrow we have to
work on [the Feb. 24 race at] Phoenix," Dixon said. "This is only
Chapter 1. This is a 23-chapter book."</TE>
<TE>   Dixon, 35, and Prudhomme, 58, grew up in the San Fernando Valley.
It was Dixon's 17th career victory, Prudhomme's 28th as an owner, his
77th overall.</TE>
<TE>   Bernstein, a six-time NHRA champion who is retiring at the end of
the season, made his 106th final-round appearance. Bernstein won at
Pomona in November in the season finale to clinch the series title
over Dixon by 95 points.</TE>
<TE>   In Sunday's final, Dixon used a 4.535-second run at 324.75 mph to
defeat Bernstein by .077 of a second.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, Andrew Cowin--whose 4.490 time established a track record
in qualifying--smoked his tires in the first round and lost to No. 16
qualifier John Smith. Tony Schumacher, whose 330.88 mph was also a
track record in qualifying, also fell in the first round to Wyatt
Radke.</TE>
<TE>   In the semifinals, and Bernstein defeated Anaheim's Cory
McClenathan, back from a one-year hiatus and driving the car he last
drove two years ago for Joe Gibbs. McClenathan had defeated Smith in
the second round and his wife, Rhonda Hartman-Smith, in the first.
Dixon's semifinal victory came against Clay Millican.</TE>
<TE>   "Larry knows how important every round is, especially as close as
he was to Bernstein," Prudhomme said. "Each round is critical. At the
end of the year, it's a big deal."</TE>
<TE>   Prudhomme doesn't only want to beat Bernstein before he retires,
but is also after Force, the 11-time funny car champion who has won
nine in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Force, of Yorba Linda, limped to victory ahead of Chino Hills
driver Del Worsham.</TE>
<TE>   It was Force's 99th career victory, and his first at the
Winternationals since 1997, ending his longest active losing streak
at a particular event.</TE>
<TE>   Force and Prudhomme squared off on the quarter-mile in the
semifinals Sunday with Force--the top qualifier at 4.749--beating
Prudhomme driver Ron Capps with a mechanically flawed 4.972-second
run to Capps' 5.202.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not running quite as good as Force," Prudhomme quipped,
"but we've got a better driver."</TE>
<TE>   Capps was frustrated by what might have been.</TE>
<TE>   "He was lucky today," Capps said. "We were side by side. I could
hear him next to me and about that time I said, 'Here we go,' and
[then] there was a big kaboom and right after that he came flying by
with smoke coming off the rear of his car. That's depressing."</TE>
<TE>   Worsham lost to Force for the 32nd time. In the final, Force ran
his worst time of the weekend, 6.260 at 219.76 mph, and Worsham, who
had run nothing worse than a 4.894 in the first three rounds,
struggled to the finish with a 6.642 at 243.68 mph.</TE>
<TE>   "Luck's a big deal here, and sometimes it just works, but he was
in trouble first," Force said. "There was no motor left in my car to
get to the other end, or in his, either."</TE>
<TE>   The victory was reassuring to Force, 52, who was surprisingly
emotional. "At my age, you begin to think maybe you can't come back,"
said Force, whose voice began cracking. "I'm going to leave."</TE>
<TE>   And then Force, never at a loss for words, walked out.</TE>
<TE>   In pro stock, 16th-seeded Marnell scored his second career victory
by edging Jim Yates, running 6.88 seconds at 200.89 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Yates had a lower elapsed time, 6.812 seconds, but Marnell's
reaction time was nearly perfect, .417 seconds. It was also an
emotional day for Marnell; one his team members, Bill Smith, died on
Thursday in Las Vegas.</TE>

<HD>Ducks Flying South Again</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Anaheim, which had its six-game winning streak end
Friday, falls to Dallas, its second loss in a row.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dallas Stars put the Mighty Ducks back in their place--14th place
in the Western Conference--and hammered home a valuable lesson in the
process.</LD>
<LD>   The Ducks tried to take comfort that Sunday's 5-1 loss at the
Arrowhead Pond was not a lopsided affair. Yet they were left with an
uncomfortable feeling.</LD>
<LD>   "To tell you the truth, I don't know if that was an indication of
how good they are," Duck assistant captain Oleg Tverdovsky said.</LD>
<TE>   "It was probably an indication of how bad we played tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Two plays by the Stars' Jere Lehtinen  underscored how far removed
the Ducks are from their six-game winning streak, which reached a
climax Wednesday with a 5-4 come-from-behind victory against
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Lehtinen had an open net to shoot at late in the first period. He
lost control of the puck, only to have it deflect off goalie Steve
Shields' skate back to Lehtinen.</TE>
<TE>   Goal, 1-0.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the second period, Lehtinen was in the Dallas zone when
Anaheim defenseman Keith Carney lost control of the puck. Lehtinen
picked up the puck and passed it to Brenden Morrow, who started a
two-on-one rush.</TE>
<TE>   Goal, 3-0.</TE>
<TE>   Boos from the announced crowd of 14,617 followed.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks, who had their winning streak snapped Friday by
Carolina, had another broken Sunday. They had a string of 36 games
where they were either leading, tied or within a goal in the third
period come to an end.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like we have tendency to have streaks, bad ones and good
ones," Tverdovsky said. "It probably started with Philadelphia, where
we gave up a lot of goals.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to tighten our defense. We can't score five goals every
night. We can't open up and play like we want to score five goals."</TE>
<TE>   Dallas' Mike Modano had a goal and four assists. Morrow had a goal
and three assists. Lehtinen had a goal and two assists. All
capitalized on opportunities the Ducks weren't giving up a week ago.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim has given up 12 goals in its last three games.</TE>
<TE>   "With a younger team, guys here don't forget, but they don't
realize what gave us success," captain Paul Kariya said. "When we
were scoring goals, we weren't going out there necessarily trying to
score goals.</TE>
<TE>   "We played well positionally and scored. The last couple games we
tried to make plays that weren't there."</TE>
<TE>   The Stars could relate to such a performance.</TE>
<TE>   They felt like they gave a game to the Ducks on Jan. 25, the day
Ken Hitchcock was fired and General Manager Bob Gainey stepped aside.
That evening, Ed Belfour gave up five goals in 22 shots before being
pulled.</TE>
<TE>   But Belfour kept the Stars from falling behind early Sunday. He
stopped 11 shots in the first period, with several quality saves to
keep the game scoreless.</TE>
<TE>   Belfour stopped 34 of 35 shots.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks had three power plays in the first period and failed to
capitalize. The Stars got one late in the period, and Lehtinen, with
help from a  fortuitous bounce, converted.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the first period, I thought our team had played
hard and played fairly well, and we were down by a goal," Duck Coach
Bryan Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was a much closer game than that. It should have
come down to the third period somewhat even. To me, it shouldn't have
been that lopsided."</TE>
<TE>   Then again, maybe it should have been.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what happened tonight," Tverdovsky said. "We played
some good games in a row. We just didn't show up tonight. We have to
start from scratch right."</TE>

<LD>Mighty Duck goalie Steve Shields made his first start in 20 days and
it was anything but a pleasant outing.</LD>
<LD>   Shields has been on the bench since Jan. 21, a streak of seven
games. He wasn't at his best Sunday in a 5-1 loss to the Dallas
Stars, although he said more work isn't what he needs.</LD>
<LD>   "Right now I need a lot of goals," Shields said.</LD>
<TE>   The strong play of Jean-Sebastien Giguere, who is sixth in the
league in save percentage and goals-against, has kept Shields on the
bench. Shields' last start was a 4-2 loss to the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "I love to play, I play better when I play a lot," Shields said.
"But the situation is dictated I don't play a lot recently. So I have
to do the best I can when I get out there."</TE>
<TE>   Shields is one of the players General Manager Pierre Gauthier has
indicated he would trade. Giguere has established himself as the
Ducks' No. 1 goalie and 21-year-old Ilja Bryzgalov seems to be living
up the promise that led the Ducks to select him in the second round
of the 2000 draft.</TE>
<TE>   Bryzgalov was named to the Russian Olympic team Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Shields has a 5-17-2 record, but the Ducks have scored two or
fewer goals in all but two of his starts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dallas center Joe Nieuwendyk was scratched Sunday because of flu.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Leclerc's second-period power-play goal was only the Ducks'
second in the last 25 power plays.</TE>

<HD>Olazabal Back in Title Form</HD>
<DH>Golf: He shoots a 65 in the final round and wins Buick
Invitational when Lewis three-putts final hole.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LA JOLLA</DL>
<LD>And now, how to make the most of your weekend, by Jose Maria
Olazabal: Make the cut at the Buick Invitational by one shot, start
Saturday in 69th place, begin the last round tied for 11th,
absolutely torch Torrey Pines with a searing 65, hold up the trophy
by 3 o'clock. Nothing to it.</LD>
<LD>   "You don't expect to shoot seven-under around here," Olazabal
said. Olazabal nearly holed out from the fairway at the 18th hole,
spinning his golf ball within three feet of the hole, tapped in for a
birdie and a one-shot lead, then took off to hit a few balls and get
ready in case somebody tied him.</LD>
<LD>   No one did, although it required a three-putt bogey from hard-luck
J. L. Lewis at the 18th to decide it. Lewis was even with Olazabal
after he birdied the 17th hole, but there was trouble lurking. Lewis,
who later said he was too pumped up, hit his lay-up shot on the 18th
so long he took himself out of the proper yardage to the flag. His
lob wedge was in the first cut of rough, some 72 yards from the flag,
which a rueful Lewis admitted to be at least 35 yards too close.</LD>
<TE>   His next shot stopped 40 feet from the hole.</TE>
<TE>   With Olazabal still waiting nearby at the putting green, a nervous
Lewis stood over his putt. Lewis left it eight feet short, then
pushed his par putt to the right to decide it. Moments later,
Olazabal accepted congratulations for his fifth PGA Tour victory, but
his first since he won his second Masters in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis was brutally honest in his defeat.</TE>
<TE>   "I just embarrassed myself, what can I say," Lewis said. "You're
gonna par that hole 99% of the time. I kind of got a bad break [with
the bad lie] and then I choked."</TE>
<TE>   Olazabal said he thinks Lewis will get over it.</TE>
<TE>   "I know he must be feeling sad," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, there are more than a few players who have to be
feeling downright giddy about the way they finished.</TE>
<TE>   Mark O'Meara, who has struggled this year, closed with a birdie
and tied Lewis for second place. Alone in fourth was John Daly, who
narrowly missed his first top-three finish in seven years, since his
victory at the 1995 British Open at St. Andrews. Lewis, O'Meara and
Daly all closed with two-under 70s.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was Tiger Woods, who takes this week off during the
Nissan Open after punching out a six-under 66, good enough for a tie
for fifth. Woods had seven birdies and a bogey at the par-four
fourth, but he thought he could have done even better.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not too often you are frustrated with a 66, but today is one
of those days," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Woods said he managed to iron out the swing problems which
contributed to the 77 he shot on Friday that essentially cost him the
tournament. What troubled him Sunday was his putting.</TE>
<TE>   Starting the day tied for 20th, Woods made his move quickly. By
the time he reached the back nine, Woods was four under for the
round. Woods had three chances to go a lot lower, but he missed a
10-foot birdie putt at No. 11, an eight-foot birdie putt at No. 12
and a seven-foot putt for an eagle at No. 13 where he tapped in for a
birdie. "But at least I gave myself a chance on the back nine ...
[and] came back after a 77," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I just didn't make the putts. Misread a couple and I hit a couple
of poor putts on top of that ... not a good combo."</TE>
<TE>   With four holes to go, there was a three-way tie among Olazabal,
O'Meara and Lewis. Olazabal was done at 13-under 275 and holding a
one-shot lead by the time Lewis and O'Meara reached the 16th tee.
O'Meara dropped two shots back with a bogey at the 17th, but Lewis
rolled in a clutch 10-footer to reach 13-under and tie Olazabal.</TE>
<TE>   All that was left was the beefy, 571-yard par five closing hole.</TE>
<TE>   O'Meara laid up and finished with a birdie, but Lewis was not
nearly as fortunate. He said he was nervous standing over his first
putt, an emotion he said was uncalled for. "You have to be honest
with yourself," Lewis said. "I've choked before and it'll happen
again. It's my job. You've got to learn to handle the pressure or you
do something else."</TE>
<TE>   It has been a long road back to the winner's circle for Olazabal.
He has been working for a year with Woods' coach, Butch Harmon, to
improve his swing. Specifically, Olazabal is trying to extend his
arms away from his body during his backswing. It's not that easy to
get it done, especially under pressure, he said. "You wonder if
you'll be able to get back on track," said Olazabal, who won
$648,000. "There's no secrets in this game, no magic potions."</TE>
<TE>   But he certainly had one magic shot that he produced at just the
right time. It was his lob wedge from 94 yards on the closing hole.
Olazabal knew the ball was going to come back a little bit and he was
correct. In fact, it nearly rolled back into the hole. "I knew it was
going to be good," he said. "It happened to be very, very good."</TE>

<LD>Hale Irwin birdied two of the last three holes Sunday to pass Tom
Watson and win the PGA Senior Tour ACE Group Classic at Naples, Fla.,
by one shot.</LD>
<LD>   Irwin won $225,000 and added to his Senior tour record with his
33rd career victory. He surpassed the $20-million mark in combined
earnings on the regular and Senior tours.</LD>
<LD>   Irwin, the 1997 champion, had a two-shot lead going into the par-4
No. 18, but put his drive in a fairway bunker and had to lay up.
Watson put his approach 40 feet from the pin. Irwin then barely
cleared the water next to the green. Watson's long birdie putt went
six feet past the cup. Irwin knocked his putt within four feet, and,
after Watson parred, sank the putt for bogey.</LD>

<KH>Mark Heisler ON THE NBA</KH>
<HD>He Has a Sad Philadelphia Story to Share</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>At 23, Kobe Bryant has two NBA titles, a slam dunk crown, four
All-Star selections, one All-Star MVP trophy and no home town.</LD>
<LD>   Having previously taken down such erstwhile favorites as Santa
Claus and the Easter Bunny, local fans turned on one of their own
Sunday, booing Bryant progressively louder as he climbed toward 31
points.</LD>
<LD>   Here's how bad he felt: he even acknowledged it.</LD>
<TE>   "I was pretty upset," he said afterward. "Pretty hurt. I just
wanted to go out there and just play, play hard. But they booed and
you know....</TE>
<TE>   "I still like coming home, though. I still enjoy playing in
Philly, nonetheless."</TE>
<TE>   For the bulletproof Bryant, this was a rare concession. This is a
young man who, in his time, has feuded with the star player on his
team and found, or kept, himself isolated from the rest of the
Lakers' roster, never showing an ounce of distress or breathing a
word of complaint.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is this the kind of city to turn its back on a local
basketball hero, wherever he goes and for whomever he plays.</TE>
<TE>   Sure Bryant left, but so have all of Philadelphia's schoolboy
legends.</TE>
<TE>   Wilt Chamberlain spurned the Big Five schools, went to Kansas,
left town again when the NBA Warriors moved to the Bay Area, returned
to the 76ers, commuted from New York, ripped his home town in the
press, forced the 76ers to trade him, then refused their entreaties
to retire his jersey for more than 20 years before finally deigning
to accept.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, Wilt remained a local hero. When they finally put his No. 13
on the Spectrum wall, the 76ers could have sold 100,000 tickets.</TE>
<TE>   All the others left, too, such as Rasheed Wallace (University of
North Carolina, Blazers) who would go onto stardom and Gene Banks
(Duke, several NBA teams) and Andre McCarter (UCLA, several NBA
teams) whose careers soon waned. None was any nicer than the
sweet-tempered Bryant, but he, alone, was drummed out of the family.</TE>
<TE>   The difference, of course, was that Bryant bypassed not only the
Big Five schools, but college entirely.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant's father, Joe, was not only a Philly guy and a former 76er,
but a LaSalle assistant. Talk radio, which is huge here, ran with it
big time.</TE>
<TE>   You can't say a high school senior who asks a pop singer to his
prom has been totally unaffected but on the other hand, Bryant turned
out to be the real deal. In other words, he was right and everyone
else, especially here, was wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Then, as if to confirm the local picture of him--Punk
Ingrate--Bryant was quoted during last spring's finals as saying he
was from Los Angeles, not here.</TE>
<TE>   He would later say it had just been his competitive zeal talking.
In fact, he had never before denied his Philadelphia heritage, which
he took pride in.</TE>
<TE>   Far from forgetting his roots, he had clung to them for all he was
worth; in his withdrawn early days in the league, he'd be alone in
his hotel room on the road, on the phone with friends from high
school.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the finals, however, the resentment seemed carved in
stone.</TE>
<TE>   When Bryant recanted, between Games 4 and 5 (by which time the
Lakers had a 3-1 lead), explaining that he had always considered
himself a Philly guy, neither of the local papers ran a word of it.</TE>
<TE>   By this weekend, he was hoping he had turned the corner.</TE>
<TE>   He had recently been honored by his high school, Lower Merion,
which retired his jersey. He was back as an All-Star and wouldn't be
playing against the 76ers. . He wore his father's 76er jersey to the
media session.</TE>
<TE>   He probably thought people would be happy to see him do well, but
that wasn't how it turned out.</TE>
<TE>   The local fans, who are nothing if not diehards, sat yearning for
Allen Iverson to do something, but Iverson, exhausted from a hard
weekend of partying, chilled.</TE>
<TE>   Nor did Michael Jordan do anything legendary, other than miss a
breakaway dunk.</TE>
<TE>   The West plowed the East for three quarters, just as it had last
season. This time, however, the East couldn't come all the way back,
as it did last season, and the final score, 135-120, was as one-sided
as the game had been.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt real bad because, you know, at a happy moment, a happy
time like that, you just want him [Bryant] to enjoy it," said
Iverson, the unlikely bearer of compassion.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd think people would say, 'What if that was their kid,' but
they didn't," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though he's from Philly, he's not a 76er," said East Coach
Byron Scott, once a mentor to Bryant. "And I think he understands
it."</TE>
<TE>   I think he does now, anyway.</TE>

<LD>On his fourth consecutive weekend trip to California, jockey Jerry
Bailey finally got it right.</LD>
<LD>   Beaten with Siphonic, Squirtle Squirt and Lido Palace, all odds-on
favorites in graded stakes the previous three weekends at Santa
Anita, Bailey scored with 6-5 favorite You in the $200,000 Las
Virgenes Stakes Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Despite a wide trip, the 3-year-old daughter of You and I turned
the tables on Habibti, the 2-1 second choice, winning her second
Grade I by a length in 1:364/5 for the mile.</LD>
<TE>   Trained by Bobby Frankel for owner Ed Gann, who purchased the
filly privately after her second career start last summer, You won
for the fourth time in seven career outings in her first race of
2002.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I finally won one out here," Bailey said. "I was kind of
surprised to look out at the tote board and see she was favored. It
was a good win for her."</TE>
<TE>   Frankel indicated You will make her next start in the $300,000
Santa Anita Oaks on March 9 before she heads to Churchill Downs for
the Kentucky Oaks on May 3.</TE>
<TE>   Habibti, who had beaten You by a head in the Hollywood Starlet on
Dec. 16, could not have had a better trip Sunday, despite a slight
bobble leaving the gate.</TE>
<TE>   Looking for her third Grade I victory, the Tabasco Cat filly
finished two lengths ahead of 14-1 longshot and pacesetter
Tali'sluckybusride, who had also finished third behind the two big
fillies in the Starlet.</TE>

<HD>Murray: Palffy Not to Blame</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ziggy Palffy will face no repercussions from the Kings despite
playing for Slovakia against the team's wishes in an Olympic
preliminary-round game Saturday at Salt Lake City, Coach Andy Murray
said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Though he had been given permission to play only in a Sunday night
game against Latvia, Palffy was in uniform and sitting on the Slovak
bench Saturday when Coach Jan Filc pressed him into service midway
through the second period with his team trailing Germany, 2-0.</LD>
<LD>   Afterward, King General Manager Dave Taylor phoned his counterpart
with Slovakia's Olympic hockey team, former NHL standout Peter
Stastny, and made it clear he did not want to see Palffy in uniform
Sunday night.</LD>
<TE>   "We're not upset with Ziggy, not at all," Murray said. "He's there
with his country, they've asked him to dress. He knew he was going to
play [only] one game. I guess they took the chance [Saturday]. I
guess maybe they were thinking, just dress him for moral support and
not play him....</TE>
<TE>   "Peter Stastny should have been the one to say, 'He doesn't
dress.' Peter Stastny has to be the one to take the blame for it, not
the coach. You can't blame the coach when you're trying to win and
you've got Ziggy Palffy sitting on the bench."</TE>
<TE>   Palffy and Lubomir Visnovsky, a King defenseman who played in both
weekend games for Slovakia, are scheduled to fly into Los Angeles
this morning aboard owner Philip Anschutz's private jet.</TE>
<TE>   Palffy is expected to play in tonight's game against the Dallas
Stars at Staples Center, but Visnovsky might be scratched.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A minor adjustment in Damon Jackson's shot made a huge difference for
Fresno State.</LD>
<LD>   Jackson made seven of 11 three-point shots and scored a
career-high 24 points, and the Bulldogs ended a losing streak at four
with a 58-52 victory over No. 14 Oklahoma State in a nonconference
game Sunday afternoon at Fresno.</LD>
<LD>   Travis DeManby had a school-record 11 steals for Fresno State
(15-10). Ivan McFarlin and Victor Williams each scored 12 points for
Oklahoma State (18-6).</LD>
<TE>   Jackson, a 6-foot-2 junior guard, had made 13 of his previous 54
three-point shots. He got some advice from Coach Jerry Tarkanian, who
told him to look at the rim after shooting instead of following the
flight of the ball.</TE>
<TE>   "I give coach a lot of credit for having confidence in me,"
Jackson said. "I gave him a big hug after the game and said,
'Thanks.'"</TE>
<TE>   Fresno State shot 34.5%. Oklahoma State shot 35% and committed 25
turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   Melvin Ely, the Bulldogs' leading scorer this season, was held to
11 points.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought defensively we did a good job on Ely, and our defense
was good enough to give us a chance to win," Oklahoma State Coach
Eddie Sutton said. "But like someone told me a long time ago, if you
don't put the ball in the bucket you're not going to win."</TE>
<TE>   No. 3 Maryland 92, North Carolina 77--Juan Dixon scored 18 points
at Chapel Hill, N.C., and the Terrapins (19-3, 9-1) matched their
best overall and Atlantic Coast Conference starts in school history.</TE>
<TE>   The last time Maryland won nine of its first 10 conference games
was 22 seasons ago.</TE>
<TE>   North Carolina (6-15, 2-9) matched the school record for losses in
a season. Kris Lang had 23 points for the Tar Heels.</TE>
<TE>   No. 10 Virginia 85, Clemson 71--Roger Mason Jr. scored 23 points
and sparked a 15-0 second-half run for the Cavaliers (15-6, 5-5 ACC)
at Charlottesville, Va.</TE>
<TE>   Clemson (11-13, 2-9) lost its eighth in a row. Jamar McKnight had
18 points for the Tigers.</TE>
<TE>   Boston College 76, No. 12 Miami 63--Troy Bell scored 24 points and
Ryan Sidney had 23 at Boston, and the Eagles (16-7, 5-5 Big East)
beat the Hurricanes (20-4, 7-4) for the second time in 13 days.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan State 67, No. 16 Ohio State 64--Marcus Taylor and Adam
Ballinger each had 18 points at East Lansing, Mich., and the Spartans
(14-9, 5-5 Big Ten) used two 13-0 runs to knock the Buckeyes (17-5,
8-3) out of first place.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 75, No. 23 Syracuse 63--Brandin Knight scored 11 of his
16 points in the final 5:34, and the Panthers (21-4, 9-3 Big East)
overcame a 14-point deficit in the second half to win in Syracuse's
Carrier Dome for the first time since March 2, 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Preston Shumpert had 28 points for Syracuse (18-7, 7-4). The
Orangemen have lost five of their last seven games.</TE>

<HD>Goal Helps Soothe Battered Barnaby</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Matthew Barnaby, bumped and battered all game, said he felt like a
tired old "speed bag"--until he scored.</LD>
<LD>   Moments after complaining to a referee about a non-call, Barnaby
scored with 21.1 seconds remaining, giving the Rangers a 4-3 victory
over the Pittsburgh Penguins on Sunday afternoon at New York.</LD>
<LD>   Barnaby, known as an instigator, has scored in two consecutive
games and has four goals this season.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a rough game, a lot of things went on," Barnaby said, "but
it's always fun to have the final word."</TE>
<TE>   With Barnaby stopping to talk to the official about a hook from
behind by Ian Moran--his former teammate at Pittsburgh--Johan Hedberg
came too far out of the net to clear a puck.</TE>
<TE>   New York's Petr Nedved raced in to take advantage and found
Barnaby, who was closing in on the far post.</TE>
<TE>   "Any goalie can make a mistake, just like the rest of us," Barnaby
said. "When I saw him come out of goal, my eyes lit up. When I saw
Petr pick it off, my eyes lit up even more."</TE>
<TE>   A tired Barnaby, who split his lip and gums earlier in the game
after a booming hit by Darius Kasparaitis, was headed to the bench
but decided to hang around when Nedved got possession.</TE>
<TE>   "No way I was coming off then," Barnaby said.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second consecutive late defeat for the Penguins, who
gave up a goal to New Jersey with 8.6 seconds remaining in overtime
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The Rangers ended a nine-game winless streak against Pittsburgh
(0-8-1) dating to February 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Nedved, Radek Dvorak and Brian Leetch had the other goals for New
York.</TE>
<TE>   Lang, Andrew Ference and Jan Hrdina scored for Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 4, New York Islanders 3--Sergei Zholtok scored twice in
the third period at St. Paul, Minn., as the goal-starved Wild ended a
losing streak at five</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota, which last won on Jan. 18 at Columbus, had scored only
10 goals in a nine-game winless streak. Sunday was the first time in
15 games the Wild scored four goals or more.</TE>
<TE>   Kip Miller had a goal and an assist for the Islanders.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 4, Buffalo 1--Jason Arnott had his first three-goal
game since 1996 and Martin Brodeur made 21 saves for the Devils at
East Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Arnott had three goals in his previous 14 games. It was his third
career hat trick.</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo had a streak overtime games end at four and an unbeaten
streak stopped at five.</TE>
<TE>   Edmonton 4, Phoenix 3--Janne Niinimaa and Mike Comrie scored late
in the third period to help the Oilers end a road winless streak at
11.</TE>
<TE>   Comrie tied the score, 3-3, with 4:15 to play. Niinimaa followed
with a goal from the point 39 seconds later.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix's Daniel Briere had an assist, extending his point streak
to seven games, the longest in the league.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose 4, Carolina 0--Evgeni Nabokov became the Sharks' career
leader in victories with 57 after stopping 24 shots at San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   It was Nabokov's seventh shutout this season--his second in three
games and the 14th of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Marleau scored twice for the Pacific Division-leading
Sharks, who extended their winning streak to four games.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Barrasso had 23 saves for the Hurricanes.</TE>

<HD>Nations Cup: African Soccer at Its Zany Best</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The latest edition of the African Nations Cup--soccer's most
improbable championship--reached its climax Sunday when two World
Cup-bound teams, Cameroon and Senegal, met in the final in Bamako,
Mali.</LD>
<LD>   The sides played for two scoreless hours before Cameroon,
gold-medal winner at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, prevailed, 3-2, on
penalty kicks. The Indomitable Lions thus became the first team in 37
years to successfully defend its African championship.</LD>
<LD>   Sunday's title game marked the conclusion of three bizarre weeks
during which strange behavior, not to mention a malaria outbreak,
often overshadowed the matches.</LD>
<TE>   As recently as Thursday, for example, suspicions of witchcraft
sparked unseemly scenes before Cameroon's semifinal game against the
host nation, Mali.</TE>
<TE>   When Cameroon's players and coaches were inspecting the field an
hour or so before kickoff, police suddenly rushed assistant coach
Thomas Nkono, the Indomitable Lions' World Cup goalkeeper in 1982 and
1990, and forced him to the ground, kicking and screaming.</TE>
<TE>   According to an Agence France-Presse account, Nkono "was
handcuffed and led away down the players' tunnel, at one point with
his tracksuit trousers pulled around his ankles." The police, local
journalists said, apparently believed that Nkono had purposely
dropped an object onto the field that they believed was a black-magic
charm intended to help Cameroon. The 50,000 Mali fans in the packed
stadium cheered when one of the policemen retrieved the unidentified
object and held it aloft.</TE>
<TE>   Witchcraft remains a common feature of African soccer, and some
teams actually employ witchdoctors when preparing for significant
matches or tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   Bidoung Mpkatt, Cameroon's minister for sport, scoffed at the idea
that Nkono had been up to similar mischief.</TE>
<TE>   "Lucky charms don't play football," he said "The truth is on the
pitch." And so it proved. After initially refusing to go ahead with
the game, Cameroon did so and won easily, 3-0.</TE>
<TE>   The witchcraft incident added a diplomatic touch on Friday when
Alpha Oumar Konare, Mali's president, apologized for the actions of
the police.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a gesture that we really appreciated," Cameroon Coach
Winfried Schafer said. "Mali owed us an apology and we received it
from their leading citizen." Nkono, however, remained upset.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an outrageous attack, I'm very angry about it," he told
Reuters. "These sort of incidents cause great harm to the image of
Africa.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you imagine [former French star and coach] Michel Platini
walking out with the French team before a match in Spain and being
given the same treatment. Impossible."</TE>
<TE>   It turned out the Nkono was not without blame himself. Mustapha
Fahmy, secretary general of the Confederation of African Football, on
Saturday announced that CAF had suspended Nkono for one year for not
wearing the correct accreditation, and that it was this that had
sparked the police action.</TE>
<TE>   Senegal plays defending champion France, Denmark and Uruguay in
the World Cup, while Cameroon's opponents will be Germany, Ireland
and Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   Nigeria Infighting</TE>
<TE>   Senegal, which will open the 2002 World Cup against France in
Seoul, South Korea, on May 31, ousted Nigeria from the African
Nations Cup, adding to the woes of another World Cup-bound team.</TE>
<TE>   Nigeria will play Argentina, England and Sweden in the so-called
"group of death" in Japan, but the team's 2-1 overtime loss in the
semifinals has not demoralized players as much as frequent clashes
with their own soccer federation.</TE>
<TE>   Nigeria's federation officials interfere constantly with the team,
firing coaches at the proverbial drop of a hat.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Shaibu Amodu might be the next to go, even though he remains
defiant.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not making any excuses," he said. "If Nigerians are not
happy with us, they should kindly accept my apologies. It would have
been great going to the World Cup as African champions. But it was
not to be and it is not the end of the world.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody must have learned from this tournament and this
experience will certainly help us for the World Cup."</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Nigeria defeated Mali, 1-0, on a goal by Yakubu
Aiyegbeni to take third place in the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   South Africa Critics</TE>
<TE>   Another coach on the firing line--at least from the media--is
South Africa's Carlos Queiroz, whose team was knocked out in the
quarterfinals by Mali.</TE>
<TE>   South Africa will play Slovenia, Spain and Paraguay in the first
round of the World Cup, and Queiroz, formerly coach of Portugal, has
been lambasted for his team selections.</TE>
<TE>   "He has not picked players on current form as he promised he
would," said Emmanuel Cele of Johannesburg's City Press newspaper.
"Instead he has relied on his favorite overseas pros, many of whom
are struggling at their clubs.</TE>
<TE>   "And his priorities have been all wrong. He spent the whole year
in Europe traveling to negotiate the release of players for national
team duties. Yet, when these players are invited to play for South
Africa, they never show up."</TE>
<TE>   Queiroz got a vote of confidence, however, from South African
soccer federation member Mohamed Mubarak.</TE>
<TE>   "The South African media has been very unfair on the coach," he
told Agence France-Presse. "They have been so negative, and that has
unsettled him. But he will be with us up to the World Cup."</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Nigeria defeated Mali, 1-0, on a goal by Yakubu
Aiyegbeni to take third place in the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Tunisia Woe</TE>
<TE>   Tunisia, the last of Africa's five World Cup participants,
performed worst of all in the African Nations Cup, failing to win a
game or score a goal.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Henri Michel's squad was knocked out in the first round and
now faces the unenviable task of playing more-powerful Belgium,
Russia and cohost Japan in the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "We have weaknesses everywhere--tactically, physically,
technically, mentally," fumed Michel, who coached France to the
semifinals of the 1986 World Cup in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "We must now change our work ethic and our mentality. If we want
to progress, there need to be changes in a lot of areas, how we
operate, the way we act, the squad, the players, the officials."</TE>
<TE>   In short, everything but the coach. But that has a way of
changing, too.</TE>
<TE>   Liberia Farewell</TE>
<TE>   The 23rd African Nations Cup marked the curtain call for Liberia's
George Weah, former world and European player of the year and a
UNICEF ambassador.</TE>
<TE>   Weah's retirement from the national team at 35 was marked by an
astonishing attack on the government of President Charles Taylor,
whom he accused of fearing Weah's popularity.</TE>
<TE>   "The president of Liberia is against us," Weah said. "The
government is against us. They are jealous of us. I don't deserve
that. I have children who have still to grow up and go to school. I
don't want somebody to come and kill me because of my popularity.</TE>
<TE>   "They have already burned my house down. They've repossessed my
shops. It's not safe, I don't want something to happen to me before
my children grow up. I'm afraid ... I don't feel safe. The message of
the president is that I am a target."</TE>
<TE>   In Africa, soccer is never a simple game. Politics and witchcraft
go hand in hand with sport.</TE>

<HD>Reconfigured Divisions Raise Stakes at Masters Meet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the Southern Section dual meet championships decided, the focus
shifts to the individual championships, which will have a new look
when they are contested this weekend at six sites throughout Southern
California.</LD>
<LD>   The divisions have been renamed, reconfigured and a new division
has been added this year in an effort to get better quality wrestlers
into the Masters Meet. Divisions I-V are gone, replaced by the
Northern, Central, Southern, Eastern, Inland and Coastal divisions.
Though geographically named, teams are not placed in divisions based
on geography. Instead, the teams are seeded into the divisions by the
number of Masters qualifiers each had last year. The six teams with
the most qualifiers are in different divisions.</LD>
<LD>   In the past, Division I was comprised of mostly top teams, and
therefore top individuals, whereas Division V would have a weaker
field. However, each division sent six wrestlers to the Masters Meet
and the quality of the meet would sometimes suffer. "What we've done
is created six equal divisions," Southern Section Assistant
Commissioner Rob Wigod said. "We restructured the divisions to make
them as fair as they can be."</LD>
<TE>   Since there are now six divisions, only the top five individuals
in each division will advance to the Masters, but most coaches
applaud the change.</TE>
<TE>   "If you had all the Division I schools in the same division, there
would be some good individuals sitting home," Santa Ana Coach Scott
Glabb said. "The Division I duals were tough enough. If we had to do
that again with the individuals, it would be that much more
frustrating."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The new look: Even with realignment, some divisions appear tougher
than others. Here's a look at the favorites from each division:
Northern--Santa Ana Calvary Chapel, Moreno Valley Canyon Springs,
North Torrance. Central-- Rosemead, Corona Centennial, Alhambra, El
Modena, Villa Park. Southern--Temecula Valley, Paso Robles.
Eastern--Northview, Santa Ana, Arroyo Grande, Santa Maria Righetti.
Inland--Chino Hills Ayala, Santa Fe, Thousand Oaks, Placentia El
Dorado. Coastal--Laguna Hills, Los Alamitos, Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dual injuries: The Southern Section Division II dual meet
championships had the most exciting finish of all the divisions.
Rosemead rallied from a 16-point deficit by winning the final five
weight classes for a 35-32 victory over Paso Robles. But the victory
may have been costly for Rosemead.</TE>
<TE>   Raul Espinoza, who placed eighth in the 171-pound weight class at
the Five Counties tournament last month, sprained his neck.
Paramedics took Espinoza to the hospital, where he stayed overnight
for observation. Mitchell Monteiro of Paso Robles also required
treatment from paramedics after injuring his shoulder during his
189-pound match. Mitchell is the brother of Mike Monteiro, a state
qualifier last year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the City: San Fernando is the favorite for the City Section
dual meet championship, which will be contested Thursday at Woodland
Hills El Camino High. The Tigers are awaiting word on the eligibility
of 145-pounder Ramon Perry, a state qualifier last year who was
suspended from school for fighting and placed in continuation school
earlier this year. San Fernando Coach Mike Castillo said he may have
Perry back for the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "He's supposed to be back in school Monday," Castillo said. "If he
is, he'll be on a tight leash."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In case you missed it: Southern Section dual meet championship
match results from Saturday night were as follows: Division
I--Temecula Valley 40, Santa Ana 16; Division II--Rosemead 35, Paso
Robles 32; Division III--Moreno Valley Canyon Springs 37, Santa Maria
Righetti 25; Division IV--Alhambra 54, Ventura 7; Division V--Alta
Loma 39, City of Industry Workman 21; Division VI--Littlerock 34,
Palmdale Highland 28.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>University of Connecticut defender Chris Gbandi was the first of 66
players selected Sunday when Major League Soccer held its draft of
high school, college and minor league players in Orlando, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   Gbandi, who won the Hermann Trophy as college soccer's top player
in 2000, was chosen by the Dallas Burn, which also selected Southern
Methodist University midfielder Carl Bussey and Stanford defender Lee
Morrison in the first round.</LD>
<LD>   Liberian-born but raised in Houston, Gbandi, 22, was a three-time
All-American at Connecticut.</LD>
<TE>   Luchi Gonzalez, the 2001 Hermann Trophy winner from SMU, was the
only forward taken in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   Drafted by the San Jose Earthquakes, he was the sixth player
chosen overall. The Galaxy, which had the first pick in the second
round as its highest choice, used it to take 22-year-old New York
midfielder Hemir Niebles, who had been playing for the Brooklyn
Knights of the Professional Developmental League.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Niebles, the Galaxy drafted Connecticut goalkeeper
Bryheem Hancock (22nd overall); Bradley forward Gavin Glinton (25th);
Venezuelan forward Alejandro Moreno of North Carolina Greensboro
(25th); defender Cory Gibbs of St. Pauli in the German Bundesliga
(38th); midfielder Noah Delgado of Fresno State (48th); midfielder
Lawrence Smalls of UC Irvine (59th) and forward Ishmael Mintah of
Creighton (69th).</TE>

<HD>South Korea Has Problem at Home</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a part of the world where honor is everything and saving face is
more than a fancy phrase, South Korea is showing signs of panic.</LD>
<LD>   Less than four months from now, the nation will be cohost of the
largest single-sport event in the world, soccer's World Cup. Somewhat
belatedly, the realization is sinking in that South Korea's national
team is not up to the task.</LD>
<LD>   Its potential failure could cause South Koreans considerable
embarrassment. In the 72-year history of the World Cup, no host
nation has failed to advance to at least the second round.</LD>
<TE>   Odds are, however, that South Korea will be unable to defeat any
of its World Cup opponents--Poland, the United States and
Portugal--and will be ousted in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   That scenario appeared much more likely after South Korea finished
fourth in the Gold Cup that ended Feb. 2 at the Rose Bowl. It failed
to win any of its five games and scored only three goals.</TE>
<TE>   Repercussions were immediate.</TE>
<TE>   * Several South Korean media members demanded that Guus Hiddink,
the Dutch veteran who led the Netherlands to fourth place in the
France '98 World Cup, be fired as national coach. Some criticized
Hiddink for taking his girlfriend to California for the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   * Chung Mong-Joon, a vice president of FIFA, the world governing
body of the sport, and cochairman of the South Korean World Cup
Organizing Committee (KOWOC), took the extraordinary step of asking
the government to allow national team players to be exempt from the
required two years and two months of military service if the team
reaches the second round.</TE>
<TE>   * South Korea had scouts watching North Korea play Singapore in a
friendly game in Singapore on Thursday. The straw-clutching idea was
to possibly strengthen South Korea's World Cup team by adding
promising North Korean players to the squad.</TE>
<TE>   "We have dispatched several technical committee members to
Singapore to check and study their players during the match," Nam
Kwang-Woo, deputy secretary general of the Korean soccer federation,
said on the federation's Web site.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea, however, showed little in a 2-1 loss, leaving South
Korea still searching for a solution.</TE>
<TE>   Precedent exists for Korea to field a unified team. It did so at
the FIFA World Youth Championship in Portugal in 1991 and such a move
might receive FIFA's blessing.</TE>
<TE>   Sepp Blatter, the president of FIFA, said  that while there no
longer is a chance of North Korea playing host to any World Cup
games, FIFA likely would not object to seeing a joint Korean team
participate in the May 31-June 30 World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "This is up to them," Blatter said. "We would be faced with a very
unusual and nonforeseen situation. I do not know how [FIFA] would
react."</TE>
<TE>   Chung's proposal to government leaders in Seoul was reported in
Japan, the other cohost for the 32-nation tournament. "Reaching the
last 16 of the World Cup is more difficult than winning an Olympic
gold medal," the Nikkan Sports daily quoted Chung as saying. "If we
succeed, I would like to see military service waived."</TE>
<TE>   There was no immediate response to the request, which is a
somewhat desperate attempt to raise the motivation level of the
players, roughly half of whom face the prospect of compulsory service
in the armed forces.</TE>
<TE>   Far from being excited about the World Cup, South Korean fans are
said to be dreading the prospect of seeing their team humiliated.</TE>
<TE>   "At the moment there is the clear danger that, with the world
focusing on Korean football for the first time ever, the country may
be on course for the historical humiliation of being the first [host
nation] ever to fail to make the second round," the Korea Times said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, despite the media criticism, Hiddink's position appears
secure, for the time being.</TE>
<TE>   All that could change as early as Wednesday, when South Korea
travels to Montevideo to play a tough and uncompromising Uruguay team
intent on making its mark at the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Worst of all for South Korea is the fact that Japan, the
tournament's other cohost, appears to have a capable team, one that
could reach the second round.</TE>
<TE>   It all adds up to some long faces in Seoul.</TE>

<HD>Sampras Finds Motivation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>OKLAHOMA CITY</DL>
<LD>Nearly everyone could leave Oklahoma City feeling better for the
Davis Cup experience, despite its lousy timing, being shoehorned
between the Winter Olympics and the NBA All-Star Game.</LD>
<LD>   Mardy Fish won in his debut, hitting the clinching volley in his
doubles match with James Blake. In addition to the doubles, Blake won
the meaningless singles match on Sunday, whimsically called the dead
rubber. Patrick McEnroe made the right moves, in winning his first
World Group match as captain.</LD>
<LD>   Andy Roddick won his two matches. And the Slovaks were able to get
on their plane with more than their luggage, leaving with some
dignity, having won four sets, four more than anticipated in a 5-0
first-round loss.</LD>
<TE>   Even someone who defied fitting into the happy category, Todd
Martin, could depart with an enhanced reputation. Martin was bypassed
for the second consecutive time by McEnroe.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of complaining, Martin took the high road. We already knew
he was a class act but this hit a new level. He isn't one of those
guys who will say the right thing but pop off once the TV cameras
shut down and notepads are closed.</TE>
<TE>   But Pete Sampras may end up the biggest beneficiary. It won't be
known, of course, how this week will influence his 2002 season. He
won a difficult four-setter against teenager Karol Beck, raising his
level at the crucial time, losing only one point in the final two
games.</TE>
<TE>   More so, it was the chance to be appreciated. Elite men's tennis
is a foreign element here, with no tour events, and on local TV and
radio there was the excited tone of: "Pete Sampras is in Oklahoma
City for the first time."</TE>
<TE>   This week in Oklahoma City met his expectations. At 30, you take
motivation where you can get it. He said the carefree attitudes of
his young teammates was "really refreshing."</TE>
<TE>   "You definitely feel the pressure. It's different than playing a
normal tournament," Sampras said. "Not saying these other tournaments
don't mean anything, but there's a sense of urgency through the week.
There's a lot riding on these matches. Some of these events it's
tougher to get that enthusiasm. This week, you have to have that
enthusiasm, you have to have that sense of urgency. I felt it plenty
[Friday]. It just means something. At this point in my career, it has
to be beneficial."</TE>
<TE>   At one point, it looked as though Sampras had played his last
Davis Cup match for the United States in Los Angeles in April 2000.
He was uncomfortable in the brief John McEnroe era. Sampras won't
fire verbal blasts, but it's unlikely he would have returned if
Patrick McEnroe had not replaced John as captain.</TE>
<TE>   "Hard to say," he said. "To say it nicely, it was bad
communication. We got off to a bad start. Pat, I know a bit better.
He's a little bit more my personality, much more low-key.</TE>
<TE>   "Patrick has a good personality for this job. He can mold his
personality around the young guys, the old guys. He's got no ego.
It's not about Pat McEnroe. He's just here to help in any way he can,
very selfless. A true mark of what a good captain should be."</TE>
<TE>   Sampras smiled, slyly,</TE>
<TE>   "They're brothers, but still very different," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The American flag continued to replace the Nike swoosh on his
shirt. In Australia, Sampras made news when he criticized the shoe
and clothing manufacturer for a lack of respect, that is, monetary
respect.</TE>
<TE>   But, surprise, the rare swoosh of controversy has not ended all
communication.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still negotiating with Nike," Sampras said. "There are some
other possibilities. If it's Nike or someone else, I'll be wearing
something reasonably soon."</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, the Sampras building on the Nike campus in Oregon has
not been torn down or renamed Club Roger Federer.</TE>
<TE>   "As of right now, it still has some employees," Sampras said.</TE>
<TE>   Cup Quips</TE>
<TE>   Roddick isn't reluctant to throw out a one-liner or two, even on
the court. Friday, a cell phone went off between his first and second
serve during a tense fourth-set tiebreaker against Jan Kroslak.
Roddick stepped back and muttered, "Tell them I said hello."</TE>
<TE>   Sunday, he imitated Sampras' patented sky-hook smash. "You know,
he's the master of that shot and he's pretty much the inventor of it,
so I had to give him his due props for that one,'' Roddick said</TE>
<TE>   In the second-set tiebreaker, Roddick, upset with a line call,
appealed to chair umpire John Blom: "I mean, do you get paid by the
hour?"</TE>

<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Venus Williams claimed her second title of 2002 when Jelena Dokic
withdrew from Sunday's final of the Gaz de France tournament because
of a strained right thigh.</LD>
<LD>   Williams then hinted again that she might cut her season short to
concentrate on academics.</LD>
<LD>   "I'd like to take the fall off and go to school," she said.</LD>
<TE>   Williams, 22, a student in fashion design at the Florida Art
Institute, has said she feels torn between studies and sports.</TE>
<TE>   "I am somebody who gets bored very easily and if I dedicated all
my time to tennis, it would end up boring me," Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   She won her 23rd career WTA Tour title without hitting a ball.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not really like you've won. But I suppose you're the last
one standing," Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth-seeded Dokic said she was hurt during Saturday's 6-3,
3-6, 6-4 semifinal victory over Monica Seles and aggravated the
injury in a doubles match later that day.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't able to move this morning," Dokic said Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Dokic, who called the injury a muscle tear, also pulled out of the
doubles tournament at Proximus Diamond Games this week in Antwerp.
She still hoped to play in the singles competition there.</TE>

<HD>Looking for Answers After Villanova Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Questions and answers after UCLA's perplexing upset at the hands of
Villanova Saturday:</LD>
<LD>   * Why did the Bruins employ a zone defense when other Villanova
opponents were successful using a man-to-man?</LD>
<LD>   The Bruins play zone most of the time because they aren't quick
enough to play man-to-man. When they overplay ballhandlers on the
perimeter, they get beat off the dribble. Villanova's 6-foot-10
Brooks Sales was able to illustrate this with 21.2 seconds left,
darting by Matt Barnes and drawing a foul from center Dan Gadzuric.
Sales made the free throws for the decisive points.</LD>
<TE>   * Why didn't Bruin Coach Steve Lavin call timeout to get leading
scorer Jason Kapono in the game after Villanova pulled within one
point with 75 seconds to play?</TE>
<TE>   "We only had one timeout left, and with Billy [Knight] and Barnes
in there, we had shooters," Lavin said.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA frittered away 32 seconds, looking nervous and confused, and
Kapono came into the game after Villanova knocked the ball out of
bounds with three on the shot clock.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins called their favorite inbound play in which Kapono
throws in to Barnes, who shovels it back to Kapono for a three-point
shot, but Villanova double-teamed Barnes and Kapono never touched the
ball.</TE>
<TE>   The timeout Lavin did not use to insert Kapono could have been
called with six seconds left when Knight retrieved his missed shot
with UCLA trailing by one. But the Bruin guard hurried an off-balance
shot in front of the Bruin bench.</TE>
<TE>   * Why were Lavin's postgame comments rife with boxing metaphors?</TE>
<TE>   "It was a tale of punch, counter-punch," he said. "Villanova came
out sharp and beat us to the punch. In the second half, both teams
stepped up the intensity. We were down by eight or nine and did a
good job of counter-punching."</TE>
<TE>   The game was as rough as anything in a ring.</TE>
<TE>   And although Villanova Coach Jay Wright saluted UCLA for its
toughness before the game, the Bruins left as black-and-blue as the
shoes they wear.</TE>
<TE>   Rico Hines was elbowed in the face trying to strip a rebound from
Ricky Wright and went down hard. Hines, who only last week ceased
getting headaches related to a concussion, was motionless for 20
seconds, then crawled off the court before timeout was called.</TE>
<TE>   Cedric Bozeman also went down, writhing on the floor after bumping
knees with Wright while attempting to make a steal with 3:16 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Hines returned, Bozeman did not. Both players said afterward that
they are fine, although Bozeman mentioned that his knee had been sore
when he woke up Saturday morning. He had surgery on it in early
December and missed seven games.</TE>

<HD>Granville Still Stunned by Bruin Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Moments after USC's last-second loss to UCLA on Wednesday night,
Trojan senior Brandon Granville sat in the visitor's locker room at
Pauley Pavilion, stared into space and muttered to no one in
particular, "I don't know how to feel."</LD>
<LD>   Two days later, the point guard was still at a loss for words.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know how we get over this," Granville said Friday
afternoon. "I hope we don't dwell on it and we can get past it but I
don't really know how we're going to get over it.</LD>
<TE>   "None of us have really been in this situation before, so close in
three games. It's like, with those three games [as wins], we'd be
19-3 and top 10 in the nation."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the 25th-ranked Trojans are 16-6 overall, 8-4 in the
Pacific 10 Conference and on the verge of falling out of the rankings
before playing Arizona State at the Sports Arena on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Besides falling to UCLA on  Billy Knight's last-second
three-pointer, the Trojans  also lost to Pepperdine on a  Craig
Lewis' banked 23-footer with 2.5 seconds to play on Dec. 6 at the
Forum.</TE>
<TE>   Then, on Jan. 24 at the Sports Arena, California's Brian Wethers
made a turnaround three-pointer from the right corner with time
running down in regulation to send the game into overtime,  in which
Shantay Legans sank a 25-footer at the buzzer to give the Golden
Bears the victory.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just concentrating on buckling down those last minutes of
the game, really concentrate on putting all your energy and focus on
coming out with the victory," Granville said. "We've got to execute
our plays better. We've got to be a little more patient on offense.
But I think we'll be all right, we still have control of our destiny
being one game back [in the loss column.]"</TE>

<LD>Picabo Street's last run comes in today's women's downhill on the
Wildflower course at Snowbasin. The most successful U.S. women's
skier in history, she finished second in this event at Lillehammer in
1994 and won the super-G four years ago at Nagano. But injuries have
taken their toll. In her last season before retirement, she didn't
qualify to defend her super-G title and wasn't considered a serious
contender in the downhill.</LD>
<LD>   Until Saturday. That's when she had the fastest training run.
Teammate Caroline Lalive was second. Italy's Isolde Kostner, the
World Cup downhill champion in 2000-01, remains the favorite. She won
two bronze medals in 1994, in the downhill and the super-G. Other
contenders include Austria's Renate Goetschl and Germany's Hilde
Gerg.</LD>

<LD>The last time Soviets or Russians didn't win the pairs title was in
1960, when Canadians Barbara Wagner and Robert Paul finished with the
gold medal in Squaw Valley. Since then, led by legendary pairs
skaters such as the Protopopovs, Irina Rodnina, Ekaterina Gordeeva
and Sergei Grinkov and Natalia Mishkutenok and Artur Dmitriev, the
gold medal has traveled only between Moscow and St. Petersburg.</LD>
<LD>   But the streak could end tonight, and again it's a pair from
Canada that could win. Russians Anton Sikharulidze and Elena
Berezhnaya were first after Saturday night's short program, just
ahead of Canadians David Pelletier and Jamie Sale. The Canadians
jumped from third to first in the long program to win the 2001 World
Championships.</LD>

<LD>A U.S. woman, Kelly Clark, won the halfpipe Sunday. The U.S. will try
to match that in the men's halfpipe today. Ross Powers is considered
the best bet for the United States, although Tommy Czeschin has been
the most consistent on the World Cup circuit. Sweden's Magnus Sterner
won the World Cup last year, duplicating a feat by his cousin Fredrik
in 1998. Heikki Sorsa of Finland is another to watch.</LD>

<HD>Street Will Try for Final Glory</HD>
<DH>American skier hopes to complete miraculous comeback with a
medal-winning effort.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SNOWBASIN, Utah</DL>
<LD>Picabo Street came back, her way, for this day. She circled Feb. 11
on the calendar the way you would a kid's birthday.</LD>
<LD>   She spoke this week about going out like Michael Jordan, the
second time, winning it all with a last shot and then walking away.</LD>
<LD>   The thing is, Jordan never went through what Street has. His legs
don't look like railroad tracks from all the surgeries. His left
femur never snapped in Crans-Montana. Think MJ has ever been
air-lifted to a hospital out of Switzerland?</LD>
<TE>   The Olympic women's downhill is today at Snowbasin and the miracle
is not that Street is in it.</TE>
<TE>   The miracle is she might win it.</TE>
<TE>   Street needed to mend mentally and physically after her horrendous
downhill crash in March 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Yet here she is, four years later, ready to rip one last run for
Uncle Sam.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Street would scream tears even before finishing World
Cup races. Part of it was fear, part of it was the back-of-the-pack
finishes that made her wonder if she could ever remotely approach
what she once was.</TE>
<TE>   As it stands, it appears Street has worked her way back into medal
contention--bronze, silver, who knows, maybe gold.</TE>
<TE>   There is a lot of polish in Picabo now. Much of the brash brat in
her has been scrubbed clean. She has been Nike-ized and comes
complete with hands-on handlers.</TE>
<TE>   Her time is micro-managed.</TE>
<TE>   Street's strong personality and young-won fame has not always
endeared her to teammates, or coaches, yet there is no getting around
the enormousness of what she has done and, perhaps, is about to do.</TE>
<TE>   After Street took Saturday's first Olympic training run, former
U.S. ski team racer Carrie Sheinberg, working here as a journalist,
looked up from the coral at the base of the downhill and spoke words
she never thought she would say.</TE>
<TE>   "I think she's going to win," Sheinberg said of Street.
"Unbelievable. I think she's going to win."</TE>
<TE>   Street hasn't been a major player on the ski circuit since she
dominated the World Cup downhill in the mid-1990s. Yet she has this
way, like Reggie Jackson, of producing in the clutch.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a competitor is what she is," U.S. slalom star Bode Miller
said of Street. "She's got the American mentality in a nutshell,
something everybody can relate to. She's a lot of fun to watch.
That's why she's so good in the big games."</TE>
<TE>   Street did it at Lillehammer in 1994, when she won a silver medal
in downhill.</TE>
<TE>   She did four years later at Nagano, stealing the gold in
super-giant slalom.</TE>
<TE>   You sense another round of karma coming.</TE>
<TE>   Six months ago, Ron Street, Picabo's dad, cracked open a fortune
cookie after eating Chinese and the fortune said: Someone you know
will make you very proud.</TE>
<TE>   Ron stashed the note in his wallet.</TE>
<TE>   The Wildflower downhill course, naturally, sets up perfectly for
Picabo. The top section is flat, a glider's paradise, and Street can
carry speed downhill like no other. She may be able to build enough
of a time cushion to hold off the others in the remainder of the
course.</TE>
<TE>   The difference between now and Nagano is that Street is not going
it alone. She was the lone American alpine medal winner in Japan, but
enters today's race encircled by teammates who have grown up around
her.</TE>
<TE>   Kirsten Clark, who won a World Cup downhill last year, may be more
of a threat to Street than the Europeans. Caroline LaLive, a pup of
18 in Nagano, has matured into a talented all-event skier and a
potential star.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the faces surrounding Street are familiar ones. No
hot-shot racer, no young Picabos, have risen in her absence.</TE>
<TE>   The international medal threats today--Isolde Kostner of Italy,
Renate Goetschl and Michaela Dorfmeister of Austria, Germany's Hilde
Gerg--are all racers Street has known, befriended and defeated.</TE>
<TE>   Kostner, the World Cup downhill leader, took the bronze behind
Picabo's silver at Lillehammer. In Nagano, Street clipped Dorfmeister
for the super-G gold by one-hundredth of a second.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. women's team as a group seems at ease, on and off the
course. They are rooming together in a home near Snowbasin that comes
equipped with a backyard swing.</TE>
<TE>   "The Americans are very comfortable here," Street said. "We know
the course well."</TE>
<TE>   Not many would argue.</TE>
<TE>   "They know the course much, much better than the other girls,"
Italy's Kostner conceded.</TE>
<TE>   This will almost certainly be Street's last competitive race.</TE>
<TE>   "I know my body can carry me for that but I don't now if my heart
and my mind can carry me for that," she said this week. "I'm really
tired of living out of a bag, and missing my god-daughter and my
nephew grow up. My dogs are getting old and my parents are getting
old and I'm tired of missing it."</TE>
<TE>   So today, Street will streak down the face of Wildflower and try
to make magic one more time.</TE>
<TE>   One last time.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel more support than pressure, I really do," she said. "It's
a hometown crowd and everyone's cheering for me. And it's not like,
'Oh, you better', it's like 'Come on, you can, I hope you do.' To me,
that's way better."</TE>
<TE>   What better way to go out?</TE>
<TE>   As Picabo said, "It's all downhill from here."</TE>

<HD>Austrians Able to Tame Grizzly Course</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SNOWBASIN, Utah</DL>
<LD>An Austrian won the men's Olympic downhill before a snow-packed crowd
of more than 23,000.</LD>
<LD>   So what if it wasn't the favored Austrian.</LD>
<LD>   An American finished in the top 10.</LD>
<TE>   So what if it wasn't the favored American.</TE>
<TE>   There's a reason they race and don't give medals based on
predictions, and there were plenty of twists and turns Sunday on the
Grizzly course.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Fritz Strobl made Austria proud with a gold-medal
winning time of 1 minute 39.13 seconds on a frigid but sun-soaked
slope of 1.95 miles.</TE>
<TE>   Norwegian veteran Lasse Kjus, who figured to be more of a threat
in the upcoming combined, won the silver at 1:39.35 while everybody's
downhill favorite, Austria's Stephan Eberharter, claimed the bronze
with a time of 1:39.41.</TE>
<TE>   Kjus knows all about finishing second. His silver was his 14th
medal in Olympic and world championship competition. Kjus has
finished second 10 times, although he did win the gold in combined at
the 1994 Lillehammer Games.</TE>
<TE>   Kjus seemed happy to break up an Austrian blockade.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that we needed ... one more country on the podium," he
joked.</TE>
<TE>   It was a bad day for one American from Lake Tahoe, Daron Rahlves,
but a good one for another, Marco Sullivan.</TE>
<TE>   Rahlves who appeared to be a medal contender after finishing third
in the first downhill training run, literally took a flying leap off
Flintlock Jump near the top of the course and lost enough time to end
up finishing 16th, 1.71 seconds behind the winner.</TE>
<TE>   "I had some good hang time," Rahlves joked.</TE>
<TE>   Hang time is good in basketball and something to enjoy with family
and friends, but not always a good thing in skiing.</TE>
<TE>   Rahlves, the reigning world champion in super-giant slalom, made a
super mistake when he lifted off from Flintlock and caught wind like
a seagull over a bluff.</TE>
<TE>   "I got huge, huge air," Rahlves said of his huge, huge error. "I
had to fight to stay ahead of it from there on down."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't an all-bagel breakfast for Team USA. Sullivan, a
21-year-old upstart who was not supposed to start making news until
the 2006 Games, popped a sensational run from the 31st starting
position to finish ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Asked afterward what it felt like to finish better than Rahlves,
Sullivan said, "Did I beat Rahlves? All right!"</TE>
<TE>   With Rahlves failing to deliver, the partisan crowd quickly threw
rousing vocal support behind Sullivan as he made tracks toward the
finish line.</TE>
<TE>   "No one expected it," he said. "I ski good under pressure. This is
a huge event. I just charged down the hill as hard as I could. I'm
just stoked I'm in the top 10. That's what I was shooting for."</TE>
<TE>   Top-10 finishes for the Austrians are expected, of course, and the
world's top ski country did not disappoint, placing three skiers
among the top six.</TE>
<TE>   It was only a slight upset that Strobl bested Eberharter for the
gold medal. Eberharter has dominated the World Cup circuit this
season with nine victories, yet Strobl has been perched right behind
his teammate in the downhill standings.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to talk about beating Stephan Eberharter or any
teammate," Strobl said. "I'm not out to beat anybody when I ski."</TE>
<TE>   Strobl was no doubt trying to deflect media criticism for
Eberharter's "failure" to win the Olympic gold.</TE>
<TE>   With Austrian star Hermann Maier out of these Games, the result of
a motorcycle accident last summer, Eberharter was expected to emerge
as the star.</TE>
<TE>   Eberharter did his best to downplay Sunday's result. Finishing
only 0.28 of a second behind Strobl, it wasn't as though he tripped
over his skis.</TE>
<TE>   "I always said life can go a different way," Eberharter said. "I
had a good night, a good morning and a good race. A bronze-medal
race."</TE>
<TE>   Eberharter still has a chance to better Maier's 1998 performance
in Nagano. After crashing in the downhill, Maier rebounded to win the
gold in super-giant slalom and giant slalom. Eberharter will be among
the favorites in both races.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a great start with a bronze," Eberharter said, "I have two
more chances to make medals."</TE>
<TE>   Rahlves also will get a chance at redemption in Saturday's
super-G, his best event.</TE>
<TE>   He defeated Maier and Eberharter in Austria last year to claim the
super-G crown at the world championships.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really disappointed," Rahlves said of his 16th-place finish
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "I came out here to be the fastest man on the mountain today. I'm
still kind of in a daze, I'm not letting it sink in too much. It's
tough. It was the biggest race of my career today. It's a good thing
I've got the super-G coming up next Saturday."</TE>
<TE>   Two other Americans finished in the top 30. Jakub Fiala was 27th
in a time of 1:41.84 and Scott Macartney was 29th in 1:41.86.</TE>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>I've been watching NBC all of my life--from Dave Garroway and J. Fred
Muggs on "Today" to Johnny Carson and Jay Leno on the "Tonight Show,"
from Huntley &amp; Brinkley and John Chancellor to Tom Brokaw, from
"Dragnet" and "Columbo" to "Law &amp; Order," from Curt Gowdy to Bob
Costas, from "Laugh-In" to "Cheers," "Seinfeld" and "Friends."</LD>
<LD>   Believe me, I have no problem with the peacock network. Except
every other year when NBC televises an Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   I am appalled by what I have not seen on television in Salt Lake
City.</LD>
<TE>   Now it's possible I am in the minority. Most of you, no doubt,
were braced for the coverage of the Winter Olympics because of the
experience from the Summer Olympics two years ago in Australia. I,
however, was not subjected to NBC's coverage from Sydney because I
was there, watching Australian television, which has an interesting
definition for the word "live." It means live.</TE>
<TE>   Costas made a funny joke during the opening ceremony here Friday
night about all the NBC-bashing in Australia. When the Australian
team marched into the stadium during the parade of nations, he said,
"I've been waiting a year-and-a-half to say this: It's Australia and
we're live."</TE>
<TE>   That led me to believe that NBC had learned the error of its ways
and would make an effort to televise as much of the Salt Lake City
Games as possible, or at least the big-ticket events, live.</TE>
<TE>   How naive of me.</TE>
<TE>   I woke up Sunday morning to watch the men's downhill, which, to
many Europeans and Scandinavians, is the marquee event of the Winter
Olympics, as significant as the men's 100 meters is in the Summer
Olympics to Americans. Even without Hermann Maier here, a whole bunch
of Austrians were favored to win medals, but I thought perhaps
Californian Daron Rahlves could pull an upset the way Bill Johnson
and Tommy Moe had in previous Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   It began at 10 a.m. MST.</TE>
<TE>   I turned the channel to the local NBC affiliate, which was airing
a travel show featuring the Houstonian Hotel in Texas.</TE>
<TE>   That was OK because I knew that the network had farmed out some
events to CNBC and MSNBC.</TE>
<TE>   I turned to CNBC, which was airing an infomercial featuring
Vanessa Williams selling an acne cream.</TE>
<TE>   Last chance. I turned to MSNBC. I can't complain about most of
what I found there, a compelling interview with Yasser Arafat and the
latest news from Israel and Afghanistan. Certainly, all of that takes
precedence over the men's downhill.</TE>
<TE>   But I thought that I might at least learn the latest results from
the Olympics by following the news scroll under the picture.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the scroll reported that U.S. athletes and Port Authority
police officers and firefighters had carried the U.S. flag from the
World Trade Center into the stadium during the opening ceremony and
that Mike Eruzione and the 1980 U.S. hockey team had been chosen to
light the caldron--36 hours before!--and that Italy's Stefania
Belmondo had won the Games' first gold medal and that Shannon Bahrke
had won the United States' first medal--almost 24 hours before! There
was nothing about the events taking place Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   For that, I had to turn to ESPN, which, unlike NBC, is not paying
hundreds of millions of dollars, or even a hundred cents, to bring
you news of the Games.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, ESPN, unlike NBC, is not going to make millions of
dollars off the Games, either.</TE>
<TE>   If you are an NBC stockholder, you will not be too agitated about
any of this. Dick Ebersol, the network's sports president, is a good
businessman (the XFL notwithstanding). NBC made a lot of money in
Australia and, if the first two days of ratings from here are an
indication, will make a lot of money in Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   He also is considered a friend of the Olympic movement, having
been awarded the Olympic Order a few years ago. But, although he
would vehemently disagree, I think he sells the athletes short.</TE>
<TE>   He wouldn't dare tape-delay most sports events. You saw the NBA
All-Star game Sunday on NBC when it happened. You will see the
Daytona 500 next Sunday on NBC when it happens. You will see Notre
Dame football games next fall on NBC when they happen.</TE>
<TE>   You will see Olympic events on NBC whenever NBC thinks you should
see them, polished and packaged like a variety show.</TE>
<TE>   Isn't it ironic that Ebersol made his bones at NBC with a show
called "Saturday Night Live?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NBC finally began televising events Sunday at noon, although not
the men's downhill. The first segment, before the network broke away
for the NBA All-Star game, lasted two hours. It ended with Hannah
Storm telling us to tune in Sunday night to see how U.S. snowboarder
Kelly Clark fared in the women's halfpipe.</TE>
<TE>   I felt bad for Storm because no one informed her that the women's
halfpipe had been finished for about an hour and that Clark had won.
I guess Storm should have been watching Australian television.</TE>

<DH>1924 Winter Games Bear Little Resemblance to 2002 Model</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL DWYRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The principle has been the same from the start: If it works on ice or
snow, it works in the Winter Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   Over the years, the Winter Games have included sports such as
motorcycle racing, skiing while being pulled by reindeer, and even
ballooning--apparently the only connection between ice and snow and
ballooning was that you eventually had to land on one or the other.</LD>
<LD>   Little has been predictable, simple or unemotional in the 79-year
history of this cold-weather sporting extravaganza that started with
the 1924 Games in Chamonix, France, and fittingly, wasn't even
officially designated an Olympics until two years later.</LD>
<TE>   The history of the Winter Olympics represents thousands of people,
including visionaries, pioneers, heroes and even some villains. That
history continues with the 19th Winter edition, the 2002 Salt Lake
City Games.</TE>
<TE>   But with a price tag of $1.9 billion to stage and an NBC rights
fee of $545 million to televise, perhaps the only constant from
Chamonix in 1924 to Salt Lake City in 2002 is, well, ice and snow.</TE>
<TE>   Nordic Games Holdout</TE>
<TE>   Were Viktor Balck of Sweden to look in on the proceedings of the
next two weeks, he would probably be furious.</TE>
<TE>   At the turn of the century, Balck was one of the original members
of the International Olympic Committee. The nurturing care and
feeding of the Olympic movement was his duty. But his passion was
Sweden's Nordic Games. They were a driving force for nationalism and
commercialism and reflected the lifestyle high in the Northern
hemisphere, where summer, some years, was just a rumor.</TE>
<TE>   Opera and theater were included in Balck's Nordic Games in those
years. But it was skaters and skiers who captured the public's
fancy--and eventually the fancy of the IOC, which had been running
Summer Games since 1896 in Athens.</TE>
<TE>   Balck resisted the IOC's advances. And for several years, the IOC
appeared sympathetic to the wishes of Balck and the Swedes to keep
the exclusivity of this winter cash cow.</TE>
<TE>   But even back then, the IOC had a sharp eye for enriching its
coffers.</TE>
<TE>   When the IOC announced that it would hold a "Winter Sports
Festival" in Chamonix in 1924, it promised not to tread on the Nordic
Games. It even banned the phrase "Winter Olympic Games" during the
festival, which was a success.</TE>
<TE>   The IOC voted in 1926 to retroactively refer to the festival as
the first Olympic Winter Games. That year also marked the last Nordic
Games. It had little chance of survival after the IOC's revisionist
history, none after Balck died in 1928.</TE>
<TE>   And so, what was born in a meeting room--albeit two years after
the fact--became a regular Olympic undertaking, missing only the war
years of 1940 and '44 and becoming only a slightly scaled-down
version of its aesthetically, commercially and politically successful
big brother, the Summer Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   A Vehicle in U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Before Salt Lake, the United States had been host of three Winter
Olympics: the 1932 Games in Lake Placid, the 1960 Games in Squaw
Valley and the 1980 Games, which returned to Lake Placid.</TE>
<TE>   The '32 Games were the vision of Dr. Godfrey Dewey, who saw an
opportunity to strike it rich in the tiny hamlet in the Adirondack
Mountains that his father developed into the first U.S. winter
resort. But financing was a mess, those being the Depression years,
and the project foundered until then-New York Gov. Franklin Delano
Roosevelt agreed to attend.</TE>
<TE>   Roosevelt's opponent in the next presidential election, incumbent
President Herbert Hoover, had declined the invitation, missing what
turned out to be widespread media exposure. Roosevelt's wife,
Eleanor, even got in on the act, taking a highly publicized bobsled
run before the Games began.</TE>
<TE>   Roosevelt later beat Hoover, and historians have made much of
Roosevelt's use of the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   When Alexander Cushing coaxed the IOC to come to Squaw Valley,
there wasn't much there except for a chairlift, two rope tows and a
hotel. Cushing, not coincidentally, owned the hotel. Unincorporated,
Squaw Valley didn't have a mayor to travel to Cortina, Italy, to
triumphantly participate in the closing ceremony of the 1956
Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, at a cost of $20 million that was absorbed primarily
by the state of California, an Olympics rose out of the valley, which
became, as one writer put it, "Another Disneyland, an artfully
created artificial environment." CBS paid $50,000 to televise the
events, and it enjoyed a Disney-produced opening ceremony that
included a 1,200-piece band and the release of 2,000 pigeons, some of
which stayed around for the duration of the Games, providing numerous
unhappy distractions.</TE>
<TE>   Much to the chagrin of Olympic purists, Hollywood followed. Stars
such as Art Linkletter did nightly shows during the Games.</TE>
<TE>   Cushing, who started it all, fell into disfavor with Olympic
organizers over cost overruns and was replaced by a San Francisco
businessman. For his efforts, Cushing received two free tickets to
the Games along with his walking papers.</TE>
<TE>   The Games returned to Lake Placid in 1980 after Finland,
Vancouver, and Chamonix bowed out. Funding was a concern until the
Federal Bureau of Prisons gave $47 million to construct Olympic
buildings that would be turned over to it after the Games.</TE>
<TE>   Those Olympics will be forever etched in the public's mind by the
words of sportscaster Al Michaels, who asked as the U.S. hockey team
won an impossible gold medal: "Do you believe in miracles?"</TE>
<TE>   But to those who were there, memories of transportation problems
may be as vivid.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of spectators were left standing for hours in the
freezing cold while the ill-prepared Lake Placid organizers tried to
get buses to them. This prompted the now-famous observation from New
York Times sportswriter Dave Anderson, who wrote: "The good news is
that the Soviet Union is ready to withdraw its troops from
Afghanistan. The bad news is that the Lake Placid Organizing
Committee has the contract to bus them out."</TE>
<TE>   Prime Time in the Rink</TE>
<TE>   Figure skating has generated some of the biggest headlines from
the Winter Games. But it was originally part of the Summer Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Skater Ulrich Salchow won the gold during the 1908 Games in London
and tried to repeat at age 42 in Antwerp. Salchow jumped and spun,
then hit the rail, suffering an injury and the loss of a medal. One
of the sport's moves is named after him, but his fame has taken on
new proportions through the magic of television advertising, which
puts him, figuratively, in the same boat with NFL hall of famer
Lawrence Taylor, Olympic figure skating gold medalist Brian Boitano
and somebody in a clown head selling burgers.</TE>
<TE>   Salchow's crash was about as violent as it got in figure skating,
until the era of Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan, pre-Lillehammer
1994.</TE>
<TE>   Harding was rough-around-the-edges, learning how to change the oil
in her car and shoot deer well before becoming a world-class figure
skater. Kerrigan was almost Barbie-doll-like in appearance, poised
and skilled in performance.</TE>
<TE>   As Olympic team selection drew closer, Harding complained about
her chances to her husband, who came up with a plan. A month before
the Games, Kerrigan stepped off the ice after a practice session in
Detroit and was confronted by a burly man who whacked her on the knee
with an iron rod.</TE>
<TE>   Amid one of sports' biggest media circuses, Kerrigan recovered to
compete in the Games and win the silver. Harding, who was later found
to be knowledgeable of the plot, finished eighth.</TE>
<TE>   The grace and charm of the sport was symbolized best by Sonja
Henie of Norway, who was there when women's figure skating was
unveiled as a Winter Olympic sport at Chamonix. Herma Planck-Szabo of
Austria won that gold in 1924, but in eighth place was 11-year-old
Henie, who received much notice with her spins and jumps.</TE>
<TE>   She won gold medals at the next three Winter Olympics, retired at
age 23 to go to Hollywood, signed with 20th Century Fox and made one
successful movie and nine bad ones. Along the way, she married New
York Yankee owner Dan Topping, divorced him and went back home to
Norway, where she married her childhood sweetheart. When she died of
leukemia at age 57, she was worth $43 million.</TE>
<TE>   The closest thing to Henie's male counterpart in figure skating is
American Dick Button, who won the gold in 1948 and '52 and dazzled
the skating world with a successful triple loop. Button went on to a
successful broadcasting career, continuing today.</TE>
<TE>   Speedskating Saga</TE>
<TE>   Speedskating also has had its years as a glamour sport.</TE>
<TE>   Lydia Skoblikova of the Soviet Union won a total of six gold
medals in the 1960 and '64 Games, more than any woman. Bonnie Blair
of the United States won five golds and a total of six medals in the
1988, '92 and '94 Games, most for any American woman. American Eric
Heiden managed five golds in 1980 alone.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the best-known competitor in Olympic speedskating is
American Dan Jansen, who dominated world events in the '80s and early
'90s but skated a long, cruel road in quest of Olympic gold.</TE>
<TE>   Favored to win at least two gold medals in Calgary in 1988, he was
told on the eve of his first race that his sister, Jane, had died
after a long illness. Jansen started the 500 meters, slipped and
fell. No medal. After leaving the Games to attend the funeral, he
returned, started the 1,000 meters, slipped and fell. No medal.</TE>
<TE>   He tried again in Albertville, France, in '92, but skated poorly,
finishing fourth and 26th.</TE>
<TE>   In Lillehammer, his story was so well documented that his every
step, or misstep, became headlines, Jansen entered the 500, slipped
again and finished eighth. That left him with one more race in his
Olympic career, the 1,000. He bobbled again on the second-last turn,
nearly falling as the crowd audibly gasped in horror. But a
determined Jansen recovered, picked up speed and crossed the finish
line, not only with a gold medal, but in world-record time.</TE>
<TE>   The sports world stood, cheered and celebrated. Then it sobbed as
Jansen interrupted his victory lap to pick up his infant daughter and
carry her as he skated. She was named Jane, after his late sister.</TE>
<TE>   Ski It to Believe It</TE>
<TE>   Two Americans named Bill, mountains apart in personality, brought
their share of drama to the Games.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Johnson, a brash downhill skier who hadn't been considered at
all until he won a World Cup race a few months before the '84 Games
in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, told the world on the eve of the Olympic
event: "Everybody else should just aim for second place."</TE>
<TE>   That infuriated the Europeans, who had dominated the event--no
U.S. man had won a medal in downhill, much less a gold--and Johnson
was labeled a cocky Yank. He fulfilled his prediction, but his feat
was dismissed because it was achieved on what the Europeans said was
an easy course. To which Johnson replied, "If it was so easy, why
didn't they win?"</TE>
<TE>   There was no such bravado from Bill Koch, a cross-country skier
from Vermont, who, in the '76 Games in Innsbruck turned in a
silver-medal performance in the 30-kilometer cross country event.
Koch's medal was so far out of the realm of possibility--it was the
first medal, and the only one to date, for an American in
cross-country--that no member of the U.S. media witnessed it.</TE>
<TE>   According to David Wallechinsky in "The Complete Book of the
Winter Olympics," when a reporter finally chased Koch down and asked
him if he had lived in Vermont all his life, Koch responded with the
classic, "Not yet."</TE>
<TE>   Koch made a symbolic comeback of sorts in Albertville, finishing
42nd. Johnson attempted a comeback last year, but crashed and
suffered severe injuries.</TE>
<TE>   If Johnson was a rough-cut swashbuckler, a more refined version
was handsome Frenchman Jean-Claude Killy, who won the triple crown of
Alpine skiing, the slalom, combined slalom and downhill, during his
home games at Grenoble in 1968. Then, 24 years later, he led the
effort to bring the Games back to France by convincing the IOC that a
nondescript city in the midst of the French Alps was an ideal place
from which to send athletes into competition. The '92 Games went to
Albertville--and the surrounding Savoy.</TE>
<TE>   Around the Edges</TE>
<TE>   Viewers may enjoy the next two weeks of Winter Olympics with the
knowledge that they have something for everybody:</TE>
<TE>   There was a curmudgeon:</TE>
<TE>   * Former IOC President Avery Brundage, who railed for years about
the sins of commercialism intruding on his image of purity and
amateurism, especially disliked the winter version of his Olympics
because of its many opportunities for brand identification decals on
skis and jackets. The aristocratic American banned a number of skiers
over the years for endorsing products, and once called Alpine skiing
"a poisonous tumor to be immediately operated on."</TE>
<TE>   No perceived violation was too small for Brundage to ferret out.
When Canadian figure skater Barbara Ann Scott won a gold medal in the
1947 World Championships, becoming the first North American to do so,
friends gave her a yellow convertible. Brundage said keeping it would
make her a professional and demanded that she give it back. She did,
in tears, but after winning the Olympic gold in the '48 Olympics in
St. Moritz, she turned pro and reclaimed it.</TE>
<TE>   There has been international intrigue:</TE>
<TE>   * A German bobsledder alienated his teammates during the 1992
Games by admitting that he had been an informer for the East German
secret police.</TE>
<TE>   * In 1960, when the U.S. hockey team was performing its first
miracle on ice, it had to beat Czechoslovakia in the final and was
trailing, 4-3, after two periods. The Soviet captain, whose team was
no longer in the running but who hated the Czechs more than the
Americans, found his way into the U.S. locker room between periods
and suggested that the Americans take oxygen in the altitude at Squaw
Valley. They did, scored six goals and won, 9-4.</TE>
<TE>   There has been international embarrassment:</TE>
<TE>   * In '64 at Innsbruck, the hockey game between Sweden and Canada
was disrupted when Sweden's Karl Oberg bashed the Canadian coach,
Father David Bauer, a Catholic priest, over the head with his stick.
In a remarkable show of poise and restraint, Father Bauer did not
allow his team to retaliate and the referee was eventually suspended
for failing to penalize Oberg.</TE>
<TE>   * In Nagano 34 years later, the embarrassment was American, when
its hockey team, the first group of pros to participate under new
rules, fared poorly and then trashed their rooms in the athletes'
village.</TE>
<TE>   There has been heroism, some of it away from the predictable areas
of competition:</TE>
<TE>   * In 1932 in Lake Placid, American Billy Fiske drove his bobsled
team to a gold medal. But earlier in the competition, the German
bobsled team had crashed, wrecking the sled and injuring teammates.
Fiske led efforts to scrounge up extra bobsled parts and recruited
members of the nearby German-American community to man the German
sled. Fiske later became the first American to die in World War II
when his plane was shot down by the Germans.</TE>
<TE>   * The Austrian Army came to the rescue in Innsbruck when Mother
Nature failed to provide snow in the days before the '64 Games.
Soldiers drove to snowy areas, shoveled the snow into trucks and
unloaded it on the hills.</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, there has been love:</TE>
<TE>   * In the '72 Games, the Soviet figure skating pairs team of Irina
Rodnina and Aleksei Ulanov beat another Soviet team, of Lyudmila
Smirnova and Andrei Suraikin. But Ulanov had become romantically
involved with Smirnova, and so the joy of the final result was
tempered by personal feelings and emotion. Rodnina, who shared the
gold with Ulanov, skated off the ice in tears.</TE>
<TE>   * And then there was Katarina Witt, the German beauty who had won
her first figure skating gold medal in 1984 in Sarajevo. While she
was in the process of defending that title in Calgary in 1988,
Alberto Tomba, the Italian skiing sensation, was in the process of
falling in love, or at least in lust.</TE>
<TE>   One night, deciding to plead his case in person, Tomba showed up
at the figure skating venue and wrote a note that he had passed to
Witt.</TE>
<TE>   Cupid didn't connect. Tomba had spelled Katarina's name wrong.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

Foundation library in Los Angeles; publications used include "The CBS
History of the Olympic Winter Games"; "The First Winter Olympics" by
John Lucas, Penn State University; "The Nordic Games and Origins of
the Olympic Winter Games" by Ron Edgeworth; "The Complete Book of
Winter Olympics" by David Wallechinsky and "Historical Dictionary of

<LD>There was some serious second-guessing after Slovakia's 6-6 tie with

<LD>   There was second-guessing of Slovakian Jan Filc's decision to use
Ziggy Palffy against Germany on Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   There was even second-guessing of Filc's future with the team--by
Filc himself.</TE>
<TE>   There's no future for the team in this tournament, not after the
tie dropped Slovakia to 0-1-1 in Group A qualification round play.
The Slovaks had to win their two remaining games in the round-robin
competition to have any prayer of advancing after losing to Germany,
which is 2-0-0 and the group's leading candidate for the spot in the
final round.</TE>
<TE>   Their situation was so desperate even when they fell behind by two
goals to Germany that Filc sent Palffy in midway through the game,
even though the Kings had told Slovakia that Palffy would only be
available Sunday. Palffy didn't even get a shot on goal in that game,
and to appease the Kings (and prevent Palffy from having to play a
total of three King games and two Olympic games in five nights) he
was not in uniform on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Filc doesn't think his services will be required after this
disappointing week.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it will cost also my coaching chair," Filc said. "That's
a reality."</TE>
<TE>   Slovakia did have the use of King Lubomir Visnovsky. He missed the
Kings' game in Phoenix Friday with an injury and played sparingly
Saturday but he was of full service Sunday and even scored a goal.</TE>
<TE>   More reinforcements from the NHL arrived, in the form of Marian
Hossa (Ottawa), Pavol Demitra (St. Louis) and former King Jozef
Stumpel (Boston). Each scored a goal Sunday as Slovakia built a 6-3
lead.</TE>
<TE>   But Latvia scored a goal with four seconds remaining in the second
period and two more in the third.</TE>

<HD>Biathlon Events Showcase Difficult Mix of Skills</HD>

<LD>Biathlon combines the contradictory challenges of skiing fast and
calming the heartbeat for accurate rifle shooting. The best place to
watch races at the Soldier Hollow venue is inside the stadium, where
both the shooting targets and the cross-country course can be
observed.</LD>
<LD>   The best seats in the stadium afford an unimpeded look at the row
of four-centimeter wide targets. The Olympic biathlon begins today
with the women's 15-kilometer individual race and the men's 20k
individual race. The start and finish areas are in front of the
grandstand and so is the shooting range. The racers slip the
.22-caliber rifles off their backs as they approach the range and set
up in either the prone or standing positions. As they lift the
rifles, they are taking aim at a target 50 meters away.</LD>
<LD>   Some competitors shoot at the five targets from right to left and
some choose to shoot left to right. They shoot according to their
preference. However, they must shoot at the targets in order. If a
target is missed, the shooter must go on to the next target.</LD>
<TE>   Spectators in the grandstand will be able to see all of the
shooting, the starts, which are staggered at 30-second intervals, and
the finish line. Both because of the staggered start and penalties
levied for missed targets, the gold, silver and bronze medalists will
not be readily apparent. In longer biathlon races such as these, a
one-minute time penalty is assessed for each miss. In shorter
biathlon races, the athlete must complete a 150-meter penalty loop
for each miss.</TE>
<TE>   In some biathlon races, fans routinely either ski along the course
to different vantage points, or walk to a choice location, but that
will not be allowed during the Olympics. There is a secondary
standing spectator area in the so-called "lower meadow" of Soldier
Hollow that permits viewing of some portions of the skiing. However,
all views of the shooting range are blocked by the cross-country
stadium, which shares the venue.</TE>
<TE>   Biathlon's roots date to 1776, when the first competition was
organized along the Norway-Sweden border. The first military patrol
race using the skiing and shooting skills was held in Germany in 1902
and a military ski patrol exhibition was part of the first Winter
Games in Chamonix in 1924.</TE>
<TE>   Biathlon involving civilian athletes was accepted into the Games
for men in 1960 in Squaw Valley, Calif. The first women's Olympic
events were held in 1992.</TE>

<HD>Heidt Will Let It Slide</HD>
<DH>He's within reach of being first American to medal in
event, but he'll need competitor to slip up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARRY TEMKIN</AU>
<BD>TRIBUNE OLYMPIC BUREAU</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>Adam Heidt has learned from experience.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, he is within striking distance of history.</LD>
<LD>   Heidt finished the first two runs of the men's singles luge
competition Sunday at Utah Olympic Park in fourth place, 0.72 of a
second from a bronze medal. No U.S. competitor has won a medal in
Olympic singles luge.</LD>
<TE>   It will probably take a slip-up by two-time silver medalist Markus
Prock in today's final two runs for Heidt to slip past the Austrian
into third, but the 24-year-old from Northport, N.Y., wasn't counting
himself out after strong runs accompanied by fans' shouts of "U-S-A."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just going to go out and slide my best," he said. "I think I
have a great chance."</TE>
<TE>   Italy's Armin Zoeggeler has a pretty good chance himself to end
the dynasty of Germany's Georg Hackl. Hackl, trying to become the
first Winter Olympian to win four consecutive gold medals in the same
individual event, trailed Zoeggeler by 0.041 despite setting a track
record of 44.494 seconds on his second run.</TE>
<TE>   Heidt's performance Sunday seemed surprising, given his 13th-place
finish on the 2001-02 World Cup circuit, but he placed fifth in the
cup finale in Winterberg, Germany, late last month and was second to
Hackl in the final training run here Saturday. Even Hackl mentioned
him as a potential medalist.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything just came together for me," Heidt said. "I knew I
could do it."</TE>
<TE>   A big reason he knew is that he finally knew what to expect. In
the 1998 Games in Nagano, Japan, Heidt was, by his own description,
bedazzled--largely by the decibel level of the Olympic-size crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "There was really nothing that could have prepared me for what I
was about to face," he said last week, explaining his ninth-place
finish.</TE>
<TE>   The secret to Olympic success, he realized through work with a
sports psychologist, was to relax and focus. And the success of that
approach was evident Sunday not only in his total time of 1:29.410
but also in his post-race attitude.</TE>
<TE>   He dismissed today's competition as "just another race" and almost
seemed to buy it. And he steadfastly refused to be drawn into
describing what winning the United States' first singles luge medal
would mean to him.</TE>
<TE>   "Can I let you know tomorrow if it happens?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   With a 0.075-second lead over fifth-place Karsten Albert of
Germany, Heidt at the very least is poised to achieve the best U.S.
men's singles finish ever. Wendel Suckow placed fifth for the U.S. in
1994 at Lillehammer, Norway.</TE>
<TE>   Hackl won his second gold medal in Lillehammer, but poor starts
Sunday may cost him his fourth. The 35-year-old, whose starts are
hampered by an old back injury, spotted Zoeggeler a 0.05 total
advantage in starts Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "My goal is still a medal, but I made too many mistakes today,"
Hackl said through a spokesman after finishing the day with a time of
1:29.108. "I'm very satisfied with my second run, but not with my
starting time."</TE>
<TE>   Zoeggeler, 28, chased Hackl at the last two Olympics, winning
silver in 1998 and bronze in 1994. He won only one of the six
training runs while Hackl was winning three, but Sunday Zoeggeler
showed he may finally overtake the master.</TE>
<TE>   Zoeggeler pronounced himself satisfied Sunday with his 1:29.067
but has seen enough of Hackl to know that his first gold medal is far
from won.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything can happen tomorrow," he said, also through a spokesman.
"I think it will be decided on the fourth run."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Is Gaining Ground</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SOLDIER HOLLOW, Utah</DL>
<LD>Until the day a U.S. athlete can claim supremacy in nordic
combined--or even claim an Olympic medal--Todd Lodwick will have to
be satisfied with Americans' expertise in other sports.</LD>
<LD>   "Do you watch a lot of the Norwegians?" he said. "They don't have
a clue how to throw a football. It's pathetic."</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps, but at least that adjective no longer applies to U.S.
skiers' results in nordic combined.</LD>
<TE>   Lodwick, of Steamboat Springs, Colo., finished seventh in the
European-dominated event Sunday, the best result by a U.S. Olympian
since Rolf Monsen finished ninth at the 1932 Lake Placid Games. He
was seventh after Saturday's ski jumping and hoped to move up on the
strength of his skiing ability, but he didn't have enough of his
usual fortitude to gain any ground in the 15-kilometer cross-country
race.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a difficult day for myself," he said. "I had very high
expectations going into these Olympic Games. A little bit more luck
[Saturday] on the jumping hill, a little bit more luck on the
cross-country course and maybe I get a medal."</TE>
<TE>   The gold medal was won by Samppa Lajunen of Finland. A silver
medalist four years ago at Nagano in the individual and team nordic
events, the 22-year-old part-time rock guitarist made up a 53-second
deficit on a frigid but brilliantly sunny day with a total time of 39
minutes 11.7 seconds. A lively crowd filled the stands and cheered
throughout the race, ringing cowbells and chanting for various
favorites.</TE>
<TE>   "That was one of the best competitions I've ever skied," Lajunen
said. "After the last World Cup [a 15th-place finish at Liberec,
Czech Republic Jan. 18], I was not feeling very good or very
confident, but for the last two weeks my training has been perfect."</TE>
<TE>   Jaakko Tallus of Finland, the leader after the ski jumping,
finished second, 24.7 seconds behind. Austria's Felix Gottwald, who
defied conventional wisdom by training at sea level and vacationing
in Miami before the Games, finished third. An outstanding skier,
Gottwald used a strong finishing kick to move up from 11th after the
ski jumping to finish 54.8 seconds behind Lajunen.</TE>
<TE>   The other U.S. entrants had mixed results. Bill Demong of
Vermontville, N.Y., eighth after ski jumping, faded to 19th. But Matt
Dayton of Breckenridge, Colo., moved from 33rd to 18th, posting the
seventh-best time on the cross-country course. Johnny Spillane of
Steamboat Springs fell from 26th to 35th. "One of the things this
group always does is we have our expectations right up there with
everyone else's," U.S. Coach Tom Steitz said. "The results aren't
very good, but [Lodwick's finish] is the best result ever. As long as
we continue with a positive attitude, we'll keep getting better."</TE>
<TE>   Lodwick, 25, won a World Cup event in December and finished in the
top 10 in nine events this season. Everything would have had to fall
into place for him to move up Sunday, and he knew early in the race
he faced a tough battle.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to ski relaxed the first couple of laps and maintain some
speed," he said. "When Felix passed me going into the second lap, it
was a little demoralizing because I knew I had to catch four people
to get to the podium. He made it five.</TE>
<TE>   "When he passed me and made up 40 seconds, that took a little wind
out of my sails."</TE>
<TE>   Although understandably deflated, he looked at the positive
aspects of owning the best-ever U.S. Olympic finish.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not very, very, very happy with my result, but I'm definitely
satisfied," he said. "When I crossed the finish line, even though I
was disappointed in my racing, I was seventh. I was happy with my
finish."</TE>
<TE>   That will have to suffice for now, but Steitz believes it won't be
long before U.S. skiers won't have to settle for moral victories.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the last few years, our seasons have been full of
first-ever things," he said. "We had two people win World Cup events
[Lodwick and Demong]. Up until five or six years ago we had never won
a medal at the world juniors, and in the last seven years we've won
five medals. It's turning around, and it takes more time.</TE>
<TE>   "Ten or 12 years ago none of the other nations knew we were alive.
Now, other coaches are friends of mine and they're very afraid of us.
I talked to the Austrian and German [coaches] and they asked me how
Todd was doing. They lay awake at night worrying about us."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze of Russia, who lead the pairs
figure skating competition, apparently feel no pressure to continue
their country's Olympic pairs winning streak tonight.</LD>
<LD>   Skaters from the former Soviet Union and Russia have monopolized
the pairs title at every Olympics starting with the 1964 Innsbruck
Games. However, Berezhnaya said she and Sikharulidze are looking
forward, not back.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't count how many years everybody won," she said. "We are
here to compete. I don't think about a thousand years ago. We just do
what we have to do."</LD>
<TE>   Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze, who train at the same rink in
Hackensack, N.J., as do U.S. champions Kyoko Ina and John Zimmerman,
will skate second in the final group tonight after fellow Russians
Tatiana Totmianina and Maxim Marinin. Skating third will be world
champions Jamie Sale and David Pelletier of Canada, who were second
after the short program, and Xue Shen and Hongbo Zhao of China, who
are third in the standings.</TE>
<TE>   Any of the top three couples can win the gold medal by being
ranked first in the long program, which is worth two-thirds of the
final score.</TE>
<TE>   Ina and Zimmerman, who were ranked fifth in the short program,
will skate 13th. The other U.S. entry, Tiffany Scott and Philip
Dulebohn, ranked 11th, will skate 10th.</TE>
<TE>   Zimmerman said he's hopeful the pair can move up, although he
knows winning a medal will require luck, ability and competitors'
mistakes. Zimmerman said the strengths of their long program,
performed to variations on a theme of Niccolo Paganini orchestrated
by Sergei Rachmaninov, are "originality and the type of athleticism
and artistry we put out [that] are our own."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   U.S. figure skating champion Todd Eldredge seems to be lucky when
it comes to drawing for the starting order at competitions,
invariably getting a late enough position to avoid risking a
quadruple jump.</TE>
<TE>   Eldredge's luck continued Sunday when he drew the 25th of 29
positions for the men's short program, which will be contested
Tuesday. Fellow Americans Timothy Goebel drew 20th and Michael Weiss
first, an unfortunate position because the judges tend to hold back
on their marks in case someone dazzles them later.</TE>
<TE>   World champion Evgeny Plushenko of Russia drew 18th and his
countryman and predecessor as world champion, Alexei Yagudin, will
skate 14th.</TE>
<TE>   Fellow Russian Alexander Abt, who was second to Yagudin at the
European championships, will skate 24th. Abt trains at Lake
Arrowhead.</TE>
<TE>   The final skater will be two-time Olympic silver medalist Elvis
Stojko of Canada. The men's competition will conclude Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Picabo Street finished seventh Sunday in her final training run
before today's women's downhill. Street finished first in Saturday's
first training run.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to walk out of here with the heat on my shoulders
like I did yesterday," Street said. "So, it's like, let everybody
else lose sleep tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Austria's Renate Goetschl, one of the favorites, won the final
training run. Street was the top U.S. finisher, followed by Caroline
Lalive (13th).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For the second night in a row, three of the top seven television
markets came from the Pacific time zone.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday night's coverage from Salt Lake City generated a national
rating of 17.1 with a 30% share of the audience, and the top three
rated markets were, in order, Salt Lake City (37.2/59), Seattle
(24.7/42) and Portland (24.2/40). Sacramento (21.5/36) ranked
seventh. Los Angeles ranked 26th with a 17.0/29 and San Francisco
ranked 17th with an 18.5/35.</TE>
<TE>   The 17.1 national rating represents a 39% increase over the 12.3
CBS got for its second night of Winter Olympics coverage from Nagano,
Japan, in 1998. NBC's two-night average is a 21.5/36, a 45% increase
over CBS' two-night average of 14.8/26 at Nagano.</TE>

<KH>Mike Penner THE DAY IN SALT LAKE</KH>
<HD>At Least, They Are Genuine Losers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Penner</AU>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Here's to the losers:</LD>
<LD>   (Who are not to be confused with the lugers, unless they're
competing against Germany's three-time Olympic champion Georg Hackl.
In that case, they're usually one and the same.)</LD>
<LD>   Winners at the Olympics get the nicest medals, get the best spot
on the podium, get their national anthem played for them, get to be
interviewed by some overheated ("You really rocked out there!") NBC
field reporter and get their pictures in the next day's newspapers.
And what do they give back in return? Just a lot of platitudes and
thank-yous and it-feels-greats and
sorry-that's-my-agent-on-my-cell-phone-nows.</LD>
<TE>   Losers give the Olympics life. They are generally not happy, so
manners matter less to them. They have failed at something for which
they have trained for years, so honest emotions flood freely from the
heart.</TE>
<TE>   They gripe. They grouse. They lament. They wallow in the mire.</TE>
<TE>   They give Olympic columnists great fodder.</TE>
<TE>   "You just want to chop your legs off and toss them in the garbage"
was U.S. speedskater Jennifer Rodriguez's reaction to finishing
seventh Sunday in the women's 3,000-meter competition.</TE>
<TE>   Which might be the all-time best working definition for the agony
of defeat.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tough one to swallow," said U.S. Alpine skier Daron
Rahlves after finishing 16th in the men's downhill, 13 places out of
the medals and seven behind little-known teammate Marco Sullivan.
"I'm still kind of in a daze right now. It was just a very poor
performance."</TE>
<TE>   Rahlves said he was thankful he had another race left to redeem
himself. But if Saturday's super-G doesn't work out, Rahlves sounds
as if he has what it takes to launch a long and successful career as
a sportswriter.</TE>
<TE>   Case in point: Todd Lodwick placed seventh in Nordic combined, the
United States' best Olympic finish in the history of the event. Good
news, no? Not when you make your living as a sportswriter, occupying
a world where the beer schooner is perpetually half-empty and a dark
cloud is always prettier once the silver lining has been detached and
discarded.</TE>
<TE>   After Lodwick's historic performance, members of the U.S. media
corps wanted to know why Americans can't get the hang of Nordic
combined.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you watch a lot of Norwegians?" Lodwick shot back. "They don't
have a clue how to throw a football. It's pathetic."</TE>
<TE>   Norway Alpine skier Lasse Kjus, who probably throws a lousy deep
ball, is pretty good schussing down the slopes. Not great, mind
you--Kjus finished second to Austria's Fritz Strobl in the men's
downhill and concedes, "I can get some good results, and also some
really bad ones."</TE>
<TE>   Kjus was asked why more Norwegian athletes aren't interested in
his sport, considering the abundance of snow and Lycra up there.</TE>
<TE>   "Interest is there," Kjus insisted. "Norway is a very small
country. We as a nation have to live with that result. Interest will
go up and down."</TE>
<TE>   So true.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, there's only so much time in the day in Norway. It can be
tough getting enough downhill training runs when you're working
overtime on your screen pass technique.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, lack of interest in particular Olympic activities
isn't always a bad thing. Take ski jumping. Not many around the world
have a desire to go hurtling down a 90-meter hill and off a cliff
with nothing cushioning the eventual fall except two thin slabs of
fiberglass.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody can understand what ski jumping is like," said Germany's
Sven Hannawald, who finished second in the 90-meter ski jump. "If
everybody tried, they would probably need very good insurance."</TE>
<TE>   See, the losers at the Olympics are the life of the party. The
winners, even if they happen to be interesting people who lead
otherwise fascinating lives, tend to turn dull when the golden
spotlight hits them.</TE>
<TE>   Finland's Samppa Lajunen is a Nordic combined skier by day and a
rock and roll guitarist by night. He plays in a band called
Vieraileva Tahti--Guest Star, in English--with teammate Antti Kuisma
and a few Finnish ski jumpers. A couple years back, Guest Star had a
hit single in Finland, "The Lightest Man In Finland."</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, the international media in Salt Lake wanted to know
more about Guest Star. What kind of rock do they play? Progressive?
Metal? Ska Danavian?</TE>
<TE>   "Forget the band," Lajunen snapped, throwing a wet blanket over
the interview. "Hey, I won the gold medal."</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, yeah, we know. Give us the fifth-place finishers, such as
U.S. women's halfpiper Shannon Dunn, who failed to repeat her 1998
bronze-medal performance and watched teammate Kelly Clark take bows
from the top step of the podium Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Halfpipe snowboarders and figure skaters have one thing in common
and one thing only: They perform to music. Figure skaters choose
their own, not always a good thing, because figure skaters tend to
favor show tunes and Muzak versions of rock classics. Halfpipers also
choose, kind of--they are presented with a list of options, from
AC/DC to Queen to Guns N' Roses to Cyndi Lauper, and told to pick
one.</TE>
<TE>   Way too conservative, said Dunn, who said the official play list
reminded her of "a junior high school dance."</TE>
<TE>   Guest Star might have been able to provide a better selection, but
we'll never know. The guitarist didn't want to talk about it.</TE>

<DL>SNOWBASIN, Utah</DL>
<LD>Sometimes, even when standing on hard, sparkling snow, the ground
under our feet is not enough.</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes, we just need to look up.</LD>
<LD>   At the toes of a hill so treacherous it is named after a bear,
Sunday was one of those times.</LD>
<TE>   On a perfect winter day, America craned its neck toward the pale
skies of 9,286 feet and anxiously awaited the arrival of its perfect
Olympian.</TE>
<TE>   You couldn't see him, but he was up there, and he was coming.</TE>
<TE>   Blond hair. Blue eyes.</TE>
<TE>   A girlfriend in a muffler. A sister in a scarf.</TE>
<TE>   Two little kids waving torn bed sheets upon which they had
scrawled his name.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of others clanging cowbells and screaming that name.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone waiting at the bottom of the men's downhill course for
the same thing, the next Tommy Moe, the new Bill Johnson, our own
Jean-Claude Killy.</TE>
<TE>   Until, about two minutes later, somebody else showed up.</TE>
<TE>   Guy named Daron Rahlves.</TE>
<TE>   Guy who nearly went flying too fast into the first hill and was
nearly tossed into Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   Guy who skittered down the rest of the mountain feeling as
controlled as a kid in an inner tube.</TE>
<TE>   America's brightest hope. The Winter Olympics' 16th-place
finisher.</TE>
<TE>   Jean-Claude Silly.</TE>
<TE>   The hair was a mess. The eyes were wandering.</TE>
<TE>   The girlfriend said, "This must be really hard for him.... ''</TE>
<TE>   The sister said, "If only he could have pulled this off .... ''</TE>
<TE>   The little kids still cheered, but, bless them, little kids will
always cheer.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone else craned their necks back toward 9,000 feet to wait
for someone else.</TE>
<TE>   For most of 54 years, we have been waiting for someone else.</TE>
<TE>   "I really wanted to see me standing up there on the podium,''
sighed Rahlves.</TE>
<TE>   Didn't we all.</TE>
<TE>   Our most popular Winter Olympic sport may be figure skating, but
the one that makes us scream loudest at the television is downhill.</TE>
<TE>   It is the one winter sport with an American brain.</TE>
<TE>   It's not skiing, it's NASCAR.</TE>
<TE>   It's not a skills contest, it's a tough-guy competition.</TE>
<TE>   Its participants are the wide receivers who go across the middle,
the baserunners who break up the double play, the small forward who
takes the charge.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's winner, Fritz Strobl of Austria, flew nearly naked at
more than 80 mph.</TE>
<TE>   In his spare time, he's a cop.</TE>
<TE>   At 6 feet 1 and 203 pounds, he is also a linebacker.</TE>
<TE>   We wished he was our cop, our linebacker.</TE>
<TE>   Every four years, we want one of our guys to win this race so bad,
we promise to change their lives if they do.</TE>
<TE>   Just ask Bill Johnson. In 1984 in Sarajevo, he won a gold medal,
America's first medal ever in this discipline.</TE>
<TE>   Then ask Tommy Moe. In 1994, in Lillehammer, he won our second
gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   Both men became enormously famous. But both men were enormously
drained.</TE>
<TE>   The race was bigger than either of them, the aftermath was bigger
than both, sapping them of their best skiing in ways more mental than
physical.</TE>
<TE>   Neither won a major race again.</TE>
<TE>   Before Sunday, America had still won only two of the 43 medals
awarded in the sport.</TE>
<TE>   That count is now two of 46.</TE>
<TE>   "Skiing has to be like fabric, like cloth,'' said Gigele Elon, an
Austrian ski instructor who, with buddies, was serenading Sunday's
gold and bronze medalists.</TE>
<TE>   A race that fits Western Europeans like a bodysuit was once again
hanging from our best guy like a borrowed snowsuit.</TE>
<TE>   On the 5-foot-9 Rahlves, it fit like a pair of borrowed sport
pants.</TE>
<TE>   Moments out of the chute he was in first place, flying toward that
first hill.</TE>
<TE>   Flying far too fast. Trying far too hard.</TE>
<TE>   "Then I took the pressure off one ski, and I was tossed about 20
feet," he said. "The rest of the run, I was fighting myself."</TE>
<TE>   Oddly enough, it was a run lost not on icy snow, but perhaps on
smooth green felt.</TE>
<TE>   The night before the race, Rahlves was playing pool with teammate
Marco Sullivan.</TE>
<TE>   "While we were playing, we heard his name on TV about six times,"
said Sullivan. "That's a lot of pressure. I wonder if he felt that
pressure."</TE>
<TE>   Of course they mentioned his name. Rahlves finished fifth in the
downhill in the 2001 World Championship. While he won the super-giant
slalom in the same meet, that event has only been in the Olympics
since 1988, so the downhill garnered all the attention.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I had it easier today," Sullivan said. "So much less
pressure."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, he surprisingly finished ninth, the best for an American.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know about pressure," said Rahlves, 28. "I didn't feel
any different going up there."</TE>
<TE>   Sure. But the problem was in coming down.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people may say I pushed it too hard," he said. "But I'd
rather go up there and hammer it then come down here and feel I could
have done something more on my run."</TE>
<TE>   The sentiment is a good one. But the reality is that a country 40
times smaller than ours-- Austria--continues to produce five times as
many good skiers.</TE>
<TE>   "But we are born with skis," said Austria's Elon.</TE>
<TE>   While we, apparently, are born to desperately chase them.</TE>
<TE>   The faster we go, the harder we fall.</TE>
<TE>   But fret not, you skiing fans who spent Sunday with your hands
over your eyes. It may be safe to remove them today when we have a
chance to win our fifth women's downhill medal in 54 years.</TE>

<HD>Ammann Wins at Right Time</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEW FREEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TRIBUNE OLYMPIC BUREAU</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>When the last ski jumper finished and Simon Ammann understood the
gold really was his, he leaped into the arms of two Swiss teammates.</LD>
<LD>   With a determined but awkward effort, the two lifted Ammann on
their shoulders.</LD>
<LD>   "He's light," joked Andreas Kuettel.</LD>
<TE>   "That's why he was winning today."</TE>
<TE>   Being light is an advantage in ski jumping, but Ammann--5 feet 8
and 121 pounds--produced a heavyweight upset Sunday morning on the
90-meter hill.</TE>
<TE>   Although Ammann was a 1998 Olympian in Nagano, he never had won a
World Cup competition, was ranked ninth on the circuit, and a jumping
fall gave him a minor head injury that sidelined him last month. Yet
on a brilliant sunny day at Utah Olympic Park, Ammann relegated
favorites Sven Hannawald of Germany to the silver and Adam Malysz of
Poland to the bronze.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Alborn of Anchorage, Alaska, was the top American, tying for
11th. Alborn, 21, who is ranked 19th in the world, said the crowd of
about 19,000 was the largest for a ski jump he has seen in the U.S.
"by about 100 times."</TE>
<TE>   Ammann, boyish looking, with reddish-brown hair, bounded onto the
podium during a flower presentation when it was announced he had
edged Hannawald by a score of 269.0 to 267.5 to win Switzerland's
first gold medal in the sport. Malysz's score was 261.5 and Alborn's
240.0.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the competition, Ammann jokingly blew on his skis, as
if to say they were too hot, and he high-fived the other medalists.</TE>
<TE>   Ski jumping competitors are judged on a combination of distance
and style. Sunday's event encompassed two days of competition in one
because Friday's qualifying round was postponed because of high
winds. Ammann only wanted to make the top 10.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew [I] needed some luck," Ammann, whose first language is
German, said through a translator. "I was nervous. It's been a
dream."</TE>
<TE>   To compete, the jumpers, who wear tapered nylon foam and rubber
suits, sit on a bar at the top of the steep slope. When they push
off, they lean forward into a tuck, ski onto a ramp, and soar into
the air, positioning their skis into a V shape. They straighten up on
landing.</TE>
<TE>   Ammann's bubbly nature endeared him to the crowd and even
competitors. Hannawald praised him before the final score blinked on
the board.</TE>
<TE>   "In the Olympics and World Championships, it's only medals that
count; not their color," Hannawald said.</TE>
<TE>   Alborn said Ammann's result gives him hope for the 120-meter
competition, which begins Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "He came out of nowhere, basically," Alborn said. "It's kind of
boring seeing the same guys winning every time."</TE>
<TE>   On his final jump, Ammann seemed suspended in air, but he wasn't
sure if he had traveled far enough to defeat Hannawald.</TE>
<TE>   "I looked at the [score] board," Ammann said, "and there was
nothing for such a long time. Then my name appeared."</TE>
<TE>   Although Ammann said his achievement is a victory for the entire
Swiss team, it was clear he still didn't have a handle of what it
means to win gold.</TE>
<TE>   "All I do is ski jump, so there is no reason anyone should want
autographs," he said.</TE>

<DH>Clark Soars on Her Final Run to Claim United States' First
Gold Medal in Women's Halfpipe</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>She came in with a reputation for ferocious workouts, a go-for-it
attitude and, occasionally, spectacular falls.</LD>
<LD>   Now Kelly Clark is known for something else: As the United States'
first gold medal winner of the Salt Lake City Winter Olympic Games.</LD>
<LD>   Clark, an 18-year-old from Mount Snow, Vermont, shook off the ill
effects of a recent training spill to record a score of
47.9--including a perfect 10 for standard maneuvers--and win the
women's snowboarding halfpipe Sunday before a sun-soaked capacity
crowd of 16,500 at Park City Mountain Resort.</LD>
<TE>   "It means a lot to me and all the rest of the Americans here or
anywhere," said Clark, who trained for the Games at Mammoth Mountain.
Then, referring to the national mood in the wake of the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, she added, "We've had a tough couple of months
here and it's great to be part of something we can all take pride
in."</TE>
<TE>   France's Doriane Vidal, with a score of 43.0, took silver.
Switzerland's Fabienne Reuteler, at 39.7, won the bronze. Americans
Shannon Dunn and Tricia Byrnes were fifth and sixth, respectively.
Clark's medal is the first gold for the U.S. in Olympic halfpipe
competition. Dunn won bronze in Nagano four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   On a sunny, warm day, under a brilliant blue sky, the crowd
cheered for all 23 competitors, but loudest for the Americans. And as
Clark's final-run score was posted, fans erupted in a blizzard of
red, white and blue flags and a roar that echoed around the
mountains. Clark climbed over a retaining fence to celebrate with
friends.</TE>
<TE>   A short time earlier, Clark, the final competitor of the day,
smiled and waved from the top of the run when her name was announced.
Before the run, she was in second place, but the security of a silver
medal just made her all the more aggressive.</TE>
<TE>   "I figured I had second place wrapped up, so I had to go for it,"
she said. "I knew I would regret it if I didn't."</TE>
<TE>   So she threw herself into the course--a channel slightly longer
than a football field with sidewalls about 12 feet high.</TE>
<TE>   Performing to the Guns N' Roses song "Welcome to the Jungle," on
the way down she did a 720--two complete spins--and a McTwist, an
inverted 540-degree spin, floating high above the lip of the pipe.
About halfway down, as she was extended horizontally about six feet
over the lip, for an instant her body and board silhouetted against
the sun.</TE>
<TE>   At the bottom, she skidded to a stop, slipped her feet off her
board and ran to her coach, Heath Van Aken, for extended hugs.</TE>
<TE>   Only three days before, she was on her back motionless for 20
minutes--thinking "Oh, man, what bad timing for this"--after hitting
the lip of the wall and crashing hard during a training run.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, she was still sore, but also typically fearless.</TE>
<TE>   "You really have to let go of the fear factor," she said. "Once
you break through that level of fear and feel comfortable with
yourself, you can really push farther."</TE>
<TE>   Clark came into these Games on a roll. She had won a number of
events in January and was "feeling pretty confident."</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice knowing I could land my tricks," she said.</TE>
<TE>   On her first run Sunday, she scored 42.1--easily the top
qualifying mark of the day.</TE>
<TE>   But at the end, it was France's Vidal, with a high-flying
performance on the first of her two final runs, who seemed poised to
win.</TE>
<TE>   Just before her final run, Clark said the roar of the crowd was so
loud it drowned out the Blink 182 song "This is Growing Up" she had
blaring ("It gets me going," she said) on her headphones.</TE>
<TE>   Normally, she uses the music to cover distractions, but on Sunday
that wasn't possible. "I could hear them over the headphones," she
said of the appreciative fans.</TE>
<TE>   In the halfpipe, the best athletes fly six or seven feet over the
lip of the wall while executing acrobatic routines worthy of a
first-rate gymnast. In the Olympics, judges place a premium on height
because, as Vidal explained, "It's better for the show"--meaning the
spectators and television viewers.</TE>
<TE>   However, many of the competitors still seemed more interested in
complex aerobatic twists and turns, moves that in other competitions
are more favorably rewarded.</TE>
<TE>   The more acrobatic the run is, Byrnes said after qualifying for
the finals, "that's what the snowboarders are going to respect. If
the judges don't respond to it, at least [among your peers] you go
out a champ."</TE>
<TE>   At the Olympics, however, she said, "All I know is you gotta go
big."</TE>
<TE>   Clark did that--and more--on her final run. "She was going so
high," Vidal said.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd was the biggest the snowboarders had ever performed in
front of and they gave a performance that might have silenced
critics--in and out of the sport--who wondered if snowboarding
belonged in the Games. It was added to the competition in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "Snowboarders have their reputations," Clark said. "But my doing
this, especially in the U.S., says a lot. Maybe it will shine a light
on snowboarding, and people will look at it in a different way."</TE>

<HD>A Cold, Gold War Among Teammates</HD>
<DH>In women's 3,000, German veteran Pechstein defeats heavily
favored Friesinger.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE KUPPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KEARNS, Utah</DL>
<LD>Two races don't make an Olympics but there's a noticeable trend
developing in speedskating at the Utah Olympic Oval: in-house upsets.</LD>
<LD>   Saturday, it was unheralded Dutchman Jochem Uytdehaage knocking
off his heralded teammates Carl Verheijen and Bob de Jong for the
gold medal in the men's 5,000.</LD>
<LD>   Sunday, it was German veteran Claudia Pechstein tugging the rug
out from under heavily favored younger teammate Anni Friesinger in
the women's 3,000-meter race, adding a sixth Olympic medal--third
gold--and a world record to her impressive collection of awards. Oh,
and that world record? That was supposed to have been Friesinger's
too.</LD>
<TE>   Not that Pechstein much cared.</TE>
<TE>   "We are competitors," she said. "I'm happy about my race and I'm
glad I'm the one who won the gold medal."</TE>
<TE>   If that sounds the least bit chilly, it's because the German women
are not the best of friends. Call it culture clash. Pechstein, among
the last products of the old East German sports machine, lives by a
serious work ethic. Friesinger is a free-wheeling Bavarian who
doesn't mind posing for magazine photos while most of her clothes are
elsewhere. They seldom meet for coffee after practice.</TE>
<TE>   And that bit of tension made for an interesting afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Canadian Kristina Groves was leading the competition when
Friesinger, skating in a pair with American hope Jennifer Rodriguez,
stepped to the line. And for a while, it looked as if Friesinger, 25,
might skate her world record, and haul Rodriguez into a medal at the
same time. With three laps left around the 400-meter track, both were
skating a world-record pace. Then Rodriguez fell off it, and, with a
lap left, so did Friesinger, finishing with an Olympic-record time of
3 minutes 59.39 seconds, and leaving the door open for Pechstein.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez finished in 4:04.99, a U.S. record, and moved into
second, behind Friesinger. That, however, was a temporary thing.</TE>
<TE>   Tonny de Jong of the Netherlands--no relation to Bob--and Maki
Tabata of Japan, the next pair, both beat Rodriguez, then Pechstein
and Canadian Cindy Klassen beat everybody else.</TE>
<TE>   Pechstein, who will turn 30 during these Games, set a fast pace
and maintained it all the way, finishing in 3:57.70, beating her own
record of 3:59.26 set last year at the Olympic rink in Calgary.
Klassen, who practices on that Calgary rink, pushed Pechstein hard
most of the way and also beat the German's old record, finishing in
3:58.97, which would have been good for the silver medal, had not
Renate Groenewold of the Netherlands skated a 3:58:94 in the final
pair.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, maybe it was an advantage to skate after Anni," Pechstein
said, "but it really doesn't matter [who goes first], you just have
to be in top shape. I think I earned my medal but I think it was my
advantage that Anni was the favorite and everybody was predicting a
world record for her. When I saw she couldn't beat my old record, I
thought I might have a good race."</TE>

<HD>Romney Shows He Can Be as Hands-On as Anyone</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mitt Romney has a reputation as a hands-on guy, but Sunday the
president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee took that notion a
step further.</LD>
<LD>   Romney was caught in two massive traffic jams as spectators
streamed to Snow Basin for one of the Games premier events, the men's
downhill. The event, with a capacity of 23,500, was sold out. The
first occurred after an auxiliary parking lot filled and motorists
leaving the highway failed to heed a sign indicating just that.</LD>
<LD>   "We had an entire interstate that exited where they shouldn't have
exited," Romney said during a news conference, where he drew an
intricate diagram of the incident.</LD>
<TE>   Romney, whose car was caught in the crowd, said he got out and
directed traffic for about half an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Some time later, Romney's entourage was stymied again, closer to
the venue. This time a line of 75 buses carrying media, IOC members
and spectators was backed up. The first bus in line, Romney said, did
not have proper credentials. The can-do CEO rushed to the rescue
again, telling security guards that he would personally vouch for the
unaccredited bus.</TE>
<TE>   Romney estimated that about 10% of those seeking to attend the
event were delayed. As for him, Romney said he missed the first five
or six runs.</TE>
<TE>   On one bus stuck in winding gridlock, fans watched skiers through
the front window, cheering and ringing cowbells as if they were
actually in the stands.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, many of them had been traveling on buses for three
hours. Their trip included a crushing, lengthy security checkpoint at
the foot of the hill, followed by a transfer to an ancient city bus
that chugged them to the top. Several buses, both old and new, broke
down at the side of the road during that journey.</TE>
<TE>   A Secure Feeling</TE>
<TE>   The unprecedented security in place here appears to be working.
Romney said that in the Games' first few days only three incidents of
note have occurred.</TE>
<TE>   They are:</TE>
<TE>   * A pipe bomb was found north of Ogden, apparently fashioned by a
group of local teenagers. Romney said the device had no connection
with the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   * A bag of electrical components was found near a parking garage
in downtown Salt Lake City and destroyed by a bomb squad.</TE>
<TE>   * A SLOC employee at Snow Basin was found to have a machete in his
car, which the employee told authorities was customary for him.
Romney said the employee was "dealt with" but did not elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   He said he is briefed twice a day about security matters and aside
from "normal nuisance" reports, nothing of significance has happened.</TE>
<TE>   Now for the Real Pain</TE>
<TE>   Speedskating silver medalist Renate Groenewold of the Netherlands
on skating the last two laps of the women's 3,000-meter race:</TE>
<TE>   "It's pain, real pain. It feels like your legs are growing bigger
and bigger and want to explode.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really hard to breathe and here, where the air is so dry,
after the race, you can feel a little blood in your lungs.</TE>
<TE>   "When it's over, you just want to sit down--but you can't.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to keep skating [cool-down laps to dissipate built up
lactic acid]."</TE>
<TE>   OK, but apparently, when it comes to that sort of thing, age has
its privileges.</TE>
<TE>   Emese Hunyady, soon to be 36, born in Hungary but skating now for
Austria in her sixth Olympics, finished her race, in the
then-Olympic-record time of 4 minutes 6.55 seconds, skated a single
cool-down lap, then sat on a mat at the edge of the warmup lane,
eventually lying flat on her back.</TE>
<TE>   After a short rest, she got up and continued her cool-down.</TE>
<TE>   Later, when asked if this were her last Olympics, she said she
thought she'd be back for one or two more.</TE>
<TE>   Going Downhill Fast</TE>
<TE>   France's Pierre-Emmanuel Dalcin finished 11th in Sunday's
downhill, yet ought to get some sort of medal for his somewhat
miraculous, one-ski performance through the finish line.</TE>
<TE>   Traveling at speeds in excess of 80 mph near the end of the race,
Dalcin lost his right ski yet managed a standing-up stop in the coral
on his left ski, for which Dalcin received a thunderous ovation from
the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Tres bon, Dalcin.</TE>
<TE>   "I just lost it," he said of the ski that escaped him.</TE>
<TE>   "The most important thing was not to fall."</TE>
<TE>   Light Their Fire</TE>
<TE>   During a post-opening-ceremony news conference, Mike Eruzione held
the final Olympic torch in front of Romney with one request.</TE>
<TE>   "I got a message from the team," he said. "They all want one of
these."</TE>
<TE>   No word on whether Romney will allow it, but here's guessing each
of the 20 members will, like every other torch bearer, be asked to
pay $335 per torch.</TE>
<TE>   Call Him Later</TE>
<TE>   The king phoned, but Johann Muehlegg couldn't take the call.</TE>
<TE>   Muehlegg, a Germany-born, naturalized citizen of Spain, received
an honor few other Spaniards have--a congratulatory call from King
Juan Carlos.</TE>
<TE>   Muehlegg was in the drug testing area at the time.</TE>
<TE>   He won the gold medal in the 30-kilometer cross-country race, only
Spain's third medal ever in the Winter Games and its second gold.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really sorry I missed the call, but it was a tremendous honor
that he tried," Muehlegg said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Julie Cart, Chris Dufrense, Mike Kupper and
Bill Plaschke and the Associated Press contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Beth Heiden Also Made a Mark</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beth Heiden didn't win five speedskating gold medals at the 1980
Olympics in Lake Placid, N.Y. She won a single bronze, in the 3000
meters. But that medal was almost as amazing as Eric Heiden's five
golds and it made the Heidens, brother and sister from Madison, Wis.,
the biggest story of the Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   Her achievement was surprising because Beth was tiny, 5 feet 2,
105 pounds, in a sport where most women were at least six inches
taller and 50 pounds heavier.</LD>
<LD>   A year earlier, Beth Heiden had won four gold medals and the
all-around title at the 1979 World Championships in The Hague,
Netherlands. At the Olympics, Heiden had a sore ankle and was
fighting the elements. "At my size," Heiden says, "skating outdoors
was tough. Cutting through the wind made things harder for me."</LD>
<TE>   After the 1980 Games, where she also finished seventh in the 500
meters, fifth in the 1,000, and seventh in the 1,500, Heiden won a
U.S. cycling championship and, as a senior at the University of
Vermont in 1983, became the first women's NCAA cross-country skiing
champion.</TE>
<TE>   At 42, Beth Heiden Reid is the mother of 14-year-old Garrett,
12-year-old Carl and 9-year-old Joanne. Her husband, Russell Reid, is
on sabbatical from teaching mathematics at Michigan Tech. He is
working for Apple Computers. The family lives in Palo Alto.</TE>
<TE>   Reid, who was a college wrestler, and Beth built a 15-kilometer
cross-country ski trail in Hancock, Mich. They raised $5,000 and did
the work themselves with, Heiden says, "the help of good friends who
would come out in the rain and snow." The trail is called Maasto
Hiihto, Finnish for "cross-country." Heiden said it was named to
honor the large Finnish population in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   Their oldest son, Garrett, has made the Western junior Olympic
cross-country ski team.</TE>
<TE>   While her husband is at Apple, Heiden has taken time off from her
teaching career. She has an undergraduate degree in math and an
master's of science in civil engineering.</TE>
<TE>   "If I look at it now," Heiden says, "speedskating wasn't a good
choice for me, not at my size. My brother and I started out as figure
skaters because we had a house on the lake. But Eric and I both spent
most of our time at figure skating practice racing around the rink.
And it's still always a thrill to see an Olympic opening ceremony. It
takes me back and there's no getting around the excitement of being
an Olympic participant."</TE>

<HD>San Diego County Fire Destroys 14 Homes</HD>

<DL>FALLBROOK, Calif.
</DL>
<LD>A fast-moving brush fire pushed by gusty, dry Santa Ana winds
destroyed at least 14 pricey homes in this rural community in northern
San Diego County on Sunday and forced hundreds of residents to flee.</LD>
<LD>   "It was terrifying. The fire was just a quarter-mile away, and the
wind was blowing so hard," said Melissa Copeland, whose house was
threatened. "We had three minutes to get our stuff and get out. We
grabbed the kids and the family pictures. Everything else can be
replaced."</LD>
<LD>   The origin of the fire was unknown. It began about 11 a.m. in the De
Luz Canyon area east of this community of horse ranches and avocado
groves.</LD>
<TE>   "First came the smoke and then the flames down the canyon that chased
us out," said Gaynor Bean, 85, whose home was destroyed. "All I got out
with is my wallet. Sometimes life isn't very good."</TE>
<TE>   Fed by tall, dry brush and whipped by high winds, the crackling flames
leaped from hill to hill, sparing some homes, destroying others.</TE>
<TE>   Six people jumped into a backyard swimming pool and dived beneath the
water while the fire raged above them. They were taken to a hospital
suffering smoke inhalation and hypothermia because of the cold water.</TE>
<TE>   Residents in hundreds of homes were ordered to evacuate by sheriff's
deputies using bullhorns. Many fled just ahead of the flames, taking
their horses and other livestock and pets. Among the rescued animals were
two prized llamas.</TE>
<TE>   "The fire made a roaring sound," said Ron Cullins, whose house was
saved by firefighters. "I could hear explosions everywhere. The heat was
unbearable."</TE>
<TE>   The Fallbrook Hospital emergency room treated at least 11 people for
minor injuries. Two admitted for overnight observation were listed in
stable condition.</TE>
<TE>   By nightfall, officials estimated that more than 2,000 acres had been
burned, making it bigger than Orange County's two-day brush fire near
Anaheim Hills. The San Diego fire was listed as only 5% contained, and
officials hoped that cooler night temperatures would help slow it.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents forced to evacuate were unsure whether their homes had
survived.</TE>
<TE>   "We know the avocado trees across the street were on fire," said a
distraught Gloria Avila.</TE>
<TE>   The fire burned brush on the edge of the Fallbrook Naval Weapons
Station, forcing evacuation of officer housing units although none of the
units were burned. Nine of 10 fire stations at Camp Pendleton were
mobilized to keep the fire from the sprawling base.</TE>
<TE>   The high winds also caused two big rigs to tip over in San Bernardino.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego County fire officials and residents said the fire there,
dubbed the Gavilan Fire because it started on Gavilan Mountain Road,
seemed to race from hilltop to hilltop. Much of the region has not had a
"burn off" in 50 years and brush is up to 20 feet tall, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, homes where owners had taken precautions--putting ice
plant around the property, avoiding certain shingle materials, even
installing sprinklers on roofs--were still damaged or destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just a big pop and a solid wall of fire," said Ralph Cox, 51,
who was trapped in his home until firefighters knocked down the flames to
give him an escape route.</TE>
<TE>   Residents tried desperately to save their homes by using garden hoses
but were hampered by low water pressure and the speed of the fire. Thick,
acrid smoke blanketed much of Fallbrook and was visible in San Diego, 70
miles south.</TE>
<TE>   Pete Jesperson tried to save his in-laws' house until the flames
became too intense and he was forced to flee. The soot-covered Jesperson
clutched an American flag he managed to save and use as a screen to keep
from inhaling the thick smoke.</TE>
<TE>   Six helicopters from the California Department of Forestry and Fire
Protection, nine bulldozers and more than 650 firefighters and 100 fire
engines from departments from San Diego and Orange counties were assigned
to fight the fire. The engines were hampered by narrow, winding roads
leading to the imperiled homes.</TE>
<TE>   Two fire engines, a San Diego Sheriff's Department car and two small
buildings behind homes were destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   Fallbrook, population 30,000, has long been popular with people
looking for a "country lifestyle" within driving range of a major city.
Many of the homes, advertised as "ranchettes," cost $1 million or more
and have mountaintop views that, on a clear day, provide a vista of the
Pacific Ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents complained that the forestry department did not
dispatch air tankers to drop water or fire-retardant chemicals. But
forestry officials said the winds were too high and unpredictable.</TE>
<TE>   An official with the San Diego Fire Department said some structures
might have been saved if San Diego County had its own fire helicopter
rather than relying on outside agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "An aerial resource to coordinate incoming fire units to those remote
areas is critical in attacking a fast-moving wildfire," said Brian
Fennessy of the air operations bureau of the San Diego Fire Department.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, 60 homes in the La Costa section of Carlsbad were destroyed
by fire.</TE>

<HD>Finance Reform Down to the Wire</HD>
<DH>Campaign: Advocates hope outrage over the Enron scandal helps end
big-money influence. GOP leaders push feverishly to block action as House
opens debate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A resurgent coalition of Democrats and renegade Republicans,
energized by the Enron scandal, is making a final push this week for
House passage of the broadest overhaul of the nation's campaign laws in a
quarter century. House Republican leaders are mounting a furious defense
of the status quo.</LD>
<LD>   Coalition members hope public outrage over Enron's enormous political
contributions will put an end to what they call the corrosive influence
of big money on politics. Opponents argue that the reform agenda is an
unconstitutional violation of free speech--and that it would benefit
Democratic candidates.</LD>
<LD>   At issue is the House version of a bill the Senate approved last
April. If the House passes a similar bill and the Senate votes to accept
the House changes, the measure would go to President Bush for his
signature.</LD>
<TE>   The White House has said publicly that congressional Republicans
cannot count on Bush for a veto, even though the House bill, which is
scheduled for debate Tuesday and Wednesday, violates some of his
principles for campaign finance reform.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has said that a ban on unlimited giving should apply to
corporations and unions but not individuals (the House bill includes all
three) and that unions should have to get the consent of their members
before making political contributions (the House bill has no such
feature).</TE>
<TE>   Stripped to its essence, the question before the House is whether to
eliminate unlimited contributions and impose a $95,000 ceiling on what
any person may give in any two-year national election cycle.</TE>
<TE>   When Congress capped individual campaign giving in 1974 after the
Watergate scandal, big political donors found a loophole: The law didn't
limit contributions to the political parties for so-called party-building
activities. These contributions, which have seeped into recent campaigns
through the proliferation of party-sponsored TV advertising, have become
known as soft money.</TE>
<TE>   In the last election cycle, the two major parties hauled in nearly
$500 million in unlimited, loosely regulated soft money. The
scandal-ridden Enron Corp. gave $1.7 million of it--and now some of its
recipients are ducking for the political cover of campaign finance
reform.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows what the political landscape would look like without soft
money. Would reform favor one party over the other? Hard to say. Would it
be easier for challengers to unseat incumbents? Also unclear. Would it
reduce the influence of big donors? Probably, to a degree.</TE>
<TE>   "It wouldn't solve all the problems," said Paul S. Herrnson, a
campaign finance expert at the University of Maryland. "It wouldn't get
rid of money in politics. But these reforms, if passed, will prohibit
groups from giving the largest sums in concentrated form."</TE>
<TE>   House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), a leading reform
advocate, said many incumbents simply fear tinkering with rules that
helped elect them to Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "They know this system; they don't know what would be the new system,"
Gephardt told reporters. "And I think the fear of change of a new system
scares a lot of people."</TE>
<TE>   Legislation to ban soft money, impose an updated system of
contribution limits and regulate certain forms of political advertising
passed the Senate in April in a 59-41 vote. That vote was in part a coda
to the 2000 presidential campaign of pro-reform Sen. John McCain
(R-Ariz.). It was a major breakthrough after years in which Senate
filibusters prevented action.</TE>
<TE>   Heading into this week's House showdown, the bill's advocates hold a
critical edge that they lacked before the Senate debate: They are
defending a proven bipartisan majority. In 1999, the House voted 252 to
177 to ban soft money. Of those on the winning side, 226 are still in the
House, eight more than a majority.</TE>
<TE>   Key to the outcome this time are 43 Republicans from that group. Many,
such as Rep. Stephen Horn of Long Beach, have reaffirmed that stance.
Horn was the only California Republican to sign a rank-and-file petition
that has forced the House GOP leaders to hold a vote.</TE>
<TE>   But some Republicans are having second thoughts as party leaders, led
by Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.), warn that campaign finance reform
could cost them control of the House. Republicans are defending a narrow
222-211 majority in this year's elections.</TE>
<TE>   "No member of Congress on either side of the aisle likes to turn his
or her back on the leadership when they say it's vital," said Rep. John
M. McHugh (R-N.Y.), one swing vote.</TE>
<TE>   Two Californians on the fence are Reps. Doug Ose (R-Sacramento) and
Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley). Both voted in 1999 for a soft money ban,
and both were co-sponsors last year of the version of McCain's bill that
was introduced in the House by Reps. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.) and
Martin T. Meehan (D-Mass.).</TE>
<TE>   Gallegly spokesman Tom Pfeifer said late last week that the
congressman could not say how he would vote until he saw the final bill.
Ose said the bill already had changed so much that "if it were just
straight up or down right now, I'm not sure I could support it."</TE>
<TE>   Any member of Congress who switches position on campaign finance
reform during an election year could be on treacherous ground. Public
scrutiny of the donations made by Enron, major accounting firms and other
groups could prove harmful to the political health of the recipients.</TE>
<TE>   Mindful of the perils, Ose said: "I agree that soft money is
distorting this process. The question is how to go about getting it out
of the system."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans are not the only potential swing votes. There are 182
Democrats and one independent who voted in 1999 for the soft money ban,
but some could stray this time for various reasons. In addition, 49 House
newcomers have never voted on the matter.</TE>
<TE>   While the top two Democrats are working to pass the legislation, Rep.
Martin Frost of Texas, the No. 3 House Democrat, is undecided.</TE>
<TE>   A splinter group of as many as seven members of the Congressional
Black Caucus, most of whom voted for a soft money ban previously, could
join with Republicans in an effort to help kill the legislation. Those
black lawmakers say they are worried that wiping out a key funding source
could hamper voter turnout programs.</TE>
<TE>   In the debate starting Tuesday, lawmakers will be able to vote on up
to 20 amendments and as many as three different bills, including two
offered by Republican leaders opposed to the soft money ban.</TE>
<TE>   Shays and Meehan will seek to ward off amendments that would
jeopardize final passage, in a vote scheduled for Wednesday, or force the
legislation into a House-Senate conference, where it could be killed.</TE>
<TE>   Battles could erupt over whether to postpone the bill's effective date
until after the 2002 elections (the Senate-approved ban would go into
effect 30 days after enactment), whether to force courts to consider the
bill as a whole or piecemeal in any legal challenge (the bill allows
piecemeal review) and whether to clamp down on the high cost of
television broadcasting (the bill proposes TV cost regulations).</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, in a preview of the debate, Meehan predicted that the Enron
hearings would reinforce the anti-soft money message. On NBC's "Meet the
Press," Meehan denounced Enron executives for having "basically bought
all kinds of unfettered influence on every level of government."</TE>
<TE>   But Rep. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), a Republican leader, attacked Meehan's
legislation as a sham reform that would only allow media companies "to
decide what they thought was important about a campaign." The vote, Blunt
said, "is going to be very tight. . . . It's reality-check time for
members of Congress who believe in party-building activities."</TE>
<TE>   Blunt suggested the Republican strategy might be to force the bill
into a potentially fatal visit to a House-Senate conference committee,
possibly by making it even tougher than the Senate bill. "The president
can be involved more in a conference bill than he can with bills on the
floor," Blunt said.</TE>
<TE>   Reform advocates are hoping the Senate-approved bill will survive the
House with revisions so minor that the Senate would vote on them
directly, avoiding a conference committee.</TE>
<TE>   By now, most lawmakers have heard all the arguments. Some fervently
believe it would be an unconstitutional infringement on free speech and
political participation. Others argue with equal conviction that the
chase for big-money donations taints the whole federal government,
whether the controversy is last year's presidential pardons or this
year's Enron hearings.</TE>
<TE>   Interest groups are nonetheless drumming up pressure on both sides.
For the reforms, groups such as Common Cause, the League of Women Voters
and AARP argue that soft money prevents congressional action on such
issues as giving senior citizens affordable prescription drug coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Against them are the National Rifle Assn., the National Right to Life
Committee and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which say the
reforms--especially proposed regulations on political advertising in
preelection periods--are an attempt by incumbents to squelch legitimate
expression by outsiders. They warn that even if legislation gets through
Congress, it would be subject to challenge as an unconstitutional
infringement of free speech.</TE>
<TE>   "Should this bill pass the House and be signed by the president," said
Bill Miller, a Chamber of Commerce vice president, "our lawyers would be
sprinting down Pennsylvania Avenue toward the courthouse."</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC)</TE>
<TE>Campaign Finance Reform</TE>
<TE>   The campaign finance reform legislation proposed by Reps. Christopher
Shays (R-Conn.) and Martin T. Meehan (D-Mass.) would:</TE>
<TE>   * Ban "soft money"--unlimited contributions to the national political
parties.</TE>
<TE>   * Limit individual donors to overall contributions of $95,000 to
national political parties and candidates for president and Congress
during a two-year election cycle. No more than $57,500 of that could be
given to party organizations, and $37,500 to candidates.</TE>
<TE>   * Raise the amount that individuals can give to any one candidate from
$1,000 to $2,000 in presidential and Senate races. Today's $1,000 limit
for House candidates would remain in place. The caps would be indexed to
inflation.</TE>
<TE>   * Leave intact separate contribution limits for political action
committees run by unions, corporations and interest groups.</TE>
<TE>   * Ban the use of corporate and union treasury money for broadcast
advertisements that refer to a federal candidate and target the
candidate's electorate within 60 days of a general election or 30 days of
a primary. Certain other groups that fund such advertising also would be
subject to new regulations.</TE>
<TE>   * Within 60 days of a general election and 45 days of a primary,
require broadcast television, cable and satellite providers to charge
candidates and national parties the lowest amount they have charged any
other advertiser during the preceding 180 days.</TE>

<HD>Schools Shy Away From Washington Field Trips</HD>
<DH>Tourism: After terror attack, fear puts a damper on a traditional
academic rite.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FAYE FIORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The attacks happened a long way from Anna Berkowitz's school in St.
Joseph, Mo., a small town best known for the birth of the Pony Express
and the death of Jesse James. But terror's long reach touched her just
the same when her school district canceled this spring's senior trip to
the nation's capital, once a place to venerate but now a place to fear.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm sure I'll go to Washington someday but never with my senior
class," said Berkowitz, who watched her older sister come home from the
trip two years ago teeming with photographs and ambition. "President Bush
said the best thing to do is go on with life, but I guess this is one
experience the terrorists stopped us from having."</LD>
<LD>   On the scale of Sept. 11 tragedies, a lost week in Washington hardly
registers. But for the estimated 1 million students who make the
pilgrimage each year, it is a rite of passage that has inspired countless
teenagers to careers in public policy, politics and, in one case, the
presidency.</LD>
<TE>   This year, more than one-quarter of the nation's school districts
banned student travel to Washington, a blow to the local economy that has
threatened the existence of civic education groups and prompted
advertising campaigns to repair the capital city's image as a dangerous
place.</TE>
<TE>   At the Close Up and Washington Workshop foundations, which together
have brought nearly 30,000 students to the city in past years, enrollment
is down as much as 40%, prompting staff reductions and salary cuts.
Another bleak year like this one could drive the decades-old groups out
of business, their directors said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is impossible to estimate the number of students affected by these
restrictions," said Chuck Tampio, a vice president at Close Up, which has
brought more than half a million students to Washington in its 30 years.
"What is clear is that hundreds of thousands of young people will be
denied access to highly formative experiences . . . they may never be
able to duplicate later on."</TE>
<TE>   For decades they came by the thousands, some in their uncomfortable
Sunday best, to shake the hand of a senator or read the Declaration of
Independence etched in granite. Several members of Congress say they
first fell in love with Washington on a high school field trip. Bill
Clinton was on a youth tour in 1963 when he shook the hand of President
Kennedy, a moment that helped define his future.</TE>
<TE>   Students who visit today find a city visibly changed; police are
stationed at nearly every corner, and concrete barricades encircle the
monuments like scattered dominoes. Chaperons enforce an unpopular 6 p.m.
hotel curfew.</TE>
<TE>   But even in this altered state, there is evidence of a capital
healing: American flags hang defiantly in the windows of a Senate office
building once infected by anthrax. The Pentagon is on the mend; the
blackened wound where one of four hijacked planes crashed is now cleaned
and dressed in plywood.</TE>
<TE>   "At home in St. Louis, I see the flags out, but here, it affects you,"
said Melanie Perry, 17, of Clayton High. "There are flags on the cars and
the cabs. This is our capital. Everyone is unified."</TE>
<TE>No Substitute for Firsthand Visits</TE>
<TE>   She and a dozen other high school students had just stepped off a bus
one recent morning to find themselves wrapped in history. To the left was
the Capitol, where President Bush was about to deliver his first State of
the Union address. To the right was the Supreme Court, where justices
mulled the legality of school vouchers. Behind them stood the Library of
Congress, with its display of the contents of Abraham Lincoln's pockets
the night he was assassinated.</TE>
<TE>   Only two days into their visit, most had already connected with their
citizenship in a way they could not in a classroom. Charles Newton, a
junior at Clarkston High outside of Atlanta, had landed the e-mail
address of a State Department official with whom he plans to discuss the
war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Amanda Zolfo of Langham Creek High in Houston finally understood the
Enron scandal that has been the talk of her hometown.</TE>
<TE>   And Kelli Kuhn, a Langham Creek senior who shot two rolls of film on
the architecture alone, would not only watch the president's speech but
spend the evening discussing it with her friends. "Now that I'm here, it
has new meaning," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But that prevailing sense of patriotism is not, at the moment, the
abiding view of Washington. Even while the local defense economy booms
with the war, there persists an image that the capital is neither safe
nor entirely open for business.</TE>
<TE>   The dwindling number of student tourists has helped cut museum
attendance about 45%, sliced into the souvenir market and rolled back
business at lower-priced hotels in the Washington area, said tourism
officials working to neutralize the damage.</TE>
<TE>   School superintendents were recently invited to meet with Washington
Mayor Anthony Williams and the head of security at Ronald Reagan National
Airport in an effort to convince them the city is safe.</TE>
<TE>   A television ad campaign inviting visitors to Washington features the
stars of NBC's "West Wing," in which actor Martin Sheen beckons: "The
houses are old and beautiful, and residents don't part with them easily .
. . but there's one house between 1590 and 1610 Pennsylvania Avenue
that's changed hands 43 times, and it still has a lot of the same
furniture. Want to come inside?"</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the public hasn't been invited inside that house since
Sept. 11, but tours are set to resume for domestic school groups Friday.
And though FBI headquarters remains closed to the public, the Capitol and
the Library of Congress have been open for weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're here, you see Washingtonians going about their daily
lives," said Victoria Isley, spokeswoman for the Washington Convention
and Tourism Corp. "This is a city that knows how to handle security
issues. We do that all the time."</TE>
<TE>   But until that message hits the heartland, Anna Berkowitz and the
other seniors at Central High will have to settle for a trip to the Harry
S. Truman Library and Museum in Independence, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice, but it won't be as neat," she said. "We know the school
board was looking out for our best interest, and we are appreciative of
that. But now, Sept. 11 seems very far away."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Forces Beat Afghans After Deadly Assault, Ex-Prisoners Say</HD>
<DH>War: Reports add to evidence suggesting that the attack targeted
innocent people.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ORUZGAN, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>After killing 21 Afghans, at least some of them loyal to the
U.S.-backed interim government, American forces beat and kicked some of
the dead men's colleagues who were held prisoner for 16 days before being
released last week with an apology, according to several of those held.</LD>
<LD>   The 27 men, captured during a Jan. 24 nighttime raid in which U.S.
troops appear to have mistakenly targeted friendly forces in this remote
village, were treated harshly at first, several of them said--with two
saying they blacked out from their beatings and two others claiming they
suffered broken ribs. Then the ill treatment stopped, they said, perhaps
because the U.S. special operations forces realized they had captured and
killed friendly troops, not Taliban or Al Qaeda fighters.</LD>
<LD>   The accounts of recently released captives, as well as those of
soldiers who escaped the attack and others here, add to a growing body of
evidence suggesting that the U.S. killed and captured innocent people,
then denied for more than two weeks that anything had gone awry.</LD>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld acknowledged for
the first time that U.S. troops might have killed Afghan allies in the
operation, and a military spokesman conceded that the detainees did not
belong to either the Taliban or Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Marine Capt. Robert A. Riggle Jr., reached late Sunday at U.S. Central
Command headquarters in Tampa, Fla., and asked to comment on the alleged
prisoner abuse, said, "We've heard absolutely no reports of this," and he
referred questions to the Pentagon. Pentagon officials did not return a
call.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody knows there are no Taliban here," said Abdul Qudus Irfani,
the newly appointed Oruzgan district chief and a close ally of interim
Prime Minister Hamid Karzai. "The Americans should have asked us."</TE>
<TE>   "Something very bad happened," Ahmed Karzai, the prime minister's
brother and a member of the governing council in the southern city of
Kandahar, said in an interview last week. "That's all I can say right
now."</TE>
<TE>   The attack began about 2 a.m. in Oruzgan, a village that is a two-day
drive northeast of Kandahar along riverbeds and across high, rocky
deserts. From the beginning of the operation, confusion apparently
reigned on all sides.</TE>
<TE>   Guard Allah Noor was awakened by a noise--maybe gunfire, he's not
sure--and stepped from his mat on the floor of the main district office
building out into the darkness. He saw soldiers in black masks and
goggles with flashlights attached to the ends of their assault weapons,
and they were speaking a language he didn't recognize.</TE>
<TE>   The 40-year-old Noor stepped quickly back inside the room and told his
commander.</TE>
<TE>   "It's OK, they're our friends," the commander, Police Chief Abdul
Rauf, told him. "Just stay in here."</TE>
<TE>   Then the firing broke out.</TE>
<TE>   When the sun rose a few hours later, 21 people were dead; the district
building and the village school had been pounded into rubble by rifle,
rocket and cannon fire; and Noor and 26 others, having been bound hand
and foot and flown by helicopter 150 miles south, were lying face down in
the gravel at the Kandahar air base; being kneed in the sides; having
their faces shoved into the ground; and being walked on by U.S troops,
several of them said in separate interviews.</TE>
<TE>   The day before the prisoners were released last week, a U.S. military
officer at Kandahar placed his hands together and held them in front of
his face in what looked like a gesture of supplication, Rauf recalled.
The police chief said that the American, speaking through an interpreter,
said: "We are sorry. We made a mistake."</TE>
<TE>Little Anger at U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the former prisoners interviewed echoed the sentiments of this
shellshocked village. They aren't necessarily angry at the U.S. In a
country where allegiances shift continually, the Americans have had
difficulty since the war began determining who is friend and who is foe.</TE>
<TE>   The former prisoners are angry at whoever told the U.S. that Taliban
and Al Qaeda soldiers were holed up in the school and the district
building.</TE>
<TE>   What they want from the U.S. is the name, or names, of the informants.</TE>
<TE>   Many here believe, and evidence suggests, that the U.S. acted on
deeply flawed intelligence in carrying out the raid--perhaps allowing
itself to be lured into the kind of tribal dispute that has bedeviled
this country for centuries or duped into helping undermine the shaky rule
of Karzai.</TE>
<TE>   Among those whom Afghan officials would like to question are former
moujahedeen commander Mohammed Yunus, who was appointed district chief
after the fall of the Taliban regime and was collecting Taliban weapons
at the school--only to be ousted a few weeks later when a new governor
picked his archrival, Irfani, for the job. Yunus disappeared the day
after the raid and has not been seen since, people here say.</TE>
<TE>   Another longtime moujahedeen commander, Abdul Qyum, who, because of
his reputation for duplicity, is sometimes called Mullah Kafir, or
"nonbeliever," went to the district office the morning after the raid
with two men, stole a pickup truck and loaded it with rockets and
mortars, people say. He too has vanished.</TE>
<TE>   Qyum is close to Kandahar's powerful governor, Gul Agha Shirzai, who
oversees security for five provinces in southern Afghanistan, including
Oruzgan. U.S. special operations forces can be seen daily at Shirzai's
compound.</TE>
<TE>   Shirzai and Karzai both received U.S. support as they marched with
their personal armies toward Kandahar late last year, but the two often
clash over political matters. Qyum's being shut out of the power circle
here undermines Shirzai as well as Qyum himself.</TE>
<TE>   "They are looking for him in Oruzgan province. They are looking for
him in Kandahar. They are looking for him all over Afghanistan," one
released prisoner said of Qyum.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the overarching question of where the U.S got its
intelligence, many other details of the raid remain unclear. For example,
the Pentagon says the Afghans fired first. The Afghans who survived say
they don't think their comrades fired first, and some say Afghans didn't
fire at all.</TE>
<TE>   Numerous interviews, often conducted separately, nonetheless paint an
unnerving if incomplete picture of the deadly attack and of the
imprisonment.</TE>
<TE>   Between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m. that Thursday, helicopters settled into a
barren wheat field near the school and even nearer the mud-walled home of
Abdul Wali. The helicopters disgorged at least two vehicles and numerous
special operations forces--some of whom would return two hours later,
blow the door off Wali's house, tie him up and terrorize his two wives
and 14 children, according to his 16-year-old son, Fazal Rabi.</TE>
<TE>   The school, like the district building, was a weapons collection site,
where a special commission appointed by Oruzgan's provincial governor,
Jan Mohammed, was overseeing the gathering of Taliban and Al Qaeda arms.</TE>
<TE>Everyone Was Asleep</TE>
<TE>   The first attack on the school came from the ground. With the
exception of one or two guards, everyone was asleep on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   "When I woke up, I saw Americans on the ground," said Amanullah, 25, a
guard for the commission. "They were shooting people."</TE>
<TE>   Amanullah leaped from a window and ran, he said. His cousin, Tor Jan,
26, was running behind him. Shoeless and coatless, sprinting across the
frozen ground, Amanullah fell. There was heavy firing. He looked back, he
said, to see American soldiers appearing to handcuff his cousin, who was
lying face down.</TE>
<TE>   He would find the body of his cousin the next morning on a rock pile
outside the school, in a spot where dried blood is still visible. Tor Jan
had been shot three times--once in the neck, once in the chest and once
in the stomach, Amanullah said. All the rounds appeared to have come from
behind, with small entry wounds in the back and large exit wounds on the
front.</TE>
<TE>   Tor Jan, Amanullah said, was one of eight men found dead the next
morning with their hands tied behind their backs with plastic handcuffs.
Two sets of plastic cuffs that residents say came from two of the dead
are imprinted with the phrases "MADE IN USA" and "THE USER ASSUMES
RESPONSIBILITY FOR INJURY RESULTING FROM NEGLIGENCE."</TE>
<TE>   No evidence of executions has arisen here. Rather, the U.S. soldiers
may have handcuffed anyone who appeared to be wounded or dead so they
could move on quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Nineteen men were killed at the school, residents and survivors say.
Six to eight bloodstains are on the floor of one classroom used for
sleeping, two or three in another.</TE>
<TE>   The chief of the disarmament commission and his deputy, people say,
were found dead in a room that is badly burned out. Another bloodstain
marks a spot 50 yards from the school where another guard died, and
another dried pool is on the walkway outside a classroom.</TE>
<TE>   Only four men escaped from the school, including Amanullah. The U.S.
took no prisoners there, people here say.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans also took none of the thousands of rounds of ammunition,
it appears.</TE>
<TE>   Most accounts suggest that the attack on the district office began
about the same time as the one on the school, perhaps a few minutes
later.</TE>
<TE>   Akhtar Mohammed, who is 17 or 18--he's not certain--was a farmer
before becoming a guard a month ago. He awoke at the district office to
the sound of shooting, got up and was met by a flashlight beam in his
eyes, he said. Soldiers in black masks threw him on the ground and
handcuffed him.</TE>
<TE>   Like the other 26 detainees, his feet were bound with a chain long
enough so he could shuffle. He was blindfolded, and a mask was pulled
over the blindfold, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They were beating us. They made us bow down. They were beating us
with their hands, their guns," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Two men were killed, escapees say. Those who were detained were tied
to one another, marched to helicopters and flown to Kandahar.</TE>
<TE>   After the ground operation concluded, the witnesses say, a gunship
took over, firing rockets, cannons and guns as it circled the two sites.</TE>
<TE>   One wing of the district office, containing munitions, was leveled.
Two bunkers filled with Taliban munitions were left untouched. Most of
the rest of the building was badly damaged.</TE>
<TE>Locked in a Cage in Kandahar</TE>
<TE>   The school had been struck much harder. Most of the eight
reinforced-concrete rooms have rocket holes in them, some through the
walls, some through the roof. Nine trucks and a mobile antiaircraft
platform, which the weapons commissioners say they had collected from the
Taliban along with the arms, sit in front of the building.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the vehicles were all but shredded by the rocket and cannon
rounds, which were coming in, it appears, as the captives were on their
way to the Kandahar air base.</TE>
<TE>   Once there, the prisoners were tied together again, several said. Then
they were pushed onto their stomachs on a gravel floor, several said,
where they were struck again. That day, their traditional shalwar kameez
pants and shirts were torn off them, they said, and they were given blue
uniforms.</TE>
<TE>   They were locked in a sort of cage, with wooden slats held together by
metal strips. The structure was outdoors, they said, and they could see
soldiers moving about.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the prisoners were questioned for a few minutes the first
or second day--asked their names, their duties, whether they were Taliban
or Al Qaeda members. The interrogators, speaking through an interpreter
dressed in a U.S. uniform, were not pleasant but did not strike them, the
men said. Over the next few days, they were questioned for an hour or two
in a much friendlier manner, they said.</TE>
<TE>   They ate MREs, or meals-ready-to-eat, or, in the case of Rauf, the
police chief, didn't eat them, with the exception of the candy. Two
female doctors issued them a tablet for pain each day if they wanted it.</TE>
<TE>   For reasons that aren't clear, Akhtar Mohammed, the 17- or
18-year-old, was the only one separated from the group, members say. He
was held for eight days by himself in a shipping container, with two
guards sitting by the open door, and then returned to the main pen.</TE>
<TE>   The prisoners never knew they were in Kandahar. They never knew why
they were being held. They had no idea that 21 people had been killed
that night. "Dost, dost, dost!" they had yelled when they were first
captured. "Friend, friend, friend!"</TE>

<DH>Seeing their nation as doomed, Argentines of European descent hope
to find their fortunes in the land of their ancestors. But obtaining
citizenship is a long, tough process.</DH>

<AU>HECTOR TOBAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JOSE LEON SUAREZ, Argentina
</DL>
<LD>Half a century ago, the Caronna family bade farewell to Italy.
Estela Caronna and her three children packed into a bus in Acerenza, a
hillside town in Potenza province, and traveled by boat to a South
American country whose very name was to them synonymous with affluence.
None of them ever returned.</LD>
<LD>   Today, in an Argentina that every day becomes poorer and more violent,
Caronna's granddaughter dreams of that village she's never seen. She
imagines a country of opportunity on the other side of the Atlantic, a
place called Italy.</LD>
<LD>   "I need to get a new start on my life," said Analia Caronna, 19. "Far
away from here." In Italy, she hopes to find "romantic cities and people"
and a "magical" country that offers plenty of jobs.</LD>
<TE>   As Argentina's once-bountiful economy crashes around them, an untold
number of its people are seeking to flee. Thousands have applied in
recent weeks to claim the European citizenship of their parents and
grandparents.</TE>
<TE>   In Buenos Aires, the capital, long lines form most mornings at the
consulates of Italy, Spain, Poland and other countries that, for much of
the 20th century, sent hundreds of thousands of citizens to Argentina.
Many Argentine Jews, the descendants of European immigrants, are seeking
Israeli citizenship under that country's "law of return."</TE>
<TE>   For the approximately 10 million Argentines of Italian descent, the
long lines that begin forming before dawn outside the Italian Consulate
represent the closing of a historical circle.</TE>
<TE>   A century of Italian immigration left its mark on this country in a
national penchant for excitability, a tendency to speak with the hands,
and architectural masterpieces such as the Teatro Colon opera house.
Italian Argentines created the Buenos Aires street slang known as
lunfardo.</TE>
<TE>   "The Italians who came here found a type of promised land," said Felix
Luna, a leading Argentine historian. "People are leaving now because
they've stopped believing in the country."</TE>
<TE>   One in five workers is unemployed, and many banks are on the verge of
collapse, the fruit of a four-year recession, rampant government
corruption and a horribly mismanaged economy.</TE>
<TE>   The crisis is taking on a new dimension today as the government allows
the national currency to float on the open market. Fear that the value of
the peso will fall precipitously has led to a week of hoarding and of
shortages at Argentine markets.</TE>
<TE>   It is perhaps understandable, then, that many Argentines--more than a
third, according to a recent poll--long for greener pastures elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   At the Polish Consulate, long lines began forming in January at about
the same time Argentina devalued its currency and imposed new
restrictions on bank withdrawals.</TE>
<TE>   Those willing to risk deportation from the United States travel to
Miami and other cities on tourist visas and stay to find work. Others
apply for citizenship at the Spanish Consulate, where lines are the
longest--most people here can claim some ancestor from Spain. Even
neighboring Uruguay has reported an increase in the number of Argentines
seeking permanent residency.</TE>
<TE>   At the Italian Consulate, the waiting list for citizenship is 17,000
names long. Some claim citizenship rights based on relatives who came to
Argentina as long ago as the 19th century. Those who apply today might
have to wait two years to become citizens.</TE>
<TE>   "We're working under a lot of pressure here," said Vicenzo Palladino,
the consul general of Italy in Buenos Aires. "We're going to have to hire
five new people to handle the load."</TE>
<TE>   In the face of televised images of the crowds outside the consulate in
Buenos Aires, an Italian senator and a government minister have called
for measures to speed up the return of Italian Argentines to Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Although unemployment in Italy, at 8%, is high by European standards,
it is still less than half the official 22% rate in Argentina. More
important, an Italian passport grants its holder the right to seek work
throughout the European Union.</TE>
<TE>   For the Caronna family, the likely return of granddaughter Analia to
Italy represents the latest chapter in a saga that began in the aftermath
of World War II, when the family patriarch, a bricklayer named Antonio,
first planned a new life in Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   Antonio traveled to South America in 1947, then sent for Estela and
their children two years later. Their youngest son--Analia's father--was
born in Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the family settled in Jose Leon Suarez, a Buenos Aires suburb
that is home to a sizable Italian Argentine community. A banner hanging
over a thoroughfare here proclaims "Italian Citizenship!" and offers help
with the complex application process.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing here, nothing, nothing," said Rafaela Caronna,
Analia's aunt and Antonio's daughter. Her last memory of the town in
southern Italy she left at age 9 is of a neighbor weeping as the bus
pulled away.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Rafaela's son is contemplating a new start in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a smart young man," she said. "He went to college, and still he
hasn't been able to find work."</TE>
<TE>   Analia has just begun her veterinary studies at the University of
Buenos Aires. Since she got the idea that Italy holds the best promise
for her future, she has pursued Italian citizenship with a quiet
determination and may leave before graduation.</TE>
<TE>   "My father didn't want to let me go at first," Analia said. "He said
he didn't want the family to be divided. He was very stubborn about it."</TE>
<TE>   Analia needed her father's help: Argentine-born offspring of Italian
immigrants can apply for citizenship in their parents' homeland and
become dual citizens. Once accepted, they can seek to naturalize their
own children. Those born in Italy have automatic citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   Her father eventually warmed to the idea of her emigrating. He and
Analia spent hours sifting through old boxes filled with dusty family
pictures and heirlooms. They found a collection of pipes belonging to her
late grandfather and her grandmother Estela's Italian birth certificate,
a slip of paper now worth Analia's escape from Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   On a sweltering January morning, with that document in hand, Analia
went to the Italian Consulate to join the block-long line to get
applications for herself and her father. She stood with many others who
were hoping to reclaim a distant tie to a land their families left in the
1940s and '50s.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to leave and see how things go for us over there,"
Gabriela Musolino, an unemployed mother, said as her young child played
on the sidewalk. Musolino's father left the Calabria region of southern
Italy during World War II, in a boat that arrived in Buenos Aires via
Africa.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to find a place to raise my son," Musolino said. She was
considering traveling to the U.S., but her only relative there would not
sponsor her. Italy was an easier choice.</TE>
<TE>   When the consular officials gave Musolino forms to fill out, she
stared at them perplexedly. They were all in Italian, which might as well
be Greek to her.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, Lucia Ordonez sought an application for her two adult
children. Ordonez was born in Italy but left at age 3. Ask her why she
would help her children move to a country that is only a distant memory
to her, and she will tell you the sad story of the family business.</TE>
<TE>   "What it took us a lifetime to build fell apart in just a year," said
Ordonez, 55.</TE>
<TE>   The company, which provided maintenance for office equipment and air
conditioners, once had 14 employees. All have been laid off. The leftover
tools and air conditioners from the failed business fill a room in the
Ordonez home.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very sad for a mother to tell their children they have to
leave," she said. "I would like for them to have another chance in life."</TE>
<TE>   Italy has become an obsession for Ordonez. Recently she rushed to the
consulate after hearing that the Italian government would pay the plane
fare home for wayward citizens, even those who left decades ago. The
rumor was false.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to emigrate is not an easy one for Argentines, who
preserve a strong sense of family unity. Many know that if they leave
their country for a land across the sea, they might be gone forever.</TE>
<TE>   "Our grandparents lived it, they tell how it was," said Ordonez's
24-year-old daughter, Andrea. "They never returned [to Italy]. They
stayed here, they had children."</TE>
<TE>   Andrea is not certain she will leave for Europe once she gets her
Italian passport. She recently spent two months in Miami working odd
jobs, then returned to Buenos Aires, feeling a bit homesick.</TE>
<TE>   Like most members of her generation, she has been assimilated into
Argentine society. Family snapshots show her being honored in her high
schools as an abanderada, carrying the blue-and-white Argentine flag as
the best student in her class.</TE>
<TE>   "I love my country, and I would like to stay and fight for it," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, one of Andrea's friends moved to Milan, Italy, and quickly
found work and friends in a growing Argentine community.</TE>
<TE>   Gabriel Provenzano, 27, moved to Florence a few years ago and spends
much time answering e-mail messages from people back home who wonder what
life is like in Italy.</TE>
<TE>   "How it goes for you [in Italy] depends on how close you are to your
people, your culture," Provenzano wrote on the Argentine Emigrant
Network, a Web site. "I know a lot of Argentines here. Some are very,
very happy. But there are others who think about going back, in spite of
the crisis."</TE>
<TE>   But against the love of family and country, there is a palpable sense
that Argentina is doomed. Andrea, an architecture student at the
University of Buenos Aires, recently worked a year for a magazine that
went bankrupt. The company owes her three months' back pay.</TE>
<TE>   "Here you study to become an architect so that you can get a job at a
gas station or driving a taxi," she said. "To me, that's denigrating. . .
. All the people who have something important to give to the country, the
intellectual class, are leaving."</TE>
<TE>   Today's grim reality stands in sharp contrast to the country that drew
millions of Italians to its shores in waves between 1900 and 1950.</TE>
<TE>   Rafaela Caronna remembers being mesmerized by Buenos Aires five
decades ago. Her mother and father took her to see the holiday parades
that featured the motorcade of President Juan Peron and his glamorous
wife, Eva.</TE>
<TE>   Rafaela's father, who had a third-grade education, made a small
fortune in the construction business. He died of a heart attack at the
age of 60.</TE>
<TE>   "We were lucky enough to live during those good years," Rafaela said.
"There were jobs for everyone. You never were in need of anything, and
you lived with a sense of security. Everyone bought their own house."</TE>
<TE>   The Argentina of today is another world. Her husband's construction
business hasn't had any work in a year.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything has gone bad here," Rafaela said. "I don't know what
Analia is going to do." She pauses to consider the position of the
family's youngest generation, and added, "If I could go, I would."</TE>

<HD>Civil Affairs Troops Aim to Win Afghan Hearts, Minds</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HERAT, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>The war is winding down. Taliban and Al Qaeda gunmen are under
arrest or on the run. American troops are watching and waiting.</LD>
<LD>   Now it's up to guys like Van and Tony.</LD>
<LD>   They were on the job the other day, two U.S. Army sergeants haggling
with a pro-Taliban merchant over a bolt of blue cloth in a seedy textile
bazaar. First the merchant tried to short them on the amount they had
bought. Then he tried to substitute a cheaper fabric.</LD>
<TE>   But nobody puts one over on two highly trained Special Forces
soldiers--especially when they bring along a couple of Afghan gunmen,
courtesy of the local warlord.</TE>
<TE>   Buying fabric to make hospital gowns for indigent Afghan patients is
all in a day's work. Van and Tony, whose surnames cannot be published
under military guidelines, are Army civil affairs specialists who drop
into foreign countries and quietly assess humanitarian needs in the wake
of war.</TE>
<TE>   Carrying wads of crisp $100 bills, they try to fill in the gaps in aid
groups' service networks. In this western Afghan town, they've bought
pharmaceuticals and surgical equipment for a hospital and paid for child
immunizations. They're planning to dredge an irrigation canal to bring
water to drought-stricken farms, rebuild a pontoon bridge vital to aid
convoys, and refurbish a girls' school wrecked by the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   It's not the kind of duty Van and Tony usually perform as Special
Forces soldiers. They never quite envisioned one Green Beret asking
another: Do you like the stripes or the florals?</TE>
<TE>   "It's not soldier's work, but only a soldier can do it," said Van, 33,
a laconic sergeant with a Missouri drawl.</TE>
<TE>   Civil affairs soldiers offer a counterpoint to U.S. airstrikes,
commando attacks and support for warlords during the fighting that routed
the Taliban and Al Qaeda. War destroys; civil affairs rebuilds. It's part
good deeds and part public relations--what the military in Vietnam called
winning hearts and minds.</TE>
<TE>   The civil affairs men look more like backpackers or dirt-bikers than
soldiers. They wear jeans, sweatshirts and scuffed hiking boots. Tony, a
fast-talking Bostonian in his mid-30s, favors orange-tinted sunglasses
and a checkered scarf tied around his head, kaffiyeh-style. Van has the
hanging-around-the-firehouse look, with a sweatshirt and volunteer fire
department T-shirt.</TE>
<TE>   Tony and Van cruise Herat's bazaars and stop at humanitarian aid
offices in a late-model SUV, with Tony at the wheel and their bodyguards
in back, AK-47s leaning against the windows. Van jokes that the biggest
security risk is Tony's driving: "He's only hit a car and a horse so
far."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, things get confusing. They make appointments on local time
but communicate with soldiers on Zulu, or Greenwich mean time. Van keeps
Zulu time on his wristwatch and local time on a watch in his jeans
pocket; he's on his fourth cheap, locally purchased watch.</TE>
<TE>   Everything is relative. Most government offices open, oh, around 8:30
a.m. and shut down after lunch. The local currency, the afghani,
fluctuates maddeningly between 27,000 and 40,000 to the dollar. To make
one purchase of fabric, for $6,000, Van first had to buy 162 million
afghanis--70 pounds of bills that filled a crate.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, for a while there I was a multimillionaire," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers say they have spent $20,000 so far, part of an initial $2
million in Pentagon funds, in Herat and surrounding provinces. The limit
for any project is $300,000. The men also distribute "excess
property"--military surplus tents, clothing, trucks and blankets.</TE>
<TE>A Language Barrier</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers were transferred to civil affairs for these early, risky
days of duty in Herat, paving the way for more traditional reserve and
National Guard civil service types--people Van calls the "real
professionals," such as physicians and engineers. The Special Forces men
were pressed into duty after learning Arabic and studying Middle Eastern
history and politics at Ft. Bragg in North Carolina. So, naturally, they
were shipped to an Asian nation where people speak Dari and Pashto.</TE>
<TE>   "So far we've picked up how to say 'Go straight,' 'Thank you' and
'Goodbye,' " Van said. They don't go anywhere without their interpreter.</TE>
<TE>   There are roughly 100 civil affairs soldiers in the country, with more
planned, according to a U.S. Army spokesman in Kabul, the capital. Their
core mission, one officer said, is "to relieve immediate human
suffering."</TE>
<TE>   With their Special Forces skills, Van and Tony are equipped to operate
in a hostile environment where Taliban supporters are still active. They
don't travel without two gunmen provided by Herat warlord Ismail Khan,
who was supported by U.S. forces when he drove the Taliban from the city
in November. Asked whether the Americans carry weapons, their commander,
a captain named Curt, replied, "Well, we're U.S. soldiers."</TE>
<TE>   One of the first things the Herat team did after arriving several
weeks ago was to seek an audience with Khan, the power broker in five
western provinces. "He's very concerned about our safety," Curt said. "He
seems determined to make sure nothing happens to us. He's been the
perfect host."</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers won't say where they are staying. Khan's security
officers say the Americans live at one of the garrisons used by Khan's
forces, along with about two dozen other U.S. soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to a relaxation of grooming rules in deference to their
unorthodox mission, the soldiers don't shave often. Even Curt, an earnest
and engaging 33-year-old from Minnesota, has a scraggy beard, an Afghan
scarf and hair that has evolved past the crew-cut stage.</TE>
<TE>   The men don't hide who they are or what they're doing, but they do
maintain a low profile. A visit to the bazaar to buy goods for an aid
project can involve a complicated series of radio and satellite calls to
set up security. The soldiers introduce themselves not as Army personnel
but "from USG"--the U.S. government.</TE>
<TE>   Being government employees, they grind out the paperwork. They suggest
projects, which are subject to approval by headquarters in Kabul or
higher up the chain of command. They type up proposals on laptop
computers and e-mail them, complete with digital photos of schools,
clinics, hospitals and bridges.</TE>
<TE>   In the incomprehensible argot of the military, the Herat team is a
CHLC that reports to a C/JCMOTF--a Civil Humanitarian Liaison Cell under
a Combined/Joint Civil Military Operations Task Force.</TE>
<TE>   The men visit elders in rural villages and provincial ministers in the
cities. They meet with aid groups to ensure that they aren't duplicating
services.</TE>
<TE>   During a visit with a UNICEF official, Van discovered that a project
he was considering was also being eyed by an aid group--a fact not
mentioned by the intended local recipient. "These people don't always
share their information with us," Van told the official. "That's why we
check in with you guys."</TE>
<TE>   The work can be trying, the sergeants said, and they miss their wives
and families. Care packages from home sustain them--junk food,
cigarettes, magazines and printouts of e-mails from friends. They can
call home once a week, but Van couldn't wait. "Hey," he said to a
reporter, "tell my wife thanks for the care packages and I love her."</TE>
<TE>Haggling Over Fabric</TE>
<TE>   Van made the request en route to a fabric merchant. Along for the ride
was Ghulam Rabani, director of services at Herat's main hospital, who
would help the soldiers hire people to sew the fabric into gowns and
pajamas.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, Van was on his knees inside the merchant's tiny, airless stall,
rubbing fabric swatches between his fingers. There was much haggling
about quality, quantity and price. Tony, Van and Rabani conducted
simultaneous colloquies about colors and patterns and what would be
suitable for male and female patients.</TE>
<TE>   After negotiations in Dari, Pashto and English, a price was set for a
lovely blue fabric: $420 for 1,000 square meters, or 37 rolls. Van pulled
out his pocket calculator, pounded the digits furiously, then peeled off
four new $100 bills and 800,000 afghanis.</TE>
<TE>   As they were leaving, an interpreter overheard the merchant telling an
associate that he planned to deliver the fabric in yards, not meters,
cheating the soldiers out of several rolls. The interpreter berated the
merchant, saying he was robbing fellow Afghans, not the Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "He's exactly right," Van said. "This stuff is for their own people."</TE>
<TE>   The merchant apologized and sent them to a decrepit warehouse next to
a garbage dump. There, a worker led the soldiers down into a dark
basement. Van held back. "What is this, some kind of ambush?" he asked.
He made certain the bodyguards were properly posted, then ducked into the
darkness to discover that the merchant was trying to sell them a cheaper
fabric of a different color.</TE>
<TE>   They drove back to the merchant. Van was angry but wary. He had been
warned that the merchant and his friends were Taliban supporters.</TE>
<TE>   With the bodyguards bringing up the rear, Van and Tony confronted the
merchant. The man looked stricken. He had been warned by a telephone call
from the warehouse. He silently handed back every last dollar and
afghani.</TE>
<TE>   Van snatched the money from his hand and said he was taking his
business elsewhere. He and Tony and the warlord's gunmen piled into the
vehicle, slowly pulling away in search of the perfect blue fabric.</TE>

<HD>San Diego County Fire Destroys 14 Homes</HD>

<DL>FALLBROOK, Calif.
</DL>
<LD>A fast-moving brush fire pushed by gusty, dry Santa Ana winds
destroyed at least 14 pricey homes in this rural community in northern
San Diego County on Sunday and forced hundreds of residents to flee.</LD>
<LD>   "It was terrifying. The fire was just a quarter-mile away, and the
wind was blowing so hard," said Melissa Copeland, whose house was
threatened. "We had three minutes to get our stuff and get out. We
grabbed the kids and the family pictures. Everything else can be
replaced."</LD>
<LD>   The origin of the fire was unknown. It began about 11 a.m. in the De
Luz Canyon area east of this community of horse ranches and avocado
groves.</LD>
<TE>   "First came the smoke and then the flames down the canyon that chased
us out," said Gaynor Bean, 85, whose home was destroyed. "All I got out
with is my wallet. Sometimes life isn't very good."</TE>
<TE>   Fed by tall, dry brush and whipped by high winds, the crackling flames
leaped from hill to hill, sparing some homes, destroying others.</TE>
<TE>   Six people jumped into a backyard swimming pool and dived beneath the
water while the fire raged above them. They were taken to a hospital
suffering smoke inhalation and hypothermia because of the cold water.</TE>
<TE>   Residents in hundreds of homes were ordered to evacuate by sheriff's
deputies using bullhorns. Many fled just ahead of the flames, taking
their horses and other livestock and pets. Among the rescued animals were
two prized llamas.</TE>
<TE>   "The fire made a roaring sound," said Ron Cullins, whose house was
saved by firefighters. "I could hear explosions everywhere. The heat was
unbearable."</TE>
<TE>   The Fallbrook Hospital emergency room treated at least 11 people for
minor injuries. Two admitted for overnight observation were listed in
stable condition.</TE>
<TE>   By nightfall, officials estimated that more than 2,000 acres had been
burned, making it bigger than Orange County's two-day brush fire near
Anaheim Hills. The San Diego fire was listed as only 5% contained, and
officials hoped that cooler night temperatures would help slow it.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents forced to evacuate were unsure whether their homes had
survived.</TE>
<TE>   "We know the avocado trees across the street were on fire," said a
distraught Gloria Avila.</TE>
<TE>   The fire burned brush on the edge of the Fallbrook Naval Weapons
Station, forcing evacuation of officer housing units although none of the
units were burned. Nine of 10 fire stations at Camp Pendleton were
mobilized to keep the fire from the sprawling base.</TE>
<TE>   The high winds also caused two big rigs to tip over in San Bernardino.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego County fire officials and residents said the fire there,
dubbed the Gavilan Fire because it started on Gavilan Mountain Road,
seemed to race from hilltop to hilltop. Much of the region has not had a
"burn off" in 50 years and brush is up to 20 feet tall, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, homes where owners had taken precautions--putting ice
plant around the property, avoiding certain shingle materials, even
installing sprinklers on roofs--were still damaged or destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just a big pop and a solid wall of fire," said Ralph Cox, 51,
who was trapped in his home until firefighters knocked down the flames to
give him an escape route.</TE>
<TE>   Residents tried desperately to save their homes by using garden hoses
but were hampered by low water pressure and the speed of the fire. Thick,
acrid smoke blanketed much of Fallbrook and was visible in San Diego, 70
miles south.</TE>
<TE>   Pete Jesperson tried to save his in-laws' house until the flames
became too intense and he was forced to flee. The soot-covered Jesperson
clutched an American flag he managed to save and use as a screen to keep
from inhaling the thick smoke.</TE>
<TE>   Six helicopters from the California Department of Forestry and Fire
Protection, nine bulldozers and more than 650 firefighters and 100 fire
engines from departments from San Diego and Orange counties were assigned
to fight the fire. The engines were hampered by narrow, winding roads
leading to the imperiled homes.</TE>
<TE>   Two fire engines, a San Diego Sheriff's Department car and two small
buildings behind homes were destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   Fallbrook, population 30,000, has long been popular with people
looking for a "country lifestyle" within driving range of a major city.
Many of the homes, advertised as "ranchettes," cost $1 million or more
and have mountaintop views that, on a clear day, provide a vista of the
Pacific Ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents complained that the forestry department did not
dispatch air tankers to drop water or fire-retardant chemicals. But
forestry officials said the winds were too high and unpredictable.</TE>
<TE>   An official with the San Diego Fire Department said some structures
might have been saved if San Diego County had its own fire helicopter
rather than relying on outside agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "An aerial resource to coordinate incoming fire units to those remote
areas is critical in attacking a fast-moving wildfire," said Brian
Fennessy of the air operations bureau of the San Diego Fire Department.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, 60 homes in the La Costa section of Carlsbad were destroyed
by fire.</TE>

leading to the imperiled homes.</TE>
<TE>   Two fire engines, a San Diego Sheriff's Department car and two small
buildings behind homes were destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   Fallbrook, population 30,000, has long been popular with people
looking for a "country lifestyle" within driving range of a major city.
Many of the homes, advertised as "ranchettes," cost $1 million or more
and have mountaintop views that, on a clear day, provide a vista of the
Pacific Ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents complained that the forestry department did not
dispatch air tankers to drop water or fire-retardant chemicals. But
forestry officials said the winds were too high and unpredictable.</TE>
<TE>   An official with the San Diego Fire Department said some structures
might have been saved if San Diego County had its own fire helicopter
rather than relying on outside agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "An aerial resource to coordinate incoming fire units to those remote
areas is critical in attacking a fast-moving wildfire," said Brian
Fennessy of the air operations bureau of the San Diego Fire Department.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, 60 homes in the La Costa section of Carlsbad were destroyed
by fire.</TE>

<HD>Gunmen, Rockets Strike Israel</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Two soldiers are killed outside the Israeli army's
southern command headquarters. Palestinian rockets hit farms in the Negev
desert.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJORIE MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Palestinian gunmen killed two Israeli soldiers and seriously
wounded four other people outside the Israeli army's southern command
headquarters in Beersheba on Sunday as Prime Minister Ariel Sharon
returned home from Washington.</LD>
<LD>   In another development likely to provoke an escalation of the military
conflict here, Palestinians fired medium-range Kassam-2 rockets from the
Gaza Strip onto two farms in Israel's Negev desert--the first time the
Palestinians have directed such weapons toward Israel in their nearly
17-month uprising.</LD>
<LD>   The armed Islamic group Hamas claimed responsibility for firing the
rockets, which landed in fields nearly four miles from the Gazan border
in Kibbutz Saad and Moshav Shuva. Nobody was wounded.</LD>
<TE>   Israel recovered three rocket launchers from Palestinian-controlled
territory in Gaza and responded to the day's violence with F-16 aircraft
and helicopter gunship strikes on Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat's security compound and on a steel factory in Gaza. At least 13
people were wounded by the aerial attacks, including two employees of the
United Nations Special Coordinator's office, which was severely damaged.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the Israeli army discovered a truckload of Kassam-2
missiles in the West Bank, and the government renewed warnings that it
would respond to their use with extraordinary force. With a range of
about five to seven miles, the missiles threaten cities well inside
Israel's pre-1967 borders.</TE>
<TE>   "The terror is increasing," Sharon said upon returning to Israel.
"Arafat is directly responsible for it, and the Palestinian Authority is
not taking any measures against it. . . . This compels us to reach
decisions in light of the severe escalation."</TE>
<TE>   The prime minister convened his security Cabinet late Sunday to
discuss Israel's response.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon went to Washington in hopes of persuading President Bush to cut
ties with Arafat and look for "alternative" Palestinian leadership. Bush
agreed to keep pressing Arafat to crack down on the armed groups sending
suicide bombers and gunmen into Israel but said the U.S. would continue
working with him.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres criticized Sharon's
efforts to pick his own Palestinian leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoever wants to look for an alternative leadership need not declare
it from every corner, because the result is the opposite. The result is
that everyone is rallying around Arafat," Peres told Israel's Army Radio.</TE>
<TE>   Israel has confined Arafat to the West Bank city of Ramallah since
December and has placed tanks outside his headquarters there.</TE>
<TE>   During Sharon's four-day trip to Washington, the security situation
continued to deteriorate, with the killing of an Israeli mother and
daughter inside their home in a Jordan Valley settlement, the fatal
stabbing of a woman in Jerusalem and the death of a 79-year-old settler
in a drive-by shooting in the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Then came Sunday's attack in Beersheba, a city that has been
relatively unscathed by the uprising against Israeli occupation. The
assault began about 1:30 p.m. when two Palestinians in civilian clothes
jumped out of a car and began firing automatic rifles near the gates of
the army's southern command headquarters and a bakery next door.</TE>
<TE>   Many soldiers were outside on their lunch break and quickly began
firing back at the attackers, who were shot dead within minutes,
according to witnesses and the army.</TE>
<TE>   "The two men burst out of the car and opened fire in every direction,"
Capt. Guy Shaham told Israel Radio.</TE>
<TE>   "I drew my pistol and shot back. They sprayed gunfire in every
direction. I focused on one of them and shot at him until he fell, and
then his friend saw he fell so he ran to a parking lot and soldiers
coming out of the base shot him," the officer said.</TE>
<TE>   The army said one of the assailants was wearing an explosives belt.</TE>
<TE>   The dead soldiers, both women, were identified as Lt. Keren Rothstein,
20, and Pvt. Aya Malaachi, 18.</TE>
<TE>   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the Beersheba attack,
but Hamas lauded it on its Web site and also boasted that the Kassam-2
missiles mean "security for the Zionists is lost."</TE>
<TE>   After the rocket attacks, Israeli tanks went into
Palestinian-controlled Gaza and recovered three launchers with timing
devices south of Beit Hanoun. One of the launchers reportedly still
contained a rocket.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian militants in Gaza have repeatedly fired mortars at Israeli
communities in and around the strip, but the attacks have rarely caused
serious damage or injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "This is clearly not the range of a mortar, which has a range of three
kilometers [1.9 miles] max," said Jacob Dallal, an Israel Defense Forces
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Dallal said the rockets contained at least 13 pounds of explosives and
left craters about 6 feet deep.</TE>
<TE>   "These could have hit anywhere in the city of Sderot," Dallal said,
referring to a community in the Negev about three miles east of Beit
Hanoun. "Should rockets fall on cities, that would change the whole
configuration of the conflict. That is close to what one sees in a more
conventional war."</TE>
<TE>   At least 836 Palestinians and 256 Israelis have been killed in a cycle
of attack and counterattack since the intifada, or uprising, began in
September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Early today, Israeli tanks entered the West Bank city of Nablus for
about two hours, a day after an incursion there in which troops in tanks
exchanged heavy fire with Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Seven Palestinians were wounded during Sunday's incursion, Palestinian
hospital officials said. The Israeli military said its forces searched
buildings, arrested several people and left the city after about two
hours.</TE>
<TE>   In Gaza, Terje Roed-Larson, the U.N. special coordinator for the
Middle East peace process, condemned Israel for using "heavy tonnage"
bombs near civilian areas and U.N. facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Roed-Larson said in a statement that "Israeli security needs will not
be met by hitting civilian targets or by destroying the Palestinians'
ability to police and maintain order."</TE>
<TE>   In another development, Israeli police acknowledged that a 14-year-old
Palestinian boy detained Friday for the stabbing of a woman in Jerusalem
was shot to death and did not die of a heart attack as they previously
claimed.</TE>
<TE>   A gang of four Palestinian teenagers was arrested after the fatal
stabbing of 25-year-old Moran Amit on Jerusalem's Sherover Promenade on
Friday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Police said that they tracked down the East Jerusalem youths and
called for them to stop but that they kept running. Police opened fire,
injuring one in the arm.</TE>
<TE>   They eventually captured all four, but one of the youths, Samar abu
Miala, 14, collapsed and died a few minutes after he was arrested. Police
initially said that he had had a heart attack and denied that he had been
shot.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, police said that there had been no bullet wound on Abu
Miala's body but that an autopsy showed that he had been shot.
Palestinian sources said the bullet entered Abu Miala's body through the
rectum, hitting his liver and heart.</TE>
<TE>   The three remaining youths reportedly confessed to stabbing Amit.</TE>

<HD>In China, a Trip to the Altar Starts at the Doctor's Office</HD>
<DH>Law: To curb disease, the state requires all brides and grooms to
get exams. But the peeking and probing does sour some love.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHING-CHING NI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SHANGHAI
</DL>
<LD>The 47-year-old construction worker says his wife left him because
his doctor told her a certain body part of his is "too small."</LD>
<LD>   How does the doctor know, and why is it relevant?</LD>
<LD>   Because you can't get married in China without a physical exam. Its
purpose, among other things, is to determine whether couples are not only
willing but also able to carry out the healthy pursuit of pleasure and
procreation.</LD>
<TE>   To most Westerners, this system of peek and probe may seem an
embarrassing and unnecessary intervention from the state. The most a
government would ask of a bride or groom in the United States is a blood
test, and in California, you don't even need that.</TE>
<TE>   But in China, tying the knot, like family planning, is still regarded
as much more than a personal affair. With 1.3 billion mouths to feed,
Beijing considers it critical to scrutinize those who intend to marry and
multiply.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors say the physicals are necessary to curb diseases and ensure
that people with dire mental and physical problems don't reproduce and
burden the state.</TE>
<TE>   The doctor's job is to look for "unmarriageable illnesses," but the
law does not spell out what those illnesses are. So anything from cancer
to schizophrenia, muteness to genital deformity could spur a doctor to
classify someone as unsuitable for holy matrimony.</TE>
<TE>   Many Chinese couples consider the premarital physical a minor
inconvenience for a greater good. This is a country that still uses
physical exams to ration social privileges, from driving a car to
applying for college.</TE>
<TE>   But others feel victimized by the system and say the state is playing
God by engaging in unnatural selection.</TE>
<TE>   A groom-to-be in his 80s made headlines last year when he proposed to
a woman in her 70s. He had no intention of having more children. So he
was outraged to learn that he too had to bare all for the doctor.</TE>
<TE>   One woman sued her doctors because they claimed the lines on her
stomach were stretch marks from a pregnancy. Their claim prompted the
woman's fiance to break off the engagement. The marks were later
attributed to weight loss, and the woman was awarded $900 in damages,
according to a case study published by a legal Web site. The fiance still
refused to go through with the wedding.</TE>
<TE>   The construction worker, interviewed by phone from his home in
northern China's Liaoning province, said his doctor's "too small"
diagnosis was plain wrong. To prove it, he got six other doctors'
opinions, and each of them rated him "normal."</TE>
<TE>   He sued the original physician for slander, but the court ruled that
it was the doctor's job to call it as he saw it.</TE>
<TE>   The couple did marry, but the woman left her husband three months
after their wedding. She couldn't live with the doctor's judgment, said
the construction worker, who did not want his name used.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the only son in the family," he said. "Of course I want to marry
again. But next time, I've got to find a different doctor."</TE>
<TE>   Many experts say China's marriage law is too vague, with too much room
for arbitrary rulings.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue is not whether or not to inspect, but how to inspect and
what to look for," said Xu Anqi, a sociologist at Shanghai's Academy of
Social Sciences. "Some inspecting agencies are poorly regulated. They
don't pay enough attention to the patient's privacy. They look for things
that are irrelevant, such as signs of premarital sex."</TE>
<TE>   Urban residents complain that the government is less strict with
people in the countryside, where medical resources are in short supply.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to enforce in the countryside, but it's very important that
they try," said Tong Jian, a 27-year-old government official from coastal
Jiangsu province, who married last year. "The blood ties there tend to be
very close, and diseases are widespread. Many people do not even know
they are carriers."</TE>
<TE>   For some, the medical exams and byzantine marriage application process
are enough to make them skip the formalities.</TE>
<TE>   One Shanghai couple had hoped to wed but was stymied by the first
requirement on the marriage application: proving that they were single.
The woman had just returned to China after more than 10 years of study in
the United States, so she could not call on an employer or neighborhood
committee to vouch for her. And she was daunted by the request to prove
she had never been married in the U.S. The couple simply gave up.</TE>
<TE>   "I had no idea it was this complicated," said the woman, who
nevertheless wears a sparkling diamond ring and platinum wedding band
that tell the rest of the world--if not the state--that she is, in
essence, married.</TE>

<DL>CAPE TOWN, South Africa
</DL>
<LD>Outraged at being dumped by his girlfriend, a South African man
shot and killed her and nine other people before turning the gun on
himself, police said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Seven others were seriously wounded in the shooting spree by
29-year-old security guard Bulelani Vukwane on Saturday night in the
Mdantsane suburb of East London, about 460 miles east of Cape Town.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier Saturday, Vukwane and his girlfriend, Nolunuyo Mbenya, had a
fight and she ended their relationship, said police spokesman Stephen
Marais.</LD>
<TE>   Vukwane went to Mbenya's house to try to persuade her to reconcile,
and after another argument he shot her dead, witnesses told police.</TE>
<TE>   Marais said Vukwane then went to a bar next door, killed a man and
wounded the owner. He shot the owner of a pickup truck to death and drove
off in the vehicle, then returned to his girlfriend's house and killed
her father, witnesses told investigators.</TE>
<TE>   The gunman began firing at traffic and pedestrians, killing six more
people, witnesses told the Daily Dispatch newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Vukwane fled when police arrived. They gave chase. Finally, Vukwane
pointed his gun at his temple and pulled the trigger, witnesses told the
paper.</TE>
<TE>   The seven wounded were in serious condition at an East London
hospital, Marais said.</TE>
<TE>   Stotshulo Vukwane, the security guard's father, told the Daily
Dispatch that he had seen his son 10 days earlier and that he appeared
happy.</TE>
<TE>   "I am shocked. This is not my son as I knew him," he said.</TE>

<HD>Serbs Bristling Under the Specter of Milosevic's Trial in The Hague</HD>
<DH>Balkans: Collective denial and a sense of victimhood are at work,
analysts say. Ex-leader has taken on mythical status with his fight.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia
</DL>
<LD>Barely two miles from the apartment houses that mark the northwest
limits of this capital lies a training compound for elite police forces
where workers last summer unearthed the torn bodies of scores of ethnic
Albanians killed in the province of Kosovo.</LD>
<LD>   The mass grave brought the ugliness of the Balkan wars close to home
for many Serbs, the people of Yugoslavia's dominant republic. But after
the initial revelation, political leaders and citizens seemed to want
nothing more than to drop the uncomfortable subject. And that sentiment
is at risk of deepening as the trial of former Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic is set to open Tuesday before the International
Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague.</LD>
<LD>   "Every single person I talk to here is very strongly against the Hague
tribunal," said Biljana Kovacevic-Vuco, a human rights lawyer who
supports the tribunal's work. "People start out by saying, 'Yes, we have
to condemn all war criminals,' that 'Srebrenica was very bad, it was a
crime, but . . . but . . . but . . . ' Always 'but,' " she said.</LD>
<TE>   Srebrenica, a town in Bosnia-Herzegovina, was the site of the most
brutal event of the Bosnian war: the massacre over three days of an
estimated 7,000 Muslim men and boys by Serbian forces.</TE>
<TE>   "Serbs cannot believe their countrymen did these things, so there is
sort of a collective denial going on," said Bratislav Grubacic, a
political analyst in Belgrade.</TE>
<TE>   The trial of Milosevic will be a historic event. For the first time, a
former head of state will be called to account for war crimes, including
genocide.</TE>
<TE>   The trial will consolidate the three indictments brought against
Milosevic so that the charges can be presented together. Evidence from
Kosovo will be heard first, followed by evidence from the wars in Bosnia
and Croatia.</TE>
<TE>   In connection with Kosovo, the tribunal prosecutor charged Milosevic
with crimes against humanity and violations of the laws or customs of
war. The charges involving Croatia include violations of the Geneva
Conventions, crimes against humanity and violations of the laws and
customs of war. Only the indictment involving Bosnia includes the charge
of genocide. If found guilty, Milosevic would face life imprisonment.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Williams, a law professor at the American University in
Washington, who worked at the State Department in the early 1990s, helped
to set up the tribunal. According to Williams, it has three main goals:
to create an accurate historical record, to deter future leaders from
allowing war crimes, and to make the individuals responsible for the
crimes answer for them in order to spare the society collective guilt.</TE>
<TE>   Milosevic has sought to undermine the tribunal's mission in ways that
play to a longtime Serbian sense of victimhood and of achieving heroism
through grand defeats. Among his first public statements was that the
tribunal is "a false tribunal" with no authority to put him on trial. It
is the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that ought to be tried for war
crimes, he said, since civilians were killed when the alliance's forces
bombed Serbia during the war in Kosovo.</TE>
<TE>   Viewed through the Serbian looking glass, this defiant demeanor makes
Milosevic a larger-than-life--potentially even mythical--figure in
Serbia. In conversations now, people often mention that his transfer to
The Hague occurred on St. Vitus' Day, June 28, the same day Serbs fought
the now legendary 1389 battle of Kosovo. They lost that battle
spectacularly but elevated it into a heroic event by describing the
defeat as the choice of a heavenly victory over an earthly one.</TE>
<TE>   "He was delivered to The Hague on June 28, the holiest day for all
Serbs," said Andrija Vujovic, 24, a student of history at Belgrade
University, who resents the Hague tribunal for a litany of reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "This has begun to create a myth of Milosevic as a great fighter. It
looks like The Hague is doing public relations for him," Vujovic said,
adding that although he dislikes Milosevic, the former president's crimes
were against the Serbian people, whom he bankrupted, not against the
West.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the Hague tribunal and prosecutor Carla Del Ponte have said
repeatedly that this is a trial of Milosevic alone, not of the Serbian
people. But both because Milosevic's basic policies are being called into
question and because there has been little explanation of the purpose of
the tribunal by the current government, people in Serbia find it easy to
believe that they stand accused along with Milosevic. That view is being
actively promoted by many prominent Serbs, including several lawyers who
are acting as informal advisors to Milosevic.</TE>
<TE>   "In the trial that starts on Feb. 12, Yugoslavia is on trial, Serbia
is on trial," said Zdenko Tomanovic, a Belgrade attorney who recently
visited Milosevic and who gave a news conference last week.</TE>
<TE>   From pensioners to university students, there appears to be
considerable support here for Milosevic's approach, along with a
hardening of views toward The Hague and the West.</TE>
<TE>   "It is obvious that this is a political court, and it's obvious now
that everything is fabricated and it's mostly fabricated against the
Serbian people," said Dragan Petrovic, 77, who was reading a newspaper
and chatting with friends by the Danube on an unseasonably warm January
day.</TE>
<TE>   "I support Milosevic in everything he is doing in The Hague. He is a
superb patriot. He's defending the Serbian nation, not himself," added
Petrovic, who said he likes Milosevic far more now than when he was
president.</TE>
<TE>   Many political leaders, lawyers and independent analysts have
concluded that the only thing that might make the Hague proceedings
credible, at least to the Serbs, would be a good defense of Milosevic.</TE>
<TE>   Such a defense would permit questions about some of the gray areas in
the Balkan wars and thereby create a more nuanced picture for the
historical record. For instance, a defense lawyer--Milosevic has so far
refused to hire one--might point out that although atrocities were
committed by Serbs in Croatia, the result was the expulsion of tens of
thousands of Serbs, many of whom continue to live as impoverished
refugees in Serbia. And while Milosevic is now in prison in The Hague,
the Croatian president at the time, Franjo Tudjman, was never called to
account.</TE>
<TE>   "You'll never get an accurate historical record because Tudjman was
never indicted," said Williams, the former State Department lawyer.
Tudjman died in December 1999, before the tribunal could charge him.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, before Milosevic took military action in Kosovo, there
was considerable rebel activity there by the Kosovo Liberation Army, or
KLA, which was made up of ethnic Albanians. That is a crucial difference
from the situation when Bosnian Serb military forces, supported by the
Yugoslav army, began to kill and expel Bosnian Muslims, said Hurst
Hannum, a law professor at the Fletcher School of International Law and
Diplomacy at Tufts University.</TE>
<TE>   "The expulsions in Kosovo began after the KLA had started a guerrilla
war," said Hannum, who is also co-director of the school's Center for
Human Rights and Conflict Resolution.</TE>
<TE>   But no one feels as strongly about the need for a trial that Serbia
will heed than the Serbian liberals, intellectuals and members of the
government who opposed Milosevic. They see the Serbian point of view as
well as that of the West, and they want to find a way for each to inform
the other.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very important to shed light on events, on what really
happened, what took place," said Dragoljub Micunovic, the speaker of the
lower house of parliament.</TE>
<TE>   "The Hague is writing the history of the Balkans, and one institution
and one author is too few for it to be objective. We as a state have an
obligation to help the Hague tribunal see all the facts--we would be
helping the court but also the public to understand," said Micunovic, who
favors having the government hire a lawyer to represent the people if
Milosevic refuses to retain one.</TE>
<TE>   Liljana Smajlovic, a political analyst, said that for Serbs to
consider the unbearable acts of violence that were committed during the
period, it is important for them to hear the discussion from someone they
have faith in, rather than Del Ponte, the chief prosecutor at the
tribunal.</TE>
<TE>   "If Serbs are told a story about how things happened that is clearly
authentic and shows how people resort to such cruel behaviors, and if
it's told by someone they can trust, then they can begin to come to terms
with it," Smajlovic said.</TE>
<TE>   "At the moment, Serbs see the trial as a fixed fight. It's in the
interest of the country that our case be stated to an international
audience in a system that has a high standard of proof. Even when you
list all the Serb arguments, there's still the fact that bad things were
done, but it allows people to stomach it," she said.</TE>

<HD>Little Progress in Pearl Case</HD>
<DH>Pakistan: Rumors and half-truths complicate the search for the
journalist. Silence stumps investigator.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFFREY MOHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>As the investigation crawled along in its third week, the case of
kidnapped Wall Street Journal correspondent Daniel Pearl showed little
signs of progress Sunday beyond the realms of speculation and
half-truths.</LD>
<LD>   Pearl, 38, the Journal's South Asia correspondent, disappeared Jan. 23
in the Pakistani port city of Karachi en route to what he believed was an
interview with the leader of an Islamic extremist group.</LD>
<LD>   Subsequently, two e-mailed screeds against the U.S. announced that he
was being held hostage by a hitherto unknown group dubbed the National
Movement for the Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty, which demanded the
release of Pakistanis captured by American forces in Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   Since then, there have been reports of his death, denials and rumors
of his release.</TE>
<TE>   A top investigator conceded Sunday that he was stumped by the silence
from the leading suspect, Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh, a British-born
Pakistani product of English private schools and a hard-core Islamic
jihad ideology picked up in the Balkans and the Himalayan region of
Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   The last authorities heard of Sheikh was early last week, in a brief
cell phone conversation he had with an aunt who lives in the eastern city
of Lahore while police, who have held the woman under virtual house
arrest, tried to trace the call.</TE>
<TE>   "It was hardly a minute long, and then he closed off the phone," said
Syed Kamel Shah, inspector general of police in Sindh province, where
Karachi is located. "He shut it off, and we couldn't find him. She wanted
him to surrender. She said, 'The police have reached us, so if you have
this person, you better let him go.' "</TE>
<TE>   The sudden disconnection now echoes for investigators, who managed to
determine that Sheikh had moved north from Karachi into heavily populated
central Punjab province. They describe him as clever and organized, with
a long resume of kidnappings for Muslim causes and ties to Osama bin
Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network. He was sufficiently important to Al
Qaeda that terrorists hijacked a passenger jet to Kandahar, Afghanistan,
in 1999 to win his release from an Indian jail.</TE>
<TE>   While Sheikh apparently walks free in Punjab or elsewhere, Pearl is
believed to be alive and captive in Karachi, Shah said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not 100% sure he's in Karachi--he could have been moved
out--but there's more chance he's in Karachi," Shah said.</TE>
<TE>   "Had it been otherwise, it would've become apparent," he added of the
assumption that Pearl is alive. "They would like to publicize it."</TE>
<TE>   One thing is certain: Pearl did not sneak out of the country under
cover of darkness, as some of the local press would have it.</TE>
<TE>   A report in the English-language Dawn newspaper said a Daniel Pearl
was ticketed to fly to London from Islamabad, the capital, on Friday, and
a subsequent report told in conspiratorial tones of a mysterious
cancellation of that ticket. The Urdu-language press has been even more
direct in suggesting that Pearl has long since left the country.</TE>
<TE>   It turns out that British citizen Damien Pearl did indeed reserve a
Friday flight, canceled it and then flew home Saturday. His name had been
wrongly entered as Daniel Pearl.</TE>
<TE>   "It was spelled wrong," explained Hassan Shahzad, manager of Waqas
Travel in Islamabad, which was visited by intelligence officials and
police shortly after the Dawn report was published.</TE>
<TE>   "He said 'Damien Pearl' and the clerk wrote 'Daniel Pearl,' " Shahzad
said. "I knew about Daniel Pearl, but it said clearly he was from the
U.K. On Friday, he came in and showed his passport, and we changed the
ticket."</TE>
<TE>   Presumably, Damien Pearl is safe in London. As for Daniel Pearl, Shah
said he expected a break in the case within several days, based on
pressure on Sheikh's family and the arrest last week of three men who say
they sent the e-mails, along with electronic photographs, at Sheikh's
behest.</TE>
<TE>   "We are hopeful our efforts will bear fruit," Shah said. "It's
difficult to predict, but maybe in a couple of days."</TE>

<HD>Iran Shuts Offices of Warlord</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>TEHRAN
</DL>
<LD>Iran has closed the offices of a former Afghan warlord who opposes
Afghanistan's interim government and the strong new U.S. role in that
country, one of his aides said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The closing of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's offices in the Iranian capital,
Tehran, and the eastern city of Mashhad appears to be a conciliatory
gesture toward the United States. U.S. officials have accused Iran of
trying to destabilize the new Afghan government.</LD>
<LD>   The aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, would not give details
about the closure. But Interior Minister Abdul Vahed Musavi-Lari said:
"Iran is no place for any one or group that resorts to mischief. We will
pursue the issue of Hekmatyar through our intelligence ministry and other
channels and make a due decision about him."</LD>
<TE>   Tehran University politics lecturer Hamidreza Jalaipour said the move
is "a green light to the world and the Americans that shows Iran's
foreign policy is based on dialogue and friendship."</TE>
<TE>   Hekmatyar, a leading Afghan warlord who fought Soviet occupation in
the 1980s and once served as prime minister, expressed scorn for the
interim government of Hamid Karzai in an interview last week, saying it
was installed by foreign troops occupying Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a lot of organized forces. They have weapons, and we are in
contact with them," Hekmatyar said. "While foreign troops are present,
the interim government does not have any value or meaning."</TE>
<TE>   Gul Agha Shirzai, the powerful governor of Afghanistan's Kandahar
province, last month accused Hekmatyar and Al Qaeda members of intending
to use their forces to provoke a new civil war in Afghanistan and topple

<LD>A Philadelphia couple who made off with more than $35,000 when a
cash machine began spewing $100 bills called police and returned some of
the money, but more than half was still missing, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said they would consider theft charges against Willie and
Tawanda Anderson, who told police they gave cash to friends and bought
gifts for their five children.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, the couple took their $2,200 Internal Revenue Service
refund check to H&amp;R Block, which operates a machine that cashes refund
checks. Instead of dispensing $2,200, the machine spit out $100 bills
until an employee shut off the power, $72,000 later. Police said the
Andersons scooped up wads of bills and took off with about $35,500.</LD>

<HD>Death Penalty Study Suggests Errors</HD>
<DH>Executions: States with the highest rates of capital punishment
sentences also have the highest rates of reversals, research finds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A disproportionately high percentage of death sentences tend to be
reversed in states where death verdicts are rendered the most often,
according to a comprehensive study released today.</LD>
<LD>   All but one of the 10 states with the highest death-sentencing rates
had overall reversal rates that exceeded 68%--the national
average--according to the review of more than 5,000 capital cases over 23
years by Columbia University law professor James S. Liebman, assisted by
criminologists and statisticians.</LD>
<LD>   "Heavy and indiscriminate use of the death penalty creates a high risk
that mistakes will occur," said Liebman, who has argued on behalf of
defendants in several death penalty cases at the U.S. Supreme Court.</LD>
<TE>   The study is being released at a time when support for capital
punishment has diminished significantly in national polls, with
legislation being introduced at the state and federal level to reform the
death penalty process, and even two Supreme Court justices--Sandra Day
O'Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg--having recently expressed doubts about
whether the process is working fairly.</TE>
<TE>   In a speech last summer, O'Connor said, "If statistics are any
indication, the system may well be allowing some innocent defendants to
be executed." Ginsburg said last April that in dozens of instances where
she has reviewed requests for stays of executions on the high court, she
has yet to see one "in which the defendant was well represented at
trial."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, (D-Vt.), who has introduced a package of
capital punishment reforms, says Liebman's study shows that "the death
penalty is riddled with errors and inconsistencies nationwide."</TE>
<TE>   "When the legal machinery of the death penalty is broken, practice
does not make perfect," added Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Leahy,
commenting on the study's finding that states which render the most death
verdicts per 1,000 homicides appear to be the most error-prone.</TE>
<TE>   Kent S. Scheidegger, executive director of the Criminal Justice Legal
Foundation, a conservative group in Sacramento, blasted the study as
biased.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that a large percentage of capital verdicts are overturned
is not news," he said. "The controversy is . . . whether that number
reflects problems in the system for trying capital cases, as the
anti-death penalty group contends, or whether it constitutes obstruction
of valid, deserved sentences, as death penalty supporters have long
contended."</TE>
<TE>   In a June 2000 study, Liebman and his colleagues found that state and
federal courts nationwide were overturning death sentences in 68% of all
capital cases. Only 18% of those who had their cases retried got the
death penalty and a number of those were reversed again on appeal.
Moreover, 9% of those retried were acquitted.</TE>
<TE>'An Intolerable Risk'</TE>
<TE>   In the new study, Liebman examined "why the high number of flawed
capital verdicts poses an intolerable risk of seriously unreliable
capital outcomes, including execution of the innocent."</TE>
<TE>   His research showed a significant correlation between high death
sentencing rates and reversals.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 10 states with the highest death sentencing rates, nine
exceeded the national average reversal rate of 68%, with Mississippi
leading at 92%.</TE>
<TE>   The others were Idaho, Oklahoma, Arizona, Nevada, Arizona, Alabama,
Montana, Florida and North Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   With a 30% reversal rate, Delaware was the only one of the 10 with a
lower rate than the national average.</TE>
<TE>   Texas, which leads the nation in executions carried out, was slightly
below average with 16 death sentences per 1,000 homicides and a 51%
reversal rate.</TE>
<TE>   More than 70% of the states that have death penalty laws executed
fewer than 8% of the people they sentenced to die during the 1973 to 1995
study period.</TE>
<TE>   The study does not contend that any specific innocent person has been
executed.</TE>
<TE>   However, the authors emphasized that thus far 99 people have been
released from death rows around the country in the last 25 years after
being exonerated.</TE>
<TE>   Among the reasons for the wrongful convictions are prosecutorial
misconduct, mistaken identification or newly discovered exculpatory
evidence, including DNA tests that have led to 11 of the exonerations.</TE>
<TE>   A review of the wrongful convictions raises questions about whether
the nation's courts provide an adequate safety net to discover these
errors, Liebman said.</TE>
<TE>   "In 63 of 99 exonerations the mistake was discovered only after the
highest state court had upheld the capital verdict at least once," the
study explains. In 35 instances, the mistake was not discovered until
after both a state and federal court had upheld the death sentence and in
nine instances after there had been three levels of review.</TE>
<TE>   One of the nine, Anthony Porter of Illinois, was only hours from
execution in 1999 when he got an emergency reprieve after a judge
concluded that he might be too retarded to comprehend why he was being
executed for a double homicide.</TE>
<TE>   During the time when Porter's mental acuity was being reviewed, a
group of Northwestern University journalism students, led by professor
David Protess, tracked down a man named Alstory Simon who, five witnesses
said, had killed the victims in a fight over drugs. Simon admitted being
the killer to the students, pleaded guilty, and Porter was freed after 17
years on death row.</TE>
<TE>   Porter's original attorney had failed to interview the five witnesses,
and before the dramatic turn of events several appellate courts had
refused to consider what Porter's new lawyers said about the five
witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Two of those courts--one state and one federal--ruled that even though
Porter's trial lawyer had acted incompetently, his new attorneys had
failed to show that he had been harmed by the negligence.</TE>
<TE>Moratorium Declared</TE>
<TE>   Porter's case, one of 13 death row exonerations in Illinois, played a
key role in Republican Gov. George Ryan's decision in February to declare
a moratorium on executions in his state.</TE>
<TE>   Liebman said the Porter case illustrates "just how high a bar" the
nation's appellate courts have set for an inmate to establish that there
has been serious, reversible error in his case.</TE>
<TE>   The largest number of exonerations--22--has come in Florida, which has
the nation's third-largest death row, trailing only California and Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Three men have been released from California's death row and seven
from Texas' after determinations that the convictions were invalid.</TE>
<TE>   The study found higher percentages of reversible error in states where
courts were underfunded, where the overall rate of solving crimes is low
and where judges are elected.</TE>
<TE>   The study also shows that only a small fraction of murders result in
convictions, no less death sentences or executions. The winnowing process
is striking.</TE>
<TE>   There were 331,949 homicides during the study period but only a third
of those--118,992--led to murder convictions. Just one in 20 of those
convictions--5,826--led to a death sentence. Only 358 of those sentences
were affirmed by the end of 1995, and 313 of those individuals were
executed--meaning that just 5% of the death sentences were carried out.</TE>
<TE>   Since the end of 1995, there have been 446 executions in the U.S. But
the authors say tentative findings from the last six years indicate the
trends in the study are unchanged.</TE>
<TE>   The authors suggest a number of policy changes to help reduce the
number of reversals. Prime among them is a recommendation that
prosecutors seek the death penalty only in "very highly aggravated
cases."</TE>

<HD>Post-Enron, Congress Must Reassure Investors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After Enron, the accounting and securities industries are in the
same uncomfortable position as the airlines after Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   To reassure fliers wary of the skies after the terrorist hijackings,
the airline industry had to accept a long list of federal safety
regulations it had long grounded. Likewise, to lure back investors
fearful of more Enron-like accounting scandals, the investment industries
may now have to accept new federal investor protections they have long
blocked. That makes this a good time to think boldly about reforming not
only the accounting process, but the safeguards built into the basic
governing structure of public corporations.</LD>
<LD>   It's important for Congress to act quickly, before the Enron outrage
fades and the special interests now lying low reassert themselves.
Accounting is a good place to start. Enron Corp. has revealed a breakdown
at every level, from standard-setting and regulation to the individual
accounting firms flyspecking the books in an audit.</LD>
<TE>   The problem starts with the obscure Financial Accounting Standards
Board, which writes the rules companies follow in reporting their
financial results. Dominated by the accounting industry and whipsawed by
political pressures, the board has proved incapable of establishing
standards that produce revealing financial reports. At times the board
has become incapable of producing any decision at all; with powerful
companies resistant to true disclosure, the board has spent 20 years
debating the rules governing the sort of off-books subsidiaries central
to the Enron scandal. Like Penelope at her loom in the "Odyssey," the
point of the exercise increasingly appears to be the delay itself.</TE>
<TE>   "FASB seems to be incapable of crafting rules that ensure that the
economic reality of corporate performance gets disclosed in the face of
opposition from the management of those corporations, their auditors, and
the politicians they have contributed money to," says Damon Silvers,
associate general counsel at the AFL-CIO.</TE>
<TE>   As Silvers suggests, Congress can be part of the problem; the only
time legislators usually pay attention to FASB is to lobby against
proposals that powerful interests don't like (such as the board's failed
attempt a few years ago to require that companies list stock options for
executives as an expense on their balance sheets). But Congress could
become part of the solution. Sens. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) and Jon
Corzine (D-N.J.) are drafting legislation that would reduce the board's
dependence on industry financing and impose time limits on its
decision-making. Even if that bill doesn't pass, it could become a lever
to force overdue changes at the board.</TE>
<TE>   The next breakdown has been in the industry's self-regulatory
organizations that are supposed to oversee and discipline auditors.
Harvey Pitt, the former accounting industry lawyer whom President Bush
named to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission, has proposed
replacing the anemic system of industry self-policing with a
still-amorphous new oversight panel that would include representatives
from inside and outside the accounting business. Investor advocates want
to maximize the new body's independence from the accounting firms and its
power to investigate and sanction. Given Pitt's long-standing skepticism
of federal regulation, it probably will take sustained pressure to ensure
any meaningful change.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, an accounting industry-generated uprising in Congress forced
Arthur Levitt, President Clinton's chairman of the SEC, to drop a
proposal to bar accounting firms from consulting for the companies they
also audit. It's a measure of the changed environment that all of the Big
Five accounting firms now are voluntarily pledging to construct more
walls between auditing and consulting.</TE>
<TE>   Congress may seek to strengthen their resolve by writing those
prohibitions into law. But watchdog groups say it's a mistake to think
that barring auditors from consulting will ensure their independence. The
problem is more fundamental, says Sarah Teslik, executive director of the
Council of Institutional Investors, a coalition of 250 pension funds
controlling nearly $2 trillion in assets. "As long as management hires
the auditors, they will be conflicted," she says. "You can talk all you
want about self-regulation and public oversight, but as long as your
bread is buttered by the people who want you to bless their books, you
are going to bless their books."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Richard H. Baker (R-La.), chairman of the House Financial
Services subcommittee on capital markets, is floating the most intriguing
and imaginative response to that dilemma. Baker is asking whether it
would be feasible to shift responsibility for hiring and paying auditors
from individual companies to the stock exchanges (which could fund the
cost with fees on their members). As Baker noted last week, such a shift
"would change the culture on Wall Street and across America." It's an
idea well worth exploring.</TE>
<TE>   But any combination of accounting reforms will only address part of
the challenge. The first line of defense against management misconduct
has to be a company's board of directors. Too few now play that role.</TE>
<TE>   One way to strengthen oversight would be to fortify the independence
of corporate boards. In a reform package last week, the Council of
Institutional Investors proposed that publicly traded companies be
required to fill a majority of their boards with directors independent
from management. The council also urged that the SEC toughen the standard
of what constitutes an independent director to eliminate subtle
conflicts, such as contributions from company management to charities
tied to board members. An extensive AFL-CIO investigation last month
found that four of the eight ostensibly independent Enron board members
had ties to management that current SEC rules did not require them to
reveal.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond these structural and regulatory changes, the best way to ensure
more vigilant corporate boards may be the power of example. Providing
jail time, and not just fines, for any Enron executives or board members
who are found to have broken the law could focus the attention of
corporate boards in a way that reams of new regulations may not. "It is,"
Teslik says, "probably the single easiest, cheapest reform that could
occur to make corporate boards do their job."</TE>

<LD>Chronic work stress and divorce can be a deadly combination for
men, a new study has found.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and
the State University of New York in Oswego studied data from 12,366
patients who participated in the seven-year Multiple Risk Factor
Intervention Trial.</LD>
<LD>   The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, will be
published in the current issue of the Archives of Internal Medicine.</LD>
<TE>   Of 10,904 men who were married at the start of the trial, the
researchers found those who stayed married were less likely to die than
those who divorced.</TE>

<HD>Mice Created by Cloning Have Shorter Life Spans, Study Finds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSIE MESTEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cloned mice die earlier than mice conceived in natural ways,
according to research that suggests that cloning causes subtle
abnormalities that may not be immediately detectable in animals that look
healthy.</LD>
<LD>   The study is small in size and thus not definitive. But it is the
first to examine the life span of cloned creatures. It joins several
earlier studies that reported defects in cloned animals that survived to
birth. Those defects include abnormal body sizes and placentas as well as
possible immune system problems. Some research also has suggested that a
cellular structure that is related to aging may be abnormal in clones.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists say the research, published in the journal Nature Genetics,
is one more piece of evidence that the genes of cloned creatures--because
they come from adult cells instead of eggs and sperm--may not be properly
reprogrammed, leading to an array of developmental glitches.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not surprised at all," said Dr. Rudolf Jaenisch, professor of
biology at the Whitehead Institute and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, who has cited safety concerns in his public opposition to the
cloning of humans. "It has exactly confirmed my strong belief and that of
others. I think that most clones, if not all, have subtle defects."</TE>
<TE>   But in a commentary that accompanied the report of the new research,
scientists who support more aggressive efforts to develop clones argued
that the problems may be more a matter of current methods of cloning than
an intractable biological barrier.</TE>
<TE>   Today's cloning methods, involving elaborate microsurgery to add and
remove DNA to cells, "are potentially traumatic" to the cells, said Tony
Perry, a molecular embryologist at Advanced Cell Technology Inc., a
Worcester, Mass., company involved in cloning research. "Maybe we can
improve the techniques," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cloning technology involves removing genetic material from an egg and
replacing it with DNA from another cell. This results in creatures that
are clones--genetically identical to the animal that donated the DNA.</TE>
<TE>   Many scientists hope that clones will someday supply tissues for the
repair of organs. The prospect of using cloning to create human babies is
much more controversial. Most cloned embryos do not survive to birth and
those that do often die soon after.</TE>
<TE>   The new study was conducted by Japanese scientists led by Atsuo Ogura
of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Tokyo. The
researchers compared 12 mice created by cloning with seven derived from
natural mating and six derived by injecting DNA from an immature sperm
cell into an egg.</TE>
<TE>   The scientists monitored the animals' weight and blood chemicals. The
cloned mice, which were genetically the same as the other two groups, had
higher blood levels of ammonia and a liver enzyme in their blood,
suggesting that their livers weren't functioning properly.</TE>
<TE>   They also died prematurely. At 800 days after birth, 10 of the 12
cloned mice were dead. Only one of the group derived from natural mating
and two from the injected group had died during this time period.</TE>
<TE>   Post-mortem examination of six dead cloned mice revealed that all had
severe pneumonia, four had severely damaged livers and two had cancerous
tumors.</TE>
<TE>   "The possible negative long-term effects of cloning . . . give cause
for concern about attempts to clone humans for reproductive purposes,"
the authors concluded.</TE>

<LD>Procter &amp; Gamble Co. of Cincinnati is developing a testosterone
patch it says could restore the sex drive in post-menopausal women.</LD>
<LD>   The patch, called Intrinsa, won't be available for several years.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly transparent and the size of an egg, the patch is worn just
below the navel and changed about twice weekly.</LD>
<TE>   Large-scale testing of the patch in volunteers starts this month, one
of the last stages before U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval.</TE>
<TE>   While generally associated with the male sex drive, testosterone also
is needed for the female response. Studies have shown levels of the
hormone fall after menopause.</TE>
