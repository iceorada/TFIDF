<HD>No Advice This Time, Just a Call to Police</HD>
<DH>Media* Dear Abby decided it was worth betraying the
confidence of a letter-writer who said he was attracted to underage
girls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It began like a typical letter to Dear Abby. A young man was having
difficulty relating to women his age. They all seemed to have an
agenda, he wrote. He did have one nice relationship in his life, with
a 10-year-old girl. She liked him for who he was, he said, and she
and her 3-year-old sister trusted him. The problem was he had sexual
urges toward the girls--daughters of a female friend--and he didn't
know what he should do.</LD>
<LD>   For a day or so, neither did Dear Abby. He had signed his name and
the city in which he lived. Jeanne Phillips, who took over the bulk
of the column from her mother, Pauline Phillips, 10 years ago, had
never read a letter like it. None of her standard ways of offering
advice--phone calls, personal letters, publication in her
column--seemed appropriate.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought, well, I could write to him and tell him to get help,"
she said, "but who knew what would happen then? I really felt for the
man, and he had reached out to me for help, but all I could think of
was those girls and the line where he said they trusted him. I
realized an intervention had to be done."</LD>
<TE>   So instead of telling the man to "seek professional help," last
week, Phillips called the police in Milwaukee, where he lives.</TE>
<TE>   "I told them what the letter said and I asked them if they could
please just do some checking," she said. "The detective said he would
get back to me."</TE>
<TE>   He didn't, and Phillips, who lives in Los Angeles, subsequently
flew to Washington, D.C., to attend the Gridiron dinner and meet with
the Department of Navy about the success of OperationDearAbby.net, a
Web site for Americans to write to the troops deployed in
Afghanistan. Then on Tuesday, her assistant called to tell her that
the Milwaukee police had arrested Paul Weiser, 28, based on her tip.</TE>
<TE>   When visited by local investigators, Weiser had admitted writing
the letter but denied having ever acted on his urges, according to
Milwaukee Asst. Dist. Atty. Paul Tiffin. Weiser cooperated with the
police and allowed them to take his home computer, which he said in a
statement contained pornographic videos and images of children. He
was later arrested and charged with three counts of possession of
child pornography. He was released on $10,000 bail and ordered not to
use a computer or have unsupervised visits with anyone younger than
18. A preliminary hearing has been set for March 24.</TE>
<TE>   "The police went to talk to him, and he talked," said Tiffin,
adding that in his statement to the police, Weiser said he's known he
has had a problem since he was 16. He said he'd tried to get help
from four doctors in the past but had been told he was fine. "He said
he never acted on his desires," Tiffin said, "but that he felt there
was a monster inside him and he wanted to get help."</TE>
<TE>   "Dear Abby was his last hope, I guess," said Phillips, who had
been told by police that Weiser felt "relieved" by his arrest.</TE>
<TE>   This is not the first time Phillips has contacted authorities on
behalf of a child's welfare--whenever she gets a letter from an
abused child, she will call the appropriate child services in the
area. And she once received a letter from a hired killer who was
experiencing doubts.</TE>
<TE>   "He felt that the person he had been hired to kill did not deserve
to die," Phillips said. Although she had no names to go on, she had a
town, and so she called the police and gave them all the information
she had gleaned from the man's letter. "They told me it was
remarkably similar to an anonymous tip they had received."</TE>
<TE>   No arrests were made in that case, but Phillips said the police
assured her that no murder had been committed either. "I think [the
police] made their presence known so whoever was behind it changed
their mind."</TE>
<TE>   Although many of the thousands of letters Dear Abby receives each
day are confessional in nature, very few include details of criminal
activity. A letter might accuse someone "of being such a louse he
cheats on his taxes," Phillips said, "but I'm not about to follow up
with the IRS."</TE>
<TE>   Phillips said she felt bad about betraying the man's trust but
added that Dear Abby is not bound by the anonymity of the church
confessional or a psychiatrist's office. She in turn had hoped that
her participation in the case would be kept confidential. Since the
story appeared in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on Tuesday, the Dear
Abby office has been inundated with calls from the press. "I do feel
a bit betrayed," she said. "I think it would have been better if it
had been done quietly."</TE>
<TE>   She said she hopes all the attention doesn't change people's
attitudes toward the column. "I was just doing my J-O-B," she said,
"and my job is to help people."</TE>
<TE>   At first, she said, she was mystified at the amount of attention
the story got. "But now I think it has something to do with the girl
[Danielle Van Dam] who was killed in San Diego and all the problems
the Catholic Church is facing now. People are very aware now of this
problem."</TE>
<TE>   And in a week in which the headlines have been full of children
brutalized at the hands of adults, hers was the only story with
anything like a happy ending.</TE>

<LD>A FOREST OF TIME</LD>
<LD>   American Indian Ways of History</LD>
<LD>   By Peter Nabokov</LD>
<TE>   Cambridge University Press</TE>
<TE>   246 pages, $20 paperback</TE>
<TE>   "I am very glad to demonstrate to you that we also have books,"
said a Zuni storyteller quoted in Peter Nabokov's "A Forest of Time,"
"only they are not books with marks in them, but words in our hearts,
which have been placed there by our ancients long ago, even so long
as when the world was new and young, like unripe fruit."</TE>
<TE>   Nabokov, professor of American Indian studies and world arts and
cultures at UCLA, surveys the diverse yet related ways in which the
American Indians, who had no writing, preserved and passed on
memories of their past and conceptions of their place in the world
through their oral traditions.</TE>
<TE>   "The Indian needs no writing," explained an Ogalalla Sioux. "Words
that are true sink deep into his heart where they remain. He never
forgets them. On the other hand, if the white man loses his paper, he
is helpless."</TE>
<TE>   Storytelling was everything. All Indians were aware of it; all
heard their stories told and retold. Often tribes had special
categories of members who, gifted with good memory, were charged with
keeping their stories and passing them on. These oral traditions
presented special difficulties for the settlers who came to North
America and tried, some of them, to find out who the Indians were.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the greatest 19th century American historians, William H.
Prescott and Francis Parkman, disdained the Indians' accounts of the
contest for the continent, Nabokov writes. Prescott, he says, made
the conscious choice "to suppress the nativist side of the story in
his 'Conquest of Mexico.'" Parkman, he reports, said that "Indian
traditions are rarely of any value as historical evidence" as he was
writing "France and England in North America."</TE>
<TE>   Since then white scholars of all sorts have tried harder to
understand and limn the Indian ways of thought, perception and
expression. In recent years they have been increasingly joined by
Native American scholars.</TE>
<TE>   Nabokov thoroughly and sympathetically surveys the results of
these scholarly endeavors. He is an excellent guide to the diverse
and changing trends in the various fields of anthropology as applied
to American Indians. Unfortunately, for the general reader his
approach is heavily academic and his format does not afford room for
many of the haunting and moving Indian tales and ways of seeing the
world that his book refers to.</TE>
<TE>   Some, however, come through, such as: In the late 1960s a
researcher talked, with an interpreter's assistance, to an old Navajo
man about the origins of the Indian people. The researcher showed him
a map of Indians moving into North America across the land bridge
where the Bering Strait is now and asked what he thought.</TE>
<TE>   "He would like to tell you," the interpreter said, "but he would
be punished for it. If he told all his secrets like that, he would
fall apart." Then the interpreter said the old man believed that
"maybe some other guys came over like that, but us Navajos came a
different way"--maybe as cicada-like insects crawling up through the
earth, maybe from white corn kernels, which are actually the mother
of the Navajos.</TE>
<TE>   Nabokov quotes the Navajo writer Luci Tapahonso as saying that
while Navajo singers or chanters are entrusted with the sacred
central narratives of the tribe, others in the tribe tell their own
clan stories or tales of more recent times. "To Navajos," Tapahonso
said, "a person's worth is determined by the stories and songs she or
he knows, because it is by this knowledge that an individual is
directly linked to the history of the entire group."</TE>
<TE>   It is easy to understand how such a concept baffled Prescott and
Parkman, who were marvelous writers and magnificent historians, but
who used the standard of European-American written history as their
historical gold standard. Nabokov's evenhanded survey is a useful
guide to those who want to look further into American Indians'
strange and lovely habits of thought about their past.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>Their blood-red fingernails encased in boxing gloves, the two
working-class gladiatrixes took to the ring on Fox Television to duke
it out for sums rumored to be around $35,000 and a last-ditch attempt
to cling to fame, whatever the cost.</LD>
<LD>   Pathetic! Poignant! Revolting! we pronounced.</LD>
<LD>   Then we tuned in by the millions.</LD>
<TE>   "Celebrity Boxing" averaged 15.5 million viewers--Fox's highest
ratings since "Temptation Island" last year. Although there were two
other matches, most viewers tuned in Wednesday to see Tonya Harding
beat the tar out of Paula Jones. The catfight in boxing gloves even
won its time period against a rerun of the critically acclaimed "The
West Wing."</TE>
<TE>   In the days leading up to the highly publicized event, culture
critics across the country lamented the declining state of
television--and civilization.</TE>
<TE>   They're missing the point, said Neal Gabler, cultural commentator
and author of "Life the Movie: How Entertainment Conquered Reality."
"People like low-grade entertainment, and have for a long time, not
because they are stupid, but because they realize this kind of
behavior is transgressive," Gabler argued. "There is a real thrill to
sticking it to the custodians of culture."</TE>
<TE>   People watch shows such as "Celebrity Boxing" precisely because
they are terrible, and because they are commentary on how we feel
about celebrity. "No one took this seriously," Gabler said Thursday.
"What was going on last night was a giant wink to one another. It was
a giant tweak to high culture. This was about saying, I'm hip. I'm
cool. I get it. It's about irony."</TE>
<TE>   Some scholars of ancient civilizations believe we are led to watch
such spectacles by the same impulses that led crowds to the coliseums
of the Roman empire to watch gladiators fight for their lives. Roman
gladiators were "socially dead," said Margaret Imber, a classics
professor at Bates College in Maine. Often despised in polite
society, the fighters had few or no legal rights, she said. "Harding
and Jones arguably are in a similar situation because they
sought--despite their non-elite origins--to play on an elite stage"
(Olympic figure skating for Harding, American presidential politics
for Jones).</TE>
<TE>   Both Jones, 35, and Harding, 31, have been stereotyped in the
media as low-class.  Harding gained notoriety in January 1994 when
she was involved in a botched plot hatched by her ex-husband to
injure the kneecap of skating rival Nancy Kerrigan.</TE>
<TE>   Jones entered the U.S. political arena in 1994 when she filed a
lawsuit against then-President Clinton, claiming he made an unwelcome
sexual advance in 1991 when he was governor of Arkansas and she was a
state employee. She went on to pose nude for Penthouse.</TE>
<TE>   "Ideologically we try to suppress class distinctions," Imber said.
"The reason these two are lightning rods is because they are from a
lower socioeconomic class, and they came to social attention by
crossing a boundary into an elite arena. That made it very highly
charged." If you survived as a gladiator you essentially got a nice
fat retirement package and lost your servile status, she said, though
beyond the money they earned from Fox, the rewards for Harding and
Jones are unclear.</TE>
<TE>   Other scholars of the ancient world scoffed at such analogies.</TE>
<TE>   "The spectacle thing is true in both [situations]," said Ian
Worthington, a professor of ancient history at the University of
Missouri-Columbia. "But ... this really is just a marketing thing."</TE>
<TE>   No one would have wanted to see Harding and Jones humiliate
themselves, Worthington said, if the women hadn't already been
pathetic public figures, a step away from oblivion. In the evening's
two other matches, 42-year-old Danny Bonaduce of "Partridge Family"
fame pummeled 47-year-old Barry Williams, Greg of "The Brady Bunch,"
and Todd Bridges, 36, of TV's "Diff'rent Strokes" took down Robert
Van Winkle, 32, the rapper once known as Vanilla Ice.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Thompson, a popular-culture critic and director of the
Center for the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University,
agreed that one must be cautious in drawing parallels between
gladiator battles and reality TV.</TE>
<TE>   "While some parallels do exist, we are talking about two
completely different scales of cultural expression," Thompson said.
"The biggest story about Fox's 'Celebrity Boxing' is not so much that
a fat, lazy culture is being expressed as much as that it is a
natural outgrowth of the current state of American journalism. Fox
simply exploited the monsters created by the news cycle. News managed
to create celebrity equity in Tonya, Paula, Danny and Todd, and Fox
has managed to find a way to cash in on that celebrity now that the
news cycle is finished with them."</TE>
<TE>   As for the pundits who don't seem to get the lure of this
spectacle, Imber, who teaches an undergraduate course on gladiators,
explained that the cultural elites then, as now, scorn the
entertainment of the masses. "You read that elite Romans like Seneca
and Cicero hated the games," said Imber. "It's hard to read the
letters of Cicero, they are so snotty. The elites thought people got
too bloodthirsty. But any emperor worth his salt made sure he
attended."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Darnell, Fox's executive vice president of specials and
alternative programming, said the genesis of "Celebrity Boxing" was a
1994 radio stunt. Danny "The Pugilistic Partridge" Bonaduce pasted
poor Donny "The Mormonator" Osmond in a three-round charity bout
orchestrated by a Chicago radio personality. With the emergence of
celebrity versions of other shows, Darnell felt the time had come for
celebrity boxing. "It was really thrilling to me," he said. "What
ended up drawing people to it was the surrealness of it. People you
sort of know, getting into the ring and boxing."</TE>
<TE>   He said he has been surprised by the negative reaction of the
cultural critics. "All we do is put together what we think has great
entertainment value," Darnell said. "I'm amazed at how many people
look at what we do with a philosophical bent."</TE>
<TE>   Imber thinks people should try to be more aware of the connections
between high and low culture. "Something is wrong in our public
discourse that we don't have the ability to connect the crazy
completely tawdry stuff we see with the courageous stuff that we
see," she said. "Until we understand both parts, we will have an
incomplete notion of ourselves."</TE>

<LD>What do your shoes say about you? If you wear sneakers, it might mean
you like to run. If you wear work boots, perhaps you build buildings.
What if you wear ballet shoes? Or ice skates?</LD>
<LD>   Our shoes tell others a lot about our interests, our jobs and even
where we live. One would not wear snow boots in Hawaii or sandals in
Antarctica. Beyond simply being part of everyday clothing, shoes
represent a little bit of our personality and history. Take a look at
your own shoes and think about these things.</LD>
<LD>   Now, imagine yourself walking in someone else's shoes. What kind
would they be? Hiking boots? Dress shoes? Clogs? Ruby slippers? Space
boots? A whole new world opens up when you wear someone else's shoes.
Imagine what it would be like!</LD>
<TE>   Have fun playing make-believe by making your own special pair of
shoes. Just follow the steps below.</TE>
<TE>   Paper Bag Shoes</TE>
<TE>   What you will need: four paper lunch bags (two for each foot);
pencil; scissors; stapler or tape; crayons, colored pencils or
markers; glitter and other craft supplies (optional); newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Step 1: Put two lunch bags inside each other.</TE>
<TE>   Step 2: Put your fingers flat on the open end of one pair of bags.
Draw an oval around your fingers with the pencil and cut it out of
the top layer of bags. Turn the bags over and do the same thing on
the other side. Your bag should look like Figure 2.</TE>
<TE>   Step 3: Pinch the bottom of the bag into a round shape. Use tape
or staples to hold the shape. Your bag should look like the one in
Figure 3. Repeat steps 1-3 with the other pair of bags.</TE>
<TE>   Step 4: Decide what kind of shoes you'd like to walk in. Decorate
the bags to look like these shoes, then stuff the bottoms with a
small amount of newspaper so they will fit on your feet.</TE>
<TE>   Put the shoes on and parade around the room. How does it feel to
walk around in them? Can others tell what kind of shoes you have
created? To have more fun with shoes, visit the "Shoes We Use"
exhibit at Kidspace Children's Museum through May 5. For more
information, call (626) 449-9144.</TE>

<LD>It is a truth universally acknowledged that in contemporary media sex
trumps substance nearly every time.</LD>
<LD>   Case in point: The most disturbing fact to emerge from the scandal
now afflicting the prestigious Harvard Business Review has been all
but lost in a torrent of semi-salacious reportage and comment.</LD>
<LD>   Two weeks ago, the Wall Street Journal reported that the review's
editor, Suzy Wetlaufer, 42, had been forced to kill an interview she
had conducted because she had become romantically involved with her
subject, former General Electric chairman Jack Welch, 66. Two other
editors were assigned to conduct a new interview with Welch, and it
was published last month. Friday, Wetlaufer resigned her editorship
as part of a settlement negotiated by a lawyer selected and advised
by Welch. Wetlaufer will take a six-week leave of absence and then
return as editor-at-large.</LD>
<TE>   The problem is that Harvard Business Review editors quoted in
initial accounts of the affair let drop the fact that Welch, like the
other subjects of the publication's widely read interviews, was
allowed to edit and amend his responses to their questions. In other
words, CEO interviews in Ameri- ca's leading academic business
publication are carefully manicured public relations exercises.</TE>
<TE>   Why does that matter?</TE>
<TE>   The Harvard Business School is one of a handful of institutions
that act as finishing schools for the international managerial elite.
Last April, Wetlaufer proudly told the Harvard Business School
Bulletin that "as the Economist [magazine] says, HBR single-handedly
sets the agenda for business in the world today." Failure to disclose
that its interviews are actually collaborations is, if not deceitful,
sly. The message is that information, like inventory or liability, is
something to be managed and packaged to suit the ambitions of the
executives involved.</TE>
<TE>   That is a dubious notion to propagate at a time when the need for
accurate, candid information on business and industry has never been
more critical. Over the past two decades, the vogue for employee
stock ownership and the flight of more and more corporations from
conventional pension plans have conspired to draft tens of millions
of average Americans into the equity and bond markets. Anyone who
doubts the obligation of corporate executives to provide truthful,
comprehensible information about their businesses should ask people
stuck with shares in Global Crossing or Enron how they feel about the
question.</TE>
<TE>   Salinger Maintains Silence: A number of Web sites, including
Amazon.com, were forced this week to pull items anticipating the
November appearance of a long-awaited book by the famously reclusive
J.D. Salinger, who has not published anything for 40 years. The
novella, "Hapworth 16, 1924" is based on a story that appeared in the
New Yorker in 1965 and recounts another chapter in the life of
Salinger's fictional Glass family.</TE>
<TE>   However, when journalists began phoning Phyllis Westberg,
Salinger's agent, and his small publisher, Virginia-based Orchises
Press, both said no publication was imminent.</TE>
<TE>   In its posting, Amazon seemed to anticipate uncertainty, warning
that "there can be unexpected delays in the publication process,
especially with a title that is generating as much demand as this
one.... Orchises notes that all backorders will be honored and
assures us that the book is really being published."</TE>
<TE>   This is the second time "Hapworth" has flashed on and off the
literary radar screen. In 1997, Westberg and Orchises confirmed
rumors that a book-length version of the story existed and soon would
be published. Anticipating the return of "The Catcher in the Rye's"
celebrated author, a New York Times critic reviewed the 32-year-old
short story. But the critic, Michiko Kakutani, found the piece a
"sour, implausible, and, sad to say, completely charmless story."</TE>
<TE>   When the new book failed to appear, many Salinger fans blamed the
review for their idol's retreat into silence.</TE>
<TE>   What They're Working On: Michael Ignatieff, the Carr professor of
human rights at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, is a frequent
television commentator and documentary film presenter. He is also the
author of "A Just Measure of Pain," a study of the origins of modern
penology; a biography of Isaiah Berlin; and, most recently, "Human
Rights as Politics and Idolatry."</TE>
<TE>   "Since 9/11 I have been thinking a great deal about the ethics of
the war on terrorism," he says. "I was particularly struck by how
quickly some people began to discuss the legitimacy of using torture
to interrogate suspected terrorists and their accomplices. So at the
moment, I'm actually writing a long piece about Algeria, terror and
interrogation. I think there possibly is a scary parallel between
what occurred there and what some people are proposing now.</TE>
<TE>   "The last democratic society to try using torture as a form of
counterterror was France in Algeria in the 1950s. What their record
there seems to show is that counterterror torture appears to work
short-term, but that you win the battle and lose the war. So the
historical record is worth looking at. You really don't want to
become the thing you are fighting, and there is a real danger of that
in a war on terror."</TE>

<LD>PARIS--Swarmed by aggressive cameramen, air-kissing editors and stern
bodyguards for her famous Beatle father, Stella McCartney was flush
with the rush that comes from finishing a hugely important
project--her second Paris show under her own name.</LD>
<LD>   McCartney had suffered slings and arrows for her raunchy spring
debut for the Gucci Group conglomerate. Was she more relaxed this
time around?</LD>
<LD>   "No!" McCartney exclaimed backstage after the well-received show
that included Giorgio Armani as a guest. "Of course not! My God, no!"
She knew that on the fashion industry's clock, no matter how many
hours or years you've logged learning the trade as an assistant or
designer for another label, the act of starting over turns the
credibility timer instantly back to zero.</LD>
<TE>   Though few first collections are stellar, by their second or third
season, many designers are expected to have lost their jitters and
steadied their course. Still, the week's freshman and sophomore
efforts were mixed. "Patience," said Gucci Group Chief Executive
Domenico De Sole before McCartney's show. "Once you have the talent
in house, the results will come." Easy for him to say.</TE>
<TE>   McCartney's fall collection was vastly improved, if only for her
confident emphasis on building a wardrobe, not just a splashy image.
Using many of Armani's stony grays, McCartney's flirtatious belles
let poufy shirtsleeves froth from under boat-neck sweaters, and silky
bombers or nubby cardigans tamed the draft on airy chiffon dresses.</TE>
<TE>   Fellow Brit Alexander McQueen's second namesake collection, also
for the Gucci Group, was gorgeous, romantic and
elegant--couture-quality craftsmanship in clothes that were at once
edgy and refined.</TE>
<TE>   A newly slim and well-dressed McQueen wowed his audience. "The
show was nothing short of spectacular," said Peter Rizzo, president
of Bergdorf Goodman. "He's gone through so many changes in his
life--physical changes, business changes and a change from a company
that was less than supportive to a wonderful relationship with De
Sole. It aided his creativity."</TE>
<TE>   McQueen certainly set an imaginative scene. Six wolves paced in
cages inside the forbidding Conciergerie, an arched medieval fortress
where Marie Antoinette was held before she met the guillotine. As
shrill music and prefab howls played (scaring the wolves), McQueen's
first group showed he's still fashion's favorite bad boy. Leather
harnesses and holsters cinched perfectly tailored skirts, soft
chiffon dresses and sharp jackets like a chic exoskeleton. A prolific
flow of well-executed ideas followed: sweeping leather trench coats,
cape-sleeved shearling jackets, micro bombers, shrunken leather
jackets with a schoolgirl pleated skirt, fur capes and more clothes
sure to inspire some real wolf whistles.</TE>
<TE>   The second outing for Julien MacDonald at Givenchy was a
hard-edged rewind of the '80s with an emphasis on aggressive matching
leather outfits.</TE>
<TE>   Two former assistants adeptly moved their brands forward.
Giambattista Valli improved from a lackluster spring debut at Emanuel
Ungaro. For fall, Valli distilled the house's legendary signatures
into an appealing, less-fussy Ungaro. The ethnic flourishes are still
there in embroidered trims, fringe accents and flowing shapes. And
quirky tiger-print furs made the collection fun.</TE>
<TE>   Phoebe Philo stepped into McCartney's shoes at Chloe last season.
Then and now, she eerily showed how closely the two must have worked.
For fall, she showed a slim, zip-ankle motocross pant, and a penchant
for the same kinds of pretty jackets (hers embroidered velvets), sexy
pants (tight-fitting flares) and revealing tops (super-sheer blouses)
that McCartney often did.</TE>
<TE>   Working in a similar aesthetic, Parisian Laetitia Hecht, who gave
up her own label to relaunch Guy Laroche, has a promising future. She
artfully executed romantic hourglass gowns, tweed Victorian riding
coats and leather corsets or pants with floaty chiffon for a strong
debut that has the right punch for future Grammy nominees.</TE>
<TE>   Alber Elbaz, who once revitalized Guy Laroche, went on to design
Yves Saint Laurent's ready-to-wear, then spent a season at Krizia
Top, resurfaced at the languishing Lanvin. The every-hair-in-place
uptown woman will appreciate his precisely tailored princess coats,
proper wide-leg pant suits and bevy of matching accessories--elbow
gloves, fox stoles and knee-high spats for boots. However, dense
fabrics, and sometimes-awkward details stiffened the collection's
flow.</TE>
<TE>   Other debuts were less promising at old brands Jacques Fath and
Scherrer. Neither the British Lizzy Disney's work at Fath nor Indian
designer Ritu Beri's collection for Scherrer had zing.</TE>
<TE>   The metamorphosis of the Issey Miyake line by Naoki Takizawa was
as unappetizing as watching flies swarm. The clothes, and the
pretentious presentation featuring a sticky runway, were inspired by
insects and the gluey filaments they spin for a chrysalis or web.
Takizawa sometimes artfully wound fabric strips into jeans, coats,
fitted jackets and more, like a couture-trained spider, but the
gimmicks, including pod-shaped accessories, overwhelmed his craft.
Warning to newcomers: Before getting too arty, get the bugs out.</TE>

<LD>PARIS--When 13 European countries converted their currency to the
euro at the beginning of this year, many of fashion's frequent
travelers hoped for a new level of convenience, particularly for
Americans because of the euro's similarity to the U.S. dollar. They
got it, and more--it seems the "e" in euro stands for equalizer.</LD>
<LD>   "It's much easier now," said New York photographer Kenneth
Willardt, who frequently works in Europe for Cosmopolitan, Allure,
Marie Claire or L'Oreal. The single currency has helped make
paychecks more predictable for the international set of fashion
industry workers, such as Willardt, who sometimes saw his pay in
dollars dip or rise as much as 30%, depending on the strength of the
franc, mark or lira.</LD>
<LD>   That equalizing effect, however, means there sometimes is not much
of a difference between the prices of luxury fashion goods purchased
in Europe and in the United States. Some suspect that manufacturers
have actually raised prices on luxury goods.</LD>
<TE>   "It's affected my shopping," said Cosmopolitan fashion and beauty
director Elaine Farley of the strong euro. "The prices feel the same
as in New York. And the shoe prices are the same." Shoppers were
dismayed in Milan, where before the euro, the traditionally weak
lira, a rebate on value-added taxes and a fashion industry discount
often brought designer prices down to levels that Farley equated to
"Banana Republic" prices.</TE>
<TE>   "Now the only reason to shop in Europe is if you get an industry
discount," Farley said, "but even those are getting scarce" for
magazine editors who typically are allowed to use the discounts. Only
a handful of designers extended editors a discount card this year,
compared with more than a dozen that Farley counted just last season.
She and Willardt said they're waiting for sales to hit back home.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as I'm concerned," said New York photographer Maria
Valentino, "it's all just dollars."</TE>
<TE>   Taking It to the Streets</TE>
<TE>   When the audience for Yohji Yamamoto's fashion show left the
elegant Petit Palais grounds, it was greeted by the sight of fire
eaters and fire jugglers who illuminated a row of models in
avant-garde clothing. Americans immediately recognized the tactic as
one spawned on the streets of New York--a guerrilla fashion show.
Aspiring designers seeking attention from fashion's top names
occasionally have presented sidewalk shows that are carefully timed
to begin as a more famous designer's audience departs a show.
Designer Ashley Tyler, naturally a New Yorker, staged the show,
though darkness and the swirling movements of the fire jugglers made
it tricky to see the clothes in detail.</TE>
<TE>   The following day, Belgian Erik Verdonck rode the coattails of
fellow countryman Dries van Noten with a different gimmick. Using a
large umbrella laced with red lights to attract attention, Verdonck's
colleagues handed out a magazine article about him and invitations to
his Sunday presentation, which took place the same night as hot
ticket John Galliano's.</TE>
<TE>   Luxury Lives</TE>
<TE>   Marc Jacobs for Louis Vuitton is one designer who can confidently
sign a long-term lease. While sliding profits at specialty stores and
some designer houses have sent nervous jitters through ateliers,
Louis Vuitton remains one of the strongest brands in the LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton stable, said Yves Carcelle, president of the
luxury conglomerate's fashion group.</TE>
<TE>   "Louis Vuitton is doing very well in the United States," he said
before the LVMH-owned Givenchy show Saturday. Vuitton's sales are up
9%, while the LVMH fashion group is up 13%, he said. "Considering the
decrease in sales from the Sept. 11 effect, that is a very nice
performance."</TE>
<TE>   He conceded that tourism declines have hurt store sales in cities
such as Beverly Hills and Las Vegas, but he expects the new Miami
store and the New York flagship, opening next year at 57th Street and
Fifth Avenue (in the old Warner Bros. store space), to boost U.S.
sales.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the passion for luxury is still very strong," he said.</TE>

<HD>Luxe Looks That Boldly Say, 'Let Them Wear Mink'</HD>
<DH>French fashion houses turn the focus back on opulence and
self-indulgence after a somber beginning to fashion week.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>If anyone can harness the power of beauty to lift the spirits, it's
the French fashion houses. Some of the world's leading designers here
unapologetically delivered a kind of luxuriousness and wild
creativity that wasn't expected from a fall season that began so
downbeat.</LD>
<LD>   As fashion week came to a close, top houses from Chanel to Yves
Saint Laurent embraced a glass-is-half-full approach that made even
all-black or sensible separates seem like indulgences--so expertly
were they turned out. Perhaps designers sensed what economists
reported this week--that wealthy customers kept spending, even amid
talk of the end of luxury and conspicuous dressing. The moneyed, it's
clear, want to look rich, and they will have ample opportunities this
fall.</LD>
<LD>   They'll have lots of luxe versions of--how ironic--peasant wear,
including dense embroideries, chunky furs and thick, hand-knitted
sweaters. Even shoppers in sunny Los Angeles may be tempted by some
of the best outerwear in years: neat princess coats, embellished
cardigans, racy motorcycle leathers and capes.</LD>
<TE>   Tote bags have grown enormous, as have the must-have accessories,
embroidered scarves, stoles and wraps. Heels stayed high, especially
on fall's tall boots, and they're made to show under a won't-die
trend for knickers and other cropped pants. Working women will at
last have abundant tailored jackets to pair with flaring, knee-length
skirts, narrow and wide-leg trousers or even a few miniskirts. In an
all-eveningwear collection, Tom Ford's Yves Saint Laurent gave
after-5 dressing a new look: Call it post-coital Elizabethan.
Ruffles, dangling ribbons, bows, empire waistlines and queenly
quilted velvet maxi coats added the royal elegance; velvet knickers
and satin leggings didn't. Yet curve-hugging tight skirts, plunging
necklines and soaring heels and clothes that seemed in a state of
undress shored up the sex appeal. Ford's parade of little black
cocktail dresses with big decorated cuffs may revitalize cocktail
dressing.</TE>
<TE>   Valentino's fellow yacht and villa dwellers evidently have endured
all the deprivation they can stand. The designer spelled out his
Midas wishes on the runway and in his program. He described the
shining, all-gold knee boots, handbags, belts and fur bags as "an
excuse for pure indulgence."</TE>
<TE>   It's just as hard to ignore the opulent message that Marc Jacobs
sent down a gilded runway at Louis Vuitton. Anyone who can afford
tall mink boots, Persian lamb-trimmed rain boots and silk tops with
attached, exotic feather skirts isn't worried about the value of
their 401(k). There was actress Angie Harmon in the front row wearing
spring's $15,000 embroidered leather coat and matching boots, setting
an example for jet-setters. Though Jacobs tried to downplay the
excess with dour schoolmarm cardigans over the plumed wonders, he was
kidding no one--based on his finale of jeweled, sheared-mink skirts
and dresses.</TE>
<TE>   When sheared-mink boots, fedoras, coats and even pants also showed
up at luxury provider Hermes, it was clear that designer Martin
Margiela, along with Jacobs, had reversed the meaning of shorn pelts.
Removing the fluff from a luscious, fluffy fur used to disguise it
into something mistaken for velvet (and thus avoid protesters'
attacks). Now the shiny, rich furs look every bit their breathtaking
prices.</TE>
<TE>   Though John Galliano's clothes can be as costly as Hermes' or
Vuitton's, their exotic, entertaining flamboyance spreads the
pleasure to spectators. With fellow groovy dresser Lenny Kravitz in
the audience, Galliano made a convincing blend of geisha and American
Indian dresses in his 11-minute show. So many of the ideas were
plucked from his Christian Dior collection shown last week that his
signature collection seemed like a deluxe evening-wear arm of his
Dior work.</TE>
<TE>   Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel also layered it on--with a surplus of
wardrobe ideas. He mixed up the new square, cropped Chanel jacket
with a leather knee-length coat, a fuzzy outerwear vest or a
wave-printed blue chiffon skirt. Witty as ever, Madame Coco's image
was chalked onto blackboard-black totes, and her signature chains
were shrunken into fringe-like hair accessories or trim for jackets.</TE>
<TE>   Younger customers will flock to his many flirty miniskirts, but
old folks in the audience (including Chanel chairman Alain
Wertheimer) plugged their ears when the amplifiers wailed with live
rock from Belgium's Vive la Fete. Lagerfeld, strikingly skinny but
full of himself, took a runway bow to an appropriate soundtrack song:
"Jesus Christ Superstar."</TE>
<TE>   French fashion designers dare to deliver such rich moments as
that--and the clothes to go with them. But surely they were kidding
about the knickers.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Dear Fashion Police: I am 41/2 months' pregnant and officially need
maternity clothes. I cannot raid my husband's closet, as many
pregnancy books advise, because I do not want to wear belted
extra-large polo shirts.</LD>
<LD>   Avoiding sailor-suit maternity outfits does not seem to be the
problem it was in the past, but it is still challenging to find
reasonably priced, not-too-trendy yet stylish pieces for the growing
belly. Both the Gap and Old Navy have some appealing styles on their
Web sites, but do you know of other sources or stores worth checking?
I like the clothes from Liz Lange and Japanese Weekend, but they are
a little out of my price range. I am 33, 5 feet, 6 inches tall,
usually a size 6, and I work in a very casual office.</LD>
<LD>   --EXPECTING TO LOOK GREAT</LD>
<TE>   Dear Expecting: Fashion-wise, you chose a great time to start a
family. Not only are there more choices than ever in maternity
clothes, but the styles are hip, comfortable and not prohibitively
expensive.</TE>
<TE>   That's because several things happened almost simultaneously,
according to Julie Hill, fashion editor of Fit Pregnancy magazine:
Pregnancy is being approached as a "time of celebration."
Technological advances in textiles allow for fashionable, flattering
clothes, and women want to show off their bodies because they're
staying in shape throughout their pregnancies.</TE>
<TE>   So we're seeing more expectant moms in stretchy, form-fitting
tops, pants, dresses and skirts that show off their new curves,
instead of voluminous pieces that hide them. They're not missing a
beat in those nine months when it comes to their wardrobes, staying
in step with current looks.</TE>
<TE>   Even trendy jeans styles can be found in maternity wear, says
Hill, adding that designer Marc Jacobs and the popular label Seven
now offer maternity jeans. In exercise wear, Mothers in Motion,
Adidas, and Nike are making comfortable workout clothes for the
expanding figure.</TE>
<TE>   Celebrity mothers play a part in this revolution as well: "Some of
the women who have been on our cover," says Hill, "like Cindy
Crawford, Toni Braxton and Alex Kingston, have really helped to
further that viewpoint. And the readers are really responding to it."</TE>
<TE>   Fashion stylist Rita Rago, who's responsible for several Fit
Pregnancy covers, says mothers-to-be don't have to dip into baby's
college fund to find workable clothes. She suggested starting with
Internet sites such as EStyle, which carries such lines as Belly
Basics, Babystyle and First Comes Love. We saw some great pieces,
including a long-sleeve Ultimate Everyday Shirt in cotton/spandex
($59), cotton drawstring bootleg pants ($38), a lined polyester
knee-length matte jersey skirt ($42), a short cotton/lycra dress with
three-quarter sleeves ($55) and the Essential Mom-to-Be T-shirt in
cotton ($24). Go to www.estyle.com or call (877) 378-9537.</TE>
<TE>   Another site, MaternityMall .com, features clothes from several
companies, including A Pea in the Pod, Mimi Maternity and Motherhood
Maternity.</TE>
<TE>   Though some of the clothes can be pricey, we found a V-neck
pantsuit in a poly/cotton blend from IMaternity ($29.98), and a slim
leg stretch pant in cotton/spandex ($54) and a ribbed cotton cardigan
($44), both from Mimi Maternity. You can find them online at
www.maternitymall.com.</TE>
<TE>   Rago also said that in the early months of your pregnancy, you
don't have to confine yourself to maternity wear. Look for "anything
that stretches" she advised, meaning you should choose knits and
stretch micro-fiber over woven material, which won't give.</TE>
<TE>   "Certain pieces you do have to invest in," she advised, especially
as your middle expands and regular drawstring and elastic waist pants
may no longer work. "Look for a great pair of basic black pants and a
skirt. You may have to pay a little more, but they'll take you
through the pregnancy."</TE>
<TE>   You might find that some of the stretchy pieces will work for
those few post-baby months, too, since some fabrics have enough
flexibility to pop back into shape.</TE>

<LD>Hawaiians in Honolulu look forward to St. Patrick's Day. They wear
green in order not to get pinched.</LD>
<LD>   Tulsa, Okla., answered that they do pinch, while Grants Pass,
Ore., wasn't sure what different families did. Hartford, Ark.,
practiced the custom of pinching, and so did Springfield, Mo.</LD>
<LD>   Boise, Idaho, reported an unusual custom: "If you wear red you get
kissed, if you wear blue you get kicked, if you wear yellow you get
pinched, and if you wear green, nothing happens to you on St.
Patrick's Day."</LD>
<TE>   Both Salt Lake City, Utah, and Jamestown, N.D., answered that they
pinch for not wearing green.</TE>
<TE>   After a two-month wait, Sean received a letter from Galway,
Ireland. Classmates held their breath until they heard that they do
not pinch there on St. Patrick's Day.</TE>
<TE>   A few days later, several letters arrived from Dublin, Ireland.
They too confirmed there was no pinching. One letter informed the
class that if you don't wear green, you were looked down upon by your
elders. Older men and women wore shamrocks on this special day.</TE>
<TE>   Four boys, Pat, Eamon, Liam and Troy, asked Sean to find pen pals
for them. Troy wrote how he enjoyed all the parades on St. Patrick's
Day. Now everyone in the class wanted to write to the boys in
Ireland.</TE>
<TE>   With the school year drawing to a close, the class summarized the
letters and put together a booklet on the project. They kept it in
the library for future students to read.</TE>
<TE>   "Our book might be read by our own children someday," said
Natasha.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe they'll continue or add to it," suggested Tom.</TE>
<TE>   "Or get ideas for other booklets," grinned Sean.</TE>
<TE>   The last line of the booklet read: "After comparing letters
nationwide and overseas, the class still holds to the custom of
pinching if you do not wear green on St. Patrick's Day!"</TE>
<TE>   Betty Martens is a retired teacher. She still has the booklet her
students compiled after doing a similar survey. This story will be on
The Times' Web site at www.latimes.comkids. A new five-part story
begins Monday.</TE>

<HD>A Clever Round of Good Cop-Bad Reality TV Cop</HD>
<DH>With the help of a strong production team, Robert De Niro
and Eddie Murphy turn 'Showtime' into a fun sendup.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy decided to team up for the cop
action-comedy "Showtime," they hooked up with exactly the right
people to give a fresh and funny satirical twist to an old formula.
They are director Tom Dey and writers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar,
who also plunked Jackie Chan, Owen Wilson and Lucy Liu down in the
Old West in "Shanghai Noon" and came up with a barrel of laughs.
Working from a story by co-producer Jorge Saralegui and with a new
writer, Keith Sharon, the "Shanghai Noon" team has done just as well
by De Niro, Murphy and Rene Russo.</LD>
<LD>   From frame one "Showtime" displays an ingenuity, cleverness and
briskness that never flags. We meet De Niro's Mitch Preston, a
detective who's a 28-year veteran of the LAPD, when he's giving a
no-nonsense classroom lecture--only to discover he's not at the
Police Academy, but in a grammar school in which an increasingly
alarmed teacher at last breaks in to ask tremulously if there aren't
any "fun days" on the police force he could relate to the kiddies.</LD>
<LD>   By the same token, we meet Murphy's Trey Sellars when he's pulling
out all stops in acting--tough only for the camera to pull away and
reveal that he's auditioning for a TV cop show. We're in for sleight
of hand from the start.</LD>
<TE>   Mitch is a crusty professional who prides himself on having
mastered painstaking police procedures and looks askance at the
leaping from roof to roof and incredible chases that go on in movies
and TV shows about cops. While the irrepressible Trey really would
like to make detective on his third try, he also sees himself as only
one role away from acting stardom--never mind that his previous
experience has consisted only of one-line bits.</TE>
<TE>   The trick, of course, is to bring these two wildly different guys
together, and the filmmakers take a contagious, sneaky pleasure in
the way they pull it off.</TE>
<TE>   In essence, eager-beaver Trey inadvertently barges in on Mitch in
the midst of setting up a drug sting, and the enraged veteran winds
up shooting out a TV camera, putting him in the doghouse at
headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   The footage falls into the hands of ambitious network producer
Chase Renzi (Rene Russo), who knows the makings of a live reality cop
show when she sees them. She sells the LAPD brass on the benefits of
such a show; Mitch's captain (Frankie R. Faison) orders Mitch not
only to participate, but to team up with Trey, who has wasted no time
in making sure he impresses Chase with his ability to improve upon
reality.</TE>
<TE>   Now the fun begins in earnest. De Niro's cautious Mitch and
Murphy's headstrong Trey play off each other hilariously. The
filmmakers send up all the excesses and manipulativeness of "reality"
shows, which of course allows them to stage one of the most
spectacular chases and pile-ups imaginable and a big climactic scene
in a Bonaventure Hotel penthouse worthy of a Schwarzenegger action
spectacle.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, Russo and her dedicated assistant (Drena De Niro)
are continually embellishing the images of the recalcitrant Mitch and
the gleeful Trey, deciding that Mitch should drive a Humvee and Trey
a silver Corvette, and that Mitch's apartment, a drab
late-'60s-early-'70s time capsule, should get a thoroughly modern
makeover. Chase doesn't stop there: no dull, overcrowded squad room
will do for her cops, so she carves out of the crowded space a sleek
private office for the duo. The filmmakers understand the importance
of emphasizing characterization over plot when they have stars who
can do so much with the people they're playing.</TE>
<TE>   The fallout from Trey's intrusion into Mitch's undercover
operation provides just enough of a thread to string together the
barrage of repartee between the stars to provide a neat beginning,
middle and end.</TE>
<TE>   Even the villain (Pedro Damian), a suave drug lord and night club
proprietor who has just invested in a cache of new armor-piercing
hand-held machine guns, is not without a sense of humor. William
Shatner and attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. amusingly play
themselves, with Shatner coaching Mitch and Trey on how to play TV
cops. Kadeem Hardison has a wonderful scene as a hapless minor crook
gulled by Trey.</TE>
<TE>   "Showtime" is a fine-looking film with a bouncy score and a clutch
of lively songs for deft punctuation. The production design by Jeff
Mann and his team is especially smart and telling, down to the last
gritty detail of Mitch's apartment. "Showtime" leaves us with the
feeling that we haven't seen the last of Mitch and Trey.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for action violence, language and some drug
content. Times guidelines: Action violence, language standard for the
genre; drugs referred to only as contraband.</TE>

<HD>O'Reilly Tries Reverse Migration</HD>
<DH>The Fox News star is jumping into radio with a show that
competes with Rush Limbaugh's.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a migration that has occurred since the earliest days of
television--Jack Benny, Arthur Godfrey, Edward R. Murrow, Larry King,
Howard Stern--radio stars taking their talents to the newer medium.
But Fox News Channel's pugnacious Bill O'Reilly is headed in the
opposite direction, announcing this week that he's expanding his
"no-spin zone" from cable TV to the world of talk radio. Starting May
8, he'll broadcast for two hours weekday mornings on KABC-AM (790),
in direct competition with conservative talk icon Rush Limbaugh.</LD>
<LD>   "He could be doing a lot of other things than spending two hours
on the radio," in addition to the several more hours of preparation
required for the job, said Michael Harrison, publisher of Talkers
magazine, a trade journal of talk radio. He called O'Reilly's move "a
shot in the arm" for the industry. "Radio has long been a
second-class citizen to television. Radio personalities have long
dreamed of going to TV," Harrison said.</LD>
<LD>   But it's not like O'Reilly is slumming.</LD>
<TE>   "The O'Reilly Factor," his program on Fox News Channel, draws
about 1.5 million viewers nightly--an impressive audience for cable
television. On the other hand, Rush Limbaugh's radio program draws
about 20 million listeners per week. "If Bill O'Reilly gets rolled
out on 150 to 200 radio stations, he's going to have far more
listeners [than his TV show reaches]. It's a hell of a promotion for
Fox Television," said Walter Sabo, a New York-based consultant and a
former vice president at NBC and ABC radio.</TE>
<TE>   It's a phenomenon that may happen more often, according to
Christopher H. Sterling, director of the graduate telecommunication
program at George Washington University, in Washington, D.C., and
editor of the Encyclopedia of Radio. With fewer companies owning more
and more radio stations, the focus is increasingly on the bottom
line, he said. Programmers and distributors recognize that it's
faster and cheaper to hire someone already famous elsewhere, than to
try to nurture another Rush Limbaugh, who started as a disc jockey at
age 16, and spent five years as a local talk host before going
national.</TE>
<TE>   Even though they'll be airing at the same time in Los Angeles, and
seem to have the same conservative-leaning audience, Harrison doesn't
believe O'Reilly presents "a threat to Limbaugh. There are plenty of
listeners for both. What O'Reilly presents a threat to are local and
other syndicated hosts."</TE>
<TE>   At KABC, he's displacing Gloria Allred and Mark Taylor, for
instance, while at New York's WOR, his show is going to push aside
talk-radio veteran Bob Grant.</TE>
<TE>   But for Westwood One, which is syndicating O'Reilly's show, the
decision was pragmatic. "You don't get to launch a radio show with a
guy who is the hottest property on cable TV," said Joel Hollander,
president and chief executive of Westwood One. "Something weird has
got to happen for this not to be a success.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obviously great for Bill," Hollander added. "He's going to
sell a lot more books. The cross-promotion for Fox is tremendous.
[Fox News President] Roger Ailes is very happy about that."</TE>
<TE>   That the O'Reilly-radio match made sense is in part due to a
changing radio industry that is becoming less local and more
national. "What's the fastest way to build a national reputation in
media? It's television," Sterling said.</TE>
<TE>   O'Reilly, who portrays himself as a Joe Sixpack who made good, and
who revels in skewering the Clintons or Jesse Jackson, is the second
Fox News Channel host to launch a national radio show. Sean Hannity,
of "Hannity &amp; Colmes," went into syndication six months ago with a
talk show that originated at WABC in New York, and is heard locally
on KABC from noon to 3 p.m.. But Hannity has always worked in radio.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   O'Reilly dabbled in the medium, including filling in for Paul
Harvey when the host was out sick last year. But he drew his fame
from television, working as a correspondent for CBS and ABC news. He
was host of the syndicated tabloid-TV show "Inside Edition" for six
years before his Fox News Channel program debuted in 1996. He has
since translated that celebrity into book sales, with "The O'Reilly
Factor: The Good, the Bad &amp; the Completely Ridiculous in American
Life" selling a million copies and spending 14 weeks atop the New
York Times' bestseller list. Mel Gibson wants to turn his first
fiction book, "Those Who Trespass: A Novel of Murder and Television,"
into a movie. Still Sterling sees a relatively easy transition for
O'Reilly given that talk TV--especially the rehashing of political
and social issues that O'Reilly does nightly on Fox--isn't that
different from talk radio. "There's nothing to look at," Sterling
said of talk TV. "It's talking heads."</TE>
<TE>   But by cashing in on personalities already famous elsewhere, talk
radio may be eating its young. "There are very few stations out there
who can take a chance on young talent," said Hannity in an interview
shortly after his radio show went national.</TE>
<TE>   Describing his 14-year ascension from a Santa Barbara college
station to a program syndicated across the country, he wondered how
the next generation will work its way up.</TE>
<TE>   "Because there's so much good syndicated product that's out
there," the market is harder for aspiring radio hosts to break into,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Consultant Sabo disagreed, noting that in 1982, the U.S. had 59
talk-radio stations. That jumped to 200 by 1988--the year Rush
Limbaugh went national--and 600 in 1995. Now it's about 1,000. "The
reason for that is syndication," Sabo said. Small stations can't
afford to hire enough hosts to fill 24 hours, but they can afford one
or two, and fill the rest of the time with national programs. Still,
"that's 1,000 more hosts than there were 10 years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Erik Braverman, program director at KABC, said the
station plans to keep Allred and Taylor. "It's our goal to add talent
to our roster, not subtract it," he said, noting that O'Reilly fits
the station's plan to "add the biggest and brightest talk talent
available. He has tremendous superstar potential."</TE>

<HD>A Question of Identity for the Man Behind 'The Believer'</HD>
<DH>Television* The controversial film, airing on Showtime,
delved into issues of self-love and hate familiar to Henry Bean.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN CLARK</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Writer-director Henry Bean briefly looks around him and then, in the
middle of a coffee shop not far from Times Square, executes a Nazi
salute. No, he is not mimicking a scene from the colossal Broadway
hit "The Producers" just down the street, but one from his movie "The
Believer," about a Jew (Danny Balint, played by Ryan Gosling) who
becomes a neo-Nazi skinhead. It turns out that part of the salute,
which Bean delivers with his little finger extended, is Jewish inside
information. Worshippers use their little finger to point to the
Torah when it is lifted up in a synagogue. The only viewers who got
this were the film's most ardent admirers: Israelis.</LD>
<LD>   "The best audiences possible, the greatest audience the film will
ever have," says Bean, who screened "The Believer," which airs on
Showtime Sunday night, in Jerusalem. "What they really understood was
Jewish anti-Semitism. It was easy for them to understand, partly
because the country thinks about that sort of thing, and partly
because the hatred between the secular and the religious there is
very intense. A lot of people there said, 'This is a more intractable
issue than the problem with the Arabs.' Hard to believe."</LD>
<TE>   For some who've seen "The Believer," which premiered at the
Sundance Film Festival last year and won the Grand Jury Prize, it
might be hard to believe that it was embraced by a group it
ostensibly attacks. But Israelis understood, as some others did not,
that hate is the flip side of love.</TE>
<TE>   Danny's perverse devotion to Judaic minutiae is impressively,
almost thrillingly, encyclopedic. Only a believer would be so
fanatically well-informed.</TE>
<TE>   Bean, until now a screenwriter (notably "Internal Affairs"), based
the film on the true story of an anti-Semite who killed himself after
it was revealed in the press that he was Jewish. Bean considers
himself uniquely qualified to have translated it to the big screen
because of his own identity problems as a Jew raised assimilated in
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   "For the longest time, it was like this identity that I belonged
to and it had no content except for lox and bagels and this sense of
I was Jewish because I was Jewish because I was Jewish," he says. "I
could easier picture myself a woman than picture myself a Gentile. I
thought, I don't want to feel this way. I don't want to feel locked
into this group. I'm a person.</TE>
<TE>   "Once I saw what the religion was, I didn't feel so locked inside
of it. It was as if 'Oh, it really is something, therefore I can be
this and be other things as well.'" So, while Bean was a prisoner of
something he didn't understand, Danny is a prisoner of something he
understands only too well. Rather than coming to terms with it, Danny
spews venom, beats up a Jewish kid, vandalizes a synagogue and
threatens to assassinate a Jewish banker.</TE>
<TE>   Needless to say, these images are not for everyone. The Simon
Wiesenthal Center, which is frequently brought in by filmmakers to
vet controversial material, dealt "The Believer" a blow by
pronouncing itself against the film. The studios circling around it
shied away, in part because of the center's opposition, more likely
because they didn't think it would make any money. However, Bean says
that Paramount Classics Co-President Ruth Vitale told him privately
that it could, if marketed aggressively. The timidity, he says,
apparently came from the top, from Paramount Pictures.</TE>
<TE>   Bean says didn't he help his own cause by showing it to the
Wiesenthal Center first, rather than, say, the Anti-Defamation
League, which later gave the film its seal of approval.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we were stupid for going to the Wiesenthal Center without
really knowing who they were," he says. "I knew [who] Simon
Wiesenthal [was], but I didn't know that [Wiesenthal head] Marvin
Hier had been at the Republican convention the previous summer. I
didn't understand how politically conservative they were." Because
the studios passed, the film will now be aired on Showtime, which, is
in the same corporate family (Viacom) as Paramount Classics.</TE>
<TE>   The cable showing will be followed by a theatrical release May 17
by an outfit called Fireworks Pictures, which helped finance the film
originally and already had foreign distribution rights. Bean has
mixed feelings about this. He's disappointed that a TV premiere won't
have quite the same profile as a theatrical release would, but he's
happy that many more people will get a chance to see it.</TE>
<TE>   Showtime President Jerry Offsay, who is Jewish, says that he was
well aware of the Wiesenthal Center's objections to the movie, but
that these were more than offset by the positive critical response,
as well as reactions from his staff. He also has a different business
model from the studios. He doesn't have to sell tickets. He merely
has to attract attention. There is, however, the wrong kind of
attention. The movie, which, as Offsay puts it, is "provocative on
the best of days," was arguably too incendiary in the wake of the
World Trade Center disaster. In fact, a subsequent public screening
at the Toronto International Film Festival was canceled.</TE>
<TE>   Offsay suddenly found himself wrestling with the idea of
postponing the airdate.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a question of trying to be respectful to the loss that
people have suffered and not inflict some additional hurt on them in
the short term," Offsay said not long after the Sept. 11 attacks.
"Are we doing a disservice to the film by delaying, or are we doing a
disservice to the film by putting it on at a time when people are
much less likely to watch it?"</TE>
<TE>   After deliberating during the Jewish holidays, Offsay decided to
postpone, releasing a statement that read, in part, "In order to be
sensitive to the current mood of our country, we feel that it would
be appropriate to delay the broadcast to a time when our audience
might be more receptive to this kind of strong drama."</TE>
<TE>   If all of these obstacles sound like more than any movie should
have to negotiate, there's yet another one. More than the objections
of the Jewish community, more than the skittishness of the studios,
more than the unanticipated complications of real-world tragedy, Bean
was afraid that the movie would not be accessible to non-Jews.
Judging by audience reactions at Sundance and other festivals, it
more than passed that test. Now he has one more audience in mind.</TE>
<TE>   "My dream is that we show this film to the Aryan Nation," he says.
"I want to see what they think. Because I felt like if you watched it
not just intellectually but even emotionally, you'd end up with this
weird feeling, like 'How can I hate them when they hate themselves so
much better or more intensely, more intelligently, and in detail than
I do?' And yet their hatred is all mixed in with love."</TE>

<TE>   "The Believer" airs Sunday at 8 p.m. on Showtime. The network has
rated it R (may be unsuitable for children younger than 17).</TE>

<HD>Rock en Espanol Double Bill Plays by the Rules</HD>
<DH>Proving that CDs aren't everything, Zurdok is uninspiring,
especially next to powerful Jumbo in sets at the Key Club.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wednesday's double bill at the Key Club featuring Jumbo and Zurdok,
two top rock en espanol bands from Monterrey, Mexico, proved the No.
1 rule of pop music appreciation: Never judge a band by albums alone.
On record, Zurdok sounds superior, with sophisticated orchestrations
and electronic effects that achieve uncanny echoes of the Beatles.
Its rich and ambitious third album, "Maquillaje," was a critical
favorite last year.</LD>
<LD>   But on stage Wednesday, Zurdok was a letdown. Stripped of its
cellos, horns and studio tricks, the four-piece band sounded
one-dimensional and mechanical. Chetes, its shy, mop-topped lead
singer and keyboardist, seemed withdrawn and uninvolved, perhaps
reflecting rumors of the band's impending disintegration. The only
spark during Zurdok's droning, one-hour set came when Jumbo's
charismatic vocalist, Clemente Castillo, joined Chetes briefly on an
acoustic number. Fans in the packed club cheered at the very sight of
the lanky, leather-jacketed leader of Joom-boh, as they pronounce it.</LD>
<TE>   During his band's opening song, Castillo jumped around so
spastically that his dark glasses flew off his head. It was a sign
that the joint was about to start rocking for real. Although its
studio work seems tame, Jumbo stirred up a midnight frenzy in the
mosh pit during a surprisingly powerful set. At one point, Castillo
stopped security guards from expelling an exuberant girl in hot pants
and ponytails who had leaped up on stage, dancing like a delighted
jumping jack.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what it's all about," he said in Spanish, arm around his
rescued fan. "To be alive, to wake up and listen to rock 'n' roll!"
Joined by members of Zurdok for an encore, Jumbo closed with a
disjointed and unworthy version of "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club
Band."</TE>
<TE>   Pop music rule No. 2: Quit while you're ahead.</TE>

<LD>Janis Siegel arrived at the Jazz Bakery this week less than a month
after the release of her new album, "I Wish You Love." For most
performers, that would trigger the presentation of a program
determinedly dedicated to supporting the CD.</LD>
<LD>   Yet, oddly, Siegel's opening set Wednesday night barely managed to
acknowledge the new release via the inclusion of the album's opening
track, "Just a Little Lovin'."</LD>
<LD>   As a founding member of the Manhattan Transfer, Siegel prides
herself--with considerable justification--on her musical eclecticism.
And there's no faulting the range of material she explored, from
Gershwin to Dusty Springfield to Bob Dorough, from vocalese to
scatting to pure balladry. But one can't help but wonder why she
chose to do so few of the tunes from what is clearly one of her
better recordings as a solo artist.</LD>
<TE>   Siegel started the set with some slippery pitch
problems--surprising in a singer who habitually works in close vocal
harmony situations (and the result, perhaps, of incorrect monitor
speaker placement).</TE>
<TE>   By the time she was into her third piece, however, she had clicked
into gear in a fashion that made it possible to finally concentrate
on the velvety sound she brought to her slower tunes and the briskly
swinging phrasing of her rhythm numbers.</TE>
<TE>   But there were other uneven aspects to the performance. The Eric
Reed Trio, present to accompany Siegel, was actually at its best in
the segments in which the players performed separately as an
instrumental group--especially during a romp through Thelonious
Monk's "Monk's Dream." Pianist Reed, bassist Vincente Archer and
drummer Rodney Green worked smoothly together, with the interplay
between Reed's robust chording and Green's busy rhythms driving the
trio forward.</TE>
<TE>   Attractive as these qualities may have been for the trio's
instrumental work, however, they were far less effectual as
accompaniment for Siegel's singing. During the bossa nova rhythm of
one of the tunes, for example, Green inexplicably added a clave
rhythm on his shaker, thoroughly undermining what should have been a
gently floating rhythmic flow. On other tunes, Reed's two-handed
chording combined with Green's too liberal use of drumsticks (rather
than brushes) to virtually inundate Siegel's vocal line.</TE>
<TE>   A pair of numbers displayed what might have been: a lovely,
unaccompanied vocal introduction to "How Long Has This Been Going
On?" and a marvelously spirited rendering of Sammy Cahn's "Rhythm in
Nursery Rhymes," accompanied only by Reed's lightning-fast stride
piano. The evening could have used many more similar moments.</TE>

<HD>No Backing Down</HD>
<DH>Tom Petty has never given in to trends. It's clearly paid
off, as he gets set to join the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tom Petty's music has always reflected the purity and faith of a
musician who had the courage and conviction to simply listen to his
heart.</LD>
<LD>   Rather than tailor his style to better fit critical or commercial
trends, the singer-songwriter and his band the Heartbreakers have
remained true, in themes and presentation, to the basic rock 'n' roll
tradition that they learned from the records of such classic figures
as Elvis Presley, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Byrds and Bob
Dylan.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday in New York City, Petty and the Heartbreakers will join
those and other early heroes as members of the Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame. Jakob Dylan will induct them in a ceremony whose taped
highlights will be broadcast at 9 p.m. Wednesday by VH1. Other
inductees this year include Isaac Hayes, Brenda Lee, Gene Pitney, the
Ramones and Talking Heads.</LD>
<TE>   "I feel like a lucky man," Petty, 51, said this week at his home
in Malibu, where he lives with his second wife, Dana, and her
9-year-old son from her first marriage. "A lot of people really
struggle to find out what they want to do in life, but I knew as soon
as I saw Elvis Presley, when I was 11. From that point, music became
my religion, my nourishment.</TE>
<TE>   "It was also a safe haven for me. My life was very turbulent as a
child and a little scary, and music made everything seem right. It
has also pulled me through some other dark times. It's very touching
to be voted into the Hall of Fame because it's an award given by your
peers, and it's a nice feeling to think you're going to be
remembered."</TE>
<TE>   Joining the Florida native on stage will be the original
Heartbreakers lineup of Mike Campbell on guitar, Benmont Tench on
keyboards, Stan Lynch on drums and Ron Blair on bass. Howie Epstein,
who replaced Blair in the early '80s, will also participate.</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to see why so many of Petty's songs, including "Refugee"
and "I Won't Back Down," are anthems about struggling to pursue your
dreams. He came into rock in the mid-'70s, a time when the pop
airwaves were devoted to disco or bland pop-rock, and he subsequently
went through some highly publicized battles with record companies to
maintain his personal and creative independence.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike most Hall of Fame inductees over the years, Petty is still
a Top 10 album sales contender and a top arena draw. His next
collection is due by the fall and he will continue to tour
periodically with the Heartbreakers.</TE>
<TE>   Petty, who also has two grown daughters from his first marriage,
finds it hard to come up with a list of his own favorite
compositions, but he agreed to comment on 10 of my Petty favorites.
The songs are listed chronologically.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "American Girl"</TE>
<TE>   Served up with guitar-driven textures so wonderfully Byrds-ian
that Byrds leader Roger McGuinn quickly recorded the song, this 1976
number introduced Petty's key theme of struggle in pursuit of dreams.
Key line: "Well, she was an American girl, raised on promises. She
couldn't help thinking that there was a little more to life,
somewhere else...."</TE>
<TE>   Petty: "I wrote that in a little apartment I had in Encino. It was
right next to the freeway and the cars sometimes sounded like waves
from the ocean, which is why there's the line about the waves
crashing on the beach. The words just came tumbling out very
quickly--and it was the start of writing about people who are longing
for something else in life, something better than they have.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people think the girl in the song commits suicide, but
it's not about suicide. It has also been interpreted as a statement
about the country. I was watching the 9/11 concert in New York and
the Goo Goo Dolls played 'American Girl.' I could see the crowd
cheering in this really patriotic context. But it was just a story
when I wrote it. In my mind, the girl was looking for the strength to
move on--and she found it. It's one of my favorites, and we'll
probably play it Monday."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Listen To Her Heart"</TE>
<TE>   From the exuberance of the music to the details of the lyrics,
this 1978 tune felt like a companion piece to "American Girl." Here
was someone else at a crossroads, but this time the ending was more
obviously positive. Key line: "You think you're going to take her
away with your money and your cocaine ... but she's going to listen
to her heart, it's going to tell her what to do."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Petty: "This was a love song. I wrote it after my wife at the time
told me about going to a party at [a famous musician's] house and
there being all this cocaine around, and I think that kicked off the
opening line of the song. There was a lot of resistance from radio to
the word 'cocaine.' The record company wanted me to change it to
'champagne,' but that was a whole different image and I wouldn't do
it. It started with this guitar riff I had. I was looking for
something with the sound of the Searchers' record 'Needles and Pins.'
I still love to play the song live."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Refugee"</TE>
<TE>   This 1979 hit single largely defined Petty's musical stance--the
fighter who wouldn't give up, regardless of odds. It was an old rock
'n' roll theme, but Petty infused it with new energy and conviction.
Key line: "Everybody's got the right to be free ... you don't have to
live like a refugee."</TE>
<TE>   Petty: "This was a reaction to the pressures of the music
business. I wound up in a huge row with the record company when ABC
Records tried to sell our contract to MCA Records without us knowing
about it, despite a clause in our contract that said they didn't have
the right to do that. I was so angry with the whole system that I
think that had a lot to do with the tone of the 'Damn the Torpedoes'
album. I was in this defiant mood. I wasn't so conscious of it then,
but I can look back and see what was happening. I find that's true a
lot. It takes some time usually before you fully understand what's
going on in a song--or maybe what led up to it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The Waiting"</TE>
<TE>   This 1981 song was another tale of struggle, but a more optimistic
one.</TE>
<TE>   Petty: "That was a song that took a long time to write. Roger
McGuinn swears he told me the line--about the waiting being the
hardest part--but I think I got the idea from something Janis Joplin
said on television. I had the chorus very quickly, but I had a very
difficult time piecing together the rest of the song. It's about
waiting for your dreams and not knowing if they will come true. I've
always felt it was an optimistic song."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Straight Into Darkness"</TE>
<TE>   This 1982 song spoke about the tensions of trying to keep your
spirits up when everything around you is in turmoil. Key line: "I
don't believe the good times are over, I don't believe the thrill is
all gone."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Petty: "I like that song a lot. I don't know why it was never put
out as a single. Maybe it was just a little too dark. There were a
lot of tensions going on around me and I was trying to combat the
pessimism. I wanted to say that love is the great redeemer. We played
it quite a bit live, and it always went over well."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Southern Accents"</TE>
<TE>   "Southern Accents" may be Petty's most thoughtful and ambitious
album. The 1985 collection is a sometimes affectionate, sometimes
disheartened look at his Southern roots, and the way young people
there have to battle stereotypes and peer pressure in trying to
choose their paths. Key line: "There's a Southern accent where I come
from--the young-'uns call it country, the Yankees call it dumb."</TE>
<TE>   Petty: "That may be my favorite among my songs--just in terms of a
piece of pure writing. I remember writing it very vividly. It was in
the middle of the night and I was playing it on the piano at home in
Encino. I was just singing into my cassette recorder and suddenly
these words came out. I was at the point in my career where I was
very much trying to find some new ground. I thought I had used up
what I had started with and I wanted a new direction.</TE>
<TE>   "We had lived in California for about 10 years at that point and I
started thinking about growing up in northern Florida, which is a lot
different from Miami Beach. It's close to Georgia and I came from a
real Southern family, and I wanted to address that world. Once I came
up with this song, I decided to write an entire album about the
theme."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The Best Of Everything"</TE>
<TE>   Also from "Southern Accents," this is one of Petty's most
compelling narratives--a more mature look at the kind of story he was
telling in "American Girl."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Petty: "I wrote that before 'Southern Accents,' but Nick Lowe gave
me the idea of putting it on the album. He said it sounded like a
Southern story to him. I love Robbie Robertson's horn arrangement on
the song. It's about a girl I was fond of when I was a teenager, and
me just wondering about whatever happened to her."</TE>
<TE>   "You Don't Know How It Feels"</TE>
<TE>   This 1994 song was a memorable look at isolation and despair.</TE>
<TE>   Petty: "One of the things that happened with the 'Southern
Accents' album is that I started writing about specific characters,
rather than just from my own experience, and this was a song in that
style. This guy had no place to go, and he's just trying to find a
place to fit in."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Angel Dream"</TE>
<TE>   This is from the music Petty wrote for the soundtrack to the 1996
film "She's the One," and it's one of his most tender tunes. Key
line: "I saw an angel, I saw my fate. I can only thank God it was not
too late."</TE>
<TE>   Petty: "That's one of my all-time favorites. It's about my wife,
Dana, and it's the truth, line for line. That has always been our
song."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Room At The Top"</TE>
<TE>   This song, from the 1999 "Echo" album, is strikingly atypical of
Petty's music. Rather than the clarity that is his trademark as a
writer, this number finds its strength in its mystery. There's such a
rowdy, disoriented feel to the arrangement that you have to struggle
to even make out the words, but it feels like an absolutely accurate
snapshot of disillusionment and pain.</TE>
<TE>   Petty: "That 'Echo' album was one of the dark times. I can't even
play it. It scares me because I was so down when I made it. It was
the toughest period of my life. The character in that song is really
desperate. It was the time of my divorce and the aftermath, when I
was having to rebuild a lot of relationships, including those with my
daughters. There was a lot of misunderstanding. I probably spent a
year withdrawn from everyone, just staying home. It was a lonely,
weird time, and I guess a lot of that is captured in the song.</TE>
<TE>   "But time really is a healer and my life is wonderful now. You'll
be able to tell in the songs I've been writing. I feel like I'm back
in control again--that my world is whole again."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A grotesque mind.</LD>
<LD>   There's nothing wrong with fairy tales that dole out happily ever
afters. Even as ABC toughs out a plodding two hours of "Snow White:
The Fairest of Them All," however, two vastly better weekend movies
taste the culture of hate, mayhem and moral ambiguity in which we
often live.</LD>
<LD>   "The Matthew Shepard Story" on NBC and "The Believer" on
Showtime--the latter a must-see for those who value challenging
stories that get under the skin--project universes vastly different
than those of the Brothers Grimm.</LD>
<TE>   Shepard was the diminutive University of Wyoming student who was
slain in 1998 solely because he was gay. That case--including the
trials of the two locals who lashed the 21-year-old Matthew to a
fence and savagely beat him with a gun after luring him from a bar
late one evening--is recalled here mainly via the agony of his
parents.</TE>
<TE>   Written by John Wierick and Jacob Krueger and directed by Roger
Spottiswoode, "The Matthew Shepard Story" is as conventional as TV
gets, toggling in emotional swells predictably on cue. Yet it's also
credibly done on most fronts, with good work by Stockard Channing and
Sam Waterston as Judy and Dennis Shepard as well as Shane Meier as
Matthew.</TE>
<TE>   His horrendous murder in quiet, conservative Laramie seized the
media's attention, making him a poster victim for homophobia and hate
crimes, an ugly cross-current that was X-rayed much more
successfully, with layered complexity, in Moises Kaufman's adaptation
of his play, "The Laramie Project," which ran recently on HBO.</TE>
<TE>   Did Matthew's convicted young killers, Aaron McKinney and Russell
Henderson, believe in anything beyond their own ignorance and
intolerance? While languishing in prison, are they able to reconcile
what they did to their victim, leaving him on that rural fence like a
crucified Christ figure? When looking at themselves in a mirror on
the wall, do they see the fairest of them all?</TE>
<TE>   Or like Danny Balint, age 22, does each see someone he loathes?</TE>
<TE>   Superbly played by Ryan Gosling, Balint is the neo-Nazi skinhead
at the center of "The Believer," a highly provocative Henry Bean film
that is irresistible despite its flaws and prickly discomfort. It's a
piercing laser. And Gosling, in the role of his young life, is an
electrifying force, his faintly condescending sneer a declaration of
war, his seething anger exploding to the surface.</TE>
<TE>   We meet this bench-pressing young hard-body as he harasses an
Orthodox Jewish student in a New York subway before stalking and
beating his passive prey almost as ferociously as McKinney and
Henderson did Matthew Shepard.</TE>
<TE>   Soon he's making contact with a fascist group whose sophisticated
leaders (Theresa Russell and Billy Zane) sense his potential and hope
to reinvent him as a mainstream fund-raiser for their movement.</TE>
<TE>   In baggy pants, Balint could pass for a skateboarder. In a
swastika T-shirt, though, he struts the streets with menace. He
labels Judaism "a sickness," believes "the modern world is a Jewish
disease" and calls for "Germany all over again." Yet defying the
stereotype, he is unlike the zero-IQ toadies in his small circle of
misfits who parrot what they've been told and deny or downplay the
existence of the Jewish Holocaust.</TE>
<TE>   "If Hitler didn't kill 6 million Jews," he argues, "then why is he
a hero?"</TE>
<TE>   Balint's is not the face of rage and hate we're accustomed to
seeing on TV or movie screens. He is acutely intelligent. He is
articulate. He is charismatic, making him all the more dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   And, secretly, he is Jewish.</TE>
<TE>   Too over the top? Hardly, for "The Believer" is loosely based on
the true story of Daniel Burros, an American Nazi who committed
suicide in 1965, after the New York Times revealed that he was
Jewish, just as Balint encounters his own Times reporter Sunday
night.</TE>
<TE>   Also a Jew, yet allegedly linked to white supremacists, moreover,
is Marjorie Knoller, who is on trial in Los Angeles in the
dog-mauling death of Diane Whipple. Asked in court this week about
allegations that she was tied to an Aryan Brotherhood prison gang,
she replied, "I'm Jewish," then added that her relatives were Jewish
Holocaust survivors.</TE>
<TE>   As if that would necessarily decide it.</TE>
<TE>   It's somehow appropriate that pay cable--getting bolder and
brighter as network movies get blander--should embrace a story that
big-screen moviedom timidly rejected. Writer-director Bean, an
observant Jew who is married to a rabbi's daughter, intended "The
Believer" for theatrical release. Despite earning the Grand Jury
Prize at last year's Sundance Film Festival, though, it landed on
Showtime because there were no takers for theatrical distribution
(although it is set to appear in some theaters after its TV run).</TE>
<TE>   Did Bean's volatile material frighten off major studios? Did the
prospect of backing a film with low box-office prospects? Did fear of
offending a special-interest group?</TE>
<TE>   Although "The Believer" earned hearty praise from the Jewish
Anti-Defamation League, it earlier got a crunching thumbs down from
the influential Simon Wiesenthal Center, which is often asked to vet
sensitive movie scripts with Jewish themes. The center's associate
dean, Rabbi Abraham Cooper, found one scene in particular--where
skinheads invade a synagogue and rip a Torah scroll into shreds--a
"primer for anti-Semitism."</TE>
<TE>   Yet the intensity of the synagogue's desecration could not be
imparted without the scene that incensed Cooper. And in fact, it
plays as a rebuke of anti-Semites, while being pivotal in the
evolution of Balint's conflicted thinking that begins when he is a
boy studying the Torah in a Jewish religious school known as a
yeshiva.</TE>
<TE>   Threading "The Believer" are flashbacks of him arguing with his
yeshiva teacher and fellow students about a portion of the Torah in
which God tests Abraham's faith by asking him to sacrifice his son,
Isaac, on Mt. Moriah. Instead of agreeing that Abraham is obedient,
Danny sees him as a coward whose willingness to comply generated a
weakness and victimhood that became the Jewish identity.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Bean's images are striking in how they illustrate Balint's
inner turmoil: The skinhead wearing a talis and davening on Rosh
Hashana. The skinhead punctuating Hebrew chants with Sieg Heil
salutes.</TE>
<TE>   Where "The Believer" flops badly at times is at the script level.
The gap separating Danny the yeshiva rebel from Danny the Jew-baiting
Nazi is too vast to be entirely credible. Unclear is what happened in
the interim to shape Balint as a violent, twisted fanatic full of
self-hatred. Just as muddled is the logic of a spiritual U-turn by
his kinky girlfriend (Summer Phoenix) and his own behavior with other
skinheads when facing a crossroads that defines him as a person. Will
he be victimizer or victim? Or both?</TE>
<TE>   You're naturally hoping for redemption along the lines of
"American History X," the 1998 film about a neo-Nazi (also named
Danny) who reformed in prison and then set out to sever his younger
brother from the movement. Yes or no, "The Believer" is a troubling,
powerful story that merits an audience.</TE>
<TE>   "The Believer" premieres Sunday night at 8 on Showtime. The film
has been rated R (may be unsuitable for children under 17), with
advisories for nudity, coarse language and violence.</TE>
<TE>   "The Matthew Shepard Story" will be shown Saturday night at 9 on
NBC. The network has rated it TV-14 (may be unsuitable for children
under 14).</TE>
<TE>   Howard Rosenberg's column appears Mondays and Fridays. He can be

<HD>Working With Sloths Can Be Time-Consuming</HD>
<DH>'Ice Age' took a long trip to the screen, during which the
film evolved from an adventure-drama to a comedy.</DH>

<LD>Where can a screenwriter get the chance to work with an antisocial
woolly mammoth, a nerdy sloth, a tough saber-toothed cat and a gaggle
of survivalist dodo birds? Only in the realm of animation--and only
if the screenwriters are willing to immerse themselves in a wildly
collaborative, maddeningly nonlinear creative process that is unlike
any other kind of screenwriting job.</LD>
<LD>   For writers Michael J. Wilson, Michael Berg and Peter Ackerman,
20th Century Fox's new computer-animated comedy "Ice Age" represented
their first experience working in the medium of animation. And for
each of them, the film would prove to be a challenge.</LD>
<LD>   "It was like being a staff writer on a job," said Ackerman, an
off-Broadway playwright who worked on the project on and off for more
than a year. "It was a little bit like television in that there was a
lot of collaboration and things changed constantly."</LD>
<TE>   The tale of three wildly disparate prehistoric creatures--Manfred
the mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano), Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo)
and Diego (Denis Leary), a tiger that harbors a sinister secret--who
team up to return a human baby to its father, "Ice Age" is the first
feature to come from Fox Animation's digital partner, Blue Sky
Studios.</TE>
<TE>   While this is perhaps the best time in history for a studio to be
poised and ready to release a major computer-animated feature, given
the commercial successes of "Shrek," "Monsters, Inc." and "Jimmy
Neutron: Boy Genius," using computer-generated imagery was not part
of the original plan.</TE>
<TE>   "At the beginning it wasn't a CG film, it was just an animated
film," said producer Lori Forte, who pitched the
"'Three-Godfathers'-on-a-Glacier" concept to Fox in 1997. "Chris
Meledandri [president of Fox Animation Studios] and Kevin Bannerman,
who was our production and development executive at the time, came to
me and said, 'What would you think about doing 'Ice Age' as a CG
movie?'"</TE>
<TE>   Initially surprised, because the project was one of several being
considered for Fox's traditional animation studio headed by Don Bluth
(which has long since closed), Forte quickly realized it was
"basically a no-brainer."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Wilson, who previously had come no closer to animation
than working on 1994's live-action version of "The Flintstones," was
the first writer brought in on the project, when "Ice Age" was still
in the treatment stage.</TE>
<TE>   "In research, I found out that the major source of revenue for
Neanderthals was the woolly mammoth," Wilson said. "But there was a
big emotional moment that I don't think we were expecting to find,
when [the human] realizes that the thing he's making his living from
[by killing] saved, took care of and brought back his son. That
evolved when we were doing the treatments."</TE>
<TE>   Based on the treatments and outlines he devised with Forte, Wilson
wrote the first draft script in 1998. But that was only the beginning
of a long process.</TE>
<TE>   "The script gives us a starting off point," said Chris Wedge, the
director of "Ice Age" and co-founder of the White Plains, N.J.-based
Blue Sky. "It helps discover and define the characters and the tone
of the dialogue. But there's a lot of invention between the script
and the screen."</TE>
<TE>   In the old days, cartoons, even animated features, never relied on
a script at all. They were created through storyboard drawings, which
contained the action and even the dialogue of the film. Story teams,
separate from the screenwriters, remain an integral part of the
animation process, although scripts are now more common in starting
animation, not only for their value as a blueprint, but also as
budgetary guides. "If the studio is making an investment, they want
to know what they're buying in advance," Forte explains.</TE>
<TE>   Fox, whose commercial track record with animation has run the
gamut from the respectable (1997's "Anastasia") to the disappointing
(2000's "Titan A.E.") to the disastrous (2001's live action-animation
combo "Monkeybone") invested about $58 million in "Ice Age." That's
about twice the cost of "Jimmy Neutron" and roughly half the going
rate for a Disney Feature Animation project.</TE>
<TE>   While the earliest versions of the "Ice Age" script had been
conceived more as an action adventure-drama with comic relief, Fox
began to seek a more comedic treatment of the story with a
contemporary edge. Even before Wedge came onto the project at the end
of 1998, Michael Berg, whose credits included 1996's "New Jersey
Turnpikes," was brought in to further develop the comedy.</TE>
<TE>   "When I came in I said, 'I can't write for kids,'" said Berg, "and
they said, 'Great! Just write a good story.'"</TE>
<TE>   Berg stayed with the project on and off for three years, which
covered most of the production period. He said the experience was, in
part, a lesson in patience.</TE>
<TE>   "You have the storyboard artists draw [the scripted scenes] and
you get a version you like, and you put it on story reels with the
pictures and the temporary voice track, and then the directors and
artists have a lot of ideas they want to explore," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We had 30 options of some scenes and, as a writer, you try to
pull them back toward story and characters. In live action, the actor
or director might say, 'Can we take [the scene] this way?' But they
usually don't say that 30 times."</TE>
<TE>   Needless to say, all of this constant flux of story, action and
dialogue, and the back-and-forth process of going from script page to
storyboard to story reel tended to blur the concept of authorship.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an interesting sort of tension of who is the story
writer in an animated movie," said Ackerman. "Who really knows how to
make an animated movie, the writers or the storyboard artists?"</TE>
<TE>   Ackerman joined the project in 2000, an experience he likens to
jumping onto a moving train. "I thought I was going to be the only
writer there," he said, "but when I showed up, Michael Berg, whom I
did not know at the time, was there, and I thought, 'Oh, my God, I'm
supposed to rewrite lines that this guy already wrote? Isn't that
going to get a little uncomfortable?'"</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, it turned out to be more comfortable than anyone
anticipated, and for a while, Berg and Ackerman operated as a writing
team. "I was not threatened when they brought in [Ackerman]," Berg
said. "I was happy, because somebody comes in with a good idea and
you can get a little fresher."</TE>
<TE>   In the course of what Ackerman calls "interminable tinkering" by
the production team, the writers occasionally found themselves
reworking material that had previously been accepted and approved.</TE>
<TE>   "You might go back and rewrite a scene you had written three
months ago and think, 'I thought you guys said this was funny three
months ago!'" he said.</TE>
<TE>   However, both he and Berg say they are grateful for the chance to
be involved in so many different steps of the filmmaking process,
from being at the recording sessions with the actors to sitting with
the director in the editing room--opportunities that rarely come to
writers on live-action films.</TE>
<TE>   Even after Berg and Ackerman had left the project, though, the
script remained in flux. Writers Jon Vitti and Mike Reiss, both
veterans of Fox television's "The Simpsons," were brought in to
further punch up the lines, while the work of the story team--which
was headed by Yvette Kaplan--continued, even through the animation
phase. "We were working on story until the last week of animation,"
said Wedge.</TE>
<TE>   The gag-driven sequences involving Scrat, an aggressively cartoony
prehistoric rodent that is the karmic victim of the ice age, were
largely the province of Wedge, lead layout artist William Frake III,
and the story team.</TE>
<TE>   While a four-year development and production schedule might sound
downright glacial, Meledandri said the film actually progressed on a
timely basis. "The evolution of the script [for "Ice Age"] happened
much more organically than in prior films," said Meledandri.</TE>
<TE>   "There was always a sense of us pushing and forcing the
development of the other films for various reasons, not the least of
which were production deadlines that imposed on the creative process.
With 'Ice Age,' none of those [contractual restraints] existed."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever traumas the writers may have experienced during the
development and production of "Ice Age" have largely faded. Wilson,
who has yet to see the finished film--he prefers to see movies in
theaters with regular audiences--is philosophical about the process.
"Sometimes art is the elimination of the unnecessary, and how do you
know what's necessary or unnecessary until you go through the
process?"</TE>
<TE>   Berg, who is happy that some of his favorite lines survived and
remained unchanged from his first draft to the finished film, admits
to having experienced a good deal of angst over the constant rewrites
and changes during production. Eventually those feelings subsided as
soon as final decisions were made because, "I just appreciate what
works," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to pinpoint the credit for certain ideas ultimately became
moot, according to Ackerman, since the nonstop collaboration made it
sometimes difficult to remember who contributed what. "I felt like
whatever I came up with was public property," he said.</TE>

<HD>It's All About Getting Out on the Road</HD>
<DH>Guitarist Pat Metheny, who's on tour through year's end,
believes that artists must travel to sustain a career in music.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was a period in guitarist Pat Metheny's career when he
literally spent his life on the road, traveling from gig to gig.</LD>
<LD>   "For 15 years," he says with a laugh. "I did have an apartment,
but it was just a shelter for my answering machine. Basically, from
'77 to '92 I was permanently in transit. I'd just occasionally go to
this warehouse and swap the spring suitcase for the winter suitcase.
For part of that time--from 1977 until 1981--we were mostly getting
around in a van, and when we finally retired the van, it had 890,000
miles on it."</LD>
<LD>   Although Metheny, 47, is now considerably more settled--he has two
young children, ages 1 and 3, and lives in Manhattan--he still spends
a good portion of his time on the road. On March 23, he'll make a
stop at the Universal Amphitheatre with the latest version of the Pat
Metheny Group, supporting the just-released CD "Speaking of Now." The
appearance comes just after the start of a tour that will
continue--in the United States, Europe and Asia--until the end of the
year.</LD>
<TE>   "It's different now," he says, "in the sense that the real
challenge is figuring out how to spend time at home. But I'm still
convinced that traveling is the only real way to sustain a career in
this business.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically what we've done has been to go out and do billions of
gigs. That's the only way to do it because radio is absolutely
nonexistent--especially for us. We're in a very weird spot in the
sense that KLON is not going to play us, we're way too outside for
the Wave [KTWV-FM], and in either case, all of our tunes are 10
minutes long--not because we try to write them that way but because
that's just how they come out."</TE>
<TE>   The Universal Amphitheatre performance will showcase a new version
of the Metheny group. Lyle Mays, a musical partner for two decades,
will be on keyboards and Steve Rodby, another associate, on bass. But
the current group (and the recording) also features trumpeter Cuong
Vu, singer-bassist-percussionist Richard Bona and drummer Antonio
Sanchez.</TE>
<TE>   The lineup brings a great deal of new, creative imagination to the
group--in Metheny's words, "a new potential." After Sanchez--who has
been prominently heard with Danilo Perez and David Sanchez--joined
the group, Metheny briefly considered doing both the recording and
the tour as a quartet. But the thought of adding other players,
especially those with similarly distinctive personalities, became too
appealing to resist.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to reach outside of the communities of guys that I
knew," recalls Metheny, "so I called Richard up and asked if he knew
anybody. There was this kind of pause, and then he said, 'I've got
the perfect person--me!' I said, 'But I've got Steve, who's been
playing bass with me for yeas, and he's terrific.' And Richard said,
'Yeah, but I don't like playing the bass. My first instrument's
percussion.'</TE>
<TE>   "So I said, 'Look, if you want the gig, you don't have to twist my
arm. But we're going on the road for a year, doing 180 gigs or so.'
And Richard just said that, yeah, it was something he wanted to do,
which was great with me. The fact is that he's an incredible
percussion player, the vocal quality that he adds is just amazing,
and we'll do a few things in which we have two basses." "</TE>
<TE>   Trying out new ideas comes easily to Metheny, whose resume reaches
from Ornette Coleman, Herbie Hancock and Jim Hall to Steve Reich,
Milton Nascimento and David Bowie. And one could make a convincing
case for the vital importance of his work--along with that of John
Scofield, Bill Frisell and John Abercrombie, among others--in
dramatically widening the horizons for his instrument by blending
elements of traditional jazz guitar with developments (stylistically
and instrumentally) of the post-rock era.</TE>
<TE>   Metheny also has never been reluctant to speak out forcefully
about the artistic and the commercial aspects of the jazz world. A
year or so ago, after hearing a recording in which Kenny G overdubbed
his saxophone onto Louis Armstrong's "What a Wonderful World,"
Metheny excoriated G via an Internet posting for "spewing his ...
jive, pseudo bluesy, out-of-tune, noodling, wimped-out ... playing
all over one of the great Louis' tracks."</TE>
<TE>   Looking at the current jazz scene, he similarly--if in
considerably less potent language--bemoans the fact that so many
players have failed to make connections with the young listeners who
are needed to sustain and expand the audience for the music.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate to say this, " says Metheny, "but some of the younger jazz
guys got a taste of going to Europe, doing jazz festivals, having
their little suites and flying around on jets and getting good fees
from Day 1 of their careers. And you can't get those guys to go play
at a coffeehouse in Ames, Iowa, for 1,500 bucks; they just won't do
it.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth is that, since 1980, there are few young kids who feel
an affiliation with people their own age playing jazz, because the
players in that generation didn't make the connection. Nothing
against any of the music they've done, but that movement tended to
play for people much older than them. They didn't go and play for
their peers."</TE>
<TE>   All of which further underscores Metheny's belief in the jazz
version of politicians' pressing the flesh, so to speak--of getting
out and getting in touch with their audiences. And, particularly in
the case of younger artists, getting in touch with their own
generation.</TE>
<TE>   "I really feel that the next generation of jazz guys--whoever they
are--needs to take it to their own peers," he says. "Go out there
with a trio and do those 300 gigs a year or so to build an audience.
Because there always are college-age kids who want something that's
more than the obvious, and jazz has been traditionally the perfect
place to find music that's beyond the obvious, for nearly a century.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the approach that worked for us in the beginning," concludes
Metheny, "and it's the approach that still works for us: Just get out
there and do a lot of gigs."</TE>
<TE>   The Pat Metheny group performs at the Universal Amphitheatre, 100
Universal City Plaza, Universal City, on March 23, 8:15 p.m. (818)
622-4440.</TE>

<TE>   New Face at Cerritos: The appointment of Craig Springer as the
executive director of the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts
should be good news for jazz fans, as well as for the capacity
audiences who have been pleased by the venue's broadly eclectic
programming. Springer has been the guiding light behind USC's L.A.
Jazz festival, including this year's event, April 15-20, which
features Sonny Rollins, Wayne Shorter and Christian McBride.</TE>
<TE>   His plans for Cerritos include the addition of a smaller
performing space to expand the venue's booking potential.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect it to hold about 350," says Springer, "sometimes set up
in cabaret style, sometimes like a traditional salon. We're looking
at starting a series of maybe 10 to 12 events in that space featuring
newer artists--folks who perhaps wouldn't be capable of selling out
the big hall, but whom we should be exposing to our audiences."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the possible choices under consideration for the smaller
venue: tenor saxophonist Seamus Blake Quartet and pianist Judy
Carmichael.</TE>
<TE>   Although he stresses that the "city council is primarily concerned
with building upon the success that the center has already had, and
adamant about having a broad and well balanced set of programs,"
Springer also notes that "the folks who interviewed with me were
pretty fascinated by the work we'd done at USC when I was there in
terms of the L.A. Jazz programs."</TE>
<TE>   So, despite his insistence upon making sure that Cerritos "will
not be transformed into a venue specifically for classical music or
for jazz or for dance," he is already punching up the center's jazz
programming with some potentially exciting bookings.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking at things like Kenny Barron's 'Brazilia Project,'"
Springer says. "Possibly an evening with McCoy Tyner's Trio and Ahmad
Jamal's Trio. I like the Roy Haynes 'Birds of a Feather' project. I'm
hoping for a Kirk Whalum date in the fall, and I'd love to do
something with Dave Holland's Quintet."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Late-Breaking News: Harry Connick Jr. will be playing some
large-venue dates around the Southland in April. But jazz fans will
have a single chance to hear him in a more focused setting. On April
8, he will perform two sets at the Jazz Bakery with his quartet.
Tickets will undoubtedly go fast. The Bakery phone number is (310)
271-9039.</TE>

<HD>Extinction Humor Skates on Thin 'Ice'</HD>
<DH>Director Chris Wedge livens up a fossilized plot line with
bright computer animation in his tale of interspecies cooperation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You could call "Ice Age" "'Shrek' With Frostbite" or "'Monsters,
Inc.' on Ice," and you wouldn't be far off. That's how closely this
new computer-animated film duplicates and combines the plots of its
predecessors.</LD>
<LD>   No, this tale of interspecies cooperation 20,000 years ago isn't a
case of plagiarism, merely an indication of how completely familiar
and regrettably formulaic this film's conception, plot and dialogue
are. It's regrettable because director Chris Wedge has done nifty,
amusing things on the visual side, joining bright new technology to a
story as old as, well, the Ice Age.</LD>
<LD>   Wedge, who won an Oscar for the animated short "Bunny," does his
best work when none of his characters is talking. His style is a kind
of storybook photo-realism, giving those characters the unusual look
of living and breathing plush toys.</LD>
<TE>   One of the highlights of the film, for instance, is an elaborate
visual jest that is more of a running gag than part of the actual
plot. It involves a hyperactive little beast referred to as Scrat
(for "prehistoric squirrel/rat") who is dedicated body and soul to
capturing a large acorn and burying it in the frozen ground.</TE>
<TE>   The lengths Scrat (with expressive grunts supplied by Wedge
himself) goes to and the chaos his determination triggers bring to
mind the manic brio of the brilliant animator Chuck Jones and his
catastrophe-causing gang of Road Runner, Wile E. Coyote and the rest.
The talking parts of "Ice Age," however, are not nearly as much fun.</TE>
<TE>   It's not just that the film's overall philosophy of joining a
simple-minded tale for tots with glib dialogue to amuse their parents
has gotten stale with overuse, it's that the particular story on view
has, by complete coincidence, been seen so recently.</TE>
<TE>   Like "Shrek," "Ice Age" follows an odd couple of unlikely friends,
taking us along as a wisecracking sloth (voiced by John Leguizamo),
rather than a wisecracking donkey, attaches himself to a sullen,
reluctant mammoth (Ray Romano) who'd rather be left alone, instead of
a sullen, reluctant monster who feels the same.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of monsters, just as "Monsters, Inc.'s" story line
focused on its main characters' determination to get a cute toddler
back home, so the animals in "Ice Age" have to return a wayward
toddler to a human family. There are probably more than two stories
in the universe of animation, but you wouldn't guess it from this
film.</TE>
<TE>   Although this familiarity is disconcerting, it's not what's wrong
with "Ice Age." Neither is the film's sentimentalism, nor its
determination to include what it considers amusing modern touches,
such as references to global warming and a shot of a Stonehenge-type
building linked to the line "Modern architecture ... it'll never
last."</TE>
<TE>   The problem rather is the wholesale embracing of what has become
de rigueur in animation, the practice of treating major characters as
if they were stand-up comics working a room in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   As written by Michael Berg and Michael J. Wilson from a story by
Wilson, this relentless, all-wise-guys-all-the-time approach tries
way too hard and gets tiring in no time at all.</TE>
<TE>   That's especially true of Sid the Sloth, an animal so out-and-out
irritating he's been intentionally left behind by his family as it
migrated south.</TE>
<TE>   Sid links up with Manfred the Mammoth, a moody loner who, for no
apparent reason, is headed north. Though chatterbox Sid keeps
insisting, "You and me make a great team," Manny keeps responding
with "Isn't there someone else you can annoy?"</TE>
<TE>   "Ice Age's" other plot strain involves a group of saber-toothed
tigers so furious at humans they plan on stealing and snacking on a
human infant. A tiger named Diego (Denis Leary) is deputized to do
the deed, and he's nonplussed to find that by a series of
coincidences, that infant is now in the care of Manfred and Sid, "a
bit of an odd couple."</TE>
<TE>   Like everyone else on screen, Diego finds Sid hard to take,
letting him know "you're a little low on the food chain to be
mouthing off." Still, all three beasts end up traveling together on a
reluctant rescue mission to return the infant to its "human herd."</TE>
<TE>   Although "Ice Age's" forced glib dialogue often makes you wish you
could turn down the sound, the film's sense of physical adventure,
its gift for creating wild rides like a journey down a slippery ice
funnel, is considerably more entertaining.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from Scrat's antics, "Ice Age's" most inspired episode
involves an ineptly militaristic group of dodos (unlikely in these
temperatures, but never mind), masters of a kind of Tae Kwan Dodo
martial arts and doltishly determined to "Protect the Dodo Way of
Life." Given how amusing it can sometimes be, it's too bad that "Ice
Age" has adopted Sid's overbearing personality rather than the
dodo's. That beast may be extinct, but it apparently knew a thing or
two about making people laugh.</TE>

<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Harrison's Flowers" is a picture that's well-meaning but
problematic, a love story set against the outbreak of war in the
former Yugoslavia in October 1991. Through the frame of the love
story, director Elie Chouraqui and his writers convincingly show us
the terrible forces of ethnic cleansing. The depiction of the
senseless slaughter of civilian Croats by Serbian troops is as
unsparing in its intensity as any war movie that comes to mind.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, the narrative is not nearly as persuasive and thus
the incessant battle scenes become punishing to watch. After all, the
widespread atrocities accompanying the disintegration of Yugoslavia
are by now not fresh news for all the immediacy of Chouraqui's
hellish images.</LD>
<LD>   Andie MacDowell is Sarah Lloyd, wife of Pulitzer Prize-winning
Newsweek photographer Harrison Lloyd (David Strathairn), celebrated
for his daring coverage of the world's hot spots. Harrison, however,
has had it with his career, which has only sharpened his love for his
wife and two small children, from whom he is often separated. He gets
solace from the beautiful flowers he grows in his greenhouse in the
backyard of his north Jersey suburban home.</LD>
<TE>   Harrison is so fed up he tells his boss (Alun Armstrong) that he
wants to quit, but his boss, for whom Sarah also works as a photo
editor, begs him to stay on awhile longer and promises to find him a
safe, cushy spot.</TE>
<TE>   The next day war in the Balkans breaks out. Harrison is swiftly on
his way, and no sooner does he arrive than Sarah learns that he's
been killed in the collapse of a building in a town a couple of
hours' drive from Vukovar.</TE>
<TE>   But Sarah feels strongly in her heart that Harrison is still
alive. She takes off in search of him and easily enters the war zone.</TE>
<TE>   She's instantly thrown in the path of relentless Serbian
slaughter, captured by photographers Kyle Morris (Adrien Brody) and
Marc Stevenson (Brendan Gleeson). Hotheaded Kyle recognizes Sarah,
and, feeling guilty for an altercation he had with Harrison, promises
her he'll get her to Vukovar, where Sarah is convinced she will find
Harrison in the main hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Marc sees this as crazy, but Kyle points out that they could all
be killed any second, so why not do something that has meaning? At
the least the journey might bring some closure for Sarah.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Harrison's best friend and fellow Pulitzer
winner, photographer Yeager Pollack (Elias Koteas), turns up to
rescue Sarah.</TE>
<TE>   Chouraqui, a veteran French filmmaker, piles on the hairbreadth
escapes as he attempts to pay homage to the fearlessness of
front-line photographers. Yet he mostly avoids delving into what
drives them to risk their lives; an exception is an exchange between
Kyle and Marc, who believe that if not for their pictures, the world
would never know what's going on.</TE>
<TE>   Marc is a seasoned pro, but we need to know more of what fires the
impassioned Kyle beyond his discovering that Sarah's mission might
give his life some significance.</TE>
<TE>   It's a little late in the day for filmmakers to be taking us into
a war zone seen almost entirely through the viewpoint of Americans.</TE>
<TE>   We may get the full visceral impact of a ruthless army on the
warpath but no sense of the devilish complexity of the Balkans
conflict. And the tremendous emphasis on Sarah's relentless
determination has the uncomfortable effect of giving greater
importance to her suffering than to that of the natives, many of them
women and children, torn from their homes and caught in a barbaric
civil war.</TE>
<TE>   A lot of solid acting--particularly a stellar performance by
MacDowell--and craftsmanship have gone into the making of "Harrison's
Flowers," which was filmed largely in the Czech Republic, but it
leaves us with a heightened appreciation of the bold and personal
films made by a number of filmmakers of the former Yugoslavia.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for strong war violence, gruesome images,
pervasive language and brief drug use. Times guidelines: The film's
depiction of war is far too intense for children.</TE>

<HD>In Newport Beach, a Museum in Transition</HD>
<DH>Art* While the Orange County Museum of Art awaits a new
chief, a team has redefined the facility's mission.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Deputy director of art and chief curator Elizabeth Neilson Armstrong
knew when she started last April at the Orange County Museum of Art
that it was in a transitional stage with a recently redefined mission
and an ongoing search for a new location.</LD>
<LD>   She just didn't realize she would be temporarily in charge of
monitoring all the changes. But the death of the museum's founding
director, Naomi Vine, in December meant that Armstrong had to step in
as acting director.</LD>
<LD>   "We are stretching Liz a bit right now," said Charles Martin,
chairman emeritus of the museum's board, adding that a search for a
permanent director will begin in the next few months.</LD>
<TE>   The director's role probably will change, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Top candidates may not be required to have a strong background in
both art history and management, as Vine had, which would set a
precedent for the museum. The Los Angeles County Museum of Art had a
similar restructuring of its director's post in 1999, when Andrea L.
Rich, an administrator with no formal art training, was hired. Martin
contends that an art background may no longer be necessary in the
lead administrative post with Armstrong and a solid curatorial team
in place.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong stepped in as chief curator after the position had been
vacant for 18 months. Since last April, she and her curators have
worked to reinvigorate the museum's artistic programming.</TE>
<TE>   The curators are keeping a mix of contemporary works and
historical California art throughout the museum.</TE>
<TE>   New programs will complement three annual major temporary
exhibitions, which are still being planned. One of the temporary
exhibitions will be focused on historical California art drawn from
the permanent collection.</TE>
<TE>   Among the new programs, curator of contemporary art Irene E.
Hofmann will launch an installation series, and collections curator
Sarah Vure will present a program that highlights works by American
artists.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong has reassembled the permanent collection. She waited a
few months before leaving her first imprint on the collection. "I
wanted an opportunity to know the collection," she said. "Since it
hadn't been reinstalled in several years, I felt it needed a fresh
look."</TE>
<TE>   The reinstallation, completed last year, juxtaposes historical
works with contemporary art. Instead of grouping them in
chronological order, they are presented by theme: "California Color
and Light," "American Realism, Assemblage and Pop," "Modernism,
Minimalism and the Postmodern" and "Performance and the Body."</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong has also decided to change the "Overview" gallery, an
elongated rectangular room at the entrance of the permanent
collection that used to offer displays of works by California
Impressionists. Now it has a variety of artistic styles.</TE>
<TE>   By spring, Armstrong hopes to have an indoor cafe-style study area
set in the Overview gallery. Furnished with a coffee table and comfy
couch, the small nook will allow visitors to sip java, watch a video
by an artist or delve into books or the Internet to learn more about
the artist's process and source materials.</TE>
<TE>   Works from the permanent collection will be rotated in every two
months for visitors to interact with or examine more closely. "It's a
different way to access art so that it's more engaging," Armstrong
said.</TE>
<TE>   The first major temporary exhibition under Armstrong's tenure,
organized with Hofmann, will go up in June. The museum's Biennial
will showcase a dozen California artists with diverse ethnic
backgrounds, among them Stephanie Syjuco and Roman de Salvo, who were
invited to create site-specific installations. Syjuco looks at the
issues of security and video surveillance technology, and De Salvo
will customize large-scale balloons to look like boulders floating
above the museum, drawing attention to the site. The contemporary
works--painting, photography, sculpture, installation, video and
Web-based videos--will touch on issues of immigration, environment
and identity.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the first public indication of some of our interests as
curators," said Hofmann, who started in October and is especially
interested in works on video and artists with global perspectives.</TE>
<TE>   A traveling exhibition by Hofmann, a video installation by
Spanish-born artist Inigo Manglano-Ovalle prepared for the Cranbrook
Art Museum in Michigan, will stop at the Newport Beach museum next
year.</TE>
<TE>   This year Hofmann will also inaugurate an installation series that
invites emerging and international contemporary artists to create
site-specific works. Each installation will have an interactive
multimedia component and will be exhibited for up to four
months--three a year--in what is now the screening room gallery.</TE>
<TE>   "I want it to be an experimental gallery for artists who have made
strong works in the past but are not necessarily established in
California or in this country," Hofmann said. "For many it'll be
their first museum show. So there won't be much name recognition with
these installations, but there's always something new and exciting to
see each time you visit."</TE>
<TE>   Vure, who joined the museum in May 1998, specializes in early 20th
century American and European art, works most closely with the
museum's permanent collection. Known for her scholarly, in-depth
approach to exhibitions such as 2000's "Circles of Influence:
Impressionism to Modernism in Southern California Art, 1910-1930,"
which Times art critic Christopher Knight called "a sumptuous feast,"
Vure wants to place California artists in the larger context of
American art.</TE>
<TE>   For her new series on American artists and for major exhibitions,
she will gather works from the museum's collection of early and
mid-20th century pieces, including plein-air landscapes, Modernist
paintings and photography. California's large contingent of immigrant
artists from around the world is another subject ripe for
exploration, Vure said.</TE>
<TE>   "Artists of different ethnic backgrounds who were working in
California may not have been as well known as their Anglo
counterparts," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Vure said she will augment the museum's collection with works on
loan from other public and private collections locally and
nationally.</TE>
<TE>   With a team of three in-house curators in place, board members say
the museum is prepared for its next growth phase. "It will be four to
five years before OCMA will be in a new location," Martin said. "You
don't just wait until you get there."</TE>

<HD>As Letterman Trails Leno, Will More Promos Help?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Letterman's new contract with CBS requires the network to throw
extra promotional weight behind his late-night program, bowing to
Letterman's hope that will help narrow the gap between his show and
ratings leader "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno."</LD>
<LD>   Yet after a tumultuous 10 days in which Letterman's possible
defection to ABC commanded national headlines, late-night ratings
this week have been virtually unchanged, with Leno beating "Late Show
With David Letterman" all three nights for which ratings are
available--including Monday, when Letterman returned from a weeklong
vacation and announced on the air his intent to stay at CBS.</LD>
<LD>   Analyzing data from 50 major cities monitored by ratings service
Nielsen Media Research that account for well over half of U.S.
households (national estimates for late night won't be available
until next week), Leno has averaged a 4.6 rating and 12 share this
week, meaning 4.6% of all homes and 12% of TV sets in use during that
hour were tuned to "The Tonight Show."</LD>
<TE>   Letterman enjoyed a minor spike Monday, with a 3.9 rating and 10
share, but dropped the next two nights and averaged a 3.6 rating
Monday through Wednesday, mirroring his average this season.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, "Nightline" averaged a 4 rating in its half-hour and
"Politically Incorrect With Bill Maher" averaged a 2.7 rating, both
deviating only slightly from their season-long averages.</TE>
<TE>   Those results reinforce the sense that shifts in late-night
viewing habits tend to be glacial, raising questions about how much
impact additional promotion is likely to have--especially as long as
NBC continues to beat CBS from 10:30 to 11 p.m., leading into late
local newscasts. On Wednesday, for example, a rerun of NBC's "Law &amp;
Order" more than doubled viewing of "60 Minutes II" in that
half-hour.</TE>
<TE>   The value of promotion may also be mitigated by how long the
late-night players have been in place, with many people having made
their viewing choices.</TE>
<TE>   For the season, Leno is averaging 6 million viewers per night
nationally, compared with 4.3 million watching Letterman.</TE>
<TE>   Tune-in for both shows drops after midnight, and each leads ABC's
combination of "Nightline" and "Politically Incorrect With Bill
Maher," which would have been displaced had ABC landed Letterman.
Those shows average 4.6 million and 2.6 million viewers,
respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Letterman's contract calls for CBS to leverage assets from parent
company Viacom to promote the show, including MTV, VH1 and more than
180 radio stations across the United States. Viewers can also expect
to see extensive "Late Show" promotion during CBS' coverage of the
NCAA basketball tournament.</TE>

<LD>   Now Even Miss Cleo's Birthplace Is Questioned</LD>
<LD>   Her accent notwithstanding, Miss Cleo, the "Jamaican" TV psychic,
was actually born in California, according to a birth certificate
unearthed in conjunction with a suit being filed against her in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla.</LD>
<TE>   According to the document, the Miami Herald reports, Miss Cleo was
born Youree Dell Harris on Aug. 13, 1962, in California. Her parents
are from Texas and California.</TE>
<TE>   The TV personality, spokeswoman for Access Resource Services and
Psychic Readers Network, appears on national commercials promising
revelations about love, money and other personal matters--for a fee
of $4.99 a minute. Sued by the state of Missouri and the Federal
Trade Commission, she's now being challenged by Florida authorities
to prove that she's a renowned shaman from the Caribbean island.</TE>
<TE>   Harris' attorney, William Cone Jr., said he wouldn't discuss the
document and insisted that Harris, as a contractor of Access Resource
Services, should not be party to the state lawsuit, which charges
that the company misrepresented costs, billed for services never
purchased, harassed consumers with unwanted telemarketing calls and
responded to consumer complaints with threatening language.</TE>

<TE>   Bravo Series to Focus on Book Adaptations</TE>
<TE>   A series about book-to-film adaptations is in the works for next
season on the Bravo channel.</TE>
<TE>   The 11 hour-long episodes in "Based on the Book" will look at the
process by which well-known books have been transformed into
successful films, including "Jaws," "The Cider House Rules," "Get
Shorty" and "The Silence of the Lambs."</TE>
<TE>   Other program plans announced by the cable network this week
included "Gay Weddings," an eight-part series that follows "the joys
and tribulations" of four gay and lesbian couples as they get ready
to marry; "Cirque du Soleil: A Fly on the Wall," a 13-part series
following the famed troupe as it mounts a new show; and "Art Crimes
and Mysteries," six hourlong episodes about art heists.</TE>

<TE>   'Will &amp; Grace' Re-upped by NBC</TE>
<TE>   NBC will dole out at least $3.5 million an episode to keep the
Emmy Award-winning "Will &amp; Grace" on the air through the 2004-05
season, according to the Hollywood Reporter. The Thursday-night
sitcom, which deals with the friendship between a gay man and a
straight woman, is the most successful series to come from the

<TE>   Master Chorale Tackles Salonen's Composition</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Master Chorale will present the North American
premiere of an a cappella work called "Two Songs to Poems of Ann
Jaderlund" on Saturday--the first choral work by Esa-Pekka Salonen,
music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic.</TE>
<TE>   Based on love poems by Sweden's leading living poet, the piece was
commissioned for the 75th anniversary of the Swedish Radio Chorus in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   The following week, Grant Gershon, the group's new music director,

conductor and composer," Gershon told The Times. "Both of the pieces
are extremely sensuous, in line with the evocative nature of the
poetry. And it's satisfying on both a personal and professional level
to be preparing the music of a friend."</TE>

held at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Salonen and Gershon will be
honored for artistic contributions to the Music Center.</TE>

<HD>An Artist Who Can Make Paint Behave Strangely</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PAGEL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Reed's first solo show in Los Angeles in five years
demonstrates why so many young West Coast painters are so deeply
influenced by many of the moves he makes in his abstract paintings.</LD>
<LD>   First of all, there's the technical facility the 55-year-old
brings to his labor-intensive oils and enamels, five of which are
given the space they need in three large rooms at Patricia Faure
Gallery. Reed is a seasoned veteran who has spent the better part of
three decades honing his skills and zeroing in on what he does best:
getting paint to behave strangely. He makes various mixtures of
pigment and medium do things they've never done before--things you
never thought possible and others you never imagined.</LD>
<LD>   The New York-based artist, who was born in San Diego--and appears
to have California sunlight coursing through his veins--paints like a
printmaker. This angers conservatives, who behave as if painting were
a sacrosanct calling only sullied by the lowly craft, whose cheap,
reproducible products have too much in common with mass consumption.</LD>
<TE>   To drive this point home, Reed has installed a trio of 5-foot-long
aquatints in a side gallery. Their black backgrounds and silvery
spectrum suggest moonlight-tinted mystery. At the same time, their
shimmering surfaces recall tacky black-velvet paintings. Wedding
dreamy romance and bad taste, they smolder with sensuous energy.</TE>
<TE>   In the main galleries, Reed's paintings crank up the wattage a
few-thousand-fold. Each long skinny panel consists of several
translucent veils of high-keyed color he has laid down with an
arsenal of squeegees. Beneath these are flat bands of color that have
been applied with rollers and brushes. All of his paintings highlight
the borders where one type of paint application stops and another
begins.</TE>
<TE>   For example, "#480" appears to be five variously sized paintings
superimposed atop one another, or a gigantic print whose registration
is way out of whack. Its underlying format resembles an American
flag, albeit one seen in reverse, elongated and compressed. With
lavender stripes and a blood-red field of swooping strokes, its
colors are nothing like those of the original. In fact, they recall
photographic negatives or the view through night-vision goggles.
Wispy aqua waves wash across three-quarters of the image, sandwiching
a Pepto-Bismol pink blob between foreground and back.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining four paintings make "#480" look like a pretty
picture, an attractive landscape in which anyone would love to
linger. A 12-foot-long yellow one has the presence of acid-laced
lemon meringue pie filling, its melt-in-your-mouth sweetness shot
through with the pungent bite of an unnatural additive. A 14-footer,
most of which has been painted over with a thick coat of white, makes
you feel as if you're peeking through a keyhole at an illicit scene.</TE>
<TE>   Another 12-footer ("#478") and a single vertical panel ("#471")
are among the best paintings Reed has made. These masterpieces of
spatial complexity and coloristic kinkiness combine the
down-and-dirty grittiness of the street with the sleazy beauty of
neon and the gorgeous glow of smog-enhanced sunsets. If graffiti
could dream, this is what it would see.</TE>

<TE>   Bruce Conner Offers Old Tricks and New Works</TE>
<TE>   At Michael Kohn Gallery, a solo show and a group exhibition
suggest that Bruce Conner is up to his old tricks.</TE>
<TE>   The solo show is a straightforward affair. In the darkened rear
gallery, a monitor plays eight of the legendary artist's
16-millimeter films that recently have been transferred to DVD. All
are classics of truly independent filmmaking and shouldn't be missed.</TE>
<TE>   "Breakaway" (1966) is a 21/2-minute sequence that plays twice,
first backward, then forward. In it, Toni Basil appears to be dancing
and changing in and out of mod black-and-white outfits faster than a
flashing strobe light. Long before music videos, at a time when
structuralist films were slowing perception down to a Minimalist
crawl, Conner shot and edited his piece so it functioned like a
fistful of amphetamines. Boldly demonstrating that art can be smart
and sexy, it still looks fresh today.</TE>
<TE>   Also included are "Report" (1963-67), a chilling meditation on
John F. Kennedy's assassination; "The White Rose" (1967), which
memorializes the interment of a 2,300-pound painting Jay DeFeo had
been working on for eight years; and "Take the 5:10 to Dreamland"
(1976), a poetic collage of images set to a melody by Patrick
Gleeson. Available for a minimum donation of $30 to the L.A. Free
Clinic, the L.A. Food Bank or the Venice Family Clinic, the DVD is a
steal.</TE>
<TE>   In the front gallery, 21 collages and drawings appear to be new
works by Conner. Most are homemade Rorschach blots that have been cut
into the shape of leaves and glued to paper scrolls. The rest are
ghostly versions of Conner's inkblot drawings. But the price list
states that these works were made by four artists: ANON, Anonymouse,
Anon. and Anonymous.</TE>
<TE>   Conner has a history of being slippery about his identity. In
1965, he used his thumbprint as his signature. From 1971 through '73,
he signed Dennis Hopper's name to his works. And in 1974 he locked
away a series to protect its anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The paradox of being a superstar outsider artist is not lost on
the Bay Area legend, who has never shied away from trying something
different. A light, almost lyrical touch suffuses his new works,
which seem as if a burden had been lifted from them.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Kohn Gallery, 8071 Beverly Blvd., L.A., (323) 658-8088,
through March 30. Closed Sundays and Mondays.</TE>

<TE>   Looking Past Laughs to Brittle Beauty, Sadness</TE>
<TE>   When someone says "I laughed out loud," I'm always curious to know
just what sort of sounds they made. Like people, laughter comes in
all shapes and sizes. From great rolling guffaws to muffled giggles,
it physically signals the presence of anything from amusement to
nervousness, screaming glee to biting sarcasm.</TE>
<TE>   At L.A. Louver Gallery, Tom Wudl's new paintings give precise form
to a peculiar strand of laughter. On the surface, his 10 portraits of
entertainers and still lifes that depict the tools of their trades
are amusing, filled with enough art history references to occupy
viewers who like to keep their minds busy so they don't have to deal
with their feelings.</TE>
<TE>   But there's more going on in Wudl's variously scaled acrylics on
canvas, some of which are also painted with encaustic (a pigment and
hot wax mixture), than immediately meets the eye. The more time you
spend with them, the more pointed and touching their brittle beauty
becomes.</TE>
<TE>   A deep sadness suffuses these strangely sophisticated paintings.
Their refinement has a lot less to do with the knowing nods they make
to Pablo Picasso and Jasper Johns, Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy than
with Wudl's ability to convey the quiet desperation that often drives
creative people to do what they do.</TE>
<TE>   In our culture, artists are thought of as being free, unencumbered
by ordinary responsibilities and left alone to pursue their dreams.
Forget the economic problems such fantasies present, Wudl's works lay
bare the emotional cost and psychological pain that often take shape
in the isolation of the studio. In his hands, this anxiety gives rise
to an absurd sense of humor whose fragile, high-pitched laugher is
all the more poignant for keeping self-pity at bay, if barely.</TE>

<TE>   Mixed Messages About Art's Place in the World</TE>
<TE>   Jorge Pardo's two paintings at 1301PE Gallery take his oeuvre full
circle, emphasizing what a strange trip it's been.</TE>
<TE>   One of the first works the L.A. artist exhibited 12 years ago was
a common stepladder, two legs of which had been replaced by exotic
bubinga wood. Another was a pair of baseball bats whose business ends
had been replaced with identically configured sections of cedar and
mahogany. Part utilitarian object and part beautifully grained copy,
both sculptures send mixed messages about the function of art and its
place in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Pardo's new multi-panel works are cogent essays on the
relationship between decoration and use. At 6 feet tall and between
16 and 19 feet long, each resembles a high-end fabric store's
fabulous displays. Riotously punchy colors and idiosyncratic shapes
jostle against one another, competing for your attention as they draw
out your opinion about what works and what doesn't.</TE>
<TE>   Pardo designs his patterns on a computer and uses an inkjet
printer to apply them to canvas. Sometimes he brushes on a stripe,
smear or circle of pumpkin-orange paint, but most of the time he lets
his off-balance patterns do their own thing. Rarely presenting
sections large enough to reveal how the fascinating patterns repeat
themselves, Pardo shows himself to be a master at leaving viewers
wanting more.</TE>

<HD>A Fable on Sisterhood's Subtleties</HD>
<DH>With a strong cast, 'Pauline &amp; Paulette' explores a
simple-minded woman's relationships.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Only 78 minutes long, "Pauline &amp; Paulette" doesn't make any great
statements or come to any grand conclusions. In fact, it barely comes
to a conclusion at all. Still, this beguiling Belgian fable, very
much its own droll and delicate little film, has some touching things
to say about what is important in life and why.</LD>
<LD>   The feature debut of director and co-writer Lieven Debrauwer,
"Pauline &amp; Paulette" was a word-of-mouth favorite at Cannes'
prestigious Director's Fortnight last year, when it won the audience
award. The film also took five Plateau Awards (Belgium's version of
the Oscars) and offers a memorable role for Dora van der Groen, one
of that country's most celebrated actresses.</LD>
<LD>   She plays Pauline, a simple-minded woman of middle years who lives
in a small town with her sister Martha (Julienne De Bruyn). Unable to
butter her bread and needing a fork-spoon outline drawn on the
oilcloth to set the table, Pauline considers an untied shoelace to be
a major crisis.</LD>
<TE>   Still, Pauline has her routines, the things she enjoys doing. Most
of all, she loves flowers. Sleeping with a watering can next to her
bed, Pauline begins compulsively watering as soon as she gets up.
Sometimes she'll run a small errand for Martha in town, doddering
around with a child-like lurch. "Leave Paulette alone," Martha
screams at Pauline as she heads off, but this is not to be.</TE>
<TE>   For Pauline is completely fixated on Paulette (Ann Petersen),
intoxicated with the perceived glamour of her life. In reality,
Paulette is simply another sister, irritable and overweight, who runs
a fabric shop and stars in local operettas, but to Pauline she's as
magical and irresistible as an enormous rose.</TE>
<TE>   Pauline beams whenever she's in Paulette's presence, and no one
ever took as much pure joy in a piece of paper as she does in
Paulette's rose-patterned gift wrap.</TE>
<TE>   Paulette, for her part, does not return Pauline's interest. Not
even close. She views her sister as a pest, someone who is forever
touching things that shouldn't be touched and making her customers
uncomfortable.</TE>
<TE>   One of the distinctive things about "Pauline &amp; Paulette" is that,
far from making Pauline into the expected font of goodness and
natural virtues, the film is sympathetic to Paulette and completely
understands that Pauline can be quite a handful.</TE>
<TE>   Engagingly played by Van der Groen, Pauline often comes off as
nothing so much as a stubborn, willful child, not malicious but
something of a menace nevertheless. She's absolutely determined to
get what she wants when she wants it, whether it be someone to cut
her food or a glimpse of Paulette at the operetta. When she says,
"Don't want to," she can be quite a chore to budge.</TE>
<TE>   "Pauline &amp; Paulette's" action begins when Martha suddenly dies,
or, as Pauline puts it after the hearse leaves, "Martha gone in a big
car."</TE>
<TE>   At this point, fourth sister Cecile (Rosemarie Bergmans), who
lives in Brussels, materializes for heated discussions with Paulette
about Pauline's future.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Cecile, busy with her French boyfriend (Idwig Stephane),
nor Paulette, busy with her operettas, wants the burden of caring for
their sister. Paulette suggests a home, but Martha's will stipulates
that one of the sisters must look after Pauline if all of them are to
share in her estate.</TE>
<TE>   Both sisters, as the film develops, take turns trying to cope with
Pauline, and both have difficulties that are poignant as well as
amusing. What happens ultimately is subtle and satisfying, a tribute
not only to the cast's skill, but to Debrauwer's understanding that
life's choices may not be obvious or easy, but, with luck, even
difficulties can be worked out in the end.</TE>

<HD>TV Series Development Is a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BURT PRELUTSKY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Often I've heard it suggested that if the TV networks would only
allow creative writer-producers to work unfettered, it would
inaugurate a new golden age. Maybe, maybe not. But, in any case, what
fun would that be for the executives in charge of program
development? I mean, why would anybody want to grow up to be a TV
V.P. if he or she couldn't tell other people what to write and how to
write it?</LD>
<LD>   Oh, sure, it's nice to have a big office and an attractive
secretary, an expense account and an attractive secretary, one's name
on a parking space and an attractive secretary, but a person could
work in the insurance business and have all that. But no insurance
executive will ever experience the transcendental joy of telling a
professional writer how to write a joke or develop a character arc
or, best of all, of telling him that his script is worthless.</LD>
<LD>   As this is the time of year when the networks traditionally decide
which pilots live or die, I am reminded of the first time I became
convinced that the development process by which TV series are created
might well have been invented by Rube Goldberg, with an able assist
by the Monty Python pranksters.</LD>
<TE>   About 12 or 13 years ago, I was teaching a scriptwriting course
for UCLA Extension. On occasion, I would break up the routine by
inviting guest speakers. This one evening, I'd invited a fellow I'd
had several dealings with, the director of comedy development for
CBS. So far as I could tell, his chief qualification for the job was
that he'd been director of dramatic development for CBS and had grown
bored with the gig.</TE>
<TE>   To be honest about it, I had never enjoyed the process of pitching
pilot ideas--not to him, not to anyone. It seemed to require the
writer to be part carnival barker and part Fuller Brush salesman. I
could never figure out what the usual dog-and-pony show had to do
with writing. The process seemed to favor extroverts who could come
into a room with a load of foo-foo dust, temporarily blinding the
executive to the fact that what he was being sold was a very ugly pig
in a very shoddy poke.</TE>
<TE>   Having the network V.P. in my bailiwick, I took advantage of the
opportunity to ask him to analyze the process from his vantage point.
To start with, I asked him how many pitch meetings he had sat through
during the previous year. "About fifteen hundred," he said. It
sounded like an exaggeration but allowing, say, half an hour per
session, one could probably handle 10 or 12 a day and still have time
left over for putting practice, leisurely lunches and the occasional
afternoon nap.</TE>
<TE>   "Of the fifteen hundred pitches you heard," I went on, "how many
resulted in script orders?"</TE>
<TE>   "About 90," he answered.</TE>
<TE>   "And of those 90, how many pilots actually got produced?"</TE>
<TE>   "Fifteen."</TE>
<TE>   "And of those 15, how many finally became TV series?"</TE>
<TE>   "One. 'Frank's Place.'"</TE>
<TE>   The students, to their credit, either gasped or giggled. I seem to
recall doing a little of both.</TE>
<TE>   "So you're telling us," I summed up, "that you sat through fifteen
hundred pitches in order to come up with a single show that was
canceled after one season?"</TE>
<TE>   He actually looked stunned for a moment, almost as if until that
moment he'd been unaware of the amount of time he'd wasted.</TE>
<TE>   He did go on to say how proud he was of the show. I acknowledged
that the critics had loved the series, even if I and the majority of
America's TV viewers thought "Frank's Place" was slow, unfunny and,
worst of all, pretentious.</TE>
<TE>   Considering the enormous expenditure of man-hours and the dismal
results, I wondered why he, along with all the other development
executives, simply didn't ask writers to submit their notions on a
single piece of paper, then follow up with only the ones that struck
their fancy. Using his own calculations, it would have meant he could
have avoided sitting through 1,410 pitches.</TE>
<TE>   He had the gall to say, "I only wish I could. I love to read. The
problem is that writers don't want to write; they all want the chance
to come in and sell their ideas."</TE>
<TE>   Back then, I was still in the business of writing pilots and he
was, after all, not only a development executive at one of only three
markets but a guest in my classroom, so I refrained from pointing out
that he was a liar-liar and, what's more, his pants were on fire.
There isn't a TV executive in the world who would rather read than be
pandered to by 1,500 hungry writers and greedy producers.</TE>
<TE>   Pages, after all, don't pander.</TE>
<TE>   But, lest you think I am being too harsh on the folks who
determine what TV shows we get to watch, I will say that their
colleagues who develop movies are far, far worse. In TV, at least,
demographics aside for the moment, the bottom line is that they want
to be the ones who find the next "Seinfeld," the next "Friends," the
next "West Wing."</TE>
<TE>   They want to achieve popular success. That, oddly enough, is not
the case with the folks who develop for the big screen.</TE>
<TE>   The fact is that if any other business in America worked the way
the movies do, we would soon run out of steel, clothing, food,
computers, you name it. For no matter what other shortcomings these
industries may suffer from, their first order of business is to
satisfy the customer, at least to the extent of giving him what he
seems to want. Even the Mafia, for crying out loud, is looking to
supply a variety of demands.</TE>
<TE>   But consider that, year in and year out, the most successful
movies are those rated G and PG-- that is, family fare. They don't
sweep the Oscars; they just clean up at the box office. But for the
most part, those people working in motion picture development want no
part of such movies, because they're not the least bit concerned with
what the general public wants to see; they live only to impress their
counterparts. They like to lunch with one another and brag that the
projects they're green-lighting are those that push the envelope,
explore the dark side, have an edge.</TE>
<TE>   The projects that excite them are rife with nudity, violence and
profanity. If some new director, fresh out of film school, can be
attached, guaranteeing that the final product will be under-lighted,
overlong and basically incomprehensible, so much the better.</TE>
<TE>   The cherry on the sundae is, of course, signing the likes of John
Malkovich, Gary Oldman, Christopher Walken and/or Tim Roth to play
the lead. These executives simply adore those neurotic types whose
mannered performances inevitably garner raves from half a dozen
pompous reviewers. It not only doesn't matter that their movies
inevitably bomb with a regularity that the brass at the Pentagon can
only envy, it's also a huge part of their appeal.</TE>
<TE>   These executives come and go, but the mind-set remains the same,
no matter who is seated behind the desk. The real problem is that
their bosses, usually being middle-aged or older, are fearful that
they're out of touch with this week's culture scene andtherefore feel
compelled to place their trust in the taste and instincts of these
twentysomethings.</TE>
<TE>   One can only sympathize with these aging producers. After all,
it's bad enough being stuck on the wrong side of 40 or 50 without
proving how far beyond the pale you are by confessing that Gary
Oldman bores you stiff or that you haven't ever been able to sit
through a movie that either featured or was directed by Sean Penn.</TE>
<TE>   The only reason that all of Hollywood, except for Disney, Pixar
and DreamWorks, doesn't simply dry up and blow away is that, thanks
to TV sales, videos, DVDs and foreign sales, it is nearly impossible
for a movie, no matter how putrid, to lose money these days.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, when you stop and think about it, the wonder of it all
isn't that occasionally something wonderful gets produced for
television or the movies but that, considering the number of
chowderheads in charge, anything at all gets made.</TE>

<HD>Robin Williams' Humor at a Human Pace</HD>
<DH>No longer riffing at rat-a-tat speed, he returns to
stand-up with topical but not biting material.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN RAUZI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Time was--before the kids' movies, before the Oscar nominations--that
you needed to snort down about three shots of espresso to keep up
with Robin Williams on a stand-up comedy tear. These days, with
Williams on his first multi-city comedy tour in more than 15 years, a
cup of coffee would probably do the trick.</LD>
<LD>   Williams is still quick with a one-line aside, but Wednesday night
at the Universal Amphitheatre, in the first of a two-night stand, he
was moving at a more human pace.</LD>
<LD>   Dressed in casual black in front of a ridiculous palm-frond
display on the stage, Williams opened--as he has elsewhere on this
26-city tour--with local and topical humor. He wondered, for
instance, how Washington, D.C., would handle a Mike Tyson boxing
bout, now that the district has given him a license. "Washington,
D.C., has been used to back-biting--but not literally." Then, in his
announcer voice: "Let's get ready to nibble!"</LD>
<TE>   He dug into some political material as well, riffing on Congress
and boy king George II, "a compassionate conservative. That's like a
Volvo with a gun rack."</TE>
<TE>   Although the president, airplane hijacking and bombing Afghanistan
all were targets, Williams never aimed beyond the acceptable. At his
darkest, he still has a night light on.</TE>
<TE>   While his bottomless bag of accents provides the easy laughs--such
as the drunk Scotsman who speaks only in vowels--his physical humor
is often better. A so-so bit on airport security was revived when he
acted out how his heavily pierced friends go through a metal
detector. A historian's recent assertion that Adolf Hitler might've
been gay yielded a hilarious and unexpected
goose-step-as-musical-theater number.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' act is still muscular but also tense. A brief moment
when he lost track of a punch line reminded the audience what a
high-wire act stand-up still is for anyone, even Williams. (Maybe
especially Williams, the Oscar-winning movie star.) He isn't yet at
ease with the quiet moments in his routine; moments that could be
relaxing breathing room are a bit panic-filled. It might be that the
audience expected the rat-a-tat stream-of-consciousness humor he did
in the 1980s, but it felt more as if this one-time sprinter is
struggling some with the pacing of a longer race.</TE>
<TE>   But when it all worked, he had the audience with him at every
joke, every gesture. His routine about how Koko, the gorilla who
knows sign language, would play the dating game flowed easily. There
was a similar comfort to his bits on the uncomfortable aspects of
growing older--when a colonoscopy camera becomes "your own Discovery
Channel special."</TE>
<TE>   Now 50, Williams has been talking about coming back to stand-up
for at least three years, and this tour seems part of a larger effort
to reinflate his persona. He has some films in the can that are the
antithesis of the Robin-Williams-as-savior movies ("Good Will
Hunting," "Patch Adams"). "Death to Smoochy," directed by Danny
DeVito, has him plotting revenge against his replacement on a kids'
TV show. In "One Hour Photo," he's an unstable photo processor
obsessed with a local family, and in "Insomnia," he's a murderer
playing cat-and-mouse with the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there's something about the big-hearted movie characters
that Williams is known for that allows him to caricature gay men,
blacks, Asians, even the developmentally delayed, and never be
suspected of being mean-spirited. And there's something about an
evening of smart, if not biting, comedy, that made a largely adoring
audience forget "Bicentennial Man."</TE>

<HD>'First Lady Suite': Marrying Into History</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Philip Brandes and F. Kathleen Foley</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Presidential wives don't spring to mind as a natural subject for a
musical. After all, there aren't many common threads to explore in an
accidental category of diverse personalities included only by their
circumstantial marriage to the elected occupants of the White House.</LD>
<LD>   It took the offbeat talent of composer/playwright Michael John
LaChiusa. ("Hello Again," "The Wild Party") to recognize that the
very capriciousness of these women's stature--and their different
ways of coping with it--is itself a theme rich with creative
possibilities. While the result of his fascination--"First Lady
Suite"--displays some arbitrary caprices of its own, this witty,
quirky musical never fails to charm and engage in a newly revised
incarnation courtesy of the Blank Theatre Company.</LD>
<LD>   As director Daniel Henning points out in his program notes, first
ladies are our American royalty, achieving prominence by virtue of
their social position rather than their accomplishments. Unlike
genetic royalty, however, few first ladies were bred for the mantle
thrust upon them.</LD>
<TE>   In his fun, inventive staging, Henning has configured the stage as
a museum exhibit--complete with photos, historical narrative and
newsreel footage on a video display--through which the audience is
invited to stroll before the show. The setting is perfect for the
striking ensemble opening number, "The First Lady," in which
representatives from various eras gather onstage to introspect about
their changing role.</TE>
<TE>   From there, the show is structured into four surreal vignettes
featuring, respectively, Jacqueline Kennedy, Mamie Eisenhower, Bess
Truman and Eleanor Roosevelt, each loosely inspired by historical
incidents.</TE>
<TE>   The first sequence is an exchange aboard Air Force One in which
Jacqueline Kennedy (Bronwen Booth) obsesses over details of her
appearance with her long-suffering personal secretary, Mary Gallagher
(Heather Lee), who dozes off into a reverie examining the heightened
level of visibility spawned by Jackie's charisma. The whimsical humor
darkens as we realize the plane is bringing them to Dallas for the
fateful motorcade.</TE>
<TE>   Next, Eydie Alyson gives a luminous performance as a befuddled
Mamie Eisenhower drawn into the birth of the civil rights movement,
the show's high point. Alyson recalls the ditsiness of Gracie Allen
as her Mamie enlists black opera singer Marian Anderson (Paula
Newsome) in a time-travel journey back to confront General Ike
(Gregory Jbara) over his wartime fling with his driver (Irene
Warner). For Mamie, the personal betrayal of Ike's adultery and the
social tragedy of prejudice are inextricably, and hilariously,
linked.</TE>
<TE>   Jbara returns as Bess Truman in a bizarre one-note (but mercifully
short) comic bit about the grumpy first lady continuously
interrupting a recital by daughter Margaret (Warner).</TE>
<TE>   The final and most visually stylish sequence speculates on the
impromptu airplane flight that followed aviator Amelia Earhart's
(Kate Shindle) dinner at the White House with Eleanor Roosevelt
(Evelyn Halus) and her longtime companion Lorena Hickock (Mary-Pat
Green). Leaving gravity and realism behind, the trio ruminate on
their era's fragile emerging possibilities of self-fulfillment for
women and the associated high emotional costs.</TE>
<TE>   While LaChiusa's lyrics sometimes lapse into preciousness
(especially in the final sequence), beneath their good-natured comedy
are his fresh, surreal historical riffs that are slyly subversive in
a way we haven't seen since "Assassins."</TE>

<TE>   'The Dumb Waiter' Serves Up Humor, Terror</TE>
<TE>   Harold Pinter's early one-act, "The Dumb Waiter," contains all the
elements that Pinter would later amplify in his full-length plays.
There's the hallmark interplay of dominance and submission, the
existential terror of characters trapped in increasingly inimical
circumstances, and, most importantly, the caustic humor that
underscores the prevalent dread.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge of Pinter's plays is that they are blank slates that
must be etched with the acid intent of their interpreters. The
current production of "The Dumb Waiter" at St. Stephen's Church in
Hollywood is a case in point--well-staged, finely focused and hissing
with purpose.</TE>
<TE>   In the play, two working-class hit men, holed up in a bare room,
await the go-ahead for their latest "job." The pun in Pinter's title
is evident.</TE>
<TE>   Both men are "waiters," but only one is "dumb" enough to question
his dominant counterpart about the "organization" that employs
them--a line of inquiry that proves lethal. Meanwhile, a dumbwaiter
in this supposedly abandoned building creaks and clatters, bearing
cryptic notes from an unseen entity upstairs.</TE>
<TE>   Brief and riveting, "The Dumb Waiter" is a curtain-raiser for
Pinter's later career, a blueprint for the dramaturgical mastery that
was to come. In director/designer Brian Eatwell's current staging,
the tone is both ludicrous and terrifying, as well it should be. An
arena for disorientation, Eatwell's rat-trap set, lighted with
appropriate harshness by Don Fauntleroy, echoes with the dripping
water and running toilets of Tyler Bowe's disturbing sound design.</TE>
<TE>   The technical elements are solid down to the ground, but Eatwell's
true coup is his cast. Stage vets with extensive credits on both
sides of the pond--Derrick O'Connor, who plays Gus, the hapless
underling, and Michael O'Hagan, who plays Gus' controlling partner,
Ben--are perfectly cast as two British proles whose business just
happens to be murder. Weary and craggy, they have the pinpoint timing
necessary to infuse Pinter's seminal exercise with meaning and
menace.</TE>

<TE>   In 'Trust,' Looking For Someone Better</TE>
<TE>   Poor Becca. Here she sits--bright, young and attractive--attending
an out-of-town publishers convention, suffering through a date with
another man who's not in her league and wondering "why she has to
pander to the midgets around her."</TE>
<TE>   Before you feel too sorry for her, though, keep in mind that Becca
has a fiance named Cody back home in L.A. He's an up-and-coming
singer, no less--who's pursuing his own amorous fling with Leah, a
faded rock superstar.</TE>
<TE>   In their respective single-minded quests for self-gratification,
Cody and Becca deserve each other, though the essential quality
ironically spotlighted in the title of Steven Dietz's "Trust" is, by
design, nowhere to be found in The- SpyAnts' revival at the Hollywood
Court Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   Dietz's play sports betrayal of soap operatic proportions against
the gritty backdrop of the music business, laced with ample
eroticism--elements that sustain interest in Vincent Castellanos'
capable staging. What it doesn't have are principal characters
inherently worth caring about, and even convincingly depicting them
demands nuances that frequently exceed the earnest efforts of a
fledgling troupe still honing its performance skills.</TE>
<TE>   Darlene Mann's jaded Leah is the most fully realized in her hard,
cynically frank persona, but there is no arc to her--she's the same
after her affair with Cody as when she starts it. As Cody, the
show-biz novice out of his depth as he tries to cope with stardom,
Brett Hren is a charismatic presence but emotionally out of his depth
as he tries to cope with the fireworks in his rocky relationship.
Becca is a perky but complex and still unsolved puzzle as portrayed
by Mary Van Luven, who does very well with fury but hasn't yet found
a way to sell the character's unexpected choices.</TE>
<TE>   "Trust" is one of that curious breed of highly clinical
contemporary plays (Patrick Marber's "Closer" is a slicker,
better-crafted specimen) that dissect relationships as if they took
place in a petri dish--some alternate universe populated only by the
other characters in the play, with whom they combine and recombine in
geometric configurations. Hence, in a city the size of L.A., Becca
has her wedding dress made by Leah's former lesbian roommate,
Gretchen (Marina Mouhibian), while Holly (Jocelyn Jackson), an even
more self-absorbed twentysomething friend of Gretchen's and Leah's,
is the chance object of infatuation of a public radio host (Greg
Woodhill) whose interview with Cody and Leah triggers a pivotal
crisis. Very neat, tidy and uninvolving.</TE>

<HD>'Resident Evil's' Gore Is Guilty Fun</HD>
<DH>This latest computer-game spinoff stars Milla Jovovich,
Michelle Rodriguez and gallons of barbecue sauce.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAN STUART</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Strolled down the Champs-Elysee? Sipped Bellinis on the Piazza San
Marco? Well, you haven't really lived till you've seen a mini-skirted
Milla Jovovich kick-box the living daylights out of a pack of rabid
dogs slathered in barbecue sauce.</LD>
<LD>   Technically speaking, the dogs aren't alive. They are among the
walking undead who roam the underbelly of Raccoon City in search of
human flesh. There are hundreds of them, undead dogs and undead
people, popping out from dark corners all over the place. We're
talking a major shipment of barbecue sauce.</LD>
<LD>   Makeup artists, 14-year-old boys and camp aficionados live for
moments like this. And there are a ton of them in "Resident Evil," a
ditsy and dizzying spook-house thriller in high-tech, high-hemline
gear.</LD>
<TE>   Along with Jovovich, it features Michelle Rodriguez, a
tough-talking, attitude-throwing veteran of "The Fast and the
Furious" who is working overtime for the title of the 21st century's
first true B-movie queen.</TE>
<TE>   Direct from that new Great White Way for culturally bereft
Hollywood producers, best-selling computer games, "Resident Evil" is
easily as mindless as last year's drag-racing sleeper and at least as
much guilt-ridden fun.</TE>
<TE>   Much of it takes place in the steel-and-glass subterranean
catacombs of the Umbrella Corp., a mega-scientific conglomerate doing
secret, illegal viral and genetic research. To judge from its
fabulous employees, none of whom look old enough to pass as a
convincing authority figure without a machine gun in hand, the
Umbrella Corp. is organized by the same human resources department
that staffs Ian Shrager's hotels.</TE>
<TE>   When most of them are wiped out by an artificial intelligence
hissy-fit, a squad of suitably sexy in-house cops led by Jovovich,
Rodriguez, Eric Mabius and Martin Crewes attempts an escape. There
are nasty obstacles at every turn--this was a computer game, after
all--and people die fantastically graphic deaths that may make the
older members of the audience faintly nostalgic for the primitive
innocence of Pac-Man.</TE>
<TE>   There is a lot of loud, sullen grunge rock on the soundtrack and a
nihilistic open-ended climax to ensure Jovovich's future employment.
Co-star Mabius has enough Albee, Beckett and Chekhov on his resume to
ensure his as well. There may not be life after Raccoon City, but
there will always be regional theater.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for strong sci-fi/horror violence, language and
brief sexuality/nudity. Times guidelines: The film is too violent for
children.</TE>

<HD>Strained Sophistication From Vienna</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tuesday, midway through its three-night visit to the Orange County
Performing Arts Center, the Vienna Philharmonic took a baby step into
the 20th century.</LD>
<LD>   As Berg wrote his Three Pieces, Opus 6, between 1913 and 1915, the
First World War was breaking out. Remnants of old Vienna's waltzes
and military marches swirl through these concentrated pieces, no
longer representing agreeable times. Berg was still deeply attached
to the Romanticism of Mahler and had also hitched his wagon to the
Modernist Schoenberg. Berg's Opus 6 was music of a young composer who
yearned for the past yet recognized the present.</LD>
<LD>   The Vienna Philharmonic performance, led by Bernard Haitink, had
the character of amplification--every gesture was larger than life;
the climaxes were very loud. This orchestra is a highly evolved
machine that can turn up the decibels without the slightest
distortion, and it did so proudly. When it was over, someone booed.</LD>
<TE>   The boo seemed almost invited--the performance was
self-consciously attention-getting, and Bergian turmoil couldn't help
but appear exaggerated next to the Classical niceties of Mozart's
"Haffner" Symphony or the exalted lyricism of Schubert's C-Major
Symphony (the "Great"), also on the program. But for Orange County,
it marked a moment of cultural arrival.</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago, this hallowed orchestra came to Segerstrom Hall,
and it was regarded with simple awe. This time around, the audiences
are more sophisticated. The Philharmonic Society, which sponsored the
concerts, leads tours to the Salzburg Festival, where booing is
common. The society has built such an array of attractions that its
audience really can start to feel secure in expressing its own
tastes. Bravo to the boo.</TE>
<TE>   But sophistication can go too far, and I think it did, for other
reasons, on Tuesday and Wednesday. On Monday, the group scaled
Olympian heights with a magnificent performance of Bruckner's Eighth
Symphony, majestic and superbly human. The next two nights, the group
remained on high, complacently looking down. On Tuesday, Mozart's
"Haffner" was lumpen; had it been sprightlier, Haitink might not have
felt compelled to drive Berg down our throats. Schubert's symphony
brought out the group's silken smoothness, but it too was played with
dogged determination.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's program was designed for a bit of adventure. Brahms'
lively Variations on a Theme of Haydn and Haydn's ever-surprising
Symphony No. 101 ("The Clock") were on the first half. After
intermission came Strauss' tone poem "Don Quixote." Again, the
playing was peerless. Winds so pure, so utterly in tune, immediately
put a listener in a very good mood when the musicians opened the
Brahms. How delicious was the tick-tocking, in ever changing
instrumental colors, throughout the Andante of Haydn's symphony. But
Haitink drove through these pieces as if control of the vehicle and
destination were his reason for the trip, not the scenery or the joys
of unexpected detours.</TE>
<TE>   "Don Quixote" displayed an orchestra thrilled with itself and the
sounds it can make. The solo cello (which impersonates the Don) and
solo viola (Sancho Panza) were drawn from the ranks of the orchestra.
Franz Bartolomey is as elegant an orchestral cellist as you would
ever want to hear, but his playing was elegance unrelieved, bringing
out few of the qualities of the bumptious knight. He made the final
passages, the Don's dying breaths, beautiful in the extreme, but by
then the tenderness had become cloying. Tobias Lea, on the other
hand, was a bountiful Sancho, his big, robust tone a more sustaining
pleasure.</TE>
<TE>   Haitink does not relax on the podium, and if he has a sense of
humor, it was too dry to make the Haydn or Strauss as much fun as
they might be. Only in the Bruckner was he able to sustain a sense of
music unfolding with inevitability, grace and grandeur. But he is a
thorough musician, and the Vienna Philharmonic plays for him with
utter commitment.</TE>
<TE>   Waltzes by Josef Strauss were the encores on Tuesday ("Delirium,"
playing off the Berg) and Wednesday ("Music of the Spheres"). They
were wonderfully played but were taken too seriously to sound like
dance music and, in fact, under Haitink, revealed a few chinks in the
armor of mid-19th century Viennese society.</TE>
<TE>   But no one, of course, booed.</TE>

<LD>"The thing that attracted people to George the most is that he didn't
have any message to give." So says the mother of George Willig, who
in 1977 became the first person to climb one of New York's World
Trade Center towers.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps appropriately, a similar lack of message will be what
attracts or repels viewers watching "Fame for 15," the fast-food
documentary that recaps Willig's life.</LD>
<LD>   The episode on Willig and fellow skyscraper daredevil Dan Goodwin
debuts tonight (8, TNN) as part of a 15-hour marathon of the series,
which applies the style of "Biography" and "Behind the Music" to
those whom fame only sideswiped. Willig and Goodwin draw Princess
Diana-like attention, with interviews, family photos and the
always-feeble slow-motion dramatization.</LD>
<TE>   Repeat episodes featured in the marathon, which begins at 9 a.m.,
focus on such momentary celebrities as John Wayne Bobbitt, Darva
Conger, "Mayflower Madam" Sydney Biddle Barrows and George Holliday,
the man who videotaped the brutal arrest of Rodney G. King.</TE>
<TE>   For all the time it devotes to Willig and Goodwin, "Fame for 15"
overreaches in attempting to glean insight from them. For example,
the program offers this reflection from Willig on his decision to
climb: "I didn't do it as a publicity stunt, although I guess in some
ways I did."</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, although Willig built an undeniably unique bond with
the Twin Towers, his reactions during a post-Sept. 11 visit to the
site are sufficiently banal that the decision to bother airing them
seems exploitative of the tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia and nostalgia buffs figure to be the core audience of "Fame
for 15," so executive producer Gay Rosenthal might do better to keep
things tailored for them. Long after Willig's walk through the attack
site is forgotten, true fans of "Fame for 15" will revel in knowing
that the first man to scale the World Trade Center later dated former
"Dallas" star Morgan Brittany.</TE>

<HD>'Y Tu Mama' Passionately Embraces Life and Cinema</HD>
<DH>The unapologetically sexual coming-of-age tale from Mexico
evokes the French New Wave in its joyousness and depth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Outrageous without being offensive, provocatively and
unapologetically sexual, alive to the possibilities of life and
cinema, Alfonso Cuaron's "Y Tu Mama Tambien" is a sophisticated film
happily masquerading as something off the cuff.</LD>
<LD>   Nominally a simple road movie about two Mexican teenagers taking
off to look for a mythical beach in the company of a suddenly
available woman of 28, "Y Tu Mama" manages to be comic, dramatic,
erotic, sociological and even political, all without breaking a
sweat.</LD>
<LD>   Cuaron's picture, co-written with his brother Carlos, is more than
anything reminiscent of the classics of the French New Wave. Echoing
films like Jean-Luc Godard's recently reissued "Band of Outsiders"
and Francois Truffaut's "Jules and Jim," it makes exceptional use of
a detached, omniscient narrator, but the parallels don't stop there.</LD>
<TE>   "Y Tu Mama" also echoes the unmistakable freshness and excitement
of the Nouvelle Vague, the sense of joy in being alive and making
movies, that made those works distinctive and unforgettable.</TE>
<TE>   To be able to turn out something this apparently effortless and
natural paradoxically takes a background of craft and experience.
Cuaron caught the eye of the studio system with his Mexican debut
film, "Love in the Time of Hysteria," which got parlayed into a pair
of Hollywood literary adaptations, the well-done "A Little Princess"
and the much less so "Great Expectations."</TE>
<TE>   Wanting, after that encounter, to "go off and get my hands dirty,"
Cuaron and his longtime collaborator, gifted cinematographer Emmanuel
Lubezki (twice Oscar-nominated, for "Little Princess" and "Sleepy
Hollow"), returned to their homeland to make what turned out to be a
sexually candid, deeply Mexican film that pulses with energy and
spirit.</TE>
<TE>   "Y Tu Mama" (even its title is a bragging sexual reference) begins
with a graphic bedroom scene in front of a huge poster for "Harold
and Maude" between 17-year-old Tenoch (Diego Luna) and a girlfriend
about to head off for a summer in Italy. Tenoch's homeboy Julio (Gael
Garcia Bernal of "Amores Perros"), it turns out, is being left behind
in similar fashion.</TE>
<TE>   Formidably self-centered best friends who do everything from
getting high to pleasuring themselves together, Tenoch and Julio are
dripping with attitude and conceit. Though their humor runs to
flatulence jokes and their interest in the outside world is confined
to interchanges like "left-wing chicks are hot"/"totally," they
nevertheless view themselves as epitomes of knowledge and
sophistication.</TE>
<TE>   The film's attitude toward these two is one of the keys to its
success. "Y Tu Mama" is neither complicit with the boys nor hostile
to them; rather, aided by the voice-over, it views them from an
amused and interested distance, entertained by their energy and sass
but knowing full well what essentially clueless space cowboys they
are, not bad kids but spoiled by Tenoch's position as a child of
privilege and affluence.</TE>
<TE>   One of the casual ways that voice-over asserts its influence,
makes political points and sets a shrewd tone is by letting us know
that these two are not from the same world. Julio is supported by a
working single mother while Tenoch's father is a Harvard-educated
politician once accused of selling tainted food to the poor. He was
going to call his son Hernan (after, as Mexican audiences are likely
to assume, the conqueror Cortes) but impulsively chose an Aztec name
instead because they were momentarily fashionable.</TE>
<TE>   Bored beyond belief by their vapid, druggy summer, the friends
perk up at a wedding so establishment the joke is that there are more
bodyguards than guests. The boys all but drool over the beautiful
Spanish-born Luisa (Maribel Verdu), the wife of one of Tenoch's
cousins. When she asks about Mexico's beaches, they make one up out
of thin air, call it Heaven's Mouth and offer to drive her there if
she's ever in the mood.</TE>
<TE>   After a phone call from her absent husband, who tearily confesses
to what is not his first infidelity, Luisa is suddenly in the mood.
Though they have no idea where they're going, the boys are too
excited at the trip's fantasy prospects not to agree and, more
unready than any of them realize, off they all go on a classic
coming-of-age jaunt.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, a getting-to-know-you period happens first.
Luisa is not the ethereal philosopher the boys fantasized but a
lively and down-to-earth dental technician. The friends like her so
much they reveal the existence of their secret society, the
Charolastras, which has precepts like "the truth is cool but
unattainable."</TE>
<TE>   Gradually, as the three get more complicit, emotional and, yes,
sexual complications, both erotic and comical, take center stage.
These underline quite a different precept: Be careful what you wish
for; you might actually get it. Yet no matter how unsettling things
become, "Y Tu Mama's" emotional balance, its ability to avoid the
gratuitous and keep everything recognizably human, prevents the
material from being off-putting.</TE>
<TE>   A key factor in this is the skill of the actors, all at ease with
the film's dramatic complexities and sexual content. First among
equals, however, is Spanish actress Verdu, who starred in Fernando
Trueba's Oscar-winning "Belle Epoque" several years back. Her Luisa
is a rich, empathetic character, uncertain yet brave in her
willingness to be alive to her emotions, with all the risks that that
attitude entails.</TE>
<TE>   Though the film's advance word will prepare audiences for "Y Tu
Mama's" sexual antics, passion is not this trip's only component.
Cuaron and his collaborators are intent on giving us a vivid,
kaleidoscopic vision of roadside Mexico, from local festivities to
steers blocking the highway. When Luisa says, "You're so lucky to
live in Mexico; it breathes with life," she is speaking for the film
as well.</TE>
<TE>   Simultaneously, "Y Tu Mama" is making offhanded but pointed
comments about the country's political situation. Though they rarely
mention it, the three drive through an endless series of
police-military checkpoints. And the voice-over, calmly noting things
like a laborer hit by a bus because no place to cross a highway
exists for miles or a fisherman who will soon be forced to become a
janitor because of the construction of a luxury hotel, casually lets
us know what the power of a ruling oligarchy can mean for ordinary
lives.</TE>
<TE>   Though "Y Tu Mama" has its serious aspects, pointing them out may
make this graceful film sound different from what it is. What could
be more satisfying than strong characters, a sense of humor and a
handful of unabashedly erotic scenes, including one that climaxes
with a wonderful twist? Jazzed by film's potential to tell all kinds
of stories in all kinds of ways, director Cuaron did more than get
his hands dirty. He struck a kind of gold.</TE>
<TE>   No MPAA rating. Times guidelines: extremely explicit sexual scenes
and very strong language.</TE>

<HD>It's Easy-Listening Nastiness</HD>
<DH>A sentimental streak undercuts the gleeful evil in 'Sweet
Smell of Success' adaptation.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Memo to producers bedazzled by the twinkling dollars over "The
Producers":</LD>
<LD>   If it were easy to invent a musical-theater language with which to
translate an iconic film, the recycling bins of Broadway would not be
heavy with Hollywood dreams that refused to sing and dance.</LD>
<LD>   So it goes with "Sweet Smell of Success," the ambitious but inert
attempt to turn that 1957 demi-classic about gossip-driven New York
ruthlessness into a dark and edgy musical. The show, which opened
Thursday night at the Martin Beck Theatre, has John Lithgow as a
deliciously, creepily duplicitous J.J. Hunsecker, the character Burt
Lancaster created from the destructive power of columnist Walter
Winchell.</LD>
<TE>   Lithgow's J.J. is matched, old slime for new, by Brian d'Arcy
James as Sidney, the young press agent and toady whose smarmy depths
were first crawled by Tony Curtis.</TE>
<TE>   But Lithgow, James and the rest of the hard-working cast are all
dressed up with nothing to play. There's the acrid whiff of
desperation in this "Sweet Smell," not to mention a dullness that
suggests compromise among the creative team's high-powered mishmash
of sensibilities.</TE>
<TE>   For example, while Nicholas Hytner, the distinguished and edgy
British director and new head of London's Royal National Theatre,
works Sidney into an inky froth of incredulous self-love and
flop-sweat for what's meant to be his big "My Turn" number, lyricist
Craig Carnelia pulls the plug on momentum with such pap as "It's time
to tear through that door/It's time now to soar."</TE>
<TE>   And while that master of woozy absurdity, John Guare, is trying to
develop complex relationships and adding bits of witty dialogue to
the best of the noir zingers from Clifford Odets and Ernest Lehman's
movie script, composer Marvin Hamlisch is soft-pedaling the hard
heart with repressed sentiment.</TE>
<TE>   It is hard to imagine a less likely soul mate for this gleefully
nasty material than Hamlisch, the easy-listening expert behind the
simple, ingratiating tunes of "A Chorus Line." When his '50s
jazz-popsy music here is not being incongruous, it is
nondescript--monotonous grinding rhythms in lieu of commentary about
J.J.'s reign of slander, phony patriotism and proxy violence.</TE>
<TE>   We know this is a dark musical because nobody turns up the lights.
Bob Crowley surrounds the story with a fairly static, ominously
glittery Manhattan skyline. Think Tim Burton's Gotham in "Batman,"
with drop-in set pieces for nightclubs that look depressingly alike,
and with lights, by Natasha Katz, finding beautiful new variations of
garish reds and blues in the night sky.</TE>
<TE>   Her purples in the clouds before dawn say New York more
authentically than any moment by the self-serious Greek chorus of
swarming pedestrians and/or journalists. This is a ludicrous cliche,
with men in fedoras and women in hourglass dresses clumping and
glaring with stock alienation while mock-whispering, "What you gonna
do, Sidney?" and "Better be careful, Sidney" and "Do it, Sidney!"</TE>
<TE>   The group also dances at the clubs in Latin-inspired, snaky-arm
ballroom combinations by Christopher Wheeldon, the acclaimed young
resident choreographer of New York City Ballet, in his
none-too-auspicious Broadway debut.</TE>
<TE>   Could the underbelly of the city ever have been this boring? The
show is conscientious about fleshing out the movie's lean and hungry
characters. J.J. doesn't just use Sidney as a loser; the boss likes
and mentors him. J.J. is not just overly protective of his nubile
princess of a sister, played with a bit of Grace Kelly confidence by
Kelli O'Hara. This time, he is more the jealous lover who, in one of
the stronger scenes, drags her around his penthouse living room in a
grotesque waltz and slaps his own face while pleading, "Everybody
wants me except you."</TE>
<TE>   Lithgow is a formidable, wily presence, his expressively bland
face a canvas on which to make mischief. As the commie-baiting
star-maker, he keeps a mean tongue in his cheek. But this J.J.
started in vaudeville, so manipulation is still a bit of a dance. In
this version, he is asked to reprise his old routine by a caller at a
telethon--don't ask. He's fun, but Hamlisch rips off his own "One"
from "Chorus Line."</TE>
<TE>   As Sidney, James proves that his breakthrough performance in "The
Wild Party" was no fluke. Less pretty than Tony Curtis, this Sydney
is a more pathetic loser--hungrier, even more craven, with a smile
too scared to survive. Jack Noseworthy does what he can with Dallas,
the sister's down-market boyfriend, a pianist this time, and a
crooner who looks like Ray Liotta with a James Dean attitude. Stacey

<HD>California EAR Unit Gets Pals Together for a Party</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Twenty years in the new music trenches is no small feat, and the
California EAR Unit--which celebrated its 20th birthday Wednesday at
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art--has not only aged gracefully,
it's also helped create the mold for serious yet fun-loving new music
chamber ensembles internationally.</LD>
<LD>   As noted in the program, the group has left the acronym
intentionally open to interpretation. This night's efforts might
suggest the "Elegant Aural Rebel Unit" or "Emphatic Antics Research
Unit" or ... your suggestion here.</LD>
<LD>   For a group this innately eclectic, one EAR Unit concert in a
given season is never enough to get a grasp of its range and could be
misleading. Wednesday's concert, for one, leaned too heavily on
Minimalist, generally rock-influenced eighth-note parades, without
the usual programmatic depth or balance. But the group may have been
in party mode, a forgivable sin under the circumstances.</LD>
<TE>   This concert was also notably lacking in that EAR Unit
staple--premieres--instead focusing on a nostalgic selection of past
works.</TE>
<TE>   That included James Sellars' "Go" (1997), a rock-ish piece with an
incessant momentum, in which characters of rhythm and tonality never
quite settle. Hints of Stravinsky's "The Rite of Spring" percolate
throughout.</TE>
<TE>   A similar effect marks Frederic Rzewski's 1971 work "Coming
Together," with its pulsating, motoric lines blending in with a
fragmented spoken text (read by clarinetist Marty Walker) from a
particularly moving letter by a prisoner killed in the Attica
uprising.</TE>
<TE>   Julia Wolfe's "Girlfriend," premiered by the EAR Unit two years
ago, remains a fascinating enigma, a mixture of screeching tire
samples and long tones in a melancholic, color-shifting sound fabric.</TE>
<TE>   After intermission, the Unit let the games begin, playing a quirky
dirge on kazoos and marching spasmodically down the aisle and across
a stage adorned with twinkling lights. As a Cage-ian afterthought,
the noted pianist (and former EAR Unit member) Gloria Cheng literally
swept up after them, as Vicki Ray and former member James Rohrig
vocalized text by Kurt Schwitters. Closing the program was John
Bergamo's brief, punchy "Foreign Objects," a vaguely Zappa-esque
chamber rock affair. As a bonus, longtime and now ex-Unit member Art
Jarvinen offered a cameo--a giddy lounge lizard-ish tribute to the
group's longevity. It was reverent and worthy of a toast.</TE>

<LD>Toys R Us Inc., the No. 1 U.S. toy retailer, said its quarterly
profit rose before charges as it raced to close unprofitable stores
and reduce business expenses to offset the effect of sluggish sales
and competition.</LD>
<LD>   The company, which in January announced plans to shut 64 stores
and cut 1,900 jobs, said operating earnings in the fourth quarter
ended Feb. 2 rose 13% to $284 million, or $1.39 a share, from $251
million, or $1.23 a share, a year earlier. Sales were flat at $4.8
billion.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call were expecting
earnings of $1.38 on average.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., the third-largest cruise line, said its
first-quarter earnings would beat analysts' estimates because it has
been selling trips for higher prices than it expected.</LD>
<LD>   Miami-based Royal Caribbean expects earnings of 25 cents to 30
cents a share for the first quarter, the company said. Analysts
expected the company to break even, according to Thomson
Financial/First Call.</LD>
<LD>   Royal Caribbean said its "yield," a measure of pricing in the
cruise industry, fell 7% to 8% in the quarter, better than the 10% to
15% decline the company estimated in January.</LD>
<TE>   Royal Caribbean shares fell 25 cents to $21 on the NYSE before the
forecast was released.</TE>

<LD>A Florida accountant who tried to get actor Wesley Snipes a
$7.36-million tax refund was sued by the government on claims he ran
a tax-refund plot in 32 states.</LD>
<LD>   Douglas P. Rosile, whose license has been revoked by two states,
told clients including Snipes that only income from foreign sources
is subject to U.S. income tax, according to the civil suit filed in
federal court in Tampa, Fla. Rosile tried to get refunds worth more
than $36 million for 188 clients, the suit alleges.</LD>
<LD>   The Internal Revenue Service didn't pay in most cases.</LD>
<TE>   The Justice Department said such arguments are "patently
frivolous" and people who try to avoid paying taxes based on the
claims could face civil and criminal penalties.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Allied Irish Banks fired six executives at its U.S. business after
alleged bogus currency market trades cost Ireland's biggest lender
$691 million. Chief Executive Michael Buckley will keep his job.</LD>
<LD>   The dismissals follow a monthlong investigation by former U.S.
bank regulator Eugene Ludwig into how trader John Rusnak allegedly
racked up the losses without being caught by management at Allied
Irish or its Allfirst Financial Inc. unit.</LD>
<LD>   David Cronin, Allfirst's treasurer, and five other managers at the
Baltimore-based unit were fired. Allfirst Chairman Frank Bramble is
leaving in June; CEO Susan Keating remains in her post.</LD>
<TE>   Rusnak, 37, carried out the alleged fraud over more than four
years, according to the Ludwig report, which was paid for by Allied
Irish. Rusnak made bad bets on the Japanese yen and covered up his
losses by taking steps such as falsifying bank records and documents,
the 57-page report said.</TE>

<HD>Wal-Mart in Pact to Enter Japan</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Eager to add Japan to its global reach, retail giant Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. entered an alliance with Tokyo-based retailer Seiyu with an
option to buy up two-thirds of the company in five years.</LD>
<LD>   "To be known as a true global retailer, we must be in Japan," said
Charles Holley, chief financial officer of Wal-Mart International.
"We view this as a first step in a long-term partnership."</LD>
<LD>   Under the deal, Wal-Mart will buy 6.1% of Seiyu stock for $46
million in May. It has the option to buy up to 66.7% in three stages
over five years for nearly $2 billion.</LD>
<TE>   The arrival in Japan of Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart is the
latest step in its worldwide expansion that includes more than 1,100
stores in countries such as Mexico, China and Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Holley refused to say when Wal-Mart would open its first
large-scale discount store in Japan and stressed that it was too
early to make concrete predictions about Wal-Mart's potential in
Japan. But he was confident the Wal-Mart strategy would work in Japan
because it has done well in other ailing economies where shoppers
look for bargains.</TE>
<TE>   Seiyu is one of Japan's top retailers with group annual revenue of
more than $7.8 billion. It employs about 12,500 people.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart rose 28 cents to $62.27 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Northwest Settles Disabled Bias Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Northwest Airlines agreed to pay as much as $700,000 to settle
charges that the airline discriminated against disabled passengers,
the Department of Transportation said.</LD>
<LD>   The airline also agreed to "cease and desist" from future
violations of department rules that ban discrimination against
disabled passengers, the department said. Northwest could offset part
of the fine by adopting "measures to improve the carrier's services
to the disabled," the department said.</LD>
<LD>   "We're pleased that we resolved the complaint in this manner,"
said Northwest spokeswoman Kathy Peach.</LD>
<TE>   When it brought the case in September, the department said it was
seeking the largest civil penalty ever against a carrier, more than
$3 million.</TE>
<TE>   The department contended that on hundreds of occasions, the
carrier allegedly took a long time getting wheelchairs, left disabled
passengers on aircraft for extended periods of time and left disabled
passengers at the wrong gates.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Eagan, Minn.-based Northwest were down 16 cents to
$19.53 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Apollo Acts to Soothe Officials</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Firm meets with West Hollywood leaders on
Sunset Millennium project after its developer draws ire.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investment firm Apollo Real Estate Advisors will play a greater role
in its troubled Sunset Millennium development in West Hollywood after
its partner and point man, Mark Siffin, drew the ire of community
leaders and became embroiled in a series of costly and embarrassing
setbacks.</LD>
<LD>   Officials from Apollo have met with West Hollywood city officials
in recent weeks in an effort to improve relations and build support
for the $300-million mixed-use project.</LD>
<LD>   In the past, Apollo had let Siffin, a developer, spearhead the
project and act as the public face of Sunset Millennium, which is in
various stages of development along three blocks of Sunset Boulevard
at La Cienega Boulevard.</LD>
<TE>   "Apollo expressed concern about the current morass," said City
Manager Paul Arevalo, who recently met with top Apollo executives for
the first time. "They felt there was a necessity to clear the air and
reestablish themselves in the community."</TE>
<TE>   The company did not say whether a management or ownership change
involving Siffin had or was about to occur, according to Arevalo.</TE>
<TE>   But the fact that Apollo officials have taken the lead in
restoring relations in the community has raised questions about
Siffin's future role.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems what they are saying is that the Apollo people are going
to take over primary responsibility for the project," said West
Hollywood Mayor John Heilman, who supports a change.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from Siffin's company, Maefield Development, and Apollo
were not available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Heilman and other city leaders turned against Sunset Millennium in
recent months after opponents of the project accused Siffin of buying
the support of neighbors with hundreds of thousands of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   City officials also were angered when Siffin reportedly moved to
replace a planned 350-room hotel in the development with housing
without consulting the city.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the West Hollywood City Council reversed itself and
denied Siffin the permit needed to build giant billboards atop Sunset
Millennium. The billboards would have earned the company an estimated
$4.3 million in annual revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Siffin's credibility with the council and the community was
undermined," Heilman said. "It's essential that the city have people
it feels it can trust and work with."</TE>
<TE>   Sunset Millennium includes 200,000 square feet of retail space,
three office towers, including the former Playboy Building, and a
hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Maefield Development has been involved in developing more than 1.5
million square feet of retail space and nearly 4,000 homes and
apartments in California and the Midwest.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Charles Schwab Corp., the biggest discount brokerage, said that
first-quarter profit may fall short of forecasts after trading
slumped anew last month.</LD>
<LD>   Schwab said its clients made an average 140,800 trades a day in
February, down 10% from January and the biggest drop since October.</LD>
<LD>   Even with daily client trades up 19% during the first eight
trading days of March, the company said it probably won't meet the
average analyst estimate of 10 cents a share in the first quarter.</LD>
<TE>   Co-Chief Executive David Pottruck said the "expectation of paying
some level of bonuses" to employees also may keep first-quarter
profit from exceeding the 8 cents earned in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Schwab stock fell 28 cents to $14.52 on the New York Stock
Exchange, and is down 6% this year.</TE>

<BD>Dow Jones</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>TriZetto Group Inc. said Thursday it agreed to a $3.9-million
settlement with former customer Maxicare Health Plans Inc., a
long-troubled health maintenance organization that filed for Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection in May.</LD>
<LD>   Under the settlement agreement, TriZetto will receive $1 million
in cash for services provided in 2001 after Maxicare's bankruptcy
filing, and $2.9 million to cover a reduced level of data-center
operations and software support in 2002.</LD>
<LD>   Newport Beach-based TriZetto provides computer software and
services to the health-care industry. In 2000, TriZetto received a
seven-year contract worth more than $55 million from Maxicare. A
TriZetto spokeswoman said Maxicare was one of its top customers in
2000, accounting for about 5% of the company's total revenue.</LD>
<TE>   For 2001, TriZetto lost $61.2 million, or $1.53 a share, on
revenue of $218.2 million.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>CKE Restaurants Inc. narrowed its loss in its fiscal fourth quarter
and posted strong sales growth at restaurants open at least one year,
a key industry measure.</LD>
<LD>   The company's stock, which has nearly tripled in the last 52
weeks, fell 20 cents to $9.15 on the NYSE.</LD>
<LD>   The operator of Carl's Jr. and Hardee's hamburger restaurants
reported a net loss of $8.3million, or 16 cents a share, including
special items, compared with a net loss of $148.3million, or $2.94, a
year earlier.</LD>
<TE>   Results for the latest period include a $6-million charge from a
franchisee's closure of 20 Hardee's restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   CKE said it had an operating profit of $1million in the fourth
quarter ended Jan. 28.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue fell 14% to $301 million as the company shuttered
under-performing restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   But sales at Hardee's outlets open at least one year jumped 6.4%,
and those at Carl's Jr. increased 4.3%.</TE>
<TE>   Improved restaurant operations, the introduction of products such
as chicken breast strips and CKE's promotion of a $6 burger--a
premium hamburger that actually sells for $3.95--have helped put CKE
"on the right path," said Mary Gilbert, an analyst at Imperial
Capital in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   CKE has moved its headquarters from Anaheim to Santa Barbara,
where Chief Executive Andrew F. Puzder and Chairman William P. Foley
live.</TE>

<LD>Korn/Ferry International, the largest executive-search firm, reported

<LD>   The Los Angeles-based company said it lost $7.3 million, or 19

period.</LD>
<TE>   Sales plunged 41% to $93.3 million as firms hired fewer executives

<HD>Aspirin Can't Cure Bayer's Aches</HD>
<DH>The German drug maker works to overcome slumping sales and
problems with two key products.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LEVERKUSEN, Germany</DL>
<LD>Aspirin made Bayer famous more than a century ago, and its Cipro
remedy against anthrax cast it in the limelight again last year, but
pharmaceuticals caused the German conglomerate's worst annual
performance in a decade.</LD>
<LD>   Walloped by the summer recall of its most promising product, the
Baycol cholesterol- lowering pills bought by 6 million consumers
worldwide, Germany's biggest drug maker saw share values tumble about
36% in the last year, and stock dividends have been cut from $1.40 to
90 cents.</LD>
<LD>   In a confirmation of long- expected bad news for shareholders,
Bayer Chief Executive Manfred Schneider on Wednesday called last
year's numbers "sobering."</LD>
<TE>   He promised a quick turnaround and higher net income this year,
primarily through divesting non-core assets and through cost
reductions in all four corporate divisions.</TE>
<TE>   Bayer was hit in 2001 with a series of blows, notably a U.S. probe
into the purity of its Kogenate treatment for hemophiliacs and
slumping sales in its polymer and chemicals divisions inflicted by
the global recession. Even the late-year surge in demand for Cipro,
its best-selling pharmaceuticals product, failed to save the sector
from a catastrophic bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   Bayer was forced to pull Lipobay, marketed in the United States as
Baycol, when it was linked to muscle deterioration and the deaths of
at least 100 users. The company faces a bevy of lawsuits and is
effectively shut out of the lucrative cholesterol treatment market.
The Baycol withdrawal alone depressed sales by more than $600 million
last year--the amount the company lost in net sales across the board.</TE>
<TE>   Resistant to industry calls that it spin off its pharmaceuticals
or merge them with a bigger global player, Bayer executives have
chosen instead to undertake the most extensive corporate
restructuring in a company history stretching back to the mid-19th
century.</TE>
<TE>   Schneider and Chief Financial Officer Werner Wenning, who will
become CEO when Schneider retires next month, announced in December
that Bayer would be transformed into four independent
companies--health care, chemicals, polymers and crop science--under
one management-holding umbrella by July 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The reorganization is considered "the top priority for us at the
moment," Schneider told journalists at a news conference to disclose
2001 results. The company has 117,000 worldwide jobs, including
23,000 in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Not all the company's activities were in the doldrums last year.
Executives say they expect approval from European antitrust
authorities within a few weeks of the company's $6.3-billion
acquisition of Aventis CropScience, which would give Bayer a lead in
that market. Analysts have speculated, however, that Bayer may have
to pacify regulators by selling off or licensing certain products
where it has more than a 40% market share.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts have been urging Bayer for two years to divest itself of
the pharmaceuticals business or find a partner with deep pockets.</TE>
<TE>   "Fund managers would like to see them sell the pharmaceuticals
business," said Martin Roediger, an analyst with DG Bank in
Frankfurt, while conceding that the company seems wedded to its
traditional pursuit despite having fallen to 15th place in the highly
competitive global drugs market.</TE>
<TE>   Schneider has steadfastly refused to cede control of the division
and the Bayer name that is synonymous with its most famous invention:
aspirin. Schneider repeated Wednesday that his company is open to new
"partnerships and collaborations" but that the Bayer brand name and
cross logo would be retained in any new venture, as would the aspirin
founder's control of any emerging hybrid.</TE>
<TE>   The CEO also said Bayer is taking the innovative step of
empowering rival SmithKlineGlaxo to market its new impotence
treatment, Nuviva, to challenge Viagra.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't feel we have the marketing potential worldwide," Bayer's
international communications chief, Thomas Reinert, said in a recent
interview at company headquarters in Leverkusen.</TE>
<TE>   Bayer listed itself on the New York Stock Exchange in late January
in a move aimed at gaining access to the world's biggest capital
market, Reinert said. Bayer shares lost value last year in the wake
of the twin pharmaceuticals disasters with Baycol and Kogenate, as
well as plummeting sales in polymers and chemicals used extensively
in the auto-making and construction industries, which have been
especially hard-hit by the global recession.</TE>
<TE>   Schneider insisted that the problems with Kogenate are "almost
entirely solved."</TE>
<TE>   "Our objective is to get 80% of our 2000 sales volume back this
year," North American communications chief Michael Preuss said of
Kogenate, which was being produced at Bayer's facility in Berkeley
before a U.S. probe into the manufacturing process shut it down.
Bayer had sales of $500million of the hemophilia treatment in 2000
but saw its turnover drop to virtually nil last year.</TE>
<TE>   Bayer's performance would have been even more devastating last
year if not for sales of Cipro to a frantic U.S. public trying to
gird itself against the spread of anthrax.</TE>
<TE>   Although Bayer was eventually pressured by U.S. officials to lower
its per-tablet price for Cipro from $1.77 to 95 cents, it still made
a handsome profit.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't lose money on Cipro, but it's not justified to speak of
windfall profits," Reinert said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Bayer's economic problems are daunting, the company's
troubles don't stop at the bottom line. As an active manufacturer in
Third World countries with little or no environmental protections,
Bayer has amassed a global network of critics, including Ralph Nader
and the vocal watchdog agency in neighboring Cologne, the Coalition
Against Bayer Dangers.</TE>
<TE>   "Few companies in the world have developed such a bad reputation
as Bayer, yet they seem oblivious to criticism or public pressure.
Their usual reaction is to sue their accusers rather than address the
problems," said the coalition's spokesman, Phillip Mimkes.</TE>
<TE>   He recalls that Bayer was one of the last German companies to be
pressed into contributing to a $5-billion industry-government fund to
compensate World War II-era slave laborers, although the company was
an eager beneficiary of conscripted workers.</TE>
<TE>   Nader's Multinational Monitor in January ranked Bayer one of the
world's 10 worst companies, based on its environmental and trade
policies, an accusation Reinert described as frivolous and unfounded.</TE>

<LD>Former "NYPD Blue" actress turned news anchor Andrea Thompson quit
CNN Headline News on Thursday, saying she needed to make changes in
her professional life.</LD>
<LD>   Thompson's hiring in August as part of the network's make-over
prompted criticism that it was emphasizing entertainment values over
news credentials; Thompson had only minimal news experience at a New
Mexico TV station. Headline News, owned by AOL Time Warner Inc., also
was put on the defensive when it was revealed that nude pictures of
the actress were circulating on the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   CNN executives praised Thompson's work. A CNN insider said that
Thompson hadn't been happy with her progress as an anchor and that
even though CNN was willing to help her develop, she decided to
leave.</LD>

<HD>Rise in Inventories Offers Further Proof of Rebound</HD>
<DH>Economy: Increase is the first in a year. Rate of initial
jobless benefit claims remains flat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. business inventories rose in January for the first time in a
year and jobless benefit claims declined for the fifth week in the
last six, more signs the economy is rebounding from recession.</LD>
<LD>   Inventories overall rose 0.2% for the month following a 0.5%
December decline, the Commerce Department said. Meanwhile, combined
sales at retailers, manufacturers and wholesalers climbed 1.1% in
January, giving companies an incentive to boost production to further
rebuild stocks.</LD>
<LD>   "Those emptied shelves are getting replenished and that bodes well
for manufacturers and the economy," said Richard Yamarone, chief
economist at Argus Research Corp. in New York. As production picks
up, manufacturers won't be as quick to fire workers, he said.</LD>
<TE>   The number of people filing new claims for unemployment benefits
fell by 3,000 to 377,000 last week, Labor Department statistics
showed. The four-week moving average for jobless claims, a more
reliable measure because it irons out weekly gyrations, edged up
slightly to 374,750 from 373,750 a week earlier but remained
substantially below levels seen earlier in the year.</TE>
<TE>   Stockpiles at manufacturers, which account for about 40% of the
inventories report, fell 0.6% in January, while factory sales jumped
2% for the month as customers ordered more goods. Factory inventories
had fallen 0.9% in December.</TE>
<TE>   At the wholesale level, inventories were down 0.2% in January as
sales rose 1.2%. Inventories had fallen 0.5% in December.</TE>
<TE>   The increase in total inventories in January occurred at the
retail level: Inventories in that sector jumped 1.4% in the month,
while sales eased 0.1%. Retail inventories had inched up 0.1% in
December.</TE>
<TE>   Stockpiles at auto dealers increased in January as sales declined.
Inventories at clothing stores and department and other general
merchandise stores also rose.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, the Commerce Department said the U.S. current account
deficit, the broadest measure of the nation's trade because it
includes investments, widened during the final three months of 2001
to $98.8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   That was up slightly from $98.5billion in the third quarter and
reflected smaller gains on services such as travel and insurance as
well as fewer exports to weakened global markets as last year ended.
But for the full year 2001, the current account gap narrowed for the
first time in six years, to $417.4billion from $444.7billion in 2000.</TE>

<HD>Fiber Optek Eyeing Global</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Closely held developer of networks says it is in
talks with an institutional lender over potential bid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fiber Optek Interconnect Corp., a closely held telecommunications
company with $8 million in annual sales, said it may bid for Global
Crossing Ltd., which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization
Jan. 28.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Pascazi, president of the Wappingers Falls, N.Y., company,
wouldn't say how his firm would raise the more than $750million it
probably would need.</LD>
<LD>   Global Crossing, which is talking to about 40 parties about
potential bids for its fiber-optic network assets, declined to
comment.</LD>
<TE>   Fiber Optek is in discussions with "a leading institutional
lender" about potential financing for a deal, the company said in a
statement. Pascazi said he and Fiber Optek owned Global Crossing
stock, though he wouldn't disclose how many shares.</TE>
<TE>   "They are up against some pretty well-known private equity players
with track records, so I'd say they have an outside chance at best,"
said Richard Barnett, director of equities at City National Bank,
which doesn't own Global Crossing shares.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing already has agreed to sell a 79% stake to
Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. and Singapore Technologies Telemedia for $750
million. Creditors, which are owed $12.4 billion, have said the price
is too low. Platinum Equity and Gores Technology Group, two Los
Angeles technology turnaround firms, and San Francisco-based Texas
Pacific Group also are considering bids.</TE>
<TE>   IDT Corp., a U.S. long-distance telephone and Internet service
provider, said in January it was interested in buying the U.S. assets
Global Crossing acquired in 1999 from Frontier Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Fiber Optek, in business since 1984, develops and installs
telecommunications networks. The company has 20 employees.</TE>
<TE>   Creditors must weigh any new bid, and a Bankruptcy Court in New
York would have to approve a sale. Hutchison will decide whether to
add to its bid after the April 23 deadline for bids proposed by
Global Crossing.</TE>

<HD>2 Funds Oppose HP-Compaq Merger</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pension funds for California teachers and Ohio public workers said
Thursday that they planned to vote against Hewlett-Packard Co.'s
proposal to buy Compaq Computer Corp. for $21 billion, saying the
merger would threaten profitability.</LD>
<LD>   The California State Teachers' Retirement System will vote its
0.29% stake against the transaction, and the Public Employees
Retirement System of Ohio will vote no with its 0.21% stake.</LD>
<LD>   Later in the day, Banc One Investment Advisors said it would vote
its 0.26% stake for the deal, and the Ohio teachers pension fund
pledged to vote yes with its 0.18%, HP spokeswoman Rebeca Robboy told
Associated Press.</LD>
<TE>   Hewlett-Packard investors are declaring their intentions before
Tuesday's vote on what would be the biggest computer industry
combination.</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett-Packard Chief Executive Carly Fiorina says the bigger
company would boost profit by selling more services and
more-profitable server computers.</TE>
<TE>   Director Walter Hewlett is waging a proxy fight to defeat the
proposal, saying that the company his father co-founded would fare
better alone.</TE>
<TE>   "The integration risk seems too great to be overcome in a
transaction this large and complex," the California organization, the
third-largest U.S. pension fund, said in a statement. The combination
"would dilute Hewlett-Packard's position in its profitable printer
and imaging unit," said the California teachers fund, which has
assets totaling $100 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Investors holding 21% of the company's stock have said they oppose
the transaction publicly, and 8.3% favor it.</TE>
<TE>   On the New York Stock Exchange, Hewlett-Packard shares fell 71
cents to $19.40 and Compaq fell 30 cents to $10.70. Houston-based
Compaq's stock trades at 13% less than Hewlett-Packard's offer price.</TE>
<TE>   The California teachers fund, based in Sacramento, also plans to
oppose the merger with its 0.3% stake in Compaq in a separate vote of
that company's investors.</TE>
<TE>   The Ohio pension fund, with assets of $54 billion, said that the
acquisition would dilute the printing business by increasing sales of
low-profit personal computers.</TE>
<TE>   The Columbus, Ohio-based fund owns a 0.2% stake of Compaq.</TE>

<LD>Stocks ended mostly higher Thursday on the latest upbeat economic
news. But another surge in long-term Treasury bond yields may have
weighed on key share indexes.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average eked out a 15.29-point, or 0.2%,
gain to 10,517.14, after sliding 130 points Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite closed with a modest

straight decline.</LD>
<TE>   But rising stocks outnumbered losers by 20 to 16 on Nasdaq and 17
to 14 on the New York Stock Exchange in moderate trading.</TE>
<TE>   The government's reports that businesses are rebuilding their
inventories and that jobless benefits claims continue to stabilize at
sharply lower levels than at the end of last year supported share
prices, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "The theme here is that the economic recovery is taking hold,"
said John C. Forelli, portfolio manager for Independence Investment
in Boston. "Everyone is trying to guess the pace of the recovery and
which sectors will do best."</TE>
<TE>   But many bond traders are figuring that economic recovery
inevitably will mean higher interest rates: Traders bid the yield on
the 10-year Treasury note to 5.41% on Thursday, up from 5.29%
Wednesday and the highest since June.</TE>
<TE>   The yield on the two-year T-note jumped to 3.59% from 3.46% on
Wednesday. It was 3.03% at the end of last year.</TE>
<TE>   The bond market was hurt in part Thursday by brokerage Goldman
Sachs &amp; Co.'s report that Laurence Meyer, a former Federal Reserve
governor, told the firm he expects the central bank to raise its
benchmark short-term interest rate to 3% by year-end and to 4.75% by
late 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed's rate now is 1.75%. Fed policymakers meet Tuesday and are
expected to leave the rate unchanged. But they also are expected to
warn that they could tighten credit later this year as the economy
revives.</TE>
<TE>   Some investors were dumping Treasury issues Thursday to buy
higher-yielding corporate bonds, including the $11-billion bond
offering sold Wednesday by GE Capital, traders said.</TE>
<TE>   In commodity trading oil prices jumped again, with the near-term
crude contract in New York up 40 cents to $24.56 a barrel, the
highest price in nearly six months.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. refineries are expected to soon increase production of
gasoline and other fuels after slowing operating rates to a two-year
low last week, Bloomberg News reported.</TE>
<TE>   On Wall Street, traders said today's session could bring more
volatility because of the "triple-witching" expiration of futures and
options contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Among Thursday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Gains in some "old-economy" stocks helped the Dow as investors
bet on an economic rebound. Eastman Kodak rose $1.35 to $32.35 after
reaffirming its first-quarter and full-year earnings outlook. Other
winners included Dupont, up 59 cents to $47.59; International Paper,
up 95 cents to $44.27; and Caterpillar, up $1.17 to $58.66.</TE>
<TE>   * Shares of some consumer products giants also lured buyers. Avon
Products rose 53 cents to $53.52. Nike surged $2.18 to $62.76, a
52-week high.</TE>
<TE>   * Many tech leaders continued to weaken after rallying earlier
this month. Software giant Oracle slid 45 cents to $13.44 in advance
of its earnings report, issued after the market closed. The company,
in the report, cut profit estimates for the current quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Intel dropped 37 cents to $30.97, and Adobe Systems fell 94 cents
to $36.59. Lucent Technologies continued to sink, falling 9 cents to
$4.83, a new all-time low.</TE>

<DH>Tech: Software maker says it does not expect spending to
improve in the current quarter.</DH>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oracle Corp., the world's second-biggest software maker, said
Thursday its fiscal third-quarter net earnings fell from a year ago,
and that the tech spending environment remains weak.</LD>
<LD>   The Redwood City, Calif., firm posted net income of $508 million,
or 9 cents a share in the quarter ended Feb. 28, compared with $583
million, or 10 cents, in the year-ago quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Sales dropped to $2.2 billion from $2.7 billion a year earlier.</LD>
<TE>   The results were in line with expectations the firm revised March
1, when it warned that weak sales in Asia would depress results.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle also said earnings in the current quarter will be 1 to 2
cents short of the 15 cents a share earned a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very sluggish and doesn't seem yet to be showing signs of
recovery," Oracle Chief Financial Officer Jeff Henley said in
reference to tech spending.</TE>
<TE>   The report was released after regular stock trading ended. Oracle
shares fell 45 cents to $13.44 on Nasdaq, then dipped to $13.17 in
after-hours trading.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The group that oversees the Internet's domain-name system said
individual users should have a voice in the organization but declined
to open itself up to global elections.</LD>
<LD>   The Internet Corp. for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN, said
the 500 million people who use the Internet should be given a formal
role in helping oversee the system that guides e-mail and Web
browsers around cyberspace.</LD>
<LD>   But ICANN would not approve a new round of elections in November,
effectively killing any direct public role for the time being and
putting the fate of nine of its 19 board seats in doubt.</LD>
<TE>   "ICANN is not a global democracy," said M. Stuart Lynn, the
organization's president, in a conference call with reporters.</TE>
<TE>   ICANN declined to say how it would balance the interests of
Internet users with those of other groups, such as businesses and
technical experts. Instead, the board told a committee to come up
with a specific plan for reform by the end of May.</TE>

<HD>Panel Accuses Enron's Lawyers of a Cover-Up</HD>
<DH>Probe: House committee members question the limited
investigation by Vinson &amp; Elkins attorneys.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. lawmakers accused Enron Corp.'s lawyers Thursday of covering up
an employee's allegations that the world's largest energy trader hid
debt and losses in partnerships before its financial collapse last
year.</LD>
<LD>   Members of a congressional panel investigating the largest
corporate bankruptcy in U.S. history questioned why Enron limited the
lawyers' inquiry into Vice President Sherron S. Watkins' allegations
that many transactions were improper and benefited Chief Financial
Officer Andrew S. Fastow.</LD>
<LD>   They asked why Enron told its lawyers at Vinson &amp; Elkins not to
examine the transactions or auditor Andersen's accounting decisions.</LD>
<TE>   "In what ways would your preliminary investigation look different
than a cover-up?" asked Rep. James C. Greenwood, a Pennsylvania
Republican who heads the House oversight and investigations
subcommittee.</TE>
<TE>   "My integrity is not for sale," former Enron general counsel James
V. Derrick Jr. said. "I wouldn't participate in a cover-up."</TE>
<TE>   Joseph C. Dilg, Vinson &amp; Elkins' managing partner, acknowledged
that the law firm didn't interview investment bankers Watkins
identified who could support allegations that Fastow was pressuring
Deutsche Bank, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and other firms to help underwrite
the partnerships he managed.</TE>
<TE>   Dilg said the matter was dropped when Fastow denied allegations
that he threatened to cut investment banks out of future Enron
business if they didn't invest in the partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   "Didn't that raise any red flags with you?" Greenwood asked. Dilg
said the firm didn't interview people outside Enron because the
August resignation of Enron President Jeffrey K. Skilling had caused
"a great deal of speculation in the market."</TE>
<TE>   "We were trying to develop the facts that we could by talking with
people inside the company so as not to create lots of speculation and
rumors," Dilg said.</TE>
<TE>   In other developments, a House committee passed legislation
Thursday to tighten pension laws, the first action on any of the
bills being considered to prevent the kind of problems brought to
light by Enron's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   The bill, approved 36 to 2 by the House Ways and Means Committee,
adopts several principles outlined by President Bush, such as
requiring notice of 30 days to participants in 401(k) plans to
temporarily suspend account activity and mandating that participants
get quarterly account statements instead of yearly.</TE>
<TE>   The bill imposes an excise tax penalty of $100 per person for
failing to comply with the notice requirements. The maximum would be
$500,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   The pension bill probably will be merged with other proposals
awaiting action in other House committees, and the House could
consider a final version next month.</TE>

<TE>   Bloomberg News and Associated Press were used in compiling this
report.</TE>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The group that sets U.S. accounting rules said Thursday it wants to
shrink its board and make it easier for changes to be passed.</LD>
<LD>   The Financial Accounting Standards Board, criticized for being
slow to change rules that allowed Enron Corp. to hide debt in
off-balance-sheet partnerships, proposed dropping to five members
from seven and narrowing the vote needed to pass rule changes to
three to two from five to two.</LD>
<LD>   "They've decided to put their foot on the accelerator," said
Dennis Beresford, a University of Georgia accounting professor. "In
the past, the board has taken too long to get things done."</LD>
<TE>   FASB also proposed shortening the public comment period on rule
changes. That period now can run up to 90 days. The board asked for
comment on the changes to its own structure within 30 days.</TE>
<TE>   But some experts said FASB still faced the threat of excessive
outside interference. "You can tinker with the voting, you can tinker
with the number of members on the board, but if you still get
political interference, you're still going to have a resistance to
change," said William Shenkir, former dean of the University of
Virginia's McIntire School of Commerce.</TE>

<HD>Broadband Firms Can Close Their Networks</HD>

<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a bid to accelerate the roll-out of high-speed Internet service,
federal regulators Thursday permanently exempted cable Internet
companies from a federal law that requires telecommunications
carriers to open their networks to rivals.</LD>
<LD>   The industry had been gripped with uncertainty about how
high-speed cable Internet service, or broadband, might be regulated
by the government after the Federal Trade Commission forced AOL Time
Warner Inc. to open its cable lines to at least three independent
Internet service providers as part of a December 2000 merger consent
decree.</LD>
<LD>   But the Federal Communications Commission voted 3 to 1 Thursday
not to place other cable operators under a similar requirement.
Instead, it voted to classify cable broadband as an unregulated
"information service," leaving cable operators free to close their
networks to independent Internet service providers such as
Atlanta-based EarthLink Inc. and Princeton, N.J.-based RCN Corp.</LD>
<TE>   The decision will "promote our goal of fostering a minimal
regulatory environment that promotes investment and innovation in
this competitive market," said FCC Commissioner Kathleen Abernathy, a
Republican.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's vote represents the latest move by FCC Chairman Michael
K. Powell, also a Republican, to rollback federal oversight of the
financially troubled telecommunications industry.</TE>
<TE>   The vote was the clearest sign yet that Powell does not intend to
propose new ground rules to accelerate the roll-out of broadband--a
critical technology that experts say could provide thousands of new
jobs and stimulate the nation's economy.</TE>
<TE>   Cable firms, as well as the Bell telephone companies--which are
seeking a similar line-sharing exemption from Congress and the
FCC--supported the decision.</TE>
<TE>   But consumer groups, lawmakers and Internet service providers
blasted the ruling, saying it favors cable monopolies over upstarts
and will foster higher prices and less competition for broadband,
which the FCC defines as any connection that transmits data at 200
kilobits per second, four times faster than a standard dial-up modem.</TE>
<TE>   "This decision simply defies common sense and logic," said Rep.
Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), ranking member of the House
telecommunications subcommittee. "For cable consumers, the FCC
actions will likely mean fewer choices and higher prices."</TE>
<TE>   Some representatives of independent Internet service providers
praised the FCC ruling, saying it lifts a cloud of regulatory
uncertainty and will encourage cable operators to partner with more
experienced ISPs, whose help cable firms will need to market
broadband to the 90% of U.S. households that don't have the service.</TE>
<TE>   "Reclassifying broadband as an information service is the correct
decision," said David McClure, president of the U.S. Internet
Industry Assn., a Washington trade group representing 300 ISPs.
"Granted, we have seen a move by some cable companies to shield their
networks from competition. But they can't deploy broadband quick
enough all by themselves. They are going to need to fill their
networks with other Internet service providers."</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts agreed with that assessment.</TE>
<TE>   "Regulation generally slows down deployment of new technology,"
said Blair Levin, a former chief of staff at the FCC during the
Clinton administration and now a technology analyst for the
investment firm Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "The cable operators have figured out that having multiple ISPs
helps bring traffic on their network, and they make money when there
is traffic on their network," Levin added.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike telephone companies, cable operators have never been
legally required to open up their networks to rivals. They must share
their cable lines only when ordered to do so by the government.</TE>
<TE>   But in recent months, some cable operators have struck deals to
carry independent ISPs on their systems, along with video channels
such as MTV and CNN and even cable telephone service. Over the last
six years, cable operators have spent $55 billion to upgrade their
systems and become "one-stop shops" for consumer communications
services.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T Corp., which operates the nation's largest cable network,
announced a line-sharing deal this week with EarthLink, for instance.
And a number of smaller cable operators and ISPs have reached similar
accords.</TE>
<TE>   Cable companies control about 70% of the nation's broadband
subscribers, mostly residential users who have cable TV service. The
National Cable Television Assn. said cable carriers serve about 7.2
million high-speed users, compared with about 5 million for phone
companies.</TE>
<TE>   However, frustration with the rate of deployment of broadband
technology--especially in costly-to-wire rural areas--has been
growing in Washington. In a move that mimicked the FCC, for instance,
the House last month voted overwhelmingly for a measure that would
free the regional Bell telephone companies from having to share their
high-speed networks with rivals.</TE>
<TE>   The bill, however, faces an uphill battle in the Senate where a
bipartisan group of lawmakers oppose it, fearing that the Bells are
seeking to dominate broadband the way they dominate local phone
service.</TE>
<TE>   The FCC's lone Democrat, Commissioner Michael Copps, cast the
dissenting vote Thursday. He said the agency should have delayed its
vote until it could determine whether additional rules were needed to
ensure competition in cable broadband. The FCC is expected to
undertake such a inquiry in the coming weeks, but Copps said it may
be too late by then.</TE>
<TE>   "Some access requirement is necessary in order to ensure that some
consumers have choices of" Internet providers, Copps said. "With so
much at stake I would have hoped for a little more modesty and
measured pace on our part."</TE>

<HD>Disney Looking for Boost in Paris</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: New park with movie studio theme is expected
to build on strong European business.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walt Disney Co., which transformed the near-bankrupt Disneyland Paris
into Europe's most visited tourist attraction, adds some Hollywood
glitz to its French resort with the opening Saturday of a theme park
modeled on its studio tour in Orlando, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   The 50-acre park, called Walt Disney Studios, is billed as a
tribute to American and European cinema and is next to Disneyland
Paris. The $530-million venture includes a studio tram tour with
behind-the-scene views of movies, a special-effects show based on the
movie "Armageddon" and a roller coaster.</LD>
<LD>   Walt Disney Studios is expected to boost Disneyland Paris' overall
attendance from about 12 million to 16 million visitors annually. The
park is Disney's 10th and the third to open in 18 months, after Tokyo
DisneySea in Japan and the struggling California Adventure in
Anaheim. Disney also is building a theme park in Hong Kong, set to
open by 2006.</LD>
<TE>   "It shows the strength of our business in Europe, our confidence
in Europe and our ability to grow," said Paul Pressler, chairman of
Walt Disney Parks &amp; Resorts. "Cinema is something that is a global
phenomenon. It speaks to our roots."</TE>
<TE>   As the domestic market matures, Disney and other theme park
companies are tapping overseas locales, especially in Europe, where
rising disposable incomes and changing vacation habits are creating
strong demand for American-style amusement parks, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Walt Disney Studios is among four theme parks that will open in
Europe by 2003, including a Legoland outside Munich, Germany, and a
Warner Bros. park Six Flags is building south of Madrid. Rival
Universal Studios, which is expanding its theme park resort near
Barcelona, Spain, also is exploring sites for a theme park in
Germany.</TE>
<TE>   "Paris is a market with 20 million residents and almost the same
amount of tourists," said John Robinett, a Los Angeles-based leisure
industry consultant. "It's a very, very strong market. Disneyland has
benefited from that, and I think this new park will as well."</TE>
<TE>   Disney has invested $90 million in the Euro Disney project, in
which it has a 39% equity stake.</TE>
<TE>   The park's opening won't have much effect on Disney's bottom line,
which has been hurt by a decline in tourism and television
advertising revenue. The company gets only about $28 million a year
in management and royalty fees (5% to 10% of sales) from Disneyland
Paris, which is managed through Disney subsidiary Euro Disney.</TE>
<TE>   Adding a second gate in Paris helps Disney expand its brand in
Europe and fits a longer-term strategy of building resort
destinations modeled on Walt Disney World in Orlando, which attracts
visitors for several days. Walt Disney Studios is expected to
increase the average length of stay from two to three nights at
Disneyland Paris, executives said.</TE>
<TE>   Disneyland Paris, formerly Euro Disney, has come a long way since
the early 1990s, when the project was hit with the recession, huge
building costs, a glut of hotel rooms and derision from French
critics who called it a "cultural Chernobyl."</TE>
<TE>   Under a rescue plan, Disney restructured its $3-billion debt,
reduced its equity and postponed royalty and management fees for
several years. Park officials also cut ticket prices and introduced
alcoholic drinks and a broader range of food concessions and
attractions. The strategy worked, and by 1995 Euro Disney had
recorded its first annual operating profit.</TE>
<TE>   "The first park we built during a boom, and a year after it opened
we hit a huge recession," Pressler said. "With [Walt Disney Studios],
we know what we're heading into, and we're only hoping for upside."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike 1992, Disney won't be stuck with a large amount of empty
hotel rooms, Pressler said. Disney isn't opening any hotel rooms,
though third parties are developing three hotels in the resort area
that will increase the total number of rooms from 5,800 to 6,900 in
the next year.</TE>
<TE>   Travel disruptions caused by Sept. 11, which have brought sharp
declines in attendance at Walt Disney World and Disneyland, so far
have had little effect on Disneyland Paris and may even have helped
the resort. "We suspect that in both Tokyo and Paris, people are
choosing to stay closer to home and are not making trips to the
U.S.," Pressler said.</TE>
<TE>   Disneyland Paris drew 12.2 million visitors last year, up 2% from
a year ago. Euro Disney Chairman Jay Rasulo has said attendance was
holding up well despite the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. (Euro
Disney's profit fell 21% to $27 million last year, mostly due to park
opening costs.)</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, overall attendance at Disney's flagship resort Walt
Disney World, which heavily depends on international visitors,
remains 10% to 15% below last year's levels. Despite an improvement
in short-term vacation bookings, it's too early to predict when U.S.
theme parks will recover, Pressler said.</TE>
<TE>   But Disneyland Paris "is doing very well, better than anyone
expected," said Sobani Warner, an analyst with Williams Capital Group
in New York.</TE>
<TE>   In developing its newest park, Disney has been mindful not to
repeat past mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   The changes include involving more locals and fewer expatriates in
developing the park and paying greater heed to Europe's diverse
languages and cultures. Catering to European culinary tastes, such as
serving five types of sausages, was especially important.</TE>
<TE>   "We've learned a lot of lessons," Pressler said.</TE>

<HD>Delta Stops Paying Agent Commissions</HD>
<DH>Airlines: Other carriers are expected to do the same,
delivering major financial setback to travel-booking industry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ and BONNIE HARRIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In perhaps the biggest blow to travel agents since the airlines were
deregulated 24 years ago, Delta Air Lines said Thursday that it had
stopped paying commissions to agents booking its domestic
flights--and other airlines are expected to quickly follow suit.</LD>
<LD>   Delta, citing its $1-billion loss last year and the growth of
Internet ticketing sites, scrapped commissions for tickets sold in
the U.S. and Canada. The nation's third-largest airline, Delta said
it would keep paying commissions on tickets bought overseas and as
incentive bonuses to select agencies.</LD>
<LD>   "In this extremely difficult financial environment, the company
must pursue all opportunities to reduce costs," said Delta, which
last year paid $540 million in commissions, or 3.5% of its overall
spending--about normal for the industry, which paid more than $3.5
billion in commissions last year.</LD>
<TE>   Delta's action is the boldest move yet in the industry's
seven-year effort to reduce ticket distribution costs. Most carriers,
which once paid agents a percentage of the ticket price, now pay them
only a maximum of $10 for a one-way domestic booking and $20 for a
round trip.</TE>
<TE>   The commission cuts have infuriated the travel-agent industry, led
to lawsuits and public protests by agents nationwide, sharply thinned
the industry's ranks and forced surviving agencies to charge their
own fees for reservations. Well before the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks, hundreds of bricks-and-mortar travel agencies were closing
every month. The industry's trade group, the American Society of
Travel Agents, currently has 26,000 member firms.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a sad, sad day," said Emma Johnson, an agent at Travel
World in Tustin.</TE>
<TE>   ASTA President Richard Copland called Delta's action
"anti-consumer" because it will force travelers to pay agents higher
fees for bookings. Despite the Internet's growing use as a
reservations tool, about 75% of passengers still use agents, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Higher agents' fees also mean businesses face "an increase in
direct travel costs to their companies" at a time when business
travelers already are complaining of higher fares, the National
Business Travel Assn., a trade group, said in a statement. Delta's
move "changes the foundation of all travel purchasing," it said.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, "I would suspect most [airlines] would" match Delta's
commission ban soon, said Jon Ash, managing director of Global
Aviation Associates, a Washington consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   "The [ticketing] environment is now so different," with the
airlines increasingly relying on less costly means of booking
passengers, namely Web sites run by the airlines themselves and by
outside firms such as Orbitz and Hotwire, Ash said. Other major
airlines, including AMR Corp.'s American and UAL Corp.'s United, said
they were studying Delta's move or had no immediate comment.</TE>
<TE>   A spot check Thursday showed the agencies' frustration depended
mostly on their size. At Johnson's two-person shop in Tustin, there
was talk of raising its transaction fee from the current $20 per
ticket. And although Johnson vowed to avoid booking Delta flights as
a protest, she admitted it would do no good once the other airlines
end commissions too.</TE>
<TE>   "There's really nothing we can do," she said. "Our fees are going
to have to go up or we're going to have to close the door."</TE>
<TE>   But at Montrose Travel, General Manager Rhonda Holguin said she
expected that her firm's high volume would still be rewarded by
Atlanta-based Delta. Montrose Travel has 138 agents and air travel
accounts for about 65% of its business. "We knew this was coming,"
Holguin said. "We don't blame all of our problems on the airlines. We
adapt."</TE>
<TE>   Delta launched the trend toward lower commissions in early 1995,
when it dropped the then-traditional 10% booking commission for
domestic flights and capped how much it would pay agents. Other
airlines followed and that cap was repeatedly lowered over the next
several years.</TE>
<TE>   The airlines' initial cuts were met with a class-action lawsuit by
travel agents, which alleged that the airlines conspired by setting
the caps at artificially low levels in violation of antitrust laws.
Several big carriers, which denied any wrongdoing, paid a combined
$87 million in 1996 to settle the claims.</TE>
<TE>   Delta's stock closed Thursday at $35.33 a share, down 42 cents, on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Andersen Employees Fear Fallout</HD>
<DH>Indictment: Many already are seeking employment elsewhere
as uncertainty about the firm's future mounts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RALPH FRAMMOLINO and LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Employees of Andersen reacted with fear, frustration and fury
Thursday over the criminal indictment of their firm, once considered
the conscience of the accounting industry.</LD>
<LD>   The indictment, which alleges that the firm obstructed justice by
shredding tons of Enron Corp. documents, could exacerbate an exodus
of Andersen employees and threatens the retirements of the accounting
firm's partners.</LD>
<LD>   In Los Angeles-area offices and at the Chicago headquarters,
employees took exception to what they characterized as the
government's exaggerated condemnation of a work force that has
labored under great strain. Some knocked their own top management for
not keeping them informed about recent developments, such as
Andersen's unsuccessful attempt to find a corporate suitor this week.</LD>
<TE>   But almost everyone worried whether the criminal charges spelled
doom for the 88-year-old firm--and their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "People are shocked," said Suzanne Gylfe, a 35-year-old partner
who works in the global headquarters group in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "They're very, very concerned what this means for them, for their
families and for their jobs, and they feel pretty strong that this is
an action of a few people that's being punished," she said. "The
indictment of the firm is just not fair."</TE>
<TE>   The indictment prompted gallows humor inside Andersen's
headquarters as employees tried to absorb the news.</TE>
<TE>   Bryan Younge, 26, said co-workers gathered around a television to
watch the Justice Department news conference announcing the
indictment for the alleged destruction of Enron-related documents in
the firm's offices in Houston, Chicago, London and Portland, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   "There were some people walking around saying we're going to have
an indictment party on the floor," Younge said, adding that as
prosecutors outline the case, "a lot of people were kind of chuckling
at the indictment [for] saying the shredders were running virtually
nonstop for hours upon hours."</TE>
<TE>   Keeping it light helped employees cope with the news, Younge said,
but he predicted that the mood would change as the fallout of the
criminal case becomes apparent.</TE>
<TE>   "Spirits are high now, but ... I think in a month from now, it's
going to be a totally different picture," he said. "Right now, we're
kind of smiling, but we don't know if we're going to be out on the
street, looking for another job or not."</TE>
<TE>   Employees in Andersen's Southern California offices scrambled to
learn more about the fate of their company and their livelihoods.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen workers said that until Thursday, they had felt mounting
irritation at the lack of information they were getting from the
firm's top executives. The employees found out more from newspaper
accounts than they did from the firm, said Nathan Matthews, 30, an
auditor in the Woodland Hills office.</TE>
<TE>   "I was livid," Matthews said. "I found out about the [potential]
merger with Deloitte when I picked up the paper Monday."</TE>
<TE>   Top Andersen executives helped turn that fury outward at an 11:30
a.m. conference call Thursday in which they vowed to fight the
criminal proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm tired of people taking shots at us," Matthews said. "Enron
did not go bankrupt because we shredded some documents."</TE>
<TE>   The single father of two said he planned to stay with the company,
even while many of his co-workers are shipping resumes to rival
companies and executive search firms.</TE>
<TE>   Other accounting firms--including second-tier BDO Seidman, Grant
Thornton and McGladrey &amp; Pullen--said they have received a steady
stream of resumes from Andersen partners, accountants and auditors
since the shredding was revealed. This week, the stream became a
torrent, some said.</TE>
<TE>   "The sense of urgency from people wanting to leave there has just
exploded in the past couple of days," said an accountant who is
negotiating with several Andersen employees.</TE>
<TE>   If Andersen were to collapse, 85,000 employees could be searching
for work and some of the country's largest companies could be
scrambling to find new auditors.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Andersen can survive, accounting experts say, the partners
probably would lose their equity stakes--essentially retirement funds
worth hundreds of thousands of dollars--either in a bankruptcy filing
or as part of lawsuit settlements.</TE>
<TE>   The prospect that Andersen could shrivel and die because of a
scandal is a "grand irony," said Rice University accounting professor
and historian Stephen Zell.</TE>
<TE>   "Of all the firms that might have given people a reason to believe
they might compromise their principles, Arthur Andersen is the one
you would least suspect," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The reason is rooted in Andersen's history. The firm was founded
in 1913--the same year as the Federal Reserve--and it has prided
itself on honesty and integrity. Founder Arthur Andersen, a
Northwestern University accounting professor, demanded that employees
"think straight, talk straight," and he made it a point of pride not
to bow to pressure from clients.</TE>
<TE>   After Andersen's death in 1947, successor Leonard Spacek continued
to emphasize ethics as he advocated for reforms of the accounting
profession in general.</TE>
<TE>   "He was most proud of the reputation of the firm and its
integrity," said son Bruce A. Spacek, 66.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't imaging anything worse than an accounting firm, which
doesn't have anything to sell but its integrity, being criminally
indicted," Spacek said. "These are supposed to be the watchdogs."</TE>

<HD>Smaller Rivals Could Gain if Andersen Falls</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Some already have picked up clients. Experts
warn that reforms could suffer with fewer big firms.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Andersen fails under the weight of Thursday's criminal indictment,
the demise could cause costly disruptions for some of the world's
biggest companies while offering a bonanza for smaller accounting
firms looking to expand.</LD>
<LD>   The possible death of the fourth-largest accounting firm also
could reduce pressure for reforms, some experts worry, and leave the
industry even more rife with conflicts of interest.</LD>
<LD>   "If this industry gets down to just four [big] firms, that's a
problem," said Lynn Turner, former chief accountant at the Securities
and Exchange Commission. "Whenever you get that type of power in a
small group, you don't get the competition or policies that are best
for the public."</LD>
<TE>   Andersen's chances of survival narrowed dramatically Thursday,
accounting experts said, after it was indicted by a federal grand
jury in Houston on suspicion of obstruction of justice for shredding
tons of Enron Corp. documents.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen had tried to stave off the indictment in a letter to
prosecutors Wednesday that called the criminal proceedings a
potential death sentence because of the devastating effect on the
firm's reputation.</TE>
<TE>   Accounting experts said Thursday that the indictment would almost
certainly speed up the exodus of clients and employees that began
after Andersen revealed in January that it had destroyed
Enron-related documents. Such outflows quickly could cripple the
firm. "At the end of the day, [Andersen] will be gone," said Arthur
Bowman, editor of Bowman's Accounting Report. "The client losses so
far are just a signal of what's coming."</TE>
<TE>   Other companies are reaping the windfall. Smaller national and
regional firms say they are scooping up many of Andersen's smaller
clients and collecting resumes from the troubled company's employees.</TE>
<TE>   "This is creating more opportunities for us," said Mark Bagaason,
managing partner for the Southern California practice of Grant
Thornton. "We're getting a lot of calls and [requests for proposals]
from companies and resumes from Andersen people."</TE>
<TE>   Growth at second-tier companies probably has limits, however. The
gap is huge between the smallest of the Big Five and the next-largest
accounting firm, and most experts don't expect to see any of the
smaller firms stepping in to fill Andersen's shoes any time soon.</TE>
<TE>   "Our firm looked at that strategy at one time, but I don't expect
to see anything like that happening," said Roger Peters, a managing
partner at McGladrey &amp; Pullen. "The General Motors of the world are
never going to come to a firm like ours in the second tier, and we
couldn't service them anyway."</TE>
<TE>   The firms ranked sixth, seventh and eighth in the accounting world
in terms of U.S. revenue--BDO Seidman, Grant Thornton and McGladrey &amp;
Pullen, respectively--concentrate on mid-size companies with revenue
under $1billion. Combined, the three firms conducted just 800 SEC
audits last year, compared with Andersen's 2,407.</TE>
<TE>   "We're able to do some big companies, but we don't have the
troops" to do huge audits of multinational firms, said Scott M.
Univer, general counsel for BDO Seidman, which counts Steelcase Inc.
and Barnes &amp; Noble Inc. among its clients. "We can't put 500 auditors
out in the field on a company at the same time."</TE>
<TE>   The complex and unique needs of the world's largest firms can be
handled by only accounting firms with the Big Five's resources,
agreed accounting expert Bowman.</TE>
<TE>   "If Andersen suddenly implodes," Bowman said, "a lot of clients
will be trying to find auditors who understand their industries and
their needs."</TE>
<TE>   Anticipating the potential chaos, the SEC, in an unusual move,
said Thursday that it may allow Andersen's corporate clients to file
unaudited reports if the accounting firm goes out of business.</TE>
<TE>   A more orderly demise, such as a sale of assets in Bankruptcy
Court, would cause less disruption but still would be expensive,
accounting experts warned.</TE>
<TE>   "One implication ... is increased costs on the economy," said Mark
DeFond, a professor at USC's Marshall School of Business. "How
substantial those costs will be is another question, but it will
definitely be more disruptive and costly for companies to switch
firms."</TE>
<TE>   Andersen had hoped to avoid disruption through a merger, but talks
with rivals Ernst &amp; Young and Deloitte &amp; Touche, a unit of Deloitte
Touche Tohmatsu, broke off Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has lost a steady stream of high-profile clients,
including its largest, Merck &amp; Co. Others, such as Oracle Corp., have
publicly endorsed the firm and promised to stand by it.</TE>
<TE>   It's not clear how many other companies are preparing to leave.
Fleetwood Enterprises Inc., the Riverside-based maker of recreational
vehicles, said it is weighing its relationship with Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   Other Southland-based Andersen clients, including Korn/Ferry
International and Edison International, declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen's troubles, which stemmed from its dual roles as auditor
and consultant to Enron, may prompt other Big Five companies to
distance their SEC work from their consulting activities, some
accounting experts said.</TE>
<TE>   But others fear Andersen's demise would leave the remaining four
firms even more entrenched against reforms that could prevent the
kinds of conflicts of interest that led to Enron's downfall.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes me uneasy," said Paul Volcker, former Federal Reserve
Board chairman and head of a panel that Andersen asked to review its
operations. Volcker said it's possible that Andersen's demise could
reduce pressure on the remaining companies to change.</TE>
<TE>   Others reject that assertion, saying the accounting industry is
still likely to face change.</TE>
<TE>   "Reforms would stem from the Enron collapse," USC professor DeFond
said, "and that isn't going away."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Kathy M. Kristof contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Fund Managers Searching for Recovery Plays</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The stock market's sputter this week is reminding portfolio managers
of the challenge they face this year in picking winning stocks.</LD>
<LD>   Buoyed by recent data, many fund managers are optimistic about an
economic recovery and have been hunting for the best sectors, and
individual stocks, to play the rebound.</LD>
<LD>   But they caution that although stock valuations in general appear
to be reasonable based on estimated 2002 earnings, true bargains are
tough to find--which is why some investors have been quick to take
profits on recently hot issues.</LD>
<TE>   The Dow industrial average, which surged 8.5% in the four weeks
ended March 8, has pulled back 0.5% this week. The Nasdaq composite
index, up 6.1% in the four weeks ended March 8, has slumped 3.9% this
week.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the market ended little changed. The Dow added 15.29
points to 10,517.14 while the technology-heavy Nasdaq fell 7.89
points to 1,854.14.</TE>
<TE>   "The rally [this year] is recognition that we're in recovery
mode," said Carl Domino, manager of the Northern Large Cap Value Fund
in West Palm Beach, Fla. "The real issue is, how much upside does the
economy have?"</TE>
<TE>   "I think the market has 'priced in' a lot of the early phase of
the recovery," said Brian Barish, Denver-based manager of the Alpha
Analytics Value Fund.</TE>
<TE>   That is particularly true of the tech and telecom sectors, fund
managers say. That explains why many big investors still are shying
away from those sectors.</TE>
<TE>   But fund managers have been eager buyers in other stock sectors,
including transportation, energy, home building, finance and
aerospace.</TE>
<TE>   Domino said he recently added General Electric Co. (ticker symbol:
GE) to his portfolio, snapping up the conglomerate's shares for the
first time in more than a decade, when the price fell earlier this
year as "Enronitis" accounting concerns spread to other companies.</TE>
<TE>   Domino, whose fund is up 5.2% this year, also has added to energy
holdings such as Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO), Conoco Inc. (COC) and El
Paso Corp. (EP). Stronger energy demand, and the threat of a U.S.
conflict with Iraq, have helped send oil prices higher this year.</TE>
<TE>   Domino noted that although heavy-industry and other classic
cyclical stocks such as Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and International
Paper Co. (IP) boosted his portfolio earlier in the year as investors
anticipated an economic turnaround, in the last few weeks financial
holdings "have started kicking in."</TE>
<TE>   Although interest rates may have bottomed--some experts believe
the Federal Reserve might hint at future rate increases at its
meeting next week--some financial stocks still are too attractively
priced to pass up, Barish said. He recently added to stakes in
FleetBoston Financial Corp. (FBF) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC).</TE>
<TE>   And in the insurance sector, hard-hit after Sept. 11, Barish has
added to stakes in Allstate Corp. (ALL) and Germany's Allianz (U.S.
ticker: AZ), he said.</TE>
<TE>   Barish, whose fund is off 0.8% this year, also said he recently
bought shares of Circuit City Stores (CC) when the stock tumbled
because of disappointing earnings. Consumer electronics sales may
benefit from an economic pickup, Barish said, and in the longer term
as newer products such as DVDs, new video game consoles,
high-definition TVs and digital cameras rise in popularity.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Muhlenkamp, manager of the Muhlenkamp Fund in Wexford, Pa.,
said his fund has gotten a big lift in the last year from consumer
cyclical stocks such as mobile-home maker Winnebago Industries Inc.
(WGO) and home furnishings maker American Woodmark Corp. (AMWD).</TE>
<TE>   But "now that they are no longer dirt cheap, I might have to look
elsewhere for bargains," said Muhlenkamp, whose fund is up 5.5% this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Housing stocks such as Beazer Homes USA Inc. (BZH), Centex Corp.
(CTX) and Pulte Homes Inc. (PHM) also have had a strong run over the
last year, but Muhlenkamp said that sector still might have steam.</TE>
<TE>   "People always want more of what's been working, so there's a good
chance they will put more money into their houses and less into their
tech stocks," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In a precarious "stock picker's market," however, Muhlenkamp said
individual security selection is probably more important than
identifying the right sectors.</TE>
<TE>   "You could have picked discount retail awhile ago, for example,
and gone with either Wal-Mart or Kmart," he said. "That's a big
difference."</TE>
<TE>   Art Bonnel, manager of the Bonnel Growth Fund in San Antonio, up
1.2% this year, said he remains in the anti-tech camp for now,
instead spreading bets among other sectors, including retail,
defense, dining and health care.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, Bonnel said, he has added to his stakes in Linens
'n Things Inc. (LIN), which sells housewares; General Dynamics Corp.
(GD), a major defense contractor; and IHOP Corp. (IHP), which
operates the International House of Pancakes chain.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime holdings Bonnel still likes in the health-care area
include biotech giant Amgen Inc. (AMGN), drug distributor
AmerisourceBergen Corp. (ABC) and medical products maker ICU Medical
Inc. (ICUI), he said.</TE>
<TE>   But some growth-fund managers, who focus on companies expected to
show rapid earnings growth (rather than hunting for shares priced
cheaply relative to earnings), say they are shopping selectively in
the tech sector.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Oberweis, manager of the Oberweis Mid-Cap, Micro-Cap and
Emerging Growth funds in North Aurora, Ill., said smaller "niche"
tech firms whose products detect flaws or improve speed in the
manufacturing process continue to generate rising earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Such holdings he likes, or has added to recently, include Versity
Ltd. (VRST), HPL Technologies Inc. (HPLA), PDF Solutions Inc. (PDFS)
and Cabot Microelectronics Corp. (CCMP), he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a theme here: If companies don't want to make [new]
capital investments, they are willing to spend money on efficiency,"
said Oberweis, whose funds have fallen 8% to 9% year to date.</TE>
<TE>   In the medical area, he said he likes specialty product companies
considered resistant to economic cycles, such as Cytyc Corp. (CYTC),
whose cervical cancer screening products continue to gain acceptance,
and Possis Medical Inc. (POSS), whose devices remove blood clots.</TE>
<TE>   One problem facing all investors is that stocks in general never
got deeply undervalued in last year's downturn, Oberweis said.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, when a bull market crumbles, as the last one did
beginning in spring 2000, stocks sink "to an undervalued stage,
sometimes extremely undervalued," Oberweis said.</TE>
<TE>   That hasn't happened this time, because corporate earnings fell
drastically last year even as share prices declined, he said. So
share prices relative to earnings remain historically high in many
sectors.</TE>

<DH>USC Rallies From 19 Down, Then Falls to North Carolina
Wilmington, 93-89</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Sam Clancy was talking this week about how USC had taken on a
different role. The Trojans were the hunted now, he said, no longer
the hunter.</LD>
<LD>   Well, Tommy Trojan is now an endangered species, his head stuffed
and adorning a wall in Wilmington, N.C.</LD>
<LD>   Unheralded and 13th-seeded North Carolina Wilmington ended No.
4-seeded USC's season with a 93-89 overtime victory Thursday in a
first-round South Regional game at Arco Arena.</LD>
<TE>   It was an unceremonious exit from college for USC's three senior
starters--Sam Clancy, David Bluthenthal and Brandon Granville--as
they all fouled out.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tough loss, especially since the tournament can make or
break your season," said Clancy, who had a game-high 21 points with
six rebounds. "If you have a good tournament, you have a good season,
no matter how [underwhelming] it was."</TE>
<TE>   After advancing to the Elite Eight last March, the Trojans were a
fashionable pick this week to get to the Final Four. Instead, their
season ends at 22-10. Wilmington (23-9) will face Indiana in a
second-round game Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   USC was out of sorts from the beginning and had to make a huge
rally just to get to overtime.</TE>
<TE>   After being down by 19 points, 68-49, with 9:36 remaining in the
game, the Trojans roared back and tied the score at 80-80 on an
Errick Craven three-point basket from the right corner with 7.9
seconds to play.</TE>
<TE>   USC didn't help its cause by missing 12 free throws in the second
half.</TE>
<TE>   With momentum seemingly on their side, the Trojans opened the
overtime by missing layups. North Carolina Wilmington, meanwhile, was
re-energized.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes courage to go back out there when it seems as though the
world has ended," Seahawk Coach Jerry Wainwright said.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the USC locker room, the Trojans were mulling over lost
opportunities and why they came out so flat.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans were seemingly a half-step behind the Seahawks all
night and North Carolina Wilmington did not blink when USC unleashed
its vaunted press.</TE>
<TE>   USC forced only seven turnovers in the first half and did not get
a steal.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't help the Trojans that Clancy had picked up two fouls
before the game was four minutes old and that he couldn't play as
aggressively on defense.</TE>
<TE>   After the Trojans took an early 7-5 lead, the Seahawks went on a
9-2 run over a two-minute stretch to go up 14-9.</TE>
<TE>   USC followed with a 12-2 run over 2:29 to go up by five, 21-16,
following a Bluthenthal three-pointer with 10:55 to play in the half,
and the Trojans seemed to be on their way.</TE>
<TE>   But USC hit a wall, seemingly the same wall of fatigue that the
Trojans ran into in the second half of the Pacific 10 Conference
tournament title game against Arizona on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "This was our fourth game in seven days," Coach Henry Bibby said.
"I think at the beginning it just took us a while to get into the
game. I think the Pac-10 tournament took a little edge off of us. We
played in three tough games, winning two of those games. That's a lot
to ask of the kids. That was one of the drawbacks that we talked
about in the Pac-10 tournament."</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans could manage only two field goals the rest of the half
against North Carolina Wilmington as the Seahawks closed out with a
23-7 scoring spurt to enter the break with a nine-point lead, 37-28.</TE>
<TE>   "We just didn't bring it from the beginning," said sophomore guard
Desmon Farmer, who had 20 points in 38 minutes off the bench. "The
energy just wasn't there. I tried to bring the energy but our shots
weren't hitting. They were outrebounding us and playing tougher than
us."</TE>
<TE>   Then Bibby made a move that may haunt him all summer.</TE>
<TE>   In trying to send a message to starters Bluthenthal and Jerry
Dupree, Bibby sat the two forwards to start the second half,
inserting the offensively shy duo of Gregg Guenther and Robert
Hutchinson.</TE>
<TE>   The Seahawks opened the second half with a 14-4 run to go up by
19, 51-32, following a Stewart Hare three-pointer at the 16:05 mark.</TE>
<TE>   In catching the Seahawks down the stretch, the Trojans punched
themselves out.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like we ran out of gas," Farmer said. "The effort was
still there but you can only press for so long.</TE>
<TE>   "The press wasn't working."</TE>
<TE>   Bluthenthal, who had 19 points, had another theory.</TE>
<TE>   "Guys were playing selfishly," he said softly. "That's pretty much
it. Guys know the plays. Everyone knows where they have to be. It's a
matter of getting guys open shots."</TE>
<TE>   Seahawk junior guard Brett Blizzard and junior center Craig
Callahan, meanwhile, had plenty of open shots as they each had 18
points to lead North Carolina Wilmington, which had six players in
double figures.</TE>
<TE>   "The way to beat the press is that you can't take the quick
shots," Blizzard said. "You have to take the best shot, a quality
shot."</TE>
<TE>   Not only was it a case of the longer the Trojans allowed the
Seahawks to hang around, the more confidence they got, it turned into
a matter of the Seahawks watching the Trojans turn desperate before
their eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw that panicked look," Blizzard said. "I saw when some of
their players were saying, 'This is it, right now.' I knew we had
them on the ropes."</TE>
<TE>   Granville said the Trojans did not overlook the Seahawks.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew how good they were," Granville said. "There's not too
many slouch teams in the tournament that win 22 games. I thought they
just executed their game plan better than we did.</TE>
<TE>   "You play all season long to get here. And then to lose in the
first round, it's like it's all for naught."</TE>

<HD>Waves Get Knocked Out by a Make-or-Break Effort</HD>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>It's the time of year when a season comes down to one game, and a
game comes down to a few moments.</LD>
<LD>   Those moments belonged to Wake Forest on Thursday. In the end, so
did this first-round NCAA game that pushed the brake pedal on
Pepperdine's season.</LD>
<LD>   One huge swing of momentum stood out to Pepperdine guard Devin
Montgomery.</LD>
<TE>   "72-70," he said. "Three seconds left on the shot clock. They
shoot a fadeaway jump shot, they get the rebound, get fouled, hit two
free throws. That's game, right there."</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," teammate Boomer Brazzle said. "That's the one."</TE>
<TE>   Vytas Danelius' free throws after he rebounded Craig Dawson's miss
pushed Wake Forest's lead from two to four with 2:33 remaining.
Pepperdine wouldn't get a chance to tie again as Wake Forest squirted
away for an 83-74 victory. It wasn't a case of the team with the last
shot winning. In this game of surges and stops, it would be the team
with the last run.</TE>
<TE>   The Demon Deacons had it all. A good plan of attack drawn up by
Coach Skip Prosser. Solid point guard play by Broderick Hicks. Clutch
shooting.</TE>
<TE>   And the breaks.</TE>
<TE>   "That's basketball," Pepperdine Coach Paul Westphal said.</TE>
<TE>   In the first half, Darius Songaila made a jumper from the left
wing that bounced off the far side of the rim and made its way back
in. You could watch a whole season's worth of games without seeing
that play. It seemed so unlikely that it could have gone in without
someone else tipping it that the teams were already back downcourt
before the announcer felt confident enough to credit the basket to
Songaila.</TE>
<TE>   A forgiving rim? Not in the second half, when a Cedric Suitt layup
on that same hoop managed to crawl out, leaving the Waves with a
five-point deficit that quickly became eight on a three-point play by
Jamaal Levy.</TE>
<TE>   With 21/2 minutes left in the first half, Wake Forest benefited
from a missed call by the officials. Dawson's jump shot bounced high
off the rim and hit the game and shot clock above the backboard. That
should have given possession to Pepperdine, but the whistle didn't
blow and Wake Forest forward Antwan Scott alertly slammed the ball
home as it came down.</TE>
<TE>   "When it hit the clock, [the defender] just stopped," Scott said.
"I just kept looking at the ball. I saw it coming off. Coach just
kept saying attack the glass, because they weren't really a box-out
team."</TE>
<TE>   Westphal screamed at the officials.</TE>
<TE>   "I want a replay!" he said.</TE>
<TE>   He was as upset as most outsiders have ever seen him. ("I've seen
him upset at me in practice," Montgomery said.) He called a timeout
to harp on the officials some more. He delayed his halftime departure
from the court so he could stare down the officials,</TE>
<TE>   "They just said they didn't see it," Westphal said. "It's
astounding. I think it should be correctable. Your job is to get the
call right. Everybody in the gym saw it. The shot clock was shaking
when the ball hit it. They've got the other guy in a striped shirt
[the official scorer] sitting at half court. If there's not a
mechanism in place to correct that call, there should be."</TE>
<TE>   Replays can be used only to determine the correct time, whether a
shot is a three-pointer, or to determine the correct free-throw
shooter.</TE>
<TE>   "I love to see him fired up like that," Suitt said. "We all should
have been fired up like that the entire game, all 40 minutes. That
would have made a big difference in the game, had we been."</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine gave away the first 51/2 minutes of the game. The Waves
showed no patience against Wake Forest's zone defense, took bad shots
and fell behind, 15-2.</TE>
<TE>   "It took us a while to get adjusted to the tempo and the style of
the game," Brazzle said. "Everybody was probably a little nervous.
It's the NCAA tournament."</TE>
<TE>   And that's probably what sparked the Waves to fight their way back
into the game. They weren't ready to go home. Montgomery could get
into the paint at will, and he started to do so. The Waves began
making the extra pass, finding the open man, knocking down
three-pointers.</TE>
<TE>   In the second half, they even made a slight adjustment to cut off
the pass to the middle, which had been shredding their zone defense.
They took the lead three times.</TE>
<TE>   But they didn't have a start-to-finish game plan that worked as
well as Prosser's. His team protected the ball (only nine turnovers)
and hustled back on defense to limit Pepperdine's fastbreak
opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   The score was more a product of good shooting than fast tempo.</TE>
<TE>   "I sort of gave that up," said Prosser, who'd rather play the game
at NASCAR speed. "That's just not our personality. It would be my
personality, but I gave up being stubborn."</TE>
<TE>   Hicks had 15 points and seven assists and, as Westphal said, "he
calmly dropped some threes on us that were really painful."</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery scored 18 points, but he should have penetrated more
often. The opportunities were there for him, especially with Wake
Forest playing so much man-to-man in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Who knows what Westphal said during the timeouts, but every time
the Waves came out of one they either had a turnover or a bad shot.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Westphal and his players kept talking about next year.
They'll be hard pressed to replace the defensive presence of Suitt, a
senior who had four blocks and made the lane restricted air space for
several other Wake Forest shots. But their top five scorers for the
season (and this game) will be back.</TE>
<TE>   They also need to retain their lesson from this game, when a team
that wasn't overwhelmingly superior just grabbed the opportunities
that popped up.</TE>
<TE>   "Some things are going to go their way," Suitt said. "We proved
that we were a good team. In the end, their better players outplayed
us."</TE>

<LD>AT WASHINGTON</LD>
<LD>   Maryland vs. Siena: Siena--winner of the play-in game against
Alcorn State--is only the 16th team to make the NCAA tournament with
a losing record. The Saints are best known for upsetting Stanford in
the first round in 1989, but this team is not at that level. No
16th-seeded team has beaten a No. 1. Maryland Coach Gary Williams
probably will use the game to work on the Terrapin defense.</LD>
<LD>   Wisconsin vs. St. John's: For a No. 8-vs.-No. 9 game, this one is
not particularly attractive. St. John's is coming off a 20-point loss
to Notre Dame in the Big East tournament and Wisconsin lost to Iowa
on a late shot by Luke Recker in the Big Ten. Wisconsin, led by guard
Kirk Penney, a New Zealander, won its last five regular-season games,
including upsets of Ohio State and Indiana. St. John's, led by guard
Marcus Hatten, has lost three of its last five games.</LD>
<TE>   North Carolina State vs. Michigan State: North Carolina State
upset Maryland in the semifinals of the ACC tournament before losing
to Duke in the final. Michigan State's streak of three consecutive
Final Fours figures to end this year, but the young Spartans played
well down the stretch, beating Indiana and Ohio State late in the
season before losing to Indiana in the Big Ten tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Connecticut vs. Hampton: Hampton pulled the big upset as a No.
15-seeded team last year, beating Iowa State, and once again is a No.
15 playing a No. 2. Hampton also upset North Carolina early this
season. But Connecticut, which beat North Carolina by 32 in January,
is playing its best basketball of the season. The Huskies are coming
off a double-overtime upset of Pittsburgh in the Big East tournament
final.</TE>

<TE>   Texas Tech vs. Southern Illinois: For all the talk about how Red
Raider Coach Bob Knight is dangerous when given time to prepare, he
was 2-6 in his last six NCAA appearances at Indiana. Texas Tech is a
little too dependent on three players--Kasib Powell, Andy Ellis and
Andre Emmett--to provide the bulk of its scoring, and is coming off a
40-point loss to Kansas in the Big 12 tournament. Southern Illinois
is an athletic team and has a puncher's chance, led by guard Kent
Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia vs. Murray State: Jim Harrick (remember him?) turned in
another dandy, post-UCLA coaching job in leading the Bulldogs to
their second consecutive NCAA bid. This is the 16th team Harrick has
led into the tournament, although Georgia lacks momentum after going
out in the first round of the Southeastern Conference tournament.
Murray State has won 10 of 11 games.</TE>

<BD>From Tribune News Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The ball swung from Cordell Henry, Marquette's second-leading scorer,
to Dwyane Wade, its leading scorer, to Travis Diener, a dangerous
outside shooter who comes off the bench. This was the Golden Eagles'
final possession Thursday in a riveting game with Tulsa, which had
just taken a two-point lead on a runner by Greg Harrington with 14.6
seconds remaining.</LD>
<LD>   Diener went up from 25 feet with just over two seconds remaining
and offered up a prayer that was far short. Wade sliced along the
left baseline and went up to meet the ball in an effort to transform
Diener's shot into an alley-oop dunk ... to no avail.</LD>
<LD>   That was how Thursday's first-round East Regional matchup in St.
Louis ended--in a 71-69 win for Tulsa, which moved on to a Saturday
meeting with Kentucky, conqueror of Valparaiso. That, too, was how
the season ended for Marquette, the region's No. 5-seeded team and a
41/2-point favorite.</LD>
<TE>   Tulsa, seeded 12th, shot 45.6%, outrebounded Marquette, 37-28, and
scored 27 second-chance points. It took a four-point halftime lead
and built it to 14 with 12 minutes remaining. But Marquette rallied,
and a Henry jumper at 3:54 finally brought his team even at 65-65.
The score would be tied again at 67 and at 69.</TE>
<TE>   A minute later, after a Tulsa timeout, Marquette shut down the
play the Golden Hurricane sought, but Harrington improvised and put
up a running 12-footer that bounced in. "That was an old-school shot
famous in the '50s," Tulsa Coach John Phillips said. "But it wasn't
luck. We've seen him do it before."</TE>
<TE>   And Marquette couldn't answer.</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky 83, Valparaiso 68--For one day, at least, the Wildcats
looked like a team. They found the open man on offense. They hustled
on defense. They even played as if they liked each other in a victory
over No. 13 Valparaiso in an East Regional opener at St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Given Kentucky's recent play, this might qualify as the NCAA
tournament's first upset.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth-seeded Wildcats arrived in town in apparent disarray.
They had lost four of their last nine games, including an uninspired
70-57 loss to NIT-bound South Carolina in a Southeastern Conference
tournament semifinal.</TE>
<TE>   That result, at the end of a season racked by suspensions and
dissension, seemed to foretell an early NCAA tournament exit.</TE>
<TE>   But this was a different team.</TE>
<TE>   "When you turn on ESPN and you hear them saying, 'Don't let the
door hit you on the way out, Big Blue,' and you look in a magazine
and see that everyone's picking Valpo, you do take that to heart,"
said Keith Bogans, who scored 21 points in Kentucky's record 88th
NCAA tournament win.</TE>

<HD>Indiana Makes a Blanket Statement</HD>
<DH>South: Fifth-seeded Hoosiers' defense is in vintage form,
shutting down Utah in a convincing 75-56 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Who wins when a team that shoots first and asks no questions plays a
team whose electric blanket defense has an answer for everything?</LD>
<LD>   It was an intriguing matchup of contrasting styles in Thursday
night's first-round NCAA South Regional game at Arco Arena, where
Indiana scored a 75-56 decision over Utah.</LD>
<LD>   The fifth-seeded Hoosiers of the Big Ten advanced to a
second-round game Saturday against 13th-seeded North Carolina
Wilmington, which upset fourth-seeded USC in overtime, 93-89.</LD>
<TE>   Indiana didn't invent defense, but the Hoosiers played as though
they did. Utah didn't break 50 points until 2:31 to play, and by that
time, Indiana was well on its way to putting it away with a 65-51
lead.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, this Utah team, which finished 21-9, isn't as heavy in
offensive firepower as in prior years, but what the Utes do have is a
lot of big players who can shoot from the perimeter, and that worried
Indiana Coach Mike Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "What we wanted to do was come out and make it the toughest game
they've ever been in defensively and I think we played them well,"
said Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there is a team out there that does what we do
defensively."</TE>
<TE>   The defeat ended an impressive streak for Rick Majerus, who had
coached Utah to eight consecutive first-round victories in the NCAA
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a very good year and I don't know we played a bad game,
but Indiana played a terrific game," Majerus said. "Indiana beat us
up physically."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Coverdale led the Hoosiers with 19 points and four assists,
which are nice numbers for a 6-foot-2 guard, but he also had eight
rebounds. Jeff Newton added 15 points and Jared Jeffries had 12.</TE>
<TE>   Coverdale opened the second half with a pair of breakaway layups
that forced a quick timeout from Majerus. Less than five minutes deep
into the second half, Indiana had a 50-30 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Utah made it tougher, thanks to Phil Cullen, a 6-9 senior and the
player Davis worried about the most. He made seven of eight
three-pointers and wound up with 25 points in 26 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "We prepared for Indiana just like any other team," Cullen said.
"They were just really good."</TE>
<TE>   Majerus said one of the bigger differences in the game was that
his team didn't have a dominant player inside.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana led, 42-27, at halftime, doing a lot of it with defense.
The Utes could only get 19 shots, and only Cullen, who scored 16
points in 13 minutes, kept them remotely close.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, the Utes shot a combined five for 13 in the first half,
which may be why Majerus stood up most of the half, trying to coax a
few more jump shots to fall.</TE>
<TE>   Newton gave the Hoosiers a lift with 11 points in 13 minutes off
the bench and Coverdale had 10 points, four rebounds and three
assists at the half.</TE>
<TE>   It was not easy for the Hoosiers to forget about last year's
first-round tournament loss to Kent State.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're getting questions all the time about whether you're
going to win in the first round, what you're going to do, it creates
pressure," Jeffries said</TE>
<TE>   Said Newton: "We came out thinking about last year's loss to Kent
State. We didn't want that to happen again."</TE>

<LD>   Florida vs. Creighton: Creighton hopes to join the club of No. 12s
that have pulled off upsets--Tulsa over Marquette, Missouri over
Miami--and, guess what, Florida appears to be in disarray. The Gators
are sort of to the South what UCLA is to the West--an enigma.
Florida, a top-10 preseason pick, enters the regional having lost
seven of its last 14 games and its starting guard, Brett Nelson, now
having to turn his other cheek(bone). Nelson, the team's
third-leading scorer, is expected to play despite fracturing his
cheekbone in a Tuesday practice skirmish with teammate LaDarius
Halton.</LD>
<LD>   Illinois vs. San Diego State: An interesting matchup between a
team that vastly underachieved this year, Illinois, and one that
overachieved in San Diego State. Illinois is playing better after an
early-season funk. All fortunes begin and end with guard Frank
Williams, who has not had a great season. Williams is shooting only
38% from the field but is capable of performances that can carry a
team deep into March. San Diego State claimed its first NCAA bid
since 1985 by winning the Mountain West Conference tournament.</LD>

<TE>   Mississippi State vs. McNeese State: This is a matchup of two of
the hottest teams in the country. Mississippi State has won its last
eight and nine of its last 10. The Bulldogs knocked off favored
Florida and Alabama en route to the Southeastern Conference
tournament championship. Both teams have stingy defenses, but
Mississippi State is a superior rebounding team led by 6-9, 265-pound
forward Mario Austin (16 points, 7.6 rebounds). Point guard Derrick
Zimmerman (6.2 assists) does a good job running the offense.</TE>
<TE>   Texas vs. Boston College: Texas features fleet freshman point
guard T.J. Ford (10.6 points, 8.5 assists), who is trying to became
the first freshman in NCAA history to lead the nation in assists.
Guard Royal Ivey (11.2 points) is a slasher, not a shooter, but his
specialty is defense. He held Stanford's Casey Jacobsen to nine
points in December.</TE>

<HD>Lower Seed No Problem for Stanford</HD>

<LD>Stanford didn't need its typical high seed to make it eight
consecutive opening-round victories in the NCAA tournament.</LD>
<LD>   Seeded No. 8 in the Midwest Regional, the Cardinal shrugged off a
pregame technical for turning in a lineup card late, getting 19
points and 12 rebounds from Curtis Borchardt in an 84-68 victory over
No. 9 Western Kentucky on Thursday night at St. Louis.</LD>
<LD>   Casey Jacobsen added 17 points, six rebounds and four assists
despite four-for-12 shooting.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a really, really weird role being the underdog," Jacobsen
said. "On past teams, if we didn't make it to the Final Four the
season was considered a failure.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking at this like we're going to make up for some games
earlier this year."</TE>
<TE>   Stanford usually is one of the top-seeded teams. Stanford was a
No. 1 the previous two seasons, a No. 2 in 1999 and No. 3 in 1998,
but this season there's only one senior in the starting lineup.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Stanford (20-9) will play top-seeded Kansas in the
second round Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "We will treat that with the utmost respect, as if that was our
Final Four game," Coach Mike Montgomery said.</TE>
<TE>   Western Kentucky (28-4) got the early jump when Patrick Sparks,
who had 20 points and nine assists, made one of two free throws on
the technical. Montgomery said he might need a lineup coach.</TE>
<TE>   "That was stupid," he said. "Somebody made a big deal of it and
wanted to press the issue, so they really didn't have a choice."</TE>
<TE>   But the Hilltoppers' last lead was 3-2 as their 18-game winning
streak came to an end with their first loss since Dec. 30 at South
Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford withstood a second-half charge from Western Kentucky,
which nearly recovered after shooting 23 percent in the first half
and scoring only 22 points--only one point more than its season low.
A lead that once was 16 points was whittled to one at 44-43 after
Western Kentucky hit three straight three-pointers to cap a 14-2 run
with 11:49 to go.</TE>
<TE>   "During that stretch, we finished shots and we worked our offense
with patience and poise," Western Kentucky Coach Dennis Felton said.
"Stanford made the adjustments and then took us out of what we wanted
to do."</TE>
<TE>   But the Cardinal quickly recovered with a 10-1 run-- the last five
points as reserve Josh Childress drove the baseline for a dunk and
hit a three-pointer in a 49-second span.</TE>

<TE>   Kansas 70, Holy Cross 59--The Jayhawks barely avoided becoming the
first No. 1-seeded team in the history of the NCAA tournament to make
a first-round exit, holding off Holy Cross at St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Beside beating Holy Cross, the Jayhawks (30-3) also overcame their
own history of failures--five early losses as a No. 1 seed since
1986.</TE>
<TE>   They rallied from a five-point second-half deficit without All-Big
12 guard Kirk Hinrich, who sprained his left ankle in the final
minute of the first half. He returned on crutches with less than
eight minutes to go wearing an air cast and a heavy wrap, his leg
elevated on a chair at the end of the bench.</TE>
<TE>   All-American Drew Gooden had 19 points and 13 rebounds to lead
Kansas, which went unbeaten in the Big 12 and had a 16-game winning
streak ended in the Big 12 Conference tournament final against No. 3
Oklahoma. The Jayhawks haven't lost consecutive games since falling
to Baylor and Iowa State Feb. 12-17, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Holy Cross befuddled Kansas with a matchup zone all night, and
stayed in the game until the end despite shooting only 33.3%.</TE>
<TE>   The Crusaders compensated by committing only nine turnovers and by
patiently working the ball inside against Kansas' heralded big men.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas didn't clinch it until Aaron Miles scored from the key with
two seconds left on the shot clock to make it 64-57 with 51 seconds
to go. Holy Cross had two consecutive takeaways but was stopped on
the other end before Miles' shot.</TE>

<TE>   Oregon 81, Montana 62--The Ducks were full of early-game jitters,
feeling the pressure of being seeded No. 2 in an NCAA regional.</TE>
<TE>   But after taking a deep breath and calming themselves, the Ducks
were able to outlast 15th-seeded Montana at Sacramento. It was
Oregon's first win in the NCAA tournament since 1960.</TE>
<TE>   "It might not have been an up-and-down track meet," said Oregon
sophomore guard Luke Jackson, who scored 18 points. "But toward the
end of the game, I felt their guards were worn down. I felt we
controlled the tempo."</TE>
<TE>   In a second-round game Saturday, Oregon (24-8) will play Wake
Forest (21-12).</TE>
<TE>   Montana's season ended at 16-15.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon sophomore point guard Luke Ridnour also had 18 points while
senior guard Frederick Jones, the lone Duck with any real NCAA
experience, finished with 16 points in 29 foul-plagued minutes.
Robert Johnson, a junior forward, had a career-high 15 points on
five-of-six shooting from the field.</TE>
<TE>   Montana was led by senior forward Ryan Slider's 12 points.</TE>

<KH>Mike Penner SOUND AND VISION</KH>
<HD>On TV, the Price Is Wrong for West Coast NCAA Teams</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Penner</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They were talking about seeds, they were talking about pods, they
were talking about digging holes, they were talking about laying
bricks.</LD>
<LD>   So, how does Clark Kellogg's garden grow?</LD>
<LD>   It grows today without some of the brightest blooms of West Coast
basketball--no USC, no Gonzaga, no Pepperdine--all weeded out in
Thursday's first round of the NCAA tournament.</LD>
<TE>   You can hear the self-satisfied cackling now echoing from the
Atlantic to the Mississippi.</TE>
<TE>   So, it turns out Gonzaga was over-seeded.</TE>
<TE>   So, it turns out USC couldn't win the Pac-10 . . . or the Colonial
Athletic Assn. either.</TE>
<TE>   Every March, the Pac-10 and the West Coast Conference and the
Mountain West Conference dispatch teams to the NCAA tournament with
the following marching orders:</TE>
<TE>   1. Here's your 40 minutes in the national spotlight--do what you
can with it.</TE>
<TE>   2. Show the East Coast establishment that the basketball played
out here is worth staying up late for.</TE>
<TE>   Unless, of course, you're the reigning Pac-10 champions from the
University of Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   In which case, you had zero minutes in the national spotlight
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   That's right. The Ducks, outright conference champions for the
first time since 1939, angling for their first NCAA victory since
1960, extended one of the season's most unlikely success stories with
a first-round victory over Montana--and 94% of the country missed it.</TE>
<TE>   That included the Los Angeles area, which had to settle for "The
Price Is Right" and Judge Judy instead of Luke Ridnour cranking them
up from 25 feet. Unless you lived in Oregon, Montana, Washington or
Northern California, CBS wasn't giving you anything in gold and
green, not even one measly "Live Look-In."</TE>
<TE>   This is why CBS, despite its avalanche of publicity and useful
bracket-tracking Website, will never surpass ESPN when it comes to
covering the NCAA tournament. The early rounds, the first Thursday
and Friday, demand all-day coverage, which is the kind of commitment
all-sports ESPN could give it during the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   But CBS has local affiliates to placate. So at 2:30 p.m. Pacific
Standard Time, the NCAA tournament took a two-hour break, even if no
one informed Oregon and Montana, who played on throughout a near
coast-to-coast television blackout while CBS affiliates cut away to
the evening news (in Eastern and Central time zones) and must-see
daytime filler (welcome to L.A.).</TE>
<TE>   By now, you'd have to suspect Oregon is developing a complex.</TE>
<TE>   Its top-of-the-first-round NFL prospect, quarterback Joey
Harrington--snubbed by the Heisman electorate.</TE>
<TE>   Its once-defeated football team--snubbed by the BCS.</TE>
<TE>   Its out-of-nowhere Pac-10 champion basketball squad--snubbed by
CBS.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, this was the scouting report the country got on the
Pac-10 Thursday:</TE>
<TE>   Arizona had to struggle to hold off UC Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford proved itself better than Western Kentucky.</TE>
<TE>   USC had to scramble from 19 points back just to force overtime
against North Carolina Wilmington. And once there, with the
13th-seeded Seahawks seemingly out of gas and luck, the Trojans
faltered again, dropping out of the tournament with a 93-89 loss.</TE>
<TE>   How could this happen? CBS' courtside broadcasters, Ian Eagle and
Jim Spanarkel, were both at a loss.</TE>
<TE>   With Wilmington holding an 88-83 lead in the extra period, a
stunned Eagle said, "It figured when USC made their run to force
overtime, the potential was there for [the Seahawks] to have nothing
left in the extra session."</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely," Spanarkel agreed. "I thought they would crumble
after that, the way [USC] tied the basketball game."</TE>
<TE>   No one managed much of an answer, least of all the coaches.
Because the game went longer than expected, and because CBS had other
games backed up for quick cutaway, neither USC's Henry Bibby nor
Wilmington's Jerry Wainwright were interviewed on camera.</TE>
<TE>   CBS had to move to Albuquerque, where Arizona's Wildcats were
blinking in disbelief at Mark Hull's three-point clinic, for
play-by-play announcer Gus Johnson to offer the most reasonable
theory:</TE>
<TE>   "I believe USC got caught looking ahead to Duke (in the third
round).... They thought they could get by Duke."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the Trojans were knocked out by another team from North
Carolina separated by a universe or two from Duke, a team that won in
spite of some obvious down-the-stretch jitters.</TE>
<TE>   When the Seahawks fouled USC's Brandon Granville on a three-point
attempt while holding a six-point lead with 10.2 seconds remaining in
overtime, Eagle said, "It begs the question, why?"</TE>
<TE>   "There really isn't a basketball answer for that," Spanarkel
replied.</TE>
<TE>   Ask an Oregon fan why the Ducks weren't on national TV Thursday.
You'll probably get the same response.</TE>

<LD>Even though Devin Montgomery led the way for the Waves with 18 points
(and played all 40 minutes), the combination of Jimmy Miggins and
Boomer Brazzle was working against whatever defense Wake Forest
played. Miggins had 11 points and five rebounds and Brazzle had 15
points and five rebounds.</LD>
<LD>   Throw in Glen McGowan, who came off the bench to score 12 points
in just 15 minutes and you can see why Demon Deacon Coach Skip
Prosser continued changing defenses to try to disrupt Pepperdine.</LD>
<LD>   Miggins said the Waves took everything that Wake Forest threw at
them. "They tried zones and pressuring up on our shooters and double
teams and we finally got over the hump," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Brazzle said Pepperdine's early problems that led to Wake Forest
running off to leads of 9-0 and 17-4 were correctable. "We just came
out a little tentative, but after that, we got in our groove," he
said. "They just made the big plays at the end."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coach Paul Westphal, on 6-foot-11 senior center Cedric Suitt: "He
blocks shots, he changes shots, he doesn't have to score to help us."</TE>
<TE>   Suitt had only six points in 37 minutes, but he had nine rebounds
and four blocked shots.</TE>
<TE>   Suitt, the West Coast Conference defensive player of the year, had
92 blocked shots before this game and 92 points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Westphal said the shots that really hurt seemed to come from Wake
Forest point guard Broderick Hicks. "He calmly dropped some threes on
us that were really painful," Westphal said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mike Westphal, the coach's son, played in the game and
scored--something his father never had a chance to do in the NCAA
tournament when he played at USC. When Paul Westphal played with the
Trojans, only the conference champion advanced to the tournament and
that spot seemed reserved for UCLA.... Pepperdine is 0-12 against
Atlantic Coast Conference teams and 0-4 against the ACC in the NCAA
tournament.</TE>

<HD>Waves Aren't Able to Exorcise Deacons</HD>
<DH>Midwest Regional: Pepperdine comes back from early deficit
but falls to Wake Forest, 83-74.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>So much for that first-round upset special. Pepperdine, a popular
choice to knock off Wake Forest, probably should have, but didn't do
it Thursday at Arco Arena, losing, 83-74, to the Demon Deacons in a
Midwest Regional game decided in the last 21/2 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   The Waves were down by two points with 2:23 to go, but they didn't
score again until there were 37.5 seconds left, outscored, 9-2, down
the stretch. Wake Forest thus avoided getting dumped on its backside,
as some believed was possible.</LD>
<LD>   "We knew we were the upset special," guard Broderick Hicks said of
the seventh-seeded Deacons. "We played with a chip on our shoulder."</LD>
<TE>   For the longest time, it appeared that Paul Westphal's Waves,
seeded 10th, were prepared to slap it right off. Despite a
lead-footed start that allowed Wake Forest to erect a 17-4 lead, the
Waves came back and kept coming back, right until it counted the
most.</TE>
<TE>   Devin Montgomery, owner of snazzy blue shoes and a very cool jump
shot, scored 18 points for the Waves but took issue with all the
upset talk.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, we heard it," he said. "But it wouldn't have been an upset to
us."</TE>
<TE>   Fair enough. Still, Wake Forest will advance to Saturday's
second-round game against Oregon. Craig Dawson had 19 points and made
five of nine from beyond the three-point line, but he knew beating
the Waves was hardly a breeze.</TE>
<TE>   "We know we're fortunate to still be playing," Dawson said.</TE>
<TE>   No one would argue. When Boomer Brazzle knocked down a jumper with
3:24 to go, the Waves were down, 72-70. On Wake Forest's next trip
downcourt, Cedric Suitt swatted away a shot by Darius Songaila, with
three seconds left on the shot clock. After a timeout, the ball came
in to Dawson, who missed, but Vytas Danelius got the rebound and was
fouled by Craig Lewis. He made both foul shots for a 74-70 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis scored on a driving layup to get the Waves closer, but they
could do little else.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery pointed to the Wake Forest possession that led to two
free throws even though there were only three seconds on the shot
clock.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the game right there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it wasn't that simple. Wake Forest scored on its last
seven possessions, shot 55.6% in the second half, got into the bonus
foul shooting situation way too early for the Waves' liking and shut
down Pepperdine's shooters at just the right time. Westphal had no
problem breaking down the game in the last few minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "They made the plays, we missed our shots," he said. "The game is
as simple as that."</TE>
<TE>   Wake Forest (21-12) wasn't exactly on a roll when it showed up at
the arena. The Demon Deacons had lost six of their last nine and star
forward Josh Howard hadn't been able to practice for three days
because of a sprained ankle. He didn't start, played only 18 minutes
and scored eight points. Coach Skip Prosser said sitting Howard
wasn't that tough a decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, he couldn't practice," Prosser said. "It wasn't like
deciding to invade France on D-day."</TE>
<TE>   Songaila scored 14 of his 18 points in the second half and had his
work cut out for him, trying to maneuver inside with the 6-foot-11
Suitt always in the way. Suitt also had nine rebounds and four
blocked shots.</TE>
<TE>   In spite of its slow start, Pepperdine pulled itself together in a
hurry. Wake Forest changed defenses constantly to keep the Waves'
shooters from getting a rhythm, and it worked for a while. Hicks
knocked down a three-pointer for a 32-23 Wake Forest lead, but
Pepperdine scored the next seven points--a muscle move inside by
Brazzle, a three-point basket off the break and a driving layup.</TE>
<TE>   At the half, Wake Forest's lead was only 38-35 and Pepperdine took
the lead three times after that, the last at 54-52. The Waves
certainly managed to get Wake Forest's attention, but whether it was
the Demon Deacons' experience with four senior starters, good defense
(Montgomery didn't score in the last 14 minutes) or just good luck,
they stuck together when it got close.</TE>
<TE>   Hicks, whose rainbow three-pointer gave Wake Forest a 77-72 lead
at the two-minute mark, says it's simply the mark of a good team.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not really a panicking team," he said. "We're a veteran
team. If we haven't seen it all, we've seen close to it."</TE>
<TE>   So too had Westphal, who couldn't believe his eyes in the first
half when a shot by Dawson clanked off the shot clock and the
officials didn't stop play. Antwan Scott got a dunk on the play and a
36-30 lead. That didn't sit well with Westphal.</TE>
<TE>   "It's astounding," he said. "[The officials] just said they didn't
see it .... Everybody in the gym saw it."</TE>
<TE>   What they also saw was a Pepperdine team that finished with a 22-9
record, losing for only the third time in its last 19 games.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking forward to next year," Westphal said. "We think
we're going to be in this tournament and hopefully go a little
farther next year."</TE>
<TE>   Until then, Montgomery said the Waves are going to have some
thinking to do about this game and what happened.</TE>
<TE>   "We just didn't have it," he said. "It's very disappointing.
That's what we talked about, that we didn't want to be one of those
teams that are a one-shot wonder, over and out. But I guess we did
it."</TE>

<DH>Charting The Lead: A look at the Waves' lead or deficit by

<LD>What happened: A traffic jam outside Arco Arena made many late for
the opening tip. Apparently, Pepperdine's offense was stuck outside
as well. Wake Forest scored the first nine points and eventually
built a 15-2 advantage, forcing the Waves to play a frantic game of
catch-up the rest of the half.</LD>
<LD>   Not in the box score: With its sluggish offense and its early
inability to make anything happen down low, Pepperdine looked like an
intimidated team. It was a far different face from the one the Waves
presented while knocking off UCLA and USC within eight days in late
November and early December.</LD>
<LD>   Winning number: Pepperdine was able to claw back to within three
points at the break by outrebounding the bigger Demon Deacons, 20-15.
And junior guard Devin Montgomery, who was averaging 11.4 points,
scored 13 in the half.</LD>
<TE>   Wrong number: Pepperdine's perimeter defense allowed Wake Forest,
which came into the game averaging 6.9 three-pointers, to knock down
four of nine shots from beyond the three-point stripe in the half.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Pepperdine--Montgomery 13, Glen McGowan 8, Jimmy
Miggins and Boomer Brazzle 5; Wake Forest--Craig Dawson 9, Antwan
Scott 8, Josh Howard 6.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Pepperdine--Cedric Suitt 5, Brazzle 4; Wake
Forest--Scott and Vytas Danelius 3.</TE>

<LD>What happened: Pepperdine finally began to force the tempo as the
Waves tied the score, 40-40, at the 18:24 mark before grabbing their
first lead of the game, 43-42, 62 seconds later. Unfortunately for
the Waves (and their big men), Wake Forest center Darius Songaila
finally made his presence in the paint known. The Waves had no answer
for the 6-foot-9, 248-pound Lithuanian bruiser, who scored 14 of his
18 points in the second half.</LD>
<LD>   Not in the box score: After leading, 54-52, with 12:50 remaining
in the game, Pepperdine seemed to have punched itself out. The weary
Waves began missing shots from point-blank range and were having
trouble hitting from outside.</LD>
<LD>   Winning number: Neutralized in the first half, Songaila responded
by making five of nine shots from the field. And Wake Forest scored
on five consecutive possessions in the final minutes while Pepperdine
struggled.</LD>
<TE>   Wrong number: The Waves went to the free-throw line only once in
the second half and Suitt missed that one, blowing a chance at a
three-point play that would have pulled the Waves within two, 61-59,
with 9:46 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Pepperdine--Brazzle 10, Craig Lewis 7, Miggins 6;
Wake Forest--Songaila 14, Broderick Hicks and Dawson 10.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Pepperdine--Suitt and McGowan 4; Wake
Forest--Danelius 5, Songaila 4.</TE>

<HD>Bibby's Message Sent: It's Loud and Unclear</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Back into the shadows they go.</LD>
<LD>   Back into the land of afterthought they travel, dragged there
Thursday in full public view, too exhausted to kick, too embarrassed
to scream.</LD>
<LD>   Back to the back pages they land, a USC basketball team painfully
crushed under weighty headlines, wild hype and a bit of wackiness
from Henry Bibby.</LD>
<TE>   This mismatch between the fourth-seeded Trojans and 13th-seeded
North Carolina Wilmington in the first round of the NCAA tournament
was supposed to be the running start of a leap that would change the
perception of USC's basketball program forever.</TE>
<TE>   A 93-89 overtime defeat later, and the last impression is that of
a skid mark.</TE>
<TE>   Remember how everyone thought the Trojans were headed for a
third-round showdown with Duke?</TE>
<TE>   They forgot to first put up their dukes.</TE>
<TE>   Remember how they seemed guaranteed at least a second consecutive
appearance in the Sweet 16?</TE>
<TE>   They stunk up the Arco Arena barn.</TE>
<TE>   Forget USC's comeback from a 19-point deficit in the final 10
minutes of regulation.</TE>
<TE>   Forget Errick Craven's three-pointer to tie it in regulation.</TE>
<TE>   Forget Sam Clancy's two blocked dunks, and Jerry Dupree's tipped
pass, and all the drama that nearly made this one of the most
compelling basketball victories in our town's history.</TE>
<TE>   Because, in the end, it was still a loss, and not just any loss.</TE>
<TE>   It was a loss to an extension campus in an anonymous conference
with a record that included defeats to Drexel and Radford.</TE>
<TE>   It was a loss to a school so anonymous, two years ago the charter
plane scheduled to pick it up and take it to this tournament instead
landed at Wilmington, Delaware.</TE>
<TE>   It was a loss to a school with no names on backs of their shirts,
no shirts on half of the members of the pep band, and nobody you'll
ever see in the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody on the team knew much about them, I had never even heard
of them," said Dupree, shaking his head. "So we didn't come to play."</TE>
<TE>   In the first half, they came to argue with each other, take silly
chances on defense, take quick shots on offense, and generally
warrant a question asked by Bibby of Desmon Farmer at the beginning
of a timeout.</TE>
<TE>   "Desmon, what the ... are you doing?" he shouted.</TE>
<TE>   At halftime, they trailed by nine points.</TE>
<TE>   Then the second half began, and a similar question needed to be
asked of Bibby himself.</TE>
<TE>   "Henry, what the ... are you doing?"</TE>
<TE>   He started the half with starters David Bluthenthal and Dupree on
the bench, and little-used Gregg Guenther Jr. and Robert Hutchinson
in the game.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby said neither player had been working hard enough, and he
wanted to send them a message.</TE>
<TE>   Three minutes later, the message was that--duh--the Trojans
couldn't win this game without their best players.</TE>
<TE>   They were outscored 10-2 with Bluthenthal on the bench, fell
behind by 18 points by the time he returned to action, and spent the
rest of the game sapping their strength while trying to catch up.</TE>
<TE>   Said Bluthenthal: "Coach Bibby has always been quick to do that,
he doesn't care who he plays ... but I was surprised."</TE>
<TE>   Said Bibby: "I wanted to get their attention."</TE>
<TE>   He wanted to get their attention?</TE>
<TE>   He certainly got our attention.</TE>
<TE>   That sort of thing may work on a Saturday night in Corvallis but
in the most important game of the season?</TE>
<TE>   At least Bluthenthal returned in time to score 19 points and
grabbed a team-leading seven rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   But Dupree, who last weekend helped the team to a second-place
finish in the Pac-10 tournament, sat the bench until the final
minutes of the game, when he stole an inbounds pass that led to free
throw that set up the game-tying basket.</TE>
<TE>   But by then, his teammates were so exhausted, even the momentum of
Craven's three-pointer with seven seconds left in regulation couldn't
save them.</TE>
<TE>   There is a reason Clancy, having played every minute since then,
missed a layup and two consecutive tips on the first possession of
the overtime. He was too exhausted to dunk.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't get the lift anymore," he said.</TE>
<TE>   If one of those tips goes in, giving the Trojans their first lead
since midway through the first half, here's guessing they win.</TE>
<TE>   But Bibby's decision to send someone a message left his team
short-handed.</TE>
<TE>   It was a message matched in cost only by the one sent the Trojan
program by Georgia Tech's James Forrest in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Remember when his three-pointer at the buzzer ended the Trojan
tournament hopes in the second round? Remember how that was also
going to be the team that changed basketball at USC?</TE>
<TE>   In the four years after that shot, the Trojans went 56-60 and did
not make the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby has spent the last six years rebuilding the program to the
point where that shot was finally going to be forgotten.</TE>
<TE>   Until Thursday, when it happened again, a loss that pushes the
program dangerously backward, with three star seniors leaving, with
potential recruits watching.</TE>
<TE>   In Thursday's newspaper, this columnist wrote that Bibby's
contract deserved to be extended before brilliant tournament success
convinced another school to steal him.</TE>
<TE>   Next thing you'll know, I'll be writing that this is a UCLA
football town.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what they were thinking," Seahawk Coach Jerry
Wainwright said. "I know what we were thinking."</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans could have been still drained from last weekend's
Pac-10 tournament, as their hustling style doesn't always fit into
four games in eight days.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it affected Sam, I could see it in him all week," Bibby
said of Clancy, who ended his career by scoring a team-leading 21
points but missing half of his 10 free throws.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans could have simply misjudged the Seahawks, then
couldn't figure out how to regroup.</TE>
<TE>   "You could see the difference between our players and their
players," said Seahawk Brett Blizzard. "I saw that panicked look."</TE>
<TE>   Bibby's constant hectoring might have also taken its toll, as the
Trojans lost their composure and confidence under fire.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still building the program, we still have some flaws, you
saw that," Bibby said, hopefully speaking for a group that includes
himself.</TE>
<TE>   Once a national championship contender, today the best that can be
said for the 2001-02 Trojans is also one of the saddest.</TE>
<TE>   Hey, they were good.</TE>

<HD>Commitment to Tarkanian Is Truly for Better or Worse</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>Liking Jerry Tarkanian, rooting for him even when his players weren't
graduating or sometimes even going to class, when they'd be arrested
or suspended, when his team was on probation or headed there, has
always been a guilty pleasure.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the sleazy image of his players in a hot tub with a
convicted sports fixer, the academic shortcomings in most of his
programs, the players who tried their luck with samurai swords as
weapons of destruction, despite his career-long battle with the NCAA
and all the recruiting irregularities, Tark was hard to root against.</LD>
<LD>   Apparently, Tarkanian, 71, will retire today from his job coaching
Fresno State. Temple Coach John Chaney seemed to make the
announcement for Tarkanian on Wednesday night. After Chaney's Temple
team had eliminated Tark's Bulldogs from the NIT, Chaney grabbed a
microphone and told the Selland Arena crowd in Fresno how much they
were going to miss Tarkanian.</LD>
<TE>   And it was Cincinnati Coach Bob Huggins, speaking during NCAA
tournament media day, who quickly put his finger on why so many
people will miss Tark.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what Tark gave us was the idea that anybody can think
they have a chance," Huggins said Thursday. "Some of the places he
went to, Tark never should have had a chance. He goes to Long Beach
and he challenges UCLA and USC for superiority on the West Coast.
That shouldn't have happened. He went to Vegas. They didn't even have
a gym in Vegas."</TE>
<TE>   It always seemed best to know as little as possible about how Tark
put together a team. Kind of like it being better not to know how
sausage is made--if you knew, your stomach would turn.</TE>
<TE>   Tark's teams were like that.</TE>
<TE>   He'd take them to NCAA tournaments, a collection of hard guys
who'd had hard lives and who were proud to be loathed by the NCAA. If
the world wanted to look at Tark's players as thugs or
nonstudent-athletes or unworthy of being on the same court as Duke or
UCLA or Kansas or North Carolina, that was fine with Tark and his
players.</TE>
<TE>   The conundrum about Tark was always whether he was to be admired
for taking kids others wouldn't stomach, giving them a chance,
offering opportunities where others saw only trouble, for proudly
exposing the NCAA as hypocritical, for flouting rules publicly that
others flouted secretly; or whether he was to be disdained as the
epitome of what is wrong with college sports, for his lowering of
standards instead of his giving of chances, for his encouragement of
cheating instead of his advocacy of the underdog.</TE>
<TE>   There's never been an argument about whether Tarkanian always
followed NCAA rules. Of course, he didn't. Tark's point always was
that neither did anybody else, mostly.</TE>
<TE>   Tark has always wanted to take rough-edged basketball players and
make them winners. He wanted his kids, who wore tattered jeans and
worn sneakers, to beat the other kids, the ones at the fancy places,
the ones wearing designer suits and alligator shoes, the ones who
flew on university charters and who were always on TV. He wanted his
kids to win because they played harder, tougher, more desperately.</TE>
<TE>   If he broke rules, if he brought to college some basketball
players who weren't students, if he brought onto campus some bad kids
who resisted redemption and committed crimes, if he excused
overzealous alumni as good-hearted citizens trying only to help an
underprivileged teenager, Tark could still come off as the good guy.</TE>
<TE>   The first real notice of Tark for many of us came back in 1977 at
the Final Four in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   The Nevada Las Vegas fans were so noncollegiate in their red
windbreakers and deep tans, with almost every man wearing a pinkie
ring and with seemingly so little connection to college basketball,
especially when they were standing in the hotel lobby next to North
Carolina fans and their suit coats and sense of history.</TE>
<TE>   And the way Tark's Runnin' Rebels played basketball, at such a
fast pace, with such desperate ferocity and with such a purpose. Who
were those guys? Were they the uncoachable punks who some saw or were
they amazingly focused underdogs with righteous anger on their side?</TE>
<TE>   One day, at another NCAA tournament, Tark stood in a hotel lobby
talking to the national media on the eve of a Kentucky-UNLV game.
Tark was passionate as usual. There was no way, he said, that UNLV
could ever compete with a program such as Kentucky's. The NCAA
wouldn't let it happen. The power structure wouldn't let it happen.</TE>
<TE>   But Tark made it happen.</TE>
<TE>   His UNLV teams of the early 1990s were a "program." There was a
national title and another finals appearance. Tark's teams were
playing the Dukes, the Kentuckys, the North Carolinas. They were
equal.</TE>
<TE>   And then we found out how the sausage was made. The NCAA got Tark.
Probation came, Tark spent an unhappy partial season in the NBA, then
an unhappier time in retirement.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to college, to Fresno State, his alma mater, and the
Bulldogs played ferociously and the players got in trouble and Tark
kept railing at the NCAA and how the collegiate powerhouses were
never going to let the UNLVs or Fresno States make it to the top. As
Tark was always fond of saying, NCAA investigators could always find
their way to Vegas or Fresno but never to Westwood.</TE>
<TE>   If Tark had coached Gonzaga this year and the Bulldogs had gotten
worked over with that No. 6 seeding instead of a No. 2 or No. 3, Tark
would have gone bonkers, would have called out the NCAA officials,
would have made it a crusade to mock every member of the NCAA
selection committee. If Tark had coached the 25-5 Butler Bulldogs
this season, when the Bulldogs were left out of the NCAA tournament,
his indignation would have made even the selectors flinch.</TE>
<TE>   What a delicious thought this would be--if Tark could be invited
to join that NCAA selection committee. If only his voice yelling,
"Give the little guy a chance," could be heard. Or if only Tark could
be invited to join the NCAA enforcement committee so that every time
an NCAA investigator went searching at a UNLV, one would go searching
at a "program." Tark using his power for "good" instead of "evil."</TE>

<LD>AT PITTSBURGH</LD>
<LD>   Pittsburgh vs. Central Connecticut State: Pitt, playing at Mellon
Arena one mile from campus, is expected to roll despite uncertainty
over star point guard Brandin Knight, who is questionable because of
a strained right quadriceps and sprained finger. The Panthers have
been spectacular under Coach Ben Howland and are 53-0 against teams
from the Northeast Conference, which produced plucky Central
Connecticut State. The Blue Devils have the nation's longest winning
streak at 19 games and are led by potential NBA draft pick Corsley
Edwards, a 6-foot-9, 275-pound center.</LD>
<LD>   California vs. Pennsylvania: Forward Ugonna Onyekwe, who landed at
Penn after wiggling out of a letter-of-intent signed with Long Beach
State, was Ivy League player of the year and might be the dominant
player in this game. He averages 17.5 points, 6.0 rebounds and
enables the Quakers to play a decidedly un-Ivy League up-tempo style.
Seven players have led Cal in scoring in the last month. Who will
step up? Three-point-shooting forward Joe Shipp or slashing guard
Brian Wethers? Freshmen phenoms Jamal Sampson and Amit Tamir or savvy
veterans Solomon Hughes and Shantay Legans? Most fans here hope none
of the above, because they eagerly anticipate a Pitt-Penn
second-round matchup.</LD>

<HD>It's Not Special for Kent St.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Tribune News Services</BD>
<DL>GREENVILLE, S.C.</DL>
<LD>Kent State yawned.</LD>
<LD>   The Golden Flashes thoroughly outplayed an Oklahoma State team
from a more recognized and supposedly more rugged conference, led
almost wire to wire against a higher seed in a 69-61 victory Thursday
and, afterward, acted as if they just beat the last-place
Mid-American Conference team.</LD>
<LD>   "From our standpoint, it's probably not an upset," said guard
Trevor Huffman, who scored 18 points.</LD>
<TE>   "It wasn't anything special," said forward Demetric Shaw, who led
all scorers with 21 points.</TE>
<TE>   No. 10 seed Kent State's victory over seventh-seeded Oklahoma
State in a first-round game in the South Region was not an
eye-popping score. It was merely another Golden Flash in the pan, a
win in a string of wins, the 19th in a row for Kent State (28-5) and
the 24th win in its last 25 games.</TE>
<TE>   After leading by as many as 15 points in the first half, the
Golden Flashes held off the Cowboys (23-9) in the second half. They
never allowed Oklahoma State to get closer than four points. With
1:03 left, the Cowboys cut the deficit to four at 64-60 on Iva
McFarlin's layup.</TE>
<TE>   On the next possession, Huffman traveled and gave Oklahoma State
an opportunity to get closer. But Kent State forward Eric Thomas
stole a pass from Cheyne Gadson, who had dribbled into trouble. The
Golden Flashes made five of six free throws to seal a first-round
victory for the second consecutive year. Last season, they beat
Indiana, 77-73.</TE>
<TE>   Kent State has not lost since Buffalo claimed a 66-65 home victory
over the Golden Flashes on Jan. 9. Since then, it has put together
the longest winning streak in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "They are a good basketball team," Oklahoma State Coach Eddie
Sutton said. "I don't care if you say they're from a mid-major
conference."</TE>
<TE>   Forward Fredrik Jonzen led Oklahoma State with 19 points but the
Cowboys only got three from Maurice Baker, their best player, who
struggled with groin and ankle injuries all season.</TE>
<TE>   Alabama 86, Florida Atlantic 78--On this day, the difference
between a No. 2 and No. 15 seed was one player. Fortunately for the
Crimson Tide and unfortunately for the Owls, that player was Maurice
Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Williams scored a career-high 33 points, grabbed 10 rebounds and
had six assists to lead the surprisingly timid Crimson Tide past
Coach Sidney Green's Owls.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you play 19 games in the SEC, I don't think you ever play
nervous," said Williams, a freshman who played with surprising poise.
"You get use to that. You get used to anything."</TE>
<TE>   Even with Williams' superb game, Alabama (26-7) did not pull away
until the end. The game was tied at 64 with 6:45 remaining before
Alabama forward Rod Grizzard made a three-pointer to start a 10-0
run.</TE>
<TE>   Florida Atlantic (20-12), playing in its first NCAA tournament,
could not overcome the spurt. Orlando native Raheim Brown had 15
points and 10 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Alabama plays Kent State Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Duke 84, Winthrop 37--While the rest of the contenders for the
national title flirted with trouble and sweated through near upsets,
the Blue Devils--the top seeded team in the South Region--walloped
the Eagles (19-12). The 47-point margin tied the school record for
the most lopsided victory in an NCAA tournament game. It was also the
fourth-most lopsided game in NCAA tournament his-</TE>
<TE>   tory.</TE>
<TE>   Winthrop Coach Gregg Marshall gave his wife a thumbs-up before
tip-off and blew a kiss to his 3-year-old daughter Maggie in the
stands, who blew one back.</TE>
<TE>   But that's the most fun Marshall would have all night with his
club playing only 85 miles from campus.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Boozer, Mike Dunleavy and Jason Williams, Duke's three
All-Americans, combined for 55 points. The Blue Devils (30-3) had
built a 20-point lead 7:20 into the game. The score was 52-15 at
halftime and 60-19 early in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame 82, Charlotte 63--The No. 8-seeded Fighting Irish got
20 points each from Matt Carroll and Ryan Humphrey, and 19 from David
Graves to defeat the 49ers and win back-to-back NCAA openers for the
first time in 23 years.</TE>
<TE>   The last time was in 1978 and 1979 under Digger Phelps.</TE>
<TE>   "It's huge for us, not just to go to the tournament, but win the
first round," Notre Dame Coach Mike Brey said. "It's great. These
guys have worked hard and they deserve it."</TE>
<TE>   Graves, a senior, has spent four years listening to fans and
classmates talk about Notre Dame beating UCLA in 1974 to end the
Bruins' 88-game winning streak. "That's all you hear about," he said.
"Notre Dame making history. We want to make history here before we
go."</TE>
<TE>   A victory Saturday over Duke would also do it. The Irish (22-10)
haven't gone to the round of 16 since 1987, also with Phelps. Brey,
incidentally, was an assistant to Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski for
eight seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte (18-12) had won its previous four opening-round games.</TE>

<KH>WEST REGIONAL No.8 UCLA VS. No.9 MISSISSIPPI Tonight, 7 p.m.,
Channel 2</KH>
<HD>Bruins Fearing Freshman Errors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>Is Steve Lavin's job security determined by top UCLA administrators,
the ivory-tower suits no one ever sees?</LD>
<LD>   Or does it lie in the far less steady hands of freshman point
guards Cedric Bozeman and Ryan Walcott?</LD>
<LD>   The coach had better hope the Bruins' performance in the NCAA
tournament--starting tonight against Mississippi--is a trivial matter
to Chancellor Albert Carnesale and Vice Chancellor Pete Blackman
because the largest patch of green on this St. Patrick's Day weekend
will be in the UCLA backcourt.</LD>
<TE>   "You hope that by this time the freshmen have become like
sophomores," Lavin said. "The level of competition we've played, the
travel, the tough conference games, should all have helped by now."</TE>
<TE>   Visiting Bracketville without an experienced point guard almost
always results in an early exit. Yes, Arizona won the NCAA title in
1997 with freshman Mike Bibby following Coach Lute Olson's commands.
But mature guard play usually separates the contenders from the
pretenders.</TE>
<TE>   A team with a senior at the point, even when that senior is 5 feet
5, holds a distinct advantage. Mississippi (20-10) is that team;
Jason Harrison is that short, savvy senior.</TE>
<TE>   "Harrison is the player who steps up, he's an extension of their
coach," Lavin said. "He's a tough competitor, a fighter, who gets the
key steal or shot."</TE>
<TE>   Bozeman and Walcott, in contrast, have committed many of the
turnovers and missed some of the shots that kept UCLA (19-11) from
winning close games recently. The Bruins have other problems, to be
sure, but none seem less curable.</TE>
<TE>   Bozeman will start, as he has 14 of the last 15 games. Walcott
will play at least 10 minutes off the bench, as he has in 11 of the
last 15 games.</TE>
<TE>   Bozeman, a 6-6 high school All-American from Santa Ana Mater Dei,
averages 3.8 points on 42.5% shooting and has made only six of 20
free throws. He has 81 assists and 60 turnovers, including a
season-high six miscues in the loss to California last week.</TE>
<TE>   He spent the week watching film of his few strong performances and
Thursday pronounced himself relaxed and prepared.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm ready to start a clean slate in the tournament," he said.
"I'm ready for this and I'm looking forward to it. I'm feeling real
loose."</TE>
<TE>   Walcott, a 6-1 redshirt freshman whose development as a role
player has been a pleasant surprise, is also confident after making
four of five shots and playing a season-high 26 minutes in the
first-round Pac-10 tournament loss to Cal. He averages 2.2 points on
42.9% shooting and has 28 assists and 30 turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm playing good at the right time," he said. "I've got to take
care of the ball. That's all I've been thinking about."</TE>
<TE>   There is little doubt Bozeman and Walcott will develop into
excellent players given time. Lavin likes to point out that former
Bruin standout point guards Earl Watson, Baron Davis, Tyus Edney and
Cameron Dollar also endured rough times as freshmen.</TE>
<TE>   But the future might be now for the embattled coach, who, despite
a six-year winning percentage of 69.6% and an NCAA tournament
appearance every season, is under intense criticism.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA was ranked No. 5 in the preseason and picked to win the
Pacific 10 Conference. Instead, the Bruins finished sixth in the
conference--worst in school history--and enter the tournament
unranked.</TE>
<TE>   A loss to Ole Miss would mean their first season with less than 20
victories since 1987-88.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my most challenging season as a coach for many reasons,"
Lavin said. "And my biggest challenge has been being patient with
freshman guards.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they can be effective [against Mississippi]. Cedric poses
match-up problems with Harrison, and Ryan gives us speed and
quickness."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA is more experienced at every other position. Senior center
Dan Gadzuric could dominate against the three-guard, two-forward
Mississippi lineup. And the Bruins usually win when guard Billy
Knight and forwards Matt Barnes and Jason Kapono shoot well.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins held a spirited practice at Mellon Arena on Thursday,
going full tilt during a scrimmage that had guard Rico Hines flying
onto press row after a loose ball and Barnes getting poked in the eye
by reserve Andre Patterson.</TE>
<TE>   "They probably think we are soft prima donnas from Westwood,"
Hines said. "We have to set the tone and be the first to dive after a
ball and be the first to get out running."</TE>
<TE>   The players reminded themselves that beating Kansas and
Alabama--teams seeded No. 1 and No. 2 in the tournament--proves they
can play with anyone. And they insist that their road loss to
Villanova on Feb. 9 is now a positive because it simulated this trip.</TE>
<TE>   "It helps to play cross-country against someone out of your
conference," Barnes said. "Having little time to prepare, being on
national television, it's the kind of experience we needed before the
tournament, especially our young guys."</TE>
<TE>   That would mean the freshman point guards, who today hold Bruin
fortunes in their hands.</TE>

<HD>Arizona Beats Santa Barbara</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALBUQUERQUE</DL>
<LD>UC Santa Barbara had a legitimate shot at Arizona.</LD>
<LD>   No one can ever say Mark Hull didn't take his best one in an 86-81
loss.</LD>
<LD>   Hull made eight of 11 three-pointers--an astonishing six of six in
the first half--and finished with 32 points in the Gauchos'
first-round NCAA West Regional loss to Arizona on Thursday night at
the Pit.</LD>
<TE>   Santa Barbara was making its first NCAA tournament appearance
since 1990, but the Gauchos didn't look like rookies.</TE>
<TE>   They led by three at halftime, then fell behind by 11 in the
second half.</TE>
<TE>   But with 17 seconds left in the game, they trailed by only three
after Chrismen Oliver drained a three from the right side.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona (23-9) got the ball to Salim Stoudamire--the freshman who
shoots 92% from the line--and he made the first two of his four free
throws down the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara (20-11) quickly scored inside to cut the lead back
to three, but Arizona once again got the ball to Stoudamire, and he
gave the Wildcats a five-point lead with four seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obvious with this one and the other games today, this is a
matter of survival," Arizona Coach Lute Olson said. "We survived--not
by much, but we survived."</TE>
<TE>   They survived to advance to a second-round game Saturday against
Wyoming--an upset winner over Gonzaga.</TE>
<TE>   Hull was playing with a broken nose--an injury he suffered in the
Big West semifinals against UC Irvine--but he didn't miss a
three-pointer in the first half, and he didn't miss his second until
only 3:27 remained in the game.</TE>
<TE>   He needed only 13 shots to score 32 points, and didn't miss in
eight trips to the foul line.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess I was just feeling it. Usually if I hit one [three],
that's enough for me to get going," said Hull, whose previous high
was seven threes in a game.</TE>
<TE>   His third miss came with 1:20 left--with a chance to cut it to
one.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara shot 59% from three-point range, making 16 of 27.</TE>
<TE>   Olson faulted his players for not moving well without the ball in
the first half, when they shot 32%. They did better in the second,
and shot 59% over the final 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Rick Anderson and Stoudamire made consecutive threes
with a little less than eight minutes left, Arizona led by 11.</TE>
<TE>   But Santa Barbara didn't quit. The lead was six with three minutes
left, four with two.</TE>
<TE>   And after Nick Jones picked up a loose ball at Arizona's end and
sprinted to the other end to make a layup and get fouled, the lead
was only two with 1:44 left.</TE>
<TE>   He missed the free throw, but Santa Barbara was in the game.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Gardner finished with 28 points--including four of seven
threes--and five assists, and Anderson had 19 points and nine
rebounds. Luke Walton had 11 points and seven assists.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara's visit is over.</TE>
<TE>   "It was sad in the locker room," Coach Bob Williams said. "When
CBS was in the locker room, we [held it together]. After CBS got out,
it was tough."</TE>

<DH>Charting The Lead: a look at the Trojans' lead or deficit
by the minute</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What happened: Mostly bad stuff for the Trojans. They were fortunate
they were behind only 37-28, because it could have been worse than
that. You name it, it happened ... early foul trouble for Sam Clancy,
poor team defense, inadequate shot selection, poor ballhandling.
Henry Bibby had to sit there with a really pained expression on his
face, as though he had been forced to down one of those shards of
mushy red stuff they sold as hot dogs at the concession stands. As
Tom Hansen, the Pacific 10 commissioner, commented at halftime:
"There's no next week if you don't get it done now." Actually, Tom,
there will be a next week and a tournament, it's just that it was
starting to look as if neither one would include the Trojans.</LD>
<LD>   Not in the box score: What happened to the Trojan team that
performed so well in the Pac-10 tournament last week? The hustle and
poise that led to victories over Stanford and Oregon apparently were
left at Staples Center. Perhaps the Trojans should have spent more
time thinking about the Seahawks than about a possible third-round
matchup with Duke.</LD>
<LD>   Winning number: That would be 51.7% shooting from the floor by the
Seahawks (15 for 29).</LD>
<TE>   Wrong number: There are actually two--35% shooting (11 for 31) by
the Trojans; and two fouls by Clancy.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Wilmington--Craig Callahan, Brett Blizzard 7;
USC--David Bluthenthal 7.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Wilmington--Anthony Terrell 6.
USC--Bluthenthal 5.</TE>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>David Bluthenthal was the first to go.</LD>
<LD>   Than came Brandon Granville.</LD>
<LD>   And when Sam Clancy fouled out with 1.7 seconds remaining in USC's
93-89 overtime loss to North Carolina Wilmington Thursday night, it
made for a cruel twist in the way the three senior starters ended
their collegiate careers.</LD>
<TE>   Coach Henry Bibby had called them the cornerstones of USC's
basketball renaissance.</TE>
<TE>   I'm just thinking about my first college practice," a red-eyed
Bluthenthal whispered in the Trojan locker room after the loss, "and
how quickly it all went."</TE>
<TE>   Granville, a four-year starter, wasn't surprised that they had all
fouled out.</TE>
<TE>   "Not with the way we play," Granville said. "All of us sitting
there, that's what happens when you play as aggressive as we do."</TE>
<TE>   Clancy, meanwhile, was more worried about "letting our USC fans
down" than reflecting on his career at USC.</TE>
<TE>   "It hasn't hit me yet," Clancy said.</TE>
<TE>   The three have left a mark on USC's record book, though, as they
all rank in the school's top 12 in career scoring.</TE>
<TE>   Clancy is third in scoring (1,657), first in blocks (195) second
in rebounding (835) and fifth in steals (134).</TE>
<TE>   Bluthenthal is 12th in scoring (1,313), third in three-pointers
(171), sixth in steals (116) and 10th in rebounding (755).</TE>

minutes (4,043), assists (779), three-pointers (218) and steals
(229).</TE>
<TE>   Clancy ices his legs the night before home games and thought of
doing it Wednesday night. But after USC's light practice Wednesday
afternoon, he nixed the idea.</TE>
<TE>   "There came a point during halftime when I just felt them [tire],"
Clancy said of his legs. "Now, they're just exhausted."</TE>
<TE>   Clancy missed a couple of layups and put-backs at the start of
overtime that he normally would have dunked, had he been on fresher
legs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was USC's sixth first-round tournament exit and first since
1997, when the Trojans lost to Illinois 90-77.</TE>

<DH>Charting The Lead: a look at the Trojans' lead or deficit
by the minute</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What happened: For such a great comeback--coming back from 19 points
down to tie it with Errick Craven's clutch three-pointer from the
corner with seven seconds left--it ended up as nothing but a bitterly
disappointing loss for the Trojans. You could build a case that it
was their worst NCAA tournament defeat ever, not by their margin of
defeat, but the fact that they lost to a much lower-ranked team.
Maybe the Trojans used all their strength just getting back in the
game, because they missed some easy shots to start the overtime when
momentum was clearly in their favor. Just knock down a couple of easy
shots and the Seahawks might have woken up to the fact that 13th
seeds weren't supposed to be so close to winning.</LD>
<LD>   Not in the box score: How close did Craven come to stealing the
ball with a minute left in overtime and a sure-fire dunk waiting for
him at the other end? The answer: Very close. And one more thing.
What was the hangtime that Stewart Hare had with that dunk that made
the score 87-83 in overtime? Even though they might have the ugliest
uniforms of any team in the tournament, the Seahawks never once lost
their poise.</LD>
<LD>   Winning number: Wilmington, the sixth-highest scoring team in the
CAA (67.1), goes for about 26 more than it averages.</LD>
<TE>   Wrong number: 0--The number of games Clancy has left at USC. For
such a great player, he deserves more.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Wilmington--Callahan, 11. USC--Clancy, 15.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Wilmington--Callahan 5. USC--Clancy 4,
Granville 4.</TE>

<LD>Darius Songaila, a senior, and Vytas Danelius, a freshman, are from
Lithuania, but Wake Forest Coach Skip Prosser knows where he would be
without them.</LD>
<LD>   "On a bus to the airport," Prosser said.</LD>
<LD>   Songaila had 18 points and five rebounds in 32 minutes against
Pepperdine and Danelius came off the bench to pull down eight
rebounds in 21 minutes.</LD>
<TE>   Listed at 6 feet 9 and 248 pounds, Songaila doesn't look that big,
but he plays a power game under the hoop and defends the other team's
center.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's just say I feel very confident when the basketball is in
Songaila's hands," Prosser said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was the first NCAA tournament victory for Wake Forest since
1997, when Tim Duncan led the Demon Deacons.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Dawson, a senior, didn't get to play in the NCAA tournament
last year, so he made his tournament debut against Pepperdine.</TE>
<TE>   "Sitting on the sidelines, with an injury, not being able to play
[and then] as soon as I saw our name go on the board last Sunday, it
was very gratifying just knowing that I was going to be able to play
in my first NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "When I got there, all the emotions that I expected to have came
immediately. It was just a great feeling to get a win."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Guard Broderick Hicks said the scouting report on Pepperdine was
correct.</TE>
<TE>   "All week long, the coaches stressed keeping them in front when we
are on defense and when we are on offense to be patient, not take the
first shot you see, just make the extra pass," he said. "We knew they
weren't a patient team, they're a good team, but they have a lot of
athletes, a lot of scorers, and if we stayed patient, maybe we could
get them nervous or out of their game. So we owe that to our coaches.
They did a great job in preparing us."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Prosser probably had the best analysis of the game:</TE>
<TE>   "We got off to a good start, a less-than-scintillating middle and
a very, very satisfying finish."</TE>

<LD>NC Wilmington, represent!</LD>
<LD>   The Seahawks, champions of the Colonial Athletic Assn., have their
conference's initials stitched on their shorts. They stamped them on
this NCAA tournament with their first-round upset of USC, and struck
a blow for some of the overlooked teams.</LD>
<LD>   "The difference between the major schools and the mid-major
schools is getting closer and closer," Seahawk star Brett Blizzard
said. "The biggest thing is it gives other schools like us
confidence. Other people can do it too.</LD>
<TE>   "I think people know where Wilmington is now. It's not in
Delaware, it's in North Carolina."</TE>
<TE>   Added teammate Ed Williams:</TE>
<TE>   "This is the year the mid-majors are rising. Ball State really
started it for the mid-majors by beating Kansas and UCLA in Hawaii
[at the beginning of the season]. Even though we're not getting the
publicity, we can rise to the occasion just like any Big Ten team or
Big 12 team."</TE>
<TE>   The Seahawks made a quick departure in their first trip to the
NCAA tournament in 2000, bowing to Cincinnati in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   This year, "We came here with the right attitude," Blizzard said.
"We didn't come here with our cameras and stuff like we did the first
year. We didn't talk about it. We did it."</TE>
<TE>   Williams tried to dunk on USC's Sam Clancy twice and Clancy made
two spectacular blocks. Williams even gave Clancy five after the
first block.</TE>
<TE>   "He got me," Williams said. "He's bigger than me, but I'm not
going to back down."</TE>
<TE>   The Washington Wizards have held training camp on the Wilmington
campus the past two years. It's the hometown of Michael Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   "You know when you see somebody that you've been idolizing
forever, when you see them for the first time, you can't say
nothing?" UNC Wilmington forward Anthony Terrell said. "You just drop
your mouth. He came and spoke to us, I didn't say a word. The second
time, when he came back to play, I saw him again, I talked to him."</TE>

<LD>Travis Hansen scored 20 of his 23 points in the second half to lead
Brigham Young to a 78-55 win over UC Irvine on Thursday night in the
first round of the National Invitation Tournament at Provo, Utah.</LD>
<LD>   BYU (18-11) broke the game open in the second half, scoring eight
of the first 10 points to go ahead, 46-30. UC Irvine (21-11) had no
answer for Hansen, who scored 12 of the Cougars' first 14 points in
the second half.</LD>
<LD>   BYU trailed by as many as eight points in the first half, but
outscored Irvine, 25-7, over the final 8:54 to take a 10-point lead
at halftime. UC Irvine got as close as eight points in the second
half, but BYU made a 12-3 run to open its biggest lead, 58-41, with
10:03 to play.</LD>
<TE>   Adam Parada and Jordan Harris led the Anteaters with 13 points
each. Jerry Green, UC Irvine's leading scorer with an average of
20.6, was held to 12 points.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Bigelow added 15 points for BYU, which stretched its
nation-leading home-court winning streak to 36 games. The Cougars
also have won 27 consecutive games at home against nonconference
opponents. BYU will play Memphis in the second round.</TE>
<TE>   In other first-round games:</TE>

the score at 38 when Mike Monserez made a three-point basket with 2.8
seconds to go.</TE>
<TE>   Villanova 84, Manhattan 69--Gary Buchanan had 17 of his 22 points
in the second half as the Wildcats shook off a slow start to win at
Villanova, Pa. Villanova (18-12) did not score for the first 7:10 and
turned the ball over 14 times in the first half to trail, 33-27, at
halftime before rallying.</TE>
<TE>   Villanova will play the winner of tonight's game between Louisiana
Tech and Vanderbilt.</TE>
<TE>   Luis Flores matched a career-high with 33 points for Manhattan

<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Style of play: Undersized Mississippi uses an aggressive man-to-man
defense and a motion offense heavy on screens. Guards Jason Harrison
and David Sanders like to slash to the basket and pass to forward
Justin Reed. The Rebels run few post plays, which should help UCLA
center Dan Gadzuric stay out of foul trouble. UCLA will employ its
1-4 set offense as well as the motion that has been sporadically
successful the last three weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Matchup to watch: Jason Kapono vs. Aaron Harper. Sanders, the best
Mississippi defender, probably won't defend Kapono because he is only
6 feet 3. That will leave the less tenacious 6-7 Harper to hold down
the Bruins' leading scorer. If his teammates set screens, Kapono
could get plenty of open shots. Harper, however, is Mississippi's
best three-point shooter and could give as good as he gets.</LD>
<LD>   Intangibles: Both teams are coming off Sweet 16 appearances, yet
finished the regular season in disappointing fashion. The team able
to regroup during the last four days of practice will win.</LD>
<TE>   Magic numbers: UCLA has a significant height advantage. Harrison,
the Mississippi point guard, is 5-5 and will be matched against 6-6
Cedric Bozeman. And 6-8 Rebel post player Derrick Allen must contend
with the 6-11 Gadzuric.</TE>
<TE>   Final analysis: Provided freshman point guards Bozeman and Ryan
Walcott don't make too many mistakes, the Bruins should win behind
Gadzuric's post presence and Kapono's perimeter shooting.</TE>

<LD>AT PITTSBURGH</LD>
<LD>   Cincinnati vs. Boston University: This tuneup should add another
victory to Cincinnati's school-record total and provide the Bearcats
with a running start before facing UCLA or Mississippi on Sunday.
Cincinnati was unranked in the preseason and lost its opener to
Oklahoma State, then rattled off 20 victories in a row. All-American
point guard Steve Logan, one of three senior starters, averages 22
points. Guard Immanuel McElroy and forward Jamaal Davis are excellent
defenders and freshman forward Jason Maxiell provides a spark off the
bench. Boston, the America East conference co-champion, will try to
slow the tempo and rely on guard Chaz Carr and forward Billy Collins
to make shots.</LD>

<TE>   AT DALLAS</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma vs. Illinois Chicago: Not only is Oklahoma a heavy
favorite to win its first-round game, it will also be the clear-cut
fan favorite of this sub-regional as thousands of Sooner fans drove
to Dallas. Coach Kelvin Sampson's rugged club hopes it is on a
collision course with No. 1 seed Cincinnati in next week's regional
final in San Jose. Like many undersized teams, Illinois Chicago
relies on the three-point shot, with guards Cedric Banks (14 points)
and Jordan Kardos (12.5 points) the most frequent gunners.</TE>
<TE>   Xavier vs. Hawaii: The Musketeers have one of the best, yet
unheralded, players in the country in second-team All-American
forward David West (18.5 points, 9.8 rebounds, 2.5 blocks).
First-year Coach Thad Matta's conservative suit-and-tie look will be
in sharp contrast to the wild, colorful shirts worn by Hawaii Coach
Riley Wall.</TE>

<LD>So much for that mammoth Gonzaga-Arizona second-round game.</LD>
<LD>   Gonzaga is one and done after a 73-66 upset at the hands of
Wyoming in the NCAA West Regional at the Pit.</LD>
<LD>   For once, Dan Dickau didn't come to the rescue, and all Gonzaga's
shooting stars fizzled.</LD>
<TE>   Now the team that made the Sweet 16 the last three seasons is
going home early after Wyoming used a ferocious defense and brilliant
free-throw shooting down the stretch to upset the No. 6-ranked team
in the nation--and the controversially sixth-seeded team in the West.</TE>
<TE>   "The success this team's had the last few years, people said,
'Yeah, Gonzaga's going to the Sweet 16,'" said Dickau, who scored 26
points but made only seven of 24 shots, four of 14 from three-point
range. "But you've got to go play the basketball game. We played
well, we just didn't hit shots.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, I still believe we're one of the 10 best teams in the
country, after seeing everything out there. We just didn't hit shots
today."</TE>
<TE>   Wyoming (22-8) will play Arizona in the second round Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Wyoming played from slightly behind most of the game, but went
ahead, 61-60, on two free throws by Donta Richardson with 2:52 left.</TE>
<TE>   The lead was 63-62 when Wyoming's Uche Nsonwu-Amadi missed a shot
inside--but a monster follow-up dunk by Josh Davis put the Cowboys
ahead by three with 1:06 left, and Wyoming made its free throws down
the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   The Zags (29-4) shot only 31.4%--and made only 22% from
three-point range, making eight of an astonishing 36 attempts. The
Zags hadn't shot less than 40% all season.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a lot of baskets popcorn in and out on us," Coach Mark Few
said. "But we understand as good as anybody, it's loser-out,
do-or-die."</TE>
<TE>   Nsonwu-Amadi led Wyoming with 14 points.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State 69, Davidson 64--The Wildcats, seeded 13th, nearly
pulled off a Davidson-beat-Goliath story, leading for most of the
first half before losing a game that was in doubt until the final
moments.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth-seeded Ohio State (24-7) managed to avoid being upset in
the first round for the second year in a row, mostly because of guard
Brian Brown's career-high 33 points.</TE>
<TE>   Center Martin Ides--a Czech who is one of seven international
players on Davidson's roster--led Davidson (21-10) with 20 points.</TE>
<TE>   Missouri 93, Miami 80--The Tigers knew it was never as good as the
No. 2 ranking it once held during the season--and quickly proved it
was never as bad as the No. 12 seeding it earned in the NCAA
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers bolted to a 12-0 lead on their way to an upset of
fifth-seeded Miami, holding off a mild charge when the Hurricanes got
as close as five in the first half. Missouri started the second half
with an 11-4 run to turn an eight-point lead into a blowout.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't want this thing to end," said Missouri guard Clarence
Gilbert, who led the Tigers with 20 points despite making only four
of 16 shots. (He was 10 of 11 from the line.) "You want to play as
long as you can."</TE>
<TE>   Missouri (22-11) held Miami (24-8) to 33.8% shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Miami was led by forward Darius Rice, who scored 17 points but
made only three of 15 shots, and by center Elton Tyler, who also
scored 17.</TE>

<HD>Will Huskies Turn the Field to Mush?</HD>
<DH>Women's basketball: Connecticut favored in NCAA tournament,
but that doesn't mean no one else has a chance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sixty-three teams not named Connecticut are told they have no chance
of beating the Huskies in the NCAA women's basketball tournament.</LD>
<LD>   But they'll play the tournament anyway, starting today.</LD>
<LD>   Realistically, there are a few teams that could upset the 33-0
Huskies, the No. 1 team in the country, or at least give them a
game.Start with Duke (27-3). The Atlantic Coast Conference champion
is the top-seeded team in the East and comes into the tournament on a
school-record 18-game winning streak. It ranks second nationally in
scoring (84.9 points a game) and three-point shooting (40.8%).</LD>
<TE>   The Blue Devils are young; Coach Gail Goestenkors often starts
three sophomores, a junior and a freshman, and has only one senior on
the roster. She also has a developing superstar in 5-foot-11
sophomore guard Alana Beard (19.3 points, 6.1 rebounds, five
assists). And Duke has not faced Connecticut this season, so there is
no baggage. But the two teams' paths can't cross until the title
game.</TE>
<TE>   Another contender is red-hot Oklahoma (27-3), the Big 12 champion
and the top-seeded team in the West.</TE>
<TE>   Like Duke, the Sooners have a brilliant playmaker: 6-foot senior
Stacey Dales (16.7 points, five assists and five rebounds). The
Sooners have won 13 of their last 14, and lost to Connecticut so long
ago (Dec. 22) it's a fuzzy memory. The only real road block in their
bracket is second-seeded Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinal (30-2) spent several weeks ranked second behind
Connecticut, had a 22-game winning streak and would have been seeded
No. 1 in the West if it hadn't lost to Arizona State in the Pacific
10 tournament final.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford's irresistible force is 6-2 sophomore Nicole Powell (15.9
points, 9.3 rebounds, 6.1 assists). She can play any position, but is
strongest at small or power forward where her lack of quickness isn't
as glaring.</TE>
<TE>   The "if" with Stanford is 6-1 guard-forward Lindsay Yamasaki, its
leading scorer (17.4) who missed the Pac-10 tournament after surgery
for appendicitis.</TE>
<TE>   If Yamasaki can come back and play at a high level, Stanford is a
Final Four threat. If she can't, Stanford may have difficulty
reaching the Elite Eight.</TE>
<TE>   Vanderbilt (27-6) and Tennessee (25-4) are worthy challengers that
also lost to Connecticut in the regular season. Their biggest problem
is being in the same region, the Midwest, which is so loaded that
perhaps neither will make it to the Final Four in San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   The regular-season Southeastern Conference champion Lady Vols--who
have been in every NCAA tournament since the women's event began in
1982--are directed by 5-9 junior guard Kara Lawson (16 points, five
rebounds).</TE>
<TE>   The return of 6-2 junior Gwen Jackson from a shoulder injury will
boost Tennessee. She fortifies a frontcourt anchored by two 6-5
towers, senior Michelle Snow and sophomore Ashley Robinson.</TE>
<TE>   But neither Snow nor Robinson is the biggest or best center in
their conference. That distinction belongs to 6-6 junior Chantelle
Anderson (21 points, six rebounds), who carried the Commodores to the
SEC tournament title. Anderson has plenty of help from 6-2 senior
forward Zuzi Klimesova (16 points, seven rebounds) and 5-5 junior
point guard Ashley McElhiney, who led Vanderbilt with 40
three-pointers.</TE>
<TE>   All those teams have the on-any-given-day capacity to upset
Connecticut.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara (25-5), which plays against Louisiana Tech (25-4)
today, and Pepperdine (23-7), which faces Villanova (19-10) on
Saturday, don't have such lofty expectations. Not when neither team
has ever gotten past the second round. Although both would love a
chance to play Connecticut in San Antonio, it's more important to the
Gauchos and Waves to win in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   The Huskies are after more than just a third national championship
in eight years. Only three teams--Texas (1986), Connecticut (1995)
and Tennessee (1998)--have completed undefeated NCAA seasons.
Connecticut would tie Tennessee's NCAA record of 39 wins in a season
should it run the table.</TE>
<TE>   Connecticut has a starting five more than one opposing coach has
called the best ever.</TE>
<TE>   The impact of seniors Sue Bird, Asjha Jones, Swin Cash and Tamika
Williams and sophomore Diana Taurasi goes beyond statistics. They are
a selfless unit that can beat you whether your game is run-and-gun,
half-court, physical or nothing but three-pointers. It is conceivable
the seniors--led by Bird, the leading candidate for player of the
year--could be the first four picks in this year's WNBA draft.</TE>

<HD>To Ignite Interest in Books, L.A. Is Urged to Read
'Fahrenheit 451'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn launched a citywide reading
initiative Thursday, urging all residents to read a copy of Ray
Bradbury's science fiction classic "Fahrenheit 451" and participate
in neighborhood book groups being organized during April.</LD>
<LD>   The "One Book, One City L.A." initiative, modeled after similar
programs in Seattle and Chicago, is designed to encourage literacy
and promote civic pride. Los Angeles' inaugural program features the
mayor's favorite book.</LD>
<LD>   Bradbury wrote "Fahrenheit 451" in nine days in 1953, using
pay-by-the-hour typewriters at the UCLA Library. Set in a future
world in which the written word is forbidden and firemen burn books,
the novel is about censorship and rebellion.</LD>
<TE>   "At its core, 'Fahrenheit 451' celebrates freedom of speech,
freedom of thought, the value of imagination and the power of the
individual," Hahn said at a news conference Thursday morning at the
downtown Central Library. "Those are values that we stand for and
that epitomize the city of Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Bradbury, 81, never went to college; he educated himself in Los
Angeles' libraries. As a teenager, he walked from his home at Pico
Boulevard and Western Avenue to the downtown library, where he would
spend hours poring over literature. The author said he feels honored
that "Fahrenheit 451" is going to be featured in libraries across the
city.</TE>
<TE>   "This book has been such a close part of my life," Bradbury said.
Libraries throughout the city have stocked up on copies of
"Fahrenheit 451" and will host 10 discussions about the novel in
April. Barnes &amp; Noble Bookstores and the Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf will
also host book groups.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, 500 copies of the text were donated to Los Angeles
school district high schools by Ballantine Books, and Supt. Roy Romer
is encouraging all ninth- and 10th-graders to read the book.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn and Bradbury will host a meeting April 8 with a group of
students at the El Portal Theater in North Hollywood to discuss the
themes of free speech and social justice in "Fahrenheit 451."</TE>
<TE>   Later in the month, the city library will sponsor a reading of
banned and burned books, and the New Beverly Cinema will show the
1966 movie "Fahrenheit 451." The program will conclude with a reading
by Bradbury at the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books at UCLA on
April 27.</TE>
<TE>   More information about the program, including a study guide,
schedule of events and chapters of "Fahrenheit 451" by e-mail, can be
found at www.lapl.org/F451.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Excerpt From Chapter 1: It Was a Pleasure to Burn</TE>
<TE>   "Do you ever 'read' any of the books you burn?"</TE>
<TE>   He laughed. "That's against the law!"</TE>
<TE>   "Oh. Of course."</TE>
<TE>   "It's fine work. Monday burn Millay, Wednesday Whitman, Friday
Faulkner, burn 'em to ashes, then burn the ashes. That's our official
slogan."</TE>
<TE>   They walked still farther, and the girl said, "Is it true that
long ago firemen put fires 'out' instead of going to start them?"</TE>

<HD>2 Hurt in Attack; Man Is Arrested</HD>
<DH>Crime: He's accused in knife attack on his estranged wife
and her boyfriend's father in North Hollywood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREA PERERA and JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man was arrested Thursday after he allegedly broke into his
estranged wife's North Hollywood home, slashed her throat and stabbed
her boyfriend's father in the head with a kitchen knife, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The couple's 14-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son witnessed the
stabbings, and the daughter was cut on a hand when she tried to
protect her mother, said Sgt. John Pasquariello of the Los Angeles
Police Department's North Hollywood Division.</LD>
<LD>   Diane Lopez, 31, was in critical condition at County-USC Medical
Center with a gash to her throat, and her boyfriend's father, Hector
Salgado, 60, was in serious condition at Providence Holy Cross
Medical Center in Mission Hills, hospital spokeswomen said.</LD>
<TE>   Gaspar Perez Lopez, 36, was arrested on suspicion of attempted
murder, police said. He is being held at Van Nuys Jail in lieu of
$2-million bail.</TE>
<TE>   Perez Lopez went to his estranged wife's home in the 7300 block of
North Beck Avenue about 8 a.m. to take one of their five children to
school, police said. He returned to the house soon afterward and
asked to enter, but Lopez refused, police said.</TE>
<TE>   "That angered him to the point where he grabbed some large rocks
and started bashing in the front bedroom window, which faced the
street," Pasquariello said.</TE>
<TE>   As Perez Lopez climbed in, Lopez, Salgado and the two children ran
to a bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   About 8:20, a woman in the house, who investigators believe was
Lopez, called police to report the break-in. A few minutes later,
police received a second call, from the daughter, who said her father
was trying kill her mother.</TE>
<TE>   Perez Lopez broke down the bathroom door and began to attack
Lopez, police said. When Salgado tried to intervene, Perez Lopez
brandished a 9-inch kitchen knife, cutting Salgado on the head and
neck and slashing Lopez's throat, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Police arrived a few minutes later to the sound of the children's
screams and arrested Perez Lopez on suspicion of attempted murder,
authorities said. It was unclear Thursday where Lopez's boyfriend and
the two other children were during the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime residents of the neighborhood said Lopez and Perez Lopez
moved in two years ago, and separated six months ago when he moved to
Las Vegas for a job.</TE>

<LD>A preliminary hearing for actress Winona Ryder, who is accused of
shoplifting about $4,700 in merchandise from a Beverly Hills
department store, has been postponed until next week, authorities
said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The hearing, originally scheduled for Thursday, is expected to
provide the first public glimpse of the entire security videotape on
which authorities have said Ryder can be seen removing anti-theft
devices from store items and stuffing them in a bag.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities charged Ryder last month with second-degree commercial
burglary, grand theft of personal property, vandalism and possession
of a controlled substance.</LD>

<HD>An Unusual Advocate Tries Pitch in Mexico</HD>
<DH>Immigration: Entrepreneur Carlos Olamendi will present his
vision of emigre rights to President Fox.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When President Vicente Fox meets a group of U.S. residents in Mexico
this week, Orange County restaurateur Carlos Olamendi will be among
them, lobbying for immigrants' rights.</LD>
<LD>   The Republican from Laguna Niguel wants immigrants like himself to
have the right to vote in Mexican elections and to be able to cross
the border freely. But he opposes government assistance, such as
welfare or housing subsidies to immigrants and others. Instead of
invoking the name of former Gov. Pete Wilson, who tried to crack down
on illegal immigration during his tenure in the 1990s, Olamendi says
Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush are his role models.</LD>
<LD>   He promotes a U.S. immigration policy that he said "will allow
immigrants to pull themselves up instead of relying on the welfare
model," a term he uses to refer to the network of government and
social service agencies in the United States that give assistance to
the poor.</LD>
<TE>   Olamendi has become a regular at meetings with legislators in
Mexico City and Washington, pushing for measures to give Mexican
immigrants a greater voice in the two countries. Immigrants should be
able to vote in Mexico because they provide one of the greatest
sources of foreign exchange through remittances to family members, he
contends.</TE>
<TE>   Although some may view his positions as contradictory, Olamendi
says he is living his beliefs. He invests in U.S. restaurants that
sell food made from his mother's recipes. He also has a capital
investment project to provide companies with credit in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   To critics who wonder how he can simultaneously salute the White
House and Mexico's presidential seat of power, Los Pinos, he quips,
"We are not going home. We are already here. That's the new reality.
We [immigrants] are a thread tying two nations together."</TE>
<TE>   Olamendi and his group, the National Council of Mexican American
Professionals and Business Leaders, have repeatedly visited Mexico
City to push for a law that would allow emigrants to vote by absentee
ballot.</TE>
<TE>   This week, they are bringing nearly 100 people to meet with Fox,
congressmen, election officials and cabinet members, said Omar de la
Torre, director of Mexico's federal Office of Migrant Assistance. The
group has advocated for voting rights before. Now, however, they have
Fox's support. The Mexican legislature has yet to back a proposal.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, the Mexican Chamber of Deputies passed a law allowing
Mexicans outside the country to vote in the 2006 presidential
election, but the Senate did not approve the measure. The law did not
specify how migrants, some of whom obtained so-called dual
nationality after becoming American citizens, could vote, and the
issue was never formally taken up again.</TE>
<TE>   Luis Pelayo, president of the Hispanic Council in Chicago, will be
part of Olamendi's group. He said Olamendi's presence will help
garner interest in the measure again: "He's one of the most important
supporters of Mexicans and their right to vote in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "He has an important vision of what affects Mexicans. There's no
contradiction in what he advocates. He comes from the poverty that
many immigrants come from. He's a self-made man with a vision of what
others can do."</TE>
<TE>   Olamendi, 46, came to the United States illegally as a teenager
and worked in restaurants, earning $2.25 an hour. He received a law
degree in Mexico, then returned to the United States illegally to be
near his dying mother.</TE>
<TE>   He followed in the footsteps of his brother, who had opened a
restaurant in Capistrano Beach in 1973, and opened his own Olamendi's
in Laguna Beach in 1985. He later sold it to a sister. He became a
legal U.S. resident through the 1986 amnesty law, and later sought
citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   Now a father of two children, ages 7 and 12, he owns Olamendi
Express restaurants in Laguna Hills, Mission Viejo and Rancho Santa
Margarita, as well as larger Olamendi's restaurants in San Clemente
and Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, he started COR International, a capital financing company
that offers U.S. financing to Mexican firms at lower rates than are
available in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent visit to Mexico, Olamendi met a priest who told him
how coffee growers in Chiapas state were unable to profit on their
crops. So he began investing in cooperatives representing 1,500
Chiapas coffee producers. He said the coffee, to be known as Maya
Magic and instant Cafe El Encanto, will be imported and sold in U.S.
markets this spring.</TE>
<TE>   The investment will make him money, he said, but he believes it
also could stave off migration from one of the poorest regions in
Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Closer to home, Olamendi has invested in three immigration
counseling centers in Santa Ana, Fresno and Salinas. The centers help
immigrants regularize their U.S. status, for a fee.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a very successful businessman who is concerned about what's
happening in the community," said Miguel Angel Isido, the Mexican
consul in Santa Ana. "The way he thinks is not conventional.... He
sees that without [immigration] papers, people can't develop
themselves and participate."</TE>
<TE>   Olamendi's persistent attention to Mexican immigrants and their
culture has not gone unnoticed. Recently, he was one of 36 people
nominated by President Bush to the Presidential Advisory Committee on
Arts and Culture for the John F. Kennedy Performing Arts Center last
week. Members serve as long as Bush is president.</TE>
<TE>   Olamendi says he owes his success to Ronald Reagan, who was
president when the immigration amnesty was approved, and to
Republican legislators he lobbied for immigration laws to give
Mexican families the ability to get residency for their members. He
also applauds Bush for his proposals to legalize more Mexican workers
in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "I was fortunate to get residency through amnesty," Olamendi said.
"Your life changes so drastically. You can go out on the street and
walk with confidence. We could get loans, deal with businesses. It
was incorporation into the real life of the United States.</TE>
<TE>   " I realized that our community must be legitimized for people to
get ahead."</TE>

<HD>2 Will Vie for County Clerk Job</HD>
<DH>Runoff: With no clear winner last week, voters must choose
between candidates Phil Schmit and Yvonne Gallegos Bodle in November.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Assistant County Recorder Phil Schmit and Board of Education Trustee
Yvonne Gallegos Bodle will face off in a November runoff election to
decide who becomes the next county clerk, Ventura County elections
officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Schmit, who is backed by retiring clerk Richard Dean, was the top
vote-getter among the six candidates in the March 5 primary, taking
34.4% of the vote.</LD>
<LD>   When no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote, however, the
top two contenders compete in a runoff on the general election
ballot.</LD>
<TE>   Initially, Oxnard City Clerk Daniel Martinez appeared to have
edged out Bodle for the second spot.</TE>
<TE>   But in final returns, which also took into account 10,000 absentee
and provisional ballots, Bodle was the second-highest vote-getter,
with 157 votes more than Martinez, or 20.1% of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Bodle credited her 81-year-old mother for helping her into the
runoff.</TE>
<TE>   "She was out at shopping malls, senior citizens' places and
trailer parks with her friends passing out my campaign materials,"
Bodle said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Mom did the trick for me."</TE>
<TE>   The county clerk oversees local elections, issues marriage
licenses, assembles agendas for the Board of Supervisors, records
property transactions and keeps vital county statistics such as
births and deaths.</TE>
<TE>   Dean's replacement will grapple with whether to change the
county's punch-card ballot system, which is old-fashioned but has a
relatively low error rate. The next clerk also will be under pressure
to bolster safeguards for county documents to minimize cases of
identity theft.</TE>

<HD>School's Traffic Problems Years Old, Neighbors Say</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE ANTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Residents on a cul-de-sac adjacent to Centralia Elementary School say
they have complained to school officials for years that parents
dropping off and picking up their children have caused traffic
congestion and safety problems on the street.</LD>
<LD>   The daily logjam, residents of Grant Circle say, is caused by the
lack of parking at the school's main entrance, the site of Tuesday's
one-car accident that killed two students.</LD>
<LD>   Parents who cannot get into the driveway/parking lot where Bianca
Perez, 7, and Nidia "Liz" Curiel, 6, were killed pour into narrow
Grant Circle in Buena Park, where a pedestrian gate allows access to
school grounds.</LD>
<TE>   "It's an accident waiting to happen," said Dave Kirby, who has
lived on the street 15 years. "There are times when 40 to 50 cars are
stacked up. People can't get in and out.... The designer of the
school created a nightmare for the residents."</TE>
<TE>   The problem began several years ago when booming student
enrollment led Centralia to reopen after years of being closed.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the street's 28 households have petitioned the school
twice to shut the gate.</TE>
<TE>   And Buena Park police have issued hundreds of citations during
periodic crackdowns on double parking.</TE>
<TE>   Parents also have complained about traffic and safety problems in
the driveway area when they pick up and drop off their children.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not empty complaints," said school spokeswoman Colleen
Bragalone.</TE>
<TE>   She said school officials have encouraged parents not to use Grant
Circle and have occasionally called police. But the gate will remain
open, Bragalone said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not ignoring their complaints. We're trying to work out the
best compromise for everyone," she said.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear whether the crowding had anything to do with the
fatal accident.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim police Thursday continued to investigate but had yet to
re-interview the driver, Maria Juarez, 50, of Anaheim. State records
show Juarez has a driver's license. She got a speeding ticket in
November 1999 and has had two minor accidents.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service for Bianca Perez will be held at 1:30 p.m.
Sunday at Victory Baptist Church, 227 N. Magnolia Ave., Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   A service for Nidia Curiel will be held at 9 a.m. Tuesday at La
Iglesia Luz del Mundo, 512 Santa Ana Blvd., Santa Ana.</TE>

<HD>Neighbor to Be Tried in Girl's Death</HD>
<DH>Court: Judge sets March 28 arraignment for David
Westerfield in the Danielle van Dam case. Defense focuses on parents'
lifestyle.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>David Westerfield was ordered Thursday to stand trial for the
kidnapping and murder of 7-year-old Danielle van Dam in a case that
will depend heavily on DNA evidence.</LD>
<LD>   The decision by Superior Court Judge H. Ronald Domnitz came after
a three-day preliminary hearing in which prosecutors presented
evidence that small traces of the child's blood were found on
Westerfield's jacket and recreational vehicle and that her
fingerprints were found in the same vehicle.</LD>
<LD>   "The crimes in this complaint have been committed," Domnitz said.
"I have reasonable cause to believe Mr. Westerfield is guilty of
them."</LD>
<TE>   Westerfield, 50, a self-employed design engineer who lives two
doors away from the Van Dam family in the upscale Sabre Springs
neighborhood, listened impassively as Domnitz made his ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Arraignment was set for March 28. Prosecutors may announce at that
time whether they will seek the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield also is accused of possession of child pornography,
the charge stemming from material that police seized from his
computer.</TE>
<TE>   The judge's decision was announced after a day of testimony in
which Westerfield's attorney, Steven Feldman, questioned the Van Dams
about their lifestyle, saying that such information will show that
numerous people had access to their house and that the Van Dams were
not forthcoming to police about their lifestyle.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue here is alibi and third-party access to the residence,"
Feldman said.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes tearful, sometimes indignant, Brenda van Dam testified
Thursday that she was drinking, dancing, playing pool and smoking
marijuana at a local bar the night before she discovered Danielle was
missing.</TE>
<TE>   Van Dam, 39, said that she also smoked marijuana in her garage
before going to the bar and that she left open a side door to the
garage so that the smoke would clear out.</TE>
<TE>   Police have suggested in court documents that Westerfield could
have used the open door to sneak into the house and kidnap Danielle
while Brenda van Dam was at Dad's bar in Poway and her husband,
Damon, was at home with the couple's three children.</TE>
<TE>   Damon van Dam, 36, a software engineer, testified that he had
smoked marijuana in the garage before Brenda went to the bar.</TE>
<TE>   Major points of contention between prosecution and defense, which
came out during the hearing, are the extent of the relationship
between Westerfield and Brenda van Dam, and whether the Van Dams were
under the influence of marijuana the night of Feb. 1 and therefore
their memories cannot be trusted.</TE>
<TE>   Brenda van Dam testified that she talked to Westerfield at the
bar, introduced him to two female friends and then accepted his offer
to buy them drinks.</TE>
<TE>   But under questioning by Feldman, she denied dancing with
Westerfield, being affectionate with him or inviting him to share her
marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   She said she returned home with two female friends and two male
friends, not including Westerfield, about 2 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The four friends left after a few minutes and, the Van Dams
testified, they went to bed. Shortly after 9 the next morning, said
Brenda van Dam, she discovered that her daughter was missing from her
bedroom and within minutes placed a panicky call to police.</TE>
<TE>   The child's nude, badly decomposed body was found 25 days later on
Feb. 27 by volunteer searchers. Westerfield, based on DNA evidence,
had been arrested Feb. 22.</TE>
<TE>   During the three-day hearing, Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Dusek
portrayed Westerfield as having sexual fantasies about young girls
and having been rebuffed by Brenda van Dam's female friends. The
prosecution alleges that Westerfield left the bar in Poway before Van
Dam, went to her home, kidnapped and killed Danielle, and then dumped
the girl's body in a rural area 25 miles away.</TE>
<TE>   Feldman contends that Danielle's blood found on Westerfield's
jacket and recreational vehicle could have been left there several
days earlier when she was playing "hide and seek" with young friends
and could have been caused by a scratch from the Van Dam family dog.</TE>
<TE>   Brenda van Dam testified that she barely knows Westerfield but
that the same week Danielle disappeared, she and Danielle had gone to
his home to ask him to buy Girl Scout cookies.</TE>
<TE>   During that meeting, she said, Westerfield asked her for her phone
number and said he liked to host barbecues and "adult parties."</TE>
<TE>   Feldman sought to question Brenda and Damon van Dam about whether
they engage in a "swinging" lifestyle that includes extramarital sex.</TE>
<TE>   The judge blocked Feldman from asking about the "swinging"
lifestyle: "Counsel, I don't see how this is relevant at all."</TE>
<TE>   But Domnitz left open the possibility that during Westerfield's
trial, defense attorneys can quiz Danielle's parents about their
marriage, drug use and sexual habits.</TE>
<TE>   At the hearing Feldman tried to ask whether the couple had
discussed divorce and whether Damon van Dam had a sexual relationship
with one of his wife's friends.</TE>
<TE>   But the judge ruled that the questions were irrelevant.</TE>
<TE>   Brenda van Dam bristled when Feldman asked her whether her husband
was acting as a "baby-sitter" for their children while she went to
the bar with her friends.</TE>
<TE>   "I would not consider Damon to be a baby-sitter," she said. "I
would consider him to be their father."</TE>
<TE>   Under Feldman's questioning, she said she is taking medication for
depression and anxiety. In reply to several questions--including an
inquiry about how often she smokes marijuana--Van Dam said she could
not remember.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been through a lot and there's a lot I don't recall," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the Saturday morning she discovered Danielle missing,
Van Dam said, "Before I knew it, it was total chaos. A lot of people
on the street started searching for Danielle. Neighbors came out to
help in any way they could. One of the neighbors made missing-child
fliers."</TE>

<HD>Dealer Who Sold Guns to Police Is Felony Suspect</HD>
<DH>Weapons: Figure in a probe of possible illegal buys by L.A.
officers already faces charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GLOVER and MATT LAIT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A gun dealing dentist from Burbank who already faces felony weapons
charges stands at the center of an investigation into potentially
illegal purchases of assault weapons by Los Angeles police officers,
according to documents and interviews.</LD>
<LD>   LAPD detectives are investigating "the illegal purchase of at
least 20 assault weapons by LAPD personnel" from dentist Lawrence
Wolff, according to an investigative report from the state Department
of Justice. The precise number of officers whose actions are being
investigated is unclear.</LD>
<LD>   Wolff, a licensed dealer of machine guns and assault rifles, was
charged last month in Orange County with a number of weapons
violations, including conspiracy to offer an assault weapon for sale.</LD>
<TE>   Charged with Wolff was Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy
Kresimir Kovac, who was seeking to become a federally licensed law
enforcement gun dealer like Wolff. Both men have denied any
wrongdoing. An attorney for Wolff said that the Los Angeles Police
Department is out to get his client.</TE>
<TE>   The men were charged in Orange County because Kovac lives in
Fountain Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The charges against Wolff and Kovac stem from an undercover
operation by the state Department of Justice in which an informant
was recruited to buy illegal assault weapons from Wolff.</TE>
<TE>   As part of a multi-agency probe into Wolff's gun business, agents
from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in December seized
hundreds of documents from Wolff's home detailing sales of assault
rifles to police officers. Wolff lives in Burbank and his dental
office is in Encino. Like many gun dealers, Wolff sells firearms as a
sideline business. Some of those documents are suspected of having
been fraudulently prepared by LAPD officers in order to illegally buy
assault rifles.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD officials said they have been investigating gun transactions
by officers since last June. State law forbids the sale of assault
weapons, but has an exception for any police officer "authorized by
his or her employer to possess or receive the assault weapon."</TE>
<TE>   To meet the requirements of the law, an officer must present a
letter on the letterhead of his or her department giving approval to
purchase the weapon. The letter must be signed by a superior.</TE>
<TE>   Any officer who faked a letter to obtain an assault weapon could
be guilty of a felony and face LAPD discipline, according to state
laws and Police Department guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   Wolff's attorney, Robert Walters, said his client had no idea that
documents offered by LAPD officers may have been altered.</TE>
<TE>   Walters added that he is suspicious about the timing of the
criminal charges against his client, who could become a witness
against any LAPD officer who might have illegally purchased an
assault weapon from him. "They're trying to muddy up my client,"
Walters said. "The LAPD is trying to make someone else the bad guy."</TE>
<TE>   According to documents, state investigators enlisted an informant
to buy illegal assault rifles from Wolff. The informant had been
arrested for selling illegal handguns during another sting operation.</TE>
<TE>   When the informant made contact, Wolff refused to deal with him,
officials said. The informant persisted, phoning Wolff several times
to convince Wolff to give him a contact who would sell him an assault
rifle, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Wolff told the informant that he knew someone who could
do so. That someone, according to documents, was Kovac.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors alleged that Kovac initially made the transaction but
then backed out of it after becoming suspicious of the informant.</TE>
<TE>   Kovac, who has pleaded not guilty, has been relieved of duty
without pay pending the outcome of the investigation, said his
lawyer, Melvyn Sacks. Sacks said his client was working for Wolff and
was misled by his boss into believing that the weapons were properly
registered and legal.</TE>
<TE>   Kovac, a recent nominee for the Sheriff's Department's Medal of
Valor with seven years on the force, is charged with one count of
conspiracy to offer an assault weapon for sale, one count of
illegally offering for sale or selling assault weapons and 18 counts
of illegal possession of an assault weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Like Kovac and the officers he sold to, Wolff had ties to law
enforcement. Although he lives and works in Los Angeles County, he
has served as a reserve officer for the Orange County Sheriff's
Department. Wolff was dismissed from the department Dec. 11, one day
after the raid on his home, said agency spokesman Jim Amormino.
Amormino declined to say what caused his dismissal.</TE>
<TE>   Wolff's reserve position did not allow him to make arrests or
carry a gun. He was, however, given a special reserve badge
emblazoned with the county's insignia.</TE>
<TE>   Wolff sat on a panel of volunteers that reviewed the Sheriff's
Department's firearms policies and was in charge of developing a
class for the public in gun safety.</TE>

<HD>Celebrating 30 Years of Offering Youths Guidance and Fun</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>Francisco Naja is not taking karate lessons at the Hollenbeck Youth
Center for fists of fury.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm 41," said Naja, who would look more comfortable in a western
than a martial arts film. "Forty-one and I have a purple belt. My
kids already have purple belts."</LD>
<LD>   "I joined after they joined," said Naja, who takes lessons three
days a week at the Boyle Heights facility with his 10-year-old son,
Francisco, and his daughter, Rocio, 7. "I do it to keep my kids
motivated. If they see their old man doing this, it shows them that
anyone can."</LD>
<TE>   The Najas are a few of the more than 7,000 people annually who use
the Hollenbeck Youth Center. On Thursday, a blend of past, present
and future--about 300 people in all--celebrated the center's 30 years
of supplying inner-city youth with safety and guidance.</TE>
<TE>   The center provides an extensive array of programs and activities
designed to build self-confidence and self-reliance in local children
and youth, director Daniel Hernandez said. His motto: "Construction
not destruction."</TE>
<TE>   The center started off as a boxing club for youngsters that was
tucked away in the basement of the Los Angeles Police Department's
Hollenbeck station, said Rudy Deleon, one of the founders and former
Hollenbeck captain.</TE>
<TE>   The current building, the old Hollenbeck station, opened in 1977
and by 1998 it had expanded into a 30,000-square-foot center with a
basketball court, boxing ring and weight room. It also offers
computer training and programs geared toward at-risk youths, such as
trips to colleges and cultural institutions. Its operating budget has
also increased--from $30,000 annually to about $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest factors in the center's success is the support
of the Hollenbeck station and business leaders, LAPD Chief Bernard C.
Parks said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great motivator to know about the kids that came out of
here," said Parks, who has worked closely with the center since 1986.
"And it's not just boxers. We have electricians, doctors, lawyers and
college graduates."</TE>
<TE>   Coming back is always special for Mario Barragan, a volunteer at
the center. Although he lives in Hacienda Heights, Barragan, an
electrician, comes back to help Hernandez with the Inner City Games,
which have grown from a local event to a nationwide movement headed
by Arnold Schwarzenegger and operating in 15 cities.</TE>
<TE>   Barragan, 31, first came to the gym when he was 12, but most of
the time he stood outside, watching the other kids play basketball.
His mother persuaded him to go in.</TE>
<TE>   "I eventually started coming and continued for years," he said. "I
knew it was better for me to be inside the center than being on the
streets. My mom always told me, 'Go play basketball,' so I did."</TE>
<TE>   But the center will always be known for boxing. That's how it all
started, said Paul Gonzales, Olympic gold medalist and one of the
first boxers to use the center.</TE>
<TE>   Now retired, Gonzales was in his groove Thursday, talking jabs and
uppercuts with 1984 Olympic teammate and fellow gold medalist Henry
Tillman. "Man, Paul, you were a bad dude in the days. I remember that
one guy ... man, you beat him bad," Tillman told Gonzales, recalling
a fight at the Pan-American Games. "I remember I had to hold you
back."</TE>
<TE>   "No, you were bad. This guy beat Mike Tyson twice," Gonzales told
the crowd. Back then, Gonzales was a super flyweight, and Tillman was
a heavyweight who defeated Tyson in Olympic trials.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzales, 36, is a trainer at the center, but also helps out in
other ways, such as with events for senior citizens. "It's not only
about boxing for me," he said. "I love this place. This is home."</TE>

<HD>Police Warn of Robbers Posing as the LAPD</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Authorities warned Maywood residents on Thursday about a group of men
posing as police officers and committing home invasion robberies.</LD>
<LD>   The men sometimes wear black "raid" jackets and black baseball
caps with the LAPD logo, said Maywood police Sgt. Mark Van Holt.</LD>
<LD>   The first crime occurred about 10:30 p.m. on Feb. 12, when several
armed men entered a home as the resident was going to bed, said Van
Holt. They shoved the man to the floor, bound his hands and ransacked
his home.</LD>
<TE>   About 11:15 p.m. on March 6, a resident answered a knock on his
door and was confronted by two men, Van Holt said.</TE>
<TE>   "They shined a flashlight into his eyes and told him they were the
police," Van Holt said.</TE>
<TE>   The robbers entered the residence and bound the man's hands, Van
Holt said. The man's girlfriend and her two children were also in the
home. No one was hurt. The men fled with money, jewelry and
electronic items.</TE>
<TE>   "Residents should make sure that officers are wearing a standard
police-type uniform with an identifiable badge that should have the
city or county name on it from the agency they represent," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with more information is urged to call Maywood police at
(323) 562-5005.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is intended to be a beacon of compassion and succor, cultivated,
no less, by the powerful and well-connected sheriff of Los Angeles
County.</LD>
<LD>   Lee Baca's idea is to build an open-air homeless shelter downtown
near his department's Twin Towers jail to keep the destitute from
returning to that lockup.</LD>
<LD>   But the proposal is meeting surprising resistance from the very
community that should be expected to support it most: activists for
the homeless.</LD>
<TE>   With the downtown Los Angeles project in the early planning
stages, city officials and neighborhood groups have expressed
concerns about the proposed shelter's impact on the surrounding
community--concerns that proponents dismiss as classic NIMBYism: not
in my backyard.</TE>
<TE>   But more telling has been the reaction of many of downtown's most
prominent nonprofits serving the homeless. They contend that the
estimated $9 million it would cost to buy property and build the
complex could be better spent improving and expanding existing
programs.</TE>
<TE>   "Although we applaud the sheriff's effort, we want to move away
from the homeless maintenance model to the [homelessness] eradication
model," said Pete White, a program manager with the Los Angeles
Coalition to End Hunger and Homelessness. "If we're going to build
anything, let's build affordable housing, habitable places for
folks."</TE>
<TE>   If the Homeless Public Safety Center is built, it would mark one
of the few innovative, if controversial, attempts in many years to
tackle homelessness in a city notorious for the size of its transient
population.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 11,000 homeless people inhabit downtown Los Angeles,
according to government and private data, many squeezed into a
squalid, 20-square-block skid row area clustered with overcrowded
shelters and missions.</TE>
<TE>   A sizable number of people, however, choose to sleep on the street
rather than enter a traditional shelter because they fear being a
target of violence or refuse to accept zero-tolerance alcohol and
drug rules or required religious services. Many are mentally ill and
cannot get treatment and medications.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed complex, to be operated by the nonprofit Volunteers
of America independently of the Sheriff's Department, is designed to
attract about 200 such "service-resistant" people to the proposed
four-acre complex.</TE>
<TE>   Canvas-topped pods similar to circus tents would be arrayed in a
park-like setting with a central kitchen, laundry and bathroom
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   The pods would be divided into eight segments, each containing a
bed, locker and heater. The spaces could be closed off with drop-down
curtains.</TE>
<TE>   The center would place some restrictions on comings and goings and
require residents to try to get sober and stay off drugs. It would
offer mental health and medical services, substance abuse treatment,
vocational counseling and assistance in obtaining veterans' and
Social Security benefits.</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department has a practical stake in this. Each day,
the nearby jail releases as many as 50 people who have no home and
are at risk of being a victim or perpetrator of street crime.</TE>
<TE>   "It is too costly to have people in County Jail whose most
significant status is not that of criminal but that of a person who
has virtually no income and who's battling problems of mental illness
and alcohol and drug addiction," Baca said in a telephone interview.</TE>
<TE>   Helping the homeless, especially those who are mentally ill, has
become a personal crusade for Baca, who talks of the rights of all
human beings to live in a safe, decent, clean environment.</TE>
<TE>   It is the sheriff's passion as much as his powerful position that
has put many homeless activists who question his approach in a
pickle.</TE>
<TE>   Charles "Bud" Hayes, executive director of the Single Room
Occupancy Housing Corp., said his organization has not taken a
position on the proposed shelter. But he said he has told Baca that
many nonprofit providers want to know why such a sum couldn't be used
to fund thousands of new beds at emergency shelters or expand the
cold/wet weather shelter program.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there needs to be more discussion about this," said
Hayes. "But he is the only county law enforcement official who's ever
taken the time to make an unannounced, non-press-covered walking tour
by himself through the toughest parts of skid row and talk to people.
He has shown tremendous leadership."</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff's point person on the project, Chief Al Scaduto, is
more blunt in his assessment.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been a lack of commitment by the city and county to
address this issue," said Scaduto, sitting in his Twin Towers office
near a large scale model of the shelter encampment.</TE>
<TE>   "I keep hearing talk about rejuvenating downtown Los Angeles, but
as long as people from the suburbs have to climb over transients,
they aren't going to be comfortable coming here."</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell Netburn, the new executive director of the Los Angeles
Homeless Services Authority, said New York City, where he previously
worked, spends 12 times as much on homeless services as Los Angeles.
Many experts say Los Angeles' homeless problem is as bad or worse
than New York's.</TE>
<TE>   His agency, a joint powers authority created by the city and
county, last year had a budget of $48 million, $500,000 of it from
the city of Los Angeles and virtually all of the rest from federal
funds.</TE>
<TE>   The Housing Authority will review the proposed complex later this
month, but Baca and the Volunteers of America said they also will
seek other sources of state, federal and private funding for the
project.</TE>
<TE>   "The homeless problem in Los Angeles is incredibly serious, and we
welcome anybody willing to help out," said Netburn. "But I'm
concerned that the sheriff's proposal not be viewed as a ceiling,
[but] as something that's cheaper than building permanent housing."</TE>
<TE>   The project's supporters say it is intended to be used as a
transition for people trying to get on the road to more stable
housing outside downtown.</TE>
<TE>   They contend that naysayers may be motivated by distrust of
anything new.</TE>
<TE>   "Much of the dilemma downtown is because the existing services are
not seen as relevant by homeless people," said Bob Pratt, president
of the Volunteers of America.</TE>
<TE>   Although downtown service providers frequently work in
collaboration, they are also protective of their turf and there may
be an element of jealousy involved, both sides in the debate concede.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal is not the first untraditional approach to
homelessness in downtown.</TE>
<TE>   The 9-year-old Dome Village, near Staples Center, houses up to 24
residents in a cluster of white fiberglass domes. During the 1980s,
an open-air encampment built under Mayor Tom Bradley was widely
considered to be a failure and was later abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   The site considered for the new effort is an abandoned oil well
equipment factory on the outskirts of Chinatown. Next door is a trash
recycling center, and on the other side of the fence is a small
encampment of homeless people.</TE>
<TE>   Civic leaders in the Chinatown and Arts district say the shelter
will attract homeless people to an area where there are few problems.
Supporters argue that the shelter--whose perimeters would be
patrolled 24 hours a day-- would be a public service.</TE>
<TE>   The one thing everyone seems to agree on is that the sheriff is a
very determined man. He has won the support of a powerful ally--state
Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco)--and a
$250,000 state grant for initial research and planning.</TE>
<TE>   He has spoken with members of California's congressional
delegation and even President Bush to gather political support for
the project.</TE>
<TE>   "My biggest fear is that if we don't find the most effective plan
to help recover people who are homeless, all of this dialogue--which
I'm getting a little upset with--is not going to solve the problem,"
said Baca. "It's time to put a little muscle into this solution."</TE>

<HD>Principal Goes to Court Against Student</HD>
<DH>Van Nuys: High school chief gets a restraining order
against a special ed student who made threats. Boy's mother says he's
being shut out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARRETT THEROLF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an action characterized as highly unusual by school officials and
legal experts, a Van Nuys high school principal has persuaded a court
to grant a temporary restraining order against a special education
student who told a classmate he'd like to punch the principal.</LD>
<LD>   Birmingham High School Principal Doris Lasiter filed handwritten
papers Feb. 20 in Los Angeles Superior Court alleging that
14-year-old James Brochu told another student the previous week that
he wished he had "socked me [Lasiter] in the head."</LD>
<LD>   The court's order is at the center of a feud between the principal
and the boy's mother, who says Lasiter is preventing her son from
attending school because of behavior related to his disability,
causing him to miss 19 days since Feb. 15.</LD>
<TE>   "They don't have the right to keep my child out of school," Olivia
Brochu said.</TE>
<TE>   The boy is a special education student who is emotionally disabled
and diagnosed with severe attention deficit disorder, his mother
said. His disability has posed a disciplinary problem for the school,
records show.</TE>
<TE>   Some records evaluating James' disability and disciplinary history
were released by his mother to The Times; others were not made
available by the district, which said they are confidential.</TE>
<TE>   The available records include an assessment of James by a team of
Birmingham High School teachers, an administrator and the school
psychologist dated Feb. 21, the day after the restraining order was
issued.</TE>
<TE>   The assessment indicates that the boy has a history of verbal
threats toward teachers and fellow students but makes no mention of
violence.</TE>
<TE>   The records also indicate James was struggling to overcome his
father's death several months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Since the court order was issued, Brochu said Lasiter has barred
James from attending school, even though court records indicate that
the restraining order "does not prevent defendant's peaceful and
lawful attendance at school."</TE>
<TE>   Such action "is really a crime. It's an outrage," said Valerie
Vanaman, a legal expert in special education law. Vanaman said
federal law prohibits a school district from preventing a student
from coming to school as a consequence of behavior related to his
disability.</TE>
<TE>   Vanaman, who has represented disabled children for more than two
decades, including with the nonprofit Children's Defense Fund, said
if behavior related to the disability is recorded in the student's
individualized education program, drafted to meet the needs of those
in special education, the school is prohibited by federal law from
preventing the student from attending school.</TE>
<TE>   James' individualized education program records provided by his
mother describe behavior related to his disability, stating that the
boy "has threatened students and staff--often."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Brochu took James to Birmingham and was met by
Assistant Principal Idelle Thaler, who informed her that James had
been transferred to Aliso High, a continuation school in Reseda.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, no, you're not," Thaler said as James entered the Birmingham
attendance office Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Lasiter has declined repeated requests for an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Her supervisor, District C Supt. Bob Collins, said Wednesday he
could not remember a previous incident of this kind and didn't know
why James hadn't been attending Birmingham.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Collins said James was being transferred to Aliso
High and would be attending the school soon.</TE>
<TE>   A court-appointed mediator failed to resolve the issue Wednesday
in a closed-door session with Lasiter, James and his mother.</TE>
<TE>   Until Lasiter and James appear at a hearing April 2, the court
ordered the boy to stay at least 10 yards away from the principal and
avoid speaking to her.</TE>
<TE>   Generally, according to the district's disciplinary code, if a
school superintendent or principal determines that a student
"threatened to cause physical injury to another person," the student
may be suspended or recommended for expulsion.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we support the actions taken by our staff" in James'
situation, Collins said. "There are guidelines regarding student
discipline cases, and staff members also have the ability to take
their own actions."</TE>
<TE>   Collins said he is unsure if the district's student disciplinary
system would be fully capable of handling an incident such as James'
alleged threat without the help of the courts.</TE>

<HD>Monroe High Cadets Celebrate</HD>
<DH>Ceremony: Junior ROTC members at the school are awarded
medals for their latest triumph in a marching competition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE STASSEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As gusty winds whipped American flags, Army Junior ROTC cadets from
Monroe High School received medals on Thursday for their stellar
performance in a marching competition, marking the school's sixth
consecutive win.</LD>
<LD>   ''This is a tradition at Monroe. We've known since ninth grade
that we had to get into action and hold on to our legacy,'' said
Rachel Murphy, 17, commander of the school's 381-student battalion.
As a colonel, she is the second-highest ranking student in the Los
Angeles Unified School District's Army Junior ROTC program.</LD>
<LD>   The grueling daylong competition--involving Army Junior ROTC teams
from 16 LAUSD schools--was held in January at Monroe. Approximately
150 Monroe students practiced five days a week beginning in July to
earn a place on the 44-member team.</LD>
<TE>   ''This is a really distinguished school. They put a high priority
on this. It takes high morale to achieve this,'' said Stuart
Bird-Wilson, vice president of the British United Services Club,
which has sponsored the All-City Drill Competition since 1945.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of students attended the morning ceremony, which also
honored Roosevelt and Hollywood high schools, the second and third
place finishers.</TE>
<TE>   Uniformed color guards from each school filled the football field
while Caroline Morgan, a Monroe chemistry and physics teacher from
Great Britain, sang the British and American national anthems.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the students, accolades were bestowed on Sgt. Bruce
Murphy, who has run the program at Monroe for six years.</TE>
<TE>   ''It's due to his tremendous leadership and skills. He overcomes
obstacles and makes it happen,'' said Lt. Col. Ted A. McDonald,
director of Army instruction for LAUSD and the Junior ROTC
coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy, whose daughter commands the battalion, also expects the
school to win a comprehensive LAUSD-sponsored contest for the sixth
year in a row.</TE>
<TE>   And what about the marching contest next year?</TE>
<TE>   ''I think we can do it again,'' said Murphy. ''But the most
important thing is for them to graduate high school and feel good
about themselves.''</TE>

<HD>Kline Cites 'Honor' in Ending Bid</HD>
<DH>Election: Jurist facing molestation charge says attempt to
get off ballot doesn't mean he's guilty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County Judge Ronald C. Kline's decision to drop his reelection
bid is "the honorable thing to do" but should not be viewed as an
admission of guilt in the child molestation and child pornography
charges he faces, according to a statement released Thursday by his
defense lawyer.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement on behalf of the beleaguered Superior Court judge
is the first time Kline's camp has explained the jurist's attempt to
withdraw from the November election and offers an insight into the
toll the criminal charges are taking on him.</LD>
<LD>   The charges have inflicted "an unbearable strain" upon the judge
and caused a "serious distraction for his fellow judges in Orange
County," according to the statement released by attorney Paul S.
Meyer.</LD>
<TE>   "For these reasons, and with a complete understanding that he is
not guilty of these state charges, he asked that his name be removed
from the ballot," the statement says.</TE>
<TE>   Kline's effort to withdraw from the race stalled Thursday morning,
when Orange County's presiding judge, Frederick Horn, ruled that the
case presents an obvious conflict of interest for any Orange County
judge. The matter will be moved to Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Kline, 61, sat on the Orange County bench for six years as a
respected civil court judge until criminal charges were filed against
him last year. He continues to receive his $136,244 annual salary as
a judge, but a federal court placed him under house arrest, saying he
is a threat to children.</TE>
<TE>   If Kline fails in his bid to drop out, his name will appear on the
November general election ballot against the as-yet-unknown winner of
a write-in campaign to unseat him. If his bid succeeds, the contest
will most likely feature the top two write-in candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Though legal experts give Kline little chance of succeeding in his
effort to withdraw, Meyer on Wednesday argued that it was in the best
interest of voters to allow the judge to pull out.</TE>
<TE>   If Kline is forced to remain, "the voters of Orange County will be
harmed in that they will be asked to vote on a candidate who no
longer desires to be a candidate for judge," Meyer argued in court
documents.</TE>
<TE>   In his statement to the news media, Meyer criticized anyone who
would try to block Kline's withdrawal. "Any objection to his
request," the lawyer said, "would arise from a motive of personal
political gain and would not be in the best interests of the voters."</TE>
<TE>   County election officials have promised not to oppose Kline's
attempt to bow out, as have at least nine of the 11 write-in
candidates who opposed Kline in last week's primary, according to
court records filed by Meyer.</TE>
<TE>   Only one candidate, Dana Point attorney John Adams, has publicly
opposed Kline's withdrawal. Adams has taken an early lead with nearly
half the write-in votes counted.</TE>
<TE>   Should that trend continue, Adams would oppose Kline on the
November ballot unless the judge is allowed to drop out.</TE>
<TE>   Adams appeared in court Thursday with his own lawyer prepared to
argue that election laws prohibit Kline from removing his name from
the ballot. And he denied that political gain has played any role in
his position.</TE>
<TE>   "He signed, as did I, a sworn declaration that he would not
withdraw," Adams said, adding that if Kline were serious he would
resign from office and "stop drawing a salary from the public."</TE>

<HD>Courts Working to Keep Bankruptcies Local</HD>
<DH>Rules changes are aimed at halting 'Delaware flight' by
companies filing for Chapter 11 protection.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a phenomenon some bankruptcy lawyers refer to as "Delaware
flight"--the tendency of major corporations to file for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection in Delaware instead of their home state.</LD>
<LD>   Now, a group of Southern California bankruptcy judges and lawyers
is poised to overhaul corporate Bankruptcy Court procedures for the
21 federal bankruptcy courtrooms in California's Central District to
make them more inviting places for businesses to file for bankruptcy
protection. The changes, if approved next month, would be the first
in recent times and would, for the first time, codify courtroom
procedures for all federal Bankruptcy Courts in Los Angeles, Orange
and surrounding counties.</LD>
<LD>   Until now, bankruptcy judges have fashioned their own rules on
many matters, creating a pastiche of procedures that mystify many
lawyers and clients.</LD>
<TE>   Becoming more "bankruptcy friendly" may seem a strange goal,
especially because there are only a handful of major corporate
bankruptcy filings per year in Southern California. But backers of
the plan say there are sound reasons for the changes.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers Concede They'd Like the Extra Business</TE>
<TE>   For one, Southland lawyers admit that they'd like a bigger slice
of the bankruptcy pie. Delaware gets 60% of all major corporate
filings nationwide and a third of those in Orange and Los Angeles
counties since 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Secondly, they say Delaware filings put an unfair burden on
creditors who are forced to travel across the nation to collect
debts.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, court officers say a single set of rules will reduce
confusion among courtrooms and boost efficiency.</TE>
<TE>   "We were looking at these cases drift elsewhere at a time when
business was down to begin with," said bankruptcy lawyer Marsha Dee
Galinsky, of the Los Angeles law firm Sheppard, Mullin, Richter &amp;
Hampton.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed rules, which will be considered by the Central
District's executive committee, would permit debtors quick action on
emergency motions, such as whether to pay employees their wages in
the first days of bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, different bankruptcy judges treat such requests with
varying urgency--something that frustrates lawyers and their clients.</TE>
<TE>   "In some courtrooms, you get prompt action," Galinsky said.</TE>
<TE>   "In others, you'll call the courtroom to set a hearing for an
emergency motion and the phone call doesn't get returned until four
days later."</TE>
<TE>   The rules would also allow bankruptcy lawyers to be paid once a
month instead of once each quarter, and would allow some legal
paperwork to be done via e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   Filing May Be Local, or in State of Incorporation</TE>
<TE>   Under federal law, corporations may file for bankruptcy in either
the state in which they were incorporated, or in the state where they
are headquartered.</TE>
<TE>   Due to the perception that Delaware's corporate law is "business
friendly," many major corporations are incorporated in Delaware.</TE>
<TE>   Because Chapter 11 bankruptcies are handled in federal court, the
law governing debt restructuring is the same throughout the nation.
What differs between jurisdictions are the local court rules.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say Delaware is popular for bankruptcy filings because
courts there are perceived as being faster, more predictable and
friendlier to debtors.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few years, Delaware Bankruptcy Courts have become so
swamped that they've had to import judges from as far away as San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Whether lawyers in California represent the debtor or creditors in
a Delaware filing, the distance takes its toll, they say.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a hassle flying back and forth, both for the lawyers and the
client," says Jeffrey Golden, a bankruptcy lawyer with the Costa Mesa
law firm Albert, Weiland &amp; Golden.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that once these rules are adopted, the word's going to
get around pretty quick," said Golden, who helped draft the rules,
along with Galinsky and several others.</TE>
<TE>   Bankruptcy lawyers in California complain too that some debtors
file in Delaware in an effort to shake creditors.</TE>
<TE>   "Say somebody's owed $25,000," said Lei Lei Wang Ekvall, a partner
in Golden's firm. "That may be a lot of money to a small company, but
it's not enough to justify them flying two lawyers across the country
to try and get it."</TE>
<TE>   By considering new rules, the Central District joins a growing
list of federal Bankruptcy Courts trying to woo distressed firms who
would otherwise make tracks for Delaware. Bankruptcy Courts in
Chicago, Miami, Nevada and Texas have either adopted or are
considering such changes.</TE>
<TE>   If the rules are approved, which is likely, they would be
implemented about May 1.</TE>
<TE>   Some worry that Delaware is the wrong model for Bankruptcy Courts
to follow.</TE>
<TE>   Lynn M. LoPucki a UCLA Law School professor, says that Delaware
reorganizations are accomplished faster than anywhere else in the
nation, but that they fail more than anywhere else.</TE>
<TE>   Professor Fears Change Will Make Filing Easier</TE>
<TE>   LoPucki said California loses fewer cases to Delaware than most
other states.</TE>
<TE>   He fears that Southern California officials will make bankruptcy
reorganizations so easy for corporations that executives might not
take the tough financial steps needed to turn their enterprises
around.</TE>
<TE>   Although bankruptcy lawyers stand to benefit from the new rules,
court officials say standardization will improve the processing of
cases. They also say that the new rules are not identical to
Delaware's and that they won't turn Bankruptcy Courts here into a
rubber stamp for bankruptcy petitioners.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope it'll be a benefit to everyone involved," said U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Vincent P. Zurzolo in Los Angeles, who also helped
draft the rules. "It will make clear the appropriate procedures to
follow to obtain emergency relief in Chapter 11 cases. That's the
principal impact."</TE>

<LD>A scandal-weary Catholic cleric tells me he thinks twice about going
out in public wearing the black collar.</LD>
<LD>   A disgusted Catholic university graduate calls to say he's
short-arming the donation basket on Sunday at his Northridge parish,
"because I refuse to pay the cost of silence."</LD>
<LD>   A ticked-off Catholic school teacher e-mails me this query: "If
the Los Angeles Archdiocese can afford payouts of MILLIONS of dollars
to people who've been sexually abused by priests, why can't they pay
me a DECENT SALARY?!"</LD>
<TE>   Good question. And here's another: When are church leaders
worldwide going to wake up and realize the cross is akimbo, the roof
is on fire and the flock is headed for the exits?</TE>
<TE>   Out of Rome, we get nothing. Out of L.A., we get "no comment" when
the question is as simple as this: Did you call the police on priests
who were dismissed for allegedly abusing children?</TE>
<TE>   "It's not going to get any better until a bishop hears the clang
of a jail door closing behind him for concealing this stuff, and the
Vatican addresses the problem definitively," says attorney Jeff
Anderson, who won a $30-million settlement in a Stockton sex abuse
case. L.A. Cardinal Roger Mahony, formerly bishop of Stockton, was a
key figure in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Not a day goes by lately when I don't get at least one reader
relating a story about being sexually abused by a priest whose
proclivities were known, or should have been known, to his superiors.
Mary Grant, head of the Southern California chapter of the Survivors
Network for Those Abused by Priests, says victims are coming out of
the woodwork with horrific tales.</TE>
<TE>   I could spend day and night on these cases and not come up for air
before Christmas. But the people who caught my attention this week
weren't the abusers or the abused, but a different kind of victim.</TE>
<TE>   The good cleric. The hard-working teacher. The mothers and fathers
and sons and daughters who sit in the pews with their rosary beads,
compromised trust and feelings of betrayal.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm tired of the silence and denials," says John Lynch, a
lifelong faithful who went to Catholic schools all the way through
college at New York's Fordham University. "Enough with the tap
dance."</TE>
<TE>   Lynch, a tax lawyer and former L.A. County assessor, said his eyes
"rolled across the ceiling" Sunday when the pastor at his Northridge
church read a statement from Cardinal Mahony assuring parishioners
that the church is on top of the problem.</TE>
<TE>   It was a neatly crafted statement saying, Don't worry. But not a
word about calling the cops or whether one of the unnamed pedophiles
was in your parish, trolling for your children and grandchildren.
It's a lot of faith to ask.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not going to be able to keep infantilizing us by snapping
their fingers, like they're the gatekeepers to eternity," Lynch said.
"Catholics are fed up with cover-up, and we're not going to take it
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Lynch and I had a long chat by phone and then met to talk some
more. Like the cleric and the teacher I mentioned at the top of the
column, Lynch has chosen not to walk away from the church despite his
misgivings, and I wanted to ask why.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't the best of times for organized religion, after all.
We've got Islamic fanatics calling for the blood of infidels; Jewish
scholars wrestling with new evidence that Abraham and Moses never
existed; and the Catholic Church floating on a sea of scandal.</TE>
<TE>   So why does John Lynch, pushing 70, put on the coat and tie and go
to church on Sunday with his wife of 30-plus years?</TE>
<TE>   "You have to have belief," he said, and his belief is in something
beyond priest and pulpit; something no scandal can steal. "You have
to have some moral guardrails. If you don't believe in an authority
outside yourself, you've got problems.</TE>
<TE>   "But they've got to stop carrying on like it's the Middle Ages.
You sit there and listen, and there's no talking back. It's like
participatory fascism. They don't understand this is not the church
of our immigrant grandmothers and grandfathers. That's what they
don't get."</TE>
<TE>   Lynch wants answers and he wants changes.</TE>
<TE>   "They throw a few lower clergy to the wolves, and that's it?
You've got to figure it goes up higher than that, and this culture of
silence, this atmosphere of whispers and rumors, it's just no good
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   As his frustration has grown, Lynch has been less generous when
they pass the basket at Mass. "You don't know what you're paying
for," he said. Is it a sex-abuse settlement? Is it the cardinal's new
$200-million cathedral?</TE>
<TE>   He's hit on it now. The church won't be reformed by police, bad
press or a bout of conscience.</TE>
<TE>   But just wait until that basket starts coming up short.</TE>

<DH>St. Patrick's: County firefighters will honor fallen
colleagues by participating in New York's annual parade.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County firefighter Phil Corsi marched once before in New
York's St. Patrick's Day Parade.</LD>
<LD>   But that was two years ago, before the event turned part Irish
celebration, part Irish wake. Before St. Patrick's Cathedral became
the backdrop for a numbing string of vigils and funeral processions.
Before a terrorist plot changed New York, and the world, forever.</LD>
<LD>   So as he prepares to step onto the New York parade route again
Saturday morning, joining a contingent of local firefighters, he
knows he is in for a three-mile march weighed heavy with emotion.</LD>
<TE>   "Even before 9/11, [the parade] has always kind of been a tribute
to firefighters," said Corsi, a 30-year-old Ventura resident with
firefighting in his blood--and Irish blood in his veins.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's even more special this year," he said. "Those guys have
been through a lot, and this is our way of paying our respects."</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of firefighters from the Ventura County and Oxnard fire
departments are headed to New York to march in what is billed as the
world's oldest and most famous St. Patrick's Day parade.</TE>
<TE>   With an estimated 2 million spectators looking on, more than
300,000 marchers are expected to take part in this year's pageant,
which will make its way up Fifth Avenue, past traditional landmarks
such as St. Patrick's Cathedral and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</TE>
<TE>   The parade was first staged in 1762 by Irish soldiers serving in
the British armed forces. But it has evolved over the years into a
tribute of sorts to the city's police and fire personnel, who each
year swell the parade's ranks and infuse the pageant with a
Shamrock-green dose of municipal pride.</TE>
<TE>   This year's event is dedicated to heroes--living and dead--of the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, including the hundreds of police officers
and firefighters who lost their lives during the World Trade Center
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Edward M. Egan, head of the Catholic archdiocese of New
York, will serve as grand marshal, stopping along the route to turn
toward lower Manhattan--where the twin towers once stood--and lead
marchers and spectators in a moment of silence.</TE>
<TE>   The parade route is expected to be especially thick this year with
firefighters, not only from New York but from all over the country,
in a show of solidarity that has continued since the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County firefighters have done their part. From a bachelor
auction to breakfast fund-raisers, local firefighters have raised
hundreds of thousands of dollars for the families of the more than
300 New York firefighters who died in the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard firefighter Ralph Revelez was among those who traveled to
New York in the fall to attend funerals for fallen comrades, standing
in for firefighters busy scouring ground zero.</TE>
<TE>   He promised his New York counterparts then that he would try to
make it back for St. Patrick's Day. His plane heads east today.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just an incredible group of guys over there, and we want to
do whatever we can to show our support," Revelez said. "It's a big
fraternity, really, and we have to look out after each other."</TE>
<TE>   All the local firefighters headed to New York are using their own
time to make the trip and are paying their own way.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard firefighter Sergio Martinez is also paying to take his
6-year-old son, Julien, and his wife, Tina Marie, who is pregnant
with the couple's second child. She is due to deliver around the
first anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez, 31, has been with the Oxnard Fire Department full time
for two years and was a reservist for three years before that. He
said he was nearly brought to tears when the World Trade Center
buildings collapsed, knowing so many of his comrades were inside.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to go there, meet some of the guys and tell them if there
is anything they ever need from us, we're here for them," said
Martinez, who as a boy, growing up across the street from the Oxnard
station where he now works, dreamed of becoming a firefighter.</TE>
<TE>   "I also want to go there to see for myself," he said. "I want to
never forget how important this job is."</TE>
<TE>   Corsi wants to remember, too. It is the most important part of why
he is returning to Fifth Avenue, joining hundreds of thousands of
others--including his father, Oxnard fire engineer Fred Corsi--on the
parade route.</TE>
<TE>   "People get on with their lives, that's human nature," Phil Corsi
said. "But we can't forget. Those [New York firefighters] live with
this every day of their lives. They are still looking for their
brothers who are buried. They've been punched pretty hard and we want
to help them fight back."</TE>

<HD>Sewage Data to Be Reviewed by Scientists</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orange County Sanitation District said this week that an
independent panel of scientists will review data and reports
generated by the district's $5.1-million study to see if the sewage
discharged from pipes 41/2 miles offshore is returning to beaches.</LD>
<LD>   Last summer's study was supposed to determine if a combination of
waves, tides and a power plant's ocean-fed cooling system is drawing

<HD>New Ojai Growth Curbs Sought</HD>
<DH>Development: Activists work to get two initiatives on the
ballot. Officials fear they would halt all building.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although Ojai is already the slowest-growing city in the county, a
group of hard-core activists is pushing a pair of initiatives that
city leaders fear would effectively halt all future growth.</LD>
<LD>   Citizens to Preserve the Ojai wants to prohibit the city from
approving construction that would cause any traffic increase unless
the project can take the added burden off of roads. The group also
wants to give voters the right to reject plans that would increase
density on land inside the city limits.</LD>
<LD>   Congestion along the city's one narrow thoroughfare has become so
bad, group President Ivor Benci-Woodward said, that any added
development--even 23 proposed condominiums to replace condemned farm
worker housing--would create gridlock.</LD>
<TE>   "We have to do something," he said. "We're saying, 'Stop adding
more traffic.'''</TE>
<TE>   City leaders responded earlier this week by filing a lawsuit aimed
at blocking the traffic initiative from reaching the ballot, saying
the plan amounts to an illegal moratorium. They have asked a Ventura
County Superior Court judge to declare the initiative invalid.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, it just prohibits all improvements. Anything, a youth
center. Low-income housing," Mayor Steve Olsen said. "Yeah, we have
traffic problems. You can't deny that. But this won't alleviate those
traffic problems. Not allowing a recreation center to go in, or not
allowing somebody to build a duplex, that's ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   City Atty. Monte Widders said the city already has strict growth
limits in place. Current policies, he said, would yield only about
650 additional homes through 2050.</TE>
<TE>   The city's position is that the only way to mitigate traffic is to
expand roads, something residents flatly oppose.</TE>
<TE>   Benci-Woodward said his group, formed decades ago to crush state
plans to extend a highway into the city, would continue to fight any
proposed road expansions.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Benci-Woodward suggests finding other ways to
mitigate traffic.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of alternatives we could use, van pools, public
transportation," he said. "I don't know what the city would do. We're
leaving that up to the city. But we can't let everybody have three or
four cars."</TE>
<TE>   Widders said the activists' plan would violate state law by
preventing the city from fulfilling a mandate to provide affordable
housing. It also conflicts with the city's General Plan, he argued.</TE>
<TE>   Citizens to Preserve the Ojai has already sued the city over its
housing element and the condominium project. The group recently
announced it will begin collecting signatures to allow the ballot
vote on whether to increase density throughout the city.</TE>
<TE>   Widders also accused Benci-Woodward of trying to hijack
decision-making from the council because, living just outside the
city limits, Benci-Woodward himself can't run for a City Council
seat.</TE>
<TE>   "We're virtually under siege by this group," Widders said.</TE>
<TE>   Benci-Woodward rejected accusations that he is politically
motivated and said he believes the community will support both ballot
proposals.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a lot of towns in California are facing similar issues,"
he said. "There's not enough space or resources or water. We can't
all live in Ojai. It's a lovely place and I wish we had the resources
for everybody but we simply don't."</TE>

<HD>Politics in Past for Peppy, the Gadfly's Parrot Who Took
the 'Rot' Out of Perot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since the recent death of Long Beach political gadfly Ski Demski,
I've wondered how his parrot Peppy was doing and whether the blue
macaw might run again for political office.</LD>
<LD>   Demski, who himself sought the mayor's job numerous times, entered
Peppy in the 1992 presidential race after having a falling-out with
Ross Perot.</LD>
<LD>   Demski heavily promoted Peppy with converted Perot stickers. He
added "ppy" to the stickers and, as he explained, "took the 'rot' out
of Perot."</LD>
<TE>   Anyway, Jim Alexander, the trustee of Demski's estate, said that
Peppy is doing as well as could be expected. He lives in Demski's old
house, but "he's still looking for Ski," Alexander said.</TE>
<TE>   And Peppy is out of politics, which is probably for the best. The
creature has something of a temper.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll cut your finger if you stick it in his beak and he doesn't
know you," Alexander said. "He even bit Ski a couple of times."</TE>
<TE>   Today's question: What do you call a tall, rectangular hunk of
wood that has a door lock and a door handle? Not what you might think
if it's in the strip mall that Patricia Gunderman of Orange visited
(see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Heading the other way: I don't know how you get out of the place
that Robert Dean spotted (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Wait! Here's a way: Marian Sowa of Los Alamitos was driving on a
park road through White Sands National Monument in New Mexico when
she came upon a curious sign (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like it's pointing up," Sowa observed. Then, again, she
added, "Roswell is just a few hours to the east."</TE>
<TE>   Reading the small print: Checking for a legal expert on one Web
site, Eric Munson was momentarily stopped by a strange disclaimer
(see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Then he realized the firm meant "pro per" (legal shorthand for a
litigant who represents himself).</TE>
<TE>   Diamond-less, but not forgotten: If it's any comfort to ex-Dodger
star Steve Garvey, I still receive Only in L.A. items addressed to
him (two alone this week).</TE>
<TE>   I've never spoken to him, but I used to feel a part of his success
because Chuck Garrity, a Times assistant sports editor, would call me
"Garvey."</TE>
<TE>   This led to an unfortunate incident once when the real Garvey
phoned The Times sports department, returning a call that Garrity had
made.</TE>
<TE>   Garrity, his mind on something else, thought it was me
phoning--me, a guy he loved to needle.</TE>
<TE>   The conversation went like this:</TE>
<TE>   Garvey: Chuck, this is Steve Garvey.</TE>
<TE>   Garrity: Yeah, what ... do you want?</TE>
<TE>   Garvey: Well, I was told you wanted to talk to me.</TE>
<TE>   Garrity: Talk to you? I wouldn't want to talk to you if you were
the last man on earth.</TE>
<TE>   When Garrity realized who was calling, he apologized profusely to
Garvey (though not to me).</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: In Hollywood, Howard Dover spotted this hand-written
sign on a parked car: "Please do not break window. I only carry
liability."</TE>

<HD>In Kline's Case, the Dots Don't Seem to Connect</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By most accounts, Ronald Kline was a fine judge.</LD>
<LD>   Oh, the judge is alive and still on the November ballot for
reelection, but it's safe to put his career in the past tense--the
public tends to frown on people charged with possessing child
pornography on a home computer. After that charge came to light, a
37-year-old man came forward and alleged that Kline molested him 25
years ago. As a result, authorities charged Kline with a single count
of child molestation.</LD>
<LD>   The judge, 61, has pleaded not guilty but said this week he wants
his name taken off the ballot. The obvious question is why he didn't
think of that months ago, or, better yet, simply resign?</LD>
<TE>   I'll take a wild guess the answer is that he has bills to pay and
remains on paid administrative leave unless or until he's removed
from the bench.</TE>
<TE>   That stuff will play itself out. A more intriguing proposition has
intrigued me over the past few months since his arrest: Namely,
nothing the judge is accused of involves his conduct on the bench or
how he did his job. No one suspected a thing.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know what kind of connection I'd expect to find between
his public and private lives. But does it strike anyone else that
Kline, while being accused of something society recoils at, handled
his job with aplomb? Should it bother us that we can't, even in
retrospect, make the case that his alleged outside behavior affected
his courtroom behavior?</TE>
<TE>   I asked a former judge if I'm the weird one, but he eased my mind
a bit by acknowledging the unusual dichotomy.</TE>
<TE>   "In hindsight, a couple of people said some things were a little
erratic, that there were days when he seemed unhappy about something
from the moment he took the bench," the former judge says. "But we've
had a lot of judges ... whose mood swings were greater than his."</TE>
<TE>   The former judge, a one-time colleague of Kline's, didn't want to
be identified because of the sensitive nature of the situation. I
asked him if, even now, anyone could connect the dots.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody has come up with anything," he said. "Everybody is saying,
'Should I have seen anything?' But they thought the mood swings were
just attributable to him not getting enough sleep or his favorite
ballclub having lost a game. In general, the legal community didn't
see this coming and did not have a clue."</TE>
<TE>   I asked the former judge how any "secret" criminal life would ever
reveal itself in a judge's behavior or rulings.</TE>
<TE>   "If a guy was abusive to attorneys, called them names and gave
them a hard time, and then you found out he was beating his wife at
night, you could see the connection there," he said. Or, if a judge
acted inappropriately around female attorneys and later were
discovered to have sex-related crimes in his background, courtroom
observers might berate themselves for not making the connection. Or,
the judge added, some unusual social behaviors might send up a flare.</TE>
<TE>   Kline's comportment never raised any concerns.</TE>
<TE>   In a sense, his caseload of commercial litigation was so far
removed from the allegations that have surfaced that it would have
provided the perfect cover. So did the very nature of being a judge,
which leads many on the bench to maintain a fair amount of privacy
and eschew a lot of socializing.</TE>
<TE>   The practical reality is that Kline, if found guilty, will lose
his judgeship simply by being a felon. That doesn't address the issue
of whether someone who looks at pornographic pictures is
automatically disqualified as a competent judge of cases involving
complex civil litigation.</TE>
<TE>   Such questions, I realize, are abstract musings. In the real
world, Kline's goose is cooked.</TE>
<TE>   "You know why it seems weird?" the former judge said, speaking
generically, not of Kline. "It's because we traditionally put judges
on pedestals. They make decisions on which our lives turn, so we want
them to be wise, all-knowing and conscientious. We give them so much
power, that we hope they are that way. So if you find out that
someone who seemed to be doing the wise, conscientious and
all-knowing thing just fine turns out to be a nut case, that scares
us a little bit."</TE>

<HD>Privacy  of Calls  Affirmed</HD>
<DH>Ruling: Court defines confidential phone conversations
broadly, making lawsuits easier.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA DOLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The California Supreme Court strengthened privacy protections
Thursday by making it easier to successfully sue people who secretly
tape others' phone conversations.</LD>
<LD>   The court decided unanimously that a conversation is confidential
under state law if a party expects he or she is not being overheard
or recorded. Those who secretly tape others can be liable for at
least $5,000 in damages for each recording.</LD>
<LD>   Thursday's decision, which broadly defines what is confidential,
was a defeat for the media, in particular broadcasters who have been
sued for airing interviews with people who did not know they were
being recorded. Media lawyers had filed a brief in the case urging
the court to adopt a more narrow definition that would make it harder
for plaintiffs to argue that remarks had been confidential.</LD>
<TE>   The ruling stemmed from a Los Angeles case involving recordings a
woman made of telephone calls between her now deceased husband and
his son. The son, who charged his stepmother had tried to hasten his
father's death, now stands to collect as much as $120,000 for 24
phone conversations recorded by his stepmother.</TE>
<TE>   California has prohibited private parties from recording telephone
calls without consent from all participants--only if the calls
included a "confidential communication." Courts of appeal have
disagreed over what constituted a confidential conversation.</TE>
<TE>   In their brief to the court, lawyers for media outlets including
the three major television networks argued that a broad definition of
confidential communication would end the use of hidden microphone and
camera reporting in California. The ruling also could make it more
difficult for the print media to use material from recordings
provided by third parties.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry K. Staub, a lawyer who represented the son in Thursday's
case, said disputes over secret taping also arise frequently in the
course of litigation, when one side tapes another's damaging
admissions without the party's knowledge and consent.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that is going to stop now, and that is a good thing,"
Staub said.</TE>
<TE>   If the court had ruled more narrowly, no conversation would be
considered confidential unless one of the parties at the time had
declared it to be so, Staub said.</TE>
<TE>   The state high court ruled in a dispute between J. Michael
Flanagan and his stepmother, Honorine T. Flanagan in Flanagan v.
Flanagan, S085594.</TE>
<TE>   Honorine married Michael's father, John, in 1969, and John adopted
her daughter. He also had two children, including Michael, from a
previous marriage. When he married Honorine, John Flanagan had an
estate worth about $22 million.</TE>
<TE>   John was diagnosed as having prostate cancer in 1992, and his
physician prescribed medicine to slow the spread of the disease.
Honorine began giving her husband his monthly prescribed injections
in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   The court said that John changed his estate plan in 1995. Instead
of leaving all his property to his wife, he planned to give his
grandchildren from his first marriage an interest in his property.</TE>
<TE>   Around that time, Honorine told her manicurist, Dale Denels, that
she would pay someone to kill John, the court said. In September of
that year, Honorine also told Denels that she was injecting John with
water instead of his medicine.</TE>
<TE>   The manicurist began taping her telephone calls with Honorine and
told Michael that his father's life was in danger, according to the
court. The manicurist played Michael a tape of one of her
conversations with his stepmother, and Michael played it for his
father.</TE>
<TE>   John moved out of his house and moved in with Michael. A physician
later concluded that John had not been receiving his prescribed
medication.</TE>
<TE>   John changed his will to leave all his property to his two
children from his first marriage. But John and Honorine reconciled in
August 1996, and John again changed his will.</TE>
<TE>   He died of cardiovascular disease in March 1997, and Honorine
"ended up with basically everything," said Staub, who represented
Michael in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Staub said the couple had lived for years in Beverly Hills, but
eventually moved to the Palm Springs area. He said John, who had
earned a fortune in the mortuary business, was in his 80s when he
died, and Honorine was in her 60s at that time.</TE>
<TE>   Honorine sued Michael and her manicurist for conspiracy, invasion
of privacy and emotional distress. Michael filed a cross complaint,
charging that Honorine had illegally taped all of his telephone
conversations with his father after the couple reunited.</TE>
<TE>   During a trial in Los Angeles, Honorine said she had installed a
voice-activated recorder with her husband's consent and listened to
tapes of telephone calls daily.</TE>
<TE>   Michael testified that his stepmother had forbidden her husband to
speak with him and that he considered all his calls with his father
to be confidential.</TE>
<TE>   A jury awarded Michael $5,000 for each of 24 calls and $1.2
million in punitive damages. The trial judge eliminated the punitive
damage award and reduced total compensation to $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   An appeals court later decided that two of three conversations
played to the jury were confidential, but that none of the other
conversations were protected because Michael had presented no
evidence of their content.</TE>
<TE>   The appellate court, relying on an earlier decision, said that a
conversation is confidential only if the parties had reason to expect
that it would not later be divulged to someone else.</TE>
<TE>   In rejecting that definition, the California Supreme Court noted
that the Legislature has approved a law to protect cellular phone
conversations from intentional eavesdropping or recording.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature chose to protect all phone conversations, not just
those "where a party wanted to keep the content secret," Justice
Joyce Kennard wrote for the court.</TE>
<TE>   "The Legislature's ongoing concern is with eavesdropping or
recording of conversations, not later dissemination," Kennard wrote.</TE>
<TE>   She said the state's Privacy Act "protects against intentional,
nonconsensual recording of telephone conversations, regardless of the
content of the conversation or the type of telephone involved."</TE>
<TE>   Ed Green, who represented Honorine, said the Court of Appeal will
now have to decide whether the telephone calls were confidential
under the definition handed down Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   He said there was testimony at the trial that Honorine, who never
faced criminal charges, "did not attempt to kill" her husband and
that she never withheld his medication.</TE>

<HD>2 Children Almost Drown in Pool</HD>
<DH>West Covina: The boys, 2 and 3, are in critical condition
after backyard accident.</DH>

<LD>Two West Covina toddlers are in critical condition after apparently
climbing through a hole in a fence around their home's backyard pool
and nearly drowning Thursday morning, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   "The moms were watching them from inside the house, but after 10
minutes they lost sight of the children," said West Covina Fire
Marshal Rick Genovese.</LD>
<LD>   The mothers rushed outside the ranch-style house and found
Miguelangel Arriaga, 3, and his cousin Ricardo Arriaga, 2, face up in
the pool. They screamed for help, pulled their sons from the water,
and carried them to the front of the home in the 1500 block of East
Thackery Street.</LD>
<TE>   Neighbor Luis Jurado ran across the street after hearing one of
the women. "I was the first one there," Jurado said. "I saw the two
little kids. They were both lifeless. They weren't breathing. We put
them on the ground and tried to do CPR. Luckily, the police were down
the street; I waved them down."</TE>
<TE>   Four West Covina police officers investigating an unrelated
incident responded to the screaming.</TE>
<TE>   Field Training Officer Pat Cirillo said he and the other officers
began CPR and called for paramedics, who arrived two minutes later.</TE>
<TE>   "The training takes over," he said a few hours after the incident.
"Later, you'll reflect on the emotional part of what you did."</TE>
<TE>   Miguelangel was taken to Queen of the Valley Hospital and later
transferred to Fountain Valley Regional Hospital's pediatric care
unit in critical condition. His condition improved during the day but
remained critical, and hospital officials said there was a
possibility of brain damage.</TE>
<TE>   Ricardo was flown by helicopter to Childrens Hospital Los Angeles,
where he was listed in critical but stable condition.</TE>
<TE>   As police and fire officials gathered at the modest, one-story
house later in the afternoon, two push brooms were still floating in
the rectangular pool, and a long-handled strainer rested near the
edge.</TE>
<TE>   No charges will be filed against the Arriaga family, said West
Covina Police Department spokesman Rudy Lopez.</TE>

<HD>District Misreads Literacy Contract</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A controversial contract for an adult-literacy program awarded by the
Board of Education this week might have gone to the wrong company by
mistake, Los Angeles school district officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Supt. Roy Romer and several board members said in interviews
Thursday that they thought they were giving the $6.3-million contract
to Reality Based Learning of Redmond, Wash., a firm with an
established record in children's literacy. Instead, they approved a
contract with a similarly named start-up company with just three
employees. That firm, Reality Based Learning California, has the same
founder as the Washington-based company but no other formal ties to
it.</LD>
<LD>   The California firm has a mailing address at a Los Angeles law
office and no operational software.</LD>
<TE>   The only link between the two firms is Gary Andersen, a software
entrepreneur who founded both companies and sits on the board of the
Washington corporation. Anderson, who is no longer working with the
Washington firm, says he is the president of the Los Angeles-based
company.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel that the district has been subject to a bait-and-switch,"
said Romer, who had cautioned against buying the literacy program.</TE>
<TE>   The program, which was approved 4 to 3 on Tuesday, sparked a
heated debate because Romer and some board members were upset at
behind-the-scenes efforts by Sen. Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) to
push it. Critics of the contract said supporters were trying to curry
favor with the powerful lawmaker. And the district's inspector
general is investigating whether Polanco's series of meetings with
individual board members violated open-meeting laws.</TE>
<TE>   Polanco, who argued passionately for the program at the meeting,
made several references to the Washington-based firm and described
how its literacy program was already being used in schools there and
in Canada. Polanco also reminded board member Genethia Hayes about
her trip to the company's Redmond offices and recounted visiting each
board member with Andersen in tow.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Polanco said he was aware that the California and
Washington companies had no official tie, but said that is
irrelevant.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't invest in the company," said the Senate majority
leader. "You invest in the people."</TE>
<TE>   But Romer said he doubted whether the board realized that they
were only investing in three people--Andersen and two itinerant
software programmers.</TE>
<TE>   "Never was it disclosed by Polanco," Romer said.</TE>

<HD>Billboard Ban Gets OK From City Planners</HD>
<DH>Commerce: Panel also urges the City Council to reject a
proposal to allow freeway signs in exchange for removing others
elsewhere.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoping to halt the spread of visual blight, the Los Angeles City
Planning Commission recommended Thursday that new billboards be
banned in the city and rejected a proposal to allow them along
freeways in exchange for the removal of 2,000 signs elsewhere in the
city.</LD>
<LD>   The commission also recommended a prohibition on "super-graphics,"
the large vinyl signs that often are draped on buildings.</LD>
<LD>   After several residents testified that the proliferation of
billboards is ruining their neighborhoods, the commission voted
unanimously to send the recommendations to the City Council for final
action. The council has been more supportive of the trade-off
proposal allowing freeway signs.</LD>
<TE>   Commission President Mitchell B. Menzer agreed with residents that
the proposal to end a 50-year prohibition of billboards along
freeways is not worth the industry's offer to take down 2,000
billboards elsewhere in the city. The latest proposal would have
allowed 70 double-faced billboards to be erected along Los Angeles'
freeways.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a very bad idea to be heading in that direction and
begin installing billboards along freeways," Menzer said. "Putting
billboards up along freeways does great damage to residential areas
that are nearby."</TE>
<TE>   As to the effect the ban would have on the local economy,
Commissioner Susan Hubbard Oakley said: "When you add more visual
blight, you are not helping the economics of the city."</TE>
<TE>   The ban on new billboards would allow the city to designate
specific commercial districts where billboards would be allowed. One
such district is being considered for part of Hollywood, where
billboards are thought to add to the atmosphere of the entertainment
center, said Deputy Planning Director Frank Eberhard.</TE>
<TE>   Billboard industry leaders attended the packed City Hall hearing
Thursday but did not testify, saying afterward that they will save
their arguments for the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Spiker Jr., who represents several billboard firms, said
council members know that most residents want to see billboards
removed from their neighborhoods in exchange for some along freeways.</TE>
<TE>   "If the deal is fair, then it has a chance in council," Spiker
said. "This is a fair deal."</TE>
<TE>   No date has been set for the council's consideration. The
recommendation goes first to the council's planning and land use
management committee. The commission also recommended that if freeway
billboards are allowed their number be reduced from 70 to 50, because
some areas of the city would require detailed environmental studies.</TE>
<TE>   In particular, Eberhard said, billboards should not be allowed
along Interstate 5 at the northern end of the city where they could
obscure scenic mountain views.</TE>
<TE>   Spiker said he expects the council to agree to allow 50 freeway
billboards in exchange for the removal of 2,000 elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that the council voted 8 to 3 last June to tentatively
allow 70 double-faced billboards along freeways.</TE>
<TE>   But opponents of the exchange, including Councilwoman Cindy
Miscikowski, noted that eight new council members have been elected
since then.</TE>
<TE>   "It is long past due that we ban billboards in the city of Los
Angeles," Miscikowski told the commission. "If we change our
50-year-plus ban on billboards along freeways, we in the city are
going to pay a high price."</TE>
<TE>   She said a trade wouldn't be necessary if existing laws were
enforced. About 40% of the city's estimated 10,000 billboards are
illegal, mostly because they have been altered (usually enlarged)
since they were first permitted. Enforcement would only force
billboard firms to change them back, not take them down.</TE>
<TE>   Miscikowski said other major cities, including San Jose, San Diego
and Houston, already have banned new billboards.</TE>
<TE>   The commission also heard opposition to freeway billboards from
resident activists from Pacific Palisades and Tarzana and the
Cahuenga Pass, Mid-City and northeast San Fernando Valley areas.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Allen of the Palisades Preservation Assn. told the commission
he opposes freeway billboards because they pose a potential traffic
hazard.</TE>
<TE>   "They are a distraction for drivers," he said.</TE>

<HD>Oxnard Seeks Public's Input</HD>
<DH>Government: Survey of residents on high-profile issues will
help guide leaders' decisions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oxnard leaders are asking for a report card graded by the city's
savviest critics: its own residents.</LD>
<LD>   In a five-page survey mailed to 3,000 homes, residents are being
queried on a number of high-profile issues: whether the city is
growing too fast, whether it should fight or allow expansion of
Oxnard Airport and how 75-acre College Park in south Oxnard should be
used.</LD>
<LD>   Residents are being asked to rate services provided by police,
firefighters, parks, libraries and utilities. Residents are even
asked to describe their quality of life--a bold move for a
blue-collar city that fights an inferiority complex.</LD>
<TE>   "There might be things we don't want to hear," said Mayor Pro Tem
John Zaragoza. "But we need to find out anyway, even if it's not
positive. Because then we can correct whatever needs to be done."</TE>
<TE>   The City Council commissioned the $15,000 survey to help guide a
number of high-profile policy decisions. A proposed 2,700-home
subdivision at the city's northern edge must still be approved, so
the city is asking residents whether they think the city is growing
too fast, about right or too slow.</TE>
<TE>   College Park's future is in the air. Should it be used for soccer
fields or an aquatic center? Or both?</TE>
<TE>   Residents are also asked what they think should happen at Oxnard
Airport, a small county-run general aviation strip located near the
city's center. Should it be closed? Or should some expansion be
permitted?</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're doing great," Zaragoza said. "We have money in
reserve. We've been repaving streets; we may redo City Hall, and
we've been helping south Oxnard. We are doing a lot of things for the
community and we want to know if we are headed in the right
direction."</TE>
<TE>   Responses will be tabulated in April and made public, said
Jeannette Villanueva-Walker, a spokeswoman for the city. The
questionnaire will be followed by two commercials, to be aired on
cable and network stations, touting Oxnard's charms,
Villanueva-Walker said.</TE>
<TE>   One spot, still in production, will emphasize the city's temperate
weather, its strong agriculture industry, its many restaurants and
its proximity to the Pacific Ocean, she said. A second commercial
will feature the city's ethnically diverse residents talking about
the city's libraries, cultural events and recreation opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   "We have wonderful things in our community and we need to get that
message out," Villanueva-Walker said.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard has long fought an image as being poorer, more crowded and
more crime-ridden than Ventura County's other large cities. But
officials say those views are out of sync with recent numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Although the city has a population of 170,000--the county's
highest--it still has plenty of open space, said Steve Kinney,
executive director of the private, nonprofit Economic Development
Corp. It increasingly is attracting upper middle-class families and
high-paying technology jobs, Kinney said.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, the industrial sector showed the greatest growth with
2,600 new jobs, aided by new arrivals Broadband Technologies, a
silicon chip manufacturer; Philips Medical Systems, a maker of
biotechnology equipment; and PTI Technologies, which produces
lab-quality industrial filtration systems.</TE>
<TE>   And the latest crime statistics show that Oxnard is the
fifth-safest medium-sized city in the nation.</TE>

<HD>Warning on Viagra's Role in STDs Is Requested</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Public health officials here are making an unusual appeal to federal
regulators to warn consumers that use of the sexual impotence drug
Viagra is linked to gonorrhea transmission.</LD>
<LD>   "The data's clear, the evidence is strong," said Dr. Jeffrey
Klausner, director of sexually transmitted disease control for the
city, who has conducted a study on the issue. "There's really at this
point no excuse for inaction by the FDA or the manufacturer."</LD>
<LD>   But Food and Drug Administration spokeswoman Laura Bradbard said
Thursday that her agency wants to wait for more studies before
deciding if changes to Viagra's warning label are necessary.</LD>
<TE>   Klausner is not suggesting that Viagra causes gonorrhea. Rather,
he contends that Viagra leads to risky sexual behavior, which is
associated with higher rates of STD transmission. Gonorrhea presents
the greatest risk because it is more common than other STDs among gay
and bisexual men, and it is far more infectious.</TE>
<TE>   "It is one of the most infectious organisms we know," Klausner
said.</TE>
<TE>   He said young gay and bisexual men often use Viagra
recreationally, along with ecstasy and other illegal drugs, lessening
their resolve to use condoms. In fact, Viagra's manufacturer, Pfizer
Inc., has warned doctors about the danger of mixing amyl nitrate (a
street drug known as "poppers") with Viagra, which can cause a sharp
drop in blood pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Pfizer spokesman Geoff Cook noted, however, that "any
pharmaceutical product can be abused, and that's beyond our control."</TE>
<TE>   Cook said the company is satisfied that Viagra's consumer label
adequately addresses the issue of STD transmission. It reads: "Viagra
does not protect you or your partner from getting sexually
transmitted diseases, including HIV--the virus that causes AIDS."</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody should think that by taking Viagra they can be protected,"
Cook said. "Clearly they need to engage in safe sex."</TE>
<TE>   Klausner said the label doesn't address his concerns. His team's
study of 844 men conducted at San Francisco's STD clinic found that
gay and bisexual men were more than four times more likely to use
Viagra than heterosexual men in the prior year. Of the 108 gay Viagra
users, 43% mixed it with ecstasy and 28% took it with
methamphetamines. In addition, more men received the drug from a
friend than from a health-care provider.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly a third of gay and bisexual Viagra users had some STD at
the time of the study, compared with 23% of non-Viagra users. Even
more telling, Viagra users had an average of 5.4 sexual partners in
the last two months compared with 3.5 partners for nonusers.</TE>
<TE>   The findings have been accepted for publication in an upcoming
issue of the journal AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   Klausner is known for his bold efforts at STD prevention. Last
year, he successfully appealed to federal regulators to force drug
companies to tone down ads touting HIV drugs. Those ads--featuring
muscular, healthy-looking men--downplayed the drugs' side effects and
the consequences of HIV, he argued. The FDA agreed.</TE>
<TE>   Klausner said he sought the FDA's help on Viagra because he was
ignored or rebuffed in his efforts to work with Pfizer.</TE>
<TE>   Klausner's counterpart in Los Angeles County agreed that a warning
label is necessary. Dr. Peter Kerndt, director of STD control for the
county, said he too has noted recreational Viagra use in the gay
community.</TE>
<TE>   "That's where the real risk of STDs is," he said, "when it's used
recreationally and combined with other drugs like methamphetamine or
ecstasy."</TE>
<TE>   But the idea of a warning label on Viagra was met with skepticism
in San Francisco's Castro district, a largely gay area.</TE>
<TE>   "We live in a culture where we blame everything but the person for
their actions," said James Salaiz, a 29-year-old waiter. "It's not
really the drug but the person involved."</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Hunt, a 29-year-old financial analyst, said that he and his
partner were given prescriptions for Viagra even though the physician
knew that it was for recreational use and that they were using
crystal methamphetamine.</TE>
<TE>   More Studies Are Needed</TE>
<TE>   Hunt reasoned, "If we were responsible enough to ask him for a
prescription for Viagra to sustain our own sex life, then we were
less likely to go out and find other partners," he said. "That
couldn't be further from the truth."</TE>
<TE>   Crystal meth inhibits erections, Hunt said, so Viagra helps to
counteract that. "I know from experience," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's place blame where it lies. It's not fair to target a
pharmaceutical company because people find a legal method to cope
with an illegal problem."</TE>
<TE>   Medical experts said that other studies must be conducted to
determine if Klausner's findings can be replicated.</TE>
<TE>   "What he's attempting to do is definitely laudable," said Dr.
Vince Silenzio, an assistant professor at Columbia University's
medical school. "But on the other hand, we don't know what's going on
yet, so it's a little premature to issue the specific warning about
what's causing it."</TE>
<TE>   Silenzio, a board member of the Gay and Lesbian Medical Assn.,
said he doubts that Pfizer would want a warning label because that
could hurt its sales.</TE>
<TE>   "Every penny that they can make on this drug, they're going to
make," he said. "I don't think it's necessarily going to be in their
best interest to react to one study and to issue the warning."</TE>

<LD>Police are looking for a man who held up a Ventura Avenue gas
station.</LD>
<LD>   The man, who had a shaved head, walked into an Arco kiosk about
7:45 p.m. Wednesday and demanded that the clerk put money from the
register into a bag. He had a gun under his baseball jacket,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The cashier complied, and the robber left on foot with an
undisclosed amount of cash. He was last seen walking east on Kellogg
Street. Anyone with information on the case is asked to call Ventura
police at 339-4400.</LD>

<LD>Enrollment at Cal State Northridge's Channel Islands off-campus
center has reached a record 1,902 students for the current semester.</LD>
<LD>   The spring 2002 figure translates into the center having a
full-time equivalent enrollment of more than 1,000 students--also a
first, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Center officials attributed the high enrollment to a cooling
economy and publicity on the opening of the campus in the fall.
Academic programs will gradually move from the center to the new
university.</LD>

<HD>High Seas Strand West Hills Students on Catalina Island</HD>
<DH>Weather: Strong winds make it too rough for boating.
Advisories are issued for several roads.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chilly winter winds blew hard across Southern California on Thursday,
stranding a group of West Hills schoolchildren on Catalina Island and
prompting authorities to issue high-wind warnings on local freeways.</LD>
<LD>   The gusting winds and high seas caused the U.S. Coast Guard to
halt ferry service between Catalina Island and San Pedro, delaying
the return of 130 fifth-graders from Pomelo Drive Elementary School,
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The students, along with a dozen teachers and parents, were
scheduled to return to San Pedro on Wednesday after a three-day field
trip to the Catalina Island Marine Institute, Assistant Principal
Sean Foran said.</LD>
<TE>   By Thursday afternoon, Coast Guard officials had allowed ferry
service to resume. The group was expected to return to campus
Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been in contact with the students and relaying
information to their parents," Foran said. "The kids looked forward
to the added day and a 'Gilligan's Island' type of adventure."</TE>
<TE>   The California Highway Patrol cautioned motorists, especially
those traveling in vehicles with a high center of gravity, to be
prepared for sudden strong crosswinds.</TE>
<TE>   The CHP issued wind advisories Thursday afternoon for the Golden
State Freeway between Halsey Canyon Road and California 138, as well
as for the Ronald Reagan Freeway between the Golden State Freeway and
the Ventura County line.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's high winds were the result of a low-pressure system in
the upper atmosphere combined with a strong jet stream traveling down
the West Coast, said Tom Carlson, a meteorologist with Weather
Central Inc., which provides forecast information to The Times.</TE>
<TE>   As the air rushes across the region's mountain ranges and canyons,
it picks up speed and turns colder, which was predicted to result in
subfreezing wind-chill temperatures overnight in the Santa Clarita
and Antelope valleys, Carlson said.</TE>
<TE>   Today's high temperatures are expected to be 56 in Lancaster, 60
in Newhall, 66 in Burbank, and 64 in Van Nuys and Woodland Hills.
Lows are expected to range from the mid-30s to the upper 40s.</TE>

<HD>Improved Los Angeles Zoo Gets 5-Year Seal of Approval</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Zoo on Thursday won re-accreditation by the American
Zoo and Aquarium Assn. for five years--a sign the zoo has greatly
improved since 1995, when accreditation was denied by the same group
for a year.</LD>
<LD>   In a 20-page report, three accreditation inspectors headed by
Louisville, Ky., Zoo Director William Foster said, "The entire fabric
and look of the facility has been positively addressed" since then.</LD>
<LD>   Noting higher attendance and higher per-capita spending on the
zoo, the report was particularly enthusiastic about improvements in
veterinary services and the botanical setting in which the animals
live.</LD>
<TE>   But the inspection team, which included San Antonio Zoo Director
Steve McCusker and Terrie Correll, curator of the Living Desert in
Palm Desert, did have some criticisms.</TE>
<TE>   They called the animal collection "geriatric," meaning the
animals, on average, are too old, and said their diet should be
enhanced.</TE>
<TE>   And they said the zoo's support organization, the Greater Los
Angeles Zoo Assn., has too much authority over the zoo and should
stick mainly to fund-raising. The association, a nonprofit auxiliary,
runs the zoo docent program and plays a large role in its education
and public relations efforts.</TE>
<TE>   The report noted that the support organization's director, Don
Youpa, is paid more than zoo Director Manuel A. Mollinedo, whose
salary is about $164,000. Youpa would not say how much he is paid,
but he told the Chronicle of Philanthropy when he was hired last year
that the zoo association promised him a 10% increase over his
previous salary of $225,000 if he increased public contributions to
the zoo by at least 15% this fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   Although Mollinedo said he was elated by the largely positive tone
of the report, he also observed that it had noted that "Youpa is paid
significantly more than me."</TE>
<TE>   "You really do not have the zoo director as head of the zoo right
now," he said. "Some question whether the support organization
clearly recognizes the zoo director and the city as being
responsible."</TE>
<TE>   Youpa, while saying that he believes the role currently played by
the support organization is appropriate, added: "As far as I'm
concerned, it is the Mollinedo zoo, it's certainly not the Youpa
zoo."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn said Thursday that he was pleased
with the accreditation, which he said confirms "that we are back on
track to becoming a world-class zoo."</TE>
<TE>   The American Zoo and Aquarium Assn., which represents 201
accredited zoos and aquariums in North America, had complained in
1995 that bureaucratic problems and conditions were so bad at the zoo
that the animals' health was in jeopardy.</TE>
<TE>   This time, however, the group's inspectors were much happier.</TE>
<TE>   "A notable achievement has been the zoo's designation as a city
department," they reported. Their separation from under the auspices
of the Parks and Recreation Department has essentially been completed
and allows for a more self-directed future.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that the electorate had generously voted $110 million for
the zoo, the inspectors said it now had the ability to address
long-neglected infrastructure and facility needs cited in past
inspections.</TE>
<TE>   "Water, electrical and communication system renovations have been
tackled," they wrote. "Extensive planning and design has occurred.
Shortcomings, such as the veterinary hospital, quarantine facility
and commissary, are nearing completion and occupancy."</TE>
<TE>   Mollinedo said Thursday that he is working toward obtaining
younger animals and that deliberations about hiring a nutritionist
for the zoo are underway.</TE>

<LD>It must be a nervous time in the mayor's office: The Los Angeles
Times Poll shows that Mayor James K. Hahn is paying heavily for his
opposition to the reappointment of Police Chief Bernard C. Parks.
Hahn's support is faltering, while Parks' is surging. But what should
truly give Hahn pause is what else the poll results say about his
tenure. His opposition to Parks looms so large because Angelenos see
the mayor as having done little else since he took office last July.</LD>
<LD>   Even those who approved of the job Hahn was doing as mayor (46%)
didn't know why. Of those polled who approved of his performance, 37%
said they liked him for "no particular reason." An additional 12%
said they liked him because they thought he was "doing his best" or
"trying hard." Scant praise, indeed.</LD>
<LD>   And there's other bad news for Hahn: Even when he took his tough
stand against Parks, those polled didn't believe he did it for the
right reasons. Twenty-seven percent said Hahn opposed Parks because
the chief wasn't doing a good job, but 39% said Hahn went against
Parks because it was good for Hahn politically.</LD>
<TE>   The poll results shouldn't surprise anyone who's been closely
watching this political debacle unfold since last month. We supported
Hahn's right to have a police chief with whom he could work
effectively to serve Los Angeles. That was the best and strongest
reason for Hahn to say he wanted to replace Parks, who had been
appointed by former Mayor Richard Riordan. We suggested that after
taking his sudden, strong stance against a well-known police chief
with deep political ties to the African American community, Hahn
would need to mend fences and make a public case on why he didn't
want Parks to continue as chief (something Hahn should have done
before his extraordinary announcement opposing Parks).</TE>
<TE>   So what did the mayor do? One day, he'd say Parks should go
because he caused low police morale. Another day, the reason would be
a climbing crime rate. The next week, it would be dissatisfaction
with police reform. In all this, the public sensed shifting sands and
a lack of intestinal fortitude. Hahn handled this most delicate
political situation with the acumen and deftness of an elephant in
ballet slippers.</TE>
<TE>   So now, Hahn's poor Police Commission is stuck with the political
fallout. The five-member commission has until mid-May to decide
whether Parks should be given a second five-year term. The poll
results are just one more reason why the commission needs to act
decisively and swiftly. It isn't fair that an appointed, volunteer
commission should be asked to do well what the elected mayor has
botched. Mostly though, the mismanagement of the Parks reappointment
is unfair to the people of Los Angeles, who have the right to expect
not only that their mayor lead but that he lead with foresight and
skill.</TE>

<LD>After months of dipping a toe into the turbulent waters of the Middle
East--and then only reluctantly--the Bush administration plunged in
this week, with a Washington-driven U.N. resolution, the dispatch of
mediator Anthony C. Zinni and a chastisement of Israel for its
military offensive in the occupied territories.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush's comment that the Israeli sweep through refugee
camps and enclaves in the occupied territories was "not helpful" was
overdue. Israel has the right to defend itself against terrorism. But
the two-week onslaught of helicopter gunships, tanks and foot
soldiers in the largest military campaign in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip since their capture in the 1967 Middle East war is more likely
to provoke retaliation than discourage the killing.</LD>
<LD>   The army's invasion of Ramallah, the de facto capital of the
Palestinians, was more than a search for terrorists and weapons. It
was a humiliation of Palestinians in their most important city, the
one where Israel kept Yasser Arafat under virtual house arrest for
months.</LD>
<TE>   The suicide bombings by Palestinians and the Israeli offensive
make Zinni's job of pushing both sides toward a cease-fire much more
difficult. He was brought home in December when violence became so
bad as to make his task seem impossible. Since then, the violence has
gotten worse. Last week at least 67 Palestinians and 31 Israelis were
killed, the largest numbers since the conflict resumed in September
2000. The death toll has increased this week. But Zinni and Bush
should show patience and meet with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon and Arafat as often as necessary until the killing ends or at
least lessens. Both Israeli and Palestinian officials said they were
ready to work with the mediator on producing a truce, and this would
not be the first war in which cease-fire talks went on simultaneously
with bloodshed.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. Security Council's resolution this week endorsing a
Palestinian state for the first time also was helpful, reemphasizing
to those in the occupied territories the goal of the peace process.
Bush said the United States "helped engineer" the resolution, which
agrees with his announced support for a Palestinian state and Israel
living in peace inside secure and recognized borders. It is important
that Washington emphasize that goal as a counter to Arab complaints
that U.S. support for Israel, including arms supplies, fuels the
violence. Those complaints ignore Arafat's refusal to accept generous
peace terms at Camp David and his refusal or inability to stop the
suicide attacks on Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Vice President Dick Cheney too is in the Mideast, hoping to talk
about possible action against Iraq but being confronted in Arab
countries with demands that the U.S. get more involved and stay
involved in the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. The danger is clear:
Violence can spill over to other countries in the region. The United
States has laid out plans for a cease-fire before; it needs to keep
pushing now to get both sides to quell the carnage.</TE>

<LD>Andrea Yates murdered her children. So said a Texas jury. That jury
would now be morally right to vote against killing Yates.</LD>
<LD>   Life imprisonment would be the harshest possible sentence for this
woman, who, by all indications, cared deeply for her children before
she slaughtered them. She has already attempted suicide. It is hard
to imagine that a life in which she had to think about her actions
would be anything less than a living hell.</LD>
<LD>   Life imprisonment would not only be an appropriately punitive
sentence, it would also be the responsible one. Executing Yates would
imply that her crime had no context. In fact, her mental illness was
inextricably entwined with her decision to hold her five children
under water until they drowned.</LD>
<TE>   The science of mental health is still young and incapable of
objectively wrestling with questions of good and evil. Science, in
short, cannot reveal the precise degree to which insanity should
mitigate responsibility for criminal behavior.</TE>
<TE>   There is, however, a growing realization by most scientists that
the symptoms of mental illness can be dramatically reduced by giving
patients the right drugs and making sure they take them. The only way
to keep tuberculosis from rampaging through a community is for
medical professionals to give medication to those with the infectious
and potentially fatal disease and make sure they take it. Likewise,
when severely mentally ill people stop taking their medications, when
they don't get the aggressive psychological help they need, their
illnesses can worsen, to the detriment of those around them.</TE>
<TE>   Society cannot prevent others from committing similar crimes
unless it acknowledges that mental illness and criminal behavior do
not emerge suddenly from a vacuum. Keeping Yates in prison for life
would force her to confront her responsibility. And it would remind
families, psychiatrists and others that they too have a
responsibility.</TE>

<LD>Once again, Steve Lopez jumped on his Times-sanctioned soapbox to
launch another hateful diatribe against the Catholic Church ("Simple
Suggestions for Mahony," March 13).</LD>
<LD>   It cannot be understated that the current crisis involving
pedophile priests must be cleared up in an open, legal way by the
church. However, to imply that the pope is party to the legalities of
this situation--Lopez says, "It's as if the pope himself wrote these
laws"--is an outrageous statement to make.</LD>
<LD>   Insults like these have no place in this problem. Yes, the church
must rid the clergy of those found guilty of wrongdoing and help heal
those hurt. However, this does not legitimize those who would use
these tragic circumstances to heap hate and scorn on the religion of
1billion people.</LD>

<TE>   Oh, boy, another expose! It seems to come as a total surprise that
priests, just like mothers, fathers, men, women and other mere
mortals, are capable of age-old sex exploitation and that Catholic
dioceses, like other institutions, are capable of cover-ups. I guess
we're all human, after all. Or are we?</TE>
<TE>   A witch hunt accomplishes nothing but feeds an insatiable desire
to expose the profane. For in our fervent desire to root out the
"evil perpetrators" and expose them for public display, we seem to be
forgetting that we too are mere mortals, that our own transgressions,
past or present, are not what define us. And, there is more to each
victim than this crime.</TE>
<TE>   Those who are without sin, those who stand above humanity, let
them cast the first stones. We are all mere mortals, not gods. But
there is still more to all of us than this.</TE>

<HD>It's a Gloves-On Smog Fight</HD>
<DH>Pollution: State's new plan that aims at clean air for
everyone by 2020 adopts a gentler approach along with the usual
regulations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY POLAKOVIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California air quality officials on Thursday unveiled a new
smog-fighting plan for the state aimed at achieving healthful air for
everyone by 2020.</LD>
<LD>   Compared with past strategies, the latest plan uses gentler
approaches along with traditional regulations.</LD>
<LD>   Future reductions in emissions will come in nibbles rather than
bites because few major polluters remain. Cuts will move beyond
smokestacks and automobile tailpipes to include fumes from cow manure
and exhaust from bulldozers, farm machinery, locomotives and dirt
bikes. Even landscaping is targeted. The plan suggests incentives for
people to plant low-pollen trees and shrubs and to avoid eucalyptus
and other trees that release chemicals that contribute slightly to
smog.</LD>
<TE>   "This is something we haven't done in the past. We wanted to take
a look at air quality for the state as a whole and what we have to do
to have healthy air for everyone," said Michael Kenny, executive
officer for the Air Resources Board. "We're looking at a larger
number of sources so we can achieve a greater number of reductions
from more places."</TE>
<TE>   The plan is not binding or legally enforceable, but rather a menu
of measures that officials can pick from. Some of the individual
control measures have been on the books for years. Some of them, such
as regulations for ships, planes and trains, are largely outside
California's authority and require assistance from the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the Legislature and regulators have the political will to
adopt all the measures is a question. While California has been a
world leader in the fight for clean air, progress has slowed in
recent years, particularly in the San Joaquin Valley. Some places,
including the Bay Area and the Coachella Valley, have seen air
quality worsen.</TE>
<TE>   "The ARB has rattled its saber, but must still take up the sword,"
said Todd Campbell, policy director for the Coalition for Clean Air.</TE>
<TE>   Some smog-reduction options are politically difficult. Air
pollution agencies are prohibited from imposing detailed emissions
permits on farms, for example, although some pollute more than
factories. And some major polluters, such as airports, harbors and
rail yards, are primarily under federal jurisdiction and have gone
largely unregulated.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature also has limited the regulation of aerosol spray
cans, although they are big contributors to the 267 tons of
hydrocarbons produced each day by consumer products. Hydrocarbons mix
with other chemicals in the presence of sunlight to form ozone, an
abundant pollutant that irritates lungs and causes headaches and
shortness of breath.</TE>
<TE>   Each day, 25 million vehicles and thousands of businesses
statewide release about 14 million pounds of smog-forming chemicals
into the air. With about 550,000 new residents added to the state
each year, cleaning California's air is a constant battle.</TE>
<TE>   The state's smoggiest regions must pursue tough measures to meet a
target in the federal Clean Air Act of healthy air year-round by 2005
in the San Joaquin Valley and by 2010 in all parts of the Los Angeles
Basin.</TE>
<TE>   If all the control measures are approved, about 500 tons of
smog-forming pollutants and 50 tons daily of soot and smoke would be
eliminated statewide by 2010. Additional measures, such as controls
for ships, trains and construction equipment, could yield an
additional reduction of 150 tons per day, officials say. State
officials estimate that implementing the plan would cost about $2.3
billion over the next several years. But officials say the benefits
would outweigh the costs by 3 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   The plan identifies agriculture as a big target for cleanup. In
the San Joaquin Valley, livestock waste has surpassed vehicles as the
top source of smog-forming fumes. Among the controls proposed for
farms are reformulated feedstock, manure management, restrictions on
pesticide spraying, and cleaner tractors and irrigation pumps.</TE>
<TE>   "The emissions are very high, and we have to figure out a way to
reduce them." Kenny said.</TE>
<TE>   But Ed Yates, senior vice president of the California League of
Food Processors, said such approaches are misguided.</TE>
<TE>   "Our contribution to air pollution is minuscule," Yates said.</TE>
<TE>   Diesel engines, including trucks and buses, must have add-on
controls, including soot traps and catalysts, Kenny said. Those
devices may be prescribed for trash trucks when the ARB meets in
June.</TE>
<TE>   The plan also identifies strategies to reduce pollution in
low-income and minority communities, reduce greenhouse gases linked
to global warming and trim releases of toxic air emissions.</TE>
<TE>   Public workshops on the plan are scheduled around the state April
2-11. The ARB is scheduled to consider approval of the proposal when
it meets April 25-26 in Sacramento.</TE>

<DH>Immigration: Orange County entrepreneur will press
President Fox on emigre rights.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When President Vicente Fox meets a group of U.S. residents in Mexico
this week, Orange County restaurateur Carlos Olamendi will be among
them, lobbying for immigrants' rights.</LD>
<LD>   The Republican from Laguna Niguel wants immigrants like himself to
have the right to vote in Mexican elections and to be able to cross
the border freely. But he opposes government assistance, such as
welfare or housing subsidies, to immigrants and others. Instead of
invoking the name of former Gov. Pete Wilson, who tried to crack down
on illegal immigration during his tenure in the 1990s, Olamendi says
Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush are his role models.</LD>
<LD>   He promotes a U.S. immigration policy that he said "will allow
immigrants to pull themselves up instead of relying on the welfare
model," a term he uses to refer to the network of government and
social service agencies in the United States that give assistance to
the poor.</LD>
<TE>   Olamendi has become a regular at meetings with legislators in
Mexico City and Washington, pushing for measures to give Mexican
immigrants a greater voice in the two countries. Immigrants should be
able to vote in Mexico because they provide one of the greatest
sources of foreign exchange through remittances to family members, he
contends.</TE>
<TE>   Although some may view his positions as contradictory, Olamendi
says he is living his beliefs. He invests in U.S. restaurants that
sell food made from his mother's recipes. He also has a capital
investment project to provide companies with credit in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   To critics who wonder how he can simultaneously salute the White
House and Mexico's presidential seat of power, Los Pinos, he quips,
"We are not going home. We are already here. That's the new reality.
We [immigrants] are a thread tying two nations together."</TE>
<TE>   Olamendi and his group, the National Council of Mexican American
Professionals and Business Leaders, have repeatedly visited Mexico
City to push for a law that would allow emigrants to vote by absentee
ballot.</TE>
<TE>   This week, they are taking nearly 100 people to meet with Fox,
congressmen, election officials and cabinet members, said Omar de la
Torre, director of Mexico's federal Office of Migrant Assistance. The
group has advocated for voting rights before. Now, however, it has
Fox's support. The Mexican legislature has yet to back a proposal.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, the Mexican Chamber of Deputies passed a law allowing
Mexicans outside the country to vote in the 2006 presidential
election, but the Senate did not approve the measure. The law did not
specify how migrants, some of whom obtained so-called dual
nationality after becoming American citizens, could vote, and the
issue was never formally taken up again.</TE>
<TE>   Olamendi, 46, came to the United States illegally as a teenager
and worked in restaurants, earning $2.25 an hour. He received a law
degree in Mexico, then returned to the United States illegally to be
near his dying mother.</TE>
<TE>   He followed in the footsteps of his brother, who had opened a
restaurant in Capistrano Beach in 1973, and opened his own Olamendi's
in Laguna Beach in 1985. He later sold it to a sister. He became a
legal U.S. resident through the 1986 amnesty law, and later sought
citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   Now a father of two children, ages 7 and 12, he owns Olamendi
Express restaurants in Laguna Hills, Mission Viejo and Rancho Santa
Margarita, as well as larger Olamendi's restaurants in San Clemente
and Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, he started COR International, a capital financing company
that offers U.S. financing to Mexican firms at lower rates than are
available in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Closer to home, Olamendi has invested in three immigration
counseling centers in Santa Ana, Fresno and Salinas. The centers help
immigrants regularize their U.S. status, for a fee.</TE>
<TE>   Olamendi's persistent attention to Mexican immigrants and their
culture has not gone unnoticed. Recently, he was one of 36 people
nominated by President Bush to the Presidential Advisory Committee on
Arts and Culture for the John F. Kennedy Performing Arts Center.
Members serve as long as Bush is president.</TE>
<TE>   Olamendi says he owes his success to Reagan, who was president
when the immigration amnesty was approved, and to Republican
legislators whom he lobbied for immigration laws to give Mexican
families the ability to get residency for their family members.</TE>
<TE>   "I was fortunate to get residency through amnesty," Olamendi said.
"Your life changes so drastically.... I realized that our community
must be legitimized for people to get ahead."</TE>

<HD>All 224 Molestation Counts Against Ex-Priest Dismissed</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>A California judge dismissed all 224 sexual molestation charges
against a defrocked San Francisco priest Thursday in a ruling
prosecutors said was based on a "hypertechnical interpretation" of
state law.</LD>
<LD>   The decision, unless overturned on appeal, means San Francisco
County prosecutors cannot try Msgr. Patrick O'Shea, 67, on charges of
molesting nine boys in the 1960s and 1970s.</LD>
<LD>   The O'Shea case has zigzagged though the courts since its filing
in 1995, a year after the California Legislature approved a law
allowing prosecutors to file molestation charges even after the
six-year statute of limitations expired.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors did so in this case, but a state appeals court
dismissed it in 1997, saying the law did not apply retroactively.
Lawmakers then reworked the legislation to make it retroactive and to
allow prosecutors to refile past charges if they were first filed
under the 1994 law.</TE>
<TE>   But Superior Court Judge David Garcia, citing a January decision
from the California Supreme Court on a different sex-abuse case, said
prosecutors could not refile the charges because an appeals court had
dismissed them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a terrible thing," said prosecutor Linda Klee, who said
Garcia's decision was based on a "hypertechnical interpretation of
the law."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys said they would immediately seek O'Shea's
release from San Francisco jail, where he is being held in lieu of $5
million bail.</TE>

<HD>Foundations Are Leaving Their Grants in San Francisco,
Mostly</HD>
<DH>Giving: Bay Area counties get 48% of such funds received in
the state, dwarfing the take of L.A. County, despite its much greater
need.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNE-MARIE O'CONNOR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new study has found huge geographic disparities in California
philanthropy, with San Francisco County getting $418 in foundation
grants per person, while Los Angeles County--which hosts some of the
worst poverty in the state--gets only $45 per person.</LD>
<LD>   The study by the USC Center on Philanthropy and Public Policy
found that grant dollars in California averaged about $28 per person
in 1999, the year studied--and Los Angeles got more than any other
Southern California county.</LD>
<LD>   The six counties in the San Francisco Bay Area, by contrast,
received 48% of California grant dollars, though the area houses only
17% of the state's population.</LD>
<TE>   "It raises questions for foundations to consider," said James
Ferris, the director of the center. "Are there areas in the state
where philanthropy might direct its attention?"</TE>
<TE>   Pete Manzo, the executive director of Los Angeles' Center for
Non-Profit Management, said his group found a similar disparity when
it conducted a study two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very stark," Manzo said. "I would say it hurts across the
board."</TE>
<TE>   "L.A. County is huge, and we do have the lion's share of the needy
population in the state here," Manzo said. "Relative to the level of
need, there's a lot less foundation money available in Los Angeles
than in the Bay Area."</TE>
<TE>   Joe Haggerty, the president of United Way of Greater Los Angeles,
said the disparity may be driven partly by a misperception that
causes out-of-state government grant-makers to divide funding evenly
between California's two major regions.</TE>
<TE>   "People outside of California do not think of the differences
between Los Angeles and San Francisco," Haggerty said.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll say, OK, we'll give half of the money to poor children in
Northern California and half to Southern California," he said. "They
don't think about our greater population and poverty. They may be
spending the same amount of money, but if we have three times the
people and much denser poverty, our per capita amount will be lower."</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco nonprofits have more success than other counties in
attracting grants from out-of-state foundations, the study's authors
say.</TE>
<TE>   Half of the grant dollars going to the Bay Area come from
foundations outside the state--but 70% of the grant dollars for Los
Angeles County come, instead, from California foundations, Ferris
said.</TE>
<TE>   "In Los Angeles they are not as effective in attracting
out-of-state dollars," Ferris said.</TE>
<TE>   And prospective funders from outside California "have a harder
time putting their hands around L.A. County because it's so large,"
Ferris said. "It's harder for people on the East Coast and in the
Midwest to understand L.A. than smaller, more well-defined
communities."</TE>
<TE>   If this sounds like a bizarre arbiter of philanthropy dollars,
other experts agree that the San Francisco effect cannot be
underestimated.</TE>
<TE>   "I think for people on the East Coast, San Francisco is a wannabe
Boston, and they get that," Manzo said. "San Francisco is the kind of
place they would want to set up an office. L.A. they don't get. The
perception is that out-of-stater funders on the East Coast find Los
Angeles hard to understand and plug into."</TE>
<TE>   Another factor, Manzo said, is the existence of several
established Northern California foundations, such as the David and
Lucile Packard Foundation, that give largely in Northern California.
By contrast, the California Wellness Foundation and the California
Endowment in Los Angeles give money statewide.</TE>
<TE>   What the gap means is that "charitable organizations in Los
Angeles County typically are dealing with more need and have fewer
resources than their counterparts in the Bay Area," Manzo said.</TE>
<TE>   Foundation assets in general are heavily concentrated in
California and dominated by a handful of players with more than $1
billion in endowments.</TE>
<TE>   The San Francisco Bay Area's 1,275 foundations make up 51% of the
state's total foundation assets, the study said. Los Angeles County,
with 1,542 foundations, has 40% of the state's foundation assets,
which totaled $68 billion in assets and $2.9 billion in grants in
1999.</TE>
<TE>   Seven of California's 58 counties have no foundations at all, and
eight counties are home to only one foundation, the study found.</TE>
<TE>   But foundation growth in California and the West outpaces the rest
of the nation, and Los Angeles' share of foundation grants could
expand quickly, Manzo said.</TE>
<TE>   "The silver lining is there are a lot of small foundations in L.A.
that don't have a lot of assets now, but a generation from now the
picture may change dramatically," Manzo said. "I think it will, but
we're not there yet."</TE>

<HD>Landmark's Upscale Neighbor</HD>
<DH>Development: The $160-million Grove retail complex opens
today, replete with lavish details. It's a big contrast to the homey
Farmers Market next door.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTHA GROVES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles landmark since 1934, the homespun and quirky Farmers
Market is poised to become even more of a destination with the
opening today of an elegant, if glitzy, retail and restaurant complex
called the Grove.</LD>
<LD>   That is, if the clientele can stomach the traffic.</LD>
<LD>   The $160-million open-air center--loaded with Venetian glass
chandeliers and hand-laid granite and limestone--will feature a
double-decker trolley, a Nordstrom, a Nikegoddess store, a revival of
Madame Wu's famed restaurant and a "dancing waters" display straight
out of Las Vegas.</LD>
<TE>   Developer Rick Caruso's extravagant projects in Encino, Calabasas,
Thousand Oaks and Westlake Village have proved to be big draws for
the suburban set.</TE>
<TE>   But with the Grove, Caruso is bringing his bells-and-whistles
shopping center concept to an urban environment for the first time.
The gamble here is that the center, located far from any freeway,
counts on Angelenos to navigate already clogged surface streets.</TE>
<TE>   The Grove, just east of the venerable Farmers Market at 3rd and
Fairfax, is all new, but it has the look--ersatz though it might
be--of a sophisticated small-town main street. Completing the
atmosphere are a park-like "village square," meandering walks,
outdoor cafes and street lamps with painstakingly positioned
lightbulbs to take best advantage of the stained, leaded glass.</TE>
<TE>   "We've married something new and fresh to something old and
historic," Caruso said.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso also is president of the Los Angeles Police Commission, but
even as the commission considers the future of Chief Bernard C.
Parks, he has found time to peek over the shoulders of craftsmen
rushing to meet today's deadline.</TE>
<TE>   The builder's attention to detail is evident throughout, from the
hand-laid mosaics in the floors and walks to the Broadway-style
marquee outside the 14-screen Pacific Theatres multiplex.</TE>
<TE>   For weeks, he has strolled the 575,000-square-foot project at all
hours to ensure that it will be ready--"down to the last pansy"--for
its debut. There are also more than 900 rose bushes and 25 mature
sycamore, jacaranda, coral and magnolia trees shipped from across the
nation at a cost of $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Leaving nothing to chance, Caruso even enlisted a feng shui expert
to ensure a harmonious flow of energy. One result: curved lines in
buildings and paths, since straight lines are ill advised.</TE>
<TE>   Everywhere are signs of efforts to blend old and new. The
architecture is a mix of Art Deco, classical, Spanish colonial
revival, mission and contemporary. At the eastern edge is a building
with a copper dome that could pass for a town hall but instead houses
Abercrombie &amp; Fitch.</TE>
<TE>   To design the red and green, brass-trimmed trolley that runs
through the Grove and connects it with the Farmers Market, Caruso
hired George McGinnis, a retired Walt Disney "imagineer" who also
worked on the Disneyland monorail and Space Mountain rides.</TE>
<TE>   The trolley looks like something out of "Meet Me in St. Louis,"
but it will be the first U.S. transit "system" to use
state-of-the-art inductive power technology. Each time the trolley
passes over a coil near its storage building, power will be
transferred across a one-inch air gap to the vehicle's battery.</TE>
<TE>   Intrigued by the Bellagio's dancing waters in Las Vegas, Caruso
hired the architects of that attraction, Wet Design of Universal
City, which also engineered the torch for the recent Winter Olympics.
The result is the Grove's massive fountain, from which choreographed
jets will shoot as high as 70 feet in time to four musical
selections--all handpicked by Caruso, of course.</TE>
<TE>   Music will be piped throughout the center, with speakers hidden in
pillars and potted plants. And speaking of pots, Caruso hates seeing
water stains on sidewalks near planters. His solution? Outfit each
Italian pot with a drainage system.</TE>
<TE>   The chandeliers for the new 3,000-seat movie complex? Straight
from Venice. The Euro-style snack kiosks on the lawn? Also direct
from Italy, complete with Italian artisans to assemble them. (Don't
call them kiosks, though. Caruso prefers "pavilions.")</TE>
<TE>   At $278 a square foot, the project is deemed quite expensive, but
"that's what he does," said Chris Wilson, a commercial real estate
broker. Only the most successful retailers can afford the rent for a
Caruso development, brokers say.</TE>
<TE>   Toy seller FAO Schwarz, for example, is closing two other Southern
California stores and considers its Grove location a flagship for the
region.</TE>
<TE>   Massive Traffic Snarls Feared</TE>
<TE>   The new attractions have many nearby residents predicting massive
traffic snarls.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who live in this area have no idea the nightmare that
will start" today, said Jamie Wooten, a TV writer and producer who
lives nearby. But Wooten acknowledges that he's thrilled at the
prospect of so much quality retail to spiff up his neighborhood. He
is equally glad that he won't have to drive to get to it.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, he said, the Grove will be a "good thing if you have
feet, a skateboard or a bicycle."</TE>
<TE>   Diana Plotkin, president of the Beverly Wilshire Homes Assn., said
residents negotiated a traffic mitigation fund with Caruso. As soon
as the Grove gets up and running, a consultant will analyze the
traffic patterns to see whether residents should push for new speed
bumps or stop signs.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso said he is well aware that snarled traffic could prove a
formidable stumbling block. Although Caruso made some road
improvements himself, the city has yet to complete other promised
changes, such as left-turn lanes and traffic lights.</TE>
<TE>   Customers will be able to enter the Grove's 3,500-space parking
garage by turning from 3rd Street, Fairfax Avenue or Beverly
Boulevard onto new streets that Caruso installed. For the time being,
Caruso has hired traffic officers to keep things moving.</TE>
<TE>   "Our whole theory here is to make the experience nice," he said.
"We don't want customers frustrated trying to get to the place."</TE>
<TE>   The Grove's centerpiece is the 80,000-square-foot multiplex, which
Caruso's team designed. Each theater features a curved, wall-to-wall
screen and stadium-style seating. For $2 above the standard $9.50
ticket price, patrons may sit in reserved leather seats, with loges
available for small parties.</TE>
<TE>   Created in the style of a grand hotel, the lobby includes original
art, club chairs and mahogany pillars, topped by back-lighted onyx.
Patrons will purchase tickets inside at a hotel registry-style
counter or pick up pre-ordered tickets from the theater's concierge.</TE>
<TE>   Overlooking the lobby will be the balcony of Madame Wu's Asian
Bistro, a reincarnation of a favorite Los Angeles eatery that closed
in 1998. Madame Wu's will open next month.</TE>
<TE>   In years past, all this might have seemed like a pipe dream. A.F.
Gilmore Co., owner of the Farmers Market, sought for nearly two
decades to develop this parcel. A couple of deals fell through before
the Gilmore people met Caruso.</TE>
<TE>   Still, they were concerned about whether Caruso's style would be
compatible "with the market, which is kind of eclectic and misfit,"
said Hank Hilty, Gilmore's president and chief executive. Hilty is
pleased that Caruso used the Farmers Market as an anchor for the
project. A fourth-generation owner of the property, Hilty traces the
storied corner's history. After his great-grandfather bought the
property in 1880, he operated a dairy farm there. Not long after, oil
was discovered, giving rise to Gilmore Oil Co., which sold gasoline
in the nation's first self-service "gaseterias." At various times,
the company also operated a ball field and a stadium featuring midget
car races, rodeos and boxing matches. Until the mid-1970s, the site
of the Grove was a drive-in theater, with a difference: benches for
customers who walked in.</TE>
<TE>   Serving as a transition between the old Farmers Market and the
Grove will be a 170,000-square-foot expansion built by the Gilmore
Co., featuring shops and eateries. Hilty notes that, despite its
kitschy reputation, the Farmers Market originally was where Beverly
Hills matrons bought their produce. Now, the addition of the upscale
Grove shopper "is a natural for us."</TE>

<HD>O.C. Judge Calls Bid to Drop From Race 'Honorable'</HD>
<DH>Election: Jurist facing molestation charge says his move
doesn't imply guilt. L.A. County court will rule on his request.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County Judge Ronald C. Kline's decision to drop his reelection
bid is "the honorable thing to do" but should not be viewed as an
admission of guilt in the child molestation and child pornography
charges he faces, according to a statement released Thursday by his
defense lawyer.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement is the first time the Superior Court judge's camp
has explained his attempt to withdraw from the November election and
offers an insight into the toll the charges are taking on him.</LD>
<LD>   The charges have inflicted "an unbearable strain" upon the judge,
according to the statement released by attorney Paul S. Meyer. "For
these reasons, and with a complete understanding that he is not
guilty of these state charges, he asked that his name be removed from
the ballot," the statement says.</LD>
<TE>   Kline's effort to withdraw from the race stalled Thursday morning,
when Orange County's presiding judge, Frederick Horn, ruled that the
case presents an obvious conflict of interest for any Orange County
judge. The matter will be moved to Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Kline, 61, sat on the Orange County bench for six years until
criminal charges were filed against him last year. He continues to
receive his $136,244 annual salary as a judge, but a federal court
placed him under house arrest, saying he is a threat to children.</TE>
<TE>   If Kline fails in his bid to drop out, his name will appear on the
November general election ballot against the as-yet-unknown winner of
a write-in campaign to unseat him. If his bid succeeds, the contest
will most likely feature the top two write-in candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Though legal experts give Kline little chance of succeeding in his
effort to withdraw, Meyer on Wednesday argued that it was in the best
interest of voters to allow the judge to pull out.</TE>
<TE>   If Kline is forced to remain, "the voters of Orange County will be
harmed in that they will be asked to vote on a candidate who no
longer desires to be a candidate for judge," Meyer argued in court
documents.</TE>

<HD>Dog Owner Not Badly Hurt, Expert Testifies</HD>
<DH>Mauling: Her injuries would have been worse had she
shielded attack victim, witness says.</DH>

<LD>A San Francisco attorney whose dog fatally mauled a neighbor probably
would have suffered severe injuries if she had attempted to shield
the victim as the defense has argued, a prosecution witness testified
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Randall Lockwood, a canine behavior specialist who said he
reviewed all the testimony and evidence in the case, testified that
defendant Marjorie Knoller's injuries appeared "inhibited" and showed
she was not as close to the attack as the defense has portrayed.</LD>
<LD>   "They suggest to me that she was probably at some distance, at
least a few feet" away from the dog and victim Diane Whipple, said
Lockwood, a vice president of the U.S. Humane Society.</LD>
<TE>   "In a situation where there is close physical proximity between
one victim being bitten severely and another person who is close at
hand, I would expect at least some redirected bites that were of
equal severity to the bites the victim received," Lockwood testified.</TE>
<TE>   Whipple, a 33-year-old lacrosse coach, died from bleeding and
asphyxiation in the hallway just outside her San Francisco apartment
Jan. 26, 2001. She had been attacked by two Presa Canarios owned by
Knoller and her husband, Robert Noel. The dogs, Bane and Hera, have
since been destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller and Noel, who lived two doors down from Whipple, are on
trial in Los Angeles on charges of involuntary manslaughter and
keeping a vicious animal. Knoller, who was present during the attack,
also is charged with second-degree murder.</TE>
<TE>   The trial was moved to Los Angeles County Superior Court because
of extensive pretrial publicity in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller testified this week that the bites she suffered were less
severe because the dog recognized her and backed off. She tearfully
testified that she tried to stop the attack on Whipple by yelling at
Bane, jerking its leash and throwing her body on top of Whipple to
try to protect her.</TE>
<TE>   During her cross-examination of Lockwood, Knoller's attorney,
Nedra Ruiz, asked whether her client was bitten because she had
interfered in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   "She was attempting to interfere," Lockwood replied.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller's wounds and torn clothing showed that she made some
efforts to hold Bane back, but did not "imply that she was there for
a long time on top of [Whipple's] body," he testified.</TE>
<TE>   In other testimony Thursday, San Francisco Police Sgt. Leslie
Forrestal said Knoller had blood on her face, hair, sweatshirt and
hands right after the attack, and appeared to have been in close
contact with the victim.</TE>
<TE>   Closing statements in the case are expected to begin Monday.</TE>

<HD>Carmine 'Bud' Mennella, 80; Trained TV Star J. Fred Muggs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carmine "Bud" Mennella, the trainer of J. Fred Muggs, the chimpanzee
who helped save NBC's long-running "Today" show from ratings gloom in
the 1950s, died in Tampa, Fla., Sunday. He was 80 and had suffered
from Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.</LD>
<LD>   Mennella had aspired to a career as an opera singer but was
impeded by terrible stage fright and instead went to work as an NBC
page.</LD>
<LD>   At the network he met his partner, LeRoy Waldron, with whom he
later opened a pet shop in Glen Rock, N.J. An animal importer told
them of a chimp newly arrived from French Cameroon. Mennella was
enchanted from the moment he laid eyes on the 10-month-old simian,
and borrowed $600 to buy him.</LD>
<TE>   Trading on his NBC contacts, Mennella put Muggs to work. After a
successful appearance on the Perry Como show, Muggs landed an
audition in early 1953 with the year-old "Today" show, NBC's
experiment in early-morning news programming that was slumping badly
in the ratings.</TE>
<TE>   On the morning of the audition, Muggs and his trainers were
delayed by icy roads and missed the appointment. They retired to a
nearby coffee shop, where Muggs had a doughnut and began dunking it
in a cup of coffee.</TE>
<TE>   A small crowd gathered. Among the fascinated were an NBC executive
and James Dean, the movie heartthrob.</TE>
<TE>   The next thing Mennella knew, "the president of NBC said, 'I want
the chimp.'"</TE>
<TE>   The magnetic Muggs was signed to a contract and, to the dismay of
"Today" show host Dave Garroway and other serious journalists, became
a sensation.</TE>
<TE>   Dubbed Garroway's "right-hand monkey," he sat on the anchorman's
lap, his leash concealed and held by Mennella or Waldron, who hid
under the desk. Garroway bantered with and interviewed him. Muggs
played in skits, accumulating a wardrobe of 450 outfits.</TE>
<TE>   Children threw tantrums if their parents didn't let them watch
Muggs; soon the parents were hooked, too. The "Today" show's ratings
rocketed within weeks, and two dozen new sponsors were signed. Fan
mail poured in for Muggs.</TE>
<TE>   Although Garroway appeared to enjoy his sidekick on air, Muggs'
fame irked him. "[It] was an open secret at Radio City that the two
were on-again, off-again pals," Robert Metz wrote in his 1977 book
"The Today Show: An Inside Look at 25 Tumultuous Years."</TE>
<TE>   According to Mennella, Garroway took revenge in various ways,
trying to slam Muggs' hands in a drawer and spiking his orange juice
with drugs to make him misbehave.</TE>
<TE>   "The sad thing was, Muggs loved Dave," the trainer told the St.
Petersburg Times several years ago. "But Dave was so jealous of Muggs
being famous that it began to eat at him."</TE>
<TE>   To mark the first anniversary of Muggs' Today debut, Garroway
planned a gag: He would present the chimp with a real NBC contract on
the air and ask him to sign up for another year. As Garroway scripted
it, Muggs would spurn the contract for a nearby banana.</TE>
<TE>   But Muggs spurned the hi-jinks instead. "As businesslike as J.P.
Morgan, J. Fred gingerly snatched the pen proffered by his TV master
and fractured everyone by signing on the dotted line. Believe it or
not--and Garroway couldn't--the baby ape made a genuine X,"
television editor Leslie Lieber reported in The Times in 1954.</TE>
<TE>   Although Mennella never indicated otherwise, he perhaps knew that
the laugh would be on "Today's" human host. Muggs, he told The Times
after the incident, "hates bananas."</TE>
<TE>   After almost five years, Muggs' contract expired at NBC. The
reasons were disputed by Mennella, who claimed Muggs was let go
because Garroway was jealous. But Metz, the "Today" show chronicler,
said it was because Muggs had become a very strong and unruly chimp
who took a nip out of Martha Raye during a rehearsal and chomped on
Garroway's cheek.</TE>
<TE>   When NBC made the termination public, the press release said Muggs
was leaving to "extend his personal horizons."</TE>
<TE>   He appeared on television variety shows and performed around the
world alongside Bob Hope, Judy Garland and other celebrities.</TE>
<TE>   In 1972 he moved to Florida with Mennella, Waldron and Mennella's
son, Gerald Preis, to perform at Busch Gardens. The team stayed there
when Muggs retired three years later.</TE>
<TE>   Mennella gave Muggs his own cottage, complete with a television, a
radio and thousands of autographed celebrity pictures. The compound,
which had a yard landscaped like a jungle, was also shared by Muggs'
girlfriend, a chimp named Phoebe B. Beebe, who sometimes joined him
on the "Today" show.</TE>
<TE>   Mennella was so protective of Muggs after the chimp retired that
he refused newspaper requests to photograph him. This contributed to
rumors that Muggs was dead.</TE>
<TE>   On the 40th anniversary of the "Today" show in 1992, Muggs was
spoofed on-air in a segment called "Unsolved Miseries," which
concluded that the chimp had been "fertilizing daffodils" for years.
Mennella, who had tried in vain to earn royalties every time tapes of
Muggs were aired, was not amused. "He made millions for NBC, and this
is the way he's treated," the trainer told the Orlando Sentinel
Tribune at the time. "It's nothing to make fun of."</TE>
<TE>   The controversy apparently was laid to rest in 1998 when a Florida
fish and game officer investigating a break-in at the Mennella
compound asked to see Muggs. He later told a local paper that he was
shown a healthy, mature chimp named Muggs.</TE>
<TE>   But the officer fined Mennella $5 for possessing wildlife without
a valid permit. Mennella had to appear in court to clear up the
matter. "I was insulted," he said later, "that they could treat Fred
like an animal and not a person."</TE>

<LD>Citing the state budget shortage, a salary commission Thursday
refused to raise the pay of top elected California officials,
including the governor, legislators and statewide officers.</LD>
<LD>   It marked the second year in a row that the California Citizens
Compensation Commission failed to approve increases for the state's
top officials, who are among the highest paid in the country.</LD>
<LD>   Commission Chairman Claude Brinegar, a retired oil company
executive, and Nicholas Bavaro, owner of a benefits management
business, said they had received "rare" letters from several Assembly
members who asked that salaries not be increased because of the
state's projected budget shortfall.</LD>
<TE>   A pay boost, Brinegar told the commission, would be inappropriate
and badly timed. All four commissioners present voted against an
increase, and a raise will not be considered again until next year.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis' authorized salary is $175,000 a year, but he
accepts only $165,000, a spokeswoman said. At $179,000 and $177,000,
respectively, only New York Gov. George Pataki and Michigan Gov. John
Engler are paid more.</TE>
<TE>   Rank and file members of the California Legislature are paid
$99,000 annually, the highest in the land.</TE>
<TE>   The commission, whose members were appointed by former Gov. Pete
Wilson, last approved pay raises in 2000. They totaled 6.1% for Davis
and other statewide officers. Republican Party leaders in the
Legislature also got a $7,000 annual pay increase to match the pay of
Democratic leaders.</TE>
<TE>   The commission stirred controversy in 1998 when it approved, with
virtually no public notice, pay raises of 26% to 34%. At the time,
state employees had gone without an increase for three years and were
demonstrating daily for higher pay.</TE>

<HD>State Agency Fined $69,500</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A state political watchdog agency fined the Department of Water
Resources $69,500 on Thursday for waiting too long to tell 52 energy
consultants that they must publicly disclose any potential financial
conflicts of interest.</LD>
<LD>   The fine is the first of its kind against a state agency, and
officials said it was intended to warn bureaucrats that they must
make such revelations a top priority even amid a crisis.</LD>
<LD>   The four appointees on the Fair Political Practices
Commission--there is one vacancy--voted unanimously to force the
water resources department to shift $69,500 back to the state general
fund from its $576-million annual budget.</LD>
<TE>   The fine stems from the department's rapid expansion in January
2001, when it was ordered by the governor to begin purchasing
electricity for 27 million Californians served by three practically
bankrupt utilities.</TE>
<TE>   With blackouts looming, the department quickly hired dozens of
consultants to buy electricity by the hour and negotiate longer-term
deals. Not until June did department officials tell the consultants
that they must fill out paperwork describing their sources of income
and ownership of stock and real estate.</TE>
<TE>   State employees and some consultants, depending on the scope of
their duties, are required to submit such information within 30 days
of hire.</TE>
<TE>   Once department consultants filled out the forms in July, it
became clear that several owned stock in companies from which they
were buying electricity. Five spot power traders were fired as a
result.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Russo, the political practices commission's enforcement
chief, told commissioners that the $69,500 fine against the water
department was strictly for missed deadlines and would not preclude
other penalties for alleged conflicts of interest by department
consultants, some of whom participated in electricity deals involving
millions of state dollars. The FPPC settled on the fine after
negotiating with a private attorney hired by the water department to
represent its top officials.</TE>
<TE>   Russo refused to comment on whether related investigations are
pending.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Bill Jones argued Thursday that taxpayers
should not have to shoulder the penalty. As a Republican candidate
for governor, he began calling on the administration of Gov. Gray
Davis in June to release conflict of interest statements from
department consultants.</TE>
<TE>   The consultants should be forced to pay the fines, Jones said. He
blamed Davis--not department officials--for poor oversight, and he
urged the attorney general to investigate whether some multiple-year
electricity contracts signed by the state should be invalidated by
potential conflicts of interest.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want this late filing fee buck-passing to be the end of
the story," said Jones, who was defeated in the March 5 primary
election.</TE>
<TE>   A team of six FPPC investigators had considered imposing fines on
several top water department officials but decided to charge the
agency as a whole because the failure to get statements of economic
interest submitted on time "appeared to be the product of many
people's actions," Russo said.</TE>
<TE>   The fines would be paid by the department no matter what, he said,
because the employees were acting in the scope of their state duties.</TE>
<TE>   Though the $69,500 fine is relatively severe by FPPC standards, it
is much less than the maximum $260,000 that could have been levied,
Russo said.</TE>

<HD>State Senate OKs License Plate to Honor Victims of Sept. 11</HD>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The Senate voted unanimously Thursday to create a special license
plate to memorialize the victims of the Sept.11 attacks and to spend
the revenue on scholarships and the fight against terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Action on the bill by Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City)
all but assured that it will become law in the next week or so when
it reaches Gov. Gray Davis, who has endorsed it.</LD>
<LD>   On a 29-0 vote, the Senate sent the bill back to the Assembly for
approval of changes made in the Senate. There was no debate.</LD>
<TE>   Proponents have estimated that sales of the memorial plates would
start in midsummer. The special plates, modeled after similar
programs in other states, would sell for $50 each and could be
renewed for $40. In Michigan, 10,000 memorial plates were sold during
the first month they were available.</TE>
<TE>   Under the bill (AB 1759), 85% of the revenue from the plates would
be spent on state and local anti-terrorism efforts. The remaining 15%
would be earmarked for college scholarships for dependents of
Californians killed in the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>

<HD>Walter Rockler, 81; Prosecutor at the Nuremberg Trials</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ADAM BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walter Rockler, a lawyer who prosecuted Nazi-era German bankers and
industrialists during the Nuremberg trials of the late 1940s and at
his death was a senior partner at the Washington law firm of Arnold &amp;
Porter, has died. He was 81.</LD>
<LD>   Rockler died March 8 at his home in Rockville, Md. He had been
battling lung cancer.</LD>
<LD>   He was often called upon to discuss his role at Nuremberg, which
he came to regard as a definitive part of his life.</LD>
<TE>   He was a year out of law school when he joined the war crimes
chief counsel's office in 1947. For the next two years in Germany, he
successfully prosecuted several cases against business executives and
bankers charged with Nazi collaboration.</TE>
<TE>   Decades later, Rockler was called back into government service to
identify and deport Nazis who were in the United States illegally. In
1979 and 1980, he served as the first director of the Justice
Department's Office of Special Investigation. The Immigration and
Naturalization Service had previously performed that office's duties.</TE>
<TE>   The experience at Nuremberg left him with mixed feelings.</TE>
<TE>   The trials "had important symbolic value ... but no substantial
impact," he said in 1995 at a conference marking the proceedings'
50th anniversary. "Wars and savagery have not been deterred, and I
see no prospect that they will be deterred or punished in the near
future.</TE>
<TE>   "You almost can't exonerate any country in the world from
violations of the Nuremberg principles," he added.</TE>
<TE>   He also used his Nuremberg experience to criticize the NATO-led
bombing of the former Yugoslavia during the 1990s. He said the
bombing violated a key assertion of Supreme Court Justice Robert
Jackson, who headed the U.S. prosecution staff at Nuremberg, that
there was no economic or political justification for acts of
aggression.</TE>
<TE>   In a controversial 1999 essay in the Chicago Tribune, Rockler
wrote: "The rationale that we are simply enforcing international
morality, even if it were true, would not excuse the military
aggression and widespread killing that it entails. It also does not
lessen the culpability of the authors of this aggression."</TE>
<TE>   Rockler was intrigued when former Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev started the Foundation for the Development of Democracy and
World Peace in 2000 to foster ties between the U.S. and Russia.
Rockler became a board member and did legal and tax work for the
organization.</TE>
<TE>   Walter James Rockler was born in Minneapolis and grew up in
Chicago. He was a 1940 graduate of the University of Chicago and a
1946 graduate of Harvard University's law school.</TE>
<TE>   After Japanese language training, he served in the Marine Corps
during World War II, doing intelligence work in the Pacific theater.
His decorations included the Bronze Star and Navy Commendation Medal.</TE>
<TE>   He spent the last 36 years at Arnold &amp; Porter, part of the time as
head of its tax section. He had worked in general practice in Chicago
and New York before being recruited by the firm.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include his wife of 52 years, Aino Allekand Rockler of
Rockville; four children, James Rockler of Boulder, Colo., Nicolas
Rockler of Boston and Elliot Rockler and Julia Tillery, both of
Derwood, Md.; a brother; and nine grandchildren.</TE>

<LD>   San Bernardino County Dist. Atty. Dennis Stout withdrew from the
November runoff election Thursday, throwing the race to Deputy Dist.
Atty. Mike Ramos.</LD>
<LD>   In last week's primary, Stout received 10,000 fewer votes than
Ramos, though Ramos failed to win the 50% plus one needed to avert a
runoff.</LD>
<TE>   "The voters have given me the message that they desire change,"
Stout, 54, said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Ramos, 44, and the other challenger in the primary, defense
attorney Frank Guzman, had seized on a scandal involving Stout and
county Supervisor Jerry Eaves.</TE>
<TE>   In March 2001, Stout acknowledged that he made "errors in
judgment" when he secretly aided Eaves' political opponent even as
Stout was investigating Eaves in a corruption and bribery scandal.
The D.A.'s office kept the opponent apprised of the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   After Stout then recused his office from prosecuting Eaves, Eaves
reached an agreement with the attorney general's office, which took
over the case, and pleaded no contest to seven misdemeanor counts.</TE>

<HD>Thomas Winship, 81; Editor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thomas Winship, who led the Boston Globe to 12 Pulitzer Prizes during
nearly two decades as the paper's editor, died Thursday. He was 81.</LD>
<LD>   Winship died at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston after a
long battle with lymphoma.</LD>
<LD>   As editor from 1965 to 1984, Winship inherited a paper that had
not distinguished itself nationally or even locally, where it was not
rated among the best of the six papers in town. One of his first
steps was removing the ads that had regularly run on the paper's
front page.</LD>
<TE>   Within a year after Winship took over, the Globe won a Pulitzer
Prize for a series of stories on the nomination of a Kennedy family
retainer as a federal judge. The articles led to the withdrawal of
the nomination.</TE>
<TE>   A decade later the Globe won the Pulitzer for public service for
its coverage of Boston's desegregation and busing crisis.</TE>
<TE>   ''The thing that strikes me about him is that he was the perfect
editor for the Boston Globe at the perfect time,'' said Washington
Post vice president and former executive editor Ben Bradlee, who met
Winship at Harvard, worked with him at the Post and remained a
lifelong friend. ''That was a difficult time, lots of different
factions, and he was a great healer in that sense.''</TE>
<TE>   ''He was one of the finest editors of our time,'' said Gene
Roberts, former executive editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer. ''He
had a vision for his paper, and I thought the Globe came a long way
under him. He was a force in journalism generally.''</TE>
<TE>   For much of his tenure as editor, Winship also supervised the
Globe's editorial page. In that capacity, he put an end to the
casual, folksy style that had been a signature of the paper and
demanded hard-hitting editorials.</TE>
<TE>   He held control of the news and editorial positions until 1981,
when--as is the practice at many other major papers--the two
operations became separate and the editorial page editor began
reporting to the publisher.</TE>
<TE>   An early opponent of the Vietnam War, Winship's Globe was the
second paper in the country, behind the St. Louis Globe-Dispatch, to
call for a complete U.S. withdrawal. That came in 1967, and each
Friday the Globe ran a front-page tally of the U.S. servicemen killed
in the previous week's fighting in the war.</TE>
<TE>   By Winship's retirement, the Globe had a reputation for strong
investigative and international reporting, and its influence on
Boston politics had grown considerably.</TE>
<TE>   ''He took this newspaper to new heights, and his devotion to it
never diminished,'' Publisher Richard Gilman said.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Cambridge, Mass., Winship attended Harvard University and
served in the Coast Guard during World War II. He began his
journalism career at the Washington Post in 1945, serving as a
political and city reporter. He served briefly as press secretary to
Sen. Leverett Saltonstall (R-Mass.).</TE>
<TE>   In 1956 Winship joined the Globe, where his father, Laurence, was
editor. Taking over in 1965, Thomas quickly built a reputation for
hiring aggressive young reporters.</TE>
<TE>   When he became editor, the circulation of the Globe, then
published mornings and evenings, was 373,897 daily and 527,969 on
Sundays. During his tenure it increased to 520,000 daily and 792,786
on Sundays.</TE>
<TE>   Now owned by New York Times Co., the paper's current circulation
is 465,813 daily and 716,467 on Sundays.</TE>
<TE>   The most dramatic local story during Winship's tenure was Boston's
busing crisis in 1974.</TE>
<TE>   ''When the worst racial turmoil in a decade flared and politicians
from City Hall to the White House ran for cover or poured gasoline on
the flames, Tom Winship put the Boston Globe literally in the line of
fire with nothing more than the highest of journalistic values as the
arrows in his quiver,'' then-Globe reporter Thomas Oliphant wrote in
a tribute last year for the American Society of Newspaper Editors.</TE>
<TE>   Winship was past president of the group.</TE>
<TE>   Winship later said he regretted not ''taking a broader view'' on
integration, saying he would still support the idea but would have
urged more gradual integration, starting with lower grades, and
involving the suburbs as well as the city.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1998 Journal of Media Studies article, Winship said he also
regretted telling columnists not to sound off on the matter for two
weeks during the height of the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   He also regretted, as managing editor, calling the 1960
presidential election for John F. Kennedy as soon as the polls had
closed.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, it took another day for the razor-thin election to become
official.</TE>
<TE>   After he retired, Winship was the founding chairman of the
International Center for Journalists, a nonprofit institute offering
seminars to journalists from the Third World.</TE>
<TE>   He also served as a director of the African-American Institute and
the Committee to Protect Journalists, and as an advisory board member
for the Freedom Forum's Newseum.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife, Elizabeth, retired writer of the
syndicated advice column ''Ask Beth,'' survivors include two sons,
two daughters and a sister.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral arrangements were pending.</TE>

<HD>Timetable Set for Work at Yosemite</HD>
<DH>Parks: Plan calls for more cabins, employee dorms, but
sidesteps parking, campsite issue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTINA BOXALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Criticized for moving too slowly on its restoration plan for Yosemite
Valley, the National Park Service on Thursday released a timetable
that calls for completion of several substantial projects over the
next three years.</LD>
<LD>   The blueprint sidestepped the plan's two most controversial
elements: the number of parking spaces and campsites that will be
allowed in the hugely popular valley. But it signals the service's
intention to move ahead with reconstruction of parts of Yosemite
Lodge damaged in the 1997 floods, removal of Cascades Dam from the
Merced River and building of employee dorms.</LD>
<LD>   The work schedule was drawn up in response to congressional
complaints that a $443-million preservation plan adopted after the
extensive floods was crawling forward at a tortoise-like pace.</LD>
<TE>   "I think the project list is just great," said Rep. George P.
Radanovich (R-Mariposa), who has been critical of some parts of the
restoration document. "It proves there is a lot in the plan that is
moving forward pretty quickly."</TE>
<TE>   The list involves construction or planning for 15 projects, to be
finished by late 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The Yosemite restoration plan, unveiled in late 2000, was designed
to take some of the visitor pressure off the valley by restoring open
space and riverbanks and moving some facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Radanovich, chairman of the national parks subcommittee, has
objected to plans to significantly reduce parking and cut the number
of valley campsites from the 849 pre-flood figure to 500.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists were awaiting release of the project list to see
whether the park service was retreating from more controversial
facets of the plan. Jay Watson, California director of the Wilderness
Society, noted that the hardest decisions are yet to be made but said
he was generally pleased with the work schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "I actually think it demonstrates the park service is committed to
the valley plan and will be moving it forward in the coming years,"
he said. "I'm really encouraged by a number of projects on this
list."</TE>
<TE>   The timetable calls for the park service to have finished $105.1
million worth of projects in the next three years. Among them:</TE>
<TE>   * Construction of cottages to replace the 200 Yosemite Lodge
cabins destroyed in the flood.</TE>
<TE>   * Designing expansion of Camp 4, a walk-in camp in the valley used
primarily by climbers.</TE>
<TE>   * Construction of 10 duplex cabins at Curry Village to replace
flood-damaged facilities.</TE>
<TE>   * The installation of about 70 campsites in the valley, which lost
374 of them in the floods.</TE>
<TE>   * Construction of employee dormitories to replace flood-damaged
housing.</TE>
<TE>   * Removal of the only dam on the park's stretch of the Merced, the
Cascades Dam, built in the 1920s to provide power for the valley but
unused for decades.</TE>
<TE>   * Development of plans to restore to natural habitat the 374
campsites washed out in the flood.</TE>

<HD>The Penalty Was Steep for a Missile Defense Whistle-Blower</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ARIANNA HUFFINGTON</AU>
<BD>Arianna Huffington writes a syndicated column.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last week saw the release of a report from the General Accounting
Office that details how the Pentagon, two major military
contractors--TRW and Boeing--and a team of MIT scientists exaggerated
the success of the nation's first missile defense test, turning an
embarrassing failure into a phony triumph.</LD>
<LD>   As attention-grabbing as this sounds, the report is not really
news to anyone who has followed the case of Nira Schwartz and the
U.S. government versus TRW and Boeing.</LD>
<LD>   Schwartz, a scientist and computer expert, was hired in 1995 by
TRW to test the key component of the missile defense system: the
ability of our missiles to discriminate between incoming enemy
warheads and harmless decoys. She soon discovered that the technology
being used was fatally flawed.</LD>
<TE>   Alarmed by her findings, she approached her boss and insisted that
TRW reveal the problem to the Pentagon. The company responded by
firing her.</TE>
<TE>   Two months later, Schwartz sued TRW under the False Claims Act,
asserting that the defense contractor had knowingly defrauded the
American people. The lawsuit is now in the discovery stage. In the
six years it has taken the case to work its way through a legal maze,
ongoing tests, including the $100-million debacle highlighted in the
GAO report, have only confirmed Schwartz's findings.</TE>
<TE>   By any yardstick, this is a shocking story, affecting both our
national security and the nation's fiscal health. According to a
recent estimate by the Congressional Budget Office, the price tag for
a missile defense system would be more than $230 billion. Worse, by
sacrificing the Antiballistic Missile Treaty on the altar of a
missile defense shield that has been proved not to work, we are
ushering in a new era of nuclear proliferation that will make the
world a far more dangerous place.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Mission Hills), who requested the GAO
report on TRW, makes it clear that he has no "theological problem"
with a missile defense shield.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can prove to me," he said, "that we can build a system
capable of intercepting missiles from rogue nations, and that it will
not bring with it the consequence of restarting an arms race, then
I'm open to it. But the report raises way too many questions about
concealment and fundamental flaws in the technology."</TE>
<TE>   It's not like the information about test failures and fraud has
been flying under the radar. After a judge finally unsealed
Schwartz's suit, the story ended up on the front page of the New York
Times in March 2000, followed by a Dan Rather interview with Schwartz
on CBS.</TE>
<TE>   So the question becomes: What will it take for this story to
penetrate Washington's defenses against critical information
affecting national policy?</TE>
<TE>   "The government's system of checks and balances has badly failed
at every level throughout this process," said Ted Postol an MIT
missile defense expert. "What it's going to take now is stirring the
public imagination and outrage."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it will take dramatizing Schwartz's story and turning her
into the Erin Brockovich of the nuclear arms debate.</TE>
<TE>   It can be difficult to picture Schwartz as the heroine in a David
versus Goliath struggle. She speaks haltingly in a soft, thickly
accented voice (she emigrated from Israel in 1984). But as she tells
her story, it is clear that this is a woman on a moral mission.</TE>
<TE>   "We've wasted a decade and billions of dollars," she said, "in a
quest for a missile defense shield based on a technology that will
never work."</TE>
<TE>   Her commitment to exposing the truth has come at a high price. A
gifted scientist with a PhD in physics and engineering and the holder
of 24 U.S. patents, Schwartz has found herself effectively
blackballed since filing her suit, unable to land a job in her field
despite having sent out more than 300 resumes.</TE>
<TE>   It's a disturbing precedent, especially given the Bush
administration's obsession with secrecy and our elected
representatives' unwillingness to take on a popular wartime
president.</TE>
<TE>   In this kind of political climate, we need courageous
whistle-blowers like Schwartz more than ever. Schwartz is "like a
21st century Paul Revere who is warning that this fundamentally
flawed technology will not protect the American people," said Rep. Ed
Markey (D-Mass.), who has requested a congressional hearing on this
issue.</TE>

<HD>It's Not the Dog That's on Trial, It's the Dog's Owner</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURIE L. LEVENSON</AU>
<BD>Laurie L. Levenson is a professor of law and director
of the Center for Ethical Advocacy at Loyola Law School.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When a dog viciously attacks, do we blame the dog or do we blame the
owners? That is the question at the heart of the dog-mauling trial of
Marjorie Knoller and her husband Robert Noel, now underway in Los
Angeles Superior Court.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, the couple's dog, Bane, tore apart a neighbor, Diane
Whipple, as she stood in her apartment doorway. The couple argues
that it was a tragic accident; prosecutors argue it was a crime.</LD>
<LD>   It is not unusual for defendants to claim they are not responsible
for a crime because they never intended to harm a victim. Even
non-lawyers understand that to be guilty of a crime, a defendant must
both commit a harmful act and possess criminal intent. But there is a
fundamental misunderstanding as to what constitutes criminal intent.</LD>
<TE>   Many people mistakenly believe that as long as they didn't intend
to harm anyone, they are not responsible for the harm they cause. In
fact, the law holds people responsible for harm they intentionally
cause or know is likely to occur.</TE>
<TE>   A classic example is the drunk driver whose intent is to drive
home but who ends up killing an innocent pedestrian along the way.
The drunk driver may disclaim responsibility because he did not
intend to kill anyone when he sat drunk behind the steering wheel.
Yet his actions unquestionably led to the victim's death.</TE>
<TE>   If the drunk realized that he could hurt someone when he drove, he
is guilty of murder. Even if he didn't realize that he could kill
someone but should have, he may still be guilty of manslaughter.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, it may not be enough for Knoller and Noel to claim that
they are not responsible for the death of Whipple because they never
intended for their dog to attack the victim.</TE>
<TE>   The law does not just focus on a defendant's intent at the time of
the attack. Rather, a person is responsible for the harm that
naturally results from actions he or she sets in motion.</TE>
<TE>   If a defendant engages in a series of callous acts that ultimately
result in a predictable harm, that defendant is guilty of a crime.</TE>
<TE>   Most tragic events that occur in our society are the result of a
series of irresponsible actions rather than any one intentional act.
Take, for example, the parent who leaves a loaded gun in the house.
Undoubtedly, the parent does not intend for the gun to be used by a
child to shoot another child. But by leaving the loaded gun around,
the parent has begun a series of events that is likely to end in
tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, a dog owner may be responsible for the acts of her dog
even if she doesn't sic the dog on the victim. If the owner knows she
has a dog that has the tendency to attack and keeps that dog in an
environment where innocent people are at risk, then the owner is
legally responsible if the dog lashes out.</TE>
<TE>   It is no defense that the owner couldn't control the dog at the
time of the attack if the owner could have prevented that situation
from arising in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   Legal responsibility includes responsibility for those acts that
will inevitably lead to harm. The defense in the dog-mauling case is
betting on the jury focusing narrowly on the time of the attack and
believing that Knoller did everything she could at that point to
prevent the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors, however, are constantly reminding jurors that Knoller
and Noel got the ball rolling when they acquired a dog they knew
could be vicious, ignored its prior attacks (including on themselves)
and kept the dog in an environment where they could not guarantee
other people's safety.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors in the dog-mauling case are asking jurors to do what
Americans tend not to do naturally: Look at a person's actions in a
broader context.</TE>
<TE>   Americans have been trained to believe that we do not have a duty
to help our fellow man as long as we do not intentionally harm him.
But that is only half the law. The law also recognizes that our
actions or lack of action, if unreasonable or callous, also makes us
responsible for harm.</TE>
<TE>   In general, we do a poor job of looking out for one another.</TE>
<TE>   We tend to justify our actions by focusing narrowly on the last
set of events before the harm and claim that those actions were out
of our control.</TE>
<TE>   The law, however, offers a broader focus. It asks, who allowed the
dogs out?</TE>

<HD>Suicide Bombing Is Contagious</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANAN R. LURIE</AU>
<BD>Ranan R. Lurie, a senior adjunct fellow at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, is a
syndicated columnist and political cartoonist.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By early 1937, German generals unveiled with pride to Hitler their
new dive bomber and Panzer tank. "We wish that we could have tested
them in real combat," exclaimed one concerned but proud field
marshal. Hitler raised his eyebrow and asked his officer, "Why don't
you send these beautiful machines to the battleground in Spain to
help our fascist friend Gen. Franco?"</LD>
<LD>   The generals did. Germany's planes proved themselves on the
battlefields of Spain. The same planes, with improvements resulting
from battle experience, devastated Poland in 1939. The Third Reich's
new tanks, enhanced and perfected after their Spanish combat
practice, invaded in hours and demolished the lowlands of Holland and
Belgium.</LD>
<LD>   England and France refused to face what Hitler was writing on the
Spanish wall, although the Nazi planes were tearing up the blue
Iberian skies with cannon fire and Nazi attack tanks had bulldozed
Madrid to the ground.</LD>
<TE>   Something similar is happening now in Israel, which is serving as
the Spanish testing ground for future attacks on Philadelphia, Los
Angeles, Washington, London and even Moscow. Should the suicide
bomber--the new secret human tool of terror--prove to be a
successful, unchallenged weapon, there will be plenty of fanatics
ready to take trips to the United States, Britain or France.</TE>
<TE>   There they will join their cells already planted in those
countries, pick up their explosives belts and create the same
devastation and panic that we have seen so often in Jerusalem and Tel
Aviv.</TE>
<TE>   In comparison with a chemical or nuclear device, this weapon is
much less complicated: It consists of a functioning brainwashed true
believer who has deluded himself into thinking that if he blows
himself up and kills as many infidels around him as possible, Allah
will bestow the favors of no less than 72 virgins awaiting him in
Islamic heaven.</TE>
<TE>   To sweeten the deal, Iraq's Saddam Hussein will grant the
surviving families at least $10,000, according to the Israeli press.
This is a win-win for the suicide bomber.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the West will suffer the deaths of innocent civilians,
experience economic chaos and expose itself to constant blackmailing.</TE>
<TE>   If the suicide terrorists succeed and bring Israel to its knees,
the West is likely to be next in line. The intent and hope of the
suicide-bombing industry is to force the infidel Christian in the
West to see the light of the real God (Allah) and surrender to
demands by any terrorist group. With luck and determination, so they
think, the West may even convert to the Islamic faith (Libya's
Moammar Kadafi actually brought up this option in the mid-1970s).</TE>
<TE>   There is almost no way to stop determined suicidal maniacs. All
they need is a passport and a plane ticket. Simple explosives are
readily available at any demolition site or big construction company.</TE>
<TE>   I said "almost" because there is a way to stop this nightmare: The
international community must recognize that Israel is the new Spain.
The West, along with the United Nations, must understand that the
horrifying suicide bombings that are being tested right now in the
Middle East can hit any country, sooner or later.</TE>
<TE>   The world community, led by the U.S., should immediately declare
that this kind of warfare is as illegitimate as nerve gas or mustard
gas. Any organization that supports and sends suicide bombers into
action should be held responsible by the world community. It should
destroy those groups with fury, once and for all.</TE>
<TE>   If we do not defend our civilization against assassins who are
almost at our doors, our children and grandchildren will be at the
mercy of certified lunatics.</TE>

<HD>Reforms Can't Make the INS Terrorist-Proof</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES P. PINKERTON</AU>
<BD>James P. Pinkerton writes a column for Newsday in New
York. E-mail: pinkerto@ix.netcom.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The bad news is that two Al Qaeda terrorists got their student visas
this week, permitting them to attend flight school in Florida. The
worse news is that they won't be needing such training, because they
already figured out how to fly airplanes into the World Trade Center
on Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush says that he is "plenty hot" over the case and vows
reform of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. But the
enduring problem of controlling the flow of people into the U.S. is
deeper than organizational chart-tinkering, because it involves two
realities of American life: first, the problem of making
bureaucracies responsive to fast-moving circumstance; and second,
Americans' deep ambivalence about immigration itself.</LD>
<LD>   No doubt the INS will try harder. Despite the stereotype of
unresponsive bureaucrats, most senior-level officials are acutely
sensitive to public opinion and to bad press. Indeed, the INS has
already issued a statement shifting the blame onto a contractor; it
reports that it approved the visas in July and August--having
received no warning from other federal officials that the two
aspiring students might also be aspiring killers--and then turned
over the forms to a private-sector contractor for mailing.</LD>
<TE>   Part of the problem is that the INS has been trying harder--that
is, trying harder to keep up with past mandates then superseded by
newer mandates.</TE>
<TE>   The INS has been pressured to increase enforcement at the
U.S.-Mexico border, and this boundary monitoring has come at the
expense of monitoring the resident-alien population.</TE>
<TE>   And that's the way of bureaucracies; they're designed to routinely
produce certain predictable outcomes. But to achieve those outcomes,
they must develop an internal culture of norms and procedures, and
over time, standard operating procedure becomes a religion.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, the strength of a bureaucracy--the
industrial-style mass production of vital functions, from collecting
taxes to writing checks--can become its weakness, when suddenly an
order comes down to change everything.</TE>
<TE>   And of course, the weakness of a bureaucracy--the stultification
that comes from unquestioned orthodoxy--can become paralysis.</TE>
<TE>   What any bureaucracy lacks is nuance. Bureaucrats are good at
imposing one-size-fits-all solutions on a big population over a long
period of time.</TE>
<TE>   But what if the goal is to get away from the arbitrary idiocy of,
say, zero-tolerance policies in which obviously harmless items, such
as nail files and prescription drugs, are regarded as lethal
contraband?</TE>
<TE>   What if the mission is to achieve nonbinary solutions, carefully
granulated so that each case is handled according to its unique
characteristics? Forget it.</TE>
<TE>   First, it would take an enormous number of people, and second, the
outcomes achieved by such customization would be hugely unequal--or
at least regarded that way by many.</TE>
<TE>   So can the INS be reformed? Maybe, although the Bush
administration's favored solution--the separation of the paperwork
side of the INS from the enforcement side--gives one pause.</TE>
<TE>   If the problem is that the INS doesn't have adequate internal
communications, such that visas are issued to dead terrorists, will
the problem be solved by dividing this incompetent agency into two
fiefdoms?</TE>
<TE>   No doubt some improvements through "reinvention of government" can
be made; in many parts of the country, such essential services as the
issuance of driver's licenses have been improved markedly.</TE>
<TE>   But no bureaucracy can succeed for long in the absence of a strong
political consensus behind its actions. And that's the problem with
immigration. Americans want to clamp down on illegal immigrants, but
also they see the economic argument for more workers and the
humanitarian argument for family unification.</TE>
<TE>   So even as the INS is supposed to get tough, Congress is going
soft. On Tuesday, the House of Representatives voted by a 2-1 margin
to make visa policy toward Mexico still more lenient. Yes, of course,
there's a difference between lightening up on Mexican families and
cracking down on terrorists. But if the immigration bureaucracy is
ever to be effective, the American people must decide what they want
to do about would-be good citizens as well as would-be terrorists.</TE>

<LD>Now that President Bush and his desperately macho war administration
have played directly into the terrorists' asymmetrical warfare
strategy by changing nuclear doctrine from "last resort" to
retaliation for smallpox, I am truly terrorized by what our
"leadership" is leading us into. Clearly they, and all the alleged
pundits who claim this nuclear posturing is a deterrent, have learned
absolutely nothing from 9/11. This strategy is the complete opposite
of a deterrent. Now the terror groups have a spectacular incentive to
attack and keep attacking until they goad Bush into a nuclear strike.
The subsequent fallout, retaliation and ostracization will bring
about exactly what the terrorists want. We go nuclear, they win.</LD>

<TE>   Six months after 9/11, the U.S. has become the world's biggest
terrorist, with its Afghanistan operation and planning for nuclear
war. If Bush carries out his shortsighted policies, we will soon be
engaged in a military action that will make the Vietnam War look like
child's play.</TE>

the hungry, ending poverty, reducing dependency on oil and protecting

March 9: While the survivors claim that the government didn't
acknowledge the sinking of the Leopoldville until the 1990s, it
received fairly detailed coverage in Samuel Eliot Morison's "History
of U.S. Naval Operations in World War II." This was published in 1986
as part of Volume X, Pages 334 to 337.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>That a jury could hear all the testimony demonstrating Andrea Yates'
mental illness, suicide attempts, depression and history of
hospitalization and still pronounce her guilty is unbelievable (March
13). How unjust Texas law must be not to recognize that one might be
''not guilty by reason of insanity.'' Perhaps the letter of Texas law
should be changed so a more humane interpretation would not condemn
the mentally ill.</LD>
<LD>   Even more outrageous is the possibility of the death penalty. No
punishment, even death, will bring back the lives of her children.
Society does not need to be protected from those who suffer mental
illness. Society's obligation and responsibility are to protect those
who are mentally ill and vulnerable--not to condemn them to prison or
to death.</LD>
<LD>   Lenore Navarro Dowling</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Yates deserves to die. She deliberately, premeditatedly and
methodically murdered her children. Yates wanted to die. She was
unsuccessful at committing suicide, so she committed a capital crime
so that the government would do the job for her. Let her have her
wish before she victimizes anyone else in her quest for
self-punishment.</TE>
<TE>   Rose Mary Leon</TE>
<TE>   Northridge</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Like countless other parents, I suppose, I'm outraged that Yates
now faces a possible death penalty for drowning her own children. I
do not love my own two children because I learned about love in some
self-help book, or through a night-school class--I love them because
I am both human and sane, which makes such love come quite
naturally--no effort at all, believe me.</TE>
<TE>   And so, based on my personal experience, and because Yates seems
to me quite human herself, I can only conclude that she could not
possibly be sane--she must certainly suffer from some form of
insanity, without any doubt, to be able to commit the horrible act
for which she has been found guilty. Severe punishment--and possible
death--for an acute mental and medical problem such as this is not
justice in any sense of that word--and especially not American
justice.</TE>

<TE>   Between the "dead or alive" frontier justice of our Texan
president and the lethal judgments favored by that state's hanging
juries, I'm embarrassed that Texas is part of our union. As an
American I'm proud of and enthralled by our Wild West heritage, but
isn't it time for Texas to join the rest of the civilized world and
hang up its pistols?</TE>

<LD>Re "PUC Pick Could Face Conflicts," March 9: I have known Michael
Peevey for over 25 years. I have been on the opposite side of him on
many environmental and energy issues. However, I can state
unequivocally that Peevey is intelligent, honest, direct and fair and
is a person of integrity.</LD>
<LD>   The attacks on him from consumer and environmental groups are
unfounded and, I must assume, are being made by people who do not
know him. Peevey is eminently qualified to be an impartial member of
the California Public Utilities Commission. I applaud Gov. Gray
Davis' selection of Peevey; Californians can be assured he will
always act in the public interest.</LD>

fact get the opportunity to wield power, they do so with any less
egoism or aggression than do men. The myth of female pacifism is

mind as examples to the contrary.</LD>

<LD>Re "U.N. Council Endorses a State for Palestinians," March 13:</LD>
<LD>   The U.N. first offered Arabs a Palestinian state more than half a
century ago. They categorically rejected that partition plan, which
included far more land than they administer now. Four wars and a
bloody terrorist conflict later, what evidence exists to give anyone
hope that they are ready to live peacefully with Israel? By attacking
Israeli troops and butchering Jewish civilians, West Bank and Gaza
Arabs only demonstrate their unfitness for statehood.</LD>
<LD>   In 2000 Ehud Barak offered 97% of the land Yasser Arafat
sought--including a slice of Jerusalem. The Arabs rejected the offer
as they did 55 years ago, launching a brutal war of attrition. By
endorsing Arafat's deadly campaign, Arab nations only prove the
insincerity of their offer to recognize Israel and guarantee its
peaceful existence. Where were the Saudis when Barak's offer was on
the table? The fox cannot guarantee the rooster's security.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Israel Invades Ramallah in Show of Might," March 13: How
telling is your choice of words for this headline! When our innocent
civilians perished in a terrorist attack on Sept. 11, the U.S.
responded militarily, sending a massive operation to Afghanistan to
root out all the terrorists and their supporters that it could find.
When Israeli civilians were being slaughtered, Israel tried
restraint, which was perceived as weakness and brought on more
attacks. Now that Israel is finally defending itself militarily, you
call it a "show of might." It's actually finally doing what is right.</TE>

to be reasonable, objective and fair.</TE>

<LD>Re "Fleeing Drought, Coyotes Roam Neighborhoods," March 12: As an
owner of a West Highland terrier that was attacked by a coyote and
survived, I am disturbed by what appears to be a quick fix to the
coyote problem. I wish I didn't have to worry about them, but
trapping and killing these animals is not the answer. The solution is
to learn to live with the coyotes.</LD>
<LD>   After my dog was attacked, I did some research and found that
there are ways to keep coyotes away from your animals. There are
simple things that can be done, such as feeding your pet indoors and
not leaving your pet outside, especially at night. If you must leave
your pet outside, provide a covered dog-run. Coyotes come with the
territory in Southern California; they are not our pets' enemy. We
must first try to learn to live with them before we declare war on
them.</LD>

<LD>Joe Solis' March 11 letter defending term limits, saying it is "just
like a liberal" to oppose them, is absurd, especially in view of the
poor performance of our California legislators on energy. The big
problem with term limits comes from the fact that those elected spend
more time lining themselves up for another office and less time with
their constituents, etc.</LD>
<LD>   Worse yet, job performance while in office is never scrutinized
carefully enough by voters, who spend an even smaller amount of time
evaluating their own legislators' credentials and wisdom about
important issues that affect us all.</LD>

<HD>Wooten Likely Out Until July</HD>

<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>Shawn Wooten wore a temporary cast on his right hand and a look of
despair on his face Thursday as Angel teammates stopped by to offer
encouragement.</LD>
<LD>   Wooten, scheduled to share the first-base job with Scott Spiezio,
said he will undergo surgery next week to repair damage suffered in
the joint of his right thumb and probably will be out until the
All-Star break.</LD>
<LD>   The injury occurred Wednesday when Wooten caught a pop fly against
the San Diego Padres. Battling the sun, he dropped to his knees on
the play and broke his fall with his right hand.</LD>
<TE>   It will be the second surgery in six months for Wooten, who batted
.312 with eight home runs and 32 runs batted in as a rookie last
year, but sat out most of the final month because of torn cartilage
in his left wrist. Dr. Norman Zemel performed surgery last September
and will operate again Tuesday in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "You get tested in life and it depends on how you respond to those
tests," Wooten said. "I didn't let it bury me last year and I'm not
going to let it happen this time either."</TE>
<TE>   Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said Benji Gil would likely get more
at-bats in Wooten's absence. Jose Nieves, Jeff DaVanon and Jamie
Burke could also figure in the equation.</TE>
<TE>   Third baseman Troy Glaus left the Angels' 9-8 loss to the Colorado
Rockies in the second inning because of a strained stomach muscle. He
suffered the injury when he leaned back trying to avoid a 3-and-2
pitch from Jason Jennings .... Outfielder Tim Salmon said his bruised
right knee appeared to be responding to treatment and that he would
be ready to return to the field today.... Designated hitter Brad
Fullmer, acquired from the Toronto Blue Jays in an off-season trade
for pitcher Brian Cooper, hit his first home run in the ninth inning
against Chris Holt.... Bob Watson, baseball's dean of discipline, had
a scheduled meeting with Angel players and coaches to discuss issues
related to speeding up the game, but he did not interview players
involved in last Saturday's brawls with the Padres.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New Boston Red Sox Manager Grady Little replaced pitching coach Ralph
Treuel with longtime friend and former New York Yankee bullpen coach
Tony Cloninger on Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Cloninger spent 15 years in the Yankee organization and was
bullpen coach nine of the past 10 years.</LD>
<LD>   He was New York's pitching coach in 1993. He was a scout for the
San Francisco Giants this season.</LD>
<TE>   "I've often said that it's not how much you know, it's how much
you care. I really care for my players, my pitchers, my coaches,"
Cloninger said.</TE>
<TE>   Little said no other coaching staff changes are planned.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dave Parker has rejoined the Pittsburgh Pirates as a special
instructor. He will spend a week in the Pirates' spring training
camp, working for Manager Lloyd McClendon and instructing players....
Bob Watson, baseball's new vice president for field operations, has
told teams that he will be emphasizing a rule that limits the type of
body armor that can be worn at bat. "It's the same rule as last
year," Watson said. "We will make sure that the rules are complied
with." ... Montreal shortstop Orlando Cabrera has a herniated disk in
his back and will need at least a week of rest.... The Texas Rangers
assigned six players to their minor league camp, including third
baseman Mark Teixeira, the team's No. 1 pick last June.</TE>

<HD>Walton's Passes Are Pure Magic for Arizona</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mal Florence</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Arizona's Luke Walton is a 6-foot-8 forward who has the skills of a
play-making guard, much like Magic Johnson in his prime.</LD>
<LD>   "I can't think of anyone who is in Luke's class as a passer, and
that includes our guards," Arizona Coach Lute Olson told Lee Shappell
of the Arizona Republic.</LD>
<LD>   Walton led the Pacific 10 Conference in assists with a 6.32
average. He is the first nonguard to lead the league since it began
keeping official assist totals in 1974-75.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More on Luke: His father, Bill Walton, the former UCLA center,
commenting on his son: "My dad and Coach [John] Wooden were my
greatest teachers, and I've tried to be Luke's, to educate him to
make good decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a joy to see the results.... Now if he'd just get rid of
that tattoo and find a uniform that fits."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Which school holds the NCAA men's tournament record
for points scored in a game?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   High praise indeed: Alex Rodriguez of the Texas Rangers commenting
on Jason Giambi, the former Oakland Athletic who is with the Yankees:
"I think [he] will be the next Babe Ruth of New York. He's the best
left-handed hitter I've ever played against, period."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No Mike, no gate: Ron Rapoport in the Chicago Sun-Times: "How is
Michael Jordan's injury affecting the buzz around the MCI Center in
Washington?</TE>
<TE>   "Well, attendance is down, concession sales are off, restaurant
traffic in the immediate area has fallen off, celebrities are hanging
out elsewhere and scalpers are selling tickets at below face value,
the Washington Post says."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Enterprising: Ruben Rivera's alleged theft of Derek Jeter's glove
and bat reminded the Associated Press' Jim Litke of a line by
catcher-turned-broadcaster Bob Uecker: "My best year as a ballplayer
was 1965, when I made $21,000--and $17,000 of that came selling other
players' equipment."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Rivera: David Letterman on Rivera: "He's stealing stuff out
of Derek Jeter's locker, and then he's selling it on eBay.... You
know what this means? They might have to call up Winona Ryder from
Columbus."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1961, USC defeated Oregon, 81-79, in
a first-round NCAA West Regional game at Portland. Two days later,
the Trojans were eliminated by Arizona State, 86-71.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Already in place: Comedy writer Argus Hamilton in the San
Francisco Chronicle: "The Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee
chairman said that L.A. will have to build two shooting ranges if the
city wants to host the Games again.</TE>
<TE>   "That's ridiculous. What's wrong with the freeways we have?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Loyola Marymount, 149, against Michigan, which
scored 115, in a West Regional second-round game in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Rick Morrissey of the Chicago Tribune, commenting
before the start of the NCAA men's basketball tournament: "I don't
like Winthrop's chances in the first round and not just because Duke
has 10 McDonald's high school All-Americans and the Eagles have three
Burger King cooks on their roster.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like Winthrop's chances because Winthrop won't shoot well
in the tournament. Not with a sports information director named Jack
Frost. True."</TE>

<HD>Transfer Proposal Gains Momentum</HD>
<DH>High schools: Southern Section officials will vote on rule
that would make athletes who change schools sit out one year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Southern Section council Thursday decided it will vote on a
proposal that would prohibit students exercising open-enrollment
transfers from participating for one year at the varsity level in the
sports they have previously played.</LD>
<LD>   "Open enrollment is now being used for transfers for athletics
only," said Downey High Principal Allen Layne, referring to the state
law that allows parents flexibility in choosing the school their
children attend. "I'd like to go back to quieter times [when there
were less transfers] and not have to worry about transfer rules."</LD>
<LD>   Layne, who presented the proposal to the council, said the surge
in athletic transfers is "out of control" and necessitates decisive
action. Nearly 3,800 students transferred in the 522-school section
from the fall of 1999 through December of last year. That figure
doesn't include students who transferred because of a change in
residence.</LD>
<TE>   If adopted at the April 25 council meeting, the proposal would
complement a statewide proposal requiring the use of a pre-enrollment
contact form that aims to curb the recruitment of athletes. The
latter proposal would require school officials to certify that no one
connected with their booster clubs or athletic departments had
contact with prospective transfers.</TE>
<TE>   If approved during a vote in May, the state proposal would go into
effect for the 2002-03 school year on a two-year trial basis. The
section proposal, if approved, would not go into effect until the
following school year.</TE>
<TE>   "I see [the section proposal] as a big step forward," said Jim
Staunton, Southern Section commissioner. "I think it aligns with what
we believe we are here to do, and that is support academics."</TE>
<TE>   West Hills Chaminade High Principal Gary Murphy told the council
about a similar policy already in place in the Mission League that
forces students transferring to another school within the league to
sit out varsity competition for one year.</TE>
<TE>   "It works," said Murphy, who is also in favor of the section
proposal. "There's a lot of resistance to begin with. The long-range
results are positive.</TE>
<TE>   "We have kids playing on our teams today that quite frankly
wouldn't be playing if we had accepted a couple of transfers that
wanted to come to our school."</TE>
<TE>   Noting that the Los Angeles City Section and the Catholic Athletic
Assn. are considering similar proposals, Murphy said the push for
tighter transfer restrictions is gaining momentum.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there is a good chance that some form of [the section
proposal] will pass," he said. "I heard a lot of good questions here
today, but I didn't hear anybody saying that this isn't a good idea."</TE>
<TE>   In other action, the council approved proposals that will:</TE>
<TE>   * Increase the number of divisions in girls' water polo from five
to six to give the 207 girls' teams an equal number of championships
as the 209 boys' teams.</TE>
<TE>   * Form playoff groupings based on competitive equity in sports not
under the guidelines of enrollment-based divisions for state
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Staunton also addressed incidents involving athlete protocol at
section championships.</TE>
<TE>   Three players from the Irvine Woodbridge boys' soccer team
allegedly initiated physical contact with a referee after a late goal
was disallowed in the Warriors' 1-0 loss to Los Alamitos in the
Division II title game. School officials are expected to meet with
commissioners next week to review the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Compton Centennial's runner-up plaque was found left in the
locker room after losing to Torrance Bishop Montgomery in the
Division III-A boys' basketball championship.</TE>

<HD>Clippers Enjoying New Brand of Playoff Fever</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They were a novelty act last season, plain and simple, a feel-good
story for anyone who has ever rooted for an underdog. No one took
them that seriously, though. They were, after all, the Clippers.</LD>
<LD>   Through 65 games this season, a great deal has changed. The
Clippers' fortunes are as improved as their newly remodeled image
around town and around the country. Perceptions have changed and
continue to be changed.</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers are no longer the pitiful cousins to the mighty
Lakers, but perhaps on the verge of joining them in postseason play.
When they meet tonight in Staples Center, the Clippers will be almost
as hot as the Lakers, having won seven of 10 compared to eight of 10
for their more accomplished neighbors.</LD>
<TE>   The question is, will the ninth-place Clippers have enough
momentum to close the deal? With 17 games remaining, can they
shoulder their way among the top eight teams in the Western
Conference that will qualify for the playoffs?</TE>
<TE>   There's no doubt that they have been resilient, overcoming the
loss of three key players for extended periods because of injuries
and rallying to within a half-game of a playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers also have been quite good recently, winning a
season-best four consecutive games and seven of their last eight.
Their 34-31 record is their best this late in a season in a decade.
They eclipsed last season's total of 31 victories in their 63rd game.</TE>
<TE>   Southland fans have responded. Wednesday's game against the
Washington Wizards marked the seventh consecutive sellout at Staples
Center, extending the franchise record. It also was the team's 16th
sellout this season, another record.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the reason why I wanted to be a part of this
organization," said power forward Elton Brand, who leads the team in
points, rebounds and eternal optimism in his first season after a
trade last summer from the Chicago Bulls.</TE>
<TE>   "I honestly would be disappointed if we didn't make the playoffs,
but it's not a lost season. It's still a good season for us and for
the organization. Still, the ultimate goal is to make the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   Brand has been central to all the Clippers have accomplished this
season and all they hope to accomplish. He averages 18.4 points and
11.8 rebounds and has sat out only two games because of injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Without Brand's relentless play around the basket, the Clippers
would be lost at this point. With small forwards Lamar Odom and Corey
Maggette and guard Keyon Dooling sidelined by injuries, the Clippers
would have been excused for collapsing in a heap in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   That it didn't happen is testimony to Brand's ability to step into
the leadership role Odom previously held. In Odom's absence, this has
become Brand's team. He has scored 10 or more points and taken 10 or
more rebounds in 45 games this season, including 10 in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Others have had their moments, but Brand, who turned 23 this week,
has been as steady as the traffic on the Harbor Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been consistently inconsistent," Coach Alvin Gentry said.
"We've always had one guy carry us, but it's not always been the same
guy every game. And that's a good thing as far as I'm concerned.
Elton has always been the one guy who was there for us. We can always
count on him to score 15 to 20 points and to get 10 to 15 rebounds. I
would like to get that sort of production every night from all the
guys, but I also think that's totally unrealistic."</TE>
<TE>   In Gentry's mind, the Clippers are a work in progress.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still striving for consistency," he said. "We're a young
team. As long as we continue to work, we have a chance to get there."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps because of the injuries to Odom, Maggette and Dooling, the
Clippers have been forced to work twice as hard to remain in the
playoff hunt. To their credit, they haven't made any excuses, but
have come together to play their best basketball under difficult
circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   "The more success you have, the more confident you are going to
be," Gentry said. "We're still trying to play our way into the
playoffs. We're not there yet. We've got to play our way there. It
still has to be the focus of our team."</TE>
<TE>   If recent games are an indication, Gentry's message has gotten
through to the Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   They all appear to have picked up their games in the last few
weeks, but center Michael Olowokandi and point guard Jeff McInnis
stand out among a crowd of improving players.</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi has developed a deft touch around the basket, becoming
an offensive threat with a variety of jump shots and hooks. He is no
longer the predictable player he once was, but now has several
determined moves near the hoop. He averages 9.5 points and 8.7
rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   McInnis directs the team like a drill sergeant, which hasn't
always been to the Clippers' benefit. But there are signs recently
that he has softened a bit. He's smiling more with his teammates,
offering a hand to be slapped more frequently. With Odom and Maggette
out, he's emerged as the Clippers' second-leading scorer, averaging
14.6 points and 6.1 assists.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, reserves Darius Miles and Quentin Richardson have
become more consistent, giving Gentry solid minutes on the road as
well as at home. Miles' acrobatic dunks ignite the team and its fans,
but he also is playing sound defense.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson has become a go-to guy inside and outside, averaging
13.8 points. He's perhaps the leading candidate for NBA sixth man of
the year honors.</TE>
<TE>   How it all ends is anyone's guess. Gentry believes the bottom line
is that the team has improved and is heading in the right direction.
Advancing to the playoffs is a reachable goal, but it's not the only
one.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is to be playing our best basketball in March and
April," he said. "If the other teams ahead of us keep winning and we
keep winning and we don't make the playoffs, so be it."</TE>

<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>If Odalis Perez opens the season with the Dodgers--and there is every
indication the left-hander will do so--it probably will be as a
starter, not a reliever, Manager Jim Tracy said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Perez threw four shutout innings in Thursday's 4-1 exhibition loss
to St. Louis, giving up two hits, striking out two and walking none,
an outing Tracy said was "as good as any pitching performance we've
seen all spring." Perez has given up three earned runs and 11 hits in
13 innings.</LD>
<LD>   Perez, right-hander Eric Gagne, who hasn't given up an earned run
in 12 innings, and left-hander Omar Daal are battling for the fifth
rotation spot. Perez, acquired from Atlanta in the Gary Sheffield
trade, struggled as a reliever last season, giving up eight earned
runs in 82/3 innings for an 8.31 earned-run average, compared to a
4.57 ERA in 16 starts.</LD>
<TE>   Tracy also said he's giving more consideration to the possibility
of using Gagne, who has a 95-mph fastball, as a short reliever--and
maybe a closer--if he doesn't win a rotation spot. Gagne's only
experience as a closer was with the Canadian national team, but he
would welcome the opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Andy Ashby continued to struggle in his return from elbow surgery,
giving up a two-out, two-run homer on his first pitch to Albert
Pujols in the first inning and a solo home run on an 0-2 pitch to
Mike DiFelice in the second. The right-hander retired the side in
order in the third but took a Tony Mota comebacker to the back of his
right calf in the process.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to be too fine, instead of just being aggressive when
I'm ahead in the count," Ashby said. "I feel good, my tempo was
better, and so was my curve. But the main thing is location. I have
to be able to put the ball where I want to."</TE>
<TE>   Ashby's fastball topped out at 88 mph, about three under its usual
peak.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel I have my velocity back, but they say that's the
last thing to come," Ashby said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Brown, who experienced elbow stiffness after Sunday's start,
will start against Florida tonight.... Brian Jordan made his first
exhibition start in center field and shortstop Cesar Izturis made his
second start in the leadoff spot, moves Tracy said he will make
again.... Center-field candidate Dave Roberts will be sidelined for a
few days because of a strained right thigh muscle.... Donald Fehr,
executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Assn., met
with the Dodgers Thursday morning. He said that, despite reports, the
union has no plans to boycott the All-Star game in Milwaukee in July.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Among the issues Mighty Duck management needs to deal with during the
off-season is the team's power play.</LD>
<LD>   The Ducks rank last in the NHL on the power play at 12.1%. They
have been blanked on the power play in 12 one-goal losses and three
ties.</LD>
<LD>   "We have to do something that will trigger our power play more
than anything," Coach Bryan Murray said. "Is that a goal scorer? A
point man? There is no question that we need to get one of our guys
to step up here and take charge of the power play. Or we have to do
something in that area to make a big difference next year."</LD>
<TE>   What Murray seeks is someone to give the power play some oomph.
That probably means an off-season move, preferably for a scorer who
can play on the first line. But, for now, the Ducks will look inward.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Kariya, who has 10 of the Ducks' 38 power-play goals, will
get another crack at that role during the last 15 games. Kariya was
an effective point man in 1998-99.</TE>

<LD>Take Charge Lady has developed into one of the better 3-year-old
fillies, having swept a pair of stakes in Louisiana, and will be one
of the top contenders for the Kentucky Oaks on May 3 at Churchill
Downs.</LD>
<LD>   Today at Gulfstream Park, Belterra, last seen beating Take Charge
Lady in the Golden Rod at Churchill on Nov. 24, will make her 2002
debut in the $250,000 Bonnie Miss Stakes.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Robert Manfuso and trained by Carl Nafzger, Belterra, a
daughter of Unbridled, who won the Kentucky Derby for Nafzger in
1990, is perfect in three starts.</LD>
<TE>   Before her win in the Golden Rod, which, like the Bonnie Miss, is
a Grade II, she had broken her maiden at Keeneland, then rolled to a
10-allowance win when stretched out to a mile.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Court, who rode her in all three of her races as a 2-year-old,
will be aboard Belterra when she breaks from the outside in the field
of six.</TE>
<TE>   The Bonnie Miss, run at 11/8 miles, attracted another unbeaten
filly.</TE>
<TE>   Nonsuch Bay, who will leave from the rail, is two for two for
trainer Frank Alexander at Gulfstream. She will be ridden by John
Velasquez.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the lineup for the race are Miu Miu, Dust Me Off, Ms
Brookski and Stormy Frolic.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, at Aqueduct, Snake Mountain will make his second
American start for trainer James Jerkens.</TE>
<TE>   A gelded son of A.P. Indy purchased for $950,000 as a yearling, he
broke his maiden by a dozen lengths in his first start on the dirt
after four turf failures in Ireland.</TE>
<TE>   He will be favored against only five rivals in the 11/8-mile
allowance contest.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Megahertz, impressive in her U.S. debut in the
Blue Norther more than two months ago, is the 8-5 favorite in the
$75,000 Some Sensation at one mile on the turf today at Santa Anita.
She and 6-1 shot Nunatall are trained by Bobby Frankel.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot:  Victor Espinoza. The jockey had three winners
Wednesday at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not:  David Donk. The trainer, based at Gulfstream Park now,
is only one for 31 this year.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four using Skywriting and Red Hot And
Blue in the fifth, Drawn Sword and Sheikh Fever in the sixth, using
Megahertz, Bella Bella Bella and the Ayzal-Orlass entry in the
seventh and using Sam's Dusty and Pickled Bay in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous Day/Meet Total: 3/160. Money: Previous Day/Meet
Total: $13.40/$940.20. Total money bet: $976.</TE>

<LD>The Kings don't have a reputation as one of the NHL's top defensive
teams, but maybe they should.</LD>
<LD>   Before Thursday night's game against St. Louis, they had
surrendered 153 goals. Only four teams in the league--Colorado, St.
Louis, Detroit and Philadelphia--had given up fewer.</LD>
<LD>   "We've had most of our success this year when we've played a solid
defensive game," King left wing Craig Johnson said. "So, when you
look at our team, you would have to look at defense as the No. 1
priority for us. You know the old saying, 'Defense creates offense,'
that is true with us."</LD>
<TE>   King Coach Andy Murray credits his team's defensive surge to the
improvement of goaltenders Felix Potvin and Jamie Storr.</TE>
<TE>   Potvin, who has started 37 of the Kings' last 43 games, has a .918
save percentage, and Storr would have the second best goals-against
average in the league if he started more games.</TE>
<TE>   That's one reason why the Kings are confident for the stretch run.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a successful run in our last 17 games last year and we're
looking to do the same this season," Johnson said. "We're in [fifth]
place [in the Western Conference] right now, but with a couple of
losses, we'd be right out of the playoff picture.</TE>
<TE>   "Each and every game is so important now. It's going to keep
getting more and more important right to the end of the season."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ian Laperriere's wife, Magali, and Storr's wife, Niki, are due to
give birth any day.</TE>

<HD>Kings Clamp Down</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Penalty-killing unit keys 2-1 victory over Blues
that moves L.A. into fifth place in Western Conference.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With 10:47 remaining in the third period and the Kings holding a
one-goal lead, the St. Louis Blues found themselves on a power-play
in a crucial game for both teams Thursday night at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   That's when the NHL's best penalty-killing unit took over. For two
minutes, the Blues were held without a shot on goal and the Kings
rode the momentum created by their penalty-killers to close out a 2-1
victory in front of a capacity crowd of 18,118.</LD>
<LD>   Winger Brad Chartrand had a goal and an assist, and defenseman
Lubomir Visnovsky scored the winning goal for the Kings, who moved
into sole possession of fifth place in the Western Conference.</LD>
<TE>   "It's playoff hockey in March right now," Chartrand said. "The
tempo of the games has picked up and it's not a surprise to see
low-scoring games now. Teams are clamping down and that's what
happens when you need the points. You can't play a run-and-gun style
if you want to win in this league. You have to concentrate on defense
first."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings and St. Louis headed into Thursday's showdown tied with
Phoenix with 75 points each. Since Phoenix had the night off, the
Kings took full advantage of their opportunity to gain some ground in
the tight Western Conference playoff race.</TE>
<TE>   Felix Potvin was impressive again in goal for the Kings, making 28
saves to improve to 24-22-6.</TE>
<TE>   The Blues, who ended a slump with their first win since the
Olympic break at San Jose on Wednesday, definitely did not start off
against the Kings playing like a struggling team.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis aggressively shut down the Kings' offense in the first
period with solid forechecking and seemed to have more jump in its
legs despite having played on the road the night before.</TE>
<TE>   Potvin, who has played in 93 of the 103 games since being acquired
by the Kings on Feb. 15, 2001, had to be sharp early. St. Louis not
only outshot the Kings, 13-8, over the first 20 minutes, but the
Blues also had the better scoring chances. Potvin was at his best
when he stuffed a shot by Tyson Nash from the top of the crease and
when he batted away a shot by forward Cory Stillman from the left
circle.</TE>
<TE>   After looking lethargic in the first period, the Kings struck
quickly in the second.</TE>
<TE>   Chartrand, whose last goal before Thursday came against Columbus
on Feb. 26, is not known as one of the Kings' top offensive threats,
but he certainly seemed like one to St. Louis defenseman Al MacInnis
when he gave the Kings a 1-0 lead 34 seconds into the period.</TE>
<TE>   After picking up a St. Louis turnover in the neutral zone,
Chartrand skated by the right circle, faked MacInnis to the ice and
ripped a shot past Brent Johnson for his sixth goal of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "I was thinking pass at first because Mikko [Eloranta] had a jump
on MacInnis," Chartrand said. "But in the middle of my thought
process, MacInnis just flopped down.''</TE>
<TE>   With a one-goal lead, the Kings came close to stretching it to 2-0
a couple of times but failed, and St. Louis took advantage with
Stillman's 17th goal at 11:33. After making a nice stop on a shot by
Pavol Demitra, Potvin had Stillman's shot from a sharp angle outside
the right post, bounce off his chest into the net to tie the score,
1-1.</TE>
<TE>   Before the period ended, the Kings regained the lead on
Visnovsky's fourth goal of the season. Forward Ian Laperriere set up
the score when he faked St. Louis defenders out of position before
finding Visnovsky inside the blue line. Visnovsky skated toward the
middle of the ice and beat Johnson high to his glove side at 16:38 to
help the Kings take a 2-1 lead into the second intermission.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a poor first period, but we came out gave them a lot more
trouble in the second," said King center Jason Allison, whose
point-scoring streak ended after four games. "We played a lot better
from then on."</TE>
<TE>   In the third period, the Kings didn't exactly shut down on offense
but they did cut down on risky plays.</TE>
<TE>   Except for a couple of late shots by the Blues, the Kings
controlled the game down the stretch to win their second in a row.
They conclude their three-game homestand on Saturday against the
Pittsburgh Penguins.</TE>

<HD>Walker Hopes for Return to Court Tonight</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Samaki Walker has convinced his coach.</LD>
<LD>   Now if he can only do the same with the medical staff.</LD>
<LD>   Walker, who missed the last 12 games because of a hyperextended
elbow, is hoping to play tonight against the Clippers.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm pushing for it," Laker Coach Phil Jackson said of his power
forward, "but I don't know if the medical community will go along. I
think he is capable of putting himself in a position where he will
not be in jeopardy."</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Gary Vitti predicted a decision on Walker for tonight
"will go right down to the wire."</TE>
<TE>   If Walker doesn't make it back on the floor tonight, it seems
likely he will do so Sunday night against the Dallas Mavericks at
Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Horry, who became a starter when Walker got hurt, has
averaged 11 points, 8.7 rebounds, 3.6 assists and 2.07 steals in that
role.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers signed guard Doug Overton to a second 10-day contract
and are expected to sign forward Tremaine Fowlkes today for the rest
of the season. Fowlkes' second 10-day contract ran out Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The two have become valuable members of the team, which has won
seven of eight games despite having forwards Corey Maggette and Lamar
Odom and guard Keyon Dooling sidelined by injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Overton has averaged 3.4 points as a backup to point guard Jeff
McInnis. Fowlkes has become the starting small forward, averaging 5.2
points.</TE>
<TE>   "He has played with passion and energy when he's been out there,"
Coach Alvin Gentry said of Overton. "He's shown he's got three-point
range. He's also a good defender. He does a good job of running the
club when he's been out there."</TE>
<TE>   Of Fowlkes, Gentry said, "Obviously, he's played well for us. Be
it directly related to him or not, we've been 6-1 with him in our
lineup."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the injuries, or perhaps because of them, Gentry said he's
been pleased by the togetherness the Clippers have displayed during
their hot streak.</TE>
<TE>   He believes Overton and Fowlkes have had a hand in the team's
strong play.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a little bit amazed, a little bit surprised we've been able
to be as cohesive as we have been," Gentry said. "But I'm not
surprised we're winning. We believe in these guys. We think we'll
have a chance to win if we go out and execute."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There was no update Thursday on Odom, whose sprained right wrist
was expected to be examined by a specialist this week. If his wrist
does not show significant improvement, it's possible Odom would need
season-ending surgery. He has been on the injured list since Jan. 24.</TE>

<HD>Shaq's Attack Stays at the Rim</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: He responds to flagrant foul by Warriors'
Fortson by leading Lakers to 110-102 win.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>It seemed to make about as much sense as stealing a bear's honey,
pulling a pit bull's tail or stomping on Mike Tyson's foot.</LD>
<LD>   But when your team has won only 17 games and another victory is
slipping away to the Lakers, what do you have to lose?</LD>
<LD>   So Golden State Warrior Danny Fortson did the unthinkable Thursday
night at The Arena in Oakland. He attacked Shaquille O'Neal.</LD>
<TE>   Got him in a head lock.</TE>
<TE>   Threw him to the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Challenged him to a fight.</TE>
<TE>   The good news for the 6-foot-8, 260-pound Fortson is that he's
still alive today to talk about it.</TE>
<TE>   And the good news for the Lakers is that the 7-1, 335-pound plus
O'Neal took out his anger with a ball to the hoop rather than a fist
to the head. After Fortson's flagrant foul, O'Neal scored seven of
the Lakers' next nine points and 40 in all to lead his team to a
110-102 victory, improving the Lakers to 45-18 and moving them within
half a game of the Sacramento Kings, who lost to the New York Knicks
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers seemed vulnerable when Robert Horry fouled out with
5:43 to play and the Lakers clinging to an 89-86 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Then Fortson went after O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   When the Laker center got up, he said to Fortson, "Do you want to
go?"</TE>
<TE>   Laker teammates Kobe Bryant and Rick Fox quickly interceded.
O'Neal went to the free-throw line and made one of two.</TE>
<TE>   Like a pitcher retaliating for a teammate who has been plunked
with a pitch, Fox wrestled Fortson to the floor at the other end,
getting his own flagrant foul.</TE>
<TE>   And O'Neal kept expressing himself in the points column as the
Warriors kept hacking him. He made four free throws, a thunderous
dunk and fouled out Fortson.</TE>
<TE>   And finished off Golden State.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal wound up making 13 of 20 shots and 14 of 28 from the
free-throw line. He also had a game-high 13 rebound. Bryant added 21
points.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't waste my time with the average high-school players," said
O'Neal of Fortson after the game. "He is too small for me and
everyone knows that. Legends don't retaliate to average high school
players, and he is an average high school player."</TE>
<TE>   Responded Fortson: "He kept telling me he was a legend, so I told
him that I wanted to be famous. I want to get noticed just like he
is. That's basically how we got into it, but it was out on the court.
Nothing personal. The referee saved [him], probably from
embarrassment.... I can play the Lakers again every night."</TE>
<TE>   For the Warriors, Antawn Jamison and Jason Richardson tied for the
team high with 23 points apiece. Jamison also had 12 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   It can't be easy being the Warriors.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday night, they had to contend with NCAA regional games
just down the road in Sacramento. There was barely a mention of the
Laker-Warrior game in local sports sections Thursday, surprising
since the Lakers seem to bring their own spotlight with them wherever
they go.</TE>
<TE>   It's not as if the Warriors are completely devoid of hope. With
the scoring punch of Jamison, the skill level of Richardson and the
board strength of Fortson, Golden State has potential.</TE>
<TE>   But people around here are tired of hearing about Warrior
potential. They've been hearing about that since Rick Barry was
running up and down the court.</TE>
<TE>   Potential met reality Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   After toying with the Warriors early and leading Golden State by
only three after one quarter, 25-22, the Lakers, led by its
dominating duo of O'Neal and Bryant, surged into a 12-point advantage
in the second period and finished the half with a seemingly
comfortable lead at 50-41.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal had a game-high 17 points for the first 24 minutes,
followed closely by Bryant's 13.</TE>
<TE>   When the Lakers came out for the start of the second half, it
appeared they had left their passion in the locker room. Golden State
went on an 8-2 run to pull within three.</TE>
<TE>   And late in the period, they finally pulled ahead when Bob Sura
made two free throws, after O'Neal had missed a pair at the other
end, to move Golden State ahead, 71-70.</TE>
<TE>   The in-bounds pass, from Mark Madsen to Bryant, was knocked loose
by Richardson, who fed Sura. Fouled, Sura was successful on both
attempts, giving Golden State a three-point advantage, its biggest of
the night.</TE>

<HD>A Road Racing Revival at California Speedway</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sports car road racing, the centerpiece of motor racing in Southern
California for three decades before Riverside International Raceway
closed in 1988, will be revived next week on California Speedway's
new 2.8-mile, 21-turn road course.</LD>
<LD>   The Rolex Sports Car Series, featuring the exotic prototypes that
run in the Daytona 24 Hour and Sebring 12 Hour, will be featured in a
400-mile race on Saturday, March 23. A Grand-Am Cup Street Stock race
of 250 miles will wake up fans at 8 a.m. Sunday as a preliminary to
the Indy Racing League's Yamaha Indy 400.</LD>
<LD>   "This will be a big event for California Speedway and for racing
fans, who will get to see road racing and oval racing on the same
weekend," said Bill Miller, speedway president. "The new road course
hearkens back to the days of Riverside and racing heroes like Roger
Penske, Dan Gurney and Parnelli Jones who competed there."</LD>
<TE>   During the 1990s, sports car racing all but dropped from sight as
the International Motor Sports Assn. shut down, the Sports Car Club
of America lost interest, and road racing became dysfunctional. In
the last several years, two new sanctioning bodies have emerged, both
dedicated to restoring the luster to the once-popular form of racing.
Both have 10-race schedules this year.</TE>
<TE>   Jim France, whose family owns NASCAR and Daytona International
Speedway, chose Roger Edmondson to form a new organization, the Grand
American Road Racing Assn. Its first race was the 2000 Rolex 24 at
Daytona.</TE>
<TE>   A year earlier, Don Panoz had taken over what was left of the SCCA
program and formed the American LeMans series, using the same rules
as the LeMans 24 Hour race in France. Panoz's group will be racing
this week in the 12 Hours of Sebring, the first round of his season.</TE>
<TE>   Didier Theys and Mauro Baldo, winners of both the Rolex 24 at
Daytona and last week's Homestead Grand-Am race in Florida in a
Dallara-Judd, will be at Sebring on Saturday, then will head to
Fontana for next week's Grand-Am.</TE>
<TE>   Drivers can compete in both 10-race series if they like, although
the rules are slightly different.</TE>
<TE>   "This country has seen a variety of organizations and private
entities at the helm of automobile road racing," said Edmondson. "The
result has been that the sport has lagged behind other motorsports
series in developing a sustained fan base and sponsorship support.</TE>
<TE>   "It is our mission to provide the stability the sport so dearly
needs and we will do that by controlling our spending and growth."</TE>
<TE>   There will be five classes in the 400-mile feature race:</TE>
<TE>   Sportsracing prototype--The premier class features two-seat
prototype cars designed for speed and exotic fan appeal, such as
Ferrari, Lola, Riley &amp; Scott, Kudzu and Reynard, powered by Ford,
Chevrolet, Judd, Ferrari, Porsche, Mazda and BMW engines.</TE>
<TE>   Sportsracing prototype II--A class for smaller, non-turbocharged
cars, most powered by Nissan, BMW and Mazda engines. Terry Borcheller
and Anthony Lazzaro won both earlier races in a Nissan-powered Lola.
Lazzaro will also drive in the IRL race on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be two quite different experiences," Lazzaro said. "The
IRL race will be much more mentally tiring, while the road race will
be more physically demanding. I'm looking forward to both of them.
Seat time is most important in racing and I'll get plenty of it next
week."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Grand Touring Super--The larger GTS class features V-8 Corvettes
and Saleen S7Rs and V-10 Vipers battling against turbo Porsches,
Marcos Manteras and others.</TE>
<TE>   American Grand Touring--American muscle cars--Corvettes, Camaros
and Mustangs--powered by American V-8 engines up to 375 cubic inches.</TE>
<TE>   Grand Touring--These machines are based on factory-built cars such
as BMW M3s, Ferraris, Corvettes, Mazda RX-7s, Mosler MT900s and a
variety of Porsches. Drivers include local favorites such as the Bill
Auberlen-Cort Wagner entry in a Ferrari.</TE>
<TE>   The Grand-Am Cup is for production cars straight off the showroom
floor with minimal modifications for safety. Among the drivers of the
51 entries are Gary Hutto and James Sofronas of Newport Beach in a
BMW, Bob Endicott of San Pedro in an Acura Integra and R. Marty
Miller of Riverside in a Porsche 911.</TE>
<TE>   Irwindale Opening Night</TE>
<TE>   NASCAR's Weekly Racing Series will kick off the fourth season of
racing Saturday night at Irwindale Speedway's popular half-mile paved
oval.</TE>
<TE>   Super late models, the series' top of the line, headline a show
that will include super stocks, race trucks and Grand American
modifieds.</TE>
<TE>   Sean Woodside, 2001 super stock champion from Saugus, will not
defend his title, having moved up to Winston West and Southwest Tour
events, but he will be at Saturday night's opener to showcase last
year's winning car.</TE>
<TE>   Ready to take over in the super stock class will be last year's
challengers, led by Nathan Wolf of Escondido, who missed the
championship by only 58 points and was rookie of the year. Also in
the hunt will be veteran Tommy Fry of Simi Valley, second-generation
favorite David Gilliland of Chino Hills and Brent Reynolds of
Escondido.</TE>
<TE>   Fans who cheer for car models more than drivers can choose from
Chevy Monte Carlos, Ford Tauruses, Pontiac Grand Ams and Dodge
Intrepids, all powered by V-8 engines.</TE>
<TE>   The 100-lap main event is the first in an 18-race series.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Recalling Big George</TE>
<TE>   Tony Jones took a ceremonial victory lap for driver "Big George"
Gervais last Saturday night at Perris Auto Speedway, then won the
main event and dedicated his win to Gervais with a more traditional
victory lap.</TE>
<TE>   Gervais, a Sprint Car Racing Assn. veteran, died last Friday of
injuries suffered in a racing accident last July. It was the first
fatality in the SCRA's nine-year history.</TE>
<TE>   The victory put Jones in the SCRA series lead for the first time
in his career. He has 178 points to 176 for three-time champion
Richard Griffin and 175 for Troy Rutherford. Jones began the season
with a new team owned by Johnny Vermeer and Bubby Jones, Tony's
sprint car Hall of Fame father.</TE>
<TE>   Jones will be defending champion Saturday night in the Gary Sokola
Classic at Manzanita Speedway in Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Perris will feature a variety show Saturday night, including super
stocks, winged lightning sprint cars, street stocks and champ trucks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fast Laps</TE>
<TE>   Drag racing's winningest driver, John Force, will take another
shot at scoring his 100th funny car victory Sunday in the NHRA
Gatornationals at Gainesville, Fla. Two of racing's legends, Don
Garlits and Shirley Muldowney, will compete in top fuel. Although
Connie Kalitta won't be driving, the top-fuel dragster driven by his
nephew, Doug Kalitta, will carry the paint scheme of Connie's
legendary 1971 Bounty Hunter.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Leffler will attempt a cross-country double this week,
driving a Dodge in Friday's Craftsman Truck race at Darlington, S.C.,
and a Silver Crown car on Sunday at Phoenix International Raceway as
part of the Copper World Classic. The IRL's Bombardier 200 will
follow the Silver Crown race.... In preparation for the Indianapolis
500, an IRL race, CART driver Jimmy Vasser will compete in the IRL
race at California Speedway next weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The 11th annual California Racer's Reunion, sponsored by Hila
Sweet and Bob Hogle, will be April 7 at the Victorville Fairgrounds.
Parnelli Jones, Rodger Ward and Carroll Shelby are among those
expected to attend.... NASCAR's Jeff Gordon has been selected as a
Sports Ethics Fellow as part of National Sportsmanship Day for his
"ethics, sportsmanship and fair play."</TE>
<TE>   Roger Penske, Andy Granatelli and the late Sid Collins, for many
years "the voice of the 500," have been voted into the Auto Racing
Hall of Fame at Indianapolis.... Bill Marvel, longtime U.S. Auto Club
executive, was elected president of the National Midget Auto Racing
Hall of Fame.</TE>

<HD>Webber Watches Sprewell, Knicks Cruise Past Kings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Latrell Sprewell didn't need any words of encouragement, but
Sacramento King forward Chris Webber couldn't resist.</LD>
<LD>   Sprewell had 43 points and six assists Thursday night at New York
and the Knicks defeated Sacramento, 113-96, as the Kings played
without Webber, who sat out because of a dislocated finger.</LD>
<LD>   "I told him to slow down at halftime, and I guess it just pumped
him up," Webber said with a smile.</LD>
<TE>   Sprewell had 24 points in the first half, and his shooting in the
fourth quarter held off the Kings' late run. Kurt Thomas had 25
points and 11 rebounds and Allan Houston scored 16 points.</TE>
<TE>   "I had the hot hand, and every time I got a good look I was going
to get a shot off," Sprewell said. "I was looking for the ball all
night."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Bibby scored 21 points for the Kings, who own the NBA's best
record but struggled without Webber. Sacramento shot 41% from the
field, committed 15 turnovers and missed several uncontested shots
down the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Sprewell scored 12 points in the fourth, including a hanging layup
that stopped the Kings' 10-2 run and gave the Knicks a 97-85 lead
with 4:56 left.</TE>
<TE>   Then Hedo Turkoglu missed two layups and Bibby missed an open
three-point attempt as Sacramento never threatened again. The Kings
had their three-game road winning streak halted.</TE>
<TE>   "[Sprewell] was unbelievable," New York Coach Don Chaney said.
"When we stumbled, he picked us up. To me, that's the making of a
star and a leader."</TE>
<TE>   Portland 132, Dallas 106--Rasheed Wallace scored 28 of his 37
points in the first half to lead the Trail Blazers at Portland, Ore.
In a game filled with dunks, three-point baskets and technical fouls,
the Blazers used a 12-0 run late in the second quarter to take a
27-point halftime lead in ending the Mavericks' winning streak at
five.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas Coach Don Nelson began the third quarter with only two
starters and went with all reserves for most of the period, when
Portland's lead reached 46.</TE>
<TE>   Portland is 13-2 since the All-Star break, including 5-0 against
the top five teams in the Western Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Portland's Dale Davis was ejected during the third quarter for a
hard foul on the Shawn Bradley. Portland's Shawn Kemp needed four
stitches in his head after colliding with teammate Chris Dudley. Kemp
sustained a mild concussion and did not return.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 91, Chicago 86--Tim Duncan scored 24 points, seven
coming on free throws in a frenzied fourth quarter, to help the Spurs
sneak past the Bulls at San Antonio. The Spurs got 15 of their 23
points in the final period on free throws to win their eighth
consecutive game while Chicago lost its eighth consecutive.</TE>
<TE>   Marcus Fizer had 22 points and 12 rebounds for the Bulls.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio's Steve Smith left the game in the first half with a
sprained right ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte 100, Utah 82--Jamal Mashburn scored 26 points and Baron
Davis had 18 as the Hornets won at Charlotte, N.C. Charlotte took
control with a 20-2 run that began midway through the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Karl Malone, averaging 26.4 points in 28 career games against the
Hornets, had three points in 25 minutes--his lowest output since Nov.
15, 1991.</TE>

<HD>Woods, Daly Shoot to Top of Leaderboard at Bay Hill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fans didn't have to wander around Bay Hill to find the action--Tiger
Woods working magic with his short game, John Daly right behind,
booming big drives and avoiding big numbers.</LD>
<LD>   Woods and Daly, two of the biggest attractions on the PGA Tour,
wound up in a six-way share of the lead at five-under-par 67 Thursday
in the Bay Hill Invitational at Orlando, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   Angel Cabrera, John Huston, Steve Flesch and 48-year-old D.A.
Weibring, who got into the tournament on a sponsor's exemption, also
shot 67s on a sunny, calm day. Sergio Garcia was among those at 68.</LD>
<TE>   Woods, the two-time defending champion at Bay Hill, got off to a
good start, although it was hardly a model of perfection as he hit
only nine greens in regulation.</TE>
<TE>   "But my short game bailed me out, and I made a lot of putts
today," he said after a round in which he required only 21 putts.</TE>
<TE>   Daly joined the leaders with typical thrills.</TE>
<TE>   His wedge on No. 13 found the water, but he got up-and-down for a
bogey. Three holes later, he banged out a 308-yard drive on the
par-five 16th then hit a six-iron from 207 yards that stopped 19 feet
behind the cup. Daly holed that for eagle and was tied for the lead.</TE>
<TE>   Arnold Palmer, the 72-year-old host, had an 86, beating by one his
worse score at the Bay Hill Invitational.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Amateur champion Bubba Dickerson had a 72. Seventeen-year-old
professional Ty Tryon had a 75.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Annika Sorenstam, whose 59 at Moon Valley
Country Club last year was the first by a woman in tournament play,
shot a five-under-par 67 to share the first-round lead in the Ping
Banner Health at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Shani Waugh, Jackie Gallagher-Smith, Emilee Klein and Kelly
Robbins also opened with 67s. Only 28 players broke par in windy
conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Se Ri Pak, second last year, struggled to a 74. Karrie Webb, who
lost a playoff to Sorenstam in the Australian Ladies Masters last
month, also struggled, finishing with a 77 and four-time Phoenix
champion Laura Davies shot an 81.</TE>
<TE>   Auto Racing</TE>
<TE>   Jimmy Vasser is the driver of the cars entered for the
Indianapolis 500 by former winner Bobby Rahal and talk show host
David Letterman.</TE>
<TE>   Team Rahal competes in the CART series and will run as
Rahal/Letterman Racing in the IRL's California 400 on March 24 and
Indy 500 on May 26. It will be the first time Rahal has entered a car
at Indianapolis since the CART-IRL split in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Vasser, the 1996 CART champion, has driven in six previous
Indianapolis 500s. He was seventh and fourth the past two years for
Ganassi Racing.</TE>
<TE>   The Rahal/Letterman cars raised the number of entries to 29,
including cars for former winners Arie Luyendyk and Al Unser Jr.
Michael Andretti, a CART regular, also will drive in the 500.</TE>
<TE>   The entry deadline is April 3.</TE>
<TE>   Pro Football</TE>
<TE>   Free agent Blaine Bishop, a four-time Pro Bowl safety, signed a
three-year contract with the Philadelphia Eagles.</TE>
<TE>   Free-agent Tampa Bay running back Warrick Dunn is close to
completing a contract with the Atlanta Falcons, according to his
agent.</TE>
<TE>   The Kansas City Chiefs retained restricted free-agent linebacker
Mike Maslowski by matching the offer sheet he signed with New
England.... The Seattle Seahawks signed tight end Itula Mili to a
multiyear contract.... Wide receiver Johnnie Morton, second in career
receptions for the Detroit Lions, was cut in a salary-cap move. The
Lions still hope to re-sign him.</TE>
<TE>   College Football</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska has added Arizona State to its 2002 schedule. The
Cornhuskers and Sun Devils will play in the Black Coaches Assn.
Classic on Aug. 24, giving Nebraska 13 regular-season games.</TE>

<HD>Long Claw of Law Targets Illicit Lobster Trade</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETE THOMAS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The anonymous tip came in three months ago. Surveillance began a
month later and involved 18 wardens, six from a unit that specializes
in covert sting operations. It went on almost around the clock for 60
days.</LD>
<LD>   Finally, the pinch was made and two Southland residents are in hot
water for allegedly catching more than their legal limits of lobsters
and illegally selling them from the parking lot of a Southland
hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Jon Michael Hand and Edward Gary Wolf, both of Downey, were
arrested late Tuesday night and cited for possession of over-limits,
a misdemeanor.</LD>
<TE>   Forthcoming charges are likely to include unlawful possession of
lobster and selling lobsters taken under the authority of a
sportfishing license, misdemeanors punishable by fines.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Steve Martarano, a spokesman for the Department of Fish and Game,
said the case is significant because it involves a "sport operation
commercializing a resource set aside for sportfishermen only" in a
prime lobster breeding area.</TE>
<TE>   Hand and Wolf allegedly performed most of their dives in Santa
Monica Bay, which is off limits to commercial lobster fishermen.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Norris, a DFG warden and the lead officer in the case, said
that a search of Hand's home on Tuesday turned up a chest freezer
"full to the brim" with lobster tails and packages of lobster legs.
Wardens also found an envelope with $760 cash and a check for $175.
On the envelope were the words, "Jon's lobster."</TE>
<TE>   On Hand's phone-answering machine, Norris added, was a message
from someone inquiring about the purchase of lobster.</TE>
<TE>   Seized as evidence were tanks, wetsuits, spear guns, game bags and
a computer "which has a large number of incriminating photos,
including one showing Mr. Hand standing alongside a black sea bass [a
protected species] with a spear gun in his hand," Norris said.</TE>
<TE>   Both suspects were reached by phone Thursday. Hand refused to
discuss the arrest and claimed to be guilty only of "stupidity." Wolf
said he was innocent of the over-limits charges and added, "I don't
know anything about selling them. I went diving with the guy and
that's it."</TE>
<TE>   Norris, however, said the evidence is compelling. Using
night-vision equipment, he said, wardens watched the pair throughout
several dives off Marina del Rey.</TE>
<TE>   Hand was the diver, Norris added.</TE>
<TE>   He said that on Feb. 20, he met Hand and Wolf at the launch ramp.
They had 14 lobsters and claimed that each had obtained his legal
limit. (Lobster season is open through Wednesday, with a daily bag
limit of seven per person.)</TE>
<TE>   "But only Mr. Hand was in a wetsuit and Mr. Wolf was in street
clothes and with bone-dry hair," Norris said.</TE>
<TE>   Wolf said he was dry because he would dive first, and then dry
off, change and watch the boat while Hand was diving.</TE>
<TE>   The over-limits citation was not issued until Tuesday night, after
the search of Hand's home and the subsequent arrest of both men.</TE>
<TE>   More incriminating, Norris said, is video footage of the repeated
sale of lobsters from the lot of a hospital where Hand has worked for
11 years.</TE>
<TE>   Norris said that on one occasion, wardens witnessed an exchange of
$120 for eight lobsters. He added that Wolf was present when a cooler
full of lobsters was lifted from the boat.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the lobsters are believed to have been sold to hospital
employees, Norris said, adding that the hospital administration is
cooperating with the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   How all this plays out remains to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office is still reviewing evidence and it
could be months before additional charges are brought against Hand
and Wolf.</TE>
<TE>   But two things are clear. First, the folks at the hospital are
going to have to find another pot from which to pick their fresh
lobsters. More noteworthy, the state takes very seriously laws
protecting its marine resources.</TE>
<TE>   "Making cases like this gives us something to work for," Norris
said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coming Ashore</TE>
<TE>   Grunion season has begun and the fish will be prime for the taking
tonight through Monday night, with the first wave expected ashore
sometime after 10 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   During open season--April and May have been set aside as
observation-only months--grunion hunters can take as many fish as
they want, provided they use only their bare hands and, if they're 16
or older, are in possession of a valid fishing license.</TE>
<TE>   A schedule of runs is available at www.dfg.ca.gov.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Add Grunion</TE>
<TE>   Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro is offering its annual "Meet
the Grunion" program Saturday, with a 9 p.m. film followed by a
grunion hunt on nearby Cabrillo Beach. Cost is $2 for adults, $1 for
seniors and children. Details: (310) 548-7562.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Show Stoppers</TE>
<TE>   Another Fred Hall Fishing Tackle and Boat Show has come and gone,
leaving fishermen with nothing to do but go fishing. About 250,000
attended this year's event at the Long Beach Convention Center.
Attendance was down slightly from last year, but sales were up,
promoter Bart Hall said.</TE>
<TE>   Making the biggest sales pitch, of course, were those supporting
the fight against a series of proposed marine closures within the
Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary.</TE>
<TE>   The American Sportfishing Assn. and United Anglers of Southern
California took their turn last Friday, using the show as a platform
to release a commissioned study intended to discredit a government
economic-impact analysis that, according to the study, "dramatically
underestimates" the potential loss of revenue and jobs.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Congressman Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach)
informed anglers he was on their side.</TE>
<TE>   "The ocean belongs to us, not the government," Rohrabacher said.
"We don't need a bunch of bureaucrats to control our lives."</TE>
<TE>   Rohrabacher and Congressman Colin Peterson (D-Minn.) are
co-sponsors of HR 3547, or the "Freedom to Fish Act." It specifies
"that all federal regulations promote open access for recreational
fishing to the maximum extent practicable" and that restricted areas
"be as small as are scientifically necessary to provide for the
conservation of the fishery resource."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Taking the Bait</TE>
<TE>   Missing from Laker forward Samaki Walker's bio: "Likes to bite
heads off sardines.... "</TE>
<TE>   Walker and teammate Brian Shaw spent a day last week treating a
group of inner-city kids to a day of fishing aboard Redondo
Sportfishing's Sea Spray.</TE>
<TE>   One of the kids along for the ride, the 7-year-old son of the
charter master, bit the head off a sardine as a way of challenging
Walker.</TE>
<TE>   The other kids chanted encouragement until Walker finally accepted
the challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Which probably helps explain why he demanded to be among the first
off the boat.</TE>

city are predicting chaos, as the number of dignitaries and security

<HD>Sampras Finally Says Goodbye to Mr. Chips</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL DWYRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIAN WELLS</DL>
<LD>Fabrice Santoro's double fault was still nestled in the net when the
sigh of relief whooshed through the Stadium Court at Indian Wells
Garden like a passing freight train. And that was just from
tournament director Charlie Pasarell's suite.</LD>
<LD>   What has become the Pete Sampras Invitational, known officially as
the Pacific Life Open, got a new breath of life early Thursday night
when Sampras, by far its biggest attraction, outlasted Frenchman
Santoro, a player who has made a career out of driving his opponents
nuts.</LD>
<LD>   Santoro will be 30 in December. He is a journeyman who has made
nearly $5 million in prize money, is ranked 20th in the world and has
made a career of beating people not so much with strokes or power or
strategy, but with annoyance.</LD>
<TE>   Santoro is like a sliver under your fingernail, a gnat that makes
you itch. Sampras has played him seven times and this was his fourth
victory--the three losses coming on clay, where playing Santoro would
be the ultimate tennis nightmare. That's why, even when Sampras, the
classic power player with a textbook serve-and-volley game, won the
first set, 6-3, there was no real expectation of a quick blowout.</TE>
<TE>   Some 2 hours 2 minutes later, Sampras watched in amazement as
Santoro double faulted on match point, only his second of the match,
completing a 6-3, 3-6, 7-5 survival.</TE>
<TE>   "He's very easy to get frustrated against," Sampras said, in
obvious understatement. "He doesn't play with a ton of power, but he
gives you no pace, especially off that forehand side, where he just
kind of chips it, chips it."</TE>
<TE>   "Chips it" was a fitting description of the Santoro forehand. He
hits with both hands off both sides and the forehand stroke looks
like somebody either chopping wood or laying down a drag bunt.</TE>
<TE>   But it was effective, as always, against Sampras, who kept trying
to run away with the match and kept getting dinked to death. After a
poor-serving second set--he got only 50% of his first serves in
during the match--Sampras got out to a 4-1 lead in the third set and
had two break points for 5-1, but didn't convert.</TE>
<TE>   Then it really got hairy. Serving for the match at 5-3, Sampras
started with a double fault and ended up losing the game when he
tried a drop shot and Santoro, the ultimate tennis roadrunner, chased
it down and made a passing shot. Beep, beep. Sampras was in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Santoro held for 5-5 and then was ahead, love-15, when Sampras hit
an overhead close to the baseline.</TE>
<TE>   "At 5-5 of the third set, I was feeling very good," Santoro said,
"and then a huge mistake was made, and that hurt me a lot." The
mistake, according to Santoro, was the line call. He felt Sampras'
shot had been long. It was called good.</TE>
<TE>   Sampras held, and then, at 15-40, after Sampras had gotten to
match point with another overhead, Santoro dumped his second serve
into the net. Sampras said it was the last thing he expected.</TE>
<TE>   "I kind of stood over a little bit and stood in," Sampras said. "I
think he saw that I might do something with his second. He went for
it and hit it into the net."</TE>
<TE>   Sampras' victory got him into the quarterfinals and also got the
tournament to Friday with a superstar still around. Andre Agassi lost
in the first round and the women's draw was without the marquee value
of the Williams sisters, Jennifer Capriati and Lindsay Davenport, who
didn't enter.</TE>
<TE>   Sampras will highlight four men's matches today, when he faces
Germany's Rainer Schuettler, ranked 24 spots below Sampras' No. 13 on
the tour's entry system.</TE>
<TE>   Also meeting in today's quarterfinals will be Tim Henman of
England against Gaston Gaudio of Argentina, Lleyton Hewitt of
Australia against Thomas Enqvist of Sweden, and Todd Martin against
Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia. Martin defeated Karol Kucera of
Slovakia, 7-5, 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt, No. 1 in the entry system and therefore top-seeded here,
not only beat American Jan Michael Gambill, 6-2, 6-4, but seemed to
enjoy the frustration of his opponent, who started tossing his racket
around six games into the match.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good feeling out there ... if you can look over the net
and see him getting frustrated at such an early point," Hewitt said.</TE>
<TE>   Henman was helped by some similar frustration on the part of
volcanic Marat Safin, who served for the first set at 5-4 and failed,
then slammed his racket to the court in the middle of the tiebreaker
en route to a 7-6 (3), 6-4 loss.</TE>

<HD>Hingis' Learning Power</HD>
<DH>Tennis: She applies lessons from last summer to beat Seles
and advance to final against surprising teenager Hantuchova.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIAN WELLS</DL>
<LD>Martina Hingis, the thinker, might make the same mental mistake once
or twice. But three times?</LD>
<LD>   That's quite rare.</LD>
<LD>   Consider her recent record against Monica Seles. In less than a
week last summer, she was fairly pounded by the powerful, angled
groundstrokes of Seles, losing in straight sets in San Diego and in
three at Manhattan Beach in August.</LD>
<TE>   "I was probably a little surprised the way she came out, just kind
of underestimated her," Hingis said. "But not since then."</TE>
<TE>   Hingis has defeated Seles three straight times after the Southern
California lesson, and the most emphatic victory was Thursday night
in the semifinals at the Pacific Life Open. The second-seeded Hingis
beat No. 4 Seles, 6-3, 6-2, in 59 minutes at the Indian Wells Tennis
Garden, dropping serve just once and winning 10 of 11 points at the
net.</TE>
<TE>   "I played very well," said Hingis, who has lost to Seles only
twice in their last 12 meetings. "I was really out there from the
first point on. I haven't played a match like this in a while. I'm
very happy about it. I had a little confidence going into this match
because I knew I was playing well throughout the whole tournament."</TE>
<TE>   Said Seles: "I struggled yesterday and today again. I couldn't
find my rhythm. That was really it. I just made error after error and
Martina played too good. I guess she made me hit those errors."</TE>
<TE>   Awaiting Hingis is a surprise teenage finalist. And not any of the
usual highly regarded teenagers, Kim Clijsters, Justine Henin or Daja
Bedanova. Earlier, 18-year-old Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia
survived a nerve-racking semifinal against Emmanuelle Gagliardi of
Switzerland, winning, 4-6, 6-0, 6-4, in 2 hours 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   This will be her first final. She reached two semifinals last
year, indoors at Oklahoma City and on grass at Birmingham. This will
be Hingis' fourth final in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't ask for more," Hantuchova said. "It's so exciting for me,
to be first time in the final and playing one of the best players in
the world at a major tournament like this. I'm so happy just to be
here. I'm enjoying every minute here."</TE>
<TE>   Hingis has taken a close interest in the progress of Hantuchova.
They have practiced together and Hingis watched her matches this
week, including the final two sets of the semifinal.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have thought that maybe she wins that one a little
easier," Hingis said. "It's always a little nerve-racking. She was in
a different position, playing [Justine] Henin, nothing to lose. This
time she had to prove it."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Hingis and Melanie Molitor, her mother and coach,
started reminiscing about Hingis' early days on the tour. Molitor
asked her daughter about whether she was nervous before her first
semifinal.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the U.S. Open when I played the semifinals," she said.
"But I played Steffi Graf there. It was a little different playing
Steffi Graf than Emmanuelle Gagliardi."</TE>
<TE>   Hantuchova, ranked 26th, will move up to at least No. 18 when new
rankings are released Monday. If she wins the tournament, she will
move to No. 17. She started the year at No. 38 and the recent
progress has caused her to do some rethinking.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, at the end of the year, I wanted to be in the top 20
by the end of the next year, and I'm already there," she said. "So
now I have to set up the next goal."</TE>
<TE>   The 25-year-old Gagliardi, now ranked 70th, will break into the
top 50 at No. 46 and was delighted to receive the news, beaming at
the information. She recorded her best result and frustrated
Hantuchova with a series of drop shots, including one in the fourth
game of the third set that spun away from the Slovak with some wicked
backspin.</TE>
<TE>   "I had an easy ball," Gagliardi said. "I am pretty natural. I
always express myself. I think it was a clever shot at that point."</TE>
<TE>   She said she likes to express herself. What part of her
personality did that shot express? "You need a psychologist to answer
this," Gagliardi said.</TE>
<TE>   Hingis is more familiar with the game of Gagliardi since they
played Fed Cup together for Switzerland. She said she likes to
practice with youngsters like Bedanova and Hantuchova, getting an
early glimpse at the competition.</TE>
<TE>   "You now, kind of test them a little bit, like they've been
testing me," she said. "I test them now."</TE>

<KH>TV-RADIO LARRY STEWART</KH>
<HD>Mariotti Quits His Radio Job</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the best and most topical sports talk-show hosts, Jay
Mariotti, quit his job with the Sporting News radio network Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Mariotti, heard on KMPC (1540) in Los Angeles from 7-11 a.m.,
called it a mutual parting.</LD>
<LD>   "My contract was up this summer and I wasn't going to continue
after that, so we just decided to end it now," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Chris Brennan, the president of the Chicago-based Sporting News
network, also called it a mutual parting.</TE>
<TE>   "Jay put in seven good years, and it was just time to break away,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mariotti, 42, also a sports columnist for the Chicago Sun-Times,
said one factor was the work involved in holding down two jobs. He
took some time off last year to be with his wife while she recovered
from breast cancer, and although she is fine now, he said he wants to
spend more time with her and his two daughters. But he didn't rule
out getting back into local radio in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   He complained that his national show was not marketed or promoted
very well in Chicago, nor did he like his time slot there.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a bigger audience in L.A. than in Chicago," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mariotti's partner, Jim Litke, a sportswriter for the Associated
Press, is also leaving the morning show, but Brennan said Litke may
still be involved with the network in some capacity.</TE>
<TE>   Brennan said that, for now, guest hosts would work the morning
show.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 1, the Sporting News network lost late-night host Bob
Kemp, who abruptly resigned after 10 years with the network. Kemp
called his resignation "a retirement" and is now living in Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Double Duty</TE>
<TE>   Rory Markas is a good example of the ups and downs in
broadcasting.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, the San Fernando Valley native who attended Chatsworth
High and Cal State Northridge lost his television job with the
Milwaukee Brewers and a month later lost his job as a sports anchor
with KCBS, Channel 2. In 1998, he lost his job as the radio voice of
the Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   Now, in the category of when it rains it pours, Markas has two
jobs that had him hopping. He just completed his fourth season as the
radio voice of USC basketball and is beginning his first as one of
the Angels' two new radio announcers.</TE>
<TE>   He was in Sacramento Thursday night, announcing USC's overtime
loss to North Carolina Wilmington. He'll take an early flight today
to Tucson, where the Angels play a spring training game against the
Chicago White Sox.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, who released Mario Impemba from his contract so he
could return home to Detroit, accommodated Markas as well, allowing
him to fulfill his USC duties. That meant the other new Angel
announcer, Terry Smith, who came from the New York Yankees' triple-A
club in Columbus, Ohio, had to handle some of the Angel radio
broadcasts heard on KLAC (570) by himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'm going to owe Terry a dinner," Markas said.</TE>
<TE>   The Other Half</TE>
<TE>   Because USC basketball until recently was overshadowed by just
about everything else, Markas' radio partner, Jim Hefner, has never
gotten the recognition he deserves.</TE>
<TE>   Hefner has been doing radio or television analysis on USC
basketball off and on since 1980, following a 13-year stint as an
assistant coach under Bob Boyd.</TE>
<TE>   Hefner has also been an associate athletic director at USC, worked
with John Jackson on Forum boxing, and has been involved with
basketball camps.</TE>
<TE>   His first broadcasting job was with ON TV and he later also worked
for Prime Ticket. He worked with Larry Kahn on radio before teaming
up with Markas.</TE>
<TE>   Hefner's commentary is crisp, insightful and balanced. His
interview with former UCLA coach Gene Bartow before USC played host
to the Bruins at the Forum this season was excellent. Bartow opened
up about just how unprepared psychologically he was for handling the
pressure of following John Wooden.</TE>
<TE>   Hefner resigned from coaching after Boyd's last year, but says
that was a coincidence. He was planning to get out of coaching
anyway. His daughter, Brook, now 24, had just been born and he wanted
to spend more time at home.</TE>
<TE>   "With the recruiting and everything else, coaching just takes too
much of your time," Hefner said.</TE>
<TE>   Complaint Dept.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Siegel, an attorney with CMG Worldwide, a West Hollywood
marketing and management firm representing Al Joyner and the estate
of Florence Griffith Joyner, filed a complaint with ESPN after a
Griffith Joyner "SportsCentury" was shown last month.</TE>
<TE>   The firm said ESPN had led Al Joyner to believe the show would be
a celebration of his late wife's career but instead much of the show
was a rehash of accusations pertaining to drugs. The firm also asked
that the show not be shown again, although ESPN Classic had it on
last Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The firm finally got a response this week from an ESPN lawyer
saying the show was fair and balanced.</TE>
<TE>   The feeling here is, the drug rumors can't be ignored, but
negativity doesn't always mean good journalism.</TE>
<TE>   More Complaints</TE>
<TE>   Channel 2 angered basketball viewers last Saturday when it cut
away from the Ohio State-Illinois Big Ten tournament semifinal with
four minutes left to show four minutes of commercials before going to
the Pacific 10 championship game.</TE>
<TE>   And tennis fans weren't too happy with ESPN for delaying
Wednesday's Pete Sampras-Albert Costa match in the Pacific Life Open
until 11 p.m. The coverage on ESPN, ESPN2 and ABC today through
Sunday will be live. Sunday's men's final will be on ABC at 10:30
a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   In the category of preferential treatment, Fox Sports Net has
produced a half-hour Angel preview and a one-hour Dodger preview. The
debut showing of the Angel preview will be Saturday at 9:30 p.m., and
the first airing of the Dodger preview will be Sunday at 5 p.m.
Wonder if Fox's ownership of the Dodgers has anything to do with the
length of the shows? Or is it that there is simply more interest in
the Dodgers?</TE>
<TE>   Mark Rolfing, who has worked as a golf reporter and commentator
for NBC, ESPN, ABC and CNBC over the last 15 years, makes his debut
as the new host of the Golf Channel's "Golf Talk Live" on Monday.
Rolfing's first guest will be Johnny Miller. The show is on at 5 and
8 p.m....Reminder: Today's second round of the Bay Hill golf coverage
on USA will be shown on cable, delayed, at 4 p.m., but because
DirecTV uses the East Coast feed, it will be on live at 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The CBS announcers working the NCAA tournament games at
Pittsburgh, where UCLA plays Mississippi tonight, are Verne Lundquist
and former Seton Hall coach Bill Raftery. The sideline reporter is
Lesley Visser.... DirecTV subscribers who didn't get to see the games
they wanted to see Thursday can still pay $49 for a package of games
through the third round or pay $19.95 for an individual game.</TE>
<TE>   Recommended viewing: This week's edition of "Beyond the Glory" on
Fox Sports Net Sunday at 8 p.m. deals with a complex topic: Reggie
Smith .... Lisa Leslie is featured on "Sports Biography" on Oxygen
today at 5 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach on April 14, live from 12:30-3
p.m., will be the first CART race televised by</TE>
<TE>   Fox .... TWI's Barry Frank</TE>
<TE>   has negotiated a deal for CBS</TE>
<TE>   and NBC to carry seven bull-riding events, beginning in October.</TE>
<TE>   In Closing</TE>
<TE>   With enough promotion, almost anything is going to get a good
rating. Maybe that explains why "A Season on the Brink" got a
national cable rating of 3.45 on ESPN. Couple that with the .55 the
slightly toned-down version got on ESPN2, and the rating was a 4.0.
ESPN estimates more than 5 million people watched the made-for-TV
movie.</TE>

<HD>Violence Unabated Amid U.S. Envoy's Mideast Visit</HD>
<DH>Conflict: A maimed statue in Bethlehem symbolizes the carnage Zinni
seeks to end.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BETHLEHEM, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>Balanced on the rooftop of St. Vincent's Church, the statue of the
Virgin Mary, arms outstretched, has served for more than 100 years as a
graceful symbol of divine protection over the traditional birthplace of
Jesus.</LD>
<LD>   But hours before U.S. envoy Anthony C. Zinni arrived here Thursday, a
predawn gun battle between Israeli troops and Palestinian militias
transformed the statue into a poignant reminder of the devastating
violence he is trying to quell.</LD>
<LD>   The Virgin's nose was lopped off, as was her left hand and all but one
finger of her right hand, when an Israeli tank shell slammed into the
church's stone roof. Shrapnel from the shell punched holes in the
statue's robes and blew up the floodlights that had illuminated it. The
army said the shell hit the church by accident.</LD>
<TE>   The statue's maiming was an inauspicious start to a day that saw at
least nine Palestinians and three Israelis die before Zinni, the retired
Marine Corps general turned would-be peacemaker, arrived here on his
third attempt to quell what is now 17 1/2 months of fighting.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian gunmen in Bethlehem shot dead two men who they said had
helped Israeli security forces kill militia leader Atef Abeiyat. They
dragged the two bloodied bodies behind a car and then tried to string
them up across from the Church of the Nativity in Manger Square.
Palestinian police officers stopped them.</TE>
<TE>   In other violence, Palestinians blew up their second Merkava tank in a
month, on a road leading to a Jewish settlement in the Gaza Strip,
killing three Israeli soldiers. A coalition of militias claimed
responsibility for the attack.</TE>
<TE>   In the West Bank city of Ramallah, Israeli snipers shot dead four
Palestinian militants. Another Palestinian died of wounds he sustained in
earlier fighting with troops.</TE>
<TE>   An Israeli helicopter gunship fired into a car near the West Bank town
of Tulkarm, killing two Palestinian militants, one of them an explosives
expert the army accused of assisting in a string of attacks on Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   When Israel two weeks ago launched its largest military campaign in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip since the 1967 Middle East War, Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon said his goal was to hit the Palestinians so hard
they would have to agree to a cease-fire. Commentators here have
speculated that he ordered the army to seize Palestinian-controlled areas
as bargaining chips in negotiations after Zinni's arrival.</TE>
<TE>   Troops and tanks withdrew from Ramallah, the most important
Palestinian city, late Thursday night after Zinni dined with Sharon.
Zinni brought with him a demand from the Bush administration that Israel
pull out completely from the Palestinian-controlled territories as a
prelude to a cease-fire.</TE>
<TE>   An army spokesman said Israel also pulled out of the centers of
Kalkilya and Tulkarm, and from a Gaza Strip village that the army entered
Thursday. But troops and tanks were still blockading all the major cities
and towns of the West Bank, and remained inside Bethlehem.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli government has said it is eager to achieve a cease-fire
but has warned that it will do "whatever necessary" to defend its
citizens.</TE>
<TE>   "Let there be no misunderstanding," Justice Minister Meir Sheetrit
said on Israel Radio. "Zinni or no Zinni, if there is no cessation of
terror, not only will we not decrease our activity, but we will increase
it."</TE>
<TE>   But Nabil abu Rudaineh, a senior aide to Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat, vowed Thursday that Palestinians won't
participate in talks if Israel's campaign continues.</TE>
<TE>   "There won't be . . . any meetings with any Israelis until they stop
their aggression and withdraw from all the cities, including Bethlehem
and Ramallah and cities in Gaza," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's bloodshed virtually ensured a fresh round of retaliation
and revenge.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian security chief Mohammed Dahlan, who was scheduled to hold
talks with Zinni and the Israelis on restoring security cooperation, told
Israel Radio that suicide attacks are acts of self-defense and warned
Israelis that whoever harms civilians should expect a similar response.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of Palestinians turned out Thursday for the funeral of
Mutasen Hammad, a leader of the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade militia that is
linked to Arafat's Fatah movement. He was killed earlier in the day when
Israeli gunships fired on his car near Tulkarm. In a statement, the army
said Hammad was targeted because he had manufactured bombs and explosives
belts used by suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's killing in January of Raed Karmi, another Al Aqsa leader from
Tulkarm, touched off a firestorm of Palestinian revenge attacks that
buried efforts to achieve a cease-fire.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, the State Department called on Israel to pull out
completely from Palestinian-controlled areas as Zinni's effort began.
Sharon's order for the withdrawal from Ramallah came three days after
more than 100 tanks drove into the city in what the army said was an
effort to crush the "infrastructure of terrorism" there.</TE>
<TE>   But Palestinians were skeptical that Israel would fully withdraw.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement issued after Sharon announced the pullout, but before
tanks began to move, the Palestinian Authority charged that Israel is
"reinforcing its presence inside Ramallah, and its snipers are carrying
out more acts of killings and assassinations in the streets of Ramallah
indiscriminately."</TE>
<TE>   In Bethlehem, bits of stone blasted from the roof when the Israeli
tank shell hit littered the steps outside St. Vincent's Thursday
afternoon. The statue, visible for miles around, now looks from a
distance as if it has been charred, an effect created by shrapnel from
the tank shell stripping large patches of white paint away and revealing
the black metal beneath.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the empty church, workers have placed the Virgin's left hand
and four of the fingers from her right hand on the altar.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, the Israeli army said that one of its tanks fired
toward the roof of a Bethlehem University building but hit the church,
which stands in front of the university.</TE>
<TE>   The church is part of a compound that includes the Holy Family
maternity hospital and an orphanage. Workers said Thursday that the
shooting started around midnight and lasted for nearly three hours. They
said they moved women who were in labor or had just delivered their
babies into hallways to ensure their safety while Palestinian gunmen
traded fire with troops in the streets outside.</TE>
<TE>   The army said it regretted the damage to the statue. Soldiers, the
statement said, were given maps of holy sites in Bethlehem before tanks
moved into the southern end of town Thursday morning. They were told that
it was "forbidden to fire on or enter" those locations, including the
university building.</TE>
<TE>   "The [army] regrets this incident, and the brigade commander will take
disciplinary measures against those responsible," the statement said.</TE>

<HD>Davis to Close State's Privately Run Prisons</HD>
<DH>Funding: Elected with the help of $2.3 million from guards' union,
governor includes plan in budget.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis is ending California's experiment with privately
operated prisons, fulfilling his promise to a state prison guards union
that spent $2.3 million to help elect him four years ago.</LD>
<LD>   The governor's decision, tucked away in a little-noticed paragraph
deep within his budget proposal, comes as he seeks the endorsement of the
California Correctional Peace Officers Assn. and the hundreds of
thousands of dollars in campaign donations that accompany it.</LD>
<LD>   Although the union hasn't yet chosen between Davis and Republican Bill
Simon Jr. for the November election, it is clearly pleased with Davis'
move.</LD>
<TE>   In a recent telephone recording intended for union members, a longtime
lobbyist for the Correctional Peace Officers said the proposal "does
follow through with promises made by Gov. Davis in past years. . . . So
the governor [is] a man of his word in that regard."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' budget proposes closing five of California's nine private
prisons on June 30 and phasing out the rest as their operating contracts
expire. He cites budget concerns, saying that the state can save about $5
million by closing the minimum-security facilities. Others, including the
legislative analyst's office, dispute the potential savings.</TE>
<TE>   Although administration officials cited problems with some private
prisons, recent audits by the California Department of Corrections gave
high marks to all five facilities slated for closure.</TE>
<TE>   The governor's plan will be reviewed by the Legislature. But even if
lawmakers try to keep the prisons open, the governor will have the last
word: He can use his line-item veto authority to remove their funding.</TE>
<TE>   Critics in the Legislature denounced the proposal as a favor to the
prison guards' union, which has long fought the use of private prisons,
where the public employees' organization has no jurisdiction.</TE>
<TE>   "Quite obviously, it is a political payback from the governor," said
Assemblyman Phil Wyman (R-Tehachapi).</TE>
<TE>   The plan is the latest instance in which Davis has taken actions to
keep the union in his camp.</TE>
<TE>   Most prominently, he signed into law a labor agreement, negotiated by
his staff, that will boost prison guards' pay 33.76% over the next five
years. By comparison, the administration has reached labor pacts giving
most other state workers a 5% raise in their take-home pay over the next
two years. The legislative analyst's office projects that all the
contracts will cost a combined $902 million by 2006-07. The agreement
with the correctional officers, which takes full effect that year, will
account for $652 million of that sum.</TE>
<TE>Union Among Largest Campaign Donors</TE>
<TE>   Under the guards' contract, the union's 28,000 members will attain
virtual parity in pay and benefits with California Highway Patrol
officers, and their raises will be pegged to those given to police in Los
Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco and Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   The Correctional Peace Officers Assn. is among the largest campaign
donors in the state. Its support bestows the imprimatur of law
enforcement, which can be especially important for Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1998 campaign, the union's endorsement "was a key part of the
Davis team's strategy to defend against any notion that he was soft on
crime," recalled Dave Puglia, a top aide to Republican Dan Lungren's
failed campaign.</TE>
<TE>   After the election, union President Don Novey estimated that his union
had spent $2.3 million in direct donations and independent spending to
help elect Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Since Davis took office in 1999, the union has donated $55,000
directly to his campaign committee and helped him raise $356,000 more by
hosting the Governor's Cup golf tournaments at Pebble Beach, which
attract a who's who of Sacramento's lobbyist corps.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, [the union's endorsement] is a top priority," said Bob Stern
of the Center for Governmental Studies in Los Angeles. "They're one of
the most powerful interest groups in California, if not the most powerful
group."</TE>
<TE>   Wyman, the Republican legislator, felt the union's wrath when it spent
more than $200,000 to help defeat him in last week's Republican primary
for a redrawn Assembly seat in the Lancaster area. Wyman attributes the
union's animus to his support of private prisons, but Novey said there
were other reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Davis Press Secretary Steven Maviglio said the union's political sway
had nothing to do with Davis' proposal to close the facilities. Rather,
facing a $17.1-billion deficit, Davis saw an opportunity to save money,
Maviglio said. The governor believes his plan would save the state $5.1
million. The legislative analyst's office puts the savings at about half
that sum.</TE>
<TE>   "The main reason is to save money and because of the declining inmate
population," Maviglio said. "But one of the reasons is that privatization
is more trouble than it has been worth. There have been a lot of lawsuits
and headaches."</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever the reasons, we'll take it," former union lobbyist Jeff
Thompson said in the recorded phone message to union members.</TE>
<TE>   In the recording, Thompson both extolled the labor contract, citing a
legislative analysis that the pay hike would "conservatively" cost the
state between $500 million and $1 billion annually by 2006, and lauded
Davis' proposal to scrap the five private prisons.</TE>
<TE>Message Refers to Promises by Davis</TE>
<TE>   "As many of our members are aware, the whole concept of privatization
has been a thorn in our side," the message said. "That move is
appreciated. It does follow through with promises made by Gov. Davis in
past years on this subject matter. So the governor [is] a man of his word
in that regard."</TE>
<TE>   The union asked Davis and Lungren about their positions on private
prisons during the 1998 campaign, but it's not an issue that Davis
discussed publicly. Maviglio said he was unaware of any promise by Davis,
and Thompson could not be reached. Union President Novey said he has not
discussed the issue with the governor.</TE>
<TE>   The California Correctional Peace Officers Assn. represents the 28,000
guards in state prisons but has no jurisdiction over private
institutions. Novey said his opposition has nothing to do with the
union's lack of influence over the private facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "They are prisons for profit," Novey said in an interview. "They're
there to make a profit. Public safety should never be put in a position
of having to make money. . . . It doesn't have to do with the numbers.
You don't barter public safety issues."</TE>
<TE>   The decision to scrap private prisons amounts to a reversal of
policies of Davis' Republican predecessors, George Deukmejian and Pete
Wilson, who authorized them as a way to house minimum-security inmates at
relatively low cost, and help ease crowding at state prisons at a time
when the number of inmates was rising rapidly.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the prison population has fallen to 156,000 from a peak of
162,000. Still, California's 33 prisons remain at almost 190% of
capacity, according to the Department of Corrections.</TE>
<TE>   By state prison standards, the private lockups are small. The five
slated for closure house a combined 1,400 inmates. The inmates are
nearing the end of their sentences, and all have been screened by state
corrections officials and deemed low-risk.</TE>
<TE>   The five prisons scheduled to close on June 30 are Mesa Verde in
Bakersfield; Leo Chesney in Live Oak, north of Sacramento; Baker
Community Correctional Facility in the desert town east of Los Angeles;
Eagle Mountain in Riverside County; and McFarland Community Correctional
Facility in Kern County.</TE>
<TE>   Four additional prisons would close when their contracts expire in
2007: Victor Valley and Desert View, both in Adelanto, San Bernardino
County; and Central Valley and Golden State, both in McFarland.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think Gov. Davis knows enough about what the private prisons
are doing," said Marvin Wiebe of Cornell Cos., the Houston-based firm
that runs the Baker and Live Oak facilities. "If he could send his people
out, I think he'd have a different perspective."</TE>
<TE>   Although the state estimates that it houses prisoners for slightly
less than Cornell's annual cost of $14,910 per inmate, Wiebe said the
state doesn't count the cost of building state prisons, roughly $500
million each. When construction and other costs are taken into account,
the state cost is far higher than the private prison cost, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I absolutely think it will cost the state money. We're significantly
less expensive," Wiebe said.</TE>
<TE>Corrections Official Praises Live Oak Prison</TE>
<TE>   In a letter last August, Gregory Harding, the Department of
Corrections official who oversees private prisons, said that in a
two-year period there were only two drug-related offenses at the Live Oak
prison, suggesting it "is largely free of drugs and drug use."</TE>
<TE>   "The inmates are treated with fundamental fairness and the facility is
a clean, orderly, well-managed facility with excellent leadership,"
Harding's letter says.</TE>
<TE>   Companies that run four of the five prisons--Cornell, Management and
Training Corp. of Utah, and Wackenhut Corrections Co. of Florida--operate
in other states. Alternative Programs Inc., however, has only Mesa Verde
in Bakersfield, where it is based.</TE>
<TE>   An audit done in 2000 found Mesa Verde to be in compliance with 95% of
the state's requirements. What's more, the company charges the state less
per inmate now than when it opened in 1987, and a state corrections
official lauded Mesa Verde in 1998 as "an efficient, well-run operation"
that is involved in community projects. It donates much of the harvest
from its vegetable garden to local homeless shelters, for example.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the union," said Gary White, Mesa Verde's co-founder. "They've
stated for years that they want to do away with privatization. [Davis]
needs their backing for the upcoming election. That's my opinion. He has
got to have their backing, and the money that goes with it. That's
politics."</TE>
<TE>   Private prisons won't disappear without a battle. Sen. Richard Polanco
(D-Los Angeles), a critic of state prisons and of the guards' union,
vowed to try to persuade Davis that closing the private prisons will cost
the state money and "create more problems and overcrowding in the [state]
prisons."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Green, spokesman for the Youth and Adult Correctional Agency,
said that even though some private prisons are well run, particularly the
one at Live Oak, others have caused "enormous administrative problems."</TE>
<TE>   But he said the decision to close the facilities is firm. "We've come
to the conclusion that we don't want any more contract prisons, and we're
going to let the contracts expire," he said.</TE>

<HD>Bequest Leads to Deep Rift for Nixon Kin</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In the eight years since President Richard M. Nixon was laid to
rest on a Yorba Linda hillside, his two daughters have been embroiled in
a bitter dispute over how best to showcase the legacy of the only man to
resign from the U.S. presidency.</LD>
<LD>   Now the quiet feud has spilled into open court, as the sisters battle
over a $12-million bequest from Nixon's longtime friend, the late Bebe
Rebozo.</LD>
<LD>   At stake is not just the money, but how Nixon's memory will be
preserved. The dispute grows out of the sisters' sharply divergent views
over whether the Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace Foundation, the beneficiary
of Rebozo's bequest, should be operated by the family or by an
independent board of directors.</LD>
<TE>   On one side is Julie Nixon Eisenhower, who fought as a young woman
alongside her father as he faced a national storm over Watergate. On the
other side is Tricia Nixon Cox, whose White House wedding made the cover
of Time but who shared her mother's cool reserve. And in the middle is
the largess of Rebozo, a Miami businessman whose friendship with the
president brought him more attention than he liked--including
investigations into campaign contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, Eisenhower's vision has prevailed, with the Yorba Linda
library--and its assets--overseen by a 24-member board that includes the
sisters and such former Nixon White House figures as Henry Kissinger and
Kenneth L. Kachigian.</TE>
<TE>   But terms of Rebozo's $12-million bequest have given Cox an opening to
try to wrest control of the money--which would double the foundation's
endowment--from the board.</TE>
<TE>   In lawsuits filed in Orange County and in Miami earlier this year, the
Nixon Foundation is seeking to head off Cox and to oust her from a
three-person board that Rebozo's will established to oversee the bequest.
With its legal action, the foundation hopes to finally free up the money,
most of which has been tied up in probate because of the dispute.</TE>
<TE>   The roots of the dispute go back to a struggle between the sisters
after Nixon's death over the degree of control the family should have
over the foundation.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1997, Mrs. Eisenhower went down one road and Mrs. Cox went down
the other," said John H. Taylor, executive director of the Nixon library.
"This has been a very, very difficult path for Mrs. Eisenhower to walk.
She had to take a step . . . which caused members of her own family to be
angry with her. That was not easy."</TE>
<TE>   Another director--and Eisenhower ally--was more blunt: "There's a
complete estrangement between the sisters," the director said, asking
that he not be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Neither of the sisters could be reached for comment, and their
attorneys declined to discuss the case.</TE>
<TE>   The court filings are an attempt by the foundation to break the
deadlock between the two sisters by pushing Cox aside.</TE>
<TE>   "We're essentially asking the Rebozo trust in Miami to go ahead and
send us the money," Taylor said. "What is clear is that Mr. Rebozo wanted
it to go to the foundation endowment in perpetuity, and we're asking the
court to make that happen."</TE>
<TE>   The heart of the dispute predates Rebozo's death, said Dimitri Simes,
president of the Nixon Center in Washington, D.C., which is also
supported by the foundation.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're dealing with is a long-standing dispute among members of
the Nixon Foundation over the intent of the former president," said
Simes, who is on the board. "What was supposed to be the role of the
foundation and the mission of the foundation--and accordingly, how the
foundation was supposed to be governed?"</TE>
<TE>   At the time of Nixon's death in 1994, the foundation was loosely
overseen by a group of six Nixon friends. The group decided after Nixon's
death that the foundation needed a more formalized board structure.</TE>
<TE>   Cox and her husband, lawyer Edward Cox, lobbied for a board that would
be controlled by the Nixon family; Eisenhower aligned herself with those
who sought a more independent board. Eisenhower prevailed.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the Rebozo bequest.</TE>
<TE>   Rebozo, who made millions in Florida real estate and other ventures,
was one of Nixon's closest friends for more than 40 years--a friendship
that both men said was steeped more in their love for a good steak than
in politics.</TE>
<TE>   When Rebozo died four years ago, he left 65% of his estate--with a
total current value as high as $19 million--to the Nixon Library under
the caveat that all expenditures be approved by Nixon's daughters and
another longtime Nixon friend, Robert Abplanalp.</TE>
<TE>   But the two sisters have been unable to agree on how the money should
be controlled, leaving the estate tied up in Florida probate court.</TE>
<TE>   The feud flared up last year when Cox refused to sign a complex legal
agreement, which her sister and Abplanalp signed, that would send the
money to the foundation's permanent endowment and limit spending to 5%
per year.</TE>
<TE>   Cox countered with her own proposal that would give the sisters and
Abplanalp the power to distribute the money, including to outside
charities, unless the foundation board met to overrule such a decision
within 60 days--a difficult task given how far-flung the board members
are. There is no overt provision allowing any personal use of the
donation.</TE>
<TE>   Eisenhower and the rest of the foundation rejected Cox's proposal, and
in January they took the issue to court, describing the situation as a
hopeless stalemate that threatened to deprive the library of millions of
dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Cox, who lives in New York, has challenged the California court's
jurisdiction and asked that the dispute be handled by the Florida probate
court.</TE>
<TE>   "Permitting the two separate proceedings to proceed simultaneously in
two separate states . . . risks inconsistent judgments," Cox's lawyer,
Thomas Malcolm, said in court documents.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for the Rebozo trust, who did not return a phone call
seeking comment, also have argued that Orange County courts do not have
jurisdiction. The trust paid $780,000 to the foundation in 1999 but has
vowed to hold on to the rest of the money unless the sisters reach an
agreement. It hasn't sided with either of the sisters.</TE>
<TE>   The argument is a rare public airing of a sibling spat. Cox, the elder
of the sisters, was born in February 1946, nine days after her father,
then a Whittier lawyer, declared he was running for Congress. Eisenhower
was born two years later, as Nixon ran for reelection.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next quarter century, the girls grew up as their father
became one of the most powerful men in the world--and one of the most
controversial--as he moved from being President Dwight Eisenhower's vice
president in the '50s into the White House himself in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   In 1968, the Eisenhower and Nixon families, already linked by
politics, merged with the marriage of Julie Nixon and David Eisenhower,
the former president and war hero's grandson. Three years later, Tricia
married Edward Cox in the Rose Garden in a ceremony that took on some of
the aura of a royal wedding.</TE>
<TE>   The sisters, though, pursued divergent paths. Eisenhower was active in
her father's campaigns. After he resigned in 1974, she served as an
editor of the Saturday Evening Post and wrote five books.</TE>
<TE>   Although Cox stayed largely out of the limelight, the recent legal
filings threaten to pull her into the public venue of a courtroom as the
foundation seeks to break the deadlock between them. And the fractious
dispute marks a disharmonious footnote to what was the unlikely
friendship between the reserved president and the colorful Rebozo.</TE>
<TE>   The men met while Nixon was a senator from California, and a friend
asked Rebozo to entertain him. Rebozo took Nixon out fishing on his boat,
the Cocolobo. Nixon, who was never much of a fisherman, took a pile of
papers. As Rebozo fished, Nixon worked, and the seeds of their
relationship were sown.</TE>
<TE>   Rebozo was with Nixon on the eve of his resignation, and when the
former president died, Rebozo was there for the final rites. At the
burial, he was seated directly behind the two women now fighting over his
final gift to his friend.</TE>

<KH>TIMES POLL</KH>
<HD>Support for a Valley City Is Growing</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A majority of San Fernando Valley voters believes the region should
secede from Los Angeles, as does nearly half the electorate citywide, a
new Los Angeles Times poll shows.</LD>
<LD>   Secession led 55% to 36% in the Valley and 46% to 38% in the city as a
whole--meaning all of Los Angeles, including the Valley. The balance of
voters in each category are undecided.</LD>
<LD>   Support for secession citywide is up 10% from a year ago. In the
Valley, it has increased 4%, and its support there appears most firm.</LD>
<TE>   The findings in the latest poll are close, however, to those of a
Times Poll conducted in March 1999, which found that a majority of Valley
residents backed the idea but that it was viewed less favorably outside
that area.</TE>
<TE>   For secession to win, state law requires that a majority of voters in
the Valley and the entire city approve it.</TE>
<TE>   The poll findings come at a time when breakaway proposals for the
Valley, Hollywood and the harbor area are gaining visibility.</TE>
<TE>   Just last week, the state commission that oversees the formation of
new cities concluded that Hollywood would be financially healthy if it
became independent of Los Angeles. The Local Agency Formation Commission
has given similar, preliminary evaluations of the finances of a Valley
city and a harbor-area city.</TE>
<TE>   Secession questions for all three regions are expected to appear on
the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "I just think Los Angeles is too big," said poll respondent Diane
Tomczak, who lives in San Pedro and strongly favors Valley secession, in
a follow-up interview. "There are too many people and it's too hard to
govern such a vast area."</TE>
<TE>   Tomczak said her support for Valley secession was even stronger than
her sympathy for the breakaway movement in San Pedro, because she
believes that the more affluent Valley will be better able to survive on
its own than the harbor area.</TE>
<TE>   Karon Hovey, who lives in the Porter Ranch community of the west San
Fernando Valley, said she will support secession if it means improvements
in city services, including police, fire and transportation.</TE>
<TE>   "For 50 years, we've [lived in] Los Angeles, and I still identify with
it," Hovey said. "But I really feel that this part of Los Angeles is
neglected."</TE>
<TE>   The pro-secession sentiment has grown in the last year, even though
residents are very upbeat about the state of the city, the poll showed.
Two in three respondents said things in Los Angeles are going well, up
from 51% in a Times Poll conducted in April 1997. Slightly fewer than
three in 10 said things are going badly, down from 46% five years ago.</TE>
<TE>Hahn Calls Secession 'Harebrained Idea'</TE>
<TE>   Similar proportions of Valley residents voiced approval and
disapproval about the city's state of affairs.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Mayor James K. Hahn reiterated his long-held opposition
to secession, calling the proposed breakups a "harebrained idea" and
questioning the state commission's competence in evaluating the plans.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn is beefing up his ranks of political advisors for the
anti-secession campaign, bringing on two of the region's most influential
political players, attorney William Wardlaw and Democratic consultant
Bill Carrick.</TE>
<TE>   Secession opponents hope to raise $5 million to defeat the measure at
the polls in November.</TE>
<TE>   If the poll findings are any indication, the Hahn team has its work
cut out for it, said Times Poll Director Susan Pinkus.</TE>
<TE>   Just 9% of voters in the Valley and 16% citywide said they had not yet
made up their minds, a relatively low level of indecision for a ballot
initiative this early in the process, Pinkus said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, she said, there remains room for shifts in voter sentiment
before November.</TE>
<TE>   Although voters in the Valley appeared fairly hardened in their
support for secession, with 42% strongly in favor and 13% somewhat in
favor, those in the rest of the city seemed less certain.</TE>
<TE>   About half of those polled citywide who favored secession expressed
only moderate support. About a third of those opposed citywide also
listed their feelings as moderate.</TE>
<TE>   Voters in the moderate column are most likely to be swayed by
arguments for or against the proposal, Pinkus said, and will probably be
a focus of the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The poll, of 798 registered voters throughout Los Angeles, was
conducted from Saturday through Tuesday. It has a margin of sampling
error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   In the harbor region and the southern part of the city, support for
Valley secession was high, with 48% in favor, 35% opposed and 17%
undecided, the poll showed. But in the swath of Los Angeles that
stretches from the Beverly Hills border to the Pasadena line, 39% of
respondents supported the proposal, with 44% opposed and 17% undecided.</TE>
<TE>   On the Westside, voters were about evenly split, with 37% in favor,
40% opposed and 23% undecided.</TE>
<TE>   Citywide, Latinos were 52% in favor of secession and 29% opposed.
Whites followed, with 47% in favor and 39% opposed. The measure had the
least support among African Americans, with just 33% in favor and 47%
opposed.</TE>
<TE>Grappling With the Merits of Secession</TE>
<TE>   "It seems peculiar," said Leandro Rideau, 19, an African American
security guard who lives in Wilshire Center. "I don't really know what
they're trying to gain from it."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Moses, an actor-producer who lives in Pacific Palisades, said he
fears that if Los Angeles becomes two cities, neither one will be big
enough to have real economic and political clout. In addition, he said,
Los Angeles would lose revenue that it needs to provide services to
poorer parts of the city.</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't see what the merits are," Moses said.</TE>
<TE>   But for Angela Jones, who lives in Van Nuys, the potential gain from
secession is palpable.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, a mother of two small children who identified herself to
pollsters as Latina, said she hopes a new Valley city will provide better
police protection.</TE>
<TE>   Now, she said, the area near her home has "gone berserk" with
prostitutes who ply their trade along Sepulveda Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   In a smaller city, she said, police and city officials might be more
responsive.</TE>
<TE>   "In Burbank they pay more attention [to residents]," she said. "I
think if the city is smaller, they'll pay more attention here."</TE>
<TE>   The March 1999 poll found that 60% of Valley voters favored secession
and 30% were opposed. Citywide, 47% supported it and 39% opposed it.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Indicts Enron Auditor Over Shredding</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Andersen faces an obstruction of justice charge after
failing to reach a plea agreement with prosecutors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Federal prosecutors Thursday hit accounting firm Andersen with a
criminal indictment for allegedly orchestrating the "wholesale
destruction" of tons of Enron Corp. documents, raising new doubts about
Andersen's survival.</LD>
<LD>   The one-count indictment is the first of what Justice Department
officials hinted could be a string of criminal charges arising from the
collapse of energy giant Enron, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection Dec. 2 amid an accounting scandal.</LD>
<LD>   The indictment, which does not name any individuals, was handed up
March 7 by a federal grand jury in Houston and unsealed Thursday after
negotiations to reach a plea agreement with Andersen broke down.</LD>
<TE>   Deputy Atty. Gen. Larry Thompson accused Andersen, which was Enron's
auditor until early this year, of destroying "literally tons" of
Enron-related documents and e-mails in a frantic effort that began
shortly after Andersen partners learned about a Securities and Exchange
Commission probe of Enron's partnerships and aggressive accounting
practices.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time, Andersen knew full well that these documents were
relevant to the inquiries and to Enron's collapse," Thompson said.
"Arthur Andersen is charged with a crime that attacks the justice system
itself by impeding investigators and regulators from getting at the
truth."</TE>
<TE>   In seeking the indictment, Thompson said prosecutors were swayed by a
variety of factors, including Andersen's history of wrongdoing and a
desire to set an example to deter similar conduct. Thompson noted that
document shredding was not isolated to a few individuals and occurred at
Andersen offices in Houston, Portland, Ore., London and the company's
Chicago headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen managers ordered employees to work overtime, if necessary, to
complete the destruction; one shredding machine in Andersen's office at
Enron headquarters ran almost constantly, according to the indictment.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen previously had admitted to the shredding, but blamed it on a
handful of partners in the Houston office. It warned that a criminal
indictment could destroy the company.</TE>
<TE>   After the indictment was unsealed, the firm blasted the Justice
Department, calling it "an extraordinary abuse of prosecutorial
discretion."</TE>
<TE>   "A criminal prosecution against the entire firm for obstruction of
justice is both factually and legally baseless," the company said in a
statement Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen attorneys said the primary reason for ending plea discussions
was their inability to secure a waiver from the SEC that would allow
Andersen to continue auditing public companies if it admitted guilt.</TE>
<TE>   A collapse of the 89-year-old firm would put 85,000 employees
worldwide out of work and leave 2,300 customers scrambling to find a new
auditor. Andersen has been attempting to sell itself to a rival, but two
likely candidates--Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and Ernst &amp; Young--said this
week that they aren't interested.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials expressed little sympathy for Andersen's
plight or the ramifications of its potential collapse.</TE>
<TE>   "There are serious charges, and it shouldn't be a surprise to anyone
that serious charges have serious consequences," Thompson said. "It would
be unfortunate for our criminal justice system if any individual or any
entity could say that he or she or it was too big or too important, so as
it couldn't be indicted."</TE>
<TE>   The indictment suggests that Andersen may have been motivated to
destroy documents to cover up its own accounting mistakes in handling
Enron's books, an allegation Andersen vehemently denies.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen could face a maximum fine of $500,000 and five years'
probation.</TE>
<TE>   But the greater harm will come from the blow to the firm's reputation
and the continued exodus of clients.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen attorneys accused government prosecutors of stretching the
legal definition of obstruction of justice and said the firm did not
receive enough credit for voluntarily disclosing the shredding in the
first place. Much of the government's indictment is based upon Andersen's
internal investigation of the shredding, which was provided to
prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   According to a portion of the internal report obtained by The Times,
Andersen partner David B. Duncan and other Houston-based partners met
Oct. 23--the day after Enron restated its earnings and revealed the SEC
inquiry--and ordered the destruction of 26 trunks and 26 boxes of Enron
papers during a three-day period.</TE>
<TE>   "The most intense destruction activity occurred at a time when there
should at least have been serious questions whether the policy allowed
destruction," the report concluded.</TE>
<TE>   The report also blames Duncan and other Houston managers for ordering
the shredding in the Portland and London offices. It said the destruction
of documents in Chicago was routine and minimal.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan has denied any wrong-doing, saying he was following orders from
the Chicago headquarters, including an Oct. 12 e-mail from Andersen
attorney Nancy Temple reminding employees about the company's document
retention and destruction policy.</TE>
<TE>   Vince DiBlasi, an attorney for Duncan, declined to comment on the
specifics of the report Thursday, but said Duncan "is continuing to
cooperate with all ongoing investigations."</TE>
<TE>Additional Charges Still a Possibility</TE>
<TE>   Andersen also complained that the government refused to let the
company present its own evidence to the grand jury, and insisted that
there was no evidence that either the company or its employees acted with
willful criminal intent.</TE>
<TE>   The lawyers said that in negotiations with the firm prosecutors
primarily had been seeking an admission of guilt from the company. Some
observers had speculated that the Justice Department would seek to use a
plea arrangement to extract evidence against Enron, but Andersen
attorneys said the desire for such evidence did not appear to be a
"centerpiece" of the negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen lawyers said they now will seek to force the Justice
Department to identify the Andersen partners who prosecutors believe had
the "criminal intent" needed to convict under the obstruction law. They
said they also will seek to have the indictment dismissed and, failing
that, a speedy trial.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson said Thursday that additional criminal charges against
Andersen and its employees are still a possibility. The department also
is pursuing a much larger inquiry into Enron and its executives.</TE>
<TE>   By rejecting a plea, Andersen essentially dared the Justice Department
to serve the indictment on the partnership, legal experts say. But
attorneys predict Andersen will have a difficult time defending itself at
trial, given its admission that the shredding took place. Legal experts
say a plea agreement is still considered more likely than a trial.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen may be trying to buy more time to pursue one of a narrowing
list of potential survival strategies, including a sale of partnership
assets or a bankruptcy filing to shield itself from creditors, experts
said.</TE>
<TE>   Forcing the Justice Department to serve the indictment also allows
Andersen to avoid, at least temporarily, triggering a securities rule
that could block the firm from auditing public companies. Under SEC
rules, any entity convicted of a serious crime is banned from practicing
public securities work, including signing off on audits of public
companies.</TE>
<TE>SEC Could Seek to Bar Andersen</TE>
<TE>   The SEC, which also is investigating Andersen and Enron, could still
seek to bar Andersen from the auditing business. But that process could
take months longer than it would have if the company had admitted guilt
under a plea agreement this week.</TE>
<TE>   "Quite possibly, Andersen knows it doesn't have a prayer, but it's
timing the decision of when it will be found guilty," said John C.
Coffee, a professor at Columbia University's law school.</TE>
<TE>   Until Wednesday, Andersen attorneys apparently had held out hope of
reaching a global settlement with the Justice Department and the SEC in
which the company could plead guilty but receive a waiver from the SEC
rules or some other limited penalty. It previously offered to pay as much
as $750 million to Enron shareholders and other creditors.</TE>
<TE>   A Wednesday letter from Andersen to the Justice Department indicates
it would be willing to accept SEC sanctions as long as they were largely
directed at its Houston office. Andersen also offered to appoint a
special monitor to oversee its compliance with a new document retention
policy and to fire all individuals involved in the shredding.</TE>
<TE>   But a waiver would place the SEC in an awkward position because the
agency just last year censured Andersen for its handling of the finances
of another company, Waste Management Inc., and won an injunction barring
the firm from future wrongdoing. That settlement put pressure on the SEC
to impose a harsh punishment on Andersen in the Enron case, analysts
said.</TE>
<TE>SEC Approves Emergency Measure</TE>
<TE>   The indictment may have far-reaching implications for Andersen's 2,300
publicly traded audit clients, many of whom have annual financial reports
due to the SEC by the end of the month.</TE>
<TE>   In an apparently unprecedented move, the commission approved emergency
measures Thursday that would allow Andersen clients to file unaudited
financial statements if they are "unable to receive services from
Andersen to complete their audits or ... choose not to have Andersen
complete audits that are currently in process."</TE>
<TE>   The agency also said, however, that it has "received assurances from
Andersen that it will continue to audit financial statements" and will
advise the SEC immediately if it becomes unable to do so.</TE>
<TE>   "The relief for clients of Andersen is intended to minimize disruption
to the U.S. capital markets and the affected issuers," SEC Chairman
Harvey Pitt said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen joins a handful of other companies that have faced
obstruction of justice charges in recent years.</TE>
<TE>Similar Charges for Other Companies</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, Moody's Investors Service Inc., a credit-rating firm,
pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice after it was discovered that an
employee had destroyed documents that had been subpoenaed by federal
prosecutors in an antitrust investigation.</TE>
<TE>   In that case, Moody's paid a $195,000 fine for failing to notify the
government about the destruction, even though senior executives knew
about it, or should have known about it.</TE>
<TE>   Other corporations that have been charged with obstruction of justice
in recent years include Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., which pleaded
guilty and paid $9 million in fines in an ocean dumping probe, and Ortho
Pharmaceutical Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson that
persuaded employees to destroy documents relating to a federal
investigation of the drug firm's Retin-A. Ortho paid $7.5 million in
fines.</TE>

<HD>Voice for Israel's Enemy</HD>
<DH>Jewish journalist Amira Hass lives under Palestinian rule. Some see
her as a traitor for presenting the views of the 'other side.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJORIE MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>Three types of journalists crammed into the living room with the
mourning mother of a suicide bomber: Palestinian reporters, the foreign
press and Amira Hass.</LD>
<LD>   While others peppered Wasfiyeh Idris with questions about her dead
daughter, Hass held back. She spoke in quiet Arabic with friends of Wafa
Idris, the first female suicide bomber in the Palestinian uprising, and
took discreet notes in Hebrew.</LD>
<LD>   "I didn't immediately tell them I am an Israeli," Hass said. "It
wasn't for security; it was because I didn't want to change the course of
events. Whenever they hear I am an Israeli or Jewish, either they become
more polite or tougher. I prefer to listen to others and not to be a
player."</LD>
<TE>   A reporter and columnist for the daily newspaper Haaretz, Hass is the
only Israeli Jew known to be living under Palestinian rule and one of a
handful of Jewish reporters who still cross enemy lines for the Israeli
media. As such, she is widely read in Israeli political circles, if not
always admired.</TE>
<TE>   Hass says her beat is the "Israeli occupation." She chronicles
Israel's recent military thrusts into Ramallah and West Bank refugee
camps. She records the lives of ordinary Palestinians as they struggle
with checkpoints and the army's demolition of houses and farms. She
illustrates the day-to-day impact of Israel's economic chokehold on
Palestinian territories. In short, she provides an unrelenting account of
Palestinians as the victims of Israeli domination.</TE>
<TE>   In doing so, Hass is celebrated by some Israelis as a national
conscience and condemned by others as an ideologue or even a traitor.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a war of dueling narratives about
who is the aggressor, who is the victim and who is the rightful heir to
the land. To supporters, Hass provides a necessary alternative to the
government's version of events in the bloody battle. But by presenting
the Palestinian point of view, she is seen by some Israelis as arming the
enemy.</TE>
<TE>   "In a direct way, she is justifying what she calls the Palestinian
struggle. She is justifying the way they butcher us every day," said
Nadav Haetzni, a columnist for the newspaper Maariv who opposes the
creation of a Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   Yisrael Medad, former director of the right-of-center Israel's Media
Watch, said Hass has adopted the position of "the other side" and should
not be writing news.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know whether psychologically she is being held hostage, but
definitely a Stockholm syndrome of identifying with the enemy is
apparent," Medad said. "If there is shooting from [the West Bank city of]
Ramallah into [the neighboring Jewish settlement of] Psagot, she will
never go into Psagot to see what the shots did."</TE>
<TE>   Hass responds that many Israeli reporters cover Israelis who are
victims of the 17-month intifada, or uprising, as well as their
government's account of what the Palestinian Authority does. She says
Israelis do not get enough information about what their government and
army are doing in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   "Journalism is not about telling people what they like to hear. . . .
The task of journalists is to monitor power and, in the relations between
Israelis and Palestinians, Israel is certainly the center of power," Hass
said.</TE>
<TE>   She conceded that "nobody would go live in occupied territory without
an ideology against occupation," but she rejected the idea that this
disqualified her as an observer. "By the same token, any Israeli
journalist who has been a soldier, who used to be in military
intelligence or who is in the reserves should be dismissed. There's no
end to it."</TE>
<TE>   Military service is obligatory in Israel, and many military or
national security reporters are former members of intelligence units.</TE>
<TE>   Hass, 45, was born in Jerusalem to Eastern European parents, militant
Communists and Holocaust survivors who raised her on what she called
"epics of resistance." She has written that she was haunted by her
mother's memory of German women watching from the sidelines while
prisoners were herded into concentration camps and decided "that my place
was not with the bystanders."</TE>
<TE>A 1993 Move to Gaza--the Lion's Den</TE>
<TE>   So Hass moved to Gaza City in 1993, a step her Israeli friends
considered crazy if not downright suicidal. To most Israelis, Gaza
was--and is--the lion's den, a pit of destitute Palestinians bent on the
destruction of Israel.</TE>
<TE>   From Gaza, she covered the Israeli army's withdrawal in 1994 after the
signing of the 1993 Oslo peace accords, and the Palestinians' early
optimism and then gradual desperation as the agreement failed to deliver
freedom and statehood. She wrote of her experiences in "Drinking the Sea
at Gaza: Days and Nights in a Land Under Siege" before moving to Ramallah
in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Whether they agree with Hass' definition of journalism, most people
who are familiar with her work acknowledge that she is taking great
risks. She lives alone in Ramallah, where a mob lynched two Israeli
soldiers in October 2000. When Israeli tanks and troops stormed the city
this week, she moved to a friend's house to be closer to the combat. She
does not need a translator and frequently works by herself in refugee
camps, at demonstrations and in other potentially hostile situations.</TE>
<TE>   After a decade covering the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Hass is well
known to officials in the Palestinian Authority and to leaders of armed
groups, such as Hamas and the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, that attack Israelis. But ordinary Palestinian rock throwers
and Molotov bomb makers--the street fighters who feel that they have
nothing to lose--do not necessarily know Hass or what she writes,
increasing her risk.</TE>
<TE>   She wears modest clothes and has an unaggressive manner when working
among Palestinians. She listens to them intently, as if by that very act
she can somehow compensate for decades of miscommunication. She is less
likely to be suspected of spying for Israel's General Security Service
than a man might be. But still, she spends her time exploring the
recesses of a heavily armed society at war with her country. She would be
an easy target for the men--and now, perhaps, women--willing to die to
kill Israelis. More important, as the siege of the Palestinian
territories tightens, she is more accessible than most Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   Hass does not like to discuss the risks, saying only that there have
been two or three incidents in which she was seriously threatened and
that in each case people came to her rescue.</TE>
<TE>   But her Israeli colleagues testify to the danger of covering the
Palestinian territories during the uprising. About 1,400 people, the
majority of them Palestinians, have died in the violence.</TE>
<TE>   "Before this intifada, an Israeli journalist was generally welcomed by
the Palestinians. Even if I wanted to talk to Hamas leaders, I felt
secure," said Yoram Binur of Channel 2 television. "I used to do my work
in Ramallah, then have lunch or dinner there to talk to real people and
get the atmosphere. Now I do the work and run."</TE>
<TE>   Gideon Levy, a colleague of Hass at Haaretz, says he also seeks to
tell the story of the Israeli occupation, in a weekly column called
"Twilight Zone." He still dips in and out of the Palestinian territories,
but visits fewer and fewer places.</TE>
<TE>   "I risk my life every week. Amira risks her life every day," Levy
said.</TE>
<TE>   But for what are they risking their lives? That is a question asked by
many Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   Haaretz is the smallest of three major Israeli dailies, with a midweek
circulation of about 70,000, compared with 400,000 for Yediot Aharonot
and 220,000 for Maariv. Haaretz is also the most left-wing daily in an
increasingly conservative country. Some critics argue that Hass and Levy
simply preach to the choir, to a small group of highly educated elites
who believe that the creation of a Palestinian state is the way the two
peoples will live in peace.</TE>
<TE>   Even some Israelis who share Hass' political views find her accounts
of Palestinian suffering predictable. Whether it is because they are
painful, painstakingly repetitive or perceived to be self-righteous, the
articles are too much for many Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   Government spokesman Raanan Gissin dismisses Hass' work as "writing
under the gun"--exercising self-censorship to remain on the ground. Many
media critics and opinion makers, however, say she and Levy make a unique
contribution to Israeli journalism.</TE>
<TE>   "I know they're not going to tell me about a soldier who was humane at
the roadblock because it doesn't fit. It is a waste of paper to them,"
said Uri Dromi, who served as spokesman for the late Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin. "But bad things happen in wars, and we should know about
them. Then we make up our minds when we are informed rather than
ill-informed."</TE>
<TE>   Hass interviewed an Israeli soldier last fall who revealed that the
army had forbidden sharpshooters to target children but that it defined
children as those younger than 12. "Twelve and up is allowed. He's not a
child anymore," the sharpshooter said. "That's what they tell us."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Hass went back to the house where she had met Idris'
mother to cover another wake, this one for a 15-year-old boy killed in
the combat.</TE>
<TE>   In other articles, she has given blow-by-blow accounts of the army's
demolition of a Palestinian building in Al Birah and a look at
Palestinians whose house was leveled in Rafah. She spent a day at an army
checkpoint in Al Birah during a closure, recording the haggling,
supplication and defeat of Palestinians trying to get out.</TE>
<TE>   One recent afternoon, she spent hours listening to the Palestinian
leaders of neighborhoods that fall within the annexed boundaries of
Jerusalem but are beyond the outermost army checkpoint in the city. One
by one, they told her how they pay city taxes and telephone bills but
cannot get services because workers and repair crews say it is too
dangerous to come into their neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Levy, meanwhile, has reported on the deaths of two Palestinian
newborns whose pregnant mothers were barred by soldiers from going
through checkpoints to get to the hospital. In one of his most
controversial pieces, he interviewed the Palestinian police chief in
Ramallah after the two Israeli soldiers were lynched at the police
headquarters. He gave the commander's account of what happened to an
Israeli public with no more stomach for explanations than Americans had
after the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Hass and Levy have cost Haaretz "a few dozen" subscriptions, according
to Managing Editor Yoel Esteron.</TE>
<TE>Media Seen as Siding With Palestinian Cause</TE>
<TE>   Israel Harel, an advocate for Jewish settlers in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip and a fellow columnist at Haaretz, refuses to discuss his
colleagues except to say that he believes that most of the Israeli media
side "with the Palestinians' cause." By way of example, he says that they
have adopted the Palestinian term "Al Aqsa intifada" for the uprising
that began after Ariel Sharon, then an opposition politician and now
prime minister, paid a visit to the Al Aqsa mosque area of Jerusalem with
a contingent of heavily armed security guards.</TE>
<TE>   "I consider this a war of terror," Harel said. "Once the press calls
it by the name they want it to be called, their cause is more right than
our cause."</TE>
<TE>   Language is a weapon in all wars, and no less so in the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The West Bank, which Israel captured in
1967, is called Judea and Samaria by those Israelis who claim that they
have a biblical right to it. Hard-line Palestinians who do not recognize
Israel's right to exist call the Jewish state the "Zionist entity."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians call suicide bombers shahid, or martyr, while Israelis
call the killings that the army carries out "targeted preventions."</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army speaks of closures and curfews, but former Rabin
spokesman Dromi considers them sterile words that do not relate to events
on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   That's where Hass comes in.</TE>
<TE>   "Amira tells Israelis what lies behind the words," he said.</TE>

<HD>EgyptAir Co-Pilot Caused '99 Jet Crash, NTSB to Say</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Sources say final report won't call action criminal but
will cite 'black box' evidence of an intentional act.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<AU>WILLIAM C. REMPEL</AU>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The final federal report on the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990 is
expected to say that the jumbo jet was brought down by the methodical,
determined acts of a veteran co-pilot, sources close to investigators
have told The Times.</LD>
<LD>   The report by the National Transportation Safety Board, anticipated
within a few days, will close the probe into an air disaster on Oct. 31,
1999, off the New England coast that killed 217 people and has strained
relations between the United States and Egypt, a key Arab ally.</LD>
<LD>   Central to the NTSB findings is incriminating evidence in the plane's
two "black box" recording devices against co-pilot Gamil El Batouty,
whose personal and professional life appears to have been crumbling in
the months before the crash.</LD>
<TE>   But what the report omits may be more controversial, including
implications of suicide and even murder.</TE>
<TE>   "What it won't do is talk about motivation," said one source familiar
with the findings. "It won't use words like 'deliberate' or
'intentional.' And I can guarantee it won't use 'suicide.' "</TE>
<TE>   The NTSB report also will stop short of considering allegations by a
former EgyptAir captain that one of Batouty's motivations may have been
revenge and murder.</TE>
<TE>   How the Boeing 767 crashed--plunging 33,000 feet through clear skies
without so much as a distress call--was almost immediately clear. But
investigators were increasingly frustrated as they tried to establish why
Batouty nosed the plane over into a dive, repeatedly intoning in Arabic,
"I rely on God."</TE>
<TE>   Former EgyptAir Capt. Hanofy Taha Mahmoud Hamdy told The Times that
the crash was a vengeful act against an EgyptAir executive. Taha said
that Hatem Rushdy, chief of the Boeing 767 pilot group who was a
passenger on the ill-fated New York-to-Cairo flight, had reprimanded the
co-pilot for sexual misconduct that embarrassed the company.</TE>
<TE>   Taha said the chief pilot told Batouty he would not be allowed to fly
the U.S. route again. The co-pilot's decision to crash the plane "was a
matter of revenge," Taha said.</TE>
<TE>   "Rushdy had said [to him], 'This is your last flight,' " Taha said.
"And Batouty's attitude was, 'This is the last flight for all of you
too.' "</TE>
<TE>   A high-ranking American official in the investigation, who asked not
to be named, agreed. "It was more revenge against Rushdy than just a
suicide," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Federal investigators looking into the co-pilot's personal background
said they have been frustrated by EgyptAir's refusal to cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   "It's because of politics," said Bernard Loeb, who recently retired as
head of the NTSB's aviation safety office, after supervising much of the
Flight 990 investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The importance of support from the regime of Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak in America's fight against Islamic terrorism has made the White
House reluctant to press for more cooperation, investigative sources
said.</TE>
<TE>   Egyptian officials have complained angrily about a rush to judgment.
They argued determinedly, despite a lack of supporting evidence, that
there must have been something wrong with the 767. The pilots, they said,
were devout Muslims, and no devout Muslim would commit suicide.</TE>
<TE>   The report will take a "straight up" approach, a federal official
said. "It will simply say the first officer did this and this and this.
There is no indication that a [mechanical] condition on the airplane
resulted in the crash."</TE>
<TE>   In one of its most chilling findings, the report will conclude that
Batouty and Capt. Ahmed El Habashi were working the controls in opposite
directions during the final frantic seconds of the fatal dive. Habashi
tried to bring the plane's nose up. Batouty pushed just as hard in the
other direction.</TE>
<TE>   Egyptian authorities will withhold comment until the report is
officially released, said a source representing Egyptian aviation
interests. American aviation officials say the Egyptians may issue their
own formal response, likely to allege problems with the Boeing 767.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators, however, say the emphasis should not be on the plane,
which apparently functioned perfectly, but instead on Batouty, a co-pilot
just three months short of the mandatory retirement age of 60.</TE>
<TE>   In more than two dozen interviews with investigators, aviation sources
and former and current EgyptAir employees, including Taha, who had never
before spoken publicly, The Times pieced together a posthumous portrait
of Batouty and a detailed account of the crash of Flight 990. It also
obtained information from hundreds of pages of NTSB documents and police
and FBI reports.</TE>
<TE>   Once a highly regarded training officer with the Egyptian air force,
he was humiliated by the loss of respect that came with his acceptance of
a secondary role as a co-pilot with the civilian airline, Taha said.</TE>
<TE>   Transcripts of interviews conducted by federal investigators said
Batouty's second-echelon position, unusual for a pilot his age, had
restricted his income at a time when he was beset by increasing financial
pressures stemming, in part, from his daughter's long-term illness.</TE>
<TE>   His image as a faithful husband and devout Muslim were tarnished by
continuing accusations of sexual improprieties that included exposing
himself to teenage girls, propositioning hotel maids and stalking female
hotel guests, the transcripts and police reports show.</TE>
<TE>   A few hours before the crash, Rushdy, the senior EgyptAir
supervisorial pilot, told Batouty that, because of his sexual misconduct,
he would be banned on transatlantic flights to the United States,
according to Taha.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. flights carry prestige and additional pay because of their
length.</TE>
<TE>   Outwardly, Batouty still seemed an easygoing family man, Taha said.
But Taha and other colleagues interviewed by investigators said that
under a veneer of normality lurked a life of quiet desperation.</TE>
<TE>Seeking Asylum</TE>
<TE>   Taha, who was interviewed in London, where he sought asylum because he
feared retribution from Egyptian authorities for speaking to U.S.
officials after the crash, made sweeping accusations of widespread
immorality and corruption among those who run EgyptAir, which is owned by
the Egyptian government.</TE>
<TE>   Egyptian aviation officials dismiss him as an antigovernment Muslim
fanatic.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials, apparently reluctant to say anything on the record
that might rupture relations with the Mubarak government, said they would
not comment publicly. However, transcripts of FBI interviews show that
many of the questions agents asked Egyptian officials were based on what
Taha had told them.</TE>
<TE>   During nine hours of interviews with The Times, Taha provided detailed
accounts from inside EgyptAir during the early weeks of the Flight 990
investigation. He said he knew Batouty well.</TE>
<TE>   Taha and investigative transcripts gave this account of the hours
before the plane's departure from John F. Kennedy International Airport
in New York:</TE>
<TE>   As Batouty rode to the airport in a van shortly before midnight Oct.
30, he was accompanied by a number of other EgyptAir personnel, including
Rushdy, a man described by Taha as the personification of Batouty's
problems.</TE>
<TE>   Because of its length, Flight 990 carried two full crews. Capt. Ahmed
El Habashi, 57, and First Officer Adel Anwar, 38, were scheduled to
handle the takeoff, the first five hours of the flight and the landing in
Cairo. Capt. Nour El Din Sayed, 52, and First Officer Batouty were
scheduled to fly the less demanding "cruise" portion of the flight over
the mid-Atlantic.</TE>
<TE>   Rushdy, who hours earlier had reprimanded Batouty and told him he
would not fly to the U.S. again, was among several EgyptAir personnel
seated in the first-class section. Bautouty sat there too, awaiting his
turn in the cockpit.</TE>
<TE>   With Habashi and Anwar at the controls, Flight 990 lifted off a JFK
runway at 1:20 a.m. Oct. 31 and made a routine climb toward cruise
altitude. Transcripts show radio conversations between the cockpit crew
and air traffic controllers were similarly routine, with no indication of
any problems.</TE>
<TE>   Not long after takeoff, Rushdy visited the cockpit, according to a
transcript of the cockpit voice recording recovered from the wreckage. He
chatted with the cruise crew about flight procedures.</TE>
<TE>   As Rushdy left the cockpit, Batouty entered.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Gamil [Batouty] had been looking at the door, looking at the
moment when Rushdy is out of the cockpit," Taha said. "This is the most
suitable moment to fulfill what he is going to do."</TE>
<TE>   Batouty suggested he take over the co-pilot seat immediately,
according to a translated transcript of the Arabic conversations in the
cockpit.</TE>
<TE>   Anwar objected, but Batouty persisted.</TE>
<TE>   "You will get up," he told the younger man, according to the
transcript. "Go and get some rest and come back."</TE>
<TE>   Anwar complained but left the cockpit after a couple of minutes.
Batouty took his seat.</TE>
<TE>   At 1:48 a.m., as the plane cruised at 33,000 feet beyond the eastern
tip of Long Island, Habashi left to use the toilet. The cockpit voice
recorder picked up the sound of the door closing behind him.</TE>
<TE>   Batouty was alone in the cockpit.</TE>
<TE>   In the next 20 seconds, as the plane continued to fly normally, the
recorder picked up several unintelligible words before a voice said
faintly, "I rely on God." In the moments that followed, the recorder
picked up thumping noises.</TE>
<TE>   Taha, a Muslim, said Batouty probably was offering a Muslim prayer,
bowing, crossing his arms, tapping his knees with his hands and thumping
his feet on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   "He is preparing himself, as he would if he were to be executed," Taha
said. "He's asking God to support him to finish his mission."</TE>
<TE>   A few seconds later, the man at the controls disengaged the plane's
automatic pilot, according to readings from the flight data recorder,
which was the second "black box" recording device salvaged from the
wreckage. The recorder indicated that there was nothing wrong, at any
time, with any of the plane's mechanical and control systems.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, the voice in the cockpit repeated, "I rely on God."</TE>
<TE>   An instant later, the engines were throttled back and the control yoke
was pushed forward, putting the twin-engine jet into a steep dive.</TE>
<TE>   During the next two minutes, as the plane hurtled nose-first toward
the ocean, a voice in the cockpit repeated those same words seven more
times: "I rely on God."</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, despite zero-gravity conditions from the dive that must have
made movements extremely difficult, Habashi, a large man with arthritic
knees and an ailing back, managed to clamber back into the cockpit.</TE>
<TE>   "What's happening, Gamil?" he shouted, according to the voice
recorder. "What's happening?"</TE>
<TE>   Batouty's only answer was those same words: "I rely on God." An
instant later, he shut off the fuel supply to both engines.</TE>
<TE>   "What is this?" Habashi yelled in apparent disbelief. "What is this?
Did you shut the engines?"</TE>
<TE>   In the seconds that followed, the flight data recorder showed an
abnormal configuration of the plane's elevators, sections of the
wing-like structure in the tail that pitch the plane up and down.</TE>
<TE>   The two halves of the elevator, one on either side of the tail's
vertical fin, normally move in tandem, but the recorder indicated that
they were moving in opposite directions.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators say this could only mean one thing: One of the pilots
was pushing forward on the control yoke, trying to keep the plane
plunging toward the sea. The other was pulling back on the yoke, trying
to pull the plane out of the dive.</TE>
<TE>   "Pull with me!" Habashi shouted. "Pull with me! Pull with me!"</TE>
<TE>   At that moment, both the flight data recorder and cockpit voice
recorder went dead, presumably because of a loss of electrical power
brought on by the shutdown of the engines.</TE>
<TE>Breakup of Plane</TE>
<TE>   Radar data show that the plane flew on for almost two minutes more,
climbing several thousand feet before dipping nose-first once again. The
data show that it began to break up, likely from stresses of the dive,
before dropping into the sea.</TE>
<TE>   No one can be sure about what happened during those final two minutes,
but veteran pilots agree on two things:</TE>
<TE>   * Nothing that Batouty apparently did at the controls before the
recorder blackout--shutting off the autopilot, pushing forward on the
yoke, shutting down the engines--makes any sense unless he was
deliberately crashing the plane.</TE>
<TE>   * Habashi's reaction--pulling back on the yoke--was the logical
response of a flight captain attempting to save his plane.</TE>
<TE>   Taha said that as soon as the "black box" transcripts were available
to investigators, Hassam Mushrafa, EgyptAir's chief of operations,
summoned all crew members in Cairo to a special meeting at headquarters.
About 50 attended.</TE>
<TE>   Taha said he attended and realized the crash was no accident.</TE>
<TE>   He said Mushrafa emphasized that his information was confidential, not
to be shared outside the room: " 'Don't talk to each other. Don't talk to
your families. Don't talk on the telephones about this.' "</TE>
<TE>   Mushrafa then ran through the series of events depicted by the cockpit
voice recorder and flight data recorder, Taha said. The account he heard
matches information later released by the NTSB.</TE>
<TE>   Taha said Mushrafa never used the words "deliberate" or "suicide" but
that every pilot in the room understood the importance of what Mushrafa
was saying: Batouty had crashed the plane on purpose.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph P. Kreindler, an attorney for the families of several of the
victims, said he took a deposition from an EgyptAir engineer who
participated in the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked him, is there any evidence of a mechanical defect?" Kreindler
said. "He said no."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the lack of official Egyptian cooperation, investigators
learned a lot about Batouty, much of it through interviews with pilots.</TE>
<TE>   Their reports show:</TE>
<TE>   He was born in Egypt on Feb. 2, 1940, the son of a prosperous
landowner who served as mayor of a town on the outskirts of Cairo.</TE>
<TE>   Interested in flying from his youth, Batouty earned his wings from the
Egypt Air Institute before joining the Egyptian air force, rising within
a decade to the rank of major.</TE>
<TE>   "He liked the military and he was highly regarded and successful,"
said a good friend and fellow EgyptAir pilot, Mohamed Badrawi. "But the
needs of the air force changed, and they let him go."</TE>
<TE>   Batouty returned to the air institute as a teacher, eventually
becoming the institute's chief instructor. In that capacity, he trained
many of the men with whom he would later fly, often as a subordinate, at
EgyptAir.</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, he joined EgyptAir as a Boeing 737 co-pilot. Because of his
long stay at the institute, he was older than most others of similar
rank.</TE>
<TE>   When the opportunity for advancement came, he refused to take the
required tests. At 59, an age when all his peers were captains, Batouty
was still a first officer at half their pay.</TE>
<TE>   Taha said Batouty pretended not to mind being a second in command.
"But he really did care, of course."</TE>
<TE>   To cover up his lack of rank, he wore a sweater to cover his sleeve,
which showed only three stripes instead of four, Taha said. "And he never
wore his cap, which would have revealed he wasn't a captain."</TE>
<TE>   Badrawi said Batouty didn't take the promotion tests because he lacked
ambition and because his skills in English--used in air traffic control
facilities throughout the world--were mediocre.</TE>
<TE>   In light of these deficiencies, Badrawi said, Batouty's fitness as a
co-pilot was considered "low average."</TE>
<TE>   But because his family was prosperous and politically connected and
because of his long service as an instructor, the veteran co-pilot was
given special privileges, including the lucrative flights to the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   Taha and Badrawi said these flights were important to Batouty because
his teenage daughter suffered from lupus, an illness requiring costly
treatments at the UCLA Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the prosperity of his relatives and the fact that he owned two
comfortable homes, Batouty was running short of cash. Badrawi said
Batouty borrowed $6,000 from the airline, $2,500 from the pilots' union
and $1,000 from Badrawi.</TE>
<TE>   Despite these financial problems, Batouty still seemed calm and
untroubled, according to several fellow pilots interviewed by the FBI.
But others, including Medhat El Keddah, said they perceived a quieter,
more somber Batouty.</TE>
<TE>   "I kept asking him what was wrong," Keddah said.</TE>
<TE>   About six months before the crash, security personnel at the
Pennsylvania Hotel, where EgyptAir pilots stay in New York between
flights, started hearing complaints about Batouty's behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Some teenage girls said he stood naked at the window of a room across
from theirs and masturbated in full view, according to FBI reports. A
hotel maid said he had offered her wine, money and chocolate in exchange
for sex, the reports said.</TE>
<TE>   A desk clerk told the FBI that Batouty had tried to pick up women in
the lobby, and when he failed, followed them to their rooms and listened
at their doors. The FBI report said that on one occasion a woman agreed
to meet him, but their tryst failed because he forgot her room number.</TE>
<TE>   The hotel complained to EgyptAir, and the FBI report said Batouty
conceded to a clerk, "I may be in trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Even Badrawi, often Batouty's staunchest apologist and defender,
acknowledged that the veteran co-pilot may have been in hot water. "No
matter how much you are respectable," Badrawi told the FBI, "if you make
a mistake, you can suddenly become unrespectable."</TE>
<TE>   Although EgyptAir officials deny it, Taha said that the night before

It was during that meeting, Taha said, that Batouty was stripped of his

<HD>A Deal Averts Face-Off in India</HD>
<DH>Religion: Hindu leader agrees to hold service away from site of
razed mosque, reducing the threat of more violence.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>AYODHYA, India
</DL>
<LD>A local official and the 92-year-old leader of a nationalist
movement to build a Hindu temple on the site of a demolished mosque
reached a last-minute compromise today that was expected to avert a
confrontation with heavily armed police.</LD>
<LD>   Before the agreement, the Hindu holy man, Ramchandra Das Paramhans,
sought the advice of his doctor and divine inspiration Thursday as he
prepared to challenge police roadblocks.</LD>
<LD>   Das had told disciples in this northern Indian town that he would lead
a procession this afternoon toward the site of a mosque demolished by a
Hindu mob nearly a decade ago and would try to lay symbolic claim to it.</LD>
<TE>   But today, he agreed to a peaceful procession to a spot about 650
yards from the site.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, there is no formal compromise as such, but Ramchandra Das
Paramhans has agreed to donate a shila [a carved temple stone] outside
the disputed area, which doesn't violate the honorable Supreme Court's
judgment," Anil Kumar Gupta, the local administrator in charge of the
region, said in an interview this morning. Gupta added that he had
permission from state and local governments to accept the plan.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, India's Supreme Court banned any religious ceremonies on
a 67-acre site that includes the ruins of the 16th century mosque, whose
destruction in December 1992 sparked nationwide violence that killed more
than 2,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, more than 650 people, most of them Muslims, died in
communal violence in the western state of Gujarat after a Muslim mob set
fire to a train carrying Hindu activists from Ayodhya. The blaze killed
58 passengers.</TE>
<TE>   Hindu nationalists claim that the site is the birthplace of Lord Rama,
an incarnation of the god Vishnu, and want to build a temple there.</TE>
<TE>   Police detained at least 100 supporters of the Ram temple movement
this morning, mostly young men, who were bused away from Ayodhya
chanting, "Long live Lord Rama!" But the town remained calm.</TE>
<TE>   Gupta told an Indian television network Thursday that he would allow
Das and his followers to carry the shila in the vicinity as long as they
abide by the court order to stay away from the site where the mosque
stood.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders from across India's broad political and religious spectrum had
pleaded for Das to back down from the confrontation in Ayodhya, where
about 2,000 of his followers threatened to provoke clashes that could
spread across a nation of 1 billion people.</TE>
<TE>   Das sat cloistered in a small, windowless room Thursday evening, and
his doctor checked his blood pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Monkeys playfully scrambled over the corrugated tin roof of the
quarters where Das, guarded by several police officers with rifles, met
with his nephew and secretary. The two disciples held Das under each arm
when he emerged briefly and hobbled to an outdoor toilet.</TE>
<TE>   About 50 Hindu devotees kept constant vigil, milling about or sitting
on red plastic patio chairs as musicians chanted to Rama while they
played cymbals, a harmonium and a tabla next to a ceremonial fire.</TE>
<TE>   The state and federal governments have deployed about 8,000 police and
paramilitary forces, armed with rifles, tear gas and water cannons, to
Ayodhya and have closed off the main routes into town to anyone without
two official permits.</TE>
<TE>   Ayodhya has a population of about 60,000, including the Hindu
pilgrims, and it is now the most heavily policed place in India, with
more than one officer to control every eight people. In the narrow
streets closest to a Hindu stone masons' workshop Thursday evening, there
were more police officers than civilians.</TE>
<TE>   Even without the late agreement, the overwhelming show of police force
probably would have been enough to keep Das and his disciples well away
from the site of the destroyed mosque, or Babri Masjid.</TE>
<TE>   The violence unleashed by the destruction of the Babri Masjid left
wounds in the national psyche that have yet to heal.</TE>
<TE>   The mosque was destroyed after Hindu nationalists were allowed to hold
a prayer ceremony at the site in exchange for assurances that they would
be peaceful.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 140 million Indians are Muslims, and while the majority
of Indians are moderate and tolerant of different religions, communal
tensions are a constant danger.</TE>
<TE>   If authorities fail to keep the peace in Ayodhya, the shock waves
could bring down Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee's government just as
India and Pakistan are locked in a dangerous military standoff on their
border and in the disputed region of Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   Vajpayee already is under fire from smaller parties within his ruling
coalition, and from the opposition Congress Party, because his attorney
general argued in the Supreme Court that proponents of the Hindu temple
should be allowed to pray next to the site of the demolished mosque.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court rejected that proposal, and Vajpayee vowed to
enforce the court's judgment even though it put the prime minister at
odds with some of his strongest political supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Ayodhya is in the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous
state and a political stronghold of Vajpayee's Hindu nationalist
Bharatiya Janata Party until the group suffered a humiliating loss in
elections last month.</TE>
<TE>   The BJP controlled the state government when the mob demolished the
mosque in 1992, and the Congress Party federal government at the time
blamed state officials for allowing it to happen.</TE>
<TE>   In February 1993, a 122-page federal government report held Uttar
Pradesh's then-chief minister, Kalyan Singh, a BJP leader, responsible
for the mosque's demolition and said he apparently ordered local police
and officials not to intervene.</TE>
<TE>   The BJP responded with a report of its own, which trumpeted extremist
Hindu views that the moderate Vajpayee has worked hard to quiet, at least
in public.</TE>

<HD>Yugoslavia No More, Say Its Republics</HD>
<DH>Balkans: EU-backed plan creates a looser union with a different
name and an exit clause.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SKOPJE, Macedonia
</DL>
<LD>Leaders of Serbia and Montenegro agreed Thursday to a landmark
reform of their relationship, abandoning the name Yugoslavia and giving
Montenegro more autonomy in order to avoid a messy independence fight.</LD>
<LD>   The deal, sought by the European Union and brokered personally by EU
foreign policy chief Javier Solana, creates two essentially independent
states connected in a loose union from which either one can withdraw
after three years. Under the agreement, the new entity will be called
Serbia and Montenegro. The two republics currently make up the nation of
Yugoslavia.</LD>
<LD>   The goal, in part, was to avoid a referendum on Montenegro's
independence, for fear that it would set a regional precedent. The
majority ethnic Albanian population in the province of Kosovo would like
to secede from Serbia; and in the neighboring nation of Macedonia, many
ethnic Albanians similarly would like to break away.</LD>
<TE>   "This is an important day and a step toward the stability in the
region and in Europe," Solana said at a news conference in Belgrade, the
Yugoslav and Serbian capital, where the agreement was signed by Yugoslav
President Vojislav Kostunica and Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic.</TE>
<TE>   But the accord also signaled the formal end of the nation of
Yugoslavia. Established in 1918, the country rose to become a progressive
communist state, only to transmogrify into a nation identified with
genocide, brutality and the most backward of policies. Before it began to
disintegrate 12 years ago, though, the nation was admired for its
multiethnic identity.</TE>
<TE>   Yugoslavia means land of south Slavs, and it was home to all the Slavs
in the Balkans except Bulgarians. For decades, it was a rare example of
the peaceful coexistence of at least six ethnic groups--Serbs, Croats,
Slovenes, Albanians, Hungarians and Macedonians. Under Marshal Josip Broz
Tito, Yugoslavia was viewed as one of the most liberal of the communist
states, balancing central economic controls with some intellectual
freedoms.</TE>
<TE>   However, almost from its inception, it had a history of dictatorship.
Early on, it was run by a despotic Serbian king, Alexandar Karadjordjevic
I, later by Tito and most recently by Serbian strongman Slobodan
Milosevic, who is now standing trial on war crimes charges.</TE>
<TE>   "People in Serbia regretted when Yugoslavia started crumbling 10 years
ago," said Bratislav Grubacic, a political analyst in Belgrade. "Now we
have to admit there will be no more Yugoslavia after this, not as a name,
not as a country," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Of the six republics that once made up Yugoslavia, Montenegro is the
last to seek independence. In 1991, Croatia, Macedonia and Slovenia broke
away. Then in 1992, Bosnia-Herzegovina sought independence. Bloody wars
marked the separation of both Croatia and Bosnia. Montenegro's
independence drive began with the 1997 election of Djukanovic, who wanted
to distance his tiny republic on the Adriatic coast from the autocratic
rule of Milosevic, who was then Yugoslavia's president.</TE>
<TE>   Djukanovic won support from the West, which saw him as a counterweight
to Milosevic. But after Milosevic's fall last year, Djukanovic pressed on
with his campaign, spurred by supporters in the southern portion of his
republic.</TE>
<TE>   In the north, where many pro-Belgrade Serbs live, Djukanovic
encountered opposition, and the West began to see his press for
independence as a problem. Not only did it create strife within
Montenegro, but it also diverted Belgrade officials' energy away from
desperately needed financial and administrative reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, it risked setting a precedent for other small
independence-minded areas in the Balkans, most notably Kosovo. By
forestalling full independence for Montenegro, the issue of Kosovo
independence is likely to be delayed as well.</TE>
<TE>   Arguing that secession would also hurt Montenegro's economy and slow
down the process of integrating it into mainstream Europe, the EU has
been pushing for a new Yugoslav Constitution that would preserve a joint
Montenegro-Serbia state while granting the two republics greater
self-governance.</TE>
<TE>   Solana reassured the two republics that by signing the agreement, they
would be putting themselves in a better position for EU membership, the
long-term goal of all the Balkan countries. Montenegro and Serbia "should
have no doubt" about the EU's support, Solana said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not the end of anything, but a beginning of a new chapter
that will bring you closer to the European Union."</TE>
<TE>   It is not yet clear whether Montenegrins will accept the deal.
Djukanovic depends on a pro-independence party for his majority in
parliament. If the party deserts him because of dissatisfaction with
Thursday's agreement, it could cause the fall of his government and
trigger new elections.</TE>
<TE>   Although the agreement keeps the two republics nominally linked, it
recognizes that Montenegro and Serbia have become all but separate
countries. "This is a legalization of the status quo," said Stojan
Cerovic, a columnist for the leading Belgrade news weekly Vreme.
"Politically, Serbia and Montenegro are one country, but economically
they are two countries."</TE>
<TE>   Although Montenegro has formally been part of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, it has refused to recognize the relationship for the past
several years. Montenegro and Serbia have developed separate tax systems
and separate customs regimes. Montenegro, with a population of about
650,000, uses the euro as its currency; Serbia, with about 10 million
people, uses the Yugoslav dinar.</TE>
<TE>   Under the agreement, Montenegro now will at least acknowledge a loose
common government with Serbia. However, the two republics will continue
to have separate economies, currencies and customs services, and each
will be governed by its own president. They will be linked through a
president of the new union, a unicameral parliament and a council of
ministers.</TE>
<TE>   The new union formally includes Kosovo, run by the United Nations
since a 1999 North Atlantic Treaty Organization bombing campaign against
Yugoslavia in response to Milosevic's brutal crackdown on the province's
ethnic Albanians.</TE>
<TE>   However, analysts believe that the union structure will be weak.</TE>
<TE>   The name change will not take effect until the deal is approved by the
parliaments of both republics as well as the Yugoslav legislature.</TE>

<HD>Bush Proposes Major Boost in Development Aid</HD>
<DH>Policy: Citing a poverty-terror link, the president ties the
$5-billion increase to democratic and other reforms by recipients.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush said Thursday that he will seek $5 billion over
three years in new assistance to developing nations, but to qualify the
countries must root out corruption, demonstrate support for human rights
and promote democratic and economic reforms.</LD>
<LD>   He also linked his aid proposal to the war on terrorism, asserting
that poverty and misery can lead to hopelessness and despair--conditions
that he said can help breed terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   The funding increase, if approved by Congress, would be substantial:
Worldwide, the United States now provides about $17 billion a year in
development aid for education, health, business promotion and other such
programs.</LD>
<TE>   Bush made his announcement at the Inter-American Development Bank
here, and it came a week before he is to join other world leaders in
Monterrey, Mexico, for a United Nations conference on development.</TE>
<TE>   "This growing divide between wealth and poverty, between opportunity
and misery, is both a challenge to our compassion and a source of
instability," Bush said. "We must confront it. We must include every
African, every Asian, every Latin American, every Muslim in an expanding
circle of development."</TE>
<TE>   He also said, "Along with significant new resources to fight world
poverty, we will insist on the reforms necessary to make this a fight we
win."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's funding increase would be "very, very significant," said Carol
Graham, co-director of the Center on Social and Economic Dynamics at the
Brookings Institution.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the traditional Capitol Hill skepticism about foreign aid,
Graham said Bush may have a good chance of getting his request,
particularly if he succeeds in linking such aid to combating terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The president would start the additional funding in the 2004 fiscal
year, which begins Oct. 1, 2003. Several nongovernmental development
agencies, as well as House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.),
called for expediting Bush's proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a breakthrough change of direction, [but] we question why the
money can't be available sooner--poverty is a matter of life and death,"
said Raymond C. Offenheiser, president of Oxfam America, which works to
alleviate global hunger and poverty.</TE>
<TE>   Gephardt agreed with Bush that "more accountability is needed from
recipient governments." But he urged him to "accelerate the timetable . .
. and provide real resources immediately."</TE>
<TE>   Bush also set an admittedly ambitious goal of doubling the economies
of the poorest nations within a decade.</TE>
<TE>   "I know some may say that's too high a hurdle to cross. I don't
believe so--not with the right reforms and the right policy."</TE>
<TE>   Among those who joined the president for his announcement at the
Inter-American Development Bank--which seeks to promote development in
Latin America and the Caribbean--was U2 singer Bono, whose company Bush
evidently enjoyed.</TE>
<TE>   The two spent time in the Oval Office before sharing a ride in the
president's limousine to the event--and then back to the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Bush lauded Bono's work on behalf of developing nations. "He is
willing to use his position in a responsible way. He is willing to lead
to achieve what his heart tells him, and that is nobody, nobody should be
living in poverty and hopelessness in the world."</TE>
<TE>   Bush said he has directed Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill to develop "a set of clear and
concrete and objective criteria" for measuring the progress of recipient
nations on the broad standards he laid out.</TE>
<TE>   "When nations refuse to enact sound policies, progress against poverty
is nearly impossible," Bush said. "In these situations, more aid money
can actually be counterproductive, because it subsidizes bad policies,
delays reform and crowds out private investment."</TE>
<TE>   Bush also repeated his call to the World Bank and other financial
institutions to provide as much as 50% of their assistance to the poorest
nations in the form of grants rather than loans. But some Europeans say
grants should be limited, to perhaps 10%, lest they jeopardize the future
lending base of the institutions.</TE>
<TE>   The president chose his words carefully as he made his case that there
is a connection between a war on poverty and the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "Poverty doesn't cause terrorism. Being poor doesn't make you a
murderer. Most of the plotters of September the 11th were raised in
comfort," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   "Yet persistent poverty and oppression can lead to hopelessness and
despair. And when governments fail to meet the most basic needs of their
people, these failed states can become havens for terror," he added,
citing Afghanistan as an example.</TE>
<TE>   "In World War II, we fought to make the world safer, then worked to
rebuild it. As we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror, we
must also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens,"
Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot leave behind half of humanity as we seek a better future
for ourselves," he said.</TE>

<HD>Cheney, Yemeni Leader Hold Talks</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Vice president visits nation where U.S. troops reportedly
are to give anti-terror training.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MUSCAT, Oman
</DL>
<LD>Making perhaps the most sensitive stop of his Middle East tour,
Vice President Dick Cheney on Thursday courted a Yemeni government
anxious about taking up a role in the war on terrorism. Meanwhile, new
details emerged about U.S. military assistance to the Arabian Peninsula
state.</LD>
<LD>   The vice president spent less than two hours in Yemen's capital, Sana,
talking with President Ali Abdullah Saleh before leaving for Salalah,
Oman. Cheney flew on a U.S. Air Force C-17 cargo plane that made evasive
maneuvers in case of missile attack or gunfire.</LD>
<LD>   The United States is reportedly preparing to send at least 100 troops
to Yemen to help train its forces for anti-terror operations. The country
has been considered one of the more likely places where Al Qaeda
terrorists fleeing Afghanistan might seek refuge.</LD>
<TE>   While Cheney met with Saleh, Faris Sanabani, the publisher of the
English-language Yemen Observer newspaper, who has connections to the
government, said Yemen expects three groups of U.S. military trainers--20
to 30 in each group--to visit for about one month each.</TE>
<TE>   Yemen already has received several senior U.S. officials, among them
CIA Director George J. Tenet and FBI chief Robert Mueller.</TE>
<TE>   Sanabani said that Yemen does not want the Americans "to come in and
do the fighting," but that the government understands "the importance of
having trainers."</TE>
<TE>   He spoke with a small group of reporters who traveled to Yemen with
Cheney. His comments were relayed to others in Oman.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S.-Yemeni cooperation represents a significant shift for the
government in Sana, even if the level of U.S. involvement is relatively
low.</TE>
<TE>   Yemen has been home to terrorist operations in the past, and it was
the site of the October 2000 attack on the Navy destroyer Cole, which
killed 17 sailors. The new U.S. ambassador to Yemen was formerly the
State Department's acting counter-terrorism chief.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney took only a limited delegation to Yemen, the fourth country on
his 12-nation, 11-day tour that began Sunday in London and is now taking
him through the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   The journey had been organized around the Bush administration's
efforts to build support to expand the war on terrorism beyond
Afghanistan and seek out Al Qaeda operatives and other terrorists
throughout the Islamic world. Cheney is also discussing with his hosts
the administration's campaign to counter Iraq's efforts to develop
weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   But the spiral of Israeli-Palestinian violence has pushed that
conflict onto the agenda at every stop.</TE>
<TE>   Yemen was not originally on Cheney's schedule, but it was added after
Saleh requested the visit.</TE>

<KH>DISPATCH FROM AIR FORCE TWO</KH>
<HD>Odyssey Eased by Perks of Office</HD>
<DH>Travel: Amenities of a 'flying White House' enable Cheney to tackle
Mideast mission without too much wear.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MUSCAT, Oman
</DL>
<LD>Prescription for a man with a heart condition: Visit 12 countries
in 11 days. Cross nine time zones. Dine on the fare of exotic palaces.
Work under pressure.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps not.</LD>
<LD>   Nevertheless, Vice President Dick Cheney is following just such a
regimen, while dodging some on-the-road hazards to lend a heart-healthy
cast to his Middle Eastern odyssey.</LD>
<TE>   To do so, he is making ample use of the perks of his office. In many
cases, in fact, they are the perks of the presidency, putting the
unobtrusive Cheney in the rare position of appearing to the untrained eye
every bit the president he is so careful not to overshadow.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, at midpoint of the trip, he is showing little wear--save
for a very visible scrape on his head from a too-close encounter with the
door frame of his limousine.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney, 61, has had four heart attacks since 1978, most recently in
November 2000. He underwent quadruple bypass surgery in 1998. After he
experienced abnormal heart rhythms last June, a high-tech pacemaker was
implanted in his chest.</TE>
<TE>   He travels with an exercise bicycle. His calendar isn't quite as full
as suggested by his travel agenda. And aboard his airplane, he appears to
be sticking to his diet.</TE>
<TE>   Consider:</TE>
<TE>   Others aboard the plane were served a lunch of gravy-smothered beef
shavings on white bread, with mashed potatoes. The salad was topped with
bacon bits, sunflower seeds and little bits of something that, if they
weren't Rice Krispies, they shouldn't have gone snap, crackle and pop.
For Cheney, a more typical lunch is poached salmon on greens.</TE>
<TE>   At a luncheon with British Prime Minister Tony Blair at 10 Downing
St., the menu was soup, fish, fruit and what a senior Cheney aide happily
called "lots of fresh vegetables." White wine was poured but left
untouched.</TE>
<TE>   The fare was heavier when the vice president dined with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheik: Soup
with pasta, lamb, "boiled shrimp with a sole thing," as described by a
fellow diner, and baked Alaska.</TE>
<TE>   His doctor stays nearby--not just in an automobile close to the vice
president's limousine but, at least on some occasions, in Cheney's
elevator.</TE>
<TE>   The perks are presidential, but the schedule is not.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Cheney routinely arrives at the White House by 7:30
a.m., according to an aide who said his motorcade often passes her as
she's making her way downtown.</TE>
<TE>   This week, however, he has followed neither the pattern of President
Bush, who regularly starts days on the road at sunup (and ends them at
dusk whenever possible) nor former President Clinton, who would engage in
diplomacy all day and gather friends and aides to enjoy a late-night and
lengthy dinner in a foreign capital, or leave at night for a flight to
the next city.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, Cheney's initial days on the road have followed a pace that is
less than frantic, although that promises to pick up this weekend, when
he will wake up in one country, stop in a second at midday and wind up in
a third for a late meeting and an overnight stay.</TE>
<TE>   The flights have all been during daylight hours. At the first stop in
London, Cheney didn't leave Winfield House, the U.S. ambassador's
residence in Regent's Park, until midday. He was back well before dinner,
following a relaxed schedule that allowed time to overcome jet lag.</TE>
<TE>   He even fit in a tourist stop, one particularly apt for this vice
president, the caveman of Washington who has spent many days since Sept.
11 in a "secure, undisclosed location." He toured the Cabinet War Rooms,
the once-secret underground World War II bunker of Prime Minister Winston
Churchill.</TE>
<TE>   If anything could have affected his blood pressure, it would have been
the famously cheeky London tabloids.</TE>
<TE>   One ran a picture of Bush to illustrate a story on a White House plan
that could expand the potential targets of U.S. nuclear weapons. It had
Bush declaring, "Let's Nuke 'Em All."</TE>
<TE>   Cheney made the cover of another tabloid, as he sought British support
for an expansion of the war on terrorism. His photo had been doctored to
include fangs. The headline trumpeted the "American Warwolf in London."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the security precautions being taken for the vice president
are less than visible. Some would seem inconsequential, others merely
unusual.</TE>
<TE>   Members of Cheney's traveling party are carrying schedules of the
trip. But unlike on other trips, when the cover of the schedule carries
the names of the countries he is visiting, these covers bear only the
names of the people to whom they were issued and control numbers, to
better keep track of them. Journalists have been asked not to report on
his planned stops before he arrives.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, every page carries this reminder: "You are required to keep
this document with you at all times. Loss of this document constitutes an
operational security violation and will be treated as such."</TE>
<TE>   On most legs, Cheney is traveling aboard an Air Force Boeing 747
bearing the tail number 29000. It's one of two jumbo jets designated Air
Force One when the president of the United States is aboard, and it's
just back in the fleet after an 11-month overhaul. The only time a vice
president had previously been "bumped up" to one of the planes was when
Al Gore, on a last-minute assignment, hurried to Kyoto, Japan, to revive
stalled negotiations for a climate change treaty.</TE>
<TE>   The aircraft carries extensive and sophisticated communications gear,
including secure telephone lines, as well as antimissile defenses.</TE>
<TE>   Among the accompanying perks: The shiny blue-and-white aircraft jumped
to the head of the queue of a dozen planes waiting to take off from
London's Heathrow Airport on a busy Tuesday morning.</TE>
<TE>   The airplane is more than a convenience.</TE>
<TE>   The vice president is meeting with two kings, two emirs, one sultan
and assorted crown princes. In a part of the world where status and
appearance weigh heavily, the plane invests in Cheney's mission the
second-most recognizable symbol of the American presidency; indeed, it is
known as the flying White House.</TE>
<TE>   And unlike the Boeing 757 that functions as Air Force Two, it has a
medical suite that can serve as an operating room.</TE>
<TE>   But Cheney eschewed all that for his hour-and-a-half visit Thursday in
Yemen, which which the administration views as a potential hiding place
for Al Qaeda terrorists fleeing Afghanistan. It was considered the most
dangerous stop on his itinerary.</TE>
<TE>   In a bow to security concerns, Cheney never left the airport, meeting
there with President Ali Abdullah Saleh before flying on to Oman. Much of
his traveling party, including a small group of reporters, was kept on
board the plane.</TE>
<TE>   For these stops, the vice president flew--in the cockpit--aboard an
Air Force C-17 cargo plane.</TE>
<TE>   On the ground, Cheney is traveling in one of a number of Cadillacs
that the Secret Service moves around the world for the president and vice
president.</TE>
<TE>   It was one of those limos that delivered the red scrape to the vice
president's head as he exited.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Grand Jury Indicts Pearl Kidnapping Suspect</HD>
<DH>Justice: Charges could lead to the death penalty. But Pakistan has
not promised to hand over the British-born militant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A federal grand jury Thursday indicted an Islamic militant accused
of masterminding the kidnapping and slaying of Wall Street Journal
reporter Daniel Pearl, escalating the United States' push to have Pearl's
alleged killers tried in this country.</LD>
<LD>   Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh, who is being held by authorities in Pakistan,
was charged with hostage-taking and conspiracy to commit hostage-taking.
Because the alleged crimes ended in Pearl's death, those two counts could
carry the death penalty.</LD>
<LD>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft said Sheikh "led a ring of co-conspirators
who carefully and methodically set a death trap for Daniel Pearl, lured
him into it with lies and savagely ended his life."</LD>
<TE>   Pearl was kidnapped Jan. 23 in the Arabian Sea port of Karachi and
killed a short time later by captors who recorded his decapitation on
videotape. The film was delivered to U.S. authorities in Pakistan last
month.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft said the United States continues to investigate Sheikh's
alleged accomplices, and he indicated that additional charges could be
filed against the British-born suspect.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department on Thursday also unsealed an earlier indictment
of Sheikh that charges him with the kidnapping of an American tourist,
Bela J. Nuss, in India in 1994. Nuss was released after 11 days. If
convicted on that count, Sheikh could face life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   The indictments come amid delicate negotiations between Pakistan and
the United States over custody of Sheikh.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft said the indictment sends a clear signal that the United
States expects to conduct its own trial of Sheikh. But he indicated that
the U.S. has yet to secure an agreement from Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   "We are signaling our clear interest in trying him on these charges,"
Ashcroft said. "We are collaborating with the Pakistanis and informing
them of our interests, and we expect them to be cooperative."</TE>
<TE>   But Pakistani authorities said Tuesday that Sheikh will be tried there
before any hand-over to U.S. authorities is considered. Prosecutors in
Karachi have yet to file charges, and earlier this week asked for more
time to assemble their case.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan faces pressure from nationalist and extremist elements within
the country not to comply with the U.S. request. Pakistani officials have
also acknowledged concern that Sheikh might try to sour U.S.-Pakistani
relations by revealing information about militant groups' alleged ties to
Pakistan's intelligence service.</TE>
<TE>   In a courtroom outburst Tuesday, Sheikh threatened retaliation against
American targets if he was turned over or if he died in captivity, saying
America "would suffer the consequences."</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft said the Justice Department wanted to have indictments of
Sheikh in place so that if he was released or escaped, U.S. authorities
would have legal standing to apprehend him. Ashcroft noted that Sheikh,
who spent five years in an Indian prison, was freed in 1999 after
colleagues hijacked an Indian jet and demanded his release.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't have charges pending in that setting," Ashcroft said,
adding that if Sheikh was freed under any circumstances now, "we would be
in a position to take him."</TE>
<TE>   The two indictments contained some of the most detailed information to
date on Sheikh, who studied at the London School of Economics before
becoming linked with militant organizations, including the Harkat Ansar,
an armed Pakistani group seeking India's withdrawal from the disputed
Himalayan territory of Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   According to Thursday's indictment, Sheikh trained in military camps
in Afghanistan and fought with Taliban and Al Qaeda forces last fall
before escaping to Pakistan. Ashcroft said Sheikh then began pursuing a
plan "to take hostage an acclaimed journalist from an influential U.S.
newspaper in order to change U.S. policy in the war against terror."</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh used a false identity--Chaudrey Bashir--to correspond with
Pearl by e-mail and lure him to the meeting in Karachi where he was
abducted, according to the indictment.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl was pursuing a story about possible links between Pakistani
militants and Richard C. Reid, who is charged with attempting to blow up
a Miami-bound plane in December by igniting explosives in his shoes.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh, according to the indictment, offered to introduce Pearl to a
prominent Muslim cleric. Last week, a Karachi taxi driver reportedly
testified that he drove Pearl to that meeting, and witnessed Sheikh shake
Pearl's hand and usher the reporter into a white car.</TE>
<TE>   A few days later, on Jan. 26, a group identifying itself as the
National Movement for the Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty e-mailed
to several U.S. newspapers pictures of a shackled Pearl with a gun to his
head. The group made various demands, including the release of Pakistani
prisoners in U.S. custody. Four days later, a second e-mail message
arrived warning that Pearl would be executed unless the demands were met.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft said Thursday that before that second e-mail was sent, the
kidnappers "had already brutally killed Daniel Pearl and videotaped the
mutilation of his body."</TE>
<TE>   There were reports Thursday that a new suspect was in custody in
Pakistan who claimed responsibility for killing Pearl aboard a boat in
the Arabian Sea. Justice Department officials declined to comment on the
report.</TE>
<TE>   A Pakistani judge this week agreed to give prosecutors until March 22
to continue their investigation of Pearl's slaying. Authorities continue
to search for Pearl's body and the weapon used to kill him.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl's French-born wife, Mariane, who is pregnant with the couple's
first child, met Thursday with President Bush, Ashcroft and other
officials. A spokesman for the Pearl family declined to comment on the
meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl had worked abroad since the mid-1990s for the Wall Street
Journal. The indictment was handed down by a federal grand jury in New
Jersey, a location chosen because it is where the Journal has been based
since its New York offices were damaged extensively in the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks.</TE>

<HD>Karzai Fails to Enlist Germany</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Afghan leader is unable to persuade Berlin to take top
peacekeeping role when Britain steps down.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN
</DL>
<LD>In a rare setback during his global travels to drum up support for
his shattered homeland, interim Afghan Prime Minister Hamid Karzai failed
Thursday to persuade German officials to take charge of international
peacekeepers in Kabul next month when Britain's command expires.</LD>
<LD>   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping
vowed that Germany will play a major role in rebuilding Afghanistan but
said that Bundeswehr troops risk being "overextended" if they expand
their role in the Central Asian country.</LD>
<LD>   "I made it clear that we are skeptical about any physical expansion of
the mandate," Schroeder told journalists after his talks here with
Karzai, who is on a three-day visit to press for aid and investment.</LD>
<TE>   But Schroeder left the door open to extending the stay of German
peacekeepers, who are among 4,500 troops from 19 countries in and near
the still-volatile Afghan capital.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N.-authorized International Security Assistance Force for
Afghanistan is funded and staffed only through June. But most nations
participating in the huge stabilization and reconstruction effort
acknowledge that a major international presence will be needed much
longer to ensure that the next phase of pacifying the country stays on
track.</TE>
<TE>   A convention of Afghan tribal elders known as a loya jirga is to take
place in mid-June to elect a new government and provisional legislature
to serve 18 months and prepare for elections. Karzai, clad in his
now-trademark silk cloak draped over a Western blazer, said Berlin has
offered to finance the loya jirga to ensure that the second stage of a
peace process begun in Bonn in November comes to fruition.</TE>
<TE>   The peacekeeping force has proved a major confidence-building factor
for Kabul residents, so much so that Karzai said he hears pleas from
elsewhere in the country for a similar deployment to guard against any
resurgence of fighting.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a petition from the Afghan people. In asking for more
international peacekeepers here, for more ISAF, I am only repeating the
demands of the Afghan people," Karzai said.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking at a brief welcoming meeting with German Foreign Minister
Joschka Fischer, Karzai told journalists that he had come to Berlin to
make the case for Bundeswehr command of a force that includes 1,200
German troops.</TE>
<TE>   "We were not able to persuade Germany of this," Karzai said after his
talks with Schroeder, and he repeated his disappointment after meeting
with Scharping.</TE>
<TE>   The German defense minister repeated Schroeder's explanation that with
10,000 German troops deployed from the Balkans to East Timor, his forces
would run the risk of failing in their other missions if Berlin were to
expand its commitment in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Germany has agreed, however, to take over the "tactical command" of
troops in Kabul, organizing day-to-day functions such as patrolling, but
overall command is expected to be assumed by Turkey, making it
responsible for the more demanding tasks of arranging communications,
negotiations, security for officials and international coordination.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder and his Cabinet also promised Karzai 320 million euros,
about $280 million, in reconstruction and development aid for the
war-ravaged country during the next three years.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai meets today with German industrialists to discuss details of
the Berlin government's pledge to share its telecommunications and
construction expertise with Afghans as they set out to rescue a country
left in ruins after more than a generation of unrelenting bombing and
bloodshed.</TE>

<DL>BAGRAM, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>The U.S.-led Operation Anaconda has failed to produce any top Al
Qaeda leaders, and an American commander said Thursday that the terrorist
network's upper echelon might not have been in the Shahi Kot valley when
the battle began.</LD>
<LD>   But even without apparently capturing its ultimate quarry--terrorist
leader Osama bin Laden--the biggest U.S.-led ground assault since the
1991 Persian Gulf War has removed "hundreds" from the rolls of
international terror, most of them from the Russian republic of Chechnya,
Uzbekistan and even China, said Maj. Gen. Frank L. Hagenbeck, commander
of the coalition waging the battle in eastern Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   "We've rid the world of hundreds of trained killers who will now not
slaughter innocent men, women and children," Hagenbeck said.</LD>
<TE>   He added that he believed that few of the estimated 1,000 cadres who
fought in the valley about 100 miles south of this former Soviet air base
had escaped the U.S.-led dragnet, which has become a cave-by-cave search
for Al Qaeda fighters thought to be holed up there.</TE>
<TE>   "To this point, we do know that we've killed some second- and
third-tier Al Qaeda leadership," Hagenbeck said. "The big names that you
and I are most familiar with, however, indications are that they were not
in this valley as we came here. We did not have information prior to the
attack that they would be here, but we have indications where they are,
and I can assure you that we will track them down and get them before
this is over."</TE>
<TE>   Hagenbeck later clarified that he had no "actionable intelligence" on
Bin Laden's whereabouts and wouldn't specify whether he believes that the
Al Qaeda leader remains in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday night, U.S. and Canadian troops spotted four gunmen believed
to be Al Qaeda in the Shahi Kot valley and alerted pro-U.S. Afghan forces
to give chase. A firefight followed, but all four of the enemy soldiers
escaped, said Maj. Bryan Hilferty, spokesman for the Army's 10th Mountain
Division at the Bagram air base.</TE>
<TE>   Hagenbeck's statements came amid reports from Afghan forces that Al
Qaeda fighters fled en masse through U.S. positions and that few bodies
of enemy forces were evident on the battlefield.</TE>
<TE>   Even the holdouts' commander, Mullah Saifur Rahman Mansour, and his
three brothers apparently remained at large, although Hagenbeck vowed
that "we are right on their backs."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the campaign appeared as frustrating as the fight for the
Tora Bora caves in December. In both cases, intensive bombing left
coalition forces in possession of an empty landscape, sifting for clues
in the rubble and caves--and wondering how many enemy fighters had
actually been there and how many had slipped away.</TE>
<TE>   At Shahi Kot, at least, U.S. military leaders are convinced that few
enemies escaped and that the bulk of them--hundreds of fighters--were
wiped out during the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   But that wasn't the view of some of the United States' Afghan allies,
who doubt that the number of Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters killed could
be as high as the U.S. claims, and who assume that the number of escapees
is much higher.</TE>
<TE>   Commander Amrullah, an officer just back from Shahi Kot who was
preparing to head back with his troops to Kabul, the capital, said
Thursday that he had compared notes with fellow commanders in Afghan Gen.
Gul Hydar's force during a late-night meeting Wednesday. The consensus
was that fewer than 100 bodies were strewn around the valley, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I personally saw 15 to 17 bodies, but based on what I saw I could
conclude 40 to 50 people have been killed," Amrullah said. "However, we
did not go to the high areas or to the remote positions in order to know
totally."</TE>
<TE>   Many more people had escaped, he said: "Probably 500 to 600, or maybe
1,000, might have got away through the narrow pathways to Pakistan."</TE>
<TE>   He pointed out that the exodus might have started even before the
battle, assuming that the valley's Al Qaeda and Taliban inhabitants were
forewarned and prepared for an attack.</TE>
<TE>   Another Afghan commander, Gen. Abdul Wahab Joyendah, agreed that
hundreds had escaped and said that he expected them to regroup farther
north and try to attack the interim government from a base closer to
Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   One piece of evidence that many fled was the fact that the leader,
Mansour, apparently survived, and he would have had many people with him,
Joyendah said.</TE>
<TE>   Hydar said, however, that the body count wasn't the main issue.</TE>
<TE>   "The big achievement by the Americans was that they annihilated the
biggest redoubt of the Taliban that remained," he said. "Now they [Al
Qaeda and the Taliban fighters] will be attacked wherever they run."</TE>
<TE>   The campaign would also stand as a warning to would-be Taliban
supporters around the country, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hagenbeck suggested that the reason for the apparent lack of bodies in
the battlefield was the devastating intensity of the bombs dropped on
three villages in the Shahi Kot valley, where body parts lie amid the
rubble.</TE>
<TE>   "We have pretty credible information that after about 36 to 48 hours
into the fight, that there was a call from the Al Qaeda leaders of the
local area to bring forth hundreds of wooden coffins," he said. "And on
the fourth day of the fight, there was a movement and a call to bring in
trucks and SUVs to extract their dead. The coffins never got in, and the
SUVs and any vehicles that tried to enter the area never got in."</TE>
<TE>   During the first week of Operation Anaconda, Hagenbeck said, Al Qaeda
fighters moved into the battle zone, boosting the estimated initial force
of between 150 and 250 fighters to 1,000 or more. But even with the
United States' sophisticated spy technology and numerous Special Forces
operatives on the ground, a small number of Al Qaeda soldiers could have
escaped through the mountains east of the valley, Hagenbeck acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some people that have been able to slip through here, I'm
certain," he said. "We've got folks where we understand and believe that
some of the Al Qaeda leaders and their foot soldiers are currently
located. We're not going to let loose of these guys."</TE>
<TE>   Although those remaining in the valley were reduced to "double digits,
probably less than 100," Hagenbeck said, the possibility remained for
another large massing of enemy forces, and another ground assault similar
in scale to Operation Anaconda.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the Shahi Kot cave hide-outs have yielded a trove of
intelligence and weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Overnight, Hilferty said, troops searched 10 caves and blew up 10
fixed mortar positions.</TE>
<TE>   "We continue to find bomb-making devices; we've had extensive weapons
caches; we've found manuals, meticulously recorded, on how to attack
individuals, cars, how to blow up bridges," Hagenbeck said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, both the forces searching the caves and those elsewhere
in the valley have been taking DNA samples from the dead to determine
whether top leaders may have been killed.</TE>

<HD>China Letting N. Korean Defectors Leave</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>BEIJING
</DL>
<LD>The Chinese government said today that it had reached an agreement
to avert a diplomatic crisis after 25 North Korean defectors stormed into
the Spanish Embassy here and threatened to commit suicide if the
international community did not help them escape to South Korea.</LD>
<LD>   Sources in South Korea said the defectors would be sent later today to
a third country, which was not identified but was believed to be the
Philippines, and from there would be flown to Seoul.</LD>
<LD>   The South Korean news agency Yonhap reported that the defectors would
reach Seoul on Sunday. The group includes 11 children, the youngest a
7-year-old girl, and was reported to have left the embassy grounds today.</LD>
<TE>   Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji told reporters at a televised news
conference this morning that "China's Foreign Ministry has consulted with
the relevant embassy and has reached agreement with them. This matter
will be handled in accordance with law."</TE>
<TE>   In a dramatic bid for international sympathy, the North Koreans on
Thursday stormed into the lightly guarded Spanish Embassy, waving and
cheering to television crews who had been tipped off in advance.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of us carry poison on our person to commit suicide if the
Chinese authorities should choose once again to send us back to North
Korea," said a statement issued on behalf of the defectors by the
Tokyo-based Life Funds for North Korean Refugees, a private assistance
group. "The only power we have left is to appeal to you on our knees with
tears."</TE>
<TE>   It is estimated that at least 100,000 North Koreans and possibly as
many as 400,000 have escaped their famine-stricken homeland into China,
where they live and work clandestinely, in fear of being sent home. Human
rights advocates say repatriated defectors are put in concentration
camps, tortured and often executed.</TE>
<TE>   China does not recognize North Korean defectors as refugees. It honors
a 1961 repatriation agreement with North Korea to send them home instead
of United Nations conventions on refugees. In addition, China restricts
the South Korean Embassy in Beijing from offering direct assistance to
North Korean defectors, who are forced to go to third countries, such as
the Philippines, Mongolia or Vietnam, before they can reach South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "Their entry into the Spanish Embassy can only be regarded as an
illegal entry," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said.</TE>
<TE>   The plight of the North Korean defectors puts China in a tricky
position. Although Beijing has historically considered its relationship
with the regime in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, to be as close as
"lips and teeth," the Chinese side has recently sought to distance itself
slightly from its neighbor and to encourage a rapprochement on the Korean
peninsula. Also, Beijing does not want to alienate Western opinion by
returning the defectors to the repressive conditions in their home
country, especially just before a U.N. meeting on human rights is due to
convene in Geneva.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
Thursday that the defectors should not be sent home.</TE>
<TE>   The incident was the second time within a year that North Korean
refugees have sought asylum inside a foreign mission in Beijing. In June,
a family of seven dashed into the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees here in the Chinese capital and remained holed up inside for
three days. In a face-saving deal, the Chinese government allowed the
family members to leave Beijing on medical grounds for Singapore and the
Philippines, from which they eventually went on to South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   But the latest group is the largest to have pulled off such a feat and
its apparent success raises the possibility of a new flood of North
Korean refugees. A record 583 North Korean defectors were resettled in
South Korea in 2001, nearly double the number from a year earlier. So far
this year, 106 defectors have reached South Korea, including 18 whose
arrival was announced today by the Seoul government.</TE>
<TE>   "North Korea is a giant prison without bars," declared a 45-year-old
dental assistant identified as Yu Dong Hyok, one of the defectors, in a
statement released by human rights advocates. He and others in the group
of 25 said they had tried last year to escape into China but were caught
and sent back. The North Koreans described harsh labor camps where failed
defectors were beaten, tortured, raped, executed or simply worked to
death.</TE>
<TE>   "We were not human beings there. We were less than beasts," Yu said.</TE>

<HD>Senate Panel Rejects Bush's Judge Nominee</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee rejected President
Bush's choice of conservative Mississippi Judge Charles W. Pickering for
the U.S. Court of Appeals on Thursday, signaling that they would engage
in payback for the way Republicans treated many liberal nominees in the
1990s.</LD>
<LD>   The panel voted, 10-9, along party lines to kill Pickering's
nomination. Democrats called him too conservative and too political to be
promoted to a higher court.</LD>
<LD>   Unless the Republicans succeed in reviving his nomination on the
Senate floor, which is considered unlikely, Pickering will be the first
of Bush's court nominees to lose in the Democrat-controlled Senate.</LD>
<TE>   So far, 42 of Bush's judges have won Senate confirmation, including
seven who sit on the appeals court. Last fall, for example, the Senate
quickly and unanimously approved Bush's pick of conservative Louisiana
Judge Edith Brown Clement for the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in
New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   But when the 64-year-old Pickering was chosen for the same appeals
court, a coalition of liberal, civil rights and women's rights activists
in Washington mounted an all-out campaign to defeat him.</TE>
<TE>   They retraced Pickering's early life in the segregated Mississippi of
the 1960s and portrayed him as a judge whose "hard right" political
leanings found their way into his courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   The battle escalated in recent weeks, affirming the judicial selection
process as perhaps the leading forum of ideological warfare between the
parties. President Bush joined the fray this week and urged the Senate to
put aside "ideological battles."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans said Pickering had been unfairly tarred by "outside
liberal left-wing groups," as Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) put it
Thursday. "It's a dark day for the Senate when these attack groups . . .
can destroy a decent and well-qualified nominee."</TE>
<TE>   The Democrats played down the talk of racism and conservative
extremism. They took turns praising Pickering as a "decent and good man."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they concentrated on his record as a judge. He had been
reversed 26 times by the appeals court. Some of his rulings were
overturned as being flatly wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "He failed to follow the clear law," said Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.).</TE>
<TE>   Pickering was also criticized for his handling of a 1994 cross-burning
case.</TE>
<TE>   The judge refused to give Daniel Swan, the convicted cross burner, the
seven-year prison sentence required by the U.S. sentencing guidelines,
and he met privately with prosecutors to pressure them to agree to a more
lenient term. The judge said the sentence was too severe and went to
considerable lengths to avoid imposing it.</TE>
<TE>   Pickering then ordered the court record sealed. The Democrats learned
the details only hours before a committee hearing on the nomination.</TE>
<TE>   "In my experience, these things are very outside the norm for a
judge," said Edwards, a veteran trial lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Democrats said the Pickering vote had less to do with the
legacy of Mississippi in the 1960s than with the legacy of Bill Clinton
in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not prepared to reward the president's party for their
obstructionism over the last six years," said Sen. Richard Durbin
(D-Ill.). "Judge Pickering certainly received better treatment from this
committee than did President Clinton's nominees to the 5th Circuit."</TE>
<TE>   One by one, the Democrats made clear they were not ready to put aside
the Republicans' tactics when a Democrat was in the White House.</TE>
<TE>   After the GOP took control of the Senate in 1995, the Republicans
blocked a series of Clinton's court nominees, especially racial and
ethnic minorities and especially in the South. The 5th Circuit was a
particular battleground.</TE>
<TE>   "During the last six years of the Clinton administration, this
committee did not report out a single judge to the 5th Circuit Court of
Appeals," said Sen. Russell D. Feingold (D-Wis.).</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, Clinton nominated Jorge Rangel, an attorney from Corpus
Christi, Texas, to the 5th Circuit. He withdrew in frustration two years
later. Clinton then chose Enrique Moreno, a Harvard-educated lawyer from
El Paso. He also nominated H. Alston Johnson, a Louisiana law professor
for the same court.</TE>
<TE>   But the Republicans refused to allow a hearing for any of those
nominees.</TE>
<TE>   Now the Democrats said they were not eager to move quickly to fill
those vacant seats on the 5th Circuit with conservative Bush nominees.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans say they will move to bring the nomination to a vote on
the Senate floor, where at least two Southern Democrats have said they
could support Pickering.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate rules allow for such a vote, despite the committee vote to
reject the nomination. However, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle
(D-S.D.) can demand a super-majority vote of 60 before bringing the
matter to the floor, staffers say. If so, that would kill the nomination.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also urged a floor vote on Pickering. In a statement after the
committee action, he said he was "deeply disappointed." The judge
"deserves better than to be blocked by a party-line vote of 10 senators
on one committee. The voice of the entire Senate deserves to be heard."</TE>
<TE>   As a veteran U.S. district judge and a well-known Republican leader in
Mississippi, Pickering had strong qualifications for the job and
determined supporters, including prominent black Mississippians who said
he has changed his views on race.</TE>
<TE>   But the Democrats said they will not defer to Bush's choices if he
selects strident conservatives. They pointed out that they had moved
quickly to confirm most of the president's judicial nominees.</TE>
<TE>   However, the appeals court nominees are more hotly disputed than the
district judgeships. Those judges oversee the law in their regions, and
both sides pay closer attention to who sits on those courts.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has made 29 appellate nominations, 22 of which are pending.</TE>
<TE>   Liberal legal advocates say future battles depend on who is selected
for those seats.</TE>
<TE>   "If they push more far-right candidates, there will be more fights,"
said Elliot Mincberg, legal director for People for the American Way. "If
they pay more attention to the 'advise' in the [Constitution's] 'advise
and consent' process, there won't be. It really depends on who the White
House chooses."</TE>

<DH>Race: Native American students in Colorado name their team the
Fightin' Whites, a twist on the local Fightin' Reds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GREELEY, Colo.
</DL>
<LD>It began as a tongue-in-cheek response to a serious issue.</LD>
<LD>   An intramural basketball team organized by Native American students at
the University of Northern Colorado adopted a team nickname, their
satiric take on a nearby high school's venerable mascot, the Eaton High
Fightin' Reds.</LD>
<LD>   Thus were the Fightin' Whites born.</LD>
<TE>   Far removed from the usual fierceness of mascots, the Fightin' White
is depicted as a '50s-style pale male with an earnest face, dimples and
gleaming, tidy hair. His smiling visage beams on the front of the team
T-shirt. Emblazoned beneath his conservative tie is the slogan, "Every
thang's going to be all white."</TE>
<TE>   The team is attempting to accomplish with humor what others have
failed to do with countless town meetings across the country: to get the
community to discuss in a civil manner the volatile issue of culturally
insensitive team mascots.</TE>
<TE>   That hasn't happened. Instead, a rural town and its high school feel
unfairly targeted. A tradition is under threat. And a bunch of tightly
budgeted college students are sitting on a gold mine in future T-shirt
sales.</TE>
<TE>   "We never expected this to get this big," said Solomon Little Owl, a
forward on the basketball team and the director of Native American
Student Services at the university. "We wanted, humorously, to make a
point. 'Look at this from my point of view. See how it feels to be made
fun of.' If people change their minds, fine. Really, we just needed
uniforms and this seemed pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   The team began wearing the white and red T-shirts a few weeks ago, in
solidarity with a local coalition working to rid the state's gymnasiums
and playing fields of Redskins, Indians and Savages. Since then, Little
Owl, from the Crow nation, has received more than 400 e-mails, his
voicemail system got so full it crashed and the waiting room outside his
office is a logjam of reporters. The team has been inundated with
requests to buy its T-shirts.</TE>
<TE>   Up the road in Eaton, about 85 miles northeast of Denver, townspeople
are baffled and a little miffed that they've been singled out as
insensitive clods. Their beloved mascot, they say, has represented the
school and town proudly at state basketball tournaments and spelling bees
alike. They haven't heard a peep until now.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly there is nothing new about the issue. Despite a resolution
passed last year by the National Education Assn. rejecting the use of
such mascots and a statement by the Civil Rights Commission calling for
an end to Native American images and nicknames in sports, they persist.</TE>
<TE>   The Atlanta Braves have their menacing tomahawk chop. The Washington
Redskins, the Cleveland Indians and thousands of college, high school and
elementary athletic teams continue to feature mascots that depict
snarling, spear-toting Indians.</TE>
<TE>   Many have decried the mascots, but few if any have turned the
controversy on its head in this manner. This most recent debate takes
place fittingly in the West, where the majority of Native Americans live.
Colorado has a Native American population of about 80,000.</TE>
<TE>   Charlie Cuny, a UNC junior, organized the intramural team whose
official name is Native Pride. The team is made up of three Native
Americans, two Latinos and five Caucasians, the real Fightin' Whites. The
team has a 2-2 record in league play. Cuny, a Lakota, said that for
lifelong jocks like him the sports world is drenched in offensive images.</TE>
<TE>   "You sit down on Saturday afternoon and watch football, and see a
Florida State game," he said. "You see this Seminole come riding out with
his blue eyes and his feathers. He charges across the field and throws a
spear down. I'm thinking, 'That spear is sacred.' To see your culture and
religion disrespected like that is not good."</TE>
<TE>   Dan Ninham, a member of the Oneida tribe, is the doctoral candidate
who organized Coloradans Against Ethnic Stereotyping in Colorado Schools.
The coalition wants 27 of the state's public schools with Indian mascots
to consider a change.</TE>
<TE>   Eaton, an agricultural hamlet of 2,500 about seven miles north of
Greeley, wishes the coalition would go away. Ninham recently addressed a
school board meeting, to a frigid reception. School district Supt. John
Nuspl, who has stopped talking to the media, said at the time that the
mascot is not derogatory and the group's criticism was insulting.</TE>
<TE>   Eaton's mascot is a familiar Indian caricature: A hook-nosed brave
wearing a loincloth, with arms folded over his bare chest and a feather
sticking out of a braid.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Principal Bill Mondt, in an interview this week, made little
attempt to disguise his boredom with the topic.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a joke; it's all pretty silly," said Mondt, who is also the head
football coach. "The mascot is not meant to be offensive. Something will
always be offensive to someone. That wouldn't be a reason to change it."</TE>
<TE>   Mondt said there is no connection between the Fightin' Reds nickname
and the Indian brave mascot found on the school's walls and team
uniforms.</TE>
<TE>   "The term 'Reds' we've had since the school was formed," Mondt
explained. "I think it refers to the Scandinavians who settled this area.
They had red hair. The Indian mascot came when Eaton High merged with
another school in the '70s."</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of its lineage, most of Eaton's 450 students are rallying
around the mascot they affectionately call Big Red.</TE>
<TE>   "If I was Native American, I would be honored to have us named after
me," said sophomore Levi Dyer, awkwardly echoing a common sentiment.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the administration's insistence that solidarity exists within
the school's staff, a group of Eaton High teachers is circulating a
letter calling for the administration to debate the mascot issue.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Trotter, a history and government teacher who has been at Eaton
for 17 years, said there are people within the school and town who abhor
the Indian mascot but are too cowed to speak out. One teacher who asked
not to be named said he uses correction fluid to obliterate the mascot on
school stationery before mailing anything.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole thing could have been avoided if our administration took a
leadership role," Trotter said. "Without dialogue, people are going to
feel defensive. Both sides are going to feel attacked. It's human
nature."</TE>
<TE>   Little else has been talked about in town for the last week. Debbie
Dusin, a hairdresser at Beauty Haven, said the shop's usual gossip has
been abandoned, supplanted by mascot debates. Dusin, who was herself a
Fightin' Red, said most people don't see any problem with the mascot.</TE>
<TE>   "It's gone on for years. Why are they just now bringing it up? If they
are offended, sorry, but, I mean, why? How is this offending you? They
say, 'The big nose, the potbelly,' but those are little things," Dusin
said. "There are other issues in the world to be worried about."</TE>
<TE>   To their credit, Eatonians appear to be accepting the Fightin' Whites
mocking mascot with little objection.</TE>
<TE>   They've also become accustomed to the media's glare. Eaton High's two
story yellow-brick building was besieged this week by reporters. On
Wednesday, a Denver radio station showed up and handed out T-shirts with
its proposed alternative mascot, a beaver.</TE>
<TE>   Mondt said the students who got the T-shirts would not be allowed to
wear them at school.</TE>
<TE>   The shirt's sexual reference, he said, was offensive.</TE>

<HD>Witnesses Describe Yates They Once Knew</HD>
<DH>Trial: As penalty segment begins, friends and family testify in
hopes of saving her from death sentence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>They came Thursday one by one--the husband, the school friends, the
mother--to ask a jury in the nation's most notorious death penalty system
to spare the life of Andrea Pia Yates.</LD>
<LD>   "Her life is over one way or the other," defense lawyer George Parnham
told the jury. "Her children are gone, and she sits here, through her
lawyers, asking that she be spared."</LD>
<LD>   Yates, a chronically depressed woman who admitted drowning her five
children in the bathtub last summer, pleaded not guilty by reason of
insanity. But the jury took just a few hours Tuesday afternoon to reject
the insanity claim and declare the 37-year-old homemaker guilty.</LD>
<TE>   Now the same jury, a panel of four men and eight women, must decide
between sentencing Yates to death or sending her to prison for a minimum
of 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of driving home the children's gruesome deaths, the
prosecution rested its case Thursday without calling a single witness.
And on the eve of the jury's deliberations, defense lawyers kept the
testimony terse.</TE>
<TE>   When Yates' 73-year-old mother remembered her "very good, very
obedient, good daughter," she poked bony fingers up beneath her
wire-rimmed glasses and dabbed at her tears.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm here pleading for her life," said Jutta Kennedy, whose husband
died shortly before Yates killed the children. "I've lost seven people in
one year."</TE>
<TE>   Yates' husband, Russell "Rusty" Yates, sat in the witness box for a
few minutes and answered just a handful of questions. "She's the kindest
and most caring person I know," he said. His lips quivered, and he began
to sniffle. "She's always concerned about the kids' safety."</TE>
<TE>   The string of witnesses told the tale of Andrea Yates' slide into
isolation. There were old friends who spoke of Yates' gradual
disappearance from their lives, a brother who described the sibling
relationship as "not particularly close" and in-laws who didn't know
Yates had tried to kill herself.</TE>
<TE>   Friends described a shy, intense girl who graduated first in her high
school class and kept herself thin with laxatives and forced vomiting.
Yates was hard on herself, they said--mortified when she earned a C. As a
mother, she was dauntlessly perfect.</TE>
<TE>   "She was an awesome mom," college friend Molly Maguire-Stefano said.
"You know, cloth diapers, she had all the crafts."</TE>
<TE>   Parnham hit the same points over and over: Until she began talking
about hurting herself and the children, Yates was never violent. Her lone
flash of rebellion--until the day she called police and said flatly, "I
killed my kids"--was a speeding ticket.</TE>
<TE>   Having been found guilty on two counts of capital murder, Yates
already has lost any hope of walking out of prison before the age of 77,
when she'd be eligible for parole under the lightest possible punishment.
When jurors retire to ponder her fate, they must decide two questions:
whether she is likely to commit another violent act, and whether her
background, character and morals provide mitigating reasons to spare her
life.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to send Yates to death row must be unanimous. But she is
standing trial in the toughest court in Texas: 157 of the 454 convicts on
the state's death row were prosecuted here in Harris County.</TE>
<TE>   "The X factor is, this is a Harris County jury, which is traditionally
and notoriously death hungry," Houston defense lawyer Kent Schaffer said.
"The jury did not spend a whole lot of time discussing the complex
evidence presented to them. I take that as a real bad sign."</TE>
<TE>   Closing arguments were set for this morning, and the jury will begin
deliberations by lunchtime, Judge Belinda Hill said.</TE>

<HD>4 Die in Big Pileup on Foggy I-75</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RINGGOLD, Ga.
</DL>
<LD>Four people were killed on a foggy interstate highway Thursday in a
125-vehicle pileup that left a half-mile trail of mangled cars and
trucks, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Thirty-nine people were reported injured, 15 of them seriously.</LD>
<LD>   "I heard a big truck screeching. I heard a crash. I heard another
crash and then another crash. I just heard crash after crash. I heard
people screaming," said Debbie Grant, who lives near Interstate 75 in
northwestern Georgia, close to the Tennessee line.</LD>
<TE>   The accident happened when a southbound tractor-trailer crossed the
median and slammed into several northbound vehicles. Dozens of other
drivers plowed into the pile. It wasn't clear why the truck jumped the
median, the state patrol said.</TE>
<TE>   The wrecks involved vehicles in all lanes of the interstate, though
the four fatalities were in the northbound lanes. Thousands of commuters
use I-75 to reach Chattanooga from their northwest Georgia homes.</TE>
<TE>   "It was so foggy I don't have a clue what happened. I'm alive for some
reason. I couldn't see anything. I couldn't see what was going on," said
Barbara Truett, who nearly hit a pickup.</TE>
<TE>   The wreck happened about 40 miles from the site of a 1990 pileup in
Tennessee that killed 12 people. It prompted Tennessee officials to
install a fog detection system that uses overhead warning signs to
recommend that drivers lower their speed and use alternate routes.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's accident occurred on a stretch of highway that did not have
fog lights.</TE>
<TE>   Two bodies remained trapped in the wreckage. The walking injured were
taken to a fire station by school bus.</TE>
<TE>   The southbound lanes were reopened Thursday afternoon, but the
northbound lanes would probably be closed until early today.</TE>
<TE>   No charges were planned against any drivers. "It did not appear that
there was any fault other than fog," Sheriff Phil Summers said.</TE>

<HD>Search for Bodies Ends at Ga. Crematory; Identification Goes On</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NOBLE, Ga.
</DL>
<LD>After scouring the woods and swamps around Tri-State Crematory for
a month, state officials now believe there are no more bodies on the
16-acre grounds and are focusing on identifying as many of the 339
corpses as possible, a Georgia Emergency Management Agency spokesman said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Officials fear that many corpses will never be identified and are
making plans for a mass burial of unclaimed remains in the late summer or
fall. People who think one of their relatives may be among the corpses
are being asked to provide DNA samples to the Georgia Bureau of
Investigation.</LD>
<LD>   So far authorities have identified 112 bodies, which funeral homes in
three states sent to Tri-State Crematory, run by Ray Brent Marsh. For
reasons that remain a mystery, Marsh allegedly scattered the corpses
about his property and returned to grieving families urns that contained
cement powder and burned wood chips. The first corpse was discovered Feb.
15 by a woman walking her dog near the crematory.</LD>
<TE>   "You know these things happen, but why to us in Walker County?" asked
Susie Cannon, who runs the cafe in nearby LaFayette, the county seat. "I
guess the main feeling people have is disgust. We're a small community,
and you trust people to do the right thing. When they don't, you feel
betrayed. What got into the mind of a nice young man like Ray Brent Marsh
is beyond me."</TE>
<TE>   Marsh, 28, who dropped out of the University of Tennessee at
Chattanooga in 1996 to take over the family crematory when his father
fell ill, is in the Walker County Jail, charged with 204 counts of theft
by deception. His parents and sister were arrested March 8 and charged
with making false statements on a death certificate. They are free on
bond.</TE>
<TE>   That the Marshes were one of Walker County's most respected
families--Clara Marsh, 70, the mother, was head of the local Democratic
Party and a teacher for 30 years--only adds to the sense of puzzlement
and betrayal that has gripped this farming community in the last month.
"This was the type of family you'd send your kids camping with," said
B.J. Sherlin, who runs a video rental shop.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 16, the day 50 or so bodies were found on the Tri-State
property, business at Smokey's BBQ, near the crematory on land owned by
the Marshes, dropped to zero. It has since recovered, but townspeople are
still perplexed by unanswered questions: Why did Ray Brent Marsh have
pictures of decomposing bodies in his computer? Why did he say the
crematory incinerator didn't work, a claim later refuted when
investigators fired it up without a problem? Why were there empty wooden
coffins on the property that had apparently been dug up from some
cemetery?</TE>
<TE>   "When we look back at the past month, I think Walker County has grown
up a little more," said Don Stilwell, publisher of the twice-weekly
Walker County Messenger. "We lost some of our innocence. In a way the big
time and the hard times have come to visit. What everyone wants to know
now is why. Why would Ray Brent Marsh do this?"</TE>
<TE>   At the Noble Zone video shop, B.J. Sherlin has a theory. "The Marshes
are good people, normal people. They didn't come in renting horror
movies. They wanted the latest releases like everyone else. But it's
pretty well known in the county that when the father got sick, Miss Clara
tried to get Ray Brent's older brother to take over the crematory. He
turned her down flat.</TE>
<TE>   "So she went to Ray Brent and talked him into it. He had to quit
college, and there went his dream of being a businessman or lawyer. He
was forced into a business he didn't want to run, and maybe not cremating
the bodies was his way of dealing with his displeasure."</TE>

<HD>Inmate Tied by DNA to '87 Murder Executed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JARRATT, Va.
</DL>
<LD>A convict matched to a 1987 slaying through a search of a DNA
database was executed by injection Thursday night.</LD>
<LD>   After being strapped to the gurney, James Patterson, 35, apologized
for "the evil I brought into this world by my evil deeds."</LD>
<LD>   Patterson was implicated in the slaying of Joyce S. Aldridge when the
state compared DNA samples from the crime with DNA samples in its
database of 175,000 inmates.</LD>
<TE>   After the 1999 match, Patterson confessed and pleaded guilty to
sexually assaulting and killing Aldridge on Oct. 11, 1987. He had been
imprisoned for nearly 14 years on a conviction for an unrelated rape and
was to have been released in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   "I want it to be known that my heart goes out to the Aldridge family
and all that I put them through," Patterson said Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   An Associated Press survey of the 37 other states with the death
penalty turned up no previous cases of a cold-hit execution. The Death
Penalty Information Center in Washington said it was unaware of such a
case.</TE>
<TE>   Virginia became the first state to execute a person whose conviction
was based on DNA evidence when Timothy W. Spencer went to the electric
chair in 1993 for a series of strangulations in Richmond and Arlington.</TE>

<HD>Snowmobilers Cross a Line in Yellowstone</HD>
<DH>Parks: Trespassing into remote areas increases alarmingly,
officials say. One ranger laments a 'disregard of regulations.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH SCHOCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yellowstone National Park officials say "hundreds, probably
thousands" of snowmobilers are entering the park illegally, riding over
remote terrain that would be off limits even if a ban on the machines is
lifted.</LD>
<LD>   In unprecedented numbers, riders are crossing the park's western
boundary into a roadless area, according to one official, "thumbing their
noses" at rules against off-road snowmobiling.</LD>
<LD>   Although snowmobile intrusions are nothing new at the nation's first
national park, the throngs of riders this year have startled and alarmed
the National Park Service.</LD>
<TE>   "We've never seen this volume of intrusion," said Yellowstone West
District Ranger Bob Seibert, who has worked 11 winters at the park. "What
I find so disturbing is the seeming lack of responsible behavior and the
total disregard of regulations."</TE>
<TE>   Marsha Karle, the park's chief of public affairs, said ranger patrols
have been increased in the area where most of the intrusions have
occurred. Rangers were first alerted to the problem by finding hundreds
of fresh snowmobile tracks, and then they saw snowmobile groups leaving
the park.</TE>
<TE>   The surge of trespassing comes as the Bush administration reconsiders
a plan developed under President Clinton to phase out all snowmobile use
within Yellowstone, starting next winter. Prompting the ban were concerns
that snowmobiles--even along approved roads--were harassing elk, bison
and other wildlife, turning the air blue with unhealthy exhaust fumes at
the park gates and shattering the winter solitude for which the park is
famous.</TE>
<TE>   John Wright, a spokesman for Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton, who
called for the review of the proposed ban, said Thursday that the
department will continue to uphold rules prohibiting off-road snowmobile
use in the park.</TE>
<TE>   "We will ensure the regulations are strongly enforced," Wright said.</TE>
<TE>   This year the park spent an extra $265,000 to add ranger patrols,
reduce speed limits, monitor wildlife and groom roads along the current
legal routes, including the crowded 32-mile road between West Yellowstone
and Old Faithful.</TE>
<TE>   But as more rangers guarded the approved snowmobile routes, off-road
trespassing swelled unexpectedly five to eight miles south of the
community of West Yellowstone, a popular staging area for snowmobiling in
the region.</TE>
<TE>   Questioned by rangers, some trespassers said they knew they were in
the park, "and they just didn't care," Seibert said. A familiar retort:
"Well, what are we hurting?"</TE>
<TE>   One park service photograph shows snowmobile tracks crossing over the
snow-covered roof of the South Riverside ranger cabin. No rangers were
inside the cabin at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Park officials say snowmobilers appear to be entering the park through
adjacent national forests, where off-road use is legal, and then crossing
into Yellowstone, far away from regular ranger patrol routes.</TE>
<TE>   Trespassers can be hard to catch in the rugged terrain, but rangers
say they have issued a number of citations.</TE>
<TE>   Patrolling the hard-to-reach border area requires a full day of travel
by a ranger on a snow machine. Officials say the recent incursions have
caused the park to increase vigilance by diverting staff from other
areas.</TE>
<TE>   Seibert is puzzled at what would motivate snowmobilers to break the
law. The terrain inside the park is much like that in the nearby national
forests, where off-road snowmobiling is legal. Part of the thrill could
simply be saying that one has snowmobiled inside Yellowstone, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There could be some blatant disregard and thumbing their noses at the
National Park Service," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have seen a lot of hostility since the proposed ban was
announced," said Karle. "There have been some implied threats to park
employees.</TE>
<TE>   "People may be reacting in hostile ways because they wonder if every
ride they take in the park is going to be their last, and they think
their freedom is being taken away."</TE>
<TE>   Karle said snow machines have been in use in the park since 1949.</TE>
<TE>   The trespassing drew measured criticism from an official of the Blue
Ribbon Coalition, a national motorized recreation group supporting the
continued use of snowmobiles on roads within Yellowstone.</TE>
<TE>   "If, in fact, the boundary is clearly marked and these are intentional
violations, I have no sympathy for snowmobilers who have been caught,"
said Clark Collins, the coalition's executive director.</TE>
<TE>   "We in no way condone deliberate incursions into back-country areas in
national parks or in designated wilderness areas," he said. But if the
trespassing was accidental, in areas where boundaries are not clearly
marked, the park service needs to provide better markers, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the ban say they are disgusted by the reports of
flagrant lawbreaking in the park.</TE>
<TE>   "It's breathtaking to watch the snowmobile industry's snowballing
self-incrimination," said Jon Catton of the Greater Yellowstone
Coalition, a Montana-based conservation group that has been pushing for
the ban.</TE>
<TE>   "One hundred and thirty years ago, Congress drew a line around
Yellowstone and said, 'In here, we choose to enjoy nature . . . ,' "
Catton said. "It's appalling to see a selfish attitude violating that
boundary and trampling Yellowstone and the spirit of generosity that
Yellowstone embodies."</TE>
<TE>   The trespassing comes at a particularly sensitive time for supporters
and opponents of Yellowstone snowmobile use. After recreation groups and
snowmobile makers vehemently objected to the Clinton phaseout, the
Department of the Interior last month issued a supplemental environmental
impact review that set forth alternative plans, from delaying the
phaseout until the winter of 2003-04 to continuing snowmobile use on
existing routes or requiring snowmobile equipment to reduce fumes and
noise. A final version of the report is expected in November.</TE>

<DL>TRENTON, N.J.
</DL>
<LD>Fearing flight schools could again become training grounds for
terrorists, lawmakers in several states are seeking to limit instruction
and require background checks for students.</LD>
<LD>   A bill introduced in New Jersey, for example, would require flight
schools to conduct background checks and keep a register of applicants
that could be made available to authorities. Students would be barred
from taking classes if they had been convicted of crimes such as
aggravated assault, arson or murder.</LD>
<LD>   South Carolina and Connecticut are considering similar legislation. In
Michigan, lawmakers want schools to refuse lessons to anyone who is on
probation or has had a felony conviction in the previous seven years.</LD>
<TE>   Assemblyman Neil Cohen, the New Jersey bill's sponsor, called the
proposals "a minor inconvenience to those who are earnestly learning how
to fly."</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Aviation Administration, which regulates the schools and
is the only body that can authorize pilot's licenses, said the state
measures are unnecessary and encroach on the agency's authority.</TE>
<TE>   "States cannot regulate students at flight schools," FAA spokesman
William Shumann said. "The FAA has been adamant that we regulate
aviation, not the states."</TE>
<TE>   Legislation is pending in Congress that would direct the FAA to review
enrollment practices at flight schools and tell them to refuse
instruction to students deemed a threat.</TE>
<TE>   At least eight of the 19 hijackers Sept. 11 had some pilot training.
Most trained in Florida; others took lessons in the San Diego and Phoenix
areas.</TE>
<TE>   Pilots and flight schools oppose state regulation of the industry,
saying it could add a confusing layer of bureaucracy.</TE>

<DL>LITTLE ROCK, Ark.
</DL>
<LD>A jury cannot deliver its final verdict and then reconvene outside
the courtroom and change its mind, the state Supreme Court ruled
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "Once the jury has been discharged and has left the presence of the
court, it is without power to correct or amend its verdict," Justice
Donald L. Corbin wrote.</LD>
<LD>   Corbin was ruling on a case involving a couple who sued the former
owners of their home claiming they had to pay for costly repairs.</LD>
<TE>   Since the lawsuit was filed in 2000--more than five years after John
and Carol Mills bought the home--a jury ruled in favor of the defendants,
Robert and Barbara Spears, and said no damages were due because the
statute of limitations had passed.</TE>
<TE>   Both parties declined to have the jury polled and jurors were
dismissed. Minutes later, the bailiff notified the court that the jury
was back in the jury room and that the foreman had told him jurors felt
they may have misunderstood the interrogatory pertaining to damages.</TE>
<TE>   The trial judge then polled jurors and found that 10 of the 12 said
the verdict read earlier into the record was not their verdict. The court
allowed the jury to reconvene and the Mills were awarded $5,900 in
damages.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON

<LD>Homeland Security chief Tom Ridge says the Bush administration,
concerned about the nation's food supply, is looking at making a single
federal agency responsible for keeping deadly toxins out of everything
from beef to broccoli.</LD>
<LD>   The current system has resulted in bizarre divisions of responsibility
for food safety between the Food and Drug Administration and the
Agriculture Department.</LD>
<LD>   The FDA, for example, is responsible for cheese pizza and the
Agriculture Department for pepperoni pizza. The department is responsible
for open-face sandwiches, FDA for closed-face. In some plants, department
inspectors have been barred by company officials from acting on problems
found in products regulated by the FDA.</LD>
<TE>   "We have to see whether the system that has developed over the past
two decades is the one we need in the future," Ridge told food industry
officials at a conference Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA, which is responsible for safeguarding nearly all foods except
meat and poultry, has only a fraction of the inspection staff that the
USDA has, and weaker legal authority. The FDA has about 750 inspectors to
check 55,000 food plants nationwide. The Agriculture Department has 10
times as many inspectors for 6,000 meat processors.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the questions we need to answer is . . . whether or not we
need multiple agencies dealing with food safety responsibilities," Ridge
said.</TE>
<TE>   Congress would have to approve any merger.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer advocates and the supermarket industry long have pushed for
creation of a single food agency. But food makers have resisted, and
officials in the two agencies are also reluctant to lose any power. Even
the idea of giving the FDA more staff and legal authority, to bring it up
to par with the Agriculture Department, is unpopular with segments of the
food industry.</TE>
<TE>   Ridge assured food industry officials that they would be consulted as
the administration considers consolidating the inspection system.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly Johnston, executive vice president of government affairs for the
National Food Processors Assn., said any merger now would be "very
disruptive" to the industry, given the heightened concern about security.</TE>
<TE>   "Before we embark on a radical restructuring of the food safety
agencies, we should be absolutely convinced that there is no better way
to proceed," said Manly Molpus, president of the Grocery Manufacturers of
America.</TE>
<TE>   The General Accounting Office told Congress last fall that the
terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 made it more imperative than ever to
consolidate the inspection agencies.</TE>

<HD>Priest-Physicist Polkinghorne Wins Templeton Religion Prize</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John C. Polkinghorne, a British mathematical physicist and Anglican
priest whose popular writings on reconciling religion and science have
helped propel the boom of public interest in the field, was named winner
of the 2002 Templeton Prize on Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The $1-million religion award is the world's largest annual monetary
prize awarded to an individual. It was created in 1972 by Sir John
Templeton, a global investor who wanted to offer a prize exceeding the
Nobels to underscore his belief in the importance of advances in
spiritual discoveries.</LD>
<LD>   Polkinghorne, 71, calls himself a "two-eyed scientist-theologian" who
needs both the scientific lens to study the processes of the world and
the religious one to understand whether they have divine meaning and
purpose.</LD>
<TE>   "I've tried to take both religion and science seriously and try to see
them as complementary to each other and not rivals," he said in an
interview from New York, where the prize was awarded. "The most important
thing that they have in common is that both believe there is truth to be
sought and found."</TE>
<TE>   He argues that evolution and the "Big Bang" theory of the origin of
the universe are compatible with belief in God as creator and that evil,
disease and suffering can be explained as the inevitable result of a
God-given freedom for "creation to make itself." But he says "the jury is
still out" on such theories as "intelligent design," whose advocates
assert that creation's complexity can only be explained as the work of a
purposeful designer.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the study of religion and science has taken off as a
hot field of intellectual inquiry. The interest has fueled a spate of new
magazines on the topic, such as "Science and Spirit," books on the
"biology of belief" and other popular topics, and a plethora of college
courses at institutions including Princeton and UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Polkinghorne's voluminous writings on the topic--along with
Templeton's financial support of related research--have helped propel the
burgeoning interest. The priest has written more than 20 books, including
his first foray into the subject nearly two decades ago, "The Way the
World Is," on how a thinking person can be a Christian. He says he views
his most important work as "The Faith of a Physicist," published in 1994,
which defends the rationality of believing in the resurrection of Christ
and other tenets of the Nicene Creed.</TE>
<TE>   Polkinghorne attended the University of Cambridge, where he earned an
undergraduate degree in mathematics and advanced degrees in quantum field
theory and theoretical elementary particle physics. He became a professor
of mathematical physics at Cambridge, mentoring a generation of
physicists exploring the mysteries of subatomic matter. His models for
measuring the trajectory of fast-moving subatomic particles using the
theory of relativity are considered his most significant scientific
contributions.</TE>
<TE>   In 1979, at age 49, Polkinghorne suddenly decided to switch gears. He
resigned his teaching post, began theological studies at Westcott House
in Cambridge and was ordained an Anglican priest in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   After two years as a parish priest, he accepted an invitation to
return to Cambridge as dean of Trinity Hall and became president of
Queen's College, Cambridge, three years later. He retired in 1996 and was
knighted by Queen Elizabeth II the next year.</TE>

<HD>Senate Rejects Plan to Require More Use of Renewable Energy</HD>
<DH>Environment: Measure focused on such sources as solar and wind
power. Advocates now hope a less-ambitious bill passes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Senate on Thursday rejected a measure to require that 20% of
the nation's electricity be produced from renewable sources such as solar
and wind power by 2020, dealing environmentalists their latest defeat on
energy policy.</LD>
<LD>   The action came a day after the Senate, as it debates legislation
focusing on a variety of energy issues, refused to set tougher
fuel-efficiency standards for cars, SUVs and other vehicles.</LD>
<LD>   The measure on renewable energy sources, sponsored by Sen. James M.
Jeffords (I-Vt.), was soundly defeated, 70 to 29.</LD>
<TE>   Currently, less than 2% of the nation's electricity is generated from
such sources. The bulk of electricity is produced from coal, nuclear
power and natural gas.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the Jeffords' proposal, including the utility industry,
warned that the 20% standard could not be achieved without causing
dramatic electricity price increases.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists said they are still hopeful that senators in coming
days will approve a less ambitious measure requiring that 10% of
electricity be produced from renewable sources by 2020, which is now a
part of the proposed comprehensive energy bill.</TE>
<TE>   League of Conservation Voters spokesman Scott Stoermer said that, for
environmentalists, the proposal is the "only meaningful part of the bill
that's left."</TE>
<TE>   Senate Democrats have patterned the 10% measure after a law in Texas,
signed by President Bush when he was governor, in hopes of attracting GOP
support.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to produce the first comprehensive energy bill in a
decade--one of Bush's domestic priorities--continue at a sluggish pace. A
threatened filibuster by Democrats over Bush's proposal to open up the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling means that a
final Senate vote on the energy bill may not occur until April. That
provision has already been included in the House-passed energy bill.</TE>
<TE>   Whether any legislation ultimately will be sent to Bush remains
uncertain. The GOP-controlled House approved an energy bill in August.
But the Democratic-run Senate is considering a far different measure, one
that will be difficult to reconcile with the House version.</TE>
<TE>   In Thursday's debate, Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) argued that the effort to
significantly increase the amount of electricity generated from renewable
sources would result in a "huge transfer of wealth" from states "that
aren't blessed with a lot of wind and sun" to those that are.</TE>
<TE>   He accused lawmakers of "picking and choosing between politically
correct fuels and those that aren't politically correct."</TE>
<TE>   A coalition of groups, including the Edison Electric Institute,
National Mining Assn. and Nuclear Energy Institute, warned in a letter to
senators, "Simply imposing an unreasonably large, federally mandated
requirement to generate electricity from renewables will not guarantee
that enough windmills and other renewable facilities can be built on
schedule [or] that the wind will cooperate."</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of the measure argued it would diversify the nation's
energy mix while reducing emissions, including those blamed for global
warming.</TE>
<TE>   "It is unconscionable to continue to shackle ourselves to fuels that
dirty our air and water and compromise our national security," Jeffords
said.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, 14 states require that a percentage of their electricity
comes from renewable sources. In California, legislation has been
introduced to increase renewable energy sources from the roughly 10% of
electricity today to 20% by 2010.</TE>
<TE>   California's Democratic Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein
supported the Jeffords measure.</TE>

<HD>Justice Calls Disability Act Flawed</HD>
<DH>Law: O'Connor says a hasty Congress left landmark public-access
statute too vague.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor sounded off on the
country's leading law protecting the rights of the disabled Thursday,
telling a conference of business lawyers that the high court has been
obliged to wrestle with a heavy load of disability rights cases because
the 1990 act was drafted too hastily by Congress.</LD>
<LD>   The Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) is an example of what
happens when a bill's "sponsors are so eager to get something passed that
what passes hasn't been as carefully written as a group of law professors
might put together," O'Connor said at an annual meeting of the Corporate
Counsel Institute at Georgetown University Law Center.</LD>
<LD>   "That act is one of those that did leave uncertainties as to what
Congress had in mind," she said.</LD>
<TE>   The ADA prohibits discrimination against disabled people at work and
in public accommodations, requiring employers and others to make
"reasonable accommodations," such as wheelchair ramps.</TE>
<TE>   On the court, O'Connor has supported its public-accommodations
provisions but voted to rein in claims of job discrimination under the
act, most recently in Toyota vs. Williams, a case this term in which she
wrote an opinion for the court holding that the ADA was not meant to
cover an auto worker whose carpal tunnel syndrome made it impossible for
her to work on an assembly line but left her able to do chores around the
house. The case was decided by a 9-0 vote.</TE>
<TE>   Two more cases related to the ADA have been argued this term and
decisions are pending, prompting O'Connor to remark that it could be
"remembered as the disabilities act term."</TE>
<TE>   O'Connor's remarks were an implicit rebuttal to criticism of her
Toyota opinion by one of the ADA's original sponsors.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Legislation to limit campaign spending moves to the Senate floor
today, after a decision by Republican opponents to the bill to remove one
legislative hurdle.</LD>
<LD>   "I appreciate at least this progress," Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle (D-S.D.) said after opponents agreed Thursday to dispense with a
planned vote on whether to proceed to the bill.</LD>
<LD>   A final vote on the measure, which would bring about the most
significant changes in a quarter of a century in how campaigns are
financed, could come as early as Wednesday. Passage would send the bill
to President Bush, who has indicated he would sign it.</LD>
<TE>   The legislation originally passed the Senate in April on a 59-41 vote;
it was approved by the House last month in a slightly altered version.
The Senate must vote on the House version.</TE>
<TE>   The bill bans the hundreds of millions of dollars that corporations,
unions and individuals give to the national political parties in
unregulated "soft money." It also restricts in the final days before an
election the "issue ads" that often indirectly attack candidates. It
raises the limit of regulated "hard money" that goes directly to
campaigns and candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents, who say the restrictions on contributions violate 1st
Amendment free speech rights, acknowledge that they are in the minority.
But under Senate rules it can take 60 votes to move a bill to the Senate
floor and 60 votes to close off debate so a bill can move to a final
vote.</TE>
<TE>   Several senators who voted against the bill last year have said they
would not stand in the way of a final vote. "I am not overconfident, but
I am confident" of securing the needed 60 votes, said Sen. Russell D.
Feingold (D-Wis.), chief sponsor of the legislation, with Sen. John
McCain (R-Ariz.).</TE>

<HD>Firm May Have Shipped Unsterilized Medical Tools, FDA Warns</HD>
<DH>Health care: Problem may date to 1999, but no resulting injuries
have been reported.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Food and Drug Administration warned Thursday that a Georgia
medical supply company may have been shipping unsterilized obstetrics and
gynecology equipment since 1999, creating the "potential of causing death
and serious injury such as infection, infertility and miscarriage."</LD>
<LD>   The company, A &amp; A Medical Inc./Rocket USA, is under investigation for
allegedly manufacturing devices labeled "sterile" that may not have
undergone any sterilization, FDA officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The FDA told health-care professionals and consumers to "immediately"
stop distributing and using products from the Alpharetta, Ga.-based
company, which also uses the name LifeQuest.</LD>
<TE>   The FDA, however, was unable to say Thursday how many unsterile
devices may have been shipped or where they had been sent. A &amp; A Medical
Inc. has less than $10 million in annual sales, according to the online
InfoUSA directory.</TE>
<TE>   Jihad Mansour, who is listed as the quality assurance officer for A &amp;
A Medical Inc., refused to comment when reached at his Georgia home
Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   "I have nothing to tell you," Mansour said.</TE>
<TE>   FDA officials said they were not aware of any injuries caused by use
of the company's medical devices, which include curets used to take
tissue samples, uterine dilators and harvesting pumps used in in-vitro
fertilization.</TE>
<TE>   FDA officials said they were tipped off by former employees that the
company was shipping unsterilized equipment internationally.</TE>
<TE>   Kathleen Kolar, an FDA spokeswoman, said that some of the products
manufactured and shipped by the company had been sterilized while others
had not.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is this product will be removed from the market as
soon as possible whether the company follows our urging to voluntarily
recall it or if we have to take further steps," Kolar said.</TE>
<TE>   FDA investigators went to the company's plant after a whistle-blower
came forward in recent days, and they found reason to warn the public and
the medical community immediately, Kolar said.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's warning was in the form of an "alert" rather than an
official recall, which requires more formal steps.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA has been under fire recently for not acting aggressively
enough to protect consumers from faulty medical devices. The FDA had to
step up the investigation into a defective bronchoscope made by Olympus
America of Melville, N.Y., after it became clear that doctors were
continuing to use the $12,000 device more than three months after it had
been recalled by its manufacturer.</TE>
<TE>   The additional effort came after officials at Johns Hopkins University
revealed that two patients who had undergone bronchoscopies, which allow
the doctor to examine the lung, had died after the recall notice was
misdirected.</TE>
<TE>   The manufacturer, in that instance, issued a recall in November, two
months after being warned by an epidemiologist that the device might
resist disinfection between uses. After Johns Hopkins went public with
its problem, hospital officials in a number of states complained that the
recall information had been unevenly distributed and an unknown number of
doctors may never have been alerted to stop using Olympus devices.</TE>
<TE>   Health-care experts said news that a medical device manufacturer may
have knowingly mislabeled equipment as sterile was disturbing.</TE>
<TE>   "These supplies come in very clearly labeled sterile, and a hospital
would have no reason to question that," said Jan Emerson, a spokeswoman
for the California Healthcare Assn., which represents nearly 500
hospitals. "This is alarming not just to hospitals but to patients and
the public. You put your faith and your trust in the people you contract
with for your supplies."</TE>

<HD>2 Die After Organ Transplants</HD>
<DH>Health: A parasitic disease previously confined to Latin America
was the cause.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA
</DL>
<LD>Three transplant patients contracted a dangerous parasitic disease
from their new organs in the first such documented cases in the United
States, the government said Thursday. Two of the three women died.</LD>
<LD>   A second study also released by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention turned up 26 bacterial infections traced to tissue grafts that
had come from cadavers in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   The CDC said the graft-related infections show an urgent need to
update federal regulations and industry standards for preventing
contamination.</LD>
<TE>   In the report involving the parasitic disease, all of the organs came
from the cadaver of a Central American immigrant who was apparently
infected with T. cruzi. The parasite causes Chagas' disease, which was
previously confined to Latin America. The disease can cause heart
irregularities.</TE>
<TE>   The CDC said it was consulting with transplant organizations
nationwide to decide whether to start screening for T. cruzi.</TE>
<TE>   The disease was detected in all three women, but only one recovered
after antibiotic treatment.</TE>
<TE>   A 37-year-old who received a pancreas and kidney died in October, a
32-year-old who received a liver died in July and a 69-year-old who
received the other kidney is recovering.</TE>
<TE>   The second study, on bacterial infections in tissue graft patients,
was launched in November after a 23-year-old Minnesota man died of an
infection he contracted from cadaver tissue used in surgery.</TE>
<TE>   A 17-year-old Illinois boy became sick after receiving two tissue
grafts from the same donor. That patient is recovering.</TE>
<TE>   Fourteen of the 26 patients received tissue processed by the same
supplier. The CDC did not name the company.</TE>

<HD>Colleges Report Pink Eye Outbreaks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CONCORD, N.H.
</DL>
<LD>Hundreds of students at Dartmouth College and Princeton University
have contracted pink eye infections, and experts fear the outbreak could
spread during spring breaks.</LD>
<LD>   More than 250 Princeton students have reported symptoms of
conjunctivitis since officials began tracking the infections last month.</LD>
<LD>   At Dartmouth, the number is nearing 500, and another 500 students may
have had the infection and not reported it, said Dr. Jack Turco of
Dartmouth's student health center.</LD>
<TE>   That number is at least five times higher than usual, and the rate
isn't easing as students leave this week for spring break, Turco said.</TE>
<TE>   "Some students are just developing pink eye now. There is a
possibility it will blossom in the different places they go during their
break," Turco said. He urged other schools to watch for signs of the
infection.</TE>
<TE>   Pink eye can cause a pink or red discoloration of the eyes,
irritation, swelling, blurry vision, sticky eyelids and increased
sensitivity to light.</TE>
<TE>   The infection, which can be treated by antibiotic ointment, typically
lasts three to four days and is most often caused by a virus and
accompanied by a cold.</TE>
<TE>   However, the Dartmouth outbreak is bacterial and spreads quickly, and
that has drawn the attention of scientists, Turco said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a serious illness, but if some of the properties of this
bacteria were transferred to a more dangerous bacteria, that would be
dangerous," Turco said.</TE>
<TE>   Tests are being conducted to determine whether the outbreak at
Princeton is bacterial or viral and whether the outbreaks are related.</TE>
<TE>   The Princeton outbreak represents about double what is normally
reported there, said Janet A. Neglia of Princeton University Health
Services.</TE>
<TE>   Pink eye is spread through eye secretions, hands and breath.</TE>

<LD>Tipper Gore is weighing an overture from Democrats to run for her
husband's old Senate seat from Tennessee, sources close to her said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Democrats
urged Mrs. Gore to run after Sen. Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.) announced last
Friday that he will not seek reelection.</LD>
<LD>   Her husband, Al Gore, held the Senate seat from 1985 to 1993, before
becoming vice president. He said he would not run for his old seat.</LD>

<HD>Discovery of Ancient Mayan Mural Excites Scientists</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Disappointed at not finding the stone monuments he sought, a tired
researcher sat down in the jungle shade and accidentally discovered the
oldest known intact wall painting of Maya mythology.</LD>
<LD>   Archeologist William Saturno discovered the 4-foot-long mural, dating
from about AD 100, during research at San Bartolo, a Maya ceremonial site
in Guatemala.</LD>
<LD>   "This painting is among the most important finds in Maya archeology in
the last few decades. It opens a window into the mythological and courtly
life of the ancient Maya during the pre-classic period," said Saturno, a
University of New Hampshire lecturer and research associate at Harvard
University's Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology.</LD>
<TE>   The discovery, made last year, is reported in the April issue of
National Geographic magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Saturno had been looking for some carved stone monuments in the area
and was exhausted after an unexpectedly long three-day trek through the
jungle.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking shade, he sat down in a trench dug by looters seeking goods in
the old Maya site.</TE>
<TE>   He aimed his flashlight into a looter's tunnel.</TE>
<TE>   "I started laughing. There was this Maya mural, a very rare thing. The
looters had cleared off a section and left it. I felt like the luckiest
man on the planet," he said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The mural is in an 80-foot-high pyramid in northern Guatemala. The
site is now under guard to protect it from more looting. Research on the
mural is funded by the National Geographic Society's Committee for
Research and Exploration.</TE>
<TE>   The mural was confirmed as Maya by comparing it with other work by
that civilization. The Maya pre-classic period dates from about 2000 BC
to AD 250. No other early mural of comparable size or condition has been
found, researchers said.</TE>
<TE>   The only previously known paintings from this period are from Tikal,
one of the largest Maya ceremonial and political centers discovered in
Guatemala. National Geographic said the Tikal paintings are not nearly as
extensive or as well-preserved as the newly discovered mural.</TE>
<TE>   Despite years of looting at the site over the last decade, the ruins
at San Bartolo were previously unknown to archeologists.</TE>
<TE>   The site is being studied by a team led by Saturno, David Stuart of
Peabody Museum and Hector Escobedo from Guatemala's Universidad del
Valle. A five-year project to excavate the site and conserve the art gets
underway this year.</TE>
<TE>   Neftali Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for the Guatemalan culture ministry,
said protecting the site is a government priority, and the government
will cooperate with investigations.</TE>
<TE>   The site "is threatened by looters of Mayan archeological sites,"
Gonzalez said. "The complex has suffered looting, digging has been found
and that has caused partial damage," though she said that occurred before
the discovery of the murals in March 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The visible portion of the mural shows a scene with at least nine
portraits. All the people stand or kneel above a border of geometric
designs. The scene is dominated by a standing male figure who strides
toward the viewer's left, looking back over his shoulder at two kneeling
female figures behind him. Behind the women is evidence of at least three
other standing figures.</TE>

<HD>Polio Cases Linked to Lack of Inoculations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSIE MESTEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A recent outbreak of polio in Haiti and the Dominican Republic was
caused by a once-harmless vaccine strain of polio that was able to mutate
back to virulence because most of the children in the region had not been
immunized, according to a new report.</LD>
<LD>   The so-called Sabin oral polio vaccine used in most developing nations
employs weakened strains of three polio viruses to trigger the body's
immune system against the disease. It is usually harmless. But in this
case, particles from one of the viruses apparently mutated and traded
genetic material with a related human virus in a process that enabled the
virus to once again become dangerous.</LD>
<LD>   Because only about 30% of the children younger than 15 in the region
had ever been vaccinated, the illness was able to spread, said Olen Kew,
lead author of the multi-institution report and chief of molecular
virology at the polio lab at the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta.</LD>
<TE>   Ultimately, 20 cases of polio were confirmed, two of them fatal.</TE>
<TE>   The vaccine involved differs from the Salk vaccine, used in the U.S.,
which is made with an inactivated virus. The Salk vaccine is far less
practical for use in mass vaccinations in poor countries because it is
costly and must be injected.</TE>
<TE>   The finding about how the outbreak developed, published in the journal
Science, shows what can happen if countries backslide in their
immunization efforts--even when it appears that the natural,
disease-causing virus has been eradicated from a region, public health
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very well-done study," said Dr. Samuel Katz, professor of
pediatrics at Duke University in Durham, N.C. "It shows that if you have
susceptible children and the vaccine passes from child to child, even the
vaccine virus becomes capable of causing paralysis.</TE>
<TE>   "It means that eradicating polio is going to rely on very, very heavy
immunization in areas that are currently very difficult to reach" because
of poverty, war or civil strife, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Poliomyelitis is an infectious disease caused by a virus that enters
via the mouth, then invades the nervous system. It affects mostly young
children. In 1 of 200 cases, the infection causes permanent paralysis. It
can cause death if the muscles needed for breathing are immobilized.</TE>
<TE>   A global effort to eradicate the virus by 2000 was launched in 1988,
involving large-scale national immunization days in which many children
were vaccinated together.</TE>
<TE>   The number of cases of polio worldwide has dropped by 99% since 1988,
according to the World Health Organization, and the number of countries
where polio viruses are endemic has fallen from 120 to 10. Polio is now
mostly a problem in sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian subcontinent.</TE>
<TE>   The World Health Organization declared the Americas polio-free in
1994. Until the outbreak in Haiti and the Dominican Republic, which
happened in 2000, the last-documented case in the Americas had been of a
child in Peru in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   When the new outbreak occurred, doctors at first feared that the wild
virus had somehow been brought to the island from parts of the world
where it is still endemic.</TE>
<TE>   The truth turned out to be different.</TE>
<TE>   Genetic typing of 31 virus samples tested by the CDC--some from the
patients and others from those who had been in close contact with
them--revealed that the virus was most closely related to one of the
three weakened viruses used in the vaccine.</TE>
<TE>   But while closely related, the viruses weren't identical--as if they
had originated from the vaccine but had somehow accumulated changes.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those changes had randomly occurred over time through mistakes
in the copying of the virus as it spread from person to person.</TE>
<TE>   Other changes appear to have come from a back-and-forth trade of
chunks of genetic material between the vaccine virus and related,
gut-dwelling viruses called enteroviruses.</TE>
<TE>   The end result was a restoration of the virus' ability to spread and
cause disease.</TE>
<TE>   Similar outbreaks traced to partial vaccination occurred in the
Philippines and Egypt in the last several years, underscoring the danger
of vaccinating only part of the population, researchers said.</TE>

<LD>State revenues--A headline on a story about technology sector
losses in Saturday's California section inaccurately characterized a
state official's comments about the effect of declining personal incomes
on state revenues. Although Howard L. Roth, chief economist for the state
Department of Finance, said the drop in stock option income has led to a
decline in total personal income, he didn't say the Treasury would be
"depleted."</LD>
