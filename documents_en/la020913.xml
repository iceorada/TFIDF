<HD>An Understated Ice Cube Presides Over Wise 'Barbershop'</HD>
<DH>With humor and authenticity, the film celebrates a
gathering place in the African American community.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Barbershop" is as warm as it is wise, deftly setting off uproarious
humor with an underlying seriousness that sneaks up on the viewer,
providing an experience that is richer than anticipated.</LD>
<LD>   A lively and endearing cast is headed by Ice Cube, in an
impressively understated performance as Calvin, the hard-pressed
proprietor of a Chicago barbershop.</LD>
<LD>   From his late father, Calvin inherited the barbershop that his
grandfather opened in 1958. The shop was never very profitable, and
in his eagerness to get ahead, Calvin has eaten up his meager savings
in desperate get-rich-quick schemes. Facing foreclosure, he gets
serious about selling the business.</LD>
<TE>   The barbershop, however, is a community institution like countless
others in old black neighborhoods across the country. It is a
gathering place for African American males of all generations. Eddie
(Cedric the Entertainer), a barber whose tenure at the shop spans
decades, says the barbershop is "our own country club ... the one
place we can talk straight."</TE>
<TE>   Eddie is intent on instilling pride in being a barber in his
younger colleagues: "A haircut can change the way a man feels about
himself." He's also a motormouth who exercises his right to free
speech hilariously, spouting outrageous opinions about black icons
with the wit and timing that made Cedric such a standout in the
concert film "The Original Kings of Comedy."</TE>
<TE>   By the time Eddie has raised Calvin's consciousness about the
shop, it may be too late. What Calvin does next reveals writers Mark
Brown, Don D. Scott and Marshall Todd to be as clever at plotting as
they are in evoking the human comedy the barbershop denizens bring to
vivid life under Tim Story's loving, well-paced direction.</TE>
<TE>   Ice Cube's Calvin is a young man capable of reflection who has yet
to realize how like his father and grandfather he actually is. He is
a skilled peacekeeper among his barbers, calming down rap star Eve's
Terri, who's forever complaining that someone's drinking her apple
juice and is chronically edgy over her handsome boyfriend's flagrant
infidelity.</TE>
<TE>   Equally hyper is Sean Patrick Thomas' Jimmy, a college student,
barber and condescending know-it-all who especially resents the
presence of a young white guy, Troy Garity's affable Isaac, who
simply appreciates Calvin's giving him an opportunity to learn his
trade.</TE>
<TE>   Calvin's instinctive, laid-back inclusiveness extends to Michael
Ealy's likable but moody Ricky, a two-time loser desperately trying
to stay straight, and to a neighboring shopkeeper, a native of India
(Parvesh Cheena).</TE>
<TE>   Providing a consistently funny running gag are Anthony Anderson
and Lahmard Tate as inept crooks who have made off with an ATM
machine and don't know what to do with it. Jazsmin Lewis is Calvin's
loyal but plain-speaking wife, and Keith David is the local loan
shark (and chop-shop operator), a sharp vision in powder blue with a
vintage Lincoln Continental to match.</TE>
<TE>   Exemplifying the care with which this film is made is production
designer Roger Fortune's barbershop, a spacious, worn but inviting
place virtually unchanged since its opening. Modeled after Terrell's
Afro Barber Shop on Chicago's North Side and the Victory Barber Shop
in Harlem, the barbershop is authentic down to its last period
detail. Calvin's Barbershop fits right into the Chicago locales
captured with a gritty grace by cinematographer Tom Priestley.</TE>
<TE>   "Barbershop" celebrates the pleasures of a precious, surely often
endangered communal retreat that many predominantly white
neighborhoods lost long ago in the flight to the suburbs but which
endure in the city.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for language, sexual content and brief drug
references. Times guidelines: The film is suitable for older teens.</TE>

<HD>Actor Relives His Descent in 'Quitting'</HD>
<DH>The daring drama has a Chinese star portraying his own
struggle with heroin and his relatives playing themselves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Zhang Yang's "Quitting" begins, a young man with long hair parted
in the middle looks straight into the camera over a soundtrack of
rumors concerning what happened to the popular star Jia Hongsheng,
who seemed to have disappeared in the mid-'90s.</LD>
<LD>   There is a flood of clips, mainly from action films, of Jia, who
proves to be the young man looking out from the screen.</LD>
<LD>   In the late '80s Jia became known as the "thug idol" of the
Chinese screen for his appearances in a series of B-movies.</LD>
<TE>   In frustration, he turned to the stage in 1992 to star in an
acclaimed stage version of "The Kiss of the Spider Woman," which
Zhang Yang directed the same year he graduated from Jia's alma mater,
Beijing's Central Theater Academy.</TE>
<TE>   The young actor found himself in demand for important movies but
became increasingly caught up in drugs. (Recently, however, he
starred in the striking noir film "Suzhou River.")</TE>
<TE>   The intense Jia commenced his four-year downward spiral during
rehearsals for "Spider Woman." Ah Bin, set designer for the play--and
art director for "Quitting"--introduced Jia to marijuana as a way to
relax.</TE>
<TE>   Jia reacted to the drug strongly but, instead of turning away from
drugs, began smoking heroin.</TE>
<TE>   After watching himself give what he regarded as a terrible
performance in a TV period melodrama, Jia quit acting and retreated
to his spacious but derelict Beijing apartment, shared with his
despairing sister Wang Tong, who supported them.</TE>
<TE>   In the harrowing saga of Jia's fall and struggle to recover, he
and everyone else in his life, amazingly, play themselves, reliving
seven years in their lives.</TE>
<TE>   Zhang spent several years interviewing all those who appear on the
screen and developing a script (with Huo Xin).</TE>
<TE>   In Jia Hongsheng, Zhang sees a talented and essentially serious
young man reacting to the seismic changes in Chinese society in the
wake of events at Tiananmen Square and the advent of a free market
society. "Quitting" gets underway with the arrival in Beijing of his
father and mother, Jia Fengsen and Chai Xiurong, veteran members of
an acting troupe in a small town in northeastern China. They know of
their moody and hostile son's substance abuse problems and have
decided to tackle them head-on.</TE>
<TE>   The father begins to think he's making some progress in
communicating with his son, only to be faced with the full extent of
the problem. (Curiously, the film doesn't indicate how Jia obtained
hard drugs and how he could afford them.)</TE>
<TE>   Zhang pulls back the camera a couple of times to reveal that the
Beijing apartment is actually a set on a stage in a theater. Far from
making the subject seem artificial, it sets off the sense of reality
with which the people are playing themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Zhang could not have pulled off this film were Jia not prepared
both to look inward and to open himself up freely. It helps that the
three central figures, Jia and his parents, are professionals. The
image of the apartment set inhabited by the family becomes a point of
reference for Zhang's moving back and forth over seven years.</TE>
<TE>   "Quitting" is Zhang's third feature and, like "Shower," his
second, it explores the challenges of a loving parent-child
relationship, although structurally and thematically "Quitting" is
more daring and complex. At 112 minutes, it might be 15 minutes too
long, but this is not enough to detract from its impact as a probing
and universal contemporary drama.</TE>
<TE>   MPPA rating: R, for strong drug use. Times guidelines: also strong
drinking, mature themes.</TE>

<HD>Heartening Response to Disaster in '7 Days'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If ever there was a prime example of art bringing order out of chaos,
it is Steven Rosenbaum's "7 Days in September." Drawing from the
footage of 27 filmmakers, professionals and amateurs, Rosenbaum has
told the story of 9/11 and the first week of its aftermath through
their footage and their memories, which he recorded in interviews
some time after the event. The result is a narrative at once
personal, admirably coherent and, above all, heartening. Ironically,
amid spiraling tragedy, the film shows individuals experiencing a
sense of exhilaration as they hurl themselves into the recovery
process, that feeling to be replaced with the chronic sense of unease
and uncertainly that today grips the country.</LD>
<LD>   If watching the twin towers of the World Trade Center explode and
crumble yet another time is to risk being numbed by images of the
worst attack on the United States since Pearl Harbor, this film
counters that dread with a stirring record of how swiftly and
selflessly New Yorkers came together. That residents and workers of
Manhattan and beyond rose to the occasion magnificently is by now
legend, yet to see this phenomenon emerge and spread out before us as
it was occurring is awe-inspiring.</LD>
<TE>   The instant the first and then second plane struck the towers,
ordinary citizens as well as the police and fire departments and
other official agencies began reaching out to each other in their
horror and shock. In the immediate aftermath of the towers'
disintegration, the smoke and debris are so thick that people on the
streets struggle to get their bearings, while passengers emerge from
subway stations not knowing what has happened, only to find that some
kind of terrible disaster has struck.</TE>
<TE>   As time swiftly passes, the shock of the destruction's magnitude
sets in and gives way to concern for the victims and a sense of the
probable enormity of the death toll. By Thursday, two days after the
disaster, public spaces are filled with relatives carrying signs and
photographs of missing loved ones, and walls are being covered with
the same pleas and pictures. People are buying American flags as fast
as possible in an expression of unity, and an amazing array of
operations are underway to answer the need for blood donors and
supplies and services of all kinds.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the formidable task of rescue and recovery is going
forward at ground zero. Although the area is sealed off, documentary
filmmaker Gary Pollard, a major contributor to the film, found that
unexpectedly, he could shoot freely in the off-limits of the
deserted, hazy canyons of skyscrapers adjacent to the World Trade
Center site. A firefighter from Baltimore, Jim Goetz is able to shoot
the rubble of the towers up close, showing with unique force the
enormity of the task ahead and how slim the chance of survival is
amid the monumental wreckage.</TE>
<TE>   As the week passes and Wall Street reopens as a key symbol of New
York rousing itself back to normality, Rosenbaum counterpoints the
broad outline of each step of the way with an array of telling
details captured by himself and the other 26 videographers. Jennifer
Spell, whose Brooklyn apartment had a wonderful view of the twin
towers, shows us an intact document from the devastated firm of
Cantor Fitzgerald that had floated to her doorstep. On a busy
Manhattan street corner, pedestrians stop to notice a sparrow
wandering around on the sidewalk, ascertain that it is not injured
and conclude that it is as "dazed and confused as we are."</TE>
<TE>   The finest moment in "7 Days in September" may well be when on
Saturday a large group of people gather in Union Square in a grand
exercise of freedom of expression as hawks and doves argue over what
America's response should be to the attack. A young American man,
exclaiming his willingness to die for his country, gets into a
shouting match with a young European woman who insists that war is
not the answer. Angry frustration spent at last and overcome with
emotion, the young man spontaneously embraces the European and her
friend.</TE>
<TE>   What was really happening with the attack on the World Trade
Center, one of the filmmakers observes, was that the fabric of New
York was being tested and that it had held.</TE>

<HD>Memory's True Voice Is Rich in Emotion</HD>
<DH>The elusive quest for the thrilling sounds once heard from
vinyl records might as well require a time machine.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN G. ARTNER</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the last few months I've been engaged in chasing after a quality
of sound that, at times, seems to be only in my head.</LD>
<LD>   Musicians know the frustration of inwardly hearing a sound they
cannot elicit from others or create themselves. Conductor Arturo
Toscanini threw tantrums, once nearly putting out the eye of a
violinist who did not realize the sound he wanted, and Wilhelm
Furtwangler so regularly spat on unresponsive players during
rehearsals that some talked of getting umbrellas.</LD>
<LD>   I felt such frustration as a piano student when the touch giving
the right sound failed me, which was often. That happened decades
ago, and I did not expect another flare-up; my piano long has stood,
getting more and more out of tune, with keyboard covered. But
recently an ailing old CD player expired, and the aftermath brought
back disagreeable emotion.</LD>
<TE>   The CD player was replaced months ago. I have since auditioned
many other pieces of equipment, with so much craving and so little
satisfaction that I'm desperate for a fix and have considered
spending an appalling amount of money to get it. The other day I
caught myself looking over plane and train schedules for trips to
Amherst, Mass., and Vestal, N.Y. My aural nirvana was said to be in
the one place or the other.</TE>
<TE>   I may as well have made a reservation on a time machine, as I'm
trying to recapture a sound I first heard long ago, when a child.</TE>
<TE>   Then it came from vinyl records that thrilled me beyond imagining.
Compact discs made me sick from the start. They denied the qualities
that hooked me on classical music. A warm, plush, velvety string
tone, for example, produces in me physiological changes like nothing
else. To trigger those changes at will was, I know, what kept me
returning to recorded music.</TE>
<TE>   I began to collect LPs because the tone created in certain
performances effected more changes than did others. It was that
simple. The strength of my experience came equally from quality of
tone and how that tone was employed in the tension and release of
music.</TE>
<TE>   I did not know at the time, but the performers who most stimulated
me--Leopold Stokowski, Clifford Curzon, David Oistrakh, Mstislav
Rostropovich--were all great colorists. Color gives character to
music by conveying shades of feeling.</TE>
<TE>   Recorded and live sound are, of course, different. But once I
began to hear concerts by the artists I admired, they substantiated
the character of the artists' recorded tones, which was as personal
as a fingerprint.</TE>
<TE>   I've gone to concerts regularly--meaning weekly, and for a time,
several each week--for almost 40 years, hearing all the performers
whose recordings I collected. So although most of the artists are now
dead, their individual tonal characteristics still are with me,
having been imprinted by records, reinforced by concerts and
reconfirmed by concert tapes, many of the same events I attended.</TE>
<TE>   My first CD player, an expensive one for 1984, immediately sent me
into withdrawal by reducing all colors--which is to say, the artists'
tonal personalities--to a range of gray and reproducing them coldly
like brushed aluminum. All the players I heard did that, but the
gleam sounded brighter at my house because of an earlier switch from
a tube receiver to one of solid state. More than 20 years ago, next
to nobody acknowledged the difference in sound between them, and for
some who did, a loss of radiance was made up for by a gain in
clarity.</TE>
<TE>   I did not have much hope, then, for a new player. It would be
mainly to hear discs by current performers too good to abandon. Yet
because for decades I have purchased electronics from a man who is as
much therapist as audio dealer, I was overtaken by a rush of
agreeable sensation from his first recommendation and, tears
streaming down my face, found myself responding to discs I had given
up for barely presenting shadows of a true aural experience.</TE>
<TE>   There began the trouble.</TE>
<TE>   If certain artists could be reclaimed from CDs, might I also get
more of them from the 15,000 LPs that had their tone hardened by my
receiver? The next step was clear: Find a pre-amplifier to be used
only with the CD player and first-rate headphones. Then it would be
easy to work upward from its warming effect to an amplifier with like
qualities and, if necessary, new speakers.</TE>
<TE>   On the way, the people I've met speak largely in initials and
numbers, comparing, for example, the C42 to the 385, with an
occasional whisper of the MC2105. Collectors say I can get the sound
I want from vintage equipment of the 1960s. Audiophiles say
technology today cannot be bettered. Gadgeteers say I should buy a
machine to vacuum the interference from electricity that is dirtier
now than it was in the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   For a while, the collectors held sway. To attempt to reproduce the
string tone once heard from Stokowski records--I have 760 of them--I
tracked down a version of the receiver I had when his LPs made on me
their greatest impression. And--ah-ha!--there the sound still was, as
affectingly sensuous as my nervous system had remembered. How did I
not remember that winds and brass and percussion were rough, as if
forced through a sieve, and became scrambled behind a muffler
whenever music got loud?</TE>
<TE>   In sound reproduction, as in everything else, it seems you can't
go home again. But I'm not giving up. This is not about nostalgia.
The sound--which, after all, is an agent of ecstasy--exists.</TE>

<HD>Facing Mortality With Mischief Rather Than Tears</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFF BOUCHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The dying cancer patient with a dark, dry wit met one of his doctors
for breakfast last week and handed over his two most recent CDs, one
titled "Life'll Kill Ya" and the other "My Ride's Here." In his
familiar baritone, Warren Zevon explained the gifts to the physician:
"These are my last two albums. Maybe now you'll understand that eerie
acceptance of death you keep asking me about."</LD>
<LD>   Zevon chuckled at the account and then paused to catch his breath.
Last month, doctors told the 55-year-old musician that he has
inoperable cancer in both lungs. The prognosis is bleak, with his
time measured in weeks or perhaps months. Zevon is the rocker who
defined the volatile edge of the famed singer-songwriter scene of
1970s Los Angeles with his wild, vodka-fueled living and songs of
morbid humor, and now he finds himself facing the very unfunny fact
of his own mortality.</LD>
<LD>   And, of course, he finds irresistible humor in that.</LD>
<TE>   "Really, the thing I want is to last through the winter so I don't
miss the new James Bond movie," he said Wednesday by phone from his
home in West Hollywood. "And I want to wear sweaters, a scarf, the
overcoat, the whole thing, like a Winona Ryder movie. And I can be
this miserable, classic Walter Matthau invalid. Not that I haven't
been that before.... "</TE>
<TE>   That sort of riff will come as no surprise to longtime fans of the
iconoclastic cult hero, who pals around with sardonic authors Hunter
S. Thompson and Carl Hiaasen and tapped David Letterman and Irish
poet Paul Muldoon for contributions on his last album.</TE>
<TE>   Zevon's songbook is packed with bizarre character
sketches--prom-date killers, rehab-center divas, jubilant crack
dealers, mercenaries, murdered clowns and dangerous dogs--that are
for neither the politically correct nor the meek.</TE>
<TE>   Casual pop fans might not be able to name a Zevon record beyond
his quirky 1978 horror-show hit "Werewolves of London," or perhaps
"Excitable Boy" and "Lawyers, Guns and Money," from the same year.
But he's been a fascinating character on the L.A. scene and, like
Randy Newman, a master of subversive song craft.</TE>
<TE>   His longtime friend Jackson Browne said Thursday that Zevon's
music is defined by its bravery and candor.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a standard-bearer; he's very adventurous and there's a
confidence and power that translates to effectiveness," said Browne,
producer of two Zevon albums in the '70s. "There's a literacy, not
just of words but also an emotional literacy. The coin of that realm
is honesty and vulnerability. But then, you know, there's a berserk
quality to the whole thing when it's done."</TE>
<TE>   "Berserk" is a word that was often used to describe Zevon in his
younger years. Like gonzo writer Thompson, the Chicago-born
musician's view of an artist's life was something along the lines of
parachuting while drunk and blindfolded.</TE>
<TE>   "He is among the wildest people I've ever met," Browne said. "I
always remember him just tearing off into the night in Morocco one
time, drunk, by himself. For him, it was all about trials by fire."</TE>
<TE>   Zevon left that life behind two decades ago, and the singer
describes himself now as a better performer, a far superior father
and a much-improved driver.</TE>
<TE>   In a grim twist that could fit into one of his songs, in the past
year Zevon has been a gym rat ("I was working out more than Vin
Diesel," he says) and assumed that his shortness of breath and the
tightness in his chest were side effects of his regimen.</TE>
<TE>   "But then I knew it was bad when the doctor came in with the CAT
scan in his hand, closed the door and gave me a glass of water and
said, 'I need to tell you something.' "</TE>
<TE>   When Zevon turned to a sober life, he made a public announcement
that he did not want to die by drink, which he described as a
coward's death. That was a time before the celebrity mea culpa was
fashionable, but Zevon's proclamation then is similar to his new
announcement, via press release on Thursday, about his health. Zevon
explained during Wednesday's interview that he took that approach to
define as much as possible the terms of his own life and death.</TE>
<TE>   And what are the terms of the moment? Family and music, he says,
as well as watching lots of Steve McQueen movies and shoveling down
eggs and bacon. "That's what I eat. Every meal. It's fantastic."</TE>
<TE>   Zevon was married twice but is now single. His adult children,
Jordan and Ariel, are in Southern California now, and the singer said
he hopes to pack his days with them and maybe even make it out for a
fishing trip, one of his beloved pursuits. Next week, though, Zevon
plans to be in the recording studio. Long known as a methodical,
less-than-prolific artist, Zevon is now in a different gear.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been working frantically," he said. "But you know, imminent
doom lowers the bar a bit."</TE>
<TE>   If the trips to the studio are too taxing, Zevon has at his
disposal an elaborate nest of recording gear set up within feet of
his bed. "That's thanks to Danny Goldberg," he said, a nod to the
chief of Zevon's label, Artemis Records. "He is the absolute best."</TE>
<TE>   Zevon declined to offer any hints about the new songs, but he said
fans should not anticipate material of moist eyes or long, distant
stares. "You needn't look for a great deal more of piety. I have a
little mischief in mind."</TE>
<TE>   Zevon's career of a dozen albums that began with 1969's "Wanted:
Dead or Alive" is also about to be surveyed in a Rhino Records
retrospective titled: "Genius: The Best of Warren Zevon," which is
due in stores Oct. 15.</TE>
<TE>   Zevon has long been praised as a musician's musician, with Bruce
Springsteen, Bob Dylan and Neil Young among those who have proclaimed
themselves fans. The child of Russian immigrants (his father was a
professional gambler), Zevon was a classically trained child prodigy
who found his way to the L.A. canyons in the 1960s in search of a
music career. He wrote a song, "She Quit Me," for the film "Midnight
Cowboy," and made cash with TV jingles, session work and as music
director for Everly Brothers tours. As Southern California became a
hotbed for singer-songwriters, Zevon was in the scene, but also, he
says, a loner with behavior that was not always career-enhancing.</TE>
<TE>   His albums have featured the Eagles, R.E.M. and members of
Fleetwood Mac as guest contributors, and Linda Ronstadt memorably
recorded his "Poor Poor Pitiful Me."</TE>
<TE>   But mainstream success has been fleeting. Despite glowing reviews
for albums such as "Sentimental Hygiene" in 1987 and "Mr. Bad
Example" in 1991, Zevon found himself without a recording contract
before Artemis signed him to release "Life'll Kill Ya" in 2000. Zevon
said the path he has walked might have been just right for his
strange and singular pace.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a little more interesting this way, maybe," he said.
"Maybe more aggravating, too. At least I've had one foot in a very
normal kind of life. Nobody does my chores so I can go upstairs and
jam with Branford, y'know?</TE>
<TE>   "I feel the opposite of regret. I was the hardest-living rock on
my block for a while. I was a malfunctioning rummy for a while and
running away for a while. Then for 18 years I was a sober dad of some
amazing kids. Hey, I feel like I've lived a couple of lives--and now
when people listen to the music they'll say, 'Hey maybe the guy
wasn't being so morbid after all.' "</TE>

<HD>Yet Another Small-Screen Search Goes Into Action</HD>
<DH>Television* The quest for the next Vin Diesel and Jennifer
Garner is a series a la 'The It Factor.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>TV's "search and sing" mission has just ended. But the new "search
and destroy" mission is just beginning.</LD>
<LD>   Hollywood is still reeling from the finale of "American Idol,"
which recently crowned a Texas cocktail waitress as the next singing
"superstar" after a search of several months. HBO's "Project
Greenlight" fell short in its search for the new visionary filmmaker.
Bravo's "The It Factor" is carrying on with its search for the next
movie star. NBC's "Fear Factor" is on a weekly search for the perfect
bug eater.</LD>
<LD>   Television's search mania will continue this fall with a new
television show that is looking for the next action hero and heroine.
While Vin Diesel of "XXX" and Jennifer Garner of ABC's "Alias" might
not be quaking in their fighting boots just yet, the producers of the
new NBC series think the winners might give those stars a
run-and-tumble for their money.</LD>
<TE>   The new 10-episode project has the "just the facts" title of "The
Next Action Star," and comes courtesy of action-movie mogul Joel
Silver, the producer of testosterone-fueled epics such as the "Lethal
Weapon" movies, "The Matrix" and "Swordfish." Producing the series
along with Silver Pictures Television is NBC Studios and GRB
Entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   "The search for the next big star has always gone on, but now the
process will come into the living room," said Gary Benz, president of
GRB Entertainment. He noted that Silver was instrumental in
developing the careers of Bruce Willis, Jet Li, Arnold Schwarzenegger
and Mel Gibson.</TE>
<TE>   Producers will roam the country to find prospective action stars
with an "it factor" (although not the same "it" that Bravo is
seeking). The contestants will be brought to live together in
Hollywood and gradually winnowed down to a final pair. The two will
then be cast in a Silver-produced movie, "Hit Me," that will air on
NBC.</TE>
<TE>   Said Benz: "It's very hard to pinpoint what that 'it factor' is.
But after working on producing stunts for 22 years, I know that what
goes on behind the scenes is often a lot more interesting than what
happens in front of the camera."</TE>
<TE>   A press release on the project declared that "Hit Me" "will
feature an adrenalin-fortified story line that will not only
challenge the new stars physically, but will put their on-screen
charm and charisma to the test."</TE>
<TE>   There was no immediate word on whether any of the contestants of
"American Idol" would try out for "The Next Action Star."</TE>

<KH>Toronto Film  Festival</KH>
<HD>No Screen Gems, but Plenty of Talent</HD>
<DH>Underrated and unknown actors--including some
first-timers--bring fresh energy at screenings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN CLARK</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>TORONTO--The Toronto International Film Festival has been blissfully
normal this year--aside from the heat and smog, which have been
compared in the local papers to New York's, a city that's been on
everybody's mind here. Before the festival started on Sept. 5 (it
runs through Saturday ), there was talk that the first anniversary of
9/11 might disrupt or diminish the proceedings, but the events of
last year have been more of a murmur, a background noise, in theaters
and at parties.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, there's no better example of business as usual here than
a much-discussed flap over journalists--notably a Very Important
Critic--being shut out of an overbooked press screening of Todd
Haynes' romantic melodrama "Far From Heaven." So much for keeping the
bigger perspective in mind.</LD>
<LD>   This year's festival has not been a big one for undiscovered gems,
but it has been unusually rich in performances by underrated actors
and even ones who have never acted before.</LD>
<TE>   Of the former, there's Campbell Scott's irresistible motor-mouth
misogynist in Dylan Kidd's "Roger Dodger," Kyra Sedgwick's good-time
gal in Rebecca Miller's "Personal Velocity," Motown session musicians
the Funk Brothers in Paul Justman's documentary "Standing in the
Shadows of Motown," Alfred Molina's effortlessly egotistical Diego
Rivera in Julie Taymor's "Frida" and Miranda Richardson's
passive-aggressive work in David Cronenberg's "Spider."</TE>
<TE>   Among the acting debuts, special mention has to be made of the
lead in Curtis Hanson's "8 Mile," a work in progress that was shown
only once, with scalped tickets reportedly going for as much as $185
(Canadian). The star, and the reason for all of the heat, was bad-boy
rapper Eminem, who was playing a version of himself, a
down-at-the-heels rapper who lives in a trailer with his boozy mother
(Kim Basinger), works a dead-end job, hangs with losers, suffers
stage fright and has anger-management issues. It may remind audiences
of a movie they've seen before (Prince's "Purple Rain"), and Eminem's
acting range may be limited, but who cares? When he starts rapping,
it's all over--he's electrifying.</TE>
<TE>   There's an extraordinary array of breakout performances by young,
unknown actresses too. And the movies they are featured in don't
traffic in the usual coming-of-age/sexual awakening cliches. Among
them is director Niki Caro's New Zealand-set "Whale Rider," which
sneaked up on audiences here as other, bigger films hogged the
spotlight. At both public screenings it played to a standing ovation,
prompting New Zealand actor Sam Neill, who was in the second
audience, to give a speech of thanks to the filmmakers, which reduced
Caro and much of the audience to tears. More tears flowed as the
center of the film, 12-year-old Keisha Castle-Hughes, haltingly
described what the experience meant to her. She gives what might be
described as a quietly heroic performance as a Maori girl who assumes
a mythic mantle of leadership over the objections of her
traditionally minded grandfather.</TE>
<TE>   Castle-Hughes, who had never acted before, was found by casting
director Diana Rowan in an Auckland classroom. "I was being really
naughty, passing notes and talking," she says, adding that Rowan took
her aside when class was dismissed. "She asked me if I was Maori.
Then she asked me if I could swim and open my eyes under water."</TE>
<TE>   Another defiant girl is the subject of Philip Noyce's absorbing
true-life drama, "Rabbit Proof Fence," which features the ferocious
11-year-old (now 13-year-old) novice Everlyn Sampi, along with two
other girls, Tianna Sansbury and Laura Monaghan. They play
"half-castes" (half-white, half-Aborigine) who escape a government
institution and trek 1,500 miles home, evading the police and an
aboriginal tracker. Sampi's character is tough, resourceful and
stubborn--apparently not unlike Sampi herself. Noyce found her in a
settlement called Djarindjin, in far northwestern Australia. Although
she knew television, she'd never been in a movie theater and had no
interest in becoming an actress. But Noyce turned a camera on her and
discovered that she had "it," and induced her to join the picture.
She ran away twice before the cameras rolled. "Everlyn Sampi has a
healthy disrespect for authority," Noyce says ruefully.</TE>
<TE>   Moving from the Outback to the bars, gambling dens and alleyways
of southern France, there's Neil Jordan's wonderfully offhand "The
Good Thief," a remake of the classic heist film "Bob le Flambeur"
that features a flashy supporting performance by the improbably named
Nutsa Kukhianidze.</TE>
<TE>   Kukhianidze plays an Eastern European prostitute who is taken in
by Bob (Nick Nolte) and his gang of thieves. Seventeen years old,
from Georgia, in the former Soviet Union, Kukhianidze previously had
starred in a Georgian film called "27 Missing Kisses," which played
at Cannes. Jordan had seen the film and summoned her for an audition
in London, where he discovered that she was living in
Georgia--Atlanta, Ga.</TE>
<TE>   A little closer to home is Alison Lohman's portrayal of the
chameleon-like Astrid in director Peter Kosminsky's "White Oleander,"
based on the novel by Janet Fitch. Astrid's mercurial mother
(Michelle Pfeiffer) is imprisoned for killing a faithless lover.
Astrid then goes through the revolving doors of foster care, first to
a trailer-trash mom (Robin Wright Penn), then to a washed-up actress
(Renee Zellweger) and finally to a Russian emigre (Svetlana
Efremova).</TE>
<TE>   What's amazing about Lohman's performance is that she takes on the
coloring of each of these environments while facing down some of the
best actresses in the business. Kosminsky says he saw 400 actresses
for the role and subjected Lohman to six screen tests, basically
covering the entire plot of the movie.</TE>
<TE>   "I was looking for still waters that run deep," he says, referring
to the many scenes in which all Astrid does is observe, which
requires the actress to hold the screen without saying anything.
Then, switching metaphors, he adds, "She's like a chick hatching, wet
and angry."</TE>
<TE>   Lohman, curled up on a couch in a hotel suite, gives the
impression that she'd rather crawl back in the shell. She says that
at the gala premiere, she had the car delivering her to the red
carpet circle the block because she didn't want to face the
photographers. She was in tears.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a deer in the headlights," she says. "I was petrified."</TE>
<TE>   Lohman, 22, is a Palm Desert native whose only big-league acting
experience has been in the former Fox TV series "Pasadena"; she's
currently shooting a Ridley Scott movie, "Matchstick Men," playing
Nicolas Cage's daughter. Apparently she didn't have the time during
the shoot to be intimidated by Pfeiffer and company. In fact, Lohman
didn't realize the scope of what she'd done and whom she'd done it
with until she came to Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   But then, this sort of coming-out party is what the festival is
all about.</TE>

<HD>Hard-Boiled 'Dogwalker' Turns Into a Charmer</HD>
<DH>An idiosyncratic film from the festival circuit finally
opens in L.A., the city it captures so sweetly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANOHLA DARGIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The rumpled low-key charmer "The Dogwalker" opens with a good-looking
man in a bad-looking suit spouting hard-boiled dialogue. His words
sound vaguely like warmed-over Raymond Chandler--there's something
about a "Darwinian tempest"--and initially it seems as if this is yet
another of those Los Angeles detective stories soaked in sunshine and
nihilism.</LD>
<LD>   The perception isn't wholly misguided: The film's tough-guy
voice-over, along with a snarling sexpot and an old man's vanity, are
borrowed from Chandler's "The Big Sleep," as is the smog of absurdity
that hangs over the story and city alike. Yet this isn't a retooled
genre piece, the tale of a guy and his gun, but an amiably
idiosyncratic work that suggests that if Tom Sawyer had been born in
the Southland, he might well have grown up to become Kato Kaelin, his
playfulness ripened into sly opportunism.</LD>
<TE>   A disreputable beach type with sun-kissed highlights and drowsy
bedroom eyes, Jerry Cooper (Will Stewart) claims to have once sold
insurance and now lives in a feral white Continental that, much like
its owner, spends more time in park than in drive. He's a
psychological blank with no home and no history; he looks born to
hustle, and that's pretty much what he does even when his heart
doesn't seem in it. There's a sense that Jerry has been drifting for
years (most of the time his car doesn't even run), that he's one
those guys who hangs at the edges of Los Angeles waiting for someone
to notice how pretty he is and just maybe pay for the privilege of
noticing.</TE>
<TE>   Written and directed by Paul Duran, whose first feature was a
heist movie with the alarming name of "Flesh Suitcase," "The
Dogwalker" has something of a story, but retelling it wouldn't leave
the film with many surprises. Suffice it to say that Jerry falls in
with an old lady, Alma (Carol Gustafson), and her bull mastiff and
that the slacker and his equally dodgy friends (Tony Todd, Cress
Williams and Walter Emanuel Jones) end up entangled in Alma's life.
Relationships develop with tender humor, as does some ill-considered
drama. A couple of Alma's friends, a pair of elderly romantics Sam
Steele (Allan Rich) and Ike Noodleman (John Randolph), are somehow
involved, as are her daughter (Stepfanie Kramer) and granddaughter
(Nicki Aycox). The actors are uniformly good, though Todd and
Randolph, as a rheumy-eyed addict and a fragile relic who forge an
unlikely bond, are even better.</TE>
<TE>   Since its premiere in 1999 at (of all places) the Karlovy Vary
Film Festival in the Czech Republic, "The Dogwalker" has been making
the festival rounds. (A different feature titled "The Dogwalker"
screened at this year's Los Angeles Film Festival.) Small movies
without stars and big money often follow this route, but it's too bad
it took this film so long to secure a release, especially in the city
it captures with such gentle idealism.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly "The Dogwalker" is a long way from perfect. Too many
scenes are underwritten and aimless, and a late swerve into tragedy
feels forced, as if Duran, after assembling his collection of
eccentrics, couldn't figure out how to get them safely to the finish.
This is, after all, a film in which no one leads life according to
script--but, then, that's also the reason it works.</TE>
<TE>   Unrated. Times guidelines: There's some clothed sexual flailing
but nothing graphic; more graphic is the representation of
intravenous illegal drug use, which may be hard for the squeamish.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Diplomacy Gets a Little Help From Artists</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For 36 years, the U.S. Department of State's Art in Embassies Program
has been placing original works of art by U.S. citizens in American
diplomatic residences worldwide. This fall, for the first time, the
State Department will send artists to visit the host countries along
with their artworks.</LD>
<LD>   During the next two months, five American artists and one art
historian will participate in a new initiative that Anne Johnson, a
presidential appointee who has served as director of the program
since May, hopes will become a permanent part of the program.</LD>
<LD>   The artists are Los Angeles ceramist Karen Koblitz, who leaves
Sept. 27 for Moscow; New York City painter Valentina DuBasky, who
will visit Riga, Latvia, and Tallinn, Estonia; painter Karen
Gunderson, also of New York City, who travels to Lome, Togo;
multimedia painter Johnny Johnson of Fredericksburg, Va., who is
headed to Cotonou, Benin; and Brooklyn artist Eve Andree Laramee, who
will go to Canada to visit Ottawa and Montreal. Art historian
Nicholas Fox Weber, executive director of the Josef and Anni Albers
Foundation in Bethany, Conn., will travel to the Hague in the
Netherlands to speak about the late abstract expressionist artist
Josef Albers.</LD>
<TE>   The artists are selected by the American ambassadors in each
country in conjunction with program curators. With the State
Department providing air fare and a per diem, each artist will spend
several days in the host country, participating in an event at the
embassy, as well as speaking or teaching at at least one community
center such as a school or museum selected by the ambassadors. State
Department officials said the costs of the program have not yet been
finalized.</TE>
<TE>   "We had travel money in our budget, and we thought it was an
interesting way to expand our program--it is enhancing the use of the
collections at the residences," Johnson said. "It is very cost
effective; we have to be very careful about that in government right
now."</TE>
<TE>   As was the case before the new initiative, all participating
artists agree to lend their artworks to the embassy residence for
three years, at no charge. Johnson said that the program has about
$50 million worth of art placed abroad at any given time--some works
lent by the artist, others by museums and galleries. "People really
love to lend, to participate in visual diplomacy," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Artist Koblitz, who describes her colorful ceramic works as
"still-life tableaux," had some of her works displayed through the
program in the American Embassy in Berne, Switzerland, in the
mid-1990s--but is excited to be traveling with them this time.</TE>
<TE>   "I am an ambassador," said Koblitz, a faculty member in the art
department at USC. "I hope to make a connection with Russian artists,
to start an exchange; maybe one of them will come to America. I hope
it goes way beyond my artwork."</TE>

<HD>A Tourist and Film Fan Finds 'People's Fest' Is Aptly Named</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>Fresh off the plane, we felt as hapless and frazzled as Jack Lemmon
and Sandy Dennis in "The Out-of-Towners." A mad taxi dash from the
airport Friday evening got us to the Toronto International Film
Festival's main box office at the Eaton Centre mall at 6:45, 15
minutes before closing, but when we picked up our ticket package we
got a shock: Our "Globetrotter" screening series started that night
at 8:30, not the next day, as we had been told.</LD>
<LD>   After figuring out north from south, we heaved our baggage onto
the subway at the adjoining station and headed downtown to King
Street to check into our hotel, then caught a train back uptown to
Bloor Street, grabbing Thai noodles at Green Mango and aspirin at the
corner drug store just in time to make the show.</LD>
<LD>   Make no mistake: This is adventure travel, but movie buffs will
quickly find that when the lights go down, it's worth the headache.
As first-time visitors to any major film festival--let alone this
10-day, 265-feature extravaganza--and as newcomers to the city, we're
seeing and learning more than we could have imagined for a vacation.</LD>
<TE>   Film festivals have sprouted up seemingly everywhere in recent
years, but Toronto's eclectic program shows in its 27th year why "the
people's festival" is a favorite among industry types and fans.</TE>
<TE>   Our series started with "Secretary," a subversively wicked
romantic comedy starring Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader as a
workplace couple in an S&amp;M relationship. Although the film will be
too self-consciously weird for many tastes, Gyllenhaal is enchanting
as a submissive head case who blossoms under Spader's twitchy
tutelage.</TE>
<TE>   Filmmakers, of course, add to the festival experience when they
show up to chat with members of the audience, and "Secretary"
director Steven Shainberg's quirky wit didn't disappoint the sell-out
crowd. "I've been waiting all my life to be called 'shockingly
perverse,' " he said after a festival honcho introduced the picture,
Shainberg's second feature.</TE>
<TE>   In a post-screening question-and-answer session, a college student
reviewing the film for her school paper asked Shainberg for a "hook."
"How about 'Spanking Director Makes Masterpiece,' " Shainberg
suggested.</TE>
<TE>   Next came "Champion," a South Korean biopic about boxer Kim
Deuk-gu, who suffered a fatal blow in a world title bout against
American Ray "Boom Boom" Mancini. Director Kwak Kyung-taek's movie is
unabashedly sentimental, but it gave North Americans who remember the
tragedy a chance to view it from another perspective. This also was a
chance to see a movie that may receive scant exposure in the States.</TE>
<TE>   "Hard Goodbyes: My Father" focuses on the loss of a different sort
of hero. In 1969 Athens, a traveling salesman promises his
10-year-old son that he will return home in time for them to watch
Neil Armstrong's lunar walk together, but it was a vow he was unable
to keep. This tender but slow-paced debut from director Penny
Panayotopoulou is another movie that seems unlikely to reach our
megaplexes.</TE>
<TE>   The tone shifted with "The Nugget," a blue-collar comedy in the
tradition of "The Full Monty" and "Waking Ned Devine." Three lazy
Aussie blokes stumble on a mother lode of gold while on a weekend
beer-drinking expedition in the hills, then mishandle it in every
way. Writer-director Bill Bennett said he had the spring 2000 tech
stock crash and its sudden evaporation of paper wealth in mind when
he conceived of the film.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett and producer Jennifer Cluff were among many filmmakers who
addressed the Sept. 11 attacks, which interrupted the festival last
year and tempered the usual celebratory mood this year. Production of
"The Nugget" was halted briefly by the attacks, but what kept cast
and crew going was the sense that "we were putting love and light out
into the world," Cluff said.</TE>
<TE>   Beginners' Luck</TE>
<TE>   To supplement our series, we made a bleary-eyed return to the box
office early Saturday in search of tickets to individual films. More
than half the screenings listed on the poster-sized schedules were
already crossed out in red as the third day began, meaning only those
willing to wait in "rush" lines had a prayer of a chance, but we
seemed to be having beginners' luck with the ones we picked from the
leftovers.</TE>
<TE>   A local in line mentioned he was catching the world premiere that
night of the micro-budgeted American film "Never Get Outta the Boat."
That show was sold out, but every movie screens twice, so we nabbed
Sunday-morning seats on the theory that you can sleep when you're
dead.</TE>
<TE>   Director Paul Quinn was impressed to see a packed house. "Look at
you. It's 9 a.m. and here you are," he said by way of introduction.
The gritty movie, written by co-star Nick Gillie and named for a line
in "Apocalypse Now," turned out to be a captivating and funny tale of
early sobriety in a halfway house full of drug addicts.</TE>
<TE>   After the show, Quinn was asked about the contrast with his 1999
debut, "This Is My Father." "Let's see. That was a period piece set
in Ireland in the 1930s with hardly any cursing," he said with a
smile. "Not much difference, really."</TE>
<TE>   Another gamble that paid off was an afternoon screening of "The
Sea," from the director of "101 Reykjavik." Introduced by the
festival's managing director as " 'Peyton Place,' Icelandic-style, or
'King Lear' in a fish-packing plant," it turned out to be a scalding
mix of family secrets unearthed, more reminiscent of Denmark's "The
Celebration."</TE>
<TE>   "The dysfunctional family can relate to the whole world," director
Baltasar Kormakur said. "Everybody has one."</TE>
<TE>   Although serendipity can work, ticket-buying strategies vary, and
many regulars are almost maniacal in their planning. A retiree
queuing for Japan's "Blue," his sixth movie of the day, said he has
it down pat in his second year. "The first thing I do is get the book
on Wednesday," he said, referring to the 400-page catalog available
at least a day ahead of the festival.</TE>
<TE>   "If the description has the words 'brutal violence' or it's a
first-time film by some revolutionary, I can skip it. That eliminates
about one-third." After submitting his request sheet for the
early-bird lottery on the opening morning, he got 34 of his 44
choices, then six more by swapping tickets.</TE>
<TE>   A Northwest Airlines worker from Detroit said he shows up the day
before the festival, pores over the catalog, then dashes around town
to line up for last-minute tickets at various venues. .</TE>
<TE>   The equitable chaos apparently extends to press row. Critic Roger
Ebert threw a "hissy fit," according to a local newspaper, after
trying unsuccessfully to big-dog his way into a crowded media
screening of the Todd Haynes melodrama with Julianne Moore, "Far From
Heaven." Ebert, in his Thursday report, denied misbehaving.</TE>
<TE>   Although the new Globetrotter series was marketed for
first-timers, it's probably best suited to locals who won't be thrown
by the 11th-hour scheduling. On the eve of our trip, it seemed to be
the only series we couldn't find listings for online. Next time, we
would try the higher-profile Visa Screening Room series (a hot item
we neglected to pounce on as soon as it was available in mid-July),
adding wild tickets for the exotic fare.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the films stirring buzz, like Curtis Hanson's "8 Mile,"
are part of the Visa series. Fortunately, the lively, friendly city
is easier to navigate than the festival's Web site. We beat the
unseasonable heat with kiwi "freezies" at the Symposium Cafe,
hazelnut gelato at Caffe della Scala, a breezy ferry ride to the
Toronto Islands and a visit to the air-conditioned Henry Moore
sculpture center at the Art Gallery of Ontario. The clerk at the
gelato shop threw in free pastries.</TE>
<TE>   We'll have to skip the Globetrotter finale Saturday night because
of another scheduling, uh, miscommunication, but the fifth show in
the series was an obscure treat. "Waiting for Happiness," a comedy
about a man returning to Mauritania only to find his connections
gone, was made by Abderrahmane Sissako, nicknamed "the Buster Keaton
of Africa" by the Toronto weekly Now. For film buffs, this is
happiness indeed.</TE>

<HD>A Stab at Emigre Life</HD>
<DH>In the darkly comic, layered 'Queen of the Remote Control,'
a South Asian family adapts to Calabasas; their daughter tunes in to
other dreams.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Playwright-director Sujata G. Bhatt's "Queen of the Remote Control,"
which premiered Wednesday at East West Players, is East West's first
work presented by a writer of South Asian descent, and the first to
feature a South Asian cast.</LD>
<LD>   Bhatt's story of a prosperous physician couple who traded life in
Bombay for comfy Calabasas and their two, like, totally Valley
children is certainly not the first East West production--and
probably not the last--to explore the conflict between an older
immigrant generation and its American offspring. In this case, the
catalyst for the culture clash is son Nitin Shah's (Kal Penn) return
home to introduce the family to his new fiancee.</LD>
<LD>   But while there is nothing particularly surprising about Bhatt's
concept, her darkly comic take on assimilation, which she co-directs
with East West producing artistic director Tim Dang, provides enough
layers, secrets and lies to make this play something deeper than "My
Big Fat Indian Wedding."</LD>
<TE>   Bhatt's ambitious attempt to cover all the bases--social,
emotional, religious and political--results in a few couch-bound
scenes in which the family seems to be interviewing each other for a
"MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour" installment on the history and culture of
India. But it is that same ambition that takes the play beyond the
easy jokes about clothes, food or American slang that often
characterize such stories.</TE>
<TE>   The jokes are there--and, about half the time, they're funny. But
with the gags is a sensitive and often moving attempt to visit the
uglier side of what happens to the spirit in the process of becoming
an American--including a gloves-off look at prejudices about caste
and skin color that the Shahs drag with them to their new world.</TE>
<TE>   And, by the end, there is a sharp reversal of who appears to be
"Queen of the Remote Control."</TE>
<TE>   The Shah family's complacent existence is viewed through the
disapproving eyes of 17-year-old Shilpa Shah (Poorna Jagannathan), a
bored young Val who is taking a break from watching television and
visiting the malls to complete her college applications. Her parents,
Divya (Meera Simhan) and Ashok (Bernard White), want her to go to
Stanford. She wants to head for New York City to attend
Columbia--mostly because it's farther from the Valley. Her stumbling
block: The Columbia application requires her to write an essay about
what person--living, dead or fictional--she would most like to be.
She has no idea of either who she is or who she'd rather be.</TE>
<TE>   Her plans to devote the weekend to this task are derailed by a
phone call: Her brother Nitin is getting married and bringing his
intended home to meet the family. Shilpa must forgo an escape to Ojai
with a friend to work on her essay to stay home to chop vegetables
with Mom and meet Padma (Sulekha Naidu), the newest member of the
family.</TE>
<TE>   Shilpa just can't seem to escape her family, or Calabasas--but
when the going gets tough, she grabs the remote control and retreats
into the world of TV. Sometimes, she's watching real television--she
loves game shows. And sometimes, she is able to actually turn the
members of her family on and off with the remote.</TE>
<TE>   Television as a metaphor for escaping reality--well, yawn. But
using the remote control itself as a dramatic device has some
promise. The technique works beautifully in some cases--watch Shilpa
rewind and replay her pompous air-bag father in a particularly
hilarious moment--and less so in others. There's little consistency
to the choices about where and when to insert the power of the remote
into the action. The element that inspires the title of the drama
remains its least focused part.</TE>
<TE>   Jagannathan--tall, coltish, petulant, radiant--does a terrific job
of combining Shilpa's judgmental sarcasm in describing those around
her with a shaky cluelessness about her own life and faults. She
renders the character both winning and completely insufferable--in
short, a real teenager.</TE>
<TE>   But it is Simhan's Divya who becomes the most watchable character.
She's at first the perfect, plump suburban mom, toting shopping bags
from Crate &amp; Barrel and spouting such statements as "Life is not
about happiness, it's about family," but later reveals depths of
anger, passion and insight that can't be turned off, even with a
remote.</TE>

<HD>'Stealing Harvard's' Jokes Are as Dim as the Jokers</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Stealing Harvard" is an act of grand theft--the way it wastes your
time is a crime. It's so bad that you have to wonder whether Tom
Green was looking for a project to match last year's "Freddy Got
Fingered," which he directed and which ended up on many worst of 2001
lists. Green didn't direct this turkey, but it surely is a contender
for the bottom of the barrel award for 2002.</LD>
<LD>   Jason Lee is John, a timid soul engaged to Elaine (Leslie Mann),
the pretty daughter of his overbearing boss, Mr. Warner (Dennis
Farina), a widower whose possessiveness of Elaine borders on the
incestuous. Elaine announces to John that after much scrimping and
saving, they have at last accrued $30,000 for a down payment on a
house.</LD>
<LD>   The conservative John reluctantly agrees, having forgotten that
years earlier he promised his bright little niece Noreen (Tammy
Blanchard), the daughter of his trailer-trash older sister Patty
(Megan Mullally), that he would send her to college. Now finishing
high school, Patty is ecstatic that she has been accepted to Harvard,
won a partial scholarship and arranged further financial aid. All she
needs from her Uncle John is a mere--you guessed it--$30,000.</LD>
<TE>   The loving but none-too-bright John can't bring himself to let
down either his fiancee or his niece, so he turns for help to his
best pal, Duff, who is played by Green. Not only is Duff none too
bright himself, but he is a hyper weirdo as well. Thus "Stealing
Harvard" proceeds from one labored and unfunny shenanigan to another
until it peters out to a predictably happy ending. Bruce McCulloch
directed in uninspired fashion Peter Tolan's equally uninspired
script.</TE>
<TE>   Considering the direness of the circumstances, Lee and Mann cannot
be blamed for being so charmless. The same could be said for Green;
no one would ever guess how original and hilarious he can be. Farina
actually manages to find some humor in his role, as does Seymour
Cassel as Duff's larcenous uncle. As reliable as John C, McGinley and
Chris Penn are, McGinley's hysterical cop and Penn's lowlife thug are
such lousy, over-the-top parts not even they can make anything of
them. With luck, "Stealing Harvard" will steal away from theaters
pretty swiftly.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for crude and sexual humor, language and drug
uses. Times guidelines: crude is the word all around.</TE>

<HD>'Heartbreak Hospital' Is a Flat-Liner</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANOHLA DARGIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Heartbreak Hospital" is a dreary indulgence. An unfunny satire set
in the world of daytime soap opera, it isn't offensive enough to
inspire passionate response but is exactly the sort of feckless
endeavor that's turning "indie" into one of the dirtiest words in
movies.</LD>
<LD>   When the film opens, hungry young actress Neely (Chelsea Altman)
is living the boho New York life with her boyfriend, Tonio (Demian
Bichir), and sinking under the weight of professional rejection. She
can't land any gigs, which may have something to do with the fact
that she's lousy--although her acting coach repeatedly assures her
that she's gifted, which may have something to do with the fact that
she's paying him.</LD>
<LD>   Minutes before Neely escapes to Mexico to make babies and a
permanent home, she secures a part in a daytime series called
"Heartbreak Hospital," whereupon various things happen, none
interesting. This low-rent Ann Magnuson gets bumped up from coma
victim to lead player and forgets to tend to her sulky boyfriend;
meanwhile, the soap's preening stars (Diane Venora and John Shea)
circle her like spitting cats, as does her neighbor (Patricia
Clarkson), a fanatic who can't tell the difference between truth and
television.</LD>
<TE>   Based on a novel by Henry Slesar, a former advertising man who
became a longtime soap opera writer, and ineptly directed by Ruedi
Gerber, a German theater actor with a few documentaries and short
films on his resume, "Heartbreak Hospital" lacks focus as much as it
does heart. It's a measure of the film's disjointed screenplay and
its confused tone (tragedy and insanity are played for awkward
laughs) that Neely is also the name of Patty Duke's aspiring actress
in the 1967 movie of Jacqueline Susann's kitsch masterpiece, "Valley
of the Dolls." But although there are a couple of other teasing
similarities between the two films--a guy named Tony, an aging
diva--the allusions don't go anywhere or add up to anything, which
only makes Gerber's inattention to niceties such as pacing,
storytelling and the audience's pleasure all the more exasperating.</TE>
<TE>   Outside of Shea, Venora and Clarkson, nothing looks or moves the
way it should, and the whole thing just dithers, buoyed along by
blithe self-regard and a welter of cliches. Since the characters are
as unbelievable as the story, the actors have little to do but hang
on to their native gifts and costumes, which is rough on Altman,
whose merciless spunk outweighs her charm. And so Shea chews the
scenery as Venora swans about in caftans and a turban stabbed through
with a broach, bringing to mind visions of the late Quentin Crisp,
and Clarkson jumps on a bicycle in a wedding dress and makes a mad
dash for the exit. Although it's distressing to see Venora and
Clarkson reduced to such tawdry circumstances, each has one moment in
"Heartbreak Hospital" that reminds you both have done far better and
will do so again.</TE>
<TE>   Unrated. Times guidelines: some suggestions of nudity and sexual
shenanigans with a few instances of non-graphic violence.</TE>

<LD>Think you have problems? Try being New Jersey's preeminent specialist
in "waste management."</LD>
<LD>   Yes, you know who--bravo!--is bada-binging back.</LD>
<LD>   Brutal but ever conflicted, Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini)
returns to HBO Sunday with fresh challenges after three seething
seasons of mingling popular entertainment and high art. So high, in
fact, that the University of Calgary in Canada now offers a course on
gangster films fittingly celebrating "The Sopranos" beside such
classics as "The Public Enemy," "GoodFellas" and the "Godfather"
trilogy.</LD>
<TE>   Are things going smoothly for Tony when "The Sopranos" resumes?
Carmela and the kids all cozy and blissful? No cares on the crime
front?</TE>
<TE>   Whadda you, crazy?</TE>
<TE>   And the Corleones thought they had it tough.</TE>
<TE>   Aging Uncle Junior (Dominic Chianese), whom Tony made figurehead
boss in Season 1 to divert the feds from himself, is being tried on
racketeering charges and demands a bigger split to pay his legal
bills. Now a "made man" with responsibility, Tony's hothead nephew,
Christopher (Michael Imperioli), still secretly shoots up and is
unaware through the haze that the tough cookie so chummy with his
girlfriend, Adriana (Drea de Matteo), is an undercover fed.</TE>
<TE>   Just as Tony is too preoccupied to notice that Carmela (Edie
Falco), while no longer attracted to feckless Father Phil (Paul
Schulze), now gets all fluttery in the presence of her husband's
ponytailed macho driver, Furio (Federico Castelluccio). And, uh-oh,
the sparks appear to be mutual.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't end here. Doubts linger about the loyalty of Tony's
once-trusted top lieutenant, Paulie (Tony Sirico), now on the phone
regularly with rival underboss Johnny Sack (Vincent Curatola) while
in jail on a gun charge. Tony's other trusted underling, Silvio
(Steven Van Zandt), may have his own private agenda, by the way. And
Tony's twisted sister, Janet (Aida Turturro)--who gunned down her
last mob boyfriend--is secretly carrying on with lewd sociopath
Ralphie Cifaretto (Joe Pantoliano), a good bet to reside with the
fishes by season's end.</TE>
<TE>   Returning to the home front, it still takes Tony less time to pad
down the driveway in his white terry robe for the New York Times each
morning than it does teenage Anthony Jr. (Robert Iler) to read a
sentence in a book.</TE>
<TE>   And Michael Corleone never faced anyone as daunting as the
Sopranos' pampered, sullen daughter, Meadow (Jamie-Lynn Sigler), a
Mafia American Princess spending the summer aimlessly at home on her
cell phone while planning to drop out of Columbia and tour Europe.</TE>
<TE>   When Carmela has had it up to here with Meadow's idleness, the
ungrateful kid snaps at her mother: "12 credits, two semesters in a
row, and I'm not entitled to a summer?"</TE>
<TE>   Other returnees naturally include Tony's neurotic shrink, Dr.
Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco), again unloading on her own
therapist, Dr. Elliot Kupferberg (director Peter Bogdanovich).
Assemblyman Zellman (Peter Riegert) is as corrupt as ever. And what
would "The Sopranos" be without a home base featuring flesh? So back,
as well, is the family's Bada Bing strip club, where Tony and his
boys hang out and tally the pluses and minuses of crime.</TE>
<TE>   Although even the best series ultimately falter from natural wear
and attrition, no aging brown spots or crows' feet are visible on
"The Sopranos" in its fourth season.</TE>
<TE>   These early episodes stand head and holsters above everything else
this fall, their hybrid of incongruous tones and emotions never more
alluring than in coming hours when some prominent underworld
characters display unexpected tenderness and devotion in their
marriages. They include Johnny Sack, of all people, embracing his
oversized wife with sympathy and loving sweetness, defining her as
"beautiful, Rubenesque" after savagely beating a man he believes
laughed at a crude joke about her obesity.</TE>
<TE>   Creator David Chase's densely written characters continue to walk
a perilous high wire between violence and humor. In a sly nod to
charges that his series stereotypes Italian Americans as criminals,
Episode 3 has Carmela and other Mafia wives in a huff when a Catholic
parish speaker urges U.S. women of Italian origin to combat media
stereotyping as mob molls.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Tony's crime family is outraged when Native Americans
protest Newark's annual Columbus Day Parade. "I tell you what it is,"
snarls Silvio, wanting to bust heads, "anti-Italian discrimination."
It gets especially funny when they launch an anti-African American PR
campaign and enlist the help of a "chief" who had a "racial
awakening" only when opening a casino.</TE>
<TE>   As always, its connection to ordinary lives is one thing setting
this series apart. So, naturally, "The Sopranos" is not immune to the
cosmic Sept. 11 calamity that U-turned Americans everywhere. "Mom
really went down after the World Trade Center," says Uncle Junior's
hulking sidekick, Bobby Bacala (Steven Schirripa).</TE>
<TE>   Above all, though, even on "The Sopranos," it's the economy,
stupid.</TE>
<TE>   Fearing for her family's future should Tony die, Carmela urges him
to invest the fortune he's secretly stashed and at the very least do
some "simple estate planning." He'll have none of it. "The money
stays where it is, with what's goin' on in d'world," barks Tony.
Later, we see him furtively burying paper sacks full of bills beneath
a tile floor and in a bag of duck seed, then angrily lecturing his
top guys nose to nose about using the nation's hard times as an
excuse for not turning a bigger profit.</TE>
<TE>   "What two businesses have been recession-proof since time
immemorial?" Tony asks. Silvio delivers on cue: "Certain aspects of
show business, and our thing."</TE>
<TE>   From stogie to extravagant lies and volcanic temper, Tony remains
as big and unpredictable as he is complex. Subtleties, shadings and
half-twists are what make him a stunning anomaly, though, and a
fascinating gangster study.</TE>
<TE>   "There's two endings for a guy like me, a high-profile guy," he
tells Melfi. "Dead or in d'can."</TE>
<TE>   HBO terminally without Tony? It's TV, after all. And as Carmela
reminds him Sunday, "Everything comes to an end."</TE>
<TE>   "The Sopranos" will be shown Sunday nights at 9 p.m. on HBO. The
network has rated it TV-MA (adult content, graphic language, nudity,
graphic violence; may be unsuitable for children under the age of
17).</TE>

<HD>'Igby Goes Down,' but Not Far Enough</HD>
<DH>First-timer Burr Steers means for his title character to be
seen as a great, tortured soul, but he's just an irritating brat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>God must love sullen, disaffected, whiny teenagers, he made so many
of them. Or if not God, first-time writer-directors--who absolutely
insist their films aren't autobiographical--certainly love tales of
sensitive types disguised as impossible brats. Oh, the pain of being
young and misunderstood. It's almost too much to bear.</LD>
<LD>   "Igby Goes Down" will, regrettably, not be the last of these
ventures, but future entrants in this already overcrowded field will
have their work cut out for them if they want to match the egregious
special pleading for a deeply tiresome character that is this film's
raison d'etre.</LD>
<LD>   Written and directed by Burr Steers, "Igby" tries to compensate
for having an unoriginal thesis (News flash! Adults are craven fools
and clueless idiots) by presenting a character dripping with
self-conscious attitude, someone we're supposed to cleave to and
sympathize with because he's discovered that (News flash, No. 2!)
there's hypocrisy out there in the real world.</LD>
<TE>   Igby Slocumb (Kieran Culkin) is introduced doing one of the few
things he's good at: getting kicked out of an elite East Coast
private school. Not that he cares. Not our Igby. He's too much the
self-absorbed, self-pitying sad little rich boy to care overly much
about anything.</TE>
<TE>   Not that Igby is a silent sufferer. Quite the opposite. No
situation in his young life, no matter how dire, leaves him without a
glib, smarty-pants rejoinder. In whatever time he's got left over
from being an Oscar Wilde wannabe, Igby steals money and drugs, lies
almost pathologically and looks hurt whenever anyone has the temerity
to question his unswervingly juvenile behavior.</TE>
<TE>   The notion behind "Igby Goes Down" is that our young hero is being
dragged down by the toxic individuals, cliches every one, in his
immediate vicinity. There's his hapless father, Jason (Bill Pullman),
a walking nervous breakdown, and his society mother, Mimi (Susan
Sarandon), a pill-popping matron who's lost without "my peppies." His
godfather, D.H. (Jeff Goldblum), is a rapacious capitalist, and his
own brother, Oliver (Ryan Phillippe), has found a way to be both
snotty and successful.</TE>
<TE>   Though we're supposed to view Igby as a great and tortured soul
starved for proper nourishment and understanding, the difficulty is
that he comes off as such an insufferable infant that by comparison
even the callow lot he's surrounded with start to look like better
bets to spend time with.</TE>
<TE>   Igby is, in fact, so irritating that people periodically feel
impelled to lash out and hit him out of sheer frustration at the
smugness of his baby rebellion.</TE>
<TE>   Audiences will likely be tempted to throw a few punches themselves
because, as brother Oliver puts it, "I think if God had to hang out
with you for an extended period of time," the deity, too, would whale
the tar out of Igby.</TE>
<TE>   Bored, finally, with being thrown out of schools, Igby decides to
camp out in Manhattan, where, because it's his movie and not ours,
the most attractive women around can't keep their hands off him.</TE>
<TE>   These include Rachel (Amanda Peet), a sometime dancer and D.H.'s
mistress, and Sookie Sapperstein (Claire Danes), an unfocused young
woman of uncertain aims. But the more attention they pay to Igby, the
more he drips sarcastic drivel. Perhaps there's a pattern here.</TE>
<TE>   Writer-director Steers has chosen to overload "Igby" with phony
archness and forced black humor, making it not the place to look for
satisfying acting. Young Culkin shows the talent he revealed in the
Sharon Stone-starring "The Mighty," and, if nothing else, his ability
to convince at least himself that this fatuous smart aleck is someone
worth caring about is some kind of feat.</TE>
<TE>   Igby's idea of the good life is killing time, and there are few
worse ways to do it than with the film that bears his name.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R for sexuality, language and drug content. Times
guidelines: The sex, language and drug use are brief but fairly
explicit.</TE>

<HD>Marsalis' 'All Rise': An Effort to Reach Out and Embrace</HD>
<DH>A year after its West Coast premiere, the composer-
trumpeter's massive, 12-movement work seems even more timely on CD.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A year ago, shortly after the attacks of Sept. 11, I reflected upon
the possibility that the horrific nature of the events might have a
sobering impact upon the music world. When World War II began for
Americans with the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941,
songwriters and musicians reacted with material that reflected both
the urgency of the situation and the sense of separation and loss
encountered by so many families.</LD>
<LD>   In the year that has passed since Sept. 11, 2001, however--despite
some important efforts in pop music--jazz artists seem to have had
little to say about the way in which the world has changed. Part of
that scarcity of effort may have something to do with the fact that
those changes--thus far, at least--have had more to do with political
bluster and posturing than with any sense that the so-called war on
terror can legitimately be compared to anything resembling World War
II. The war on Communism, in fact, might make a better analogy.</LD>
<LD>   Nonetheless, there have been some exceptional jazz moments, most
of them taking place shortly after Sept. 11. For a while, it seemed
as though no concert or club date could be complete without a
heartfelt rendering of "God Bless America" or "America the
Beautiful."</LD>
<TE>   But several specific events were particularly memorable. The first
was the jazz concert at the Hollywood Bowl on Sept. 12, 2001, one
short day after the attacks. The turnout was understandably meager,
and those who came for a program featuring the Clayton-Hamilton Jazz
Orchestra and trumpeter Wallace Roney were greeted for the first time
by security staff closely checking picnic baskets, coolers and
packages; it's a practice that continued throughout the 2002 season.</TE>
<TE>   The atmosphere inside the Bowl was intense, with strangers
conversing freely, opinions--often conflicting--being exchanged as
people struggled to make sense out of the attacks on an evening many
had anticipated as a pleasant climax to the summer season. The
program, planned as a depiction of jazz film scores, with the jazz
orchestra performing live in sync with film projections, had to be
adjusted to eliminate a climactic explosion in a clip from "Bullitt."</TE>
<TE>   But despite the efforts to essentially go ahead with business as
usual, the single most affecting passage of the evening took place
when orchestra co-leader John Clayton led his ensemble in "Heart and
Soul" as a tribute to the thousands who had perished the day before.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks later, there was another unexpectedly touching event.
Wynton Marsalis' Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra arrived in town to
perform at the Wilshire Theatre as part of the debuting Verizon Music
Festival. In startlingly serendipitous fashion, the appearance was
part of a tour titled "United in Swing"--a strikingly appropriate
description of the sort of togetherness through music that took place
during the war years of the '40s.</TE>
<TE>   That togetherness through music was perfectly defined during a
program-closing rendering of "The Stars and Stripes Forever," in
which the familiar strains of the Sousa march were transformed into a
rich musical cornucopia, overflowing with colorful fragments of jazz,
swing, improvisation and sheer musical Americana.</TE>
<TE>   Once past those opening weeks, it was the rare jazz artist who
chose to make patriotic references during their programs. A few--very
few--albums arrived that were either dedicated to the victims of
Sept. 11 or that included one or another tribute in their honor. But
jazz produced nothing that was equivalent to, say, Bruce
Springsteen's "The Rising."</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, however, Marsalis was involved in another project
during the fateful month of September 2001, one that brings this
whole discussion full circle into the present. The project was the
West Coast debut of his massive composition "All Rise," which was
performed at the Hollywood Bowl on Sept. 13, by the Lincoln Center
Jazz Orchestra; the Los Angeles Philharmonic, under Esa-Pekka
Salonen; and a full choir.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, the title of the work had an unanticipated metaphoric
resonance. "All Rise," at a time when the nation was coming together
in unity after a dastardly attack; "All Rise" as a symbol of the
togetherness that would be vital to American life in the post-Sept.
11 period; "All Rise" as an image of the phoenix rising from the
ashes of the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   And now, a year later, the recording of "All Rise"--performed by
the same forces--has been released on Sony. And what becomes clear
now, even more so than in the performance, is the extent to which
Marsalis was dipping into the core of American culture. The piece,
whose 12 movements echo the 12 bars of the blues, also includes
metaphoric parallels to the life cycle, from birth through play
through love and self-awareness. It simmers and surges with
propulsive jazz rhythms, free-soaring improvised solos and clashing,
jazz-tinged harmonies.</TE>
<TE>   But what, in retrospect, seems most important about "All Rise" is
something reaching well beyond cultural parochialism: Marsalis'
effort to, in his description, "celebrate togetherness and
ascendance, as well as the diversity and oneness of things."</TE>
<TE>   When I spoke to him shortly after Sept. 11, Marsalis expressed the
sort of shock that seemed universal at the time, but the thought that
"All Rise" might in some way turn out to be a work celebrating all
the things that are good about American culture was one of the last
thoughts in his mind. His only reference to its significance, beyond
its sheer musical value, was an expression of his hope that "All
Rise" would express the 21st century quest for "global community,"
for a time when, he noted, "we will truly be at home in the world."</TE>
<TE>   Given those views, it's ironic that the single major jazz work
associated with Sept. 11--even though it was conceived well before
the tragedy--has turned out to be a composition calling for "global
community" and expressing a desire to be "at home in the world" at
the very time when so many of the decisions made by the United States
government over the past year have proceeded oppositely, in the
direction of go-it-alone.</TE>
<TE>   Yet another example of art choosing its own pathway. What remains
to be seen: whether Marsalis' call for "global community" or the Bush
administration's call to action will eventually turn out to be the
true expression of this troubled time.</TE>

<HD>TV Beckons, but He Still Idolizes Radio</HD>
<DH>The success of 'American Idol' thrust DJ Ryan Seacrest into
the national spotlight, but he won't forsake his 'first love.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON MATSUMOTO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The last three months have hardly represented a leisurely summer
vacation for the omnipresent Ryan Seacrest.</LD>
<LD>   Along with sidekick Lisa Foxx, Seacrest is the host of a popular
weekday afternoon radio show at adult alternative rock station Star
98, (KYSR-FM, 98.7). He also works as a weekend correspondent-anchor
for the celebrity-driven television news program "Extra!," is host of
the game show "Ultimate Revenge" on cable's TNN and pilots his own
nationally syndicated weekly radio show.</LD>
<LD>   As if he wasn't already overloaded, the 27-year-old Atlanta native
added another venture last June: Fox's talent show "American Idol,"
which quickly became television's runaway summer hit. Last week,
nearly 28 million Americans watched as Seacrest announced that Kelly
Clarkson had beaten Justin Guarini to walk away with a recording
contract.</LD>
<TE>   For the upbeat and affable Seacrest, who was co-host of "American
Idol" with comedian Brian Dunkleman, the show represented a major
turning point.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a degree of anonymity when I was just doing the radio show
and not having much television exposure," said Seacrest, who spoke by
phone this week from Italy, where he was vacationing. "But 'American
Idol' was sampled on such a broad scope with male, female, young and
old viewers. I had an opportunity to be exposed to a lot more people
across the board than I would through my radio show."</TE>
<TE>   Seacrest says he's enjoyed the added public attention he's
received because of "American Idol's" success. He's even been
approached by American fans of the show this week while he was
visiting a small, coastal Italian village.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, he has no desire to leave radio. He says he rejected
several television offers that came his way recently and will
announce in the next week or so a new "multidimensional" radio
venture with Clear Channel Communications, the parent company of
KYSR.</TE>
<TE>   "People have asked me, 'Why do you still want to do radio if you
have an opportunity to do [more] TV?' " he says. "I respond, 'Why
would you ask that question?' Radio has been my first love since I
was a little boy. Radio certainly laid the foundation for my comfort
on television. Radio has become an extension of me. I've always
wanted to do both radio and TV."</TE>
<TE>   Synergy is a word that comes up often when talking with Seacrest
about his various jobs. "American Idol" has become a hot topic of
discussion on his Star 98 show, and he has used the program to
interview some of the contestants the day after they were eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   Paul O'Malley, vice president and general manager of KYSR, says
it's too soon to know whether ratings for Seacrest's 3-7 p.m. weekday
show have gone up this summer, but he says the station has reaped
other benefits from his increased visibility. "Ryan has been a
celebrity locally for some time, but it's the national advertisers
like Coca-Cola that have really jumped on the bandwagon," he says.
"They want to get a piece of him."</TE>
<TE>   Seacrest joined KYSR in 1995, left for a job in San Francisco and
then returned in 1997. He says the core audience for his show is
women 25 to 34. He and Foxx talk openly about their personal lives
and relationships in between songs by such artists as Coldplay, Goo
Goo Dolls, Sheryl Crow and Beck.</TE>
<TE>   Seacrest also hosts a weekly show featuring live, in-studio
performances by musical artists and interviews with these performers.
The 90-minute "Live From the Lounge With Ryan Seacrest" airs Sundays
at 8 p.m. on KYSR.</TE>
<TE>   By age 10, Seacrest knew he wanted a career in radio or
television. As a child, he would create audiotapes featuring him as a
DJ counting down the hits or taking requests. At 15, he befriended
Tom Sullivan, a nighttime disc jockey at Atlanta's WSTR-FM, who
allowed the young radio hound to hang out at the station and learn
how it operated.</TE>
<TE>   One night, Sullivan fell ill and was unable to host his show.</TE>
<TE>   "Tom thought the boss was out of town," Seacrest recalls. "So he
said, 'You go on the air.' So I did. Then the hotline rang and it was
the boss, Tony Novia. I was 15 1/2 years old and I didn't know what
to say. I thought it was over for me at the station. I went into
Tony's office the next day after school and he told me I wasn't bad.
He committed to coaching me and, at 17, he put me on the air as a
weekend disc jockey. I was very, very lucky."</TE>
<TE>   As a freshman at the University of Georgia, Seacrest landed a
position as host of ESPN's "Radical Outdoor Challenge," a kids' show
in which athletes competed against one another for cash prizes.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, in 1994, he headed to Hollywood, where his first job
was as host of a kids' version of "American Gladiators." Then he
hooked up with Star 98.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been one heck of a story balancing all the different things
I've been doing lately," he says. "But it hasn't felt like too much.
Are you busy? Sure. Are you tired? Absolutely. But look at what I get
to do for a living. It's been great."</TE>

<HD>Another Family Is About to Realize: Like Father, Like Son</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For Jean-Luc Borde, a successful gerontologist who's practiced in
affluent Versailles for 10 years, it is the crowning night of his
career. The town's elite have come to his luxurious home to award him
the coveted Order of Merit at an elaborate party hosted by his
elegant wife, Isa. "I was like an orphan," he tells the crowd, "and
you adopted me."</LD>
<LD>   It is a telling choice of words. For the doctor's father, in fact,
abruptly abandoned Jean-Luc and his brother decades before,
disappearing to Africa without a word of explanation. And in the
central conceit of Anne Fontaine's penetrating and emotionally
complex "How I Killed My Father," that absentee parent has somehow
chosen that special night to unexpectedly return to his sons' lives.</LD>
<LD>   Fontaine's film may have a thriller title reminiscent of "I Wake
Up Screaming" and "Kiss the Blood Off My Hands," but its interest is
in the psychological more than the literal aspects of its name.
Still, there is a palpable air of tension and suspense about this
insightful film, a realization that the greatest and most provocative
mystery of all is the human soul.</LD>
<TE>   In this respect, "How I Killed" resembles director Fontaine's
earlier exploration of the tangled complications of interpersonal
relationships, "Dry Cleaning," which focused, with her trademark
combination of empathy and evenhandedness, on the effect a
charismatic transvestite has on the lives of a married couple.</TE>
<TE>   Here, working with top French screenwriter Jacques Fieschi and an
exceptional cast (including Charles Berling as Jean-Luc and Natacha
Regnier, a world apart from her breakthrough role in "The Dream Life
of Angels," as Isa), Fontaine has made an even greater success. Alive
to nuance, unafraid of the intricate implications of emotional
situations, she's made a compelling exploration of the unfinished
business between fathers and sons, of the lasting influence parents
have over children even if neither side wants it to be that way.</TE>
<TE>   As with "Dry Cleaning," Fontaine and her collaborator have come up
with a singular central character with a forceful yet enigmatic
nature. Brilliantly played by the veteran Michel Bouquet, a star of
theater and film for more than 45 years, Jean-Luc's father Maurice by
his very nature sets off disturbances in the field from the moment he
arrives. He puts pressures, perhaps unintentional, perhaps not, on
preexisting fissures in his son's life, ensuring without really
trying to that what's been papered over inevitably unravels.</TE>
<TE>   Maurice and Jean-Luc not only look like father and son, they have
other similarities, starting with the profession of medicine, though
Maurice's work in impoverished Africa couldn't be more different than
the kind of ultra-bourgeois, heavy-on-the-Botox practice that has
made Jean-Luc wealthy. The main similarity between the two men,
however, is the combination of wariness and strained formality with
which they treat each other, the barbed remarks they exchange, the
chill in the air that is always between them.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly Maurice (and this is one of the gifts of Bouquet's
performance) has an unknowability and impenetrability about him,
characterized by an enigmatic half grin that can be infuriating.
Maurice is completely imperturbable, without the slightest interest
in apologizing for, justifying or even explaining the desertion of
his family. Even in his 70s, there is a dangerous presence about the
man, the sense that every remark he makes is a move in an elaborate
chess game in which he holds an unfair advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Maurice also has a kind of appeal that even Jean-Luc can't
deny. "If I met him by chance," he tells Isa, "I'd have fallen for
his charm." Which, gradually, is what those closest to Jean-Luc do,
especially his wife. Even his brother Patrick (Stephane Guillon), a
ne'er-do-well who works as Jean-Luc's chauffeur while moonlighting as
a stand-up comic, is not immune. This even though Patrick was
initially so resistant to his father for leaving when he was but 4
that he refused to so much as be in the same room with him</TE>
<TE>   For Jean-Luc, things are different. With his withdrawn, watchful
intelligence and an anger that lurks coiled under his placid surface,
he is still furious at his father, so much so that he seems almost to
have changed places with him, to have inherited the very traits that
disturbed him most as a child. When Jean-Luc tells Isa that "he has
eyes like ice, he judges you calmly, down to the bone," he could be
talking about himself as much as Maurice.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most gratifying aspects of "How I Killed My Father" is
that it couldn't be less interested in taking sides in this primal
conflict. As the film's characters head into uncharted, inevitably
explosive emotional territory against the backdrop of Jocelyn Pook's
unnerving music, you can feel director/co-writer Fontaine's
intelligence probing and illuminating this high-tension, high-stakes
situation. Truly, there can be nothing as complex as the simplest
human relationships, and nothing as satisfying as a film that
understands that as this one does.</TE>

<HD>Two Backstage Views of Tennessee Williams and His Demons</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tennessee Williams called them his "blue devils"--bouts of anxiety or
depression that could make him nearly suicidal. They shattered his
life but fueled his art.</LD>
<LD>   Such behind-the-scenes drama continues to fascinate theatergoers
almost as much as Williams' plays do, as evidenced by a couple of
long-running shows that recently announced extensions. The haunting
"Tennessee in the Summer," at the Laurelgrove Theatre, contemplates
the downward spiral of Williams' later years, while the less
effective "Mr. Williams and Miss Wood," at the Chandler Studio, takes
an overarching look at his career and, particularly, his relationship
with his influential agent, Audrey Wood.</LD>
<LD>   Joe Besecker's "Tennessee in the Summer" takes place in June 1972
in New York, where Williams is promoting his play "Small Craft
Warnings" and working on revisions to "Out Cry."</LD>
<TE>   As the audience enters the theater, the 61-year-old Williams (Jack
Heller) is already seated before a typewriter in his hotel room,
trying to will the words to come. The floor is littered with
discarded writing attempts. An empty liquor bottle lies on its side,
and Williams idly fingers a bottle of pills--a chilling precursor of
his death in February 1983, when he will swallow and suffocate on the
pill-bottle cap he uses to feed himself two Seconal capsules.</TE>
<TE>   A woman (Shareen Mitchell) in a white satin nightgown is asleep in
Williams' bed. When she wakes, she complains about "the unearthly
aroma of decaying paper" in the room and says: "You're wasting your
time writing this play. The critics have already written your
obituary."</TE>
<TE>   This dark angel's identity is revealed as Williams' fevered state
carries him back to the great loves of his life: his sweet but
mentally unstable sister, Rose (Louise Davis), abandoned in Williams'
haste to leave home, and lean, handsome Frank Merlo (Robert Standley,
in a surpassingly tender portrayal), pushed away despite nearly 15
years of devoted companionship.</TE>
<TE>   Under Barbara Bain's direction, the action remains grippingly
true-to-life, even as it unfolds in a haze of heat and memory (evoked
by designers Thomas Meleck, set, and Kathi O'Donohue, lights).</TE>
<TE>   What "Tennessee in the Summer" shows us, "Mr. Williams and Miss
Wood" merely tells us. Max Wilk adapted the piece from the memoir
"Represented by Audrey Wood," which the agent wrote with Wilk's
assistance.</TE>
<TE>   In the Action/Reaction Theater Company presentation, Williams and
Wood sit at a heavenly version of Sardi's, where they spend most of
their time turned toward the audience, chronologically listing
Williams' accomplishments and Wood's contributions to them.</TE>
<TE>   The younger Williams (Richard Scofield) depicted here is, at
first, more courtly and kind than the one in "Tennessee in the
Summer." But as time passes, drugs and booze--along with deepening
neurosis--cause him to behave irrationally toward Wood (Diana
Angelina, who lends elegance and a touch of motherliness to this
no-nonsense businesswoman).</TE>
<TE>   Director Michael Holmes has added a waiter (David Stewart) to the
action, which gives Scofield someone to flirt with when the
reminiscences begin to focus on Williams' personal excesses. But with
Scofield and Angelina essentially trapped in their booth, the staging
remains awfully static.</TE>

<LD>   Pitt in the Doghouse With 'Fountain' Crew</LD>
<LD>   An employee on the drama "The Fountain," who claimed he is
representing the entire crew, is venting his anger at Brad Pitt for
pulling out of the project and putting hundreds of jobs on the line.</LD>
<TE>   According to his letter to the Ain't It Cool Web site, director
Darren Aronofsky and producer Gil Adler told the crew that the
project had been scuttled in the wake of Pitt's departure two months
before the shoot in Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Although the creative team tried to line up someone else of his
stature, no one was available on such short notice, the filmmakers
were quoted as saying--and the studio would not go ahead without a
big box office draw.</TE>
<TE>   A Warner Bros. spokeswoman in Burbank declined to comment on the
movie's status Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt is said to be tackling another Warner Bros. movie
instead--playing Achilles in Wolfgang Petersen's "Troy." The actor,
the crew member's letter contends, has been insensitive to the human
toll of his "prima donna Hollywood antics."</TE>
<TE>   Aronofsky and Adler could not be reached. Pitt's publicist
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Deals, Deals ... and, Yes, More Deals</TE>
<TE>   Sony Pictures Classics has acquired worldwide rights to
documentarian Errol Morris' feature about former U.S. Secretary of
Defense Robert McNamara, slated for release next year, and the U.S.
rights to "The Statement," a political thriller starring Michael
Caine, to be directed and produced by Norman Jewison, the Hollywood
Reporter says.... Showtime has given the go-ahead to "Deacons of
Defense," a docudrama about a secretive black militia group in the
1960s. Forest Whitaker and Ossie Davis will star....Lions Gate Films
has bought North American rights to "Stevie," a documentary from
director Steve James ("Hoop Dreams") about the life of a troubled man
to whom James had once been a Big Brother.</TE>

<TE>   Denver, Houston Undergo Budget Cuts</TE>
<TE>   A "50th? No Way!" campaign is underway in Denver--a response to
the fact that Colorado, already 46th in per-capita state funding for
the arts, is making further cuts in appropriations to the Colorado
Council on the Arts.</TE>
<TE>   A group of artists and arts organizations met this week to map out
strategy and distribution of 10,000 buttons statewide. "The reaction
should really be one of utter amazement and utter anger," said Brian
Vreeland, a member of the steering committee. "We could potentially
be last in the country. It's deplorable."</TE>
<TE>   As part of the $228-million trim of the state budget, Gov. Bill
Owens announced on May 31 that he's dropping the arts council's
appropriations from about $1.9 million in 2002 to $1.2 million next
year.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, meanwhile, the Houston Symphony announced its cuts this
week.</TE>
<TE>   To counter a deficit expected to exceed $1.6 million this season,
the band suspended three money-losing concert series, reduced its
staff by 15% and instituted pay cuts for all administrative staff.
The trims could save $500,000, said Anne Kennedy, the symphony's
executive director.</TE>
<TE>   RADIO</TE>
<TE>   Sinbad Returning to the Local Airwaves</TE>
<TE>   Sinbad, who until recently had a morning show on KHHT-FM (92.3),
will return to the station starting Saturday in a weekly syndicated
show. "Sinbad's Psychedelic Shack" will premiere at 8 a.m. and
feature the comedian's favorite "old school" tunes.</TE>
<TE>   Sinbad's weekday run began last February and ended Aug. 30,
replaced by a show that prominently features dance and R&amp;B tunes. It
marked the station's second failed attempt to establish a comedy
foothold in the critical morning-drive period, having previously
tried a show with comedian George Lopez.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   The Sci Fi Channel has canceled its original series "Farscape,"
produced by Jim Henson TV, because of increasing production costs and
a declining core audience....A half-hour service commemorating the
Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur will be televised Sunday. "Yom Kippur:
Day of Atonement," airing on the Hallmark Channel at 7:30 a.m. and
KDOC-TV at 10:30 a.m., features Larry King, Arthur Hiller, Theodore
Bikel, Nell Carter, Mary Hart and Leonard Maltin....The Hollywood
Film Festival will present DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey
Katzenberg--a producer on "Shrek" and "Spirit: Stallion of the
Cimarron"--with the festival's newly created Tex Avery Animation
Award in October....The Sundance Channel will show "Won't Anybody
Listen," a documentary about Anaheim rock band NC-17's attempts to
make it in the music business, on Oct. 25 as part of a new
Friday-night series of music-related films. Director Dov Kelemer's
documentary had its world-premiere screening last year at the
Hollywood Film Festival....Robert Waller, author of the bestselling
novel "The Bridges of Madison County," has offered a $10,000 reward
for information leading to the conviction of the person responsible
for burning down the 119-year-old Cedar Bridge--the Iowa landmark
where the lead characters of the movie made from his book planned a
romantic rendezvous....Jason Ritter, currently on the big screen in
"Swimfan," is replacing Brad Renfro in New Line's "Freddy Vs. Jason."</TE>

<HD>What the Fuss May Be About: 4 From Berlin</HD>
<DH>An exhibition of mid-career artists is marked by their
fascination with the very exercise of painting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY MYERS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Berlin is one of those places that everyone seems to be talking about
these days. The exhibition at Christopher Grimes gallery, titled
"Bilder aus Berlin" and composed of four mid-career painters who are
based in that city, gives a few hints as to why. Intelligently
curated by Boston-based collector Ken Freed, the work is
stylistically diverse but distinguished by a common fascination with
the practice of painting as well as by a notable attraction to issues
of architecture and space.</LD>
<LD>   Achim Kobe's two loosely geometrical wallpaper works, each of
which covers the surface of a different wall, address the spatial
dynamics of the gallery. While the designs are fairly unexceptional,
they have a curiously faded, even dilapidated quality that makes them
feel soft and rather pleasant to be around.</LD>
<LD>   Daniela Brahm's large paintings of bland, boxy buildings resemble
blown-up architectural drawings. With sharp, impersonal lines, flat
colors, thin paint and industrial materials like wood and vinyl
adhesive, the works are dry. But they also exude an appealing sense
of utilitarian optimism.</LD>
<TE>   Erik Schmidt's paintings, by contrast, are thick and wet, with
frank compositions (quotidian cityscapes), electric color and oily
globs of paint. If Brahm's works look like diagrams, these are more
like frosted cakes. The density can be stifling, especially when the
works are crowded into the gallery's small back room, but the light
that Schmidt manages to convey through the color is quite striking.</TE>
<TE>   Included alongside these paintings are half a dozen surprisingly
delicate ink drawings by the same artist. Here, in the absence of
color, Schmidt reveals a sound sense of spatial organization and an
elegant manner with line.</TE>
<TE>   Anton Henning is the trickster of the group, painting not in a
single, identifiable style, but in a variety of guises. One image--a
loud, stylized arrangement of yellow flowers--calls to mind the
lobbies of mid-priced hotels. Another--the bare chest of a woman,
rendered solely in shades of red--looks like something a talented
teenage boy might reproduce from a magazine ad. One senses that each
of Henning's canvases is only a fragment of a larger conversation
that one needs a few more clues to understand.</TE>
<TE>   The impression is explicit in what is perhaps the most exciting of
the works, "Interieur No. 85," which depicts a brash pink, orange and
turquoise interior with three paintings on the wall: a Van Gogh, a
Matisse and one of Henning's own--a sketchy but weirdly satisfying
picture of two nude children and a goat that also hangs, full-sized,
alongside "Interieur No. 85" in the gallery.</TE>
<TE>   There is a raw sense of pleasure to these paintings, which makes
it tempting to discount them at first glance but difficult,
ultimately, to resist them.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the four artists approaches the terms of two-dimensional
representation in a markedly different manner. But each appears to do
so with gusto, which makes for a very likable show on either side of
the Atlantic.</TE>

<TE>   Testing the Bounds of Photographic Truth</TE>
<TE>   In the photographs that make up his first solo exhibition, Florian
Maier-Aichen seems to be treading carefully around the edges of his
medium, testing its boundaries and courting its capacity for
illusion. In several works, this exploration involves the
incorporation of sculpture and other media.</TE>
<TE>   "Faith and Failure" is a photograph of a three-dimensional replica
(constructed by the artist) of a text-based drawing by Mungo Thomson.
A clever nod to Thomson, for whom replication and imitation are
central themes, the work challenges traditional media divisions and
befuddles the viewer's sense of scale.</TE>
<TE>   In other works, Maier-Aichen plays with the possibilities of
digital manipulation. One of the most beguiling works in this vein is
"Untitled (Freeway Crash)," a roughly 4-by-5-foot aerial photograph
of a complicated freeway interchange. The image is entirely
believable, even banal--but for a small segment of one overpass that
has crumbled into several pieces and fallen to the ground below.</TE>
<TE>   Maier-Aichen, who hails from Germany but recently received his MFA
from UCLA (his work appeared in the Hammer Museum's "Snapshot"
exhibition last year), is clearly a product of the digital age and
employs these tricks with minimal self-consciousness. The
malleability of the photographic image is a presumption in this work,
not a novelty.</TE>
<TE>   That said, what makes the work feel substantial, rather than just
clever, is its respect for the aesthetics of the medium. These
pictures are, on the whole, gorgeous photographs.</TE>
<TE>   "Untitled (Mount Wilson)" is perhaps the most striking example. An
elevated view of L.A. at night, manipulated in some
not-quite-identifiable way to give the city an unsettling
preternatural glow, the picture reads like good fiction--as truth
without the burden of actuality.</TE>
<TE>   Blum &amp; Poe, 2042 Broadway, Santa Monica, (310) 453-8311, through
Oct. 5. Closed Sundays, Mondays.</TE>

<TE>   Richard Neutra, Fascinated Traveler</TE>
<TE>   Richard Neutra, who emigrated from Vienna to Los Angeles in 1923,
is an architect known for sharp lines and right angles, steel grids
and glass walls. The drawings that make up this exhibition at the
newly reopened Earl McGrath Gallery offer a somewhat different view.
Made during a trip to Africa in 1958, they describe what was to
Neutra an exotic locale, full of soft lines, curves, earthy colors
and organic materials.</TE>
<TE>   The drawings--more than two dozen in all--are quick and loose but
adept. The subjects are diverse and reflect a traveler's fascination.
There are buildings of all sorts, from village huts to towering
mosques, figures engaged in a variety of unspecified activities and
numerous landscape views.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout, Neutra's rendition of form is wonderfully substantial.
Walls bulge with life, trees seem to breathe and sway. The colors,
though spare (the palette consists primarily of beige, green and
turquoise), are appealingly vibrant. The line is quick and
expressive.</TE>
<TE>   There's something inherently exciting about encountering an
artist's personal drawings; it's like catching a glimpse behind a
friend's words into his or her actual thoughts. In this case, it is a
glimpse behind Neutra's ideas about space and form, as expressed in
the buildings he designed, and into his actual experience of these
qualities.</TE>
<TE>   The drawings are records of how Neutra spent his time observing.
Through them, one can begin to imagine what an expanse of Kenyan
grassland, a mud wall in an ancient city or a rough-hewn canoe
abandoned on a beach could have meant to a man so invested in the
stiff tenets of Western Modernism.</TE>

<TE>   Poetic Paintings Touched by Angels</TE>
<TE>   Matthew Brown's recent paintings, on view at Michael Kohn Gallery,
are based on Renaissance depictions of angels: tall, lithe,
luxuriously draped figures with arched wings and thin, gentle hands.
They appear singly or in pairs and fill Brown's large canvases
completely.</TE>
<TE>   The tone of the work is not antique or nostalgic, as the subject
might suggest, but distinctly photographic. The angels have been
copied from blurry black-and-white reproductions rather than actual
paintings. Several are even conveyed in the reversed tones of a
negative, and they bear clear traces of digital manipulation.</TE>
<TE>   Angels are tricky subjects--much-abused motifs plagued with
endless treacly associations. Brown's photographic twist goes a long
way toward disabling the potential kitsch factor, as does his choice
of the relatively austere Renaissance angel over the fleshier and
more commonly quoted Baroque variety.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, however, the paintings succeed on the merit of their
visual poetics. They're lovely to look at. The surface of each canvas
is smooth and beautifully glossy, giving the impression that the
figures are suspended in clear liquid. (Brown creates the texture by
mixing balsam oil with his paint.) The forms are soft and
indistinct--indeed, the best among them are the least distinct--the
compositions swirlingly sensual and the tones lush.</TE>
<TE>   Each painting is titled with a variation on the word
"touch"--"Touch Me," "Blind Touch," "Retouched," "Touchable,"
"Touching," etc.--which calls to mind, perhaps unintentionally, what
is surely one of the best angel tales yet written in the modern age:
Wim Wender's "Wings of Desire." In that 1988 film, it is precisely
the inability to touch--to make physical contact with the earthly
world--that drives the protagonist to hurl himself from angelic into
human form. One wonders if similar longings are afoot beneath the
pristine surfaces of these angels' world.</TE>

<HD>Charming Cast Buoys Overstuffed 'Wallace'</HD>

<AU>David C. Nichols</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Notable talent provides the support system for "Women and Wallace" at
the Actor's Lab.</LD>
<LD>   Jonathan Marc Sherman's fact-based play begins with Wallace (the
affecting Josh Zuckerman) and soul mate Nina (Mila Kunis of
television's "That '70s Show") gazing at each other in profile. He
intones "I love you" and brandishes a tomato, and the prologue ends.</LD>
<LD>   It is followed by 6-year-old Wallace's direct address, with
Zuckerman's childlike singsong charming the audience. Then Mom
(Heather Avery Clyde) packs Wallace off to school and, as Paul Lohr's
lighting plot suddenly goes red, slits her throat.</LD>
<TE>   The freewheeling narrative traces Wallace's interactions with the
women he fears losing: grandmother (the excellent Barbara Gruen),
elementary and high school crushes (Alexandra Westmore), therapist
(Clyde), college deflowerer (Nikki Winston) and Nina, arriving during
the final quarter for Wallace's deliverance.</TE>
<TE>   If this sounds like an overstuffed one-act, it is. Sherman writes
prismatic sequences of bright wit (Wallace's school days) and
emotional impact (the scenes with Grandma), but the script suffers
from premature gestation, Michael Woolson's impressive direction
notwithstanding.</TE>
<TE>   The explicated psychology dominating the dialogue is essentially
subtextual, and while Kunis radiates a warmth seldom exploited by her
series, her conflict resolution is as abrupt as Wallace's maternal
Sylvia Plath analogies are obvious.</TE>

<HD>'Terra Latina' Moves the Earth</HD>
<DH>Dance* Lyon's dazzling and innovative biennial blowout is
really shaking this year as it presents the pure, exhilarating moves
of Latin America.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LYON, France</DL>
<LD>To a matinee audience of 600 screaming, stamping school kids,
Brazil's Bale de Rua launched the 10th Biennale de la Danse here,
performing home-grown hip-hop of spectacular daring and originality:
commercial MTV-style infused with irresistible South American steps,
rhythms and social priorities.</LD>
<LD>   Mostly teenagers or just over the hill into their 20s, the Bale de
Rua dancers might never have heard of the Biennale de la Danse before
being invited to perform in it.</LD>
<LD>   But in the European dance world and, more recently the U.S., the
event has come to be recognized as a dazzling and innovative blowout
that takes over France's second city for three weeks of performances,
free dance lessons, a film series, exhibits, educational forums,
receptions, balls and a dance-parade, or grand defile, that this year
is expected to enlist 4,500 participants.</LD>
<TE>   Past Lyon biennials have focused on the dance of the Silk Road,
the Mediterranean, Africa and the U.S., with French companies always
invited to supplement the guests' achievements. This year, the
$5-million budget goes to an exploration of what everyone normally
calls Latin America but which red-and-white polka-dotted posters and
banners throughout Lyon label "Terra Latina: From the Rio Grande to
Tierra del Fuego."</TE>
<TE>   Coming from a dozen countries, 36 companies are performing, most
of them in works never before seen in Europe, 10 in pieces
commissioned by the Biennale. The performances take place all over
Lyon, in big venues and small, and in neighboring communities.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday's opening night, for example, Mexicans danced upstairs
in the main theater of the Lyon Opera, while Venezuelans performed in
the studio space downstairs. At the same time, the Brazilian
hip-hoppers were in a small theater in the nearby town of Decines and
a second Venezuelan company performed at Lyon's 1,200-seat Maison de
la Danse. Houses were full even early in the week. With festival
ticket prices no higher than $30 and often half that amount, the
crowds include families, students and France's seasoned dance fans.</TE>
<TE>   The buzz would be remarkable anywhere, but is doubly so given that
very few recognizable names are scheduled. Indeed, the companies
themselves largely represent not only Terra Latina but also terra
incognita, according to Biennale artistic director Guy Darmet.</TE>
<TE>   "Europe has never seen these companies," he said, just before the
Bale de Rua debut on Day 1, "and it is very important that this kind
of work finds an international audience."</TE>
<TE>   Helping ensure that possibility, Darmet says, are talent-scouting
festival directors from Germany, England, Israel and other countries,
though not, so far, the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles has seen a handful of the Biennale troupes: France's
Compagnie Maguy Marin and Conjunto Folklorico Nacional de Cuba,
Tangokinesis of Argentina and Grupo Corpo of Brazil, which is
returning to the Southland this season.</TE>
<TE>   But Bale de Rua has never danced outside Brazil until now, and it
would be hard to overestimate the effect of its triumph on the
performers, who were street kids, car-washers and mechanics just a
few years earlier. In Marco Antonio Garcia and Jose Marciel Silva's
plotless "And Now, Jose?" these 13 men and one woman not only kicked
international butt, they also embodied the conflict between
traditional rural values and contemporary urban life, often managing
to fuse the two through sheer force of will.</TE>
<TE>   This need to sustain a sense of identity while still integrating
influences from all over the world also dominated a Biennale press
conference that featured the leaders of Danzahoy, pioneers in
searching for a truly Venezuelan form of modern dance. "In Latin
America, we're always looking at what's going on outside and saying,
'We're not like that,' " explained company artistic director Adriana
Urdaneta.</TE>
<TE>   Echoing Darmet, Urdaneta spoke of Latin American dance as being
unaccountably invisible to the rest of the dance world, even to other
Latin Americans. "We know what Germany is doing, what the U.S. is
doing, but we don't know what's happening next door in Colombia," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Biennale attempts to help shatter this status quo, and
certainly "Exodus," by Urdaneta's sister Luz, deserved the attention
Wednesday in a Danzahoy performance boldly juxtaposing postmodern
style and the volcanic intensity of tango.</TE>
<TE>   Using hyperventilation as a motif leading to collapse and the act
of blowing a kiss as a cry of need torn from the mouth, this suite
took the passivity out of loneliness and despair, energizing them
with engulfing power.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout, flickering light patterns and sudden shifts in
brightness seemed to victimize the 14-member cast, threatening to
obliterate them. But they fought back, and their valiant stand made
them heroes, none more than the alternately fierce and sensitive
Jacques Broquet, arguably the first star discovery of this Biennale.</TE>
<TE>   No choreography in the event's initial-week lineup proved riskier
and more original, however, than Leyson Ponce's "Song for Dead
Children," performed by Venezuela's Dramo Dramaturgia del Movimiento
with chilling innocence. Set to Mahler's "Kindertotenlieder" as well
as native folk and popular music, it began with projections of
children's toys and deadly household objects that can look like toys:
matches, power tools, guns, etc. It then used its seven-member cast
to dramatize the dangers of childhood, including dressing up like an
adult to seek love and acceptance only to find the same fate as
JonBenet Ramsey.</TE>
<TE>   It ended with a sweet little ritual: a child's playtime funeral,
not for a doll or a pet but for a whole race of doomed playmates.</TE>
<TE>   Alas, it would be misleading to suggest that everything seen so
far at the Biennale offered the satisfactions of the Brazilian and
two Venezuelan productions. For instance, on Tuesday, Compania
Nacional de Danza de Mexico tired the eye and deadened the mind with
"A Trip to the Moon," Raul Parrao's overextended tribute to the 100th
anniversary of the film of the same name by Lyon's own Georges
Melies.</TE>
<TE>   The audience wore red and green glasses to enable 3-D projections
to make their effect, but the antic, gesture-dominated dancing looked
flat even in the cancan finale.</TE>
<TE>   However, nobody has ever put more Latino dance on European stages
at any one time than this Biennale, and "Terra Latina" continues
through Sept. 29 with its tour of a largely unexplored realm of
artistry. Thirty-two companies to go.</TE>

<HD>Beckett Is Getting the Star Treatment</HD>
<DH>Big names in theater and film participate in screen
versions of several plays. PBS is their playhouse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Gielgud stands like a mannequin throughout most of his final
screen appearance, in Samuel Beckett's "Catastrophe." He's playing an
actor who's putty in the hands of a dictatorial stage director,
portrayed by Harold Pinter.</LD>
<LD>   With David Mamet as the director of the six-minute "Catastrophe,"
it's hard to recall a film of this length that had more star names
affiliated with it.</LD>
<LD>   The six other films in "Stage on Screen: Beckett on Film," Sunday
on KCET and KVCR, are also shorts. They were filmed as part of an
ambitious project by Irish producers Michael Colgan and Alan Moloney
that created new screen versions of all 19 of Beckett's plays. PBS'
"Stage on Screen" is presenting two programs from the project: this
initial round-up of seven short plays and a "Waiting for Godot"
that's slated for New Year's Day.</LD>
<TE>   The opening program offers an impressive variety of approaches to
Beckett, woven together with documentary material narrated by Jeremy
Irons. Considering the abstruse nature of some of the plays, the
commentary helps make the material more viewer-friendly. But it also
imparts the feeling of a classroom exercise at times.</TE>
<TE>   "Catastrophe" is up first. It's unsettling to see Pinter's
scowling character instruct his young assistant (Rebecca Pidgeon) to
prod and poke and expose Gielgud's aged flesh. Star casting pays off
here.</TE>
<TE>   Narrator Irons points out that the two roles in "Ohio Impromptu"
were designed to be played by actors who look like each other and
that Charles Sturridge's film version enables them to look exactly
alike by casting one actor (Irons) in both roles. It's a point well
taken. Certainly the casting helps us appreciate that both the silent
man and the one who's recalling memories are different halves of the
same character. This becomes even more apparent at the end, as the
film medium allows one of the characters to simply evaporate.</TE>
<TE>   Film also comes in handy at the end of "Come and Go," in which the
three women who come and go and whisper about each other are finally
united by a close-up of their clasped hands.</TE>
<TE>   If you leave the room for snacks, you may miss the 45-second
"Breath," directed by Damien Hirst. The camera sweeps over a littered
landscape to the accompaniment of one breath. On second thought, go
get those snacks; this one doesn't amount to much.</TE>
<TE>   "Play" is usually staged with a tight spotlight taking turns
focusing on the two women and one man, trapped in urns, who endlessly
discuss their romantic triangle. Here, instead of the lights, the
camera moves. And in the background, director Anthony Minghella
depicts a field of similarly encased people, whose final hum implies
a whole world of stasis. Alan Rickman, Kristin Scott Thomas and
Juliet Stevenson play the lovers, their faces encrusted in sores.</TE>
<TE>   "Act Without Words II" suggests the infant days of cinema as two
silent clowns go through their daily routines on a gleaming white
background that looks like a film strip. Enda Hughes directed.</TE>
<TE>   "What Where," directed by Damien O'Donnell, is the only
over-produced film in the bunch, with an elaborate set, sci-fi-style
costumes and unnecessary overhead shots.</TE>
<TE>   "Stage on Screen: Beckett on Film" airs Sunday from 10 to 11:30
p.m. on KCET and KVCR.</TE>

<HD>Logic Falls Victim in 'Blood Crime'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROLYN PATRICIA SCOTT</AU>
<BD>By CAROLYN PATRICIA SCOTT TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD></LD>
<TE>   It starts out on a riff from the John Lee Hooker song "Boom Boom."
And tonight's "Blood Crime" (8 p.m., USA) could use the second line
from that blues classic for its tag line: "Gonna shoot you right
down!"Yes, this first of USA Network's Crime Fridays original movie
offerings has plenty of shooting and bad guys; unfortunately, it's
the plot that falls dead{mdash}the victim of a criminal lack of
common sense.The film starts off well enough with the de rigueur
shootout. Then it jumps{mdash}who knows why?{mdash}to lead Daniel
Pruitt (Johnathon Schaech, from "That Thing You Do," "Houdini")
leaving the force, hitting the road with his wife (Elizabeth Lackey)
and aiming for the simple life. First stop: a seedy joint where the
ex-detective chats up the bartender within earshot of the local
lowlifes: "We're camping out." Not real smart.But the contrivances
get worse: The couple makes camp in the woods but has no provisions,
so when it's good and dark, Pruitt's got to make a run to the quickie
mart for food. Meanwhile, back at the campsite, the wife is attacked;
the perpetrator gets away. Pruitt finally returns and they head for
the hospital. On the way, the hysterical wife sees her
attacker{mdash}"It's him! It's him!"{mdash}and Pruitt pistol-whips
the man. Then, upon their arrival in the emergency room, the wife
takes one look at an orderly and screams: "It's him! It's him!" The
possible case of mistaken identity seems promising{mdash}particularly
when the first alleged attacker is wheeled into the same emergency
room, DOA{mdash}but what sappy plotting doesn't kill, James Caan
finishes off with a deadening performance as the local
sheriff.&amp;lt;/txt&amp;gt;</TE>

<LD>Hope springs eternal, version 5,182:</LD>
<LD>   In a small corner office in the heart of Hollywood, Bill Ferguson,
a 39-year-old producer, and Alex Nicoll, a 28-year-old director, are
making their pitch.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a teen comedy, geared toward the 18-to-30-year-old male
crowd, although there are a couple of things for the women too," says
Nicoll, a slight Brit with dark, spiky hair and short sideburns. "Two
guys have a couple of hours to clean up their parents house after a
party. They also have a dead body on their hands .... It's a snowball
movie--faster, faster, faster. It's the kind of stuff that people
have been through in their life, except for the dead body, maybe.
It's comedic." He pauses for a second. "Oh, and it's a love story
too."</LD>
<TE>   The title of Nicoll and Ferguson's project? "That Darn Bear."</TE>
<TE>   Don't ask.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't tell you why; it would give the movie away," says Nicoll.</TE>
<TE>   Ferguson, a former director of direct marketing in Utah,
interjects. "The product we've got is solid."</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, Nicoll was an attorney in London. Now he's emulating
his silver-screen idols: Steven Spielberg, Ridley Scott, Sam Raimi
and "Hitchcock, obviously, me being English and all." In a month, he
will begin directing his first. He says he's totally confident.</TE>
<TE>   This Hollywood dream began last October, when 22-year-old Atlanta
native Joey Valezquez, gave Nicoll the first 50 pages of a script.
Nicoll, on his way to Las Vegas for the weekend, read it three times
before the plane touched down at McCarran International Airport. "It
was the funniest thing I've ever read."</TE>
<TE>   When Nicoll and Ferguson got together for a beer one evening, they
talked about the script, and Ferguson, who had also read it, was
equally enthusiastic. Before the week was out, the two had optioned
it and decided to make their feature debut. "It's the way to come out
of the gate," says Ferguson.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to make a lot of noise," says Nicoll.</TE>
<TE>   In their modest corner offices two floors above the Los Angeles
Film School on Sunset, where they met as students last year, Ferguson
sits behind a blond birch desk, Nicoll on the Cost Plus sofa. The two
have a pingpong pitch: When one trails off, the other picks up. The
result is the seamless spiel.</TE>
<TE>   Nicoll: "There is not another Alex Nicoll or Bill Ferguson out
there."</TE>
<TE>   Ferguson: "And we're great to work with."</TE>
<TE>   Nicoll: "We want to make something we can be proud of."</TE>
<TE>   Ferguson: "And make some money off [of]."</TE>
<TE>   Nicoll: "You can talk about it for years in a lecture hall, but
you have to learn how to load the camera and do it."</TE>
<TE>   Ferguson: "Between us, we have four features, in running time."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, that last requires a bit of math. He figures that the 12
short films he produced and the four shorts Nicoll directed as
students at the Los Angeles Film School add up to, yes, four
features. Their proposed debut project isn't big (it's about $1
million), but as Ferguson says, "There's no reason to come out of the
gate to make 'War and Peace.' " And, realistically, "That Darn Bear"
is no Tolstoy epic.</TE>
<TE>   "We only had a given amount of money to spend on location," says
Ferguson. "Everywhere we called, people laughed at us. Literally,
they laughed at us," he says, seemingly still a little shaken.</TE>
<TE>   Despite those early setbacks, the project is right on track. "I'd
put money in it," says Ferguson, the money man. "I feel confident,"
says Nicoll. "Unless I go blind on the first day of shooting, there
shouldn't be a problem."</TE>
<TE>   They both agree: It's not a job, it's a dream. And they're having
fun. "There are a lot of screamers out there," says Ferguson. "We
want to be making movies, but without having to be like that."</TE>
<TE>   He looks at Nicoll. "This last year, this was the best year of my
life," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "Every year will be like that from now on," says Nicoll.</TE>
<TE>   Not for Sale</TE>
<TE>   "The materials in this launch kit are copyrighted and being
provided for Fox Broadcasting Company Affiliate for press promotional
use only. Not for sale, resale, auction or Internet posting." This
admonition--a tradition on promotional video tapes--appeared recently
amid the chocolate, hip flask, wallet and drawings sent out to
promote "Firefly," a sci-fi series that premieres on the network next
week.</TE>
<TE>   The warnings, more and more frequently included with the press
kits and toys sent out by studios and networks hoping to drum up
coverage of new releases, are a response to the plethora of
promotional material being auctioned off or resold. On EBay, those
interested could find the press kit for WB's 1998/1999 season, which
at press time was going for $51. A press kit for "Xena: Warrior
Princess" had six bids, the highest at $40.99.</TE>
<TE>   A Fox spokesman said, "We need to protect our assets....These are
not designed for resale." But he didn't want to speculate how
promotional material ends up on EBay, or point fingers at the kits'
recipients, many of whom are media types operating under guidelines
that frown on profiting from press materials. "The materials," said
Fox's spokesman, "go to a wide range of outlets, some of which are
not press."</TE>

Kingston on "When I Was a Girl," on WE: Women's Entertainment Sept.

<HD>A Story Woven From the Heart</HD>
<DH>Author Sandra Cisneros gives a female voice to her complex
Latino family tale</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a painted Mexican trunk upstairs in her bright violet house in San
Antonio, Sandra Cisneros, the godmother of Chicana literature, keeps
her Mexican scarves rolled on broomsticks to prevent wrinkling. These
woven treasures, known in Spanish as rebozos, provided the central
image for her new epic novel, "Caramelo," to be published Sept. 24 in
English and Spanish by Knopf.</LD>
<LD>   The caramelo is a candy-striped rebozo, but the word in Spanish
also describes skin tone, one of the book's many underlying themes.
Cisneros spent nine years writing the book, a mosaic of storytelling,
destiny, Mexican culture and immigration. Her collection of
30-some-odd rebozos, Mexican kitsch, journal writings and her own
family history inspired the 433-page novel.</LD>
<LD>   "Everything got thrown in the pot. It became an hommage to my
father's life. I hope ... it changes the way you look at people, at
Mexicans and Mexican Americans," Cisneros said by telephone.</LD>
<TE>   "Caramelo" is a multigenerational saga of the Reyes family,
descendants of weavers who crafted rebozos to be used as shawls, baby
slings and tablecloths. The story weaves back and forth between
Chicago, where Cisneros grew up, and Mexico City, where her father
was raised. He often grew homesick for his native country and
Cisneros fondly remembers the car rides in a family caravan between
the two countries in the summers.</TE>
<TE>   Her father, Alfredo Cisneros del Moral, died in 1997. Cisneros was
the only girl in a family of seven children. "My father was a Mexican
who had a great love of Mexico. That gave me a great deal of
knowledge about Mexican pop culture. My mom was more cerebral, more
artsy. She listened to opera records."</TE>
<TE>   Surrounded by men in her family, Cisneros, 47, dreamed of being an
economically independent woman, free to choose her own lifestyle. She
now lives alone in the historic King William District, where her
choice of house paint caused controversy some years ago. She has a
boyfriend who lives in another city.</TE>
<TE>   With elements of autobiography, "Caramelo" is narrated by Celaya
"Lala" Reyes, a young girl whose Mexican parents frequently travel to
Mexico from their home in Chicago. The story moves through different
times in Lala's life, pinning together the story of her
great-grandparents, grandparents and parents, of U.S. immigration,
the Mexican revolution and women in history. Repeatedly, Lala's
"awful grandmother" interrupts her storytelling to complain she's not
being truthful.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not lies. They're healthy lies. So as to fill in the
gaps. You're just going to have to trust me," Lala tells her.</TE>
<TE>   Cisneros wanted to make it clear that Lala has control over the
family's story. Speaking in an aside to readers, Lala explains, "You
are the author of the telenovela of your life. Comedy or tragedy?
Choose."</TE>
<TE>   Latinas "are not in control of our lives," said Cisneros. "Our
cultural structure doesn't give us control. I was trying to make
Latinas more proactive.... We have inherited a lot of baggage from
our religion and the culture of our society."</TE>
<TE>   Cisneros adds historical footnotes in which she explains the
backgrounds of characters brought in for cameo appearances. Some come
directly from Mexican folklore. "I didn't want it to be dismissed as
just fiction," she said. "I am concerned about history and how these
characters are affected by fiction. I was trying to write a story
embedded in history, but history books leave out wonderful stories."</TE>
<TE>   Women in History</TE>
<TE>   The legendary children's singer Cri Cri, the renowned healer Maria
Sabina, ventriloquist and Ed Sullivan guest Wenceslao Moreno, better
known as Senor Wences, and dancer Tongolele are given roles in the
Reyes family story. Mexican trivia also pops up, such as the fact
that Mexicans began to name their dogs after Woodrow Wilson after he
authorized a Marine invasion there in 1914.</TE>
<TE>   The book ends with a four-page chronology of important historic
events that begin with the Spanish conqueror Hernan Cortes meeting
Aztec ruler Montezuma in 1519. Cisneros also tosses in facts such as
the 1926 recording of "Jurame" by Jose Mojica, the Mexican Valentino,
and the beginning of the bracero program, which gave 5 million
Mexican laborers work permits for 20 years beginning in 1942.</TE>
<TE>   Such footnotes are rare in fiction, said Renee H. Shea, a
professor of English and modern languages at Bowie State University
in Bowie, Md., but Cisneros used them well. They "were hilarious.
There was such a sassiness about it. On the one hand, they seem
random. On the other hand, they seem almost didactic. She is trying
to connect a lot to popular culture," trying to introduce Chicanos to
performers from several decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   Reviewers, too, seem pleased with the work. Booklist magazine
wrote, "Cisneros combines a real respect for history with a playful
sense of how lies often tell the greatest truths." Publishers Weekly
said the book's "hilarious accounts of family gatherings and
pitch-perfect bilingual dialogue make this a landmark work."</TE>
<TE>   A Solid Following</TE>
<TE>   Cisneros gained legions of fans with her 1984 novel, "The House on
Mango Street," which sold 2 million copies. With its analysis of
ethnicity and gender, that book soon became a staple of both
middle-school and college curricula in American literature, women's
studies and multicultural studies. Cisneros' subsequent books of
poetry and short stories offered a provocative Latina voice as well.</TE>
<TE>   "Caramelo" addresses race and class issues as certain characters
try to distinguish themselves as whiter or richer than their
neighbors or family members, in Mexico and in the United States.
Lala's grandfather, Narciso, tries to highlight his Spanish roots.
Narciso's family members "preferred to think of themselves as one of
las familias buenas, whose coat of arms had once adorned the doors of
these colonial buildings. After all, Senor Eleuterio was from
Seville, as the family like to remind anyone and everyone."</TE>
<TE>   Later in the story, Lala explains that "something happened when
[Mexicans] crossed the border. Instead of being treated like the
royalty they were, they were, after all, Mexicans, they were treated
like Mexicans, which was something that altogether startled
Grandmother. In the neighborhoods she could afford, she couldn't
stand being associated with these low-class Mexicans, but in the
neighborhoods she couldn't, her neighbors couldn't stand being
associated with her."</TE>
<TE>   The story of Lala's father, Inocencio Reyes, whom Cisneros has
made an upholsterer like her own father, is one of a man trying to
improve the lot of his family while keeping a toehold in his native
land. Page after page there are poetic salutes to Mexico and to the
barrios, analogies that alternately evoke sighs and peals of
laughter.</TE>
<TE>   Cisneros hopes the story has general appeal that will attract
those who know little about Latino culture. "My book was written to
protest xenophobia and the attitude against immigrants. I hope this
is going to be a way to look at 'the other' more humanely," she said.
"This is a story about Mexicans and Mexican Americans, but it is an
American story."</TE>

<LD>Imagine you're sitting in your classroom. You can look around and see
many other people. You have friends to play with and talk to. Now
imagine that you're alone in your classroom, because hardly anyone is
left in California.</LD>
<LD>   If you were a California condor about 20 years ago, you would be
alone in a giant classroom. That's because the endangered birds were
almost extinct--fewer than 10 were alive in 1986. That's when most of
the surviving condors were taken into captivity for their own safety.
Now, about 200 of the birds are alive. Some are even living in the
wild.</LD>
<LD>   Soon, you may be able to see California condors flying free in
Pinnacles National Monument, in Paicines, Calif. The National Park
Service is working with other groups to restore the condor and other
bird populations to the monument and other areas in California.</LD>
<TE>   The monument is home to many different species of butterflies,
bats, snakes, lizards, frogs, insects and plants. Its 30 miles of
trails wind along the remains of an ancient volcano, which has left
huge rock spires, deep caves and sheer-walled canyons as it has
eroded.</TE>
<TE>   Did You Know?</TE>
<TE>   * California condors are the largest flying birds in North
America. They can weigh as much as 25 pounds and have a wingspan of
almost 10 feet.</TE>
<TE>   * The giant rock formations for which the Pinnacles National
Monument is named are only a piece of an ancient volcano that formed
in the San Andreas rift zone thousands of years ago. Shifting land
carried the rocks 195 miles northwest of the rest of the volcano.</TE>
<TE>   * The Los Angeles Zoo is part of the condor recovery program. The
zoo does not display the birds, because they do not want them to
become too comfortable with humans before they are released into the
wild.</TE>
<TE>   Learn More</TE>
<TE>   * Read "The Condor (Endangered Animals &amp; Habitats)," by Karen D.
Povey.</TE>
<TE>   * Visit the monument online at www. nps.gov/pinn.</TE>
<TE>   * Ask your parents or teacher to take you to Pinnacles National
Monument in Central California, about 280 miles northwest of Los
Angeles.</TE>

<LD>The things that pass between serious writers and their editors
usually are intensely private.</LD>
<LD>   Like any process involving genuine intimacy, literary editing
presumes both parties' discretion. Its absence is what makes this
week's unusual publishing event--the reissuing of Gore Vidal's
historical novel "Creation"--more interesting still.</LD>
<LD>   The occasion is the latest installment in a 20-year-old quarrel
that ended the long and storied friendship between Gore Vidal and
Jason Epstein, then-editor in chief of Random House.</LD>
<TE>   Twenty-one years ago, Random House published "Creation." Set in
the 5th century BC, its protagonist, Cyrus Spitama, is the prophet
Zoroaster's grandson. During his education at the Persian court,
Cyrus befriends the future king Xerxes and later becomes his
emissary. While traveling on the king's behalf, the book's
hero-narrator meets Buddha, goes fishing with Confucius and has his
wall repaired by a young Athenian stonemason, Socrates.</TE>
<TE>   The original "Creation" was more than 500 pages long and became a
bestseller. The new version, reissued this week by Doubleday,
contains an extraordinary author's note:</TE>
<TE>   "For 21 years 'Creation' has been read by many people in many
languages; simultaneously, for 21 years, I have regretted that the
original book had been seriously damaged by an overly busy
editor...." Vidal writes. "Through various intricate but relentless
stratagems he managed to cut a number of key scenes.... Now, for a
new century, what was lost has been restored...."</TE>
<TE>   That "overly busy editor" was Epstein, who remains--as the
admiring head of another New York house described him this week --"a
God of publishing."</TE>
<TE>   Doubleday's executive editor, Gerald Howard, agreed that "Gore
writes the world's most unusual author's notes. I've been his editor
for three years, and I have pretty much learned not to try to tell
him what to say or do. But Jason is a pretty tough cookie, and I
think he can handle it."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Epstein dismissed the note as "typical, vintage Gore. I
didn't think particularly much of the book at the time. I found it
hard to read. I thought the book would benefit if there were less of
it. I could have cut anything and it would have been an improvement."</TE>
<TE>   Vidal was traveling in Europe and unavailable for comment. But in
his memoir, "Palimpsest," he recalls the years when he and Epstein
were close friends.</TE>
<TE>   The editing of "Creation" signaled an end to all that, current and
former Random House editors recall. Epstein had a long-standing
interest in antiquity, particularly the passage from paganism to
Christianity. He found Vidal's novel to be a stew of historical
inaccuracies, filled with impermissible exaggerations and assertions.</TE>
<TE>   Cuts were made. When the finished manuscript was circulated to
other Random House editors, however, the reaction was so negative
that Epstein gave the book to a young editor and instructed him to
trim it further. Vidal reluctantly accepted the redactions as the
price of publication. Later, when similar problems arose over the
editing of his novel "Live From Golgotha," he left Random House for
good.</TE>
<TE>   Doubleday's Howard said the reissue of "Creation" is unusual but
said he believes Vidal's "novels of classical history are just about
as good as those books get. He doesn't have too many peers in this
field, perhaps only Mary Renault."</TE>
<TE>   The decision to republish a hard-bound edition, the editor said,
resulted from an unexpected discovery. A scholar named Stephen Abbott
was doing some archival work on Gore's manuscripts at the University
of Wisconsin and found the sections that Random House had cut. He
brought them to Gore's attention. And, said Howard, "we thought, why
not do it as its creator intended?"</TE>
<TE>   Epstein remains unconvinced. "I think Gore is a better essayist
than he is a novelist. He can't really get inside the characters or
their lives. 'Creation' was a clever idea, since the main characters'
lives did overlap. But they didn't communicate, so the narrative
didn't make sense. Gore is touchy, and he loves being No. 1 and
making money. I urged him to write the historical novels, but the
work began to get rather strange. After a time, I couldn't do much
for him as publisher, and I thought myself that it was time to part."</TE>
<TE>   Howard said he is "sympathetic to both parties. I can very easily
put myself in Jason's position at the time, really feeling the need
to get the book down to cruiserweight size and deciding that certain
material was dispensable. I can also put myself in Gore's position.
It is an epic book and a long story. Now, circumstances have changed
and we are bringing it back to the public in the form Gore intended."</TE>
<TE>   One publishing executive, who asked not to be identified, chuckled
that "Gore holds to some of the most durable grudges in American
literature. With him, once you're out, you're out forever."</TE>
<TE>   Epstein seems to feel otherwise. "I still think of him as a
friend, even though we haven't spoken in 20 years," he said. "There
was no way to deal with him. He's impossible. But he is a fine
fellow--generous, decent, intelligent and talented. He is entitled to
write any preface he wants."</TE>

<HD>Helping Men Cast Off Chains</HD>
<DH>With service and advice, a new wave of specialty stores
challenges the malls for the fashion-seeking male customer</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL QUINTANILLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In less than three minutes, designer John Varvatos has knocked on
wood twice, tapping on a shiny wooden bench displaying rows of jeans.
Not that the New Yorker is superstitious. He's just thankful that
L.A. men are welcoming his eponymous Melrose Avenue shop--one of many
new specialty stores catering to men--a funky West Coast complement
to the designer's Manhattan SoHo location.</LD>
<LD>   Motorists have braked along Melrose, west of Robertson Boulevard,
to check out the chunky brown corduroy trench coats, cashmere gray
sweaters and luxe chalk-striped tailored suits on storefront
mannequins. Before the store's opening today, guys raced from their
cars to the glass windows and mouthed, "When do you open?"</LD>
<LD>   Nearby, on Martel Avenue, former 'N Sync stylists Annika Virdone
and Erik Rudy anxiously count down the hours to Monday's opening of
their MAN Los Angeles men's shoe and accessories shop, created for
guys "because they want to wear unique shoes and have nice bags just
like girls do," Virdone says.</LD>
<TE>   Veteran designer Allen B. Schwartz, who designs women's wear for
his chain of ABS stores--and is known for his speedy red-carpet-gown
knockoffs--is considering shops of his own for guys here and in New
York if his new Allen B. for Men line, which debuts in high end
boutiques next month, sells well.</TE>
<TE>   Sean in Santa Monica, Timoteo in West Hollywood, H Men at Sunset
Plaza all have opened in the last year, joining several local men's
specialty shops--Naked, Kbond, Lisa Kline Men, Scott Hill, Traffic
Men and Andrew Dibben. Many of the stores, some in funky
neighborhoods, have become hangouts, luring men with art exhibits,
reading areas, comfy chairs, food, gourmet coffee and wine--and, oh
yes, stylishly cool threads from international and local designers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like shopping in an old haberdashery," says Marshal Cohen,
co-president of NPDFashionworld, a Port Washington, N.Y.-based market
information company. He says men need knowledgeable service to build
wardrobes that have become just as important to image-making as the
latest Palm Pilot or cell phone.</TE>
<TE>   Men who do their own shopping, especially in cosmopolitan centers,
should not find it a chore but instead a leisure activity, says the
former Bloomingdale's buyer, who recalls how wine and cheese parties
at the store would attract men to hang out and watch the football
game. "It was like a men's club. Men are looking for that again."</TE>
<TE>   Many have found it away from the malls at quaint men's shops,
according to Cohen. "There's no other way to put it: Department
stores have zero taste level when it comes to men's clothing."</TE>
<TE>   In defense of department stores, Hope Brick, vice president and
fashion director for Robinsons-May stores, encourages men who have
not been in department stores for a while to try again. Her chain's
top priorities are customer service and helping men looking for
trends as well as shopping for classic and key fashion items.</TE>
<TE>   Retailers, big and small, have to work harder than ever to hook
male shoppers. American men forked over $58 billion on apparel last
year, slightly down from the previous year, according to
NPDFashionworld. And that includes younger guys, particularly the
coveted 18-to 34-year-old male shoppers spending more money on
clothes than any other male age group.</TE>
<TE>   "The menswear industry is getting a fashion wake-up call with
these men's shops," agrees David Wolfe, creative director of the New
York-based Doneger Group, a fashion trend consulting firm. "We have a
new generation of menswear consumers who are very label-conscious and
understand that fashion and style is a weapon that they can use
sexually, socially and professionally."</TE>
<TE>   Wolfe says, "Men of the past or at least since the 1960s tended to
blend into the background, dressing for power and comfort, and now
they have a whole new attitude toward style because of things such as
men's lifestyle magazines and seeing runway shows on the Internet."</TE>
<TE>   It's all about lifestyle, explains Tom Julian, an analyst with New
York-based Fallon Worldwide, an advertising and trend-tracking
agency, about the interest in men's shops. "The mass stores and
department stores have a tendency of still merchandising menswear by
classification--like a commodity--rather than a lifestyle. There is
the mind-set of the CEO types who live for the custom Savile Row
offering, and then there's the hip L.A. guy who wants the newest and
coolest." Varvatos opened his own stores so that he could showcase
his entire seasonal lines, in contrast to the edited lines selected
by buyers at Barneys New York, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and
Bergdorf Goodman. Being at the helm, he also can control the store's
visuals, doesn't have to share space with other designers and, most
important, can build his brand. His move has paid off at his
2-year-old SoHo store, where sales are up 41% over this time last
year, he says, knocking on wood again.</TE>
<TE>   He worked for Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren during the 1980s and
1990s, and the 45-year-old designer's first collection in 2000 earned
the Perry Ellis newcomer's award that year.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to be just another retailer," says the designer, who
departed L.A. for New York three days ago to prepare for a showing
next week of his spring 2003 men's collection, which he's calling "A
Frenchman in New York."</TE>
<TE>   "This is L.A., and I know the celebrity/stylist thing is going to
happen," Varvatos says while styling a mannequin in a double-faced
wool suit and skinny tie. Around him staffers assemble racks on a
wall for shoes, including Varvatos' Converse tennis shoes in suede
and leather trim.</TE>
<TE>   Dibben, whose Silver Lake atelier has been open for almost four
years, says: "I think that guys are really specific about what they
want, from the length of a shirt to the fit of a trouser. They have a
pretty definitive idea of what works for them and what doesn't. And I
think they get that at men's shops as opposed to shopping the mall."</TE>
<TE>   He says most men "like clothes that are familiar and yet new,"
which is why, as a designer, he is constantly reinventing classic
men's clothes: plain-front pants, T-shirts, a fitted jacket. "When
men's clothes become too extreme, then you are selling to a very
limited market. Guys want to be noticed, but just not too much," says
Dibben, who also teaches at Otis School of Design.</TE>
<TE>   For trend follower Ron Valdez, a regular at Dibben's, department
stores are practically off limits, except for occasional visits to a
Diesel or Armani Exchange specialty store. Valdez, 40, prefers the
shopping convenience at Dibben's, a short drive from his Echo Park
home. And he's sold on the simple but edgy designs that work for him
as an art dealer. But mostly he appreciates the designer's personal
service. Dibben recently discouraged him from buying another white
shirt because he had two others from the shop. "He not only knows
what's in my closet, but he knows what I look good in. I trust him,"
he says. "I went in as a customer and found a friend."</TE>
<TE>   Timoteo O'Campo, a former XOXO designer and creative director for
Baby Phat, opened his men's shop, Timoteo, 10 months ago after
realizing he had a knack for outfitting his friends, often purchasing
clothing for them on his travels.</TE>
<TE>   He sells menswear from Italian, German and L.A. designers as well
as his own creations. But he never produces more than 10 to 15 of
each item--jeans, hats, shirts--so that customers get the sense they
are wearing something designed just for them. Often, a man will bring
in a pair of boots and tell O'Campo, "I don't know what kind of
trousers to wear with these," and he'll offer advice. "The shop is
very fashion-driven. If guys want basic slacks and dress shirts they
can find that at the mall," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Campbell, manager of Kbond, owned by Karen Kimmel and James
Bond, says, "You're not gonna find Gucci and Prada here, and we don't
compete with the likes of Barneys, but we are building our own niche
of unique stuff because that's what guys want."</TE>
<TE>   For almost three years, shoppers have come to rely on Kbond for
help building their trendy as well as tailored wardrobes: sportswear
from L.A.-based Modern Amusement to suits from British designer Paul
Smith. The staff knows the tastes and styles of shoppers, select
clothes for them and then rings them up, Campbell says about the
one-on-one attention, hallmark of a true haberdashery.</TE>
<TE>   Says Varvatos: "Men, whether they have a sense of style or not,
are looking to shop someplace they can trust. A lot of guys really
need to be told how to put themselves together. They are looking for
that specialty store--like the men's haberdashery, that in general,
went away in the last 10 to 20 years--where they will feel
comfortable." On cue, Varvatos knocks on wood.</TE>

<HD>New York Premiere</HD>
<DH>Proceeds from agency's new shirt will benefit emerging
fashion designers</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Quintanilla</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For years, the favorite giveaway from fashion companies was a T-shirt
with the designer's logo. And for all of the years that the New York
runway shows were organized by the agency 7th on Sixth under tents in
Bryant Park on Sixth Avenue, many have wondered: Where's the 7th on
Sixth T-shirt?</LD>
<LD>   It's here, and it has potential as a collectible. Not only is it
the first official T-shirt to commemorate Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week,
but it's also designed by that fashion phoenix Miguel Adrover, who is
making a runway comeback this season. The Spanish-born designer of
much praise but little financial stability has crafted the shirt in
his signature style. He's added the woven cuffs and collar of a navy
blue polo shirt to a white cotton V-neck T-shirt. The unisex shirt
isn't dull like the usual giveaway. But then again, it's not free.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike previous Fashion Week promotional garb, the $30 shirt is
for sale to the public on the Mercedes-Benz Web site,
www.mbfwnyc.com, and some share of its proceeds will help support
runway shows for new and emerging designers.</LD>
<TE>   The shirt is only one element of the highly visible but highly
private fashion shows that will be on view to the public. Also for
the first time, Vogue will sponsor multiple video screens in the park
that will simulcast the shows as they happen inside the tents.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to celebrate and remind New York of how important the
fashion industry is to the city by bringing the collections to New
Yorkers," said Vogue spokeswoman Mistrella Egan. Fashion fans without
invitations now may see the shows from the videographer's
perspective, perhaps the best seat in the house.</TE>

<TE>   New Shop Caters</TE>
<TE>   to the Average Guy</TE>
<TE>   Guy pals Kelly Cole and Gary Wagner have opened LO-FI/Clothes for
Your World Tour on North Fairfax Avenue stocked with vintage leather
motorcycle jackets, rare rock T-shirts, Nudie of Hollywood suits and
a deejay ready to party with customers during store hours.</TE>
<TE>   Cole is hoping the shop will attract devoted customers--men and
women--interested in $40 shirts to $2,200 vintage suits, several made
by the legendary Nudie of Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "My partner and I are straight American guys who have been so
alienated at times at the way fashion has been presented to us that
we were driven to open this shop," he says. "Some guys dress poorly
because they are intimidated by fashion. We want to cater to those
guys and present an aesthetic that is about comfort and style and
quality craftsmanship without being elitist about it."</TE>

<HD>The Bag Looks Gorgeous, but the Smell ...</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeannine Stein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dear Fashion Police: A couple of months ago I purchased a beautiful
Tod's bag. The bag is wonderful, but it has a heavy leathery smell
that is quite unpleasant. Is there a way to kill the odor with some
kind of treatment such as a polish or a perfume that won't ruin my
bag? I can't give up the bag!</LD>
<LD>   --IT'S IN THE BAG</LD>
<LD>   Dear It's: Relax, we understand. Good bags are hard to find. We
called Tod's in New York and the company suggests you send it back to
them so they can have a whiff and try to correct the problem. Send
the bag to Tod's, 41 E. 57th St., New York, NY 10022, attention
Customer Service. We suggest you include a letter stating what is
wrong with the bag along with a copy of your receipt, if you have it,
and where and when you purchased it.</LD>
<TE>   For others of you who have a similar problem, we got some tips
from Roger Smith, owner of Brownie's, a leather and suede cleaner in
Huntington Beach. Strong odors from a new handbag may be due, he
said, to materials used in the tanning process that can accentuate an
otherwise tolerable leather smell.</TE>
<TE>   He suggests putting the bag in a well-ventilated area out of
direct sunlight until the odor dissipates. You can also crumple up
some white tissue paper or blank newsprint and put it inside the bag;
that may also help get rid of the smell.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to mask it with deodorizing sprays or perfumes might not
only damage the purse, he added, but also exacerbate the odor
problem.</TE>
<TE>   Dear Fashion Police: I have a problem finding suitable workout
wear. Surely I'm not the only 60-plus (OK, I'm 63) woman who wants to
go to the studio or gym and be able to make a stop or two on the way
without feeling foolish. Though I'm in decent shape, I don't want to
expose my midriff and upper arms. Doesn't someone make a good
stretchy bottom, tights or pants, and a top with some coverage and
maybe a jacket to match? Both summer and winter weights are needed at
moderate prices.</TE>
<TE>   --GYM BOUND</TE>
<TE>   Dear Gym: Trust us, you're not alone in trying to cover up some of
your least favorite body parts. Wanting to hide a less than flat
stomach, a pair of substantial love handles or big old booty isn't
limited to age or gender, for that matter.</TE>
<TE>   Luckily for you, appropriate workout wear is at your fingertips.
The trend in gyms these days is to dress way, way down. Leggings,
sweats, capris and shorts in basic shades of black, navy, olive, red
and gray are most often worn with unadorned T-shirts and tank tops
(maybe a small logo at most). Shiny, ultra-skimpy and matching
outfits are out, out, out.</TE>
<TE>   The most important thing to keep in mind when looking for workout
wear is choosing pieces that are right for the type of exercise you
do.</TE>
<TE>   If you're in aerobics classes most of the time, you'll need
stretchy pieces that lend some support, since you're moving around a
great deal. Choose the bottom you find most comfortable--leggings,
capris or shorts. Some hug the leg, others are more loose-fitting.
Add a good, firm sports bra and a T-shirt that covers as much as you
want it to. Make sure the T-shirt isn't too oversized, though, since
it can restrict your movements when the extra fabric catches on your
body as you move.</TE>
<TE>   If you're strictly a low-impact gal, hanging out on the elliptical
trainer, walking on the treadmill or doing weight work, select a pant
or short that you find comfy. Your sports bra should offer some
support, but you may not need an industrial-strength model--you make
the call on this one.</TE>
<TE>   Again, opt for a T-shirt that's roomy, as long as you're not
swimming in it.</TE>
<TE>   The fabric you choose will depend on how much you sweat and if you
have allergies or are sensitive to specific fibers. Many people find
some blend of cotton and Lycra best; others prefer synthetics such as
micro-fiber, which wicks moisture away from the body--helpful if you
perspire a lot when you exercise.</TE>
<TE>   As for cover-ups, there are any number of sweat pants and jackets
out there in everything from cotton to nylon. For cooler months we
suggest a heavyweight cotton or fleece, and for warmer months
lightweight cotton, micro-fiber or nylon. We strongly suggest
changing out of your workout clothes before you exit the gym. Not
only will you look more presentable, but it's really unpleasant to
walk around in wet, sweaty clothes.</TE>
<TE>   We're happy to provide some online resources for workout wear, but
we also recommend shopping at your local sporting goods or athletic
wear stores as well. At these kinds of stores we've found leggings
and sweats for under $25 and T-shirts for under $15. Remember that
designer labels and well-known athletic brands can mean higher
prices.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Only eight hours had passed of the three days Kaci was supposed to be
dog-sitting. Already Nya the puppy had been missing and found, there
were little puddles of mud where the flower garden had been, the
puppy and her bag of food were covered in mud, and Kaci had dog
prints all over her school uniform.</LD>
<LD>   Kaci was able to find just a few clean dog food nuggets. She put
them into Nya's clean bowl, put fresh water in her water bowl and
then locked the gate behind herself.</LD>
<LD>   Kaci went home, changed clothes and broke open her piggy bank,
which she had been filling with change for two whole years. Kaci
jumped on her bicycle and took the $18.37 she had collected to the
grocery store. The dog-sitter bought a 10-pound bag of dog food, to
replace the one that had gotten wet, and four potted flowers. She
went back to Mrs. Collins', cleaned up the puppy, planted three
plants and straightened out the backyard. Then she went home to give
her mother the last plant because of the heap of muddy clothes she
had left in the bathroom.</LD>
<TE>   During the next two days, Kaci got up early to feed Nya. When she
got home from school she spent the afternoons playing fetch with the
Labrador puppy. Kaci found that Nya really enjoyed playing Frisbee,
and Nya found that Kaci didn't mind being slurped on when she wasn't
in her school clothes.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday morning, Kaci was standing in the back when Mrs.
Collins drove into her driveway. However, just as Kaci swung open the
gate, a cat ran by. Nya bounded down the sidewalk after it. (Perfect
timing, Kaci thought as she ran to retrieve the dog.)</TE>
<TE>   (I hope she ate breakfast, because it'll be a while before they
get back, thought Mrs. Collins, smiling.)</TE>

gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Kennedy Townsend incorrectly
reported that President Reagan pardoned a former Maryland governor,
Marvin Mandel, who was convicted of fraud. In fact, Reagan commuted
Mandel's prison sentence after he had served 19 months of a
three-year term. The U.S. Supreme Court years later let stand a lower
court decision overturning the conviction.</LD>

<HD>Bank of the West to Finalize Deal</HD>
<DH>Financial services: The firm will take over United
California Bank branches Monday, completing a $2.4-billion buy--its
biggest yet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Francisco's Bank of the West, which spent the last decade on an
acquisition spree, will finalize its biggest deal yet--the
$2.4-billion takeover of United California Bank--on Monday, when its
name will go up on 70 former UCB branches in Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   In acquiring UCB, Bank of the West also adds about 45 branches in
Northern California and the Central Valley, its established markets,
where it emphasizes lending to small businesses and farms.</LD>
<LD>   Adding the branches in Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, Ventura,
San Bernardino and Santa Barbara counties will help Bank of the West
position itself as a statewide alternative to giants such as Wells
Fargo &amp; Co., Bank of America Corp. and Washington Mutual Inc. Like
many smaller banks, it pitches its ability to provide more
personalized service than its much bigger rivals.</LD>
<TE>   "Our model is to put service back in the branches," said Bank of
the West's chief executive, Don J. McGrath. "You can call and talk to
a human being. We think people are opting out of impersonal models."</TE>
<TE>   Still, with $25 billion in assets, earnings that nearly doubled to
$137 million the first half of this year and a deep-pocketed French
parent, Bank of the West is a sizable institution. And its growth
shows that banking consolidation is continuing on a smaller scale
after the tumultuous deals of the 1990s, which erased familiar names
such as Security Pacific Bank and First Interstate Bank in Los
Angeles and saw out-of-state institutions take over San Francisco
stalwarts Wells and Bank of America.</TE>
<TE>   Bank of the West's roots go back to 1874, when it was Farmers
National Gold Bank. It remained a small Northern California player
until it began expanding in the early '90s with financial backing
from France's largest bank, BNP Paribas.  After a complex series of
deals, Bank of the West now is part of Honolulu-based BancWest Corp.,
itself a subsidiary of BNP Paribas.</TE>
<TE>   The deal also underscores how Japan's troubled banks have pulled
back from their own once-aggressive expansion into California. UCB
was formed last year in the merger of Sanwa Bank California and Tokai
Bank of California before it was sold by its Japanese parent, UFJ
Holdings, for the $2.4 billion in cash.</TE>
<TE>   McGrath said the bank is ahead of schedule in realizing its goal
of wringing nearly $75 million a year in cost savings from the
merger. The combined work force of Bank of the West and UCB, which
equaled 6,300 full-time employees, will be reduced by about 600
positions, including cutbacks at a Monterey Park data processing
center. After a hiring freeze and reassignments, fewer than 200
people will lose their jobs, McGrath said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Power-One Inc., a maker of parts that convert electrical currents for
telecommunications equipment, said it plans to eliminate 24% of its
work force, or 636 jobs, and close facilities in Mexico and Puerto
Rico.</LD>
<LD>   The company's shares fell 17%, or 72 cents, to $3.43 on Nasdaq.</LD>
<LD>   Camarillo-based Power One said it still expects to meet analysts'
forecasts for a loss of 7 cents a share in the third quarter, with
sales of $56 million to $59 million. It cited reduced demand for its
equipment used for the Internet and by telecommunications companies
for the cuts.</LD>
<TE>   Power-One expects third-quarter pretax costs of about $15 million
for job cuts and plant consolidations and asset-impairment costs of
$45 million. It also expects pretax costs of about $70 million for
obsolete inventory and about $68 million to write down goodwill.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Northrop Grumman Corp. said it reached an agreement to sell two
electronics businesses to L-3 Communications Holdings Inc. because
they are no longer part of its long-term strategy. Terms were not
disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   The units, which make computers and displays used by the military
and parts for microwave devices, are based in San Diego and San
Carlos, Calif., and employ about 900 people. Their annual sales total
about $140 million.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles-based Northrop acquired the businesses with its
purchase of Litton Industries last year. Northrop is selling some
assets as it prepares to complete its $11.8-billion takeover of rival
defense contractor TRW Inc.</LD>
<TE>   Northrop shares rose 97 cents to $126.80 and New York-based L-3
fell 11 cents to $55.70, both on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>MGM Mirage, Tribe Sign Casino Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Las Vegas Strip resort operator MGM Mirage has signed an agreement
with the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians to help the
California tribe develop a casino in downtown Palm Springs.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement marks the casino giant's first move into Indian
gambling, though the company is pursuing other arrangements with
tribes nationwide.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike deals other major casino operators have struck with tribes,
MGM Mirage won't manage the casino but will serve as a consultant.</LD>
<TE>   MGM Mirage Chief Executive Terry Lanni said the tribe sought help
only in the design and development of the casino.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it would receive a modest consulting fee based on
the project's construction cost, which has yet to be determined.</TE>
<TE>   The tribe owns the upscale Spa Resort Casino on nine acres in
downtown Palm Springs and the Agua Caliente Casino, a locals' casino,
off Interstate 10 near Rancho Mirage. It expects to build a casino
across the street from the existing Spa Resort Casino and demolish a
hotel to make room.</TE>

<HD>FCC Reviewing Rules Governing Media Ownership</HD>
<DH>Regulations: Agency may consolidate or relax restrictions
on issues such as a firm operating a newspaper and TV station in one
market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Federal Communications Commission on Thursday kicked off a
comprehensive review of the government's long-standing
media-ownership rules, with a majority of commissioners signaling
that they support relaxing or consolidating at least some of the
decades-old restrictions.</LD>
<LD>   Among other things, the current rules prohibit one company from
owning TV stations and newspapers in the same market, prevent TV
station owners from reaching more than 35% of the national audience
and limit the ownership of local radio stations.</LD>
<LD>   The step by the FCC on Thursday was largely a formality. It
followed the commission's announcement in June that it would
consolidate reviews of various media-ownership rules to create a
single set of guidelines, expected to be completed next spring.</LD>
<TE>   But the decision is likely to intensify lobbying by media
giants--including Tribune Co., parent of the Los Angeles Times;
Viacom Inc., operator of the CBS and UPN television networks; and
News Corp., Fox network's owner--which say the rules are outdated.
Meanwhile, consumer groups fear that a relaxation of the rules would
trigger another wave of media consolidation and reduce the diversity
of viewpoints and programming.</TE>
<TE>   The media-ownership rules have had a string of legal defeats over
the last two years in a federal appellate court that has ordered the
FCC to either justify the need for the restrictions or abandon them.</TE>
<TE>   The commission said it will examine whether the rise of new
technologies, such as cable, satellite TV and the Internet, has
reduced the need for ownership restrictions on broadcasters.</TE>
<TE>   "It's ambitious, but--I submit--long overdue," said FCC Chairman
Michael K. Powell.</TE>
<TE>   The FCC decided Thursday to scrap at least one of its media rules:
a ban on a company owning a cable TV system in the same market where
it also owns broadcast stations. The rule was overturned in February
by the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "It's finished," said W. Kenneth Ferree, head of the FCC's media
bureau. "The court vacated it and we did not propose breathing new
life into it."</TE>
<TE>   However, cross-ownership of cable systems and TV stations in the
same market may still run afoul of the final rules, Powell cautioned.
Rather than create separate regulations for broadcast, cable and
newspaper industries, the commission is moving toward one standard
that would apply to all media.</TE>
<TE>   Powell, who has long advocated overhauling the rules, received
support Thursday from fellow Republicans on the commission.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Kathleen Q. Abernathy said the commission needs to
reconcile its patchwork of rules, which she called frustrating and
difficult to understand.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Kevin J. Martin expressed disappointment that the
agency was not moving more quickly to revise the newspaper-broadcast
rule, particularly in larger media markets, where many agree the rule
is no longer needed.</TE>
<TE>   But Commissioner Michael J. Copps, a Democrat, warned against
moving too quickly and suggested that he may not vote on the
media-ownership review unless the commission holds public hearings to
gather more input.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know of any issue before the commission that is more
fraught with serious consequences for the American people than the
media-ownership rules," Copps said.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of this month, the FCC is expected to release about 10
studies it has commissioned to examine how consumers use different
media, how cross-ownership and consolidation affects the diversity of
news and programming on TV and how consolidation affects radio
programming and advertising rates in local markets.</TE>
<TE>   The studies are expected to serve as the foundation for the
commission's final ownership rules as well as a defense in any court
challenges to the rules.</TE>
<TE>   Separately on Thursday, the FCC requested public comment on
whether it should reverse its position and let mobile phone companies
off the hook for the $15.9 billion they pledged in a controversial
auction of wireless airwaves held by NextWave Telecom Inc., which had
filed for bankruptcy protection. The FCC repossessed NextWave's
licenses and auctioned them to Verizon Wireless Inc., VoiceStream
Wireless Corp. and other carriers in January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   That sale was later invalidated by the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Washington, which ruled that the government could not repossess the
licenses without violating the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The FCC has
appealed the decision to the Supreme Court. A court decision is
expected next month.</TE>
<TE>   The commission also voted Thursday to consider establishing, in
cooperation with the Federal Trade Commission, a way for consumers to
remove their names from telemarketing lists.</TE>

<HD>Winnick Subpoenaed by House Panels</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Questions will focus on Global Crossing's actions
before the sale of stock by top executives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr. and ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Widening their probe of potential wrongdoing in the
telecommunications industry, two House panels said Thursday that they
subpoenaed Global Crossing Ltd. Chairman Gary Winnick to question him
about transactions that boosted the fiber-optic company's revenue
shortly before he and other executives sold more than $100 million
worth of stock.</LD>
<LD>   The House Energy and Commerce Committee and its Oversight and
Investigations subcommittee also subpoenaed former Global Crossing
general counsel Jim Gorton and former Qwest Communications
International Inc. executive Greg Casey. The panels want the three to
testify about allegations that both firms participated in so-called
capacity swaps in the spring of 2001 that had the effect of propping
up each company's revenue.</LD>
<LD>   That, in turn, would have helped to keep the stock prices of the
two companies from falling further and, investigators believe,
allowed seven executives and board members to sell some of their
shares. Winnick, for example, sold shares for $123.5 million in May
2001.</LD>
<TE>   The subpoenas are a sign that investigators are intensifying their
probe of Global Crossing, the once-highflying telecommunications
carrier that filed for bankruptcy protection in January, and Qwest, a
debt-laden regional Bell company that provides local phone service to
24 million customers in 14 states.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the panels had sought only financial documents from
Qwest as part of their investigation of Global Crossing but found
evidence of possible wrongdoing at both companies.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick, Casey and Gorton were ordered to appear at a Sept. 24
hearing. Committee investigators also have secured interviews
scheduled for next week with former Qwest Chief Executive Joseph
Nacchio and former Chief Financial Officer Robin Szeliga about the
company's dealings.</TE>
<TE>   "We are concerned that these capacity swaps are merely sham
transactions meant to artificially increase revenue and mislead
investors," said Rep. James C. Greenwood (R-Pa.), chairman of the
investigations subcommittee.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest spokesman Will Myers said no executives from his company
have been subpoenaed by the committees. But he said Qwest is hopeful
of being cleared and is "continuing to cooperate with investigators."
Committee investigators have interviewed 18 current and former
employees at Global Crossing, and a dozen from Qwest, said Ken
Johnson, a top commerce committee aide.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick could not be reached for comment. He is expected to take
the 5th Amendment at his appearance before the committee.</TE>
<TE>   His attorney, Gary Naftalis, said Thursday that Winnick has done
"nothing improper."</TE>
<TE>   "He ... continues to cooperate with this and other inquiries by
making available all relevant documents," Naftalis said. "All records
and reports demonstrate that Gary acted, at all times, legally,
ethically and honorably."</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, the committee--frustrated with what it said was a
lack of cooperation from Winnick--threatened to subpoena the
executive because he was resisting being interviewed.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the committee released copies of correspondence that
appeared to cast doubt on the legitimacy of Qwest accounting,
especially in its reporting of swaps.</TE>
<TE>   In one e-mail, an unnamed Qwest manager told a Qwest executive
that he would blow the whistle on the company over what he said were
questionable accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   "I have some information about violations that Qwest has committed
in this area of accounting," wrote the manager, whose name was not
disclosed because committee investigators are seeking his cooperation
in their probe.</TE>
<TE>   Both Qwest and Global Crossing are being investigated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the Justice Department and House
Financial Services Committee for dealings arising out of their
exchange of telecommunications transmission capacity that may have
masked both companies' deteriorating conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Such swaps, known as an "indefeasible rights of use," or IRUs, are
similar to real-estate leases and are used to secure upfront money in
exchange for offering deeply discounted, long-term contracts for
transmission capacity on telecommunications networks.</TE>
<TE>   The committees previously have focused on a number of
transactions, including a March 30, 2001, swap in which Global
Crossing sold 360Networks Inc. $150 million in fiber-optic capacity
and, in turn, agreed to buy capacity from 360Networks. Global
insisted on closing the deal quickly so that it could show $150
million in revenue before the end of the fiscal quarter March 31.</TE>

<HD>Greenspan Warns on Deficits</HD>
<DH>Testimony: Fed chief says U.S. economy has withstood recent
blows well but faces a new threat in the looming federal budget gap.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Thursday that the U.S.
economy has borne up surprisingly well under the blows of terror
attacks, a stock crash and a sharp retreat in business investment but
faces a new threat in looming federal deficits that could raise
interest rates.</LD>
<LD>   "Returning to a fiscal climate of continuous large deficits would
risk returning to an era of high interest rates, low levels of
investment and slower growth of productivity," Greenspan told the
House Budget Committee.</LD>
<LD>   Greenspan said Congress should extend federal spending controls
that are widely credited with having helped produce four straight
years of budget surpluses but are set to expire at the end of this
month.</LD>
<TE>   He sidestepped the politically charged question of whether the
need for renewed fiscal restraint required undoing portions of
President Bush's 10-year, $1.6-trillion tax cut, which Congress
approved last year. He also declined to speculate on the economic
cost of a protracted war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan's nearly exclusive focus on the budget in congressional
testimony Thursday surprised some listeners, who had expected him to
offer some account of the economy's condition and a hint about
whether the Fed planned further interest rate cuts any time soon.</TE>
<TE>   But the central bank chairman only tipped his hat to the subject,
saying, "The economy appears to have withstood [recent] blows well,
although the depressing effects still linger."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said Greenspan's minimal comments suggested that Fed
policymakers were unlikely to change the central bank's
signal-sending federal funds rate at their Sept. 24 meeting. The rate
is already at a 40-year low of 1.75%.</TE>
<TE>   "They're unlikely to act soon," said Peter E. Kretzmer, an
economist with Banc of America Securities in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Stock prices tumbled and bond prices rose after Greenspan's
testimony, as well as President Bush's United Nations speech on Iraq
and news that initial jobless claims have risen to a near-five-month
high of 426,000.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 201.76 points, or 2.4%,
to close at 8,379.41, while the broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index
dropped 22.54, or 2.5%, to 886.91 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite
index skidded 35.77, or 2.7%, to 1,279.68. The price of a bellwether
10-year U.S. Treasury note climbed, sending its market interest rate
to 3.96%, a 39-year low.</TE>
<TE>   On its face, Greenspan's call for maintaining formal budget
controls seemed unsurprising.</TE>
<TE>   The Congressional Budget Office predicted last month that
Washington would run a $157-billion deficit this fiscal year--the
first since 1997--and a nearly half- trillion-dollar deficit in this
and the next three years. With only two weeks left in the current
fiscal year, Congress' effort to agree on a spending plan for the
coming 12 months is in tatters.</TE>
<TE>   But Greenspan's comments provoked some ire among Democrats and
independent analysts, who noted that the Fed chairman previously
endorsed the idea of using tax cuts to reduce the surplus. The
endorsement helped pave the way for congressional approval of Bush's
tax cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan also sparked criticism by repeating arguments made in a
speech last month in Jackson Hole, Wyo., that the Fed was largely
powerless to stop or pop the stock bubble of the late 1990s.</TE>

<HD>It's Attack of the 10-Story-High Clones</HD>
<DH>Movies: Imax will show a remastered 'Star Wars: Episode
II.' The film's original digital format helps in enlargement.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Coming to a gigantic screen near you: Imax Corp. and Lucasfilm Ltd.
entered into a joint agreement to digitally remaster and re-release
"Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones."</LD>
<LD>   It's the first time Imax has used its proprietary technology on a
film shot using digital cameras--a distinction that helped retain the
look and feel of the original movie, even when it's been blown up to
fit the huge screen.</LD>
<LD>   "With 'Episode II,' we were working with all the data of the
original print," said Brian Bonnick, senior vice president of
technology for Imax. "It helped that we weren't working with an image
that had already degraded."</LD>
<TE>   The film, distributed by 20th Century Fox, will hit Imax theaters
in North America on Nov. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, Imax dealt almost exclusively in science or nature
movies specifically shot for the company on film much larger than the
35-millimeter standard. But in an effort to expand its appeal, Imax
has pushed to convert popular feature films to its larger format.</TE>
<TE>   It's a conversion process that typically costs about $3 million,
but that sum could be significantly reduced with newer technology,
Imax executives said.</TE>
<TE>   Imax had worked with Walt Disney Co. to convert "Fantasia 2000"
and "Beauty and the Beast" to its proprietary format, which offers
images on screens up to 10 stories tall.</TE>
<TE>   And the Oscar-winning "Apollo 13" will be re-released on the
really big screen this month. The 1995 hit is the first 35-mm
live-action film to be digitally remastered into the Imax format.</TE>

<HD>E-Mails Suggest Conflicts at CSFB</HD>
<DH>Securities: The messages indicate analysts issued good
ratings to appease corporate clients.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Regulators' probes of potential conflicts of interest among brokerage
analysts have turned up new evidence suggesting that analysts touted
some stocks solely to please their firms' investment bankers.</LD>
<LD>   Several internal e-mails from Credit Suisse First Boston show
analysts at the firm complaining about or mocking the influence
bankers had on their stock recommendations.</LD>
<LD>   In one e-mail two years ago, technology analyst Kevin A. McCarthy
charged that the firm's investment bankers "acted as a proxy for
management" of Lantronix Inc. in the Irvine tech company's August
2000 initial public offering, and led him to put his reputation on
the line "to sell this piece of crap."</LD>
<TE>   The e-mails, obtained by the Times from a source close to the
investigation, echo Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. internal messages disclosed
in spring by New York State Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer as part of his
office's probe of the firm.</TE>
<TE>   Several Merrill analysts were quoted privately disaparaging
Internet stocks they were publicly touting to investors in 1999 and
2000.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill agreed to pay $100 million to settle charges of tainted
stock advice. Since then, state regulators and the Securities and
Exchange Commission have launched new investigations into analyst
conduct across Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   "What we found has been very troubling," said William Galvin,
Massachusetts secretary of state and the state's securities
regulator. His office is leading the investigation of Credit Suisse,
a unit of Credit Suisse Group.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clearly unethical and it may go beyond that to illegal if
there's a quid pro quo involved [in analysts' recommendations], and
that remains to be seen," Galvin said. "Investors have to be sure
that it's good-faith advice they receive but that may not be the case
if [analysts] acted in bad faith to advance corporate profits."</TE>
<TE>   In a May 2001 e-mail, CSFB software analyst Erach Desai complained
that he has had to adapt to demands of the company's investment
bankers, who garner big fees from companies for handling their
financing needs. Desai said that "unwritten rules" to keep corporate
clients appeased "have clearly hindered my ability to be an effective
analyst."</TE>
<TE>   In a March 2001 e-mail, CSFB software analyst George Gilbert said
a colleague, referring to IPOs he touted, told European investors
that "most of his IPOs never should have gone public." Gilbert also
wrote: "Clients didn't find his comment amusing, especially when he
said we all got our bonuses for a good year."</TE>
<TE>   The e-mails may further erode confidence in Wall Street research,
said Southern Methodist University law professor Alan Bromberg.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's any investor confidence left, this new information
will almost certainly demolish it," Bromberg said.</TE>
<TE>   More than 30 states have joined a nationwide task force digging
into alleged conflicts of interest among analysts.</TE>
<TE>   The task force started work from material obtained by
investigators for Spitzer. His revelations about Merrill Lynch
triggered a firestorm in Congress and on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   CSFB spokeswoman Victoria Harmon would not comment about the
e-mails beyond a statement: "Early on, we welcomed, fully endorsed
and have been implementing the Spitzer initiative to make systemic
changes to strengthen analyst independence. We are now working
closely with the regulators and government officials on these
matters."</TE>
<TE>   The first e-mail arose from the poor showing of Lantronix stock on
its opening day in August 2000. Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, which
Credit Suisse was about to acquire, handled the offering.</TE>
<TE>   But the IPO didn't go well. The size of the deal was cut in half,
and the stock, priced at $10 a share, lost $2 in its first day. On
Aug. 30, 2000, McCarthy rated the shares a "buy" and issued a
12-month forecast of $17 a share. The price struggled to reach $10.75
in early September 2000, then quickly fell to the $5-to-$6 range.</TE>
<TE>   The stock was hammered earlier this year after the company
revealed that it had inflated revenue by more than $6 million. The
stock closed Thursday at 58 cents, down 12 cents, on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   After Credit Suisse completed its purchase of DLJ in November
2000, McCarthy was asked about the deal and his recommendation.</TE>
<TE>   In an e-mail to his boss, Elliott Rogers, McCarthy said he agreed
to look at Lantronix because DLJ didn't have a networking analyst.</TE>
<TE>   "Once I was in, the [DLJ] bankers [in the Los Angeles office]
acted as a proxy for management and we had to fight to get straight
answers from these guys on every single line item," McCarthy wrote.
"I put my reputation on the line to sell this piece of crap, calling
favors from very important clients.</TE>
<TE>   "The deal was an embarrassment to me and the firm, and I wasted a
lot of bullets to get it done," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers is no longer at Credit Suisse and could not be located for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   McCarthy, whose voicemail says he is traveling, didn't return
messages seeking comment. Lantronix executives were unavailable for
comment.</TE>

<HD>Short Shorts May Be Longshot</HD>
<DH>Ocean Pacific bets on its '70s cord hit and increases
production</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE EARNEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A local surf wear company is about to find out just how far guys will
go to indulge their passion for vintage retro-wear.</LD>
<LD>   Ocean Pacific Apparel Corp., the Irvine company that caught fire
30 years ago with its corduroy shorts for young men, is increasing
production and distribution of the shorts for a new generation.</LD>
<LD>   Even company executives concede it's a longshot. At a time when
shorts have grown longer and baggier, the 1970s-style Op shorts are
short and snug.</LD>
<TE>   "The essence of cool in the surf industry has been the length of
the shorts," Ocean Pacific Chief Executive Dick Baker said. "The
antichrist of that has been the Op cord short."</TE>
<TE>   Although Op has kept the shorts in production--selling, for
example, at Robinsons-May department stores and at least one gun
store in Orange County--many of the hipper retailers weren't
interested. Now, however, Op says the shorts will be shipping to more
core surf shops--such as Jack's Surfboards and Huntington Surf &amp;
Sport in Huntington Beach--the hip Urban Outfitters chain and trendy
specialty stores, such as Fred Segal and Ron Herman.</TE>
<TE>   At an industry trade show in San Diego last week, Baker showed off
a pair in the classic powder blue color with a 4-inch inseam.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so geeky, it's so short, that only a hip 14-or 15-year-old
could bring it back," Baker said.</TE>
<TE>   That won't be Christian Rodriguez, a 14-year-old Corona del Mar
resident who was shopping Wednesday at Becker Surf &amp; Sport near his
home.</TE>
<TE>   "My uncle wears shorts like that," Rodriguez said, and he's "like
52."</TE>
<TE>   Op, a surf wear pioneer that along with Hang Ten helped propel the
laid-back Southern California look nationwide three decades ago, is
just one of many companies trying to catch the retro wave.</TE>
<TE>   Soft bohemian-style clothing for women came roaring back last
year, as did hip-huggers. Now, trendy youth apparel companies are
offering up cowboy shirts with scalloped yokes and pearl snap buttons
and attempting to pass off velour warmup suits as a hot new fashion
statement.</TE>
<TE>   In the spring, Op launched its Op Classics line, which uses
patterns and prints from the 1970s. Hang Ten last month introduced a
vintage line of its own, including a replica of its signature striped
shirt with two tiny feet on the chest.</TE>
<TE>   "Our vintage pieces were selling in resale stores for $50 apiece,"
said Milissa Sweet, vice president of marketing for the brand, now
owned by International Licensing Corp. in Poway, Calif. "We thought,
it's time we brought this back."</TE>
<TE>   The shirts, which surfers once paired with Op shorts, will come in
the traditional "ugly, funky colors," such as rusty brown and powder
blue, Sweet said. "People want to go back to that moment, that time,
and those colors will have to stay true to that," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, young men undoubtedly will find it less of a fashion risk
to wear a weird-colored T-shirt than snug, short shorts. Op
executives acknowledge that it will take a gutsy person to wear their
retro cords.</TE>
<TE>   Or at least somebody with good-looking legs, said Trent Armstrong,
manager of Becker Surf &amp; Sport, where the shorts are supposed to
arrive any day.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't wear them," Armstrong said. "I'm too scared."</TE>
<TE>   But Randy Brewer is more enthusiastic. The general manager of
Villains youth apparel store in San Francisco calls the shorts
"awesome" and says he expects to sell every pair his store has
ordered.</TE>
<TE>   "I guarantee you we'll sell them through, 100%," Brewer said.
"Anybody over 30 had a pair and will remember them.... I'll buy a
pair. I won't wear them out of my house, but I have to get them."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, when it comes to fashion trends, "anything is possible,"
said Marshal Cohen, co-president of NPD FashionWorld, a unit of
market research firm NPD Group.</TE>
<TE>   "Marketing to the younger generation is all about extremism and
individuality," he said. "If everyone is used to seeing long and
baggy, there are those kids out there who say, 'I've got to go the
other way. I've got to go short and tight.' That's how trends
emerge."</TE>
<TE>   Die-hard fans of Op's retro-cords haven't been deterred by the
fact that fashionable shorts now have a 10- inch inseam. They just
kept buying the abbreviated cords over the last couple of decades at
the rate of about 100,000 a year, company executives say.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of those things that, try as you may to kill the
item, it just wouldn't die," said Andrew Lelchuk, a senior vice
president at Op.</TE>
<TE>   To introduce the shorts to more prospective buyers, Op will make
20% more of them this year and is planning to double production next
year, spokesman Alain Mazer said. The shorts are made by Rays Apparel
in Costa Mesa, licensee for Op's young men's and juniors lines.</TE>
<TE>   Val Surf in North Hollywood, one store that kept carrying the
shorts, typically sells them to middle-aged men, buyer Marisa Leonard
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The person who buys them buys five pair," she said. "They buy
every color we have." Lately, Leonard said, young women have started
trying on the shorts, slinging them low on the hip.</TE>
<TE>   In one sign that the shorts might be developing a wider appeal,
Mazer said 40 pair recently shipped inadvertently to a surf shop that
had ordered a longer version of the cord. But before Op could
retrieve the shorts from South Coast Surf Shop in San Diego County,
customers started buying them, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They called back and said, 'Whoa, whoa, we sold 20 pair of the
things,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, Mazer said, they might have been hoarded by "a guy
wearing a tool belt with hair growing out of his ears," but Op
prefers to imagine that bold young visionaries were snapping them up.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, Op now must wrestle with another pesky problem.</TE>
<TE>   Originally, the back pocket was on the left side of the cord,
because founder Jim Jenks was left-handed. But because most people
are right-handed, Op shifted the pocket to the right side, annoying
purists.</TE>
<TE>   "We get six calls a month about the pocket," said Nat Norfleet,
Op's design director.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys are 55 years old, and they're totally upset."</TE>

<HD>PacBell Seeks More Freedom on 411 Fees</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SBC Pacific Bell wants the freedom to make 411 service more
expensive.</LD>
<LD>   The company has asked the state Public Utilities Commission to
remove most price controls on directory assistance, arguing that
increased competition reduces the need for regulation. Under that
proposal, the PUC could still set a maximum charge per call, but it
would be unable to regulate any changes PacBell made below that
level.</LD>
<LD>   Consumer advocates criticized the proposal, saying callers have no
reliable alternative for directory information. They also contend
that directory assistance is a vital part of basic phone service, and
they worry that PacBell might stop providing residential customers
with three free 411 calls a month.</LD>
<TE>   The company, a unit of San Antonio-based SBC Communications Corp.,
asked the PUC in 1998 to raise the directory assistance price to 50
cents from 25 cents and eliminate customers' allotment of five free
calls a month.</TE>
<TE>   Despite tens of thousands of protest letters and e-mails from
customers, the PUC granted much of the request, raising the maximum
rate to 46 cents a call and trimming the number of free calls to
three.</TE>
<TE>   Under PacBell's current proposal, the maximum would stay at 46
cents a call. But by moving to a new, less regulated approach, it
would be easier for PacBell to make changes in the future.</TE>
<TE>   PacBell is the state's largest provider of local phone service,
and its customers are automatically routed to PacBell's directory
service when they dial 411. Their main alternative is their
long-distance carriers' directory services, which can be reached by
dialing 00 or 555-1212 in a different area code.</TE>
<TE>   Other competitors, PacBell spokesman John Britton said, are the
free Internet sites that look up phone numbers. He said PacBell's
share of the local directory assistance business is 44%, but consumer
advocates described that figure as unrealistically low.</TE>
<TE>   PacBell has not asked to increase the price of 411 calls or to
reduce the number of free calls per month, Britton said, but it
definitely wants the pricing flexibility its competitors have,
including the ability to offer package deals without PUC approval.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom Inc. subsidiary MCI, Britton noted, charges some
customers 99 cents for directory information but others pay $2.49.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd like to be able to do the same thing," he said, adding: "Any
pricing would have to be in line with the competitive market. We
charge $10 a call for directory assistance [and] we wouldn't have any
customers."</TE>
<TE>   Regina Costa, telecommunications director of the Utility Reform
Network in San Francisco, said the long-distance companies and Web
sites are unreliable because their numbers aren't updated often
enough. That's a problem, she said, for callers who need help finding
numbers for new businesses or people who have moved.</TE>
<TE>   Natalie Billingsley, a regulatory analyst for the PUC's Office of
Ratepayer Advocates, said the proposed change would let PacBell raise
411 fees without the commission's review or approval and with no
consumer protests allowed.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes me very jittery to think of any aspect of basic, basic
phone service being moved to a definition that does not allow
commission pricing oversight," she said.</TE>
<TE>   No decision is expected until next year at the earliest.</TE>

<HD>Canadian Firm Seeks 2.3% Stake in Gap</HD>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gap Inc. said TRC Capital Corp. of Canada had begun an unsolicited
"mini-tender" offer to buy as many as 20 million Gap shares, a stake
of about 2.3% in the nation's largest specialty apparel retailer.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco-based Gap said it does not recommend or endorse
TRC's offer.</LD>
<LD>   The offering price is $12 a share, a 5% discount to Gap's New York
Stock Exchange closing price of $12.60 Tuesday, the day before TRC
began its offer. Shares of Gap on Thursday closed off 45 cents at
$12.14, before the company's announcement.</LD>
<TE>   Tender offers avoid many disclosure and procedural requirements of
federal regulators by seeking less than 5% of a company's stock.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Securities and Exchange Commission's Web site,
mini-tenders "have been increasingly used to catch investors off
guard." Many investors "may end up selling their securities at
below-market prices," the SEC said.</TE>

<HD>Andersen's Obstruction-of-Justice Conviction Is Upheld</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Arthur Andersen's obstruction-of-justice conviction over its
mishandling of Enron Corp's financial records was upheld by a federal
judge.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon in Houston denied the
accounting firm's motion to dismiss the case or grant a new trial.
Andersen was accused of shredding documents to keep them from
investigators, and jurors said after the trial that they based their
decision on an altered internal memo.</LD>
<LD>   The accounting firm's conviction prevented it from conducting
audits, and on Aug. 31 the company ceased auditing. It already had
lost hundreds of clients since Enron's Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing after
the energy trader's restatement of earnings to account for unreported
losses of $586 million during the previous 4 1/2 years.</LD>
<TE>   "The fact that six jurors spoke eagerly to the press concerning
their views of the evidence" does not "present evidence of extraneous
influence of the type of extraordinary prejudice that would allow the
court to open to scrutiny the deliberation process," Harmon wrote in
a decision signed Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Dorton, spokesman for Andersen, said the accounting firm
plans to appeal.</TE>

<HD>America Online CEO Shuffles Executives</HD>
<DH>Media: Jonathan Miller unveils a plan designed to
streamline authority. Key problems are not addressed, analysts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A month after taking over as chairman and chief executive of AOL Time
Warner's troubled America Online subsidiary, Jonathan Miller seized
the reins more firmly Thursday, shuffling executives and unveiling a
"streamlined management structure" with all key departments reporting
directly to him.</LD>
<LD>   The move eliminates the positions of president and chief operating
officer and, more significant, disbands AOL's business affairs
department, the nearly autonomous unit that put together advertising
deals that are now the subject of a federal accounting probe. David
Colburn, the head of that unit and the architect of many of the ad
deals, left the company last month.</LD>
<LD>   "We wanted to flatten the organization and build it for speed,"
Miller said in an interview Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts said the restructuring might accomplish its stated goals
of increasing accountability and operating efficiency but did not
address America Online's fundamental problems with plunging Internet
advertising and slowing subscriber growth for its popular dial-up
service.</TE>
<TE>   "They really did not outline any evidence of how they are going to
reinvigorate the business," said Frederick W. Moran, an analyst with
Jefferies &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Under the management overhaul, AOL President Ray Oglethorpe, 58,
will retire, and Chief Operating Officer J. Michael Kelly will become
chairman and chief executive of AOL International.</TE>
<TE>   Both are AOL veterans brought aboard by Chairman Steve Case and
then-Chief Executive Robert W. Pittman well before the 2001 merger
with Time Warner. Another AOL veteran, Jan Brandt, will resign as
vice chairwoman and chief marketing officer and become a part-time
senior advisor.</TE>
<TE>   Elevated to become America Online's vice chairman is Joseph Ripp,
currently executive vice president and chief financial officer. The
company said it was launching a search for a new CFO.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, AOL Time Warner cut its estimates for online ad sales
and profit at America Online for the second time in two months. It
was a setback for AOL Time Warner Chief Executive Richard D. Parsons,
who assumed the top job in May vowing not to over-promise results.</TE>
<TE>   Even Monday's revision may not be enough, said Moran, the
Jefferies analyst. He said plunging cash flow at the AOL unit is
almost certain to keep the parent company from hitting its key
full-year target of 5% growth in EBITDA, or earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission
are investigating AOL Time Warner's accounting. The probes are
thought to focus on whether the America Online unit improperly
boosted revenue through unconventional advertising transactions.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner disclosed last month that its own investigation
had turned up three transactions by America Online involving $49
million that may have been improperly booked as advertising and
commerce revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of AOL Time Warner fell 75 cents to $12.50 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Data on Economy Raise Concerns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA WILLARD</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Reports Thursday emphasized troubling trends in two areas of the U.S.
economy that worry most economists--trade and employment.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. deficit in the current account--the broadest measure of
trade with foreign countries because it includes
investment--mushroomed 15.6% in the second quarter to a record
$129.96 billion, while initial claims for jobless benefits last week
climbed by 19,000 to 426,000, the highest level in more than four
months.</LD>
<LD>   Despite worries raised by such agencies as the International
Monetary Fund, U.S. officials have shrugged off the importance of the
wider-than-expected current account gap, saying it signaled
confidence in the U.S. economy.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't see any adverse impact of those data. So it's not a
worry or a surprise," U.S. Treasury Undersecretary of International
Affairs John Taylor said. "The main thing is that it's being financed
in an orderly way. The returns are still there and probably will
still be increasing as the recovery gets going."</TE>
<TE>   But it is unclear how strong the recovery will be. The economy
expanded at an anemic annual rate of 1.1% in the second quarter and
economic reports for the current quarter have been mixed.</TE>
<TE>   The Labor Department report showed that prices for imports were
pushed up because of the cost of imported petroleum. Import prices
rose by 0.3% in August, after gaining 0.4% in July, in line with
expectations. Excluding volatile petroleum, import prices edged up
0.1%.</TE>
<TE>   Labor's data on unemployment claims provided further evidence that
the current hesitant recovery is one fueled by productivity and not
by growth in jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "Economic growth is ... still more productivity-driven and as a
result it doesn't create any jobs," said Diane Swonk, an economist at
Bank One. "We're not going to be seeing a lot of jobs for a while
yet."</TE>

<HD>IRS to Focus on Evasion Schemes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CURT ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Internal Revenue Service on Thursday announced plans to focus
more attention on high-income individuals and those involved in tax
avoidance schemes.</LD>
<LD>   The intent is to uncover those who avoid taxes and hide income,
instead of just checking returns for mistakes or simple omissions.</LD>
<LD>   IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti said the aim is to free up
auditors to focus on such areas as tax shelters, offshore credit
cards used to hide income and wealthy people who fail to file
returns.</LD>
<TE>   "The real world is such that we have limited resources," Rossotti
said. "We are trying to figure out as best we can where is the most
threat to the system."</TE>
<TE>   The IRS estimates the nation's "tax gap," the difference between
income taxes that should be paid and what is collected, at $207
billion annually.</TE>
<TE>   A significant portion of that lost revenue is because of tax
evaders, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the unpaid tax bill comes from income that is never
reported to the IRS.</TE>
<TE>   To get at this problem, the IRS has developed a statistical method
of selecting returns with a high probability of unreported income.</TE>
<TE>   Among the tax avoidance schemes to be targeted for audits are
nonexistent slavery reparations, abusive tax shelters and false
payroll tax returns.</TE>
<TE>   Rossotti said 60% of income taxes are paid by those earning
$100,000 or more.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS has been working to increase the number of returns it
audits, which rose slightly to 732,000 last year--about one in every
173--but is far below the 1.9 million audited in 1996.</TE>

<LD>Stocks slumped Thursday as investor sentiment crumbled under the

<LD>   Thrown into the fray were dour brokerage calls on the key

Dow member McDonald's and Sun Microsystems, a major Nasdaq issue.</LD>
<LD>   "There is nothing for investors to sink their teeth into.... Every
rally in God knows how long has failed and that is discouraging,"
said Uri Landesman, portfolio manager at Arlington Capital
Management. "We won't rally until a few companies start telling us
things are improving and orders are getting better. We're not getting
that."</LD>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average lost 201.76 points, or 2.4%, to
8,379.41. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index slid 22.54 points, or 2.5%,
to 886.91. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index fell 35.77
points, or 2.7%, to 1,279.68.</TE>
<TE>   Losers led winners by 2 to 1 on both Nasdaq and the New York Stock
Exchange. Trading, while up from the levels of Wednesday's
abbreviated session, remained light.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street was rocked by a sharp increase in the nation's current
account deficit, which showed the economy sucked in imports at a
record pace in the second quarter. Also, the number of Americans
signing up for state unemployment benefits last week rose
unexpectedly to the highest level in more than four months.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks dropped at the start of trading in reaction to that double
dose of bad news, which heightened concerns over the outlook for the
economy. The mood was further darkened when President Bush told the
U.N. General Assembly that "action will be unavoidable" against Iraq
unless the United Nations takes a hard line forcing Baghdad to
disarm. And in remarks before Congress, Greenspan said the economy is
holding up but warned that a return to spending discipline was vital
for economic health.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are a potential buyer of stock and you have two world
leaders talking about issues that could stall economic growth, you
are going to be a lot more cautious," said Gary Wedbush, head of
trading at regional investment bank Wedbush Morgan.</TE>
<TE>   The day's sharp losses dampened hopes among some investors that
Wall Street might stage a rally once the first anniversary of the
Sept. 11 terror attacks had passed.</TE>
<TE>   Yields on Treasury securities swooned to the bond-friendly beat of
weak stocks, soft jobs data and geopolitical concerns. The yield on
the benchmark 10-year Treasury note slid to 3.96% from Wednesday's
close of 4.06%.</TE>
<TE>   Oil prices fell 92 cents, or 3.1%, to $28.85 a barrel in New York
trading, spurred by the interpretation of Bush's speech that military
action against Iraq won't come immediately. "The immediacy is being
taken out of the war footing," said John Kilduff, senior vice
president with Fimat USA, referring to the recent spike in oil prices
tied to expectations of military action against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar tracked stocks lower, losing ground against the euro
and the Japanese yen.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights Thursday:</TE>
<TE>   * Financial stocks were the biggest decliners among S&amp;P 500
sectors. Citigroup lost 99 cents to $29.15. Insurer American
International Group shed $1.85 to $59.19.</TE>
<TE>   * Defense stocks rose after Bush's speech. Lockheed Martin added
73 cents to $65.98. Raytheon, which makes the Tomahawk missile, rose
27 cents to $35.67. "The speech just served to further the strength
in defense stocks," said Rich Weiss, chief investment officer for
City National Bank in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop Grumman rose 97 cents to $126.80. The world's largest
military shipbuilder agreed to sell two electronics businesses
because the units no longer were part of its long-term strategy.</TE>
<TE>   * Investors sought out gold shares as a haven after the spot price
of gold rose $2.30 to $318.90 an ounce. Newmont Mining added 71 cents
to $29.60, while Goldcorp rose 23 cents to $11.53.</TE>
<TE>   * Chip-related shares declined after Europe's Royal Philips
Electronics reduced its forecast for semiconductor sales this quarter
and a Lehman Bros. analyst cut his earnings estimates for
semiconductor equipment makers including Applied Materials and
Novellus Systems. The SOX index of semiconductor stocks tumbled 6.1%,
its biggest decline since July 25. Intel, the biggest chip maker,
dropped 92 cents to $15.70. Applied Materials slid 95 cents to
$12.74. Novellus lost $1.30 to $23.64.</TE>
<TE>   * McDonald's fell $1.03 to $20.31 after Salomon Smith Barney cut
its price target and third-quarter earnings estimate for the
fast-food chain.</TE>
<TE>   Sun Micro, down 15 cents at $3.22, fell to lows last seen in late
1996 after Salomon Smith Barney said profit will be difficult in the

<HD>Last-Minute Suitors Vie for Assets of Napster</HD>
<DH>Internet: Creditors are expected to ask for a delay in
company's planned liquidation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN and P.J. HUFFSTUTTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Several last-minute bidders have said they are willing to pay
millions for the assets of Napster Inc., surprising expressions of
interest that may well rescue the company from liquidation.</LD>
<LD>   At a hearing today, a committee of creditors is expected to ask a
Wilmington, Del., bankruptcy judge to put off the planned liquidation
and appoint a trustee or interim chief executive during another
auction.</LD>
<LD>   "The company is making substantial progress, and in view of that,
we're hopeful the court will give the parties more time," said Carey
Ramos, an attorney for songwriters and music publishers.</LD>
<TE>   A Napster representative declined to comment. The dormant
song-swapping firm's CEO laid off all but two or three employees and
resigned last week after the judge blocked an asset sale to German
media conglomerate Bertelsmann.</TE>
<TE>   The Napster creditors have been asking potential bidders to offer
at least $6 million for the technology, brand name and Internet
address of what was once one of the most popular services on the
Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "I have seen one written bid, and I am told we can expect two or
three more," said Rick Antonoff, who represents the creditors.</TE>
<TE>   The identities of the most serious new suitors couldn't be learned
Thursday. Antonoff and another person briefed on the situation said
the highest bid was for more than $9 million.</TE>
<TE>   "They are getting serious expressions of interest," the second
person said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. trustee had sought liquidation after the company's
employees dispersed. Since then, the creditors and Napster's lawyers
have been trying without success to get Napster shareholders to agree
on a board of directors and interim leader.</TE>
<TE>   Antonoff said that without that agreement, he may ask the U.S.
trustee to allow Napster to stay out of Chapter 7 liquidation as long
as an independent trustee is appointed as overseer.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, Private Media Group Inc., a publicly traded adult
entertainment company based in Spain, sent a bid to the shuttered
song-swapping business and offered to buy just the Napster trademark
and Internet address for about $2.4 million in stock.</TE>
<TE>   Executives with Barcelona-based Private Media said they want the
Napster trademark and Web address to draw traffic to a peer-to-peer
subscription network they are building to allow consumers to trade
adult content.</TE>
<TE>   Once valued by venture capital investors at more than $100
million, Napster filed for bankruptcy reorganization in June after
judges ordered it shut during a copyright infringement suit by
songwriters and major record labels.</TE>
<TE>   Those groups later attacked the planned sale to Bertelsmann, and
the judge agreed that the terms of that deal might not have been
fair.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Burger King Corp. said it is launching a 99-cent menu in a move that
promises to fan the flames of a hamburger price war among the
nation's biggest fast-food chains.</LD>
<LD>   The new menu is a permanent part of the chain's offerings and not
a promotion, Miami-based Burger King said. The launch comes less than
one week after McDonald's Corp. said it would roll out a dollar menu
nationwide starting in November.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ford Motor Co. said it would start accounting for stock options as an
expense in January to reflect the cost of paying executives and other
employees.</LD>
<LD>   Ford said that the expense last year would have been about $150
million, or 8 cents a share. The change will not represent "a
significant cost," according to a company statement.</LD>
<LD>   The auto maker also announced it would let buyers of 2002 cars and
trucks delay payments until January, stepping up incentive
competition as auto makers try to clear out dealer lots for 2003
models. The offer runs through Sept. 30 and is for all models.</LD>

<HD>Goodyear Suit Alleges Age Discrimination</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A group of Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. employees sued the company,
saying its employee evaluation system discriminates against older
workers.</LD>
<LD>   A Goodyear spokesman said the company does not discriminate, but
that it is revising the evaluation system to address workers'
concerns.</LD>
<LD>   Retiree-advocacy group AARP and lawyers representing eight
Goodyear workers filed the lawsuit in Ohio state court.</LD>
<TE>   The suit contends that the Akron, Ohio-based firm's evaluation
system discriminated against older workers by giving a
disproportionate number of them low grades, depriving them of raises
or causing them to be fired.</TE>
<TE>   Goodyear's evaluation effort is similar to a forced ranking system
at Ford Motor Co. that provoked a lawsuit last year by about 500
workers. It was settled for $10.6 million and Ford has since
abandoned grades.</TE>

<HD>3 Indicted in Britain Over Enron Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal prosecutors in Houston indicted three British bankers on wire
fraud charges in connection with an Enron Corp. deal considered a
critical piece of the case being built against former Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow.</LD>
<LD>   Gary Mulgrew, David Bermingham and Giles Darby were accused of
stealing $7.3 million from a deal with Enron in an indictment that
mirrors charges filed against them on June 27. But the formal
indictment allows prosecutors to begin extradition proceedings to
bring the men to the U.S. to face trial.</LD>
<LD>   Fastow has been implicated in several fraudulent transactions by
former lieutenant Michael Kopper, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to
engage in money laundering and wire fraud charges, and agreed to
cooperate with prosecutors.</LD>
<TE>   Kopper implicated Fastow in three fraudulent deals involving Enron
off-balance sheet partnerships, including the Southampton Place deal
in which the bankers were alleged to have stolen the $7.3 million.
Fastow, through his representatives, has consistently declined to
comment.</TE>

<LD>   The U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Boeing's argument
that it is not liable for the payment. It is in addition to $40
million that the aircraft manufacturer paid in August 2000 to the
federal government and Brett Roby, a former whistle-blower who filed
a lawsuit claiming Boeing's transmission gears were faulty and led to
the copter's crash.</LD>
<LD>   The court ruled 2-1 that the government can recover money for
damages from the 1991 crash in Saudi Arabia of a CH-47D Chinook
helicopter. All 18 men aboard the helicopter survived.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Phoenix judge threw out criminal indictments against three former
officials of the Baptist Foundation of Arizona, saying the grand jury
that indicted them had been shown prejudicial evidence.</LD>
<LD>   The criminal indictments stem from charges in connection with the
1999 bankruptcy filing of the foundation, which cost thousands of
investors as much as $570 million. In May, accounting firm Arthur
Andersen agreed to pay $217 million to settle a series of suits
related to its audits of the foundation.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>SBC Communications Inc. received an offer of about $1 billion for its
Sterling Commerce software unit, which SBC bought 2 1/2 years ago for
almost four times as much, according to people familiar with the
matter. The bid from buyout firms Silver Lake Partners and Texas
Pacific Group faces competition from another offer from Francisco
Partners of Menlo Park, Calif., the people said.</LD>
<LD>   A sale of the electronic commerce software unit would allow SBC to
reduce its reliance on short-term debt as it struggles with falling
profit. The proceeds also may help finance a bid by SBC's Cingular
Wireless joint venture for VoiceStream Wireless Corp., analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   Spokesmen for SBC, Silver Lake Partners, Texas Pacific and
Francisco Partners declined to comment.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Yahoo Inc. and SBC Communications Inc. today will unveil a high-speed
Internet service designed to convince more people that broadband is
worth the extra money.</LD>
<LD>   The Internet and phone companies have been working on the service
since they joined forces last year. The new service, available in all
13 states where SBC provides phone service, would allow subscribers
to surf the Web at speeds up to 25 times as fast as dial-up modems.</LD>
<LD>   The new service's content of exclusive entertainment features and
other applications is supposed to be another selling point.</LD>
<TE>   A promotional subscription rate of $29.95 to $39.95 per month,
depending on the speed of service, will be offered. The regular rate
will be $42.95 to $59.95 per month.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft Corp.'s MSN service and regional phone carrier Qwest
Communications International Inc. last year rolled out a high-speed
Internet service that hasn't made a significant dent in the market,
an industry analyst said.</TE>

<HD>FCC to Consider Telemarketing 'Do-Not-Call' Rules</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Federal Communications Commission on Thursday said it would
reassess its rules for telemarketers, bolstering an effort to help
consumers avoid telephone sales calls at home.</LD>
<LD>   FCC officials said growing consumer frustration had prompted the
agency to consider whether it should throw its weight behind a
proposed "do-not-call" list, which would enable consumers to prevent
telemarketers from calling them.</LD>
<LD>   The do-not-call list, currently being developed by the Federal
Trade Commission, would probably take effect next year.</LD>
<TE>   FCC support would mean that banks and telecommunications
companies, two of the biggest telemarketers, would be required to
comply along with other businesses.</TE>
<TE>   The FCC said it would seek public input for 60 days before
determining whether to go ahead, but several commissioners said they
were inclined to support the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "Unrestricted telemarketing has gone beyond being a nuisance and
has become in many instances an invasion of privacy," Commissioner
Michael Copps said.</TE>
<TE>   Current regulations, drafted by the FCC in 1992, prohibit
telemarketers from calling before 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m. and require
them to honor consumer requests not to be called back.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the industry has thrived thanks to new technologies
such as automatic dialers, which allow sales representatives to reach
many more customers. Telemarketers place 104 million calls each day
and take in $278 billion annually, according to FCC and industry
sources.</TE>
<TE>   Several states have created do-not-call lists, and the FTC is
expected to complete its work on a national list by the end of the
year.</TE>
<TE>   Under the FTC plan, consumers would call an automated toll-free
number to get on the list.</TE>
<TE>   Telemarketers would be required to check the list monthly and pay
up to $3,000 to cover operating costs.</TE>
<TE>   Companies that did not comply would face fines of up to $11,000
per count. Political, religious and nonprofit calls would be exempt.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Seeks Details on Univision Merger</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Justice Department is scrutinizing Univision Communications
Inc.'s planned $2.1-billion acquisition of Hispanic Broadcasting
Corp., raising questions over whether the deal will be quickly
approved by regulators.</LD>
<LD>   Univision, the Los Angeles-based Spanish-language broadcasting
giant, and Hispanic Broadcasting of Dallas issued a joint statement
late Thursday saying the Justice Department has requested additional
information from the two companies. The inquiry, which is not
uncommon in merger deals, was made under the requirements of the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.</LD>
<LD>   "The companies intend to work with the [Justice Department] and
respond promptly to the request for additional information," the
statement said, adding that the companies still expect the
transaction to close by the end of the year.</LD>
<TE>   In June, when Univision announced the deal, Univision said they
didn't expect any regulatory opposition. However, Univision has a 31%
stake in Santa Monica-based Entravision Communications Corp., which
owns Spanish-language radio and TV stations.</TE>
<TE>   Hispanic Broadcasting owns 55 radio stations, including five in
Los Angeles. On the day the Univision-Hispanic Broadcasting deal was
announced, Spanish Broadcasting System Inc. sued Hispanic
Broadcasting and Clear Channel Communications Inc., accusing the two
companies of antitrust behavior. Clear Channel has a 26% stake in
Hispanic Broadcasting.</TE>
<TE>   Univision stock closed Thursday at $22.40, down $1.61 on the New
York Stock Exchange. Hispanic Broadcasting shares fell $1.37 to
$18.53, also on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi Chief Hints He's in No Rush to Sell Universal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CORIE BROWN and RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>In his first visit to the company's New York offices, Vivendi
Universal Chief Executive Jean-Rene Fourtou signaled to his top
managers Thursday that the troubled French media giant would remain
an international company.</LD>
<LD>   In meetings with top executives at Vivendi's U.S. headquarters and
at Universal Music Group, Fourtou stressed the importance of having a
multinational executive team.</LD>
<LD>   Although Fourtou did not give specifics on his vision for Vivendi,
his message still surprised the New York staff, which had been
expecting Fourtou to return the company to its roots as a French
water utility and quickly sell off Universal Studios and other
entertainment businesses amassed by former Vivendi CEO Jean-Marie
Messier.</LD>
<TE>   The apparent change in approach reflects the difficulties Fourtou
faces in unraveling the entertainment assets stitched together by
Messier. Bleak market conditions, which have depressed media stocks,
could hamper any efforts to sell those assets quickly, investment
bankers say.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is this is still a very open story.... They're still
trying to work out what Vivendi's going to look like when it's done,"
said Michael Nathanson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou is meeting with his American executives before a pivotal
Sept. 25 board meeting in Paris, where Vivendi directors are expected
to decide on a strategy for the firm. Since Fourtou replaced Messier
in July, he has been working frantically to stave off a cash crisis
by securing bank loans and preparing to sell assets, including
publishing and pay-TV operations.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Vivendi's U.S. executives are weighing a plan to
eventually sell or spin off entertainment assets into a separate
company that still would be managed by Vivendi Universal
Entertainment Chairman Barry Diller. Several parties have expressed
interest, including cable-TV mogul John Malone, Viacom Inc. and
General Electric Co.'s NBC, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou also met Wednesday with Diller, according to sources.</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou had breakfast Thursday with Vivendi board member Edgar
Bronfman Sr. before meeting with Vivendi staff and then visiting with
Universal Music Chairman Doug Morris and touring the Island Def Jam
studio.</TE>
<TE>   Today Fourtou is scheduled to visit Universal Studios in Universal
City and meet with studio President Ron Meyer and Universal Pictures
Chairman Stacey Snider.</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou, Diller and Meyer also are having lunch with DreamWorks
SKG partners David Geffen and Steven Spielberg. Universal has a
long-standing distribution relationship with DreamWorks. Geffen has
said DreamWorks has no interest in buying Vivendi's U.S.
entertainment businesses.</TE>

<HD>Last Audit Panelist Quits Wade Cook Financial</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The sole remaining member of Wade Cook Financial Corp.'s audit
committee quit this week, complaining that he couldn't obtain
information about the stock seminar company's finances.</LD>
<LD>   Board member Everett Sparks, who joined the cash-strapped
company's board five months ago, said in an interview that he was
disturbed by Wade Cook Financial's financing of homes and cars for
favored employees when it was behind on employee paychecks and other
obligations. The company's other three audit committee members quit
in June.</LD>
<LD>   The Seattle company, founded by Wade Cook in 1989, runs seminars
and publishes books on how investors can make money trading stocks.
Its own stock portfolio lost 89% in 2000 and 60% last year, according
to the company's Web site.</LD>
<TE>   "What I couldn't understand is, if he's so good at trading, why do
they have these money problems?" said Sparks, a petroleum industry
executive from Arlington, Texas. "It just doesn't add up."</TE>
<TE>   Troy Romero, an attorney for the company, said committee members
had full access to the company's financial information.</TE>
<TE>   In a government filing, the company traced many of its problems to
earthquake damage at its headquarters in February 2001, the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, the stock market's decline and news reports of
Federal Trade Commission actions against the company.</TE>
<TE>   Janice Leysath, a former chairwoman of the audit committee, said
in her letter of resignation that the company spent money on "bogus
trips, jobs, fees and mortgage payments" for friends and relatives of
CEO Cook. The company denied the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   The FTC in February filed a motion in federal court to hold Wade
Cook Financial in contempt, saying it violated an October 2000
settlement with the agency. The agreement required Cook to refund
millions of dollars to customers who falsely were told the firm's
seminars would teach them how to make 20% or more a month on their
investments.</TE>
<TE>   The FTC also alleged Wade Cook Financial continued making
misrepresentations to customers after the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   The company's stock rose 10 cents to 40 cents Thursday on the
over-the-counter Bulletin Board.</TE>

<HD>Trial Begins for Man in Fatal Beating of Ex-Girlfriend's
Son</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Pacoima man accused of beating a 4-year-old boy to death wept
quietly Thursday in a Van Nuys courtroom as his former girlfriend
testified about trying to revive her dying son.</LD>
<LD>   Jose Cruz, 25, is accused of striking Richard Mendez hundreds of
times with his hands, belts and two gold-tasseled curtain cords on
May 24, 2001, causing the fatal injuries.</LD>
<LD>   The boy's mother, Yvonne Guangorena, 21, testified that Cruz, who
was caring for Richard, left her a message at work, saying he had hit
the boy because the child had soiled his pants.</LD>
<TE>   When she called back, Guangorena said, she asked Cruz about her
son's condition.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me it looked like somebody had jumped" the boy, she
testified.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz struck the boy on his buttocks, thighs and legs and bit him
at least twice, Deputy Dist. Atty. Andrea Thompson told jurors in her
opening statement.</TE>
<TE>   No one sought medical help for the boy until it was too late,
Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   Richard died hours after the beating in his mother's North
Hollywood apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz is charged with assault on a child causing death, murder and
torture. He faces the possibility of life in prison if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   His attorney, Geoffrey Crowther, said Cruz admitted beating the
boy but had not intended to kill Richard. Crowther said he would ask
the jury of seven men and five women to find Cruz guilty of the
lesser charge of manslaughter.</TE>
<TE>   With immediate medical treatment, none of Richard's injuries would
have been fatal, Crowther said. He said the family had delayed
seeking help for fear the boy would be taken from his home by county
child welfare workers.</TE>
<TE>   Guangorena testified that she and Cruz had dated for about two
years and had lived together for nine months, although he had moved
out a few weeks before the beating.</TE>
<TE>   Her son called Cruz "Daddy," she said.</TE>
<TE>   On the day Richard died, Guangorena said, she and Cruz took him to
a doctor's appointment, then to visit the school where he was due to
begin pre-kindergarten a week later. The three had breakfast at
Denny's, then Cruz drove Guangorena to work in Burbank about 11 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   As Cruz drove back to Guangorena's apartment, Richard soiled his
pants and Cruz hit him twice in the head, Thompson said in her
opening statement.</TE>
<TE>   Later, at the apartment, Thompson said, the boy was subjected to a
beating that lasted between 30 minutes and an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Guangorena testified that, after she got Cruz's message about 1:30
p.m., she called him to protest his striking her son. She said Cruz
arrived about 2 p.m. with Richard to pick her up from work.</TE>
<TE>   Seeing a gash near the boy's right eye, she said, she asked Cruz
to drive to a hospital, but he refused.</TE>
<TE>   "Jose said [Richard] was OK, just tired," the mother testified.</TE>
<TE>   When they arrived home, Guangorena said she bathed the boy and
noticed extensive bruising on his buttocks and legs.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson asked about her reaction to the injuries. She paused for
a moment, wiping away tears, and said she then asked Cruz why he had
beaten Richard.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he was sorry for hurting him that way," she testified.</TE>
<TE>   Guangorena said she and Cruz had argued for about 40 minutes as
Richard lay on a living-room sofa. She said she then noticed her son
was having trouble breathing and called 911.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz called his own mother, Guangorena said, and left the
apartment before paramedics arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Fire Department Capt. Glenn Ames testified Thursday
that the boy was dead when he and paramedics got to the apartment
about 3:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   He said he notified police because of the severe bruising on the
boy's body.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Police Det. Mike Coffey told jurors that when he
entered the apartment, the severity of the dead boy's injuries was
immediately apparent.</TE>
<TE>   "The bruises were from head to toe on that child," he said.</TE>

<HD>BLM, Wildlife Agency at Odds Over Off-Roading at Dunes</HD>
<DH>Policy: Bureau pushes for more recreational acreage despite
its sister agency's concerns about an endangered plant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Bureau of Land Management, already under fire for attempting
to open much of the 150,000-acre Algodones sand dune system to
off-road vehicles, has rejected the warnings of a sister agency about
the future of a rare plant there.</LD>
<LD>   Moreover, the bureau is seeking to deflect concerns for the
plant's survival by urging biologists at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service to consider contradictory research--some of it paid for by
the off-road industry group lobbying to open the dunes in the
southeastern corner of California.</LD>
<LD>   At issue is the Bush administration's proposal to overturn a
Clinton-era legal settlement banning off-road vehicles on about
50,000 acres of the Algodones Dunes, also known as the Imperial Sand
Dunes Recreation Area.</LD>
<TE>   The plan has been contentious from the start, pitting
conservationists against outdoor enthusiasts, who believe more public
land should be open to motorized recreation.</TE>
<TE>   The dunes, which stretch nearly 40 miles from the Chocolate
Mountains to the Mexican border, are enormously popular with
off-roaders who zoom up and down their peaks with dune buggies and
other customized vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   But environmental advocates say the dunes are also a unique
ecosystem--one that could be destroyed by increased vehicle usage.
Many of those claims focus on the milk vetch, a plant that, though
perhaps a little homely, is a threatened species subject to federal
protection.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration wants to reopen about 16,000 more acres of
the dunes to unlimited off-road vehicle use and an additional 33,000
acres with limits on the number of vehicles allowed each day. Roughly
70,000 acres are open today.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the northern end of the dunes, known as the North
Algodones Dunes Wilderness Area--north of California 78 and protected
through an act of Congress more than 15 years ago--would not be
affected by the proposal and would remain off-limits.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration hopes to finalize its decision in coming
weeks, officials said Thursday. Before it can proceed, however, the
Fish and Wildlife Service, the agency often responsible for the
scientific decisions made under the Endangered Species Act, must sign
off on the plan.</TE>
<TE>   According to documents, Fish and Wildlife officials in Sacramento
are considering issuing what is known as a "jeopardy
opinion"--asserting that opening more of the dunes could mean the end
of the milk vetch.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Mike Pool, California director of the Bureau of Land
Management, asked the Fish and Wildlife Service not to issue the
jeopardy opinion.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter, Pool said his agency now questions the science that
resulted in the milk vetch's threatened status in the first place--a
stance long embraced by off-road vehicle groups looking to open more
dunes.</TE>
<TE>   Other studies, Pool wrote, indicate that the milk vetch would
survive the Bush administration's proposal. That conclusion, Pool
wrote, is based in part on three studies conducted by an Arizona
environmental consultant and paid for by the American Sand Assn., an
Arizona-based industry group that is leading the effort to open more
of the dunes.</TE>
<TE>   Pool also suggested that the Fish and Wildlife Service look at
surveys of the plant conducted by the BLM over the last four years.</TE>
<TE>   A jeopardy opinion, Pool wrote, would throw off the
administration's timetable.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not believe a jeopardy opinion is warranted," Pool wrote.
"If the opinion of the [Fish and Wildlife] Service is jeopardy, the
... schedule will slip considerably."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Pool nor his counterpart at the Fish and Wildlife Service,
Steve Thompson, could be reached for comment Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   But other officials of the two agencies insisted there is no rift
between the two agencies and denied that the BLM is trying to bully
its sister agency to avoid the jeopardy opinion.</TE>
<TE>   According to Miel Corbett, Fish and Wildlife's endangered species
program manager in Sacramento, the Endangered Species Act
specifically suggests that the federal government weigh studies paid
for by industry and commercial groups when making conservation
decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "Good scientific information is good scientific information," she
said. "Everyone says, 'Well, some of these groups are going to
provide biased information or stretch the truth.' But it's science."</TE>
<TE>   What's more, Corbett said, that doesn't mean the Fish and Wildlife
Service will take the American Sand Assn.'s studies as gospel.</TE>
<TE>   "It's relatively easy to follow the logic path of some of the
science that was done to see if you agree with the conclusion," she
said. "We really just want the best thing for the species. BLM is
taking an active role in this, and they deserve some credit."</TE>
<TE>   BLM spokesman John Dearing denied that the Bush administration has
pressured its Sacramento office to push the off-road vehicle proposal
through.</TE>
<TE>   "Is there undue pressure? No," he said. "If anything, we're
probably putting pressure on ourselves. The [off-road vehicle] season
is coming upon us--soon. We want to get this done before that
occurs."</TE>
<TE>   Karen Schambach, California director of Public Employees for
Environmental Responsibility, nevertheless argued that Pool's letter
is an attempt to upset the traditional roles of the
agencies--particularly the historic reliance on the Fish and Wildlife
Service to provide the science behind the Endangered Species Act.</TE>
<TE>   The public employees group is a conservation-oriented association
of county, state and federal officials that often provides legal
representation for government officials who get in trouble for taking
pro-environmental stands.</TE>
<TE>   "The Fish and Wildlife Service is the one that is supposed to be
making these sorts of determinations," Schambach said.</TE>
<TE>   Pool's "justification for leaning on them--that they have this
schedule--that is just ludicrous," she added. "If their proposal
might put a species in jeopardy, then the schedule be damned."</TE>
<TE>   Several environmental organizations have responded to Pool's
letter with letters of their own asking the Fish and Wildlife Service
to proceed independently of the BLM.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute marks the latest in a series of allegations that the
Bush administration puts commercial interests and recreational uses
ahead of conservation in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Just last week, a coalition of environmental organizations
petitioned the administration to provide more protection for wildlife
in its new management plan for the Sonoran Desert. Among their
complaints: that the management plan rejects the federal government's
own blueprint for saving the endangered desert tortoise.</TE>
<TE>   "BLM has just shown an incredible bias toward the users over
conservation in the last six months," Schambach said.</TE>
<TE>   "I expect it's a reflection of pressure coming from Washington and
the new administration. As bad as it's been in the past, I've never
seen it this bad."</TE>
<TE>   Greg Gorman, the American Sand Assn. spokesman in Phoenix, said
his group paid Arthur M. Phillips III, a botanical and environmental
consultant, to conduct three studies of the milk vetch population
because little reliable information was available.</TE>
<TE>   The studies were conducted over the last 18 months, Gorman said,
and proved that "There's a ton of 'em."</TE>
<TE>   "He told us, 'If [the studies show] it's endangered, that's what
I'm going to say,' " Gorman said. "We said, 'We don't care. We need
to have some science on the thing. We need to have some data one way
or another.' We said, 'Do your best and we'll live with what you come
up with.' "</TE>
<TE>   Gorman said the studies were expensive but that he did not have a
precise figure.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips, reached at his office in Flagstaff, Ariz., bristled at
any suggestion that his studies were flawed.</TE>
<TE>   "We were trying to be above board and open and untainted," he
said. "I am a scientist. I value my integrity and should not have to
defend it."</TE>

<HD>Speakers Plead to Save Hospitals</HD>
<DH>Hearing: Health workers urge county to keep public
facilities open to support trauma and emergency system.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dozens of hospital workers, patients and elected officials argued at
a hearing Thursday that Los Angeles County's emergency and trauma
system would collapse if two public hospitals are closed as proposed.</LD>
<LD>   Many of the speakers, appearing before the county's Emergency
Medical Services Commission, said the county needs to spend more
money on emergency care, rather than cut back. The commission, an
advisory body to the Board of Supervisors, is exploring the effects
of efforts to close a deficit that is projected to reach nearly $800
million within three years.</LD>
<LD>   "I find it unimaginable that, one day after Sept. 11, we're
arguing about closing another trauma center," said Dr. Mauricio
Heilbron Jr., a trauma surgeon at St. Mary Medical Center in Long
Beach. "I not only urge you not to close these, but let's consider
making more."</LD>
<TE>   Barring a federal bailout or another cash infusion, county
supervisors soon will consider reducing 211-bed Olive View-UCLA
Medical Center in Sylmar and 377-bed Harbor-UCLA Medical Center near
Torrance to outpatient clinics. Both now operate emergency rooms;
Harbor is one of the county's 13 trauma centers.</TE>
<TE>   The supervisors have already approved plans to close 11 community
health clinics and four school-based clinics by the end of this
month. The board also approved converting High Desert Hospital in the
Antelope Valley into an outpatient center next May.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors and hospital executives argued that, if the county further
cuts its medical services, the action would have a domino effect on
the hospitals that remain. Private hospitals don't have the capacity
to treat the influx of new patients, they said. Also, many of the
county's patients lack health insurance, and the private sector says
it cannot absorb that added cost.</TE>
<TE>   "The entire system here is on the brink," said Dr. Franklin D.
Pratt, medical director of the Los Angeles County Fire Department. He
compared the current emergency network to a "rubber band pulled as
tightly as it can be pulled before it breaks."</TE>
<TE>   Kerry Carmody, administrator of Providence Holy Cross Medical
Center in Mission Hills, said private hospitals, too, may be forced
to close their emergency rooms.</TE>
<TE>   "Ultimately, at the hospital level, you move beyond emotion and
you move beyond the passion for providing the services," he said. "It
will become a dollars and cents decision."</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena Fire Chief Ernest Mitchell said he knows firsthand the
ripple effect an emergency room closing can have. Earlier this year,
Tenet Healthcare Corp. shut St. Luke Medical Center, leaving
Huntington Memorial Hospital with the city's only emergency room.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the fire department has driven far more patients to
hospitals outside the city. To keep response times from spiking,
Mitchell said, he has been forced to add another ambulance that he is
hard pressed to pay for.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the pressure on the emergency system could be alleviated
by a tax proposal, if voters approve it in November.</TE>
<TE>   After the public testimony on Thursday, the Emergency Medical
Services Commission unanimously voted to support the $168-million
parcel tax, which also would be used to improve the county's
bioterrorism preparedness. Under the proposal, the county would levy
a tax on developed properties of 3 cents per square foot. Two-thirds
of voters must approve the increase for it to pass.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the EMS Commission urged county supervisors to give
the public six months' notice before scaling back or closing
hospitals. The commission also recommended that the supervisors wait
until after the November election before cutting any more hospital
services.</TE>
<TE>   "These issues are life and death," said John Edelston, the
commission's chairman.</TE>
<TE>   Several commission members and supervisors said residents must be
educated about how they would be affected if the emergency and trauma
system collapses.</TE>
<TE>   "If the emergency rooms start to shut down in this county ... the
ripple effect doesn't just affect the uninsured and the poor," said
Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky. "It affects everyone else who has
insurance."</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) criticized the county
saying it had failed to adequately restructure the health department
after receiving its first federal bailout in 1995 and a second
bailout two years ago. She said the county's attempt to secure a
third bailout, coupled with the tax increase on the November ballot,
comes a bit late.</TE>
<TE>   "We're now in a position of having to buy homeowners insurance
while our house is on fire," she said.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Woos Labor With Appointees</HD>
<DH>Politics: Living-wage advocate is headed to CRA. The mayor,
unions both oppose secession.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT and PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Living-wage advocate Madeline Janis-Aparicio is expected to be
confirmed today to the city's powerful Community Redevelopment
Agency--one of a series of labor-supported appointments that Mayor
James K. Hahn is making in an effort to reach out to union leaders
fighting efforts to break up the city.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn, who is asking the City Council to confirm Janis-Aparicio
today, appointed her at the urging of Miguel Contreras,
secretary-treasurer of the County Federation of Labor. Although
Contreras strongly supported Antonio Villaraigosa in his mayoral
campaign against Hahn last year, the mayor has reached out to
Contreras in recent months to bolster his campaign against secession
movements in the San Fernando Valley and in Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   In the coming weeks, Hahn is expected to make more pro-labor
nominations to city commissions. Among those up for consideration is
Tyrone Freeman, head of the service employees union, who is expected
to join the Fire Commission. Hahn also is supporting the appointment
of Sergio Rascon, with the hotel workers union, to the Convention and
Exhibition Center Authority.</LD>
<TE>   Hahn's courting of organized labor could have wide-ranging
implications for the city by strengthening workers' hand in
negotiations for affordable housing, wages and benefits. It also
could undercut Villaraigosa's union support if he decides to run
against Hahn in three years, as some believe he will.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a smart political move and an easy one," said veteran
political consultant Rick Taylor. "It's been a couple of years now,
and he's trying to build some coalitions."</TE>
<TE>   Contreras said that labor's relationship with the Hahn
administration has improved considerably and that one of the things
that brought the two sides together was their mutual opposition to
secession.</TE>
<TE>   "I think labor has an important voice at City Hall," Contreras
said. "You could argue that wasn't the case in the beginning" of the
Hahn administration.</TE>
<TE>   When Hahn approached Contreras last year about joining his
anti-secession campaign, Contreras had already decided to oppose
secession. But he told Hahn that he would like the alliance to result
in better relations, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We asked to work together more," Contreras said. "We both agree
that we both have to work for the best of the city."</TE>
<TE>   That has resulted in Hahn appointing more labor officials to city
commissions. Contreras said he recommended Janis-Aparicio when Hahn
asked him for the names of good potential appointees.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, Madeline is more than just about labor. She is a
community representative. Her direction is going to come from the
community," Contreras said.</TE>
<TE>   He said she was instrumental in negotiating for employees of
Staples Center and the Hollywood-Highland commercial complex. But
some business leaders and a councilwoman have expressed concern about
Janis-Aparicio's appointment because they fear she would stifle
development.</TE>
<TE>   "It's critical to me to attract developers so I can bring more
jobs into my district," said Councilwoman Jan Perry, who represents
downtown Los Angeles and parts of South Los Angeles. "I think people
deserve that. I have a lot of respect for Madeline. I think she is a
very intelligent, educated and empowered woman. But I am deeply,
deeply concerned."</TE>
<TE>   Janis-Aparicio first became active in civic issues after she
received her law degree from UCLA in the mid-1980s, filing suits on
behalf of renters in downtown L.A. slums. She ran a Central American
refugee center and then created the network behind the city's 1996
living-wage law.</TE>
<TE>   She now runs Los Alliance for a New Economy, a nonprofit group
created by organized labor to rally community support for organizing
drives.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said Thursday that he picked Janis-Aparicio after soliciting
recommendations from Contreras and other labor leaders. But, he said,
there was no quid pro quo for the unions' help in fighting secession.</TE>
<TE>   "Miguel recommended her, but I have known her for a while," Hahn
said. "It's certainly not part of any deal or anything. I would
expect him to recommend people to me from time to time, and I will
solicit those recommendations from him. We want to have a good
balance on commissions."</TE>
<TE>   Reacting to the critics, Hahn defended the nomination.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Madeline Janis-Aparicio is a tremendous addition to the
redevelopment agency," Hahn said. "What we are talking about is
trying to improve the quality of life in Los Angeles. There are
neighborhoods that need the help only the redevelopment agency with
its specialized legal status and tools can provide. That fits in
nicely with what she's been talking about, improving the quality of
life for individuals."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said he admires her advocacy for a living wage, which the CRA
board has previously refused to adopt.</TE>
<TE>   "If government is going to be providing assistance to companies
doing business with the city, then they ought to also provide dignity
to the people who work in those companies," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   San Fernando Valley secession leader Richard Close said he does
not believe the latest appointments are a coincidence. "There have
been rumors that Hahn cut a deal with the unions to get their support
to fight secession," Close said. "It seems that labor is getting more
involved in control of city government, and that is because Hahn is
pandering to them."</TE>
<TE>   Council President Alex Padilla disagreed that Janis-Aparicio's
appointment came in direct exchange for labor opposition to
secession, noting that labor came out early against the breakaway
efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "I think she is a good appointment. She brings a unique and
different perspective to redevelopment," Padilla said. "She is a very
strong and very effective voice for social justice."</TE>

<HD>Stakes High as Malibu Debates Land-Use Plan</HD>
<DH>Development: City must take over decisions from state
coastal panel. Set of sweeping rules draws fire.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pitting property rights against coastal protection, Malibu residents
bitterly debated a proposed plan Thursday that would govern
development in the exclusive 27-mile-long coastal community.</LD>
<LD>   Discussions before the state Coastal Commission continued late
into the night, as environmentalists said the rules would help
protect Malibu's semirural character and some homeowners complained
that even the most incremental home improvements would be unfairly
forbidden.</LD>
<LD>   The 14-member commission is expected to vote today, as its meeting
near Los Angeles International Airport continues, and the decision
could affect everything from home improvements to a massive
commercial project proposed for the Malibu Civic Center.</LD>
<TE>   Among the first of dozens to speak at Thursday's hearing was
singer Don Henley, who owns a home, farmland and open space in the
city. He urged the commission to approve the plan, saying it will
help preserve land that he has grown to love in his 27 years there.</TE>
<TE>   "I love Malibu, and I don't want to see it destroyed for the
personal profit of other people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Malibu resident Wade Major said the plan would leave quite a
different legacy, not unlike that of the Nazis: "the erosion of civil
liberties, the imperious edicts and the state-sponsored propaganda
that preached the value of subordinating individual wants to the
broader community values."</TE>
<TE>   Many other local residents said they were concerned that the plan
might stunt property values and stop their ability to make the
smallest improvements--from painting their homes to planting rose
bushes and other nonnative plants to remodeling--without first being
forced into costly biological studies.</TE>
<TE>   All coastal cities were long ago supposed to adopt such plans,
which seek to balance development and land use in sensitive
environments. But Malibu, along with a handful of other cities, never
got around to creating such a plan, leaving the matters in the hands
of the Coastal Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The statewide panel, charged with protecting the entire 1,100-mile
coast, often found itself locked in daylong sessions, bogged down in
the minutiae of deck expansions, bathroom remodels and garage
additions, often for some of the state's wealthiest residents.</TE>
<TE>   "For many years, the main business of the commission that takes up
the most time on their agenda has been local land-use decisions in
the city of Malibu," said Mary Nichols, Gov. Gray Davis' secretary of
resources. "It was a failure on the part of the city of Malibu to get
their act together."</TE>
<TE>   About two years ago, politicians in Sacramento got sick of being
relentlessly lobbied about local matters, most memorably over a sea
wall for entertainment mogul David Geffen. The Legislature passed a
bill requiring the Coastal Commission to take responsibility for
drafting the plan away from Malibu officials and to have the state
agency complete the task itself by Sept. 15, 2002--this Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Malibu city officials would then reassume responsibility for local
planning matters, but under the vastly stricter guidelines being
drawn by the state panel.</TE>
<TE>   Eight hours into Thursday's meeting, the stakes of the discussion
were clear as the commission was still listening to some of the 170
people who signed up to testify.</TE>
<TE>   "This Local Coastal Program is your legacy and your gift, to not
only Malibu residents but to all the state's residents and visitors,"
Mark Massara, coastal programs director with the Sierra Club, told
the coastal commissioners.</TE>
<TE>   But residents expressed a host of concerns, chief among them that
the plan designates nearly half of the city's 12,679 acres as
"environmentally sensitive habitat areas." These lands, mostly
covered in sage and chaparral, and 100-foot buffers around them,
would be protected from most new development. Some privately owned
parcels are wholly covered in these habitats, so to avoid
unconstitutionally taking property, the plan would limit development
to 10,000 square feet or a quarter of the lot, whichever is smaller.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Jeff Jennings said that because that limitation includes
grading, it is virtually a de facto development ban.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes it essentially impossible to develop a path for a home,
much less a guest house or a tennis court," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Many residents called the limitations arbitrary, and protested
that they may be unfairly imposed on properties that don't contain
any sensitive habitats.</TE>
<TE>   "This plan slaps on every property that is labeled [as sensitive]
on that map--extreme restrictions until the property owner comes down
at some point in the future and tries to prove otherwise," said
Stanley Lamport, a lawyer with the Land Use Preservation Fund. "It
does not comport with the Coastal Act, it exceeds the Coastal
Commission's authority and it's not wise policy."</TE>
<TE>   Commission staff members noted earlier that when public open space
and steep land that can't be built on are removed from the
calculation, only 14% of private property will be designated
sensitive habitat.</TE>
<TE>   Even leading up to the hearing, the atmosphere surrounding the
planning debate had become highly charged.</TE>
<TE>   Commission Chairwoman Sara Wan, a longtime Malibu resident, was
told by a former city official to pack her bags and leave the city.
An ad published in a community newspaper showed the Santa Monica
Mountains ablaze, under the theory that the plan will preserve native
plants at the expense of fire prevention. Fliers outside the meeting
labeled the commission and its executive director eco-fascists,
"enemies of freedom" and "defilers of the Constitution."</TE>
<TE>   After Major's testimony and allusions to the Nazis, Commissioner
Pedro Nava called for a break, saying, "Can I have five minutes? I
need to take a shower."</TE>
<TE>   Several other broad areas of concern dominated the hearing,
including:</TE>
<TE>   * Fire safety. After some initial concerns, Los Angeles County
fire officials said they approved of the latest version of the plan,
which includes a provision to defer to the Fire Department on fire
safety issues.</TE>
<TE>   But a number of residents who are retired firefighters said they
remained concerned about protecting large amounts of sage and
chaparral, which can fuel wildfires.</TE>
<TE>   "There is still a strong bias in the plan to place biological
protection over the protection of human life and property," said
retired fire captain Don Wallace.</TE>
<TE>   "These recent half measures are not adequate to protect my
firefighter son's life or my neighbors in the Santa Monica
Mountains."</TE>
<TE>   * The Malibu Civic Center. If adjacent land--much of it owned by
billionaire television mogul A. Jerrold Perenchio--is fully
developed, it could mean an addition of 1.4 million square feet of
commercial space.</TE>
<TE>   The Malibu Bay Co., Perenchio's holding company, has a development
agreement that is currently under review by City Hall. However, the
commission staff proposed a two-year moratorium on development in the
area, to give the city time to complete a comprehensive plan for the
property there.</TE>
<TE>   David Reznick, representing the Malibu Bay Co., urged the
commission to drop the moratorium.</TE>
<TE>   "The development agreement now before the city addresses the
future needs of the city responsibly and with foresight by protecting
sensitive coastal resources [while allowing] us to exercise rights as
property owners," Reznick said.</TE>
<TE>   Perenchio has contributed more than $900,000 to Gov. Gray Davis,
who appoints four of the Coastal Commission's 12 members.</TE>
<TE>   Perenchio's representatives have said in the past that he donates
to many candidates and expects no special treatment from the
commission.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists worried that even if the moratorium is approved
by the commission, it will not prevent large-scale development in the
Civic Center. They said after the building ban is lifted, that
construction could proceed, parcel by parcel.</TE>

<HD>Night Owls Catch a Break as OCTA Extends Bus Service</HD>
<DH>Transit: Workers on graveyard shift catch a break with
O.C.'s expanded bus service.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Instead of sleeping at night, driver Robert Bennett now cranks up his
county bus and hits Harbor Boulevard at 12:23 to hunt for
graveyard-shift workers who need a ride home.</LD>
<LD>   Bennett, who drives Route 43 from Costa Mesa to Fullerton, scans
bus stops for the janitors, busboys and hotel workers who used to
travel through the sleeping cities by foot or bike.</LD>
<LD>   "Everyone is going to benefit from this bus," says Bennett, a
34-year-old Ontario father of two who figures he will save $800 a
month in child care by working nights. "It helps the graveyard-shift
guys. It helps a bus driver like me who wants hours that give me time
to be with my children."</LD>
<TE>   Bennett found few riders this week because the late-hour service
began Monday and word has been slow to spread despite the Orange
County Transportation Authority's multilingual advertising campaign.
Some late-night workers say the four routes now running between
midnight and 4 a.m. just don't go where they work or live.</TE>
<TE>   Those who caught Route 43 early Wednesday had stories to share
about the challenges of getting around without a car late at night in
a county that bustles with traffic during the day. At 12:40 a.m.,
restaurant cook Pablo Alvarez jumps aboard at Wilson Street in Costa
Mesa, smiling because he won't have to wait nearly two hours for a
ride home from a co-worker.</TE>
<TE>   Five minutes later, chimney factory worker Fabian Sanchez, 26,
hails the bus at Segerstrom Avenue in Santa Ana instead of walking
nearly 3 miles to get home. After eight hours lifting concrete
blocks, he slips on his headphones and relaxes.</TE>
<TE>   At 1 a.m., Ken Williams, a 20-year-old Santa Ana College student
who spent the night studying and visiting relatives, pays his $1 fare
for a ride to his brother's job, where he expects to get a ride to
his home in Garden Grove.</TE>
<TE>   As the bus rolls through the lighted boulevards of desolate
fast-food joints, car dealerships and office buildings, the riders
agree that the OCTA's Night Owl Service will save them money and
time.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, I'd have to wait until 2 or 3 o'clock to get a ride
home," said Alvarez, 47, who carries an oil-stained bag of fried
shrimp from the restaurant where he works four nights a week at $10
an hour. Alvarez, who lives with his wife in an apartment near
Fairview Street and McFadden Avenue in Santa Ana, said he doesn't
drive because he has had vision problems since he was a boy.</TE>
<TE>   Most nights, Alvarez said, he hitched a ride home with a co-worker
or called his brother for a lift. Alvarez said his brother was
willing to help out, but "you don't want to bother people if you
don't have to, particularly at this time of night."</TE>
<TE>   Because the bus closest to his house, Route 47, has stopped
running, Alvarez must walk 20 minutes from the restaurant to the
Route 43 bus after midnight.</TE>
<TE>   Once he gets off at McFadden Avenue, he walks 1 mile home. For the
first time, the shrimp arrive warm. Next week, he plans to use a
bicycle to get to and from the bus.</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Leahy, OCTA's chief executive officer, said when he moved
to Orange County in early 2001, he was surprised to see people like
Alvarez walking home late at night and others cycling along
thoroughfares in the predawn hours.</TE>
<TE>   An OCTA study determined that the late-night workers are the same
people who use county buses during the day. Offering Night Owl
Service seemed like the right thing to do, said Leahy, who started
night bus service when he was the transportation chief in
Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA is not expecting packed buses immediately, said Leahy, who
plans to review ridership within a year.</TE>
<TE>   In the first four nights of the extended bus service, several
hundred riders boarded but exact numbers will not be available until
October, said OCTA spokesman George Urch.</TE>
<TE>   Leahy said he believes once word gets out, the late-night service
will attract as many as 200,000 riders a year.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Medina, who earns $50 a night working concessions at Anaheim
tourism spots, said she will be among the riders. The single mother
of three, without a car since her Dodge Dart died seven years ago,
said she pays a quarter of her nightly wages to take a taxi home to
Placentia, often well after midnight. Now she will spent a dollar
taking the Route 57 bus and connect to Route 50.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many people in my position. I've walked up Harbor
Boulevard and run into all kinds of people walking and biking at
night," said Medina.</TE>
<TE>   "The new buses are going to help us all."</TE>
<TE>   Jane Reifer, a member of Transit Advocates of Orange County bus
riders group, believes ridership will grow quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to allow me a social life," she said. "Instead of
spending money on cabs ... I might be able to go to the movies and
get home."</TE>
<TE>   Reina Schmitz, an organizer for Service Employees International
Union Local 1877, has doubts that the extended service will help the
janitors she represents, including 800 who clean office buildings
until 3 a.m. off Main Street in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   These janitors must travel 2 miles or more after work to catch the
nearest Night Owl bus on Bristol Street.</TE>
<TE>   Most rely on co-workers with cars, bicycles or walk to get home,
usually to Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   The Night Owl Service "is not enough. If workers have to walk 1 or
2 miles away from a safe area, it puts the workers in jeopardy," said
Schmitz.</TE>
<TE>   Route 53, which runs on Main Street, could also offer Night Owl
service in the future if the first four routes are successful, said
Urch.</TE>
<TE>   Janitor Socorro Murillo said the closest of the night routes would
still leave him with a 3-mile walk. But the service is a good start,
Murillo said. "I do think it will help some of the people I see out
on the streets every night."</TE>

<HD>Diocese of Orange Paid $400,000 in Priest Sex Suit</HD>
<DH>Settlement: The church opted not to fight claim against
former Dana Point pastor Lenihan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange quietly paid $400,000 last month
to settle a lawsuit accusing a priest of having had a lurid sexual
affair with an emotionally troubled woman who had sought counseling
from him.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement was the third payout by church officials to settle
allegations of sexual misconduct by John Lenihan, once the popular
pastor of St. Edward Church in Dana Point. He agreed to leave the
priesthood this spring after Catholic officials paid $1.2 million to
a San Francisco woman who accused Lenihan of impregnating her 20
years ago as a teenager and paying for her abortion.</LD>
<LD>   In a suit filed last month in Orange County Superior Court,
Margaret Cayer, 41, of Laguna Niguel alleged that Lenihan began an
18-month sexual relationship that triggered a deep depression, led to
an addiction to prescription pills and caused heartbreak for her
11-year-old handicapped son, who still prays to Jesus every night for
"Father John" to return.</LD>
<TE>   Given the accusations and previous cases against Lenihan, church
officials settled with Cayer on Aug. 23 rather than take the case to
trial, a diocesan spokeswoman said Thursday. While they disputed some
of Cayer's allegations, they conceded there was priest misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   "He did seriously cross ministerial boundaries," spokeswoman Maria
Schinderle said. "While the relationship was consenting, his past
indiscretions would not help in defense of the suit."</TE>
<TE>   Cayer attorney James P. McDonough said, "Not only children, but
fragile, vulnerable adults can also become victims of the clergy."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Lenihan, 57, nor his attorney could be reached for comment
Thursday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   The Irish-born Lenihan has admitted to only one of the three
accusations: molesting a teenage girl in the 1970s. The church paid
$25,000 to Mary Grant to settle her lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Lenihan was ousted from St. Edward last September after admitting,
under the pseudonym of "Father X," to Los Angeles Times columnist
Steve Lopez that he had had "numerous" sexual relationships with
consenting women.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County sheriff's deputies are conducting a criminal
investigation to determine whether Lenihan could be prosecuted for
sexual abuse of a minor in the case of the San Francisco woman.</TE>
<TE>   The $400,000 payout, which was not covered by insurance, comes at
a time when the Orange diocese is struggling financially from, among
other causes, a downturn in stock market investment returns.</TE>
<TE>   In Cayer's suit, she alleged that she moved to Orange County in
1999 and went to St. Edward Church "to develop inner strength and
support to deal with the long history of depression and other
psychological and emotional difficulties."</TE>
<TE>   According to the lawsuit, a year later, Lenihan offered to counsel
her and began meeting with her three or four times a week and
telephoning her house regularly. About six months after the
counseling began, Cayer said, Lenihan kissed her.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in shock," she said in an interview Thursday. "My God, I
just kissed a priest. But at the same time, I had mixed feelings
because I really liked him. This powerful man thought I was
attractive."</TE>
<TE>   A sexual relationship with Lenihan continued for about 18 months,
the suit says. They met in hotel rooms, he gave her gifts, they took
nude photos of each other, and they shared intimate nightly telephone
calls, according to the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like we were husband and wife," said Cayer, whose husband
had committed suicide in the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   In the suit, Cayer contends she had told at least six diocese
priests about the affair, but that none of the clerics approached
Lenihan or his superiors about his behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Schinderle said the facts about her contact with the priests were
otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   Cayer said Lenihan encouraged her to make her confessions to him.
But in the confessional, the couple hugged and kissed before the
priest granted her absolution for her sins, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Cayer also named an Orange County doctor in the suit, saying
Lenihan got him to provide her with Prozac, Valium and Xanax to help
her during his time away.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought ... 'Look at the power of this guy,' " she said.</TE>
<TE>   She said he called her, using sexually explicit language, up to
four times a day from Canada, where he had been sent for treatment
last fall, then broke off the relationship without explanation in
December 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Cayer's attorney said the suit will proceed without the diocese
and with Lenihan and the doctor as defendants.</TE>
<TE>   Cayer said the priest had promised never to abandon her or her
child, whom Lenihan took to the park, movies and plays. Her son loved
the cleric so much that for the past two Halloweens, he dressed up as
a priest, "just like Father John," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She also said she's angry with church leaders because they had
knowledge of Lenihan's sexual misconduct more than 20 years earlier
but did nothing. And even after a neighbor complained about Lenihan's
behavior, Bishop Tod D. Brown took the priest at his word and let him
back in his parish, she said.</TE>
<TE>   It's the same frustration felt by Katherine K. Freberg, the Irvine
attorney who got the diocese to settle for $1.2 million in another
Lenihan case.</TE>
<TE>   "What upsets me the most is that the church could have put a stop
to this so long ago when they got word that Father Lenihan was
abusing a minor back in 1978," Freberg said. "To think that so many
lives have been wrecked because of Father Lenihan and the church's
inaction is unbelievable."</TE>

<HD>State Prison Denies Visits to Blacks</HD>
<DH>Safety: Critics decry ban at one of the Lancaster
facility's four cellblocks, in place since an Aug. 12 incident in
which three guards were attacked.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All of the black inmates in one of the four cellblocks at the state
prison in Lancaster have been denied visitors for the last month,
raising concerns about discrimination and civil rights violations as
authorities investigate a bloody attack on three prison guards.</LD>
<LD>   Prison officials said visitation rights for more than 300 black
inmates were halted Aug. 12 after the serious beating of three
guards, including one who was stabbed in the head.</LD>
<LD>   Lt. Ron Nipper, a prison spokesman, said only black inmates in the
one cellblock were being kept from having visitors and from mingling
with some of the other prison population because the suspects in the
attack were believed to be black. As in many circumstances related to
keeping order in prisons, the ongoing investigation requires
isolating the inmates for the time being, Nipper said.</LD>
<TE>   But some civil rights advocates and legal experts said that
although courts often give prisons much leeway in dealing with
inmates, applying restrictions based on race raises concerns about
constitutional rights.</TE>
<TE>   "In some ways, it's kind of racial profiling at its worst," said
Kevin Wright, a criminal justice professor at the State University of
New York at Binghamton. "And in terms of prison management, generally
the idea is to treat people fairly and justly. When you start
treating them more unfairly, they get more difficult to manage."</TE>
<TE>   Miriam Gohara, an attorney with the NAACP Legal Defense and
Educational Fund, called the practice "totally unconstitutional."</TE>
<TE>   Nipper said two black prisoners may face charges of attempted
murder in connection with the August attack. Authorities are
searching for an undisclosed number of other black suspects, and
allowing the inmates more freedom would hamper the investigation, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The liabilities are too great until we get through the
investigations," he said. "And we have very good information that
they're trying to kill us."</TE>
<TE>   Russ Heimerich, a California Department of Corrections spokesman,
said that such race-based restrictions are not uncommon in state
prisons. A recording on the department's visitor information line
Thursday indicated that numerous prisons were restricting visiting
privileges on the basis of race or gang affiliation.</TE>
<TE>   Heimerich said many prisoners fraternize only with members of
their own race, often forming race-based gangs. As a result, the
distinction between a restriction aimed at a particular gang--as
opposed to one aimed at a particular race--can be hazy, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfortunate," he said. "But that's the way prison lines are
drawn."</TE>
<TE>   Joey R. Weedon, a spokesman for the American Correctional Assn., a
trade group representing corrections employees, said the Lancaster
prison officials' policy could be justified if they were unable to
define the pool of potential suspects more specifically.</TE>
<TE>   "They have to institute policies to control the population so they
can protect their staff," Weedon said.</TE>
<TE>   Heimerich said the safety of prison guards is paramount. "We have
some people very seriously hurt, so I have no sympathy for any yard
locked down as a result of it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   State corrections officials gave the following account of the
events that resulted in the current conditions at Lancaster prison.</TE>
<TE>   Early Aug. 12, an inmate walking in a group toward a dining hall
stepped out of the line and began punching Corrections Officer Thomas
Case in the face.</TE>
<TE>   When Officer Tommy Vasquez tried to help Case, a second inmate
stabbed Vasquez in the head twice with a 5 1/2-inch blade. A third
officer, Sgt. Michael Ayala, suffered a fractured jaw when hit from
behind by an unknown inmate.</TE>
<TE>   Other guards were able to quell the disturbance by using pepper
spray on the inmates.</TE>
<TE>   Case has returned to work. The other two officers are still
recovering from their injuries. The motive for the attack remains
undetermined.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said that like many state prisons, the Lancaster
facility, located in the Mojave Desert about 70 miles north of
downtown Los Angeles, is severely crowded. It was built in 1993 for
2,200 inmates but now has about 4,000. The inmate population is 39%
black, 28% Latino and 25% white, with 6% of inmates of other ethnic
backgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   Violence is nothing new for the facility. A fight in 2000 between
more than 120 white and Latino prisoners left 10 injured. In 1999, a
guard was shot during a brawl between whites and Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   Last December, more than 300 inmates clashed in the largest riot
at the prison. The melee, in which groups of Latinos, whites and
blacks fought each other, resulted in injuries to 20 prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Aug. 12 incident, officials have also restricted the
movements of all maximum-security inmates--the vast majority of the
prison's population--forbidding phone calls and work details.</TE>
<TE>   A prison-wide search has produced nearly 50 weapons, Nipper said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, for Watts resident Helen Jackson, whose 28-year-old son,
Damond, is serving time for assault, the last month has been
extremely frustrating.</TE>
<TE>   "Why not just restrict the people who were involved?" she said.
"Why all the blacks?"</TE>

<HD>Old West Meets Middle East After Sept. 11</HD>
<DH>In cowboy hat and boots, Arab American attorney admits he's
an unlikely spokesman for the Muslim community.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H.G. REZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>A poster for the movie "Tombstone" hangs prominently in Randall B.
"Randy" Hamud's home law office. It depicts a group of gunslinging
cowboys with the warning: "Justice Is Coming."</LD>
<LD>   Hamud, an Arab American attorney who often wears a cowboy hat and
boots himself, said the poster serves as a daily reminder of his
quest for justice for Muslim immigrants arrested since last
September's terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Hamud has represented four San Diego residents held as material
witnesses because they knew Nawaf Alhazmi and Khalid Almihdhar, who
lived in San Diego in 2000 and were among the hijackers who crashed a
jet into the Pentagon. Hamud has also represented more than 20 other
Middle Eastern immigrants questioned or detained by the federal
government, as well as the mother of Zacarias Moussaoui, the man
facing trial as the suspected "20th hijacker."</LD>
<TE>   In taking their cases and speaking out on their behalf, Hamud has
gone from legal obscurity as a personal injury lawyer to national
exposure as a leading Arab American attorney. He has appeared on
almost every major network news and talk program.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been an expressive voice for Arabs and Muslims," agreed
Hamud, 56. "But it's the Constitution I'm advocating; constitutional
rights and loyalty to those rights. In times of emergency, they
should not be trampled on."</TE>
<TE>   Hamud is the first to admit that he is an unlikely person to have
become a spokesman for the Arab American and Muslim community,
because he has always considered himself a secular American.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Montebello to Lebanese American parents, Hamud is Muslim.
But before Sept. 11, Islam and Arab culture were as foreign to him as
they are to many other Americans. Indeed, he said, some Muslims would
label him an infidel.</TE>
<TE>   Hamud speaks Spanish but not Arabic. More important, he does not
pray, go to mosque or fast during Ramadan.</TE>
<TE>   "This was all new to me, but I'm getting used to dealing with it,"
he said. "This is just one of the ways that my world changed after
9/11. I've had to read the Koran to understand my clients."</TE>
<TE>   Most of Hamud's previous legal experience was as a deputy city
attorney in Compton and Los Angeles and as a corporate lawyer for
Arco.</TE>
<TE>   He got his first case related to Sept. 11 five days after the
attacks, when he was asked by a friend on the board of the Islamic
Center of San Diego to represent a Kuwaiti immigrant who he says had
unwittingly helped Alhazmi with a $5,000 wire transfer.</TE>
<TE>   As the attorney and his client, who was never arrested, were
meeting with the FBI, Hamud's cell phone rang. It was another
acquaintance asking him to represent Osama Awadallah, whom the FBI
had detained as a material witness.</TE>
<TE>   Later that day, Hamud went to the downtown Metropolitan
Correctional Center, identified himself as Awadallah's attorney and
asked to see him. The guards brought out a small Middle Eastern man
who talked with Hamud for almost an hour before the lawyer referred
to him as "Osama."</TE>
<TE>   "Osama? Who's Osama?" the detainee asked.</TE>
<TE>   The guard had brought out Mohdar Abdullah, another material
witness who also needed an attorney. Hamud thus got a twofer with a
single visit.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the San Diego material witnesses represented by Hamud were
eventually freed; the other two were convicted of immigration law
violations and falsifying Social Security cards. When they were
arrested, U.S. law enforcement sources told reporters that the four
had ties to terrorists--but none was ever charged with crimes
relating to terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   In taking more than two dozen cases, most of them for free, Hamud
has gotten religion of a sort--about what he sees as the trampling of
human rights. "This fight isn't about Arabs," he said. "It's about
the Constitution."</TE>
<TE>   Hamud said government leaks have been unfair, painting his clients
as enemies of the state when they were nothing more than "casual
acquaintances" of the terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   And Hamud said he believes that measures taken by Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft, including the extended detention of people held as material
witnesses, violates basic tenets of American justice.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what happens when people condone racial and religious
profiling," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Gore, special agent in charge of the FBI's office in San
Diego, said he considers Hamud a friend and laments government leaks.</TE>
<TE>   "I agree with Randy. It's not fair to have irresponsible
statements made that can't be backed up in court. If I find out who's
responsible, I'll fire the person," Gore said.</TE>
<TE>   Hamud has proved to be an aggressive counsel. Some FBI officials
have privately labeled him a media hound. He did not help his
reputation by calling the attorney general "Adolf Ashcroft" in one
interview.</TE>
<TE>   He also did not endear himself to some law enforcement officials
last fall, when he passed out 3-by-5 cards with constitutional rights
printed in English and Arabic. The cards advised Muslims that they
have a right to remain silent and to have a lawyer present during
questioning.</TE>
<TE>   "Agents were going around to people's homes, standing on the porch
and pressing them to answer questions. They were pressing people to
take polygraphs, never advising them the tests were optional," Hamud
said.</TE>
<TE>   Gore acknowledged that agents were "showing up on people's porches
at all hours," but denied that they had pressured anybody to take a
polygraph.</TE>
<TE>   Knocking on doors "was the appropriate thing to do to determine if
there was a support structure in San Diego and to prevent another act
of terrorism," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hamud said some of his clients have cooperated eagerly with the
FBI and offered crucial information about Alhazmi and Almihdhar, a
point with which Gore agreed. "Randy is absolutely correct about the
community's help. It hasn't been widely reported in the press, but in
the 25 or so speeches I've given in the past year, I've praised the
Middle Eastern community for their assistance. I truly believe we
couldn't have been as successful without their assistance," Gore
said.</TE>
<TE>   Hamud's patriotism has been questioned on the street and on talk
shows. But he has more in common with his critics then they realize.
He idolizes his uncle Hassan, an Army Ranger who was awarded a Silver
Star and Purple Heart in the Korean War.</TE>
<TE>   His heroes include Gen. George S. Patton and National Rifle Assn.
President Charlton Heston. Hamud, an NRA member, called Heston a
"class act" who "breathed credibility back into the NRA."</TE>
<TE>   Before 9/11, Hamud said, he had grown bored with his civil
practice, which included immigration and dog bite cases.</TE>
<TE>   "I was thinking of switching careers, going into teaching," he
said. "But since Sept. 11, I've earned a new appreciation for what I
am as an attorney and for the Constitution I'm sworn to uphold."</TE>
<TE>   Hamud said he remains exasperated by clients who stop meetings to
pray. Conversations punctuated with "Allah this or Allah that" took
some getting used to, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But he has also gained a new understanding about his culture and
religion.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew the bare bones about Islam and my Arab background," he
said. "[Now] I'm talking to my mother more about both, and I'm trying
to read through the Koran."</TE>

<HD>UCLA to Scrutinize Records of Some Foreign Graduate
Students</HD>
<DH>Fraud: Officials say some from Chinese colleges submitted
bogus transcripts for PhD programs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART SILVERSTEIN and REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UCLA officials, reflecting growing national concern about foreign
students submitting fraudulent records to enroll in U.S. graduate
schools, said Thursday that they will start closely scrutinizing
transcripts from foreign applicants for a cluster of doctoral
programs.</LD>
<LD>   Campus administrators said the move, involving 11 programs in the
biomedical and life-sciences fields, was prompted by the discovery of
falsified records submitted by a prospective Chinese student. UCLA
withdrew the student's acceptance this spring after being tipped off
via e-mail by an anonymous informant about the doctored records.</LD>
<LD>   In the past, UCLA and many other American universities often did
not seek to verify such records.</LD>
<TE>   The students to be scrutinized "are future researchers, and
scientific integrity is important to us," said David I. Meyer,
director of UCLA Access, an umbrella organization for doctoral
studies in the biomedical and life sciences fields. "We want them to
have impeccable credentials when they get here, and as well when they
leave here."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's decision, disclosed Thursday by the Chronicle of Higher
Education, makes it one of the first universities in the nation to
acknowledge that it is taking such steps. Penn State University
recently launched similar reviews of all foreign students applying to
its graduate schools, and higher education groups said other
universities have quietly begun such efforts or are looking into
doing the same.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very serious concern of colleges and universities in
the United States," said Timothy J. McDonough, a spokesman for the
American Council on Education, a group representing public and
private institutions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not only an issue of students from China. With the
availability of counterfeit diplomas, and transcripts available over
the Internet, this problem could become much more widespread."</TE>
<TE>   Meyer said that the tougher scrutiny of transcripts will apply to
all students from foreign universities for those 11 departments, but
that applicants from China have caused particular concern. He said
there appears to be a widespread practice there of students putting
together their own transcripts and mailing the documents themselves,
rather than the universities sending the paperwork.</TE>
<TE>   Although the applications are authenticated with official stamps,
Meyer speculated that sometimes Chinese university officials may not
know enough English to recognize fraud. In other cases, he believes,
rogue entrepreneurs may be taking fees from the students in exchange
for submitting authentic-looking documents to U.S. universities.</TE>
<TE>   Making it more difficult to detect bogus records, some Chinese
universities do not respond to transcript verification requests from
U.S. universities, Meyer said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not entirely convinced that university administrators at
these places are particularly thrilled about their best graduates
heading off to the United States, knowing that a large percentage of
them will never come back," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cooperation Planned</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Meyer said, UCLA Access will try to establish
verification procedures with the four major Chinese universities
where most of its Chinese graduate students have come from: Fudan,
Tsinghua, Beijing and the University of Science and Technology of
China. UCLA plans to send some of its faculty working in the affected
graduate programs to meet with officials at the four universities.</TE>
<TE>   Meyer said UCLA also would begin reviewing the transcripts of
previously admitted students. "If we find evidence of fraud, if
they've been here three years or three months, these students will be
dismissed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said other graduate programs at UCLA have not adopted similar
measures, but all have been advised to take extra caution.</TE>
<TE>   Meyer said the 11 doctoral programs have enrolled 75 new students,
and they started arriving for orientation this week.</TE>
<TE>   Ten of them are foreign-educated, including two from China. Others
come from such countries as South Korea, Russia, Turkey, Chile and
Taiwan.</TE>
<TE>   After the anonymous tip, the review found that the student, from
Wuhan University, had not taken seven of the courses on the
transcript he submitted to UCLA. In addition, several grades had been
changed, and three letters of recommendation praised him for work in
courses that he had not taken. Meyer said the student, whom he did
not identify, applied to UCLA while working on a master's degree at
Purdue University. After his fabrications came to light, the student
was dismissed by that Indiana institution and turned away from UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   A handful of foreign graduate students interviewed Thursday at
UCLA said they believe the university is justified in taking
additional steps to verify transcripts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obviously a good policy to fend off an untruthful person,
especially in a scientific field," said Song Wang, 28, a fifth-year
student in cellular and molecular pathology who is from China. "If
someone could do that, what about their research? How could anyone
trust it?"</TE>
<TE>   He and others also said they were not concerned that the increased
scrutiny would hurt honest students. And several said they thought it
was fair that the new process will apply to all foreign students in
the programs, not just those from China.</TE>
<TE>   "It should be the same requirement for everyone," said Denis
Bronnikov, 25, a Russian who is in his third year of graduate studies
in human genetics.</TE>
<TE>   Procedures Differ</TE>
<TE>   Those interviewed, from India, South Korea, China and Russia, said
they were not aware of widespread cases in their home countries of
students falsifying their records. But several said it was not
uncommon for students in their countries to create their own
transcripts because often there was no system for sending
English-language transcripts to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Lan Lin, 23, a second-year pharmacology student from China, said
that she and others who wanted to transfer from Beijing University
had to create their transcripts, but that each step was supervised
and verified by that university. There would have been no chance for
any fraud, she said.</TE>
<TE>   At Penn State, Eva J. Pell, vice president for research and dean
of the graduate school, said applications from foreign university
graduates to all of her school's graduate programs have received
closer scrutiny over the past two years.</TE>
<TE>   She said her admissions staff has turned up three or four cases of
fraud, most or all of which involved Chinese students.</TE>
<TE>   Higher education experts noted that the UCLA controversy comes
amid rising concerns about possible cheating by foreign students on
entrance exams. The Educational Testing Service recently alerted U.S.
campuses that scores on the Graduate Record Examinations from China,
South Korea and Taiwan may have been inflated by cheating.</TE>

<HD>Crossing the Line With Heightened Border Security</HD>
<DH>It punishes everyone in hopes of catching a few.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSE GOTTEMOELLER</AU>
<BD>Rose Gottemoeller is a senior associate at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace. She was deputy undersecretary of
Energy in the Clinton administration.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It isn't news to people in Washington that changes in policy can have
unintended consequences. This is just the cost of progress, those
within the Beltway believe. But sometimes unintended consequences
deal such a hard blow to the strategic interests of this country that
they need to be singled out for special attention.</LD>
<LD>   Such is the case with the current U.S. government visa policy.</LD>
<LD>   After it was learned that the Sept. 11 terrorists trained for
their missions on valid U.S. visas at U.S. flight schools, no one
argued for the status quo on our visa policies. Change was urgent and
vital to preserving our national security.</LD>
<TE>   Yet the new visa regimen has had the opposite of the desired
effect. Under the new rules, any foreign expert working on scientific
or technical matters in nuclear, chemical, biological and related
fields must undergo a personal interview at a U.S. embassy or
consulate before his or her visa application is sent to Washington in
a process that can take months. Applicants are subject to this
process even if they have been vetted many times, have been shown to
be a legitimate traveler and have successfully received visas in the
past to travel to the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The effect of this new policy has been immediate. Neither the
consular system in the U.S. State Department nor the vetting system
in other agencies, such as the FBI, is set up to handle the volume of
requests. As a result, there is a backlog of 25,000 visas in the
process. It may be many months before they are reviewed.</TE>
<TE>   The unintended consequences are beginning to mount:</TE>
<TE>   * Up to 50% of foreign graduate students could not get to their
U.S. universities in time to start the 2002 academic year. The
problem is especially severe in certain technical fields, such as
mechanical engineering.</TE>
<TE>   * U.S. companies operating in countries such as China have all but
given up on getting their foreign employees into the U.S. for
training at corporate headquarters or other training sites.</TE>
<TE>   * In the former Soviet Union, U.S. cooperative programs to protect
and eliminate nuclear, chemical and biological weapons are beginning
to suffer. Russian and other experts from the former Soviet states
are not receiving visas to travel to the U.S. This alone has slowed
the programs, and it is only a matter of time before U.S. experts
working on these programs are refused visas in return.</TE>
<TE>   The impact on U.S. strategic interests is not hard to see. If the
most talented young scientists and engineers from around the world
can no longer come to U.S. graduate schools, then U.S. science and
engineering will lose its international dominance. If U.S. companies
can no longer train their foreign employees in advanced U.S. methods,
then our edge in economic globalization will begin to dull. And if
U.S. experts can no longer work with Russia and other states to
protect and eliminate weapons of mass destruction, then those weapons
will more likely fall into the hands of terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   In ways such as these, the new visa policy could profoundly harm
this country rather than help it. We cannot, however, go backward: We
must improve and strengthen ways to keep enemies of the U.S. off our
soil. U.S. visa policy has to be formulated in a way that responds to
this goal and also serves other U.S. interests.</TE>
<TE>   We need a mechanism to enable quick decisions about the vast
majority of law-abiding foreign visitors who are trying to enter the
U.S. on legitimate business. Then consular officers will be able to
concentrate on the hard cases. Once an individual is thoroughly
vetted, for example, he could be issued a "laser visa" incorporating
state-of-the-art biometric techniques that would be hard to
counterfeit and would enable the traveler to pass more quickly
through the entry process. This tool, discussed in an article found
on www.ceip.org, would be similar to that which many experienced U.S.
travelers are arguing for--a pre-clearance card showing that the
traveler is not a risk and that allows for quick passage through
airport security.</TE>
<TE>   The arguments against such systems revolve around civil liberties
and the queasiness that many Americans feel at the notion that their
identity would be contained on a computer chip. But if technology can
help us to sort through foreign visitors and admit those who are
legitimate, then it would serve all of our goals--protecting against
enemies and advancing important strategic interests.</TE>

<BD>Yossi Klein Halevi is the Israel correspondent for the
New Republic. His book, "At the Entrance to the Garden of Eden: A
Jew's Search for Hope with Christians and Muslims in the Holy Land,"
has just been published in paperback by Harper/Collins.</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>In Washington's forlorn search for allies in its war against Saddam
Hussein, the support of one nation--the people of Israel--has been
taken for granted and scarcely noted. Yet as the world debates the
wisdom of a U.S. attack on Iraq, Israel's voice needs to be heard. No
nation, after all, is likely to suffer the consequences of the war
more than the Jewish state.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli intelligence takes for granted that a cornered Hussein
will seek revenge on America's ally and unleash his nonconventional
arsenal on Israeli cities. Thousands of Israeli health-care workers
have been vaccinated against a smallpox attack, a prelude to
vaccinating the entire nation. Every Israeli home has gas mask kits
for each family member, just in case.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, Hussein renewed his periodic promise to "wipe out"
Israel. Few here treat those threats as mere bluster.</LD>
<TE>   For six weeks during the Gulf War, we endured nightly Iraqi
missile attacks, becoming a nation of insomniacs that measured time
by air raid sirens. We sat helpless in "sealed rooms" with plastic
sheets covering the windows and wet towels jammed under the doors,
strapping hysterical children into gas masks and placing babies into
plastic-covered cribs.</TE>
<TE>   Still, we were lucky. Though extensive damage made parts of Tel
Aviv resemble London during the Blitz, only one Israeli was killed by
a direct missile hit.</TE>
<TE>   Many here called that reprieve a miracle.</TE>
<TE>   This time, though, Israelis suspect that we may not be nearly as
lucky as we were in 1991. This time there may be no dress rehearsal
for apocalypse.</TE>
<TE>   Yet ask almost any Israeli Jew--left, right or center--whether the
U.S. should attack Hussein, and the answer is unequivocal: The evil
must be uprooted.</TE>
<TE>   True, we have an obvious interest in ridding the Middle East of a
formidable enemy. But so does the rest of the world--and especially
the Arab world--even if it doesn't yet realize it.</TE>
<TE>   Those of us who sit on the front line of this imminent war have
little patience with the appeasers who urge caution even as Hussein
approaches nuclear capability. After all, we've been in this scenario
before.</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, the Israeli air force flew across the hostile airspace of
the Middle East and destroyed Hussein's nuclear facility at Osirak.</TE>
<TE>   The international reaction was unanimous outrage. Israel was
accused of barbarism and piracy; even the Reagan administration
condemned us.</TE>
<TE>   But we knew that we had saved not only ourselves but also much of
the world from a danger that no one else was ready to confront.</TE>
<TE>   More than two decades later, we received a belated "thank you" of
sorts.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Nashville on Aug. 26,
Vice President Dick Cheney dismissed the Bush administration's
critics who prefer to wait until Hussein achieves nuclear capability,
at which point "it would become even harder for us to gather friends
and allies to oppose him."</TE>
<TE>   Indirectly citing Israel's precedent, Cheney noted: "As one of
those who worked to assemble the Gulf War coalition, I can tell you
that our job then would have been infinitely more difficult in the
face of a nuclear-armed Saddam Hussein."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the missile assault on its cities during the Gulf War,
Israel deliberately kept out of the anti-Iraq global coalition,
respecting the U.S. concern that an overt Israeli presence in the war
effort could unsettle the coalition's Arab supporters.</TE>
<TE>   This time, though, there is no Arab coalition. Rather than support
the liberation of an Arab nation from the rule of a genocidal madman,
the Arab world appears to be siding with Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, there is no longer any reason for Israel to keep out
of the current war debate.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's courage is precisely what we can offer the world at this
crucial moment.</TE>
<TE>   We, who alone confronted Hussein's nuclear ambitions in 1981 and
who must now contend with his chemical and biological arsenal, say to
Washington's wavering allies: If not now, when?</TE>

<HD>A Huge Ripple Effect</HD>
<DH>Dockworkers' strike would hurt the economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK KYSER</AU>
<BD>Jack Kyser is chief economist of the Los Angeles County
Economic Development Corp.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dockworkers and their shipping employers are locked in high-stakes
contract negotiations over the future of West Coast ports. Hanging in
the balance are an increasingly fragile U.S. economy and the 4
million American workers whose livelihoods depend on cargo moving
through these ports.</LD>
<LD>   Threatened work slowdowns by the International Longshore and
Warehouse Union or an employer lockout could be the proverbial straw
that breaks the economy's back. Seven percent of the nation's gross
domestic product is directly connected to the West Coast ports. The
economy is projected to lose $1 billion a day if the ports are shut
down.</LD>
<LD>   At the center of the contract dispute is the issue of technology.
Longshore workers fear that technology will cost jobs. In reality,
technology could drive job growth by creating efficiencies that would
enable the ports to move cargo more quickly and increase capacity to
handle the projected doubling of imports from Asia over the next 10
years. More capacity and more cargo would mean more jobs--on the
waterfront and nationwide.</LD>
<TE>   Technology on the waterfront is also a mandate in the post-Sept.
11 world. It is the most effective weapon in the battle to enhance
port security. By computerizing the movement of confidential cargo
information, the federal government is seeking to extend the
perimeter of security to ports of origin around the world. Currently,
this information is re-keyed by longshore clerks. Efficiencies
created by technology also will offset the cost of security measures
and create a port complex poised for expansion.</TE>
<TE>   Trade growth is critical to our region's economic future. It is
the reason Congress agreed to invest $2 billion in the Alameda
Corridor. It was also the rationale for investing billions of dollars
in new mega-terminals at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.
Modernizing the terminals is the only way to ensure that these
investments can deliver their promised return on investment.</TE>
<TE>   How outdated are the terminals on the West Coast? In Long Beach, a
trucker can wait up to two hours to enter the terminal, while it
takes only 30 seconds in Singapore. Efficient Asian ports can unload
and reload a large container ship in about 40 hours, compared with 76
hours in Southern California. The port in Hong Kong, which relies on
modern technology, moves four times the number of cargo containers
per acre per year than all West Coast ports combined.</TE>
<TE>   Dockworkers are rightfully concerned that technology will
eliminate jobs. The Pacific Maritime Assn., representing employers,
projects that a maximum of 400 of the union's 10,500 members will be
affected by new technology. To soften the blow, the PMA has
guaranteed them lifetime job protection. Overall employment is
expected to grow once technology is fully implemented by 2006.</TE>
<TE>   It also appears that the employers are willing to pay a steep
price for technology on the docks. The offer on the table provides
100% employer-paid health coverage, pension increases, job guarantees
and a wage rate that would continue the West Coast longshore workers'
status as the royalty of union workers. Average salaries for
full-time dockworkers are more than $100,000 a year and are expected
to grow handsomely under the new contract.</TE>
<TE>   The employers and dockworkers should keep three things in mind:
The first priority is to make sure the ports remain fully operational
during negotiations. Work slowdowns, strikes or lockouts are not
viable alternatives for a shaky economy. Second, technology is a
mandate. Without modernizing the ports, the West Coast will
compromise its competitive standing and not realize its potential as
an engine for growth. Finally, the two sides should bring these talks
to a conclusion. The contract expired two months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Reaching a new labor pact would send an important message to the
nation that the shipping companies and the dockworkers are doing
their part to support the U.S. economy.</TE>

<HD>You Will Fly the Flag, and You Will Like It</HD>
<DH>Patriotism is to be found in the heart, not the hand that
takes away liberty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AIMEE LIU</AU>
<BD>Aimee Liu, author of the forthcoming novel "Flash
House," is president of PEN USA.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Returning from an early walk Wednesday--our day of national
mourning--I found a flag stuck in the geranium plant at the end of
our driveway. A foot-long laminated flag on a 2-foot spike. The
attached tag read, "Compliments of your neighborhood Realtor
[followed by name and phone number]. Proudly wave your flag on these
days:" And then it listed all the national secular holidays from New
Year's to Veteran's Day. Sept. 11 was missing from the list, but I
presume that will last only until the stock of these blue and white
notices is exhausted and the Realtors reprint.</LD>
<LD>   I looked up and down the block. Every driveway had its flag. The
Japanese American household across the street. The Italians. The
Persians. The Lithuanians. Even the houses under construction where
no one was living had American flags. And, of course, the houses that
were up for sale. Clearly a case of massive involuntary flag-waving.
Imposed flag-waving. Worse, commercial flag-waving.</LD>
<LD>   For let's face it, the real motivational message is this: May the
spirit of patriotism inspired by this flag move you so profoundly
that you'll call me at the following number, let me sell your house
and advance my sales ranking to the Platinum Circle.</LD>
<TE>   I plucked the flag from the pot, removed the notice and placed the
flag in another spot, unseen from the street.</TE>
<TE>   Let me be clear. My argument is not against the flag. It is the
presumption, the imposition of the sentiment and worse, the
corruption of patriotism that makes me irate.</TE>
<TE>   Let me be clearer. I had spent the hour before this listening to
the names of the dead being read at the World Trade Center. I noted
the Arab names, the Korean and Indian, Scandinavian and African names
as well as the many Kellys and Smiths. I was moved all over again and
profoundly sad for the victims and their survivors.</TE>
<TE>   I thought of the numerous survivors who have joined forces as
Families for Peace to visit the civilian victims of the bombing in
Afghanistan and to speak out against the proposed war against Iraq.
To my mind, these brave individuals represent the best of America and
the transformative good that can rise from ashes sown by evil. They
represent the independent thought, courage and free will that lie at
the heart of our national identity. They do not represent mandatory
flag-waving.</TE>
<TE>   Nor do they represent the many ways this administration has seized
the excuse of terrorism to curb the freedoms that I have always
believed form the core truth behind our flag. Thanks to President
Bush, John Ashcroft and the so-called USA Patriot Act, our government
is authorized to conduct surveillance on U.S. citizens even when
there is no probable cause.</TE>
<TE>   "Roving wiretap" authority allows the government to intercept
conversations on cell phones and to monitor multiple telephones and
computers used by an individual, regardless of how many other people
use the same instruments (such as pay phones or Internet cafe
computers). Section 215 of the Patriot Act authorizes the FBI to
subpoena records from anybody it wants and prosecute those subpoenaed
if they tell anyone about it. Federal investigators may now search
and seize our belongings without probable cause as long as they claim
the search is "related to terrorism or clandestine intelligence
activities." They may monitor our religious and political
institutions using the same "standard."</TE>
<TE>   Noncitizens may be deported with little or no judicial review, and
Americans accused of activities that relate to terrorism may be
jailed indefinitely without trial and without being charged or
allowed to confront the witnesses against them.</TE>
<TE>   So much for the 1st, 4th, 5th and 6th Amendments to the U.S.
Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   All this in the name of the "patriotism" that laminated commercial
giveaway flags have come to symbolize.</TE>
<TE>   The sorry truth is that our national promise of "liberty and
justice for all" is under attack not just by terrorists from afar but
by those who warn us to hoist the Stars and Stripes--or else.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The late Death Row Records rapper Tupac Shakur and death row inmate
Stanley "Tookie" Williams each made the news in the last week. The
parallel stories offer a glimpse into the brutality of gang life.
They also hold a mirror to those taking the peek.</LD>
<LD>   No one has ever been charged for Shakur's 1996 slaying on the
streets of Las Vegas. Times reporter Chuck Phillips spent a year
reviewing court documents and interviewing investigators and gang
members.</LD>
<LD>   His findings, reported in The Times Sept. 6 and 7, revealed as
much about the perverse mixture of celebrity and violence that has
come to surround street gangs as about who killed Shakur.</LD>
<TE>   Stars whose fame came from rap songs about kicking in rivals'
faces, sometimes written from experience, modeled themselves after
the old-style mobsters Hollywood has long glorified, just as teenage
gangbangers today emulate the lifestyles celebrated in vulgar gangsta
rap. Crips and Bloods, hired as bodyguards, paraded around Las Vegas
in fancy cars and took over hotels, paying the tab with drug money,
beating each other over taunts and turf.</TE>
<TE>   And they all died young. Shakur, dead at 25. The Crip fingered as
the gunman, killed at 23 over drugs. A witness from Shakur's
entourage, dead at 19 in another shooting. Rival rapper Notorious
B.I.G., gunned down outside a Los Angeles automotive museum. He was
24 years old.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, by contrast, is 48, San Quentin being safer than the
streets these last 20 years. Williams, who helped launch the first
Crips "set" 30 years ago, on Tuesday lost a federal appeal of his
death sentence for four 1979 murders.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the court made a rare recommendation that
Williams seek clemency from Gov. Gray Davis. While in prison, the
inmate co-authored children's books that attempt to steer kids away
from gangs. The books inspired a Swiss lawmaker to nominate Williams
for a Nobel Peace Prize.</TE>
<TE>   Williams is hardly Nobel laureate material. He took the lives of
no fewer than four people, and his legacy, at least in some sense, is
entwined with the many thousands of gang killings that have taken
place in the last decades, up to and after Shakur's.</TE>
<TE>   But if he is no candidate for sainthood, he is one for clemency.
The effort he has since put into undoing that harm is a powerful
argument for sparing his life. Kids coming up in the sort of
neighborhoods that Williams and Shakur did desperately need to hear
the rap against gangs before the music booming from so many car
stereos helps seduce them into that dead-end life.</TE>
<TE>   There are those who read about Shakur's murder and Williams' death
sentence and say, "Who cares?" They echo the jaded cops who used to
call gang neighborhoods "self-cleaning ovens" because the young
toughs were so adept at killing each other off. At the other extreme
are those who feign solidarity by buying the music that makes the
stars rich, while maintaining a genteel distance from the wretched
reality gangsta rap reflects.</TE>
<TE>   Neither response answers the most urgent question--how to reach
the Tupacs and Tookies at 6 or 8 or 12 and guide them along other
paths to better lives that too many kids simply do not know are
there.</TE>

<LD>President Bush on Thursday went before the world community in his
campaign against Iraq. His speech to the U.N. General Assembly
included no startling revelations, but it effectively cataloged
Saddam Hussein's decade-long defiance of demands that Iraq show it
has destroyed its most dangerous weapons. Bush's recital of Hussein's
torture of his people, use of gas against Iran and Iraqi Kurds and
firing of missiles at Israel, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain was chilling.
But he was not persuasive about the urgency to get rid of Hussein now
and by any means.</LD>
<LD>   After weeks of Vice President Dick Cheney and Bush aides' beating
the war drums, the president's remarks may have represented more a
courtesy in response to his critics than a commitment to getting U.N.
Security Council approval for military action. Still, the best course
remains U.N. inspectors returning to Iraq with the ability to go
anywhere at any time in the search for weapons Baghdad promised to
give up more than a decade ago.</LD>
<LD>   Bush promised that Washington would work with the U.N. on a new
demand to present to Iraq. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell is
expected to consult with other Security Council members on a deadline
for the readmission of inspectors Iraq has barred since 1998. The
sooner that deadline, the better.</LD>
<TE>   The Security Council will have to decide what to do if Iraq
continues its defiance, or if it admits inspectors but then hinders
their activities. Bush properly challenged the U.N. to show its
deliberations are "more than talk" and its resolutions "more than
wishes." The president raised the specter of the League of Nations,
predecessor of the United Nations, which was impotent when Japan
invaded Manchuria in 1931 and Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935. The
League was crippled from its start by the refusal of the United
States to join.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan agreed that the Security Council
"must face its responsibilities" if Iraq's defiance continues. But
Annan also was blunt in warning Washington against playing the lone
cowboy, saying this would undercut the international rule of law and
cause upheaval in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking after Annan, Bush kept his options open, declaring that
if Security Council resolutions are not enforced, "action will be
unavoidable."</TE>
<TE>   Washington's rhetoric has alarmed potential allies. German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has repeatedly warned against war in
Iraq. Three of the five permanent members of the Security
Council--France, Russia and China--also have distanced themselves
from the Bush administration on the issue. They agree that Iraq is
dangerous, that it has refused to destroy its stockpiles of chemical
and biological weapons and that it has not given up on developing
nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   But demanding compliance with U.N. resolutions is different from
insisting on a "regime change." There is legitimate concern for the
precedent that toppling Hussein would set. Nuclear-armed India
already has fought three wars with Pakistan, which now also has
nuclear weapons. New Delhi could try to remove a Pakistani government
if it sponsored terrorists attacking India. China considers Taiwan a
renegade province and could use the island's purchase of U.S. weapons
as a pretext for invasion.</TE>
<TE>   As long as the president warns that the United States may need to
intervene alone, Congress must hold hearings at which the Bush
administration can present its case for action to the American
people. Republicans are pushing for a vote on an invasion and removal
of Hussein before the November elections, believing they will benefit
from any votes by Democrats against military action.</TE>
<TE>   But political point-scoring can't get in the way of answers
Americans need. How many U.S. troops would be involved if Washington
fails to get U.N. support and goes it alone? How long would soldiers
need to occupy Iraq while a new government takes shape? How would all
of this affect the war on terror?</TE>
<TE>   Last week's attempted assassination of Afghan President Hamid
Karzai and continued battles between warlords in Afghanistan
demonstrate how much more needs to be done to rebuild that country.
Al Qaeda members are reported to be in 95 countries and have access
to money that lets them plot more devastation.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi government has earned its pariah status. The United
Nations will have to determine how to enforce its 16 resolutions,
from 1990 to 1998, demanding that Iraq destroy weapons, free
prisoners of war and supply medicine to its people. Setting a
deadline to admit weapons inspectors should be easy; that's the first
step. The Bush administration should keep working closely with the
United Nations; getting its support would lend legitimacy to the
argument that military force against Iraq is necessary.</TE>

<LD>President Bush's U.N. speech Thursday had the impact of "Mr.
Gorbachev, tear down this wall." It also told Congress, "Get on board
or lose your positions in November." We have a president who says
what he means and whom we can trust to mean what he says.</LD>

<TE>   Sept. 11: Bush at his best, leading the nation in Washington,
Pennsylvania and New York. Sept. 12: Bush at his worst,
saber-rattling as he mouthed the opinions of his Cabinet war hawks.
All in a week's work.</TE>

<TE>   If Bush moves forward with his attack on Iraq he will invite the
rage of every Muslim fanatic around the world--and every day will be
Sept. 11. Any weapons of mass destruction that Saddam Hussein might
have, have already found their way to his international followers.</TE>

<TE>   Hussein is a brutal, secular dictator who controls the
second-largest crude oil reserves in the world. It's obvious that he
would want to protect his power by limiting personal freedoms,
eliminating opposition, squashing separatists and defending his
territory from Iraq's zealot neighbors. But what does he stand to
gain in launching any kind of attack on the U.S.--or, for that
matter, Israel--as the administration seems to think he might? Were
he to so much as sneeze across his borders again, he would be utterly
annihilated.</TE>

<TE>   "Congress Balks at Rushing Vote," Sept. 11: The cowardice of those
senators who refuse to bring the question of war against Iraq to the
floor for a vote stands as a disgraceful contrast to the bravery of
the heroes of Sept. 11. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle and other,
mostly Democratic, senators are holding up this crucial vote because
they are afraid to vote no and face angry voters. Their spineless
fear is appalling.</TE>

<TE>   It outrages me to hear that Bush is putting pressure on Congress
to approve an attack on Iraq without giving it sufficient evidence
and more time to make a well-thought-out decision. I agree with
Daschle when he states, "It's so important that we do this right, not
rush to some judgment."</TE>
<TE>   One wonders if there are ulterior motives behind Bush's urgency to
go to war.</TE>

<LD>As I have recently moved from Los Angeles to East Africa, I read
"Coming Home to Africa" (Sept. 10) with great interest. My
experiences as an African American woman living in Nairobi, Kenya,
with a white American boyfriend are in stark contrast to those
described in the article. Aside from the inconveniences of living in
a Third World country, I have encountered more discrimination here
than I ever did in the U.S. Merely because I am with a white man,
Kenyans often assume I am a prostitute.</LD>
<LD>   Once we leave our house, my boyfriend and I are constantly
subjected to blatant stares and even sneers. Recently, while driving
outside of the city, we were taunted by a group of Kenyan men, one
man going so far as to hint that he would throw a large stone at us.</LD>
<LD>   In the malls here, I have encountered many rude proprietors if I
am shopping alone. However, if my boyfriend is with me, their
attitudes lighten up considerably, and they couldn't be nicer. The
only time I've been treated as a "sista" is when a local man tried to
sell me a tourist trinket; he said he would give me a discount
because we are the same color. While I have met a few black Kenyans
who are genuinely nice, I would encourage black Americans to think
twice about "coming home."</LD>

<LD>I note in "Tribes Flex Power on Sacred Sites" (Sept. 10) a proposed
new law to require Indian tribes to be notified of any proposed
construction within 20 miles of their reservations to prevent
construction on "sacred sites." One would believe this would lead to
endless lawsuits. My question is about the large number of Indian
casinos being built on reservations--are these, by their very nature,
not sacred sites? It seems to be acceptable to devastate hundreds of
acres of reservation lands for a gambling hall to be built, but I
guess these are the new "sacred sites."</LD>

<LD>Re "Bin Laden: a Known Monster Before 9/11," Commentary, Sept. 10:
Robert Scheer correctly observes that Al Qaeda's "bloody track record
in attacking U.S. targets overseas and even the exact location of its
base of operations were all known by both the Clinton and George W.
Bush administrations." He fails to note that Bush was president for
only eight months prior to 9/11.</LD>
<LD>   President Clinton had 96 months to deal with Al Qaeda and other
terrorists. There was the first bombing of the World Trade Center
with the resulting deaths. The bombing of the Khobar Towers killed
many Americans. Al Qaeda killed hundreds with the bombings of two
U.S. embassies. It struck again with the bombing of the U.S. Navy
destroyer Cole--17 Americans were murdered. Unfortunately, Clinton
did precious little to discourage Al Qaeda.</LD>
<LD>   Devon Showley</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Do I detect a contradiction in Scheer's column? He faults the
Clinton and Bush administrations, the FBI and CIA for failing to
recognize obvious signs leading to 9/11. Then he concludes by
criticizing the Bush administration for wanting to take preemptive
action against Iraq.</TE>

<TE>   I have one question to add to Scheer's Bin Laden piece. Wasn't it
odd that the administration was able to identify the 19 terrorists so
quickly after 9/11, less than 10 days later?</TE>
<TE>   Harriet Dean</TE>
<TE>   Palm Springs</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scheer referenced the Monica Lewinsky scandal and it reminded me
of the anger I felt then, and feel now, that when Linda Tripp opened
her trap, we listened as if there were nothing more important in the
universe. When our own agencies were warned about the many flight
students from the Middle East, our universe collapsed in their trap.</TE>

<LD>I would like to commend The Times for its Sept. 11 editorial, "Arafat

attitude toward peace negotiations was right on. As Israeli statesman
Abba Eban once said of the Palestinians in general, Arafat never
misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity.</LD>
<LD>   I believe that it is becoming more apparent to the world that
Arafat is more committed to the destruction of Israel than he is to
peace and the betterment of the Palestinian people.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Clearing the Road for Pet Projects," Sept. 9: Proposition 51 on
the November ballot is a very bad initiative, not just for the state
of California but for the cause it says it serves. Proposition 51
will create a large pool of funding--about $850 million a
year--reserved for transportation and environmental projects. This
pool of money will be exempt from the criteria used to evaluate, rank
and fund these projects. It is clear that the purpose of the
initiative is to provide large amounts of state funding for projects
that are not otherwise viable or cost-effective. California is
already facing a 25% deficit, and this initiative, if enacted, will
deepen cuts to critical programs.</LD>
<LD>   Every single project on the Proposition 51 list is a loser, what
with the benefits it has focused toward upper-income landowners and
businesses. In my town, an L.A. County clinic that served the poor
was closed recently because of a lack of funding. I think it is
scandalous to fund lifestyle enhancements for the wealthy out of the
funding for the needy.</LD>
<LD>   John Yard</LD>
<TE>   Sunland-Tujunga</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This menagerie of organizations has glommed onto the California
initiative process under the auspices of the Planning and
Conservation League's Proposition 51. This is quite a testament to
the citizenship of the executives who have chosen to lead their
organizations in undermining the possibility of good governance for
California.</TE>
<TE>   Unless I am mistaken, it is the job of the state Legislature and
the governor to set spending priorities via the budgetary process.
Taxpayers pay dearly to staff the legislative and executive branches
of state government to perform this very function. Taxpayers also pay
dearly to have a cadre of state-employed professional managers,
engineers and affiliated staff whose job is to prioritize and
implement transportation-related projects.</TE>
<TE>   Now, along comes this assembly of financially flush, self-serving
jackals who brazenly want to usurp the role of the Legislature and
the governor by diverting 30% of auto sales taxes to finance their
private-sector needs. Essentially, they want the best laws that money
can buy for their parochial little projects. Why not be honest about
it and submit an initiative for a general tax increase to finance
these thinly disguised private projects?</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The city of Los Angeles, contrary to the implication of your Sept. 7
editorial, "Aussie Water Lesson," remains committed to the
environmental restoration of the Owens Valley. About one-third of the
water from the eastern Sierra that has traditionally been available
to and historically met the water needs of the city has been
reallocated for mitigating the environmental impacts of the city's
operations. This has been made possible by the outstanding water
conservation efforts of the residents of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The parties in Inyo County need to have a similar commitment to
the terms of the Inyo-L.A. water agreement, which recognizes the
legitimate needs of Los Angeles for water that does not negatively
impact the environment. Under the terms of the memorandum of
understanding with Inyo County and other parties, after re-watering
the Owens River, L.A. is entitled to recover the water that reaches
the delta of the Owens Lake to meet the needs of its citizens.</LD>
<TE>   The size of the pumping station that will return unused water to
the Los Angeles Aqueduct should be a nonissue, as the quantity of
water that could be pumped even by a larger pump station is small,
relative to the city's Owens Valley operations. Los Angeles has
offered to install a smaller pumping station, subject to receiving a
quantity of water equal to that which may pass the station from
unallocated water that is designated for environmental purposes under
the Inyo-L.A. agreement.</TE>
<TE>   The parties should accept this offer and allow the city to move
ahead with implementation of the Owens River re-watering without
forcing the issue to a court resolution.</TE>

doesn't add up. Why, I just downloaded a photo off the Internet that

<HD>Davis Signs Bill Boosting Clean Energy</HD>
<DH>Legislation: Advocates praise law requiring utilities to
buy more renewable power. But providers say it is costly, could slow
production.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis on Thursday signed into law a renewable energy bill
praised as ambitious by environmentalists but disdained as overly
complicated by those who make electricity with the sun, wind and
geothermal heat.</LD>
<LD>   Advocates say the law will push California to the forefront of
clean energy development. But nearly all the companies that make the
renewable electricity oppose the bill as too cumbersome. They say it
may actually impede construction of more wind and solar farms.</LD>
<LD>   The governor also announced the signing of bills to preserve
public beach access and set the rules for a future low-level
radioactive waste dump now that the state has abandoned its effort at
Ward Valley, near Needles.</LD>
<TE>   SB 1078 by Sen. Byron Sher (D-Stanford) requires the state's
private utilities to increase the share of electricity they sell to
customers that comes from renewable sources by 1% a year. The goal is
to reach 20% by 2017.</TE>
<TE>   Davis called the bill "the most ambitious" renewable energy
standard in the nation. Consumer and environmental groups hailed the
new law, saying that even though electricity production by sun, wind
or underground steam costs more than burning natural gas, it helps
reduce air pollution and buffers the state from gas price spikes.</TE>
<TE>   Under SB 1078 and a companion bill, SB 1038, also by Sher and also
signed by Davis, state regulators will set a benchmark price based on
the long-term market cost of electricity. Renewable power sellers
will then offer contracts of at least 10 years to the utilities. Any
gap between the benchmark price and the price at which companies
offer to sell can be bridged with a $135-million subsidy from a
charge on customers' monthly utility bills.</TE>
<TE>   That charge--$2 a month for the average residential customer--was
imposed in 1998 to help foster renewable energy and conservation and
to assist poor people. A law passed last year extends the
charge--which is less than half a cent per kilowatt-hour--until 2012.</TE>
<TE>   Several aspects of the new law worry energy producers. That
includes a requirement that in order to qualify for the subsidy they
must pay workers prevailing wages, which are typically tied to union
scales.</TE>
<TE>   CalEnergy, which owns 10 geothermal power plants in Imperial
County, plans a major expansion, said company Vice President Jonathan
Weisgall. But CalEnergy would have to pay hundreds of construction
workers wages comparable to those of Los Angeles and San Diego if it
chose to sell its power to Southern California Edison and accept a
subsidy.</TE>
<TE>   "The prevailing-wage legislation may greatly increase the cost of
building a renewable energy plant at a time when the state is already
concerned about the already high cost of renewable energy," Weisgall
said.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, which both
support the bill, now get 12% to 15% of their electricity from
renewable sources. San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, a much smaller utility,
gets roughly 1% of its power from renewable sources.</TE>
<TE>   Davis also signed AB 2214 by Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder
Creek), which environmentalists described as "the final nail in the
coffin" of Ward Valley. The administration of former Gov. Pete Wilson
tried to license and construct a low-level radioactive waste dump at
Ward Valley in the Mojave Desert.</TE>
<TE>   The project was abandoned in 2000 because of concerns that
radioactivity could migrate through underground drinking water
supplies. California continues to ship low-level waste to Utah and
South Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   Keeley called the Ward Valley dump "a fatally flawed site with a
fatally flawed strategy." By establishing a clear set of standards
for disposal of low-level nuclear waste, Keeley said his bill will
encourage private companies to build a repository somewhere else.</TE>
<TE>   The governor also signed SB 1962 by Sen. Richard Polanco (D-Los
Angeles) to prevent the expiration of hundreds of offers by private
landowners to provide public access to the coast.</TE>
<TE>   Polanco's bill requires the state Coastal Conservancy to accept
the offers. In order to get permission to build along the coast,
landowners often were required by the Coastal Commission to offer
public access. The commission figured that cities, counties or
nonprofit agencies would accept the offers and take responsibility
for installing walkways and garbage cans and assume liability in case
of injuries.</TE>
<TE>   But local governments have been reluctant to step up, and hundreds
of offers are nearing the end of their 21-year terms.</TE>
<TE>   Davis also signed two bills related to the threat of oil spills:
AB 2083 by Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara) allows
the state to track the transport of oil by tankers between Los
Angeles and San Francisco, and SB 849 by Sen. Tom Torlakson
(D-Antioch) raises money for an oil spill prevention program by
increasing the fee on a barrel of crude oil from 4 cents to 5 cents.</TE>

<HD>Skaters' Helmet Bill Signed</HD>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Skateboarders, in-line skaters and scooter operators younger than 18
must wear safety helmets beginning Jan. 1 or face a $25 fine under a
bill signed Thursday by Gov. Gray Davis.</LD>
<LD>   The measure, SB 1924, by Sen. Jack O'Connell, a Democratic
candidate for state schools superintendent from San Luis Obispo, will
subject offenders to the same fine that has been levied for years
against young bicyclists who do not wear safety headgear.</LD>
<LD>   The bill was suggested by students at Hawthorne Elementary School
in San Luis Obispo after a classmate died in a scooter crash.
O'Connell called it a common sense plan to prevent head injuries.</LD>
<TE>   Several other states, including New York and New Jersey, have
similar laws.</TE>
<TE>   The governor also signed these bills Thursday:</TE>
<TE>   * Gangs--SB 1416 by Sen. Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) extends
until June 2008 the life of the Soledad Enrichment Action charter
schools in Los Angeles County, which teach former gang members and
youngsters who are at risk of quitting school and turning to crime.
Approximately 730 students attend the schools. The measure also will
repeal the schools' special accountability requirements and replace
them with standards that apply to other schools.</TE>
<TE>   * Amber alert--AB 415 by Assemblyman George Runner Jr.
(R-Lancaster) writes into law the Amber alert system for recovery of
children who are abducted and in imminent danger of harm. The
statewide system has already played an important role in recent
kidnapping cases, although it was operated voluntarily by law
enforcement agencies, various other government departments and
broadcasters. The governor's signature gives it the force of law.</TE>
<TE>   * Tax filing--AB 1036 by Assemblyman Jerome Horton (D-Inglewood)
expands the authority of the state Board of Equalization to accept
the filing of certain business tax returns via the Internet. These
will include returns under the cigarette and tobacco products tax,
emergency telephone users surcharge, hazardous substance tax and
others.</TE>
<TE>   * Teaching credentials--SB 1656 by Sen. Jack Scott (D-Altadena)
amends current law to make it clear that the California Teacher
Credentialing Commission is empowered to deny or suspend the teaching
credential of anyone who registers as a sex offender under the laws
of other states or the federal government.</TE>

<HD>Latino Fund Puts Money to Work</HD>
<DH>Community: Destino foundation's latest effort focuses on
career and vocational training for more promising futures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It wasn't too long ago that Alfredo Pacheco was hunting for work,
applying at one place after another but coming up empty each time.
Then the Oxnard laborer found a way to turn his fortunes around.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to a summer training program, sponsored in part by the
Destino 2000 endowment, the 21-year-old learned enough about
construction to land a good-paying job that allowed him to help
support his family and start carving a career path.</LD>
<LD>   "It's the best thing to ever happen to me," said Pacheco, who now
earns $11.55 an hour working for a company that is helping to build
faculty housing at Cal State Channel Islands. "This is the best job I
ever had."</LD>
<TE>   Long known for its charitable efforts on behalf of the county's
Latino community, Destino 2000 is stepping up efforts to provide
vocational instruction and career guidance through a range of
internships and work-training programs.</TE>
<TE>   The Destino fund, established in 1996 by Latino philanthropists
and community leaders, has contributed more than $200,000 to efforts
to improve literacy, health care and parenting. The money also has
been used to help foster youth leadership skills and curtail teen
pregnancy, drug abuse and gang violence.</TE>
<TE>   Those efforts have produced a slew of success stories, young
people whose lives have been turned around because of the help
provided by Destino dollars.</TE>
<TE>   But in recent years, the endowment also has turned increasing
attention toward programs that extend beyond such immediate concerns,
focusing on efforts that can lift people economically and provide the
foundation for lifelong changes.</TE>
<TE>   "Our social programs are still at the core of what we do, but we
want to broaden our efforts," said Hank Lacayo, a Destino 2000
founder and board member. "I'm interested in reaching those who
otherwise might fall through the cracks if no one pays attention to
them."</TE>
<TE>   The Destino fund provided $2,500 in 1998 for youth employment
training and $14,000 two years ago to train Latino students at
Fillmore High School in business careers.</TE>
<TE>   The endowment also has given $7,900 in the last two years to the
Carnegie Art Museum in Oxnard to hire and train interns.</TE>
<TE>   The museum has hired three so far, including Ventura resident
Arturo Jaramillo. The 41-year-old Cal State Northridge student was
supposed to be a summer intern but performed so well that his tenure
was extended through the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Jaramillo, an aspiring teacher and artist who started at the
museum in June, has learned all about its operations, from how to
select exhibits to how to give tours. He also has given presentations
at schools.</TE>
<TE>   "They are teaching me [about] all levels and departments of the
art museum," said Jaramillo, who, unbeknownst to him, was nominated
for the Carnegie internship by the instructor of an art class he had
taken.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really a blessing," he said. "I don't know how I would
have ever gotten this opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Susan Lefevre, the museum's curator of education, said the
blessing works both ways.</TE>
<TE>   "The neat thing about it is the high caliber [of intern] we have
gotten," she said. "We are very pleased that the Destino foundation
has looked favorably on us."</TE>
<TE>   One of Destino's most recent vocational endeavors was a $5,000
grant to the Tri Counties Labor Foundation to help fund a first-time
training and certification program held this summer for construction
workers.</TE>
<TE>   While most of the $120,000 for that program came from
Laborers-AGC, a nonprofit foundation dedicated to improving education
and training in the construction trade, Destino's money allowed the
labor foundation to provide boots, tool belts and other supplies
necessary for program participants to get work once they completed
the training.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of them couldn't go to work without these things, so it
really [filled a] need," said Marilyn Valenzuela, president and
executive director of the Oxnard-based foundation.</TE>
<TE>   El Rio resident Clemente Echaveste decided to go through the
program after being laid off from a construction job this year. The
five-day-a-week program taught him how to put up drywall, install
wiring, build stairs and operate heavy equipment.</TE>
<TE>   He also earned certification to handle everything from asbestos to
hazardous waste.</TE>
<TE>   After completing the program, Echaveste received a diploma and a
job offer from a Ventura excavation business.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't really prepared for anything like this," said Echaveste,
26. "It helps give you a better chance of getting a job."</TE>
<TE>   Alfredo Pacheco feels the same way.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, if not for the training program, he believes he likely
would have been stuck in a dead-end job, doing general labor for a
fraction of the pay.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a really good program," he said. "I appreciate the
opportunity. Believe me, I don't take it for granted."</TE>

<HD>Calories Don't Count at Fairplex</HD>
<DH>Recreation: L.A. County Fair, which begins today, adds
deep-fried Snickers as part of this year's push for self-indulgence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than a million visitors are expected at the 80th L.A. County
Fair, which opens today in Pomona.</LD>
<LD>   The event, which continues through Sept. 29, is the largest county
fair in the nation, costs $20 million to mount and points to such
great moments in its long history as the introduction, in 1934, of
the Frisbee.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, 55-year-old Joann Eldridge of Pomona walked through
the fairgrounds with her 11-year-old grandson, while workers rushed
to get ready for today's opening.</LD>
<TE>   For the last four years, Eldridge has worked behind the counter at
one of the fair's nearly 300 concessions, Macpherson's ice cream.</TE>
<TE>   "I love watching them set up during the weeks before, watching
this mini-city grow," she said. "When they finally set up the chuck
wagon, you know it's just days away."</TE>
<TE>   When Eldridge isn't scooping ice cream, she visits a different
fair building each day. Her favorite spot is a little hill behind the
Flower and Garden Pavilion, covered with lights after dark.</TE>
<TE>   "It's peaceful and beautiful, and it gives you the feeling that
you're in another land."</TE>
<TE>   Wendy Talarico, spokeswoman for the fair, said the most popular
activities aren't the pig races or even the Spam cook-off, but
shopping and eating.</TE>
<TE>   Deep-fried Snickers bars are new this year and are among the 3,000
food offerings.</TE>
<TE>   Eldridge, in fact, said she and her neighbor "literally eat our
way through the fair.... At the fair, calories don't count."</TE>
<TE>   The advertising campaign for the fair this year targets the idea
of abandonment, or getting "in touch with your inner hick," as one ad
reads.</TE>
<TE>   Fair attendance had stagnated, said Cary Sacks, president of
Ideaology Advertising of Marina del Rey, which has the fair account.
So the agency decided to promote it as an antidote to daily life in
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   They proposed a campaign that would speak to people who are more
likely to assume Holstein is the name of a hot L.A. club than a breed
of dairy cow. Their pitch includes such slogans as "Who needs
anti-depressants when there's corndogs?"</TE>
<TE>   "We've made hay--no pun intended--of the L.A.-isms," said Sacks,
who cites as an example: "Laugh now. Botox out the laugh lines
later."</TE>
<TE>   "The whole notion," Sacks said, "is if there's any place that
could really use a county fair, it's Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   This year's attractions include contests in tortilla tossing,
bubble-gum blowing, butter churning, spaghetti eating and bean
spitting.</TE>
<TE>   For 50 years, visitors have been meeting at the central clock
tower and then spreading out to visit favorite attractions such as
the children's area (called Camp Wilderness), the agricultural
exhibits (Fair View Farms), the carnival midway with a Ferris wheel
taller than the Statue of Liberty, the cooking and crafts building
(Tapestry of Traditions) and the thoroughbred racetrack.</TE>
<TE>   This year, a 40,000-square-foot building has been titled "Lights!
Camera! Science!" and offers more than 100 hands-on activities
related to science and the entertainment industry.</TE>
<TE>   When the fair began in 1922, it was held on 43 acres that had
previously been planted with barley and beets.</TE>
<TE>   That first fair attracted 50,000 people and put broad smiles on
the faces of Pomona hoteliers, who had to post "No Vacancy" signs.
Besides handsome swine and comely poultry, the premier fair had wing
walking and chariot racing.</TE>
<TE>   As the fair grew to cover 487 acres and became more sophisticated,
adding big-name entertainment and other urban amenities, some people
thought it had lost touch with its agrarian roots.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, said Talarico, "we started last year integrating more
agricultural elements into the fair. Last year we planted a peach
orchard and a citrus orchard and something called a Taco Farm. It's
in the shape of a taco, a crescent, and growing there is everything
you find in a taco--tomatoes, lettuce, peppers, corn, and then next
to it are beef and dairy cows."</TE>
<TE>   While this year's fair recalls its rural past, it also reflects
modern realities.</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing bag checks at all the gates," said Talarico. "We have
an increased number of security personnel on the grounds, and we are
doing other things, but we can't really talk about them because that
would jeopardize security."</TE>
<TE>   Another visitor Thursday was Inez Vargas, 58, a nurse who each
year takes blood-pressure readings at the fair as a volunteer.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, we ran into a lot of people who had a terrible
headache and didn't know they had high blood pressure," she said. "We
told them, 'You have to see a doctor immediately.' A lot of them
called us back and said, 'I'm on medication now. Thank you so much.'

<DH>Events: The Fiestas de las Americas, which hopes to attract
250,000, draws from a broader cultural base and now features a
related arts festival.</DH>

<LD>Santa Ana expects more than 250,000 people to attend its fiesta to
commemorate independence for Latin American nations. Organizers hope
the crowd drawn downtown to the weekend-long event will be even more
diverse than last year's.</LD>
<LD>   And for the first time, in an event linked to the Fiestas de las
Americas, artists in the downtown Artists Village, many of whom are
not Latino, will bring their work outdoors and supplement their
displays with music, food and craft booths, said Norma Cunningham,
owner of Cunningham Gallery of Fine Art. Many of the displays will
feature Latino-oriented art, she said.</LD>
<LD>   In the effort to diversify the heavily immigrant crowd usually
drawn to the event, the Downtown Business Assn. handed event
preparation to All Access Entertainment, association President Arturo
Lomeli said. Previously, promoters booked acts, such as regional
Mexican bands, that didn't attract diverse crowds.</LD>
<TE>   Lomeli, a downtown dentist, said he has worked with All Access to
get culturally significant acts at the outdoor fair, including ballet
folklorico and other regional Mexican dancers.</TE>
<TE>   "We are just taking little baby steps in order to attract a wider
variety of people," Lomeli said. "We want people to see more than a
run-of-the-mill norteno band."</TE>
<TE>   The city helped by sending out 9,000 invitations to people who
have visited the Artists Village.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Bellas, All Access vice president of marketing, who also
organizes Fiesta Broadway in Los Angeles for Cinco de Mayo, said the
Santa Ana festivities will include more carnival rides than before,
new acts such as a magic troupe, and singers on the Billboard
magazine charts.</TE>
<TE>   "They want people to get a taste of Latin America, and they want
people to think, 'Hey, this is great, I'm going to come back during
the year,' " Bellas said.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, the annual event, now in its 14th year, was named
Fiestas Patrias to refer to Mexican Independence Day on Sept. 16.
Last year, the event was renamed in consideration of all countries in
the Americas, many of which celebrate their independence in
mid-September, and to honor the United States and victims of the 9/11
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Fiesta events will cover the blocks generally between 1st and 5th
streets and between French Street and Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante will be among those opening the event
this afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Hours for the related Artists Village event are 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Saturday and Sunday.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Accuses Firm's Bosses of Harassing Women Employees</HD>
<DH>Workplace: Touching, propositions were common at Cheap
Tickets' L.A. office, lawsuit alleges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Male supervisors at the Los Angeles office of Cheap Tickets, a
popular travel service, subjected female employees to egregious and
persistent sexual harassment, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission charged in a federal lawsuit Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The alleged harassment included propositions for sexual favors,
unwelcome touching and sexually charged remarks. The class-action
lawsuit also accuses male supervisors of firing a woman who first
complained to the EEOC. About a half-dozen other female workers later
joined in the complaint.</LD>
<LD>   "Employers should understand that they will be held strictly
accountable by the EEOC for allowing male supervisors to use their
positions of power with impunity to sexually harass women," Olophius
Perry, head of the agency's Los Angeles office, said in a statement.</LD>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Cheap Tickets, which is part of Cendant Corp.'s
travel distribution division, said the company had not seen the
lawsuit and had no immediate comment.</TE>
<TE>   "Cheap Tickets is committed to providing a positive work
environment, and we do not tolerate any forms of sexual harassment,"
said Dawn Lyon, the company's representative.</TE>
<TE>   Lyon said Cheap Tickets closed its Los Angeles office last year as
part of a companywide consolidation.</TE>
<TE>   The suit seeks a permanent injunction barring Cheap Tickets from
engaging in sexual discrimination or retaliation against employees
who complain about workplace abuses. It also demands that Cheap
Tickets adopt strict policies to eradicate what the commission
described as a sexually hostile work environment. And the suit calls
for up to $300,000 compensation to each victim.</TE>
<TE>   The EEOC said it filed the lawsuit after exhausting efforts to
reach an out-of-court settlement with the company.</TE>

<HD>Prostitute's HIV-Related Charge Dropped in Plea Bargain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN L. MITCHELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a last-minute plea bargain, prosecutors have dropped charges
against a 46-year-old woman who is HIV-positive and accused of
engaging in prostitution.</LD>
<LD>   Panchita Hall was facing a second trial under a 1988 law that
requires prostitutes who are HIV-positive and who have been informed
of their blood test results to be charged with a felony upon their
second arrest. She has been convicted of prostitution six times since
she learned in 1995 that she is HIV-positive.</LD>
<LD>   Hall was arrested by an undercover officer in April. The jury in
her first trial deadlocked, and an impasse was declared.</LD>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Lori-Ann Jones, who tried the initial case,
said the decision not to seek a second trial was made because "there
was no assurance that another jury was going to reach a guilty
verdict."</TE>
<TE>   Conviction under the 1988 statute carries a three-year sentence,
but Jones had planned to ask for an enhanced sentence of as much as
nine years for Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Hall was sentenced instead Thursday in Compton Superior Court to
four years in prison for violating probation on a previous
prostitution conviction. Jones said that with time served, Hall
probably would be free in a year.</TE>
<TE>   The law was first invoked in Los Angeles County in 1990 against a
male prostitute who was sentenced to two years in state prison. Tens
of thousands of prostitutes have been tested for HIV in the county as
a result of the law. But slightly more than 200 have been convicted
on a felony charge since 1995, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Hall was arrested by officers targeting the Figueroa Street
corridor. She allegedly waved at an officer as he drove into a motel
parking lot. After agreeing on a $10 fee, she was arrested on
suspicion of prostitution, police say.</TE>
<TE>   In late August 2001, after her most recent conviction, Hall had
been put on probation for four years.</TE>
<TE>   Two days before her April arrest, a judge issued an arrest warrant
after she failed to show up for a progress report and left a drug
rehabilitation program without permission.</TE>

<LD>Full containment of the wildfire that has blackened more than 20,000
acres and destroyed or damaged at least 73 buildings in the San
Gabriel Mountains about 15 miles north of Azusa was expected by this
morning, the U.S. Forest Service said.</LD>
<LD>   The fire, which started Sept. 1, apparently was caused by a candle
used in an animal sacrifice ritual beside California 39 in the Rincon
area. The flames spread rapidly north into the mountainous terrain of
the Angeles National Forest.</LD>

<LD>UCLA and the Rand Corp. have agreed to expand and formalize their
health-care partnership.</LD>
<LD>   The 30-year association between the university and Rand, a Santa
Monica-based think tank, has resulted in such research as the largest
study to date of the quality of health care provided to AIDS patients
and a continuing study of the quality of cancer care in the Los
Angeles area.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said the agreement, announced this week, will expand the
ability of UCLA faculty members to take part in research projects at
Rand and commits Rand researchers to broaden their role in UCLA's
health policy training programs.</LD>

<HD>Rose Marie Mendez, 32; Rising Talent in Architecture</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rose Marie Mendez, an award-winning Los Angeles architectural
designer and educator, died of cancer Saturday at her West Hollywood
home. She was 32.</LD>
<LD>   Mendez taught architectural design at Cornell University and the
State University of New York at Buffalo before moving to California
several years ago. More recently she taught at UCLA and at the
Southern California Institute of Architecture, or SCI-Arc, and worked
with the Santa Monica architectural firm Morphosis.</LD>
<LD>   She also collaborated with her husband, Gregory Fischer, at f.m.
Design and was active in the Los Angeles Forum for Architecture and
Urban Design, a nonprofit organization that fosters dialogue about
the city, architecture and urbanism.</LD>
<TE>   In 1997 Mendez and Fischer edged out 300 competitors for the
$4,000 grand prize in an international competition soliciting plans
for the redesign of Union Square, the center of San Francisco's
downtown retail district.</TE>
<TE>   They proposed breaking down the walls that separated the square
from the street and replacing its patchwork of spaces with a single
plane that the prize jury described as "an elegant, unfolding urban
napkin." They envisioned a variety of uses for the square, including
an indoor-outdoor market, bandstand and skating rink.</TE>
<TE>   The design provoked heated public discussion and did not win the
commission. But Mendez and Fischer's models and drawings were
acquired for the permanent collection of the San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art and were exhibited in June 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very powerful project," said Thom Mayne, principal
architect at Morphosis and a member of the San Francisco Prize jury.
"She was one of our future talents. She had the ingredients it takes
to be a really good architect. She had the toughness, the intellect
and the artistic ability."</TE>
<TE>   Mendez helped shape the content of "L.A. Now," a two-volume work
produced by Morphosis in collaboration with Art Center College of
Design in Pasadena that offered proposals for redesigning the city.</TE>
<TE>   Born of Cuban and Dominican parents, Mendez was raised in New
Jersey and educated at Cornell University, where she earned her
bachelor's and master's degrees in architecture.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to her husband, she is survived by her mother, Maria
Bornia-Mendez, and a sister, Ligia Mendez Goodwillie.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service will be held at 6 p.m. Saturday at SPF Gallery,
3384 Robertson Place, Los Angeles. Memorial donations may be sent to
the Rose Mendez Undergraduate Architectural Memorial Scholarship at
Cornell University, Department of Architecture, Art and Planning, 129
Sibley Dome, Ithaca, NY 14853.</TE>

<HD>Missing Carlsbad Student Found Dead; Suicide Suspected</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A college student reported missing last week was found dead Thursday,
an apparent suicide.</LD>
<LD>   Confirmation of Alex Zingaro's death came a day after Carlsbad
police, who were investigating his disappearance, halted their search
and said that Zingaro's parents, who live in Lake Forest, had
withheld information.</LD>
<LD>   Zingaro, 22, was found by hikers about 12:30 p.m. in the forest
outside Fawnskin, a small community near Big Bear, said Linda Myers
of the San Bernardino County coroner's office. She would not divulge
the cause of death, characterizing it only as apparently
self-inflicted.</LD>
<TE>   "Our doctors will be reviewing it to determine the cause," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Zingaro had last been seen Sept. 5 by his roommate in the San
Diego County community of Carlsbad.</TE>
<TE>   After filing a police report that triggered a well-publicized
investigation, his parents had spent the weekend passing out fliers
and distributing pictures in Carlsbad and at nearby Cal State San
Marcos, where he was a junior, majoring in communications.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, police say, the roommate found a note Zingaro had left
in his computer; the roommate shared the message with Zingaro's
parents either that day or the next. "It was basically a private note
from Alex to his parents confirming that he had made a decision to
voluntarily leave the area," said Lt. Jim Byler, a spokesman for the
Carlsbad Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   Byler had been critical of the parents' handling of the matter
before learning of the young man's death. "They didn't bring it to us
and that's the issue," he said of the note. "They [decided] that they
wanted the search to continue. When ... you have relevant
information, you need to bring it to the authorities immediately."</TE>
<TE>   Zingaro's parents denied withholding information, saying that they
didn't see the note until late Tuesday and would have reported it
Wednesday. By then, however, the young man's roommate had told
investigators about the note during an interview.</TE>
<TE>   The parents will not be charged, Byler said, because they were not
aware of the note when they filed the police report and were
apparently acting in good faith. But the department stopped looking
for Zingaro because investigators believed that he had acted freely.</TE>
<TE>   Alex's father Thursday characterized his son's last message as one
that could not necessarily be construed as a suicide note. "It said,
'I'm going to go away and come back,' " Al Zingaro said. "The end of
it did say that he would see us soon." He said that his son did not
seem to be depressed.</TE>
<TE>   Regarding the assertion that the family withheld information, the
father said, "I'm irate. The timing stated [by the police] is way
off."</TE>

<HD>Periscope of German WWII Sub Surfaces</HD>
<DH>San Diego: Found under a former Navy lab, it may be from a
U-boat seized in 1944 and long displayed at a Chicago museum.</DH>

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>From a concrete-lined shaft beneath a demolished building at a Navy
base, construction workers on Thursday carefully removed a
25-foot-long cylinder of metal believed to hold the answer to a small
but enduring mystery of World War II:</LD>
<LD>   Whatever happened to the periscope of Unterseeboot-505, the only
Nazi submarine captured on the high seas?</LD>
<LD>   For nearly half a century, the U-boat has been on display at
Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry. In 1989, the 1,120-ton
submarine was deemed a National Historic Monument. It is second in
popularity only to the museum's simulated underground coal mine.</LD>
<TE>   But curators have long been frustrated in their attempts to
discover the whereabouts of the U-505's navigational periscope, a
slender shaft of metal with optical equipment at either end.</TE>
<TE>   The submarine was captured June 4, 1944, off the West African
coast after a gun battle with a U.S. task force of six ships. The
capture provided a bonanza of information to the U.S. and its allies
about German submarine technology and communication systems.</TE>
<TE>   The sub's periscope disappeared, however, soon after it was towed
to the United States. Official records offered no clue as to its
whereabouts.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't tell you how many phone calls and letters I sent out in
the past 13 years to find our periscope," said Keith Gill, U-505
curator at the Chicago museum. "Then one day I get a call from San
Diego: 'We think we have something here you'd be interested in.' "</TE>
<TE>   The answer to Gill's quest apparently was hidden beneath Building
371 at one of the U.S. Navy's most secret research facilities, the
Arctic Submarine Laboratory.</TE>
<TE>   In a group of nondescript buildings adjacent to the Point Loma
submarine base, civilian and military scientists worked feverishly
during the Cold War to perfect the technology necessary to operate
ballistic-missile submarines beneath the polar ice cap.</TE>
<TE>   The work had a sense of urgency, because the Soviet Union was
thought to have an advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Building 371 contained a 250,000-gallon pool of seawater that
could be chilled to minus-50 degrees Fahrenheit to simulate arctic
conditions.</TE>
<TE>   The periscope allowed scientists in a space beneath the pool to
study the performance of equipment above the waterline and to give
prospective submarine skippers the simulated experience of "breaking
through" the ice.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the technology and expertise that allowed the U.S. to win
the arctic race was perfected at Point Loma. "This is hallowed ground
for arctic submarine research," said Jeffrey A. Fischbeck, the
laboratory's retired director.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers used the German periscope because it was free of
charge, state-of-the-art and met their needs. There are no records to
suggest how the device got to Building 371 or whether anyone knew it
might have belonged to the U-505.</TE>
<TE>   The answers to those questions have apparently gone to the grave
with Waldo K. Lyon, for decades the laboratory's director and a
physicist and submarine innovator of renown.</TE>
<TE>   Lyon's comrades in the submarine service are also renowned for
their strict adherence to a code of secrecy that discourages such
queries.</TE>
<TE>   "We acquired the periscope; let's leave it at that," said Lawrence
Oblinger, 77, who worked at the laboratory from 1965 to 1990, and was
on site Thursday to watch the removal.</TE>
<TE>   With the end of the Cold War, and with changing military
priorities, Building 371 was demolished several months ago and much
of the research has been discontinued. A company hired to clear the
site discovered the shaft and the periscope.</TE>
<TE>   There was talk by some on the contract demolition crew that the
device might fetch a fair price on EBay, where military souvenirs are
hot sellers. But the Navy stepped in and invoked several laws that
give it control over the periscope.</TE>
<TE>   A Navy architectural historian, checking U.S. and German records,
determined that the periscope was either the U-505 periscope or one
so similar that the coincidence was extraordinary.</TE>
<TE>   A call was made to Gill. "We were thrilled, absolutely thrilled,"
he said. Since 1954, more than 23 million visitors have toured the
U-505, and the Chicago museum is in the midst of a fund-raising drive
to upgrade the exhibit.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the 1,000-pound periscope, still in working order,
was loaded on a flatbed truck for the five-day trip to Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a heavy job, but it's a sensitive one," said crane
operator James Fox. "When you're lifting a piece of history, it's
always a sensitive job."</TE>
<TE>   The retired lab director, Fischbeck, suggested that if the
periscope could talk, it could provide answers to yet another
mystery: What made the captain of the U-505 surrender rather than
fight to the death, as the Fuhrer had ordered?</TE>
<TE>   "He probably looked through that periscope," Fischbeck said, "and
saw way too many American forces bearing down on him with airplanes
and ships."</TE>

<DH>Transit: Workers on graveyard shift catch a break with
O.C.'s expanded bus service.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Instead of sleeping at night, driver Robert Bennett now cranks up his
county bus and gets on to Harbor Boulevard at 12:23 to hunt for
graveyard-shift workers who need a ride home.</LD>
<LD>   Bennett, who drives Route 43 from Costa Mesa to Fullerton, scans
bus stops for the janitors, busboys and hotel workers who used to
travel through the sleeping cities by foot or bike.</LD>
<LD>   "Everyone is going to benefit from this bus," says Bennett, a
34-year-old Ontario father of two who figures he will save $800 a
month in child care by working nights. "It helps the graveyard-shift
guys. It helps a bus driver like me who wants hours that give me time
to be with my children."</LD>
<TE>   Bennett found few riders this week because the late-hour service
began only Monday and word has been slow to spread, despite the
Orange County Transportation Authority's multilingual advertising
campaign. Some late-night workers say the four routes running between
midnight and 4 a.m. don't go where they work or live.</TE>
<TE>   Those who caught Route 43 early Wednesday had stories to share
about the challenges of getting around without a car late at night in
a county that bustles with traffic during the day. At 12:40 a.m.,
restaurant cook Pablo Alvarez jumps aboard at Wilson Street in Costa
Mesa, smiling because he won't have to wait nearly two hours for a
ride home from a co-worker.</TE>
<TE>   Five minutes later, chimney factory worker Fabian Sanchez, 26,
hails the bus at Segerstrom Avenue in Santa Ana instead of walking
nearly three miles to get home. After eight hours lifting concrete
blocks, he slips on his headphones and relaxes.</TE>
<TE>   At 1 a.m., Ken Williams, a 20-year-old Santa Ana College student
who spent the night studying and visiting relatives, pays his $1 fare
for a ride to his brother's job, where he expects to get a ride to
his home in Garden Grove.</TE>
<TE>   As the bus rolls through the lighted boulevards of desolate
fast-food joints, car dealerships and office buildings, the riders
agree that the OCTA's Night Owl Service will save them money and
time.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, I'd have to wait until 2 or 3 o'clock to get a ride
home," said Alvarez, 47, who carries an oil-stained bag of fried
shrimp from the restaurant where he works four nights a week at $10
an hour. Alvarez, who lives with his wife in an apartment near
Fairview Street and McFadden Avenue in Santa Ana, said he doesn't
drive because he has had vision problems since he was a boy.</TE>
<TE>   Most nights, Alvarez said, he hitched a ride home with a co-worker
or called his brother for a lift. Alvarez said his brother was
willing to help out but "you don't want to bother people if you don't
have to, particularly at this time of night."</TE>
<TE>   Because the bus closest to his house, Route 47, has stopped
running, Alvarez must walk 20 minutes from the restaurant to the
Route 43 bus after midnight. When he gets off at McFadden Avenue, he
walks one mile home. For the first time, the shrimp arrive warm. Next
week, he plans to use a bicycle to get to and from the bus.</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Leahy, OCTA's chief executive officer, said when he moved
to Orange County in early 2001, he was surprised to see people like
Alvarez walking home late at night and others cycling along
thoroughfares in the predawn hours.</TE>
<TE>   An OCTA study determined that the late-night workers are the same
people who use county buses during the day.</TE>
<TE>   Offering the Night Owl Service seemed like the right thing to do,
said Leahy, who started night bus service when he was the
transportation chief in Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA is not expecting packed buses immediately, said Leahy. In the
first four nights of the extended bus service, several hundred riders
boarded but exact numbers will not be available until October, said
OCTA spokesman George Urch. Leahy said once word gets out, the
late-night service will attract as many as 200,000 riders a year.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Medina, who earns $50 a night working concessions at Anaheim
tourism spots, said she will be among the riders. The single mother
of three, without a car since her Dodge Dart died seven years ago,
said she pays a quarter of her nightly wages to take a taxi home to
Placentia. Now she will spent a dollar taking the Route 57 bus and
connect to Route 50.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many people in my position. I've walked up Harbor
Boulevard and run into all kinds of people walking and biking at
night," said Medina. "The new buses are going to help us all."</TE>
<TE>   Jane Reifer, a member of Transit Advocates of Orange County bus
riders group, believes ridership will grow quickly. "This is going to
allow me a social life," she said. "Instead of spending money on cabs
... I might be able to go to the movies and get home."</TE>
<TE>   Janitor Socorro Murillo said the closest of the night routes would
still leave him with a three-mile walk. But the service is a good
start, Murillo said. "I do think it will help some of the people I
see out on the streets every night."</TE>

<HD>Actor Nick Nolte Is Charged With DUI</HD>
<DH>Crime: He may also face a drug charge in Malibu incident.
Arraignment is scheduled for Oct. 28.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oscar-nominated actor Nick Nolte will be arraigned Oct. 28 on a
misdemeanor charge of driving under the influence after he was
stopped for driving erratically on Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu,
authorities said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Nolte, 61, may also be charged with operating a vehicle under the
influence of drugs, according to California Highway Patrol spokesman
Leland Tang.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities "are evaluating the case to see if they will file an
additional charge of being under the influence of a narcotic," Tang
said. "It could be either the alcohol or drug charge or a combination
of both."</LD>
<TE>   Known for his Academy Award-nominated roles in "Affliction" and
"The Prince of Tides," Nolte was driving south on PCH near Kanan Dume
Road about 12:10 p.m. Wednesday when CHP officers conducting an
unrelated traffic stop noticed the actor's Mercedes-Benz cutting off
other cars, swerving and crossing into a northbound lane, Tang said.</TE>
<TE>   The officers who pulled Nolte over said he appeared to be
disoriented and drooling, with drooping eyes, Tang said.</TE>
<TE>   Nolte failed a field sobriety test, Tang said, although he would
not discuss the actor's blood-alcohol level or what controlled
substance he may have been using at the time of the arrest. Tang
added that no drugs were found on Nolte or in his car.</TE>
<TE>   Nolte was released on $2,500 bail Wednesday night.</TE>

<HD>Error-Prone Team Claimed It Was Distracted by a Woman
Photographer</HD>

<LD>Female sportswriters, as you've probably read, have had problems
gaining admittance to locker rooms of male teams. Well, Helen Brush
Jenkins, a pioneer news photographer at the first (now defunct) L.A.
Daily News, recalls when her appearance on the field became an issue
at a baseball game in the early 1940s.</LD>
<LD>   Jenkins told a meeting of retired L.A. journalists that, when she
was 24, she was assigned to take pictures at a Pacific Coast League
game at Wrigley Field. The one provision from her boss was that she
wear nothing so salacious (at least for those times) as a sweater. As
was the custom with photographers then, she stationed herself near
first base, drawing, she recalls, an admiring comment from a
spectator named Bing Crosby.</LD>
<LD>   But the Los Angeles Angels evidently were not pleased after they
made three errors in the first inning. The next day, she says, her
boss told her the team had called "and said it was hard to play
baseball with this pretty girl running around on the field. He said
to me, 'I thought I told you never to wear a sweater.' I said, 'But I
didn't. I had on a blouse.' "</LD>
<TE>   Speaking of the "Front Page" days: I read in the L.A. Downtown
News that a possible new occupant of the 88-year-old Los Angeles
Herald Examiner building at 11th and Broadway is the YWCA.</TE>
<TE>   Though the hard-drinking, chain-smoking newshounds of the old days
were hardly health faddists, a sports motif would be appropriate in
some ways. In the 1940s and 1950s, the atmosphere inside the building
was akin to that of a track meet at odd moments. That's because City
Editor Agness Underwood kept a starter gun in her desk, and every
once in a while she'd fire a round at the ceiling just to make sure
everyone was awake.</TE>
<TE>   Unclear on the concept: Kevin Kightlinger of Sunset Beach noticed
an ad for an editor in a college newspaper that needed a bit of,
well, editing (see accompanying). Where's that starter pistol?</TE>
<TE>   Don't write off the Poets: I mentioned that Laguna Beach High's
students voted to discard the Artists nickname for their sports teams
and replace it with the more aggressive-sounding Breakers.</TE>
<TE>   But a mild-mannered nickname at another Southland school, the
Poets of Whittier College, is in no danger. To begin with, there is
history: It's a reference to 19th century poet John Greenleaf
Whittier.</TE>
<TE>   The nickname "makes us unique," said Athletic Director Wendell
Jack. "Besides, you have to be tough to call yourself a Poet."</TE>
<TE>   And the mascot is not unarmed (see photo). At a Whittier soccer
game the other night, Jack heard a spectator cry, "The pen is
mightier than the sword."</TE>
<TE>   Thanks for the warning: OK, I couldn't resist the joke after David
Wilkins of Lancaster sent me a shot he took back East of an
automotive garage (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Trials can be painful: "I've had my share of bad cases over the
years," writes attorney Jonathan Colman. "But this is the first time
a judge decided a case was sick" (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: A driver recently stopped for speeding in Paramount
begged the officer not to give him a ticket, explaining that it was
an emergency, reports the city's action-packed newsletter. Asked if
the emergency was life threatening, the driver said, "When my wife
finds out I got a ticket, it will be."</TE>

<HD>Davis Signs Bill on Pesticide Use Near Schools</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: Law allows all chemicals applied within a
quarter mile of a campus to be regulated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two years after students and teachers at a Ventura elementary school
were sickened by a drifting pesticide, Gov. Gray Davis has signed
legislation giving agricultural officials more power to regulate such
applications near schools.</LD>
<LD>   The legislation, introduced by Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth Jackson
(D-Santa Barbara), allows county agricultural commissioners to place
restrictions on the use of all pesticides applied on farms within a
quarter mile of schools.</LD>
<LD>   Currently, only so-called "restricted" pesticides are subject to
such regulation.</LD>
<TE>   "The purpose is to make sure we don't have inadvertent drift
coming onto our schools and making our teachers and children ill,"
said Jackson, flanked Thursday by agricultural officials,
environmental activists and a top Ventura County prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a team effort," Jackson said of the two-year push to get
her bill signed into law. "We all came together to do what was best
for our children."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson announced the governor's signature during a news
conference at Mound Elementary School in east Ventura, where a
pesticide drift occurred in the fall of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The incident prompted Jackson's legislative effort, an endeavor
she said appeared to be on life support at times, but was ultimately
held together by a broad coalition of farming and environmental
interests.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 8, 2000, two students were sent home and dozens of other
students and teachers complained of dizziness and nausea after an
early morning application of the insecticide Lorsban on a 200-acre
lemon orchard across the street from the campus.</TE>
<TE>   Tests later revealed that small amounts of the noxious pesticide
had drifted into the school.</TE>
<TE>   Those results were turned over to Ventura County prosecutors, who
filed a civil lawsuit in May 2001 against rancher Dan Campbell and
his foreman, Raul Adame, for allegedly allowing the pesticide to
drift.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell settled the case in April by agreeing not to spray near
the school while classes are in session and paying $25,000 in
penalties and restitution. The rancher also agreed to notify school
officials at least 72 hours before any scheduled pesticide
application on days that classes are in session.</TE>
<TE>   However, agricultural officials still had a problem. The pesticide
in this case was an unrestricted chemical, meaning other growers
would be able to apply it without having to notify school or farm
officials.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's legislation seeks to solve that problem by allowing
agricultural commissioners, when they deem it necessary, to place
conditions on the use of "nonrestricted" chemicals within a quarter
mile of schools.</TE>
<TE>   It also increases the maximum fine for serious pesticide-related
violations from $1,000 to $5,000 and encourages school districts to
formulate steps to take in the event of pesticide drift.</TE>
<TE>   Agricultural officials say there are about 30 schools adjacent to
farms in Ventura County. Of those, fewer than 10 have been the
subject of problems or complaints related to pesticide use.</TE>
<TE>   "The vast majority of growers in Ventura County are responsible
and very diligent in their practices," said Rex Laird, executive
director of the county's farm bureau. "But as with most laws, this
applies to the 1% who don't seem to get it."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's legislation was supported by a coalition that included
the Environmental Defense Center, which in the past has been at odds
with agricultural officials over the enforcement of pesticide use.</TE>

<HD>Cancer Forces Pohl to Drop Assembly Bid</HD>
<DH>Campaign: Republican challenger to incumbent Hannah-Beth
Jackson vows to beat the disease and one day run for office again.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Republican challenger Bob Pohl withdrew Thursday from his race
against Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara), saying
he needs to dedicate his time to fighting a recently diagnosed case
of lymphatic cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Pohl, 53, an educational consultant and former president of the
Santa Barbara school board, said he found a lump in his thigh three
weeks ago, and doctors confirmed his illness a week later after a
fund-raiser featuring former vice presidential candidate Jack Kemp.</LD>
<LD>   "After a week of intense discussion with my wife, other members of
the family and close friends, I decided to end my campaign ... in
order to fully take care of my health and my family," Pohl said in a
written statement. "My priorities are much different than they were
three weeks ago."</LD>
<TE>   Pohl said that while he will seek a second medical opinion today
from doctors at UCLA Medical Center, he expects to begin treatment
soon to counteract cancer in the lymph glands of his upper thigh.</TE>
<TE>   Pohl said he plans to run again for the 35th Assembly District
seat once he has won his battle with cancer. The seat likely would be
open in 2004, because Jackson will have completed her third term, the
limit for Assembly members, if she defeats two minor party candidates
Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   "I expect that I will not only survive this illness but that I
will emerge from it stronger and a better human being," Pohl wrote.
"This announcement is by no means my exit from the political and
policy arena ... We could have won this baby."</TE>
<TE>   A former school principal, Pohl had raised about $250,000 to
unseat Jackson, and has about $150,000 left for his next race,
campaign spokesman Mike Platt said.</TE>
<TE>   Platt said doctors believe they caught Pohl's lymphoma in its
early stages.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said she had just turned her attention to Pohl's challenge
after a long legislative session.</TE>
<TE>   "I looked at the next six weeks as a sort of run for the roses, so
this news came as a surprise," she said. "My heart goes out to him
and his family, and I pray for his full and complete recovery."</TE>
<TE>   Still challenging Jackson are Ventura physician Cary Savitch of
the Reform Party and Libertarian Craig Thomas, a music instructor
from Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   The 35th Assembly District stretches from northern Santa Barbara
County to Ventura and Oxnard in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   Redistricting last year made it more favorable for Democrats, who
now hold a 44% to 33% advantage over Republicans in registered
voters.</TE>

<HD>Orange Diocese Paid $400,000 in Sex Suit</HD>
<DH>Settlement: The church last month opted not to fight latest
allegations against former Dana Point pastor, conceding misconduct.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange quietly paid $400,000 last month
to settle a lawsuit accusing a priest of having had a lurid sexual
affair with an emotionally troubled woman who had sought counseling
from him.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement was the third payout by church officials to settle
allegations of sexual misconduct by John Lenihan, once the popular
pastor of St. Edward Church in Dana Point. He agreed to leave the
priesthood this spring after Catholic officials paid $1.2 million to
a San Francisco woman who accused Lenihan of impregnating her 20
years ago as a teenager and paying for her abortion.</LD>
<LD>   In a suit filed last month in Orange County Superior Court,
Margaret Cayer, 41, of Laguna Niguel alleged that Lenihan began an
18-month sexual relationship that triggered a deep depression, led to
an addiction to prescription pills and caused heartbreak for her
11-year-old handicapped son, who still prays to Jesus every night for
"Father John" to return.</LD>
<TE>   Given the accusations and previous cases against Lenihan, church
officials settled with Cayer on Aug. 23 rather than take the case to
trial, a diocesan spokeswoman said Thursday. While they disputed some
of Cayer's allegations, they conceded there was priest misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   "He did seriously cross ministerial boundaries," spokeswoman Maria
Schinderle said. "While the relationship was consenting, his past
indiscretions would not help in defense of the suit."</TE>
<TE>   Cayer attorney James P. McDonough said, "Not only children, but
fragile, vulnerable adults can also become victims of the clergy."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Lenihan, 57, nor his attorney could be reached for comment
Thursday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   The Irish-born Lenihan has admitted to only one of the three
accusations: molesting a teenage girl in the 1970s. Lenihan was
ousted from St. Edward last September after admitting, under the
pseudonym of "Father X," to Times columnist Steve Lopez that he had
had "numerous" sexual relationships with consenting women.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County sheriff's deputies are conducting a criminal
investigation to determine whether Lenihan could be prosecuted for
sexual abuse of a minor in the case of the San Francisco woman.</TE>
<TE>   The $400,000 payout, which was not covered by insurance, comes at
a time when the Orange diocese is struggling financially from, among
other causes, a downturn in stock market investment returns.</TE>
<TE>   In Cayer's suit, she alleged that she moved to Orange County in
1999 and went to St. Edward Church "to develop inner strength and
support to deal with the long history of depression and other
psychological and emotional difficulties."</TE>
<TE>   According to the lawsuit, a year later, Lenihan offered to counsel
her and began meeting with her three or four times a week and
telephoning her house regularly. About six months after the
counseling began, Cayer said, Lenihan kissed her.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in shock," she said in an interview Thursday. "My God, I
just kissed a priest. But at the same time, I had mixed feelings
because I really liked him. This powerful man thought I was
attractive."</TE>
<TE>   A sexual relationship with Lenihan continued for about 18 months,
the suit said. They met in hotel rooms, he gave her gifts, they took
nude photos of each other, and they shared intimate nightly phone
calls, according to the suit.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like we were husband and wife," said Cayer, whose husband
had committed suicide in the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   In the suit, Cayer contended she had told at least six diocese
priests about the affair, but that none of the clerics approached
Lenihan or his superiors about his behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Schinderle said the facts about her contact with the priests were
otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   Cayer also named an Orange County doctor in the suit, saying
Lenihan got him to provide her with Prozac, Valium and Xanax to help
her during his time away.</TE>
<TE>   She said he called her, using sexually explicit language, up to
four times a day from Canada, where he had been sent for treatment
last fall, then broke off the relationship without explanation in
December 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Cayer's attorney said the suit will proceed without the diocese
and with Lenihan and the doctor as defendants.</TE>
<TE>   She also said she's angry with church leaders because they had
knowledge of Lenihan's sexual misconduct more than 20 years earlier
but did nothing.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, Lenihan admitted to church officials that he sexually
abused a teenage girl in the 1970s. The church paid $25,000 to Mary
Grant to settle her lawsuit.</TE>

<HD>Papers Filed for Lopez Recall</HD>
<DH>Politics: Activists upset with the Santa Ana Unified
trustee's stance on bilingual education turn in far more than the
needed 8,624 signatures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Organizers of a campaign to oust Santa Ana school board member Nativo
V. Lopez filed nearly 15,000 recall petition signatures with the
Orange County registrar of voters by Thursday's deadline, taking one
more step to a likely showdown early next year over bilingual
education and other issues in the heavily Latino district.</LD>
<LD>   Recall backers need 8,624 valid signatures of registered voters in
the Santa Ana Unified School District, or 15% of the district's
electorate, to force a special election. The registrar must validate
the 14,826 signatures, a process that could take up to 30 days,
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   "We are feeling very confident," said Veronica Gonzalez, 23, a
district parent and one of the 11 people who filed the original
recall petition in March. "It was a lot of work and a lot of
dedication."</LD>
<TE>   If the petition qualifies, the board of trustees must set an
election date for early 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "It is more [signatures] than I expected, but I am not concerned,"
Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is an election, we are going to win."</TE>
<TE>   Recall backers accuse Lopez of promoting bilingual education in
the district in defiance of Proposition 227, passed in 1998, which
required English-immersion instruction except in cases in which
parents waived that requirement.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez, leader of the immigrant advocacy group Hermandad Mexicana
Nacional in Santa Ana, has steadfastly denied undermining the law,
but defended parents' right to choose bilingual education in the
district, where two-thirds of the 62,000 students primarily speak
Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez accused his critics of being on a political witch hunt.</TE>
<TE>   The conflict has heated up in recent weeks with the approach of
the deadline. Signature gatherers clashed with Lopez and his
supporters in the city's parking lots and markets as both sides
traded insults and vied for the attention of voters.</TE>

<LD>Republican challenger Bob Pohl withdrew Thursday from his race
against Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara), saying
he needs to dedicate his time to fighting a recently diagnosed case
of lymphatic cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Pohl, 53, an education consultant and former president of the
Santa Barbara school board, said he found a lump in his thigh three
weeks ago, and doctors confirmed his illness a week later after a
fund-raiser featuring former vice presidential candidate Jack Kemp.</LD>

<LD>Jurors had a lot to consider Thursday as they began deciding whether
convicted murderer Cary Stayner was sane when he killed three
Yosemite Park tourists.</LD>
<LD>   The defense asked them to focus on the criminal, his twisted mind
and his traumatic upbringing. The prosecution told them to look at
the crimes and Stayner's explanation of them.</LD>
<LD>   A Santa Clara County Superior Court jury was left to sort out the
rest, weighing the testimony of two psychiatrists who reached
opposite conclusions about whether Stayner was insane or knew what he
was doing when he killed--and knew it was wrong.</LD>

<LD>A Sept. 11 ceremony was canceled at Sierra College on Wednesday after
a 20-year-old student was spotted with a fake hand grenade.</LD>
<LD>   Two female students reported the incident after they noticed what
they thought was a grenade on the dash of a student's vehicle as he
was parking his car. The male student then put the device into a
backpack and went to class.</LD>
<LD>   A Placer County Sheriff's Department bomb squad destroyed the
backpack and the device, which turned out to be a nonexplosive
military surplus grenade. The student told detectives that the
grenade was a gift for his girlfriend's father.</LD>

<HD>Hahn, Secessionists Clash Over Rent Control</HD>
<DH>Breakup: Mayor says Valley, Hollywood cities would not
protect tenants as well as L.A., stirring a confrontation in Sherman
Oaks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The campaign to break up Los Angeles moved to the streets of a quiet
Sherman Oaks neighborhood Thursday when secessionists noisily
confronted Mayor James K. Hahn and tenants' rights advocates,
accusing them of trying to scare voters over rent control.</LD>
<LD>   Backers of San Fernando Valley and Hollywood cityhood also taunted
the mayor for soliciting $10,000 for his anti-secession drive from
the Entertainment Industry Development Corp. while sitting on the
quasi-public agency's board. "Give the money back!" several people
shouted.</LD>
<LD>   The crowd of about 30 secessionists sought to drown out a news
conference by Hahn and 20 tenant advocates on apartment-lined Noble
Avenue. The mayor and the advocates said voters should not believe
secessionists' pledges that independent Valley and Hollywood cities
would adopt Los Angeles-style rent controls.</LD>
<TE>   "They may tell you that they support tenants' rights, but their
record shows differently," Hahn said. "A pledge is a pledge. People
break pledges all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Rent control is considered a key issue in the campaign because six
in 10 Los Angeles residents are tenants.</TE>
<TE>   Secession backers said last week that 101 of the 111 candidates
for Valley mayor and city council signed a pledge to adopt rent
control if voters approve the breakup measures Nov. 5. Candidates for
a Hollywood city council have said they would also enact rent
control.</TE>
<TE>   But Hahn and the tenant groups said those promises are suspect
because several leaders of the secession movement have opposed rent
control in the past.</TE>
<TE>   "Why would renters trust someone who has this type of track record
to support tenant protections in the future?" asked Larry Gross,
director of the Coalition for Economic Survival.</TE>
<TE>   Gross also questioned whether state law would prevent the
breakaway cities from adopting Los Angeles rent controls.</TE>
<TE>   That drew boos and catcalls from the secessionists, who later said
they were offended that Hahn belittled their pledges.</TE>
<TE>   "The mayor has no confidence in pledges because he does not keep
his pledges," said Mel Wilson, a Valley mayoral candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson contended that Hahn had promised Valley leaders he would
stay neutral on secession, which the mayor denies.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's clash signaled that the secession campaign is heating
up. At one point, a police patrol car moved up the street between the
demonstrators and Hahn. There were no incidents, however.</TE>
<TE>   The secessionists have seized on a criminal investigation of the
EIDC to criticize Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office is looking into the agency's lavish
spending on dinners and travel for its staff members and political
contributions to board members.</TE>
<TE>   Because the city and county formed the EIDC, which collects money
for film permits, the investigation is focusing on whether the
agency's funding is public money, which cannot be used for political
contributions.</TE>
<TE>   In response to a reporter's question, Hahn made his first public
defense of the $10,000 contribution, maintaining the agency is a
private corporation.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point in time, I haven't seen anything improper about
it," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   "We did ask them to help because I have seen them get involved in
other races in the city, but I didn't have any way to influence how
that decision came out," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The EIDC has made contributions to candidates for some years and
there haven't been any questions raised about it," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge), a Valley
mayoral candidate, said Thursday he would increase the police force
in the Valley by 30%, or 500 officers, build two new police stations
and expand community policing.</TE>
<TE>   Richman held a news conference at a site in Mission Hills where
work is beginning on a sixth Valley police station promised by the
city in 1989. "Not only has the city failed the Valley on this police
station, but it has failed us with inadequate numbers of police
officers and rising crime," Richman said.</TE>
<TE>   Richman said the share of the Los Angeles budget a Valley city
would receive for policing would pay for about 2,200 police officers,
whereas 1,650 are now deployed in the region. He said the Valley
Bureau logs the highest number of criminal offenses in the city, but
is patrolled by 1.1 officers per 1,000 residents, about half the
ratio of some other parts of the city.</TE>

<HD>Police Say Dead Suspect Was 'Very Violent' Man</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Authorities on Thursday described a Stanton man who was fatally shot
by police as a violent robber who struck at least nine Little Saigon
locations over the past year.</LD>
<LD>   Police said the 37-year-old man, whose name has not been released,
targeted seniors and Little Saigon businesses that lacked
surveillance cameras.</LD>
<LD>   "He [was] a very violent individual and was listed as armed and
dangerous, for us to approach him with caution," Westminster Police
Lt. Mitch Waller said. "He would often pistol-whip his victims, even
if they cooperated with him."</LD>
<TE>   In the attack Tuesday, police said the man and an accomplice broke
the glass door to the Asian American Senior Center in Westminster,
where a small group of senior citizens gather to play cards.</TE>
<TE>   The men took off their ski masks and then, in Vietnamese, ordered
everyone to get on the floor. One man demanded money and jewelry
while the other pistol-whipped a 57-year-old man and threatened to
kill a woman because she didn't remove her jewelry fast enough.</TE>
<TE>   When the men fled, a witness noted the license plate of the
suspect's car and called police.</TE>
<TE>   Officials conducted surveillance Wednesday at the suspect's
Stanton home and watched two men leave, Waller said.</TE>
<TE>   When police tried to stop them, the man, who had an outstanding
warrant, led police on a 65-mph chase. The pursuit ended about 10
minutes later when the man returned to his home and ran inside. The
man came back outside and ran down an alley, where he fired at police
officers. The officers fired back, killing the man.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities completed a search warrant at the man's home Thursday
and said they found the ski mask and jewelry stolen at the Senior
Center.</TE>

<HD>Toxins Pose Water Risk in Inland Empire</HD>
<DH>Environment: Critics assail San Bernardino County for
burying former manufacturing site polluted with hazardous waste.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State regulators said Thursday that an underground plume of chemicals
is threatening Inland Empire water supplies--and, potentially, future
development--and that San Bernardino County acted like a "common
corporate polluter" by literally burying the problem.</LD>
<LD>   But San Bernardino County spokesman David Wert said the source of
the pollution remains unclear and that it is far too early to blame
the county. He said the county is simply an easy target for critics
because of its size and budget.</LD>
<LD>   According to state officials and the head of a task force
overseeing the pollution problem, San Bernardino County, in an effort
to create a regional landfill, paid $5 million in 1993 to buy a
96-acre plot north of Rialto.</LD>
<TE>   Then, starting in 1999, the county began covering the site with
nearly 6 million cubic yards of soil as much as 100 feet thick.</TE>
<TE>   But the county buried the site, according to state regulators and
critics on the task force, with full knowledge that the land had long
been a receptacle for hazardous waste.</TE>
<TE>   Starting during the Cold War, manufacturers of rockets, missiles
and flares began operating at the site--placed there, in large part,
because they were far enough inland that they couldn't be damaged if
the West Coast came under attack from offshore ships.</TE>
<TE>   Perchlorate Discovered</TE>
<TE>   According to the state and the task force, county documents
indicate that in June 1998, environmental investigators took a soil
sample and discovered high concentrations of perchlorate.</TE>
<TE>   The chemical, often used while making rocket fuel and ammunition,
can cause a number of ailments, particularly thyroid problems,
according to the Environmental Protection Agency.</TE>
<TE>   Pregnant women exposed to the compound are also at risk, according
to the government.</TE>
<TE>   The county's decision to bury the site--when it knew about the
contamination--was reckless, said Barry Groveman, chairman of the
Inland Empire Perchlorate Task Force, which has been investigating
the area for two months.</TE>
<TE>   "These are acts of malfeasance that led to the entombing of this
area," Groveman said. "It's hard to believe, given all the
environmental laws and common sense, that they would have done that.
This is going to have to be studied very carefully."</TE>
<TE>   Groveman and others accused the county of failing to cooperate
with the investigation into the pollution problem surrounding the
landfill--spurning, for example, calls for the county to pay for new
water supplies for surrounding towns whose wells may be contaminated.</TE>
<TE>   "They need to act more like the guardian of the public trust and
less like a common corporate polluter," Groveman said. "This is a
crisis."</TE>
<TE>   Wert said San Bernardino County is "as interested as anyone else
in having clean water and getting to the bottom of this."</TE>
<TE>   "If it turns out the county is in any way responsible, the county
will step up to the plate and do what it has to do to rectify the
problem," he said. "What the county is not going to do is simply hand
over untold sums of taxpayer money to solve the problem. The county
is not going to take the blame for what someone else did."</TE>
<TE>   The plume of perchlorate is believed to have penetrated the
so-called Colton-Rialto Basin, from which several neighboring towns
and agencies draw water that is delivered to area homes.</TE>
<TE>   19 Wells Affected</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the federal government linked perchlorate to
thyroid problems and drastically lowered the threshold for what is
considered a dangerous level of the compound in ground water.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, 19 wells in San Bernardino County have either been
shut down or reduced to limited use.</TE>
<TE>   In one case, 820 parts per billion of perchlorate was found--more
than 200 times the danger threshold, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The closing of wells has led to a host of concerns about
development.</TE>
<TE>   If too much water is off-limits because of the pollution, the
state might step in and impose building moratoriums in area cities.</TE>
<TE>   The cities that rely on that water, including Colton, Fontana and
Rialto, are blue-collar towns that depend largely on new development
for economic growth.</TE>
<TE>   In Colton, three wells have been shut down because of the
pollution, said Eric Fraser, the city's director of water and waste
water.</TE>
<TE>   "Development is tied directly to water supply," Fraser said.
"We're running out of places to drill."</TE>
<TE>   State regulators suspect at least a portion of the contamination
stems from former plants where companies conducted research on rocket
fuel, built flares for pistols and parachutes and conducted other
work for defense contractors.</TE>
<TE>   San Bernardino County believes those companies will ultimately be
responsible for cleaning up the problem, Wert said.</TE>
<TE>   At least one company that once operated on the 96-acre site,
however, could put the county in a financial jam.</TE>
<TE>   That operation, Broco Environmental Inc., eventually moved and
became Denova Environmental Inc.--a hazardous waste facility in
Rialto with such a poor maintenance record that barrels of chemicals
and waste on its lot once spontaneously combusted.</TE>
<TE>   State environmental officials and others continue to clean up the
site where Denova stood.</TE>
<TE>   Because that company is bankrupt, Groveman said, San Bernardino
County may have to assume liability for the pollution.</TE>
<TE>   The state Department of Toxic Substance Control on Monday ordered
San Bernardino County to investigate the site, and a group of
government officials called on the county Thursday to work with the
task force.</TE>
<TE>   "Hiding the facts only serves to lengthen the time it will take to
clean up this mess and the amount of money that will have to be
spent," said Rialto Mayor Grace Vargas. "The last thing our
communities need is to waste time and money uncovering information
that the county should have given us months ago."</TE>

<CX>   Landfill pollution--A story in the California section Friday about
toxins posing a water risk in the Inland Empire should have made it
clear that state environmental regulators were not accusing San
Bernardino County of ignoring toxic chemicals in a landfill. That
accusation, which county officials deny, came from the leader of a
local pollution task force.</CX>

<LD>The Vons grocery store company faces more than $2,000 in criminal
fines after pleading no contest to selling packaged chicken that
weighed less than the labels indicated at two Ventura County stores.
County inspectors found the mislabeled chicken Sept. 25, 2001, at the
Fillmore Vons and Feb. 11 at a Vons in Ventura, said Deputy Dist.
Atty. Karen Wold.</LD>
<LD>   Inspectors found packages of chicken breasts that weighed
one-quarter or one-third less than the labels indicated, Wold said.
The chicken was being sold under the Vons label.</LD>

<HD>Backing on Iraq? Let's Make a Deal</HD>
<DH>Allies: Behind-the-scenes talks get underway to see which
inducements might sway nations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER and GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>After struggling for months to talk other nations into helping oust
Saddam Hussein, President Bush is beginning to use terms they might
find easier to understand: cash, weapons, business deals and favors.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's speech Thursday at the United Nations marked the start of
intense behind-the-scenes negotiations to see what inducements will
help convert countries that so far have been balking, at least
publicly, at joining the anti-Hussein campaign.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. officials expect the Turks to ask for weapons and debt
relief, the Russians and French for access to Iraqi oilfield
business, the Qataris for cash to build an air base, and the
Jordanians for guarantees of oil and trade. Officials expect many
other countries to join the horse trading, and predict that they
won't be shy.</LD>
<TE>   "Countries in the Middle East take the bazaari approach," said
Danielle Pletka, a former Senate aide who now works at the American
Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research. "Once they know we
want to buy ... the sky's the limit."</TE>
<TE>   Said a senior congressional aide, "This is a great time to step
forward and get something you want from the United States."</TE>
<TE>   The administration's initial focus will be on members of the
United Nations Security Council, notably Russia, France and China,
officials say. Their backing will be important soon, as the United
States tries to persuade the council to enforce resolutions demanding
that Iraq abandon its chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
programs.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. officials will also try to persuade many other countries
in the Middle East and farther afield to cooperate with a military
campaign, or at least to temper their opposition.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon still needs to win commitments from countries near
Iraq for use of military bases and overflight rights.</TE>
<TE>   The effort mirrors U.S. coalition-building before the 1991 Persian
Gulf War, and before the U.S. assault last fall on the Taliban regime
in Afghanistan. Yet this job promises to be considerably tougher,
because many nations are skeptical of the need for war, and the
United States doesn't have access to the billions of dollars that
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and others contributed to the 1991 Persian Gulf
War campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "The horse trading will be much more difficult this time,"
predicted Edward S. Walker Jr., a former assistant secretary of State
for the Middle East who is now president of the Middle East
Institute.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of what you've been seeing is people making a public display
of opposition that will increase the price," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Most countries resent any suggestion that their support can be
bought. These countries insist that such deals are needed simply to
reduce the economic costs and political risks of cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   Turkish officials were furious last winter when former Clinton
political guru Dick Morris declared on American TV that the U.S. had
bought their nation's military cooperation over time by pressing for
a generous International Monetary Fund loan program.</TE>
<TE>   "They were outraged," said Bulent Aliriza, a Turkish expert and
former specialist at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies in Washington. "It's precisely the wrong image."</TE>
<TE>   Turkey's strategic location and frequent cooperation have made it
America's most important military partner in the region. The Turks
contend that their participation this time would add a huge burden at
a time when their country is trying to cope with crushing economic
problems. They are also deeply worried that war with Iraq might lead
to an independent Kurdish state that would threaten their own eastern
territory.</TE>
<TE>   Accordingly, they have a long wish list, including advanced
weapons, relief on their $5-billion debt to the U.S. for weapons
purchases, and help from the United States in ensuring that Turkey
continues to receive IMF credits, U.S. officials say. Some Turkish
officials have also pressed the United States to ensure that any
military campaign doesn't take place in the summer, when it could
damage the country's tourist industry.</TE>
<TE>   Turkish officials argue that their country has lost more than $40
billion in revenue by cooperating with the United States during the
Persian Gulf War and the sanctions against Iraq since.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey stepped in under U.S. pressure this year to lead the
international peacekeeping force in Afghanistan. Congress recently
appropriated $228 million to cover Turkey's costs there.</TE>
<TE>   Russia has made little secret of the importance that economics
will have in winning its cooperation. Moscow has told U.S. officials
that it wants any new Baghdad government to honor Iraq's
approximately $8-billion debt to Russia. The Russians also want
assurances that any successor government will allow Russian companies
to keep their large share of the Iraqi oil business, and to get a
piece of the business that develops in the new Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Although State Department officials insist that the U.S.
government has made no commitments, Alexander Vershbow, the U.S.
ambassador to Russia, told reporters this week that Moscow's
investments in Iraq would be "better protected under new leadership."</TE>
<TE>   Russia has yet to receive "a single kopek" of the billions in
debt, he noted.</TE>
<TE>   Another demand may be Washington's silence on Russia's planned
$1-billion nuclear power plant for Iran. After years of complaining
that the project posed a nuclear proliferation threat, the White
House has recently lowered the volume.</TE>
<TE>   Russia's arrangement with the United States could involve an
important non-financial issue: Washington might have signaled that it
will give the Kremlin a free hand against Chechen separatists,
including those taking refuge in U.S.-allied Georgia. Publicly,
however, the State Department told wire services that the U.S. would
oppose unilateral Russian military action inside Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   President Vladimir V. Putin seemed to be preparing fellow Russians
for a reversal of the Kremlin's rejection of military action against
Iraq when he proclaimed that Russia had the right to attack Chechen
bases in Georgia to do its part in the war against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   In France, an official denied that President Jacques Chirac's
government would seek any financial deal as part of an agreement to
join the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "Our focus on Iraq is about disarmament, not about access to
oilfields if there's a new government," the official said. Yet a U.S.
official noted that the French complained often that after the Gulf
War, French companies were not included in the rebuilding of the
Kuwaiti oilfields, as they had been promised. He said American
officials expect to hear from France on this issue before long.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still in the process of establishing positions, before the
French get to their dollar value," the U.S. official said.</TE>
<TE>   It is not clear whether China will ask the United States to
protect its small but growing business stake in Iraq, or provide
other help. China is not expected to directly support a U.S.
campaign; the question is how vocal and obstructive the Communist
nation might be.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange for not loudly opposing U.S. action in Iraq, Beijing
will probably press for satisfaction on its biggest diplomatic
concern: Taiwan. The issue will almost certainly come up during
President Jiang Zemin's visit with Bush in Texas next month. China
has been displeased with what it sees as a tilt toward Taiwan by the
Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, some foreign diplomats and experts see Iraq as the real
reason the U.S. two weeks ago unexpectedly backed Beijing in its
efforts against a separatist group in northwestern China, the East
Turkestan Islamic Movement. After resisting such action, the United
States added the organization to its list of terrorist groups and
backed China in adding the group to the U.N.'s terrorist list.</TE>
<TE>   In the Middle East, Jordan, with a large population of
Palestinians and a border with Iraq, is not expected to play a
visible role in any attack on the Iraqi president. But the United
States is eager to ensure Jordan's long-term stability, and it would
probably take steps to ensure a continued supply of oil and other
goods that the Jordanians now receive from Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The Egyptians, recipients of huge U.S. aid, would likely receive
some additional assistance, even if they are not active participants
in an attack. Syria may use the opportunity to press the United
States for an important non-economic goal--return of the Golan
Heights from Israel, a U.S. official said.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, the ranking Republican on the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he was aware of pressure
from countries such as Russia and France, and urged the White House
to consider such requests.</TE>
<TE>   "My own hope is that we would look at this," Lugar said. "That's
the way the coalition is going to be built."</TE>

<HD>Bush Urges U.N. to Move Against Iraq</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Calling Hussein 'a threat to peace,' the
president asks for enforcement of 1990s resolutions. He warns that
the U.S. will act alone if necessary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>President Bush took to the world stage Thursday, challenging the
United Nations to join the U.S. in a drive to oust Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein--and warned that America will go it alone if
necessary.</LD>
<LD>   "Iraq has answered a decade of U.N. demands with a decade of
defiance," he said in his address before the General Assembly. "All
the world now faces a test, and the United Nations a difficult and
defining moment."</LD>
<LD>   Calling Hussein "a threat to the authority of the United Nations
and a threat to peace," Bush warned that unless the U.N. enforces its
many resolutions concerning Iraq, "action will be unavoidable."</LD>
<TE>   By urging the U.N. to join in action against Hussein's regime,
Bush appeared to be heeding, for now, the calls from many U.S. allies
and foreign leaders that his administration work with the world body
in a confrontation with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Moments before he spoke, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
forcefully made that point again, telling the president and the other
gathered world leaders that any response to Hussein's regime should
first have the approval of the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush left little doubt that his ultimate aim of effecting a
"regime change"--though he was careful not to use the
phrase--remained unaltered. If Hussein is left unchecked, the
president predicted, "the attacks of Sept. 11 would be a prelude to
far greater horrors."</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot stand by and do nothing while dangers gather," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's address, coming only a day after he led the nation's
commemoration of last year's terrorist attacks, marked a new phase of
the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the conflicting messages of a president seeking
international support and involvement while also articulating
possible unilateral action, a senior administration official said
Bush "is always going to reserve his options, as president of the
United States, to act on behalf of the interests of the United
States."</TE>
<TE>   It was Bush's first address to the U.N. since November, when he
appeared as the leader of a nation victimized by terrorism and
calling on leaders to back a war against the Al Qaeda terrorist
network and the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the assembled delegates listened attentively to Bush
but showed little outward reaction. Their most enthusiastic applause
came when the president announced early on that the U.S. would rejoin
UNESCO, which it quit 18 years over the agency's perceived
anti-American attitudes.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders were equally cautious after the address, welcoming Bush's
talk of working with the U.N. but warning against a rush to war.</TE>
<TE>   "The choice for us is not between action or inaction, but rather
knowing how to act," French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin
said.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi Ambassador Mohammed Douri, who sat passively during the
address, said later, "I would have been pleased if the U.S. president
would have talked about his true motives behind his speech--revenge,
oil, political ambitions and also the security of Israel, and
targeting every independent state that would refuse to adhere to the
American policy."</TE>
<TE>   To accompany Bush's speech, the administration released a 21-page
"white paper" listing Iraqi violations of U.N. resolutions. The paper
provided allegations dating back to the 1980s, but it was cautious
and vague in its discussion of recent intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   In the 25-minute address that exceeded his allotted 15 minutes,
Bush methodically made his case against Hussein's regime, describing
it as "a grave and gathering danger."</TE>
<TE>   To underscore Bush's growing sense of urgency, a top White House
official said after the address that Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell would consult here today with more than a dozen foreign
leaders about "moving forward" against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's courtship of the world body is noteworthy because he has
been widely criticized as a leader inclined to act unilaterally on
international issues.</TE>
<TE>   One U.S. ally after another in recent weeks has expressed
reservations about a war to unseat Hussein, fearful that such action
could destabilize the Middle East and disrupt the U.S.-declared war
on terrorism. Their concerns, however, have not dissuaded Bush from
his intentions; the president took the opportunity Thursday to
strongly make his case to the U.N. for action against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, lawmakers of both parties had urged him to do so,
and many on Thursday hailed the president's appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) called it "a strong
speech" and predicted that it would help the president build an
international coalition against Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   "That international support, I think, is a critical element to our
overall prospects for success," Daschle said.</TE>
<TE>   But Daschle rejected a plea from the Bush administration for a
quick congressional vote to support possible action against Iraq,
saying that too many diplomatic and military questions remained
unanswered.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans, led by Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott of
Mississippi and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, said a speedy
congressional show of support would strengthen the president's
standing as he seeks to build an anti-Iraq coalition.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also won words of support from former President Clinton.
During a chance meeting with reporters in midtown Manhattan, Clinton
said he didn't hear Bush's speech, but added, "I think going to the
U.N. was a good thing."</TE>
<TE>   In exhorting the world community to act in concert, Bush suggested
that the U.N.'s credibility and effectiveness were on the line.</TE>
<TE>   Underscoring his intention to act--unilaterally if necessary--Bush
told the General Assembly:</TE>
<TE>   "The United States will make that stand. And, delegates to the
United Nations, you have the power to make that stand as well."</TE>
<TE>   At one point, the president struck an unexpectedly personal note
as he made his case against Iraq, reminding delegates that Hussein
had been accused in the past of trying to assassinate not only the
emir of Kuwait but also "a former American president"--Bush's father.</TE>
<TE>   Although it was the president's most detailed and impassioned
argument for action against Baghdad, he did not lay out a specific
timeline or recommend specific actions by the world body.</TE>
<TE>   A senior administration official told reporters afterward that
Bush hopes the Security Council now will determine a course of
action.</TE>
<TE>   "We're open to all kinds of ideas," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   In his address, Bush focused in some detail on resolutions passed
by the council since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 that require the
Hussein regime to destroy any weapons of mass destruction and allow
weapons inspectors into the country.</TE>
<TE>   "As we meet today, it's been almost four years since the last U.N.
inspectors set foot in Iraq--four years for the Iraqi regime to plan
and to build and to test behind the cloak of secrecy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush insisted that Iraq must comply as well with the full panoply
of other Security Council resolutions.</TE>
<TE>   Those measures, for instance, demand that Iraq stop repressing
minorities and political dissidents and renounce terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Two other resolutions in 1991 demanded that Iraq return all
prisoners from Kuwait and other countries in the region, but Hussein
has not done so, Bush said. That refusal leaves unaccounted for
citizens from Saudi Arabia, Syria, Lebanon, Iran, Egypt, Bahrain and
Oman. "One American pilot is among them," the president added,
apparently referring to Navy Capt. Michael Scott Speicher.</TE>
<TE>   Since agreeing to all such demands--as a condition for the
cease-fire ending the 1991 Persian Gulf War, during which a U.S.-led
coalition drove Iraqi forces out of Kuwait--Hussein has violated
every such commitment, Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   "By breaking every pledge--by his deceptions and by his
cruelties--Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself," Bush
said.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the scenes, the Bush administration is working on a
timetable for action, beginning perhaps with a U.N. resolution that
would both toughen the terms of and accelerate efforts to assure that
Iraq has no chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials would like the Security Council to adopt a
resolution that, within a matter of weeks, would pave the way for
weapons inspectors to return to the country.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't really believe that there needs to be much more time
before the U.N. Security Council acts," a senior administration
official said.</TE>
<TE>   The president said his "greatest fear" is that Hussein would
acquire the capability to manufacture a nuclear weapon--and then use
it or make it available to terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Unmistakably referring to Iraq, Bush added, "In one place--in one
regime--we find all these dangers, in their most lethal and
aggressive forms, exactly the kind of aggressive threat the United
Nations was born to confront."</TE>
<TE>   Had it not been for the Gulf War, the president said, Iraq "would
likely have possessed a nuclear weapon no later than 1993."</TE>
<TE>   The president also took note of U.S. reports that Hussein's regime
has recently sought to acquire nuclear technology and said that if
Iraq were to succeed, it "would be able to build a nuclear weapon
within a year."</TE>
<TE>   "The first time we may be completely certain he has nuclear
weapons is when, God forbids, he uses one," he said. "We owe it to
all our citizens to do everything in our power to prevent that day
from coming."</TE>
<TE>   He also gently tweaked the U.N. by evoking memories of a feckless
League of Nations.</TE>
<TE>   "We created the United Nations Security Council so that, unlike
the League of Nations, our deliberations would be more than talk, our
resolutions would be more than wishes," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   "What he came here to do was to challenge the United Nations to
not be irrelevant," a senior administration official said.</TE>

<LD>The text of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's speech Thursday to
the General Assembly, as released by the United Nations and provided
by Associated Press:</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Mr. President, distinguished heads of state and government,
excellencies, ladies and gentlemen: We cannot begin today without
reflecting on yesterday's anniversary and on the criminal challenge
so brutally thrown in our faces on 11 September, 2001.</LD>
<TE>   The terrorist attacks of that day were not an isolated event. They
were an extreme example of a global scourge, which requires a broad,
sustained and global response.</TE>
<TE>   Broad, because terrorism can be defeated only if all nations unite
against it. Sustained, because the battle against terrorism will not
be won easily, or overnight. It requires patience and persistence.</TE>
<TE>   And global, because terrorism is a widespread and complex
phenomenon, with many deep roots and exacerbating factors.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. President, I believe that such a response can only succeed if
we make full use of multilateral institutions.</TE>
<TE>   I stand before you today as a multilateralist by precedent, by
principle, by charter and by duty.</TE>
<TE>   I also believe that every government that is committed to the rule
of law at home must be committed also to the rule of law abroad. And
all states have a clear interest, as well as clear responsibility, to
uphold international law and maintain international order.</TE>
<TE>   Our founding fathers, the statesmen of 1945, had learned that
lesson from the bitter experience of two world wars and a Great
Depression. They recognized that international security is not a
zero-sum game. Peace, security and freedom are not finite commodities
like land, oil or gold which one state can acquire at another's
expense. On the contrary, the more peace, security and freedom any
one state has, the more its neighbors are likely to have.</TE>
<TE>   And they recognized that by agreeing to exercise sovereignty
together, they could gain a hold over problems that would defeat any
one of them acting separately.</TE>
<TE>   If those lessons were clear in 1945, should they not be much more
so today, in the age of globalization?</TE>
<TE>   On almost no item on our agenda does anyone seriously contend that
each nation can fend for itself. Even the most powerful countries
know that they need to work with others, in multilateral
institutions, to achieve their aims.</TE>
<TE>   Only by multilateral action can we ensure that open markets offer
benefits and opportunities to all.</TE>
<TE>   Only by multilateral action can we give people in the least
developed countries the chance to escape the ugly misery of poverty,
ignorance and disease.</TE>
<TE>   Only by multilateral action can we protect ourselves from acid
rain, or global warming, from the spread of HIV/AIDS, the illicit
trade in drugs, or the odious traffic in human beings.</TE>
<TE>   That applies even more to the prevention of terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Individual states may defend themselves by striking back at
terrorist groups and at the countries that harbor or support them.
But only concerted vigilance and cooperation among all states, with
constant systematic exchange of information, offers any real hope of
denying the terrorists their opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   On all these matters, for any one state, large or small, choosing
to follow or reject the multilateral path must not be a simple matter
of political convenience. It has consequences far beyond the
immediate context.</TE>
<TE>   When countries work together in multilateral institutions
developing, respecting and, when necessary, enforcing international
law, they also develop mutual trust and more effective cooperation on
other issues.</TE>
<TE>   The more a country makes use of multilateral institutions, thereby
respecting shared values and accepting the obligations and restraints
inherent in those values, the more others will trust and respect it
and the stronger its chance to exercise true leadership.</TE>
<TE>   And among multilateral institutions, this universal organization
has a special place.</TE>
<TE>   Any state, if attacked, retains the inherent right of self-defense
under Article 51 of the charter. But beyond that, when states decide
to use force to deal with broader threats to international peace and
security, there is no substitute for the unique legitimacy provided
by the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   Member states attach importance, great importance in fact, to such
legitimacy and to the international rule of law. They have shown,
notably in the action to liberate Kuwait 12 years ago, that they are
willing to take actions under the authority of the Security Council,
which they would not be willing to take without it.</TE>
<TE>   The existence of an effective international security system
depends on the council's authority and therefore on the council
having the political will to act, even in the most difficult cases,
when agreement seems elusive at the outset. The primary criterion for
putting an issue on the council's agenda should not be the
receptiveness of the parties but the existence of a grave threat to
world peace.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. President, let me now turn to four current threats to world
peace, where true leadership and effective action are badly needed.</TE>
<TE>   First, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, many of us have been struggling to reconcile Israel's
legitimate security concerns with Palestinian humanitarian needs.</TE>
<TE>   But these limited objectives cannot be achieved in isolation from
the wider political context. We must return to the search for a just
and comprehensive solution, which alone can bring security and
prosperity to both peoples, and indeed to the whole region.</TE>
<TE>   The ultimate shape of a Middle East peace settlement is well
known. It was defined long ago in Security Council Resolutions 242
and 338, and its Israeli-Palestinian components were spelled out even
more clearly in Resolution 1397: land for peace; end to terror and to
occupation; two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side
within secure and recognized borders.</TE>
<TE>   Both parties accept this vision. But we can reach it only if we
move rapidly and in parallel on all fronts. The so-called sequential
approach has failed.</TE>
<TE>   As we agreed at the Quartet meeting in Washington last May, an
international peace conference is needed without delay to set out a
road map of parallel steps: steps to strengthen Israel's security,
steps to strengthen Palestinian economic and political institutions
and steps to settle the details of the final peace agreement.
Meanwhile, humanitarian steps to relieve Palestinian suffering must
be intensified. The need is urgent.</TE>
<TE>   Second, the leadership of Iraq continues to defy mandatory
resolutions adopted by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the
charter. I have engaged Iraq in an in-depth discussion on a range of
issues, including the need for arms inspectors to return, in
accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions. Efforts to
obtain Iraq's compliance with the council's resolutions must
continue. I appeal to all those who have influence with Iraq's
leaders to impress on them the vital importance of accepting the
weapons inspections. This is the indispensable first step towards
assuring the world that all Iraq's weapons of mass destruction have
indeed been eliminated and, let me stress, towards the suspension and
eventual ending of the sanctions that are causing so many hardships
for the Iraqi people.</TE>
<TE>   I urge Iraq to comply with its obligations for the sake of its own
people and for the sake of world order. If Iraq's defiance continues,
the Security Council must face its responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   Third, permit me to press all of you, as leaders of the
international community, to maintain your commitment to Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   I know I speak for all in welcoming President [Hamid] Karzai to
this [General] Assembly and congratulating him on his escape from
last week's vicious assassination attempt--a graphic reminder of how
hard it is to uproot the remnants of terrorism in any country where
it has taken root. It was the international community's shameful
neglect of Afghanistan in the 1990s that allowed the country to slide
into chaos, providing a fertile breeding ground for Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Afghanistan urgently needs help in two areas.</TE>
<TE>   The government must be helped to extend its authority throughout
the country. Without this, all else may fail. And donors must follow
through on their commitments to help with rehabilitation,
reconstruction and development. Otherwise, the Afghan people will
lose hope, and desperation, we know, breeds violence.</TE>
<TE>   And finally, in South Asia, the world has recently come closer
than for many years past to a direct conflict between two countries
with nuclear capability. The situation may now have calmed a little,
but it remains perilous. The underlying cause must be addressed. If a
fresh crisis erupts, the international community might have a role to
play--though I gladly acknowledge and, indeed, strongly welcome the
efforts made by well-placed member states to help the two leaders
find a solution.</TE>
<TE>   Excellencies, let me conclude by reminding you of your pledge two
years ago, at the Millennium Summit, "to make the United Nations a
more effective instrument" in the service of the people of the world.</TE>
<TE>   Today I ask all of you to honor that pledge.</TE>
<TE>   Let us all recognize, from now on in each capital, in every
nation, large and small, that the global interest is our national
interest.</TE>
<TE>   Thank you very much.</TE>

<HD>Bush Veers From Unilateral Course With Appeal to U.N.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT and DOYLE McMANUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>For most of his presidency, George W. Bush has often been willing to
go it alone on global issues, earning a reputation even among allies
as something of a diplomatic cowboy.</LD>
<LD>   But at the United Nations on Thursday, the president reversed
course, tactically at least. He reached out to the world and
encouraged the Security Council to play a central role in confronting
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein over a decade of defiance--not only on
weapons of mass destruction.</LD>
<LD>   The overture shifted the parameters of the Iraq debate in process
and substance: Until now, the president has borne the burden of
justifying military action against the Iraqi dictator. Now, the onus
is shifting to other U.N. members to defend their failure to force
Hussein to comply with a host of existing Security Council
resolutions.</LD>
<TE>   The issue is no longer only Iraq's future, Bush asserted, but the
future of the most powerful global institution.</TE>
<TE>   "All the world now faces a test and the United Nations a difficult
and defining moment," he told the General Assembly opening session.
"Are Security Council resolutions to be honored and enforced or cast
aside without consequence? Will the United Nations serve the purpose
of its founding or will it be irrelevant?" The new U.S. approach also
increases the pressure on Hussein by expanding the focus from
disarmament to several broad areas of violations by Baghdad. The
agenda now includes everything from Iraq's repressive political
system to its gross human rights abuses, from its oil smuggling
operations in violation of U.N. economic sanctions to its failure to
return people from 10 nations, including one U.S. pilot, unaccounted
for since the 1991 Persian Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   "By citing a litany of all resolutions that Iraq had violated, he
raised the bar considerably--both for the United Nations and Iraq,"
said Henri J. Barkey, a former State Department Iraq expert and now
chairman of the international relations department at Lehigh
University.</TE>
<TE>   "He made it harder for the United Nations not to act and almost
impossible for Saddam Hussein to comply. He really upped the ante."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's decision--based on advice from Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell and others in the administration about the perils of taking on
Hussein alone--reshaped the debate over Iraq. And judging from the
first reactions, he made some headway both at home and abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Among key Muslim countries, senior officials attending the U.N.
session expressed relief at the speech and the signs that Washington
is willing to consult before taking action.</TE>
<TE>   Other allies noted that Bush did not mention "regime change," the
administration's term for overthrowing Hussein, but instead called
for "liberty for the Iraqi people," a goal more salable for European
and Islamic governments.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still in a wait-and-see mode, but he talked about many of
the issues we care about. It could have been much worse," said a
senior official from a Middle Eastern country deeply involved in the
Iraq issue that had opposed U.S. military action.</TE>
<TE>   At home, Democratic critics found much to praise. "The man did a
brilliant job today," said an effusive Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr.
(D-Del.), chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "It represents a significant shift by the administration," added
Lee H. Hamilton, a former chairman of the House International
Relations Committee who now heads the Woodrow Wilson International
Center, a Washington think tank. "In August, Vice President Cheney
seemed to be rejecting diplomacy and declaring full speed ahead
toward war. Now there's been a step back from war, and a step toward
diplomacy."</TE>
<TE>   As if to prove the good U.S. intentions, the president announced
that the United States will rejoin a popular U.N. organization it
withdrew from in 1984, during the Reagan administration, charging
mismanagement and politicization. Bush said Washington will now
"participate fully" in UNESCO--a move that scored points in the
General Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the president's newfound regard for the U.N. may prove to be
more of a short-term gambit than a fundamental conversion. Bush
warned that if the U.N. fails to act against Iraq, the United States
still reserves the right to act alone.</TE>
<TE>   "We must stand up for our security and for the permanent rights
and hopes of mankind. By heritage and by choice, the United States of
America will make that stand," he said in closing his speech.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also set a deliberately high barrier for Hussein to clear if
he hopes to avoid a war. Indeed, asked whether the administration
believes Hussein might surprise the world and comply, a senior
official replied crisply: "No."</TE>
<TE>   Thus Bush appears to have accomplished two aims in his first round
of autumn diplomacy on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   In the short run, officials and scholars said, Bush appears likely
to achieve his goal of a new Security Council resolution demanding
that Hussein admit U.N. weapons inspectors to Iraq with no
restrictions on their movements. Washington now hopes that the next
two stages--a new U.N. resolution and the dispatch of weapons
inspectors--will be complete within the next six weeks, according to
State Department officials.</TE>
<TE>   But if Hussein refuses to admit the inspectors, or admits the
inspectors but refuses them free access to top-secret weapons
facilities, the crisis may come abruptly to a head, setting up a
confrontation with the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to deny, delay, challenge the mission, challenge the
composition of the [inspection] team," said Judith Yaphe, an Iraq
expert at National Defense University in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see them letting someone in. If they did, they would
minimize their capacity to go anywhere. And when they do that, you
have your breach of compliance--your casus belli that justifies
military action."</TE>
<TE>   And at that point, U.S. officials hope, international support for
military action against Iraq will be considerably greater than today.</TE>

<HD>Iraq Denounces Bush's 'Evil Whims' for War</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>Iraqi state television said Thursday night that President Bush's
speech to the United Nations exposed "evil whims to ignite a war" and
that Iraq will mount a "fierce and merciless fight against those who
would dare to infringe on its security."</LD>
<LD>   There was little immediate public reaction to Bush's speech among
most ordinary Iraqis because it was not broadcast on Iraqi television
or radio. The 9 p.m. television news, which aired about two hours
after Bush finished speaking, made no mention of his address. Later,
however, the station delivered a brief commentary.</LD>
<LD>   "Regardless of the prattles delivered by Bush during his ignorant
speech to the General Assembly, we say that Bush's evil whims to
ignite a war under the pretext of combating terrorism reflect his
irresponsible attitude to humanity," the statement said. It warned
that any U.S. attack on Iraq would "lead the Mideast region into a
state of turmoil and the United States will pay a high price because
Iraq is not an easy prey."</LD>
<TE>   Satellite dishes that receive signals from CNN, the BBC and
Arabic-language news station Al Jazeera are illegal here. Many
educated Iraqis often follow world events by furtively listening to
shortwave radios.</TE>
<TE>   An Iraqi businessman who heard the speech on his small shortwave
called Bush's comments "American bullying."</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like he is saying, 'We are going to attack you,' " said
the man, who did not want his name or other identifying details
printed out of concern about government retribution. "We would like
to have changes in our system for sure. But we don't want America to
invade us and impose a government on us."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. arguments that Iraq's alleged chemical and biological weapons
could pose a threat to the United States are laughed off by many
people here. "We do not have missiles that can travel for 7,000
miles," the businessman said. "It's hard for us to understand what
America is so worried about. To us, it just looks like they want to
control us and our oil."</TE>
<TE>   Saad Qassem Hammoudi, a senior official in Iraq's ruling Baath
party, dismissed Bush's allegations as falsehoods.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a collection of lies which aim at blackmailing public
opinion in order to commit new American aggression against Iraq," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   And Adil Badawi, a physician, said: "Oh my God, Bush, what do you
want? Are you crazy? What are you saying? Iraq is the enemy of the
world? America is the enemy of the world." It was not clear whether
Badawi had heard the speech or was commenting after hearing the Iraqi
media report of Bush's remarks.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq asserts that all of its chemical and biological weapons have
been destroyed and that its nuclear program is inactive.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. inspectors left Iraq in 1998 after they were refused
permission to search certain sites for evidence of weapons of mass
destruction. Iraqi officials, who contend that the inspectors were
working as spies, have forbidden them to return.</TE>
<TE>   But a British academic said Thursday that he was told by Deputy
Prime Minister Tarik Aziz in a 90-minute meeting Wednesday night that
the Iraqi government is formulating an offer to the United Nations to
permit the inspectors to come back.</TE>
<TE>   In return, Aziz said, Iraq would like diplomats from Canada and
South Africa to serve as independent arbiters of disputes between
Iraq and the U.N. inspection commission, said the academic, Toby
Dodge, a research fellow at the Royal Institute of International
Affairs in London.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi officials could not be reached Thursday night to comment on
Dodge's account. U.S. and U.N. officials have said inspectors must
return to Iraq without any conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile Thursday, a U.S. congressman skeptical of the need for
military action against Iraq was en route to Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Nick J. Rahall II (D-W.Va.), who was to arrive in the capital
today, said he wants to reassure Iraqi citizens that Americans are
"not out to wage war for war's sake."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going as a secretary of State," he said this week. "I'm
not going as a weapons inspector. And I'm not calling upon this
administration to do one thing or another. I just have a lot of
questions."</TE>
<TE>   Rahall said he would urge Iraq to allow in U.N. weapons
inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   Among those accompanying Rahall is former Sen. James Abourezk
(D-S.D.).</TE>

<LD>The Air Force will recommend criminal charges against two Illinois
Air National Guard pilots who mistakenly bombed Canadian troops in
Afghanistan in April, killing four, U.S. officials said Thursday.</LD>

anonymity, said the Air Force would recommend that Maj. Harry Schmidt
be charged with involuntary manslaughter and failure to exercise
appropriate flight discipline.</LD>

<LD>   "We are as grieved and saddened by the martyrdom of people in the
Kabul explosion as we were by the martyrdom of thousands of our

the Pushtun warlord said in a recorded message provided to the

<LD>The text of President Bush's speech to the United Nations on
Thursday, as released by the White House and provided by Associated
Press:</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Mr. Secretary-General, Mr. President, distinguished delegates, and
ladies and gentlemen: We meet one year and one day after a terrorist
attack brought grief to my country, and to the citizens of many
countries. Yesterday, we remembered the innocent lives taken that
terrible morning. Today, we turn to the urgent duty of protecting
other lives, without illusion and without fear.</LD>
<TE>   We have accomplished much in the last year -- in Afghanistan and
beyond. We have much yet to do -- in Afghanistan and beyond. Many
nations represented here have joined in the fight against global
terror -- and the people of the United States are grateful.</TE>
<TE>   The United Nations was born in the hope that survived a world war
-- the hope of a world moving toward justice, escaping old patterns
of conflict and fear. The founding members resolved that the peace of
the world must never again be destroyed by the will and wickedness of
any man. We created a United Nations Security Council, so that,
unlike the League of Nations, our deliberations would be more than
talk, our resolutions would be more than wishes. After generations of
deceitful dictators, broken treaties and squandered lives, we
dedicate ourselves to standards of human dignity shared by all, and
to a system of security defended by all.</TE>
<TE>   Today, these standards, and this security, are challenged.</TE>
<TE>   Our commitment to human dignity is challenged by persistent
poverty and raging disease. The suffering is great, and our
responsibilities are clear. The United States is joining with the
world to supply aid where it reaches people and lift up lives -- to
extend trade and the prosperity it brings -- and to bring medical
care where it is desperately needed.</TE>
<TE>   United States to Rejoin UNESCO</TE>
<TE>   As a symbol of our commitment to human dignity, the United States
will return to UNESCO. This organization has been reformed, and
America will participate fully in its mission to advance human
rights, tolerance and learning.</TE>
<TE>   Our common security is challenged by regional conflicts -- ethnic
and religious strife that is ancient but not inevitable. In the
Middle East, there can be no peace for either side without freedom
for both sides. America stands committed to an independent and
democratic Palestine, living beside Israel in peace and security.
Like all other people, Palestinians deserve a government that serves
their interests and listens to their voices. My nation will continue
to encourage all parties to step up to their responsibilities as we
seek a just and comprehensive settlement to the conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, our principles and our security are challenged today by
outlaw groups and regimes that accept no law of morality and have no
limit to their violent ambitions. In the attacks on America a year
ago, we saw the destructive intentions of our enemies. This threat
hides within many nations, including my own. In cells and camps,
terrorists are plotting further destruction and building new bases
for their war against civilization. And our greatest fear is that
terrorists will find a shortcut to their mad ambitions when an outlaw
regime supplies them with the technologies to kill on a massive
scale.</TE>
<TE>   In one place -- in one regime -- we find all these dangers, in
their most lethal and aggressive forms, exactly the kind of
aggressive threat the United Nations was born to confront.</TE>
<TE>   Putting a Stop to Hussein's Aggression</TE>
<TE>   Twelve years ago, Iraq invaded Kuwait without provocation. And the
regime's forces were poised to continue their march to seize other
countries and their resources. Had Saddam Hussein been appeased
instead of stopped, he would have endangered the peace and stability
of the world. Yet this aggression was stopped -- by the might of
coalition forces, and the will of the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   To suspend hostilities and to spare himself, Iraq's dictator
accepted a series of commitments. The terms were clear -- to him and
to all. And he agreed to prove he is complying with every one of
those obligations.</TE>
<TE>   He has proven instead only his contempt for the United Nations and
for all his pledges. By breaking every pledge -- by his deceptions
and by his cruelties -- Saddam Hussein has made the case against
himself.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, Security Council Resolution 688 demanded that the Iraqi
regime cease at once the repression of its own people, including the
systematic repression of minorities -- which, the council said,
"[threatens] international peace and security in the region."</TE>
<TE>   This demand goes ignored. Last year, the U.N. Commission on Human
Rights found that Iraq continues to commit "extremely grave
violations" of human rights and that the regime's repression is
"all-pervasive." Tens of thousands of political opponents and
ordinary citizens have been subjected to arbitrary arrest and
imprisonment, summary execution, and torture by beating, burning,
electric shock, starvation, mutilation and rape. Wives are tortured
in front of their husbands, children in the presence of their parents
-- all of these horrors concealed from the world by the apparatus of
a totalitarian state.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, the U.N. Security Council, through Resolutions 686 and
687, demanded that Iraq return all prisoners from Kuwait and other
lands. Iraq's regime agreed. It broke its promise. Last year, the
secretary-general's high-level coordinator of this issue reported
that Kuwaiti, Saudi, Indian, Syrian, Lebanese, Iranian, Egyptian,
Bahraini and Omani nationals remain unaccounted for -- more than 600
people. One American pilot is among them.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, the U.N. Security Council, through Resolution 687,
demanded that Iraq renounce all involvement with terrorism, and
permit no terrorist organizations to operate in Iraq. Iraq's regime
agreed. It broke its promise. In violation of Security Council
Resolution 1373, Iraq continues to shelter and support terrorist
organizations that direct violence against Iran, Israel and Western
governments. Iraqi dissidents abroad are targeted for murder. In
1993, Iraq attempted to assassinate the emir of Kuwait and a former
American president. Iraq's government openly praised the attacks of
Sept. 11. And Al Qaeda terrorists escaped from Afghanistan are known
to be in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, the Iraqi regime agreed to destroy and stop developing
all weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles, and to prove
to the world it has done so by complying with rigorous inspections.
Iraq has broken every aspect of this fundamental pledge.</TE>
<TE>   From 1991 to 1995, the Iraqi regime said it had no biological
weapons. After a senior official in its weapons program defected and
exposed this lie, the regime admitted to producing tens of thousands
of liters of anthrax and other deadly biological agents for use with
Scud warheads, aerial bombs and aircraft spray tanks. U.N. inspectors
believe Iraq has produced two to four times the amount of biological
agents it declared and has failed to account for more than 3 metric
tons of material that could be used to produce biological weapons.
Right now, Iraq is expanding and improving facilities that were used
for the production of biological weapons.</TE>
<TE>   United Nations inspections also reveal that Iraq likely maintains
stockpiles of VX, mustard, and other chemical agents and that the
regime is rebuilding and expanding facilities capable of producing
chemical weapons.</TE>
<TE>   And in 1995 -- after four years of deception -- Iraq finally
admitted it had a crash nuclear weapons program prior to the Gulf
War. We know now, were it not for that war, the regime in Iraq would
likely have possessed a nuclear weapon no later than 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Iraq continues to withhold important information about its
nuclear program -- weapons design, procurement logs, experiment data,
an accounting of nuclear materials, and documentation of foreign
assistance. Iraq employs capable nuclear scientists and technicians.
It retains physical infrastructure needed to build a nuclear weapon.
Iraq has made several attempts to buy high-strength aluminum tubes
used to enrich uranium for a nuclear weapon. Should Iraq acquire
fissile material, it would be able to build a nuclear weapon within a
year. And Iraq's state-controlled media has reported numerous
meetings between Saddam Hussein and his nuclear scientists, leaving
little doubt about his continued appetite for these weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq also possesses a force of Scud-type missiles with ranges
beyond the 150 kilometers permitted by the U.N. Work at testing and
production facilities shows that Iraq is building more long-range
missiles that could inflict mass death throughout the region.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the world imposed
economic sanctions on Iraq. Those sanctions were maintained after the
war to compel the regime's compliance with Security Council
resolutions. In time, Iraq was allowed to use oil revenues to buy
food. Saddam Hussein has subverted this program, working around the
sanctions to buy missile technology and military materials. He blames
the suffering of Iraq's people on the United Nations, even as he uses
his oil wealth to build lavish palaces for himself and arms his
country. By refusing to comply with his own agreements, he bears full
guilt for the hunger and misery of innocent Iraqi citizens.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, Iraq promised U.N. inspectors immediate and unrestricted
access to verify Iraq's commitment to rid itself of weapons of mass
destruction and long-range missiles. Iraq broke this promise,
spending seven years deceiving, evading and harassing U.N. inspectors
before ceasing cooperation entirely. Just months after the 1991
cease-fire, the Security Council twice renewed its demand that the
Iraqi regime cooperate fully with inspectors, "condemning" Iraq's
"serious violations" of its obligations. The Security Council again
renewed that demand in 1994 and twice more in 1996, "deploring"
Iraq's "clear violations" of its obligations. The Security Council
renewed its demand three more times in 1997, citing "flagrant
violations" and three more times in 1998, calling Iraq's behavior
"totally unacceptable." And in 1999, the demand was renewed yet
again.</TE>
<TE>   Four Years Since the Last Inspections</TE>
<TE>   As we meet today, it's been almost four years since the last U.N.
inspectors set foot in Iraq -- four years for the Iraqi regime to
plan and to build and to test behind a cloak of secrecy.</TE>
<TE>   We know that Saddam Hussein pursued weapons of mass murder even
when inspectors were in the country. Are we to assume that he stopped
when they left? The history, the logic and the facts lead to one
conclusion: Saddam Hussein's regime is a grave and gathering danger.
To suggest otherwise is to hope against the evidence. To assume this
regime's good faith is to bet the lives of millions and the peace of
the world in a reckless gamble. And this is a risk we must not take.</TE>
<TE>   Delegates to the General Assembly, we have been more than patient.
We have tried sanctions. We have tried the carrot of "oil for food"
and the stick of coalition military strikes. But Saddam Hussein has
defied all these efforts and continues to develop weapons of mass
destruction. The first time we may be completely certain he has
nuclear weapons is when, God forbids, he uses one. We owe it to all
our citizens to do everything in our power to prevent that day from
coming.</TE>
<TE>   The conduct of the Iraqi regime is a threat to the authority of
the United Nations and a threat to peace. Iraq has answered a decade
of U.N. demands with a decade of defiance. All the world now faces a
test, and the United Nations a difficult and defining moment. Are
Security Council resolutions to be honored and enforced or cast aside
without consequence? Will the United Nations serve the purpose of its
founding or will it be irrelevant?</TE>
<TE>   The United States helped found the United Nations. We want the
U.N. to be effective and respected and successful. We want the
resolutions of the world's most important multilateral body to be
enforced. Right now these resolutions are being unilaterally
subverted by the Iraqi regime. Our partnership of nations can meet
the test before us, by making clear what we now expect of the Iraqi
regime.</TE>
<TE>   If the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will immediately and
unconditionally forswear, disclose and remove or destroy all weapons
of mass destruction, long-range missiles and all related material.</TE>
<TE>   If the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will immediately end all
support for terrorism and act to suppress it, as all states are
required to do by U.N. Security Council resolutions.</TE>
<TE>   If the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will cease persecution of its
civilian population, including [Shiites], Sunnis, Kurds, Turkomans
and others -- again as required by Security Council resolutions.</TE>
<TE>   If the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will release or account for
all Gulf War personnel whose fate is still unknown. It will return
the remains of any who are deceased, return stolen property, accept
liability for losses resulting from the invasion of Kuwait and fully
cooperate with international efforts to resolve these issues -- as
required by the Security Council resolutions.</TE>
<TE>   If the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will immediately end all
illicit trade outside the oil-for-food program. It will accept U.N.
administration of funds from that program, to ensure that the money
is used fairly and promptly for the benefit of the Iraqi people.</TE>
<TE>   If all these steps are taken, it will signal a new openness and
accountability in Iraq. And it could open the prospect of the United
Nations helping to build a government that represents all Iraqis -- a
government based on respect for human rights, economic liberty and
internationally supervised elections.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has no quarrel with the Iraqi people, who have
suffered for too long in silent captivity. Liberty for the Iraqi
people is a great moral cause and a great strategic goal. The people
of Iraq deserve it, and the security of all nations requires it. Free
societies do not intimidate through cruelty and conquest, and open
societies do not threaten the world with mass murder. The United
States supports political and economic liberty in a unified Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   We can harbor no illusions. Saddam Hussein attacked Iran in 1980
and Kuwait in 1990. He has fired ballistic missiles at Iran, Saudi
Arabia, Bahrain and Israel. His regime once ordered the killing of
every person between the ages of 15 and 70 in certain Kurdish
villages in northern Iraq. He has gassed many Iranians and 40 Iraqi
villages.</TE>
<TE>   A New Resolution to Meet Challenge</TE>
<TE>   My nation will work with the U.N. Security Council on a new
resolution to meet our common challenge. If Iraq's regime defies us
again, the world must move deliberately and decisively to hold Iraq
to account. The purposes of the United States should not be doubted.
The Security Council resolutions will be enforced -- the just demands
of peace and security will be met -- or action will be unavoidable.
And a regime that has lost its legitimacy will also lose its power.</TE>
<TE>   Events can turn in one of two ways.</TE>
<TE>   If we fail to act in the face of danger, the people of Iraq will
continue to live in brutal submission. The regime will have new power
to bully, dominate and conquer its neighbors, condemning the Middle
East to more years of bloodshed and fear. The region will remain
unstable, with little hope of freedom and isolated from the progress
of our times. With every step the Iraqi regime takes toward gaining
and deploying the most terrible weapons, our own options to confront
that regime will narrow. And if an emboldened regime were to supply
these weapons to terrorist allies, then the attacks of Sept. 11 would
be a prelude to far greater horrors.</TE>
<TE>   If we meet our responsibilities, if we overcome this danger, we
can arrive at a very different future. The people of Iraq can shake
off their captivity. They can one day join a democratic Afghanistan
and a democratic Palestine, inspiring reforms throughout the Muslim
world. These nations can show by their example that honest
government, and respect for women, and the great Islamic tradition of
learning can triumph in the Middle East and beyond. And we will show
that the promise of the United Nations can be fulfilled in our time.</TE>
<TE>   Neither of these outcomes is certain. Both have been set before
us. We must choose between a world of fear and a world of progress.
We cannot stand by and do nothing while dangers gather. We must stand
up for our security and for the permanent rights and hopes of
mankind. By heritage and by choice, the United States of America will
make that stand. And, delegates to the United Nations, you have the
power to make that stand as well.</TE>
<TE>   Thank you very much.</TE>

<KH>DEBATE ON IRAQ</KH>
<HD>Bush Makes Tough Statement but Pulls His Punches</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER and BOB DROGIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>At a time when the White House is under pressure to produce specific
justifications for an invasion of Iraq, President Bush provided scant
new information on Saddam Hussein's pursuit of weapons of mass
destruction and carefully avoided claims, made by others in his
administration, of links between Iraq and the Al Qaeda terrorist
network.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's speech before the United Nations on Thursday was his most
forceful argument yet for ousting a dictator accused of possessing or
pursuing chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.</LD>
<LD>   "In one place, in one regime, we find all these dangers in their
most lethal and aggressive forms--exactly the kind of aggressive
threat the United Nations was born to confront," Bush said.</LD>
<TE>   But at a time when some in the White House have been accused of
grasping for a pretext for an invasion, Bush presented a relatively
conservative case based on widely accepted intelligence findings.</TE>
<TE>   "There was nothing surprising," said Terence Taylor, head of the
Washington office of the International Institute for Strategic
Studies. "The focus of his speech was to lay out a detailed record of
how year after year the Iraqi regime has flouted the U.N."</TE>
<TE>   Intelligence officials and Iraq experts said they found little to
quibble with in Bush's speech and an accompanying 21-page "white
paper" documenting Iraq's violations of U.N. resolutions. And Bush
appeared to steer clear of some of the more contentious assertions
made recently by others in his administration.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Bush said that Hussein continues to pursue nuclear
weapons, but he stopped short of Vice President Dick Cheney's recent
claim that Iraq would have them "fairly soon."</TE>
<TE>   And while he noted that some Al Qaeda members had fled from
Afghanistan to Iraq, Bush did not claim any deeper connection between
Hussein and the terrorist network. In particular, he did not even
mention reports--backed by some White House officials but viewed with
skepticism by the CIA--that Sept. 11 hijacker Mohammed Atta met an
Iraqi agent in the Czech Republic capital of Prague last year.</TE>
<TE>   Experts said Bush's speech appeared to be calibrated to make a
compelling case without opening the administration to criticism that
it is ginning up evidence for a war opposed by many European leaders
and some prominent members of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the president was being very careful to avoid getting
into a food fight over the reliability" of the evidence against
Hussein, said a former CIA official with extensive experience in
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The white paper, titled "A Decade of Deception and Defiance,"
contained dozens of specific allegations against Iraq, stretching
back to Hussein's unleashing of chemical agents on Iraq's Kurdish
minority during the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   But items that may be the result of fresh intelligence tended to
be couched in vague language, making their significance difficult to
assess.</TE>
<TE>   In one instance, Bush said Iraq "retains physical infrastructure
needed to build a nuclear weapon." That would appear to depart from
the findings of the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency,
which directed inspections and disarmament of Iraq's nuclear programs
from 1991 to 1998. The agency's reports indicate that all known
factories and facilities used by Iraq for its clandestine nuclear
weapons program were destroyed in the 1991 Persian Gulf War or in
subsequent IAEA raids.</TE>
<TE>   Recent satellite photographs have shown new construction at sites
previously used for Iraq's nuclear program, including the Al Tuwaitha
Nuclear Research Center, but U.N. and U.S. officials say they do not
know what is in or under the buildings. U.N. weapons inspectors
withdrew from Iraq in 1998, just before a punitive bombing campaign
by U.S. and British forces, and were not permitted to return.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, echoing recent reports, said Iraq has sought to buy
thousands of specially designed aluminum tubes that could be used to
enrich uranium. He also said that Iraq employs "capable nuclear
scientists" and would be able to build a nuclear weapon within a year
if it were able to acquire fissile material--something experts
believe it is not close to achieving.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said that Iraq is expanding and improving facilities that
were used to produce biological weapons before the Gulf War, and
others that are capable of producing chemical weapons.</TE>
<TE>   These claims are consistent with reported findings of intelligence
officials and independent experts.</TE>

<HD>Fox Remains Cool as Bush Calls for Support on Iraq</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: The Mexican leader risks losing vital popular
backing if he more closely embraces U.S. aims against Baghdad, aides
say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>When President Bush telephoned Mexico this week to make his case for
invading Iraq, he got a cordial non-commitment from his friend
Vicente Fox and a firm "no" from ordinary Mexicans.</LD>
<LD>   The Mexican president welcomed Bush's decision to seek support
from the U.N. Security Council. But he warned that Mexico's vote
there will depend on proof that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has
weapons of mass destruction. If Iraq bars U.N. weapons inspectors,
Fox said he told Bush, Mexico will be guided only by "the need for
consensus" among world leaders over what to do next.</LD>
<LD>   "There was no commitment on my part to President Bush, absolutely
none, to support this or that course of action," Fox said in an
interview.</LD>
<TE>   Mexico's Televisa network reported Tuesday's call from the White
House, then asked viewers whether Fox should support Bush in a war.
Of the 42,356 callers that night, 82% said no. On Wednesday the
Senate demanded that Mexico refrain from endorsing military force.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq is becoming a new test of the Fox-Bush partnership and the
closer ties they seek between two countries with a history of
conflict and mistrust. The partnership is already strained by Bush's
year-old war on terrorism, which has pushed aside Fox's proposals to
ease the flow of Mexican migrants into the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Some aides to Fox say he would like to be more supportive of Bush
on Iraq but cannot ignore public sentiment at home, where his
popularity is an asset in struggles with an opposition-led Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Since U.S. forces seized half their country's territory in the
mid-19th century, Mexicans have been loath to back military actions
elsewhere, especially by Americans. After the attack on the United
States a year ago, it took Fox two weeks to come out in full support
of Bush's anti-terror campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico still displays aloofness from its superpower neighbor.
Although Fox led a minute of silence Wednesday for the dead of Sept.
11, Mexico's commemorations were smaller and more subdued than many
in Europe. Mexico was the only member country not represented by its
president or foreign minister at a special Sept. 11 session of the
15-nation Security Council in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Mexicans are only starting to debate Iraq. With one eye on the
polls and one eye on a plan to revive talks on migration with Bush,
Fox is speaking cautiously.</TE>
<TE>   In two brief interviews this week, before and after Bush's call,
the Mexican leader downplayed their differences on Iraq. But he
acknowledged that Mexico's rising profile on the world stage--it is
one of 10 rotating members of the Security Council--carries the risk
of friction with a neighbor on which it depends.</TE>
<TE>   "Our position on Iraq right now is one of prudence, of
reflection," Fox said. He said he told Bush that French President
Jacques Chirac's proposal to give Iraq three weeks to readmit U.N.
weapons inspectors "could open an important space for negotiations."</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether he could imagine Mexico voting for military action
in Iraq, Fox said: "We will see and decide in due time.... What I can
say now is that Mexico is always for the path of dialogue, for the
path of negotiations, for the search for peace."</TE>
<TE>   Such ambiguity might be hard to sustain in light of Bush's warning
Thursday at the U.N. against the risks of extended diplomacy.
Although Fox said Bush did not press him for a commitment, other U.S.
officials have signaled an aggressive bid to get Mexico's endorsement
for ousting Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "The least we expect from Mexico is unconditional support," the
Mexican newspaper El Financiero, in a dispatch from Washington,
quoted one unnamed Bush administration official as saying. "We do not
want obstructions or insinuations from Mexico."</TE>
<TE>   Fox insists that he is committed to defensive steps against
international terrorism and that he has proved it over the past year
by helping tighten security along the U.S.-Mexican border. But at
times, he said last month, "the United States does not appreciate
enough the fact that we're partners."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's focus on security has stalled Fox's proposals to legalize
the status of 3 million or more undocumented Mexicans in the United
States and to expand a guest worker program in America--a top
priority of his administration.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Fox has complained of losing support at home for
closer ties with Washington. After nurturing a back-slapping
friendship during their early months in office, he and Bush have met
just once this year, in March.</TE>
<TE>   Fox denied in the interviews that the personal rapport is gone.
"We talk on the phone very often," he said. Fox has accepted the
reality that immigration is too sensitive an issue in the United
States to be tackled before American midterm congressional elections.</TE>
<TE>   But at their next meeting, set for late next month in Baja
California, Fox said he will ask Bush to resume talks on immigration
in November with the aim of an accord by the end of next year.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a window of opportunity," Fox said. "The U.S. elections
will have passed and the American economy will be growing. There will
be a need for more human energy, more [migrant] workers.... We will
lobby the American Congress. We will lobby the cities and states with
a big Mexican presence. Nobody knows better than those who hire
Mexicans the value these workers have for the United States."</TE>
<TE>   A war in Iraq, Fox said, could bury this effort.</TE>
<TE>   "A war would increase terrorism against the United States and
Bush's concern for security, and that will only make it harder for
Mexicans," said Ernesto Ruffo Appel, Fox's commissioner for border
affairs.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush is acting like a Wild West sheriff who's trying
single-handedly to bring down a gang of outlaws hiding in the town,"
Ruffo added. "What we're trying to do, as good neighbors, is to
persuade the sheriff to get the whole town on his side before he
starts shooting. Otherwise, he's vulnerable."</TE>

<HD>Israeli Troops Raid Gaza Strip</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>GAZA CITY</DL>
<LD>Israeli troops in combat vehicles rolled into the southern Gaza Strip
early today, Palestinian security sources and witnesses said,
sparking a gun battle as residents took up arms against the advancing
forces.</LD>
<LD>   As many as 50 tanks and armored personnel carriers entered Rafah
and its refugee camp near the border with Egypt. Israeli troops
conducted house-to-house searches.</LD>
<LD>   Helicopters flew overhead, and at least one fired what security
sources said was a missile. A hospital source said one man was killed
by shrapnel from a tank shell.</LD>
<TE>   It was the third major raid into Gaza this week and came hours
after the army reported that a mortar shell had been fired,
apparently from the Gaza Strip, and landed in a Negev desert
community. In another incident, an antitank rocket reportedly landed
near the Jewish settlement of Netzarim. There were no injuries in
either incident.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, witnesses said Israeli forces destroyed eight
Palestinian houses in predawn raids in Gaza. Dozens of people were
left homeless. One Palestinian was seriously hurt, Palestinian
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Israel is using house demolitions to combat the nearly 2-year-old
Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</TE>

<HD>Chinese Web Surfers Still Face a Backwash</HD>
<DH>Asia: As Communist conclave nears, regime lifts Google
blockade but keeps Internet curbs.</DH>

<LD>Google, the Internet search engine recently blocked in China by the
government, appeared to be up and running Thursday. But anyone
clicking into sensitive stories that include keywords such as "Falun
Gong" or "Jiang Zemin" would probably hit a wall.</LD>
<LD>   It's part of the routine crackdown on the media that happens in
China whenever an important public event is on the horizon--in this
case, the upcoming 16th Communist Party Congress, which opens Nov. 8.</LD>
<LD>   The Chinese government's watchword is stability: It wants to
create an atmosphere of political and social unity before the
conclave. Newspaper coverage recently has been sanitized to
accentuate positive news and de-emphasize negative stories about
official corruption and the like.</LD>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, President Jiang called on the media and other
propaganda outlets to create a "sound atmosphere" for the upcoming
congress by trumpeting the successes of the Communist Party over the
past 20 years of reform.</TE>
<TE>   But China is no longer the same old totalitarian state. The
Internet and a thriving market economy have transformed the country
into a free-wheeling society much harder to control.</TE>
<TE>   The popularity of the Internet has skyrocketed in recent years. An
estimated 45 million Chinese now cruise the Web. Internet police
struggle in vain to patrol chat rooms, play cat and mouse with users
who try to get around government firewalls, and block material deemed
harmful or otherwise critical of the state.</TE>
<TE>   The crackdown on Google and Altavista, both popular search engines
in China, triggered a flurry of denunciations from users, including
businesses that rely on the Internet for access to information.</TE>
<TE>   "What crime has Google committed that it has to be banned? Alas,
I'm speechless!" wrote one Netizen in Strong Country Forum, a chat
room.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day that Google is blocked is a day I will protest," wrote
another user, whose posting drew several responses in support.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to the Internet, Communist leaders want to have it
both ways--reaping the financial benefits of the global information
age but filtering out the freedom that might threaten their hold.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, people trying to search Google were redirected
to Chinese sites without access to politically charged materials,
such as those related to the intense guessing game over whether Jiang
will leave office in November. Most such crackdowns, however, tend to
be sporadic and relatively short-lived. By Thursday, the government
apparently had found a way to selectively restrict access without the
need to shut down the entire Google site.</TE>
<TE>   "The collateral damage was maybe considered excessive, so now
there's a more focused approach," said Duncan Clark, managing
director of B.D.A. China, a Beijing-based telecommunications
consulting film. "Instead of a sledgehammer, it's a scalpel."</TE>
<TE>   It's difficult for the government nowadays to impose full control
over the media. But for China's rulers, a lesser effort is better
than admitting they have lost that control.</TE>
<TE>   Beijing also apparently has banned the sale of books it thinks
reflect badly on Communist rule, past and present. One book
advertised on the Internet but banned from sale is "I Have Such a
Mother," a scathing account by the daughter of Mao Tse-tung's
secretary. The author accuses her mother of putting the party above
family during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, to the extent of
politically denouncing her own husband.</TE>
<TE>   Another book not found in bookstores blasts the corruption so
pervasive in China today.</TE>
<TE>   But another alleged contraband tome, chronicling the plight of
peasants displaced by the Three Gorges Dam project, was still
available in a Shanghai bookstore.</TE>
<TE>   "In this day and age, it's impossible to order a ban and
confiscate everything on the market," said an editor at a state-run
publishing house in Shanghai who did not want to give his name.</TE>
<TE>   The cleanup campaign ahead of the congress is not limited to books
and media. Even the police have been ordered to intensify their
"Strike Hard" anti-crime campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, China has sentenced two veteran pro-democracy activists
to prison. Mu Chuanheng and Yan Peng were charged with trying to
overthrow the government, according to New York-based Human Rights in
China.</TE>

<HD>15 on Seized Ship Linked to Al Qaeda</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>ROME</DL>
<LD>Following a tip from U.S. naval intelligence, Italian authorities
seized a ship off the island of Sicily that was carrying 15 suspected
Al Qaeda members, and charged the men Thursday with conspiring to
commit terrorist acts.</LD>
<LD>   The suspects were taken into custody last month after arriving in
the Sicilian port of Gela on a cargo ship from Morocco.</LD>
<LD>   "We are certain that these people are part of a terrorist
organization, and we are almost certain that that organization is Al
Qaeda," Santi Giuffre, chief of police for the Sicilian province of
Caltanissetta, said at a news conference. "We have found interesting
documents that would prove the accusations."</LD>
<TE>   He said police had seized telephone numbers, including several in
Spain and France, which linked the men to Al Qaeda, the terrorist
network that the U.S. blames for the Sept. 11 attacks. The 15 have
been held since Aug. 5 in a Sicilian detention camp for illegal
immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   But neither Giuffre nor prosecutor Francesco Messineo made clear
what the suspects might have been up to. "We can exclude the
possibility of a terrorist attack in Italy," Messineo said. "But it
is possible they were trying to reach other branches of the network."
When captured, the suspects may have been planning to transfer to
another vessel, investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities identified the 15 suspects as Pakistanis, but Pakistan
said the detainees are not its citizens and were traveling on false
documents.</TE>
<TE>   No comment was available from the men, who remain in custody.</TE>
<TE>   Officials here said the decision to board the ship was made on the
basis of a U.S. tip.</TE>
<TE>   Police and members of Italy's military intelligence service
boarded the vessel and found the suspects along with seven Romanian
crew members.</TE>
<TE>   Notes and documents referring to Al Qaeda were found on the
Romanian-registered vessel, which set sail from Casablanca, Morocco,
in mid-July and was scheduled to visit Tunisia, Malta and the Libyan
capital, Tripoli, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   All the men were carrying open return airline tickets from
Karachi, Pakistan, to Casablanca.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Navy official Samuel Worth, who was at the news conference,
said that one of the decoded words investigators found most alarming
translates as "to unite in marriage."</TE>
<TE>   "We are alarmed because it's a word that was intercepted during
the first attack on the [World Trade Center] in 1993," he said. "It
was one of the elements that induced us to intervene."</TE>

<HD>4 Are Slain in Brazilian Prison Riot</HD>
<DH>Violence: Drug lord took over parts of the facility and
killed rival bosses, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAULA GOBBI and HECTOR TOBAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>RIO DE JANEIRO</DL>
<LD>One of Brazil's most notorious drug lords surrendered Thursday after
taking over parts of a maximum-security prison and killing four rival
crime bosses, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Luiz Fernando da Costa smiled widely and sang a tune before he and
members of his Red Command crime syndicate released their hostages
and turned in their weapons to authorities inside Rio's Bangu I
penitentiary.</LD>
<LD>   The surrender of Da Costa, also known as Fernandinho Beira Mar
(Freddy Seashore), ended a 24-hour prison riot whose violence spread
outside the facility into several neighborhoods controlled by the
rival drug lords.</LD>
<TE>   The uprising highlighted the intractable corruption inside
Brazil's penal system, the lawlessness that plagues vast chunks of
this city and the growing ruthlessness and ambition of Rio's
increasingly powerful drug lords.</TE>
<TE>   "The objective wasn't escape," said Roberto Aguiar, security chief
for Rio de Janeiro state. "It was to unite the [organized crime]
leadership. Anyone who opposed this was eliminated."</TE>
<TE>   Da Costa's top rival, Ernaldo Pinto de Medeiros, was shot to death
and his corpse set ablaze. Gang members loyal to the vanquished
leader, who was also known as Ue, stormed through at least nine Rio
neighborhoods, forcing businesses to close in "mourning" for his
death. Several schools also shut down, as did Rio's Federal
University.</TE>
<TE>   The episode is only the latest in a series of exploits by Da
Costa, once just another poor resident of a Rio slum but later a
feared drug kingpin who forged links with guerrillas in neighboring
Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   Police say Da Costa fancies himself a Rio version of Pablo
Escobar, the Colombian drug lord slain by police in 1993, and has
worked hard to establish ties with international traffickers of
narcotics and arms, even during the 18 months he has spent inside
Colombian and Brazilian jails.</TE>
<TE>   "He may be the only local drug dealer to have access to the
international market of drugs and arms on a wholesale and retail
basis," said Luiz Eduardo Soares, an anthropologist who has studied
crime here. "That is why he wants to subordinate the rest to his
control."</TE>
<TE>   The uprising began at 8:30 a.m. Wednesday, authorities said, when
Da Costa took four guards and four construction workers hostage. With
the guards' keys in hand, the prisoners moved on to another cellblock
that held leaders of two rival gangs: the Third Command and their
allies, the Friends of Friends.</TE>
<TE>   One rival leader submitted to Da Costa's authority after being
beaten up and was allowed to live, according to press reports here.
But De Medeiros would not and was killed.</TE>
<TE>   Government wiretaps captured Da Costa laughing about the killings
in calls to associates outside the prison, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   "Ta dominado, ta tudo dominado," Da Costa sang, mimicking a
popular song here. "It's under control, totally under control."</TE>
<TE>   Da Costa was arrested in April 2001 by the Colombian army and
extradited to Brazil. Federal authorities transferred him to the Rio
prison this year, a move opposed by local officials.</TE>
<TE>   Aguiar said 12 guards and the prison warden would be charged with
aiding Da Costa and his underlings. Judge Nilson Naves, president of
Brazil's highest criminal court, said the riot "offers proof that the
Brazilian penal system has collapsed."</TE>
<TE>   Outside the prison, gang members were said to have opened fire on
at least four schools. They also reportedly invaded a supermarket in
Bonsucesso, a neighborhood in northern Rio, far across the city from
the penitentiary.</TE>
<TE>   "We are so afraid--many of us live in conflict areas, in the
favelas [slums] close to here," said one worker at the market. "We
don't even know how we will get home."</TE>
<TE>   Fearing more violence, many parents rushed to schools to pick up
their children. Two buses were set ablaze in Bonsucesso, and some bus
companies later changed their routes.</TE>
<TE>   While much the city lived in a state of apprehension, criminal
groups of the Red Command celebrated. On Wednesday night, drug
dealers from the Morro da Providencia neighborhood shot mortar shells
into the air.</TE>
<TE>   In the Complexo da Mare, a collection of favelas, another drug
gang celebrated with fireworks.</TE>

<HD>Russia Ready to Root Out Chechen Rebels in Georgia, Putin
Tells the U.N.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Echoing U.S. claims that the war against terrorism needs expansion,
Russian President Vladimir V. Putin informed the United Nations on
Thursday that his forces were preparing strikes against Chechen
rebels and alleged foreign extremists taking refuge in neighboring
Georgia.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Putin invoked a
Security Council resolution passed after the Sept. 11 attacks on the
United States to justify plans for a cross-border invasion to punish
those who have helped plan or execute acts of terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   The letter preceded by just a few hours President Bush's address
to the U.N. General Assembly in which he made his case for military
action against Iraq to prevent President Saddam Hussein from using
weapons of mass destruction. Putin used much the same argument in
seeking to justify strikes against Georgian-based militants.</LD>
<TE>   "If the Georgian leadership doesn't take concrete actions to
destroy the terrorists, and bandit incursions continue from its
territory, Russia will take adequate measures to counteract the
terrorist threat," Putin wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking to unite U.S. and Russian terrorist experiences into a
collective victimization, Putin said his forces have evidence that
Chechen rebels taking refuge in Georgia's Pankisi Gorge took part in
planning the attacks on the United States a year ago, as well as
apartment bombings in Russia in 1999 that killed more than 300
people.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the mounting talk of war, Georgian President Eduard A.
Shevardnadze convened his Security Council, and the Georgian
parliament met in emergency session.</TE>
<TE>   Georgian Defense Minister David Tevzadze said the government in
Tbilisi would take both "diplomatic and internal policy steps" to
avert conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Parliament Speaker Nino Burjanadze told reporters that any
military operations waged against Georgia would prompt the expulsion
of Russian peacekeepers from the Abkhazia area along the Black Sea,
where Moscow has both economic and security interests.</TE>
<TE>   Another participant in the meeting, deputy council chief Rusudan
Beridze, said Georgia was looking for a third country to take the
militants but had yet to find a host.</TE>
<TE>   "Georgian authorities should understand that they are responsible
for any actions threatening neighboring states and international
security that may come from Georgia's territory," Mikhail Margelov,
head of the international affairs committee of Russia's Federation
Council, or upper house, told the Itar-Tass news agency. But he added
that Putin's warning was to terrorists based in Georgia, not to the
country itself.</TE>
<TE>   Russia has been trying to convince Georgia for weeks that the two
nations should launch a joint force to purge remote Georgian
territory of rebels, some of whom are suspected by U.S. officials of
having ties with Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia last month sent troops to sweep the Pankisi Gorge but
alerted their targets ahead of time, giving the rebels time to find
other hide-outs in the rugged mountains that separate Georgia from
the Russian republic of Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   Although tensions soared between Moscow and Tbilisi as the threat
of conflict intensified, a Russian official said the two countries'
foreign ministers might meet in New York, where they are attending
the U.N. General Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   After Putin made his ominous warnings to Georgia in a televised
address Wednesday night, Shevardnadze called the Russian leader's
accusations "hasty and groundless."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, a State Department spokeswoman told wire services
that the U.S. would oppose unilateral military action by Russia
inside Georgia. U.S. Army forces are training Georgian troops in
counter-terrorism techniques, and Washington has pledged to support
the sovereignty of Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   Putin said in his letter to Annan that Russia had successfully
driven Chechen militants and their alleged foreign supporters out of
Russian territory but remains vulnerable to hit-and-run attacks from
across the border.</TE>
<TE>   Putin said any Russian action in Georgia would not be aimed at
"undermining the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the
country" or ousting current leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Should the Kremlin agree to look the other way on a U.S. invasion
of Iraq if Washington does the same on a Russian attack on Georgia,
Putin can probably count on the support, or at least acquiescence, of
his nation's legislators.</TE>
<TE>   "The Pankisi Gorge is a boil for Russia," Pavel Krasheninnikov,
chairman of the legislation committee in the State Duma, the lower
house, told Itar-Tass, asserting his support for Putin's pledge to
wipe out Georgian-based terrorist suspects.</TE>
<TE>   "Russia has the right to carry out preemptive strikes against
territories from which a potential threat comes to the security of
the country and its citizens," insisted Igor Morozov, a Federation
Council deputy, adding that Moscow has evidence that terrorists
responsible for the 1999 bombings are hiding in Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   Other lawmakers supported the bellicose stance against Georgia but
urged the Kremlin to seek U.N. Security Council authorization--a
position they have pushed as well for Washington's plans to contain
Iraq.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Embassies Were Targets, Suspect Says</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Revelations by alleged Al Qaeda envoy to Asia
spur closures of six facilities. Man has been handed over to U.S. by
Indonesia.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>A key Al Qaeda operative in Southeast Asia arrested here three months
ago has provided detailed information about bomb plots against U.S.
embassies in Asia, prompting heightened security this week around the
world, officials say.</LD>
<LD>   Omar Faruq, who was quietly handed over by Indonesia to U.S.
authorities in June, provided information about planned Al Qaeda
bombings that helped persuade authorities to close at least six
embassies and consulates since Tuesday, the officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Faruq, who is believed to be from Iraq or Kuwait, also provided
information about other terrorist activities, including surveillance
of three U.S. Navy warships and a Coast Guard vessel that visited the
Indonesian city of Surabaya in late May and early June. No attack on
the ships was carried out.</LD>
<TE>   Western officials and experts were willing to discuss the
operative's disclosures but requested anonymity because of security
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said Faruq was a liaison between Al Qaeda and Jemaah
Islamiah, a regional terror group that planned to carry out seven
suicide truck bombings against targets in Singapore, including the
U.S. and Israeli embassies. Singapore uncovered the plot late last
year and imprisoned 13 participants indefinitely under its strict
internal security laws.</TE>
<TE>   One Western security expert familiar with the investigation of
Faruq said the operative has identified Indonesian cleric Abu Bakar
Bashir as head of Jemaah Islamiah. The governments of Singapore and
Malaysia earlier named Bashir as the group's ideological leader, but
Indonesia has refused to take action against him, saying it has no
hard evidence of illegal activity.</TE>
<TE>   Bashir, 64, praises Osama bin Laden but denies any role in
terrorist activity. Contacted by telephone Thursday, the cleric said
he had no knowledge of Faruq.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never heard of him," Bashir said. "I have never met him
either. Who is he? What nationality is he? I don't know him."</TE>
<TE>   Faruq, who is about 35 years old, was arrested on central Java
island in early June after his telephone number was found in the cell
phone memory of Agus Dwikarna, a convicted terrorist. Dwikarna, an
Indonesian, was arrested in the Philippines in March for possessing
explosives and sentenced to 10 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   In Manila, aides to Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo
said she had been advised by the United States on Tuesday that Al
Qaeda was planning truck bomb attacks against U.S. embassies around
the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The presidential palace released copies of an "urgent and
confidential" message to Arroyo from her ambassador to the United
States, Albert del Rosario, in which he reported that U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State James Kelly had warned him of the plot.</TE>
<TE>   "American intelligence evaluation indicates imminent threats to
U.S. embassies," Del Rosario wrote. "Intelligence evaluation
indicates that Al Qaeda operatives are prepared to launch truck bomb
attacks and they are in possession of several tons of ammonium
nitrate."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the bomb plot was not tied to any particular
date, but would be launched when U.S. security was lax.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Embassy in the Philippines has remained open because
officials there believe it is protected well enough. However, more
vulnerable embassies and consulates remained closed Thursday here in
Jakarta and in Surabaya; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Phnom Penh,
Cambodia; and Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say Faruq played an important role in Al Qaeda as a
fund-raiser and financier of terror plots in Southeast Asia.
Typically in the Al Qaeda network, police say, the operative who
controls the money is the one who calls the shots.</TE>
<TE>   He reported directly to Abu Zubeida, a top Al Qaeda operative
arrested this year in Pakistan. Zubeida also is providing information
to authorities and has corroborated some of Faruq's statements.</TE>
<TE>   After his arrest, Faruq was taken from Indonesia to an unspecified
location.</TE>
<TE>   Faruq, who authorities say was trained in Al Qaeda's camps in
Afghanistan, was dispatched to Indonesia three or four years ago. He
was active in two of Indonesia's hot spots: Ambon island in the
Moluccas and Poso on Sulawesi island, where Muslims and Christians
have been fighting a bitter religious war for more than two years.</TE>
<TE>   He and Dwikarna were closely associated in southern Sulawesi,
where they were involved in local Islamic charities. In 2000, the duo
traveled with two top Al Qaeda leaders to Aceh, a rebellious
Indonesian province in northern Sumatra, to meet with Islamic
separatist leaders, officials said. There is no indication that the
talks bore fruit.</TE>
<TE>   Ayip Syafrudin, a spokesman for the Islamic extremist group Laskar
Jihad, said he met Faruq once or twice in 2000 at Koran readings. He
said Faruq was very knowledgeable about Islamic movements but did not
inspire his trust.</TE>
<TE>   "We suspected that he was an accomplice of the CIA, a planted
agent," he said. "He said he was just an ordinary person. He just
wanted to learn about the Koran."</TE>
<TE>   Indonesian officials have repeatedly denied that terrorists
connected to Al Qaeda are operating in their country. National police
spokesman Brig. Gen. Saleh Saaf said Thursday that he knew nothing
about Faruq's arrest or his subsequent hand-over to U.S. agents.
Indonesian intelligence officials, apparently involved in the arrest,
could not be reached for comment.</TE>

<HD>Qatar Might Host U.S. Forces for Iraq Strikes</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Foreign minister says his nation would 'look
very seriously' at a request.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Qatar's foreign minister said Thursday that while his government
hopes Iraq will admit U.N. weapons inspectors, his nation would
seriously consider any request from the Bush administration to aid in
an attack against Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   If the U.S. government asked Qatar to be a staging point for
military strikes against Iraq, the country--home to a major American
military base--"would look at this [proposal] very seriously," Sheik
Hamad Jassim ibn Jaber al Thani told reporters.</LD>
<LD>   Hamad Jassim spoke publicly at the Brookings Institution and met
privately with members of the House International Relations
Committee. The U.S. Central Command announced Wednesday that it would
send 600 personnel from its base in Tampa, Fla., to Qatar's Al Udeid
Air Base in November to test the readiness of newly designed mobile
communications facilities.</LD>
<TE>   The United States has not yet requested "permission for an attack
from Qatar to Iraq," Hamad Jassim said at Brookings. "If they ask us,
we will look seriously, but at the moment there is no decision"
because there has been no request.</TE>
<TE>   Hamad Jassim said he met recently with Hussein. He said he told
the Iraqi leader that, in an attempt to avert a war in the region, he
must allow United Nations weapons inspectors into Iraq without
conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "We are pushing and still hoping he will accept this," Hamad
Jassim said, relating that Hussein said he feared that President Bush
has already made up his mind to attack and that there was no point in
allowing the inspectors back in.</TE>
<TE>   Hamad Jassim indicated that the Iraqi leader was under no
illusions about where Qatari sympathies would lie in the event of a
conflict with the United States. "The Iraqis know that we have a very
special relation with the United States," he said. "It is not secret
and [American forces] are already in Al Udeid."</TE>
<TE>   While the Pentagon has called the deployment of 600 troops to
Qatar in November part of a one-week biennial training exercise, it
acknowledges that some of them could be based in the Persian Gulf if
a war seems close at hand.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon has spent the better part of this year rapidly
expanding its presence at Al Udeid, a base 400 miles from the
southern border of Iraq and 710 miles from Baghdad. It has a
15,000-foot runway, which is long enough to handle all types of U.S.
aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia is another Mideast base for American forces, but the
move to expand and improve facilities at Al Udeid has accelerated in
recent months as relations between the United States and Saudi Arabia
have frayed over the issue of Islamic extremism since the attacks of
Sept. 11. The Saudi government has also been critical of the
administration's handling of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and it
has expressed doubts in relation to the administration's desire to
take military action against Iraq.</TE>

<HD>Nations Are Hardly United Behind Bush</HD>
<DH>Reaction: Most are skeptical of attacking Iraq, but welcome
president's appearance before world body.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAGGIE FARLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>The cavernous General Assembly chamber was solemn and still as
President Bush on Thursday warned the world body to act against Iraq
or stand back. But afterward, the ambassadors and ministers gathered
here had plenty to say.</LD>
<LD>   While most welcomed the president's willingness to work through
the United Nations--at least initially--even some of Washington's
allies said they are reluctant to authorize military force to compel
Iraq to disarm.</LD>
<LD>   "The choice for us is not between action or inaction, but rather
knowing how to act," French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin
said. "We have to make sure that we don't add to the crisis and to
the instability."</LD>
<TE>   That journey to action could be a defining moment for the United
Nations as it struggles to reinvigorate its place on the global
stage.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary-General Kofi Annan addressed the delegates from 190
nations before Bush spoke, and he used the occasion to remind the
president and delegates that the U.N. was founded for nations to work
together for peace, not to unify for war. But if it must come to the
use of force, the U.S. should work through the "unique legitimacy" of
the world body and not strike on its own, Annan said to applause.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Annan had a harsh warning for Iraq, saying that
if it wants U.N. sanctions lifted, it must immediately allow the
resumption of weapons inspections or face the consequences.</TE>
<TE>   In the initial Iraqi response to the speeches, Ambassador Mohammed
Douri said Bush's claim that Iraq continues to develop weapons of
mass destruction was "the longest series of fabrications that have
ever been told by a leader of a nation."</TE>
<TE>   He dismissed U.S. threats but said Iraq is ready to defend itself,
if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have been pleased if the U.S. president would have talked
about his true motives behind his speech--revenge, oil, political
ambitions and also the security of Israel, and targeting every
independent state that would refuse to adhere to the American
policy," Douri said.</TE>
<TE>   The members of the 15-nation Security Council agree that the first
step on Iraq should be a new resolution demanding unconditional
access for weapons inspectors to verify that the country is rid of
any chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. The question haunting
the halls here is: If Iraq refuses, what should the consequences be?</TE>
<TE>   The Security Council's options are few and bleak. If Iraq
continues to be defiant, the council can impose more sanctions or
another embargo, tools that are already in place and that many
consider a failure. Or there is military action. Diplomats will be
meeting in small groups behind closed doors over the next few weeks
to determine if there is something in between.</TE>
<TE>   France will present a draft resolution to council members today
proposing a three-week deadline for the resumption of arms
inspections in Iraq. If Baghdad fails to comply, then the council
would debate the next step, including the use of force. The U.S. and
Britain are working on a separate resolution to be introduced later,
perhaps an omnibus plan with several demands.</TE>
<TE>   "President Bush has started with the most general concept, but the
pace of the discussions will be more deliberate than you expect,"
British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock told reporters. "There are
serious concepts to work out that will take time."</TE>
<TE>   In his speech, Bush outlined his criteria for the Iraqi regime to
avoid an attack, including a halt to the oppression of its people, an
end to illicit trade outside U.N. oil-for-food programs, and a
cessation of support for terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Although there is no guarantee that those demands will be included
in a resolution, the list contains items to help lure support of
hesitant would-be allies: Requiring Iraq to pay all debts and return
stolen property from the 1990 invasion of Kuwait would satisfy
Kuwait, and also Russia, which Baghdad owes as much as $8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department is conducting a flurry of additional
behind-the-scenes deals to reassure Iraq's neighbors that depend
heavily on gray-market trade with Baghdad, diplomats say.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the U.S., Britain and France, Russia and China also have
the power to veto any proposal that comes before the Security
Council. Although Russia and China oppose the use of force, neither
would probably reject a new resolution demanding a tougher inspection
program, their representatives say.</TE>
<TE>   "We have openly stated we are opposed to military action but that
Iraq should let the inspectors finish what has been left of
disarmament issues," Chinese Ambassador Wang Yingfan said.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, even more than his carefully crafted challenge, Bush's
decision just to appear at the U.N. may have had the most effect on
skeptical delegates.</TE>
<TE>   European leaders who have been particularly critical of
Washington's rumblings of war were relieved that the president chose
to consult the international community before forging ahead, said
Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the Danish prime minister and current
president of the European Union.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that the United States has so strongly engaged with the
United Nations will significantly affect the outlook of EU partners,"
he said. "The context in which we view the Iraq problem has now
changed."</TE>
<TE>   But doubts lingered about whether Bush had made his case that Iraq
is, as he put it, "a grave and gathering danger."</TE>
<TE>   "The president challenged us on all the violations, and certainly
the Security Council will have to take that challenge seriously,"
said Jan Petersen, the foreign minister of Norway, which holds a
rotating seat on the Security Council. "But then of course there is
the question, to what extent do they pose a threat? We need to know
more to be convinced."</TE>

<HD>Former Tyco Executives Are Indicted</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Two former Tyco International Ltd. executives were accused Thursday
of systematically looting the conglomerate in a scheme that allegedly
netted them more than $600 million.</LD>
<LD>   In a criminal indictment and a civil suit filed here, prosecutors
charged that L. Dennis Kozlowski, Tyco's former chief executive, and
Mark H. Swartz, its former chief financial officer, stole $170
million from Tyco by granting themselves loans and bonuses that were
not authorized by the firm's directors.</LD>
<LD>   The loan money was used to buy homes, boats, jewelry and fine art,
the indictment said.</LD>
<TE>   The government also accused the men of illicitly gaining more than
$400 million since 1995 by selling personal Tyco shares while
concealing material information from investors.</TE>
<TE>   The charges, brought jointly by the Manhattan district attorney
and the Securities and Exchange Commission, are the latest moves by
prosecutors in what has been a wave of fraud allegations directed
against executives who once were among the most highly regarded
leaders in corporate America.</TE>
<TE>   A third Tyco executive, former chief corporate counsel Mark A.
Belnick, was separately charged Thursday with falsifying business
records to conceal company loans of more than $14 million, which he
allegedly used to buy homes.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, Tyco--under new management since Kozlowski was
ousted in June--sued its former chief, seeking the return of
allegedly misappropriated funds.</TE>
<TE>   At an arraignment Thursday afternoon, the three men pleaded not
guilty to the charges.</TE>
<TE>   New York State Supreme Court Justice Michael Obus released the men
after setting bond at $100 million for Kozlowski and at $50 million
for Swartz. They must put up 10% of those amounts.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors also unsealed a judge's order temporarily freezing
$600 million in assets belonging to Kozlowski and Swartz until a
court hearing later this month.</TE>
<TE>   The self-dealing charges against the executives echo allegations
made against corporate officers at companies including Enron Corp.,
Adelphia Communications Corp. and WorldCom Inc. this year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really a case where, once again, another company management
abused its position of trust and put themselves and their checkbooks
first," said Stephen Cutler, head of the SEC's enforcement unit.
"It's the kind of behavior that shocks the conscience, even among
those of us who prosecute securities cases for a living."</TE>
<TE>   The indictment was the second legal action against Kozlowski by
Manhattan Dist. Atty. Robert Morgenthau.</TE>
<TE>   Kozlowski--one of the highest-paid U.S. CEOs in recent years--was
charged in June with evading more than $1 million in state and city
taxes on purchases of artwork. Prosecutors said at the time that
Kozlowski went to great pains to circumvent paying taxes.</TE>
<TE>   In one instance, they alleged, he had a painting removed from his
Manhattan apartment, shipped to New Hampshire and trucked back to New
York to give the impression that the sale took place out of state and
thus was not subject to New York levies. The case is pending.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for Kozlowski and Swartz defended their clients.</TE>
<TE>   "The charges today are exactly that: They're accusations. They're
unproven. They're unsubstantiated," said Stephen Kaufman, Kozlowski's
attorney.</TE>
<TE>   In a written statement, Swartz's lawyer, Charles Stillman, said
his client was "totally innocent" and a "hard-working family man who
never received a penny from Tyco that was not fully authorized."</TE>
<TE>   The 95-page indictment against Kozlowski and Swartz paints a
picture of systematic fraud from 1995 through this year.</TE>
<TE>   The two men allegedly misappropriated funds from two Tyco loan
programs designed to help employees buy company stock and relocate if
their jobs required it.</TE>
<TE>   The government said the executives used the funds, at low or no
interest, to buy homes in Manhattan, Boca Raton, Fla., and Nantucket,
Mass. They also spent some of the millions on yachts, art and sports
team investments and to pay for a birthday party in Sardinia, the
indictment said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the stock purchase loan program, Kozlowski borrowed $270
million but used only $29 million for its intended purpose, according
to the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   Swartz borrowed $85 million under the plan, $13 million of which
went for the program's intended purpose, the SEC said.</TE>
<TE>   Neither directors nor shareholders of Tyco were informed of how
the rest of the money was used, prosecutors said. That omission would
violate securities laws.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC further alleged Kozlowski and Swartz arranged for the
company to forgive "tens of millions" of the loans, also without
disclosure to Tyco shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   The men also reaped a total of $84 million in unauthorized bonus
payments, the indictment said.</TE>
<TE>   Kozlowski, 55, set up a system in which he could approve millions
in expenditures for personal expenses, the government said. He
avoided detection by limiting internal audits and requiring that
auditors report to him rather than to Tyco directors and by paying
off key employees to gain their silence, the indictment said.</TE>
<TE>   Swartz, 42, aided the process by having the finance department,
which he controlled, rather than the legal department handle the
release of financial information, the government said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors also allege that Kozlowski and Swartz took in $280
million and $125 million, respectively, through stock sales that were
fraudulent because the men misrepresented their own and the company's
finances. Some of the sales were made to Tyco units situated
offshore.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment also said Kozlowski pressured a major brokerage to
replace a stock analyst who covered Tyco with someone considered
friendlier to the firm. Kozlowski then allegedly exchanged gifts
valued at thousands of dollars with the new analyst.</TE>
<TE>   The brokerage was Merrill Lynch, according to a source. In 1999,
Merrill replaced its Tyco analyst with Phua Young, whom it hired away
from Lehman Bros.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason this particular analyst was hired was his standing in
the industry," Merrill spokesman Jim Wiggins said. "As for any gifts
exchanged, the company had no knowledge of any such gifts. And if
that is the case, it would have violated our policies."</TE>
<TE>   Merrill fired Young in April for violating Merrill policies by
distributing his reports to large investors before they had been
approved by the firm's compliance department, Wiggins said. Young
could not be reached for comment Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   In the criminal case, Kozlowski and Swartz were charged with
enterprise corruption and grand larceny under New York state law. The
men could face up to 30 years in prison if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Belnick, 55, faces up to four years in prison if found guilty. His
lawyer, Reid Weingarten, said in a statement that Belnick "has done
nothing wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Kozlowski, a native of Newark, N.J., was hired by Tyco in 1976 and
rose to become president in 1989. Tyco always had been a
conglomerate--operating in many disparate businesses--but Kozlowski
sought to take it to a new level in the 1990s. He was viewed by many
analysts as a corporate builder who sought to succeed General
Electric Co.'s Jack Welch as the most celebrated conglomerate chief.</TE>
<TE>   Under Kozlowski, Tyco made hundreds of acquisitions in the 1990s
with its highflying stock. Kozlowski also moved the firm's official
headquarters to Bermuda in the 1990s to save on taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco's sales ballooned to $36 billion by 2001. Many analysts
lauded Kozlowski for creating a highly profitable giant with key
business lines in undersea telecom cable, electronic components,
security systems and health-care products.</TE>
<TE>   But along the way, a handful of critics contended that Tyco
engaged in questionable accounting practices that enhanced its
financial results. The SEC investigated the firm in 2000 but dropped
the probe without bringing charges.</TE>

<TE>   Charges Against Former Tyco Officials</TE>
<TE>   Criminal and civil charges filed Thursday against L. Dennis
Kozlowski, Tyco International's former chief executive, and Mark H.

<LD>ANCIENT BRISTLECONE PINE FOREST, Calif. -- The twisted sentinels of
this desolate forest are a study in perseverance. Contorted by wind,
deprived of rain, starved by the nutrient-poor dolomite slopes to
which they cling, they have been known to live nearly 5,000 years.
Snags--majestic trees that have died but remain standing--and the
limbs they've dropped, have rested more than twice that long, their
resinous wood resistant to rot.</LD>
<LD>   Beautiful and grotesque, the bristlecone pines in the White
Mountains of eastern California--the world's oldest trees--are a vast
memory bank for the planet that can be used to date archeological
remains half a world away. Their growth rings--each one representing
a calendar year--log the passing seasons. Their tiny variations
record climatic changes, volcanic eruptions, years of drought.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas Harlan, 67, is a human soul mate to these resolute plants.
Tenacious, persistent, the retired University of Arizona tree-ring
scientist has spent years scouring these arid mountains for one
singular piece of wood.</LD>
<TE>   Since the ancient trees were discovered nearly half a century ago
east of Mammoth Lakes in the mountains along the Nevada line, the
scientists who study tree rings --dendrochronologists--have used
samples from both living and dead bristlecones to construct a
chronology that could cover more than nearly 12,000 years.</TE>
<TE>   It lacks only one key piece to make it complete.</TE>
<TE>   The missing link would form a bridge--probably about 150 years
long--from one continuous 8,702-year set that stretches back from the
present to another, older sequence that covers nearly 3,000
years--with one small gap--but whose exact start is unknown.</TE>
<TE>   It is that sample for which Harlan searches.</TE>
<TE>   For scientists, such a chronology would be a tremendous tool. The
bristlecone pines "are like a person living in a single spot who has
been watching things happen for a real long time," said David C.
LeBlanc, a dendrochronologist at Ball State University in Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   A nearly 12,000-year timeline would offer the first year-by-year
account of North America's climate as it emerged from the last Ice
Age. It would shed light on the era when the continent was first
settled by humans. By helping explain how the last Ice Age ended, it
would aid scientists in understanding the current global warming.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists worldwide revere Harlan for his ability to assign
precise dates to tree rings. But like the misshapen trees, he thrives
in obscurity. A poor ranch kid from the Texas town of Harper, Harlan
had planned to be "the world's greatest archeologist." But there was
little funding for his research, and he was toting cafeteria
leftovers around to make them stretch when the University of Arizona
offered a job dating tree rings. He soon became the lab's most
accomplished technician.</TE>
<TE>   "I discovered what I really liked was developing long chronologies
in areas where nobody else had worked. You know," Harlan said, "the
frontier's edges."</TE>
<TE>   He began work at the university's Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research
just as bristlecone research was starting. Over the years, four
scientists at Arizona have led the field. Harlan has worked closely
with all but the first. And he watched each die young, their work
unfinished, in a set of unrelated circumstances referred to--only
half in jest--as the Curse of the Bristlecone.</TE>
<TE>   Edmund Schulman was the pioneer. He discovered the bristlecones in
1953. Four years later, he encountered his prize--a tree dubbed
Methuselah, at 4,768 years widely believed to be the oldest still
alive on Earth. (Harlan says he knows of a slightly older tree nearby
but refuses to disclose its location, for fear of vandalism).
Schulman's find was published in National Geographic in 1958, the
year Harlan arrived at the lab, but by then Schulman was dead, felled
by a heart attack at 49.</TE>
<TE>   His successor, Wes Ferguson, died at 64, his research incomplete.
Val LaMarche, the next big name in bristlecones, died young too,
ruined by substance abuse. Don Graybill, who succeeded him, died of
stomach cancer in 1993. Each man's work was boxed up and stored in
the Tucson laboratory.</TE>
<TE>   Harlan's work, meanwhile, took him to South America, Sweden--and
to Morocco, where, under orders of the king, he established a
1,000-year precipitation record using Atlas cedars. But since Harlan
first came to this California forest, in 1970, it has been the
bristlecones that moved him most.</TE>
<TE>   Whenever he could, he hauled the bristlecone samples of his
predecessors out of storage to fine-tune the timeline. When he
retired 11 years ago, he continued to search on his own, driving west
with his wife, Anita, to trek the peaks and basins on his own dime.</TE>
<TE>   Then last year, an anonymous donor granted the lab $60,000 for a
project. Harlan got the money. Now, armed with the small grant and
accompanied by dozens of volunteers, he has stepped up the search.</TE>
<TE>   Bristlecone pines grow in several Western states, but the oldest
have been found here, in the harshest conditions, where precipitation
is limited to about 12 inches a year and temperatures vary across a
range of 100 degrees from summer to winter and as much as 50 degrees
in a day. The elevation is high, winds blow at gale force and much of
the ground cover is little more than limestone.</TE>
<TE>   Not much grows here, but the Great Basin bristlecone, Pinus
longaeva, thrives through a tortured strategy of slow growth.</TE>
<TE>   The trees can hold needles for 40 years. In tough times they die
off almost entirely, leaving a lone strip of living bark that can
continue growing for thousands more years--sideways along the ground
or diagonally skyward.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent July morning, down the mountains from the ancient
trees, Harlan holds court at his makeshift outdoor workstation. The
tents of volunteers are scattered nearby. A generator hums, powering
computers in a ratty trailer on loan from the U.S. Forest Service. A
team from the Tucson lab is helping. A fellow tree-ring scientist and
his wife have flown from Finland to pitch in.</TE>
<TE>   But most of the volunteers here are friends, fellow spelunkers and
search-and-rescue die-hards, who have known Tom and Anita--a botanist
and science fiction writer--for decades. "They like to hike. They
like to look for things. They are used to many fruitless searches,"
Harlan said.</TE>
<TE>   His graying hair sticks in long strands to his lined face under a
stained Resistol hat. Knee surgery has strained his 6-foot-1 frame,
and diabetes forces him to eat often. But the bristlecones call him.</TE>
<TE>   Besides his hunt for the missing link, Harlan is compiling a
computer database of his predecessors' disjointed research. He has
pored over their cramped handwritten field notes, attempting to
document each sample they studied.</TE>
<TE>   There are trees in the wild that have been tagged, indicating that
some data were collected, but no sign of the research in the records.
There are also data for trees whose locations are unknown. Other tags
are illegible, pecked relentlessly by birds for years.</TE>
<TE>   So Harlan and his team seek to photograph each tree, log and
fallen remnant with digital cameras, recording the locations of every
piece of bristlecone wood ever sampled using global positioning
system technology. Armed only with grainy old photographs, they also
hunt for trees sampled decades ago but now lost.</TE>
<TE>   "It's literally searching for a tree in the forest," Harlan says.</TE>
<TE>   On this day, the Tucson scientists will head to the flanks of
12,497-foot Sheep Peak to sample standing snags and fallen logs.</TE>
<TE>   The Finnish couple--Mauri and Margit Timonen--head for a slope
near the forest's visitor center, searching for a gnarled tree atop a
rounded peak that one early researcher photographed. Another group
hunts for a 4,000-year-old tree that Schulman identified more than 40
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Yet another group heads to a canyon where Ferguson found an
8,000-year-old remnant near a mysterious fallen telephone pole--near
no others--described with astonishment in his field notes.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Harlan trudges up Campito Peak in search of a log, dead for
thousands of years, that had been cored the previous summer. Hauling
a crosscut saw, the team aims for a larger slice, closer to the
center. The wood is at least 7,000 years old but probably much older.
Even though long dead, it releases a powerful sweet smell when
sliced.</TE>
<TE>   In the evenings, core samples are glued onto wood strips for
stability and wrapped to dry. In the mornings, Harlan braces the
strips against his barrel chest, scraping and sanding the surface
until the tiny rings shine. He maps the patterns by hand on
paper--each ring translates into a vertical line, the width of the
ring dictating the length of the line. The skeleton plots--akin to
electrocardiograms--can then be matched against a master chronology
thousands of years long.</TE>
<TE>   Others use complex computer programs to match new samples against
the existing chronology. But Harlan has an uncanny ability to find a
match by eye.</TE>
<TE>   Until last year, he refused to use computers, sliding paper plots
along a massive hand-drawn chart of millenniums to match patterns.
Then a friend designed software to match Harlan's distinctive habits.
Now, in the Forest Service trailer, he keys his pencil plots into the
program, which searches the bristlecone timeline in segments and
spits out suggested pairings.</TE>
<TE>   Rings of living trees can be mapped back from the present, then
overlaid with samples of unknown age. If patterns overlap, the
chronology can be pushed further back in time. Each year carries its
own distinct signature: Smaller rings indicate more hostile growth
conditions. Averaged over multiple samples, the rings shed light on
precipitation, temperature and other growth conditions in a given
area. Frost rings can sometimes be linked to major volcanic
eruptions, which release sulfuric acid into the air, blocking solar
radiation and sparking climate dips on the other side of the world.</TE>
<TE>   By combining the tree-ring sequences from many samples, living and
dead, scientists over the last century have developed chronologies of
other wood types that date violins created by Antonio Stradivari,
Viking longboats and wood-paneled paintings of Flemish masters. By
comparing the chronologies with the rings in wood found in ancient
buildings, they date archeological finds.</TE>
<TE>   The technique proved itself for Western archeology in 1929, when
A.E. Douglas, founder of the Tucson lab, took a charred pine beam
from a site near Sholow, Ariz., and bridged a hole in the pine
chronology.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the gap, Douglas had previously been able to date only
the relative ages of Native American sites constructed with the
wood--determining which came first. Now, the distinct rings stretched
back from the present, each corresponding to a precise calendar year.</TE>
<TE>   Camped near Sholow that evening, Douglas shouted out exact dates
for more than a dozen key sites across the Southwest.</TE>
<TE>   But it was the bristlecone chronology that dealt archeology an
even more startling surprise. For years, archeologists had used
radiocarbon dating to determine the age of organic objects. The
technique measures the amount of radioactive carbon 14 in an object
to determine its age. What archeologists did not know is that the
process gets sloppier as years recede because of fluctuating levels
of carbon 14 in the atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   The precise chronology of the bristlecones recalibrated the
radiocarbon scales, requiring archeologists to change the dates for
ancient civilizations across the world. A long chronology of Irish
bog oak later confirmed the recalibration.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of them say, 'How can a shrubby little bush in the
California mountains tell us something about the Mediterranean?' "
said Rex Adams, who took over Harlan's job at the lab and came to the
White Mountains to help his search. "But it does."</TE>
<TE>   The morning after the Campito excursion, Harlan rises to polish
and date the latest slice--a piece 7,200 years old. It is not the
long-sought bridge, but still "a very lovely piece," Harlan says.
"The only thing we had in that time period was poor. This one is
good. It answers a bunch of questions."</TE>
<TE>   At home in Tucson, Harlan sits surrounded by samples that will
take weeks to date. Many are from Methuselah Ridge, the steep rock
slope where the bulk of the wood that is more than 8,700 years old
has been found.</TE>
<TE>   The work is long, and the end not yet in sight. Harlan seems
undaunted. "I like puzzles," he says, "and this is a big puzzle."</TE>

<HD>LAPD Probe Implicates Ex-Official</HD>
<DH>Police: Report supports claim that former deputy chief
aided son's drug ring. He denies it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GLOVER and MATT LAIT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A recently retired deputy chief from the Los Angeles Police
Department was, for at least seven years, an active player in his
son's cross-country cocaine ring, helping to launder hundreds of
thousands of dollars in illicit profits, a confidential LAPD report
alleges.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Chief Maurice Moore, who retired earlier this year as one
of the LAPD's highest-ranking officials, allegedly retrieved,
delivered, stored and then laundered drug money through real estate
transactions for his son, who orchestrated the operation from federal
prison, according to the LAPD's internal investigation, a copy of
which was obtained by The Times.</LD>
<LD>   "His misconduct represents the worst in public corruption," the
report states.</LD>
<TE>   Moore, 67, denied any wrongdoing through his attorney.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD investigators based their findings on real estate and escrow
documents, court bond papers, city financial disclosure forms,
statements from FBI informants and interviews with people convicted
in connection with the drug ring, according to the LAPD report.</TE>
<TE>   Interim Police Chief Martin Pomeroy has reviewed the report and
has requested further analysis before deciding whether to sustain six
allegations against Moore, according to a department spokesman. Those
allegations include money laundering and a violation of LAPD rules
known as maintaining improper relationships with people involved in
"an ongoing criminal enterprise."</TE>
<TE>   Although some of the allegations in the report, if true, would
constitute crimes, the statute of limitations for many of them has
passed. As a result, the only practical effect of the LAPD
recommendations, if upheld by Pomeroy, would be to retroactively
reprimand the retired deputy chief.</TE>
<TE>   To sustain an administrative sanction, department officials must
believe a preponderance of evidence supports a guilty finding. That
burden of proof is lower than is required in criminal court cases,
which require proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</TE>
<TE>   Moore's alleged criminal conduct first came to the attention of
federal agents who were investigating his son, Kevin Moore, in the
mid-1990s. At the time, Kevin Moore was in federal prison serving a
13-year sentence for cocaine trafficking. Despite his incarceration,
Kevin Moore continued running a major drug network, for which he was
later convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Federal agents' suspicions about the elder Moore were aroused when
they searched the house of Kevin Moore's wife and found a photograph
of a smiling Maurice Moore seated behind the wheel of his son's
antique Mercedes-Benz Gullwing, a car that can sell for more than
$200,000.</TE>
<TE>   As the federal investigation into Kevin Moore's prison activities
continued, agents interviewed an informant who implicated Maurice
Moore in the picking up and dropping off of drug money.</TE>
<TE>   Federal agents later suspected that Kevin Moore's drug money had
helped underwrite five real estate transactions, three of which
directly related to Maurice Moore. Then, the LAPD findings state,
when it became clear that he was facing a significant prison term,
Kevin Moore thought about making a deal.</TE>
<TE>   "According to the FBI, Kevin admitted the involvement of Deputy
Chief Maurice Moore and at one point was willing to testify against
family members in return for some type of deal," the LAPD report
states. Ultimately, however, Kevin Moore refused to cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   "It appears that he has been as loyal to his father as his father
has been to him," the report states.</TE>
<TE>   The federal investigation lost steam when Kevin Moore refused to
cooperate. It further stalled when the informant, who was Kevin
Moore's ex-wife, failed a polygraph test.</TE>
<TE>   Still, on Dec. 3, 1999, the FBI sent a letter to then-Chief
Bernard C. Parks alerting him to agents' suspicions that Maurice
Moore was involved in a major drug ring.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI's information on Moore was delivered to Chief Parks in the
midst of the then-ballooning Rampart corruption scandal, with its
allegations of unjustified shootings, beatings, evidence planting and
drug dealing by a gang of rogue cops. Despite the allegations against
Maurice Moore, Parks allowed the deputy, whom Parks had promoted into
that job, to help direct the department's official inquiry into the
Rampart revelations.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the LAPD's investigation into Maurice Moore's alleged
drug activities languished, in part because the FBI was slow to turn
over some of its confidential reports on the investigation, according
to LAPD documents. Nonetheless, the LAPD should have pursued the case
more vigorously on its own, the report states. Former LAPD Cmdr.
Thomas Lorenzen, who wrote the report on the department's internal
investigation of Maurice Moore, said the deputy chief should have
been immediately relieved of duty based on the information provided
by the FBI in December 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "There should have been a joint FBI-LAPD investigation team put in
place and this matter should have been thoroughly and immediately
investigated," said Lorenzen, who retired from the LAPD in July and
is now chief of police in Taos, N.M.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't understand why this was managed the way it was," said
Lorenzen, who assumed control of the investigation in the spring of
2001. "If it would have been your average police officer, it would
have been utterly different."</TE>
<TE>   Police Commission President Rick Caruso declined to discuss the
contents of the report in detail, saying only that he was "really
disturbed" not only by the allegations against Moore but also by the
FBI and LAPD's handling of the case.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso added that he plans to introduce a motion at next week's
commission meeting in which he will seek to turn the case over to the
department's inspector general.</TE>
<TE>   Parks, who was denied a second term as chief and is now a City
Council candidate, did not return calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the most serious charges against Moore, such as conspiracy
to launder money, are beyond the statute of limitations. Some lesser
allegations, such as perjury, could still be prosecuted, law
enforcement officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the allegations of misconduct can no longer affect
Maurice Moore's career, they do threaten the reputation of a
much-admired senior officer who spent 40 years with the LAPD. They
also shed new light on the association between Moore and his son,
whose drug-dealing conviction was unknown even to many senior LAPD
colleagues of Maurice Moore.</TE>
<TE>   "As a blood relation, Deputy Chief Moore's continued association
with Kevin should not be viewed as consensual, as a son is always a
son," the LAPD report states. "However, even such a relationship can
become improper for a police officer when he or she becomes aware
that the son is engaged in ongoing criminal activity."</TE>
<TE>   Maurice Moore should have notified the department of his son's
legal problems when he was first sent to prison on drug charges in
1989, the reports states. The reason he did not, according to the
report, "becomes more apparent as one looks deeper into Deputy Chief
Moore's involvement with Kevin and some of his associates."</TE>
<TE>   Anna Moore, one of Kevin Moore's ex-wives, gave the FBI specific
details related to dates, real estate purchases and money drops of
her ex-husband's drug ring, as well as details of Maurice Moore's
involvement. But when she was given a polygraph test, she failed one
aspect of it.</TE>
<TE>   "Deception was detected over the amount of money [she said was]
delivered to and from Deputy Chief Moore," the LAPD report states.
"With this exception, [her] statements were consistent with
documents, timetables, arrests and statements of other subjects
related to this investigation."</TE>
<TE>   Anna Moore and another onetime wife of Kevin Moore's, Teresa
Moore, "each separately cited numerous instances of Deputy Chief
Moore delivering and retrieving large sums of money for Kevin,"
according to the LAPD report. "Indeed, until 1997, much of the money
was delivered to and stored at the house of Deputy Chief Moore's
ex-wife Donna Moore."</TE>
<TE>   Donna Moore could not be reached for comment Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   According to a letter from the FBI to the LAPD, Anna Moore told
federal agents that Maurice Moore collected a total of about $1.9
million in illegal drug proceeds from cocaine customers who owed
Kevin Moore. In addition to collecting drug money, the LAPD report
alleges that Maurice Moore helped launder it, investing it in
legitimate enterprises.</TE>
<TE>   According to Anna Moore, Maurice Moore provided $200,000 of
alleged drug money for a down payment on a four-bedroom house with a
swimming pool she purchased in Cheviot Hills. The property was later
deeded to Maurice Moore in 1992. Years later, when Kevin Moore
entered a plea deal in connection with his drug-trafficking case, he
listed the property--still under his father's name--as his personal
asset.</TE>
<TE>   Another property under Maurice Moore's name, but listed by Kevin
Moore as his own, was an apartment complex in Los Angeles. According
to the LAPD, Maurice Moore received $90,000 from Anna Moore for the
down payment. Maurice Moore later put up the property as collateral
for a bond to get Anna Moore and her sister out of jail when they
were indicted on money wire fraud charges, according to documents.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of LAPD report, then Cmdr. Lorenzen noted his concern
that action was not taken against Maurice Moore several years ago,
thus allowing him to continue serving as a deputy chief for several
years before his retirement.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately for the department, we may never know if Deputy
Chief Moore's association with his son tainted his on-duty
activities," Lorenzen stated. "We certainly know now that the case
was managed poorly from the beginning. Better decisions could have
been made regarding this case."</TE>

<HD>Fraud Verdict Against Simon Firm Thrown Out</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN and MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge on Thursday swept aside a
$78-million jury verdict against the family investment firm of
Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr.</LD>
<LD>   Reversing a jury's July 30 verdict, Judge James C. Chalfant found
that William E. Simon &amp; Sons did not defraud a business partner, Paul
Edward Hindelang, in a deal to take control of his pay phone company.</LD>
<LD>   On the contrary, it was Hindelang who defrauded a Simon investment
group by failing to reveal that he was a convicted drug trafficker,
the judge concluded. Hindelang attorney Anthony C. Duffy said his
client had not decided whether to appeal.</LD>
<TE>   Coming less than eight weeks before election day, the decision's
impact was as much political as legal. The Simon campaign cast the
ruling as a crucial turnaround for a candidate who for months has
been a magnet for bad news.</TE>
<TE>   "Today is a new beginning for our campaign," Simon told reporters
at a downtown hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "I have said all along that the jury verdict was fundamentally
flawed and would be overturned, and that's exactly what happened this
morning. Now the people of California will get the kind of
campaign--at least from me--that they deserve."</TE>
<TE>   Other Republicans were more cautious after a summer of troubles
for Simon, from staff turmoil to the candidate's retraction of his
campaign's positions on gay rights.</TE>
<TE>   "It keeps him in the race, but it certainly doesn't win him the
race," said veteran GOP consultant Allan Hoffenblum.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's biggest problem, he said, remains his failure to define
himself on his own terms amid a deluge of television spots from
Democratic Gov. Gray Davis that portray Simon as a corporate
scoundrel.</TE>
<TE>   But in Sacramento and Washington, Republicans said the court's
reversal would undercut Davis' efforts to raise doubts about Simon's
contention that he is a successful businessman.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to me that one of the main pillars of the Davis campaign
has just collapsed beneath him," said state Sen. Jim Brulte of Rancho
Cucamonga, the Legislature's top Republican.</TE>
<TE>   Still, among Simon's biggest troubles is a lack of money to buy
enough television ads to run a competitive race.</TE>
<TE>   Trouble Raising Funds</TE>
<TE>   During the first 10 days of September, Simon collected $159,000,
according to state records listing donations of $1,000 or more. That
would buy less than one full day of statewide television ads.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Davis raised more than $1.9 million over the same 10
days. Much of it came from unions with an interest in bills awaiting
his signature or veto.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's finance chairman, Frank Baxter, blamed the lackluster
fund-raising on the fraud verdict, saying donors had "adopted a
wait-and-see attitude"--until Chalfant's reversal.</TE>
<TE>   "People who have been on the fence jumped over the fence today,"
he said. But for three months, Davis has far outspent his GOP
opponent on TV spots, including one that bashes Simon for the fraud
verdict. Despite the judge's reversal, Davis advisors said the ad
would keep running for a few more days.</TE>
<TE>   The fraud case stems from the Simon group's investment of $33
million in Pacific Coin, a Van Nuys company founded by Hindelang.</TE>
<TE>   At a trial in July, the jury found that the Simon investors
defrauded Hindelang by hiding their plan to charge $1.5 million in
investment banking fees, and by hiding an aggressive growth plan that
ultimately led to the company's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Practice Not Illegal</TE>
<TE>   In his decision Thursday, Chalfant agreed that William E. Simon &amp;
Sons failed to disclose its plan to charge fees. He said he did not
"countenance this kind of sharp practice," but found it was not
illegal.</TE>
<TE>   "If this is investment banking 'custom and practice,' then it is a
custom which the investment banking world needs to change," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Chalfant soundly rejected the claim that the Simon group hid its
aggressive growth plan for Pacific Coin--the core allegation of
fraud.</TE>
<TE>   "The court does not set aside a jury's fraud verdict lightly,"
Chalfant wrote. "But substantial evidence does not support the fraud
claim, and the jury's verdict cannot stand."</TE>
<TE>   In response to Hindelang's lawsuit, the Simon investors filed
their own claims against him. In essence, they alleged that Hindelang
had committed fraud by concealing his drug trafficking conviction, a
claim rejected by the jury.</TE>
<TE>   But Chalfant found that Hindelang had defrauded the Simon
investors when they were negotiating with him to acquire a
controlling stake in his company. Hindelang, the judge found, hid not
just his criminal record, but also his apparent use of drug money to
finance Pacific Coin, as well as his secret talks with U.S.
authorities on forfeiting $50 million in illicit gains that he had
stashed offshore for two decades.</TE>
<TE>   It was true, the judge said, that news articles on Hindelang's
criminal past were available had the Simon group looked for them.</TE>
<TE>   "Perhaps they or their agents should have done so," Chalfant
wrote. But the law of fraud "protects both the gullible victim and
the diligent."</TE>
<TE>   Simon and his business partners took control of Pacific Coin in
February 1998, but said they only learned of Hindelang's drug
smuggling from a December 1998 article in the Wall Street Journal.</TE>
<TE>   At the trial, the Simon investors sought restitution of the $33
million they had invested in Pacific Coin. But Chalfant denied the
request because they had continued to operate the company even after
they fired Hindelang.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the judge awarded the Simon group $125,000 to cover the
cost of investigating Hindelang's background after publication of the
Wall Street Journal article.</TE>
<TE>   Duffy, Hindelang's lawyer, said he was disappointed that the jury
verdict was reversed, but he said the $125,000 was "hardly a
victorious award" for a group that sought $33 million.</TE>
<TE>   "The only reason they would want to declare it a victory is that
their man's a candidate," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ruling Praised</TE>
<TE>   The candidate's brother, Peter Simon, chairman of William E. Simon
&amp; Sons, welcomed the verdict's reversal, saying the firm had been
completely open and honest in its dealings with Pacific Coin.</TE>
<TE>   "Our reputation as both a successful and ethical investment firm
has been completely vindicated," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the Davis campaign pressed its case against the GOP
candidate on another business that went sour; it released a new
television spot blaming Simon for the $122-million taxpayer bailout
of a failed savings and loan.</TE>
<TE>   "Believe me, we have plenty of additional Simon screws-ups,
failures and ethical lapses to talk about between now and Nov. 5,"
said Garry South, chief strategist of the Davis reelection campaign,
who cast Thursday's decision as a partisan ruling by a Republican
judge.</TE>
<TE>   At a bill-signing ceremony Thursday in Monterey Park, Davis said:
"Even though a judge has a right to do what is appropriate, a jury of
12 people still found that Mr. Simon defrauded a company."</TE>
<TE>   Simon charges that Davis has distorted his business record.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Republican Party officials were elated by the
decision, the first good political news to come out of California in
months. "Everybody is going to be a lot more optimistic about the
race after today," said a GOP strategist, who noted that Davis has
yet to put the race away despite Simon's repeated stumbles.</TE>
<TE>   The optimism was tempered, however, by continued concerns about
the novice candidate and the persistent internal feuding among his
advisors.</TE>
<TE>   White House Reaction</TE>
<TE>   At the White House, spokeswoman Anne Womack said President Bush
"has supported Bill Simon's candidacy all along ... and all along
took Bill Simon at his word that the verdict would be thrown out."</TE>
<TE>   Privately, however, the president's political team had all but
given up on Simon by the time the judge reached his decision, turning
attention to Bush's reelection and hopes of improving on his dismal
2000 performance in California, when he lost the state in a
landslide.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Bush made a Stockton-to-Orange County campaign swing
on Simon's behalf, but the results were hardly encouraging.
Fund-raising fell far short of expectations and Bush's arms-length
treatment of Simon--including the failure to utter his name at his
public appearances--was the centerpiece of most news accounts.</TE>

<HD>Blood Transfusions Probed for Link to West Nile</HD>
<DH>Health: Four patients were diagnosed within weeks of the
procedure. But federal officials caution that the tie remains
uncertain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal health officials are investigating whether West Nile virus is
transmitted via blood transfusions, citing four cases in which
patients were diagnosed within weeks after receiving blood from the
general supply.</LD>
<LD>   One of the West Nile patients received blood from three donors
whose blood contained genetic evidence of the virus, officials said.
All three may have had the infection when they donated.</LD>
<LD>   But the link is far from certain: Blood from donors to a second
West Nile patient tested negative for evidence of the virus.</LD>
<TE>   Because all of the transfusion recipients live in areas where the
presence of West Nile has been confirmed, authorities said, it is
possible that they acquired the disease through mosquito bites, a
known route. The recipients live in North Dakota, Louisiana,
Mississippi and Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very, very concerned," said Dr. Jesse Goodman, deputy
director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration. "We are trying to take some
actions to be prepared if this does turn out to be a significant
public health issue."</TE>
<TE>   Government scientists described the latest findings as "fairly
surprising" and "unexpected."</TE>
<TE>   FDA officials said Thursday that they have not yet determined
whether they need to take additional steps to safeguard the nation's
blood supply. Those actions ultimately could include testing all
donations to detect the presence of West Nile or barring all
donations in geographic areas with large numbers of infections.</TE>
<TE>   For now, however, those options aren't practical. The technology
isn't available for large-scale testing and geographic bans could
conceivably do more harm than good to patients in need of
transfusions.</TE>
<TE>   Officials emphasized that there is no risk of acquiring West Nile
from donating blood.</TE>
<TE>   West Nile, which is harbored by birds and transmitted by
mosquitoes, remains a rare illness in the United States. It causes
mild symptoms in about one in five people infected. About one in 150
people require hospitalization. West Nile infections can cause
meningitis, an irritation of the brain's membranes, or encephalitis,
an inflammation of the brain. The disease can be deadly.</TE>
<TE>   Until more is known, health officials have removed from the
shelves any blood products obtained from donors to the four West Nile
patients.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists are seeking to determine the status of blood from as
many as 100 donors, said Dr. Lyle Petersen, who studies vector-borne
infectious diseases at the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. Some donors' samples may have been used up, however.</TE>
<TE>   Among the three donor samples that tested positive for West Nile,
Petersen said, scientists do not know if the virus was alive. Also,
it is possible, though unlikely, that the tests yielded false
positive results, he said.</TE>
<TE>   With the nation already experiencing a severe blood shortage, some
blood banks are worried that any further restrictions on donors will
worsen the problem in some regions. The blood banks said they are
experiencing a squeeze because of restrictions on donations from
European travelers to guard against the human form of Mad Cow
disease.</TE>
<TE>   The blood bank officials said they are working closely with
federal health agencies to determine whether blood transfusions can
pass along West Nile.</TE>
<TE>   "Fortunately, it's a seasonal virus," said Dr. Louis Katz,
chairman of an American Assn. of Blood Banks panel exploring the
topic. "This generally goes away about now. We're going to have the
opportunity over the fall, winter and early spring to gather the
information" and decide what to do.</TE>
<TE>   Katz said the chance of West Nile transmission from blood
transfusions isn't a complete surprise because officials have
determined that the virus can be transmitted by organ
transplantation.</TE>
<TE>   The CDC confirmed Thursday that four patients--not the same as the
transfusion recipients--contracted West Nile after receiving organ
donations from a Georgia woman infected with the virus. One of those
organ recipients died.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities are still investigating whether the organ donor, who
was injured in a car accident, contracted West Nile through blood
transfusions before she died. That investigation is ongoing; she
received blood products from more than 60 donors.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent study, the CDC's Petersen and other experts estimated
that two donors out of 10,000 might show the virus in their blood if
they lived in an area with a West Nile outbreak.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Petersen encouraged people not to avoid blood transfusions.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a potential problem," he said. "But for the average
person, if they need a transfusion, the benefits of getting that
transfusion are going to far outweigh ... any risk of getting that
transfusion, including the risk of getting West Nile virus."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, this year's death toll attributed to West Nile rose
significantly Thursday, to 54 from 46 a day earlier. So far this
year, health officials have received reports of 1,295 human cases of
the infection in 30 states and the District of Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   Health officials in Los Angeles County announced Thursday that
they had confirmed the first case of West Nile infection in the
state--in a young adult woman from the southwestern part of the
county. Her case had been considered probable since last week, but a
final set of tests conducted at UC Davis verified the diagnosis.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles officials said they remain puzzled, though, as to how
the woman became infected. She hasn't left the state, and she doesn't
remember being bitten by a mosquito. Despite increased surveillance,
the Los Angeles County West Vector Control District still has not
detected any signs of the virus in mosquitoes, dead birds or chicken
flocks.</TE>
<TE>   Some health experts have speculated that the woman might have
become infected by an errant mosquito that arrived in Los Angeles
aboard a plane or truck. But mosquito expert Robert Saviskas called
that theory highly unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't think that we'll know for sure until another two
or three weeks go by," said Saviskas, executive director of the
vector control district. "It is possible, although highly unusual,
that she's been infected at such an early stage of the disease that
it hasn't shown up significantly in the other sources."</TE>

<HD>2 Military Academies Are Closed to Public</HD>
<DH>Security: Air Force and Coast Guard officials act after
terrorism alert level is raised nationwide.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GOLDEN, Colo.</DL>
<LD>The Air Force and Coast Guard academies have been closed to the
public because of unspecified security concerns and have no immediate
plans to reopen their gates, spokesmen said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The 19,000-acre Air Force campus was closed Tuesday night, and the
Coast Guard school in New London, Conn., closed Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The closings were recommended after the Bush administration raised
the color-coded domestic alert system to orange, its second-highest
level, based on intelligence warning of possible strikes.</LD>
<TE>   There was no specific threat at the school, said Lt. Greg Hignite,
Air Force Academy spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just like we were around 9/11. I don't know how long it's
going to last," said Chief Petty Officer Eric Eggen, spokesman for
the Coast Guard Academy.</TE>
<TE>   There's been no recent change at the U.S. Military Academy at West
Point, N.Y., or at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., officials of
those institutions said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   West Point has not allowed free access since September 2001, but
guided tours are still available, spokeswoman Andrea Hamburger said.
The Naval Academy remained open Thursday to visitors, said Cmdr. Bill
Spann, an academy spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force Academy, one of Colorado's most popular tourist
attractions, was closed for nearly three months after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The only people allowed on the Coast Guard and Air Force campuses
are people with military identification, including retirees and
students. Nonmilitary visitors will be allowed only if accompanied by
someone with military identification.</TE>
<TE>   Officials were discussing what to do about access for public
events such as football games.</TE>
<TE>   During last year's shutdown, visitors were allowed to attend
football games and concerts, but they could not go anywhere else on
the base.</TE>

bled to death while wedged in a car windshield and agreed to testify
against the woman charged with the murder.</LD>
<LD>   As part of a plea bargain, Herbert Tyrone Cleveland, 24, will
receive nine years in prison and agreed to testify against Chante
Jawan Mallard, 26.</LD>
<LD>   Mallard, a nurse's aide, is charged with hitting Gregory Biggs,
37, in October after leaving a bar. She allegedly drove home with
Biggs lodged in her windshield and parked the car in her garage,
where Biggs died several hours later from loss of blood.</LD>
<TE>   Cleveland is one of two men accused of dumping the body in a Fort
Worth park and helping Mallard cover up the crime.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland could have gotten from two to 10 years in prison for
tampering with physical evidence. He has been in jail since May on a

<LD>A van full of migrant workers veered off a one-lane bridge and
plunged into a river in the northern Maine wilderness, killing 14
people in the deadliest traffic accident in state history, officials
said.</LD>
<LD>   The accident was on an unpaved logging road near the entrance to
the Allagash Wilderness Waterway, a state-administered area 300 miles
north of Portland. Police and divers had to use float planes and
helicopters to get to the site.</LD>
<LD>   The sole survivor of the accident said the van was going 70 mph,
police said. There is no speed limit on privately owned logging
roads.</LD>

<LD>Pfizer Inc. won't have to face a nationwide class-action suit over
its Rezulin diabetes drug that's been linked to liver problems, a
federal judge ruled.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan rejected a bid by plaintiffs
to combine claims from more than 2 million former Rezulin users into
a single case in federal court in New York. Kaplan said consumers'
problems with the drug were too individualized to warrant treatment
as a class.</LD>
<LD>   The decision comes after a California judge's ruling this year
that Pfizer and its Warner-Lambert Co. unit weren't subject to a
class-action suit claiming the drug's advertising misled consumers
about health risks.</LD>

rode a massive write-in vote to a primary election victory that all
but assured him a second term as leader of the nation's capital.</LD>
<LD>   The city's elections board had warned residents that results of
Tuesday's voting might not come for more than a week, as 91% of the
votes were write-in ballots that had to be tallied by hand.</LD>

<HD>Service Honors Pentagon Attack Victims</HD>
<DH>Military: Remains that represent all 184 killed are buried
at Arlington National Cemetery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ARLINGTON, Va.</DL>
<LD>In a single casket, remains that symbolically represent all 184
victims of the attack on the Pentagon were buried with full military
honors Thursday at Arlington National Cemetery, the resting place of
the nation's unknown soldiers.</LD>
<LD>   In a quiet postscript to the nation's Sept. 11 observances,
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld eulogized the dead as patriots
who died "here at home, not on a faraway battlefield."</LD>
<LD>   He offered special condolences to the families of five victims
whose remains were never identified, including 3-year-old Dana
Falkenberg, who died aboard American Airlines Flight 77.</LD>
<TE>   "Today, these five join the unknown of past wars even as we pursue
the war that is still unfolding," Rumsfeld said, standing next to the
flag-draped casket.</TE>
<TE>   A granite monument with five sides, like the Pentagon, will be
placed over the grave next week. It will stand on a hill with a
tree-dappled view of the spot where the hijacked jet smashed into the
Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Names of all 184 victims are inscribed on the marker, which stands
4 feet, 5 inches high.</TE>
<TE>   "It cries out, 'Do not forget. Do not forget, Americans,' " Brig.
Gen. James T. Spivey Jr. said in his funeral address.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,000 relatives of victims sat solemnly, some hugging and
weeping, many holding pictures of their loved ones, as the crowd sang
"Amazing Grace" on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   After the funeral, a caisson drawn by six horses carried the
casket behind the Army Band and two platoons of service members from
the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines.</TE>
<TE>   The service marked the end of a year of Sept. 11 burials at
Arlington.</TE>
<TE>   Individual funerals from the Pentagon attack began here on Sept.
25; the last was April 9. In all, 64 of the dead already had been
buried at Arlington, most of them next to the site of the new
monument.</TE>
<TE>   Many other victims, including some who were working inside the
Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001, did not qualify for an individual burial
site at the nation's most prestigious cemetery, which is limited to
active-duty personnel and certain former service members.</TE>
<TE>   All the cremated remains buried Thursday were determined to have
come from victims, because they did not have a genetic trait shared
by the terrorists, said Chris Kelly, spokesman for the Armed Forces
Institute of Pathology.</TE>

<HD>Cheney to Undergo 'Routine' Heart Exam</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Vice President Dick Cheney, who last month said he had no complaints
about his health, is returning to a Washington area hospital today
for what his office called a routine checkup.</LD>
<LD>   Cheney, 61, has a history of serious heart problems and schedules
examinations twice a year. It has been seven months since the vice
president had his most recent physical.</LD>
<LD>   Mary Matalin, the vice president's counselor, said Cheney would
undergo a "routine, semiannual cardiovascular checkup." The exam
includes an electrocardiogram and an echocardiogram, which uses sound
waves to check the health of the vascular system.</LD>
<TE>   Doctors implanted a sophisticated pacemaker and a defibrillator in
his chest in June 2001. The equipment is intended to automatically
correct abnormally rapid heartbeats, which can be fatal, and also
speed up the heartbeat if it is too slow.</TE>
<TE>   During the exam, which the vice president's office said would be
noninvasive, doctors scan the pacemaker to determine whether it is
functioning properly and to see if it has been activated.</TE>
<TE>   At his most recent checkup, in February, an aide said that the
device had not had to treat any episode of arrhythmia.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Cheney has completed a strenuous trip to the Middle
East and Persian Gulf that lasted nearly two weeks, and has been
actively campaigning for Republican candidates.</TE>
<TE>   In recent days, he has spent time at a secure, undisclosed
location to protect him in the event of an attack coinciding with the
anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking in August in San Francisco, he delivered an upbeat
report--of his physical and political health. He said he was willing
to run for a second term in 2004--"if the president's willing and if
my wife approves and if the doctors say it's OK."</TE>
<TE>   As for his medical situation, he said: "It's good. I don't have
any complaints. I'm proof positive of the enormous value of the
wonders of modern medical technology, and for that I'm very grateful.
I've been able to pursue a full and active career, even though I have
coronary artery disease."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1978, Cheney has had four heart attacks. The most recent was
in November 2000. He underwent quadruple bypass surgery in 1988.</TE>

<HD>Genetic Mutations Are Part of Cloning Process, Scientists
Find</HD>
<DH>Science: Abnormalities in engineered mice explain high
fatality rates. Dangers of human trials are highlighted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>There are hundreds of abnormal genes in cloned mice, which explains
why so many cloned animals die at or before birth and proves that it
would be irresponsible to clone a human being, scientists said.</LD>
<LD>   The process of cloning introduces the genetic mutations, and there
seems no immediate way around the problem, reported Rudolf Jaenisch
and colleagues at MIT.</LD>
<LD>   "I think this confirms suspicions that I have always had and that
many others had that cloning is a very inefficient method at this
point," Jaenisch said in an interview. "It is very irresponsible to
think this method could be used for the reproductive cloning of
humans."</LD>
<TE>   Even before 1997, when Dolly the sheep became the first mammal to
be cloned from an adult cell, researchers have known that cloning is
difficult.</TE>
<TE>   The most common cloning method is called nuclear transfer and
involves taking the nucleus from an egg cell, replacing it with the
nucleus from a cell of the animal to be cloned, and then
"reprogramming" the creation so the egg begins dividing as if it had
been fertilized by a sperm.</TE>
<TE>   Only one of every several hundred eggs start dividing, and of
those, only a small percentage result in pregnancies.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the animals that are born die soon after or develop
abnormalities in their lungs, livers or other organs.</TE>
<TE>   Jaenisch and colleagues at MIT's Whitehead Institute--working with
Ryuzo Yanagimachi of the University of Hawaii, who was the first to
clone mice--made dozens of cloned mice, then looked at the activity
of 10,000 genes using a gene chip.</TE>
<TE>   Writing in this week's issue of the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, they looked mostly at the placentas of the
newborn mice, long assumed to be the source of the problem, but also
at the livers of some of the clones.</TE>
<TE>   They found many abnormal genes. The pattern was so clear that they
could tell normal mice from cloned mice by looking at the results of
the gene chip study, they reported.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no reason in the world to assume that any other mammal,
including humans, would be different from mice," Jaenisch said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the finding should convince anyone who doubts the danger
of trying to clone a human, referring to last summer's debate he had
with other cloning experts, and three scientists who said they
planned to try to clone human babies to help infertile couples.</TE>
<TE>   "It settles the old question ... about how normal can clones be,"
Jaenisch said.</TE>
<TE>   The three scientists have said they are on the verge of creating a
cloned baby, but none has produced evidence that convinces scientists
such as Jaenisch.</TE>
<TE>   The issue has been debated in the U.S. Congress, and competing
bills would outlaw attempts to clone a human being; some would outlaw
using cloning technology in human beings at all.</TE>
<TE>   Several cloning researchers have said cloned livestock such as
cattle, sheep and pigs are normal and healthy if they get past birth.</TE>
<TE>   Jaenisch believes genetic abnormalities will be found even in
these seemingly normal animals, even if some of the abnormalities are
not fatal, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the problems the team found were in so-called imprinted
genes, involved in the development of the embryo. In the imprinting
process only the copies of a gene that a baby gets from its father
are active.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost 50% of those were incorrectly expressed," Jaenisch said.</TE>
<TE>   That may mean that so-called therapeutic cloning, which uses
cloning technology to make human cells for use in medical treatments,
would be safe, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "In therapeutic cloning you don't form an embryo," Jaenisch said,
noting it went to an early stage of development in which a ball of
about 100 cells is formed.</TE>
<TE>   "In cloning," he said, "most, if not all problems arise during
embryonic development."</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Hours after President Bush on Thursday urged the United Nations to
confront Iraq, Senate Republican leaders challenged Democrats to hold
a rapid vote in Congress to do the same.</LD>
<LD>   But Democratic leaders, while uniformly praising Bush's speech as
a powerful indictment of Saddam Hussein's regime, remained cautious
about how fast Congress should move.</LD>
<LD>   The maneuvering over the timing of a congressional vote
underscored how the president's words in New York were aimed at
multiple audiences--the world, the U.S. public and Capitol Hill.</LD>
<TE>   While nearly all lawmakers heard the speech as a call for world
action, some also heard a call for congressional action. Before
Bush's speech, the push for such a move was more muted</TE>
<TE>   "We shouldn't wait for the United Nations to act," said Senate
Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.). "We should show that we are
united in our support of this president and in the goals that he has
laid out. That's part of our leadership role in the world."</TE>
<TE>   To demonstrate Republican solidarity, Lott spoke at a news
conference with maverick Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). The two proposed
a resolution that Lott said would "give the president all the
authority he would need to take necessary action in dealing with this
threat."</TE>
<TE>   They implied, but did not directly state, that the
yet-to-be-drafted resolution would authorize the use of U.S. military
force.</TE>
<TE>   A congressional vote, McCain said, would give Bush the strongest
possible hand as he seeks to build an international coalition to
topple Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   But senior Democrats, while applauding Bush's speech, were
noncommittal. For now, they said, a congressional vote is neither
necessary nor desirable.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said lawmakers should continue to gather
information about the Iraqi threat and the diplomatic and military
implications of a U.S.-led military strike.</TE>
<TE>   "If we have a resolution next week, what's the point of hearings?"
Biden said. "Vote first, listen later? We should be deliberate about
this. We should make sure the country is behind us."</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) called Bush's speech
"helpful"--but not conclusive. He said major questions remained
unanswered, among them how the world would react to the Bush
initiative, how a military strike on Baghdad would affect the war on
terrorism and what sort of regime would replace Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that the case for a preemptive attack has been made
conclusively yet," Daschle said. "That doesn't mean it can't be
made."</TE>
<TE>   Daschle also said lawmakers should consider whether focusing on
the Iraqi issue before the Nov. 5 elections would inject an overly
political element into a major national security issue.</TE>
<TE>   Aspects of Bush's speech won positive reviews across the board,
from doves, hawks and the many in between.</TE>
<TE>   Those in Congress who have been urging a go-slow approach on
authorizing action against Iraq--many Democrats, some
Republicans--applauded what they heard as a move to gather
international support.</TE>
<TE>   For now, these lawmakers say, the ball is in the U.N.'s court.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe the president should go through a process," said Rep.
Martin T. Meehan (D-Mass.). "He now has begun to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Meehan added: "People don't want to go to war. They want the
administration to conduct diplomacy."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. John P. Murtha of Pennsylvania, a leading Democrat on defense
matters who helped the president's father, President George Bush,
gather congressional support in 1991 for the Persian Gulf War, said
the appeal to the U.N. would earn goodwill among congressional
skeptics.</TE>
<TE>   "We're moving in the right direction now," Murtha said. The
president, he added, "is starting to realize we can't do this by
ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Another lawmaker who has been undecided about the need for
military action against Iraq, Sen. Larry E. Craig (R-Idaho),
predicted that Bush's speech would move world and congressional
opinion.</TE>
<TE>   "President Bush clearly laid out the conditions Saddam Hussein can
follow to avoid conflict," Craig said. "Should Iraq defy these
conditions, I believe you will see the pendulum of the international
community, and Congress, swing toward calling for some form of action
against Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Other Republicans who have been cautious about the use of military
force, such as House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas, also
applauded the speech.</TE>
<TE>   "We're saying to the United Nations, 'Defend your own honor,' "
Armey said.</TE>
<TE>   For those who have been most hawkish on Iraq, such as House
Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas), the speech marked another step
toward a goal they believe is long overdue: ridding the world of the
threat of an unstable dictator who controls weapons of mass
destruction.</TE>
<TE>   "The president used strong moral leadership to underscore the
grave dangers that would follow an abdication of responsibility by
the United Nations," DeLay said. "The U.N.'s credibility is on the
line."</TE>

<HD>McBride Claims Victory in Florida</HD>
<DH>Primary: Voting irregularities cloud Janet Reno's bid for
the Democratic nomination for governor. She may fight results in
court.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>With 100% of the ballots finally tallied in Florida's messy
Democratic primary, neophyte politician Bill McBride claimed victory
Thursday after unofficial returns showed him defeating Janet Reno by
more than 8,000 votes for the right to challenge Gov. Jeb Bush in
November.</LD>
<LD>   But the state's top election official has not yet formally
proclaimed McBride the winner, and Reno, the former U.S. attorney
general, has not conceded defeat. She was considering a legal
challenge Thursday as her campaign workers were compiling affidavits
from hundreds of voters who claimed that widespread problems at the
polls kept them from exercising their franchise.</LD>
<LD>   "It appears to me that Bill McBride won the Democratic primary,"
Secretary of State Jim Smith said during an afternoon visit to Miami.
"If the Reno campaign desires to go to court about that, that's
certainly her right and privilege."</LD>
<TE>   The Reno campaign was specifically questioning returns in 81
precincts of her home county, Miami-Dade, claiming thousands of votes
could be at issue. "There's some concern that in some precincts votes
were not counted correctly or completely," said Mo Elleithee, Reno's
campaign manager. "Until those questions are satisfied, we're going
to stay the course."</TE>
<TE>   McBride's margin of victory was 8,196 of more than 1.3 million
votes cast, according to the Florida Department of State. Reno fell
1,445 votes short of triggering an automatic recount.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to thank the 600,000 people who supported my
candidacy," McBride told supporters Thursday night at a Tampa hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, who will face the Democratic nominee in the Nov. 5 general
election, seemed eager to battle one challenger after being beaten up
rhetorically for months by the trio of primary candidates: McBride,
Reno and state Sen. Daryl Jones.</TE>
<TE>   "And that person, in the event it is Mr. McBride, he'll have to
start laying out with more specificity where, what his views are,"
Bush said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll look forward to a hearty debate, and we'll fight hard. And
if it is him, I commend him for winning the primary, and look forward
to working with him."</TE>
<TE>   Many political analysts say McBride, a former Marine infantry
officer who later headed Florida's largest law firm, is more
middle-of-the-road than Reno, a Clinton Cabinet member, and thus a
more dangerous adversary for President Bush's younger brother.
Ironically, the GOP may have helped to boost the once-unknown McBride
by bankrolling attack ads against him.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the reasons McBride is where he is is the television ads
the Bush campaign ran against him," said Democratic state Rep. Lois
Frankel, a onetime gubernatorial hopeful.</TE>
<TE>   The McBride campaign refrained from saying anything that sounded
triumphal.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just trying to piece everything together," communication
director Alan Stonecipher said. "Earlier in the morning, we had
indications Reno was ready to call McBride and concede, but maybe
they made a decision after looking at it [the disputed vote count in
Miami-Dade] to follow it up and see where it leads."</TE>
<TE>   The McBride camp was being careful not to offend the
independent-minded Reno because it wants her support--and that of her
passionate followers among seniors, African Americans, gays and
lesbians, and other constituencies--in the bid to oust Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd like all this to get cleaned up and settled so Reno can be a
party" to the next phase of McBride's campaign, Stonecipher said.</TE>
<TE>   On election day, scores of precincts in southeast Florida opened
late because poll workers didn't know how to use new touch-screen
voting machines. Many voters found that their precinct boundaries had
changed and that they were supposed to vote in unfamiliar places.</TE>
<TE>   And poor organization and absent poll workers were rife in Broward
County.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday evening, almost 48 hours after polls closed, officials in
Miami-Dade were still rechecking the count in 14 precincts. According
to David Host, spokesman for the Department of State, election
results by law do not have to be certified until Tuesday, a week from
the day ballots were cast. So the deadlock among Democrats could last
several more days.</TE>
<TE>   After the 2000 presidential election, Republicans and Democrats
filed suit over Florida's returns, with the GOP, and Gov. Bush's
older sibling George W. Bush, ultimately prevailing. At the time, the
issue was what weight to give ballots that had been improperly cast
because, for example, the voter didn't make a big enough hole in a
card.</TE>
<TE>   If the Reno campaign grounds its legal case on voters being turned
away from the polls because of human or technical errors, it will
have a much tougher sell to the courts than the Democrats in 2000,
said one of Florida's leading experts on government and the state
constitution.</TE>
<TE>   "A judge could invalidate the election and declare her the
winner," said Joseph W. Little, professor of law at the University of
Florida in Gainesville. "Usually what would happen in a case like
that is the judge would exclude some votes that were counted. That's
easy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be much harder in a situation where the argument
is, 'The people didn't vote because of what went on, and if they had,
I would have won.'</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a daunting task for the losing candidate in this
case, barring the showing of actual corruption," Little said.</TE>

<HD>Long-Term Mission Likely at Guantanamo Bay Prison</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Facility will probably house suspects for at
least three more years, U.S. commander says. An expansion is also a
possibility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE, Cuba</DL>
<LD>The makeshift prison for detainees from the Afghanistan war is being
readied for long-term use and will likely continue to house terrorism
suspects for at least three more years, the commander of the U.S.
Navy base disclosed Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Navy Capt. Bob Buehn said his budget proposals through 2005 call
for funds to continue housing detainees here, and could be expanded
to accommodate even more than the roughly 2,000 prisoners authorized
by Congress.</LD>
<LD>   And in another indication that the detainees are not leaving
anytime soon, the head of the base's medical operations noted that he
too is making preparations for an upgraded health-care system for
individuals kept here on an extended basis.</LD>
<TE>   Although Washington has made no formal announcement of its plans,
Buehn also said that if charges are filed against the detainees,
Guantanamo Bay could easily handle military tribunals. "Everybody is
already here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Buehn, who also is deputy commander of the detainee task force,
said "it is logical" for his facility to become the U.S. military's
central prison if the war on terrorism spreads. Captured Iraqi
soldiers could also be housed here if the U.S. goes to war with that
country, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In his budget plans for the next three years, Buehn is calling for
major projects at the 100-year-old base to accommodate the long-term
operation of a prison--including new roads, building construction and
other improvements to house and support guards and other staff to
watch the detainees.</TE>
<TE>   "We've already been here almost a year now," Buehn said, "and
we're planning three years ahead. We have grand plans that go out for
20 and 25 years."</TE>
<TE>   The 598 detainees from 43 countries are housed in a sprawling
prison compound known as Camp Delta. Construction of an additional
204 one-man cells is to be completed next month.</TE>
<TE>   Another sign that the military is increasingly regarding
Guantanamo Bay as a long-term solution is a switch in personnel here.
When the first detainees arrived on Jan. 11, the guard task force was
made up of regular full-time soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines.</TE>
<TE>   But now, more than 80% of the contingent is composed of National
Guard and reserve units called up after the terrorist attacks on the
World Trade Center and the Pentagon a year ago. This change allows
full-time members of the military to be available to support the war
on terrorism abroad, while the part-time units can be rotated through
here for six-and eight-month tours of duty. In addition, two joint
task forces set up for the detainee project--one made up of
interrogators and the other comprising prison guards--are being
consolidated into one unit beginning this weekend under the formal
name of Joint Task Force GTMO.</TE>
<TE>   A two-star general will be named soon to oversee the entire
operation, with Buehn as his second-in-command.</TE>
<TE>   Buehn said he often meets with his staff and talks to Washington
about long-term contingencies needed to support Guantanamo Bay as
this country's chief military prison.</TE>
<TE>   "We ask that question all the time," he said. "For planning, we're
talking about years, instead of months, now."</TE>
<TE>   Navy Capt. Al Shimkus, the head of the base hospital, is looking
at the long-term effects of detention. As an example, he said
Thursday that detainees held for long periods in a distant land
likely would require expanded psychiatric care, and noted that one
detainee diagnosed as schizophrenic had been sent back to
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether other mental health problems will arise for
detainees held here indefinitely, Shimkus said, "That likelihood is
probably true."</TE>
<TE>   Already there have been four suicide attempts by hanging, in which
detainees tried to use "comfort items," such as sheets and towels, to
choke themselves in their cells. Shimkus said a dozen detainees had
tried to harm themselves by scratching their wrists. Another, he
said, tried to swallow his tongue, "which is impossible."</TE>
<TE>   After eight months as the main detention center for individuals
captured primarily in Afghanistan, the operation at Guantanamo Bay is
now in a sharp state of flux as the Pentagon continues to sort
through individual cases to determine whether any of the 598
detainees here should stand trial, and on what charges. The Bush
administration has declared those held here to be "enemy combatants,"
a murky legal and political status.</TE>
<TE>   That uncertainty has raised great angst not only among the
detainees, who constantly ask about their future and when they might
be going home, but also among civil liberties groups, which worry
that the U.S. military is exceeding the bounds of humane treatment by
neither charging the detainees with offenses nor setting them free.</TE>
<TE>   This month, for instance, the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights,
a private group based in New York, sharply questioned how the U.S.
could continue to hold detainees without also affording them some
legal protections.</TE>
<TE>   "The Defense Department has indicated that many of the detainees
can expect to be kept in Guantanamo indefinitely," the committee
complained in a Sept. 4 report, "until the end of the war against
terrorism, a war that shows no sign of ending any time soon."</TE>
<TE>   Army Brig. Gen. Rick Baccus, head of the guards task force, said
that as the weeks and months drag on, many detainees are repeatedly
asking when they can go home. Sometimes they bang on their bunks, he
said, or throw water on guards, demanding answers.</TE>
<TE>   "They ask the guards, they ask the chaplains, they ask the medical
personnel," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Baccus and his staff insist that the detainees are being treated
humanely, and that International Red Cross inspectors routinely visit
the detainees and then follow up with the task force on individual
complaints. The detainees do get reading material, said Army Col.
John Perrone, the prison warden. Thousands of books are being flown
into the prison library, including works on religion and English
vocabulary, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The base's Catholic chaplain, Father Raymond A. Tetrault, said
that a handful of the Muslim detainees have expressed an interest in
learning more about Christianity. "They've asked for copies of the
Old Testament that they would like to read," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But the main mission here, beyond housing and guarding the
detainees, remains interrogation, as U.S. authorities continue to try
to learn more from the prisoners about their backgrounds, their
affiliations with terrorist groups and anything at all about
terrorism plans.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities are reluctant to discuss how that is going, although
some sources have said the U.S. has learned little from the
Guantanamo Bay detainees so far.</TE>
<TE>   But Army Col. Dennis Fink, a Special Forces officer assigned to
the interrogation efforts, indicated that even after eight months,
all has not been a bust.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say anyone is useless to us," Fink said. "You can get
information from anybody."</TE>
<TE>   As that crucial work continues, Buehn said he now wonders whether
history eventually will remember Guantanamo Bay not as a unique U.S.
military base in a communist country, but rather as something more
akin to the Nuremberg stockade and trials after World War II.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a quiet little spot before the detainees came," he said
of the 45-square-mile area leased from the Cuban government in 1903
on an open-ended basis. "A lot of people didn't even know we had a
base down here. Now they know we're here for sure."</TE>

<HD>Bush Wins Concession Over Homeland Security</HD>
<DH>Senate: The president succeeds in blocking creation of an
office of counter-terrorism in the department. He had threatened a
veto.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The president won an opening showdown Thursday in the Senate
concerning his proposed Department of Homeland Security.</LD>
<LD>   On a 55-41 vote, the chamber backed President Bush's rejection of
a provision that would create a separate White House office on
counter-terrorism headed by a director who would be confirmed by the
Senate.</LD>
<LD>   Bush had threatened to veto Senate legislation to establish the
department unless that provision was dropped, complaining that it
would amount to unwarranted congressional interference in
presidential powers.</LD>
<TE>   "Today was a test vote, and we passed it with flying colors," a
senior Republican aide said after the Senate action.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel we are in a strong position to get a bill out of here
that the president will sign."</TE>
<TE>   Among the six Democrats who backed Bush on Thursday concerning
presidential prerogatives was former First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton, now a senator from New York.</TE>
<TE>   But Clinton plans to oppose Bush on another key battle: proposed
amendments that would give him the broad powers he has demanded to
hire, fire and transfer workers in the new department. The president
contends he needs such authority to build an efficient operation.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton agrees with fellow Democrats and organized labor that such
"management flexibility" would be an unjustified attack on civil
service and collective bargaining protections.</TE>
<TE>   Independent Sen. James M. Jeffords of Vermont also sided with the
president in the preliminary vote.</TE>

<HD>Many Picked Lottery's 9-1-1</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>So many people wanted to bet the numbers 9-1-1 on Sept. 11 that the
New York State lottery stopped selling the combination the day before
the anniversary of the World Trade Center attacks, officials said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   And when 9-1-1 won Wednesday night's drawing, some proclaimed it
was fate. Mathematics experts preferred to focus on probabilities.</LD>
<LD>   Christopher M. Rump, an assistant professor of industrial
engineering at the University of Buffalo, who teaches probability
theory, said Thursday the odds of picking the right number, such as
9-1-1, in this type of drawing were 1,000 to one.</LD>
<TE>   "It's pretty rare," Rump said. "The fact it hit this particular
day is a little eerie in some people's minds."</TE>
<TE>   But such a convergence "is not as unlikely as it appears to be,"
said Karl Sigman, an applied probability specialist and a professor
at Columbia University's School of Engineering. "The probability the
same number as the same day would win at least once in any year, is
about 50%."</TE>
<TE>   Officials said they had employed the lottery's standard
random-drawing process, in which numbered balls circulate in a
machine. After levers are pressed, the balls are lifted by air into
tubes where they are displayed.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of 9-1-1 were cut off at 2 p.m. Tuesday, when the potential
payout reached the maximum total of $4,999,999. By that time, 14,878
tickets with the 9-1-1 combination had been sold.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a liability cap of $5 million for any particular
drawing," said lottery spokeswoman Carolyn Hapeman. "Once the sale
has the potential to reach that cap, we cut off that number."</TE>
<TE>   Each $1 ticket paid $500 to the winner and a 50-cent ticket paid
$250, but officials did not know how many individuals might actually
share in the payouts.</TE>
<TE>   "One ticket could represent one person or it could represent
three, five, 10 people or more," Hapeman said.</TE>
<TE>   The 9-1-1 combination had not come up in more than a year, Hapeman
said.</TE>

<HD>Tussle for Pageant Crown Is Over in North Carolina</HD>
<DH>Dispute: Misty Clymer will be the state's Miss America
entrant. She was challenged after winner Rebekah Revels quit, then
backpedaled.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A bizarre battle between two contestants to represent North Carolina
in next week's Miss America pageant ended Thursday, when officials
barred Rebekah Revels from claiming the state title that she had
earlier given up after an ex-boyfriend revealed he took topless
photos of her.</LD>
<LD>   The decision by George Bauer, acting president of the Miss America
Organization, came hours after a federal judge refused to order
pageant officials to recognize Revels as the rightful Miss North
Carolina. As a result, Misty Clymer, the runner-up who inherited the
title in July, will represent the state in the Atlantic City, N.J.,
festivities Sept. 21.</LD>
<LD>   "Rebekah Revels will not compete in the Miss America national
finals next week," Bauer said in a statement issued Thursday.
However, her status as a "VIP guest" at the pageant "will continue
for the present time," he added.</LD>
<TE>   Revels, who was in Atlantic City awaiting the legal resolution of
her dispute, could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Thursday, Bauer said he was glad that U.S. District Judge
James Fox in Wilmington, N.C., had "understood the Miss American
Organization" and refused to intervene in the brouhaha that had
developed in recent weeks over Revels' and Clymer's competing claims
to the beauty crown.</TE>
<TE>   "We have very high standards of integrity, no reflection on
Rebekah Revels at all," Bauer said. "We try to attract the highest
quality young women in the country."</TE>
<TE>   In his ruling, Fox said that Miss America officials alone should
make the final decision as to whether to exclude or include Revels in
the pageant.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy surfaced this summer when Steve Tosh, Revels'
former boyfriend, sent an e-mail to North Carolina beauty pageant
officials saying he had taken topless pictures of Revels in a
dormitory room. He told them that "nude pics of Miss America bring in
big bucks nowadays."</TE>
<TE>   Revels, a 24-year-old high school English teacher, said she had
been trapped in an "abusive" relationship with Tosh and resigned her
crown several days after he threatened to publish the pictures.</TE>
<TE>   Clymer, a 24-year-old accountant from Raleigh, was quickly named
to replace her at the Miss America contest. But then Revels had
second thoughts. She claimed that she had been unfairly forced to
relinquish her title by pageant organizers, who ruled that--because
of the nude pictures--she had breached the morals clause in her state
contract.</TE>
<TE>   The clause states that a contestant "must be of good moral
character" and be someone who has not engaged in actions that are
"dishonest, immoral, immodest, indecent or in bad taste."</TE>
<TE>   Revels sued the North Carolina organizers and won an initial round
last week when she persuaded Judge Narley L. Cashwell of Wake County
Superior Court to issue a temporary order barring Clymer from
assuming the title of Miss North Carolina. As a result, Clymer and
Revels both traveled to Atlantic City this week and began rehearsals
for the televised pageant.</TE>
<TE>   Because Cashwell's order expired Wednesday, Revels had also filed
a lawsuit in federal court asking Fox to require Miss America
officials to recognize her--and not Clymer--as the rightful Miss
North Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   Fox said his decision was not so much about the women's competing
claims, but about the integrity of the pageant itself.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a public interest in seeing that the image [of the Miss
America contest] is not tarnished, because if it is tarnished there
will be fewer contestants, there will be fewer scholarships, there
will be fewer ideals to uphold," he said. "I don't think that's
silly. We are a country that admires bravery, courage and integrity.
We instill it in our youth."</TE>
<TE>   Fox added it was not clear whether Revels would prevail over
Clymer in a trial, and said he needed more time on a request by Miss
America organizers to submit the dispute to an arbitrator.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed," said Barry Nakell, Revels' lawyer. "I
certainly respect his judgment, although I disagree with it."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Testing for Radiation Materials on Ship</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Pentagon sent a team, including demolition experts, to try to
determine if there are radioactive materials on a ship detained off
the coast of New Jersey, officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   They also said intelligence officials had tracked the vessel for
some time before its arrival on the East Coast.</LD>
<LD>   The specialists were sent after one test earlier in the week
showed traces of radioactivity in the cargo of the M/V Palermo
Senator--and a second test was inconclusive, defense officials said.</LD>
<TE>   The Liberian-flagged container ship was ordered to remain in a
security zone six miles offshore while the inspection continues, the
Coast Guard said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities were alerted to a possible concern about the ship's
cargo as it made its way to the U.S. with stops in Asia and the
Middle East, top trouble regions in the Bush administration's war on
terrorism, two officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The ship is believed to have made stops in Indonesia, Malaysia and
Egypt, a defense official said on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Department spokesmen declined to say what the Pentagon
team was to do on the ship, offering only that a team with special
capabilities was sent to assist the FBI, which is in charge of the
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   But another official, asking not to be identified, said that the
team included experts in detecting and disposing of explosive
ordnance.</TE>
<TE>   The ship was directed to a berth at the Port Newark/Elizabeth
Marine Terminal after a Coast Guard team boarded the vessel Tuesday.
Team members reported hearing suspicious sounds in several of the
ship's cargo holds but found no evidence of stowaways and said they
could not determine the source.</TE>
<TE>   Officials have declined to describe the cargo.</TE>

<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>A man accused of trying to blow up an airliner with explosives in his
shoes told FBI interrogators he was driven by anger over the
treatment of Muslims in Israel, transcripts of the interrogations
show.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Reid, 29, a British citizen and convert to Islam, told
investigators that he traveled in June 2001 to Jerusalem's Al Aqsa
Mosque, and was angered to see "Jews with guns" inside.</LD>
<LD>   "His trip to Jerusalem further emboldened him to act against the
West when he witnessed the many checkpoints and travel restrictions
on Muslims," an interrogation transcript says.</LD>
<TE>   Asked why he didn't choose to attack Israel, Reid told
investigators, "America is the problem, without America there would
be no Israel."</TE>

<HD>Hunter's Brain-Wasting Disease Wasn't From Deer, Officials
Say</HD>
<DH>Health: Wisconsin man, one of three who ate game and died
in the '80s and '90s, succumbed to a more common disorder.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MADISON, Wis.</DL>
<LD>The brain-destroying illness that killed a man who had eaten venison
and elk meat was not a form of chronic wasting disease affecting deer
herds, state health officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Wisconsin's Division of Public Health has been investigating the
deaths of three outdoorsmen to find out whether chronic wasting
disease crossed from animals to humans, just as "mad cow" disease did
in Europe.</LD>
<LD>   The hunters knew one another and ate elk and deer meat at wild
game feasts hosted by one of them in Wisconsin during the 1980s and
1990s.</LD>
<TE>   All three died of brain-wasting diseases in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   The test results made public Thursday were for Roger Marten, whose
death was attributed to Pick's disease, a more common
brain-destroying disorder.</TE>
<TE>   Marten's brain tissue showed no evidence of the mutant proteins,
called prions, that are associated with chronic wasting, state
epidemiologist Jim Kazmierczak said.</TE>
<TE>   There has never been a documented case of a person contracting a
brain-destroying illness from eating wild animals infected with
chronic wasting disease.</TE>
<TE>   The illness is related to mad cow disease in cattle and
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. All three are caused by prions,
which make holes in the brain resembling those in sponges.</TE>
<TE>   Pathologists with the National Prion Disease Surveillance Center
also are testing brain tissue from Marten's acquaintances, James
Botts and Wayne Waterhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Botts and Waterhouse died of what was diagnosed as
Creutzfeldt-Jakob, their families said.</TE>
<TE>   Creutzfeldt-Jakob is always fatal and occurs in just one in a
million people.</TE>
<TE>   Kazmierczak said the state hoped to have test results for them
within a few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   In February, chronic wasting disease was found in Wisconsin deer,
marking the first time it has showed up east of the Mississippi
River.</TE>
<TE>   It was identified in Colorado elk more than three decades ago.
Chronic wasting disease now is known to exist in deer or elk in eight
states and Canada; thousands of animals are being slaughtered to
contain it.</TE>

<HD>Life Expectancy Hits 76.9 in U.S.; Health Costs Soar</HD>
<DH>Study: CDC statistics for 2000 show American men living to
74 and women to nearly 80. However, the medical care racial gap
persists and adults are heavier.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSIE MESTEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Americans are living longer than ever and infant mortality is at a
record low, according to a new government report on the state of the
nation's health.</LD>
<LD>   However, the cost of health care is rising yearly, and Americans
are becoming fatter than ever. In addition, racial and ethnic health
disparities--while continuing to narrow--are still significant.</LD>
<LD>   These and many other statistics--many good, some bad--were
released Thursday in a 430-page report prepared by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. The annual report examined a wealth
of data on the habits, health care costs, diseases and deaths of the
U.S. population in 2000. "It shows what we're doing right, and where
we still need to make improvements," said Edward J. Sondik, director
of the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics, which prepared
the report.</LD>
<TE>   The report noted great strides in the nation's health over the
past century. "It's pleasing," said Dr. Linda Rosenstock, dean of
UCLA's School of Public Health. "We continue to be able to highlight
how investments in public health activities have a big payoff."</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the average life expectancy at birth is now nearly
77 years, up from 47 a century ago. It is 74 years for men and nearly
80 for women, according to preliminary numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Infant Deaths Decline</TE>
<TE>   The infant mortality rate also has fallen, to 6.9 deaths per 1,000
births--a 75% drop since 1950 and a slight improvement from the 7.1
deaths reported in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Mortality rates at other stages of life also have dropped steeply
for a variety of reasons. There are fewer deaths among children and
adults from accidents, infectious diseases, cancer and heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   The report also noted that rates of syphilis are at an all-time
low since reporting on the sexually transmitted disease began in
1941. Homicide rates among black and Hispanic youth dropped nearly
50% in the 1990s; the percentage of adults who smoked dropped from
over 40% in the 1960s to 23% in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Deaths from AIDS, which peaked in the 1980s, dropped after 1995
following the introduction of potent new medications.</TE>
<TE>   But not all of the news is good. In 2000, 40,000 new cases of AIDS
were reported. Homicide remains the leading cause of death among
black men 15 to 24 and the second leading cause of death among young
Hispanic men.</TE>
<TE>   Racial Disparity</TE>
<TE>   A black baby born in 2000 is still, on average, likely to live 5.6
fewer years than a white baby. That is an improvement on the
seven-year gap that existed in 1990--but still a significant
difference, said Rosenstock.</TE>
<TE>   And though infant mortality and life expectancy have improved,
this country still lags behind other nations, she said. Of 30
industrialized countries, the United States ranks 23rd in infant
mortality and 12th in male life expectancy.</TE>
<TE>   The study also showed that health care costs are continuing to
rise in the United States. In 2000, America spent $1.3 trillion on
health care, or 13% of the gross domestic product--a 6.9% increase
from the previous year. The cost of drugs has increased 15% each year
from 1995 to 2000.</TE>
<TE>   This presents a huge problem for an aging population--and a
situation that will worsen as the baby boomers age, said Scott
Parkin, spokesman for the Washington-based National Council on the
Aging, a nonprofit group concerned with aging issues. "The cost of
drugs are out of sight and seniors are clamoring for help," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Compounding the problem of increasing costs, more than 40 million
people in this country are uninsured. "We spend almost twice as much
as anyone else, but we are the only one of the industrialized
countries in the world that does not have universal access to health
care," Rosenstock said.</TE>
<TE>   The nation is also heftier than it was prior to the late 1970s.
About 60% of adult Americans are now overweight, as are 13% of
children ages 6 to 11, according to early data. An estimated 40% of
adults say they don't exercise in their leisure time.</TE>
<TE>   "This worries me a lot," said Dr. Ravinder Singh, president of the
Los Angeles chapter of the American Heart Assn. "If we don't change
things, it's going to start swinging back the other way and
incidences of heart disease and stroke are going to increase again."</TE>

<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No. 10 WASHINGTON STATE (2-0)</LD>
<LD>   at No. 6 OHIO STATE (2-0)</LD>
<LD>   Kickoff: 12:30 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   TV: ESPN GamePlan.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Ohio State by 8.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State update: Quarterback Jason Gesser runs the show on
offense, but the new receiving star is Florida State transfer Devard
Darling. Darling and running back Jonathan Smith each scored three
touchdowns in a 49-14 victory over Idaho last week.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State update: Freshman running back Maurice Clarett is
averaging almost 120 yards rushing a game. Craig Krenzel is a
surprising fifth in the nation with a 186.3 quarterback rating.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: This game doesn't have the historical grandeur of
Michigan-Notre Dame, but it's the only clash of top-10 teams this
week.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Ohio State. Although the Buckeyes might be stunned by
the Cougars' speed, Washington State is 0-7 against Ohio State.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 7 MICHIGAN (2-0)</TE>
<TE>   at No. 20 NOTRE DAME (2-0)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 11:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 4.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Michigan by 3 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan update: Michigan has plenty going for it, including
running back Chris Perry and emerging big-play receiver Braylon
Edwards. Biggest worry: The game-winning field goal against
Washington is the only make in six tries this season.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame update: Two victories, zero offensive touchdowns. How
bad is it? Quarterback Carlyle Holiday passed for only 50 yards
against Purdue last week. But the Irish have given up only 8.5 points
and 225.5 yards a game--and yes, the defense knows how to score.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: The feel-good era of new Irish Coach Tyrone Willingham
can't last if the offense doesn't start scoring.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Michigan. Maybe Notre Dame fans should keep those
"Return to Glory" shirts on the shelf a little longer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 17 USC (1-0)</TE>
<TE>   at No. 18 COLORADO (1-1)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 12:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 7.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Colorado by 2 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   USC update: Colorado isn't as good as once imagined, but it's
still a road game against a Big 12 team. Quarterback Carson Palmer
played one of his best games against Auburn, but USC's running game
could use a boost after accumulating only 84 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado update: Robert Hodge takes over at quarterback for Craig
Ochs, who suffered his third concussion in 14 months during a 34-14
victory over San Diego State last week. Receiver Jeremy Bloom has a
broken toe but is practicing and was upgraded from doubtful to
questionable.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Could the Trojans really have a shot at surviving
their opening nonconference run against Auburn, Colorado and Kansas
State?</TE>
<TE>   The pick: USC. Colorado is no No. 6 team anymore, and the
quarterback change adds to its woes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 23 UCLA (1-0)</TE>
<TE>   at OKLAHOMA STATE (1-1)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 4 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Fox Sports Net</TE>
<TE>   Line: UCLA by 7.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA update: Coach Bob Toledo again plans to use freshman Drew
Olson as well as starting quarterback Cory Paus, potentially adding
fuel to a quarterback controversy waiting to boil over. Special teams
are a focal point after a debut that included two missed field goals
and a 55-yard punt return against the Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma State update: The Cowboys lost to Louisiana Tech in their
opener but beat Division I-AA Northern Iowa, 45-10, last week.
Receiver Rashaun Woods has caught 19 passes in two games, nine for
175 yards against Northern Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Oklahoma State beat Oklahoma last season, so the
Cowboys shouldn't be completely discounted. But UCLA has a good
chance to be 2-0.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: UCLA. The Bruins have trouble with November, but
September is their month.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 8 NEBRASKA (3-0)</TE>
<TE>   at PENN STATE (1-0)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 5 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 7.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Nebraska by 5.</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska update: The Cornhuskers didn't prove much with victories
over Arizona State, Troy State and Utah State. Quarterback Jammal
Lord, Eric Crouch's replacement, completed six of 12 passes for 105
yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions and ran for two other
touchdowns in a 44-13 victory over Utah State last week.</TE>
<TE>   Penn State update: After consecutive losing seasons, this would be
a huge upset if the Nittany Lions could pull it off. These programs
haven't met since 1983, when No. 1 Nebraska defeated Penn State,
44-6.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: The Nittany Lions' 1982 national championship team
will be honored at halftime. The old campus sure has changed.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Nebraska. But wouldn't an upset by Penn State be a kick?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 9 GEORGIA (1-0)</TE>
<TE>   at SOUTH CAROLINA (1-1)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 12:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 2.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Georgia by 5.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia update: The Bulldogs have two outstanding
quarterbacks--sophomore David Greene and redshirt freshman D.J.
Shockley--and a budding controversy. Expect both to play. Georgia
struggled a bit last week to beat Clemson, but has a 29-13-2 record
against the Gamecocks.</TE>
<TE>   South Carolina update: Lou Holtz's team dropped out of the top 25
after committing seven turnovers in a 34-21 loss to previously
winless Virginia last week. Six of the turnovers were fumbles, and
two turnovers led to Virginia touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: If you like to watch Holtz squirm, this could be your
game.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Georgia. South Carolina has won the last two meetings,
but hasn't won three in a row in a series that dates to 1894.</TE>

<HD>Mariners' Problems Become Texas-Sized</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Seattle Mariners dug themselves a pretty deep hole in the
American League West and wild-card races by getting swept in a
four-game series by the last-place Texas Rangers.</LD>
<LD>   "We've got to find a way to snap out of this and give ourselves an
eye-opening chance to stay in this thing," Seattle center fielder
Mike Cameron said after Thursday's 7-3 loss at Arlington, Texas.</LD>
<LD>   The Mariners, who hadn't been swept by the Rangers in a four-game
series in 10 years, are seven games behind the Angels and the Oakland
Athletics in the division and wild-card races. The four-game losing
streak matched a season high.</LD>
<TE>   "It's gone as far as it can," Bret Boone said. "It was bad timing
and we never expected it. But there is not time to roll over."</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners, whose last 16 games are against AL West opponents,
begin a three-game series tonight at Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Herbert Perry went three for four, including a pair of RBI
doubles, and Chan Ho Park won his fifth consecutive start to lead the
Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   Park gave up three runs and eight hits over 5 1/3 innings, struck
out seven and walked three.</TE>
<TE>   Park has won all five starts since coming off the disabled list
Aug. 23, being sidelined by a blister on the middle finger of his
pitching hand. Before that, the right-hander hadn't won consecutive
games for the Rangers, who signed Park to a $65 million, five-year
contract last December.</TE>
<TE>   During his streak, Park has a 2.70 earned-run average and 34
strikeouts in 33 1/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 5, Minnesota 4--Omar Vizquel hit a three-run double and
the Indians hung on to defeat the Twins at Cleveland and stall
Minnesota's drive to its first postseason berth since 1991.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins' magic number for clinching the AL Central remained at
three.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland trailed, 3-1, in the seventh when Vizquel doubled off
Joe Mays (3-7) after John McDonald's potential double-play grounder
to shortstop was misplayed by Cristian Guzman. After Ellis Burks'
infield single, Jim Thome had an RBI double.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York 7, Baltimore 3--David Wells (17-7), showing no ill
effects from a diner fight last weekend, defeated the Orioles for the
fourth time this season as the Yankees completed a four-game sweep at
New York.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees cut their magic number for clinching the AL East to
eight.</TE>
<TE>   Wells gave up two runs and seven hits in eight innings, struck out
six and walked none.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Giambi left with a bruised right wrist after being hit by a
pitch, and was listed as day to day.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boston 6, Tampa Bay 3--Carlos Baerga tied the score with a bloop
single in a four-run ninth off Esteban Yan (6-8) and Trot Nixon hit a
go-ahead two-run single to lead the Red Sox at St. Petersburg, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Ugueth Urbina pitched a scoreless ninth for his 34th save. Tim
Wakefield (10-5) gave up one earned run and seven hits in eight
innings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 5, Kansas City 1--Jon Garland (11-11) gave up two hits--a
homer and single to Raul Ibanez--in seven innings and Magglio Ordonez
drove in two runs for the White Sox at Kansas City, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Miguel Asencio (3-6) gave up five runs and 11 hits in 6 1/3
innings.</TE>

<HD>Angel Can Relish Catch-Up Effort</HD>
<DH>Baseball: After Donnelly gives up tying homer, Spiezio's
two-out single beats A's in bottom of ninth, 7-6.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Angels could have spent Thursday evening kicking themselves after
making enough mistakes to lose to the Oakland Athletics at Edison
Field. The Angels instead celebrated a 7-6 victory by pounding on
Scott Spiezio's helmet as a raucous crowd of 31,304 chanted the
infielder's name.</LD>
<LD>   In the final analysis, it didn't particularly matter how the
Angels defeated the A's, merely that they did. The victory was the
Angels' 91st and moved them into a first-place tie with Oakland in
the American League West standings.</LD>
<LD>   The end of the regular season is more than two weeks away, but the
Angels seem to sense greater things are ahead for them. They haven't
been to the playoffs since 1986, faltering in a string of forgettable
Septembers since then.</LD>
<TE>   These Angels, two victories away from duplicating the franchise
record set during 1982's run to the West championship, appear capable
of doing all that's necessary to ensure that there will be baseball
in Anaheim in October.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday that meant rallying from deficits of 1-0 and 5-3 before
pulling out a victory on Spiezio's line drive off the right-field
fence off Oakland closer Billy Koch that scored Darin Erstad from
third base with two out in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   "I was looking for anything over the plate," Spiezio said of
facing Koch. "He supplied most of the power."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Koch entered the tie game to start the ninth and promptly
struck out Benji Gill, then blew two fastballs past Erstad,
pinch-hitting for Alex Ochoa. Manager Mike Scioscia decided to give
Erstad a rest Thursday, offering him a chance to regroup after
falling into an eight-for-41 skid to start September.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad stepped out of the batter's box to better prepare for
Koch's next pitch. He then lined Koch's next offering into the
right-field corner for a double. Erstad then stole third easily,
taking off without prompting from Scioscia.</TE>
<TE>   "Erstad thought the game was going to end pretty soon and he
didn't want to come in with a clean uniform," Scioscia joked. Of
resting Erstad, Scioscia said, "We wanted to clear his head a little
bit and he ended up scoring the winning run."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia also gave closer Troy Percival the night off after using
him in four of the last six games and six of the last eight. It
almost cost the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Holding a 6-5 lead after pinch-hitter Orlando Palmeiro's
run-scoring single in the eighth, Scoscia turned to Brendan Donnelly
to start the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Donnelly got the first two A's he faced, but Eric Chavez sent a
laser over the right-field fence for the tying run. Donnelly walked
Jermaine Dye, but catcher Bengie Molina picked off pinch-runner Eric
Byrnes to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   "I threw [Chavez] a splitter and he fouled it off," Donnelly would
later explain after his first victory. "So I threw him another
one.... Bad location."</TE>
<TE>   The first run given up by their bullpen in 15 innings merely set
the stage for a dramatic, remarkable finish that enabled the Angels
to take three of four games from the A's. The teams play four times
in Oakland beginning Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "We're sitting in a good spot right now with a tie," Spiezio said.
"But we've got a lot of baseball left. Texas is hot. We've got to
focus on them."</TE>
<TE>   The Rangers completed a four-game sweep of the Seattle Mariners,
who failed to gain ground on the Angels for the 17th consecutive day,
dating to Aug. 26. The Mariners trail the Angels and A's by seven
games.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels play host to the Rangers in a three-game series,
starting today, while the A's and Mariners play three at Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Working with a 3-1 lead seemed to put Angel starter Mickey
Callaway at ease until David Justice beat out a slow roller to short
with one out in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Terrence Long then hit the ball back to Callaway, who wheeled to
begin an inning-ending double play. But his throw sailed away from
shortstop David Eckstein and Justice was safe at second.</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein's throw to first almost missed the mark, putting runners
on first and third with one out.</TE>
<TE>   The jam would only get worse for Callaway, making his fourth start
since his recall from the minors Aug. 25. Mark Ellis, Greg Myers, Ray
Durham and Scott Hatteberg delivered hard-hit singles before Callaway
could get the second out of the inning.</TE>
<TE>   By then the Angels trailed, 5-3.</TE>

<LD>The Angels said they plan to begin their own investigation into an
alleged sexual assault by pitcher Jarrod Washburn. The Orange County
district attorney Wednesday declined to file charges against
Washburn, who was under investigation by Anaheim police for 10 days.</LD>
<LD>   "Now that the criminal situation has been decided, we'll certainly
begin an informal investigation," said Tim Mead, Angel vice president
of communications.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels are concerned about any possible security breakdowns at
Edison Field, according to Mead.</LD>

<TE>   Third baseman Troy Glaus returned to the lineup after sitting out
two games because of sprained middle and ring fingers on his left
hand.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Mike Scioscia inserted Glaus into the No. 2 spot in the
order after deciding to give slumping center fielder Darin Erstad a
rest. Erstad, mired in a nine-for-41 skid, was "available" for
pinch-hitting or defensive relief, Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   Of Glaus, Scioscia said, "He's not 100%, but he's well enough to
play."</TE>

<LD>CHICAGO AT ATLANTA</LD>
<LD>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   The line: Atlanta by 3</LD>
<TE>   Quick slant: Georgia Dome makes 2002 debut. They've really spruced
up the place since Chris Chandler left.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: The Bears think they are the NFC's answer to the
Patriots--Chicago went 13-3 last year and is an underdog to a team it
defeated a year ago, 31-3--which, of course, ignores one key
difference between this season and last: Chris Chandler, who started
for the Falcons in that 2001 rout, now backs up Jim Miller in
Chicago. This, in turn, has turned the Atlanta offense over to
Michael Vick, who turned the Green Bay defense inside out during a
37-34 overtime loss. Vick at home? Long may the Bears roam, trying to
catch him.</TE>
<TE>   Stats right: Bears have won six of the last seven games against
Falcons.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Bears Inhale Vick's Vapor Trail"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MIAMI AT INDIANAPOLIS</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Indianapolis by 2 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Is new and improved going to be enough?</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Tony Dungy's defensive overhaul of the Great Sieve of
Indianapolis remains a work in progress. Dungy won his debut as Colt
coach, 28-25 over Jacksonville, but his defense surrendered 343
yards. Next: Old AFC East rival Miami, which scored 49 points against
Detroit last week and totaled 68 points in two victories over
Indianapolis in 2001. Home-field advantage evidently is the reason
the Colts are favored, but they are 0-4 against the Dolphins at home
since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Stats right: Miami has not had a losing season since 1988, but is
5-9 in the playoffs in that span.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "At Least Colts Won't Lose Twice to Dolphins
This Season"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TENNESSEE AT DALLAS</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Tennessee by 3</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: After losing to Houston Present, Cowboys brace for
Houston Past.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Unable to cope with season-opening defeat and national
humiliation, fans in Dallas have begun the rallying cry: Out with
Quincy! In with Chad! (For the record, these are fans of the Dallas
Cowboy Football Team, not the Greater Metroplex Chess Club.) When
your starting quarterback is named Quincy Carter (13 for 30 in the
loss to the Texans), anyone, even a former minor league pitcher named
Chad Hutchinson, starts to sound good.</TE>
<TE>   Stats right: Cowboys have forced only eight turnovers in last
eight games.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Team Formerly Known as Oilers Routs Team
Formerly Known as Cowboys</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DETROIT AT CAROLINA</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Carolina by 3</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: They shoot horses, don't they?</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Bottom feeders of the world, unite! Detroit and Carolina,
the worst teams in the NFL in 2001, meet in the second week of the
2002 season because American football does things differently than
soccer and opted not to relegate Carolina to the Arena League.
Detroit opened the 2001 season with 12 straight losses; Carolina
closed it with 15 consecutive losses. The Panthers, now quarterbacked
by Rodney Peete, finally won last week, 10-7 over Baltimore, while
Detroit held the Dolphins under 50 points in a 49-21 loss.</TE>
<TE>   Stats right: Panthers averaged 15.8 points last season while
finishing 1-15. Last Sunday, they scored 10.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Peete Repeats, 10-7"</TE>
<TE>   * NEW ENGLAND AT NEW YORK JETS</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 2.</TE>
<TE>   The line: New York by 1 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Patriots winning everywhere, except in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: New England's last defeat came before Thanksgiving. Their
10-game winning streak includes victories over St. Louis, Oakland,
Miami, Pittsburgh (twice) and the team favored to beat them today,
the Jets. The bookmakers still refuse to believe, despite two
significant pieces of evidence: 1) This time last year--Week 2, Jets
versus Patriots--Mo Lewis knocked Drew Bledsoe out of the game,
introducing the country to Tom Brady; 2) Vinny Testaverde turns 39 in
two months.</TE>
<TE>   Stats right: Jets were outgained, 381-269, in win over Buffalo
last Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Pats Beat Jets, Beat Bookies, Who Are Beating
a Dead Horse"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   GREEN BAY AT NEW ORLEANS</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Green Bay by 2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Brett Favre runs into another guy he ran out of town.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Kurt Warner, Mark Brunell, Aaron Brooks ... you could stock
a Pro Bowl with ex-Packer quarterbacks who have come and gone during
Favre's Lambeau residency. Brooks, drafted by Green Bay in 1999 and
dispatched to New Orleans in 2000, remembers telling Favre, "I can
play in this league; I'm going to be a star." Favre told Brooks to
just be patient and it would happen. Brooks: "Brett was right. Here I
am." And there he goes, back to .500 after Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Stats right: Packers have allowed more than 140 yards rushing in
five consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Favre to Brooks: Patience Is a Virtue"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CINCINNATI AT CLEVELAND</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Cleveland by 4 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: The name is Rudd. As in mud.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Five days have passed and still, the game plan remains the
same for Brown linebacker Dwayne Rudd: It's not smart being seen in
Cleveland without your helmet. Given the scouting report on Brown
fans--armed, will throw deep--Rudd had best keep the protective gear
on after last Sunday's Mistake by the Lake. "It was like one of those
big, 'Oops, my bad,' " Rudd said by way of apology. Sounds like the
working title for the Browns' 2002 just-missed-the-playoffs highlight
film.</TE>
<TE>   Stats right: Bengal quarterbacks have thrown for four touchdowns
and 19 interceptions in their last 10 games.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "There's Dumb and There's Dumber; Browns 34,
Bengals 9."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   JACKSONVILLE AT KANSAS CITY</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Kansas City by 4</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: How many extra downs do the Chiefs get this week?</TE>
<TE>   Plot: The Chiefs are 1-0 with a disclaimer the size of Lake Erie.
Kansas City was losing to Cleveland despite having scored 37 points
against the Brown defense when Cleveland linebacker Dwayne Rudd threw
his helmet to celebrate a victory that wasn't quite. Browns were
penalized 15 yards, Chiefs were given another play with 0:00 on the
clock--and Chiefs won on a field goal, 40-39. And now Kansas City
gets the Jaguars at home. The lucky breaks never end.</TE>
<TE>   Stats right: Chiefs, who scored 40 points in Week 1, didn't score
40 for the season until Week 3 last year.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Better to Be Lucky Than Good? Jags Would
Settle for Either"</TE>

<TE>   TAMPA BAY AT BALTIMORE</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Tampa Bay by 3 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Redman versus Red Man.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Jon Gruden's face turned 18 shades of scarlet during his
second early wakeup call last Sunday, a 20-16 home loss to the
Saints. Gruden should be able to relax Sunday. Raven quarterback
Chris Redman played poorly in his first NFL start, a 10-7 loss to
Carolina. Silver lining for Redman: The last quarterback to start
against the Panthers and lose? Daunte Culpepper, Week 1, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Stats right: The Ravens have allowed 27 offensive touchdowns in
their last 15 games (8-7) dating to '01, after having given up only
11 offensive touchdowns in their previous 15 contests (14-1).</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "No One's Raven About Redman"</TE>

<TE>   ARIZONA AT SEATTLE</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Seattle by 3 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Paging St. Trent.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: He who laughs last laughs best, even if he has to go to work
on Sundays dressed in something called "Seahawk blue." Trent Dilfer
has come full circle and then some--from season-salvaging savior in
Baltimore when Tony Banks hit the rocks, to the Worst Quarterback to
Ever Win the Super Bowl, to Brian Billick's ejector seat, to second
string behind Matt Hasselbeck, to the most popular athlete in Seattle
not born in Japan. Fans are hopeful for big things from Dilfer, who
is back in the lineup after his early August knee injury. Failing
that, a victory over Arizona will suffice.</TE>
<TE>   Stats right: Dilfer is 15-0 in his last 15 starts.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Dilfer Settles Seahawk Ship, Closes Gap on
Ichiro"</TE>

<TE>   NEW YORK GIANTS AT ST. LOUIS</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 11</TE>
<TE>   The line: St. Louis by 12 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Once were kings.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: A matchup between the 2000 and 2001 NFC champions, and a
most curious betting spread. The Rams, counting exhibitions, are 0-6
since January's NFC championship game, including last Sunday's 23-16
upset by Denver. Meanwhile, the Giants held San Francisco to one
touchdown and 279 yards, lost on a late field goal and start this
game on nine days' rest. What that says about the Giant offense minus
Tiki Barber, hobbled by toe and hamstring injuries, Ron (No Gain)
Dayne probably doesn't want to know.</TE>
<TE>   Stats right: The Giants have lost 10 of their last 14 games.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Which Ex-Champ Is in Big Trouble? They Might
Be Giants"</TE>

<TE>   HOUSTON AT SAN DIEGO</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: San Diego by 12 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Texans fly from Houston to San Diego via Cloud 9.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Now that the expansion Texans have won their debut--having
stunned the Cowboys, the league and, let's face it, themselves--what
do they do with their next 15 games? San Diego also won somewhat
unexpectedly, 34-6 at Cincinnati, and starts a young quarterback not
much older than Houston's David Carr. But here's the difference: The
Chargers have been around awhile and they have a coach, Marty
Schottenheimer, who has them grounded. At least until they pick up
stakes and try to outrace the Colts to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Stats right: The Texans totaled only 201 yards in their upset of
the Cowboys in Week 1.</TE>

<TE>   BUFFALO AT MINNESOTA</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Minnesota by 5</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Sooner or later, someone's luck is bound to change.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Buffalo and Minnesota deserved better in their openers but
lost because the Bills couldn't cover kickoffs and Viking quarterback
Daunte Culpepper couldn't keep the ball out of Chicago safety Mike
Brown's hands. After the Jets' Chad Morton returned two kicks for
scores, Buffalo special teams coach Danny Smith said, "I apologize to
our football team, I apologize to the Buffalo Bills organization, I
apologize to our fans." Culpepper said: "I owe the team one." In the
NFL, winning is never having to say you're sorry.</TE>
<TE>   Stats right: Buffalo running back Larry Centers has caught a pass
in 137 consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Vikings Edge Bills in Sorry Affair"</TE>

<TE>   DENVER AT SAN FRANCISCO</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 2.</TE>
<TE>   The line: San Francisco by 3 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Touchdowns speak louder than words.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Denver's secondary held the Rams' Kurt Warner to less than
10 yards a completion last week. San Francisco wide receiver Terrell
Owens is less than impressed. "Unless they're like Shaq, I don't
really think I'll have a problem," Owens said. Owens needs to talk
less and reflect more upon his stat sheet. In the 49er opener, Owens
caught four passes for 41 yards. Take away the 33-yard catch that set
up the winning field goal and it would appear he had a few problems.</TE>
<TE>   Stats right: The Broncos have alternated losses and wins for 12
consecutive games.</TE>

<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 5:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: ESPN</TE>
<TE>   The line: Pittsburgh by 4</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Meet the new coach, not the same as the old coach.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Yes, life in Oakland has proceeded without Jon Gruden. In
fact, Al Davis has enjoyed few weeks better than the last one, with
Gruden losing his Tampa Bay opener and Gruden's replacement, Bill
Callahan, debuting with a 31-17 trouncing of Seattle. Callahan's
quite the slacker--he rises every morning at 5:30, more than two
hours after Gruden--but then, he's in charge of a bunch of old men
who need their rest.</TE>
<TE>   Stats right: Game features Notre Dame's all-time NFL rusher
(Steelers' Jerome Bettis; 10,911 yards) and all-time NFL receiving
yards leader (Raiders' Tim Brown; 13,283 yards).</TE>

<TE>   PHILADELPHIA AT WASHINGTON</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Monday, 6 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 7</TE>
<TE>   The line: Philadelphia by 3</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Steve Spurrier in prime time. How many times do we
have to remind: Don't encourage him.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Last week Spurrier cut his right middle finger while angrily
ripping the headset from his ears after backup quarterback Danny
Wuerffel was forced to pinch-kick for the injured Brett Conway.
Spurrier vowed that would never happen again, so he got a foam
bandage for his finger and another kicker, James Tuthill. Because if
the Redskins do kick off to the Eagles more than once, Spurrier can't
deal with any more of those dang squibs.</TE>
<TE>   Stats right: Redskins, who scored 31 points last week, scored more
than 30 points only twice last season.</TE>

<HD>Bonds Ball Case Will Go to Trial</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A jury will decide who gets the ball Barry Bonds hit for his record
73rd homer.</LD>
<LD>   Two men have claimed ownership of the ball, which has an estimated
value of $1 million, and each wants Judge James J. McBride to grant
him possession without a trial.</LD>
<LD>   But in a decision received by lawyers Thursday, McBride rejected
the claims of both Alex Popov--who briefly got a glove on the ball
before a mob tackled him in the bleachers of Pacific Bell Park--and
Patrick Hayashi, who grabbed the ball amid the chaos.</LD>
<TE>   McBride ruled there is a question whether Popov actually
controlled the ball in his glove, and that a jury should determine
the answer. The ball is now in a court-monitored safe.</TE>
<TE>   The case will resume before another judge Oct. 7, exactly one year
after the San Francisco Giants' slugger hit the last homer of his
record-setting season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore Oriole reliever Yorkis Perez had an appendectomy early
Thursday and will miss the rest of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Perez, who pitched against New York on Tuesday, felt ill during
Wednesday night's game at Yankee Stadium and left the ballpark. After
tests at a hospital, he had the procedure.</TE>
<TE>   Perez is expected to be released from the hospital by this
weekend. The left-hander is 0-0 with one save and a 3.29 earned-run
average in 23 games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   John Wetteland, the Texas Rangers' all-time saves leader, was
hired by the team as a pitching instructor.</TE>
<TE>   Wetteland's first assignment will be to spend three weeks in the
team's instructional league program that begins next week in
Surprise, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   The 36-year-old Wetteland, a former Dodger who last pitched in
2000, was 48-45 with a 2.93 ERA and 330 saves in 618 games.</TE>

<LD>E.S. Armstrong of Houston won a $75,225 judgment because the Baseball
U.S.A. team, whose field was next to his home, kept him up late at
night and knocked two balls through his bedroom window.</LD>
<LD>   Not content to take the $225 in broken-glass damages, Armstrong
went to court and hit for the cycle, adding another $10,000 for loss
of enjoyment of his property, $40,000 for loss of use, and $25,000
for mental anguish.</LD>
<LD>   Pretty good compensation for losing a little sleep.</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who was the first player in the 20th century to hit
four home runs in a major league game?</TE>
<TE>   Passing the buck: Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig was in a minor
car accident in Milwaukee this week.</TE>
<TE>   "Apparently, it was just a fender-bender," said Keith Olbermann of
ABC Radio. "Besides which, under the new collective bargaining
agreement, any repairs have to paid for by George Steinbrenner."</TE>
<TE>   Grappling with an idea: Tom FitzGerald in the San Francisco
Chronicle: "NBC will air a new reality series called 'Adrenaline X,'
in which extreme athletes compete in various events.</TE>
<TE>   "The competitors will be wired with heart-rate monitors, helmet
cameras and body microphones. An intriguing idea, but why not take
the next step right now? Lie detectors on pro wrestlers."</TE>
<TE>   Real clout: Ron Rapoport in the Chicago Sun-Times: "Dolphin
defensive end Adewale Ogunleye has one of the most imposing names in
the league and an ancestry to match. His great-great-grandfather was
a Nigerian warlord, and his family still controls a 100-square-mile
area of the country.</TE>
<TE>   " 'I remember in second grade, I did something wrong in school,
and my teacher beat me,' Ogunleye's father, Gabriel, told the South
Florida Sun-Sentinel. 'So I went home, told my mother and they sent a
police officer and arrested the teacher at school for beating the son
of a king.' "</TE>
<TE>   Some real Whoppers: "In Mitch Albom's book on the Fab Five, Chris
Webber whined about the money the school was making selling his
jerseys while he barely had enough for fast food," said Pat Forde of
the Louisville Courier-Journal. "Chris apparently has expensive taste
in burgers."</TE>
<TE>   Triple whammy: ESPN.com's Jayson Stark reports that Florida Marlin
pitcher Julian Tavarez uncorked the baseball equivalent of a magic
bullet, throwing a pitch whose ricochets left the batter (Milwaukee's
Richie Sexson), catcher (Ramon Castro) and plate umpire (Greg Gibson)
all writhing on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Said Marlin infielder Andy Fox: "I was just hoping we had enough
trainers for all the injured people."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Lou Gehrig of the New York Yankees against
Philadelphia on June 3, 1932.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Mark Kiszla in the Denver Post on 49er receiver
Terrell Owens: "So much trash is spewed from his lips that Owens
should be declared toxic dump No. 81. Three days and 1,000 miles away
from the Denver Broncos' game in San Francisco, you can smell him
from here.</TE>
<TE>   "Owens, who ran free and wild on Denver during the preseason,
warned that unless the Broncos have acquired a cornerback as big and
ornery as Laker center Shaquille O'Neal, there is no player who can
cause him any difficulty.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Unless they're like Shaq, I don't really feel like I have a
problem,' Owens said."</TE>

<LD>Kevin Jones and Lee Suggs each ran for more than 150 yards and
combined for five touchdowns as No. 11 Virginia Tech stymied Byron
Leftwich and No. 16 Marshall in a 47-21 victory Thursday night at
Blacksburg, Va.</LD>
<LD>   Playing rugged defense and challenging the Thundering Herd (1-1)
to stop the running game, the Hokies (3-0) led, 33-0, before Leftwich
could get his team on the scoreboard in the fourth quarter.</LD>
<LD>   The Hokies ran for 396 yards and six touchdowns. Jones gained 171
yards, scoring on runs of 25 yards, 15 yards and one yard, and Suggs
had 153 yards with two one-yard scoring dives.</LD>
<TE>   Leftwich, burned by a sure touchdown pass that was dropped and
another that could have been caught, regrouped to throw for 406 yards
and three touchdowns. All three scoring passes came in the last 12
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The Heisman Trophy hopeful was 31 for 49 and extended his string
of 400-yard games to five. The Thundering Herd managed only 34 yards
rushing.</TE>

<HD>Dele's Boat Found in Tahiti</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: No sign of missing former NBA player or two
others. Catamaran had been docked since July 8.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LANCE PUGMIRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The catamaran belonging to missing former NBA player Bison Dele has
been found docked in the Tahitian town of Taravao, a French police
official said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Military and civilian police were expected to begin an
investigation aboard the boat, Hakuna Matata, after receiving
permission to board the craft from a French magistrate. It had been
docked at the site since July 8, police said.</LD>
<LD>   When it was found, Hakuna Matata--a line from Disney's "Lion King"
that translates to "no worries"--had been painted over and replaced
by the name Arabella, a family source said.</LD>
<TE>   FBI officials in San Francisco dispatched a forensics team to
Tahiti on Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   The boat's occupants--Dele, formerly known as Brian Williams; his
girlfriend, Serena Karlan; and captain Bertrand Saldo--are still
missing. So is the subject of an FBI manhunt, Dele's older brother,
Miles Dabord, also known as Kevin Eugene Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Patrique Humbert, a charter boat captain and friend of Saldo,
found the boat. Humbert resides in the neighboring French Polynesian
island of Moorea, where friends say they last saw Dele, Karlan and
Saldo.</TE>
<TE>   Contacted by telephone, Humbert said, "I have nothing to say and
nothing to do with this. It's under police control now."</TE>
<TE>   Taravao is located on the southeast side of Tahiti, about 50 miles
opposite the northwest town of Papeete, where the boat was logged in
July 4.</TE>
<TE>   Karlan was the last person aboard to make contact with relatives
on the mainland. She sent an e-mail that was received by her mother
in Boulder, Colo., during the early-morning hours on July 7.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI has instructed Dele's mother, Patricia Phillips, and
Karlan's parents not to discuss the case with reporters for the next
five to six days.</TE>
<TE>   Reached at the family's home in Colorado, Scott Ohlgren, Karlan's
stepfather, was buoyed by the boat's discovery.</TE>
<TE>   "Now they can get all the people who were looking for the boat to
look for the three missing people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In its search for Dabord, the bureau raided a Tijuana hotel room
officers believed Dabord stayed in as recently as Wednesday. Dabord
was not in the room and remained, "not apprehended, and possibly
still in Mexico," according to an FBI source.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI would not reveal what evidence was discovered in the hotel
room. On Wednesday, Dabord's car was impounded by the FBI in Santa
Clara County.</TE>
<TE>   Dabord, 35, sailed with Dele, 33, and Karlan, 30, through early
July. On Sept. 5, Dabord appeared at a Phoenix coin establishment,
Certified Mint, and attempted to purchase $152,000 in gold with a
check from Brian Williams'--Dele's--account. Dabord signed his name
"Brian Williams" and displayed his younger brother's passport as
identification before being brought into police custody.</TE>
<TE>   He was released early the next morning without being arrested.
Kevin Porter, Dele's personal assistant, told Dele and Karlan's
parents that Dabord purchased a plane ticket to San Jose on Sept. 6.
Porter has not returned phone calls to the Phoenix residence where he
is staying.</TE>
<TE>   Estranged from his mother since January 1999, Dabord called
Phillips on Wednesday and threatened suicide. Phillips said Thursday
night she had not heard from Dabord again.</TE>
<TE>   "I just assumed when that call ended that it was the last time I
would talk to him," Phillips said. "I told him I couldn't do anything
about our past, but that I could do something that moment, and that
was to convey my love to him."</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Go Flat at Coors, Lose, 7-1</HD>
<DH>Baseball: They get only three hits in a listless
performance at ballpark where they had averaged 8.5 runs a game this
year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Coors Field has yielded a bounty of runs for the Dodgers, who scored
51 times in six previous games in Colorado this season, batting .315
with seven home runs.</LD>
<LD>   Thursday night, the place felt like Coors Lite.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers managed only three hits and looked rather listless in
a 7-1 loss to the Rockies before a crowd that was announced at 25,593
but felt and sounded about half that size.</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers, who have 16 games remaining, remained tied atop the
National League wild-card standings with the San Francisco Giants.
The Giants lost, 3-2, to the San Diego Padres in 10 innings Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it was the thunderstorm that delayed the game for 53
minutes, or the library-like feel of the sparse crowd after playing
three games against the Giants in the playoff-charged atmosphere of
Pacific Bell Park this week, but the Dodgers seemed flat Thursday
night.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie right-hander Denny Stark was impressive, giving up one run
and two hits and striking out three in seven innings to improve to
10-3, including 8-1 at home, but this was not Curt Schilling or Roy
Oswalt on the mound.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers failed to pressure Stark, and outside of Shawn Green's
home run in the seventh inning, they advanced only one runner to
second base--Dave Roberts in the first inning.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts singled and stole second but was stranded when Paul Lo
Duca and Green struck out and Brian Jordan grounded out.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an emotional series in San Francisco, and coming to an
empty park is a bit of a letdown, but every guy here realizes what's
at stake," Roberts said. "You don't want to admit you had a letdown,
because when you're in a pennant race, you want to come out with full
intensity. But Stark threw a good game, they made a lot of great
plays, and we couldn't get anything going."</TE>
<TE>   Colorado is mathematically eliminated from the playoffs, but it
was the Rockies, not the Dodgers, who looked like postseason
contenders, coming up with several clutch hits and stifling the
Dodgers with superb defensive plays.</TE>
<TE>   Left fielder Ben Petrick made a spectacular diving catch of Lo
Duca's drive to the gap, robbing him of extra bases in the fourth
inning; center fielder Jason Romano slammed into the wall as he
caught Mark Grudzielanek's drive in the fifth, and second baseman
Terry Shumpert made a nice leaping catch of Lo Duca's liner in the
sixth.</TE>
<TE>   For good measure, Petrick made a nice running catch of Green's
high fly ball to left-center, leaping to avoid a collision with
center fielder Juan Pierre as he snagged the ball for the game's
final out.</TE>
<TE>   "They made some of the best defensive plays against us that we've
seen all year," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   "Stark pitched a good game, but he got some help."</TE>
<TE>   Offensively, the Rockies had little trouble solving left-hander
Omar Daal, who went 4-0 with a 1.87 earned-run average in eight
starts from July 20 to Aug. 31 but has been hit hard in his last two
starts.</TE>
<TE>   Daal gave up four runs and nine hits in 4 2/3 innings of a 6-1
loss to Houston last Saturday and five runs and seven hits in 3 2/3
innings Thursday night. He struck out three of the first four Rockies
he faced, but his outing deteriorated quickly from there.</TE>
<TE>   A single by the .231-hitting Shumpert, a walk to the .160-hitting
Petrick and an RBI single by .226-hitting Juan Uribe gave Colorado a
1-0 lead in the second. The Rockies added three runs in the third on
Gabe Kapler's double, Todd Helton's RBI single, walks to Shumpert and
Petrick and Sandy Alomar's two-run single.</TE>
<TE>   When Stark smoked a double into the left-field corner to lead off
the fourth, Daal stood on the mound, his hands on his hips, watching
the ball in disgust. Stark later scored on Todd Zeile's single for a
5-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Green's 42nd home run of the season made it 5-1 in the top of the
seventh, but the Rockies got that run back and more when Shumpert
homered off reliever Giovanni Carrara in the seventh and Kapler hit
an RBI single off Robert Ellis in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   "Without question, our fate is in the hands of our pitching and
defense," Roberts said. "But it's too much to ask for each [starter]
to have a great outing every time out.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes you've got to put up some runs and cover their backs."</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Ishii Is Sidelined for Season</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii, who suffered a fractured skull when he was
hit in the head by a line drive Sunday in Dodger Stadium, is
scheduled to be released from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center today, but
Manager Jim Tracy said the left-hander will not pitch again this
season or in the postseason, if the Dodgers reach the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   "When you see the type of injury he had, you can't just run him
back out to the mound," Tracy said. "There will be some hurdles he
has to get over, just like Mike Mussina and Bryce Florie [who were
hit in the face by comebackers in recent years] had to clear."</LD>
<LD>   Ishii, who went 14-10 with a 4.27 earned-run average in his first
major league season, underwent surgery Monday in which a titanium
plate was inserted at the top of his skull to repair a section of his
sinus cavity. He also suffered a concussion, but there was no damage
or infection in the brain.</LD>
<TE>   According to Dr. John Yu, who performed the surgery, Ishii's
neurological functions and vital signs are normal, and he has been
walking and eating without limitations. Yu expects a full recovery.</TE>
<TE>   "I regret causing concern with this incident, but I am currently
doing well in my recovery," Ishii said in a prepared release. "At
this point in the season, with the standings the way they are, I hope
I have not troubled the team by this occurrence. I am also very
disappointed that I am not able to compete with my teammates as we
close out the season."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Team officials were fuming about two anonymous quotes, attributed
to members of the Dodger organization and appearing in a San
Francisco Chronicle column Thursday, that questioned the Dodgers'
playoff chances.</TE>
<TE>   The quotes, as they appeared in the Chronicle: "I would never say
this publicly," said one of the most respected men in the
organization, "but we're done." Added another: "We'll never beat the
Giants. We don't have the pitching."</TE>
<TE>   Though they don't expect to finger the author of the quotes, the
Dodgers plan to launch an internal inquiry into the matter.</TE>
<TE>   "I find it hard to believe anyone said that," said Derrick Hall,
senior vice president of communications. "However, if they did, I can
tell you they are definitely not well-respected, and they don't know
what they're talking about. It's disappointing to think someone is on
the road with this team and doesn't believe in the team."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers went .500 in coin tosses Thursday, winning a flip with
Houston but losing one with San Francisco to determine home-field
advantage should a one-game playoff be needed to determine the
National League wild-card winner.</TE>
<TE>   If the Dodgers and Astros, who entered Thursday's game 5 1/2 games
back in the wild-card race, finish tied for the lead, they would play
Monday, Sept. 30, in Dodger Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants may have to make up a game in Atlanta on Sept. 30 if it
has a bearing on the standings. If that result forces a tie between
the Giants and Dodgers, the teams would play Tuesday, Oct. 1, in
Pacific Bell Park, with the winner traveling to Atlanta to begin the
division series the next day.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Kevin Brown, who gave up five runs and six hits in
five innings of Tuesday night's 5-2 loss to San Francisco, received
an epidural injection Thursday to treat residual soreness in the area
of his lower back where he underwent June 11 surgery for a herniated
disk.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, who will remain in Southern California over the weekend,
was scheduled to pitch Tuesday night against the Giants, but Tracy
pushed his start back to Wednesday night so Brown could work out in
the bullpen Monday under the supervision of pitching coach Jim
Colborn. Left-hander Omar Daal will start Tuesday.</TE>

<KH>OSCAR DE LA HOYA VS. FERNANDO VARGAS</KH>
<HD>Ferocious Approach</HD>
<DH>Contrary to Vargas' way of thinking, it's not a fight to
the death</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Randy Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>In the early '70s, "El Topo," The Mole, became a cult film on college
campuses for reasons I don't recall. I do recall a scene in which two
boxers entered a ring constructed on the dusty main street of a small
town in Mexico, a "High Noon" setting, with barbed wire wrapped
around their gloves.</LD>
<LD>   When the bell rang, they proceeded to beat each other until they
collapsed simultaneously into pools of blood and sweat. The crowd
gathered to revel in the gore was hushed as the referee bent to
listen for a heartbeat of one fighter, then the other.</LD>
<LD>   "This one died first," he finally announced, raising the hand of
the other in victory.</LD>
<TE>   The crowd erupted in celebration.</TE>
<TE>   Fernando Vargas should see that scene. Perhaps then he would
realize that the only people who have an absolute investment in what
occurs in the ring Saturday night at the Mandalay Bay Events Center
are he, Oscar De La Hoya and their families.</TE>
<TE>   I bring this up because of a comment Vargas made Wednesday morning
while sitting with a few reporters in the living room of his hotel
suite.</TE>
<TE>   "I would rather die in that ring on Sept. 14 than lose to him," he
said of De La Hoya.</TE>
<TE>   That's a useful quote to put on the wall of the media center as
part of the promotion for a fight billed as "Bad Blood," alongside
the one from Vargas' co-manager, Rolando Arellano, saying that De La
Hoya is about the enter the "caves of hell" and dance with the devil
or from De La Hoya saying, "I really hate this guy.'"</TE>
<TE>   But there was something about the tone in Vargas' voice, his
earnestness during a revealing hourlong interview, that made it clear
his declaration was not intended as part of the pre-fight hype.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   How can you tell these days when a boxer is baring his soul? With
Vargas, the realization came when he was asked about his relationship
with his two children, Fernando Jr., 5, and Amado, 2. He tried to
answer, but the words got stuck in his throat. His eyes welled with
tears.</TE>
<TE>   The first time I met Vargas was in 1995 in Argentina. He was the
youngest member of the U.S. Pan American Games boxing team and, an
official with the U.S. delegation told me, the best. The day I talked
to Vargas, he was wearing a T-shirt that read, "I'm Not Scared, I'm
Not Afraid, I'm Tough, I'm an Animal and I Will Eat You If I Have
To." I thought he was a punk.</TE>
<TE>   That opinion, in my mind, was confirmed after he and friends were
charged in an assault in 1999 in Summerland. He pleaded no contest
and earlier this year served 90 days under house arrest. He remains
on probation.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that episode served as the signal he needed that it was time
for him to become a responsible citizen and parent. Maybe not. Maybe
he will find trouble again.</TE>
<TE>   But, on Wednesday, he seemed more mature when talking about his
aspirations for providing a stable home for his fiancee and children.
They recently moved to an upscale subdivision in Camarillo, where, he
says, he is not tempted by the "homies" from his unruly youth in
Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was young, I used to get crazy a little," he said. "Now
I've got a family. I'm thinking about them going to Princeton or
Harvard or Yale. I want them to be better than their dad. All their
dad can do is fight."</TE>
<TE>   He had no positive role model as a parent. His father abandoned
him. His relationship with his mother and his stepfather was strained
at best. He is having to figure out his adult priorities for himself.</TE>
<TE>   Shelly Finkel, his other co-manager, said Vargas' children have
helped him with that.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me once, 'I never had it before, but my children give me
unconditional love. They love me because I'm me.' "</TE>
<TE>   So Vargas gets emotional when he talks about his boys.</TE>
<TE>   Therein lies the conflict. If his family is so important to him,
if it is so essential for him to be there for his boys when they grow
up, unlike his own father was for him, how does he reconcile that
with the proclamation that he would rather die than lose a
prizefight?</TE>
<TE>   When someone asked him that Wednesday, he fidgeted for a moment.
It was clear that he had not thought this through. When he finally
answered, he said he would do it for the fans who expect him to lay
it all on the line.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're in there, you're fighting for them," he said. "I'd
rather give up my life in the ring than let them down. That's the
difference in a coward and a real man."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Similarly afflicted with chronic machismo, Hemingway, in "Death in
the Afternoon," wrote about a bullfighter's "growing ecstasy of
ordered, forced, passionate, increasing disregard for death."</TE>
<TE>   James Michener read that and said Hemingway sounded like "a
star-struck little boy."</TE>
<TE>   Vargas said Wednesday that he is 24 "going on 30-something." But
there are times when he is still only 24.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya, 29, who discovered a long time ago that the real sport
in boxing is in not getting hit, was asked Wednesday about Vargas'
comment.</TE>
<TE>   "Boxing is a brutal sport and you have to give it your all," he
said. "But dying in the ring is ridiculous. Who wants to die in the
ring? It's very naive of him. It's one thing to get knocked down and
get back up. I've done that before. But dying in the ring, I would
never do."</TE>
<TE>   That is the sort of response that leads Vargas to charge that De
La Hoya is not passionate about boxing. It also leads Vargas to claim
that fans, especially Mexican American fans, prefer him, even though
both he and De La Hoya are Mexican Americans. Vargas operates under
an ill-defined, unproven assumption that Mexican American fans can be
proud of their heroes only if they fight to the finish, consequences
be damned.</TE>
<TE>   But there is nothing courageous about dying in the ring. In fact,
if Vargas' assumption about some fans is true, it is more courageous
to walk away from a beating. Fans who expect him to do otherwise are
not his fans.</TE>
<TE>   The sooner he learns that, the better off his two little boys will
be. Imagine how proud they will be if he is in the audience when they
graduate from Princeton or Harvard or Yale.</TE>

<TE>   A 14-year-old football player collapsed and briefly lost
consciousness Thursday during a freshman-sophomore game at Encino
Crespi.</TE>
<TE>   The player was airlifted to Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, where
a spokesman said he was in fair and stable condition.</TE>
<TE>   The 235-pound teenager had been involved in some plays when he
grabbed his chest and fell to the ground, a spokesman for the L.A.
Fire Dept. said. Paramedics reported the player, who was unconscious
for about two minutes, later complained of shortness of breath, back
pain and abdominal pain.</TE>
<TE>   Childrens Hospital planned to keep the player overnight for
observation. The cause of the problem is undetermined.</TE>

<LD>Compton Dominguez High had the speed advantage Thursday night against
Anaheim Esperanza, but it was the Aztecs that pulled away in the
second half and won, 38-14, in a nonleauge, season-opening game at
Placentia Valencia High.</LD>
<LD>   Esperanza, ranked 24th by The Times, scored 38 unanswered points
beginning late in the second quarter.</LD>
<LD>   The Aztecs seemed to benefit from better conditioning, the result
of a rugged program instituted in the offseason. Esperanza's lack of
stamina was a factor last season when it had a losing record for the
first time in 16 years, said running back Shaun Wildenstein.</LD>
<TE>   "Last year, conditioning was a problem," said Wildenstein, who
rushed for 103 of his 137 yards in the second half before leaving
with a right knee injury. "In the third and fourth quarters, we were
really out of shape."</TE>
<TE>   Esperanza quarterback Rick Taloa, who suffered a stress fracture
in his foot in the season opener last year and missed the rest of the
season, completed three of his first 13 passes, but a 49-yard strike
to Jason Thompson with just under two minutes remaining in the first
half got the Aztecs past midfield for the first time. On the next
play, Taloa connected with Adam Hill on an 18-yard touchdown pass.</TE>
<TE>   Esperanza got the ball back at midfield with 21 seconds remaining
and Thompson's 22-yard reception set up a 42-yard field goal by
Brandon Weiner as time expired.</TE>
<TE>   The Aztecs took a 17-14 lead on the opening drive of the second
half, marching 65 yards in 10 plays and scoring on a five-yard run by
Steve Kretschmar.</TE>
<TE>   Dominguez, ranked 25th, recovered a fumble by Wildenstein at the
Esperanza 37, but gave it back two plays later on a fumble.</TE>
<TE>   Wildenstein hurt his knee on the ensuing series, but Eric Lyman
took his spot and scored a minute later on a 15-yard touchdown run.
Lyman added two more touchdown runs.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Arritt</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Mater Dei 21, Orange Lutheran 20--The heavily favored
Monarchs broke up a two-point conversion pass in the closing seconds
to claim the nonleague victory at Santa Ana Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The Lancers, two-time Division XI runners-up who moved into the
Empire League and Division VI this season, outgained Mater Dei,
390-266 yards, and outrushed them, 328-186.</TE>
<TE>   No. 7 Mater Dei (1-0) had taken a 7-0 lead on the opening drive on
a four-yard scoring pass from Jessie Mier to Robert Della Grotta, and
on its next possession, Tim Chicoine put a punt inside the Lancer
one-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   Seventeen plays and 99 yards later, Lutheran (0-1) had the tying
touchdown as well as a good measure of respect when quarterback Casey
Whieldon ran in from a yard out. Twice more the Monarchs scored, and
twice more Lutheran answered.</TE>
<TE>   A Whieldon-to-Anthony Vernaglia touchdown pass closed the gap to
21-20 with three seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   John Ausmus led the Lancer rushing attack with 206 yards in 18
carries. Whieldon struggled with his passing in the first half,
missing on nine of his first 12 attempts, but ran the option to
perfection and finished with 44 yards on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Mater Dei was led by Mier, who ran for 87 yards and threw for 65
more.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Maddy</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Santa Margarita 17, Orange El Modena 10--Sophomore quarterback
Mark Sanchez completed his first varsity pass to Bobby Whithorne for
a 55-yard touchdown on the first play of the fourth quarter to put
No. 9 Santa Margarita ahead for good during the nonleague victory.</TE>
<TE>   Whithorne took the pass over the middle at the El Modena 35-yard
line and sprinted into the end zone to make it 14-10. Will Johnson
tacked on a 25-yard field goal midway through the fourth quarter to
set the final margin.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Margarita (1-0) staved off two late Vanguard drives by
forcing a fumble and intercepting a pass to preserve the victory.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Margarita running back Ashton White finished with 86 yards
and a touchdown in 27 carries.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Dixon, who caught the Santa Margarita defense off guard by
running out of the wing-T formation on occasion, had 160 yards and a
touchdown in 28 carries for El Modena (0-1).</TE>
<TE>   Ben Bolch</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo 48, Fountain Valley 0--Senior Josh Rodarmel
completed six of nine passes for 103 yards and touchdowns of 20 yards
to Clark Hardman and 32 yards to Taylor Holiday before leaving the
game with four minutes left in the first half with a broken
collarbone for the No. 6 Diablos (1-0) in a nonleague game at Mission
Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   Alta Loma 35, Covina Charter Oak 31--Greg Holt scored on a
one-yard run with 1:26 to play to give the Braves a nonleague victory
over the No. 16 Chargers at Chaffey College.</TE>
<TE>   Charter Oak took a 31-28 lead when Michael Perri threw a 25-yard
touchdown pass to Rafael Falcon. It was Perri's third consecutive
completion on the scoring drive.</TE>

<LD>The Indy Racing League, which has produced the closest wheel-to-wheel
finishes in racing this year, is closing its season with a similar
finish.</LD>
<LD>   After 14 races, Sam Hornish Jr. holds a 12-point lead over Helio
Castroneves heading for the season finale Sunday, the Chevy 500 at
Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth. Fifty-two points are at stake in
the race.</LD>
<LD>   The rival drivers agree that the race--and the championship--will
probably not be decided until the last lap or two after 200 trips
around the 1.5-mile oval. That has been the pattern in IRL races this
season.</LD>
<TE>   Hornish, the defending series champion, took the lead from
Castroneves, the Indianapolis 500 winner, Sunday at Chicagoland when
he edged Al Unser Jr. by .0024 of a second--about three inches--after
200 laps to win the Delphi Indy 300. It was the seventh IRL race this
season that had been won by less than a second.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to Texas to win the race because we know if we do
that, the title will take care of itself," said Hornish, 23, of
Defiance, Ohio. "But we also know that we have 300 miles to go and a
lot can change quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "Our first priority will be to keep ahead of Helio, but I feel
sure the winner won't be decided until the last lap or two. I just
hope we'll be there."</TE>
<TE>   Hornish knows something about tight finishes. He beat Scott Sharp
by .0188 of a second last October at Texas and he lost to Airton Dare
by .1741 in July at Kansas.</TE>
<TE>   "These races keep getting closer and closer, and pretty soon I'm
not going to be able to tell the difference," said the former Grand
National karting champion.</TE>
<TE>   Hornish and Unser raced side by side at 220 mph for the final 21
laps last week, a situation that frustrated Castroneves, who was
right behind them but couldn't pass because there was no room.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like going to Afghanistan with only a knife," the little
Brazilian said.</TE>
<TE>   Before that race, Castroneves had been the points leader. He,
Penske Racing teammate Gil de Ferran and Hornish had been waging a
season-long battle for the championship. De Ferran, who is 38 points
behind Hornish, will miss the Texas race after suffering a concussion
at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been the hunted, now we are the hunter," said
Castroneves. "There is only one guy we are hunting, and that's Sam.
It would not surprise me if the two of us were right there together
on the last lap.</TE>
<TE>   "It should be an unbelievable race because there are a lot of
other good drivers, with no chance to win the championship, who will
want to close the year with a win."</TE>
<TE>   Hornish will be easy to spot in the bright yellow Pennzoil Panther
Dallara, as will Castroneves in the distinctive red and white
Marlboro Penske Dallara. Both are the colors of champions, Pennzoil
having been on the sides of winning Indy cars driven by Johnny
Rutherford and Rick Mears, Marlboro having been in the Indy winner's
circle with Emerson Fittipaldi, Mears, Unser and Castroneves.</TE>
<TE>   The points lead has changed hands four times in the last six races
and after each of the last three. If Hornish and Castroneves end up
tied in points, Hornish will collect the $1-million bonus because he
will have the most victories--four. He scored his others at
Homestead-Miami, California Speedway and Richmond, Va.</TE>
<TE>   Castroneves, 27, applauded Penske's hiring of CART veteran Max
Papis as a replacement for De Ferran. Papis, who won CART races last
year at Portland and Laguna Seca, lost his ride when his Sigma team
dropped out of racing.</TE>
<TE>   "The more cars, the better to mix up the points, the more chances
for someone else to finish ahead of Sam," he said. "Maybe Max can
help me climb another fence."</TE>
<TE>   The excitable Castroneves has endeared himself to fans by climbing
out of his car and climbing the nearest fence after winning a race.</TE>
<TE>   Hornish will also have a teammate, rookie Dan Wheldon of England,
who finished 10th in his IRL debut last week.</TE>
<TE>   A win by either Hornish or Castroneves would provide a little
history. Hornish would become the first driver to win the IRL title
twice, and Castroneves would become the first to win the Indy 500 and
IRL championship in the same year. Jacques Villeneuve, in 1995, the
last year before the IRL-CART split, was the last to win the 500 and
season championship, when CART was the sanctioning body.</TE>
<TE>   Cory Kruseman, Sprint Car Racing Assn. champion from Ventura, will
make his IRL debut Sunday, driving for PDM Racing, the team that
launched Hornish's career in 2000. Kruseman, who will be 32 on Sept.
20, is the SCRA's all-time winner with 56.</TE>
<TE>   Cart</TE>
<TE>   Is CART becoming open-wheel racing's development series?</TE>
<TE>   Four of its last five champions have left, De Ferran to the IRL,
Juan Montoya, Alex Zanardi and Villeneuve to Formula One. Now
Cristiano da Matta, its likely 2002 champion, appears to be heading
to F1 with Toyota.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota has announced it is dropping Allan McNish and Mika Salo and
is looking for two new drivers next year. Da Matta is expected to be
named before the U.S. Grand Prix on Sept. 29 in Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   "Toyota is a very unique Formula One team that comes in with a
good budget and good prospects for the future," Da Matta told the
Associated Press in England where he will drive in Saturday's
Rockingham 500. "I think it could be very good for me."</TE>
<TE>   Da Matta, who has won six races this year, tested for Toyota on
May 17 in France and described the experience as "very good."</TE>
<TE>   Motorcycles</TE>
<TE>   Some of the world's most sophisticated racing bikes will be
running Sunday when the Willow Springs Motorcycle Club hosts a
$150,000 Toyota 200 Unlimited Motorcycle Grand Prix at Willow Springs
Raceway. There will be no limitation on horsepower, engine
configuration, displacement or weight.</TE>
<TE>   "We should see some real high-performance machines out here," said
track owner Bill Huth. "We may even see the outright motorcycle lap
record broken at this event."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Rapp holds the record over the 2.5-mile road course of
113.882 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Vincent Haskovec, a Czech living at Lake Elsinore, has the fastest
qualifying speed of 109.110 and qualifying continues today for the 1
p.m. race Sunday. Other front row starters are Aaron Gobert of
Australia and Jeremy Toye of San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Club racing is scheduled Saturday and Sunday mornings. The feature
race will pay $50,000 to the winner.</TE>
<TE>   Street-Legal Drags</TE>
<TE>   In a throwback to the early days of drag racing, the So-Cal Speed
Shop will hold a session for pre-1974 hot rods on Sunday at Irwindale
Dragstrip's eighth-mile strip. Alex Xydias, Speed Shop founder and a
pioneer in drag racing, will be grand marshal of the 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
get-together.... California Speedway will also hold street-legal
racing, starting at 8 a.m. Saturday and Sunday on its quarter-mile
strip.</TE>
<TE>   Last Laps</TE>
<TE>   With two races remaining in the NASCAR super late model stock car
series at Irwindale Speedway, Rip Michels leads Brandon Loverock,
698-640, with Tony Bruncati next at 618. The super late models head
Saturday night's program.</TE>
<TE>   Renny Harlin, director of the CART movie "Driven," with Sylvester
Stallone, is driving in the world offshore powerboat racing series.
He failed to finish last Sunday in Izmir, Turkey, but plans to drive
Sept. 27 in the Fujairah Grand Prix in the United Arab Emirates.</TE>
<TE>   The Oval Nationals, richest nonwinged sprint car race in history
with a purse of $100,000, is scheduled Nov. 2 at Perris Auto
Speedway, but Sprint Car Racing Assn. drivers will get a tuneup there
Saturday night in a 30-lap main event. Richard Griffin has a
369-point lead over Kruseman in his bid for a fourth SCRA title.</TE>
<TE>   The Las Vegas Primm 300, Round 5 of the six-race SCORE Desert
Series, will be run Saturday on the California-Nevada border at
Primm. The event will be split into two races over a 70-mile course.
One, for slower classes, will start at 6 a.m., with the truck classes
and unlimited Class 1 starting at 2 p.m. Six-time SCORE class
champion Rob MacCachran will try an unusual double, sharing the wheel
with Gustavo Vildosola in the trophy truck race and then doing the
same thing in an open-wheel desert car with John Making in Class 1.</TE>

<HD>Angels Finally Removing Curse of Past Seasons</HD>

<LD>It is Friday the 13th, but why should the Angels be spooked
considering they continue to scoff at the ghosts of so many other
Septembers?</LD>
<LD>   They did it again Thursday night.</LD>
<LD>   They did it with the depth that is imperative for a championship
club.</LD>
<TE>   They did it with big hits from people named Scott Spiezio, Alex
Ochoa, Orlando Palmeiro and Shawn Wooten, and with clutch relief from
Al Levine, Scott Schoeneweis and Brendan Donnelley (who would give up
a tying home run in the ninth inning but refuse to fold) and with
Benji Gil coming off the bench to flash some leather.</TE>
<TE>   They came back against Mark Mulder and ultimately defeated closer
Billy Koch and the Oakland A's, 7-6, to emerge from this four-game
showdown with their third straight win, a tie with the A's for the
American League West lead and a bulge of seven games over the Seattle
Mariners in the wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   There are 16 games left, and while neither the Angels nor the A's
are making any claims or tallying magic numbers, it is safe to assume
both will be playing in October.</TE>
<TE>   The three-way race is basically down to two, and the only real
question is whether the A's or Angels will win the division and avoid
the Yankees in the opening round of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the Angels have the ghosts and doubters on the run.</TE>
<TE>   Jarrod Washburn, who has had other things to think about, thought
about that and said:</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe, when we were beating all those teams we should have been
beating, there were still some people who thought we'd fold, but the
way we played against the A's, I'd have to guess that any doubters
now realize we're for real."</TE>
<TE>   Washburn can enhance that perception tonight.</TE>
<TE>   He no longer faces prosecution for alleged sexual assault, but he
must deal with Alex Rodriguez and the Texas Rangers, who pushed the
Mariners further down the plank with a four-game sweep while the
Angels were winning three from the A's.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn started twice while under investigation, but that was
before the alleged incident became public. How the young ace handles
the increased notoriety could be pivotal to the Angels' long-term
hopes.</TE>
<TE>   "Physically," Manager Mike Scioscia said, "I don't think there's
any question.</TE>
<TE>   "Mentally, he's been through an ordeal. It could still weigh on
him, but I think he's strong enough to go out there and focus on his
pitching."</TE>
<TE>   Washburn agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm ready to go," he said. "I'm very much looking forward to
going out there with a clear mind."</TE>
<TE>   He will go out there with a 17-5 record, but the clear mind?</TE>
<TE>   "This has been something I hope to forget," he said of the
investigation by Anaheim police, "but I don't know if I'm going to be
able to do that soon.</TE>
<TE>   "I've certainly learned that I have to be a lot smarter with
things and put myself in less vulnerable positions."</TE>
<TE>   That will also be a goal against the Rangers, who have won seven
of their last eight games and homered in 29 of their last 30.</TE>
<TE>   "They've got a great lineup," Washburn said. "When they're hot, as
they have been, they're absolutely scary.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, I can cool them down, keep A-Rod in situations where
he can't hurt me, but I know I've got my work cut out."</TE>
<TE>   As the Rangers move into Edison Field, the A's go home to play
Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Asked who he would be rooting for in that series, Scioscia took
the expected course.</TE>
<TE>   "We have our hands full with our own business," he said. "We have
an opportunity to control our own destiny. We're not in position to
take notice of what happens outside of that bubble. Our challenge is
in-house. Whatever happens in those games, we still have to win."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels left a crowd of 31,304 roaring with their win Thursday
night, but they refused to stray from Scioscia's one-game-at-a-time
script and refused to bite on some bulletin board fodder from
Minnesota Twins' center fielder Torii Hunter.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter told the St. Paul Pioneer-Press that he would prefer to
play the Angels or Mariners rather than the A's in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   "One reason: pitching, period," Hunter said, meaning he thinks
Oakland's pitching is better than the Angels or Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Salmon shook his head and said: "That doesn't take away from
what we are or the Mariners are, and I don't take offense. The A's
have three horses [Mulder, Tim Hudson and Barry Zito] who get a lot
of air time. It's legit. They have three guys capable of being No. 1.
I mean, what he said is obvious. If I was in the National League it
would be like me saying I'd prefer to play anybody but Arizona
because of Curt Schilling and Randy Johnson."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels coped with Mulder and lost to Hudson this week, and
will play the A's four more times, starting next Monday in Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Washburn and his colleagues have to start fresh
again tonight, dealing with a Texas team, Salmon said, "that is
playing like one of the best in baseball. We have to stay on top of
it."</TE>
<TE>   He meant on top of their game, but he could have meant the top of
the division.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if people expected us to be in this position,"
Salmon said, "but it's a testament to our character and ability. I
don't know if it's a matter of feeling we had something to prove, but
we've been able to block out a lot of the things people have said
about us.</TE>
<TE>   "The atmosphere is definitely better than in the past."</TE>
<TE>   A division lead in mid-September is heady atmosphere, indeed.</TE>

<HD>Illness May Keep Mourning Out for Season</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alonzo Mourning's kidney condition has deteriorated and will probably
prevent him from playing this season, a source close to the Miami
Heat center said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The Heat released a statement confirming that Mourning would be
sidelined indefinitely because doctors don't believe he's healthy
enough to play.</LD>
<LD>   Mourning is certain to miss the start of the season, said the
source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The Heat's opener is
Oct. 30.</LD>
<TE>   The 32-year-old Mourning was diagnosed in October 2000 with focal
segmental glomerulosclerosis, a career-threatening kidney disease. He
played in only the last 13 games that season but played in 75 games
last season and made the All-Star team for the seventh time.</TE>
<TE>   The Heat said a timetable for his return hasn't been determined.
Mourning's publicist, Lisa Joseph, said doctors haven't told him he's
out for the entire season, and he hopes to play again eventually.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not retiring," she said. "There will be no announcement that
he's retiring."</TE>
<TE>   Joseph said she spoke Thursday with Mourning.</TE>
<TE>   "His spirits are great," she said. "He's fine. He's doing well.
He's just trying to get back healthy."</TE>
<TE>   Mourning was unavailable for comment.</TE>
<TE>   "Alonzo wants to keep everything private," Heat spokesman Tim
Donovan said.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Pat Riley declined to comment but will hold a news
conference today.</TE>

<HD>Felony Charges Dropped Against Russell</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors dropped all 25 felony charges in their rape case against
Oakland Raider defensive tackle Darrell Russell on Thursday, saying
they couldn't prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt.</LD>
<LD>   Russell, 26, had been charged with drugging a 28-year-old woman
with the "date-rape drug" GHB at a San Francisco nightclub early this
year, and then recording her alleged rape by two of his friends. The
alleged assault took place at the home of one of Russell's teammates
on Jan. 31.</LD>
<LD>   Russell, a former No. 2 overall selection in the NFL draft, was
charged as an accomplice--under California law, he could have been
found guilty of crimes committed by either of his two friends if he
did not intervene.</LD>
<TE>   "I think that what we're doing is the right thing to do," Alameda
County Deputy District Attorney Kevin Murphy said outside court.
"It's not an easy thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   Russell said outside court that this was the just decision because
he is innocent. He thanked prosecutors, said he was relieved and said
he thought the case had not hurt his chances of returning to
football.</TE>
<TE>   Russell is serving a one-year NFL suspension for violating the
league's substance abuse policy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Police in Pittsburgh are investigating whether a woman who accused
Steeler running back Jerome Bettis of sexual assault lied as part of
a blackmail scheme, two high-ranking law enforcement officials said.
Bettis has not been charged.... Denver Bronco tight end Dwayne
Carswell won't be tried for a third time in Pueblo, Colo., on charges
he pushed his girlfriend out of his truck after an argument.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defensive tackle Wendell Bryant, the Arizona Cardinals'
first-round draft pick, ended his holdout and agreed to a five-year,
$7.5-million contract that includes a $5.5-million signing bonus.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant, the No. 12 pick overall, is the next-to-last 2002 draft
choice to come to terms. Offensive tackle Bryant McKinnie, drafted by
the Minnesota Vikings, is the remaining holdout.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Not only did Cleveland Brown linebacker Dwayne Rudd cost his team
a victory by throwing his helmet Sunday, he cost himself $5,000.
Rudd, whose 15-yard penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct set up Kansas
City's game-winning field goal with no time on the clock, was fined
by the league.</TE>
<TE>   Brown kicker Phil Dawson and punter-holder Chris Gardocki also
were fined $5,000 for taunting in the last seconds of the Chiefs'
40-39 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland also learned that starting center Dave Wohlabaugh will
miss at least one game because of a broken hand.</TE>

<HD>Vizcaino Is Clutch in the Pressure</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jose Vizcaino learned how to hit in clutch situations during his time
with the New York Yankees.</LD>
<LD>   Vizcaino put that knowledge to good use Thursday night at Houston
when he hit a three-run homer to cap a four-run rally in the eighth
inning as the Astros defeated St. Louis, 6-3, to end the Cardinals'
eight-game winning streak.</LD>
<LD>   Vizcaino has been with seven teams, including the Yankees in 2000,
before coming to Houston in 2001. Vizcaino drove in the winning run
in Game 1 of the 2000 World Series as the Yankees went on to win the
championship that season.</LD>
<TE>   "I like to have pressure situations," Vizcaino said. "I learned
that attitude in New York. That's the attitude they all have there.
Different guys always come through for them. I've had that attitude
ever since then."</TE>
<TE>   Vizcaino, who had a season-high four runs batted in, hit his fifth
homer of the season, and his second game-winner. He had a game-ending
homer against Pittsburgh May 18.</TE>
<TE>   "He has had a lot of big hits for us this season," Manager Jimy
Williams said. "He always practices like he's trying to make the
team. He has honest enthusiasm and I think the players around him
pick up on that. He's had a very, very strong year for us."</TE>
<TE>   Houston, which closed within 5 1/2 games of the National League
Central leader, trailed, 3-2, in the eighth when Craig Biggio homered
off Dave Veres (5-8) leading off.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Bagwell singled with one out, and Mike Crudale relieved and
walked Mark Loretta before giving up the home run to Vizcaino.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 15, Chicago 12--Todd Walker had four hits and four
RBIs, including a tiebreaking three-run double in the eighth inning
that propelled the Reds at Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago outhit the Reds, 22-17, the Cubs' most since collecting 24
against Houston on Aug. 20.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing, 11-10, Cincinnati tied it in the eighth on a wild pitch
by Kyle Farnsworth (3-6) with a runner on third before Walker's
bases-loaded double gave the Reds the lead. Walker is 20 for 35
during an eight-game hitting streak.</TE>
<TE>   John Reidling (2-2) struck out the last batter in the eighth, and
Scott Williamson got his third save.</TE>
<TE>   New York 8, Montreal 2--Jeromy Burnitz homered twice and had three
RBIs and Mo Vaughn hit a two-run homer at Montreal as Jason
Middlebrook (2-3) won his Met debut.</TE>
<TE>   New York has won nine of 11 after losing 17 of 20.</TE>
<TE>   A late addition to the starting lineup, Vaughn hit his 22nd homer
of the season off Tomo Ohka (13-8) after Roberto Alomar's one-out
single in the fourth to put the Mets up, 3-0.</TE>
<TE>   Burnitz hit his 16th homer after Edgardo Alfonzo's one-out single
in the seventh to chase Ohka. Burnitz and Jason Phillips hit
consecutive homers in the ninth off reliever T.J. Tucker.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 6, Florida 1--Joe Roa came within three outs of his
first shutout and Jimmy Rollins' bases-loaded triple sparked a
five-run third inning to lead the Phillies at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Roa (4-3), who was 14-0 with a 1.86 earned-run average in triple A
after being released by the Marlins in spring training, gave up eight
hits and no walks in eight-plus innings. Michael Tejera (8-8) had his
shortest outing of the year, giving up six runs--four earned--and
nine hits in 3 2/3 innings.</TE>

<HD>Last Charges Against Iverson to Be Dropped</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>The last two counts against NBA All-Star Allen Iverson will be
dropped because his accusers don't want to pursue the case, District
Attorney Lynne Abraham said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Iverson originally was charged with 14 counts, including four
felonies, for allegedly barging into an apartment with a gun and
threatening two men while looking for his wife.</LD>
<LD>   All but two misdemeanors were dismissed by a judge July 29, after
the two accusers, Charles Jones and Hakim Carey, gave conflicting
testimony, including whether the Philadelphia 76er guard was carrying
a gun.</LD>
<TE>   Abraham said her office could have compelled Jones and Carey to
testify, but decided that it would be a waste of resources. Carey has
since moved to Maryland and Jones is in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the taxpayers want to spend that kind of money on
this kind of case," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Iverson's uncle, Gregory, faced the same charges and also will not
be prosecuted.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Iverson said, "I want to sincerely thank Lynne
Abraham for having the courage to do the right thing and not be
caught up in the media frenzy that accompanied these false
accusations against me."</TE>
<TE>   Iverson denied he had a gun, made threats or forced his way into
his cousin's apartment that morning.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>These are uncertain times for fishermen, commercial and sport, who
are falling under more severe restrictions almost by the day. Or so
it seems.</LD>
<LD>   In California and along the West Coast, there have been closures
and talks of more closures. There have been shrinking bag limits and
quotas. Like a tsunami, the continuing push to save bocaccio and
other bottom fishes from the threat of extinction has overwhelmed
those in the business of catching fish.</LD>
<LD>   There have been claims that "the best available science" being
used to assess the health of our fisheries is not good enough to
warrant such extreme actions, that there are as many bocaccio as
ever. The threat of closures has pitted sport fishermen against
commercial fishermen.</LD>
<TE>   There have been accusations by both groups that environmentalists
have ganged up on them in an attempt to stop all forms of fishing,
and that the politicians are listening to the environmentalists. And
there have been charges by environmentalists that the fishermen are
in denial.</TE>
<TE>   On one weekend radio show last Sunday, the host went so far as to
say that Gov. Gray Davis, by taking the environmentalists' side for
political reasons, was no different from "a third-world politician"
being unduly influenced by bribery. And that another four years with
Davis "will mean the death of sportfishing in California."</TE>
<TE>   That might be overstating the case, but the topic of fishing these
days is that hot.</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, the heat is spreading south of the border. Another
fiery controversy has sprung up in Mexico, resulting in charges of
corruption as well as predictions of failing fisheries and the death
of sportfishing.</TE>
<TE>   An impending regulation allowing substantially more fishing is
creeping closer to becoming law. It threatens to have devastating
impact on marlin, sailfish, dorado and other game fish populations,
as well as on giant Pacific mantas, endangered sea turtles and other
non-game species.</TE>
<TE>   Or such are the claims being leveled by just about anyone who
isn't a commercial fisherman, or who doesn't stand to benefit from an
increase in fishing pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "What this regulation authorizes is the automatic destruction of
the Sea of Cortez and the whole Mexican coast," charges Bobby Van
Wormer, tourism secretary for the state of Baja California Sur, which
includes Cabo San Lucas, a resort city that has flourished over the
years as a world-famous sportfishing destination.</TE>
<TE>   "It would allow the big shark-fishing boats, under the camouflage
of actually fishing for sharks, to come in and rip the hell out of
everything."</TE>
<TE>   At issue is Norma 029, or the Shark Norma, a regulation that was
supposed to go into effect Thursday but was postponed for 60 days by
Mexican President Vicente Fox, who said this week that more input and
study were needed.</TE>
<TE>   The Shark Norma will open Mexico's waters to shark fishermen and
enable them to operate within a 50-mile buffer zone that has for
years been reserved solely for sportfishing.</TE>
<TE>   In reality, though, by allowing the use of long-lines and
gill-nets inside the sportfishing-only zone, and as close as half a
mile from shore, it will result in the killing of marlin, sailfish,
dorado, turtles, whales and anything else that happens to swim into
the nets or take bait being offered.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who accept [the Shark Norma] are only the [commercial]
fishermen because with this [regulation] they can fish wherever they
want," said Carlos Villavicencio, a college professor and marine
biologist in La Paz.</TE>
<TE>   The long-lines can be as long as six miles and can hold as many as
2,000 hooks. The gill-nets can span a mile.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you imagine the ecological disaster?" Villavicencio said.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, not everybody can. Department of Fisheries chief
Jeronimo Ramos and secretary of agriculture Javier Usabiaga have
supported the Shark Norma, despite heavy criticism and accusations
that they must have ulterior motives "because this makes so little
sense," Van Wormer said.</TE>
<TE>   So far, neither has budged, though, claiming a properly managed
fishery to be good</TE>
<TE>   for both fishermen and the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, foes of the Shark Norma--and their numbers are
growing and include various government officials and state
senators--have been directing their attentions toward the country's
leader, who in recent weeks has been touting his nation and
administration as being environmentally friendly.</TE>
<TE>   When Fox arrived in Cabo San Lucas last Friday to attend ongoing
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings, more than 200 protesters
blocked the road from the airport to the hotel. He was also
confronted by a television reporter and, when pressed, vowed that
sustainable fisheries management practices would not be compromised
and that he would postpone the Shark Norma for two months.</TE>
<TE>   It has been suggested that Fox, who has been busy traveling and
with other matters to consider, might not have been totally aware of
the details of the Shark Norma, or of the mounting controversy it has
generated.</TE>
<TE>   He probably is aware now.</TE>
<TE>   News and Notes</TE>
<TE>   * Saltwater fishing: Large and voracious yellowtail are in the
spotlight this week and their presence--at Catalina and the outer
banks--has diverted some of the attention from the albacore and
bluefin grounds. The fish are averaging 20-plus pounds and anglers
are losing as many as they're catching. Also in the news are giant
squid, which have returned off Orange County. On the down side, the
squid are apparently terrorizing the sand bass by night because the
sand bass have mysteriously disappeared since the arrival of the
voracious mollusks.</TE>
<TE>   * Hunting: The California Fish and Game Commission last week
adopted an emergency regulation banning the importation by
out-of-state hunters of deer and elk meat, except for boned meat,
quarters or processed cuts, hides and heads that have no part of the
spinal column or brain attached. In essence, all nervous tissue must
be removed before the meat can be transported into California. The
ban is an attempt to reduce the chance of chronic wasting disease
spreading to our deer and elk herds. CWD, a fatal neurological
disease, has been found in several western and midwestern states.</TE>
<TE>   * Boating: The Lido Yacht Expo is in progress through Sunday at
Lido Marina Village in Newport Beach. The show is specifically a
big-boat affair featuring upscale models. Admission is $8 for adults,
free for children 12 and under. Details: (949) 757-5959 or
www.goboatingamerica.com.... The International Sail and Power Boat
Show is scheduled Sept. 26-29 at the Long Beach Convention Center and
Downtown Marina. Details: www.scma.com.</TE>
<TE>   Winding Up</TE>
<TE>   John Miller of Redondo Beach went marlin fishing Wednesday and
ended up in a grueling struggle with an enormous mako shark off the
west end of Catalina.</TE>
<TE>   "All the bait I had for marlin died on the way over so I used the
dead bait to catch the mako," Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   He was fishing solo but called a friend who motored out to help.
The friend arrived 4 1/2 hours after the hookup and an hour later
they had the 10-foot shark at the boat. Once it was subdued, it was
towed back to King Harbor and ultimately donated to the Fred Jordan
Mission in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Miller said he killed the mako only because he thought it might be
a state record, but it fell well short of the record 986-pound mako
caught two years ago.</TE>

<TE>   For the first time in 41 years, Washington State was picked to win
the conference title, and this week the school embarks on arguably
the most important nonconference regular-season trip since the school
began playing football in 1894.</TE>
<TE>   Most years, Washington State might flinch at the prospect, but
this isn't most years. The Cougars are coming off a 10-2 rebuilding
year and think they can stand buckeye-to-buckeye with Ohio State.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State has four returning starters on the offensive
line, three on the defensive line. Thirty-four players have starting
experience. Last year's Cougar defense posted 40 sacks and a
school-record 26 interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   "This team, this program, it's the perfect time, the perfect
situation," Gesser said this week. "If we played them my freshman
year, I don't think we could have been able to match up with them
physically. This year, I really think we can."</TE>
<TE>   Washington State (2-0) versus Ohio State (2-0) is No. 10 versus
No. 6 in the AP poll, but more than that for the Cougars. For a
program that rarely ventures out of its time zone, it offers the rare
opportunity to make a national statement.</TE>
<TE>   It seems incredible that Washington State hasn't been in a
regular-season road game of this importance, but history suggests
just that. The 1997 win at Washington was historic in that it earned
Washington State its first Rose Bowl trip in 67 years, but even that
game did not have national title implications.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, Washington State beat Tennessee at Knoxville, and in
1977, it won at Nebraska, but nothing compares to this weekend at
Ohio State.</TE>
<TE>   It's up to Gesser, the team's senior leader, to keep the lid on
emotions.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the main concern," Gesser said. "We really can't get
caught up in the hype, oh it's Ohio State, oh, it's the Horseshoe,
it's 100,000 people."</TE>
<TE>   The key?</TE>
<TE>   "Don't get caught up in the Ohio State mystique," Gesser said.
"Don't get caught up with oh, they're big, they're strong and they're
tough. We got to go out there with an attitude and knock them in the
mouth."</TE>
<TE>   Gesser definitely has the attitude. Although not prototype
quarterback size at 6 feet 1, Gesser plays with pants-on-fire
abandon. The little kid few thought would make it big has 46
touchdown passes, tying him with Drew Bledsoe for third on the
school's all-time list.</TE>
<TE>   Gesser has been able to adapt to any situation, most notably his
migration from his hometown of Honolulu to Pullman.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Wow, I've got to get some shoes, boots and jeans,' "
Gesser said of his transition out of flip-flops and shorts. "I've got
to start wearing coats and stuff. That was the biggest thing I had to
get used to."</TE>
<TE>   As for Gesser's Heisman Trophy campaign? It was launched somewhat
tongue-in-cheek, the school paying $2,500 to put his likeness on a
grain elevator in the tiny town of Dusty, Wash., a clear dig at
Oregon's New York City poster push last year for Joey Harrington.</TE>
<TE>   "It's perfect, it fits me and the university perfectly," Gesser
said. "I'd rather be on the side of that grain elevator than be on
the side of a building in Manhattan."</TE>
<TE>   A victory over Ohio State, however, and Gesser's campaign becomes
no joke.</TE>
<TE>   Hey, slow it down.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not up for the Heisman; Washington State is up for the
Heisman," Gesser said. "You can't have a guy go to New York as a
finalist with a 6-6 record or a 7-5 record. You've got to be 11-0,
12-0."</TE>
<TE>   And none of that happens unless you start 3-0.</TE>
<TE>   Pac Bits</TE>
<TE>   California at 2-0 already has doubled its win total from last
year, and the team's 104 points are more than half of last year's 201
total in 11 games.</TE>
<TE>   News bulletin: Stanford rebounds from opening defeat at Boston
College with breather against San Jose State. Hardly. The spunky
Spartans led Washington, 10-0, at the half last week and have taken
three of the last four meetings against Stanford. Chris Lewis gets
the start at quarterback for Stanford after serving a one-game
suspension for a minor NCAA violation. According to the San Jose
Mercury News, Lewis used an athletic department long-distance access
code to make a personal phone call (this passes for scandalous in
Palo Alto).</TE>
<TE>   Oregon, which plays host to Idaho this week, doesn't play a road
game until Oct. 5 at Arizona. If the Ducks' Onterrio Smith keeps
averaging 124 yards rushing, look for his name to start popping up on
Heisman short lists desperate for tailbacks.</TE>
<TE>   You know about the gift Washington Coach Rick Neuheisel handed
Michigan on Aug. 31, but the charity didn't end there. Neuheisel
recently donated $7,500 to help pay for uniforms at Alcorn State.
Why? Karl Morgan, an Alcorn assistant coach, was Neuheisel's teammate
at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific 10 is 14-3 in nonconference games. The defeats:
Washington at Michigan, Arizona State at Nebraska and Stanford at
Boston College.</TE>
<TE>   John Robinson and Dennis Erickson have long been coaching
contemporaries yet meet on the field for the first time Saturday when
Nevada Las Vegas plays at Oregon State. Erickson, with a record of
138-52-1, is college football's seventh winningest active coach.
Robinson ranks 12th at 120-56-4.</TE>

<KH>Q &amp; A WITH FELIX TRINIDAD</KH>
<HD>From Trinidad's Corner, the Choice Is De La Hoya</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In September of 1999, Felix Trinidad was seemingly a beaten man after
nine rounds of his welterweight title fight against Oscar De La Hoya.
Trinidad was behind on most scorecards, his face bruised and
battered.</LD>
<LD>   But then, unexpectedly, De La Hoya began to run. He spent the last
three rounds backpedaling, in effect giving the fight to Trinidad,
who won on a majority decision.</LD>
<LD>   In December of 2000, Trinidad fought a far different match against
Fernando Vargas, knocking Vargas down five times and going down once
himself before winning on a 12th-round technical knockout.</LD>
<TE>   Trinidad, who lost last September to Bernard Hopkins--it was his
only defeat--recently announced his retirement at 29. Earlier this
week, Trinidad agreed to talk about his future and to analyze
Saturday night's 154-pound championship fight between De La Hoya and
Vargas. Trinidad spoke to reporters through a translator by phone
from his home in Puerto Rico.</TE>
<TE>   Question: You have repeated over and over again your determination
to remain retired. But when you talk about a big fight like
Saturday's and hear about the big money both fighters can earn, are
you tempted at all to reverse your decision?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: It has nothing to do with my going back to the ring. I
have contributed a lot to boxing already. I am very proud of what I
have accomplished. I have won five world titles in three categories,
I fought the best of the best around and I never ran away from a
fight. I fought everybody. I believe this is the best moment to
[retire]. I am economically solid and completely healthy. That's the
key to it all. I have had 42 fights and I am healthy mentally and
physically. On the whole, that is what is really important.</TE>
<TE>   Q: So is this a real retirement, one without a comeback on the
horizon?</TE>
<TE>   A: This is a real retirement. I want to be one of the first to
retire when I am still ahead. I want to be an example to others. I
want to walk away healthy.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You walk away still a relatively young man. What will you do
with the rest of your life?</TE>
<TE>   A: I am going back to college. I will use tutors the way I used
trainers, to prepare myself academically.</TE>
<TE>   Q: For what? Have you decided on a major?</TE>
<TE>   A: Not yet.</TE>
<TE>   Q: From the unique perspective of a man who has beaten both of
Saturday's combatants, who do you think will win?</TE>
<TE>   A: De La Hoya will win the fight.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Many boxing people feel De La Hoya's speed of hand and foot
will be the key to victory for him. Was that the main element in his
ability to dominate you early in your fight against him and is that
why you are picking him now?</TE>
<TE>   A: I wasn't surprised that De La Hoya was as fast as he was
against me. I was ready. The quickness could be one of the elements
[Saturday], but not the decisive element. The most important element
will be the stamina of the two fighters.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You say that you see De La Hoya winning. By decision or by
knockout?</TE>
<TE>   A: De La Hoya has the possibility of beating Vargas by knockout.
From the time the first bell rings, Vargas will go after De La Hoya,
try to jump on him, and De La Hoya will be boxing, using his left
hand, always backing up. Vargas, because he hates De La Hoya so much,
will be going after him, trying to hurt him. The physical condition
of the two fighters will determine whether Vargas hurts De La Hoya,
or whether De La Hoya can outbox Vargas or knock him out.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Which will it be? If you had to make a choice, would you say
knockout or decision?</TE>
<TE>   A: I believe De La Hoya can win on a knockout, based on his
quickness and the fact Vargas is not the same fighter he was when I
fought him. Quickness and damage are the reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Q: So you go along with those who say Vargas has not looked the
same since you sent him to the canvas five times, that in his
subsequent fights against Wilfredo Rivera and Jose "Shibata" Flores,
he showed the effects of that beating?</TE>
<TE>   A: Yes, he has not been fighting to the potential he had before.
He has not shown himself to be the quality of fighter he was before.
When Vargas fought me, I thought he was stronger than De La Hoya. But
Vargas has slowed down since that fight. His stamina is down. But
since he fought Oba Carr [in May 1999], De La Hoya has also gone down
in terms of the quality of his fighting ability.</TE>
<TE>   Q: So what does that all mean for Saturday?</TE>
<TE>   A: De La Hoya must be prepared to [slug it out] with Vargas. If he
has not prepared himself for that, he will lose the fight. If Vargas
is not prepared to box [as well as brawl], he will lose.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You yourself mentioned the hatred Vargas has for De La Hoya.
Can those emotions be detrimental to him in the ring Saturday,
causing him to lose control?</TE>
<TE>   A: Vargas is a veteran fighter who has the potential to beat De La
Hoya. When he gets into the ring, I am sure he will control his
emotions.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What vulnerability in Vargas' style did you spot that allowed
you to knock him down so many times? What was your most effective
punch against him? And can De La Hoya take advantage of that
vulnerability in the same way?</TE>
<TE>   A: The left hook was very effective for me, but De La Hoya does
not have that kind of left hook. Neither of them has a knockout
punch. Neither of them has one-punch power.</TE>

<LD>Galaxy midfielder Ezra Hendrickson engaged U.S. women's national team
players Lorrie Fair, Heather Mitts and Jenny Benson in an impromptu
game of kicking a soccer ball around a dirt lot Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Wearing hard hats, dodging earth-moving machines and struggling to
be heard over the din of a construction site, the foursome were on
the floor of what will be a soccer stadium at the under-construction
Home Depot National Training Center in Carson.</LD>
<LD>   "It's exciting because I was here in May and it's come so far in a
few months," Hendrickson said. "It's going to be such a better
atmosphere altogether than playing in the Rose Bowl, which is a
90,000-seat stadium. To have this intimacy in front of [27,000]
people ... everything is so close. Imagine playing ... and the fans
are right here on top of you. The fans at the Rose Bowl are like 20
yards out beyond the field.</LD>
<TE>   "It's going to be a chance for us to feed off the energy of the
crowd, which in soccer is a big thing. It's an advantage and I think
that's going to help us."</TE>
<TE>   The 85-acre, $130-million development, which also will feature a
13,000-seat tennis stadium, is scheduled to open in June and house
the Galaxy and the U.S. men's and women's national teams.</TE>
<TE>   Benson, who was born in Fountain Valley and lives in Huntington
Beach, was taken aback by the scene.</TE>
<TE>   "It's amazing to think that we could be playing in this," said
Benson, who plays for the Philadelphia Charge of the Women's United
Soccer Association.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a dream come true because soccer has grown so much in
this area within the past 10 years, first with the World Cup in '94
and the women's World Cup in '99. The possibility of [the center] has
become a reality. I'm stoked."</TE>
<TE>   Vieira Needs a Rest</TE>
<TE>   The English Premier League season is only five games old but
Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira said he needs a rest.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not just tired, I'm cooked," Vieira told the Evening Standard
newspaper. "I can hardly stand up at times. My back hurts, my legs
hurt, I hurt everywhere. I am going to see the manager because he
must give me some rest.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know when or how, but we have to do it quickly because
the Champions League is coming and there will also soon be two
matches with the French team."</TE>
<TE>   Vieira played in France's three World Cup matches before its
shocking early exit.</TE>
<TE>   He also played in France's 2-1 Euro 2004 qualifying win over
Cyprus on Saturday and in its 1-1 friendly draw against Tunisia on
Aug. 21. He has played in every Arsenal game.</TE>
<TE>   Not that Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger cares.</TE>
<TE>   "Patrick played in Cyprus on Saturday night and after the game
against Manchester City on Tuesday night, he was very tired," Wenger
told the Associated Press. "I looked at the statistics for Tuesday's
game and, physically, Patrick was outstanding. He pushed himself very
hard and that explains why he was so tired.</TE>
<TE>   "But I have no plans to rest him."</TE>
<TE>   Trouble for Torrado</TE>
<TE>   Mexican international midfielder Gerardo Torrado injured his left
leg playing for his Spanish club team Sevilla and will be out for up
to two months, Spanish media reported.</TE>

<LD>Every school year, more teenagers inevitably experiment with alcohol.</LD>
<LD>   They watch NFL games on television, see the numerous beer
commercials and decide to join the fun. They go to parties and face
peer pressure to drink. They attend sporting events, see people
drinking, and feel encouraged to fit in.</LD>
<LD>   There are coaches who believe it's not their business to monitor
the private lives of students just as long as what they're doing is
not connected to a school function.</LD>
<TE>   But playing sports in high school is a privilege, requiring a
higher citizenship commitment. And that puts a burden on coaches not
to close their eyes when athletes engage in underage drinking--no
matter where it occurs.</TE>
<TE>   Four starting Valencia High football players were involved in a
one-car accident during Labor Day weekend after attending a party in
Castaic. The truck they were riding in rolled over, and one of the
eight passengers was seriously injured. Alcohol was involved, the
California Highway Patrol said.</TE>
<TE>   Thankfully, Coach Brian Stiman refused to ignore his players'
conduct. He suspended them for Valencia's season opener tonight
against La Puente Bishop Amat.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody said, 'Is this what you want to do?' No, but it's what
you should do, and it's the right thing to do," Stiman said.</TE>
<TE>   Only two days earlier, the coach had addressed his team about the
dangers of drugs and alcohol. The players either didn't listen or
didn't believe him.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is high school kids think they are invincible,"
Stiman said.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Clarita Valley has been the scene of several tragic
drunk driving accidents in recent years. It's a place with wide-open
roads connecting communities spread around canyons and valleys. Those
roads are a potential death trap for anyone driving under the
influence.</TE>
<TE>   The L.A. County Sheriff's Dept. has been visible at local high
schools trying to warn teenagers about drinking and driving through
its Every 15 Minutes program, which uses wrecks as props in an
attempt to deter drunk driving.</TE>
<TE>   "We take student drunk driving very seriously," Det. Anthony
Arnold said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had way too many incidents where kids are maimed."</TE>
<TE>   Stiman is fortunate in that his punishment had the endorsement of
the players' parents.</TE>
<TE>   "We are all behind him 100%," the mother of one suspended player
said. "You preach to your kids about drugs and alcohol and they're
still getting booze. It's reaching epidemic proportions, and it's
really a miracle the kids weren't killed."</TE>
<TE>   Stiman said his policy is that the first time it is verified a
student is using alcohol or illegal drugs at a nonschool function, he
faces a two-game suspension. A second offense results in dismissal
from the team.</TE>
<TE>   The question is, how much freedom away from campus should a
student athlete be allowed?</TE>
<TE>   "There should be [some] privacy," said Valencia quarterback
Stephen Wright, who wasn't involved in the accident. "You don't want
[the coach] talking with your girlfriend. But sometimes, they need to
step in."</TE>
<TE>   No one expects perfection from teenagers. But underage drinking is
one vice that coaches shouldn't tolerate, whether it's done on or off
campus.</TE>
<TE>   Too many people have died or faced life in a wheelchair because
someone didn't act to take a drunk driver off the road.</TE>
<TE>   Stiman acted responsibly by suspending his players.</TE>
<TE>   The Vikings could end up losing their opener because of his
decision, but there are more important issues involved.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not about winning," the coach said. "It's about doing the
right thing and holding young men accountable."</TE>

<LD>When should a sensitive news story be reported? Should it be reported
at all?</LD>
<LD>   Channel 7 faced those issues this week.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, the station reported that Angel pitcher Jarrod
Washburn was under investigation by Anaheim police for alleged sexual
assault and the accuser was a 16-year-old female.</LD>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the Orange County district attorney's office decided
not to file charges because of lack of evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Did Channel 7 act too hastily? Did the station unnecessarily
tarnish a player's name? Or did it act responsibly?</TE>
<TE>   It appears that the station, as a news-gathering organization,
acted responsibly.</TE>
<TE>   After an anonymous tip was phoned in to the station on Monday, it
was learned that there indeed was a police investigation. But the
station sat on the story until more information could be obtained.</TE>
<TE>   Then it was learned Tuesday that the police, who began their
investigation Sept. 1, were planning to turn the case over to the
D.A.'s office.</TE>
<TE>   "That's when we decided to go with the story," said Channel 7 news
director Cheryl Fair.</TE>
<TE>   To Channel 7's credit, it didn't matter that this was a case of
one Disney entity putting another Disney entity in a bad light.</TE>
<TE>   "In this company, that would never be a concern," Fair said. "But,
as always, we wanted to be fair in our coverage."</TE>
<TE>   Sportscaster Curt Sandoval, covering from Edison Field, told team
officials about the story, giving them time to inform Washburn and
his teammates.</TE>
<TE>   Sandoval got a statement from the team and comments from
Washburn's agent, Scott Boras. Rob Fukuzaki reported the story from
the KABC-TV studios in Glendale.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels weren't pleased that the story got out, but Tim Mead,
the team's vice president of communications, said Channel 7 acted in
"a professional manner." He also complimented the station for not
sensationalizing the story.</TE>
<TE>   Jay Lucas, the team's director of broadcasting and publicity,
informed the TV and radio announcing teams about the story and told
them, in the interest of credibility, they should report the facts of
the case during Tuesday night's game broadcasts.</TE>
<TE>   TV announcer Steve Physioc's report was brief. "My feeling was,
let due process take over, and it did," he said later.</TE>
<TE>   Radio announcer Rory Markas said he took the same approach. "It
wasn't the place to offer opinions," he said.</TE>
<TE>   By Wednesday night, after the case had been dropped, the focus was
more on the moving Sept. 11 tributes. Besides the ones at the
stadium, Markas did a moving piece on the radio pregame show that
featured an interview with Angel bench coach Joe Maddon, who lost a
close college friend in the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Laker Update</TE>
<TE>   It appears that the Lakers will stick with simulcasts for at least
another season or two and go with one announcing team. It will
consist of Chick Hearn's replacement and Stu Lantz. Hearn's
replacement will be hired in the next couple of weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The Laker broadcast partners wanted two announcing teams--one for
television and one for radio. But team officials prefer simulcasts.
Their belief is that one marquee team is the best way to compete with
ESPN telecasts. Under the new NBA television contract, national cable
telecasts will not be blacked out and, thus, will run head-to-head
with local telecasts.</TE>
<TE>   Clipper Update</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers didn't have an over-the-air television broadcaster
last season. They rectified that by making a deal with Channel 5 for
25 telecasts.</TE>
<TE>   Now comes word the Clippers may not have Fox Sports Net 2 as a
cable carrier this season. Negotiations are not going well, a source
said.</TE>
<TE>   Worldwide Coverage</TE>
<TE>   Saturday night's Oscar De La Hoya-Fernando Vargas fight, to be
televised on HBO Pay-Per-View with Jim Lampley and crew, will also be
televised in 57 countries outside the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Massengale and Rich Marotta will supply the commentary for
the international feed, although most foreign-language countries will
use their own announcers.</TE>
<TE>   As for media coverage leading to the fight, Arum said he has never
seen anything quite like it for a non-heavyweight bout. Twenty-two
radio stations are represented at the fight site, among them Los
Angeles' KSPN (1110) and KXTA (1150).</TE>
<TE>   Bye Bye, Arnie</TE>
<TE>   Arnie Spanier ends a three-year run at KXTA today. Marotta will
step into Spanier's 3-7 p.m. slot, at least until the end of baseball
season. Marotta hosts a boxing show for the station and also worked
with Marques Johnson on a show during the Lakers' last playoff run.</TE>
<TE>   Spanier is headed for Atlanta's WCNN, where he will be reunited
with Mike Thompson, the program director who brought him to KXTA in
the first place.</TE>
<TE>   KXTA station manager Greg Ashlock said Spanier was told that a
change was going to be made in afternoon drive time and he could not
be guaranteed another time slot.</TE>
<TE>   Program director Robin Bertolucci said, "We encouraged Arnie to
explore other options and are pleased that he got such a great
opportunity in Atlanta."</TE>
<TE>   Spanier, in part, was a victim of poor ratings.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been winning every day part [among sports stations]
except afternoon drive," Ashlock said. "In that time slot, [XTRA
690's] Lee Hamilton owns the city."</TE>
<TE>   More Bad News</TE>
<TE>   There were already the Sept. 11 remembrances and the passing of
Johnny Unitas to deal with on Wednesday. Then that evening USC
football commentator Craig Fertig called with the news that his
31-year-old daughter, Jennifer, had died the night before at Hoag
Memorial Hospital in Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   For eight years, Jennifer, a USC graduate and real estate
attorney, had battled a rare virus related to Epstein-Barr and had
recently undergone two brain surgeries.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer was the 13th member of her family to have attended USC.
Her godfather was the late John McKay. She was a cousin of Todd
Marinovich.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service will be held Wednesday at 2:30 p.m. at Pacific
View Memorial Park, 2500 Pacific View Dr., Newport Beach. In lieu of
flowers, donations can be made to the Blind Children's Center, 4120
Marathon St., Los Angeles 90029.</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   Fox Sports Net 2's high school game of the week begins tonight at
7 with Newhall Hart playing at Los Alamitos. The announcing crew
consists of Jim Watson, John Jackson Jr. and sideline reporter Petros
Papadakis, who will pick a player to profile each week. Papadakis
will be looking for players who have traits similar to his in his
playing days at USC.... A new show, "L.A. Times High School
Spotlight," will make its debut on Fox Sports Net next Thursday at
6:30 p.m. The Times' Mike Terry will be a co-host, joined initially
by John Fricke, and The Times' Eric Sondheimer will be a regular
contributor.</TE>
<TE>   HBO will replay the 1999 documentary, "Unitas," Saturday at 10
a.m.... Keith Jackson and Dan Fouts will be the announcers for USC's
ABC game at Colorado on Saturday at 12:30 p.m.... Fox Sports Net's
Big 12 announcers, Joel Meyers and Dave Lampham, will handle duties
for UCLA at Oklahoma State at 4 p.m.... TBS begins its run of Pacific
10 and Big 12 games Saturday with Nevada Las Vegas at Oregon State at
4 p.m. Ron Thulin and Charles Davis are the game announcers, with
Ernie Johnson serving as host of what is being dubbed "Big Play
Saturday." TBS will also provide a Spanish-language feed.</TE>
<TE>   Fox is launching a $20-million ad campaign Sunday, promoting its
NFL and baseball lineup for October.... ESPN has two shows making
their debuts Tuesday. At 4 p.m. will be "The Focus Group," which will
give everyday fans a forum to air their likes and dislikes. Maybe one
of the topics can be all the silly programs on television. The show
that follows at 5 p.m. sounds as if it might be one of them. It's a
reality game show called "Beg, Borrow and Deal."</TE>
<TE>   In Closing</TE>
<TE>   The relationship between Shaquille O'Neal and Phil Jackson may be
better than ever. In his first interview since Wednesday's toe
surgery, Shaq told Channel 2's Jim Hill Thursday that Jackson was
among his first visitors.</TE>
<TE>   "When I woke up from my [anesthetic] state, I felt his hand, I
felt his voice and he was there," O'Neal said.</TE>

<HD>Vieira's Play a Real Knockout</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While Shane Lehmann was preparing last week to plead no contest to
misdemeanor assault stemming from a fight outside a bar, Steve Vieira
was busy knocking heads on the practice field.</LD>
<LD>   The two guards entered fall camp even, but Vieira soon burst
ahead, swatting away Lehmann's challenge like one of the Colorado
State defenders he laid out in Saturday's opener.</LD>
<LD>   Vieira, a 6-foot-6, 305-pound sophomore from Carlsbad, was
credited with 14 knockdowns against the Rams, the most a Bruin
lineman has had in several years.</LD>
<TE>   The linemen are graded during a film session each week. Senior
tackle Mike Saffer watched in amazement as his teammate racked up one
knockdown after another.</TE>
<TE>   "He kept looking at me, shaking his head," Vieira said.</TE>
<TE>   Last season Vieira started five of the last six games after
Lehmann started the first five. With a 12-game schedule plus a
possible bowl game, Vieira figures to have nearly as many starts this
season as he had knockdowns against Colorado State.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very pleased with Steve Vieira," Coach Bob Toledo said.
"He's an outstanding player."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Another lineman who played a key role in the Bruins' 215-yard
rushing performance against Colorado State was center Mike McCloskey,
a redshirt freshman starting his first game.</TE>
<TE>   "He composed himself like a veteran," Vieira said. "I looked at
his face to see if I could see any confusion or panic. There was
none."</TE>
<TE>   McCloskey was the last player given a scholarship by UCLA two
years ago. He was ready to go to the Air Force Academy when the
Bruins made an offer.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I made the right call," he said. "That was a tough thing
to turn down, but I really believed I could play big-time football
and I wanted to come to UCLA."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rashaun Woods, Oklahoma State's All-Big 12 Conference receiver,
suffered a laceration between the pinkie and ring finger on his left
hand while catching a pass Wednesday and left practice. He said he
was fine, although trainers taped the hand.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not deemed serious; he's going to play," Cowboy Coach Les
Miles said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As if Woods isn't dangerous enough, UCLA also must prepare for his
kid brother. Rashaun has 19 catches for 301 yards and three
touchdowns in two games. Freshman D'Juan Woods hasn't made a catch
yet, but he could be a target Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "He's three years behind, but he's got the same kind of skills as
his brother," Cowboy assistant Todd Monken said. "He can really catch
it."</TE>
<TE>   D'Juan, who like Rashaun is 6-2, is expected to play because John
Lewis, the third receiver behind Rashaun and Willie Young, has a
hamstring injury.</TE>

<HD>His Comeback Checked Closely</HD>
<DH>Boxing: Marshall Martinez, who might have been a
millionaire after Sydney, fights for $3,500 tonight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LANCE PUGMIRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marshall Martinez, the sure-fire Olympic medalist who wasn't, insists
he's sincere and disciplined about wanting to become a world
champion.</LD>
<LD>   One way he can prove it, he said, is to finally come clean about
the circumstances that contributed to his resignation from the 2000
U.S. boxing team.</LD>
<LD>   "When I was with the team, I did a petty crime and wrote checks
that weren't mine for no more than $200--for pizza and a pair of
shoes," Martinez said. "I didn't take the checks. I don't know who
they belonged to. But to whoever it was, I would like to tell them
I'm sorry. I was young. I made a mistake. And now I have to eat that
up."</LD>
<TE>   Martinez, 21, is deemed one of the brightest prospects in promoter
Bob Arum's Top Rank stable of fighters. With a 6-0 record and four
knockouts, the Ontario fighter will meet Tijuana's Luis Arceo (8-0,
five KOs) tonight in a six-round lightweight bout at Mandalay Bay
scheduled to be on ESPN2.</TE>
<TE>   "This fight is the one that will put me back on the map," Martinez
said.</TE>
<TE>   His previous disappearance from national attention came in the
days after USA Boxing officials announced at the America's Qualifying
event in Tampa, Fla., that Martinez, the country's 132-pound Olympic
qualifier, had left the team to turn professional.</TE>
<TE>   The obvious question--why?--has lingered without a straight answer
from Martinez. Former team spokeswoman Shilpa Bakre said recently, "I
believe we phrased it as a code-of-conduct violation." Gary Toney,
the president of USA Boxing during the Sydney Games, acknowledged,
"It was a touchy situation. He was given options and he chose to
resign."</TE>
<TE>   Officials acknowledged a box of checks was stolen from an
athlete's mailbox at U.S. Olympic Committee training headquarters in
Colorado Springs, Colo., and that an employee at a Tampa mall's shoe
store identified Martinez as the person who had written a check for
merchandise.</TE>
<TE>   Toney and former U.S. boxing coach Tom Mustin described Martinez's
departure as "tragic."</TE>
<TE>   "Marshall Martinez, in my personal opinion, would have won a medal
in Sydney," Toney said. "He was a very good boxer who was hard to
hit, tough and punched very hard. The medal he would have won would
have certainly enhanced his professional career."</TE>
<TE>   Said Mustin: "We were looking for gold from Marshall."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. team won only two medals, silvers by 125-pound Ricardo
Juarez and 139-pound Ricardo Williams. Martinez's replacement, David
Jackson, failed to make weight in his second-round match.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron Dunkin, the Top Rank manager who signed Martinez upon his
Olympic departure to a two-year contract that paid a $50,000 bonus
and $5,000 monthly salary, said Martinez probably would have gained a
$1.5-million bonus comparable to Juarez's had he remained an
Olympian.</TE>
<TE>   "Marshall was being described by boxing people as sensational, as
good as anyone coming from the Olympic team because of the fact he
was so tough and punched like crazy," Dunkin said. "I took him to the
[Fernando] Vargas-[Ike] Quartey fight, and guys are yelling,
'Marshall!' Girls are hugging him. The fans love his shaved head, the
gangster/street look--toughness attracts. I told him, 'If you just
act right for three years, you'll be rich.' "</TE>
<TE>   It was too much to ask. Martinez's two-year contract has expired.
He'll be paid according to the Top Rank schedule for a six-round bout
tonight: $3,500.</TE>
<TE>   In his first pro bout, he broke his nose in the first round,
surviving to win by decision but suffering through an extended injury
layoff followed by a surgery to repair damage suffered in training.</TE>
<TE>   Down time and Martinez were a bad combination. He said he ignored
advice from his mother, Margie Carmona, about staying fit. Dunkin
said Martinez frequently skipped training sessions, and complained
about his trainers. All the while, he was confronting jail time for a
burglary he said he was involved in at age 18.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez served three months, then returned to the ring in
February, only to suffer a broken hand. Further complicating the
issue, Martinez had an emergency appendectomy in May.</TE>
<TE>   "The kid was losing credibility around here--the lies, the
cons--people in these [Top Rank] offices were saying, 'Forget this
guy,' " Dunkin said. "Finally, the money ran out. I sat him down and
told it like it was.... I was confrontational, but when he answered,
'I know,' I had a feeling he got it."</TE>
<TE>   Martinez said he reunited with his mother, made a successful new
partnership with trainer Sal Hernandez and has been training daily at
a Baldwin Park gym.</TE>
<TE>   "I needed discipline, and the only one who can give it to me is my
mom," Martinez said. "I've got so much respect for her. When she
tells me to do something, I do it. She wants me to lose weight. I'll
do anything to avoid hearing her yell about it all the way from the
gym to home."</TE>
<TE>   Dunkin is impressed with the results. Martinez weighed 132 pounds
for the first time since his pro debut in June 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "Behind Top Rank's top two fighters, [Oscar] De La Hoya and
[Floyd] Mayweather, Marshall is definitely one of the top three young
guys in our group," Dunkin said. "He's behind [lightweight] Miguel
Cotto, but he beat Cotto in the America's Qualifier. I've just got to
get him on a roll--no more layoffs, no more injury time, no more
jail.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that he's out of money ... I think he's about to get on that
roll. We all need a good butt kicking, you know."</TE>

<HD>Chichester Setting Big Goals for Irvine</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bob Chichester, all 6 feet 5 inches of him, appears to be a gentle
giant. He speaks softly and carefully chooses his words.</LD>
<LD>   What isn't readily seen behind the mellow exterior is a
competitive fire. His wife, Phyllis, is often witness to it.</LD>
<LD>   "I compete with her when we mow the lawn," he said. "Of course, I
think I do a better job at it. I think I do a better job at the
dishes. But it burns me up sometimes because she gives me more
opportunities to get better at it."</LD>
<TE>   As he was introduced as UC Irvine's athletic director Tuesday,
Chichester said several things supporters and athletic personnel
wanted to hear. He wants more community support for Irvine athletics.
He wants athletes to excel in the classroom and represent their
school in a positive manner.</TE>
<TE>   And perhaps most important, he wants Irvine's growing program to
earn a prominent place in major college athletics. Chichester knows
what that atmosphere is like, having spent six years at Colorado--the
last three as associate athletic director in charge of 14 nonrevenue
sports.</TE>
<TE>   "Winning, to me, is not a bad word," he said. "I think great
things can come from winning."</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Chancellor Ralph Cicerone beamed in the background.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a good man," Cicerone said. "He looks like a quiet guy,
but people say he's fiery inside."</TE>
<TE>   Chichester, 45, is coming home. He was born in Inglewood and went
to Pasadena Poly High and Occidental College, playing basketball but
soon realizing his future wasn't on the hardwood.</TE>
<TE>   The law became his career choice. He was a contract legal advisor
in the Air Force and worked as an attorney for Northrop Corp. and the
United States Environmental Protection Agency. But those jobs didn't
fulfill him personally.</TE>
<TE>   "The influence and impression you can leave on young people is
very, very rewarding," he said. "If I did things over again, being a
teacher or being a coach would have been my choice."</TE>
<TE>   Dan Guerrero had Irvine thinking bigger and better before he left
to take over as athletic director at his alma mater, UCLA. Cicerone
wants to continue on that track.</TE>
<TE>   "That was one of the things I was looking for in the interviewing
process," said Cicerone, addressing Irvine's national profile. "We
want to make it so that it's not enough to get into the NCAA
tournament [in basketball]. We want to get to the Sweet 16."</TE>
<TE>   Chichester, knowing full well that men's basketball and baseball
are the sports that will define the program, shares that view. Two of
his biggest tasks in his tenure will be finding ways to keep coaches
Pat Douglass and John Savage at the school.</TE>
<TE>   Douglass has led the Anteater basketball team to consecutive
20-win seasons. Savage, one of the bright young baseball coaches in
the nation, led Irvine to a 33-26 record in its first season back
after a 10-year hiatus.</TE>
<TE>   "I want people to say that this is the hottest ticket in Orange
County," Chichester said. "Clearly, that is our next goal."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chichester got the biggest round of applause when he mentioned
Irvine's 10-7 victory over UCLA on Sunday in men's water polo. The
win boosted Irvine, which last won the NCAA title in 1989, to a No. 3
national ranking.</TE>
<TE>   This could be a special year for the Anteaters. Jeff Powers is
back after redshirting last season and the senior two-meter man will
be in the running for college player of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Powers had 73 goals in 2000 and earned first-team All-America
honors. A member of the U.S. national team, he scored six goals in
four FINA World Cup matches in August as the Americans finished
seventh.</TE>
<TE>   "Jeff adds a ton to our team," Irvine Coach Ted Newland said.
"He's not a one-dimensional player. He's really, really fast in the
water. He can get to both sides of the pool very quickly. He's got a
really good shot and he's an excellent passer."</TE>
<TE>   Irvine also has a future star in 6-foot-9 sophomore Dreason Barry.
Barry had four goals against UCLA, including two in the third period
to help the Anteaters overcome a 5-4 deficit.</TE>
<TE>   "He's just got too many tools," Newland said. "He's going to be a
big-time player."</TE>
<TE>   Both teams will be part of the Southern California Water Polo
Tournament this weekend at the USC Swim Stadium. The top 12 teams in
the U.S. Water Polo Assn. collegiate poll are in the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Loyola Marymount, off to a 3-0-1 start, pulled into the national
men's soccer rankings for the first time in school history. The Lions
are 20th in the National Soccer Coaches Assn. of America poll.... No.
4 UCLA hosts No. 11 San Diego in its home opener Sunday--a rematch of
a 4-0 victory by the Bruins in an NCAA men's second-round match last
year.... Biola softball coach Mike Smith resigned to become an
assistant at UC Riverside. He had a four-year record of 156-72 with
one Golden State Athletic Conference championship.... Rob Buska and
Mark Roberts will host a weekly radio show on Big West Conference
athletics. It will broadcast Tuesdays throughout the school year on
KWRM (1370 AM) in Orange and Riverside counties.</TE>

<HD>Unmasked Talent Has Trojans Nazel-Gazing</HD>
<DH>USC football: Defensive end's ability no longer a secret,
and coaches want him to maintain positive momentum.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The play began with a spectacular display of athleticism, the kind
that makes NFL scouts take notice. It ended with an infraction, the
kind that makes college coaches chug antacid.</LD>
<LD>   Late in the third quarter of USC's opener against Auburn, Trojan
defensive end Omar Nazel launched himself more than five feet above
the Coliseum turf and extended his 6-foot-5, 240-pound body along a
nearly perfect horizontal plane. As Nazel began his descent, however,
he inadvertently grabbed Auburn quarterback Daniel Cobb's facemask.</LD>
<LD>   "The image of me flying through the air looked great on tape and
in pictures--and I enjoyed that," Nazel said, grinning. "But it cost
my team 15 yards and kept the defense on the field for another set of
downs.</LD>
<TE>   "I can't let that happen again. My goal is to make positive
contributions."</TE>
<TE>   Nazel, a redshirt junior from Oakland, did far more right than
wrong in his first college start. He made three solo tackles,
assisted on three others, intercepted a pass and harassed Cobb
throughout a 24-17 victory.</TE>
<TE>   The performance helped Nazel establish a presence on a line that
features sophomore tackle Shaun Cody and redshirt sophomore end
Kenechi Udeze, both of whom started last season.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody at Auburn knew who I was, and I think that worked to my
advantage," Nazel said. "Now, I'm trying to let everyone know who I
am."</TE>
<TE>   Nazel gets his next opportunity Saturday, when No. 17 USC plays
No. 18 Colorado (1-1) at Boulder, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Orgeron, USC's defensive line coach, values Nazel's fiery
temperament, increasing strength and speed. But Orgeron prods Nazel
to take the next step.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to see some consistency," Orgeron said. "He needs to get
on his game every down."</TE>
<TE>   Nazel agrees--which was not always the case after he arrived from
Skyline High in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Recruited as a linebacker, Nazel was switched to defensive end
during his redshirt season. In 2000, he played in five games but did
not make a tackle.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Nazel backed up senior Lonnie Ford and Udeze. He
played in all 12 games, made 15 tackles and intercepted a pass
against Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always been emotional and outspoken, but there have been
times when it hasn't necessarily been directed in the right
direction," Nazel said. "I was being a bad seed, rebelling against my
coach when he was telling me things I didn't want to hear."</TE>
<TE>   With Ford gone this season, Nazel sensed opportunity. Not only to
play, but to change. Coach Pete Carroll, Orgeron and strength coach
Chris Carlisle encouraged Nazel to express positive opinions and keep
negative ones to himself.</TE>
<TE>   "You can tell by looking at Omar that he has the talent," Carroll
said. "He just needed to channel his emotions in a way that helps
himself and the team."</TE>
<TE>   Nazel sparked the Trojans against Auburn when he intercepted a
second-quarter pass intended for running back Carnell Williams in the
flat and returned it 15 yards to the Tiger 40-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   The turnover launched an eight-play drive that ended with a
three-yard touchdown run by Sultan McCullough and gave the Trojans a
14-7 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're a little kid, you're always saying, 'Hey, I'm going
to get a pick and run it to the house and I'm going to do this dance
when I get to the end zone,' " Nazel said. "When it happens, and they
throw the ball right to you, it's like, 'My goodness, what's going
on?' I'm just glad someone eventually scored for us."</TE>
<TE>   Nazel anticipated congratulatory comments from Orgeron when the
defensive linemen met to review tape.</TE>
<TE>   "But it wasn't a pat-on-the-back kind of film session," Nazel
said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Orgeron pointed out Nazel's mistakes, including the
facemask penalty that kept alive an Auburn drive that ended with a
field goal to tie the score, 17-17.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, the criticism might have caused Nazel to lash out at a
coach or teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, I realize the coaches are just trying to help me be the best
player I can be," Nazel said. "I respect that, and it's making me
work harder to live up to the expectations everyone is putting on me.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it's only one game. There's still a lot of work to be
done. But I'm getting there. I'm learning from my mistakes."</TE>

<HD>Simmons Is Hoping to Respond</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Bobby Otani made one tackle in five games last season as a backup
linebacker and special teams player for USC.</LD>
<LD>   The 6-foot, 210-pound sophomore could play a much more prominent
role Saturday against Colorado if starting weakside linebacker Melvin
Simmons cannot play or is slowed from the effects of an infection in
his left leg.</LD>
<LD>   "I just want to be ready and we'll see what happens," Otani said
Thursday after working with the first-unit defense.</LD>
<TE>   Simmons did not practice after being released from USC University
Hospital earlier in the day but said he would be ready to play.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to trust your body to know that what you have done so
far has prepared you," Simmons said.</TE>
<TE>   Simmons was hospitalized for two days and was treated with
intravenous antibiotics for flu-like symptoms he said first appeared
last weekend during the Trojans' bye week. Simmons practiced Monday
and Tuesday before he had fluid drained from an infection near his
left knee and was admitted to the hospital. Coach Pete Carroll said
Otani and Lee Webb would play if Simmons is unable to play or tires.
Carroll also said that middle linebacker Mike Pollard could play the
weakside spot and freshman Oscar Lua could play in the middle.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans spent considerable time reviewing special teams and
making sure players knew their assignments.</TE>
<TE>   In the second quarter of the opener against Auburn, the Trojans
were penalized for having 12 men on the field on a punt return. The
penalty kept alive a drive that resulted in a game-tying touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   USC also was short a player on an earlier punt return.</TE>
<TE>   "It was something we made a mistake on, so we really went
overboard today and should be very well-situated now," Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kicker David Davis said he would gauge the impact of kicking at a
higher altitude when the Trojans do a walk-through today at Folsom
Field.</TE>
<TE>   "We won't really know until Saturday during warmups," he said.
"I'll take all the extra distance I can get."</TE>
<TE>   Davis kicked a career-long 47-yard field goal last season against
Arizona at Tucson.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Winston Justice will start at right tackle and redshirt
junior Eric Torres will start at right guard against Colorado....
Running back Justin Fargas will suit up but is not expected to play.
Fargas is still nursing a strained right hamstring.... USC won all
four previous games against Colorado, the most recent a 17-14 victory
at the Coliseum in 2000.... Kennedy Pola, who coaches running backs
and special teams, was the running backs coach at Colorado in 1997
and 1998.... Kyle Wright, a quarterback from Danville Monte Vista
High who is regarded as one of the top recruits in the nation,
announced that he would attend Miami rather than USC or Tennessee.</TE>

<HD>Vargas served 90-day felony sentence for setting up beating
three years ago</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LANCE PUGMIRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tanya Bryant wants no part of "Bad Blood." She has seen enough of it.</LD>
<LD>   In the early-morning hours of July 25, 1999, the bedroom of
Bryant's Summerland duplex was the scene of a violent attack that
left her boyfriend, Doug Rossi, hospitalized with head injuries, body
bruises and a shattered finger.</LD>
<LD>   Fernando Vargas pleaded no contest last year for his role in
organizing the beating, accepting a felony charge of conspiracy to
commit assault. Vargas received a 90-day jail sentence that he served
while wearing an electronic ankle monitor. He also was forced to
provide 100 hours of community service, spend three years on
probation and provide restitution to Rossi, a sum placed at $200,000
by one source.</LD>
<TE>   As part of the settlement with Vargas, Rossi, 26, is barred from
recounting the assault.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant, 28, has no such restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   "Every person we talked to, from the paramedics at the scene, to
the policemen, to the doctors and the nurses, said Doug was lucky to
be alive and lucky that he wasn't paralyzed after the severity of
that beating," Bryant said. "The way he was beat, the type of weapons
used and the amount of people involved indicate to me that, yeah,
they wanted to kill him.</TE>
<TE>   "There was blood all over my room, from the door to the back wall,
to all over the carpet. Doug was red from head to toe. He had hunks
of skin torn off his head because the guys were essentially teeing
off with golf irons on his head. He had huge welts on his body from
being hit with the club shafts."</TE>
<TE>   Four of Vargas' acquaintances-- Carlos Lopez, Freddie Flores,
Vincent Arenas and Vargas' cousin, Ernesto Vargas--pleaded no contest
to assault charges and received 30-day jail sentences. Hilary Dozer,
the Santa Barbara County deputy district attorney who prosecuted the
case, said the evidence of blood splattered on Fernando Vargas' shoes
placed him no closer than four feet from the beating.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an assault instigated by Fernando Vargas," Dozer said.
"The other defendants wouldn't have been involved if not for Fernando
Vargas calling them on his cell phone and encouraging them to drive
from Oxnard to Summerland to rush the house with weapons. These guys
were hanging out, doing nothing, until their man called. Then they
did what they do. The only explanation we have for this assault
happening is that Fernando Vargas happened to be a very upset man."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant said she had never before seen the angry side of Vargas,
nicknamed "Ferocious."</TE>
<TE>   As a dancer with her roommate, Adria Reyes, at the Santa Barbara
Spearmint Rhino, Bryant said Vargas was friendly during the one
occasion he visited the adult club while she was working. She had
been told of a confrontation between Vargas and a bodyguard at the
club, Anthony Arria, in the parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Arria nor Reyes was available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   "Anthony liked Adria," Bryant said. "He had a habit of showing up
at our house after work, and Adria had never burned the bridge with
him. It was a strange relationship. I think Anthony and Fernando got
into it that night in the parking lot because Anthony was jealous
about seeing Fernando talk to Adria."</TE>
<TE>   Rossi had also worked as a bouncer at the Spearmint Rhino, but
Bryant said he had the night off when Arria and Vargas engaged in
their parking lot exchange.</TE>
<TE>   "The first time Fernando ever saw Doug's face in the light was in
the courtroom," Bryant said.</TE>
<TE>   On July 24, 1999, Bryant said she and Reyes attended Ozzy
Osbourne's Ozzfest concert in Devore, arriving home about 2 a.m.
Reyes had invited Vargas over. A friend dropped him off at the house.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant said Vargas was enjoying himself.</TE>
<TE>   "Before Doug came over that night, Fernando put on a pair of
Adria's leopard-spotted boxers and came into my room to model them,
acting goofy," Bryant said. "If what happened later had never
happened, I would've said Fernando was a great guy."</TE>
<TE>   At 4 a.m., Dozer said, Rossi had joined Bryant in her room and
Vargas was with Reyes in hers. Arria, who would later report that he
was paged by Reyes, arrived at the home, knocked on the front door,
and was let in by Rossi. Dozer said Arria knocked on Reyes' bedroom
door and Reyes told him to go away. He then walked into Reyes'
bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   Dozer said a half-clothed Vargas punched Arria upon his entry into
the room, precipitating a fight. Arria outweighed Vargas by 80 pounds
and was fully clothed.</TE>
<TE>   Pat English, an attorney for Vargas' promoter, Main Events, who
served as a consultant on the case, said Arria "attacked" Vargas in
the room. English and Bryant expressed doubts about Arria's story of
being paged by Reyes.</TE>
<TE>   Rossi broke up a fight that lasted no more than five minutes, and
Arria left. Rossi told Bryant he wanted to leave too, but she asked
him to stay.</TE>
<TE>   "Then," Dozer said, "the pages start going to Oxnard. We were able
to build a phone tree out of it, with Vargas calling guys, and those
guys calling guys."</TE>
<TE>   English argued that Vargas tried to leave the home too.</TE>
<TE>   "He was outside the home and called a cab, but the cab never
showed up," English said. "So then he called his buddies."</TE>
<TE>   Said Bryant: "If [Vargas] wanted a ride home, as he's tried to
say, one call would have done it. Not 11. And if he had been robbed,
as he tried to say, why wouldn't he just call the police?"</TE>
<TE>   The dynamic that still stumps Dozer and Bryant is what Rossi did
to so anger Vargas.</TE>
<TE>   English explained that Vargas' friends overreacted to his
roughed-up appearance at the home and proceeded to pursue Rossi
inside the home with misguided information.</TE>
<TE>   At 4:44 a.m., Bryant said she heard several loud footsteps, then
booming knocks to her bedroom door. As Rossi attempted to defend
himself, Bryant reached a phone and stood on her bed pleading for
help.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant said doctors used 13 staples to close Rossi's head wounds.
It took two surgeries and six months of rehabilitation for his index
finger to function properly. He had to give up his daytime
construction job and temporarily drew disability payments.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant said she never spent another night in the house, and
subsequently quit working at the Spearmint Rhino.</TE>
<TE>   More than three years removed from the incident, Vargas has
remained out of trouble. After pleading no contest in May 2001, he
said, "I feel very happy to get this behind me. This has made me grow
as a person. I look forward to fighting in the ring, not in court,
which is not a good place for me."</TE>
<TE>   English said Vargas was apologetic in court and remains remorseful
about the incident.</TE>
<TE>   "He has said he is responsible for putting himself in that
position, of being in the house in the first place, and for bringing
the guys there," English said. "It got out of hand, and that's not
what he intended."</TE>
<TE>   Dozer said he was satisfied with the no-contest plea, even if
Vargas didn't serve jail time.</TE>
<TE>   "Punishment is a relative concept," Dozer said. "For a guy like
Fernando Vargas, a celebrity, a felony plea can be a greater
punishment than jail time. There are issues with licensing,
marketing, promotion. Here he is getting ready for this fight with
Oscar De La Hoya, and he has to explain himself again. No
professional athlete wants to deal with that. I am satisfied that we
held him responsible in the court of public opinion."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, Bryant said she and Rossi--who have broken up but remain
friends--still fear repercussions. In agreeing to be interviewed,
Bryant said she did not want it reported where she and Rossi have
relocated.</TE>
<TE>   Rossi's anger toward Vargas has not been tempered. Rossi can't
talk about the beating, but he did allow Bryant to read a statement
he wrote:</TE>
<TE>   "Fernando's boxing career will be over soon. I feel much hatred
toward Fernando. I'm sure the feeling is mutual. I would like the
opportunity for a one-on-one, full-contact, Ultimate Fighting-type
match with him. I feel it could generate decent revenue if promoted
correctly: that a victim of assault gets a shot at his attacker. I'd
just like a more fair fight."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant, who is pursuing a college degree, said she has experienced
several anxiety attacks in public places since the assault.</TE>
<TE>   She said the disorder has forced her to take the medication Zanex.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm medicated every day," she said. "I can't be in public
places.... This has definitely been detrimental to my health."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant has taken to writing letters to newspapers whenever she
reads a positive story about Vargas. She said she turns the channel
when television advertisements and stories involving Vargas are
aired. Bryant insists she will not watch Saturday's fight.</TE>
<TE>   Said Bryant: "What bothers me is when I think: 'What has changed
for him?' Nothing. And, 'What has changed for us?' Everything."</TE>

<HD>Road Grader Gets Tested for Class Today</HD>

<LD>There are few throwouts today in the $50,000 Foothill Stakes, the
feature on the 11-race opening-day card at Fairplex Park.</LD>
<LD>   The most intriguing horse in the 10-horse Foothill for
three-year-olds is Arizona-bred Road Grader, who has already run 24
times and is a dual derby winner at Turf Paradise and Yavapai Downs,
tracks in Arizona. Recently, I made my first bet ever on a Yavapai
(YAV-a-pie) race, at a racebook in Las Vegas, and the clerk said to
me: "You're the first one I've had who's ever said the name of that
track right." Unfortunately, it was the right pronunciation, but the
wrong horse. I won't be betting Yavapai horses anytime soon.</LD>
<LD>   Road Grader, for all his stakes credentials, is more suited for
longer distances than the 6 1/2-furlong Foothill around the sharp
turns at Fairplex. Crooked Key ran twice at Fairplex as a 2-year-old,
winning an allowance at six furlongs. The 3-year-old gray gelding is
going back to dirt after three tries on grass. Chaos N Confusion is
making his first start since trainer Wesley Ward claimed him from Bob
Baffert for $62,500 at Del Mar on Aug. 28. The colt was used up early
and ran fifth in that start, his first race back since breaking his
maiden on opening day at Santa Anita last year.</LD>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Jewel Case. 2. Black Team. 3. Taylorman. 4. Cookie
Cutouts. 5. Bronx. 6. A Colt For David. 7. Danceascore. 8. Further.
9. Buttertart. 10. Chaos N Confusion. 11. Culley.</TE>

<HD>Beginning of End for Fairplex?</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: L.A. County Fair meet begins today amid
speculation of a move next year to Santa Anita.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In what could be a farewell season in Pomona, the Los Angeles County
Fair launches its 64th meet today with an 11-race card at Fairplex
Park.</LD>
<LD>   While the Pomona fixture, first run in 1933, appears headed for
Santa Anita in the next and future years, there are trainers--wishful
thinkers, perhaps--who say, in the way of the Ira Gershwin lyric,
that it ain't necessarily so.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't believe they're going to move next year, at least I hope
not," said Barry Abrams, who won seven races at the fair last year,
finishing third in the trainer standings. "The Breeders' Cup is at
Santa Anita next fall. I don't think they'd want to risk tearing up
the grass course with the extra dates ahead of that. But then again,
Oak Tree has the Breeders' Cup meet at Santa Anita, and Santa Anita
itself wants the fair dates. So if Santa Anita gets the dates, they
might not care what happens during Oak Tree."</LD>
<TE>   Fairplex and Santa Anita had a five-year deal to move the Pomona
dates to the Arcadia track, but the California Horse Racing Board
rejected the move at a meeting in June. Some board members said,
however, that they might change their votes if the proposal came up
again.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't usually run horses at Pomona," said Ron McAnally, a Hall
of Fame trainer, "but if they're going to move the dates, I don't
think Santa Anita should monopolize them. Why don't they rotate the
dates among the three tracks? Run them at Santa Anita one year, then
Hollywood Park the next year, and then Del Mar the year after that."</TE>
<TE>   Of the 11 races today, seven are for horses that have never won. A
year ago, there were five maiden races on opening day. The
traditional opening-day feature, the Foothill Stakes, will be run
today for $50,000.</TE>
<TE>   One of today's allowance races drew only five horses.</TE>
<TE>   Mel Stute, who's atop the career trainer standings at Pomona with
167 wins, can't pinpoint the year he won his first race at Pomona.</TE>
<TE>   "It might have been 1948," he said. "I know it was before I was
married, and I was married in 1950."</TE>
<TE>   Stute, 75, has led the standings or tied for the title seven
times.</TE>
<TE>   "My barn's pretty light right now," Stute said. "We're down to 13
horses."</TE>
<TE>   But one of the 13--who won't be running at Pomona--is
Buffythecenterfold, a stakes-winning 2-year-old filly who might earn
Stute another trip to the Breeders' Cup. The race that will determine
her status is the Oak Leaf Stakes, during the Oak Tree-at-Santa Anita
meet, on Oct. 6.</TE>
<TE>   The Breeders' Cup will be run on Oct. 26 at Arlington Park. Stute,
who hasn't had a Breeders' Cup starter since 1988, won the Juvenile
Fillies--the race Buffythecenterfold would run in--with Brave Raj in
1986 and captured the Sprint with Very Subtle in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sad that this might be the end of racing at Pomona," Stute
said. "I've always liked the place."</TE>
<TE>   Another trainer, Craig Lewis, who finished tied for fourth in the
Pomona standings with six wins last year, seems resigned to this
being the last meet at Fairplex.</TE>
<TE>   "Pomona's a nice place to race, and it's got a lot of tradition,
but I suppose this is going to be it," Lewis said. "The unfortunate
part is that we [the trainers] have no say in the outcome. Moving the
dates to Santa Anita is going to squeeze the little guy, but I guess
the little guy is already squeezed in this game."</TE>

<HD>A Busy Weekend for Gomez</HD>

<LD>Talk about a busy guy.</LD>
<LD>   Trainer Jaime Gomez has 13 horses entered in tonight's trials of
the Pacific Coast Quarter Horse Racing Assn. Breeders Futurity.</LD>
<LD>   He's following that by entering two of the most successful horses
of the year, Babe Watcher and Sassy Smith, in Saturday's PCQHRA Derby
trials. Gomez's horses swept the events last season.</LD>
<TE>   Among the 2-year olds trained by Gomez that are expected to make
it to post tonight are Suzy Cartel (sixth), Special Queen Sa (fifth),
Azyoucansee (second), Corona Man (fifth) and Strawfly Te (fourth).
The first three have already finished in the money in at least one
major futurity this season.</TE>
<TE>   In the seventh, jockey Joe Badilla will be aboard Super Caper,
another Gomez entry who is coming off a successful stint at Ruidoso
Downs in New Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   A total of 65 horses are expected to compete in eight trials of
350 yards each. Horses with the top 10 times advance to the $345,000
final on Sept. 28.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Brite FX. 2. Corona Magic. 3. Azyoucansee. 4. Stel
Corona. 5. Special Queen SA. 6. Lonely Moon Sign. 7. Style N Grace.
8. Pats Charming Guy. 9. Deefirst. 10. A Dash Of Apollo.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Brite FX in the first race, Corona Magic, Red Lipstick and
Dashnlitia in the second, Azyoucansee in the third and Strawfly Te,
Stel Corona and Throwin A Fit in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: And who does Gomez like in the futurity? He
thinks Corona Man in the fifth could be a darkhorse after failing to
show his potential in early races. In the seventh, Royal Classic
Express looked good in drills at the end of August. Will it be back
to top form in the fifth against Corona Man? Loves That Gold in the
eighth race has won back-to-back starts at the claiming level and is
still 8-1 on the morning line.</TE>

<KH>NHL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Kings Hoping to Add Youth</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe; Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is with the clear intention of making themselves younger that the
Kings will open training camp this morning in El Segundo.</LD>
<LD>   With Kelly Buchberger, Nelson Emerson, King-for-a-month Cliff
Ronning and their combined 2,820 games of NHL experience dispatched
elsewhere this summer, the Kings are looking to add a more youthful
look to their forward corps.</LD>
<LD>   The most highly regarded of their rookie forwards are Alexander
Frolov, a 20-year-old Russian, and three 20-year-old
Canadians--Michael Cammalleri, Jared Aulin and Yanick Lehoux. None
has played in an NHL game.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, defenseman Andreas Lilja (NHL experience: 28 games) is
expected to fill the void left when Philippe Boucher, a veteran of
377 NHL games, signed with the Dallas Stars in July as an
unrestricted free agent. And a rookie, Joe Corvo, could land a spot
among the defensive corps.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to build on the success of a 95-point regular season and a
third consecutive trip to the playoffs, the Kings are seriously
considering adding two rookies to their top two lines. Given the best
chance of making the leap are Frolov, rookie of the year in the
Russian Elite League last season, and Cammalleri, who gave up his
senior year at Michigan to sign with the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Heinze, for one, will have a hand in determining the
rookies' fate. If the veteran winger regains the form that led to a
promising start last season before a disappointing second half, it
will leave one less spot open. Aulin and Lehoux, the former acquired
from the Avalanche in the Rob Blake trade, also have been much hyped
by the Kings. But it surely must have been disappointing to the club
that they were out-played during a summer development camp by Coach
Andy Murray's 17-year-old son, Brady, a high school senior.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Kings are determined to make their youth movement work.
"That's our big hope, our young players," Andy Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Crowe</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mighty Duck defenseman Fredrik Olausson, a key free-agent signing,
left practice early on the first day of training camp Thursday
because of a sore groin muscle. He will get limited practice time
until it heals.</TE>
<TE>   Olausson signed a $1.1-million contract over the summer. He was
brought in to help improve the Ducks' power play, which ranked last
in the NHL last season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Duck assistant General Manager David McNab said that the NHL is
serious about eliminating obstruction. McNab and Coach Mike Babcock
were the Ducks' representatives at a meeting in Toronto on Tuesday
with Commissioner Gary Bettman, team executives, coaches and on-ice
officials.</TE>
<TE>   "This is it," McNab said. "They are going to go through with it
this time. If you make a mistake on the ice, you can't do something
illegal to make up for it."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Kariya, however, is not convinced. "They have been going to
do this for the last four or five years," he said, "and every time
it's a wrestling match out there by midseason."</TE>
