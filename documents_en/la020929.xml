<HD>Prince Charles Not Shy About Sharing His Political Views</HD>
<DH>Royalty: The heir to the British throne writes to lawmakers
on topics ranging from hunting to felling trees. Some say he should
run for office if he wants a role.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUE LEEMAN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>He's already known as a critic of modern architecture, an advocate of
organic farming and a fan of hunting with hounds.</LD>
<LD>   But Prince Charles, it seems, is also a foe of political
correctness and what he calls an "American-style" growth in personal
litigation.</LD>
<LD>   Charles' office, which confirmed that he has been sharing his
opinions with government ministers, says it's part of his royal role.</LD>
<TE>   Officially, the government doesn't mind. Prime Minister Tony Blair
"has an excellent relationship with the Prince of Wales and welcomes
the fact that he keeps in touch with him and other ministers,"
Blair's office said.</TE>
<TE>   The Daily Mail newspaper reported that the heir to the throne has
been writing regularly to government ministers to protest everything
from the "politically correct" felling of a row of horse-chestnut
trees to the way meals are cooked for the elderly.</TE>
<TE>   To the fiercely royalist Daily Mail -- which accused the
government of leaking the letters in an effort to shame Charles --
this was only the prince doing his bit for the common man. But one
Labor lawmaker said the prince should run for Parliament if he wants
a more political role.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's not kid ourselves that Prince Charles is a representative
of ordinary people. This is someone who was born with a mouthful of
silver spoons, a mega-wealthy farmer who's looking for things to do
so he fires off letters," Ian Davidson, who represents a district in
Glasgow, Scotland, told British Broadcasting Corp. radio.</TE>
<TE>   But Lord Russell, a member of the House of Lords, said the right
to advise "is the central role of monarchy" -- a line adopted by
Charles' office at St. James's Palace.</TE>
<TE>   "The Prince of Wales takes an active interest in all aspects of
British life and believes that as well as celebrating success, part
of his role must be to highlight problems and represent views in
danger of not being heard," said his spokeswoman, speaking on
condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, the royals stay out of politics, but Charles has
spoken out on a range of pet subjects. At times, he has shown the
kind of bluntness associated with his father, Prince Philip.</TE>
<TE>   The Daily Mail said Charles -- who recently wrote the prime
minister urging him not to ban hunting -- "has been engaged in a
long-running campaign of letter-writing" to Lord Chancellor Lord
Irvine, Britain's top legal official.</TE>
<TE>   In one, Charles reportedly inveighed against "the very real and
growing prospect of an American-style personal injury 'culture'
becoming ever more prevalent in this country."</TE>
<TE>   In another, Charles reportedly complained about "the degree to
which our lives are becoming ruled by a truly absurd degree of
politically correct interference," citing the case of seven mature
horse-chestnut trees felled last year by a local council that feared
falling nuts might injure passersby.</TE>
<TE>   And he was said to complain about a growth of red tape affecting
homes for the elderly, including the stipulation that wooden chopping
boards be replaced with color-coded plastic ones, which proved less
hygienic.</TE>

<HD>Milosevic Blames French, Serbs for Muslim Massacre</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>THE HAGUE, Netherlands</DL>
<LD>Slobodan Milosevic defied U.N. prosecutors Friday, contending the
massacre of Muslims in eastern Bosnia of which he is accused was
devised by French spies and carried out by renegade Serb
paramilitaries.</LD>
<LD>   The former Yugoslav president, charged with 66 counts of war
crimes from 1991-1995, including genocide, also dismissed the
testimony from the prosecution's first Croatian Serb witness -- who
accused the Milosevic-bankrolled nationalist Serb forces of ethnic
bloodletting.</LD>
<LD>   In the second phase of his trial, which started Thursday,
Milosevic faces 61 counts of war crimes for atrocities allegedly
committed under his authority.</LD>
<TE>   During the first phase of the trial, involving events in Kosovo,
Milosevic was charged with five counts of crimes against humanity and
violations of the laws or customs of war for events between 1998 and
1999.</TE>
<TE>   Milosevic denied involvement in the July 1995 murder of
approximately 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica,
asserting that Bosnian Serb paramilitaries were paid by the French
secret service to carry out the executions.</TE>
<TE>   Milosevic said that neither he nor Bosnian Serb wartime commanders
Gen. Ratko Mladic and Gen. Radislav Krstic were involved. "I'm sure
that military honor would never have permitted them to execute
innocent civilians," Milosevic said.</TE>
<TE>   Krstic was convicted last year of genocide for commanding Serb
forces in Bosnia. Mladic, indicted by the court in 1995, is at large.</TE>

<HD>Indiana Jones Fantasy Thrives in Dank Basement</HD>
<DH>Egypt: Cairo Museum sorts through dusty recesses and finds
antiquities that curators forgot. An exhibition is set for December.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DONNA BRYSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>Gaston Maspero, the first director of Egypt's national storehouse of
ancient treasures, is said to have believed that his museum should
resemble pharaohs' tombs -- crowded with paintings and statues,
furniture and jewelry.</LD>
<LD>   One hundred years after the Cairo Museum opened, its basement, at
least, is everything that the French Egyptologist could have hoped
for. Wandering through its shadowy maze is like exploring the inside
of a pyramid.</LD>
<LD>   Here, a flashlight beam picks out a 3-foot-long bearded stone bust
of a pharaoh resembling those at Luxor and Karnak that date back some
4,600 years. There, a trio of cupids straight out of a Victorian
cemetery form an incongruous honor guard for a dark stone Pharaonic
figure in the familiar pose -- arms straight at the sides, left foot
forward, face imperious. A corner devoted to stone pedestals and
capitals could be a spare-parts shop for a classical architect.</LD>
<TE>   For the most part, the basement is off-limits to all but museum
staff and researchers. A reporter recently was permitted a rare
visit. Once inside, it is something of an Indiana Jones fantasy,
minus the snakes.</TE>
<TE>   Just getting here was an excavation of sorts through several
layers of skeptical bureaucracy before a curator opened a safe's
heavy door and handed a set of keys to an assistant. Another
assistant grabbed a pair of cutters for the wire and lead seal on the
basement gate.</TE>
<TE>   Permissions granted, seal snipped, gate and door unlocked, and
then it is down a sloping cement floor, under a low arch, a sharp
right past three dusty fire extinguishers to another locked door,
this one iron and guarded by an empty stone sarcophagus. A pause
while a member of the party goes back to the office for more keys.</TE>
<TE>   Once inside the main chamber, the honking, tire-squealing
cacophony of downtown Cairo is muffled. The first stop is an area
cleared to store the 150 or so items of "Hidden Treasures of the
Egyptian Museum," an exhibition set to open Dec. 9 to showcase
objects long hidden in the basement and other storage sites.</TE>
<TE>   The "Hidden Treasures" include two sphinxes the size of beagles,
one headless, standing chest-to-chest on the cement floor under cowls
of bubble wrap. On shelves behind sheets of clear plastic are a
graceful, shallow stone vessel marbled in gray and charcoal, and
delicately detailed funerary statues of workers doing tasks for the
royal dead -- offering beer, grinding grain. They haven't been dated
yet, but resemble those found in the tomb of Tutankhamen, who ruled
more than 3,300 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   For years, museum curator Elham Salah had seen the basement as
merely a place for leftovers. Then came an order from the
irrepressible Zahi Hawass, director of the Supreme Council of
Antiquities, to choose items for "Hidden Treasures." That opened her
eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a discovery," she said. "We conducted an excavation inside
the basement itself."</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the sense of intrigue, most items in the basement are
what Salah called "unpublished objects" -- those yet to be studied
and placed into the context of Egypt's history. Curators are
contacting excavation leaders and others, and comparing the
no-longer-hidden treasures to pieces about which more is known to
prepare to tell their stories for the exhibition.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the basement treasures are tagged, although dust and time
have obscured some information. Pieces from the museum's holdings are
cataloged, but the basement has also become the resting place for
items from excavations and overflow from other museums for which
there's no central registry. Until planned cataloging of the entire
basement begins in earnest, it will be difficult to determine how
complete the basement records are, and how many pieces may remain
mysteries forever.</TE>
<TE>   As they explored in preparation for the "Hidden Treasures" show,
scholars grabbed whatever caught their eye. "It could take days and
days" to find a specific object, Salah said. With each step deeper
into the basement, it became clear why.</TE>
<TE>   Wires snaking along the brick walls feed bulbs, their light
penetrating the gloom just enough to reveal a scene of orderly
neglect: Wooden crates sprouting straw, cardboard boxes that once
held bottled water, suitcases of treasures arranged on shelves and
covered with dust that looks as if it has been collecting there since
the museum opened on Nov. 15, 1902.</TE>
<TE>   A crate that had lost its lid revealed beach-ball-sized
terra-cotta vessels nestled in crumpled paper and dust. Unboxed
larger pieces include a life-size prone human figure on a high shelf.
The eerie figure, arms thrust to the ceiling in what looks like rigor
mortis, set off a debate among a museum guard and assistant curators.
A mummy? A flashlight revealed that it was a wooden statue.</TE>
<TE>   The mummy was farther on, resting in a richly carved and painted
wooden sarcophagus, its lid ajar enough to allow a glimpse of
dust-blackened wrappings.</TE>
<TE>   As time passed, the basement seemed to get hotter and damper. The
east bank of the Nile is only a block away, but there are no obvious
signs of water damage on the walls, low ceiling or art. Hawass,
though, is concerned that some of the treasures may have been damaged
by years of neglect.</TE>
<TE>   He took a look in the basement not long after being promoted to
Egypt's top archeology job in March. Out of curiosity, he tried --
and failed -- to find boxes he had sent to the museum from a dig he
oversaw in the mid-1970s of a site from 2,300 years ago when
Greco-Roman pharaohs ruled Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   "That basement -- it was for me like a site that had not been
excavated yet," said Hawass, whose broad smile and enthusiasm for all
things Egyptologic are familiar to TV viewers worldwide, most
recently on a National Geographic special about the secrets of the
Great Pyramid.</TE>
<TE>   Hawass estimates that the basement holds some 100,000 items, about
as many as in the galleries above that are open to the public. He has
ordered every basement piece cleaned, cataloged and transferred to
new storage quarters to be built next to the museum.</TE>
<TE>   The old basement will be remodeled into study areas for
researchers, new work space for the museum's restoration team and a
gallery to show off pieces lost in storage for years.</TE>
<TE>   The project will begin with the "Hidden Treasures" show as part of
the museum's 100th birthday celebration. There are no plans yet to
take the exhibition abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the artifacts in the museum's downtown building will
eventually be moved to the much larger Grand Egyptian Museum,
expected to open in five years on the edge of the desert near the
pyramids. The old museum will be devoted to a few thousand
masterpieces.</TE>

<DL>SHOMALI VALLEY, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Standing in the ruins of a former Afghan army post, Hazrat Gul, a
35-year-old Kuchi tribesman, balances himself on one good prosthetic
leg and a pair of crutches as he watches his small flock of sheep.</LD>
<LD>   Nine years ago, not far from where he stands, Gul stepped on a
land mine while tending a flock in this valley that Afghans call
Dashti Shimtala, "desert of grass." Both his legs were blown off.</LD>
<LD>   Ringed by jagged mountains, the Shomali Valley is 19 miles from
the noise and confusion of the capital, Kabul. Dashti Shimtala has
been a grazing stop for Afghanistan's nomads and the Gul clan for as
long as anyone can remember.</LD>
<TE>   Today, four years of drought have made the sea of grass mostly
dust. Nearby streams are paths of dry stones. Unexploded land mines
remain a danger across the harsh landscape.</TE>
<TE>   Clouds of dust whip over and through Gul's tent. Inside, seven
daughters, ranging in age from 1 to 13, wait out the storm. Outside,
Gul and his sons keep watch over the sheep.</TE>
<TE>   "Before the drought, we had 200, 300 sheep. Now there are 20
left," Gul said.</TE>
<TE>   The Kuchis are one of the many ethnic tribes in Afghanistan. For
centuries, they have wandered in the region along the frontier with
Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Life is simple. Keep moving, searching for any pasture they can
find for their animals. It takes three hours to pack the tent and
gather the few possessions. Donkeys or camels carry the load.</TE>
<TE>   There is no education for most Kuchi children or basic health
care. The Kuchis have no television or Internet, and show little
interest in what might be happening beyond the horizon.</TE>
<TE>   "Sept. 11, World Trade Center, what is that?" Gul said when asked
about the events that led to the fighting that drove out the Taliban
regime.</TE>
<TE>   Standing nearby, listening to the conversation, Lal Mohammad, a
weathered Kuchi of 85, joins in while bracing against a new cloud of
dust.</TE>
<TE>   "What does any of this matter?" he asked. "We are Kuchis; we are
free."</TE>

<HD>Shhh! Madrid Says Stop Racket</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL WOOLLS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>MADRID</DL>
<LD>Visitors to Madrid have much to marvel over: splendid architecture,
sizzling nightlife, great food and people who scream at each other.</LD>
<LD>   The Spanish penchant for loudness -- mouths, TVs and myriad other
outlets -- kicks in early and stays. Listen to 4-year-olds at play,
or men talking soccer over a pre-luncheon vermouth. And until now,
exploding decibels were OK.</LD>
<LD>   But Madrid's city hall, itself blamed for much of the racket in
this city of 3 million and facing elections next spring, has launched
a blitz to encourage quiet.</LD>
<TE>   "SSSHHH. Control your noise" as the campaign is called, began
Sept. 13 and is due to last through the end of 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Fingers raised to their lips, a dozen blue-clad mime artists have
begun to roam bustling streets with a choreographed skit urging
children and adults to speak softly. Two city landmarks, the statues
of Cibeles and Neptune, appear in posters with the same hushed pose.</TE>
<TE>   City hall says a planned Web page will offer these and other hints
for making Madrid acoustically gentler: wear slippers around the
house, refrain from slamming doors and don't remodel your apartment
at night.</TE>
<TE>   Placido Perera, head of noise at the city's environmental
protection unit, insisted that reminding grown-ups not to yell isn't
insulting: . "There are a lot of things that are just common sense,
but which people don't embrace as such."</TE>
<TE>   Perera, whose first name means placid, said that after 30 years of
studying noise, he's concluded that Madrid is indeed loud, although
probably no worse than other major European cities.</TE>
<TE>   The noisiest of 23 spots in Madrid that are monitored nonstop --
Paseo de Recoletos, a downtown thoroughfare -- peaks at about 71
decibels, he said. Noise becomes potentially hazardous to people's
hearing at about 80 decibels.</TE>
<TE>   What sets Madrid apart, Perera said, is that residents whining
about noise often have themselves to blame. The campaign aims to curb
things like speaking in bellows, honking a split second after a
traffic light turns green and vociferous late-night carousing along
narrow streets. "These are very Spanish behaviors," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A busy Spanish coffee shop at breakfast serves up another prime
example of the national din: diners struggle to be heard as plates
rattle, the television blares, and coin-spitting slot machines bleep
and whir.</TE>
<TE>   Why all the yelling in the first place?</TE>
<TE>   Tongue planted firmly in cheek, the late Spanish poet Leon Felipe
addressed the issue in 1942 in an essay titled "Why Spaniards Talk So
Loud." He said one reason may be they descend from Rodrigo de Triana,
Christopher Columbus' lookout who spotted land and simply did his
job. "Tierra!" he cried.</TE>
<TE>   Sociologist Alberto Moncada says it may be about projecting power
and starts at a tender age.</TE>
<TE>   "We start screaming from the time we are in day care," said
Moncada, who happens to live right above a day-care center and
reports epic shouting matches. "We are not taught not to scream."</TE>
<TE>   Among adults, he added, "there is a sort of notion that talking
loud is a show of personality. What I see is that when people speak
slowly and in a soft voice, it's as if they feel humiliated."</TE>
<TE>   Perera says Spain is an example of a Mediterranean culture in
which nice weather leads people to spend lots of time outdoors, where
louder discourse is a necessity. The problem is they take those
decibels back home with them, or to the office.</TE>
<TE>   In Madrid, of course, not all the noise is human. People are so
weary from Mayor Jose Maria Alvarez del Manzano's seemingly endless
road work and construction -- and the drone of jackhammers and
bulldozers -- that one joke says Madrid will be a great city when
it's finished.</TE>
<TE>   In one downtown district, people have hung banners over their
balconies proclaiming themselves victims of acoustic contamination.</TE>
<TE>   But Perera denied suggestions that City Hall is trying to shift
blame for the city's noise problems to the people who put up with
them.</TE>

<HD>Alaskans in Uproar Over Proposed Cutbacks in Last Flagstop
Train</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>RACHEL D'ORO</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>TALKEETNA, Alaska</DL>
<LD>From the railroad track, John Strasenburgh's cabin is an hour's walk
through the Alaska wilderness. Without the train, it would take him
at least seven hours to hike in from the nearest road.</LD>
<LD>   "The train is absolutely essential to me," the retired bank
auditor said.</LD>
<LD>   But Strasenburgh, 56, and his neighbors stand to lose much of a
train service that stops for people who wave it down along a remote
55-mile stretch of rail.</LD>
<TE>   The Alaska Railroad Corp. is considering drastic cuts to the last
regular flagstop run in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the state-owned railroad say the Hurricane Turn
run, although popular with local residents and outdoor enthusiasts,
is a money-loser. They say the proposed reductions are necessary
because of the loss of a multimillion-dollar coal-hauling contract.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to get rid of the flagstop service entirely. We
recognize it is unique," said railroad spokesman Patrick Flynn. "But
we have to balance what people want and what we can afford."</TE>
<TE>   The railroad board will vote Thursday on several staff
recommendations affecting flagstop service between Talkeetna and
Hurricane, 130 miles north of Anchorage.</TE>
<TE>   Meeting in Fairbanks, the seven-member panel will consider cutting
summer runs from four days a week to weekends only. They will also
vote on a 9% fare increase for rides on the 50-year-old
self-propelled diesel cars. Current summer rates are $65 round-trip,
less for frequent riders and shorter distances.</TE>
<TE>   The board is also considering eliminating the limited winter
service on the Hurricane Turn. Weekend flagstop service would be
available on a locomotive between Anchorage and Fairbanks all winter.</TE>
<TE>   Johne Binkley, board chairman, said he is waiting to hear from the
public before deciding on his vote, adding that service cutbacks are
not a given.</TE>
<TE>   Still, outraged locals have formed a grass-roots effort opposing
the changes. They've flooded the railroad with letters urging the
board to maintain the current service. They plan to testify at the
Fairbanks board meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "The changes would mean a drastic lifestyle change for many
people," said Mark Butler, 48, a cabin owner who leads the "Friends
of the Flag Stop" campaign. He said cuts in service will lead to
scores of locals trespassing on the railroad right of way to get to
their cabins.</TE>
<TE>   Butler's cabin is among some 175 structures -- mostly recreational
homes -- within 10 miles of the route, according to Matanuska-Susitna
Borough assessment records. The area is predominantly spruce and
birch forest, marked by lakes and streams offering closely guarded
fishing spots among fishermen. The Susitna River borders the southern
part of the track.</TE>
<TE>   On clear days, travelers can see Mt. McKinley, North America's
highest peak.</TE>
<TE>   Save for a harried weekend trek, opponents say, all this is lost
without regular train service for those without snowmobiles or
all-terrain vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Patsy and Clyde Krompacky, who own a cabin in Chulitna, 50 miles
north of Talkeetna, are among the few permanent residents on the
route. The nearest road is seven miles to the west, but the train has
worked fine during the decade they've lived there full-time.</TE>
<TE>   Patsy Krompacky, 51, said weekend runs would allow just one day
for errands in Talkeetna -- a week if she missed the ride back.</TE>
<TE>   "What if you need to see a doctor? Most doctors don't work on
Saturdays," Krompacky said. "We need to keep the train service the
way it is."</TE>
<TE>   Railroad officials say they have little choice.</TE>
<TE>   "The Hurricane Turn has never, ever, paid for itself," Flynn said.
"If the railroad was a purely private company, that service would
have been killed eons ago."</TE>
<TE>   Operating the flag stop cost $200,000 in 2001, and the railroad
took in only $64,000 from ticket sales -- a $136,000 loss, officials
said. Proposed cuts would halve the cost and bring in an estimated
$48,000 in revenue, easing the loss to $52,000.</TE>
<TE>   Absorbing the greater loss is no longer feasible for the railroad,
which last year took in $107.3 million in revenue and earned $6.6
million in profit.</TE>
<TE>   Revenues will be slashed by $4 million a year with the terminated
deal to haul coal from the Usibelli coal mine.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents wonder why it's so important to target a minor player
such as the Hurricane Turn to resolve financial setbacks.</TE>
<TE>   They say instead of cutting service, the railroad should do a
better job of promoting it.</TE>
<TE>   "The railroad has taken millions of dollars in federal funds to
maintain infrastructure, haul freight and fuel for corporations, to
carry huge amounts of tourists," Strasenburgh said. "So what about
Alaskans? It seems patently unfair to cut us out."</TE>
<TE>   Federal funds can be used only for capital costs such as building
depots and straightening ties, not to subsidize operating expenses,
said Wendy Lindskoog, the railroad's director of external affairs.</TE>
<TE>   She noted that there are other cost-saving measures, including a
hiring freeze and minimum winter maintenance on the south line
affected by the coal cutoff.</TE>

<HD>Family Weathers Winters at 9,400 Feet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRETT FRENCH</AU>
<BD>THE BILLINGS GAZETTE</BD>
<DL>ALONG THE BEARTOOTH HIGHWAY, Wyo.</DL>
<LD>The heavyset motorcycle rider leaned his black leather bulk over the
counter.</LD>
<LD>   "Where do you winter?" he asked store owner Bart Milam, 35.</LD>
<LD>   "Here," Milam responded.</LD>
<TE>   "Here?" the motorcyclist replied. Yes, Bart and Kristi Milam and
their four children winter and summer at the Top of the World, a
small Wyoming general store, motel and campground sitting at 9,400
feet above sea level, just across the border from Montana.</TE>
<TE>   Kristi home-schools the children, takes care of the motel and
keeps the books. Bart tends the store with the help of two summer
employees and visiting relatives. He also tends to the generator that
runs 24 hours a day, seven days a week. He pumps gas and keeps the
family's small fleet of snowmobiles running and the woodstove stoked
in the winter.</TE>
<TE>   The store is nestled in pine trees about halfway between the
Montana towns of Cooke City and Red Lodge along U.S. Highway 212 --
the Beartooth Highway that loops south into Wyoming.</TE>
<TE>   The northeast access road to Yellowstone National Park is a
68-mile stretch of sinuous, sometimes gut-wrenching pavement that at
times seems more hospitable to mountain goats than cars. The road is
plowed open at the start of summer and remains open to autos until
closed by snow in the fall. At this altitude, that's early.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the striking terrain, travelers often comment on the
remoteness of Top of the World. There are no phone or power lines, so
the family relies on cell phones and often drives a few miles down
the road to get a signal. The mail comes once a week, and the Milam
mailbox is 14 miles down the road.</TE>
<TE>   But about 250,000 people travel the Beartooth Highway during the
summer, so it never seems isolated to the Milams.</TE>
<TE>   They use their satellite Internet service to place orders or to
e-mail friends who are coming to visit.</TE>
<TE>   The Milams bought the store two years ago from Phil and Carol
Napoli, who ran it each summer for 23 years.</TE>
<TE>   The store's location is one reason it's so popular, Phil Napoli,
62, said from his current home in Powell, Wyo.</TE>
<TE>   "The American public can't travel 68 miles without stopping
someplace," he said. "It's lasted because the owners have had some
kind of other income or enjoy the lifestyle.</TE>
<TE>   "Like most tourist businesses, it's just marginally profitable."</TE>
<TE>   The store, a four-unit motel, shop and 10 campground sites all sit
on Shoshone National Forest land.</TE>
<TE>   The 1,000-square-foot store is stuffed to the gills with unusual
gifts, snacks, toys, guide books, fishing gear, liquor and T-shirts.</TE>
<TE>   "Clothing or novelties are the most popular items," Bart Milam
said. But he also sells lots of Wyoming fishing licenses to Montanans
and hundreds of offbeat shot glasses.</TE>
<TE>   Karen King of Randolph, N.J., is fairly representative of the sort
of customer the store attracts. She stopped for a cold drink and a
snack but ended up buying a silver bracelet.</TE>
<TE>   Dispensing information to tourists such as King and regular
clients who have returned each year for decades is just part of doing
business at Top of the World.</TE>
<TE>   "You're like the clearinghouse for the whole area," Napoli said.
That includes rescue information when there's a snowmobile accident
or a bear attack in the area. The Milams have a two-way radio with
which they can call the sheriff in Cody, Wyo. -- more than 70 miles
away.</TE>
<TE>   Before moving to the mountains, the Milams were wheat farmers.
Kristi Milam, 34, laughs at a customer's suggestion that the couple
may get bored in the winter.</TE>
<TE>   "We have four kids," she said.</TE>

<HD>Courtney's Just Horsing Around</HD>
<DH>Rehab: Girl can barely walk, but she can ride. She finds
freedom at a trot as she strengthens muscles weakened by cerebral
palsy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BAILEY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>LEXINGTON, Ky.</DL>
<LD>"Walk on." With those two words, Courtney Marshall enters another
world -- a world in which she is able to move freely.</LD>
<LD>   "Walk on," she tells her horse, Chico, who slowly carries her
forward, bringing a grin to her face.</LD>
<LD>   Like many 10-year-olds, she doesn't say much to those she doesn't
know, especially when she's on her horse. She smiles bashfully and
tucks her chin to her chest when addressing someone for the first
time. But unlike most 10-year-olds, Courtney needs the help of a
walker or an extra set of hands to steady her.</LD>
<TE>   She was born with spastic diplegia, a form of cerebral palsy that
prevented her from developing leg muscles strong enough to support
her. Her movements are awkward.</TE>
<TE>   As her brilliant blue eyes dance playfully behind tiny oval
glasses, she glances to her mother for support and her fingers
nervously twirl locks of her hair.</TE>
<TE>   Ask about the tricks she can do while astride Chico, however, and
any hint of shyness evaporates.</TE>
<TE>   "I can ride on my hands and knees," she says proudly, her voice
rising with a strength it lacked moments before. "I can ride backward
... and forward ... and sideways. I can throw a ball."</TE>
<TE>   Anything else? "Yeah," she says. "I can trot. I really like to
trot."</TE>
<TE>   Suzi Luciano recalls the day she brought her daughter to Central
Kentucky Riding for the Handicapped, a barn at the Kentucky Horse
Park, nearly two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the first time she'd ever been around a horse, and she was
a little bit intimidated," Luciano said. "There was some fear in her
eyes."</TE>
<TE>   But once she got a chance to ride, Courtney found something she
truly loved. "Her confidence level shot way up, and she became more
independent almost overnight," Luciano said. "She's continued to grow
stronger both physically and emotionally the more we've come out
here."</TE>
<TE>   About two of every 1,000 births in the U.S. result in some type of
cerebral palsy. Studies have shown at least 5,000 infants and
toddlers and 1,200 to 1,500 preschoolers are diagnosed with cerebral
palsy each year. Spastic diplegia accounts for more than half of that
total.</TE>
<TE>   Courtney giddily waves to her mother several times as she goes
through her litany of tricks.</TE>
<TE>   She gets up on her hands and knees on the bareback pad, holding
onto the reins as volunteers walk on either side of her. Soon, she is
up on her knees as two volunteers, both with training in physical
therapy, steady her.</TE>
<TE>   Before long, she is riding sidesaddle, legs dangling over Chico's
left side for several passes from one end of the paddock to the
other. Then she switches to the right.</TE>
<TE>   She giggles as she plops back down on the pad -- backward this
time -- and tries to catch several balls tossed to her as she rides.</TE>
<TE>   "Got it," she squeals as she makes a catch. "Did you see?"</TE>
<TE>   Finally, it's time to trot. She turns to face front and tells
Chico confidently: "Trot on."</TE>
<TE>   Her laughter increases as Chico's gait quickens. Her plastic
helmet slides down over her eyes as her head and upper body bounce in
rhythm with the horse's stride. Several minutes later, Courtney seems
all laughed out and is ready to catch her breath. "Whoaaaaaaa, Chico.
Whoaaaaaaa."</TE>
<TE>   Her grin grows wider as she dismounts and is led toward Chico's
head, which is nearly as large as she is. She flashes her mother a
mischievous glance as she pats the docile equine on his nose.</TE>
<TE>   Janice Kuperstein, an associate professor of physical therapy at
the University of Kentucky's College of Health Sciences, has run this
program for four years as an elective in her physical therapy
curriculum. A similar program has been available at Central Kentucky
Riding for the Handicapped for more than two decades.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of these kids can't do a lot of things their peers can do,"
said Kuperstein, a New York native who moved to Kentucky's lush green
hills fnearly 18 years ago. "But they can ride a horse, and not all
of their peers, even the able-bodied ones, can say that.</TE>
<TE>   The program has two eight-week sessions in April and August. Many
volunteers are graduate students who choose to work as part of
Kuperstein's course.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last four years, about 180 children and adults have
entered the program. Many have been readmitted multiple times because
of continuing therapy needs. About 40 are on a waiting list.</TE>
<TE>   Kuperstein sees children with cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy,
Down syndrome, sensory integration impairment and myriad crippling
conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Riding not only strengthens muscles that may not be used often, it
improves motor skills and boosts confidence in social situations,
said Beth Ennis, assistant professor of physical therapy at
Bellarmine University, Louisville.</TE>
<TE>   "Most young people equate physical therapy with work, and who
wants to work?" Ennis said. "Put them in an alternative environment
in which they get to interact with horses, and it becomes play
instead...."</TE>
<TE>   Kuperstein says she has taken a special pleasure in watching
Courtney flourish. "You look at her with her rolling walker and then
you see her up on a horse and it's like she's transformed into this
totally different person," she said. "She seems to have this sense of
freedom and confidence when she's up there."</TE>
<TE>   Luciano watches Courtney nuzzle Chico and explains what riding
means to her daughter. "This is the one thing we've found that she
just loves with all her heart," she said. "... You can see on her
face how much it means to her. There's nothing more special or
important than that. Nothing."</TE>

<HD>Crabbers Claw for Survival</HD>
<DH>Ecology: Some contend that overfishing is not the cause of
the crustacean drop-off, which threatens the marsh itself.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALLEN G. BREED</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>DARIEN, Ga.</DL>
<LD>As Carl "Poppa" Poppell zooms his boat around the North River, shrimp
skip in his wake like water skiers and the wind flattens his cap
against his tanned forehead. "Going NASCAR," the crabber, 50, calls
it.</LD>
<LD>   Then something stops him cold. Tangled in the cordgrass off the
starboard side is a pink-and-white buoy with the initials "C.P."
marking one of his crab traps.</LD>
<LD>   "See that clean cut?" he said as he ran his calloused hand across
the shorn rope. "That's a knife or a machete or a hatchet.... Props
don't do that."</LD>
<TE>   Poppell has lost 60 crab pots to vandalism this summer, some of
the 600 cut during a turf war in the marshlands south of Savannah.
That's what competition and frustration have driven some of these
blue crab fishermen to.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, the crabbers have become like their prey, scratching
and clawing for survival in an ecosystem that is quickly becoming
less hospitable to them. Last year's Georgia blue crab catch was a
historically low 2.7 million pounds, less than a third of the 46-year
average, and it's worse elsewhere in the Southeast.</TE>
<TE>   Now, a young ecologist is saying that without the crabs, the
marshes themselves might die -- the very marshes that serve not only
as the crabs' nursery but as a breeding and feeding ground for
shrimp, drum, oysters and other commercially important species. In
some areas, the researcher suggests, overfishing of the crabs may be
a major culprit.</TE>
<TE>   No, no, no, Poppell says. Development, drought and other factors
upstream are starving the estuaries of fresh water, raising their
salinity, breeding disease. That's what got him where he is today, he
says -- not overfishing. But with things as they are, he worries that
he may be overfishing what's left without even meaning to.</TE>
<TE>   As he motors through the creeks, Poppell wonders whether he and
the crabs are racing toward the same bleak future.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of miles of Southern spartina, or cordgrass, marsh have
died in recent years from the Chesapeake Bay to the Gulf coasts of
Florida and Louisiana. Ecologist Brian Silliman says some are dying
at a snail's pace -- and that's what scares him.</TE>
<TE>   For the last half a century, a basic assumption of salt marsh
ecology was that the forces regulating spartina grass growth and
health were generally "bottom-up" -- nutrient levels, water salinity,
oxygen conditions. But Silliman surveyed several of those dead and
dying marshes and found very high densities of periwinkle snails.</TE>
<TE>   Blue crabs are one of the snail's most important predators, and
crab populations have been in rapid decline. In the Chesapeake,
researchers have documented an 81% decline in spawning stock since
1992.</TE>
<TE>   Silliman set out to see if the two phenomena were connected.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers have long known that the periwinkle feed off dead or
dying spartina. But the 29-year-old Brown University doctoral student
noticed something -- without blue crabs, the snails were going after
the healthy, live grass.</TE>
<TE>   Testing his theory on Georgia's Sapelo Island, Silliman found that
the inch-long snails graze the grass to cause scars that then become
infected by fungi. That's what the snails are really after, and
they're literally farming the grass to get it.</TE>
<TE>   Slogging through black mud that sucks the boots off their feet
with every step, Silliman and Mark Bertness, his professor, peppered
Sapelo with meter-square wire cages, excluding blue crabs from test
plots to see what the snails would do.</TE>
<TE>   The result: Within eight months, the snails had changed one of the
world's most productive grasslands into a barren mud flat.</TE>
<TE>   "They just mow it down," Silliman said, standing between two cages
-- one with tall, healthy green grass, the other a dead zone.</TE>
<TE>   What Silliman found were signs of a classic "trophic cascade," a
process in which the removal or compromise of one key species starts
a chain reaction that results in a total system collapse. Bertness
compares it to the destruction of California's kelp beds around the
beginning of the 20th century, when otter overharvesting led to
rampant sea urchin overgrazing.</TE>
<TE>   Rom Lipcius, a crab specialist at the Virginia Institute of Marine
Science, says Silliman's research is both fascinating and timely as
scientists and regulators grapple with man's influence on nature --
and his attempts to set things right.</TE>
<TE>   In the Chesapeake, for instance, much effort has been put into
restoring the oyster beds that are as synonymous with the bay as
lobster is to Maine. Now researchers are considering whether
increasing stocks of blue crabs, the oysters' main predator, will
preclude that restoration.</TE>
<TE>   Crabbers, in turn, are worried that the success of efforts to
restore the bay's striped bass fishery have cut into their business.
Lipcius has heard reports of bass being caught with 100 juvenile blue
crabs in their stomachs.</TE>
<TE>   "You sort of get into all these vicious cycles," he said. "We
might not be able to fix it because we've changed so many other parts
of the system as well that it's just not able to adjust."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Overharvesting of blue crabs may be triggering the colossal
die-off of salt marshes across the southeastern United States."</TE>
<TE>   That was the headline on a Brown University release about
Silliman's work.</TE>
<TE>   For Poppell, it was like a red flag to a cornered bull. He wanted
to meet this Silliman guy. Probably another one of those eggheads who
sits behind a desk all day trying to find ways to hurt working folk.</TE>
<TE>   "We've lived this thing," Poppell said as he pointed his boat
toward Sapelo. "We may not have all the scientific data to back it
up, but we've lived it."</TE>
<TE>   Silliman meets the boat at the ferry dock. His white boots and
green Army pants are splattered with marsh mud. At least he's not
afraid to go out and get dirty for his information, Poppell figures.</TE>
<TE>   The young ecologist assures Poppell that, headlines aside, his
study was only meant to flash a "yellow light of caution" to crabbers
and those who regulate them. Poppell has already seen the light.</TE>
<TE>   When things started going south, he and other Georgia crabbers
went to state officials and offered to limit themselves. They went
from unlimited licenses and unlimited pots to 159 crab permits, each
allowing its holder 200 traps -- and not all have been taken.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Haymans, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources' liaison
to crabbers, agrees with Poppell that disease, drought and other
factors, not overfishing, are likely the problem here. But to
Silliman, the result is the same -- no crabs could mean no marsh.</TE>
<TE>   Silliman is testing his theories in other places. He recently set
up cages in the bayous south of Baton Rouge, where up to 35 miles of
marsh are being lost each year in an ecosystem that supports up to
25% of the nation's coastal fisheries.</TE>
<TE>   Silliman knows that snails are probably not causing the die-offs
there. But they are probably contributing to and benefiting from
them.</TE>
<TE>   What he does know is that the crabs and marshes are linked in ways
that no one knew before. And so are the crabbers, shrimpers and
others who depend on these resources.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Back on the North River, Poppell speeds from float to float,
pulling traps to the surface and dumping them. Trap after empty trap
comes up caked with growth, its bait well still full of rotting
mullet.</TE>
<TE>   For most of the morning, he lands more flounder, spadefish, hermit
crabs and puffer fish than he does blues. This stretch of water was
his "honey hole" for 25 years, averaging up to 1,500 pounds a day in
this part of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't even make a living out of it now," he said ruefully.</TE>
<TE>   Next, Poppell heads into another river that was recently abandoned
by a fellow crabber who moved on to greener pastures. Because of the
competition, he doesn't want it named or even described.</TE>
<TE>   There, he hauls in traps with 10, 15, 20 crabs apiece -- better,
but still a third of what they should be, or worse.</TE>
<TE>   Close to quitting time, another boat rounds a horseshoe bend in
the marsh and pulls alongside Poppell's. It's Carl Jr.</TE>
<TE>   "I might have a box," the 25-year-old son said over the idling
motors. "This time of year, we should be catching eight, 10 boxes
apiece, easy.... After I take out my bait, my gas, I might make 30
bucks. This is a very poor day. Very poor."</TE>
<TE>   Together, father and son have landed about two boxes of crabs.</TE>
<TE>   As he heads in for the day, Poppell is feeling as endangered as
the wood stork gliding overhead. But in the bow of his boat is one
small consolation -- tangled in a float line was one of his severed
pots.</TE>
<TE>   Call it a $25 payback.</TE>
<TE>   "That was my catch of the day," he said with a wry smile.</TE>
<TE>   And there was another bonus. Inside was a single blue crab.</TE>

<HD>Mountains Don't Intimidate Today's Road Builders</HD>

<AU>ROGER ALFORD</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>PIKEVILLE, Ky.</DL>
<LD>When road crews first built U.S. 119 through eastern Kentucky, they
treated Pine Mountain like the neighborhood bully, treading gingerly
around the steep slopes.</LD>
<LD>   No more Mr. Nice Guy.</LD>
<LD>   The next road will go straight through the heart of the mountain,
creating one of the longest vehicle tunnels in the United States.</LD>
<TE>   The Appalachian Regional Commission, charged by Congress to build
roads to open the mountain region to economic progress, is also
taking on several other mountains that have stood defiantly in the
way.</TE>
<TE>   The commission plans to spend $6.8 billion over 20 years to build
500 miles of modern roads into the most isolated areas of Appalachia.
Thirteen states will contribute an additional $2 billion to the
effort.</TE>
<TE>   "You're facing mountain ridges everywhere you look," said Kevin
Damron, a highway planner for the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet.
"It's very rugged terrain."</TE>
<TE>   With crews pushing through six mountains to build U.S. 119 in
eastern Pike County, Damron said the cost has reached $20 million a
mile.</TE>
<TE>   The cost is even higher -- $30 million a mile -- on an 18-mile
stretch of U.S. 460 near Elkhorn City, near the Virginia border,
because of the additional expense of cutting into mountaintop and
bridging hollows.</TE>
<TE>   Jesse L. White Jr., co-chairman of the commission, said the roads
that were promised to the people of Appalachia must be completed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a partial promise," he said. "It's essential that the
entire system be completed, and I am confident it will be."</TE>
<TE>   Still, local officials who have waited and watched as roads were
built in other parts of the region worry that projects like the Pine
Mountain tunnel construction might somehow be derailed.</TE>
<TE>   Letcher County Judge-Executive Carroll Smith said people who have
never traveled the narrow lanes and hairpin curves of Pine Mountain
can't know the importance of building the remaining stretches of
highway.</TE>
<TE>   White said the 500 miles of road yet to be built will cost nearly
as much as the 2,525 miles of highway already constructed in the
mountains. Finishing the final portion of the work authorized by
Congress in 1965 is critically important, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Every new mile opened translates into lives saved," White said.
"It means new opportunities for business development and in creating
new jobs. It's important because anything short of the completed
system will block the region from participating fully in the national
economy and in our national prosperity."</TE>
<TE>   Pine Mountain is such a challenge that highway planners
recommended going through, instead of over, the steep slopes. The
commission has agreed to help fund a $188-million tunnel that Damron
said will be about 1.8 miles long.</TE>
<TE>   Damron's twin brother, state highway planner Keith Damron, said it
will be one of the three longest vehicle tunnels in the U.S., and the
longest two-lane tunnel in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   He said the tunnel is badly needed to replace the current road
across the 3,272-foot mountain in eastern Kentucky. The 7-mile coil
of two-lane blacktop has curves so sharp, the suggested speed limit
falls to 15 mph in places. Large trucks are banned from the road.</TE>
<TE>   Crews are working on the new U.S. 119 between Pikeville and
Belfry, blasting cuts through mountaintops and erecting gargantuan
pillars to support bridges over hollows to speed traffic between
Pikeville and Charleston, W.Va.</TE>
<TE>   Over 37 years, the commission has spent about $5.5 billion on
roads through the mountains of Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland,
Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, South
Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia. Individual states
have contributed about $1.3 billion.</TE>

<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>WEWOKA, Okla.</DL>
<LD>Wilburt Cudjoe holds a piece of his identity in a black, wrinkled
hand.</LD>
<LD>   The white plastic card says he is a member of the Seminole Nation
of Oklahoma. It also says he is the descendant of African slaves,
people who escaped plantations in the 1700s to join the Seminoles.</LD>
<LD>   The card does not say that Cudjoe, 78, is an Indian by blood. And
that turns his soft, warm eyes sad.</LD>
<TE>   Tribal leaders say Cudjoe and 1,500 other black Seminoles who
cannot trace at least one-fourth of their ancestry to native people
may not sit on the tribal council. And those without at least
one-eighth native blood, they say, cannot vote in tribal elections or
share in $42 million Congress allotted in the 1990s as compensation
for running the Seminoles out of Florida more than 100 years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute, now tied up in federal courts, is ripping the
Seminole Nation apart, threatening to break a bond that spans four
centuries. It's a battle of race, money and the right of a sovereign
nation to decide who is an Indian.</TE>
<TE>   "We were just like brothers and sisters until this little money
come up," said Cudjoe, a small, soft-spoken man. "They are forgetting
their history. Their past is entwined with the blacks."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To understand what is happening to the Seminoles, it is necessary
to know something of their unusual history.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike other tribes, they were not a distinct people before the
white man arrived on North America. Their origins lie in small bands
of refugees -- members of the Creeks and about five other tribes who
escaped white invaders by fleeing into the empty swamps of Florida in
the mid-1700s. Soon, escaped slaves from plantations in South
Carolina and Georgia joined them for the chance to live free.</TE>
<TE>   Together, they struggled to survive in the Florida swamps, built
communities, fought U.S. soldiers and evolved into a distinct people.</TE>
<TE>   Intermarriage and time have blurred the lineage of many Indian
tribes. Black blood flows strong through the Narragansetts in Rhode
Island, Lumbees of North Carolina, northeastern Pequots of
Connecticut. And as bingo halls and casinos enrich some once-poor
tribes, there have been frequent disputes over who has enough native
blood to qualify as an Indian.</TE>
<TE>   What makes the Seminoles different is that blacks -- estelusti, in
the Seminole language of Muscogee -- were part of the tribe from the
beginning, owning land, serving as interpreters and negotiators with
the whites, teaching the others how to grow rice.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an Afro-Indian tribe, a multiethnic reliance," said
anthropologist Joseph Opala of James Madison University in Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   Even their name says so. Seminole is a corruption of the Spanish
word "cimarron," meaning "runaway," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Florida, the Seminoles still could not completely evade the
U.S. Army, which was intent on forcing tribes throughout the South to
move west of the Mississippi in the 1820s and 1830s to make room for
white settlers. Hundreds of Seminoles agreed to leave and were taken
west by boat across the Gulf of Mexico, then on barges up the
Mississippi and Arkansas rivers to Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   Some bands battled on deep in the swamps. Today, their ancestors
make up the Seminole Tribe of Florida -- which never signed a peace
treaty with the government.</TE>
<TE>   But for the Seminoles who moved to the golden prairies of
Oklahoma, life changed quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Black Seminoles found that their knowledge of rice cultivation and
their resistance to swamp diseases no longer had value. Worse, the
federal government initially put the Seminoles under the control of
the Creeks, another transplanted tribe. The Creeks held blacks as
slaves, Opala said. And by the mid-1850s, the Seminoles followed
their example.</TE>
<TE>   During the Civil War, several tribes, including the Seminoles,
sided with the Confederacy. In 1866, the federal government imposed a
new treaty on the Seminoles, reducing their land holdings in Oklahoma
and restoring blacks to equal status in the tribe.</TE>
<TE>   Relations between black and blood Seminoles were strained during
the long era of segregation when, even in Indian territory, blacks
went to separate schools.</TE>
<TE>   But for the last 40 years, the Seminoles have lived together
mainly in harmony -- until the federal money came.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wayne Shaw, chairman of the Seminole general council, takes a lazy
drag off his cigarette and shakes his head. "There's no such thing as
a black Seminole," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Since the $42 million arrived, the opinion has been heard often in
Seminole County, scrubland where many of the 15,000 blood and black
Seminoles live side by side in houses and shacks, the black Seminoles
outnumbered 9-to-1.</TE>
<TE>   From the start, the tribal council decided that only blood
Seminoles were entitled to a share of the money, which it doles out
in small amounts to tribal members who apply for help with such
expenses as home repairs and school tuition.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the council formalized the distinction between
black and blood, changing the tribe's constitution to double the
blood requirement for tribal council representation to one-fourth
Indian ancestry. Generally, federal law gives Indian tribes the right
to decide who is a member and who is not. However, every tribe's
freedom of action is limited by its treaties with the United States
and its own constitution, which can't be changed without federal
approval.</TE>
<TE>   The treaty of 1866 made black Seminoles full members, and the
federal government has refused to ratify the constitutional
amendments that effectively banished black Seminoles from the tribe.</TE>
<TE>   The Seminole Nation sued and held a new election for tribal
positions, with only blood Seminoles allowed to vote. Ken Chambers, a
half-blood Seminole whose followers wear T-shirts that say, "Seminole
by Blood," was elected chief.</TE>
<TE>   The Bureau of Indian Affairs recognizes the former chief and is
withholding the compensation money from the tribe. Federal officials
declined comment on the situation, citing the pending litigation.</TE>
<TE>   Chambers insists that when the blacks fled to Florida to escape
their white masters, the Seminoles took them in, but that the two
cultures never truly mixed.</TE>
<TE>   Black Seminoles don't speak Muscogee, he says. They don't know how
to cook blue bread or grape dumplings or sofkey, a corn dish similar
to hominy. They don't join the blood Indians as they welcome another
harvest by stomp dancing and singing into the night.</TE>
<TE>   Blacks never had equal rights within the tribe, Chambers contends,
and aren't entitled to them now.</TE>
<TE>   In Indian country -- a smattering of meeting grounds and gambling
halls about 60 miles east of Oklahoma City -- blood Indians say money
isn't really the issue. Rather, it's preserving their heritage and
their right as a sovereign nation to decide who is a member and who
is not.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to keep the bloodlines going, you got to keep 'em
separate," said Jerry Harjo, who serves up fry bread and bean soup
for the tribal lunch program. "The way we're heading now, the Indian
tribe will probably not even exist."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis Johnson, assistant curator of the Seminole Nation Museum,
said the tribe is not trying to rewrite history. It's just that the
common fight for freedom that brought blacks and native people
together 200 years ago doesn't apply anymore, he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   .</TE>
<TE>   Cudjoe, the 78-year-old black Seminole, believes that his
great-great-grandfather came on a slave ship from the west coast of
Africa. He was sold to a rice plantation, then escaped to Florida and
joined the Seminoles in the late 1700s.</TE>
<TE>   Two of Cudjoe's brothers, twins who sat on the tribal council
before their deaths, once traveled from Oklahoma to Sierra Leone,
where they were honored by the president as stolen members of the
Gullah tribe.</TE>
<TE>   He smiles as he looks at a yellowed photograph of his grandfather,
Witty, who is said to have lived to 116 on the Seminole County
grassland that the government gave him.</TE>
<TE>   His ancestor may have been black, but he was very much a Seminole,
Cudjoe says. He spoke Muscogee. He ate fry bread and Indian corn. He
passed on the creed of the black Seminoles to his grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Wilburt Cudjoe still owns 72 acres of the Oklahoma land where his
ancestors farmed cotton and peanuts. He takes his great-grandchildren
fishing there in a pond. He tells them: Never sell the land. Never
forget the past.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm of the Seminole tribe," Cudjoe said. "I don't care what
nobody says."</TE>

<AU>WILLIAM KATES</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>ITHACA, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>For 12 seconds on a blustery December morning in 1903, Wilbur and
Orville Wright kept their hand-built flying machine aloft on the wind
over the North Carolina coast, a seminal event that opened the age of
air travel and changed the world.</LD>
<LD>   Ann Druyan imagines how the pioneering brothers felt -- their
determination, the sense of daring and, eventually, the unparalleled
feeling of accomplishment.</LD>
<LD>   She hopes to have a similar experience as part of an unprecedented
international project -- known as Cosmos I -- to launch the first
solar sail-powered vehicle in space. Some scientists believe that the
technology is humankind's best chance at making interstellar travel a
reality.</LD>
<TE>   "If we succeed, to me, that is an equivalent step of what happened
at Kitty Hawk," said Druyan, widow of visionary astronomer Carl
Sagan. She is chief executive officer of Ithaca-based Cosmos Studios,
the project's principal backer.</TE>
<TE>   Her efforts have suffered setbacks along the way, including the
failure of a prototype last summer. But science is all about trial
and error, she and her collaborators say.</TE>
<TE>   Louis Friedman, director of the project, said the Wright brothers
"spent 12 seconds in the air and went nowhere, but they proved
powered flight was possible."</TE>
<TE>   "We want to prove that solar sailing is possible with this
project," said Friedman, executive director of the Planetary Society,
co-founded in 1980 by Sagan, Friedman and Bruce Murray to advance
solar-system exploration and the search for extraterrestrial life.</TE>
<TE>   Space sailing uses reflected light pressure, said Friedman, who
headed solar sailing research for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   When sunlight hits the surface of the sail, the energy of photons,
or light particles, is transferred to the sail. As the light is
reflected away, it gives the sail a slight push.</TE>
<TE>   Existing chemical fuels have limitations. NASA's fastest vehicles
were Voyager I and II, which traveled about 38,000 mph. With solar
sailing, the thrust is continuous and, although it starts slowly, the
craft keeps increasing speed.</TE>
<TE>   Friedman said theoretically a solar-sail craft could reach
one-tenth the speed of light -- about 64 million mph -- by the time
it reached Pluto, meaning a trip out of the solar system would take
months instead of years. "There aren't any other technologies we know
of presently that will allow us to conquer interstellar distances in
the same way," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In theory, anyway.</TE>
<TE>   German astronomer and mathematician Johann Kepler in the early
1600s first observed that comet tails pointed away from the sun and
theorized that there was a force emanating from the sun comparable to
terrestrial winds.</TE>
<TE>   Jules Verne dreamed in the late 19th century of great sailing
ships that would ride the light. Scientists in the 1920s first
realized that it was theoretically possible to use photons from the
sun as a propulsion mechanism.</TE>
<TE>   "There are important missions that are well-suited for solar
sailing ... maybe not in this decade but not too far in the future,"
said Chuck Gay, program executive of NASA's New Millennium programs,
which seek to validate new flight technologies.</TE>
<TE>   He said there is "significant interest" in solar sailing at the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, calling the Cosmos I
project "noble and inspiring."</TE>
<TE>   But the space agency is working on the technology rather than a
flight mission. NASA's work includes such efforts as designing new
sail membranes so a craft could carry larger payloads without
requiring enormous sails.</TE>
<TE>   This year, NASA is spending about $20 million on new propulsion
technologies, of which solar sailing gets a share. For 2003, the
budget is being increased to $60 million. How much goes to solar
sailing depends in part on the success of developments, Gay said.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Zubrin of Pioneer Astronautics, a Lakewood, Colo.-based
research and development company, is co-inventor of the magnetic
sail, another promising non-chemical propulsion technology. He said a
demonstration of solar sailing technology is "long overdue."</TE>
<TE>   He praised the Cosmos I project for getting technology "out of the
box, out of the realm of discussion and graphs."</TE>
<TE>   "This has been a dream of scientists for 100 years and they are
making it reality," he said. "What they are doing is really the most
critical step."</TE>
<TE>   The 220-pound Cosmos I was built by the Babakin Space Center in
Russia and is expected to be launched this fall -- an exact launch
date has not yet been set -- from a Russian nuclear submarine in the
Barents Sea. It will be carried into space on a converted Soviet
missile.</TE>
<TE>   "Here was a way to turn one of the most awesome and terrible
swords in any arsenal into a way of moving through the universe. For
me, it was a way to demonstrate that I have learned what Carl Sagan
was trying to teach," Druyan said.</TE>
<TE>   Druyan and Friedman are determined to see the project through to a
successful completion despite such setbacks as last summer's failure
of a prototype to separate from the booster.</TE>
<TE>   A successful project would represent a confluence of all Sagan
held dear: a more peaceful world, a greater exploration of the cosmos
and a clean energy technology as elegant as a sailing ship, Druyan
said.</TE>
<TE>   Another element of the project that thrills her is that Cosmos I
will be visible with the naked eye the world over, even during the
day.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be as bright as the moon, although not as large. It will
be like a new star in the sky. To me, it's a star of hope," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Two-thirds of the project's $4-million cost was paid by Druyan's
Cosmos Studios, a 2-year-old science-based media and entertainment
venture that has reissued Sagan's landmark television series on DVD
and home video. Cosmos Studios also supports original scientific
research and funded the expedition that led to the discovery in the
Sahara of the second largest dinosaur ever found, the 60-ton
Paralititan stromeri.</TE>
<TE>   The remainder of the funding came from A&amp;E Television, which has a
deal with Cosmos Studios for 12 two-hour science documentaries,
including one on the solar-sailing project, and from Progressive
Insurance chairman Peter Lewis, who says he is fascinated by space
and intrigued by anything tried for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   The project's ability to succeed on such a small budget has been a
target for skeptics.</TE>
<TE>   It's a point of pride for Druyan and Friedman, validating, they
say, what the Wright brothers proved in their bicycle workshop: that
discovery and scientific enterprise are not the venues of
big-budgeted governments, but of anyone with daring and imagination.</TE>

<HD>Maryland Residents Staging Road Show to Slow Drivers</HD>
<DH>Traffic: Communities use a variety of tactics, including
sculptures and pedestrian flags, to deal with speeding motorists.
It's unclear how effective the displays are.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID DISHNEAU</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>HYATTSTOWN, Md.</DL>
<LD>The sculpture is as close to an official traffic stopper as the law
allows: A stick figure with an upraised, white-gloved hand, it is one
of 19 artworks that Hyattstown residents have placed along a road in
hopes of slowing the cars speeding past their front doors.</LD>
<LD>   "If you see one, then all of a sudden, you start looking and,
hopefully, your initial reaction is to slow down," said Linda Tetens,
an artist who helped organize the project.</LD>
<LD>   The Road Show, as residents call it, is among the many approaches
that people nationwide have devised for dealing with traffic problems
that authorities won't or can't solve.</LD>
<TE>   Others involve brightly colored flags, "pace cars," homemade speed
bumps, even a steel gate.</TE>
<TE>   Tiny Hyattstown, about 25 miles northwest of Washington, isn't
even a wide spot in the road. That is one of the problems its 65
residents face in trying to slow drivers who ignore the 30 mph limit
on Route 355, a state highway popular with commuters avoiding
congested Interstate 270.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the community's 200-year-old houses are right beside the
road, leaving little margin for parking -- which tends to slow
passing cars -- or other "traffic-calming" features such as
roundabouts and lane closings.</TE>
<TE>   Tetens, who created some of the sculptures, said she and a
neighbor once borrowed a police radar gun and found the average speed
was at least 45 mph.</TE>
<TE>   In the three years that Tetens has lived in Hyattstown, one
neighbor's car was hit by a motorcycle and another was rear-ended
while slowing to make a turn.</TE>
<TE>   In another accident, a driver who had stopped so that Tetens could
pull out of her driveway was struck from behind.</TE>
<TE>   The sculptures along the one-third-mile stretch include an
enormous set of wind chimes hanging from a sturdy maple branch and
six brightly colored pinwheels.</TE>
<TE>   The display began in July and has been changed periodically.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been fun, artwise, and it's been fun to see that it worked,"
Tetens said.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it really does work is unclear.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Donovan, another organizer of the project, said there have
been at least three accidents along the strip in the past month.</TE>
<TE>   He said community leaders are seeking help from state officials in
installing sidewalks and establishing other visual cues that this is
a residential area.</TE>
<TE>   Hyattstown does not have its own police force. State police have
helped nab tractor-trailers that illegally take the road to avoid a
truck scale on I-270, but Montgomery County police say Hyattstown is
just one small problem competing for officers' attention.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents of Madison, Wis., tried numerous tactics to make
drivers yield to pedestrians after authorities refused to place
additional stoplights along a commercial block of Monroe Street.</TE>
<TE>   "We have done yard signs, Burma Shave signs, we have done speed
boards, we have marked down who didn't slow down and the police sent
them warning letters. Most of these things had some effect, but
mostly it was temporary," said Ann Clark of the Dudgeon-Monroe
Neighborhood Assn.</TE>
<TE>   They found greater success with pedestrian flags, a strategy also
in use elsewhere, including Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Before stepping into the intersection, pedestrians can grab a
tall, bright orange flag from a curbside canister. They wave it while
crossing the street, then deposit it in a container on the other
side.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been wonderfully effective," Clark said.</TE>
<TE>   She said no pedestrians have been struck by cars on the block
since the project began in May, compared with two such accidents the
previous 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   Home-grown strategies in other communities have included:</TE>
<TE>   * Pace cars in Mesa, Ariz., where residents who pledge to obey the
speed limit can display "Official Neighborhood Pace Car" stickers on
their vehicles to remind others to slow down.</TE>
<TE>   * Speed bumps in Rodgers Forge, Md., where Andrew McBee used them
to slow traffic in an alley behind his house for three years until he
was ordered to remove them last summer. He molded each of the speed
bumps out of six to eight bags of asphalt from Home Depot.</TE>
<TE>   * An iron gate across a road that residents of Mukilteo, Wash.,
installed with city approval two years ago to prevent cars from
speeding through their neighborhood at 60 mph. The gate was later
removed by court order.</TE>
<TE>   Stephanie Faul, a spokeswoman for the Washington-based AAA
Foundation for Traffic Safety, said people who are tempted to take
matters into their own hands should look into traffic-calming
solutions such as cobblestone paving, lane obstructions and gentle,
S-shaped curves.</TE>
<TE>   "When people think of traffic-calming, they usually think of speed
humps, and people hate speed humps," she said. "There are things you
can do, however."</TE>

<HD>Latest Aid on Trail: E-Mail</HD>
<DH>Technology: Hikers on long treks can get help from
libraries or 'trail angels,' who provide access to a variety of
information.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GLENN ADAMS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>PATTEN, Maine</DL>
<LD>Mother Goose meets Twisted Sister II: It's not a summer movie hit,
and it's not the latest Stephen King spine-tingler. It actually
happened, along a road in northern Maine.</LD>
<LD>   Veteran hiker Bonita Helton, known by the trail name Mother Goose,
and Ellen Wilcox, aka Twisted Sister II, greeted each other and
embraced like long-lost friends when their paths met for the first
time.</LD>
<LD>   The rendezvous between Helton, 54, a waitress from Woodbine, Ky.,
and Wilcox, 42, a teacher from Bedford, Nova Scotia, speaks to the
latest craze to hit the trails crisscrossing the continent.</LD>
<TE>   Along with tents, sleeping bags and cooking gear, hikers are
stowing hand-held computers. For those without Palm Pilots or similar
devices, there are always desktop computers in the libraries or in
the homes of people called "trail angels" who help hikers along the
way.</TE>
<TE>   E-mail is the latest signpost to help hikers find a place to do
laundry, get shelter, food, water or other kind of assistance, said
Bill Miller, a trail angel whose home in New Brunswick, Canada, is
frequented by hikers.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody checks their e-mail when they get to the library," said
Helton, who packs a Pocket Mail Composer so that she can add entries
into her journal every night and keep in touch with fellow trekkers
all over the country.</TE>
<TE>   Wilcox e-mailed Helton and a dozen or so other hikers before she
began her southbound trek from Quebec's Cape Gaspe in June. With
e-mail, she could monitor their progress, keep them updated on what
to expect, and give tips on where to eat and drink.</TE>
<TE>   They had never met face-to-face before Aug. 5 on the International
Appalachian Trail, which picks up where the 2,168-mile Appalachian
Trail ends. The 663-mile IAT extends from northern Maine's Baxter
State Park to spectacular Cape Gaspe.</TE>
<TE>   Wilcox, who teaches business and computers at a community college,
yearned for a break from the keyboard and decided not to pack a
hand-held herself. But she couldn't break away completely and uses a
library computer once a week or so.</TE>
<TE>   "I said right from the get-go, this would be electronic-free,"
Wilcox said as she sat in a trailside diner for a lunch break. "My
mother would have loved it if I had one so I could write every day.
She worries about me."</TE>
<TE>   As Wilcox spoke, Helton composed and sent an e-mail from the
remote Maine woods to a hiker she knows in Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   Helton, who had just completed the Appalachian Trail for the fifth
time and was on her way toward the Gaspe, guessed that 10% of the
hikers carry wireless e-mail devices such as hers. Wilcox thinks that
it's closer to 50%.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows for sure because it's still new.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely a very recent phenomenon," said Laurie Potteiger
of the Appalachian Trail Conference in Harpers Ferry, W.Va., which
manages the Georgia-to-Maine Appalachian Trail. "It's only been the
last two or three years since people routinely ask, 'Where can I
check on my e-mail?' "</TE>
<TE>   Many hikers check e-mail from their cell phones, and global
positioning is an option for hikers with Palm Pilots, said Steve
Jones, a professor of communications at the University of Chicago at
Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   Cell phones have improved to the point where batteries can last a
couple of weeks if the unit is not turned on, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Charles Golvin, a senior analyst at Forrester Research,
cautioned that hikers should not substitute a cell phone or personal
digital assistant for proper planning before heading into the woods.
Cellular companies have invested heavily in their networks, but many
sparsely populated areas still don't have coverage.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a mistake for a thru-hiker to simply grab his
connected PDA and assume he'll be able to arrange the next food drop
whenever the mood strikes," he said from his San Francisco office.</TE>
<TE>   Some hikers, like Suzanne Allen, who is hiking the 1,150-mile
Pacific Northwest Trail from the Continental Divide to the Pacific
Ocean, keeps in touch through her Web site, called Suz' Adventures.</TE>
<TE>   On the IAT, one of the continent's only long-distance
international trails and one of the newest, hikers use e-mail to keep
in touch with the trail's president and founder, Dick Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   "Hikers are outspoken about trail conditions," he said. Through
e-mail, Anderson has gotten word of blow downs and beaver dams that
block or flood the trail.</TE>

<HD>Cars May Take Backseat to Shuttles at Yellowstone</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BECKY BOHRER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>BILLINGS, Mont.</DL>
<LD>Yellowstone National Park is preparing to test the public's appetite
for mass transit, hoping that visitors will consider giving up their
minivans and road-clogging recreation vehicles for commuter buses.</LD>
<LD>   "This park is just being loved to death," said Jim Evanoff, a
management assistant at Yellowstone. "We're starting to send the
signal that private cars are not necessarily going to be the future
at Yellowstone."</LD>
<LD>   The mass transit idea, still in its infancy, is part of a program
intended to reduce air and noise pollution and improve the overall
environment within the country's first national park.</LD>
<TE>   Yellowstone recently purchased a small fleet of the famous old
yellow tour buses that were phased out of service in the park in the
1950s. Once a chief source of visitor transportation, the buses will
be refurbished and are expected to return to service in a few years,
Evanoff said.</TE>
<TE>   The buses likely would be used at first for shuttle service
between some of the park's more popular sites, which are often
clogged with vehicles and slowed by traffic jams.</TE>
<TE>   Evanoff and others, however, hope that the buses will be just one
component of a greater transportation system that will dramatically
cut the number of private vehicles touring the park.</TE>
<TE>   "I envision mass transportation, such as bus companies, bringing
people to entrance gates and people hopping onto some sort of
transportation system ... where you have control of the visitor and
minimal disturbance of wildlife," Evanoff said.</TE>
<TE>   In many national parks, mass transit is an accepted means of
travel for visitors. It is also becoming an option for park managers
seeking solutions to traffic jams and ways to handle a growing number
of visitors.</TE>
<TE>   Some environmentalists praise the option as progressive and plain
smart planning.</TE>
<TE>   "We're adding several million people to our country's population
each year and we're not making any more Yellowstones," said Jon
Catton, a spokesman for the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, a Bozeman,
Mont., conservation group. "It follows that we're going to need new
ways for people to access and enjoy the national parks that belong to
them without overwhelming the very qualities that make the park
special."</TE>
<TE>   Fun and nostalgia became key selling points this summer to
increase bus tours in Glacier National Park in northwestern Montana.
The park brought back some of its red 1930s touring buses that were
taken off the road in 1999 for safety reasons. Refurbished and
updated from the wheels up, the buses drew near-capacity loads and
were credited for a 20% increase in the number of guided van tours in
the park, said Rich Bond, transportation manager with Glacier Park
Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The buses, with convertible tops, use cleaner-burning propane and
reduce park traffic, Bond said.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the real problems parks have had is attracting people to
get on tour vehicles because there is nothing unique about them," he
said. "Your guides could be as good as gold, but people want
something different."</TE>
<TE>   The point is not lost on Yellowstone. It is a reason that
officials are interested in the old tour buses for shuttles.</TE>
<TE>   "Our concept would be to provide a kind of vehicle and experience
that would entice people out of their vehicles to see the park in a
different way," said John Sacklin, the park's chief of planning.</TE>
<TE>   About 3 million people visit Yellowstone each year. If visitation
increases, so does the number of private vehicles, leading to more
congestion along popular routes.</TE>
<TE>   Having even just a portion of visitors use shuttles instead of
private vehicles could make a difference, Sacklin said.</TE>
<TE>   At Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado, officials first began
offering shuttle service in 1978 to reduce congestion, parking
problems and damage to park resources, Chief Ranger Joe Evans said.</TE>
<TE>   Roughly 60 people can fit on today's buses, which are
handicap-accessible, air-conditioned and equipped with big windows.
Routes join at a central parking area, he said, and about 264,000
people used the free service last year.</TE>
<TE>   Sacklin said he didn't know when shuttle buses would begin running
in Yellowstone or how widespread the program might be.</TE>
<TE>   "Looking at alternative modes of transportation in Yellowstone is
really a very complex, long-term kind of question," he said. However,
"it behooves us now to explore possible solutions before the issue is
really upon us in a big way."</TE>

<DH>SUMMERLAND: A Novel, By Michael Chabon, Miramax
Books/Hyperion: 500 pp., $22.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ADAM BRESNICK</AU>
<BD>Adam Bresnick writes for several publications,
including the (London) Times Literary Supplement.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Besides proving conclusively that there are countless pots of gold to
be collected at the end of the children's books rainbow, J.K.
Rowling's Harry Potter series showed once again that writing for the
younger set has a distinct advantage: Kids are in many ways a better
literary audience than adults. For most grown-ups, literature merely
affords a momentary respite from the rigors of the world, whereas
children positively revel in the plasticity of the imagination as
they plunge into the fantasy worlds of fiction.</LD>
<LD>   If, as Edgar Allan Poe claimed, the imaginative writer seeks to
produce a riveting effect that will transport the reader from the
armchair to the transcendent realm of the imagination, what better
way to accomplish this minor miracle than to write novels for
children, who are always in the business of self-transformation?
These days, a serious contemporary novelist's choice to write
so-called young adult fiction must be understood to be the very
opposite of slumming.</LD>
<TE>   Given these advantages, it should come as no surprise that Michael
Chabon, fresh from the triumph of his Pulitzer Prize-winning "The
Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay," should jump into the kid-lit
fray. "Summerland" has many essential aspects of ambitious
post-Rowling children's literature: a super-nerd protagonist who is
called upon to do great things in a hitherto unknown world; a couple
of indispensable sidekicks who aid and abet the hesitant protagonist
as he makes his way toward the climactic showdown that will furnish
the novel's conclusion; a Manichaean struggle between good and evil
that results in the nerd hero's facing down the lord of badness, here
called Coyote; and a motley assortment of magical creatures, among
them ferishers, sasquatches, shadowtails, skrikers, werefoxes and
graylings.</TE>
<TE>   Whereas Rowling presents a wry satire of British boarding school
culture, Chabon sets his novel on the distinctly American terrain of
the baseball diamond, the proverbial field of dreams of the U.S.,
incorporating Native American folklore as well as aspects of
Scandinavian mythology in what ought to be a whiz-bang home-grown
entertainment for both the kid set and geezers given to youthful
fancy.</TE>
<TE>   Ethan Feld is an insecure youth who has moved with his father from
Colorado Springs to the Pacific Northwest after the death of his
mother. An amateur inventor, Bruce Feld has developed a picofiber
zeppelina, a kind of mini-dirigible that he hopes one day to market
as an airborne alternative to the family car.</TE>
<TE>   As a member of the hapless Ruth's Fluff 'n' Fold Roosters of the
Clam Island Little League, Ethan is regularly humiliated by his lack
of baseball prowess, though he admires the grace and power exhibited
by Jennifer T. Rideout, the hot jockette pitcher who is by far the
best player on his team. His good friend Thor Wignutt is a kind of
Spock figure here, a computer nerd who exhibits android features as
well as extraordinary mathematical abilities.</TE>
<TE>   One morning Ethan awakens from an uneasy slumber to find a magical
werefox named Cutbelly propped up on his chest. Cutbelly is a
Shadowtail, a creature able to jump from world to world and so to
knit together apparently disparate realms. As Cutbelly explains to
the mystified Ethan, the universe is a kind of enormous Tree that
contains four separate worlds, and just as the branches of a tree
overlap at certain points, so do the worlds of the universal Tree,
producing the galls that allow a Shadowtail to scamper from world to
world.</TE>
<TE>   Cutbelly warns Ethan that the Tree is in grave danger, as the
villainous Coyote has been pruning back the galls and so eliminating
the connections between worlds as he prepares to poison the Tree at
its roots.</TE>
<TE>   To accomplish this awful deed, Coyote has kidnapped and
brainwashed Ethan's father, as the inventor's revolutionary
picofibers are necessary to the evil one's nefarious plans to poison
Murmury Well, which waters the Tree at its roots. Playing on the
Scandinavian myth of Ragnarok, or the end of the world, Chabon calls
the demise of the Tree Ragged Rock, a doomsday that appears to be
imminent, and so has the magical creatures of Summerland scurrying
about in dread.</TE>
<TE>   It is up to Ethan and his cronies Jennifer T. and Thor to scamper
from the Middling into the Winterland and then to the Summerland,
where they will meet a panoply of fantasy characters and play various
baseball games in an attempt to rescue Dad and waylay Coyote as he
pursues his perfidious plans to annihilate the universe. By the end,
Ethan will have saved the day and, perhaps more important, he will
have developed into a pretty solid catcher.</TE>
<TE>   This is heady stuff, no doubt, and given Chabon's writerly verve,
it would seem to be perfect fodder for a classic American children's
book. Yet, in the end, "Summerland" suffers from a surfeit of
cleverness and from Chabon's very virtuosity as a writer. Too many
times the novel appears fascinated by its own wild inventions in an
almost self-satisfied way, and while Chabon does work hard to tell
his tale, by winking so often at his reader in a knowing sort of way,
he drains his book of energy, producing an oddly bloodless book that
lacks both the dark pathos of drama and the explosive laughter of
comedy.</TE>
<TE>   Put another way, one might say the book's irony is finally
unsorted, as "Summerland" nods too often in the direction of
postmodern self-parody without going whole hog, resulting in a tone
that proves tiresome for its 500 pages.</TE>
<TE>   A successful children's book must compel the youthful imagination
into its fantasy world; it must offer the child reader no choice but
to assent to the vision it offers. In addition, it must be
susceptible of being read aloud by grown-ups, for children sail on
the voice of the adult reader into the uncharted territory of great
imaginative fiction.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, "Summerland" fails on both accounts. As my budding
10-year-old literary critic complained, "Summerland" is not terribly
exciting, even though it promises to be, and so it was that our
nightly reading sessions proved onerous rather than pleasurable. He
noted that Coyote is supposed to be the most evil figure in the
cosmos, but finally there is nothing terrifying about him, as there
is, say, about J.R.R. Tolkien's reptilian nemesis Sauron.</TE>
<TE>   So it is that the final baseball confrontation between Ethan's
Shadowtails and Coyote's Hobbledehoys at Ragged Rock lacks juice and
reads more like a foul ball than a home run. My 7-year-old, an avid
reader of Brian Jacques' outstanding "Redwall" fantasy novels, found
the book's terminology gratuitous and grating: Why not call fairies
"fairies" instead of "ferishers"? Aren't fairies good enough? As for
me, I found the book dull, despite its pyrotechnical invention. Then
again, I must admit that I find baseball unusually dull too, so
perhaps my judgment is not to be trusted.</TE>

<HD>The Enduring Moral Outrage of Emile Zola</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FREDERICK BROWN</AU>
<BD>Frederick Brown is the author of "Zola: A Life" and is
writing a biography of Gustave Flaubert.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During the early morning hours of Sept. 29, 1902, Emile Zola died in
his sleep of carbon monoxide poisoning from a defective flue. Almost
five years had passed since the publication of his open letter to the
president of the French Republic alleging that the army, with
evidence of espionage in its midst, had framed a Jewish artillery
officer, Alfred Dreyfus. And two weeks earlier, on Sept. 10, 1902,
L'Aurore had begun serializing his novel "Verite," which was based in
part on what had come to be known as "The Affair."</LD>
<LD>   Zola's death was ruled accidental, but unanswered questions left
open the possibility that one of the many anti-Dreyfusards who
regularly sent him threatening letters had murdered him. When a
leftist government elected in June closed all 3,000 schools run by
monastic orders known to have preached against Dreyfus, Jews,
freemasons and republican institutions, the vindictiveness Zola had
excited in 1898 with "J'Accuse" boiled up anew.</LD>
<TE>   Huge crowds, including a delegation of miners grateful for the
legislation inspired by "Germinal," followed Zola's coffin to the
Montmartre cemetery, where soldiers stood ready to maintain civil
order. Fearful that praise of her husband's political heroism might
spark a riot, Alexandrine Zola asked the principal eulogist, Anatole
France, whether it might not be prudent to commemorate only his
literary achievement. France, another eminent foe of the reactionary
elements marshaled against Dreyfus, ignored her request; he paid
homage above all to Zola the polemicist, whose famous letter had, in
his view, launched a movement of social equity predicated upon
respect for individual rights and the rule of law.</TE>
<TE>   "Let us not pity the man who endured and suffered," France urged
the mourners, among whom stood Dreyfus. "Let us envy him. Enthroned
atop a prodigious collection of outrages heaped up by folly,
ignorance, and wickedness, his glory shines on high. Let us envy him:
He has honored his country and the world with an immense body of work
and a great act." France's last line is what rings loudest today:
"Let us envy him, for his destiny and his heart have earned him the
highest distinction of all: He was a moment in the history of human
conscience."</TE>
<TE>   Had Zola's childhood been allowed to intrude upon this lordly
farewell, a eulogist might have described the Dreyfus Affair as
satisfaction finally given to a born duelist, or as the event
rounding out a life that had begun with injustice meted out in rigged
trials. Born in 1840, Zola was 7 when his father, an Italian engineer
who had designed a dam under Mont Sainte-Victoire for channeling
water to Aix-en-Provence, died on the eve of its construction.
Well-connected swindlers gained control of the Zola Canal Co.,
reincorporated it and left Madame Zola with worthless shares. She
sued, making one futile appeal after another in litigation that
spanned Zola's adolescence.</TE>
<TE>   This rancorous drama--with its scheming notables, its hero
defrauded posthumously of his accomplishment, its heir cheated of his
birthright, its poverty-stricken widow--served the novelist and
polemicist throughout his life. It led him, in his 20s, to lash out
against the artistic establishment in articles championing Edouard
Manet, who had been rejected by the Salon jury. It became the
paradigm of his great novelistic cycle, "Les Rougon-Macquart," which
swarms with outcasts, the disinherited and plots that illustrate
mischief practiced by the avaricious upon the naive or defenseless.
And it fired his imagination when Dreyfus' partisans, needing a big
voice, called upon him to trumpet the evidence they had collected.
Their recitation of the facts became poetry for Zola, according to
one such partisan: " 'It's gripping!' he'd say from time to time ....
And he exclaimed: 'It's thrilling! It's horrible! It's a frightful
drama! But it's drama on the grand scale!' "</TE>
<TE>   Still, not every celebrant of Zola's courageous indictment would
have been quick to salute him. From the outset, before the first word
of "Les Rougon-Macquart" had been written, he inveighed against
ideologues who viewed art as a lackey to their political agendas. In
an article on the socialist thinker Proudhon, Zola wrote that good
citizenship had no bearing upon the creative enterprise, that an
artist would lose his defining credentials without license to speak
his imagination or to chronicle his experience.</TE>
<TE>   Thenceforth, critics of every persuasion, but especially leftists
pledged to a kind of buttoned-up reformism, showed him no mercy. It
was the militant republican Louis Ulbach who built a pyre for
"Therese Raquin" and other works he collectively anathematized as
litterature putride. And when Zola published "L'Assommoir," his
powerful evocation of life in the slums, Leon Gambetta's newspaper,
La Republique Francaise, berated him for slandering the proletariat
with characters almost all given to drunkenness and sexual
promiscuity. Politically incorrect as well was the slang Zola put in
the mouths of his illiterate personae. Liberal-minded bourgeois, bred
at classical lycees on the dictum that whoever ruled French ruled
France, decried Zola's bold mimicry as patronizing, if not
expropriative. He was said to have enshrined, with argot, the
cultural isolation of the working class.</TE>
<TE>   To gentlemen whose creed hinged on reason and progress, the
theories of heredity in "Les Rougon-Macquart" may have been even more
offensive than Zola's use of a primitive, "barbaric" language.
Heredity makes itself felt as an inborn Nemesis that keeps pulling
climbers off the upper rungs of the social ladder and thwarting more
modest ascensions.</TE>
<TE>   Ghosts stalk the Rougons and the Macquarts in their hectic
deployment at every level of French society, which is to say that the
past simply won't stay buried. Like Furies enforcing archaic law, or
original sin sweeping away the historical record, or a tribal id
wreaking havoc with the rational designs of individual egos, it
usually exacts its due. The symbolic poles between which Zola's
imagination swings are Paris--the object of provincial aspirations,
the gleaming new capital built by France's sovereign parvenu,
Napoleon III--and an obscure Provencal hamlet called Les Artaud.
Descended from one ancestor, the village's 300 inhabitants all bear
the same name and marry among themselves. Turned in upon itself, this
tiny enclave exists at the beginning of time as an archaic community,
surrounded by the 19th century.</TE>
<TE>   The conjunction of minds locked in the Stone Age and a technology
created by modern science recurs throughout "Les Rougon-Macquart." As
much as anything else, it is this mismatch that gives Zola's work its
originality and atrocious pertinence.</TE>
<TE>   Examples abound. Machines in "Germinal" loom over mine heads like
Jurassic beasts resting on their haunches while half-naked women
1,500 feet underground push coal-laden carts on all fours. In "La
Terre," the bourgeois who introduces scientific agriculture
half-a-day's journey from Paris has his farm destroyed by homicidal
autochthons whose relationship to the soil is more anal than seminal.</TE>
<TE>   In "La Debacle," there are the great Prussian cannons, once
displayed at Paris' Universal Exposition of 1867, blasting Sedan
during the Franco-Prussian War. And in "La Bete Humaine," there is a
train that runs out of control--a troop train whose conductor and
stoker have killed each other, barreling toward the eastern front.
Here, the vehicle on which man, confident in his mastery over nature,
rides proudly is detached from rational purpose by jealous rage. A
consummate instrument of progress becomes a Moloch of collective
self-immolation.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Flaubert, who abhorred the label "realist," Zola sported
that of "naturalist," but the scientific credentials he thus claimed
for himself obscure the fact that he was, as much as his older
friend, a child of Romanticism. Had he been merely diligent, the
preparatory files bulging with facts and figures on which he drew to
create an empirical scaffolding for each story would be no less
valuable than the novels themselves.</TE>
<TE>   What makes the best of Zola's fiction great literature is its
visionary power. It was the irrational undertow of a positivist age
that kept him writing, and it inspired memorable images of
apocalypse. "L'Assommoir" ends with earthmovers advancing upon the
slum doomed to extinction as Napoleon III's Paris climbs Montmartre.
In "Germinal," an underground lake bursts into the labyrinthine
corridors of the mine. Nana unleashes Eros upon the affluent capital.</TE>
<TE>   One imagines that Anatole France's praise of "J'Accuse" as the
inaugural manifesto of an enlightened social order would have made
Zola acutely uncomfortable. Experience had taught him not to believe
in new dispensations. Had he lived, experience would have confirmed
that belief again and again: in August 1914, when men marched
exuberantly to the front with the roses of cheering women in their
gun barrels; in 1916, when cannons at Verdun rained death on a
quarter million human moles to either side of no man's land; and
during the 1930s, when French fascists joined royalist bully boys or
Camelots du Roi in proclaiming Dreyfus' ineradicable guilt.</TE>
<TE>   Modernity for Zola embodied the paradox of progress fostering
regression, of material aggrandizement cheapening human character, of
science lording it over nature as instinct comes increasingly to lord
it over men, of civilized France promoting ideals as uncivilized
French seek a tonic in slaughter and expunge the "other" in the
service of tribal myths or in the name of class conflict.</TE>
<TE>   For Zola, modernity also resided in the social and spiritual
consequences of a world dedicated to movement. Where movement, social
mobility no less than physical movement, occupies the exalted seat
formerly occupied by moral imperatives, what is forfeit is a sense of
assured place and humane proportion. "All or nothing," proclaims
Vautrin, Balzac's Satanic underworld banker, and this motto might
serve as an epigraph to "Les Rougon-Macquart." On the one hand,
unscrupulous entrepreneurs cannot acquire wealth enough to confect an
identity as real as the one they buried. On the other, destitution
has no limits in such a world.</TE>
<TE>   When Gervaise, transplanted from a sun-drenched southern town,
loses her shop in "L'Assommoir," she ends up living and dying under a
tenement staircase and carrying her extinct ambitions to potter's
field.</TE>

<HD>Tell Us Something, Anything, Even If It's a Lie</HD>
<DH>CARAMELO: A Novel, By Sandra Cisneros, Alfred A. Knopf: 448
pp., $24</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE CIABATTARI</AU>
<BD>Jane Ciabattari is the author of the short-story
collection "Stealing the Fire."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It has been nearly 20 years since Sandra Cisneros' acclaimed first
novel, "The House on Mango Street," a coming-of-age story told in
poetic vignettes, brought her unique voice and the Chicana experience
to millions of American readers. High school and college students in
particular found her first novel authentic and simpatico. Her 1991
short story collection, "Woman Hollering Creek," offered a wider
range of voices, a broader scope.</LD>
<LD>   With "Caramelo," her exuberant, overstuffed new novel, she
undertakes storytelling on a grand scale, detailing the struggles and
joys of three generations of a family that bridges the Mexican,
Mexican American and American experiences during the momentous
migrations of the last century, evoking a subtle panorama of cultural
shifts. Its characters leap from the page in all their flawed
humanity, falling in and out of love, squabbling and making up,
working hard and making do.</LD>
<TE>   Cisneros, the daughter of a Mexican father and a Chicana mother,
considers herself a "bicultural citizen." In "Caramelo," she blends
English and Spanish language and literary traditions (among them the
picaresque novel and the testimonio, the Latin American testimonial
narrative that often incorporates oral history) into her own
unprecedented mix. She weaves Spanish words, phrases, song lyrics and
poems throughout the novel. "Spanish gives me a way of looking at
myself and at the world in a new way," she has said. "For those of us
who are living between worlds, our job in the universe is to help
others see with more than their eyes during this period of chaotic
transition." ("Caramelo" is being published simultaneously in
Spanish.)</TE>
<TE>   "Caramelo" opens with a postmodern caveat: "The truth, these
stories are nothing but story, bits of string, odds and ends found
here and there, embroidered together to make something new. I have
invented what I do not know and exaggerated what I do to continue the
family tradition of telling healthy lies. "</TE>
<TE>   The chief storyteller is Celaya (or Lala) Reyes, her family's only
daughter. "I am the favorite child of a favorite child. I know my
worth. Mother named me after a famous battle where Pancho Villa met
his Waterloo. I am the seventh born in the Reyes family of six sons."</TE>
<TE>   Lala's beloved father, Inocencio, and his two brothers, Uncle
Fat-Face and Uncle Baby, have settled in Chicago to run a furniture
upholstering business. The first section of the novel tells of the
fateful car trip their families take across the border to spend the
summer in Mexico City with the "Little Grandfather," "Awful
Grandmother," "Aunty Light-Skin" and her daughter. The trip involves
three couples, three cars, 12 children. This is at mid-century, in
the days before air conditioning.</TE>
<TE>   "--Are we in Mexico yet?--No, not yet. [Sleep, wake up.]--Are we
in Mexico yet?--Still Texas. [Sleep, wake up.]--Are we ... --Christ
Almighty!!!"</TE>
<TE>   Then comes the border. "No more billboards announcing the next
Stuckey's candy store, no more truck-stop donuts or roadside picnics
with bologna-and-cheese sandwiches and cold bottles of 7-Up.... Now
we'll drink fruit-flavored sodas, tamarind, apple, pineapple.... The
smell of diesel exhaust, the smell of somebody roasting coffee, the
smell of hot corn tortillas along with the pat-pat of the women's
hands, making them, the sting of roasting chiles in your throat and
in your eyes."</TE>
<TE>   In the course of the summer, the brothers and their families
quarrel, Uncle Fat-Face and Uncle Baby take off, and Inocencio's
family stays, increasing the tension between his wife and his
possessive mother. This conflict reaches a crescendo when the
remaining family group spends a few days in Acapulco.</TE>
<TE>   Candelaria, the daughter of the Awful Grandmother's washerwoman,
comes along to help out. Lala, who noticed her first for her skin
color--caramelo, the golden color of burnt-milk candy--already has
found her an appealing playmate. Candelaria is the centerpiece of a
major blowup when the Awful Grandmother tells her daughter-in-law,
Lala's mother, a terrible secret. (We don't learn what it is until
nearly the end of the book.) At this point, in a long middle section,
Lala chronicles the early life of her grandparents, before the Awful
Grandmother became awful. Lala's narrative is sometimes interrupted
by boldface questions from her disembodied grandmother, who argues
that she should be portrayed in a positive light:</TE>
<TE>   "--You have the sensitivity of an ax murderer. You are killing me
with this story you're telling."</TE>
<TE>   "--Nobody wants to hear your invented happiness," responds Lala,
who understands the basis for a satisfying story, be it Tolstoy or
Telemundo. "It's your troubles that make a good story. Who wants to
hear about a nice person? The more terrible you are, the better the
story. You'll see .... "</TE>
<TE>   The Awful Grandmother once was a girl named Soledad, the daughter
of master makers of rebozos, the traditional Mexican shawls. Her
father specialized in black shawls, black being the most difficult
color to dye; her mother was expert at knotting fringe into elaborate
designs, some of which took 146 hours to complete. Soledad's mother
dies while she is still a baby, leaving behind an unfinished rebozo.
"Even with half its fringe hanging unbraided like mermaid's hair, it
was an exquisite rebozo... the cloth a beautiful blend of toffee,
licorice and vanilla stripes flecked with black and white, which is
why they call this design a caramelo." Soledad's father remarries and
sends her to a cousin, who puts her to work as a servant. The
unfinished candy-striped caramelo rebozo comforts her and weaves its
way through the rest of the story, ultimately becoming Lala's prized
possession.</TE>
<TE>   In the third and last section of the novel, Lala begins to grow
up. Her grandmother sells her house in Mexico and comes to live with
her family; they travel from Chicago to San Antonio and back again,
descending deeper into poverty. For reasons that don't seem clear,
she has a fling with Ernesto, a buddy of her brothers. Her best
friend in San Antonio, a feisty seventh-generation Tex-Mexican, comes
and goes too quickly. In fact, a number of secondary
characters--including those six brothers, the uncles, aunts and
cousins--pale in comparison to those closest to Lala, especially her
father and grandmother.</TE>
<TE>   Cisneros incorporates footnotes into the narrative, comprising
Lala's digressions from the main story line; snatches of Mexican
history (cross-border skirmishes such as Woodrow Wilson's invasion of
Tampico in 1914 and Pancho Villa's 1916 raid on Columbus, N.M., for
instance); and commentary on pop culture figures, such as Senor
Wences, the Mexican ventriloquist who was a regular on "The Ed
Sullivan Show" and one of the first Latinos to appear on U.S.
television, and Pedro Armendariz, the Mexican film idol whom Elia
Kazan wanted for the starring role in "Viva Zapata" that went to
Marlon Brando. Some of these footnotes are enlightening; others seem
unfinished. But for the most part, Cisneros, like a masterful
rebocero, artfully weaves together the various threads of her story:
"The universe a cloth, and all humanity interwoven," says Lala. "Each
and every person connected to me, and me connected to them, like the
strands of a rebozo. Pull one string and the whole thing comes
undone."</TE>
<TE>   "Caramelo" is infused with the permanent nostalgia of exile, of
those who live in between cultures. Inocencio Reyes, Lala's father,
experiences "that terrible ache and nostalgia for home when home is
gone.... In less than three hours we could be at the border, but
where is the border to the past, I ask you, where?"</TE>
<TE>   Like Eduardo Galeano, John Dos Passos and John Steinbeck, Cisneros
writes along the borders where the novel and social history
intersect. She is particularly gifted at showing how the ebb and flow
of history affect those previously marginalized: the poor, the
immigrants, the women who have been traditionally without a voice in
literature. In this lovingly told and poetic novel, she uses the
storytelling art to give these voiceless ones a voice, and to find
the border to the past, imbuing the struggles of her family and her
countries with the richness of myth.</TE>

<HD>Years of Terror, Decades of Denial</HD>
<DH>SILENCE ON THE MOUNTAIN: Stories of Terror, Betrayal, and
Forgetting in Guatemala, By Daniel Wilkinson ,Houghton Mifflin: 374
pp., $24</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK CULLATHER</AU>
<BD>Nick Cullather is the author of "Secret History:The
CIA's Classified Account of Its Operations in Guatemala, 1952-1954."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Guatemala's history slips at times into magical realism. In 1902,
President Manuel Estrada Cabrera, a character who might have been
contrived by Isabel Allende, issued a decree denying the eruption of
the Santa Maria volcano, which was at that moment raining ash and
flaming debris on the capital. Rather than alarm European investors,
Estrada Cabrera sacrificed truth to power, an option exercised again
half a century later, this time by the U.S. Central Intelligence
Agency, which announced by radio to the Guatemalan people the
existence of a civil war that did not, until then, exist.</LD>
<LD>   The imaginary war soon became real enough, and by the 1980s, the
Reagan administration was officially denying massacres perpetrated by
the Guatemalan army in return for the army's help in lying to
Congress about illegal arms shipments to Nicaraguan Contras.
Prisoners of the tales others told about them, Guatemalans expressed
dissent by inventing dark legends of robachicos, gringos who came to
steal the kidneys of children for sale in American hospitals. With
history splintered into a thousand private memories, stories could no
longer explain, only conceal.</LD>
<TE>   In 1996, as part of a peace agreement between the Guatemalan
resistance and the government, the Comision para el Esclarecimiento
Historico, sanctioned by the United Nations, began a search for the
"authentic truth" of Guatemala's dirty war amid the debris of deceit
and betrayal dating back to 1954. Daniel Wilkinson, a Harvard law
student, volunteered to gather stories from La Igualdad, a town in
the coffee piedmont surrounded by plantations where the dark glossy
beans are harvested and sent north to fill the bins at espresso bars
in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Wilkinson had tried for several years to break the barrier of
silence surrounding the community's past. Harvard connections had
opened the doors of generals and landowners, but workers and ordinary
townspeople deflected his questions with evangelical slogans. The act
of storytelling required a trust that years of psychological warfare
had systematically broken. "No one believes in anyone anymore," one
woman explained.</TE>
<TE>   The silence was thickest around the years immediately before the
1954 coup. During the preceding decade, presidents Juan Jose Arevalo
and Jacobo Arbenz attempted to modernize the Guatemalan state. In the
early 20th century, law and repression had built the coffee economy,
displacing Mayan peoples and binding them in debt to plantations
owned by German immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Arevalo and Arbenz set out to replace this feudalism, instituting
a minimum wage and banning compulsory labor. In 1952, Arbenz issued
Decree 900, a land reform that might have made Guatemala's social
volcano disappear. Leaving the coffee and banana groves intact, it
gave workers just enough property to change them from dependents into
consumers. It changed the world of La Igualdad, but few would speak
of it to Wilkinson. An ex-guerrilla could only recall that his
parents had told him "about how for a short time we had been able to
live with dignity."</TE>
<TE>   In 1954, the CIA, in one of its first successful covert actions,
overthrew Arbenz and his reforms, and Wilkinson's research reveals
how thoroughly the counterrevolution stripped away 10 years of
progress. Workers were told that the sewing machines and motorbikes
bought with their earnings were not theirs and had to be "returned"
to the landlord. Plantations expelled workers who had unionized or
accepted property under the reform. And there were arrests and
executions. Guatemalans learned to fear "politics" that could make
jobs, homes and people disappear, and so the memory of what was once
hoped for vanished instead.</TE>
<TE>   After a peace settlement ended the civil war in 1996, fragments of
the past returned to La Igualdad. Lists of the disappeared emerged
from hiding places. Guerrillas came back from the mountains, and the
army's presence became less threatening. Wilkinson writes after the
manner of Philip Gourevitch ("We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We
Will Be Killed With Our Families"), although somewhat less sparely,
describing interviews but also the motorcycle ride to the interview,
the sudden tropical cloudburst afterward and the hotel rooms to which
he arrived, muddy and discouraged, at the end of a long day.
Gourevitch's account of the Rwandan genocide asks how a nation heals
from the shared memory of trauma; Wilkinson wants to know where the
memories come from and who fills the silences in the aftermath of a
national catastrophe.</TE>
<TE>   Resistance to the government, repeatedly frustrated by rigged
elections in the 1960s and 1970s, erupted in guerrilla war in the
1980s. In that conflict, the behavior of soldiers on both sides was
shaped by stories: One of Wilkinson's informants explains that the
rebels mounted revenge attacks on landlords and police posts until
Rodrigo Asturias, son of the Nobel prize-winning novelist Miguel
Angel Asturias, assumed their leadership. Asturias taught them their
struggle was for "identity" and refashioned them into "a real
guerrilla army." Leaving the plantations, they spread across the
chain of volcanoes stretching between the capital and the Mexican
border and mounted bold attacks on army garrisons. Identifying
themselves as the army of the poor, they were stunned when the poor
occasionally resisted their help.</TE>
<TE>   The sweep of the rebellion threw the army off balance until the
army itself achieved a narrative breakthrough. Under the guidance of
Hector Gramajo, the army rewrote the war as a struggle for its own
professional identity. To become a real army, it stopped answering to
landowners, politicians or even the United States. With U.S. supplied
firepower, soldiers emerged from guard posts around plantations and
clinched the guerrillas' base areas in surround-and-destroy
operations. Terror, including death squads and the massacre of whole
villages, severed the link between the rebels and the people. The war
had been effectively won by the early 1990s, but it was unclear who
the army had won the victory for. Neither story proved salable to the
electorate, and both Gramajo and the rebels lost at the polls to
Alvaro Arzu Irigoyen, who belonged to neither faction.</TE>
<TE>   Beneath these shifting representations is the reality of the
global market, whose temper and moods are familiar to Central
Americans. In a Guatemalan town, Wilkinson observes, "you could watch
the world economy chugging away, like an engine with its casing off."
Coffee and bananas are unforgiving commodities, imposing a cycle of
bonanza and debt deadly to workers but hard also on their employers.
Liberal landowners who resolved after the war to offer minimum wage
and benefits found they had to evict half their employees to make it
work. The 1996 treaty brought peace but not redemption. Guatemalans
continue to live among enemies and with the knowledge that a blip on
the Chicago exchange or a strategy shift in Washington could begin it
all again.</TE>
<TE>   When the Comision para el Esclarecimiento Historico (Commission
for Historical Elucidation) arrived in La Igualdad two years after
the truce, it came close to igniting a new war. The town's rival
political factions, seeking to control the inquiry, each enlisted
families of the dead to appear at separate hearings. As the town
arrayed its memories for combat, Wilkinson dropped his observer's
neutrality and tried to bring the groups together in the face of
intimidation by anonymous goon squads. He had struggled earlier with
doubts about the value of truth under the shadow of destruction. In
school, he had believed in knowledge, "that it was attainable and
that attaining it was good."</TE>
<TE>   La Igualdad's impenetrable mystery had shaken Wilkinson's faith,
but now a collective assertion of truth seemed the only escape from
the culture of fear. As he vividly captures the emotion of the
community's terrifying struggle toward that exit, he ultimately
suggests that safety for ordinary Guatemalans will depend on their
skill at putting stories before global audiences through the media
and the human rights organizations. At the book's close, however, we
do not know if the self-knowledge La Igualdad gained brought more
security or less.</TE>
<TE>   The truth commission's final report made front page news in
February 1999. The report cataloged the eradication of 400 Mayan
villages and 200,000 deaths or disappearances, but refrained from
assigning blame to specific individuals. It laid heaviest
responsibility on the army and the United States, which had acted to
maintain, the commission chairman said, an "archaic and unjust
socioeconomic structure." At its Langley, Va., headquarters, where an
inscription in marble reads "You shall know the truth, and the truth
shall set you free," a CIA spokesman observed that it would be
inappropriate to comment.</TE>

<LD>POEMS OF PAUL CELAN</LD>
<LD>   Translated from the</LD>
<LD>   German by Michael Hamburger</LD>
<TE>   Persea Books: 350 pp.,</TE>
<TE>   $16.95 paper</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Paul Celan's extraordinary "Death Fugue" is often thought of as
the most essential and devastating poem of the 20th century.</TE>
<TE>   Black milk of daybreak we drink it at sundown</TE>
<TE>   we drink it at noon in the morning we drink it at night ...</TE>
<TE>   This new edition of Michael Hamburger's remarkable translations
(including "Death Fugue") of Celan's poems provides not only a
revised and expanded selection of this difficult poet's work but an
introduction, postscript and notes that illuminate the arduous and
exhilarating task of rendering Celan into English from the German.</TE>
<TE>   We dig a grave in the breezes ...</TE>
<TE>   A man lives in the house he plays with the serpents he writes</TE>
<TE>   Paul Celan was born Paul Antschel (changed to Ancel then Celan, a
name-anagram that he adopted in 1947 when he first published his
work) in Romania in 1920. In 1941, German forces occupied Romania
and, in 1942, Celan's parents were deported to a camp, where they
died: his father of typhus, his mother of a bullet in the neck. Celan
escaped arrest but was later sent to a hard labor camp.</TE>
<TE>   he writes when dusk falls to Germany your golden hair</TE>
<TE>   Margarete</TE>
<TE>   In 1944, Celan returned to what remained of his life in Romania.
He worked as a translator and eventually became a lecturer in German
literature, and began writing his indescribable, anomalous
poems--quasi-surreal, expressionist, lyrical. He married and moved to
Paris, where, haunted by his parents' deaths and the Holocaust, he
drowned himself in the Seine in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   he writes it and steps out of doors and the stars are flashing he</TE>
<TE>   whistles his pack out</TE>
<TE>   he whistles his Jews out in the earth has them dig for a grave</TE>
<TE>   he commands us strike up for the dance</TE>
<TE>   Hamburger implies that biographical ruminations about Celan will
go on attempting to illuminate "the anomaly and extremity of his
passion as a poet." If the "black milk" is ash from the crematoria,
then the "extremity" of Celan's passion as a poet is powerfully felt
in this reference to his own life--but also in the very pronouns in
the poem that change from "we drink it" to "we drink you," at the
lyric's end--as the black milk changes from an "impersonal" pronoun
to a "you," a "person"--as the ash becomes human remains.</TE>
<TE>   He calls out more sweetly play death death is a master from
Germany</TE>
<TE>   he calls out more darkly now stroke your strings then as smoke</TE>
<TE>   you will rise into the air</TE>
<TE>   Celan's poems defy description. They require a searching
translator to find, in English, the words that are nearly
"equivalent" to those of his haunted poems. Hamburger is that
translator.</TE>
<TE>   Black milk of daybreak we drink you at night</TE>
<TE>   We drink you at noon</TE>

<TE>   NOW THE GREEN BLADE RISES</TE>
<TE>   by Elizabeth Spires</TE>
<TE>   W.W. Norton: 82 pp., $21.95</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Now the Green Blade Rises" by Elizabeth Spires echoes not only
Dylan Thomas but an English carol--"Now the green blade rises from
the buried grain / Wheat that in the dark earth many days has
lain"--and locates these shattering lyrics (a sequence of poems
connected to the poet's mother's death) in the elegiac tradition, but
with an ambivalent turning toward renewal.</TE>
<TE>   Spires' sense of renewal is never predictable. At times, the
inexorable ongoingness of life seems monstrous and her grief the only
articulation of hopelessness.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, when the phone</TE>
<TE>   rings, I think it is you.</TE>
<TE>   Three months, and I still believe</TE>
<TE>   I'll hear your voice at the other end</TE>
<TE>   of the line. But you're dead,</TE>
<TE>   and the world is ash. Your body.</TE>
<TE>   Words that used to live.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the canvas enlarges:</TE>
<TE>   Though all had vanished, I felt strange joy.</TE>
<TE>   Above, gulls circled and laughed, circled and laughed,</TE>
<TE>   the waves a series of small endless events, lapping</TE>
<TE>   at thousands of smooth white stones on the shore,</TE>
<TE>   the shining grey years of our lives before us.</TE>
<TE>   Spires, with characteristic precision, pinpoints the "small
endless events" that make up our lives. What she offers in these
poems, instead of hope, is a (at times buoyed-up) resignation, an
acceptance of all that is disappearing before us. "And I thought,
never will I see this happen again."</TE>
<TE>   Spires is a jewel of a poet, never self-conscious or
self-indulgent, yet her poems glow with the intensity of
closely-observed intimate detail. These grieving poems challenge our
fragile "selves"--yet, like Celan's, they reassert the dignity of the
self in every line.</TE>

<HD>The Burden of Kinship, the Ties of Blood</HD>
<DH>FAMILY MATTERS: A Novel, By Rohinton Mistry, Alfred A.
Knopf: 440 pp., $26</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER GREEN</AU>
<BD>Peter Green is the former fiction critic of the London
Daily Telegraph.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a famous poem, W.H. Auden once wrote: "We must love one another or
die." He later withdrew the poem ("September 1, 1939") and repudiated
the sentiment; but the line kept recurring to me while reading
Rohinton Mistry's novel "Family Matters," in which the family death
rate that is due to lack of love approaches about half a dozen.</LD>
<LD>   Mistry's title is nicely ambiguous. Is "Family Matters" noun-verb
or adjective-noun? In Bombay's Parsee society, family clearly matters
a great deal. But coping with the actual matters--emotional,
financial, medical, psychological, physical--that family relations
impose, too often, as Mistry shows in devastating detail, wears away
the love, replacing it with sour distaste, unacknowledged fear,
simmering resentment and sheer desperation.</LD>
<LD>   Hopeless dreams breed bizarre and fantastic solutions. Remembered
wrongs poison the mind. Kinship becomes a burden, the ties of blood
an arbitrary imposition. Poverty exacerbates every problem and hones
the fine edge of hysteria.</LD>
<TE>   The tentacles of family relationships, like mother-in-law jokes
and quarrels over wills, are universal, and, as the collected fiction
of Ivy Compton-Burnett amply testifies, having a reasonable amount of
money doesn't always let you off the hook, either. Those characters
in "Family Matters" who, near the end, are rescued by a
Dickensian-type windfall soon start working up a new set of
irritations.</TE>
<TE>   In one sense, Mistry's Bombay simply becomes a crowded, garish,
exotic background for a generic study of siblings, stepchildren,
spouses and lovers under pressure: indeed, in a pressure cooker.
(Mistry, with his sharp eye for symbolism, describes a
pressure-cooker exploding, plastering the kitchen walls with yellow
dal and tomato gravy. "Looks like a Jackson Pollock," says an
admiring visitor.) The book-club interest in this novel, and its
75,000 initial print run, strongly suggest that the human
relationships dissected here transcend national (Indian) and
religious (Zarathustrian) boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   Mistry's central, and largely passive, character, around whom the
action revolves, is Nariman Vakeel, retired professor of English
literature at Bombay University, and, in his late 70s, rapidly
succumbing to Parkinson's disease.</TE>
<TE>   At least as lethal, long-term, are the various decisions he has
made, or has allowed to be made for him, earlier in his life. There
is, first and foremost, his long and essentially unresolved love
affair with Lucy Braganza, a Catholic, and hence anathema to
Nariman's relatives, who pressure him into marrying a suitable Parsee
widow, Yasmin.</TE>
<TE>   Yasmin's children, Coomy and Jal, fiercely resent their new
stepfather, mostly because he can't bring himself to break free from
Lucy, which makes their mama miserable, often melodramatically so. On
the other hand, they're prepared to spoil the one daughter, Roxana,
that Yasmin bears her new husband. Resentment, however, flares again
when, on Roxana's marriage to a sporting goods salesman, Yezad
Chenoy, Nariman insists on buying them an apartment.</TE>
<TE>   The two apartments--their respective complexes are named, with
not-so-subtle irony, Chateau Felicity and Pleasant Villa--play a
major part in the development of family relations. In the vast,
rundown and gloomy retreat of Chateau Felicity, Nariman lives in
retirement as the unwelcome responsibility of stepdaughter Coomy,
whose spinsterish irritability keeps the atmosphere permanently
gritty. Her brother Jal says yes to everything and spends his time
playing the market.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, across town, the Chenoys' tiny flat is bursting at the
seams with them and their two near-adolescent boys. The symbolism of
opposites--big apartment, small childless group; minuscule flat,
growing rumbustious family--is duly hammered home: Mistry never
shrinks from whacking his readers over the head with the obvious, one
factor (I suspect) in his undoubted popularity.</TE>
<TE>   The main thrust of the novel is provided by Coomy's frantic and
successful effort, after a horrific week or two of trying to cope
with sponge baths and bedpans (no details spared), to unload her
stepfather on the Chenoys and then to weasel out of taking him back.
Even Roxana, who comes pretty close to that famous Victorian mythic
figure, the Angel in the House, has her patience sorely tried.</TE>
<TE>   No party in this family crisis has much money to spare: Nariman's
bedridden presence breaks Roxana's budget just as it did Coomy's. And
all the time, in the background, hinted at but only revealed toward
the end, is the poisonous mystery of Yasmin's and Lucy's deaths.</TE>
<TE>   It is in the various frantic, bizarre and inevitably
self-destructive attempts to bring in more cash, or stave off
Nariman's presence, that Mistry scores best. Coomy roughs up her own
plaster ceilings trying to fake a cistern flood and gets killed when
a beam falls on her head. Yezad drops a bundle on an illegal lottery,
then sets up a shakedown to push his boss into running for municipal
office and turning the business over to him.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, his boss gets killed and his widow closes the store and
fires Yezad. Improbable, but just credible. What defies belief is the
solution that transfers the Chenoys to Chateau Felicity: They somehow
never noticed, poor though they were, that their little flat, in a
desirable area, had increased in value more than tenfold, so that
selling it (Jal's bright idea) produced a windfall. I mean, come on.</TE>
<TE>   What enriches "Family Matters" are the minor characters and
lovingly described scenes of daily life: Here Mistry frequently put
me in mind of Vikram Seth's vast Indian panorama, "A Suitable Boy."
He includes fascinating descriptions of Zarathustrian temple ritual
(and of the complex socio-religious taboos which impinge, sometimes
devastatingly, on these characters' lives). The scene in which Daisy,
the downstairs tenant and first violin in the Bombay Symphony
Orchestra, keeps her promise to play for Nariman on his deathbed is,
against all odds, genuinely moving.</TE>
<TE>   There are wonderful descriptions of Indian home cooking. Local
color, though, the reader is warned, partly depends on a regular
blizzard of untranslated vernacular scattered throughout Mistry's
text: fine, but without a glossary, highly frustrating.</TE>

<DH>FROM A BUICK 8: A Novel, By Stephen King, Scribner: 368
pp., $28</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL HARRIS</AU>
<BD>Michael Harris is a regular contributor to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Does Stephen King have to write spooky stuff? A stupid question, it
would seem. King answered it in his recent memoir, "On Writing," in
which he recalled how, as a student, he'd quit trying to write
sensitive, restrained fiction because what really got his juices
flowing was a scary story about rats. He challenged the notion that
the serious writer "controls the material instead of the other way
around," and concluded: "I am built with a love of the night and the
opened coffin, that's all." Still, it's a question that won't go
away. And it's King's own fault.</LD>
<LD>   For one thing, in books such as "Hearts in Atlantis," he has
sprawled well outside the boundaries of the horror genre. For
another, King is serious. His latest novel, "From a Buick 8," is
stylistically assured, effortlessly suspenseful, with characters as
well-rounded as almost any "literary" novel can offer. That it has
spooky stuff in it is a bonus or a distraction, depending on one's
point of view.</LD>
<LD>   This is King's second haunted-car story, following "Christine,"
his tale of a homicidal 1956 Plymouth. The midnight-blue 1954 Buick
Roadmaster in this novel is a subtler beast. In the words of
Pennsylvania State Police Sgt. Sandy Dearborn, who was there in 1979
when the car was found abandoned at a rural gas station: "When you
got right down to it, it wasn't a 1954 at all. Or a Buick. Or even a
car. It was something else."</LD>
<TE>   It just sits there, and has for 23 years. In fact, it can do
nothing else. Its engine is unworkable, its gauges fake, its exhaust
system made of glass. (How it got to the gas station in the first
place is an unanswered question--the first of many.) The cops tow it
to a shed in back of the Troop D barracks and study it. Now and then
it shrugs off its tarpaulin, chills the shed even on the hottest days
and emits a piercing hum and flashes as bright as lightning.</TE>
<TE>   The Buick defies forensic analysis. After 23 years, the men and
women of Troop D can conclude nothing definite about it, except that
it "breathes." It seems to be an interface between worlds, a
porthole, an airlock. Now and then it exhales things--non-leaves,
non-bats, non-fish, non-lizards--that die on contact with Earth's
toxic atmosphere. Now and then, exerting a hypnotic attraction, it
inhales things, including one of the troopers.</TE>
<TE>   Eighteen-year-old Ned Wilcox finds out about the car after his
trooper father, Curt, is killed in a bloody highway crash--by a
drunken driver who, by coincidence (or maybe not), was the gas
station attendant who originally found the Buick. The boy hangs
around Troop D as a way of staying in touch with his father. The
cops, schooled in grief, understand this. They let Ned mow the grass
and help out the dispatcher.</TE>
<TE>   Before long, Ned becomes part of the Troop D "family" and thus
privy to the secret the troopers have kept all these years from their
nominal families and the rest of the world. Dearborn and the others
sit him down and tell him about the Buick and about how his father
was the most dedicated of the "scholars" investigating it.</TE>
<TE>   The telling of this tale, in many voices, takes up most of the
novel. Before it's done, we've learned about the troopers' jobs and
looked into their souls. We've gained insight into a small, insular
group, knit by love and loyalty and by a shared contempt--not
uncommon in law enforcement and the military--for "John Qs,"
civilians, the public that pays the bills but doesn't know what
police work truly costs.</TE>
<TE>   All this should be enough material for a fine novel--more than
enough, for writers of the restrained and sensitive variety. But King
gives us the car too. He has a reason. "From a Buick 8" (the title
echoes a Bob Dylan song) is about the human need to know, to find
answers even when none are available. This need is partly noble; it's
the foundation of all science and religion. But it can also get us
killed.</TE>
<TE>   Young Ned, no surprise, feels the car's sinister pull just as his
father did. The conclusion of the novel is thrilling, even though we
recognize that it's only fantasy. So here's that stubborn question
again: Is the trade-off--thrills for realism--worth it? King would
surely say yes: The car symbolizes all that's inexplicable in the
world, and it has more pizazz. King's fans might go further and say:
Enough subtlety. Bring back the original, blood-spattered Christine.
The sales figures will tell.</TE>

<LD>To the editor:</LD>
<LD>   I won't argue with Ruth Franklin's curious idea (Book Review,
Sept. 15) that place has nothing essential to do with poetry
(although her assertion that the premise of my anthology, "Poems of
the American West," is that "everything must happen somewhere" is
little short of ludicrous). But one might reasonably expect a critic
not to be such a careless reader. She seems to think that the West of
my book extends to the Mississippi, which, as the foreword makes
clear, it does not. She wonders why Arkansas should be included,
although Arkansas does not once appear. She thinks there is some
cowboy poetry in the book: There is none. She complains about too
many references to creosote (since the West "lends itself to
cliche"), but I am pretty sure there are no more than two little
creosote bushes in 250 pages. And she says that the book has a
"homogeneous feel" because it has very little verse from the 19th
century (as if there were a lot to choose from) and because there are
too many "male writers." Last but not least, she doesn't seem to know
very much about the art of poetry: I am sure there are a lot of
wonderful poems in the "Poems of New York," but just about every line
she chooses to quote is godawful.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Mezey</LD>
<TE>   Claremont</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ruth Franklin replies:</TE>
<TE>   I'm glad Robert Mezey and I can at least agree on the
unsuitability of Arkansas for "Poems of the American West": It was
there in the galleys, but he changed his mind before his book went to
press. As for "cowboy poetry," I guess he doesn't think poems about
cowboys qualify. But Mezey does not dispute the point of my review,
which was not to count the references to creosote but to show that
symbols of the West do not suffice to make a poem "Western." If a
poem is to be truly "of" the American West rather than just "about"
it, it needs to express the West in its concept: The landscape is
almost incidental.</TE>

<HD>Misfit by Conviction</HD>
<DH>Why George Orwell remains a writer of permanent relevance</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SIMON LEYS</AU>
<BD>Simon Leys, the pseudonym of Pierre Ryckmans, is the
author of "Chinese Shadows," "The Burning Forest: Essays on Chinese
Culture and Politics" and "The Angel and the Octopus," a collection
of essays that includes "Orwell: The Horror of Politics."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>George Orwell particularly liked Hans Christian Andersen's tale "The
Emperor's New Clothes," but he remarked that Andersen did not have
much psychological acumen: in real life, when a child has the cheek
to say that the emperor is naked, he is instantly silenced with a
good spanking.</LD>
<LD>   Orwell spoke from personal experience: the brave honesty with
which he had exposed the Stalinist betrayal of the Spanish republican
cause earned him the rabid enmity of the leftist intelligentsia,
which ensured that his firsthand testimony, the magnificent "Homage
to Catalonia," was first slandered, then strangled by a strict and
tight conspiracy of silence--and then buried off (the original 1938
edition, a modest printing of 1,500 copies, was still half-unsold 13
years later).</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, his "Animal Farm" had fallen foul of government censors
who attempted to prevent its publication ("Animal Farm" eventually
appeared in 1945 after 18 months of rejections and setbacks). Indeed,
immediately after the war, political opportunism even led U.S.
occupation authorities in Germany to seize and destroy the Ukrainian
edition of the book. (It might have offended the Soviet ally!)</LD>
<TE>   And finally--supreme indignity!--the very people against whom
Orwell had battled during his journalistic career endeavored to
appropriate "Nineteen Eighty-four" as ammunition for their own
crusade; the stupidity of the progressive camp, which had failed to
see that Orwell was in fact their greatest writer, enabled the
reactionaries to press-gang his dead body under their own banner. It
is because they had read him that the left thought they should hate
Orwell; whereas by not reading Orwell, the right could convince
themselves they loved him. The principal merit of Christopher
Hitchens' useful--though uneven and sometimes hasty--collection of
articles resides in its documented examination of the paradoxes
presented by Orwell's posthumous fate.</TE>
<TE>   In politics, the old divide between a brainless left and a
heartless right was well captured by Emerson: "There is always a
certain meanness in the arguments of the Conservatives combined with
a certain superiority in their facts." Orwell's unique strength--and
also his curse--derived from the fact that, even though his
commitment to socialism remained unwavering, at the same time (and to
the great distress of his comrades) he constantly maintained a
certain superiority of the facts. He never allowed political dogma to
encroach upon his sense of reality; this requires uncommon moral
discipline, but in the end, he could truly say: "Where I feel that
people like us understand the situation better than the so-called
experts, it is not in any power to foretell specific events, but in
the power to grasp what kind of world we are living in" (my
emphasis). Naturally, such "power" was not likely to endear him to
ideologues on his side of politics; as Hitchens shows, half a century
later, they still have not forgiven him.</TE>
<TE>   The driving force through Orwell's adult life was his passion for
justice. As a young man, he gave up his career in the Burmese
Imperial Police out of disgust for all forms of bullying and
oppression. This experience marked his political awakening: "I wanted
to submerge myself, to get right down among the oppressed, to be one
of them and on their side against their tyrants."</TE>
<TE>   It also set the pattern for his later political attitudes: though
his rejection of imperialism and colonialism remained final and
uncompromising, he was not blind to the complexity of their human and
cultural dimensions. Witness, for instance, the rich ambivalence of
his appraisal of Rudyard Kipling: "I worshipped Kipling at thirteen,
loathed him at seventeen, enjoyed him at twenty, despised him at
twenty-five, and now [in 1936, at the time of Kipling's death] again
rather admire him"--and he admired him for his "personal decency" and
for his "sense of responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   When fighting against fascism, he retained this awareness of human
ambiguity that cannot be reduced to ideological cliches. Jack London
fascinated him ("Iron Heel," which Orwell first read when he was 15,
left a deep impression on his mind and, 30 years later, was to become
a seminal influence upon the conception of "Nineteen Eighty-four"),
but he also detected in London a strong fascistic streak.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the war (1941), in a review of H.G. Wells, an author he
considered "too sane to understand the modern world," he invoked
again, in contrast, the prescient intuition of "Iron Heel" ("a crude
book" that is also "a truer prophecy of the future") and, as a
corrective to Wells' myopic sanity, he again referred to Kipling, who
was "only half-civilized" but, "not being deaf to the evil voices of
power and military 'glory,' would have understood the appeal of
Hitler, or for that matter, of Stalin." Orwell was not blind to the
flaws of figures such as London and Kipling, but he also saw that
these very flaws afforded them "the power to grasp what kind of world
we are living in."</TE>
<TE>   Human reality always transcends ideology. This perception is the
key to Orwell's integrity and originality, and it never left him,
even in the heat of battle, as was well-illustrated in a memorable
vignette from the Spanish front. One morning, as he went "to snipe at
the Fascists in the trenches outside Huesca... a man jumped out of
the trench and ran along the top of the parapet, in full view. He was
half-dressed and was holding up his trousers with both hands as he
ran. I refrained from shooting at him ... partly because of that
detail about his trousers. I had come to shoot at 'Fascists,' but a
man who is holding his trousers isn't a 'Fascist,' he is visibly a
fellow creature, similar to yourself, and you don't feel like
shooting him."</TE>
<TE>   The pages Hitchens devotes to "Orwell and the Left" represent, I
think, the most important chapter in his book. His inquiry into the
poisonous hatreds that the memory of Orwell continues to arouse among
the bien-pensants led him to unearth some very odd writings by (among
others) Salman Rushdie and Edward Said. A century ago, Charles Peguy
wondered what cowardly actions intellectuals would not be ready to
commit out of fear of appearing insufficiently left-leaning. This
observation is even more relevant today, and in its light, I guess
Hitchens ought to be congratulated for his courage.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, he dealt rather gently with "dear Salman," but the fact
remains: he dared to quote him and Said at great length--and one
could not conceive of crueler treatment: Rushdie and Said stand in
front of us, pilloried by their own prose. There is no space here to
reproduce Hitchens' lethal selection: readers should refer directly
to his book. Suffice it to say, Rushdie criticized Orwell for his
"quietism"; he found him guilty of following "an intrinsically
conservative option," advocating "a passivity which serves the
interests of the status quo, of the people already at the top of the
heap"; and he accused "Nineteen Eighty-four" of promoting "ideas that
can only be of service to our masters."</TE>
<TE>   As everyone knows, Orwell risked his life for his ideas. He was
grievously wounded by the fascists on the Spanish front and then
narrowly escaped assassination by Stalinist thugs; he always lived
off his pen, chained to the drudgery of freelance journalism in a
state of permanent material insecurity. Yet Said's criticism is even
more outlandish than Rushdie's. According to him, Orwell merely
"observed" politics from the safe and cozy distance of a life spent
in bourgeois comfort! And this reproach comes from a tenured American
professor: Mt. Everest might as well begrudge a molehill its impudent
height.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it is justified, the credit enjoyed by Rushdie and Said is
real enough; in compiling this amazing betisier, Hitchens
accomplished a much-needed and salubrious task. His debunking of
Claude Simon and of "post-modernist" critics, however, seems a waste
of time and energy. As the Chinese proverb--invented by Jacques
Maritain--says: "Never take stupidity too much in earnest." (With the
exception of three American scholars and seven Swedish academicians,
who ever read Simon? In 1985, shortly before Simon received the Nobel
Prize for literature, the French government, in a dastardly episode,
sent its goons to sink the Rainbow Warrior in the port of Auckland.
At the time, commenting on Simon's award, a perceptive French
literary critic wrote a piece that should remain the final word on
the subject: He expressed the suspicion that, in retaliation, New
Zealand had formed an axis with Sweden and just attempted to sink the
French novel.)</TE>
<TE>   Hitchens' chapter on "Orwell and America" reminds me of Samuel
Johnson, who once boasted that he could memorize one entire chapter
from "The Natural History of Iceland," titled "Concerning Snakes." It
went more or less like this: "There are no snakes in Iceland." Orwell
showed little interest in the U.S. and never visited the place. After
the war, as England was severely rationed, he tried to obtain from
America "a pair of shoes suitable for a large-footed man." Whether or
not this modest wish was granted is not known: It would have
constituted one of his more significant transatlantic contacts.</TE>
<TE>   On the subject of "Orwell and Englishness," Hitchens contributes
little that is new. At first, a parallelism with Philip Larkin seemed
a promising theme, but Hitchens backs away from it on what seems
irrelevant political grounds: "The whole repertoire of supposed
Englishness and sentiments is a poor guide for questions of
principle." Yet, precisely, Englishness is not a question of
principle and it has nothing to do with politics. The issue is
visceral; it is perhaps the only topic on which Orwell ever comes
close to waxing lyrical--or to displaying irrational feelings (such
as his dislike of all things Scottish or his effusive celebrations of
English cooking. Though he was not incapable of appreciating
Continental cuisine, that he should still praise kippers and puddings
seems to be pushing Englishness to the level of a willful
perversity.) I wish I had space to quote in full the pages of poetic
and emotional intensity in which he sang his love of England:</TE>
<TE>   "When you come back to England from any foreign country, you have
immediately the sensation of breathing a different air.... The beer
is bitterer, the coins are heavier, the grass is greener .... The
crowds in the big towns with their mild knobby faces, their bad teeth
and gentle manners are different from a European crowd. [Note that,
for Orwell, England is not in Europe.] Then the vastness of England
swallows you up.... And the diversity of it, the chaos! The clatter
of clogs in the Lancashire mill-towns, the to-and-fro of the lorries
on the Great North Road, the queues outside the Labour Exchanges, the
rattle of pintables in the Soho pubs, the old maids biking to Holy
Communion through the mists of the autumn morning ... , yes, there is
something distinctive and recognizable in English civilization.... It
is somehow bound up with solid breakfasts and gloomy Sundays, smoky
towns and winding roads, green fields and red pillar-boxes. It has a
flavour of its own. Moreover it is continuous, it stretches into the
future and the past, there is something in it that persists, as in a
living creature.... And above all it is your civilization, it is you.
However much you hate it or laugh at it, you will never be happy away
from it for any length of time. The suet puddings and the red
pillar-boxes have entered your soul. Good or evil, it is yours, you
belong to it, and this side of the grave you will never get away from
the marks it has given you."</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps if Hitchens fails to appreciate the depth and
significance of Orwell's Englishness, it is because he himself is an
Englishman. Fish are not in the best position to comment upon the
wetness of water. (By the way--this is an irrelevant aside--when
Hitchens mentions Jonathan Swift's Houyhnhnms, why does he
characterize them as "cynical and evil"? Then, would he also qualify
Yahoos as sweet and peace-loving creatures? I am puzzled. Perhaps
there is here some second-degree irony that, in my lack of
sophistication, I remain incapable to "deconstruct.")</TE>
<TE>   "The List" is one of Hitchens' shortest chapters but, for it
alone, it would be worthwhile to buy his book. In a few incisive and
well-documented pages, Hitchens sets the record straight on an
ignoble episode which is still in all memories. In 1996, some
indecrottables Stalinists launched a rumor that quickly spread under
various versions and took root in international opinion. The object
of the operation was to slander Orwell's memory and destroy his moral
credibility by creating the impression that sensational new evidence
had surfaced revealing that Orwell, far from being a man of towering
integrity, was a stool-pigeon who, at the beginning of the Cold War,
supplied blacklists of Communists and fellow-travelers to the British
Secret Service.</TE>
<TE>   The impact of these "revelations" was stunning: As the Daily
Telegraph put it, "it was as if Winston Smith had willingly
cooperated with the Thought Police in 'Nineteen Eighty-four.' " The
calumny was too enormous; yet, for a while it succeeded because of
its very enormity. "Keep lying, always keep lying," Voltaire advised,
"in the end something will stick." Actually the "new evidence" was
not new. The "facts" had already been evoked--without provoking
scandal, for there was no cause for scandal--in Bernard Crick's
authoritative biography, published in 1990. There was no "blacklist,"
since no one's employment was ever at stake. The private information
that Orwell communicated to an old friend (employed in foreign
affairs) at her own request was as unimpeachable as any conscientious
and honest referee report.</TE>
<TE>   If Orwell's sober and accurate assessment of a series of fellow
intellectuals and writers can be deemed dishonorable, then, by the
same token, any scholar who, in the normal course of his duties,
comments honestly on the competence and suitability of potential
appointees to academic positions in his own discipline should be
considered guilty of much greater crimes.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that nearly half a century after his death Orwell should
again be the target of such vile attacks is a good measure of the
formidable menace which, beyond the grave, he still presents for his
cowardly enemies. Yet, as regards this particular maneuver, I think
that Hitchens has put paid to it once and for all.</TE>
<TE>   As Hitchens shows, the permanent relevance of Orwell rests on the
fact that he clear-sightedly identified the issues that mattered and
on each of them expressed independent, strong and sound views.
Furthermore, what added weight to his ideas was his admirable
capacity to vouch for them with his own life and actions.</TE>
<TE>   This being said, the last page of Hitchens' book leaves me
dumbfounded. He concludes by referring to W.H. Auden's famous verses
"In Memory of W.B. Yeats"--"Time that with this strange excuse /
Pardoned Kipling and his views, / And will pardon Paul Claudel /
Pardons him for writing well"--lines that can be aptly applied to
supreme artists who were also wretched individuals but inappropriate
twice over when speaking of Orwell. For which sins indeed should
Orwell be forgiven? And where does his art ever reach the sort of
sublimity for which, as Auden suggests, the great sinners of literary
history should be pardoned?</TE>
<TE>   In order to express his ideas, Orwell developed a writing style
that is supple, lucid and arresting, achieving the very perfection of
journalistic readability. Yet, if we read him today, it is not for
the aesthetic enjoyment of his style but for the tonic quality of his
ideas.</TE>
<TE>   The jarring note of Hitchens' disconcerting conclusion is all the
more surprising because he obviously knows and loves his subject. The
American edition of his book carries a title which, in its
straightforward simplicity, is in harmony with Orwell's spirit. The
original English edition, on the contrary, was awkwardly entitled
"Orwell's Victory." In fact, the name Orwell and the word "victory"
were once before joined in a title, but it was to convey precisely
the opposite meaning. I refer to the moving memoir of Richard Rees,
"George Orwell, Fugitive From the Camp of Victory." Rees, who was one
of Orwell's few intimate friends, borrowed his superb title from
Simone Weil: "... If we know in what way society is unbalanced, we
must do what we can to add weight to the lighter scale and be ever
ready to change sides like justice, 'that fugitive from the camp of
victory.' "</TE>
<TE>   For Orwell, "misfit by conviction" (in the felicitous expression
of John Carey), victory--like success and power and authority--was
suspect by nature; he endorsed Arthur Koestler's view that "all
revolutions are failures." He believed that "men are only decent when
they are powerless"; he confessed "failure seemed to me the only
virtue--every suspicion of self-advancement, even to 'succeed' in
life to the extent of making a few hundreds a year seemed to me
spiritually ugly, a species of bullying," and again, "I never went
into a jail without feeling that my place was on the other side of
the bars."</TE>
<TE>   By any stretch of the imagination, I cannot picture what a
triumphant Orwell should look like. Had he lived, could fame--and
wealth--ever have altered him? One may doubt it. Shortly before his
death, when it became obvious that "Nineteen Eighty-four" would
become a major bestseller (a new experience for Orwell), he indulged
for once in a luxury purchase; he never had the chance to make use of
it, but it still provides us a valuable clue on how success might
have affected his life: he bought a good fishing rod.</TE>

<HD>The Perils of Pauline</HD>
<DH>AFTERGLOW: A Last Conversation With Pauline Kael, By
Francis Davis, Da Capo: 134 pp., $18</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSIE LINFIELD</AU>
<BD>Susie Linfield teaches in the Cultural Reporting and
Criticism program at New York University and is a contributing writer
to Book World. She is writing an intellectual biography of Pauline
Kael.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jazz critic Francis Davis spent two days interviewing Pauline Kael at
her home in the Berkshires in July 2000; she would die of
Parkinson's, at age 82, on Labor Day of the following summer.
"Afterglow" thereby bills itself as her "last conversation." Though
Kael's characteristic tart wit and lapidary intelligence light up
this slim volume, it is essentially a sad document. Not because Kael
was in decline, or backtracking from her most provocative
ideas--quite the contrary. But here is a chance to listen in on one
of the greatest critics (and writers) of the 20th century, a woman
who challenged us to rethink our responses to, and ideas about,
movies in particular and American culture in general. Yet what Davis
gives us, for the most part, is not an exploration of those ideas but
100-odd pages of sycophantic chitchat about favorite television shows
and movie stars. The schmaltzy title of this book (so at odds with
Kael's insistent anti-sentimentality) could be replaced with
"Wasted."</LD>
<TE>   This missed opportunity is especially too bad because Kael's key
ideas have seeped into the culture--and into the writing of far too
many critics--in vastly simplified if not deformed ways. Like those
who lazily, mistakenly claim that Marx was interested only in
economics and Freud only in sex, a vulgar Kaelism--which posits that
trash and art are synonymous, and that any film enjoyed by large
numbers of people must be a work of meaning--underlies much of what
passes for criticism today.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, film is  a mass art form, and it's true that Kael, like
her predecessors Gilbert Seldes and James Agee, loathed the
pretensions of middlebrow culture and dug the spunky, demotic aspect
of American life and culture. But she never mistook trash for art;
never thought it elitist (or unimportant) to distinguish the two;
never put forth that there was any connection, organic or otherwise,
between the widely accepted and the good. Kael believed that every
moviegoer could develop an aesthetic--but not that one necessarily
would, just as she believed that a talented filmmaker could use
lowbrow forms to create art, but not that the ability to master such
forms could ever make one an artist. In short, she was a democrat but
not a populist.</TE>
<TE>   It has also been all too easy to mistake Kael's hatred of
moralistic movies for moral relativism. Kael, like Agee, despised
films that were sanctimonious, respectable or self-righteous. But
this doesn't mean she was immune to questions of value, nor that she
adhered to the odd notion that if it makes you feel good, it is good.
(She was often most suspicious of precisely those films that made
audiences feel good, and wondered why they did and at what cost.) No
one who has read, say, Kael's paean to "Shoeshine," one of the great
humanist works of the 20th century--or, alternately, her fierce
denunciation of the exultant sexual sadism in Sam Peckinpah's "Straw
Dogs"--can doubt her moral seriousness. Her criticism--admittedly
often vitriolic--of uplift films was evidence not of moral obtuseness
but of her ethical spine. She regarded "virtuous" films as too easy,
too smug, too evasive, as instruments with which audiences could
flatter themselves about their unerringly good intentions and
unquestionable moral superiority.</TE>
<TE>   In short, she regarded such films as advertisements for ourselves,
and she regarded them as sleep-inducing lies. What she sought instead
were movies that revealed some truth (whether large or small, tragic
or hilarious) about us: as lovers and spouses, children and parents,
citizens, Americans, modern men and women. It was authenticity, not
sincerity, that interested Kael.</TE>
<TE>   Glimpses of all this appear in "Afterglow." Kael reiterates her
antipathy to "Schindler's List" and, more controversially, "Shoah."
Her views on violence remain nuanced, focusing on the what-for rather
than the how-much: Thus she denounces "The Silence of the Lambs" as
"hideous" while the almost unbearably brutal "Casualties of War"
remains, in her view, a "beautifully felt" work akin to "Grand
Illusion." "Afterglow's" flaw is that these nuggets remain just that,
unexamined and undeveloped by Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Kael also approaches the high/low question in her
characteristically textured way: "One of the great things about
movies is they can combine the energy of a popular art with the
possibilities of a high art," she says. "What's wonderful about
someone like Altman is that mixture of pop and high art. He's an
artist who uses pop as his vehicle. That's part of the excitement in
a movie like 'Nashville' ...Godard's 'Weekend' is another case in
point." Here, in a nutshell, is one of Kael's key critical insights,
one that underlies so much of what she wrote and admired and wanted
other people to see and grasp and debate. Again, though, rather than
follow up on this--and what an interesting, though perhaps less
glowy, last conversation that would have been--Davis inexplicably
asks about Kael's writing schedule at the New Yorker.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, a fascination with the inner workings of that magazine
pervades "Afterglow." We learn that Kael was shocked by fellow critic
Renata Adler's vicious attack (published in the New York Review of
Books), that the piece was a "group effort" of (unnamed) New Yorker
writers, that editor William Shawn was "devious" and that he regarded
Kael as a "barbarian." (For those truly obsessive fans of the
magazine, "Afterglow" even offers tidbits about its fact-checking
techniques.)</TE>
<TE>   Yet there is something not quite right, indeed uncomfortably
self-serving, about Kael's descriptions of the New Yorker and her
role in it. Kael paints Shawn as a sort of prudish commissar, a man
of "dowdy" attitudes who attempted to impose "pristine" language on
his writers--or, even worse, tried to make them impose it on
themselves. This was undoubtedly true in some senses and some cases.
But the magazine was also home to some of the most incisive,
challenging critics in the country--actually, the world--including
Kael's contemporaries Kenneth Tynan, Calvin Tomkins and Arlene Croce.
These writers are about as un-dowdy as they come.</TE>
<TE>   How, if at all, did their ideas influence Kael? Was she really the
courageously lone voice in the wilderness she makes herself out to
be? Is there no cultural or critical tradition she could place
herself within? Kael's self-presentation as the Bad Girl of American
Criticism is, like most self-presentations, glaringly incomplete;
it's a shame that Davis didn't challenge her on it.</TE>
<TE>   On the simplest and most important level of language, Kael is an
interviewer's dream: one of those rare people who speaks almost as
beautifully as she writes. Her evocative phrases spin out, abundantly
and spontaneously: "impertinent snip," "poisonously crude,"
"frivolous and negligible." She is witty, too, as when she describes
the New Yorker's aging readership under the Shawn regime as "dying
off faster than Sol Hurok's customers."</TE>
<TE>   So the tepidness of "Afterglow" is due not to its subject but
rather only to its author, who explains that he considered himself
Kael's "sounding board." Admittedly, not every interviewer can (or
need) be a combative Oriana Fallaci, but couldn't Davis have pushed
just a little? His passivity--and his dreadful need for Kael to like
him--prove fatal. He flatters her often--something she does not
resist--creating a dynamic that is embarrassing to them both. Worst
of all, he seems afraid of Kael. This is neither a crime nor a
surprise--indeed, who wouldn't have been?--but he should never have
let it show.</TE>
<TE>   Kael grappled with the movies, and with what they mean for us, in
a way that no writer has before or since. She believed that the late
1960s and the '70s--the era of Altman, Scorsese, Spielberg, Truffaut,
Godard, Coppola, De Palma, Bertolucci--had ushered in a new age of
intelligent, risky, challenging films that might change the way you
viewed the world or even lived in it. She believed that filmmakers
would continue making such films, and that audiences would continue
supporting them, and that a wonderfully fertile artist-viewer
dialectic would thereby be created. She believed, too, that our war
films might become anti-war films and that film violence might--as
she poignantly wrote in her controversial defense of "Bonnie and
Clyde"--"so sensitize us that we get a pang in the gut if we
accidentally step on a moth."</TE>
<TE>   She believed all this, she staked her life on it, and she was
wrong. The filmmakers changed, gravitating toward safe little movies
or sensational blockbusters, or losing their gifts and their nerve,
or finding themselves unable to obtain financing; the audiences
changed, seeking safety or escapism or mindless special effects; the
violence increased to horrific, soul-numbing levels that evoked
ecstasy rather than revulsion.</TE>
<TE>   Kael loved the movies, and they broke her heart (though not, it's
clear from "Afterglow," her spirit). "It's difficult to be a critic
of mass culture," she tells Davis. "You write about so much crap that
you begin to be contemptuous of what you're writing about." Later,
she adds that "if you write critically, you have to do something
besides get excited. You have to examine what's in front of you. What
you see is a movie industry in decay, and the decay gets worse and
worse." Yet she remains wonderfully devoid of bitterness and can even
find humor in her defeat: "It's not fun writing about bad movies. I
used to think it was bad for my skin." (Her writing, however, always
suggested that it was in fact fun.)</TE>
<TE>   Is the trajectory Kael describes--her own, and that of American
movies--an inevitable one? If so, what does that mean for the hope
that we Americans can create an inclusive, democratic culture that is
also one of distinction and quality, and that can challenge our
intelligence rather than cater to our prejudices? Must this utopian
vision, like so many others, be renounced? Or could it be revived?
What would that take? Kael is gone, but the questions remain; she
cannot answer them, but we will have to.</TE>

<DH>THE BLANK SLATE: The Modern Denial of Human Nature, By
Steven Pinker, Viking: 510 pp., $27.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FREDERIC RAPHAEL</AU>
<BD>Frederic Raphael has written widely on philosophy. His
most recent book is "Personal Terms," edited notebooks, 1950-69.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Philosophy," Ludwig Wittgenstein once said, "leaves everything as it
is." It was not his wisest remark. Man has always been eager for--and
is often alarmed by--new theories about the world: why and how it
came to be and where it is going. Philosophers--from Democritus
through Plato to Marx and Nietzsche--have rarely left things as they
were. Marx, for instance, alleged that previous philosophers had only
described the world; his mission was to change it. In fact, earlier
philosophers had, in various ways, shaped the world he now proposed
to revolutionize.</LD>
<LD>   Would Marx ever have believed that mankind was ripe for radical
remodeling if John Locke, two centuries earlier, had not maintained,
with liberating plausibility, that men are born with minds like blank
slates? Experience alone, Locke insisted, loads them with the
information from which they later compose images of reality. A
consequence of the blank slate was that there could be no inherited
nobility. How could one newborn blank reasonably claim to be innately
better than another?</LD>
<TE>   Locke came at the right moment for democracy. His views emboldened
America's Founding Fathers when it came to "self-evident" truths. He
seemed to promise that everyone began life at the same starting line.
Although challenged in detail, his empiricism appeared, for many
decades, both common-sensical and scientific. It may still appear the
first; it is not the second. Science and common sense seldom tell the
same story.</TE>
<TE>   Genetics has now established what Locke's contemporary, Gottfried
Leibniz, had immediately suspected: Men's and women's (and animals')
minds are elaborately "wired" long before they are born. And some
have capacities that others do not. In their "selfishness," genes do
not invest in level playing fields or universal human rights. Justice
and fairness may be desirable; they are not natural.</TE>
<TE>   If the theory of the blank slate is no longer tenable, must
democratic theory collapse with it? Fortunately, and unarguably,
there is no logical connection between how the world is and what
values man chooses to impose on it and on himself. The only link
between ethics and facts is that "ought entails can": We should not
require of ourselves, or others, what it is beyond human capacity to
achieve. It is not within our power, for instance, to be identical to
our neighbors, neither more intelligent nor more comely; not even if
our neighbor is our clone. Absolute equality is contrary to human
nature. Why would anyone have to watch his back when saying something
so matter-of-fact?</TE>
<TE>   Steven Pinker, best-selling author of "The Language Instinct" and
"How the Mind Works," has written a big book, "The Blank Slate," that
is built like a bouncer, and it needs to be. "Human nature is human
nature" is not the kind of tautology some people are willing to take
lying down. For ideological reasons, clever people can still deny
that their brains--but not their eventual contents or use--are shaped
by their parents' genes. The unreasonable fear is that to concede
unwanted truths will leave mankind with no logical resistance to
fascism, capitalism, racism, religious obscurantism, male dominance
and the rest. If Locke's theory generated democracy, how can
rejecting it not rehabilitate tyranny? Part of Pinker's mission is to
repeat that there is no inescapable correlation between facts and
human value systems, good or bad.</TE>
<TE>   Darwin's theory of natural selection was, in important ways,
irrefutably right. Yet its perversion, so-called social Darwinism,
did not follow logically from it. Natural selection--which involved
what Richard Dawkins called, metaphorically, the "selfish gene"--is
not a warrant for genocide nor even for human selfishness (altruism,
like love, can be good for the future of you and your genes).
Opposition to genocide in no way requires us to deny undeniable
evidence for natural selection or for genetically programmed variety.</TE>
<TE>   The use of new knowledge to challenge false theories (which are
incompatible with it) is what many of us call intellectual progress.
Communism depends on the idea that man is infinitely malleable ("The
working classes are to Lenin what minerals are to the metallurgist,"
said Maxim Gorky, toady-in-chief to the Bolsheviks). If, therefore,
it can be shown that men are not pieces of elemental putty ready to
be molded by Those Who Know, communism cannot be--as dialectical
materialism asserted--an inevitable result of the scheme of things.</TE>
<TE>   Yet despite the Gulag, the Khmer Rouge and Mao Tse-tung's
murderous legacy, today's academia remains infatuated with Marxism.
Many ranking scientists--Pinker's hit-list is starry with well-known
names--refuse to extricate themselves from their implacable
mind-sets. "Fascist" is their yelping Pavlovian response to facts
that challenge their fantasies. Yet the same men and women deride the
Nazis' idiotic denunciation of the theory of relativity as "Jewish
science." Pinker would like to have them recognize that "the problem
is not with the possibility that people might differ from each other,
which is a factual question that could turn one way or the other. The
problem is with the line of reasoning that says that if people do
turn out to be different, then discrimination, oppression or genocide
would be OK."</TE>
<TE>   The right can be as every bit as mutton-headed as the left. The
"religious right," which has corralled President George W. Bush into
its pious camp, opposes the use of 5-day-old human embryos in medical
research. Why? Because it believes in "ensoulment" at the moment of
conception. Belief passes itself off, in modern rhetoric, as an
ultra-sincere form of knowledge. In a democracy, aren't we all
entitled to our beliefs and our opinions? Of course. And only a
crackpot believes that that makes them all equally valid or worthy of
respect. The most sincere politician of the last century was Adolf
Hitler.</TE>
<TE>   Pinker's retort to the card-carrying pro-lifer is unequivocal and
very pro-life: "I see no dignity in letting people die of hepatitis
or be ravaged by Parkinson's disease when a cure may lie in research
on stem-cells that religious movements seek to ban because it uses
balls of cells that have made the 'ontological' leap to 'spiritual
souls.' Sources of immense misery ... will be alleviated not by
treating thought and emotion as manifestations of an immaterial soul,
but by treating them as manifestations of physiology and genetics."</TE>
<TE>   Not exactly catchy prose, I grant, but elsewhere Pinker can be
both terse and witty. And when he comes to the point, he knows how to
drive it home. He asks what mainstream politician would dare to
challenge so-called Judeo-Christian religious theory when 76% of
Americans believe (so polls promise) in the biblical account of
creation and the same proportion in angels, the devil and other
immaterial souls.</TE>
<TE>   The sorry truth is that "most academics, journalists, social
analysts and other intellectually engaged people" hide their genuine
opinions because they are cowards and careerists. Christianity has,
in truth, been a lot less unanimous in its moral stance than official
dogma would have us believe. One of the president's men should check
out what bishop Julian of Eclanum wrote, in the 5th century, to that
coercive centralizer, the great St. Augustine, about that dignitary's
lack of common humanity and civilized standards.</TE>
<TE>   Pinker presents an unanswerable case for accepting that man can
be, as he is, both wired and free. Genes do not determine how we use
our minds, only the kinds of minds we have. No one has to propagate
fairy tales in order to justify a better world. Ashley Montagu's
UNESCO resolution, stating that biology supports an ethic of
"universal brotherhood" is as baseless as Jean Jacques Rousseau's
myth of the noble savage. Man is good and bad; man is loving and
savage; man is thoughtful and impulsive. The ingredients vary with
genetic inheritance. Too bad if that doesn't suit left- or right-wing
Utopians, but the good news is that man is unrivaled in ingenuity and
in ability to learn and adapt. An individual mind can be closed (or
held shut); the book of knowledge, and hence society itself, can
never be.</TE>
<TE>   Is the "soul," or what philosopher Gilbert Ryle called "the ghost
in the machine," a plausible or a necessary adjunct to our idea of
humanity? As for religion, its alleged guarantor, why does a hard
head such as Irving Kristol insist that "no community can survive if
it is persuaded--or even suspects--that its members are leading
meaningless lives in a meaningless universe"? Even if the universe
has no "meaning" (whatever that might mean), must it follow that
human life is meaningless? The values that civilized men attach to
life, and to one another, give it, and us, meaning.</TE>
<TE>   Pinker bites off a lot, and some of it is, to put it mildly, more
swallowed than chewed. If he is excellent on genetically modified
foods and the fatuous phobias they excite (the president of Zambia
would sooner his people starve than eat such foods), he might have
spared us his Panglossian assessment of the arts, in which he quotes
a ragbag of sources, such as George Bernard Shaw, with callow
deference. Nor is he wholly right about the universal aversion to
incest: It was a royal privilege in ancient Egypt and widely
practiced by Greek tyrants (having come to power, they wanted to keep
it in the family).</TE>
<TE>   More important, and much more unwise, he waxes dogmatic about
educational curricula. He recommends that the study of "economics,
evolutionary biology and probability and statistics" replace that of
"the classics or foreign languages" in high schools and colleges. As
bridge players say, "Alert!" Americans (and the English) are already
fortified in their vanity by ignorance of foreign languages. The
despised classics, and the disinterested intelligence which should
derive from them, foster nonutilitarian values (which is what some
vital values have to be). How many squads of statisticians do we
need?</TE>
<TE>   What we certainly need are critics--as Pinker himself is--of
reckless conclusions drawn from statistics, or from anything else.
Such characters used to be the fruit of what was known as the
humanities. And "The Blank Slate"--at once tolerant and polemic,
uncompromising and open-minded--offers a notable and instructive
contribution to them. As a brightly lighted path between what we
would like to believe and what we need to know, it is required
reading.</TE>

<LD>TORREGRECA</LD>
<LD>   Life, Death, and Miracles in</LD>
<LD>   a Southern Italian Village</LD>
<TE>   By Ann Cornelisen,</TE>
<TE>   Foreword by Frances Mayes</TE>
<TE>   Steerforth: 295 pp., $16</TE>
<TE>   "I must be honest: They fascinated me," Ann Cornelisen confesses
in this account, first written in 1969, of the Torregresi. Cornelisen
first went to Italy in 1954 to study archeology, but her mission in
Torregreca was to help the town build and run a nursery for its
children. Within the first day, she had met the "pezzi grossi," the
10% of the population that controlled the other 90%.</TE>
<TE>   Not only had she met them, but she'd heard more than a few of
their life stories. "I was that unique person: I could not hurt them,
would not judge them, no matter what they told me. I listened through
the smoky gloom of three winters." At first, she was given a room at
the local convent, until word got out she was Protestant. "Then the
witch hunt was on," she writes. The nuns lined up across the table
"like crows on a fence."</TE>
<TE>   There is more humor than frustration in subsequent conflicts:
negotiations with a new landlord ("It was a play and she was
Bernhardt"); being attacked on the street by a mother and daughter
dressed in black who claim, falsely, that she has ruined the
reputation of their husband/father, the clerk "named Cupid who was
not only a devout Fascist but a hater of all foreigners."</TE>
<TE>   Cornelisen possesses a travel writer's finest qualities:
sturdiness, simple observation, humor and a touch of formality. With
these tools and with great warmth, she exposes the fine lines between
bureaucracy and community, between formality and friendship.</TE>

<TE>   TOURMALINE</TE>
<TE>   By Joanna Scott</TE>
<TE>   Little, Brown: 288 pp., $23.95</TE>
<TE>   Joanna Scott is one of today's best novelists, and she keeps
getting better. As a writer, she plays with traditional narrative
without being obscure or outrageous. Her details are placed in their
settings like gems in fine jewelry--each has several facets: the
beautiful, the dangerous, the ominous and the familiar.</TE>
<TE>   As an author, her plots are driven by important ideas (in
"Tourmaline," is it possible to ever understand our parents' lives?)
and always include a nod of respect to writers and books that have
helped inspire the novel--in this case, Tolstoy's "Anna Karenina" and
Hawthorne's character "Miriam" from "The Marble Faun." But you never
feel lost--as in, who is speaking here?--because she defines her
characters subtly but unforgettably.</TE>
<TE>   This is the story of a family that flees financial ruin by leaving
the United States for the island of Napoleon's exile: Elba. The
father, Murray, is charming and hopeless; the mother, Claire, is
constant but passionately in love with her husband; the four brothers
are as wild and independent as the children in Virginia Woolf's "The
Waves." They occupy their own world, parallel to the mysterious world
of their parents. "They could have their real world. We didn't want
it. A world worth only the value of its resale, a world without
magic."</TE>
<TE>   Murray has an affair and is accused of killing a local girl. The
entire island turns against him. Events swirl in the minds and
memories of the boys. Claire struggles 43 years later to explain what
happened to Ollie, one of her sons. "The soft breeze of the sirocco.
The rustle of palm fronds. Piping of a nightingale. Two girls riding
bareback on the same brown horse." If that doesn't transport you, try
this: "The soapstone is soft as goose down. Obsidian tastes of
licorice. Wells are lined with melted gold.... Catch a falling star
and it will turn to blue tourmaline in your hands. This is true."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE FLAMBOYANT</TE>
<TE>   By Lori Marie Carlson</TE>
<TE>   HarperCollins: 241 pp., $24.95</TE>
<TE>   Isn't it odd how words are emptied of meaning by overuse, like an
old sponge or a bar of soap? This otherwise delightful novel is
plagued by cliches like "passionate kiss," "meticulous charm,"
"sumptuous breakfast," "sheltered harbor" and he "stepped into her
life." The descriptions bear too much of the novel's weight. For
example: "Basilio Portelli, a conservative Spaniard who had lost his
wife to influenza when Ignacio had been an infant."</TE>
<TE>   Still, it has an interesting plot: the fictional adaptation of the
life of Lenora Demarest, the 200th licensed aviatrix in the United
States, the first in Puerto Rico, friend of Amelia Earhart's and a
search-and-rescue pilot in World War II. Lenora moves with her father
to 1,600 acres in Puerto Rico in 1917 at age 16. On the journey
there, she falls in love with pilot George Hanson, who teaches her to
fly. There is a fascinating subplot involving jewels Lenora studies
as a hobby, but it is only incidentally woven into the story.
Strangely, "The Flamboyant" is like an attractive acquaintance you
never really get to know--who remains too shy and formal to engage.</TE>

<HD>The Sadly Neglected and Wholly Original Henry Cowell</HD>
<DH>ESSENTIAL COWELL: Selected Writings on Music, By Henry
Cowell, Edited by Dick Higgins, McPherson &amp; Co.: 342 pp., $35</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NED ROREM</AU>
<BD>Ned Rorem is a Pulitzer Prize-winning composer and the
author of 15 books (diaries and essays). He is president of the
American Academy of Arts and Letters.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Cage, like Jean Cocteau or Jesus Christ, has a name our world
knows; yet he might have remained unknown were it not for the
now-unknown composer Henry Cowell. Indeed, Cowell's pupils--Cage and
Lou Harrison, George Gershwin and Burt Bacharach--have tended to
outlive him, like so many of his more flamboyant colleagues (Carl
Ruggles, Harry Partch, Edgar Varese, Ruth Crawford Seeger, George
Antheil, Joseph Schillinger), partly because of his publicizing them.
Now comes "Essential Cowell" to reinforce that notion. In 48 prose
pieces, he discusses the music of almost everyone but himself--and of
himself there is no value judgment, only technical explication.</LD>
<LD>   But that accords with my own memories of him. I met Henry Cowell
twice, both times at Virgil Thomson's in the early 1960s when the
three of us, plus Vladimir Ussachevsky, were plotting to revive
(unsuccessfully) the journal New Music Edition. In the glare of
Virgil's rapid wit, Cowell struck me as self-effacing if willful,
without much glamour. Had he been dulled by four years in prison? (In
1936, he went to San Quentin on a morals charge after having sex with
a 17-year-old boy.) By his selfless efforts to support others? By
encroaching disease? I never saw him again. He died in 1965.</LD>
<TE>   Kyle Gann's preface to "Essential Cowell" in itself is a perfect
review. If he opens by declaring that "Henry Cowell was the one
composer who seems to have come out of nowhere" and then contradicts
this by saying that "Charles Ives used tone clusters years before
Cowell," one is merely reminded of what the novelist Raymond Radiguet
said about artistic originality: "A true artist is born with a unique
voice and cannot copy; so he has only to copy to prove his
originality."</TE>
<TE>   Gann briefly outlines Cowell's work and life, which began in 1897,
stressing the man's "utter refusal to be hemmed in by, or overly
impressed with, the past.... Like Cage, Cowell could say, 'I can't
understand why people are frightened by new ideas. I'm frightened of
the old ones.' " Indeed, today, we remain the sole era in history in
which the musical past takes precedence over the present--a performer
playing Mozart can earn in one evening what a living composer may
earn in five years.</TE>
<TE>   Cowell also composed some of his best pieces in the most difficult
of circumstances. At San Quentin, he claimed it was too noisy to
write original music and that jailers thought his scores were
"codes." But he did manage to organize an inmates' band and complete
one of his most ravishing pieces, the "United Quartet." In 1940,
thanks largely to a campaign by Sidney Robertson (whom in 1941 he
married), Cowell was released from his sentence into the custody of
Percy Grainger, his "musical secretary."</TE>
<TE>   Not all of Cowell's friends were sympathetic. Composer Charles
Ives (1874-1951) never quite forgave his younger colleague. Cowell,
meanwhile, promoted Ives' work as avidly as Mendelssohn promoted Bach
a century earlier, placing him forever on the international
map--another proof, if proof were needed, that great artists aren't
necessarily great human beings, while many saints are second-rate
artists. Art is unrelated to morality: It does not make us better, or
even change us; art makes us more into what we already are by
reminding us of all the things we know.</TE>
<TE>   It was the late Dick Higgins, poet and actor, who had sewn
together selections from Cowell's huge catalog of prose, some of it
mere wisps, some in-depth essays, all of it didactic and with little
style but rich in content. The best of Cowell's writings are from the
1930s, and are as much analyses as appreciations (for example, the
writings on Stravinsky and on Virgil Thomson, in which he extols
simplicity as radical).</TE>
<TE>   "Essential Cowell" is divided into seven sections, ranging over
his entire career, his encounters with other composers and countries.
He relates a trip to Moscow in 1931 and the unexpected things that
happen at concerts, partly due to unusual political situations. But
Cowell believes that "it is largely because of the vital part that
music plays in the lives of Russians. We here are apt to regard music
as a mere amusement. To the Russian, music is a deeply ingrained
necessity for the outpouring of his feelings." Higgins notes that
Cowell's expressed abhorrence of communism is a reflection of
McCarthyite hysteria still in the air when he penned "Music Is My
Weapon" in 1954.</TE>
<TE>   I resist Cowell's statements such as "I believe in music: its
spirituality, its ecstatic nobility ... its power to penetrate the
basic fineness of every human being." (What about the Nazis, who
played Beethoven quartets to drown out the screams of their victims?)
Or: "Unexpected inner response to the power of music dedicated to
human integrity might reach dictators more easily than an atom bomb."
This, from a man who was imprisoned for four years at San Quentin.</TE>
<TE>   Cowell discusses 18 contemporaries, from Ives to Sessions to
Bartok. Here we find rare traces of humor, as in his discussion of
musicologist Nicholas Slonimsky: "If you wish to be in a position to
converse freely ... at cocktail parties about sisquitone, quadritone,
quinquetone, and diatessaron scale progressions, or to engage in
profound discussion of, let us say, the sesquiquinquetone progression
of an equal division of eleven octaves into twelve parts, Slonimsky's
Thesaurus is an absolute must for your library."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the chapter on my beloved Lou Harrison is less on Lou
than on percussion. ("The full possibilities of percussion ... have
hardly been tapped in our symphonic literature.") As I grow older, I
use less percussion and feel almost morally against all drums; if I
never hear another cymbal crash it won't be too soon. Percussion is
inevitably used as reinforcement, for emphasis; non-pitched
percussion is seldom integral but decorative, like too much lipstick
or too many earrings.</TE>
<TE>   A section of the book entitled "Music of the World's Peoples" is
marvelously researched and related by one who's been there. Likewise,
in another section Cowell dissects three of his own works. Elsewhere
he tells us of collaborations with dancers, from Hanya Holm to Martha
Graham. In 1967, when Graham choreographed a work of mine, I could
only concur with Cowell that she won, hands down, not by dancing to
the sway but by going against the music; she made me hear myself as I
never had before.</TE>
<TE>   In a section on "Musical Craft," Cowell discusses the process of
so-called creation, the nature of melody, and the joys of noise,
presenting the liberation of dissonance: " ... a loud sound does not
touch our emotional depths if it does not rise to a dynamic climax."
What about Satie? Or Debussy's piano "Preludes"? The margins of my
copy are littered with approving asides or cranky wrist-slappings.
"How true!" I jot next to his "Meaning is imparted to melodies, very
often, through inflections similar to those in speech." Or I write
"Isn't it the reverse?" next to "Speech is given meaning by its tonal
inflections. Melody, in music, rests fundamentally on the same sorts
of inflections."</TE>
<TE>   Cowell also answers many a lay question: "The most perfect
instrument in the world is the composer's mind," he writes. "I rarely
change a note after a composition is written." But, he adds, " ...
only about ten percent of the musical idea can be realized even at
the best performance." That, of course, forces me to reply: "Maybe
closer to ninety percent." Et cetera.</TE>
<TE>   Cowell's own music, stripped of percussion and other "effects," is
far from forbidding. Listen, for instance, to the swooningly
contagious final Largo from "Four Combinations" (1921). It offers no
problem, beyond the one of dealing with sheer beauty. If the
theatrical suite "Atlantis," four years later, is a series of
trouvailles for human voices, those trouvailles are less formally
integral than an overlay of tricks (squeaks, grunts, wails) erupting
around and above quite diatonic music. The sum impression is madly
spooky, but impression it remains, not a new language like
Schoenberg's or even Partch's.</TE>
<TE>   Music was Cowell's whole life. If, with his wife, Sidney, he
covered 90,000 pages with words about music, he produced 100,000 with
music toute courte, including 20 symphonies. It is for the latter
that he doubtless will be judged by the future. For the present, I'm
inclined, with Wallace Stevens, to stress, "Not ideas about the thing
/ but the thing itself."</TE>

<LD>INNOCENTS</LD>
<LD>   By Cathy Coote</LD>
<LD>   Grove Press: 248 pp., $13 paper</LD>
<TE>   She's 16; he's her 34-year-old teacher. It's like that old Police
song, except that, unlike Sting, Cathy Coote, an Australian novelist
who wrote this book when she was all of 19, manages to avoid any
clunky allusions to Nabokov. And yet "Innocents" is really "Lolita"
turned upside down, where the obsessive Humbert Humbert is a nameless
schoolgirl who draws her own pornography, and whose fetish object is
her floppy English prof. "The simple act of breathing," she
confesses, "became charged with an unbearable eroticism."</TE>
<TE>   Appropriately enough, the erotic air of "Innocents" threatens to
become unbearable, as the forbidden couple's sex games grow
increasingly outre: Coote has nothing against cranking the
titillation level up to high and leaving it there. In this way, she
resembles her nymphomaniac narrator, who similarly never lets up
piling on cliche after cliche and scenario after scenario to keep her
lover's attention: "I choreographed myself.... I mixed utterly
contrived emotion in with the real ones.... It became my delicate
business to seem modest, good and vulnerable, while doing my best to
encourage your basest instincts." With adolescent zeal, she
micromanages their escapades, while he, helpless to resist, buys them
a house in another town.</TE>
<TE>   Is Coote suggesting, God forbid, that the grown-up is the innocent
in this lopsided pas de deux? Perhaps. But with her youthful
recklessness, Coote's turbocharged nymphet is, disturbingly, quite
innocent too. What's fascinating here, though, is how well
"Innocents," written by a teenager, portrays adult, innocence-ending
consequences.</TE>

<TE>   WILDERNESS RUN</TE>
<TE>   By Maria Hummel</TE>
<TE>   St. Martin's: 352 pp., $24.95</TE>
<TE>   "So many bullets were hitting the stream, it sounded like it was
boiling." Maria Hummel has a way with the stuff of battle, turning
the horrific sounds, sights and smells into evanescent moments of
exquisite lyricism.</TE>
<TE>   Set in the Civil War, "Wilderness Run" (the title refers,
ironically, to an idyllic Vermont stream, not the 1864 battle) is a
visceral re-creation of inept skirmishes, blood-soaked field
hospitals and dysentery-ridden convalescence camps. But it's also a
fascinating evocation of the home front, where Bel Lindsey, an
adolescent Vermont bluestocking amped up on abolitionist rhetoric,
writes dutiful letters to her beloved soldier cousin, Lawrence.
Hummel shows us how the war not only wreaks irrevocable changes upon
the nation, but also upon these precocious, devoted cousins too.</TE>
<TE>   Growing up on the shores of Lake Champlain, the conspiratorial duo
harbored an escaped slave together before the war. Now, on the front
lines, Lawrence struggles to maintain his zeal for abolition, Walt
Whitman and the Union, while Bel, living amid painted sleighs and
parlor dances, unearths a potentially incendiary family secret.</TE>
<TE>   These jolting shifts, from the roar of battle to the quiet
intrigues of home, are handled with remarkable ease. Writing of death
and drawing rooms with equal aplomb, Hummel has created an utterly
devourable historical novel.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q ROAD</TE>
<TE>   By Bonnie Jo Campbell</TE>
<TE>   Scribner: 276 pp., $24</TE>
<TE>   The Q Road of Bonnie Jo Campbell's gently comic novel about life
in rural Michigan is a country lane known by the self-deprecating
locals as Queer Road. The personages who live along Q Road, and their
doings, are indeed a bit odd. There's a paranoid lady named Elaine
who lives in a prefab house, reading the Weekly World News and gazing
out with dread at her various neighbors. There's teenage Rachel, part
Indian, who likes to cuss and brandish a rifle nearly as much as she
likes to grow squash. There's Steve Hoekstra, a window salesman who
views every woman as a potential conquest, and his wife, who
fantasizes about putting a butcher's knife into him.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's hard-working George Harland, who just might be
the queerest of them all: He's quixotically holding on to the
sprawling family farm, despite the encroachments of nearby housing
developments, his own middle age and a baffling May-December marriage
to Rachel.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell is also the author of a story collection called "Women
and Other Animals," which chronicled similar turf; as a first-time
novelist, she retains a short-story artist's sensibility, with mixed
results. The broad tableau of aluminum siding versus pig manure is
rendered here with delicate, exacting strokes. But despite the rich
detail and flickering epiphanies, this book frequently detours into
bite-size vignettes and dead-end tangents. Inexplicably averse to
narrative momentum, "Q Road" becomes, alas, a scenic byway that never
seems to lead anywhere.</TE>

<DH>THE AUTOGRAPH MAN: A Novel, By Zadie Smith, Random House:
352 pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WENDY SMITH</AU>
<BD>Wendy Smith is the author of "Real-Life Drama: The
Group Theatre and America, 1931-1940."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Zadie Smith stormed onto the publishing scene in 2000 with "White
Teeth," a burly first novel that embraced the 21st century with its
zesty portrait of ethnic, class and sexual conflicts in multicultural
London, taking side trips as far afield as Jamaica and Bangladesh.
It's a pleasure to report that her new book is just as stimulating.
"The Autograph Man" mingles such quintessentially contemporary themes
as our obsession with fame and the substitution of entertainment for
experience with time-honored subjects like the tangled bonds between
fathers and sons and the inevitability of death. All are considered
with the same bracing intelligence and salty humor that distinguished
her debut.</LD>
<LD>   The eponymous hero, Alex-Li Tandem, trades in "names on paper ...
a small blip in the desire network" whose threads entangle him over
the course of a week that takes him from a bad acid trip in London to
the Autographicana Fair in New York and home again with his very own
celebrity in tow.</LD>
<LD>   Smith has reined in the narrative sprawl that made "White Teeth"
exciting but occasionally exhausting; she gives Alex's story a
(slightly) more disciplined structure without renouncing the sweeping
authorial voice that energized her earlier work.</LD>
<TE>   Introducing Alex at age 12, the omniscient narrator informs us
that "he deals in a shorthand of experience. The TV version. He is
one of this generation who watch themselves." En route from his north
London neighborhood to a wrestling match, he is about to be
challenged by ugly reality, as Smith skillfully sets up the schism
that will define his young life.</TE>
<TE>   Alex's father is driving him and his Hebrew school friends, brash,
bullying Mark Rubenfine and assertively intellectual Adam Jacobs.
(Alex's father, Li-Jin Tandem, is Chinese, but his mother, Sarah, is
Jewish.) At the match, they meet delicate, fearful Joseph Klein, who
intensely describes his autograph collection. Fascinated by Joseph's
passion, Alex has discovered his third lifelong friend and his
vocation. Backstage, as he whips around to show his father the photo
that the winning wrestler has just signed, Li-Jin crumples to the
floor.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen years later, a week before the anniversary of his father's
death, Alex has little recollection of the previous 72 hours, though
he knows they included a visit to Adam's apartment, where he ingested
the "microdot," and a stoned drive ending with the wreck of his car
and minor injuries for his girlfriend Esther, Adam's sister. His
friends are convinced that unresolved grief fuels Alex's
self-destructive behavior and absurd dedication to what they consider
a trivial profession. (Joseph sells insurance, Mark is a rabbi, Adam
pursues God through the Torah and the Kabbalah.) They press him to
gather a group to say the kaddish mourning prayer for Li-Jin.</TE>
<TE>   Alex is more preoccupied with mysterious pieces of mail: two
autographs from Kitty Alexander, a Hollywood star he has been writing
to for 15 years without a reply. The Autographicana Fair provides an
excuse to track down Kitty in Brooklyn, even though it means he will
be away when Esther has an operation to replace her pacemaker. It's
Alex's heart that seems faulty as Smith chronicles his frequently
outrageous behavior on two continents, yet we can't help but like him
as he riffs sardonically on Allen Ginsberg ("I saw the best minds of
my generation accept jobs on the fringes of the entertainment
industry") or conquers his disgust at the physical manifestations of
mortality to visit a dying colleague in the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Tracing her hero's odyssey, Smith scatters marvelous sentences and
sharp insights on nearly every page, astutely placing many of them in
the mouths of her characters. "Be an American. Say what you mean,"
orders the hooker-turned-autograph-dealer Alex consorts with in New
York. "What's more important than a gesture?" asks Adam when Alex
confesses his doubts about the kaddish. Defending the insurance
industry, Joseph declares, "Part of the inevitable is the need for
compensation. It's a sin to get it, but an act of faith to want it."</TE>
<TE>   Like any good novelist, Smith uses action and dialogue to
illuminate her themes. She pulls them together in the lovely
climactic image: Alex attaches his father's signature in the honored
central spot of Adam's personal autograph collection, arranged on the
wall in the shape of a "Kabbalistic" diagram, "midway between--and
elevated above--the popular philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein and the
popular writer Virginia Woolf."</TE>
<TE>   "The Autograph Man" has faults, principally Smith's shallow
depiction of her characters' relationship to Judaism. It's meant to
be a major motif--telegraphed by the hilarious epigraph from the late
comedian Lenny Bruce--but feels more like a plot premise. We need to
see more of Esther, in particular, to understand Alex's attachment to
her. His mother's absence after the prologue is less surprising: This
is a young person's book (Smith is 27), in which friends are
all-important and omnipresent; parents loom large but are safely
offstage or dead. Still, it's jarring when Sarah turns up at the
kaddish ceremony, which serves as a slightly disappointing finale.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that Smith's reach sometimes exceeds her grasp indicates
how bold that reach is. She tackles big subjects, and her talent is
very nearly equal to her ambitions.</TE>

<DH>INSURGENT MUSE: Life and Art at the Woman's Building, By
Terry Wolverton, City Lights Books: 244 pp., $17.95 paper EL PUEBLO:
The Historic Heart of Los Angeles, By Jean Bruce Poole and Tevvy
Ball, Getty Conservation Institute/ J. Paul Getty Museum: 132 pp.,

<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN KIRSCH</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Kirsch, a contributing writer to the Book
Review, is the author of "The Woman Who Laughed at God: The Untold
History of the Jewish People."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An unremarkable three-story brick building sits on North Spring
Street in downtown Los Angeles, hard by the concrete channel of the
Los Angeles River and the railroad yards behind Union Station. The
unwelcoming industrial district was called "Dog Town" by local gangs
because an animal shelter was once located there. But, for 16 years,
the structure served as the site of the Woman's Building and,
therefore, as ground zero in the feminist art movement.</LD>
<LD>   "For years this obscure section of decrepit streets and aging
structures was the starred capital on my personal map of Los
Angeles," writes Terry Wolverton in "Insurgent Muse." "The Woman's
Building provided a community in which a woman was encouraged not
only to speak, but to find her authentic voice and cultivate an
audience eager to hear it."</LD>
<LD>   The tale that Wolverton tells in "Insurgent Muse," which is both a
work of history and a heartfelt memoir, begins in the roiling 1970s.
Set free and afire by the counterculture and the civil rights
movement, women were beginning to make new demands on themselves and
the world around them.</LD>
<TE>   Artist Judy Chicago, graphic designer Sheila Levrant de
Bretteville and art historian Arlene Raven provided a focal point for
the energies of what Wolverton calls "Second Wave feminism," when
they opened the women's art center that they called the Woman's
Building.</TE>
<TE>   "[The center] was a collision of history and politics and art,"
explains Wolverton. "It was poetry, painting, performance. It was the
dope you smoked on the fire escape, the Friday nights you stayed late
trying to figure out how to pay the bills. It was the first book you
self-published on the antique printing press; it was the
consciousness-raising group you hated."</TE>
<TE>   Three galleries were devoted to artwork by women, and three
women's theater companies staged their productions in the auditorium.
A coffeehouse, a thrift shop, a feminist travel agency, an office of
the National Organization for Women and the late, lamented Sisterhood
Bookstore were all housed there.</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of the Woman's Building was the Feminist Studio
Workshop, founded by Chicago, De Bretteville and Raven as an
alternative to more conventional art-education programs such as the
one at the California Institute of the Arts, where all three had
served on the faculty.</TE>
<TE>   Wolverton--artist, poet, novelist, teacher and one of the enduring
literary lights of Los Angeles--was a participant in the events that
she describes in "Insurgent Muse." She started as a student in the
Feminist Studio Workshop, worked at the Woman's Building as
everything from a typesetter to a grant writer, and ultimately rose
to the position of executive director.</TE>
<TE>   She reveals much about herself and her journey to feminism,
including her experiences of childhood sexual abuse, several attempts
at suicide, her self-discovery and self-definition as a lesbian and
an artist and the rebirth that she experienced when she arrived in
Los Angeles as a refugee from the Midwest.</TE>
<TE>   "I was no different than many of the women who came to be part of
the Woman's Building, dragging lifetimes of damage like battered
suitcases: Our brothers who raped us, our rapes at the hands of
strangers, the strange voices in our heads, our heads full of secrets
and shame, our shameful women's lives," she writes.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Wolverton suggests that the Woman's Building is "a
seamless representation of women's place in culture." The building
like the women who flocked there, was an overlooked feature of the
landscape on the margins of a glittering metropolis.</TE>
<TE>   "It was anger at this circumstance that had struck the spark,
anger that had provided the fuel," explains Wolverton. "That, and the
ether of imagination."</TE>
<TE>   And yet, even though the Woman's Building closed its doors in
1991, Wolverton insists that nothing really ended: "Does the dream
expire when the alarm shrills," she asks, "or does it live on, unseen
in daylight?" As seen through Wolverton's eyes, so vividly and so
intimately, the Woman's Building was and is a source of redemption.</TE>
<TE>   "I never talk about a suicide 'attempt,' " she writes of her
wrist-slashings and overdoses. "Instead I say this: At the age of
twenty-one I committed suicide, that the effort was successful, that
a part of me was killed off and something else was reborn."</TE>
<TE>   Here we glimpse the immensity of what the Woman's Building
represents to Wolverton and so many women like her: "When people
wonder at the meaning the Woman's Building continues to have for me,
they must consider that my story there began with resurrection, and I
came to it mucky and tender and quivering as any newborn."</TE>
<TE>   Not far from the site of the Woman's Building is a more familiar
neighborhood whose real historic significance is often overlooked.
The tourist attraction that we know as Olvera Street, first developed
in the 1930s, is the place where the original pueblo of Los Angeles
was founded more than 200 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   In "El Pueblo," Jean Bruce Poole and Tevvy Ball allow us to see
the rich but often troubling history that lies beneath the quaint
brick pavement and the colorful stalls and shops.</TE>
<TE>   From its very beginnings in 1781, we are reminded, Los Angeles was
a multiracial and multicultural community, not to mention a flash
point of the sometimes bloody encounter between Manifest Destiny and
Mexican sovereignty.</TE>
<TE>   Pico Boulevard, for example, recalls Pio Pico, the last man to
serve as governor of California while it was still a province of
Mexico--and it was Pico's brother, Andres, who commanded a guerrilla
army in skirmishes with the U.S. cavalry dragoons who raised the
American flag over California.</TE>
<TE>   Significantly, the Pico brothers were among many prominent
citizens of the pueblo with a mixture of African, Indian and European
ancestry. The slum dwellers of Calle de los Negros ("Negro Alley")
also included Chinese, Mexicans, Indians, French and Anglos, a
volatile blend that exploded in the so-called Chinese Massacre of
1871--"one of the worst incidents of racial violence in Los Angeles
history," as the authors remind us in "El Pueblo."</TE>
<TE>   Like all of the publications of the Getty Museum, "El Pueblo" is
sumptuously and elegantly presented. The text is accompanied by some
160 paintings, photographs, drawings, posters, broadsheets and other
artifacts, all of them lushly reproduced and expertly annotated.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the most surprising and illuminating moments in "El
Pueblo" are found in the chapters that describe the making,
suppression and restoration of a controversial fresco featuring a
crucified Indian by the Mexican muralist David Alfaro Siqueiros,
titled "America Tropical," an episode that weaves the threads of Los
Angeles history, politics and culture into a single, striking
tapestry.</TE>

<DH>The Electric Prunes could've stayed happily disbanded, but
their fans had other things in mind</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB BAKER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 3 1/2 decades, the Electric Prunes, those kids from the Valley who
brought you the distortion-filled, neck-snapping,
what-the-heck-was-that? hit "I Had Too Much to Dream (Last Night),"
have advanced about 50 feet.</LD>
<LD>   Back in '66, when they were discovered, the Prunes practiced in
the garage of a home that bass player Mark Tulin shared with his
parents.</LD>
<LD>   These days, Tulin, 53, two other core members of the band and
three newer additions practice at the same house. But since Tulin's
parents are dead, the musicians get to blast away in the living room.</LD>
<TE>   For this, the Prunes are grateful. Enough aging, anonymity and
alienation will do that.</TE>
<TE>   Rock bands often splinter, wander in the desert for a while and
reunite. But the original Prunes took a 30-year exodus from
performing, walking away from their record company and largely from
one another in 1968. They took little pleasure in having made that
rare '60s record, so distinctive or odd that (like "Louie Louie" or
"Wild Thing" or "Dirty Water") it outlived the band and became part
of some listeners' DNA. Lead singer James Lowe was so disillusioned,
he would not even answer the questions of his own son, an aspiring
keyboard player.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, a few zealous fans, with some help from the Internet,
engineered a series of happy accidents that pushed the Prunes back
into one another's arms. Three years ago they resumed their
conversations, then gradually went back into the studio and last year
onto the stage, where they revel in playing the same raw, sonically
weird, psychedelic-tinged music.</TE>
<TE>   "The way we play is the way we played," says Lowe, 58, the band's
affable leader who recruited Tulin and guitarist Ken Williams when
the pair were seniors at Taft High School. "It's like dialing the
time machine back to 1967."</TE>
<TE>   The Prunes' expectations are charmingly modest. They hated the way
record companies force-fed them pop lyrics, arrangements and touring
schedules, so they're using the Internet to independently distribute
their 2001 album of mostly new material, recorded at Lowe's Santa
Ynez Valley home studio. They've played only three concerts so far
but head for a series of nine dates in Britain and Greece on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "When they play, man," says Steven Van Zandt, the longtime
guitarist of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band, "I swear to God
within 10 minutes you are transported."</TE>
<TE>   Van Zandt, who hosts a syndicated radio show dedicated to
garage-style rock, was so effusive about the Prunes' reunion that he
pressured the reluctant musicians to play last fall's Cavestomp
festival of veteran and young garage bands in New York, which he
co-produced. "No movie, no record can capture being in that room and
having them play."</TE>
<TE>   On a Saturday afternoon in Tulin's Woodland Hills home, the Prunes
crowd into the green-carpeted living room and fill it with distortion
and percussion that vibrates in a listener's gut. Lowe, his white
bangs hanging over his forehead the way they did in 1966 when they
were blond, shakes a pair of tambourines above his head without a
trace of self-consciousness as the band gleefully thunders through
"You Never Had It Better." It's one of the Prunes' favorites. It's
also one, as Lowe points out when the last note dies, that their
producers failed to put on any of their three albums.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the joy in this reunion is centered on finally regaining
control of the music. But it's also about a deeper awareness of
mortality.</TE>
<TE>   "After all the recent events [in the world], you look at your life
and say, 'I'd rather be doing what I wanna be doing when it all goes
down,' " says Lowe, a freelance television commercial producer.</TE>
<TE>   "I spent many years convincing myself I didn't need to play music,
that I could do something else," says Tulin, a former screenwriter
and psychologist who said he stopped working two years ago to
concentrate on music. "The lesson I got was, if it's your passion, do
it--you don't even have to be good at it.... It's about, if you're
loving what you're doing, do it."</TE>
<TE>   The bristling opening cut on "Artifact," their new album, grapples
with the struggle for redemption:</TE>
<TE>   I was lookin' at some photographs</TE>
<TE>   We looked the way we used to be</TE>
<TE>   I never dreamed they'd be my epitaph</TE>
<TE>   And I'd be drowning in a sea</TE>
<TE>   Of lost dream</TE>
<TE>   James Lowe had a boyhood friend whose father had a home recording
studio. Lowe was fascinated by the process. He was also fascinated by
surfing and guitars, but at 19 he married a girl he'd met while
attending Canoga Park High and they started a family. Lowe worked as
a nighttime aerospace X-ray technician, desperate to get out,
convinced that music was his only escape route. He hooked up with
Tulin and Williams and another young musician in 1965, and seven days
a week--after the boys got home from school and before Lowe went to
work--they practiced in the Tulin garage, concentrating on original
material.</TE>
<TE>   One day in 1966, a woman who was accompanying a real estate agent
down the street overheard Jim &amp; the Lords, as they billed themselves,
and told them she knew somebody in the business. The hackneyed
promise came true: She told Dave Hassinger, who was working as an
engineer on the Rolling Stones' new album but was eager to produce
his own band.</TE>
<TE>   Hassinger signed the Lords to a management contract and told them
they needed a new name. They chose the answer to one of those '60s
riddles ("What's purple and goes 'buzz'?"). Among the songs Hassinger
picked was a demo of "Too Much to Dream," written by a pair of pop
songwriters signed to his company. The band imbued it with Lowe's
petulant, dramatic vocal and an unusual feedback-infested,
backward-guitar sound.</TE>
<TE>   It happened partly as a fluke: Guitarist Williams was
experimentally recording distorted textures with his guitar's "wiggle
stick," and when an engineer accidentally played the reverse side of
a reel of tape, the bizarre noise thundered through the small home
recording studio Hassinger was using. Lowe said he kept the fragment
and made sure it was integrated it into several portions of the final
mix.</TE>
<TE>   The result--variously praised for its effect on punk, garage-band
and psychedelic music--was a song that got most of its attention for
the way it got your attention. The opening stanza, in which Lowe
recounts an erotic dream about an old girlfriend, is quickly
overwhelmed by a sound that builds until it feels like "the hum of a
thousand-pound bee crashing through your window and onto your
turntable," in the words of Richie Unterberger, author of a book
about overlooked innovators. Van Zandt calls it "one of the three or
four greatest records in history."</TE>
<TE>   It didn't work the way you thought it would</TE>
<TE>   You stole my passion and my name</TE>
<TE>   You two-faced mother with your run-around</TE>
<TE>   You pulled me right inside your game</TE>
<TE>   Of lost dream ...</TE>
<TE>   Lowe and Tulin were far happier making records and experimenting
in the studio than playing, say, the Swingin' Gate Club in Fort
Wayne, Ind. But after "Too Much to Dream" peaked at No. 11 on the
charts in early 1967, and a follow-up, "Get Me to the World on Time,"
hit No. 27, Reprise Records sent the band on the road to promote its
first album.</TE>
<TE>   The year was a blur of touring from Phoenix to Birmingham to
Salem, N.H., with acts like the Beach Boys and Cream and television
appearances from "Where the Action Is" to "The Smothers Brothers
Comedy Hour," culminating in concerts in Britain and Europe,
including a blistering performance in Stockholm that was broadcast on
Swedish radio. (Lowe began the show by earnestly apologizing for
America's involvement in Vietnam.)</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the musicians found the experience hollow. While it
was routine for managers to treat new bands as commodities, the
Prunes' idiosyncrasies made the tension worse. They not only wanted
to record without performing--a luxury afforded to no one but the
Beatles--but to record their own compositions rather than what they
considered the lightweight fare they were being handed. This struggle
produced an inconsistent second album that sold weakly. The musicians
expected to go back into the studio after returning from Europe in
late '67, only to be sent back on the road. They resented being
forced to make a concept rock album ("Mass in F Minor")--sung in
Latin--which also sold sluggishly.</TE>
<TE>   There had already been turmoil in '67, when the band's original
drummer and rhythm guitar player quit. Now, in '68, Lowe left the
band for good in the middle of a tour. ("It was better to disappear
than to do some formal crash.") Within a couple of months Tulin,
guitarist Williams and Joe Dooley, who'd been hired that year to
replace a second drummer, also quit.</TE>
<TE>   What followed hurt just as much: Manager Hassinger, who retained
the right to use the band's name, hired other musicians and kept the
Electric Prunes alive until 1970, issuing two more albums.</TE>
<TE>   The real Prunes scattered. Lowe worked for years as a studio
recording engineer before setting up his TV-commercial business.
Williams headed for Oregon in an attempt to "mellow out," eventually
starting a computer-consulting business, which he runs in Santa
Barbara. Tulin played on studio sessions, wrote scripts, went to law
school for a year, quit to become a geriatric psychologist and quit
that to run medical billing seminars. Drummer Dooley hooked up with a
succession of bands.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s, "Too Much to Dream" became enshrined by a network of
critics and record collectors. They placed it--and the Prunes--in a
mid-'60s punk-rock hall of fame that usually included other
short-lived bands like the Standells, the Seeds and the Count
Five--stripped-down American guitar bands that reclaimed dominance in
the wake of the British Invasion. Ken Williams was hailed as a guitar
visionary, his work best exemplified, it was said, on a poor-quality
recording of that '67 Stockholm concert.</TE>
<TE>   Little of this mattered to the men in the band. Lowe's son,
Cameron, who as a tot loved rolling out of bed at night to watch Dad
and his pals play, could not get a word out of his father about his
rock 'n' roll days. "He distanced himself from it so much, he'd make
you feel bad for bringing it up."</TE>
<TE>   James Lowe mocks himself now for acting like a vet who found
Vietnam too painful to discuss, but he suffered from a similar sense
of betrayal: Remembering the Prunes meant remembering you'd been
forced to follow the instincts of an older generation instead of your
own. "In my mind I probably viewed it as a failure. It's not that
easy to look at a failure when you've done everything you could to
make it come out right. We were just average guys--we were a garage
band--rather than people steeled to the music business."</TE>
<TE>   Only once, when Cameron was writing a ninth-grade report on '60s
rock, did James agree to talk about the Prunes. A few years later, in
the mid-'80s, Lowe's daughter, Lisa, a student at Cal Poly San Luis
Obispo, persuaded him to discuss his career with a class, and that
seemed to make a dent in a man who'd convinced himself nobody cared
about his brief career. "It was an exorcism," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, as late as the mid-'90s, the musicians found it too painful
to seek out one another. "There's no separation between business and
personal in a band," Tulin said. "For a long time I didn't want
anything to do with anything or anybody that had been part of it."</TE>
<TE>   It took a 27-year-old Prunes fan to break the ice.</TE>
<TE>   His name was David Katznelson. He'd first heard the band's records
in high school ("it stirred something inside me") and was now a vice
president at Warner/Reprise. Katznelson wanted the label to issue a
best-of Prunes compilation, but it took him two years trying to find
anybody in the band, and when he did Lowe was not interested.
Katznelson persuaded Lowe to come into the studio to listen to the
tapes, promising he'd be able to choose which songs were used, and
Lowe called Tulin for the first time in 20 years, asking him to join
him.</TE>
<TE>   Now the Internet took over. In England, a 30-year-old music fan
named Haydn Jones, who'd fallen in love with "Too Much to Dream" on
an oldies radio show at 14 and had collected European reissues of the
Prunes' first album over the years, started looking for information
about the Prunes online. When he came up empty, he decided to start a
Prunes site. Gradually he found e-mail addresses for some of the
members; others, including drummer Dooley, sought him out. This
connected the other Prunes with Lowe and Tulin.</TE>
<TE>   Unknown to Jones, another British fan, Simon Edwards, a
fortysomething record collector and the owner of a small label, was
already at work on a parallel mission, trying to issue that Prunes'
Stockholm concert as a CD. Edwards, who remembered begging his
boarding school housemistress to go to the store and buy the "Get Me
to the World on Time" single for him in 1967, had tracked down a
studio copy of the concert from Stockholm Radio. But he was finding
it difficult to obtain permission. In the late '90s he found a
friendly voice at Warner in Katznelson, who introduced him to Lowe.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Lowe, Tulin, Dooley and Williams began sitting down to
play, just for fun, occasionally recording at Lowe's studio, just for
fun. Tulin and Lowe wrote some songs, just for fun. Dooley brought in
a second guitarist, Mark Moulin, whose playing was dense with
'60s-style flourishes. Cameron Lowe, now in his mid-30s and finally
hearing his fill of stories about the old days, was asked to be the
Prunes' keyboardist.</TE>
<TE>   Katznelson formed his own record label, Birdman, to release the
Prunes compilation album in 2000. He estimates it has sold about
5,000 copies. (This year, in an agreement with Edwards' label,
Birdman began selling the Stockholm concert CD in the U.S.)</TE>
<TE>   The reunited Prunes played their first gig in mid-2001 at a
friend's vintage-rock-equipment festival in Riverside. When Van
Zandt's Cavestomp fest came calling, they decided to package their
new material as the "Artifact" CD and sell copies at the show. Lowe
estimates the CD has sold about 2,000 copies.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd like to be able to record and play music, to perpetuate
this," Lowe says during a rehearsal break. "In the face of everything
that seems reasonable, that doesn't seem possible. But all the best
things in my life have been serendipitous,"</TE>
<TE>   He has always been the band's elder statesman. He's still married
to Pamela, the girl he met on her third day of high school in 1960.
He delights at the way contemporary critics trace the sensibility of
"Too Much to Dream" to the unvarnished style of neo-garage acts like
the Hives, the Strokes and the White Stripes. He savors a
mid-September e-mail from a pair of Israeli fans who came to last
month's performance in Canterbury, England, thanking the band for "a
musical journey into a remote past.... Listening to you playing live
on stage, after all those years ... symbolized one thing: This music
is going to live forever."</TE>
<TE>   "What happened before," he says, "was that we sort of lost control
of everything by someone else telling us where to go play, how to
look, how to act, how not to act. And now it's back to a place where
the inmates have taken over the asylum."</TE>

<LD>Josh Lucas has appeared in more than a dozen movies, but in "Sweet
Home Alabama," he finally looks like himself: matinee-idol handsome.</LD>
<LD>   In previous films, the 31-year-old Arkansas native has played such
diverse parts as Russell Crowe's mathematician rival-turned-friend in
"A Beautiful Mind," the sleazy predator whose murder sets off the
chain of events in "The Deep End," and Laura Linney's deadbeat
ex-husband in "You Can Count on Me." They won him critical plaudits,
but not leading-man roles.</LD>
<LD>   That could change with "Sweet Home Alabama." The actor's intense
blue eyes and classic features wowed 'em at the initial reading in
New York. "Everybody was just staggered by his charm, his looks, the
way he carried himself," director Andy Tennant says.</LD>
<TE>   During editing, as Tennant was trying to trim a few minutes from
the film, he shaved 10 frames from a Lucas close-up. "Ten frames
isn't even a blink of an eye," he says. "But when we played the movie
back, my producer and one of my editors [both of whom were women]
noticed. They demanded that I put them back." He did.</TE>
<TE>   For Lucas, though, those good looks have been a problem. When he
first arrived here more than a decade ago, "I felt like being an
actor in Los Angeles was about being part of a lottery system, where
you're really just rolling dice at a craps table. I was starting to
see that my numbers were coming up because of my physical presence,
but not because of anything at all to do with my talent."</TE>
<TE>   So eight years ago, he moved to New York and started taking
classes, becoming serious about his acting. He eventually landed the
role of Judas in Terrence McNally's controversial 1998 play "Corpus
Christi," which imagined Jesus as a gay man in Texas white-trash
country.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Lucas has been in demand, first by independent
filmmakers, now by the studios. It may have something to do with how
seriously he takes his craft: As Martin Hansen in "A Beautiful Mind,"
he went from 165 to 220 pounds to play the young Princeton
mathematician and his older self later in the film.</TE>
<TE>   He auditioned for the role of Jake, Reese Witherspoon's down-home
husband, in "Sweet Home Alabama" in part, he says, "because I had not
done anything close to myself at all. I thought it was going to be
really easy. It turned out to be terribly difficult. My instincts are
not comedic. I was always making these dark, dramatic choices."</TE>
<TE>   An exasperated Tennant finally told him: "Stop being Ralph
Fiennes!" It became a joke with the crew, Lucas admits. "I would get
my Ralph Fiennes take, and then we'd do it the right way, which was
to lighten it up and make it more playful, much more who I am inside
myself."</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the accent: He had worked for years to eliminate
the Southern twang, only to find he needed it back for "Alabama."
Luckily, the dialect coach Disney hired happened to be the same
teacher with whom he had been working in New York, and "she's got all
my notes."</TE>
<TE>   Later this fall, he will be seen in "The Weight of Water," playing
Elizabeth Hurley's boyfriend in a psychological drama about an
unsolved 19th century murder. He has just finished shooting "The
Hulk," next summer's Marvel comic-book adaptation in which he plays
the bad guy, Major Glenn Talbot.</TE>
<TE>   Lucas is uncomfortable about the looming threshold of name
recognition, though clearly he's considered one of Hollywood's rising
young stars (he's designated as such in the recent issue of Vanity
Fair). But he's confident that his New York friends will keep his
head from swelling. He plays poker every Wednesday night in his
Washington Square Park neighborhood. "That game is so grounding," he
says. "You can't get away with anything."</TE>

<DH>The major survey 'Parallels and Intersections:
Art/Women/California' sheds light on an oft-neglected group of female
artists from 1950 to 2000</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCARLET CHENG</AU>

<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>It's after-hours at the San Jose Museum of Art, a renovated library
building in the heart of this city's old downtown, and JoAnne
Northrup, the museum's senior curator, finds a moment to talk about
the exhibition filling the institution's entire gallery space.
"Parallels and Intersections: Art/Women/California, 1950-2000" is
intended, she says, to be a landmark show of female artists who
created landmarks in art history.</LD>
<LD>   "There hasn't been a major, comprehensive women's art show since
the one at LACMA in the mid-'70s, and that covered 1550 to 1950,"
says Northrup, who served as organizing curator for the San Jose
exhibition. "That show was extremely important, but it was 25 years
ago, and it didn't really discern important regional differences.
California artists have been very often on the forefront and cutting
edge of art making, and we recognized there was a void to be filled.
This was a way of refining the idea of a women's art show, narrowing
it down to a region, to a fruitful time period."</LD>
<TE>   The show features 90 female artists who have lived and worked in
California since 1950. There is sculpture by Los Angeles artists
Betye Saar and Liz Larner. Conceptual artist Alexis Smith is
included; Judy Dater's extreme parodies on femininity hang near a
monitor running a documentary on "The Dinner Party," Judy Chicago's
multimedia celebration of the mythical and historical heroines of
"herstory."</TE>
<TE>   Culled from more than 50 lenders by independent curators Diana
Fuller and JoAnn Hanley, the exhibition has been broken into two
parts: Media-based works went up first and will come down in October;
paintings, sculpture and mixed-media works are on view until Nov. 3.</TE>
<TE>   In essence, "Parallels and Intersections" explores the art created
as women's roles and consciousness shifted in the second half of the
20th century. In the book that accompanies the exhibition, Susan
Landauer, the San Jose museum's chief curator, calls it "subject
matter that mainstream art history has neglected, not least of which
is the effect of post-World War II sociopolitical conditions on the
themes, issues and practices reflected by these artists."</TE>
<TE>   Fuller, a former San Francisco gallery owner and the show's lead
curator, and Hanley, a new-media project coordinator at USC's
Annenberg Center for Communication, had a rich vein of West Coast art
history with which to work. Fuller ticks off a few milestones: Judy
Chicago setting up a women's studies program at Cal State Fresno,
then coming to California Institute of the Arts in 1971 to run the
seminal Feminist Art Program with Miriam Schapiro; the creation of
Womanhouse, in 1972, a set of installations that caused a national
sensation; and the founding of the Woman's Building in downtown L.A.,
another important feminist art institution.</TE>
<TE>   "We chose artists who through their work influenced a broad
spectrum of people," says Fuller. "I lived through these years and
these women affected me and everyone else."</TE>
<TE>   When Fuller suggests a route through "Parallels and
Intersections," she starts at the staircase that leads from the first
to the second floor at the museum. There, the story that underlies
the exhibition gets graphic treatment in the form of a giant
photographic detail from Judith Baca's "The Great Wall of Los
Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   The mural, which lines half a mile of the Tujunga Wash in the San
Fernando Valley, is one of L.A.'s most famous public art works. For
the San Jose show, Fuller chose a signal image--Rosie the Riveter.
Rosie may have dutifully served her country during wartime, but in
this vignette she's being sucked, feet first, into the vacuum cleaner
operated by a Happy Homemaker inside a television screen, that
homemaker being the 1950s ideal of the American woman.</TE>
<TE>   It was also, says Fuller, a time when more women began attending
art schools and tackling careers as artists. One can see the progress
simply by counting the works from each decade: The 1950s and early
1960s are represented by only a handful, including a grouping of Ruth
Asawa's cascading crocheted wire pieces in the lobby and Jay DeFeo's
painting "The Jewel" in the main gallery. By the late '60s and '70s,
the numbers are growing.</TE>
<TE>   The "parallels" referred to in the show's title address five
cultural communities in California--Fuller included works by African
American, Asian American, Latino, European American and Native
American artists. "Intersections" refers to those artists' shared
concerns--feminism, for example, is an element in many of the
works--and techniques.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes the issues are rather subtly expressed," Northrup says,
"such as the work of Mineko Grimmer." Set on an outside balcony,
Grimmer's "Musical Vessels" (1993) is made up of eight large
terracotta jars--and real ice. The ice, replaced a couple of times a
day, is placed on a perforated plate across the top of each jar. As
it melts, drops of water fall inside, creating ever-changing and
unexpectedly beautiful sounds that echo inside the jar chamber.
"Grimmer is Japanese [American]," Northrup says, "and this work
references Zen, Minimalism and John Cage."</TE>
<TE>   Although the works aren't hung strictly by chronology, the main
gallery focuses on the flowering of California women's art in the
late 1960s and 1970s, from a group Fuller calls "early trailblazers."
There is a drawing by Vija Celmins, a sculpture by Saar, a fabric
assemblage by Schapiro and a painting by Faith Ringgold. The Schapiro
work and the Ringgold work have a homemade, folk art quality--in fact
Schapiro's incorporates examples of women's needlework from
Australia--which reflects an attempt to elevate traditional women's
craft.</TE>
<TE>   Smaller side galleries move the story through the 1980s and the
'90s, with installations by Amalia Mesa-Bains and Mildred Howard, a
signature Kara Walker silhouette parodying Old South stereotypes,
body-image photographs from a number of artists, and paintings such
as a minimalistic triptych of earth tones by Anne Appleby.</TE>
<TE>   Mesa-Bains' "Emblems of the Decade: Borders Installation" (1990)
includes an altar-like dresser surrounded by soil, its drawers half
open to reveal yet more soil. Half-burnt candles, religious statues,
pop culture idols and three small ships--the Nina, the Pinta and the
Santa Maria?--complete the work. In "Taps," hundreds of used metal
shoe taps are carefully arranged in rows; down the center parade
pairs of white-painted shoes, marching toward an old shoeshine
station with three elevated chairs. A quote from Howard, a black
artist, ties the work to the "historic contradictions against which
we struggle."</TE>
<TE>   Also in these galleries are photographic portraits from the
austere to the voluptuous. Ann Hamilton's "Body Object Series"
(1984-1993) includes a photograph in which her face is obscured by a
blowing scarf. Nearby, in contrast, Laura Aguilar puts her own
Rubenesque body into nature scenes as a way, says the wall text, of
tackling issues of power and beauty.</TE>
<TE>   Downstairs, documentation of performance art and video works
dominate the new media portion of the show. And, given the time frame
of the exhibition, some of what's new is actually pretty old.</TE>
<TE>   "All these works were shown during the time they were made, and
most were well-received," says associate curator Hanley, who
organized much of this material. "They were considered groundbreaking
for one reason or another."</TE>
<TE>   For example, while interactive art seems run of the mill to us
today, it was novel in 1980, when Lynn Hershman presented "LORNA."
It's a loose narrative about an agoraphobic woman whose story the
viewer can manipulate via a remote control. The work, originally
recorded on laserdisc, has been transferred to DVD. Shown on a TV set
in a living room environment, it re-creates the original
installation.</TE>
<TE>   Hershman "was one of the first artists, and probably the first
woman artist, to use interactive technology," Hanley says.</TE>
<TE>   An installation by Sara Roberts, "Early Programming," jumps
several steps ahead in interactivity--offering more choices and
coordinating responses on two monitors via the expanded capacity of a
hard drive. This work puts the viewer at a kitchen table, in a
dialogue with a lecturing "Mother," rendered by a droning computer
voice.</TE>
<TE>   Generally in these works, Hanley notes, "the content was the same
as what was going on in [the rest of] the art world."</TE>
<TE>   But the medium is the message: As Hanley says, at the time, "Just
putting your hands on the equipment was a feminist act."</TE>
<TE>   Fuller had the idea for her show in 1998, and before the San Jose
Museum signed on two years later, she had begun preparing a book on
the same subject. Coedited by Fuller, the book contains 20 essays
from the likes of UC Santa Cruz professor Angela Davis and artist
Mesa-Bains that provide context for the exhibition.</TE>
<TE>   In the museum, however, explanatory text has been kept to an
introduction on the wall of the main gallery. The works themselves
are accompanied only by artist statements.</TE>
<TE>   It's a decision with which some critics have disagreed. Jack
Fischer, art critic for the San Jose Mercury News, found that the
show lacked "connective tissue that ties individual works to a
broader story."</TE>
<TE>   Fuller, however, thinks the structure is sufficiently clear. The
show, she says, isn't meant to be a critical review: "This is about
paying homage to women artists and getting the record straight--and
even experiencing some really lovely works of art."</TE>

<DH>Acting coach Larry Moss gains acclaim -- and an invitation
to a Swiss festival -- for his shepherding of "The Syringa Tree"</DH>

<LD>Los Angeles acting teacher Larry Moss hasn't been the same since
1997, the year his trusted astrologer suggested he be more creative.
Though he was already successful, she thought he should realize his
dream of directing. Because only the lack of engaging material held
him back, she told him to create it himself.</LD>
<LD>   "I realized it didn't make any sense to sit around and complain
about the lack of good scripts when I could help create them," says
the 58-year-old teacher, a tall, lanky man with a warm presence and a
penchant for baseball caps. No one--except maybe his
astrologer--could have foreseen the consequences.</LD>
<LD>   Shortly thereafter, actress Pamela Gien showed up for a class. She
performed a 20-minute sketch, playing herself as a child in her
native South Africa. "I was overwhelmed by her portrayal of a girl
living in unbelievably dangerous circumstances and flying into
fantasies to protect herself from the reality of apartheid," he says.
"I knew it could be a great play because it's a universal story--we
all live in a world in violent turmoil."</LD>
<TE>   It took Moss and Gien three years to develop "The Syringa Tree,"
which had its premiere at Seattle's ACT Theatre in 2000. She
eventually wrote 22 characters into the play, including her parents,
the family maid, friends and various villagers, all of whom she
portrayed. In New York, "The Syringa Tree" was awarded an Obie for
best play of 2001, the Drama Desk Award and the Outer Critics Circle
Award for outstanding solo performance.</TE>
<TE>   And its life didn't stop there: Moss directed a television film of
the play, distributed by Trio, and will direct the play again at
Theaterworks in Palo Alto, Calif., (Oct. 12 to Nov. 3), at the
Pasadena Playhouse (Nov. 3 to Dec. 1) and at the Canon Theatre in
Beverly Hills (Dec. 2-Jan. 12). He and Gien will collaborate again on
her film "The Lilly Field," which begins production in the spring.</TE>
<TE>   After Moss began working on "The Syringa Tree," actor Bo Eason
arrived at the Larry Moss Studio in Santa Monica with his story, what
he envisioned as a supposedly comic sketch based on his NFL career.
Moss saw tragedy instead--and the potential for gripping theater.
Moss began pulling details out of Eason until, one day, the former
athlete collapsed in tears.</TE>
<TE>   Eason played with the Houston Oilers for several years in the
mid-'80s until knee problems forced him out. Like the hero of his
play, Eason has a more talented brother and a domineering father who
pushed him to compete. Most of the show takes place just before an
important NFL game in which he will face his brother, the quarterback
for the opposing team. Until he began working with Moss, Eason had
not faced up to the hardships of gaining parental approval nor to the
approved brutality of football, and how they almost destroyed his
life.</TE>
<TE>   Last winter, Eason's story "The Runt of the Litter," which Moss
directed, had a brief run off-Broadway. Late next year, Castle Rock
is scheduled to release through Warner Bros. a film based on the
play.</TE>
<TE>   Moss expects actors to establish a deep connection with the
characters they'll portray. "They can't do that until they know who
they are," he says, showing the influence of his 35 years in
psychotherapy. One way there, he says, is to have them do "relaxation
exercises," during which they recall an event through their senses
and relive it emotionally.</TE>
<TE>   His unwavering dedication to his craft has made him one of the
most influential acting coaches today. Directors as well as actors
vie for his time, with students sometimes waiting a year to attend
classes. Steven Spielberg and Kate Capshaw put up the original money
for the Edgemar Center for the Arts, an arts complex opening in
October in Santa Monica, to which Moss will relocate his studio.</TE>
<TE>   His stature also earned him a six-figure advance from Bantam/Dell
for "The Intent to Live," a book on acting, and a chance to play
himself--an acting coach--in the Belgian film "Michael Blanco,"
scheduled for release this winter. And it was his talent for creating
first-rate theater that won him an invitation to the prestigious
Verbier Festival in Switzerland, best known for world-class musical
performances.</TE>
<TE>   Until the success of "The Syringa Tree" and "The Runt of the
Litter," Moss' reputation rested largely on his film work. After all,
there's nothing quite like having Helen Hunt ("As Good as It Gets")
and Hilary Swank ("Boys Don't Cry") thank you for helping them win
Academy Awards, or having actors like Michael Clarke Duncan, Jason
Alexander, Hank Azaria and Jim Carrey rave about your talents. "But
theater gave me my life," Moss says, and it was his love of theater
that prompted his most recent endeavor, a workshop in July hosted by
the Verbier Festival.</TE>
<TE>   "After I saw 'The Syringa Tree,' " says Verbier founder Martin
Engstroem, "I knew we wanted to have him here. He represents the kind
of innovation we strive for. He inspires people."</TE>
<TE>   Moss was born and raised in Encino Hills in what he describes as
an acutely dysfunctional family--his mother was a paranoid
schizophrenic who introduced him to theater. By his early teens he
had decided to be an actor, and at 18 left for New York. Two years
later he married actress Susan Slavin, from whom he is now divorced.</TE>
<TE>   Moss soon got gigs on Broadway, first in a 1962 revival of "West
Side Story" as one of the Jets, and in 1970 appearing in "So Long,
174th Street" and "I Love My Wife," honing his skills with noted
teachers Stella Adler and Sanford Meisner. But it was as a teacher
and coach that he blossomed, first at the Juilliard School and later
as musical director at Circle in the Square. In the process of
uncovering and repairing his childhood scars in psychotherapy, he had
gained an ability to discern and cultivate actors' distinctive
skills.</TE>
<TE>   For the Verbier workshop, Moss chose eight actors who were
passionately interested in extending their range. Though they all
have successful careers--Oscar winner Juliette Binoche recently
starred in "Chocolat"; Joel Gretsch was featured in "Minority
Report"; Patrick Muldoon was in "Starship Troopers"; and the others
work regularly in television, films and theater--they shared a
frustration with the quality of material available to them, and a
belief that Moss could help them create their own.</TE>
<TE>   "The workshop certainly wasn't for the weak-hearted," he says. "I
asked them to go places emotionally that they'd never gone before."
During the workshop, the actors led an idyllic existence, with
housing provided in picturesque chalets surrounded by the majestic
Alps. They'd often start their days with mountain walks and end them
with concerts and fine dinners. Before meeting with Moss, they spent
time with Jean-Louis Rodrigue or Kristof Konrad, movement specialists
from Los Angeles with whom Moss collaborates. "They help the actors
get in touch with their bodies, which is the only way to give a
complete performance," Moss explains. Like a therapist, Moss often
began the sessions by suggesting exercises in free association,
pulling material from them as they talked. "There was an enormous
desire on everybody's part to get rid of his or her masks," he says.
"You begin with that raw material, and then you can use your
imagination to create a work of art."</TE>
<TE>   The actors also developed relationships with one another, in time
establishing a group dynamic that resembled a family. That kinship
was evident on one of their last days in Verbier when Binoche acted
out a childhood experience.</TE>
<TE>   Dressed casually in black pants, running shoes and a flowered
shirt, Binoche stood across from Moss, the other actors sitting in a
circle around them. As an introduction, she explained that she was 7
years old and standing outside her family's Paris apartment. She
began pounding on the door, desperate to show her mother her new
watch, but her mother, who was completely self-absorbed, ignored her.
Her face contorted in anguish, she worked herself into such a frenzy
of frustration and grief that the other actors couldn't contain their
tears. All the while, Moss kept urging her on, his hands
outstretched, his eyes kind and his whole body leaning toward her,
insisting she go further.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, she flopped down on a couch exhausted, a smile
brightening her face at Moss' congratulations. "Larry helps you see
all the possibilities in yourself," she said.</TE>
<TE>   One by one, other actors followed with scenes. "In terms of
improvisation and connecting to their acting instrument, I saw some
of the best work I've ever seen," Moss says. "These are seeds of
great theater and film."</TE>
<TE>   Now back in Los Angeles, the actors meet with Moss weekly, with
Binoche calling in from Paris to participate. "They're on fire with
creativity," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The Verbier Festival asked them all back next summer, promising to
build a theater in which they can present their new works and where
Moss can direct Binoche in Strindberg's "Miss Julie." "It's a very
good time for me," he says.</TE>

<DH>Paul Schrader's film on Bob Crane portrays the late
'Hogan's Heroes' actor as a prisoner of his peccadilloes</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGH HART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The clean-cut star of "Hogan's Heroes" seemed pleasant, witty,
outgoing. He appeared to enjoy a picture-book marriage living in
Tarzana with his pretty wife and three attractive kids. And after his
sitcom was canceled in 1971, he still seemed to charm dinner theater
audiences throughout the hinterlands whenever he'd perform the
romantic comedy "Beginner's Luck."</LD>
<LD>   What Bob Crane did not seem to be was a compulsive pornographer.</LD>
<LD>   But when "Auto Focus," starring Greg Kinnear, comes out Oct. 18,
"real-life sex addict" may turn out to be the role for which Crane is
best remembered.</LD>
<TE>   Crane's womanizing destroyed two marriages and damaged his career.
With John Carpenter, a video technician who became his best friend
and orgy partner, Crane taped hundreds of sexual encounters right up
until the summer night in 1978 when he was bludgeoned to death in a
Scottsdale, Ariz., motel room. For director Paul Schrader, the Bob
Crane story, devoid of redemption, proved irresistible.</TE>
<TE>   "See, I disagree with this whole thing in Hollywood, that
characters have to be likable," says Schrader, sipping soup in a Los
Angeles restaurant. "I don't know that they have to be likable. They
have to be fascinating. Does Travis Bickle really have to have a dog?
I don't think so."</TE>
<TE>   Schrader should know. In his screenplay for "Taxi Driver" he
created the tormented Bickle for Robert De Niro. He also scripted the
indelible portrait of wife-beating boxer Jake La Motta in "Raging
Bull," and as writer-director of "Affliction," steered James Coburn
to an Oscar-winning performance as a sadistic drunken father. Over
the course of 20 pictures, the 56-year-old filmmaker has assembled a
gallery of obsessive personalities capable of commanding an
audience's attention in a slow-motion-train-wreck kind of way.</TE>
<TE>   "The trick," Schrader says, "is to get the audience not to pass
judgment too quickly and just sort of stick around for the ride and
watch these events unfold and gradually, they get sucked in."</TE>
<TE>   Schrader himself got sucked into Crane's orbit two years ago,
despite his resolve to swear off biopics. "Because of 'Raging Bull,'
I became one of those writers you'd go to if you have a difficult
subject. You're doing John Holmes, ask Schrader. You're doing the
Mitchell brothers, ask Schrader," he says of the adult film star and
San Francisco porn producers. "I wrote one on Bobby Darin, Doris
Duke, Hank Williams--these were never made." Schrader did direct
films about Patty Hearst and the suicide of Japanese author Yukio
Mishima. "So I was sick of making biopics, sick of watching them.
Then my agent said, 'You really ought to read this script.' "</TE>
<TE>   Paul Gerbosi's "Auto Focus" screenplay, based in part on Robert
Graysmith's book titled "The Murder of Bob Crane," struck Schrader
initially as "a straight-ahead biopic," he says. "But underneath it
was this very interesting relationship between Crane and Carpenter."</TE>
<TE>   Referring to Stephen Frears' fact-based 1987 movie about British
playwright Joe Orton, who was murdered by his boyfriend, Schrader
says, "I saw this kind of a heterosexual, middle-age, TV-star version
of 'Prick Up Your Ears.' I was interested in doing a story about the
enabling power of certain friendships that allow you to do things you
wouldn't do on your own."</TE>
<TE>   Schrader signed on as director, re-worked the script to emphasize
the co-dependent Crane-Carpenter dynamic and settled on Kinnear to
play Crane. "Greg had the glib, ironic tone, the hip, in-the-know, DJ
stuff that is actually kind of hard to do. I'm not very good at that.
I am rather good at getting an actor out into the deep end of the
pool. So Greg gave me the shallow end of the pool, and I gave him the
deep end."</TE>
<TE>   Schrader then picked Willem Dafoe, whom he'd directed in
"Affliction" and his 1991 film "Light Sleeper" to portray Carpenter.
"If I was going to take Greg someplace where he might be
uncomfortable, I needed an actor in those waters beside him. Will had
no compunction about playing either the nudity or the oddity of it
all. So Greg could look to Will, and Will would say, 'This is fine,
don't worry!' "</TE>
<TE>   In tracing the last 14 years of Crane's life, Schrader manipulated
film stock, production design and camera movement to mirror his
protagonist's dissolution. "The nature of addiction is that it sneaks
up on you," he says. "When we first meet him in 1964, the real Bob
Crane was doing Photo Play articles with the beautiful house and
family. So you take that hypocritical world of the '60s, you saturate
it with bright color and then slowly, incrementally, you make this
cluttered, washed-out world of the discos. You can't pinpoint the
moment when this world changes, just as an addict can't pinpoint the
moment he becomes an addict. It's just a little detail here, a little
detail there, until finally you're saying, 'Ooh, I don't know when it
started, but this is getting kind of creepy.' "</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Schrader says he needed the characters to be oblivious
to their flaws. "They can't know they're being creepy because people
who are inside a relationship don't know how peculiar it is."</TE>
<TE>   Case in point: Midway through "Auto Focus," Crane and Carpenter
sit half-naked on a rec room sofa one afternoon, nonchalantly
watching their self-produced pornography tapes on TV. "That was a
repeat of a shot I did in 'Affliction,' where Nick Nolte pulls out
his tooth," Schrader recounts. "He and Coburn, who plays his father,
are both watching wrestling on TV. Nick has a bottle, and Coburn has
a glass, and he just puts out the glass, and Nick fills it up. It was
like a Norman Rockwell tableau for alcoholism and parental abuse. I
thought I'll do the same thing here, but about sexaholics; they're
talking in this completely dislocated way: 'What is it about women?'
Then you pull back into this tableau. 'Here it is folks: America.' "</TE>
<TE>   Crane's wholesome public image--he starred in a 1974 Disney
picture called "Superdad"--stood in harsh contrast with his private
appetites. The affable celebrity's predilection for strip clubs and
one-night stands provided Schrader with just the kind of traction he
needed as a storyteller.</TE>
<TE>   "All his life, Bob Crane wanted to be the nice guy," Schrader
says. "He didn't want to offend anyone. So Bob Crane was living this
functional contradiction until it became dysfunctional. That's always
wonderful to watch because occasionally in life, more often in
fiction, you run into characters who are living this contradiction,
large and those two headlights of contradictions are coming down the
tracks aiming right at you. If you can get your hands on one of these
characters, then you've got something to work with! And that's what
we got with Mr. Crane."</TE>
<TE>   The other thing Schrader got with "Mr. Crane" was an ongoing
dispute with Scotty Crane, the actor's son by his second marriage to
actress Patti Crane (portrayed by Maria Bello in "Auto Focus"). Under
her stage name Sigrid Valdis, she played Hilda on "Hogan's Heroes."</TE>
<TE>   Scotty Crane had been shopping his own script about Bob Crane,
"Take Off Your Clothes and Smile," around the time that "Auto Focus"
was being developed. He currently runs a Web site that, among other
things, sells access to X-rated photos and videotapes of Bob Crane.
The younger Crane felt snubbed when he wasn't consulted by the makers
of "Auto Focus" and contends that the film short-changes his father's
virtues. "My father was a really happy, lighthearted guy," says
Crane, speaking by phone from Paris.</TE>
<TE>   Scotty Crane eventually met with Schrader and Kinnear on the "Auto
Focus" set and read the screenplay. "It shows none of the real humor
of Bob Crane," he says. "This isn't a funny film, it's a dark film,
and Bob Crane was anything but dark. The reason he was able to
attract so many thousands of women was because he was a charismatic,
fun-loving guy. Maybe parts of America will find pornography dark,
but let's face it: Today, with the advent of home video recorders,
it's pretty commonplace."</TE>
<TE>   Robert Crane Jr., Crane's son from his first marriage to Anne
Crane (played by Rita Wilson), consulted the filmmakers and had a
small role in the movie. Scotty Crane was offered a similar
arrangement but turned it down. When he was not invited to the first
press screening for "Auto Focus," Scotty Crane showed up anyway and
was escorted from the premises.</TE>
<TE>   Dissension within the Crane clan comes as no great surprise to
Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, who produced "Auto Focus." The
pair wrote "Man on the Moon" about Andy Kaufman, "The People vs.
Larry Flynt" and "Ed Wood."</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever you make these true stories, there's always
controversy," Alexander says. "Usually it's about omissions, because
you're taking somebody's life and turning it into an hour [and] 40
minutes, so there's bound to be something you left out."</TE>
<TE>   Adds Karaszewski: "Drama tends to focus around trouble and
conflict. You could make a whole movie about Bob Crane, the radio DJ
who raises three kids in Tarzana and goes to Little League games, but
I don't know if that's a movie."</TE>
<TE>   Bela Lugosi Jr. was upset for years at the way his father was
portrayed in "Ed Wood," Alexander says, while Schrader remembers Jake
La Motta's son Joey filing a lawsuit after "Raging Bull" was
released.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure it must be very heart-wrenching to see your father's
life portrayed on the screen," Alexander says. "We keep it as close
to facts as possible, but at end of the day these things have to work
as a structured motion picture, and Bob Crane certainly lent himself
to a very simple three-act structure: Here's a regular guy, he gives
in to temptation, he loses his way."</TE>
<TE>   Schrader believes "Auto Focus" rests on solid legal ground. "Sony
has vetted the script to within a millimeter of its life," he says.
"If there were a lawsuit, and they say there will be one, Sony feels
very confident about it." Scotty Crane's lawyer has been in contact
with the studio, but he says he has not taken any legal action.
Representatives of legal affairs for Sony Pictures Classics declined
to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Legal considerations aside, surely Schrader feels a special
responsibility when making a movie about a real person. "I do," he
says. "You can't trespass history. I'm troubled by 'Beautiful Mind,'
when schizophrenia can become a malady that can be cured by the love
of a good woman. But portraying Bob Crane as a creep, I don't think
that's going too far. I don't think I've crossed a line there. From
everything I know about his life, that's a pretty accurate portrait.
It's like so many of my other protagonists, going all the way back to
'Taxi Driver.'</TE>
<TE>   "These people just don't get it. Usually those kinds of characters
at some point toward the end of the movie, for a moment, get it. Bob
Crane never does. Robert Jr., who lived with him for a number of
months in Westwood after the second marriage broke up, told me Bob
Crane didn't see where the problem was. He was upset with the
consequences of his actions, not with his actions."</TE>
<TE>   Schrader admits, "I didn't identify with Bob Crane as closely as I
have with other characters, but I can take him into some very
interesting places, and in so doing, learn, and teach. That may seem
like a dirty word. But if audiences can learn, then why can't I
teach? And there's something to be learned from watching this guy."</TE>
<TE>   Namely?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if this is a morality tale," Schrader says, "but if
it is, then the moral is not 'Too much sex kills.' Home porn is
certainly not as scandalous or as unusual as it once was. But look,
the reason Bob Crane didn't have any friends is, if he had dinner
with a couple, within five minutes, he'd be reaching over and
stroking the arm of his friend's wife. This story is really about the
dangers of selfishness."</TE>

<DH>Most of the actors in the young LA Stage &amp; Film company
have already made it to Hollywood. What they really want to do is
perform onstage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>IRENE LACHER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Either the place was a destination for the hungry hordes or a waiting
room for heaven. The room Mary McDonnell is sitting in is
blizzard-white, and it's lined with countertops covered by various
coffee makers. But alas, the coffeepots are empty and the bare
countertops aren't any more promising. There's no trace of the
elaborate feasts laid out at production breaks by the filmmakers with
whom McDonnell is used to working.</LD>
<LD>   More likely, the room really is paradise adjacent, located as it
is on the second floor of a simple Methodist church in West Hollywood
that sometimes doubles as a meeting place for AA.</LD>
<LD>   Buddy, can you spare a rehearsal space?</LD>
<TE>   Next door to the church kitchen, McDonnell's colleagues in the
nascent theater company LA Stage &amp; Film are rehearsing Max Mayer's
new play "James and the Handless Maiden" under the direction of
McDonnell's husband, actor Randle Mell. Clearly, even though most
people in the company work in film and/or television, the scene is
nothing like Hollywood, certainly not the salaries, because there are
none. If the choice is love or money, well, you do the math.</TE>
<TE>   McDonnell is explaining how the return to her roots on the stage
isn't about the cash, not that she would turn it down if it were
offered. "I'm no purist," she says with a wry smile. The actress is
talking about how she hungered to play a part far more demanding than
the ones she's usually offered, that of "a dangerous woman" who has
just emerged from a psychiatric institution, committed after stabbing
her husband. All this before the curtain even goes up.</TE>
<TE>   At a graceful 50, McDonnell is just getting past that funny age
for women--the invisible 40s--when she was too old for "the girl"
roles and too young to play older women. And of course, juicy parts
for older women are far more common on the stage than in Hollywood's
youth culture.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of why I'm getting drawn back in is, I'm starting to get old
enough for some of the roles," she says, her perfectly manicured
hands sweeping the air as she talks. "On the set of 'ER' last year,
Noah Wyle and I were talking, and I said, 'We really should do a
reading of "The Glass Menagerie" because I've been waiting to play
Amanda, the mother, my whole life, but I wasn't old enough.' And he
just started laughing, and he said, 'You know, you are old enough
now.' And I said, 'Noooooooooo,' " she recalls and laughs.</TE>
<TE>   McDonnell is in good company, specifically the West Coast spinoff
of the accomplished not-for-profit New York Stage &amp; Film. LA Stage's
20-year-old counterpart produces new plays by established playwrights
and talented newcomers on Vassar College's bucolic campus in upstate
New York and has attracted numerous marquee names such as John
Patrick Shanley, Beth Henley, Richard Greenberg, Edie Falco and
Christian Slater.</TE>
<TE>   Several of New York Stage's plays have moved on to commercial
venues off-Broadway as well as on, such as "Tuesdays With Morrie,"
which opens in November at the Minetta Lane Theatre. (The company's
name refers to its initial mission, which included producing short
films, a goal it dropped because movies were consuming the bulk of
its resources.)</TE>
<TE>   Shanley, who has had four plays mounted by New York Stage &amp; Film,
says he's impressed by the caliber of talent there. "It's a terrific
company," he says. "They have a very good assessment of people's
gifts, and they're artist-friendly. They get what artists do, so it
isn't a battle. And they have very good taste in material. If you're
doing a new play, it's always the most fun to be doing it with other
writers whose work you respect."</TE>
<TE>   That holds true for the members of LA Stage &amp; Film, half of whom
are alumni of the New York company. For them, the essence of their
new venture is the company they keep.</TE>
<TE>   Consider McDonnell and Mell, whose connection goes back to 1986,
when Shanley recruited them for New York Stage's 1986 production of
his play "Savage in Limbo." The couple is close to "Handless Maiden"
playwright Mayer, a co-founder and producing director of New York
Stage who brought a pink teddy bear to the hospital when their
14-year-old daughter, Olivia, was born. McDonnell is the godmother of
producer Terry Urdang's son Parker, and she met Roxanne Hart in a
midwives' office before Olivia was born, a day before the arrival of
Hart's son, Alexander.</TE>
<TE>   Now Hart is starring in LA Stage's production of Craig Wright's
play "Orange Flower Water," which will alternate with McDonnell's
play during the company's inaugural run at the Gascon Center Theatre
in Culver City through Nov. 3.</TE>
<TE>   "LA Stage &amp; Film has evolved mostly out of a desire for a
theatrical community like a lot of these people experience in New
York," Mayer says.</TE>
<TE>   Hart, who was nominated for a Tony for "Passion," has appeared in
two plays at the Mark Taper Forum. She's also done staged readings
for National Public Radio at the Skirball Center. But it took the
opportunity to work with such longtime friends and colleagues to
entice her onto a smaller L.A. stage for the first time in her nine
years here.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're doing something that's just about love, and there's
absolutely no money involved, it's about trusting the individuals
that you work with that they're as committed as you are," Hart says.
"Sometimes when you work in plays like this, you feel that people are
just doing it until they can find something else.</TE>
<TE>   "A couple of people are doing other money jobs, but their heart is
in this play. It's the opposite dynamic of what I've experienced,
even working at the Taper, that people wanted people to see the work
so they could get other work. The play was not the end."</TE>
<TE>   For many of the two dozen people who've lent their names to the
company's letterhead, among them actors Greg Germann ("Ally McBeal")
and Philip Casnoff ("Strong Medicine") as well as director Barnett
Kellman ("Murphy Brown"), the professional food chain shifts into
reverse. Many are already working in Hollywood, and now they're
seeking a different sort of sustenance.</TE>
<TE>   "Actors who are here are here to do film and television, so I
think it takes a while for people to become thirsty to do theater
again," Mayer says. "But I think that does happen, and I think people
have a desire to do work that they're more in control of,
essentially, and that isn't bottom-line-oriented.</TE>
<TE>   "For the actors and writers especially, theater is a verbal medium
in a way that film isn't. And it's an actor's medium. Finally, the
actors are up there with the audience over a long arc--over a
two-hour arc rather than a two- or three-minute scene. I think that
actors are usually thrilled as well as terrified by that prospect."</TE>
<TE>   Mell says his needs have changed since he and McDonnell moved to
L.A. a decade ago when her career in Hollywood was heating up. He'd
done a lot of theater in New York, but it wasn't until a couple of
years ago that he returned to the stage to play Starbuck in "The
Rainmaker" on Broadway. Two years ago he starred in the Taper
production of "Closer."</TE>
<TE>   "When I came here, I was pretty focused on making money and on
doing film and television, the story of probably most actors who are
here," he says. "I was never that interested in Hollywood, frankly. I
was interested in making money and in trying to achieve some fame
because fame translates into power.</TE>
<TE>   "But there was a void for us, the individuals who make up LA Stage
&amp; Film. We felt the need to stay creative, and many times we don't
feel creative enough or used enough in film and television. And
there's nothing like doing plays to use all of yourself and make you
feel like you are completely engulfed in a process."</TE>
<TE>   The idea for LA Stage was first hatched by Urdang, whose sister
Leslie, an independent film producer, is a co-founder of the New York
company. In 1994, Terry Urdang helped organize a reading series, but
members' professional and personal lives interfered, so it wasn't
until recently that LA Stage began to have a consistent presence.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the group held a series of readings of new plays from
New York Stage's trove at the Falcon Theatre in Burbank. The group
was so taken with two of them that it decided to give them full
productions. Both coincidentally deal with infidelity.</TE>
<TE>   The West Coast premiere of "Orange Flower Water" by Wright, a
writer for HBO's "Six Feet Under," is directed by Meryl Friedman. It
features Michael Mantell, Brian Cousins and Urdang along with Hart in
a play exploring the fallout of an extramarital affair that shatters
the lives of two small-town families. Joining McDonnell in Mayer's
"James and the Handless Maiden" are Kevin Kilner, David Starzyk and
Catherine Corpeny, Mayer's actress-spouse.</TE>
<TE>   "We just all had the impulse," Urdang says. "We all committed to
it and said, 'Now or never.' "</TE>
<TE>   Company members hadn't had much experience with theater on a
shoestring. They wrote fund-raising letters to friends and
colleagues, cobbling together enough to pay the rent on the theater.
The largest donor was the Burke Williams spa, which gave $1,500. For
the rest, they mainly relied on donations of time, space and
materials.</TE>
<TE>   "We've taken a huge leap forward by seriously committing to doing
two pieces of theater and not really knowing how to do it," Mell
says. "We had to find a place to rehearse, we had to find lumber for
the set. We had to create it from scratch. Before, I didn't have to
sit in a living room with a bunch of friends and say, 'Let's put on a
play. Where do we begin?' I was always hired by a company."</TE>
<TE>   As romantic as the artist-in-a-garret scenario might be, it poses
logistical problems--namely, real life. Although people committed to
a three-week rehearsal schedule of four hours a day--which is still
fairly minimal--as well as the six-week run, there's always the
possibility someone will get a lucrative offer he or she can't
refuse.</TE>
<TE>   If that happens, there are no understudies to step in. "Who's
going to understudy for free, do all that work for no money and
little expectation of going on?" Mell says. Plan B is to substitute
plays if an actor can't make it.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, while bottom-line concerns can interfere with artistic
vision, money is also the glue that keeps such ventures together.
Without it, LA Stage's future is uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   "That's always the dilemma," Mell says. "We all have to make a
living. So it's great to have goals, but to say we're going to do two
plays every season might be well and good in theater, but it takes a
great deal of commitment to make that happen, and we're flying by the
seat of our pants here."</TE>
<TE>   But if company members are grappling with new problems, there are
also new possibilities. Mell is directing for the first time because
the playwright asked him to, and the play is the first he and
McDonnell have done together in 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   Although this is Mell's first chance to direct his wife, they say
the dynamic between them is hardly new. "I tell her what to do all
the time at home, but here it actually has an effect," he says with a
basso profundo laugh.</TE>
<TE>   For McDonnell, LA Stage offers the safe haven she needs to grow as
an artist.</TE>
<TE>   "This role is a huge leap for me because it calls on very
different things than I'm used to," she says. "I've played people who
were close to the edge, but nobody who was quite like this. I don't
know if I'd be as comfortable doing it if I weren't doing it with
Randy. The playwright and the director are two men I deeply love and
trust, so it's easier to risk it."</TE>

<DH>The L.A. Art Show, with an influx of modern works and a new
airport venue, aims to lure first-time buyers</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZANNE MUCHNIC</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once a year, people who love traditional art--particularly when it
has a regional flavor--can make their way to the Los Angeles Art
Show. They buy a ticket and enter an environment that offers
something a little different from what the name suggests.</LD>
<LD>   The "show" is an exhibition of sorts, but it's mostly a
marketplace where dealers set up booths to display and sell their
wares. It's the mall concept--one-stop shopping--applied to painting,
prints and photography. Such art fairs are user-friendly for those
who might hesitate to cross a gallery threshold, and something of an
annual meet-and-greet for more established collectors and dealers.</LD>
<LD>   The granddaddy of contemporary art fairs, Art Basel in
Switzerland, welcomed 50,000 collectors, dealers and curators to its
34th annual international marketplace in June, when 268 high-end
vendors showed their wares. Its American offspring, Art Basel Miami
Beach, will be launched in early December with 150 galleries from the
United States, Latin America, Europe, Africa and Asia.</LD>
<TE>   The L.A. edition is a much smaller affair. As its organizers
prepare for their eighth annual event next weekend, they are hoping
that 10,000 people will come to see artworks offered by 50 dealers,
33 from California, and the rest from states sprinkled across the
country from New England to the Southwest.</TE>
<TE>   Modest as those numbers are in comparison with Art Basel, they
still represent quite a leap for a fair that started with 16 dealers
in 1995 and has yet to chalk up attendance of more than 8,000.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the Art Show has been growing at a slow but steady
pace--outlasting other splashier ventures, including L.A.'s own
contemporary art fair, Art/LA, which ran from 1986 to 1993 at the
Convention Center--and evolving in terms of dealers, audience and
kinds of art shown.</TE>
<TE>   But this year, says Kim Martindale, who organizes the fair for the
Fine Art Dealers Assn., the show is ratcheting up the level of
change.</TE>
<TE>   For starters, there is a new location. The fair was held at the
Pasadena Civic Center for its first three years. Then it moved to
UCLA's John Wooden Center and stayed for four years. But now it has
moved to Barker Hangar, at the Santa Monica Airport, which offers
free parking and nearly twice as much exhibition space. It also
provides room to grow.</TE>
<TE>   "If we need more space next year, we can add a tent," says
Martindale, who seems delighted to be thinking big.</TE>
<TE>   The mix of art will be different too. Only two years ago, the Los
Angeles Art Show was billed as "the finest traditional art fair on
the West Coast" and was known as a source of 19th century French
landscapes, California Impressionism, Western art and works from the
Taos and Hudson River Valley schools. Those popular genres will be
present as usual this year, but they will be balanced by an influx of
contemporary art--Abstract Expressionist paintings and prints by
Robert Motherwell, sensuous paintings of a single line by Lorser
Feitelson, colorful lithographs by David Hockney and haunting
portraits by Dan McCleary.</TE>
<TE>   Forum Gallery, Louis Stern Fine Arts, Jack Rutberg Fine Arts Inc.
and a few other galleries have shown modern and contemporary pieces
in the past, but a dozen other L.A. dealers who work exclusively with
modern and contemporary art have joined the fair this year. Among
them are Manny Silverman, who specializes in abstract paintings of
the 1950s; Marc Selwyn, who runs the West Coast branch of Grant
Selwyn, a bicoastal showcase for blue-chip art in New York and
Beverly Hills; and Michael Kohn, who presents an eclectic exhibition
program at his gallery on Beverly Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles photography dealers Peter Fetterman and Paul Kopeikin
have joined the show as well. In addition, the fair has expanded its
Latin American component by enlisting Praxis-Mexico of Mexico City
and several L.A. galleries, including Chac Mool, Latin American
Contemporary, Remba and Tasende.</TE>
<TE>   The goal is to build on the fair's track record and traditional
base by adding "a tremendous diversity in fresh, exciting work,"
Martindale says. As usual, the Fine Art Dealers Assn. will vet all
the artworks offered for sale for provenance and authenticity, he
says. Prices will range from about $2,000 for works on paper by
relatively little-known artists to $2.5 million for a large painting,
"Rocky Mountain Sheep," by 19th century American artist Albert
Bierstadt, offered by Spanierman Galllery in New York.</TE>
<TE>   One goal of the show is to draw first-time buyers to the art
market and educate the curious. To that end, Martindale has scheduled
six symposiums on art, design and collecting. Representatives of four
Southern California museums--the Los Angeles County Museum of Art,
the Museum of Contemporary Art, the Orange County Museum of Art and
the Santa Barbara Museum of Art--also will be on hand to recruit
members and promote their exhibition programs.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the promise of all this activity, persuading dealers to
rent a booth and transport artworks to one more art fair can be
difficult. Michael Kohn--who plans to participate in an annual fair
in Paris in October and at Art Basel Miami Beach in December--turned
down Martindale's first invitation. But he changed his mind when some
of his peers decided to join the Los Angeles Art Show.</TE>
<TE>   "If a couple of my colleagues were going to do it, it made sense
to try to make it work for us and for Los Angeles," says Kohn, whose
display will include McCleary's portraits and Bruce Cohen's paintings
of domestic interiors and still lifes. "If it turns out well for us,
we can tell dealers in New York. If they come, this fair can be a
destination, and that's good for my business."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Kopeikin--who will offer classic images by Helen Levitt and
Diane Arbus along with recently made photographs by Rocky Schenck and
David Fokos and photo-realist paintings of taco trucks by John
Baeder--participates in several annual fairs, but usually only those
that are exclusively devoted to photography. This year's L.A. show
made it onto his list, he says, because it gives him a chance to
present the work of his artists in a broader context and to contact
collectors--including local ones--who might not come to his gallery
on La Brea Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, he says: "People like going to fairs. I do very well
at them."</TE>

<HD>For the French, Age Is Just a Number</HD>
<DH>Mature actresses fare better in France than their
counterparts in the United States</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LORENZA MUNOZ</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When French screen legends Catherine Deneuve and Fanny Ardant engage
in a wild wrestling match that evolves into a naughty romantic tussle
in their latest film, "8 Women," it is hard to imagine a similar
scene occurring in a Hollywood movie. As Anthony Lane wrote in the
New Yorker, it would be like watching Jane Fonda and Faye Dunaway
make out--not bloody likely.</LD>
<LD>   The French are not only less squeamish about sex, but they also
actually enjoy seeing mature women as sexually alluring creatures.
Fifty-eight-year-old Deneuve, 53-year-old Ardant and others over a
certain age (74-year-old Jeanne Moreau, for one) continue to be sexy
and bankable celebrities, at least according to a recently published
book on French movie stars. "James Ulmer's French Hot List" examines
the "bankability"--the degree to which an actor's name alone can
raise financing upfront for a film--of France's actors and comes up
with some surprising results.</LD>
<LD>   In France, seven of the top 15 bankable stars are women, by
Ulmer's calculations. All except 24-year-old Audrey Tautou are older
than 35.</LD>
<TE>   Contrast that with the American list of top 15 stars, which
includes only two women--Julia Roberts and Nicole Kidman. Kidman is
35, and Roberts turns 35 next month. "In America, you get older
faster. It's like Dorian Gray--you are old at 40," said Ulmer, who
published the "Hollywood Hot List" in 1997. "The French give women
the opportunity to age gracefully and to be feminine. French film
allows them to be sexual and sensual in a way we don't. We don't
allow women to be sexual after 40, and you see that in the way movies
are cast. Movies are a reflection of the culture."</TE>
<TE>   Isabelle Adjani, 47, is ranked 15th on the list and continues to
be thought of as one of France's most beautiful women. Same for
38-year-old Juliette Binoche (No. 3). She will be seen in "The
Children of the Century," opening Friday, as novelist George Sand
(nee Baroness Dudevant), who engages in a torrid love affair with a
man six years her junior. Some stars, like Moreau, have consistently
refused to play parts that depict aging women "getting drunk and
suicidal." To Moreau, age is a meaningless figure.</TE>
<TE>   "Life doesn't end at 30," she has been quoted as saying. "To me,
age is a number, just a number. Who cares?"</TE>
<TE>   In a country that fiercely promotes and protects film as part of
its culture, French actors have never been gauged by something as
coarse as their box-office clout.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, many of the producers, sales agents, film buyers and
sellers and heads of entertainment companies in France refused to
participate in the survey, said Francois Taborelli, who conducted the
interviews in France. Those who declined said either that they were
too busy or that they opposed such a ranking system.</TE>
<TE>   "They were reluctant in giving grades to actors," Taborelli said.
"In Europe, the movies are considered more an art form than an
industry."</TE>
<TE>   But France's film industry is changing. The nation has one of the
most prolific movie-making industries in the world, with more than
400 films produced in the country last year. In 2001, French films
grabbed a 46% market share at home, compared with 49% for Hollywood
movies (the other 5% was brought in by non-Hollywood and non-French
product). In past years, it was more common for Hollywood films to
corner more than 80% of the box office, dominating nearly every
theater and leaving little room for French films. In 2001, French
films took in more than $38 million at the box office, an increase of
nearly 500% from 2000, according to Unifrance USA, the French film
office liaison based in New York.</TE>
<TE>   But along with increases in production and box-office success come
other pressures. French producers, who can be just as reliant on
foreign partners as U.S. producers, now must consider how their films
will sell outside their home market. So, they must cast stars who
have audience appeal not only in France but also abroad. In addition,
the French film industry is heavily subsidized by its government,
something that appears likely to change. Less government money means
producers will have to rely more on private financing.</TE>
<TE>   This added economic pressure could begin to transform the French
film industry into something more closely resembling the Hollywood
model, where private financing and return on investment are key
elements in determining which films will be made and who will be
cast.</TE>
<TE>   Many French directors and producers already have abandoned the
notion of looking at film purely as art and are considering it more
as a commercial venture, Taborelli said.</TE>
<TE>   "Producers [in France] have the same problem as American
producers--they have to sell a movie," Taborelli said. "Even if they
don't want to say it openly, that is what they face.... But talking
about who is who in the industry and the salary of the stars is not
as taboo as it used to be. We are slowly coming to more of an
American system."</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, many Americans appear to be fed up with Hollywood's
obsession with youth and grosses. This summer, audiences seemed to
tire of blockbusters, with such highly hyped movies as "XXX" and "Men
in Black II" opening big and dropping significantly in subsequent
weeks. Many small- and medium-budget adult-oriented films performed
well, such as the Inuit-language film "The Fast Runner," which took
in more than $3 million, and "One Hour Photo," which has grossed
$14.5 million in almost a month. With $124 million since May, "My Big
Fat Greek Wedding" is still going strong. Over the last month, there
have been congressional hearings, protests and state legislation to
combat Hollywood's perceived ageism. Earlier this month, Gov. Gray
Davis signed a bill written by state Sen. John Vasconcellos (D-Santa
Clara) to help "educate the entertainment industry about the
lucrative and untapped market of consumers over 40."</TE>
<TE>   Although Hollywood's target audience continues to be teenage boys,
recent demographic statistics suggest that the fastest-growing sector
of the moviegoing audience is people older than 50. In 1990, young
adults ages 16 to 20 made up 20% of the audience. In 2000, that
number shrank to 17%, while the percentage of moviegoers ages 50 to
59 doubled to 10%.</TE>
<TE>   This year, audiences will see more older women at the movies, with
Susan Sarandon and Goldie Hawn in "The Banger Sisters," Michelle
Pfeiffer in "White Oleander" and Patricia Clarkson in "Welcome to
Collinwood" and "Far From Heaven." But none of those roles shows the
women as sexually desirable--with the possible exception of Hawn's
somewhat pathetic aging groupie character.</TE>
<TE>   Raising money and then actually getting a studio interested in
"The Banger Sisters" was excruciating, producer Mark Johnson said.
"It was very difficult to find a home for a movie about two
middle-aged women," he said. "It's not the stuff of what the studios
want." The movie was finally made for $10 million, and Sarandon and
Hawn were paid $500,000 each.</TE>
<TE>   Plum roles for women older than 40 are so rare that when a meaty
one does come along, there is a crush of talent knocking down the
door. Director Nancy Meyers, who revived Diane Keaton's career with
her and her former partner Charles Shyer's "Baby Boom" and hit it big
two years ago with "What Women Want," is working on a movie with an
unlikely premise--a 50-year-old man (played by Jack Nicholson) dumps
his twentysomething girlfriend for her mother (Keaton). Meyers said
she was inundated with calls from agents pitching their clients for
the role that eventually went to Keaton.</TE>
<TE>   "The baby boom generation is getting older and is going to embrace
seeing characters who are like them and are sexual and vibrant," she
said. Hollywood's current notion of an older woman-younger man love
affair is casting "Jennifer Aniston as the older woman," said Meyers,
referring to Aniston's current film, "The Good Girl," in which she
has an affair with a young store clerk.</TE>
<TE>   "Women my age want to see themselves reflected on the screen," she
said. "I know that life for us remains interesting."</TE>

<HD>Three Sonnets in Search of a Setting</HD>
<DH>Tobias Picker originally wrote 'Tres sonetos de amor' for
soprano and piano. Now it's something far grander.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Inspiration can come out of the blue, but if a composer is writing a
piece for voice, very likely he or she will choose the sound of a
particular singer to jump-start creativity.</LD>
<LD>   That's what happened with Tobias Picker as he composed his "Tres
sonetos de amor" (Three Love Sonnets) for rising-star baritone Nathan
Gunn and the Pacific Symphony. The song cycle will kick off the
orchestra's season Wednesday and Thursday at the Orange County
Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa.</LD>
<LD>   "When I write an opera, I always audition all the singers before
so that I know who I'm writing for and can conjure up the sound of
their voices," Picker said from his upstate New York summer home.
That's the process he's followed in the three operas he's written so
far, including "Fantastic Mr. Fox" for Los Angeles Opera in 1998, and
the process he's following as he's working on his fourth, "An
American Tragedy," for the Met in 2004-05.</LD>
<TE>   Picker heard Gunn, 31, sing Prince Andrei in Prokofiev's "War and
Peace" in his 1999 debut at the Opera National de Paris. He was
impressed, and subsequent hearings at the Met and the Opera Theatre
of Saint Louis confirmed Picker's impressions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a particularly lyrical voice and very beautiful. He's a
consummate musician, a consummate artist, and he's also a very good
actor. Because of all that, he can put across a song emotionally very
well. I plan to cast him in my future operas whenever possible."</TE>
<TE>   Picker originally wrote "Tres sonetos," based on poems by 1971
Nobel Prize-winning Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, just for soprano and
piano. Judith Bettina and James Goldsworthy gave the premiere in
November 2002 in Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   He drew the poems from a collection called "Cien sonetos de amor"
(100 Love Sonnets). "These three I thought were the best. They spoke
to me very deeply, and I felt that three was enough. They're quite
emotional. They're all so different. It's easy to overdose on these
sonnets. They're very, very rich. Each one is a very rich dessert."</TE>
<TE>   The first time around, the composition process took two years,
from 1998 to 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a difficult time in my life personally," Picker said, "and
so I would work on them and then put them aside. Finally, when the
summer of 2000 rolled around, I put them all together in a week. When
I finally finished them, I was finished with that difficult time in
my life, too. Writing them was cathartic."</TE>
<TE>   The impulse to rework the piece started with a commission from the
Pacific Symphony, but the change to different performing forces also
pushed it into new sonic directions.</TE>
<TE>   "I showed Nathan the songs, and he suggested that two of them
would work better for his voice transposed down a whole step," Picker
said. "So I made little adjustments, but that's a very common
practice when you're writing for the voice. Everybody's voice was
different."</TE>
<TE>   The changes go beyond transpositions and little adjustments,
however. Picker rearranged the order of the songs, and the shift from
piano to full orchestra, in his view, means that he has essentially
created a brand-new work.</TE>
<TE>   "The piano is the king of instruments," he said. "But if the piano
is the king, the orchestra is the god of instruments. The potential
for color and shading and nuance that you can get from an orchestra,
the possibilities are infinite.</TE>
<TE>   "Actually, the orchestration took quite a long time. I really
labor over my orchestration very meticulously and carefully. For me
it's a compositional process. It's not simply a matter of arranging.
It's another layer of composing."</TE>
<TE>   Which version does he prefer?</TE>
<TE>   "The orchestral version, at the moment, is my favorite."</TE>
<TE>   The new order, which he characterizes as moving from the surprise
to the pain to the obsession of love, works better, in his view. "The
middle poem is like--how shall I say it without seeming too
self-congratulatory?--the poem now in the middle is the gem, the
jewel, and the two outer poems are the setting that the jewel sits
in. Because of its intimacy, it didn't work to have it first. You
have to get into the whole spirit of the work before you can deal
with it."</TE>
<TE>   The voice that inspired Picker had its own journey.</TE>
<TE>   Gunn was born in South Bend, Ind., and began singing as boy. He
entered the University of Illinois to pursue voice, but his first
semester was a difficult one.</TE>
<TE>   "I was frustrated because no matter how hard I tried I couldn't
seem to progress technically," Dunn said from London, where he was
singing Harlequin in Strauss' "Ariadne auf Naxos" at the Royal Opera
House.</TE>
<TE>   "How does the body do this thing called singing in an efficient
and natural way? I knew [a way] must exist because of my background
in sports. There is a most efficient way of doing anything, a healthy
way that involves coordination of movement. I was open to learn, but
it wasn't being taught to me. This was a very frustrating time."</TE>
<TE>   Through a complicated chain of events that began when he met his
future wife, Julie, who was studying piano at the university, he was
able to solve the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically what happened was I started dating a girl from
California who had a choir teacher who was from Illinois who told me
to study with an old man that lived in Mahomet [Ill.] who was
actually singing in the same choir as I had been. Life is strange."</TE>
<TE>   In his senior year, he won the Metropolitan Opera's National
Council Auditions and was later asked to be in the Lindemann Young
Artists Development Program at the Met. He drew international
attention in March 1997 when, substituting for an indisposed singer,
he sang Guglielmo in a radio broadcast of Mozart's "Cosi fan tutte."</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Gunn's career has taken off, and he's sung or will
sing at the Met, Opera Bastille, Boston Lyric Opera, Lyric Opera of
Chicago, Glyndebourne and Glimmerglass Opera, among others. Local
audiences heard him sing the role of Marcello in a concert version of
"La Boheme" at the Hollywood Bowl this summer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a wonderful experience," he said. "The price I pay for all
of this is a high one, though. I'm rarely home. I sometimes don't see
my wife and five children for weeks at a time. Though I speak to them
on the phone every day, I haven't actually seen them since Aug. 1."</TE>
<TE>   Picker and Gunn began working together on "Tres sonetos" in New
York in June. Gunn echoes Picker's description of a positive process.</TE>
<TE>   "I gave him my ideas and he gave me his," he said. "This made the
end result very good. He is interested in suiting his music to the
instruments that perform it. Since every voice is unique, he takes it
as an opportunity to refine what he's written, to tailor his music to
the artist. The better he knows the artist, the better it gets."</TE>
<TE>   As for the finished new/old composition: "You'll like the songs a
lot," Gunn said. "The poetry is to die for and the music gives it
those varying flavors of passion that it needs."</TE>

<HD>So Much Potential, So Few Offerings</HD>
<DH>The state of Latino theater in L.A. isn't as robust as
you'd think. But there's hope.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>theseDonde esta el teatro latino?</LD>
<LD>   With Los Angeles' enormous Latino population and the city's
thousand-plus stage productions each year, it's logical that L.A.
would be a Latino theater center.</LD>
<LD>   But consider:</LD>
<TE>   The city's most venerable Spanish- and English-language company,
Bilingual Foundation for the Arts, has retreated to its 99-seat
theater in Lincoln Heights after several years of producing half of
its plays at a larger venue in downtown's Los Angeles Theatre Center.
Its hopes of creating a mid-size home on Olvera Street are dormant.</TE>
<TE>   A two-year attempt to turn Hollywood's Doolittle Theatre into a
Latino performance center has yielded only one production that lasted
more than a couple of weeks, "Selena," which lost more than $1
million in its April-June 2001 run.</TE>
<TE>   The track record of Latino-oriented productions on the main stages
of the county's major nonprofit theaters is sporadic at best. Even
the recent production of Spanish playwright Federico Garcia Lorca's
"The House of Bernarda Alba," at the Mark Taper Forum, used an Asian
American director and a number of non-Latina actresses.</TE>
<TE>   The 800-seat Teatro Los Pinos in South Gate, which is generally
described as the most commercially successful Spanish-language
theater in the county, imports its mostly frothy productions from
other countries and is off the radar of the larger Los Angeles
theatrical scene.</TE>
<TE>   Officials of El Portal Center for the Arts, the organization that
ran the mid-size El Portal Theatre, had pledged to include
Latino-oriented programming at their North Hollywood venue but didn't
do much before the group collapsed earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   All is not bleak on the Latino theater front; there are a few
signs of ferment. The Mark Taper Forum plans two productions that can
be considered Latino-oriented for its main-stage season. The
county-run John Anson Ford Amphitheatre sponsored a brief festival of
imported Latin productions in June. The International Latino Theatre
Festival, Nov. 1-10, will offer 14 performances by U.S. and foreign
companies, including East L.A. Classic Theatre, in downtown L.A. and
Echo Park. In the sub-100-seat arena, Grupo Teatro de Sinergia
performs all-Latino work in Spanish and English, and About
Productions' plays are frequently Latino-themed.</TE>
<TE>   And look who's back--Jose Luis Valenzuela, whose Latino Theatre
Company will open its first play in six years, "Dementia," at Los
Angeles Theatre Center's largest theater Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Valenzuela's group began as an in-house wing of the L.A. Theatre
Center resident company in the mid-'80s, and it presented several
productions on LATC stages. In 1991, Valenzuela moved to the Taper,
where from 1993 to 1994 he headed the well-endowed Latino Theatre
Initiative. The Taper presented three Latino productions on its main
stage that were generated by the initiative when he was there.
"Bandido," though not critically successful, was the Taper's
highest-grossing show of the 1993-94 season. But Valenzuela left in
1994, citing the complexity of trying to secure main-stage projects
at the Taper.</TE>
<TE>   He then created his own Latino Theatre Company, which briefly
operated out of Plaza de la Raza in Lincoln Heights but returned to
LATC to do "Luminarias," by his wife, Evelina Fernandez, in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Although the company originally planned to present regular
subscription seasons, Valenzuela soon concluded that without the
infrastructure of larger organizations, he would have to spend too
much of his time producing instead of creating new work. The company
then spent the next few years turning "Luminarias" into a feature
film, which was released in 2000. Fernandez is also the author of
"Dementia," which addresses AIDS from a Latino perspective.</TE>
<TE>   Just before a recent rehearsal of "Dementia," Valenzuela discussed
the state of his company and Latino theater in L.A. He sat at a table
in the LATC lobby, the same place where he and his group mounted a
short-lived squatters' demonstration after the resident company
closed, in which they emphasized the importance of keeping the space
available for Latino work.</TE>
<TE>   "I always loved LATC," he said. "We cannot go too far east or too
far west, but my audience has no problem coming to LATC."</TE>
<TE>   Valenzuela is adamant that his company is a part of the larger
American theater. Only once did he produce a show in Spanish. He
believes his primary audience consists mostly of assimilated Latinos,
some of whom aren't especially familiar with Spanish. "We would write
about a Latino family in L.A. like another playwright would write
about a Jewish family in New York," he said. "But I don't think the
world saw us that way."</TE>
<TE>   That last comment reflects his frustration from working within
mainstream theaters. "If we have to satisfy the dramaturges of those
institutions," he said, "we begin to shape plays to their taste. The
voices of the playwrights diminish. Latino theater is suffering
because the good writers have to write for the regular theaters."</TE>
<TE>   Valenzuela is scornful of many of those theaters' Latino-themed
efforts. He questioned the multicultural direction and casting of the
Taper's "Bernarda Alba." "We really don't have Latino directors who
can fulfill the needs of a city like L.A.?" he asked. He enjoyed
South Coast Repertory's recent Latino-themed "California Scenarios"
but called it "naive," adding, "We did that [kind of work] in the
'70s." A South Coast spokesman declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   However, he looks forward to the Taper's productions of "Chavez
Ravine" by the Chicano trio Culture Clash and "Living Out," Lisa
Loomer's play about Eastside nannies and their Westside employers,
scheduled for next year, not only because they're Latino plays but
also because he has worked with Culture Clash and Loomer.</TE>
<TE>   Luis Alfaro, who with Diane Rodriguez replaced Valenzuela as head
of the Taper's Latino wing and now also has the title of associate
producer of new play development at the Taper, pointed out that the
Taper's subscription seasons weren't totally devoid of Latino work
after Valenzuela left, citing Oliver Mayer's "Blade to the Heat" in
1996, which was accompanied by an attempt to reach younger and more
suburban Latino audiences, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Alfaro disagrees with Valenzuela's go-it-alone approach. "In my
vision," he said, "we're at the table with everybody else. I have to
be immersed not only in my own issues but in everybody else's." He
said Valenzuela's attitude is indicative of "why we haven't grown as
Latino artists."</TE>
<TE>   Specifically regarding "Bernarda Alba," Alfaro said he had heard
from Latinos questioning the multicultural approach, and he
understood their frustration--"of course there are many Latinas who
could have done those roles. But it was a very strong directorial
choice to address the plight of women on all levels." Alfaro said he
had learned a lot from "Alba" director Chay Yew.</TE>
<TE>   Cross-cultural theater can be a difficult challenge, however.
Carmen Zapata, producing director of Bilingual Foundation of the
Arts, which specializes in Spanish-language classics including the
just-opened "The Mayor of Zalamea," said the group's productions in
Spanish outdraw its productions of the same plays in English, 3 to 1.
"We need to share the beauty of our literature with as many people as
we can," she said, "but we don't get the response from the
non-Spanish audience that we'd like."</TE>
<TE>   Her company's cutbacks, which include a drop in the annual budget
from $1 million to $800,000 and a paring of the staff from 12 to
seven, are due to corporate and foundation belt-tightening in the
current economic crunch, she said. "We used to be very lucky to be
smiled on by major corporations. They're not smiling now."</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Velasco, president of the Ricardo Montalban Nosotros
Foundation that runs the Doolittle Theatre in Hollywood, believes in
cross-cultural experiences. He said he doesn't want his eventual
audience or his theater's bill of fare to be all Latino, even though
its primary mission is to promote and present Latino arts.</TE>
<TE>   But the Doolittle, with 1,000 seats and no guaranteed subscription
audience, is a relatively expensive place to do a show, compared with
the many smaller sites in town, he said. And the failure of "Selena"
in 2001 intimidated some prospective producers, he added.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, Velasco said, the Montalban Foundation is
concentrating its efforts on restoring the facade of the theater to
something approximating its original look, at a cost of at least
$250,000, and the production schedule is on hold, preventing
immediate bookings.</TE>
<TE>   Velasco blamed the failure of "Selena" on its lack of marketing
and publicity resources. Alfaro, however, said "Selena" wasn't good
enough. "I believed its politics. I didn't believe its art," he said.
"There has to be a sense of virtuosity."</TE>
<TE>   That's another reason why Latino artists sometimes turn to the
resources and experience of larger, mainstream institutions, and why
play development workshops, such as a just-completed program the
Taper sponsored for young Latino playwrights at the Lee Strasberg
Center, might help.</TE>
<TE>   Regular theatergoing is more important in many foreign Latin
cultures, where tickets are cheaper and companies often subsidized,
than it is in Latino communities within the United States, Alfaro
said. This may explain why Teatro Los Pinos in South Gate draws big
crowds from the ranks of recent immigrants to its Spanish-language
entertainments and light comedies.</TE>
<TE>   Simon Lopez has operated Los Pinos for 17 years, almost totally
unobserved by the non-Spanish-speaking world. His shows often feature
the stars of Mexican telenovelas, such as Armando Araiza, Manuel
Falco Ibanez and Pablo Cheng in "Las Apariencias Enganan," through
next Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Velasco and Valenzuela said they had attended shows at Los Pinos.
But Velasco said the Los Pinos shows, with their suggestive innuendos
and themes, probably wouldn't work at the Doolittle--especially when
it's renamed after the group's inspiration and benefactor, actor
Ricardo Montalban.</TE>
<TE>   Valenzuela drew an analogy with Latino music. He said the Spanish
speakers who go to Los Pinos are much more interested in the Mexican
star Luis Miguel than in the Mexican American, L.A.-based Los Lobos.
But Valenzuela wants to create a theater that's comparable to Los
Lobos. "This city," he said, "needs to give stature to the Latino
culture that's evolving here, every day."</TE>

<DH>With 'Sweet Home Alabama,' Reese Witherspoon is poised to
leapfrog to the top of the A-list of women who can carry a film</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Unless you know the back story, it would be easy to underestimate the
tiny figure walking through the door of Ubon restaurant in the
Beverly Center. At 1:30 p.m. on a Monday, she's dressed in what she
calls her uniform: jeans, sneakers, zip-up sweatshirt and baseball
cap. None of the scattered customers looks up to see her greet the
waitresses and wave to the cooks.</LD>
<LD>   Just like the feisty sorority-girl-turned-legal-eagle she played
in "Legally Blonde," Reese Witherspoon is more than the outside world
might think. At 26, the Tennessee native is polite and unpretentious,
a family-first wife and mother. She is also the new princess of the
box office and a serious supervisor of her own career. By inhabiting
over-the-top characters ("Pleasantville," "Election" and especially
"Legally Blonde") and making them angelic-looking, ferociously
determined and hilariously unaware, she has become that rare
Hollywood commodity: a young bankable actress.</LD>
<LD>   "Although we have produced great comediennes, we haven't produced
a lot of them," says film scholar Jeanine Basinger, author of "A
Woman's View: How Hollywood Spoke to Women" (Knopf, 1993).
Witherspoon has emerged from the pack of young starlets and moved
into position to become a major player, she says.</LD>
<TE>   Veterans like Gwyneth Paltrow, Cameron Diaz and even Julia
Roberts, have "hit the ceiling," she says, meaning in a business that
replaces people at an increasingly rapid rate, they've been around
long enough to start fading. (See related story, Page 16.) Younger
starlets like Kate Hudson and Katie Holmes don't yet  have the
stature to carry a film alone. In contrast, Witherspoon is fresh,
funny and has a future.</TE>
<TE>   "She's probably as hot an actress as there is out there now," says
Paul Dergarabedian, president of the box-office tracking firm
Exhibitor Relations Co. "And she has the acting chops to back it up.
All she needs is a few more hits under her belt."</TE>
<TE>   Which is why this weekend is a crucial one for Witherspoon's
career. Disney's "Sweet Home Alabama," heavily promoted with
advertising showing her face alone, will test her box-office clout.
Witherspoon stars in the more traditional romantic comedy, which
opened Friday on 3,000 screens, as a successful New York fashion
designer torn between a rich fiance (Patrick Dempsey) and a secret
redneck husband (Josh Lucas) back home. (Early reviews of the film
were mixed.) She is also about to reprise her best-known character,
Elle Woods, the Harvard Law School Barbie, in MGM's "Legally Blonde
2: Red, White and Blonde," a sequel that follows Woods, now a
corporate lawyer, to Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Her reported $5-million salary for "Sweet Home" will jump anywhere
from $12 million to $15 million, sources say, for "Red, White and
Blonde." If "Sweet Home Alabama" hits big, it would prove to
Hollywood that "Legally Blonde" was no fluke and confirm Witherspoon
as an A-list star.</TE>
<TE>   The keystone of her popularity lies in the fact that Witherspoon
was not a studio-produced phenomenon sold to the public, Basinger
says. "The audience found her. That is always authentic stardom. It
was not given to her, nor did it happen overnight."</TE>
<TE>   Witherspoon has been working in the industry for more than half
her life, appearing in TV shows and in more than a dozen films. She's
played a foulmouthed teen killer in "Freeway" (1996), a nasty
mini-mart hostage in "S.W.F." (1994) and a savvy virgin in "Cruel
Intentions" (1999) (notable also because she co-starred with
husband-to-be Ryan Phillippe). But it was through comedy that she
became a breakout star. As Tracy Flick, the cute overachiever with
the square-jawed determination of a Marine, Witherspoon stole
"Election" and helped make the smart satire a critical (if not
commercial) smash. "Legally Blonde," another comedy (though broader
than "Election"), grossed a surprising $96.5 million and created a
franchise for her character, Elle Woods. A pilot for a TV series
based on the character was turned down by ABC because, says a source
who asked not to be named, "There's only one Reese Witherspoon."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Witherspoon has never considered herself a comic. "I don't
ever try to be funny," she says. "I think that's death to comedy. The
second you start thinking you're funny or start laughing at your own
jokes, you're in trouble."</TE>
<TE>   She learned she was funny only after she played a wild-child
killer who earns the respect of homicide detectives in "Freeway"--and
made people laugh. "I thought I was giving a really great dramatic
performance," she says. "People said, 'You're really funny.' I was
like, 'Oh, right! I meant to do that. It's all part of my plan!' "</TE>
<TE>   Witherspoon follows in the hallowed tradition of the "smart dumb
blond," typified by Carole Lombard and Judy Holliday, Basinger says.
"The person who can make you laugh and can handle being laughed at
without losing any dignity or any glamour."</TE>
<TE>   Witherspoon updates the character in that she no longer has to be
devious, Basinger says. Educated and sophisticated, young women today
don't necessarily look to her as a role model, but rather identify
with the concept of a female who can be attractive, can go shopping,
like trivial things and still be a star. "It's not either-or. She can
be both dumb and smart. Beautiful and not beautiful. She can shop and
wear tight clothes and still be a top student. She will not let
people judge her by surfaces.</TE>
<TE>   "The college girls I know like that she has power over her own
destiny," she says. In her own life, Witherspoon is a shrewd steward
of her own career. Her team includes William Morris agent Steve
Dontanville, a manager and a publicist. Two years ago Witherspoon
founded her own production company, Type A Films, named for the
nickname her mother bestowed on her bossy daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "There aren't that many great scripts out there," she says
matter-of-factly. After the success with comedy, she says she doesn't
expect people to see her in any other way. "Only I know what I'm
capable of, and I see it myself in my own mind. So, I'm feeling
frustrated, going, 'Why isn't there that kind of role?' I just
realized at a certain point I had to create it."</TE>
<TE>   Many successful actors begin their own production companies, some
considered vanity projects whose mission is to develop roles for the
star alone. The more serious companies also look for material for
others, some agents say.</TE>
<TE>   Witherspoon's producing partner, Jennifer Simpson, says they look
for stories that offer smart, complex roles. "We're looking for
vehicles for Reese to star in that are not necessarily romantic
comedies. She's into finding movies that can offer strong role models
to young women," Simpson says. So along with a comedy about tennis,
and an adaptation of Melissa Bank's feminist empowerment novel "A
Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing," Type A Films is also developing
a drama about turn-of-the-century suffragettes. Witherspoon is trying
to expand her range in other ways; she recently landed the starring
role in "Vanity Fair," an independent remake of Thackeray's classic
novel of 19th century London social climber Becky Sharp to be
directed by Mira Nair ("Monsoon Wedding") and released next year.
(Witherspoon has read the novel, her publicist said.)</TE>
<TE>   She's already acquainted with the milieu after playing a
love-struck Englishwoman in the most recent version of Oscar Wilde's
"The Importance of Being Earnest" that was released by Miramax
earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a dream come true for me," she says about working with Nair.
"Now, I'm in a position where, gosh, she can make a film with me, and
I can help her get it financed." Without a big-name star, Nair was
having trouble getting the money she needed to make the film,
Witherspoon explains. "It's important to have somebody who means
something on the box-office charts. I never knew movies worked that
way until this year."</TE>
<TE>   "Red, White and Blonde" will be her first outing as an executive
producer. She and producer Marc Platt have chosen a director
("Kissing Jessica Stein's" Charles Herman-Wurmfeld) and are
collaborating on script ideas and casting. "It's exciting for me. To
be able to call people and say, 'I think you're the greatest. Will
you please come work with me?' It's a new moment in my life."</TE>
<TE>   However, Witherspoon may be risking her audience when she moves
away from the heightened comedy of "Legally Blonde."</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody appreciated Meryl Streep when she's done comedies,"
Basinger says. "I hope she has more luck crossing over into [serious]
roles than Julia Roberts did with things like 'Mary Reilly.' A lot
will depend on the material she picks."</TE>
<TE>   Elle Woods was a smart dumb blond. Tracy Flick was a smart smart
blond. As a more traditional romantic comedy, "Sweet Home Alabama"
will present another sort of test for the actress. As Manhattan
fashion designer Melanie, her edges have been sanded down, leaving
her not quite as dumb, not quite as smart.</TE>
<TE>   Witherspoon, 5 feet 2, is a study in delicate, sturdy dignity. Her
manner is reserved and dutiful at first, her voice girlishly soft and
pleasant. She will speak Southern on demand. Her giant sparkly blue
eyes--once seriously nearsighted, but corrected by laser surgery--are
set in a flawless face, graced only with a little lip gloss.</TE>
<TE>   It's a package that can make struggling actresses nearly suicidal.
The keys to succeeding in Hollywood, she would tell them in a manner
that brings Tracy Flick to mind, are perseverance, endurance and
resilience. "You have to be able to tolerate a lot of rejection and
still have your self-worth intact. Sometimes I meet people and I
think I don't know how they've made it this long when they're soooooo
fragile. You have to be determined, to be very clear about what are
your good points, what are your bad points. Focus on the positive
aspects of your personality and be realistic about yourself."</TE>
<TE>   She was turned down for roles in "Cape Fear" and "Romeo &amp; Juliet"
that went to Juliette Lewis and Claire Danes, respectively. She's
also tried to protect her talent by not squandering it on
insubstantial movies. She turned down roles in "Scream" (1996) and
"Urban Legend" (1998). Whenever she's deciding whether to take a job,
she reminds herself that the film's ideas and her image will be on
film forever. "It's going to be on digital or video the rest of my
life, my child's life. It's not a flip decision I'm making, you
know?"</TE>
<TE>   On the set, she'll argue points. "It's hard to force Reese
Witherspoon to do something," says "Cruel Intentions" director Roger
Kumble, discussing the film on the DVD.</TE>
<TE>   In "Legally Blonde," she considered some lines too crass for Elle
Woods to say. "She was very strong about her point of view," Platt
says. "At the end of the day, she turned out to be 100% right. The
lines were very funny, but in the context of the movie and the
character she had in mind, it didn't fit the film."</TE>
<TE>   In "Sweet Home Alabama," Witherspoon was "ready to marry the comic
performer she was getting to be known for with the dramatic actress
she's been the past 10 years," says "Sweet Home" director Andy
Tennant, who worked with Witherspoon 10 years ago on a TV movie,
"Desperate Choices," in which she played a 15-year-old leukemia
victim. In "Sweet Home," she delivers a 45-second monologue that
starts with a grin and ends in tears. "It's not just the crying," he
says. "You can see all her thoughts. I didn't cut it. I wanted
everyone to see her performance."</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in Nashville, the privileged second child of a surgeon
and a nursing professor, Witherspoon says her parents supported her
early ambitions to be an actress with lessons and nontraditional
expectations. "Being a Southern eccentric was the big influence in my
family. [The standard was] How weird can you be?" At Harpeth Hall, an
all-girls private high school in Nashville, she was also encouraged
to think outside the steel magnolia box, and was formed, she says, by
assignments to spend a month studying newscasters or lawyers in their
work environments.</TE>
<TE>   Still, she says she was naive when she arrived in Hollywood at 14.
"Even though you can be mature, I don't think you have the emotional
maturity to deal with a lot of the situations you're put in," she
says. "You have to deal with a lot of adult personalities, you have
to negotiate."</TE>
<TE>   Referring specifically to male attention, she says, "There are a
lot of ulterior motivations that you don't necessarily understand
when you're 14 years old. It's every young woman's experience. It's
just hard to do it in a professional context," she says. "I won't let
my daughter get in the business until she's 18 years old."</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, Witherspoon also regrets leaving Stanford after her
freshman year to take a small part in "Twilight" (1998) with Paul
Newman and Gene Hackman. "I don't feel as knowledgeable or as
educated as I'd like to be," she says. "When I'm around very
well-educated people, I feel embarrassed, or inferior, you know." She
would like to return to school, resuming her English major, when her
children are grown, she says.</TE>
<TE>   Witherspoon's handlers had warned that the actress would not talk
about her personal life. Her husband, who stars in the current dark
comic film "Igby Goes Down," recently revealed on a radio program
that their sex life had suffered under the strain of parenting their
3-year-old daughter Ava. He went on to describe details and disclose
they were both in therapy.</TE>
<TE>   Reportedly upset with him, Witherspoon, however, spoke only in the
neutral to glowing terms she has always used to describe their
marriage. "We've grown up together. We met when I was 21. I'm a lot
different than I was at that age. He's a lot different from when he
was 22," she says. "I didn't have as much responsibility. There's
more pressure on me."</TE>
<TE>   She hopes to have more children. Family life--the sort with 8 p.m.
bedtimes and dogs and non-industry friends and barbecues in their
Tudor home in Los Angeles--grounds her, and keeps her from spinning
out into the "disorienting hyperbole" of celebrity and fame, she
says.</TE>
<TE>   Judging by colleagues' accounts of her highly organized and
disciplined lifestyle, she could write a manual of how to juggle
family and work. "She is extremely professional on the set. Even
before the camera rolls, you will see her on her mark, reciting her
lines," Platt says. "At the same time, she always makes sure to
allocate time in the day when it's possible to visit with her
daughter. There are times when Reese says, 'I'm here for the hours
you need me to be, but I've got to get going tonight. It's our
anniversary and we're going out to dinner.' "</TE>
<TE>   As the lunch at Ubon concludes, Witherspoon takes off her cap and
tosses her blond hair. The veneer melts only slightly as she says she
wants her future to include movies of all sorts, big popcorn movies,
little arty movies, "if they let me." If they let her?</TE>
<TE>   "This moment is not forever," she says. "Everything in this
business is evanescent. Whatever you have this week could disappear a
year from now."</TE>
<TE>   She thanks the waitress and exits the restaurant on Beverly
Boulevard. She tells me to take the escalator to the parking lot, not
the street-level entrance. "I don't want you walking there," she
says, "there's too much traffic."</TE>
<TE>   Then, after checking both ways, she lopes gracefully across the
busy street.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: In a recent column you wrote about a pilot project that
requires property owners to give tenants 60-day notices to move out
of rental properties in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Does this apply to properties in the city that are not under rent
control, such as the single-family house that I rent out? Am I
required to give a 60-day notice or is a 30-day notice legal?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: The 60-day notice-to-move requirement applies to all
residential rental properties in the cities of Los Angeles, Santa
Monica and West Hollywood.</LD>
<TE>   Under a new state law, the 60-day notice requirement will apply to
all of California as of Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Building Exempted</TE>
<TE>   From Rent Control</TE>
<TE>   Q: I rent an apartment in downtown Los Angeles and I am trying to
determine whether it is under rent control. Although the building was
built in the 1920s, it has been used only for residential purposes
since the '80s. The landlord says rent control does not apply to this
building. Is he right?</TE>
<TE>   A: The landlord probably is right. In order to keep investors
motivated to build new apartment buildings in Los Angeles, the City
Council exempted new construction from the rent control law.</TE>
<TE>   New construction is defined under the law as that for which a
Certificate of Occupancy was first issued after Oct. 1, 1978.</TE>
<TE>   If the building wasn't used for residential purposes until the
1980s, the unit is exempt from rent control.</TE>
<TE>   Security Deposit Use Is Limited by the Law</TE>
<TE>   Q: I rented an apartment in Burbank. When the lease expired and I
moved out, the owner refunded my deposit but he deducted $125 for
painting, $110 for a scratched counter top, $75 for cleaning and $100
to replace the vinyl flooring. I checked the lease agreement and none
of these deductions were mentioned. What can I do?</TE>
<TE>   A: Under state law, security deposits can be used for three
things: rent, cleaning and damages that exceed "normal wear and tear"
(which also includes things like lost keys or remotes). Since they
are covered by state law, deductions of the type you describe do not
need to be specified in the lease.</TE>
<TE>   All of the charges you mention seem reasonable. You don't say
whether you damaged the vinyl flooring, requiring its replacement. If
you did, the $100 charge probably is reasonable. If not, you may be
entitled to a refund.</TE>
<TE>   If you deserve the refund and the owner won't give it to you, you
can sue in Small Claims Court.</TE>
<TE>   Deposit Not at Risk for Month-to-Month Tenant</TE>
<TE>   Q: I signed a one-year lease in June 2000, but it has never been
renewed. Now I'm looking to move before June 2003. I have been told
that since the lease was not renewed, I am renting on a
month-to-month basis. Is this true or will moving jeopardize my
security deposit?</TE>
<TE>   A: Under state law, your lease automatically reverts to a
month-to-month agreement if it is not renewed by the owner.</TE>
<TE>   You, as a tenant, are not required to give the owners a 60-day
notice to vacate. You are only required to give the owner a 30-day
written notice of your intent to move.</TE>
<TE>   If the lease had been renewed, your security deposit would have
been in jeopardy by an early move.</TE>

<HD>Insider's Secrets to Home Buying</HD>
<DH>"Home Buying Without the BS," by Todd Thornton (Hall Street
Press, Nashville, 2002), $14.95, 229 pages.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT J. BRUSS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you are a serious home buyer, read "Home Buying Without the BS."
This unconventional how-to book by real estate broker Todd Thornton
shares important insights that usually aren't addressed by books or
buyer's agents.</LD>
<LD>   In the chapter titled "Those Sneaky Agents," the author explains
tricks a few agents use on buyers. He emphasizes how some, but
thankfully not all, realty agents mislead their buyers. This chapter
alone is worth the book's modest price.</LD>
<LD>   One technique, which Thornton calls "using a dog to sell a doll,"
involves showing two undesirable houses before showing the best one,
the "dollhouse." By comparing asking prices rather than actual sales
prices, the author says some agents get buyers to make high purchase
offers. Thornton warns buyers to insist on seeing MLS data on recent
sales prices rather than asking prices for comparable homes.</LD>
<TE>   When it comes to financing a home purchase, the author recommends
beginning the quest on the Internet. He reasons that is the best way
to compare current offerings of many lenders, even if you want to
obtain your mortgage from a local lender's office.</TE>
<TE>   Although this new book is far from perfect, it offers a different
approach to home buying. The author's experience as a real estate
agent, broker, auctioneer and instructor provides a broad
perspective.</TE>
<TE>   However, the book could have been made more relevant with some
personal experiences rather than generalized advice.</TE>
<TE>   A fun feature of the book is Thornton's "real estate speak"
interpretation of real estate terminology.</TE>
<TE>   Examples include "dollhouse," only enough room for Barbie; "lots
of upgrades," please pay for the previous owner's mistakes;
"secluded," you're lucky if your agent can find it; and "close to
major roads," hope you're not allergic to exhaust fumes.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the book's most valuable topic is how buyers should make a
purchase offer. The author recommends obtaining and studying a copy
of the purchase offer printed form long before finding a home to buy.
That way, he suggests, you'll understand what you're signing.</TE>
<TE>   This book will never win a prize for great writing. But it does
offer solid advice for buyers, with practical tips such as: "Don't
talk bad about the seller's property; they need to like you"; "never
tell your agent that you will increase your offer"; "move on if the
sellers are not realistic; they won't change"; and "life does not end
if you don't purchase a particular house; there are always other
homes to buy."</TE>
<TE>   A valuable feature is the lists of real estate Web sites scattered
throughout the book. Although many of the sites are well known,
others are either new or relatively unknown. Internet users will
value these sources, which provide profitable additional information,
especially for home searches and finding comparable home sales
prices.</TE>
<TE>   This is an enjoyable, easy read for first-time home buyers. The
book highlights virtually all the considerations buyers need to
remember but too often forget.</TE>

<HD>Don't Let Friend Get in the Way of Inspection</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT J. BRUSS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: We have the opportunity to buy a house at a good price from
a friend. She will carry the difference between our down payment and
the sales price in a first mortgage.</LD>
<LD>   As first-time buyers, we are intimidated by the process. Is it a
good move to buy from a friend, considering the house is in a good
location and school district? Are there pitfalls?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: In your superb situation, don't give the seller time to
change her mind.</LD>
<TE>   You are fortunate to have a friend who will sell to you at a fair
price, without competition from other eager buyers. She saves the
realty agent's sales commission, so she benefits too.</TE>
<TE>   But one condition you should insist upon is a home inspection.
Politely ask your friend if it's all right to have a professional
inspection. Be sure to accompany your inspector to discuss any
serious defects in the residence.</TE>
<TE>   Presuming all goes well with the inspection, get your home
purchase closed as quickly as possible before the seller changes her
mind.</TE>
<TE>   Selling Below Market Value Carries No Penalty</TE>
<TE>   Q: If I sell my house to a good friend for less than its market
value, is there a tax penalty for me?</TE>
<TE>   A: No. No law requires you to sell your home for its full market
value. If your net profit from your principal residence sale is below
$250,000 ($500,000 if you're married and filing a joint tax return),
your entire profit is tax-free. For details, consult your tax
advisor.</TE>
<TE>   Stealing Property Is Not as Easy as It Sounds</TE>
<TE>   Q: I bought my home last April. My new neighbor claims he has a
prescriptive easement for his landscaping, garden and lawn over part
of my property. He is suing me, but the burden of proof is on him.
What evidence will I need to fight? He has paid no taxes on my
property. I had my property resurveyed. What should I do?</TE>
<TE>   A: Stealing part of a neighbor's property with a prescriptive
easement isn't as easy as it sounds.</TE>
<TE>   For your neighbor to prove his entitlement to part of your
property, he must show his occupancy was open, notorious and hostile
(meaning, without permission) against the previous owner. Property
tax payment is not required (though such possession of an entire
property requires tax payment, but that's not your problem).</TE>
<TE>   Hire an experienced local real estate attorney to defend your
case. Chances are your neighbor won't be able to prove in court all
the required prescriptive easement elements for the minimum number of
years (as few as five years in California or as many as 30 in Texas).</TE>
<TE>   Children Worry About Their Home Inheritance</TE>
<TE>   Q: My elderly parents are selling their home because they plan to
buy a condo. This is their only major asset. Their will states that
my sister and I will receive their assets upon their death.</TE>
<TE>   Does it make sense that their condo will be titled as "joint
tenants with right of survivorship" without mention of our names? If
my parents need to take out a small mortgage to buy the condo, and my
sister and I have to co-sign to help them qualify, does this make us
part-owners of the condo? I presume we would not want to be on the
title because, as you often say, it is better to inherit property
than to receive it as a gift before death.</TE>
<TE>   A: Although you are named as heirs in your parents' wills, that
has no effect on how they take title to the condo they're purchasing.</TE>
<TE>   Joint tenancy with right of survivorship means the surviving joint
tenant owns the property in his or her name alone. When that
surviving joint tenant dies, title to the condo passes according to
his or her will. By then, the surviving joint tenant might have
willed the condo to someone other than you and your sister.</TE>
<TE>   If your parents need help qualifying for a mortgage to buy the
condo, and you help them by co-signing on the mortgage, most lenders
also will require you to be on the title as a co-owner. This is
usually not considered a gift, although it could be if an IRS auditor
should challenge the situation.</TE>
<TE>   To learn more, consult your tax advisor.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone Needs a Will That Covers Property</TE>
<TE>   Q: I have owned my house for eight years. My ex-husband and I
bought it together, and I bought him out when we divorced. I recently
remarried, but I would not allow my new husband's name to be put on
the deed. Together we took out a new mortgage and are making a major
addition to the home.</TE>
<TE>   If something happens to me, will he automatically become the owner
of my home? I have no will and no children. However, my husband has a
19-year-old son. If we both die, does his son automatically inherit
the house?</TE>
<TE>   A: Everyone needs a will to distribute assets after death. Without
a will, state law determines who receives your assets. Better yet,
you need a living trust to avoid probate court costs and delays for
your major assets, such as your home, when you pass on.</TE>
<TE>   I'm surprised you could obtain a new home mortgage without adding
your new husband to the home's title. If he signed the mortgage
papers, I'll bet the lender required that he add his name to the
title.</TE>
<TE>   As for your husband's 19-year-old son, if you both die at the same
time, such as in a plane crash, and if you don't have a will or any
other relatives, your assets could go to that son, depending on
specific details. The solution is for you and your husband to have
wills, plus a living trust to avoid probate.</TE>
<TE>   Time Has Expired for Tax-Deferred Exchange</TE>
<TE>   Q: Fourteen months ago, we sold a single-family rental house and
carried back the mortgage for our buyer. Now our buyer plans to sell
the house. Is it too late to use a Starker tax-deferred exchange to
avoid tax on the sale of this rental property? We would use the
proceeds from our mortgage payoff to buy another rental property.</TE>
<TE>   A: It's too late to "undo" the sale of your rental property to
create a Starker tax-deferred exchange.</TE>
<TE>   When you sold the rental house, you should have had the sales
proceeds held by a third party, such as a bank trust department. You
then would have had 45 days to designate a "like kind" rental
property, such as another rental house, to avoid profit tax.</TE>
<TE>   Since you received the cash proceeds from the rental house sale,
it's too late to make a tax-deferred exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Seller Should Hire Firm to Contain Radon</TE>
<TE>   Q: We recently put our home on the market. The house is only 2
years old and in mint condition. But the buyer's radon inspection
showed a high radon level. The buyer rescinded the sale because the
house didn't pass inspection. How can a new home have a high radon
level, and what can we do about it?</TE>
<TE>   A: Depending on your home's construction, there are several ways
to contain radon, which is a naturally occurring environmental hazard
in many parts of the nation.</TE>
<TE>   When you purchased your fairly new house, you probably didn't
think to have it checked for radon. If the builder knew, he obviously
didn't disclose it and might not have had a legal obligation to do
so.</TE>
<TE>   Radon is thought to possibly cause cancer in home occupants, but
the evidence is questionable. To make your home salable, your best
alternative is to ask the radon inspector for referrals to firms that
specialize in containing radon.</TE>
<TE>   Consult Broker to Find Best Homeowners Policy</TE>
<TE>   Q: My father recently passed away, and I inherited his house.
There is no mortgage. What is the best way to obtain a homeowners
insurance policy? The house is vacant. My current homeowners insurer
(State Farm) is not issuing new homeowners policies in my area. What
is the best way for me to handle this second home situation?</TE>
<TE>   A: Many homeowners insurance companies are refusing to renew
policies for customers who have had recent claims, and they are
refusing to issue new homeowners insurance policies, as well. State
Farm is in this group.</TE>
<TE>   Many insurance companies are still issuing new policies, though
not at bargain rates. You should contact an experienced, independent
insurance broker who can probably obtain competitive rates for the
policy you need.</TE>

<HD>Law Tackles Defects in Construction</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE WEDNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After months of negotiations between builders, trial lawyers and
legislative leaders, Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation Sept. 20 that
overhauls the state's construction defects laws.</LD>
<LD>   The new law defines defects and spells out builder and homeowner
obligations. It also lays out pre-litigation, inspection and
right-to-repair procedures, and defines the rules of litigation.</LD>
<LD>   While both sides in the construction-defect debate said they
compromised heavily to get the legislation passed, they also agreed
that all stand to benefit from the new law, which will go into effect
Jan. 1.</LD>
<TE>   Under the terms of the measure, sponsored by state Sen. John
Burton (D-San Francisco) and Assemblyman Herb Wesson (D-Culver City),
a builder has 14 days to acknowledge receipt of a homeowner's
complaint, and must complete repairs within 120 days of the owner's
acceptance of the builder's offer to make the repairs.</TE>
<TE>   "Builders are happy because they have an absolute right to get
into the home and repair the alleged violation," said Jeffrey
Masters, an attorney at Cox, Castle &amp; Nicholson, a firm that
represents builders.</TE>
<TE>   Builders have complained that often the first time they hear about
a defect is when they're slapped with a lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowners advocates are pleased that the legislation now will
define much more clearly what a defect is, from water-intrusion
guidelines to fire-protection and plumbing issues.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowners also will still be able to sue builders if they find
additional defects after a repair, said attorney Thomas E. Miller, a
Newport Beach construction-defect expert. "We like that homeowners
can now recover 100% of the damages from defects in their homes,"
Miller said. "Now homeowners can get their home fixed, and the
builder is held responsible."</TE>
<TE>   Construction defect lawsuits have proliferated in the last decade,
resulting in a big drop, particularly, in construction of new
multifamily units. It is hoped that the new law will reverse that
trend.</TE>

<HD>Cutting Costs or Corners?</HD>
<DH>Discount brokerages take a thinner slice of a home's sales
price, but critics say they offer a smaller helping of service</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF BERTOLUCCI</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you're paying a real estate agent a 6% commission to sell your
house, you're offering too much. Five percent? Still too high. And if
you're parting with (shudder) 7% of the sales price, you might as
well tattoo "chump" on your forehead.</LD>
<LD>   Or so the growing legion of discount real estate brokerages, which
promise to sell your home for fees ranging from 1% to 4 1/2% of the
selling price, would have you believe.</LD>
<LD>   Discount brokerages aren't new, a fact that any conventional real
estate agent will quickly point out. Help-U-Sell, for instance, which
bases its commission on the number of "services" it provides its
clients, has been around since 1976.</LD>
<TE>   And because commissions are always negotiable, savvy sellers can
often talk agents down from their customary fees. Traditionally,
conventional brokerages such as Century 21, Coldwell Banker and
Re/Max charge commissions ranging from 5% to 7%, with the fee split
evenly between the buyer's and seller's agents.</TE>
<TE>   But there's nervous chatter among real estate professionals these
days about a potential decline in commissions. The Internet has made
information previously available only to licensed agents, such as
homes for sale in a specific city or neighborhood, accessible to
anyone with a PC and modem. As a result, clients are doing much of
the selling-and-buying research themselves and seeking reduced
commissions in return.</TE>
<TE>   The lure of a discount agent is particularly enticing in Southern
California's overheated real estate market, where a home can sell in
one day. Some sellers wonder why they paid 6% for what seems to them
like so little work.</TE>
<TE>   "I sold my house for $825,000, and when you talk about 6% of that,
that's too much," said Danny Bautista, who paid CataList Homes, a
low-commission brokerage in the South Bay, a 3% total commission to
sell his Palos Verdes Peninsula home. Because a standard residential
real estate sale in the South Bay involves a 5% commission, Bautista
saved $16,500.</TE>
<TE>   Internet-based discounters such as eRealty.com and zipRealty offer
to sell homes at a percentage point or two below the going rate in
specific U.S. markets, including Southern California. And CataList
Homes markets its services with billboards and other advertising that
play off sellers' distaste for paying customary commissions.</TE>
<TE>   "Homes in the South Bay that would sell for $300,000 five years
ago are now selling for $600,000," said CataList Homes Chief
Marketing Officer Michael Davin. "You wonder why agents, who were
happy charging 5% five years ago, want 5% today."</TE>
<TE>   It gets even better (for sellers) and worse (for traditional real
estate agents): Discounters say they offer the same services as the
old guard--open houses, advertising, even posting on the multiple
listing service, or MLS, a directory of local homes for sale that
agents use to find properties for their clients.</TE>
<TE>   Even on a moderately priced home, a reduced commission can mean
huge savings for the seller. For instance, a 6% fee on a $300,000
home costs the seller $18,000, whereas a 3% commission cuts the fee
to $9,000. The savings can make a difference for sellers who don't
have a lot of equity in their homes and need every dollar to put
toward their next home purchase.</TE>
<TE>   Conventional brokerages are typically dismissive of discounters,
claiming reduced-fee agents offer fewer services and shortchange
their clients by taking on more home listings than they can handle to
compensate for the lower fees.</TE>
<TE>   "They have to work on a volume basis, and when you do more volume,
your service gets spread thin," said Greg Whilden, a real estate
broker at the Real Estate Group in Torrance.</TE>
<TE>   However, Bautista believes the service he received from CataList
Homes was "basically the same" as that provided by a conventional
real estate agent.</TE>
<TE>   But another CataList Homes customer, Lori Rubin of San Pedro,
thought the agency cut corners when showing her $489,000 house, which
didn't sell after three months on the market.</TE>
<TE>   CataList Homes offers a 1.5% fee to the buyer's agent in a region
where 2.5% is the norm. As a result, some sellers fear that South Bay
agents may deliberately ignore CataList Homes' listings.</TE>
<TE>   To CataList Homes' Davin, those fears are the result of rival
agents trying to scare sellers into using a conventional agent. He
said that 88% of CataList's home sales involve buyers' agents. "If
they're all boycotting our listings, how would we do business?" Davin
asked rhetorically.</TE>
<TE>   "People said [my home] would not be sold by other brokers, but I
didn't experience that," Bautista said. "My house sold very quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Rubin, however, is convinced that CataList Homes' reduced
commission policy played a major role in the failed sale of her San
Pedro home. "I was told that many brokers will not go out of their
way to bring clients to a [CataList] home, knowing that their
commission is going to be significantly smaller," she said.</TE>
<TE>   To keep peace among their fellow real estate agents, and to move
their clients' homes as quickly as possible, most discounters offer a
standard 2.5% to 3% commission to buyers' agents.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Glickman, a discount Realtor based in Beverly Hills, also
sells homes for a 3% commission. But he keeps just half a percent of
that and gives 2.5% to the buyer's agent.</TE>
<TE>   "I work 35 to 40 communities [in Southern California], and in some
of them you can offer less than 2 1/2%," Glickman said. "But if you
do so in some areas, you won't have a broker look at the house."</TE>
<TE>   Some discounters promise to sell a home for 1%, but, in most
cases, that involves a single agent who deals directly with a buyer
or who manages the transaction for both parties. "We can't post a
home on the MLS and charge only 1% because you have to structure in
the pay of the other agent," said Cheryl Gober, president of
RealEstateRebates.tv, a discount brokerage in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Discounters cut fees in other ways too. For instance, Malibu-based
eCondo.com has a flat-fee structure in which its largest commission
is $10,000 (for sales above $1 million). And Dan Dobbs, a Realtor and
mortgage broker in Orange County, will sell your home free provided
you retain him as your agent on your purchase--at a standard 2.5% to
3% commission.</TE>
<TE>   Many conventional real estate agents react to discounters with
indifference. Corporate officials for Coldwell Banker and Re/Max
declined The Times' request for an interview, with a Coldwell Banker
spokesman dismissing discount brokerages as "niche players."</TE>
<TE>   The niche label does have some merit. Roughly 2% of home sales
nationwide are handled by discount brokerages, according to the
National Assn. of Realtors. And even CataList Homes' Davin said the
market share for discounters has been less than 1% historically.</TE>
<TE>   But many home sellers don't factor in historical considerations
when choosing an agent.</TE>
<TE>   "The buying and selling public looks at the importance and value
of a [real estate agent's] work and probably thinks 6% is a little
high," said eRealty Chief Executive Russell Capper.</TE>
<TE>   One thing is certain: In a hot real estate market, a reasonably
priced home in good condition will sell fast.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether they list it with the best real estate company in the
world or with Aunt Suzie," Glickman said, "the home's going to sell
in three days."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>If meteorologists' predictions are correct, warm El Nino ocean
currents will result in an abnormally heavy rainy season for 2002-03.
Governmental agencies are preparing to heed the warnings by clearing
flood basins, training emergency crews for flood rescues and
distributing sandbags in flood-prone areas.</LD>
<LD>   Even if the predictions do not materialize, Southland homeowners
should prepare by taking these steps:</LD>
<LD>   * Clear leaves and debris off the roof. Debris lodged in drainage
areas can cause damming that could result in a leak. Sweep debris out
of valleys, from behind chimneys and away from drains. Check the roof
every three to four weeks during the rainy season or after a major
rainstorm.</LD>
<TE>   * Inspect your gutters and downspouts for leaks by running water
from a hose into them and observing the runoff. Patch any small holes
by cleaning the inside with a wire brush and sealing with gutter
cement or silicone sealant. At the same time, remove any accumulated
debris in the gutters and downspouts. Check every three to four weeks
for debris buildup during the rainy season.</TE>
<TE>   * Check drains around your property for proper flow by running a
garden hose full force into them. If water backs up, contact a drain
cleaning specialist.</TE>
<TE>   * Take a close look at the roof surface. Look for cracks or
openings of any kind. Pay particular attention to areas where vents
or flashing comes through the roof surface or where there are joints.</TE>
<TE>   Cracks up to a quarter of an inch can usually be easily repaired
with silicone sealant. For larger openings, contact a roofing
company.</TE>
<TE>   If you notice missing or damaged shingles or roof tile, you may be
able to make repairs yourself by carefully removing the damaged
pieces, matching them at a local roofing supply house and replacing
them.</TE>
<TE>   Use care to avoid damaging the waterproof membrane just below the
surface when reinstalling the shingle or tile. Many building
suppliers sell sheet metal shingles designed for easy repair of
missing or damaged wood shingles.</TE>
<TE>   * Examine windows and wood trim around the home. If you see cracks
in the paint or in joints between surfaces, seal them by repainting
or recaulking.</TE>
<TE>   These areas are prone to leakage and/or dry rot damage. Check any
vertical wall surfaces above the roofline for cracks (for example, a
second-story wall above a first-story roof).</TE>
<TE>   * If you have a sump pump system, clean the pit and test its
operation by filling it with a garden hose.</TE>

<HD>Consumers on Their Own in Fee Fight</HD>
<DH>A federal court has ruled that class action no longer is an
option for buyers who want to challenge yield-spread premiums.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. HARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON--A federal court has dealt what may be the fatal blow to a
nationwide legal challenge against controversial fees collected by
mortgage brokers in connection with home-loan settlements.</LD>
<LD>   The fees are known as yield-spread premiums. Lenders routinely pay
them to mortgage brokers for delivering loans that carry higher rates
than the standard ones offered by the lender.</LD>
<LD>   Though commonplace features in home-purchase and refinancing
transactions, yield-spread premiums have a Jekyll-and-Hyde
reputation. In some instances, the fees are integral parts of
arrangements whereby a borrower agrees to pay a higher note rate in
exchange for the broker paying all or some of the closing costs.</LD>
<TE>   Such deals can be especially helpful to moderate-income and
first-time buyers who may not have cash on hand to pay the required
closing costs. Popular zero-cost refinancings also employ
yield-spread premiums.</TE>
<TE>   But when a broker leads an unsuspecting buyer into a mortgage with
a higher-than-necessary interest rate and receives thousands of
dollars from the lender for doing nothing but that, the borrower is
being abused. More to the point: The lender and broker are violating
federal law, which prohibits kickbacks and fees where no
settlement-related services are rendered to the consumer.</TE>
<TE>   But how does a home buyer or refinancer challenge a yield-spread
premium he or she believes to violate the law? The recent
precedent-setting decision by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
effectively removed one of the most powerful legal tools available to
consumers--class-action suits.</TE>
<TE>   The court accepted guidelines laid down by the Department of
Housing and Urban Development. In a policy statement last year, HUD
said the only way to gauge the legality of a yield-spread premium is
to examine whether goods and services were provided to the consumer
by the mortgage broker, and then to evaluate whether the "total
compensation paid to the broker is reasonably related" to the total
value of the goods and services provided in the transaction.</TE>
<TE>   HUD issued its guidelines after an explosion of yield-spread
class-action suit filings in federal courts across the country.
Nearly 200 suits alleged yield-spread premium abuses by dozens of
mortgage companies and banks. Most of the cases were brought by trial
attorneys who specialize in consumer class-action litigation and do
their work on a contingency-fee basis.</TE>
<TE>   The stakes in these cases were staggering. Large national lenders
were the targets of many of the class actions. The number of
potentially affected consumers ran into the hundreds of thousands,
and the mortgage industry estimated the potential payout liability
exceeded $100 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Under federal rules, giant classes of plaintiffs must be
"certified" before any action can proceed. One of the key tests for
certification is that the alleged wrongdoing suffered by all class
members must be roughly similar. An example would be a product with a
design defect that caused similar injuries to hundreds of consumers.</TE>
<TE>   But what about yield-spread premiums in mortgage transactions?
Before HUD's policy statement last year, some consumer advocates
believed the agency's rules would support class-action
certifications. After all, if thousands of borrowers were lured into
high-rate mortgages by brokers who received large fees from lenders,
weren't their financial injuries similar in nature?</TE>
<TE>   The 11th Circuit did in fact certify one class action--Culpepper
vs. Irwin Mortgage Corp.--based on that very rationale before the HUD
policy statement. But now, in cases involving First Union Mortgage
Corp., BankAmerica Corp. and Reliastar Mortgage Corp., the same court
reversed field and said HUD's policy deserves "deference" and should
be followed.</TE>
<TE>   That, in turn, makes class certifications difficult because the
policy says, in effect: You have to look at every borrower's
situation individually. What services were rendered by the broker?
How far out of line--if at all--was the broker's total compensation?</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers representing the mortgage industry were pleased with the
recent decision. Washington attorney Phillip L. Schulman said the
dozens of class-action suits were unfair "attempts to paint a
long-standing and legitimate practice as nefarious" in all instances.
San Francisco attorney Michael J. Agoglia called the decision "a
sword in the heart" for trial attorneys trying to squeeze giant
settlements out of lenders.</TE>
<TE>   But Neil Pope of Columbus, Ga., one of the lead attorneys
coordinating the class-action campaign, said the battle against the
fees will continue--"somehow."</TE>
<TE>   "The mark of a warrior," Pope said in a direct rejoinder to
industry lawyers, "is that he can fight on even with a sword in his
heart."</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line: You can still sue your lender and broker if you
think you were victimized by a yield-spread premium. Just don't
expect to be part of a class action.</TE>

<LD>Singer Christina Aguilera has purchased a Beverly Hills-area home for
$2.75 million.</LD>
<LD>   The Grammy Award-winning pop star had been leasing the home with
an option to buy. The lease expired, and when she couldn't find
another home that she preferred, she bought the house, which has
spectacular city-to-ocean views.</LD>
<LD>   Built in the 1950s, the house also has three bedrooms and four
bathrooms in slightly more than 4,500 square feet. The master suite
has two bathrooms, two walk-in closets, an office and a gym.</LD>
<TE>   Among the other features are a library/den, state-of-the-art
kitchen, dining area, breakfast bar and a pool.</TE>
<TE>   Aguilera bought a newer and larger home in a nearby gated
community in January 2001 for about the same price, but she never
moved into it. She sold it before leasing the house she recently
purchased.</TE>
<TE>   A former member of the "New Mickey Mouse Club," Aguilera, now 21,
sang the hit song "Reflections" in the Disney movie "Mulan" (1998)
before releasing her debut album in 1999 with the hit single "Genie
in a Bottle." A year later, she won a best new artist Grammy Award.</TE>
<TE>   Her newest album, "Stripped" (RCA), is due out Oct. 29.</TE>

<TE>   Singer Engelbert Humperdinck has sold his Holmby Hills house as
part of a 10-acre compound that includes two other homes owned by an
international financier on his street, a cul-de-sac bordering the Los
Angeles Country Club.</TE>
<TE>   The compound's selling price is in the low $30-million range,
according to local Realtors not involved in the deal, who also
identified the buyers as Roland Arnall and his wife, Dawn. He is the
owner of Ameriquest Capital Corp., a financial services company in
Orange, and a longtime Democratic supporter.</TE>
<TE>   The compound includes a 40-room, 12,000-square-foot house owned in
the '70s by Sonny and Cher, and a seven-bedroom, 8,300-square-foot
home once owned by actress-swimmer Esther Williams. Actor Tony Curtis
owned the Sonny and Cher house before the couple purchased it.</TE>
<TE>   Humperdinck had his seven-bedroom, 8,200-square-foot home, on 1.5
acres just off Sunset Boulevard, on and off the market for years. In
1990, he was asking $8 million for it. Last year, it had been reduced
to $4.75 million. Humperdinck had owned the home since the mid-1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Known as the Pink Palace, it was formerly owned by actress Jayne
Mansfield. It was built in 1935 for crooner Rudy Vallee.</TE>
<TE>   The Sonny and Cher home is the centerpiece of the three-home
compound. Built in 1936, the Tuscan mansion is in a parklike setting
with a pond, pools, guest cottages and a tennis court. Marilyn Monroe
occasionally stayed in one of the cottages as a guest of film pioneer
Joseph M. Schenck, who owned the home in the early '50s.</TE>
<TE>   The Esther Williams home was built in 1925 by Edwin Janss,
developer of Westwood Village.</TE>
<TE>   The compound, known as Owlwood, came on the market in 1999 at
$58.9 million. At that time, Humperdinck's home was not included in
the price.</TE>
<TE>   Drew Mandile and Brooke Knapp at Sotheby's International Realty in
Beverly Hills handled the transaction and had the listing since the
two homes were initially packaged.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Actor Dan Aykroyd and his brother, producer Peter Aykroyd, co-own
a Hollywood Hills home that has come on the market at $2.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers purchased the home about 14 years ago as an
investment, but Peter Aykroyd has been living in the main house while
his brother has used the two-story detached guest house when in town.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers are selling the house because Peter Aykroyd is moving
outside of the area, and Dan Aykroyd and his wife, actress Donna
Dixon, have homes on the East Coast and in his native Canada. They
also own a Hollywood Hills home that they lease out.</TE>

<HD>New Immigration Plan May Keep Foreign Buyers Away</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEW SICHELMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A government proposal to establish greater control over people who
visit the United States for pleasure has drawn fire from real estate
interests.</LD>
<LD>   The Immigration and Naturalization Service's plan to limit the
stay of foreign visitors could prove "devastating" to real estate
markets, especially those with high concentrations of foreign
ownership, according to the National Assn. of Realtors (NAR).</LD>
<LD>   The nation's realty professionals are all for efforts to protect
the national security, said NAR President Martin Edwards. But
ownership of vacation and retirement homes would be "far less
attractive" to foreign buyers under the proposed changes. In
accordance with rules that were designed to eliminate paperwork and
have been in effect for years, visitors with B-2 visas can remain in
the country for up to six months and can ask to extend their stays
another six months before they must leave.</LD>
<TE>   But in light of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, INS Commissioner
James Ziglar now says it is necessary to better manage visitors to
America by limiting the admission period to 180 days. Under the
proposed change, instead of an automatic six-month admission, B-2
visitors would be granted a period of admission that reflects the
stated purpose of the trip.</TE>
<TE>   Because most non-immigrants do not have a stated need to remain
longer than 30 days, the INS says in its proposed rule, it is
reasonable to expect that most will depart within that time. If there
is any ambiguity about whether a longer or shorter stay is fair and
reasonable, a visitor could be allowed an extension for up to a total
of 180 days. But the original determination or the decision to grant
an extension wouldn't be made until the visitor was about to enter
the country. The plan "will lessen the possibility that an alien
visitor will establish permanent ties in the United States and remain
in the country illegally," the agency said in its proposed rule.</TE>
<TE>   But the 800,000-member NAR believes the proposal could introduce
so much uncertainty that it could hurt real estate markets where
foreigners own a large share of houses and apartments. "We are very
concerned" that the proposed rule "could be devastating to our
economy," Edwards said.</TE>
<TE>   No one tracks foreign ownership of U.S. real estate. But it is
believed the heaviest concentrations are in Florida, California,
Texas, Colorado and New York, and in such international cities as
Chicago, Washington, San Francisco and New York. Foreigners purchase
vacation, retirement and investment homes in America knowing they can
visit for at least six months to a year under today's rules, Edwards
said in a letter to the INS. But the proposal "removes this certainty
and replaces it with a moving target."</TE>
<TE>   The new process is "not only unworkable," the Memphis, Tenn.,
broker wrote, "but it places these foreign owners and visitors in
jeopardy of not knowing for certain how long they will be permitted
to visit their properties."</TE>
<TE>   "This proposal will remove any incentive for a foreigner to
purchase or to rent property in the United States," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Klock Corey said agents in the Miami Coldwell Banker office
she manages have already lost two deals because of concerns about
visas. She also reported that other potential purchasers "are not
showing any interest in buying right now" because of the uncertainty.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Zoller of Essinger Wooten Maxwell in Coral Gables,
Fla., said he's already feeling the effect too.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.) protesting the INS
proposal, he said he has "clients from Europe and South America [who]
are no longer interested in purchasing a vacation home in Miami"
because they are worried about their visitors' status.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that many would-be buyers "are beginning to feel less
welcome" in the U.S., Zoller said he anticipates losing perhaps as
much as $3 million in sales this year because of the proposed rule.
"We have to strike a balance between protecting ourselves and hurting
ourselves economically," said Corey, who estimates that foreigners
account for 20% to 25% of all real estate activity in South Florida.
The concern, though, is not just that foreigners will no longer
purchase or rent houses in their favorite places. It's also that they
will sell what they already own rather than put up with immigration
agency hassles.</TE>
<TE>   "Many foreign property owners have already expressed concern to
their real estate professionals about the future use of their
property," Edwards said. "Many have threatened to sell and go
elsewhere."</TE>
<TE>   At Coronado Shores--a 1,465-unit condominium property in San Diego
that has "a little bit of everything" in the way of foreign owners,
including about 200 from Mexico--Ara Koubeserian, vice president of
sales, said he hasn't seen any fall-off yet in resales because of the
INS proposal.</TE>
<TE>   But it "could have a big impact," he said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Property owners who purchased houses, mobile homes or other
structures after January 1978 and have discovered a particular kind
of plastic pipe leaking, may be eligible for a replacement plumbing
system at no cost, under the terms of a class-action settlement.</LD>
<LD>   The suit covers a plastic pipe called polybutylene, or PB,
installed between Jan. 1, 1978, and July 31, 1995. PB systems are
distinguished by flexible, gray plastic pipes joined by plastic or
metal fittings held in place by small aluminum or copper bands, a
little wider than a man's wedding band.</LD>
<LD>   Inside a home, the pipe is located in the attic, crawl space or
water heater closet. Outside a home, the pipe is blue, gray or black,
and typically is found at a water meter or pipe entry site. PB pipe
should not be confused with PVC products, which are rigid and made of
white plastic.</LD>
<TE>   Since 1995, more than 300,000 property owners nationwide have had
the plastic plumbing replaced at no cost.</TE>
<TE>   For more information or to report a leaking PB pipe, call the
Consumer Plumbing Recovery Center at (800) 392-7591, or visit
www.pbpipe.com. The Web site provides the information needed to file
a claim.</TE>

<HD>The 'No Closing Cost' Option</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK GUTTENTAG</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I've heard about refinancing using a no-closing-cost
option. The reason this is recommended is that on a refinance, any
points paid upfront must be taken as a tax deduction over the life of
the loan. This contrasts with a purchase transaction, on which points
can be deducted in their entirety in the year of purchase. This seems
perfectly logical to me, but some things you have written suggest
that you don't entirely agree. Is that true?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Points are an upfront charge expressed as a percent of the
loan. One point on a $100,000 loan is a charge of $1,000. Lenders
charge points on low-interest-rate loans and pay them on high-rate
loans. For example, on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, they might
quote 5.75% with 2 points, 6.25% with zero points and 7% with a
2-point rebate.</LD>
<LD>   A no-closing-cost option is one where the rebate covers all
closing costs. The tax treatment of points is less favorable on a
refinance than on a purchase transaction. Nonetheless, no-cost
refinances make sense only for borrowers who expect to hold their
mortgages for only a few years.</LD>
<TE>   A borrower with a longer time horizon, and who has the cash to pay
settlement costs, ought to avoid the no-cost option.</TE>
<TE>   Lenders put a high price on rebates. Their quid pro quo for a
rebate is a high interest rate, but lenders set this rate on the
assumption that they won't enjoy it very long. The average life of
high-interest-rate loans is short. A borrower with a long time
horizon gets a bad deal.</TE>
<TE>   But the proof is in the numbers. The critical number for potential
borrowers is the BEP, or "break-even period," for a no-cost loan,
relative to the same loan with a lower rate on which the borrower
pays the costs.</TE>
<TE>   Over periods shorter than the BEP, the no-cost loan has lower
costs. Beyond it, the no-cost loan has higher costs.</TE>
<TE>   I have two BEP calculators at www.mtgprofessor.com  (11a for
fixed-rate loans and 11b for adjustables). The calculators factor in
the tax benefits on interest and points, the reduction in loan
balance and interest loss on monies used to make monthly payments and
pay points.</TE>
<TE>   To illustrate, on July 10, I shopped Eloan.com, a competitive Web
site, for a 30-year fixed-rate loan that included a no-cost version
at 7%. I used the calculator to determine the BEP relative to a
6.375% version on which the borrower paid settlement costs, including
4/10 of a point. To make the comparison as favorable as possible to
the no-cost option, I assumed the highest possible tax rate of 39.1%.</TE>
<TE>   The BEP turned out to be 40 months on a purchase transaction, and
44 months on a refinance. Over periods this short, the difference in
tax treatment between a refinance and a purchase does not carry much
weight. The reason is that a refinancing borrower who pays off his
loan in full can take the entire remaining tax deduction in the
payoff year. If payoff occurs in the fourth year, the loss from
deferral of the deduction is small.</TE>
<TE>   At lower tax rates, the BEP is even shorter. At a 15% rate, it is
31 months on a purchase and 32 months on a refinance.</TE>
<TE>   The no-cost option is a clear winner for only one category of
refinancing borrower: one who intends to sell his house within a few
years, and has a mortgage with an interest rate above that available
in the market on a no-cost loan.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the no-cost option has also worked well for
borrowers who have refinanced every time the market has dropped to a
new low. Through successive refinancings, these borrowers have kept
the life of their loans short--to this point. With the benefit of
hindsight, this was a good strategy to have adopted five years ago.
When interest rates start to rise, however, the most recent no-cost
refinancing will not turn out as well.</TE>

<LD>My restaurant, Chez Mimi, was reviewed in the Sept. 8 issue of your
magazine ("French Re-Connection," Restaurants, by S. Irene Virbila).
For 26 years I have been cooking with one goal--to please my
clientele. Continuing to serve a popular menu, or offering a "winter
dish" in the summer, makes very good sense when it is precisely what
diners demand. It is what has kept us stable and successful for
decades while others have failed.</LD>
<LD>   We know that there is no "perfect product" and that our "basic"
food is quite special enough when our loyal friends order familiar
favorites over and over. Using "sleight of hand" in our cooking
suggests trickery, magic or illusion to fool an audience. This
technique doesn't interest me. I cook honest, real food that is
satisfying and nutritious--a menu in keeping with the style and theme
of my restaurant. I use the finest products I can find. After that,
my record speaks for itself.</LD>

<LD>Matthew Heller's article ("Delano's Grand Illusion," Sept. 1) reveals
that while the state peddles prisons to rural communities on a
promise of economic prosperity, that promise has been a hollow one.
As members of the statewide coalition of organizations fighting the
"Delano II" prison, we think it is important to point out that the
coalition includes both urban and rural groups from Delano and the
Central Valley. There is not a second prison in Delano today because
of their hard work challenging the Department of Corrections, the
prison guards' union and Gov. Gray Davis.</LD>

<HD>Massive Oregon Blaze a Match for Forest Rejuvenation</HD>
<DH>Nature: More than half of the nearly 500,000 acres either
did not burn or did so at low intensity, leaving many trees better
off after conflagration.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF BARNARD</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>GRANTS PASS, Ore.</DL>
<LD>When Biscuit -- the nation's biggest wildfire this year -- was on its
hind legs and roaring in July, anyone looking at the towering plumes
of smoke in southwestern Oregon could only wonder how anything could
survive.</LD>
<LD>   Now that most of the flames have cooled, a closer look at nearly
500,000 acres within the containment lines reveals a landscape
typical of wildfire: More than half either did not burn or burned at
low intensity, leaving mature trees green, standing and better off.</LD>
<LD>   "When a fire burns, unlike what is seen in cartoons, not every
tree is killed, not every plant is killed, not every acre is burned
to nothing," said Eric Christiansen, fire behavior analyst on the
federal team that stopped Biscuit from roaring into Oregon's Illinois
Valley.</LD>
<TE>   Although the fire put the 17,000 people in the valley on
evacuation alert as it burned five cabins and threatened others, in
the long run, it maintained the well-being of individual species and
the forest as a whole, said Tom Atzet, U.S. Forest Service ecologist
for southwestern Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   "The worst thing that we could have is to be so enamored of our
forests that we eliminate the processes that change them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Charred rings on old trees show that fire returns to the area
burned by Biscuit every 70 years on average on the wetter west side
and every 50 years on the drier east side, Atzet said.</TE>
<TE>   Just how that fire burns depends on the mix of weather, fuel and
terrain, Christiansen said. A windy, hot, dry day, combined with
steep ravines filled with heavy brush, downed logs and tightly packed
trees, means flames twice the height of the timber and temperatures
up to 2,000 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   But you would hardly notice the fire that comes through sparse
timber in flat rocky ground on a cool humid day with little wind.
Even patches of grass survive.</TE>
<TE>   Both scenarios can be found on Biscuit. As conditions changed each
day and across the landscape, the fire intensity changed, creating a
mosaic of results.</TE>
<TE>   A satellite map for assessing rehabilitation efforts showed 19% of
the Biscuit fire area, about 95,000 acres, was unburned, and 42%,
about 205,000 acres, burned at low intensity, leaving green trees
standing and healthy while clearing out brush and small trees.</TE>
<TE>   Only 16%, about 78,500 acres, burned at high intensity, leaving
little but ash and charcoal behind, and 23%, about 113,000 acres,
burned at moderate intensity.</TE>
<TE>   A good place to see the phenomenon is Babyfoot Lake. The fire
burned hot on steep slopes around the lake, but at the shore, where
the water cooled and humidified the air and a towering cliff cut the
wind, half the shoreline did not burn. Centuries-old pine and Douglas
fir stand as proof that fire can't fully flex its muscles here.</TE>
<TE>   The same phenomenon served to spare much of the vegetation along
the Illinois River, home to salmon and steelhead, said Jon Brazier, a
hydrologist.</TE>
<TE>   The Forest Service has yet to analyze just how logging may have
affected fire behavior, an issue in the debate over how forests
should be managed to reduce vulnerability to wildfire.</TE>
<TE>   But logging may not prove to be much of a factor. There has been
little cutting here since the 1980s, and the burn analysis of the
1987 Silver fire, which burned nearly 100,000 acres in the same area,
showed little difference between wilderness and areas that had been
logged.</TE>
<TE>   At a cost of nearly $150 million, fighting Biscuit looks
expensive. But another way to look at it would be to imagine Congress
appropriating $150 million to do prescribed burns restoring fire to
its proper place in the ecosystem, Atzet said.</TE>
<TE>   "In an ecological sense, we just invested $150 million," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the kalmiopsis bush, for which the Kalmiopsis
Wilderness where the fire started is named, depends on fire to kill
the white fir that competes with it for water, sunlight and
nutrients, Atzet said. The thin bark on white fir gives it less
protection from fire than ponderosa pine and Douglas fir, with thick
bark. Surviving trees do better than ever.</TE>
<TE>   Spaced out more widely by fire, trees are less susceptible to root
diseases, such as deadly Port Orford cedar root rot, which can be
passed root-to-root, she added. Heat kills the spores.</TE>
<TE>   Darlingtonia -- an insect-eating plant also known as cobra plant
-- will likely expand its command of hillside bogs now that competing
plants have been killed, said Diane White, Siskiyou ecologist.</TE>
<TE>   Chemicals leaching out of the ashes can stimulate acorns to sprout
into oak trees, giving them a head start on pines and firs waiting
for the spring. Madrones will sprout from the bole -- the underground
connection between the trunk and roots -- after the top of the tree
is killed.</TE>
<TE>   Knobcone pines not only need the heat of fire to open their cones,
but their seeds love the mineral soil exposed when fire burns off the
duff -- needles and bark built up over the years.</TE>
<TE>   Siskiyou wildlife biologist Lee Webb said some animals surely
weretrapped by the fire and died, but he never saw one in eight days
of walking the fire. None of the 250 species found on the Siskiyou
have been driven off by the fire, although some fared better than
others.</TE>
<TE>   Bluebirds and olive-sided flycatchers will flock to the burn,
either for insects to eat or nesting cavities. Deer and elk will
likely increase because the fire expanded meadows, and sprouting
trees and brush will provide more food.</TE>
<TE>   But the Northern spotted owl, a threatened species responsible for
practically shutting down logging in Northwest national forests, will
likely do worse. The fate of the 47 pairs of spotted owls whose range
falls within the fire boundaries is not known, but satellite mapping
indicates that the fire killed about 53,000 acres of old growth
forest considered suitable for owl habitat -- one-seventh of the
total owl habitat in the forest, Webb said.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing is good or bad for wildlife" as a whole, Webb said.
"We've got 250 species out there, and there is a range."</TE>

<HD>A Walk a Day May Keep Colds Away</HD>
<DH>Health: Research indicates that physical activity lowers
the risk of getting sick. The benefit is most striking in the fall,
study says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>IRA DREYFUSS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A more active day apparently helps to keep a cold at bay.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers who report this also say people don't have to put in
an athletic performance to get the benefit.</LD>
<LD>   "A regularly active person has a lower risk of getting a cold,"
said Charles E. Matthews of the University of South Carolina.</LD>
<TE>   Matthews and his colleagues looked at 12 months of data on 547
healthy men and women who had taken part in a broader study of health
behaviors.</TE>
<TE>   The men and women, whose average age was 48, reported regularly on
their physical activities and the number of colds they got.</TE>
<TE>   At the higher end, the activities were enough to fit into the U.S.
Surgeon General's recommended minimums, Matthews said. Those federal
guidelines call for 30 minutes of brisk walks, lawn mowing or other
moderate activity on most days of the week.</TE>
<TE>   At the lower end, participants did nothing more intense than light
dusting, which is below the recommended level.</TE>
<TE>   Over the year, the more active people averaged one cold, which was
23% lower than the average for the least active group, said the
report in the August issue of the journal Medicine and Science in
Sports and Exercise.</TE>
<TE>   The benefit was especially striking in the fall, when about 40% of
colds occurred, Matthews said.</TE>
<TE>   The risk reduction among the more active people was 32%, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Studies have found that exercise seems effective in reducing the
chance that a person will get a cold.</TE>
<TE>   If the evidence continues to mount, federal health officials might
decide to promote the benefit as another reason to exercise, said
David C. Nieman of Appalachian State University, who was not part of
Matthews' team.</TE>
<TE>   "This is getting so scientifically sound that it is going to
demand attention at the National Institutes of Health level," Nieman
said. "Overall, I feel the evidence is so compelling that I think
people can use it as a reason to be active."</TE>
<TE>   In one of Nieman's studies, women who walked regularly and still
got colds had symptoms that lasted less than five days, while similar
women who did not walk had colds that lasted seven days.</TE>
<TE>   Being physically active seems to stimulate immune cells that
target cold infections, Nieman said.</TE>
<TE>   The heightened stimulation seems to last only one to three hours
and then subsides.</TE>
<TE>   But day after day of making the immune system spike may lower the
overall risk of catching cold, he said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Nieman has also found that very hard exercise seems to
draw down immune defenses. In his research, people who ran a marathon
had a higher risk of a cold for several days after the event.</TE>
<TE>   And exercise apparently can't cure the common cold, Nieman said.</TE>
<TE>   Other researchers have deliberately given people colds, then had
them exercise, and found that exercise neither improved nor worsened
the course of the cold, he said.</TE>

<HD>Racist Statutes Under Siege</HD>
<DH>Legislation: States seek to eliminate laws barring land
ownership by minorities and discriminatory language from their
documents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PRENGAMAN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>A clause in Oregon's constitution declares that the only blacks
allowed to live in the state are slaves. The provision was rendered
obsolete in 1868, but it has remained on the books for nearly 150
years.</LD>
<LD>   On Nov. 5, Oregonians will vote on a measure to remove that
provision and other discriminatory language from the constitution.</LD>
<LD>   Over the past four years, about half a dozen states have
undertaken to expunge racist constitutional wording and statutes that
have been virtually forgotten since they were drafted in another age.</LD>
<TE>   "Eventually those laws will all be gotten rid of," said Jack Chin,
a professor at the University of Cincinnati College of Law.</TE>
<TE>   New Mexico voters will decide in November whether to remove an
"alien land statute" from the state constitution. It bans Asian
immigrants from owning property.</TE>
<TE>   Last May, Kansas Gov. Bill Graves signed a bill that repealed a
similar unenforced law.</TE>
<TE>   The United States actively limited the immigration of Asians from
1862 to 1965. During that span, more than a dozen states prohibited
Asian immigrants from owning property. Most states did away with the
laws between 1940 and 1960. Other states forgot about the clauses, or
simply ignored them.</TE>
<TE>   The Wyoming Legislature last year repealed its 1943 alien land
law.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon offers a good example of how a racist statute can end up
staying on the books.</TE>
<TE>   A constitutional provision dating from 1857 states that "No free
negro, or mulatto, not residing in this State at the time of the
adoption of this Constitution, shall come, reside, or be within this
State, or hold any real estate .... "</TE>
<TE>   Another provision facing removal states the number of Oregon
Supreme Court justices "shall not exceed five until the white
population of the State shall amount to One Hundred Thousand."</TE>
<TE>   Many early settlers were pro-slavery Democrats, Southerners who
brought with them their social norms, and sometimes their slaves.</TE>
<TE>   In 1868, the U.S. Congress ratified the 14th Amendment, which bars
states from enforcing laws that deny citizens equal protection based
on race. Oregon voters in 1925 repealed their state's constitutional
provisions discriminating against blacks. But the language --
forgotten by many and ignored by others -- was never removed .</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Avel Gordly (D-Portland) prodded lawmakers in the 2001
legislative session to prepare Measure 14, which would finally remove
the obsolete language.</TE>

<LD>It continues to amaze me that people who claim to be religious (and
therefore moral and ethical) applaud the construction of the new
cathedral in downtown Los Angeles ("The New Cathedral, Continued,"
Letters, Sept. 22).</LD>
<LD>   Mimi Sheean asserts that these "magnificent edifices" are here to
"fill us with awe and wonder at the glory of God."</LD>
<LD>   Just what does a huge, multimillion-dollar building, even a
beautiful one, have to do with the glory of God? Why is a man-made
structure supposed to generate awe in the viewer? I would argue that
Yosemite and a sunset on the Central Coast are better evidence of the
glory of God.</LD>
<TE>   There were in fact "better things to do with the money" used to
build Notre Dame and the other "great cathedrals" of Europe, but we
have lost track of those who suffered needlessly while these
structures were built. They are gone forever, so who cares about
them? Where is the morality in that point of view?</TE>
<TE>   Sheean claims she "believe(s) feeding the spirit is as important
as feeding the belly." How nice for her. Has she spoken to anyone
with an empty belly? (She can find them not far from the cathedral.)
I wonder if the new cathedral feeds their spirit enough to silence
their growling stomachs. Only those with full bellies can truly
believe a building is a better use of money than helping people.</TE>
<TE>   It was wrong to spend the money on cathedrals centuries ago in
Europe, and it was wrong for the Catholic Church to build "Mahony's
folly" now. It will be a better world when the members of the
congregation live in big houses and have full bellies, and the church
is a tumbledown shack.</TE>
<TE>   Sheean says "soon enough no one will think about who built our own
awe-inspiring cathedral." Wrong. I (and, I suspect, many others) will
always remember who was responsible for this sinful act of
self-indulgence and self-aggrandizement.</TE>
<TE>   Isn't this Cardinal Mahony with "courage and vision" the same one
who transferred pedophile priests to new parishes and covered up
their crimes against children? I find nothing awe-inspiring in any of
this, and I am forced to wonder about the morality of those who do.</TE>

<LD>In the mid-'50s, when Ferus Gallery barely started, with Edward
Kienholz at the helm, I knew all those guys and they knew me ("An
L.A. Art Story," by Barbara Isenberg, Sept 22).</LD>
<LD>   At the time, I was presenting my improvisational Instant Theatre
at the little Circle workshop on El Centro. In the back was my
apartment, filled with Jasper Johns, Rauschenberg and Twombly pieces
that constituted most of my collection gleaned from the artists
through my friendship with them in New York in the early '50s. Every
week I would visit the Ferus, and every weekend, the Ferus "stable"
would visit my theater and me.</LD>
<LD>   When Irving Blum appeared, he took my classes--and was very
talented and witty--and then we went our separate ways. But I still
visited the Ferus and stayed in touch with Blum and Hopps. An
announcement for Instant Theatre is a part of Kienholz's "Barney's
Beanery."</LD>

perhaps Ira just raised the bar for what the title should describe.</LD>

<LD>As co-founder of the Musical Theatre Guild, I was thrilled to see Don
Shirley's article on the company ("Musicals Mushroom at This Co-op,"
Sept. 22).</LD>
<LD>   While I am no longer involved with the company, it was great to
see an unknown entity like this finally get some well-deserved
publicity. I only wish it could have happened seven years ago when we
were struggling with no money and begging to be recognized. It's
interesting how the only two times the guild has received any notice
from The Times was when it produced a Stephen Sondheim show, first
with "Passion" and now with "Saturday Night."</LD>
<LD>   I need to clear up some misconceptions in the article. First and
most important, my partner Jeff Rizzo and I did not "leave" the
company. We were strong-armed out. A membership meeting was convened
(that we were told not to attend) where a faction of disgruntled
members succeeded in getting us voted out of our own company. I say
"our own company" because not only were we the founders, but we did
99% of the work (outside of the actual performing) necessary to get
the company off the ground and run successfully for 4 1/2 years.</LD>
<TE>   We took it from a group of actors sitting around with no money in
the bank and less than 40 attendees at our first show to having over
$10,000 in the bank and a sold-out house for our final show, all in
just three short seasons. For most of that time we worked for little
to no salary, no health benefits, and donated more than $10,000 of
our own money and services to the company.</TE>
<TE>   We designed and perfected the staged reading series that they
continue with today and to which we have not been welcomed since our
departure. We begged every day of our tenure for the membership to
equally share the workload, and it was at my insistence that the
group have a say in everything, even though I was warned by many that
it wouldn't work.</TE>
<TE>   It was like pulling teeth to get anyone to participate in anything
other than actually performing. It wasn't until we were gone that the
members started to do the work (out of necessity), but now we're
being blamed for being "too powerful."</TE>
<TE>   Our dismissal was one of the most extremely painful events of our
lives.</TE>

<TE>   Marcia Seligson of Reprise! claims her company's "Westside
audience" isn't the same as the Musical Theatre Guild's "Pasadena
audience," so she doesn't care that Reprise!'s production of
Sondheim's "Merrily We Roll Along" conflicted with MTG's "Saturday
Night," depriving many people of the chance to see both shows.</TE>
<TE>   If she checked the subscriber lists, Seligson might be surprised.
We live in the Valley and have been longtime Reprise! subscribers
and, largely because of "Saturday Night," we've joined MTG. We know
another Valley family also distressed at the scheduling. We can't be
the only ones.</TE>
<TE>   This is Southern California. We all have cars and we don't mind
driving for good musical theater, especially when it's Sondheim.</TE>
<TE>   We find Seligson's dismissive attitude even more infuriating than
missing "Merrily," and hope that similar conflicts won't occur in the
future.</TE>

<HD>Tankian's System Is a Serjical Strategy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>System of a Down pretty much stands alone right now in the hard-rock
mainstream, as a band with topical awareness and one that doesn't
resort to rap-metal gimmicks or cartoonish menace.</LD>
<LD>   System singer Serj Tankian, though, is looking for some company.</LD>
<LD>   Tankian is launching a record label, Serjical Strike, in a joint
venture with Columbia Records (to which System is signed). Fans,
though, should not look to the label for System of a Down clones.</LD>
<TE>   A showcase concert on Oct. 8 at the Troubadour will introduce the
label with performances by three distinctly different Southern
California bands: frenetic Bad Acid Trip, Brit-poppish Slow Motion
Reign and gothy Kittens for Christian. The Serjical Strike plan is to
release an album by each group next year, plus one by Serart, a
freewheeling jazz/world music/spoken-word collaboration of Tankian
and Armenian multi-instrumentalist Arto Tuncboyaciyan</TE>
<TE>   Tankian says his attraction to the bands he's signed has nothing
to do with particular musical styles or thematic content.</TE>
<TE>   "They are original acts," he says, "and [they play] original music
that I don't think would be otherwise available. I'm trying to bring
original music to the forefront and expand the dynamics of music.
When I go buy music, I buy a lot of different types, and I want to
help enrich that angle of purchasing as a music consumer."</TE>
<TE>   Serjical Strike started a year and a half ago as an Internet
project, offering albums by Bad Acid Trip and Kittens for Christian
only through the Web site (www.serjicalstrike.com) and in a handful
of small, independent record stores in the L.A. area. The idea was to
stamp the company with Tankian's sensibilities in a way modeled
largely on two other labels: American Records, started by Rick Rubin
(who originally signed and produced System) and Axiom Records,
founded by eclectic producer-musician Bill Laswell.</TE>
<TE>   "When I see something is from Axiom, I'm always interested to see
what it is," Tankian says, adding that Laswell "has established a
label identity. There are a lot of major labels out there with all
these records that are not really identified with the label. And I
like what Rick Rubin has done with American, where there's a variety
of artists--I like that model, where it's not one genre, but where
it's about really believing in these bands and not just about whether
something's commercially viable."</TE>
<TE>   The goals haven't really changed with the boost to a major-label
association.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't had a commerciality conversation with the Columbia
brass," he says. "That's not what I do and they know that. With
System they took a chance and nothing was ever said about sales
projections, and I've still never had that conversation with them.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they know I will bring some things in that could be ahead
of trends," Tankian says. "And I'll have some things still going
through independent distribution that are better served that way.
Obviously Columbia is in this to make money. But to me it's a matter
of whether it's good music, and even if it's not commercially viable
and Columbia ends up dropping my label in a couple of years, I'll
still be happy because I brought out good music."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HAVE FAITH: To counteract downloading and copying trends, Warner
Bros. Records is jumping into the value-added realm with an ambitious
Internet tie-in to Faith Hill's coming CD, "Cry." A code embedded in
the disc, due in stores Oct. 15, will allow fans to put it in a
computer and connect to a Web site being called Faith Hill TV.</TE>
<TE>   "We're filming an episodic documentary starting with her in the
studio making the record," says Warner Bros. creative czar Jeff
Ayeroff. "It will be updated constantly. We'll have a piece about her
photo shoot, choosing the cover with her husband Tim McGraw, behind
the scenes at the making of her TV special that will be on NBC on
Thanksgiving. We'll film when she's on with Leno, Letterman, when she
goes to Europe."</TE>
<TE>   The idea isn't a country music version of "The Anna Nicole Show,"
but to create a connection with Hill that will only be available to
fans who buy the album.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to create a community of fans who bought the CD, to
enhance the value," Ayeroff says. "This will be the things people
want to see about an artist."</TE>
<TE>   One bit may be of particular interest to L.A. concertgoers--it was
a Hill video that was being filmed at the El Rey Theatre recently
when structural problems in the building caused the fire marshal to
close it. Hill and crew had to pack up the production and start fresh
the next night at the Palace. All of that was filmed by the
documentary team.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SMALL FACES: Singer-songwriters Matthew Sweet, Shawn Mullins and
Pete Droge are teaming up for a trio project that's been signed to
Columbia Records. Brendan O'Brien, who's produced Pearl Jam, Bob
Dylan and recently Bruce Springsteen's "The Rising," is in
discussions to steward this album.... Dave Sheridan, star of the Red
Hot Chili Peppers' "By the Way" video and creator of MTV's "Jackass"
predecessor "Buzzkill," is launching a rock project in the guise of
Doug Gormley &amp; the Cobraz. With a band that includes onetime Poison
guitarist Richie Kotzen and ex-Ozzy Osbourne and Billy Idol bassist
Phil Soussan, he's recording songs with such titles as "Steve's Going
on a Beer Run" and "Spring Break Forever and Ever and Ever"
and--well, you get the idea. Producer Alan Eliot describes it as
"Andrew WK meets Cheech &amp; Chong." ... Comedian Eddie Izzard has
signed with Epitaph Records' Anti label for his and the label's first
foray into DVD, with plans to release his concert film "Dress to
Kill" on Nov. 26. The package will include a bonus of "Dress to
Circle," shot with one camera at a performance in France--done by the
Englishman entirely in French .... North Carolina-based
country-rockabilly wild man Unknown Hinson, newly signed to Capitol
Records Nashville, will settle in L.A. for a Southern California
residency including every Thursday in October at the Knitting Factory
(with a special Halloween show planned) and at least 10 dates at
various other clubs. Hinson (who says he took his first name after
how his father is listed on his birth certificate) will have a debut
EP, "Rock 'n' Roll Is Straight From Hell," released in October, with
a full album due in early 2003.</TE>

<LD>   ENRIQUE IGLESIAS</LD>
<LD>   "Quizas"</LD>
<TE>   Universal Latino</TE>
<TE>   The music favored by Enrique Iglesias on million-selling album
after million-selling album is syrupy and decadent, melodramatic and
insubstantial.</TE>
<TE>   Then why is it so compelling?</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it's an almost intangible quality to Iglesias' singing that
entices you to set aside critical judgment and activate your
soap-opera-loving sentimental side. This obsessively polished
collection of Spanish-language songs (due in stores Tuesday after two
albums in English) doesn't sound very different from the dozens of
pop albums that routinely dominate the charts. But Iglesias'
sincerity is impossible to ignore.</TE>
<TE>   The young singer projects the image of a sophisticated crooner,
but his lyrics focus mostly on images of women as larger-than-life
objects of adoration. On the somber "Marta," the effect of a woman's
departure after a night of pleasure is simply devastating, with the
song's hapless protagonist remembering "her mouth, still tasting as
sweet as honey."</TE>
<TE>   The album's emotional high point is its melancholy title track. An
open letter to his father, Julio Iglesias (the two men reportedly
haven't spoken to each other in years), it finds the singer talking
about the feelings of loneliness that permeate his otherwise
successful existence and reflecting on the transitory nature of life.
Iglesias has never so sounded so vulnerable, and his willingness to
bare his soul adds an extra level of poignancy and sincerity to his
music. The singer headlines Staples Center on Oct. 22.</TE>

<TE>   KIM RICHEY</TE>
<TE>   "Rise"</TE>
<TE>   Lost Highway</TE>
<TE>   The singer-songwriter is usually classified as a country artist,
but her work has been moving in a more general pop direction.
Produced by Bill Bottrell (Sheryl Crow, Shelby Lynne), her fourth
album (in stores Tuesday) employs wheezy, new-wave keyboards along
with banjos and acoustic guitars. More to the point, perhaps,
different songs evoke such emotionally insightful artists as Aimee
Mann and Tom Petty.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Richey's widely varied tunes--including the muted, bluesy
"Girl in a Car," the torchy Latin-flavored "Without You" and the
Band-esque "Cowards in a Brave New World"--the collection's
restrained production creates a unifying sense of solitary
reflection. Her assessments feel more like portraits painted from
memory than like snapshots of moments. This approach, coupled with
her straightforward vocals, keeps the many tales of partings,
searching and moving on from being histrionic or despairing.</TE>
<TE>   Despite her inventiveness, however, "Rise" gets slightly bogged
down when her lift-yourself-up message is repeated in "No Judges,"
"This Love" and "Good Day Here." Still, much more often Richey's
intimate simplicity makes for compelling listening. She plays the
Troubadour on Oct. 7.</TE>

<TE>   MARK KNOPFLER</TE>
<TE>   "The Ragpicker's Dream"</TE>
<TE>   Warner Bros.</TE>
<TE>   The British guitar whiz and composer has had a soft spot for the
working stiff back to his days with Dire Straits, whether that work
happened to be hefting major appliances ("Money for Nothing") or
musical riffs ("The Sultans of Swing"). On his third solo album (due
Tuesday), he doffs his cap to shoe salesmen (the delightfully Roger
Miller-esque "Quality Shoe"), farmers ("Hill Farmer's Blues") and
carpenters ("Why Aye Man") as well.</TE>
<TE>   As on his previous solo album, "Sailing to Philadelphia," he's
also got a lot to say about the tug between wanderlust and the need
for roots. These songs are couched in mostly acoustic settings that
draw as much from Celtic folk as from American blues and country
sources, making for an often haunting and illuminating journey that
emerges through vignettes with a cinematic richness.</TE>
<TE>   When he sings "You better love your daddy while you can" in
"Daddy's Gone to Knoxville," simultaneously evoking Hank Williams and
Chet Atkins, the implication of impending separation is all the more
heartbreaking for its simplicity.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, Knopfler has sometimes pushed too hard for big theme
statements to communicate his views on life; this time he wisely lets
his lyrics set a scene, allowing his music to deliver more of the
emotional punch.</TE>

<TE>   The former country wunderkind was so put off by last year's "I
Need You" album, a hodgepodge of overproduced teen-pop drivel, that
she disavowed it. She warned it had been assembled without her
cooperation by her estranged father-producer and her label, both of
whom she was suing at the time.</TE>
<TE>   It was a bold move for a musician who was still a teen, striking a
blow for artistic integrity that paved the way for this album (in
stores Tuesday), one she says at last fully reflects her vision, one
she co-produced and for which she also co-wrote four songs. The
result? A hodgepodge of overproduced young-adult pop drivel.</TE>
<TE>   The big difference is several songs in which she revels in the
garden of earthly delights. Britney Spears may profess that she's not
yet a woman, but Rimes, in setting her sights on the same audience,
makes sure listeners understand that she loves s-e-x as much as Janet
Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   She commands a set of pipes as strong or stronger than any of her
peers, but she's squandering them on songs that say little beyond sex
is great, love is everything and, gee, it's tough being famous. R.L.</TE>

<TE>   RILO KILEY</TE>
<TE>   "The Execution of All Things"</TE>
<TE>   Saddle Creek</TE>
<TE>   From the moment Jenny Lewis' barely sung vocals emerge on the
wintry opener, this Los Angeles quartet's sophomore album (due
Tuesday) offers a lovely bouquet of idiosyncrasies. What to make of
punky shout-outs in a ballad? Of splashes of twang segueing into
crashes and crunch? Of a lilting vocalist who drops the F-bomb in a
lullaby? Nice arrangement.</TE>
<TE>   Stripped down, every tune here drips with the melodiousness of a
folk song or pop ballad. Lewis' keyboards, along with guitars and
vocals from co-founder Blake Sennett, create a melange that frames
snippets occasionally tingling with the poignancy of a poetry
reading. The collection's loose, countrified feel allows Rilo Kiley
to get away with a lot, including sudden shifts in volume, some
throw-it-at-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks lyrics, a smattering of
beeps and pings, horns and strings.</TE>
<TE>   But it's easy to hear what attracted the folks at Omaha's Saddle
Creek--which, thanks to artists such as Bright Eyes, Desaparecidos
and the Faint, ranks as the most scenic cul-de-sac in indie rock.
"Execution" makes you want to hum. Rilo Kiley plays the Echo on
Tuesday with Elliott Smith.</TE>

<TE>   In Brief</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2 Thievery Corporation, "The Richest Man in Babylon," ESL.
Though a favorite in the dance world, the Washington, D.C.-based duo
of Eric Hilton and Rob Garza has more in common with seminal goth act
Dead Can Dance than with its electronic peers. Like DCD, Thievery
Corporation holds a strong fascination with Indian and Middle Eastern
music (as well as the songs of Brazil). On "Babylon" (due Tuesday),
those world sounds are dipped in languid dance beats that make for an
alluring late-night journey.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Baltin</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2 Disturbing Tha Peace, "Golden Grain," Def Jam South.
Ludacris' unyielding energy, hilariously clever lyrics and
block-rocking beats have made the Atlanta rapper one of the genre's
most exciting artists. Too bad the members of his Disturbing Tha
Peace posse, here on their debut album, can't always keep up.
Ludacris shines on his few appearances, while Shawnna, Lil' Fate,
Tity Boy and I-20 alternate between solid and subpar street raps.</TE>
<TE>   Soren Baker</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ** Scapegoat Wax, "SWAX," Hollywood. The single "Lost Cause" was a
hit at radio, but that perfect piece of candy guitar pop about a kid
lost in his headphones might describe lead goat Marty James: too hip
to his own trip. Buried by throwaway hip-hop are cool soul movers
"Crawlin' " and "Freeway," Curtis Mayfied-through-Commodores
mid-tempo jams, but they're screaming "I'm cool!" just a little too
loud.</TE>
<TE>   Dean Kuipers</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2 Kenny G, "Paradise," Arista. A long time ago, in a galaxy
far, far away, Kenny G was a fair jazz saxophonist. But he'd be the
first to say that what he plays on "Paradise," as on his mega-hits,
is instrumental pop, not jazz. Viewed from that perspective, he's got
another winner on his hands, overflowing with foot-tapping rhythms,
catchy hooks and the atmospheric moods suggested by titles such as
"Malibu Dreams," "Ocean Breeze" and "Falling in the Moonlight," as
well as an obligatory vocal number--"One More Time," intimately sung
by Chante Moore.</TE>
<TE>   Don Heckman</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2 Myracle Brah, "Bleeder," Rainbow Quartz/Not Lame. Andy
Bopp's quixotic quest for beatlehood has always seemed as if it were
mapped out by the Replacements. The Baltimorean's fourth album since
the demise of his Interscope band Lovenut accelerates and decelerates
like a car chase, sideswiping some classic pop influences while
jolting its audience with masterfully executed U-turns and thrilling
near-misses. On numbers such as the exuberant "Independence Day,"
Bopp recalls "March"-era Michael Penn, and the way he's driving, that
feels like the open road.</TE>
<TE>   Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair),
three stars (good) and four stars (excellent). The albums are already
released unless otherwise noted.</TE>

<LD>If repackaging classic tracks put the Beatles and Elvis back on top,
the Rolling Stones can darn well do the same with "Forty Licks," due
in stores Tuesday from ABKCO/Virgin. Right? But by adding four new
tunes to three dozen remastered "classics," these two discs
inadvertently prove we don't need new Stones songs.</LD>
<LD>   *** The 36 Hits. The '60s and early '70s songs (the 20 tracks on
Disc 1) are revolutionary and iconic, but the rest here (those from
1971 to 1997) are spottier than you might remember. In particular,
the selections from 1989's "Steel Wheels" and 1994's "Voodoo Lounge"
are diluted rehashes that only underscore the diminishing returns of
sticking to the same sonic and thematic formulas.</LD>
<LD>   * 1/2 The Four New Songs. New numbers such as the
borderline-precious rocker "Stealing My Heart" or even the jaunty
flirtation "Don't Stop" could only sound tepid against the
still-electrifying "Street Fighting Man" and the elated jangle of
"Happy" (though there is no small irony in putting a digital sheen on
the vintage tracks at a time when so many younger rock bands are
mining the gritty roots the Stones thrust down four decades ago).</LD>
<TE>   Mick Jagger still plays the elusive seducer, but when Satan
realizes he's distilled the leash-yanking triumph of "Under My Thumb"
into the bored, Van Morrison-esque ballad "Keys to Your Love," the
Evil One will doubtless throw up. Keith Richards' album-closing piano
ballad, "Losing My Touch," isn't really the best setting for his
boulder-tumbled voice. But within it lies a glimmer of discontent.
"Baby, get me outta here," he croaks. Yes, please.</TE>

<LD>   MAYRA CARIDAD VALDES</LD>
<LD>   "La Diosa del Mar"</LD>
<TE>   Jazzheads</TE>
<TE>   Though she doesn't yet command a fraction of the fame she
deserves, Valdes owns one of the most thrilling female voices in the
Afro-Caribbean tradition. Whether unspooling gloriously low, throaty
notes on "Drume Negrita," firing off brilliant scat improvisation on
"Mambo Influenciado" or radically reconceiving the venerable "Besame
Mucho," Valdes proves that she has it all: a magnificent instrument,
a complete technique and a musical imagination that won't quit. (She
comes from a Cuban musical family that includes her brother, pianist
Chucho Valdes.) Not many vocalists could finesse the ferociously
syncopated rhythms of Charlie Parker's "Billie's Bounce" as
effortlessly as Valdes does, while also capturing the folkloric
spirit of Ernesto Duarte's "Como Fue."</TE>
<TE>   Joined by a top-notch sextet, Valdes sings not as a lead vocalist
but, rather, as simply another member of the band, nimbly trading
phrases with the instrumentalists at often unusually brisk tempos. By
any measure, "La Diosa del Mar" is a tour de force of the art of jazz
singing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   KAHIL EL'ZABAR TRIO</TE>
<TE>   "Love Outside of Dreams"</TE>
<TE>   Delmark Records</TE>
<TE>   A percussionist who defies categorization, El'Zabar has built a
formidable reputation powering such avant-garde ensembles as the
Ritual Trio and the Ethnic Heritage Ensemble and collaborating with
visionaries such as baritone saxophonist Hamiet Bluiett and violinist
Billy Bang. Here, El'Zabar presides over the final recording of a
stylistically free-ranging trio that, alas, came to an end with the
death of pioneering bassist Fred Hopkins in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, this belated release captures the trio in its full
glory, with El'Zabar, Hopkins and reedist David Murray creating vivid
music capable of thundering at one moment, whispering the next.
Several of the cuts convey a palpable sense of serenity, and when the
trio turns up the heat, there's no resisting the torrent of sound
that issues from Murray's mighty tenor sax, the intensity and drive
of El'Zabar's percussion or the hard-charging ideas that Hopkins
ignites on bass.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   PAQUITO D'RIVERA</TE>
<TE>   "Brazilian Dreams"</TE>
<TE>   Manchester Craftsmen's Guild</TE>
<TE>   Though it comes as no surprise that the great Cuban reedist is
persuasive in Brazilian repertoire, D'Rivera's "Brazilian Dreams"
exceeds expectations, in part because of his intuitive partnership
with guest trumpeter Claudio Roditi and New York Voices. To hear
D'Rivera's often melancholy clarinet lines set against the plush
ensemble singing of the vocal ensemble is like beholding an emerald
in a crushed-velvet box.</TE>
<TE>   The exquisite arabesques that D'Rivera articulates on "Corcovado,"
the long and elegiac phrases he spins in "One for Tom" and the
low-register clarinet riffs he plays on "Manha De Carnival" point to
the unassailable musicianship of a reedist more often admired for the
fluidity of his technique. Lest anyone think this is just another
commercial traversal of Brazilian standards, a track such as
"Modinha" argues strongly to the contrary, its daringly slow vocal
passages dovetailing with D'Rivera's mournful, profoundly expressive
lines on clarinet.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   CONTE CANDOLI</TE>
<TE>   "Candoli Live"</TE>
<TE>   Nagel Heyer Records</TE>
<TE>   In a career that spanned more than half a century, Candoli stood
as one of the most versatile trumpeters in the business. Candoli's
death in December silenced one of the signal voices of West Coast
jazz, but this live recording will remind listeners of his appeal as
soloist and bandleader.</TE>
<TE>   Recorded in 2000 in Germany, the disc shows Candoli playing with
the directness and authority that were his hallmarks, offering
inexorable swing rhythm on his own "I Dig Fig" and stylish phrasings
on "There Is No Greater Love." Yet for all the hard-hitting power of
Candoli's work, the man also was capable of producing delicately
poetic lines, as on a muted version of "Lover Man." In all, a fitting
farewell to an indispensable jazz musician.</TE>

<HD>Shtick and a Few Yuks? Bingo!</HD>
<DH>Despite a celebrity's snub and a questionable buffet, the

<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You are in the "world famous" Friars Club of Beverly Hills sitting at
a long white table. At the bar lurks a man whose cratered mug has
been in every gangster movie since "Little Caesar." A few feet away,
two women in motorized vehicles that look more like Harleys than
wheelchairs are negotiating the buffet with its glass bowls of
Thousand Island dressing and croutons.</LD>
<LD>   The air shimmers with the smell of butane and the sound of Donna
Summer singing "God Bless America." A man in a Hawaiian shirt holding
a microphone is explaining that Buddy Hackett will be arriving in
less than an hour. Directly in front of you are two bingo daubers,
which look inarguably like brightly colored sexual aids, and a
plateful of banana cream pie. Sitting on your left, drawing off white
gloves with big blue polka dots, is Jo Anne Worley. You are laughing
so hard that when you try to breathe, you snort, just like you did in
high school.</LD>
<LD>   This is not a dream.</LD>
<TE>   This is the grand opening of Celebrity Bingo Night at the Friars
Club earlier this month. You are here because a comic named Steve
Bluestein convinced a few of his friends, including Worley and Mary
Willard, that it would be an absolute hoot to see Buddy Hackett call
a bingo game and they, being gracious, adventuresome women, allowed
you to accompany them.</TE>
<TE>   The dreamlike quality of the evening began early, at about 3:15 on
the front stoop of Worley's Toluca Lake house. For anyone older than,
say, 35, Worley occupies a significant and unique place in the heart
of popular culture. She was one of the most beloved members of the
deliciously odd ensemble of "Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In." With her big
hair, zany polka-dotted head scarves, unapologetically fake eyelashes
and trademark high-pitched warble, Worley's post-"Laugh-In" career
includes game show diva, stand-up comic and comedic actress.</TE>
<TE>   Meeting her is kind of a big deal.</TE>
<TE>   Opening her door, she is immediately and irrefutably her, with a
jet-black pageboy and lashes out to here. "You look hot," she
declares over the silky head of her miniature Yorkshire terrier,
Harmony. "You want a diet soda?"</TE>
<TE>   She and Willard, who is also there at the house, know nothing
about bingo, nothing about this game except that Hackett's supposed
to be there tonight and comedian Norm Crosby is scheduled the
following week. "But how can it not be a scream?" says Willard, who
is a playwright and is married to comedic actor Fred Willard.</TE>
<TE>   In the car, Worley dangles a string of white beads. "I wore these
once in Esther Williams' pool," she says. "They have to be lucky."</TE>
<TE>   The beads pay off almost immediately; Willard gets street parking
right across from the Friars Club, and then things start to get a
little odd. From across the street, it's apparent that the health
inspector has been here fairly recently and awarded the food service
a thought-provoking C.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe C stands for comedy," says Worley. Or Cedars-Sinai.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the club's foyer, a group of women is gathered. Most of
them seem to be wearing T-shirts adorned with sequined American
flags. Many of them are carrying pillows. They all seem to know each
other. They do not seem to be from the neighborhood. They are bingo
ladies.</TE>
<TE>   The doors do not open until 4:30. It is 4:15. Bluestein arrives.
He had been told by the folks at the club to show up at 4, and this
is what he told his friends. Some of the bingo ladies are slowly
sneaking their way up the curving staircase that leads to the main
room where the games will be held. One woman advises Worley to get
seats at the end of a table--better access. "It's going to be like
the Cocoanut Grove," says Bluestein. "A stampede. I'll get a high
heel in my forehead."</TE>
<TE>   The women are talking to each other about "this evening." About
how they're going to do in the games "this evening." Worley looks at
Bluestein, her wide eyes wider, and asks, "Since when is 4:30 the
evening?" Bluestein looks at Willard, who sensibly asks the woman
behind the counter: "What time does the bingo actually start?" 6:30.
And it will probably go until at least 10. And Buddy Hackett's only
scheduled to do 15 minutes. At 7:30.</TE>
<TE>   7:30. It is now 4:20. "But the buffet opens at 5," the woman
behind the counter says.</TE>
<TE>   The buffet. When plans were made, there had been no mention of a
buffet. The two women turn as one toward Bluestein. He takes a small
step back. He is the only man in the room right now. He has no allies
in this building. He has only two friends who thought they'd play a
little bingo, laugh at Buddy Hackett, be home by, what? Seven? And
they are now facing down a three-hour wait for 15 minutes of Hackett,
3 1/2 hours of bingo at $35 per card pack and a $12 all-you-can-eat
buffet. Even backward, the C in the window is emphatic.</TE>
<TE>   The two women look at each other and a moment in which just about
anything could happen twitches between them. Worley starts to laugh,
and Willard starts to laugh and, in a nervous minute, Bluestein
starts to laugh too.</TE>
<TE>   And for the next five hours or so, they very rarely stop.</TE>
<TE>   Many things separate those who write and perform comedy for a
living from the rest of us, but the biggest thing is laughter. For
most people, laughter is a perk, an occasional windfall from the gods
to remind us that being human is a pretty good deal, all things
considered. Laughter takes the average person by surprise; it always
seems to come from nowhere.</TE>
<TE>   The Currency of Life</TE>
<TE>   For comics, however, laughter is the currency of life. It is the
work and the payoff, the alpha and the omega. They take it seriously,
court it, coax it and when it arrives, they give it lots of room.
Where many people try to control their laughter, to cut it short,
keep it quiet, comedians let their laughter settle in, shift around,
fluff the cushions. They throw back their heads, open their mouths
wide, they hiccup and splutter, lean forward, wipe their eyes, then
start all over again at the mere memory of the joke.</TE>
<TE>   And everything is material for the joke. Even a situation like
this. Especially a situation like this. The women decide that
whatever the outcome of this evening will be, it is too darn good to
miss.</TE>
<TE>   Seats at the end of a table are procured. People come one after
the other like pilgrims to stand in front of Worley. "I know you,"
one woman says staring into her face. "I know you." She points but
gets no more specific than that. Worley smiles and when the woman
leaves simply clears her throat in just that way, and the whole table
roars. Several others ask her to do that "you know, that thing you
do." As quietly as possible, she complies with a shadow of her
trademark trill. "Yes," she says, when asked if people want her to do
that all the time. "Oh, yes."</TE>
<TE>   More people come in, some of them more Beverly Hills than bingo,
older couples fringed with gold and baffled expressions. The buffet
is bland, but the food at least seems safe, and you can't beat the
banana cream pie. Bluestein's cell phone rings almost constantly.
"I'm at the Friars Club playing bingo and waiting for Buddy Hackett,"
he says to a number of people in a tone one might use when calling
Mom from the Oscars or dinner at the White House.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe we're here," says Willard, often, looking around
just to be sure. "I feel like we fell down a rabbit hole."</TE>
<TE>   Serious Bingo</TE>
<TE>   At 6:30, bingo does indeed begin, and it is serious bingo, much
more complicated than anyone at the table remembers from their
childhoods. The payouts are $250 a game, so everyone pays close
attention because that is a lot of money. There are reprimands from
the man running the show about "bingo etiquette" and how it involves
mostly silence. "Bingo etiquette" becomes a much-uttered phrase at
Worley's end of the room.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, at 7:30, Buddy Hackett is introduced. Introduced and
applauded, people stand up for heaven's sake, and he makes his way
past the sequined T-shirts slowly, almost as wide now as he is tall,
but still Buddy Hackett, God bless him, wearing a blazer and gloves.</TE>
<TE>   He speaks for exactly one minute, explains that the folks who
asked him to do this for the Friars Club told him that his presence
would push the crowd to 300-plus but that clearly the anniversary of
Sept. 11 kept everyone in so they'll try again next week. With a wave
for good luck, he is done and heading for the bar through a sea of
uneasy smiles.</TE>
<TE>   At Worley's table, everyone is giddy from butane and waiting, from
bingo and Thousand Island dressing and laughing too hard. That
Hackett has just stiffed the room is just the cherry, the big sloppy
maraschino cherry on top. Hilarious.</TE>
<TE>   "My favorite part," Worley told the young man at the door when she
left, "was that Buddy Hackett. He's still got it. I could just listen
to him all night, couldn't you?"</TE>
<TE>   On the drive home, she and Willard agreed that despite the long
wait and not-quite-fulfilled expectations, the evening had been a
success, hoot-wise. And it could be a great thing to do now and again
if one did not arrive quite so early and if the comics--Rip Taylor
and Sammy Shore are also scheduled for the future--actually did some
material, if they actually called a few games. (The following week's
bingo game featured Rip Taylor and was, by all accounts, a rousing
success.)</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the man who ran the bingo game had asked Worley if she
would come and call a few games one night. She was sweetly
noncommittal. "We'll see," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Then, driving through the dark on Benedict Canyon, Willard
approached a stop sign a bit too quickly for Worley's taste, and
Worley unconsciously did "that thing" that she does--she let out a
full-throated Jo Anne Worley warble, the first real one of the
evening.</TE>
<TE>   And there's nothing you can do but laugh and laugh and laugh.</TE>

<DH>Johnnie Cochran's empire expands, but his goals remain the
same</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTIJANE LEVINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. likes to say he's the same man now as he was
before the O.J. Simpson trial.</LD>
<LD>   Ridiculous. His life is almost unimaginably different. He has been
super-sized. His yearlong exposure on TV has inflated almost
everything about him: his lifestyle, his goals and his opportunities
to achieve them.</LD>
<LD>   Before the trial, Cochran had a single Los Angeles office. Today
he is the Cochran Firm, with 120 lawyers in eight states--and
growing. His web of informal legal alliances extends nationwide, in a
structure so complex that even Cochran cannot easily explain it. He
may expand to the Caribbean, he says.</LD>
<TE>   Cochran now works on about 50 cases at any one time, often in as
many different locations. His private jet facilitates such a
workload.</TE>
<TE>   Before the trial he was a well-known figure in certain Southern
California legal circles. Now his face and name are known everywhere
there is CNN. He may be the first private citizen in history to have
such a huge worldwide recognition factor. Strangers send champagne to
his table, he is whisked to the front of movie lines, he is parodied
on TV, referred to in films. In Soweto, South Africa, little children
saw him and sang "The Johnnie Cochran Song." At the Louvre in Paris,
he was swarmed by well-wishers. On his first New York subway trip,
riders greeted him, and one woman asked him to autograph her Bible.</TE>
<TE>   Cochran's attempts to grapple with this new Imax-sized public
image--and to make worthwhile use of it--may ultimately be more
interesting to cultural historians than the trial that made him so
famous.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, he's written a legal memoir, "A Lawyer's Life" (St.
Martin's Press, with David Fisher), out next month. It's his second
book since the infamous trial and in it, he weaves together his pre-
and post-Simpson cases, to show why he should not be defined by that
one case.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent day in his glass-walled Wilshire Boulevard offices,
Cochran emphasized that the Simpson case, although it had the sexy
plot points of a box office blockbuster, was routine for him in a
legal sense. Just one more example of an accused man receiving as
much justice as he could pay for.</TE>
<TE>   "If Simpson had been poor, he'd be in jail right now, whether he
was innocent or guilty," Cochran says. "In this system, you are
innocent until proven broke. When you are broke, you are pretty much
finished. That's the way it is, not the way it's supposed to be."</TE>
<TE>   He knows many people think he's "some kind of one-shot,
flash-in-the-pan lawyer who used legal mumbo-jumbo and got this guy
off that they thought was guilty."</TE>
<TE>   But it was neither his bad rhymes nor his passionate prose that
won the case, he says. Simpson could afford the best DNA legal
experts (Peter Neufeld and Barry Scheck) and detectives to find
evidence like the Mark Fuhrman tapes. "Fuhrman swore under oath he'd
never used the word 'nigger.' On the tapes he used it frequently. He
committed perjury in a murder trial. It destroyed his credibility."
There are people, Cochran says, who say the prosecution lost its case
because the police tried to frame a guilty man.</TE>
<TE>   Does Cochran think Simpson did it? "Nobody knows but the murdered
and the murderer," he says. "But if the timeline is correct, it would
be pretty impossible."</TE>
<TE>   The case was important to Cochran's career mostly for the wave of
opportunities that flowed from it, he says. He was 57 at the time.
For 30 years before that, he had been taking on police departments
and the municipalities that funded them. He was so successful and
proud of his work long before the Simpson trial that he had been
considering retirement. He had enough money, he says. He also had two
homes in Los Angeles (Los Feliz and Marina del Rey), multiple cars
(including a Rolls-Royce)--and the satisfaction that he had found
justice for many clients.</TE>
<TE>   Long before Simpson, he was well known for lawsuits that alleged
police abuse against his mostly minority clients--and for winning
large settlements from local municipalities that allowed such abuse
to exist. It was a controversial tactic. Many accused him of earning
his living by fleecing taxpayers, who ultimately paid the money that
Cochran won.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Ogletree, professor and associate dean at Harvard Law
School, says Cochran may not have been well known before the
so-called "trial of the century," but decades before Simpson he was
revered in the black community, an inspiration to aspiring black
lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   "They all knew there was a lawyer from Louisiana that would fight
for justice. The cases he took weren't about money. They focused on
aspects of law enforcement that were known to be brutal, abusive and
often unfair to black suspects." He was trying to correct injustice
long ago when, as a young lawyer, he took the case of Elmer
"Geronimo" Pratt. (Cochran lost that case; Black Panther leader Pratt
was convicted in 1972 of murdering a schoolteacher and sentenced to
25 years to life. But Cochran never stopped working to free Pratt,
whose conviction was overturned 27 years later, in 1997.)</TE>
<TE>   Cochran's goal, he says, is to take only those cases involving
significant issues, where he can effect change for whole groups of
people. He wants nothing less, he says, than peaceful revolution.</TE>
<TE>   On this sweltering summer morning, Cochran has been talking
nonstop for 20 minutes, at a pace so fast his words are jumbled
together, his sentences half finished. He cannot seem to get his
thoughts out fast enough.</TE>
<TE>   His voice rises continually as he approaches a crescendo of zeal:
"Let me tell you the bottom line. Whether it's New York, Cleveland,
Memphis, Chicago, Atlanta or D.C.--or wherever I have offices--I want
to change the culture. I want to reverse things so the bad cops fear
the good cops. The way it is now, the bad cops have the run of the
place. There is this blue wall of silence. Nobody will tell on
anybody. Nobody will testify.</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine sodomizing a man in a relatively small police station,
where everybody's within earshot. And it takes five days before an
officer comes forward to talk about it. And that's only 'cause he
talked with his mother and she told him he had to do the right
thing." Cochran was retained by Abner Louima, who was sodomized by a
New York police officer with a plunger. The civil case has been
settled for a total of about $9 million and brought about major
changes in police procedures.</TE>
<TE>   He has been involved in the cases of Amadou Diallo, shot 41 times
by New York police who mistook his wallet for a gun (the officers
were acquitted); and of Gideon Busch, 31, a Brooklyn Hasidic Jew
killed by police for allegedly wielding an 8-inch hammer (a civil
suit charging civil-rights violations is pending). This month, he and
associates settled a case for $900,000 on behalf of Michigan
firefighters who claimed their chief denied rights to women and
blacks. Locally, he currently is representing Maria Paz, whose
husband, Mario, was killed in their bedroom by a SWAT team looking
for drugs, which they never found.</TE>
<TE>   Within just the past few months, Cochran won $4.4 million in a
Nashville police abuse case; $15 million in a Georgia wrongful-death
case and a settlement against a Buffalo, N.Y., mall that prohibited
buses from minority neighborhoods from unloading passengers at its
curb.  But for all his successes, Cochran is not without his
detractors. He has a palimony case pending against him in state
Superior Court by his former companion of 18 years, Patricia Cochran,
who is the mother of his adult son. (He has been married to Dale
Cochran, with whom he has two daughters, since 1985.)</TE>
<TE>   He was recently accused by Pasadena attorney Joe Hopkins of
stealing cases from other attorneys. Cochran says the same claims
have been levied at him in New York and Chicago. "It happens
everywhere. People say, 'Here he comes, he's going to take the case
away.' That's not my goal. These people call me and ask me to
represent them. I would never solicit a case. I don't have to."</TE>
<TE>   Hopkins replies that Cochran doesn't play by the usual rules.
"He's supposed to say, 'Look, it sounds to me like the lawyer you
have is doing a good job. Why not go ahead and stay with him?' He
doesn't do that. It sounds like flat-out greed to me."</TE>
<TE>   Cochran's doesn't dwell on such claims. He has added huge
corporations to his hit list: He has instituted class-action lawsuits
alleging racial or gender discrimination in the workplace against
Johnson &amp; Johnson in New Jersey, Alcoa in Cleveland, Hershey in
Pennsylvania and BellSouth in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   He has formed Cochran Florida as a separate entity with lawyers
there, "to deal in mass torts nationwide" against drug companies who
sell products that are proved to cause severe injury or death.</TE>
<TE>   The mere mention of Cochran's name is now enough to get some
opponents to discuss policy reforms and financial settlements in
situations where they might otherwise have let the case go to trial.</TE>
<TE>   In the Battle Creek, Mich., firefighters' case, for example,
Cochran is proudest not of the financial settlement, but of the
mandatory reforms that will ensure that African Americans and women
will henceforth be allowed to drive firetrucks and perform all other
regular duties that they'd been denied. In his book, Cochran says the
cases that made the most profound impressions and altered the course
of his career were not always big cases and not always winners. "If
one case could be said to have shaped my career, it was the
investigation into the death of Leonard Deadwyler," he writes.</TE>
<TE>   In 1970, Barbara Deadwyler, eight months' pregnant, thought she
was going into labor. Her husband, Leonard, tied a white cloth to
their car antenna, which in their home state of Georgia was a signal
to police that a driver needed assistance. The husband sped toward
the hospital, was stopped by police, and "only when he saw a gun
pointed at him did he understand that he was being pursued, not
assisted."</TE>
<TE>   In his book, Cochran recounts the tale Deadwyler's wife later
told: Her husband pulled off the road, an officer approached with gun
drawn and leaned into the car. Her husband asked him to lead them to
General Hospital. The gun went off at point-blank range. Leonard
Deadwyler said, "But she's having a baby," fell into his wife's lap
and died. (The officer said his gun went off when Deadwyler's car
lurched forward, and the case was determined an accidental homicide.)</TE>
<TE>   Cochran was young, it was the first of many such cases he was to
handle--beatings, chokings, murders--almost all committed under color
of police self-protection, with attorneys having to prove that the
accused did not resist arrest, did not threaten violence. Starting as
a young lawyer in the L.A. city attorney's office, he began to see
patterns in the testimonies of police against defendants he was
trying to convict. "Too often, defendants arrived in court bruised,
beaten, with broken bones," he writes. Cochran's job was to prosecute
them for resisting arrest or interfering with an officer performing
his duties. "It was the same script on a daily basis. The officers
always claimed they'd used reasonable force. A system was working,
just not the legal system."</TE>
<TE>   He writes that he soon realized if a defendant was proved to have
resisted, the city would not be liable for any injuries as a result
of LAPD actions. "I couldn't take it anymore. I couldn't go along to
get along." He soon left to join a law firm, then started his own
practice.</TE>
<TE>   Many cases from the 1960s through the '80s he cites in his book
have a startling similarity to current cases. In 1981, for example,
Cochran represented the family of college football star Ron Settles,
who police said committed suicide in his Signal Hill jail cell. But
evidence pointed to the use of a police chokehold. Cochran won the
largest police abuse settlement in the state at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "On Jan. 10, 1963, I was sworn in" as a member of the bar, he
says. "Here it is 2002, and I am hearing the very same stories. It is
the same situation. These guys expect us to believe them? I am seeing
history repeat itself almost every day." He mentions his current
client in Inglewood, 16-year-old Donovan Jackson, who was handcuffed
by Inglewood officers who were videotaped slamming his head down on a
car, allegedly because he tried to grab the officer's testicles. Two
officers face criminal trial: one is charged with assault, another
with false report writing. All charges have been dropped against
Jackson, whom Cochran describes as "docile, slow to process things,"
and "the least likely person you could meet" to try and grab an
officer. "We call it creative report writing, creative testifying.
Or, as my colleague Alan Dershowitz calls it, testilying. The only
reason that officer has been charged is because there's a videotape
of the incident. And even with a video, the officers usually say that
something happened before the video started to make them behave the
way they did." Cochran's voice is veering toward soprano. He soon
realizes he is sounding antagonistic toward police, which is not his
intention. "I need police; I respect them. If something goes wrong, I
want to call them. I believe most police are good. My own son,
Jonathan Eric Cochran, is a California Highway Patrol officer." His
son's work in law enforcement is mentioned on the first page of his
new book, as if to alert readers that what follows is not an
indictment of all police, just those he considers rotten apples.</TE>
<TE>   Cochran now spends most of his time in New York, where he owns
homes in Manhattan and Long Island, and where he is active in Harlem
civic affairs, and in the Abyssinian church.</TE>
<TE>   When he first got to Manhattan in 1997 to launch a Court TV show,
he recalls, he knew nothing about it. He'd been there only as a
visitor. "I learned where to get a good haircut, who to call for a
toothache; I discovered the corned beef sandwiches at Carnegie Deli."
He also discovered that pastel suits were not the usual legal attire,
and Rolls-Royce not a preferred vehicle. On the East Coast, he has a
Jeep and is ordering a Lincoln Navigator. He has teamed with new good
friends Neufeld and Scheck in a partnership called Cochran, Neufeld &amp;
Scheck that takes only civil-rights cases. He likes their passion,
their ethics, their character, their sense of humor, their love of
sports, their lack of concern for money. "It's not important to them.
They are only concerned about working to make a positive change in
society. I love these guys." Neufeld returns the compliment. Talking
by phone, he says that Cochran, Scheck and he "all share the same
passion, to do the most meaningful work possible. In the aftermath of
the Simpson case, we had access to legislators, to courts, to
leaders. People would listen. We want cases that can result in
significant changes to make better a flawed system." A visitor points
out to Cochran that Neufeld and Scheck are Jewish and that the
tension between blacks and Jews in New York has been widely reported.
Has Cochran encountered any antagonism from his African American
colleagues because he is so close to the pair?</TE>
<TE>   "Relations are strained between the two groups," he says. "I think
we all need to take another look, try to understand one another. When
I took the case of Reginald Denny, people said, 'How could you? He's
white, and you're going against black guys.' I said those black guys
who bashed Denny's head in are thugs. They are black thugs. I have
fought all my career for some kind of equality, and then you tell me
not to represent Reginald Denny because he's white? You have to be
crazy."</TE>

<LD>* My favorite dinosaur is archaeopteryx. It is estimated to have been
the size of a crow. Paleontologists are uncertain whether it could
fly like birds today. It was probably a ground-dweller that could
leap into the air and glide while it caught flying insects to eat.</LD>

<LD>"Nory Ryan's Song"</LD>
<LD>   by Patricia Reilly Giff</LD>
<LD>   The main characters of this story were Sean Red Mallon, Nory Ryan,
Maggie, Celia, Granda and Da. The setting of this story was Ireland
during the Irish Potato Famine.</LD>
<TE>   In the beginning, Sean and Nory were at the top of a small hill
where there is Patrick's Well, a deep wishing well. Nory and Sean,
her best friend, made wishes and prayers. As she was wishing and
praying she thought of what Granda had said to her, "Those prayers
will take a long time to get answered."</TE>
<TE>   When the Potato Famine got worse, so did Celia, Nory's middle
sister. Everyone's problems got worse. Read the book to find out what
happened next.</TE>

<TE>   "Teach Us, Amelia Bedelia"</TE>
<TE>   by Peggy Parish</TE>
<TE>   This is a funny story about Amelia Bedelia, who becomes a
substitute teacher by mistake. The first thing that happens is she
was supposed to call roll. She thought it meant the kind you eat, so
she asked if anyone in the class had a roll in his or her lunchbox,
so she could call it. Then, for science time, the children are
supposed to plant a bulb, so she runs to the store and buys light
bulbs. She makes a lot of funny mistakes like that. Just read the
book and find out the rest.</TE>

<TE>   "The Transall Saga"</TE>
<TE>   by Gary Paulsen</TE>
<TE>   This book is about a boy named Mark who gets transported to a
different place by a blue light. He encounters savages and people
with webbed feet.</TE>
<TE>   First, he is transported to a deep forest. He uses his hiking
skills to survive. He eats bugs and special coconut-like fruit called
a tree rock. Later, he makes weapons and hunts for animals.</TE>
<TE>   Mark is taken to a tribe called the Arrow People. The Tsook tribe
attacks the Arrow people. The Tsook have swords and armor while the
Arrow People have wooden clubs and arrows. Mark is taken as a
prisoner by the Tsook and sold as a slave.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the Tsook tell Mark that they know a shaman who talks
about the lights.</TE>
<TE>   Will he find out stuff about the light and get back to his time?
Or will he stay forever in the place called Transall?</TE>
<TE>   I like this book a lot because he has to learn how to survive in a
whole new environment. Mark learns new languages and makes friends.</TE>

<LD>Julius Schulman, noted architectural photographer, and Gil Garcetti,
soon-to-be recognized photographer, fail to mention the seminal
photographic essay on steelworkers and book, "Men at Work," by master
photographer Lewis Hine ("From Ground Up, a Chronicle of Sweat,
Steel," Sept. 20). This groundbreaking documentation by Hine, of the
construction of the Empire State Building, first published in 1932 by
the Macmillan Co., certainly supersedes Garcetti's coverage of Disney
Hall.</LD>

<LD>I thought having to endure cell phones at the beach was a nuisance
("Withdrawing Into Our Cells," Sept. 19). After all, isn't the beach
a place to get away from it all? But this week, as I sat in a
bathroom stall (one of the few semiprivate places left in life), the
woman in the stall next to me received a cell call. She answered it,
started talking to the person on the other end and laughingly stated
that she was in a stall in the ladies' bathroom.</LD>
<LD>   Yikes! Please, it's one thing if you choose to sit on a toilet and
talk to someone that you feel comfortable enough doing that
(preferably in your home). But to invite others to share my
experience in the bathroom is another story.</LD>
<LD>   Stop with the communication already! The world will wait for a few
minutes.</LD>

<LD>Thank you for printing Gore Vidal's comments on the state of
publishing and the real dynamic of author-editor relationships in
today's world ("Vidal's War of Words With Editor Continues," Sept.
18). As an author who has suffered the ego and sloth of a so-called
"well-known and highly respected editor," I can well attest to the
veracity of Mr. Vidal's assertions. With few exceptions, the Jason
Epsteins of this world do nothing for the authors they represent but
pass the manuscript along to the copy editor, take credit when the
book succeeds and claim "I knew it all along" if it fails.</LD>

<LD>It is surprising to me, a blended American, that the black community
has not taken up this horrific story ("A Baby and an Outcry," Sept.
17) and run with it, worldwide, as an example of religious bigotry at
its worst.</LD>
<LD>   It is shocking that black women are not demonstrating, boycotting
at the Nigerian Embassy in Washington and other capitals around the
world. Why not? What are you waiting for? If you think the nice men
are going to have a change of heart [about stoning her to death] and
grant her a reprieve, think again.</LD>
<LD>   Any hint of such egregious treatment in America today, be it by
clergy, or any other self-appointed judgmental group, would bring
down instant riots by Jesse, Al, and Louis, plus lawsuits by
Johnnie.... so why aren't those black civil right leaders speaking
out about this Nigerian woman's plight? Where is Maxine Waters' voice
in this tragedy?</LD>

<LD>Maybe it's because I spent so much of my childhood in my dad's
barbershop, pretending not to listen to the ribald jokes, the insults
exchanged, the conspiracy theories masquerading as political
commentary among the assortment of characters who frequented the shop
my father and his brothers owned.</LD>
<LD>   That's probably what makes the new--and now controversial--movie
"Barbershop" feel like as true a slice of urban black life as I have
ever seen on screen.</LD>
<LD>   And it's also what makes the current uproar over the irreverent
statements made in the film by one of its more outrageous characters
seem so ridiculous to me.</LD>
<TE>   The movie, a comedy about a day in the life of a barbershop on
Chicago's South Side, led the box office for the two weekends since
its release, thanks largely to support by black moviegoers. Now, the
film--written, directed and produced by blacks, with an uplifting
message and largely black cast--has landed at the center of a
firestorm stoked by a handful of black activists upset over a flurry
of insults aimed at legendary heroes of the civil rights movement.</TE>
<TE>   They're demanding that movie-goers disavow the film, that the
offensive passages be excised, that the filmmakers and MGM deliver a
public apology for allowing dialogue that insults civil rights icons
Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Never mind that the barber who issues the insults is derided by
everyone else in the shop. "Is this a barbershop?" he asks, as they
shout him down. If you can't "talk straight" in a barbershop, then
there's nowhere left to speak your mind.</TE>
<TE>   I admit I cringed at the offensive lines. They can't be repeated
here, but portray Martin Luther King Jr. as a philanderer and Rosa
Parks as less than sincere.</TE>
<TE>   But I also cringed later when I heard activist Al Sharpton assert
in an interview that "there's nobody in the black community who
believes that [Martin Luther King]" engaged in sexual infidelity."
Sharpton's been a busy man if he has heard from everyone in the black
community.</TE>
<TE>   And if he truly believes that every black person thinks--or even
feels the need to believe--that King was squeaky clean, he hasn't
spent much time in a barbershop (no hair joke intended) or listening
to Larry Elder types on talk radio.</TE>
<TE>   The truth is, the black community is not nearly as monolithic and
of-one-mind as either our critics or our so-called leaders would like
us to be.</TE>
<TE>   That may make controlling us as frustrating to them as trying to
herd cats, but we have always drawn strength from our diversity.</TE>
<TE>   Good people can, and do, disagree. Even in my own household, we
were not of one mind as we left the movie theater last week.</TE>
<TE>   My 11-year-old daughter, who idolizes Rosa Parks, was hurt that
the "weird guy" in the movie "used the a-word" in the same breath
that he mentioned Parks, as he observed dismissively that she didn't
"do nothing but sit" down.</TE>
<TE>   And my fiance was troubled by the disrespect the insults implied:
It's bad enough when white folks denigrate black heroes. Must we also
hold them up to ridicule just for a laugh? He'd like to see those
lines cut from the movie, though he admits to more than a passing
familiarity with fellows much like the on-screen buffoon.</TE>
<TE>   I understand the protective instinct, the notion expressed by an
outraged Jesse Jackson that some things are too sacred to joke about.
Sometimes illuminating our private differences feels like airing
dirty laundry in public.</TE>
<TE>   But if we're serious about keeping it real, about making art that
portrays our lives, about respecting authenticity, then this is not
the place to bring the airbrush out.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson and Sharpton have complained that children will form
negative views of black leaders because of a few insulting jokes in
the movie. And I wonder why they're not more concerned about, say,
the insulting lyrics in rap music and the negative images of women
that our children see day in, day out in music videos.</TE>
<TE>   Where's the outrage over that? And where is the demand that the
dirty words come out, that we boycott black artists and stations that
offer up little more than images of half-naked women gyrating around
men who seem to have nothing on their minds but sex, money and
Hennessy?</TE>
<TE>   Tell me, what's the greater threat, a few distasteful jokes in an
otherwise uplifting movie, or a steady diet of images that reduce
black men and women to caricatures of carnal superficiality?</TE>
<TE>   If your children are old enough to see "Barbershop," rated PG-13,
and they don't already know the truth about Rosa Parks and Martin
Luther King Jr., then the shame rests on you, not the movie.</TE>
<TE>   After all, Rosa Parks didn't stay in her seat on the bus just
because she was tired. It was not just a random move by an exhausted
seamstress, but a strategic act of defiance by the secretary of the
local NAACP, intended to mobilize a community.</TE>
<TE>   And yes, it was uncomfortable for me to field questions from my
daughter on the way home from the movie, about why King was
criticized with a word more commonly found in the lyrics to rap
songs, referring to girls who sleep around. But as I explained to her
the allegations of his infidelity, the message was that our human
failings don't obliterate our capacity to do great things.</TE>
<TE>   By the same token, "Barbershop" might not be flawless. But the
movie has a story worth telling, characters worth knowing and a
message worth hearing. And we don't have to be ashamed of a
less-than-perfect rendering of our history and humanity.</TE>

<LD>Mamma Mia!</LD>
<LD>   Call it a social triathlon: They wined and dined. They watched the
opening night performance of "Mamma Mia!" They discoed at a
post-performance cast party. And so it went for patrons of the Center
Theatre Group who celebrated the launch of its 36th season at a
sellout benefit that netted $160,000 for its outreach programs. "This
is our most successful gala ever," Betsy Applebaum, co-chairwoman,
said as she welcomed hundreds of guests to a cocktail reception at
the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.</LD>
<LD>   The buzz (besides the one for the group's nostalgic new season at
the Ahmanson Theatre, which includes Lily Tomlin in her Tony
Award-winning performance in "The Search for Signs of Intelligent
Life in the Universe") was for the recent opening in New York of
three productions first presented by Center Theatre Group--"My Old
Lady," "In Real Life" and a new version of "Flower Drum Song." "They
all started here," said Gordon Davidson, the group's artistic
director and producer. "I present these primarily for our community,
but the good stuff always moves on."</LD>
<TE>   Tomlin was guest of honor at the formal dinner--with filet mignon
and potatoes layered with artichokes--staged at tables topped with
towering sprays of white orchids in the pavilion's Grand Hall. "It is
fitting that we would bring 'Search for Signs' here because, as you
know, L.A. is the center of the universe," said Tomlin, as she
addressed guests such as gala co-chairs Harold Applebaum and Sheri
and Les Biller. "The Music Center is always a good place to find
intelligent life, and it wouldn't be possible without generous people
like you."</TE>
<TE>   Also on the guest list at the Sept. 20 gala: Judi Davidson,
Richard Kagan, Julie Hagerty, Patty Glaser, Lainie Kazan, Piper
Laurie, Corina and Antonio Villaraigosa, Shelly Freeman, Brian
Hargrove, Adela and John Ohanesian and Mara Brock Akil.</TE>
<TE>   Moving Forward</TE>
<TE>   Standing in for her late husband, beloved L.A. Laker announcer
Chick Hearn, Marge Hearn took the spotlight at a gala netting
$200,000 for the Dorr Institute for Arthritis Research &amp; Education
and Operation Walk, a surgical outreach program for disadvantaged
arthritis patients. "We planned for this to be a celebration with
Chick. This was something he really wanted to do," said orthopedic
surgeon Lawrence D. Dorr, the institute's medical director. "We are
so grateful that Marge is here--she's had a lot of requests" for
appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Dressed in a glittering jacket for the gala at the Regent Beverly
Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills, Hearn said it felt "strange" to be
without the man to whom she was married "a couple of days short of 64
years." "This is my first experience of being alone [in public], but
I feel very much at home with this group," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband, who had hip-replacement surgery earlier this year,
believed in Operation Walk's outreach to the underserved, she said.
"He loved the fact that it helped people who couldn't afford the
surgery." Also honored was orthopedic nurse Jeri Ward, winner of the
inaugural Audrey Skirball Kenis Community Service Award.</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1994, Operation Walk has provided hip- and
knee-replacement surgery for about 250 people in developing nations
and the U.S., Dorr said. "These are crippled people who can't walk
because they have such severe arthritis," he said. "Since they have
no medical insurance, the surgery is like a miracle that drops out of
the sky for them."</TE>
<TE>   During the Sept. 21 festivities, Dorr announced that the Audrey
Skirball Kenis Foundation had recently given a $1-million grant to
Operation Walk. "In some ways, we have called it Audrey's walk," Dorr
said of the late philanthropist for whom the foundation is named.
"Audrey, her husband, Charles Kenis, and the foundation have been the
biggest supporters of these trips."</TE>
<TE>   On the guest list: Bob Steiner, Bill Bertka, Judy and Buddy
Litten, Linda and Harvey Vechery, Linda and Stu Lantz, Arnie and
Carol Cohen, Kathy and Rich Cardarette, Elgin Baylor, Jamal Wilkes
and Ruben Bird.</TE>
<TE>   Komen Awards</TE>
<TE>   A breast cancer survivor and a tireless health advocate, Sandy
Finestone was presented with two awards at a Sept. 19 reception
honoring sponsors of the Komen Orange County Race for the Cure:
Volunteer of the Year (from the local affiliate of the Susan G. Komen
Breast Cancer Foundation) and the National Komen Outstanding
Volunteer of the Year for Lifetime Achievement.</TE>
<TE>   "I got involved with this group because I like the Komen
philosophy," said Finestone, a psychologist who underwent a double
mastectomy when she was diagnosed with multifocal breast cancer 19
years ago. "Twenty-five percent of all funds we raise goes to the
national office and 100% of that goes to cancer research.
Seventy-five percent stays in the local community and we can use it
for what needs to be done."</TE>
<TE>   Also receiving awards for their work on behalf of the foundation
were Marie Blash and Bill Saksa.</TE>
<TE>   Finestone advises women not to be afraid of breast cancer. "I tell
them to take good care of themselves and do regular breast self-exams
and yearly mammograms," Finestone said during the event at the Turnip
Rose in Costa Mesa. "The most important thing now is that women don't
have to lose their breasts--and with detection, they absolutely don't
have to lose their lives."</TE>
<TE>   Last Sunday, about 30,000 people participated in the Newport Beach
race, which raised about $1.5 million. Since it was founded in 1992,
the Orange County chapter of the Komen Foundation has raised more
than $7.7 million for cancer research.</TE>
<TE>   Starry Night</TE>
<TE>   Celebrating the museum's new exhibit, "George Romney, 1734-1802:
British Art's Forgotten Genius," patrons of the Huntington Library,
Art Collections and Botanical Gardens in San Marino gathered for an
alfresco benefit on Sept. 21 that raised more than $200,000 for
operations and programs.</TE>
<TE>   "Grandeur in the Gardens" also marked the unveiling of the
facility's Rose Hills Foundation Conservatory for Botanical Science,
due to open in 2004. During the event, library board chairman Robert
Wycoff announced that the National Science Foundation had donated a
$1.4 million grant to create the conservatory's botanical and
educational components. Ruth and Ed Shannon were gala
co-chairpersons.</TE>
<TE>   Mac Tonight</TE>
<TE>   Dining on burgers and fries under glass, supporters of the Los
Angeles Ronald McDonald House attended a bash in the City of Industry
on Sept. 14 that raised $235,000 for its residential facility for
children with life-threatening illnesses and their families. The
house provides free or low-cost accommodations for families with
children who are hospitalized and outpatients who are away from home.
Dick Hale and Barbara Vanderhoop were co-chairpersons.</TE>

<HD>A Quarter for Your Thoughts</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Something exciting is happening in California. Gov. Gray Davis is
encouraging people of all ages to submit a design for the new
California state quarter. Anyone who was born in California or is a
current resident of the state can participate. The governor is
looking for designs that capture the heart of California and its
diverse culture. The quarter will be put in circulation in January of
2005.</LD>
<LD>   The State Quarter Program</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Mint 50 State Quarter Program began in 1999. Since then,
the U.S. Mint has released five new state quarters each year. The
coins are being released according to when each state joined the
Union or signed the Constitution. Since California became a state
Sept. 9, 1850, it will become the 31st commemorative quarter in
circulation. By the year 2008, all 50 state quarters will have been
circulated.</LD>
<TE>   How It Works</TE>
<TE>   Davis has appointed 20 people to a special committee to review the
designs sent to him. The committee will choose 20 drawings that best
represent the state of California. From these semifinalists, the
governor will then choose five finalists and forward the drawings to
the U.S. Mint.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Mint will review the five designs to make sure that each
one can be reproduced on the quarter. The mint will then return the
designs to the governor, who will make the final selection.</TE>
<TE>   Get Started</TE>
<TE>   What do you think should be on the coin? Something to do with the
Gold Rush? One of California's national parks? Grizzly bears?
Redwoods? Death Valley? Mt. Whitney? The Mojave Desert? The Golden
Gate Bridge? A movie camera? Designs may include landmarks,
landscapes, historic buildings, resources, industries, plants,
animals or outlines of the state.</TE>
<TE>   The rules say your design must be in pencil, black ink or in a
computer-aided format and be drawn on the official quarter template.</TE>
<TE>   It must be sent through the U.S. mail and include a signed release
form. To get a copy of the official template, a release form and a
complete list of rules and other information, go to
www.governor.ca.gov. Do not send your designs to the newspaper. Mail
submissions to: Office of the Governor of California, Attn:
California Quarter Design, State Capitol Building, Sacramento, CA
95814.</TE>
<TE>   Designs must be received by Nov. 9.</TE>

Kids' Reading Room. Her stories include: "State Quarters: Cool

<DH>Walk-on Dillingham earns key spot for the Irish</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SOUTH BEND, Ind.</DL>
<LD>Pat Dillingham already has authored a Hollywood ending more unlikely
than "Rudy."</LD>
<LD>   And it may just be the first chapter in the Dillingham story.</LD>
<LD>   Not only has Dillingham gone from walk-on to scholarship player,
he led the Irish to a come-from-behind win to keep their surprising
unbeaten season going. Even more unlikely, he is listed as Notre
Dame's starting quarterback--at least until Carlyle Holiday returns
from a shoulder injury.</LD>
<TE>   "At this time last year, I don't think I could have pictured
this," Dillingham said.</TE>
<TE>   Who could have? The Irish, off to their worst start ever at 0-3 a
year ago, are ranked No. 10 and their quarterback against Stanford on
Oct. 5 could be a 6-1, 209-pound sophomore whose team went 2-8 when
he was a high school senior. He wasn't offered any scholarships.</TE>
<TE>   "People are saying it's 'Rudy' all over again," said Mike
Mitchell, Dillingham's coach at St. Francis High in Mountain View,
Calif.. "It's not. Rudy never got in a game that counted and brought
them back."</TE>
<TE>   Different in a lot of ways. Dillingham didn't have the hard life
that Rudy Ruettiger did. Ruettiger, one of 14 children in his family,
was a die-hard Irish fan but couldn't afford college. He got a job
out of high school as a turbine operator, joined the Navy and, at 23,
pursued his dream of playing for Notre Dame after a friend died.</TE>
<TE>   "My story was not a football story," Ruettiger said. "My story was
more about going against the odds of what life was handing me. I was
just looking to survive and to fulfill that one moment that we're all
looking for. Dillingham has done that, too, though."</TE>
<TE>   Dillingham didn't grow up a big Notre Dame fan. His father is the
team physician with the San Francisco 49ers, and Dillingham remembers
players such as Joe Montana coming by the house for treatment.</TE>
<TE>   He fell in love with Notre Dame while attending summer camp after
his junior year. Dillingham decided to walk-on even though the Irish
had four quarterbacks on scholarship and he didn't have the running
ability needed to run the option.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to tell him he should probably look at some Division II
schools, but he said Notre Dame was where he wanted to go," Mitchell
said.</TE>
<TE>   He was so far down the depth chart last season that he never even
learned the offense. As scout team quarterback, he was too busy
learning opponents' offenses.</TE>
<TE>   He moved up the depth chart through attrition. Jared Clark
switched to tight end in the spring and Matt LoVecchio transferred to
Indiana. That left only Dillingham and another walk-on as backups to
Holiday.</TE>
<TE>   Following a workout in July, Dillingham was floored when he was
awakened from a nap by a telephone call from Coach Tyrone
Willingham's secretary saying she had scholarship papers for him to
sign.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't see it coming," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Things kept getting better. Even after the arrival of Chris Olsen,
a highly rated recruit from New Jersey, Dillingham kept the No. 2
job. He even got out on the field late against Maryland in the
opener. There was a slight miscue--he was introduced by the
public-address announcer as Jason Beckstrom, an injured Irish
cornerback who also wears No. 9.</TE>
<TE>   Dillingham didn't attempt a pass and he didn't get carried off the
field on his teammates' shoulders like Ruettiger did after his
27-second appearance in 1975. But Dillingham's story didn't end
there.</TE>
<TE>   He kept getting ready for his chance, standing behind Holiday in
practices and envisioning himself running the offense.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach always told me I'm one hit away," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That one hit occurred late in the third quarter against Michigan
State, when Holiday was tackled and landed awkwardly on his left
shoulder. The Irish fell behind, 17-14, with 1:45 left, but
Dillingham brought them back quickly. He completed a pass, then
Michigan State was called for pass interference. Dillingham threw an
eight-yard pass to Arnaz Battle, who made a few moves and turned it
into a game-winning 60-yard touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Dillingham doesn't want the story to end there. Although the Irish
are hopeful Holiday will be ready for Stanford, they are working to
get Dillingham ready.</TE>
<TE>   Willingham has warned Dillingham not to get caught up in the
attention. Willingham knows. He was a walk-on at Michigan State in
1972 who later got a scholarship. Two years later, he went 3-1 as a
starter after Charlie Baggett got hurt.</TE>
<TE>   Willingham has confidence in Dillingham, saying that in the West
Coast offense, the most important factor for a quarterback is good
decision-making.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he'll be one of those guys that just has that kind of
calm to him about his play, most things won't bother him too much,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   And even if Holiday is ready to play against Stanford, Dillingham
knows he's one hit away.</TE>
<TE>   "I've learned just from being here with all the changes that have
happened that when opportunities come your way, you better be
prepared," he said. "This is my opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   What more could a walk-on ask for--except maybe a ride off the
field on the shoulders of his teammates and a Hollywood movie deal.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Averaging a league-leading 38 points, the New England Patriots are
discovering that it isn't enough to simply rate as the team to beat
in the NFL, which has been their status since they displaced the Rams
in the Super Bowl at the beginning of the year.</LD>
<LD>   It takes more than sound coaching and great players for any
football club to keep winning. It also takes some luck and a strong
emotional investment. Above all, football is a game of emotion.</LD>
<LD>   The Patriots could well be reminded of this today as the NFL
matches two of its seven unbeaten teams at San Diego.</LD>
<TE>   Even though they have the Chargers clearly outmanned, this is a
game that could be won by the players who put their hearts as well as
their backs into it.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, when the Kansas City Chiefs went to Foxboro, the
Patriots didn't take a nine-point underdog seriously.</TE>
<TE>   They finally won, 41-38, only because they'd won the overtime coin
toss after a 42-point fourth quarter in which everybody scored at
will.</TE>
<TE>   Each side made three touchdowns in that last quarter, and, beyond
much doubt, it would have been not Patriot quarterback Tom Brady but
Kansas City running back Priest Holmes taking charge in the game's
only overtime possession if the coin had landed right for the Chiefs.</TE>
<TE>   For emotion is most of defense and the New England defense never
did get into the game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dolphins Next</TE>
<TE>   Seven days hence, in the league's Week 5 headliner at Miami, the
Patriots can be expected to get serious about the Dolphins.</TE>
<TE>   That one is already being talked about as the first really big
game of the NFL season, so both sides will show up.</TE>
<TE>   As yet, it isn't easy to know how good the Dolphins are. Their 3-0
start--against winless Detroit, shaky Indianapolis, and a New York
Jet team that still seems shellshocked after a 44-7 beating by New
England--has provided some clues but nothing definitive.</TE>
<TE>   What every Patriot fan is doubtless wondering about is not San
Diego quarterback Drew Brees this week but Miami running back Ricky
Williams next week.</TE>
<TE>   The question: If Kansas City's Holmes could run for 180 yards
against New England, how far will Williams get? A former problem
child in New Orleans, Williams has started a new life with three
100-yard games and could make it four against the Chiefs today. And
what then? Five in Week 5?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Emotion Card</TE>
<TE>   Of the many things about New England Coach Bill Belichick--in his
first season as a front-runner--the most helpful, possibly, is that
he understands not only pass offense now but how to play the emotion
card.</TE>
<TE>   He knew, for instance, that the Patriots would have to take Kansas
City in stride. During a 17-week season, no champion can think of
every opponent as a must victim in a big game.</TE>
<TE>   There are, in competitive sports, always periods of up and down,
and in their Kansas City game the Patriots were emotionally down.</TE>
<TE>   Belichick, though, has always been a knowledgeable motivator who,
to enjoy another successful season, realized earlier this month that
he had to get the Patriots up for their Monday night opener against
the favored Steelers.</TE>
<TE>   And he did.</TE>
<TE>   Then, immediately, he had to get them up for another spotlighted
start in New York against the favored Jets. And again he did.</TE>
<TE>   In the Kansas City game, though, with fast-moving Miami looming,
Belichick had to give his emotionally spent players the day off, and,
again, he did.</TE>
<TE>   That was apparent as early as the Patriots' first offensive series
against Kansas City, a series ruined by a dropped pass and a penalty.
Whenever football players aren't quite ready mentally or emotionally,
they drop passes, draw penalties for avoidable errors, and make other
mistakes that good players usually avoid.</TE>
<TE>   And by the end of the quarter, the Patriots had dropped four
passes, had earned five more penalties, and had made other kinds of
mistakes they never made while, say, beating the Rams in the Super
Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Still Throwing</TE>
<TE>   Bill Walsh, the former San Francisco coach who in the 1980s
brought passing back to the NFL after the running-play doldrums of
the 1960s and '70s, has often said that one of the advantages of
pass-play football is that passing teams are more resistant than
running teams to up-and-down cycles. It takes less emotional energy
to throw and catch than to smash through the line.</TE>
<TE>   And that's one reason the Patriots survived the Kansas City game.</TE>
<TE>   By repeatedly throwing Brady had four touchdown passes while
totaling 410 yards passing to lead the league for the week.</TE>
<TE>   Before he got started, however, the lethargic Patriots fell
behind, 10-0, in the second quarter. Even when they did things right,
they did something wrong. As rookie Deion Branch returned a punt 53
yards to give the Patriots some first-quarter momentum, they gave it
back with an unnecessary late hit.</TE>
<TE>   During the games of the NFL's first 50 or 60 years, good teams
getting an emotionally slow start often finished apathetically. But
this is the league's 83rd season, and we're in a passing era for
teams that know what passing means--such as Belichick's this season.</TE>

<HD>Jordan Knows How to Romance a City</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY KORNHEISER</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last season Michael Jordan had the fire and needed the ice. He had
knee surgery during the offseason and now says he is ready to go.</LD>
<LD>   For Washington, This Is a Fine Romance</LD>
<LD>   He's baaaaaaack.</LD>
<TE>   Those of you who were waiting for the other $175 Nike to drop, you
can relax.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Jordan isn't ditching us.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last several months there were many people on many
occasions who offered how they didn't think Jordan would play
anymore. To a man they knew Jordan wanted to play. They know Jordan
burns to play.</TE>
<TE>   But they considered the way Jordan went out last season--with a
knee injury that seemed a metaphor for the cumulative shock his body
had absorbed over so many years of jumping so high and landing so
hard. And they considered that he would be 40 years old this season,
and they suggested the strain on Jordan's body would be too great.
Most of the folks who held that view are easy to dismiss; they're
sportswriters. But two of them were Doug Collins and Phil Jackson. So
it made news when they said they had a hunch Jordan might be done.</TE>
<TE>   We'd be crazy not to think Jordan had the same hunch. Wanting to
play is one thing. Even needing to play. But what if the spirit is
willing, and the flesh is weak? The last thing Jordan would want is
to embarrass himself on the stage he has ruled for so many years. You
can get by with losing a step here and there. But you'd better still
be able to dance.</TE>
<TE>   So this is how Michael Jordan spends his summer vacations these
days: Training to see if he can still play basketball. Last year he
was satisfied he could come back after three years away. This year
he's satisfied he can come back after knee surgery. Or maybe he's
looking to believe it. How does that song go? "Oh, it's a long, long
time from May to December. But the days grow short when you reach
September."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan coming back is good news for Washington--the city as much
as the basketball team. He is like a butterfly in that he won't be
around long, but in full flight his beauty can lift our spirits. And
the beauty is powerful enough to rule you. For Washington, having
Jordan in town is like having a romance with a gorgeous girl you know
is going to eventually break your heart by leaving. It's like dating
Julia Roberts; you know it's never going to last--but in the meantime
you're dating Julia Roberts.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement released by the Wizards, Jordan is quoted saying he
is "excited" to return to the court, that he "loves" basketball and
that he is feeling "very strong." It is unclear how many times you
have to pull the string on Estee Portnoy's head to get these
responses.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan is also quoted as saying, "No decisions have been made as
to my exact role on the team, but I expect Coach Collins will make
those assessments next week in training camp." How about we take a
guess? How about: Michael Jordan will play as much as he likes,
wherever he likes, for as long as he likes.</TE>
<TE>   Because here's what's true: The next time Jordan gets
substantively hurt--like with a knee injury--and he has to miss a
bunch of games, that's sayonara, baby. This is the last go-round, and
it only lasts as long as Jordan's healthy. So however much time he
spends on the bench at the beginning of each game, he isn't putting
on satin shorts to get a modeling deal.</TE>
<TE>   He will play 30-35 minutes, often more. Playing with Jerry
Stackhouse will energize Jordan, and make the Wizards big fun for
him. He's played against Stackhouse and Brendan Haywood for years in
pickup games in Chapel Hill. For years he's played against the new
assistant coach, Patrick Ewing (and teamed with him at the 1992
Olympics); they're fast friends. He's had a whole summer to consider
how to get the most out of his prized pick from last year, Kwame
Brown. He's got eager young kids like Jared Jeffries and Juan Dixon
to study at his feet like acolytes. This could be swell. This could
be, "Hey, kids, let's go out to the barn and put on a show!" Who
knows, this bunch could make the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   My concern is that when Jordan's gone this time, he's gone
forever. I have always thought Michael Jordan was on loan to us, like
a museum piece. He lives in Chicago. He loves Chicago. He belongs in
Chicago. I'll bet he's back there, running the Bulls, within two
years. And that's OK. We can console ourselves by remembering he
picked us to sing his last songs to. It's right out of "Casablanca."
We'll always have Jordan. Here's looking at you, kid.</TE>
<TE>   Having Jordan here was--and is--a joy. Even in his descent he's a
greater player and by far a greater figure than this basketball team
has seen since the glory days of Wes Unseld, now almost 25 years
gone. Having Jordan here is like holding a seashell in your hand, and
you cup it to your ear and hear the echo of small triumphs and hearty
laughter. Even years from now you'll hear, "Number 23 for your
Washington Wizards, Michael Jordan" ambling through your head like in
a dream. And even though he always looked better in red and black,
you'll smile at the time he passed through our town and took us with
him dancing in the dark.</TE>

<DH>Monday Marks 75th Anniversary of Season When Ruth Hit 60
Home Runs</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>In the Golden Age of sports, America's athletic landscape was
dominated by larger than life characters--Dempsey and Tunney, Jones
and Tilden, Grange and Thorpe.</LD>
<LD>   All were giants. All were overshadowed by Babe Ruth.</LD>
<LD>   Baseball was king in those days, and Ruth was the king of
baseball, the centerpiece of a New York Yankee team on its way to
becoming the most successful sports franchise in history.</LD>
<TE>   Much of that history revolves around the man who hit 714 home runs
and a record 60 in 1927. Monday marks the 75th birthday of No. 60,
the diamond anniversary of a most dramatic diamond event.</TE>
<TE>   These were the Miller Huggins Yankees of Gehrig and Lazzeri,
Meusel and Combs, a team that would win 110 games and lose just 44.
And most of the reason was Ruth.</TE>
<TE>   He came to the Yankees in 1920 and hit an astounding 54 home runs
that year, more homers all by himself than the entire roster of any
other team. A year later, he pushed that number to 59.</TE>
<TE>   He was the Bambino, a rollicking slugger of gargantuan appetites
and accomplishments, always relishing the spotlight, always
commanding attention. And in 1927, he punctuated his power numbers
with an exclamation point-- 60 home runs.</TE>
<TE>   It is an old number now, an obscure footnote to the 73 homers
Barry Bonds hit last season, the 70 that Mark McGwire had in 1998 and
the 61 that Roger Maris hit in 1961. But in 1927, Ruth's 60 was
pretty special.</TE>
<TE>   The game on Sept. 30, 1927, at Yankee Stadium was rather
insignificant. The Yankees had long since wrapped up their fifth
American League pennant, all of them achieved after Ruth arrived.
They would finish 19 games in front of Connie Mack's Philadelphia
Athletics.</TE>
<TE>   But every game was a showcase for Ruth, a chance for the Babe to
do something special. He had tied his record of 59 home runs when he
hit a pair the day before in a 15-4 rout of Washington, and now, with
two games left in the season, he would be swinging to break it.</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, he challenged his teammates. "I'll bet anyone 10
bucks I hit one," he announced.</TE>
<TE>   There were no takers.</TE>
<TE>   There were just 10,000 fans rattling around cavernous Yankee
Stadium that day. The Yankees and Senators were tied at 2-2 in the
eighth inning. Mark Koenig, who had tripled, was on third base as the
Babe settled into the batter's box and Tom Zachary went to work
against him.</TE>
<TE>   Ruth swung at a pitch and sent a shot toward right field.</TE>
<TE>   "Foul ball!" Zachary shouted.</TE>
<TE>   No such luck. Ruth's ball, halfway up the right field bleachers,
was fair by 10 feet and the Babe circled the bases with those little
baby steps that became his trademark. It was his 17th home run of the
month and last at-bat of the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   Zachary was not pleased. Asked about the record home run years
later, he said, "If you really want to know the truth, I'd rather
have thrown at his big, fat head."</TE>
<TE>   When Ruth reached home plate, he doffed his cap to the fans, who
threw torn-up scorecards in an impromptu confetti celebration. At the
dugout, with his teammates banging their bats on the floor in
tribute, the Babe exulted over his accomplishment.</TE>
<TE>   "That's 60," he said, "count 'em, 60. Let [someone] match that."</TE>
<TE>   It would take 34 years before somebody did.</TE>

<HD>HIGH RESOLUTION</HD>
<DH>Welcome to the next generation of the home office, where
all the technological bells and whistles, a computer (or two or
three), an answering machine and a fax machine are de rigueur. But so
are a high-speed networking system, scanner, printer and copier.
Throw in task lighting, a surround-sound system and ergonomic tables
and chairs, and the conventional workplace has nothing on today's
fully wired home office. Step inside the personal spaces of five
Southern Californians who've taken the home office to a higher level.</DH>

<LD>BUNKER IN THE HILL</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Architect Brian Murphy describes the Thousand Oaks home office he
designed for a lawyer as ''a 10-inch-thick concrete shoebox buried
into the hillside.'' But the ''shoebox'' is anything but ordinary.
The 42-by-15-foot bunker-style structure sits across a small pond
inhabited by bass, crayfish, frogs and turtles from a striking
split-level modern home designed by Frank Gehry in the late 1980s.</LD>
<TE>   The house, on a picturesque 2 1/2-acre property with deer and
rabbits, is an ideal living environment for the owner. But it wasn't
where he wanted to work. ''I needed more room and a separate working
environment,'' he says. ''It's not pleasant to live and work in the
same space.'' Murphy nestled the newer structure, which houses two
offices separated by a bathroom and a storage closet, into the
hillside surrounded by a grove of 100-year-old oaks. Light enters the
building through a chambered skylight that runs the length of the
building and through an additional skylight in the bathroom. Three
large picture windows frame views of the waterfall and pond that
arise from a tributary of a creek that traverses the property. At
each end of the building industrial steel sash windows open onto
small balconies that the owner says are ''ideal for reading briefs
and taking conference calls.''</TE>
<TE>   Inside, the design is crisp and spartan: concrete walls, a Douglas
fir floor, bare windows. An airy desk floats in the center of the
room. Computer and desk lamp cords disappear through one of the
desk's legs into conduits in the floor. On a nearby wall, translucent
velum paper sconces that Murphy tacked up with push pins cast a soft
light over a bank of white metal files holding legal documents. Floor
lamps, which the architect fashioned from electrical conduits,
diamond plate and skateboard wheels, and a white Corian conference
table on lockable casters are easily movable. Outside, Murphy
replaced an existing wood bridge with a 30-foot-long galvanized-steel
span suspended above the waterfall, which ebbs and flows with the
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   The office commute over the water and through the woods takes 40
seconds. That is, unless the homeowner stops to inspect the black
heron's nest in the oak by the pond or look around for the resident
bobcat. ''My work is often stressful,'' he says. ''It's wonderful to
be in such a serene environment. Plus, it's convenient to go home and
have a sandwich whenever I want.''</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SOUND STUDIO</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tom Schnabel's home office on the second floor of his
Moroccan-inspired Venice home was cramping his style. ''I got tired
of hearing my phone ring all the time. My girlfriend did too,'' says
Schnabel, the producer and host of KCRW's Cafe LA. ''I needed some
separation from work. Besides I had seven boxes of CDs filling my
guest bedroom. I needed a place to put them.'' When an adjacent lot
became available, Schnabel bought it and called in Santa Monica
architectural designer Robert Ramirez to conceive a separate sound
studio/home office next to the house.</TE>
<TE>   The result is a 20-foot-square structure with an overhang roof.
The facade features fixed crossbeams above the five-foot-window bays
and French doors that open onto a pool and tropical garden. A massive
corner tower of eight-inch concrete block surrounds the new sound
room, where Schnabel tapes programs. ''I'm on the flight path of
Santa Monica Airport,'' he says. 'When they fly those old WWII planes
it gets really noisy around here.'' Now, with the insulated-glass
doors and sealed threshold, he doesn't hear anything but his ginger
cat, Mr. T, purring.</TE>
<TE>   Radiant-heated concrete floors provide a warm resting place for
Mr. T, who ''loves lying on them when it gets cold.'' A large custom
desk and Eames chair and ottoman sit in the light-filled room outside
the modest 4 1/2-by-7 1/2 -foot sound studio. Behind the desk, a
wall-to-wall credenza and two wall-hung bookcases hold the producer's
music books and oversized box sets. On each side wall,
eight-foot-high storage bays contain 3,000 of Schnabel's 15,000-plus
CD collection; Schnabel is relieved ''they' re finally all out of the
boxes.''</TE>
<TE>   Schnabel, who is also program director of world music for the
Hollywood Bowl, says it took a bit of adjustment to work alone at
home. ''I felt like I was in solitary confinement for a while. And
being raised with a severe case of Protestant work ethic, it felt
weird not to be in a car going to an office every morning.'' Now he
wouldn't have it any other way. The former L.A. County lifeguard, who
still swims 50 laps a day, admits he likes ''coming to work in
bathing suit, T-shirt and a pair of flip-flops.'' The view doesn't
hurt either. ''Right now the yellow cassia tree and red canna
blossoms are floating in the pool. I feel like I'm in a resort in
Bali.''</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ECO-FRIENDLY</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "I hate commuting with a passion,'' visual artist Blue McRight
says. ''Having a studio next to my house is ideal.'' A walk through a
courtyard of fat pumpkins, blue forest pansies and a personal shrine
made of found objects constitutes the artist's 58-foot commute to the
home office space she shares with her husband, architect Warren
Wagner of W3 Architects in Venice. ''It's really delightful to walk
to work,'' she says.</TE>
<TE>   McRight's atelier is in a modern two-story building on the front
of a large lot. The couple's small 1960s ranch-style home sits in
back in a reverse paradigm of home and studio. ''I wanted clients to
come to my office without passing through my home,'' Wagner says.
''Three years ago when we were looking for a property, I told the
real-estate agent 'think big lot, little house.' '' The office
building, which faces busy Palms Boulevard, acts as a sound barrier
to traffic noise and creates a courtyard between the two structures
where the couple often sit and enjoy their garden.</TE>
<TE>   McRight and Wagner occupy separate floors of the 2,200-square-foot
space, each with their own entrances. Wagner's first-floor
architecture office is outfitted with large frosted and clear-glass
doors, which pivot open onto a drought-resistant garden of Caribbean
copper and paloverde trees. Upstairs, fresh air is drawn in through
the doors and vented through skylights and clerestory windows in an
effective, low-cost ventilation system. A conference/lunch table
floats in the center of the space, which also includes a kitchen and
bath. The architect's drafting table sits behind a simple
glass-topped sawhorse desk .</TE>
<TE>   McRight's northeast clerestory windows and five overhead skylights
create ideal light for making artwork. ''I rarely put on any lights
until after dusk,'' McRight says. Her computer, set atop a built-in
laminate and strawboard desk with file drawers Wagner designed, sits
under a large corner window. ''I sometimes get distracted bird
watching,'' McRight says. ''I can see mockingbirds, sparrows, juncos
and lots of migrating songbirds up here.'' Two large wood tables on
wheels hold projects and move around as needed.</TE>
<TE>   Wagner, an advocate of sustainable architecture, says he likes to
''make the most efficient use of resources with the least impact on
the environment. In designing the space, I wanted to create a space
that is an example of what I believe in.'' The south-facing studio
building maximizes exposure to sunlight and provides both light and
heat throughout the day. Water for the radiant-heated concrete floors
and for the sinks and shower are heated naturally by the sun in two
glass-enclosed 40-gallon water tanks. Throughout the structure the
architect used recycled building materials such as homasote (made
from newspapers) for walls and strawboard (made with an organic
soy-based binder and straw) for cabinets.</TE>
<TE>   For the architect, working at home is all about flexibility. ''My
arrangement has not contributed to becoming a workaholic,'' he says.
''I've tried to set up a life that integrates my life and work, but
I've also separated my home and work space. This is the best
arrangement you can have.''</TE>

<TE>   ZEN GARAGE</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Having a home office has always been a requirement for Los Angeles
art dealer and real estate agent Michael Collins. But when he
purchased a 1,400-square-foot bungalow in West Hollywood two years
ago, he knew something had to give. The 1920s remodeled home had to
function as both his living quarters and an art gallery. ''The house
was simply too small to have all that plus a real working office and
art storage area,'' Collins says. When his Range Rover couldn't make
it down the narrow driveway, he decided to sacrifice the garage for
his home office.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica architect Patrick Tighe gave the old garage and its
sagging roof a major face-lift, transforming the ramshackle structure
into a comfortable Zen retreat. Tighe reinforced the structure, then
covered the exterior with horizontal redwood slats. He stained the
original concrete slab floor darker to camouflage oil spills. ''You
can still see some of the stains, it's all part of the building's
history,'' the architect says. A new skylight in the raised ceiling
bathes the white walled interior with natural light, which Collins
says is best for viewing art. ''I also like to keep it open so I can
hear the rustling of the giant timber bamboo,'' he says. The
six-foot-tall Bambusa oldhami that Collins and Tighe planted around
the perimeter of the backyard two years ago is now more than 25 feet
tall. Inside, a three-quarter-high wall lined with shallow grooved
shelves displaying smaller works of art partitions the 20-square-foot
room. Two-thirds of the space is dedicated to the art dealer's
working office, while the remainder houses shelves for reference
books, racks for art, counter space for fax and copy machines and top
and bottom storage cabinets, plus Collins' two touring bikes. A
5-foot-square steel and laminated birch partner's desk Tighe designed
serves as a large surface for viewing art. A Sony Wega TV in the
ceiling corner lowers and extends on a hospital arm device when the
art dealer wants to view videotapes of new artists' work. Track
lights color correct and highlight art at night, while four Bose
speakers pipe in Collins' favorite classical radio station, KMZT.</TE>
<TE>   The most striking feature of the home office garage is its new,
sleek steel and laminated glass sliding door. ''It's an industrial
take on an old barn door,'' Tighe says. ''It's actually very
low-tech.'' When working, Collins leaves the door open to enjoy views
of his garden. When closed, the milky-green glass doors mirror the
planted bamboo, ferns, papyrus, flax and red-flowering plum. The
sound of water slipping over the edge of the nearby reflecting pool
adds to the serene office environment. ''Patrick created a very
functional, tranquil retreat for me,'' Collins says. ''I certainly
don't feel like I'm in a garage.''</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   PENTHOUSE PAVILION</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA neurosurgeon Dan Kelly's penthouse pavilion in Marina del Rey
is the view-rich aerie he seeks when working at home. ''My office at
the hospital is very disruptive,'' Kelly says. ''In addition to
surgery I do a lot of research. This is really the only quiet place
where I can sit and do any serious writing.'' Kelly added the office
in 1997 when he and his wife, Marta, discovered they were going to
have twins. The couple asked Culver City architect Lorcan O'Herlihy
to add a separate private space to the two-story beach condominium
where he could work. The architect created a 14-foot-square detached
pavilion on the open rooftop terrace outside the second-floor master
bedroom. A 22-foot-long overhead trellis fashioned from Douglas fir
and metal links the main house to the office. Underneath, a spacious
terrace serves as a place for Kelly to read and the couple's twins,
Carmen and Isabel, to play. Inside the three-sided glass office,
Kelly's office equipment sits atop the architect's custom-designed
birch desk. A wall of built-in floor-to-ceiling bookcases and files
holds his extensive collection of medical books and journals. A
window cut into the center of the wall frames a view of downtown and
opens to let in cooling ocean breezes. The twins perch on a small
sofa opposite the desk to watch cartoons in the morning . ''It's
become a ritual. They come in, say 'hi' and watch a couple of
programs. I've learned to block out the noise,'' he says. Marta also
uses the office as a quiet hideaway to read and for an occasional
siesta. In one corner, a free-standing glass basin allows the doctor
to wash upstairs without waking his wife when he gets up before dawn
to write. ''I like being able to work at home,'' Kelly says.
''Medical technology advances-such as the new Global Care Quest
system-allows me to look at laboratory reports in real time. I
routinely work every Saturday and Sunday, but with the new technology
I can scan patients' MRIs or CAT scans without being in the hospital
all the time. I like being able to walk downstairs and see my
children or go out for a swim. The office simplifies my life.''</TE>

<DH>Ever Since Herman Miller's High Design Aeron Chair Arrived
on the Scene, Many Have Tried to Depose It, but Few Have Come Close</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Preston Lerner</AU>
<BD>Preston Lerner last wrote for the magazine on Caltech
physics professor Kip Thorne.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ever since the dawn of the office, chairs have come in two basic
flavors: work chairs and thrones. Or as they're known today, task
seating and executive chairs. And never the twain shall meet. At
least, not until the rules changed in 1994.</LD>
<LD>   Eight years ago, the office chair hierarchy was stood on its head
by the introduction of Herman Miller's seminal Aeron chair, which set
new standards for ergonomic efficiency while emerging as an
I'm-so-cool icon for high-powered, high-styling dot-com executives.
Not only was the Aeron chair named to the Museum of Modern Art's
design collection before it went on sale, but even more implausibly,
it also entered the larger public consciousness. And by merging the
utility of task seating with the status of a throne, it forever
changed the landscape of the modern office.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a controversial design," says Don Chadwick, who
co-designed the chair with Bill Stumpf. "We had developed a
comprehensive rationale for selling it. But people didn't care. They
just said, 'Give me the chair!' " Chadwick ruefully shakes his head
as he lounges in a sleek black Aeron chair in his studio in Santa
Monica. "You could understand it appealing to the A&amp;D
community--architects and designers. But the public glommed onto it
as well. It grew into something with a life of its own."</LD>
<TE>   The elevation of a mere office chair to an object of desire
highlights the radical change the workplace has undergone during the
past generation. Corporate environments have become more egalitarian
and informal. Home offices are no longer curiosities. There's a
computer on every desktop. Thanks largely to the ubiquitous PC, the
oversized executive throne with its tufted leather upholstery and
self-important tilt-swivel now seems as passe as the mahogany
credenza and the three-martini lunch. Instead, the contemporary seat
of power is a new breed of chair that stands at a unique crossroads
of style and performance, comfort and cachet.</TE>
<TE>   The modern office, as we know it, moved into the 20th century in
1914, when the Metal Office Furniture Co. patented the steel
wastebasket. In 1915, building upon the success of this newfangled
product, the company sold its first metal desks. During the next
half-century, the Metal Office Furniture Co.--now called
Steelcase--would become the top dog of the contract furniture
industry, and offices would be dominated by gleaming metal-topped
desks that whispered Corporate America just as insistently as the
clatter of manual typewriters and the rustle of gray-flannel suits.
Radical change arrived in 1968, with the debut of Robert Propst's
Action Office--a Herman Miller furniture "system" that spawned the
development of the open-plan, modular office that's still with us
today. Nevertheless, office seating continued to languish in the Dark
Ages. With few exceptions, chairs were marketed on the basis of
status, with secretaries getting the smallest ones and bosses the
biggest, beefiest, most ostentatious executive units. ("My, that's a
big one!") Comfort wasn't a primary design objective. In fact, the
very notion of a comfortable office chair seemed to be incompatible
with efficiency nostrums and the Puritan work ethic.</TE>
<TE>   Ergonomic seating didn't reach the workplace until 1976, when
Herman Miller introduced the appropriately named Ergon chair,
designed by Stumpf.As the Information Age created a new class of
knowledge workers, ergonomic office chairs--once the property solely
of the clerical masses--percolated up into middle management. But the
Aeron was the first chair to successfully integrate ergonomic
performance with aesthetic drama--a design triumph that has made it
as highly prized in executive suites and corporate boardrooms as it
is in word-processing pools and home offices. It's no coincidence
that the marketplace is now awash in Aeron knockoffs, Aeron wannabes
and would-be Aeron-slayers that blur the line between working-class
seating and chairs fit for a king.</TE>
<TE>   Already, a few motifs have become so commonplace that they risk
becoming design cliches: Mesh fabrics. Sculpted surfaces. Exposed
skeletons. But if there's one feature shared by the new chairs, it's
the determination to out-Aeron the Aeron, so to speak. It won't be
easy. The Aeron chair was a textbook example of the right product in
the right place at the right time. "Silicon Graphics bought a bunch
right after it came out, and Silicon Valley spread the gospel,"
Chadwick recalls.</TE>
<TE>   The Aeron spoke with special resonance to the style czars of the
New Economy. It bristled with original thinking, from a novel tilt
mechanism to its mesh-like Pellicle fabric. But best of all, the
Aeron oozed attitude: It was smart and hip and about as far as you
could get from the bigger-is-better, leather-is-best executive chair
of yore. So the Aeron emerged as an unlikely symbol of the New
Economy. And when the dot-com boom went bust, the image that best
summed up how the mighty had fallen was the fire sale of Aeron chairs
on the sidewalks outside bankrupt tech companies.</TE>
<TE>   The blockbuster success of the Aeron chair was so unexpected--even
to MillerSTET--that it took the contract furniture industry years to
respond. It wasn't until 1999 that the Steelcase empire finally
struck back with the Leap chair. The product of nearly four years and
tens of millions of dollars in development, the Leap looks
conservative next to the Aeron. "It's contemporary without being
outrageous, so it won't ever look dated," says Jan Carlson, general
manager for seating, slyly dissing the Aeron chair for its iconic
quality. The Leap chair's big talking point is ergonomics, most
notably a seat-back that conforms to the occupant's "spineprint" and
a unique tilt unit that glides forward when it reclines. "We wanted
to redefine high-performance office seating," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Renewed interest in the high-end segment of the high-performance
market gave ergonomics pioneer Niels Diffrient another bite at the
apple. Diffrient designed his Freedom chair to capitalize on a signal
truth he'd learned during the two decades since creating the
groundbreaking Diffrient Operational in 1980. "Controls on chairs
stymie people," he says, "so I eliminated them. I wanted the chair to
react automatically to any body, any size, any weight."</TE>
<TE>   Besides inaugurating what's now called passive ergonomics,
Diffrient also fashioned a fresh, though somewhat forbidding, design
vocabulary that celebrates the function of the Freedom chair by
exposing its structure--its skeleton--as a design element. Call it
task seating as dentist's chair. Celebrated designer/architect Mario
Bellini put a sleekly Italian spin on this motif for Vitra with his
Ypsilon chair, which draws its name from the attenuated Y-shaped
spine of the sail-like seat-back. The chair looks like something out
of a set designer's vision for the next "Matrix" clone. Katherine
Bennett, who teaches product design at Art Center College of Design
in Pasadena, succinctly describes the idiom as "prehistoric
futurism."</TE>
<TE>   There's no question that the industrial overtones of the Aeron and
its successors help explain their appeal to techies. Still, designer
Mark Kapka was bored by the look. In shaping his aptly named Simple
chair for Keilhauer, Kapka explored an alternative aesthetic for
stripped-down seating designed for conference rooms. "Since we didn't
have all the ergonomic requirements [of task seating], we could quiet
down the design language and make the chair more human," he says. The
Simple chair's signature feature is a seat-back with mesh stretched
across the frame to create a striking goblet-shaped silhouette.</TE>
<TE>   In developing its own Aeron-fighter, dubbed the Life chair, Knoll
also rejected the austere tech look in favor of something friendlier
and more organic. The intuitive controls are slick. But what sets the
Life apart is a seat-back exuding the willowy grace of Japanese
calligraphy. Better still, it can be covered with 16 translucent
fabrics that give the chair an ethereal quality.</TE>
<TE>   While Life won the best task chair award at the NeoCon trade show
in June, the other newcomer generating some serious buzz was
Allsteel's #19, whose name derives from the fact that the chair has
18 major components--plus the human being who's using it. Visually,
it's characterized by aluminum tubing that produces a potent Machine
Age look. Mechanically, the chair synthesizes features found in
several rivals (passive ergonomics, an exoskeleton) with ones unique
to #19 (a temperature-sensitive foam seat, a tilt mechanism that
causes the seat to rise slightly when the chair reclines). "We
started the design process by recognizing that a lot of companies
were coming out with Aeron-like chairs," says designer Marcus Koepke,
"and we wanted to leapfrog the competition."</TE>
<TE>   Yet despite all the competition, the Aeron is still first among
equals. Not because it's necessarily the best or best-selling, but
because it was the first to articulate the conviction that comfort
and cachet needn't be mutually exclusive. The revolution wrought by
the Aeron chair hasn't eradicated the traditional throne--a chair
that performs no function other than conferring status upon its
occupant--any more than the rise of feminism has eradicated the
trophy wife. But it's largely because of the Aeron's example that
more and more people are starting with high-performance chairs and
dressing them up to fit their elevated stations in life. Thus, the
Leap chair can be covered in Coach edition leather, and the Freedom
chair is sold in both high-back executive form and as mid-back task
seating. Because let's face it: Status is all well and good --but not
when your back is killing you.</TE>

<DH>Architects Russell Shubin and Robin Donaldson Create
Personal Spaces in Unlikely Places</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Morris Newman</AU>
<BD>Freelance writer Morris Newman is a frequent
contributor to The Times' Living section.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an era when the dividing line between work and home life is
increasingly blurred, architects Robin Donaldson and Russell Shubin
design offices that feel a lot like home, even if they look like
something out a sci-fi movie. Hard-edged and avant-garde, oozing with
attitude and moody lighting, the interiors created by Shubin and
Donaldson--two men in their 40s who shuttle between offices in Culver
City and Santa Barbara--are a world away from the paneled-wood
boardrooms of yesteryear.</LD>
<LD>   "There has been a convergence between how people live and how
people work," Donaldson says. "It's not always clear where the
boundary lies between the two." Corporate clients, he says, "want the
amenities of home: a kitchen, a rec area, a place to kick back and
watch TV, even rooms for sleeping and showering." At first glance,
you wouldn't call the offices of Mindfield homey. The interiors of
the Marina del Rey-based production and post-production company are
dark, edgy, artsy and brooding. The dim atmosphere reflects the
preference for low lighting among people who work in video editing
and hate the glare of sunlight on their monitors. Natural light
filters in through a wall of patterned plexiglass. The diffused light
provides a soothing atmosphere that Shubin playfully calls
"Zen/Gothic."</LD>
<TE>   A closer look reveals the influence of home design in the clear
demarcation between public and private areas. In the center of
Mindfield is a large sitting area, much like a living room. Scattered
throughout the work area are six individual editing bays designed to
look like huts, which could be likened to bedrooms. The architects
used an undomestic material--unfinished sheet metal--for the editing
huts, and the imagery is almost menacing, with sloping walls that
recall the distorted architecture of German Expressionist movies such
as "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari." Inside, however, the huts are quiet
and soothing, even cozy. One video editor feels comfortable enough to
burn candles in his hut.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Smith, chairman of the Marina del Rey-based ad agency Ground
Zero, a partner with the adjacent Mindfield, says, "A sense of
privacy is very important, because it gives the staff a certain
feeling of relaxation and informality." That feeling of privacy is
far preferable to that offered in a typical office layout, he adds,
which often is little more than a reception desk in front and an open
work area in back. "It's like you are in the DMV," he says.Similarly,
at the offices of advertising heavyweights Ogilvy &amp; Mather in Culver
City, the open work area is punctuated with quiet, enclosed spaces,
such as a small research library and an editing room. But here design
works around brightly lit spaces, such as the structure's front
facade of floor-to-ceiling glass that faced the sun. To shield the
interior from direct sunlight, Shubin and Donaldson created a
dramatic entrance sequence--a metal tube--located along the window
wall.</TE>
<TE>   The tube makes the act of walking into the Ogilvy &amp; Mather offices
a surprising, almost otherworldly, experience. After passing through
steel doors, the visitor enters a metal round tube, "like the
fuselage of a small commercial jet," Shubin says. Walking down the
tube, visitors pass by several television monitors displaying the
international ad agency's latest commercials, such as those for
Miller Lite, American Express and Mattel. Pinpricks of sunlight poke
through walls of perforated metal. At the end of the 44-foot tunnel
is another surprise: a 16-foot-high wall emblazoned with the face of
the late David Ogilvy, the legendary ad man who founded the firm in
1948. That wall is symbolic of the boundary between the
world-at-large and the exclusive corporate culture of the agency.</TE>
<TE>   Tailoring a difficult space to the particular needs of a client is
a challenge Shubin and Donaldson face regularly. When the team first
looked at a former banking branch office in Beverly Hills, where The
Firm, a talent agency, planned to move, it found a dark, depressing
space with windows on one wall only. Ductwork cluttered the
30-foot-high exposed ceiling. Three enormous columns, covered in
tasteless marble veneer, stood in the center of the room.</TE>
<TE>   Lighting was the first task. After peeling the marble off the
columns, the architects outfitted the now-naked concrete columns with
banks of "down lights" pointed toward the floor and "up lights" for
the ceiling to remove shadows. In addition, the architects built a
14-foot-high perimeter wall of translucent glass that wraps around
the interior walls of the talent agency. Fluorescent lighting behind
the glass beams inward into the office, washing the room in a soft,
even light. Individual desks have task lighting.</TE>
<TE>   The architects removed the ductwork and wiring from the exposed
ceiling and relocated the building's "guts" onto two newly built
mezzanine floors--conveniently hidden behind the new wall of
translucent glass.</TE>
<TE>   Like many defunct bank buildings, The Firm's office features a
large walk-in bank vault, impossible to remove and awkward to
remodel. The architects furnished it with home-like materials, such
as a shag rug, comfortable furniture, media center and plants. They
sound-proofed the metal vault with Homesote, a carpet underlay that
looks surprisingly like brushed suede. Now the vault has a hip,
loungey look, and the soundproof environment has become a hot spot
for watching client videos or listening to music.</TE>
<TE>   In the workplaces of Shubin and Donaldson, even a bank vault feels
like home.</TE>

<LD>The phrase "virtual assistant" may suggest a digitized sci-fi entity
living in your computer that never needs a coffee break. But meet
Jenny Riley of Orange County, a very real "VA" who uses email, video
conferencing and other online tools to handle administrative
responsibilities for Kern County-based boss Eric Mack. Rather than
replace his client services manager of five years when she moved to
Minnesota in 1997 and then to Orange County a year ago, Mack set her
up with a home office. "It would've been really hard to replace the
rapport we'd developed," he says. "Buying the equipment just made
more sense."</LD>
<LD>   Mack installed an arsenal of techie gadgets at his productivity
enhancement company to keep the virtual workplace buzzing. A "digital
whiteboard" on his wall instantly beams scribbled notes to Riley's
computer screen. And paper filing is so last century. Mack prefers a
"digital sender," which scans documents for Riley to organize
electronically. But the core of their relationship is Lotus Notes, a
software information program that gives the duo, who meet about once
a year, access to each other's work.</LD>
<TE>   With kids to care for, both appreciate the flexibility of running
on their own schedule. Riley can fold laundry while on hold and Mack
can take the tykes to Disneyland on a weekday. "In the beginning we
talked about how we missed wasting 20 minutes at the front counter
chatting with the receptionist," Riley says. "But we've found that if
we leave our [video conference] cameras on, it's truly like being in
the office together."</TE>
<TE>   Virtual assistants are a flourishing cottage industry complete
with trade associations, training programs and professional
certificates from organizations such as AssistU (www.assistu.com) and
the nonprofit International Virtual Assistants Assn. IVAA membership
has grown an average of more than 200% in each of the last three
years, says vice president Angela Allen. "As businesses become more
secure with working remotely and technology advances, we only expect
that number to grow."</TE>
<TE>   Though she and Mack are now in the same state again, Riley
continues to telecommute. "I'd have to drive two hours in traffic to
get to Eric's place," she says. "Who needs that hassle?" The setup
has proven cost effective in savings on gas money and office rent,
and both parties say working from home has increased their
efficiency. Just call it a virtual windfall.</TE>

<LD>Among the luxuries of working at home is the option to personalize
your desk, right down to the computer hardware. Why limp along with
those company-mandated beige keyboards? Make a statement. Here are a
few 'boards and extras we like.</LD>
<LD>   Over the Rainbow</LD>
<LD>   These translucent boards from King Global in the City of Industry
come in six delicious candy colors perfect for creative types or
anyone who needs a little extra motivating. It's as if there were a
little cheerleader in each one. $22.95 at www.transnet-inc.com.</LD>
<TE>   Crystal Clear</TE>
<TE>   Forget black--clear is the ultimate neutral. But for the keys,
which are available in black or white and constructed with ABS
plastic (the stuff they use to make bulletproof vests), Apple's Pro
Keyboard is thoroughly translucent. A triumph of simplicity. $59 at
www.apple.com.</TE>
<TE>   Industrial Strength</TE>
<TE>   The Hummer of the keyboard universe, Stealth's stainless steel
5000 DT is chemical- and water-resistant. It's also a beauty. See it
in Paramount's upcoming release "The Core,'' in which Hilary Swank
and company use it in a quest to reach the center of the earth. $595
at www.stealthcomputer.com.</TE>
<TE>   Slippery When Wet</TE>
<TE>   Parents and the accident prone will appreciate this spill-proof
design from Man &amp; Machine. Made of silicone rubber, the CoolOne can
take just about anything, from apple juice to hot coffee. And it's
ultra quiet, a boon for those late-night Googling marathons. $179 at
www.manmachine.com.</TE>
<TE>   Black Beauty</TE>
<TE>   Logitech's new Cordless Elite Duo keyboard with matching black and
silver mouse is sports car sexy. With no cumbersome cords to deal
with, it handles beautifully as well. You're entering a mouse
pad-free zone here: This baby works on books, stacks of paper, just
about any flat surface. So clutter away. $99.95 at www.logitech.com.</TE>
<TE>   Glitterati</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles artist Erin Lareau's "Iced Mice" are sure to glam up
any desk. Available in shades including "Power Red" and "Chameleon
Green," each mouse is signed and numbered and features 1,200 hand-set
Austrian crystals. Beats plastic. $200 at www.erinlareau.com, World
Avenue Fred Segal Melrose, (323) 651-1800, or Geary's in Beverly
Hills, (310) 273-4741.</TE>

drawings for the DCW chair. Perfect for designers and mid-century
diehards. $17 at www.eamesoffice.com or the Eames Office Gallery &amp;

<LD>In the mid-'90s, Metro Furniture was out in front on a new design
category known as "performance lounge seating," a.k.a. "dynamic
lounge seating." Interactive comfort was the latest thing in
workplace ambience, and Metro's plush, substantial chairs took their
cue from home furnishings to lend boardrooms the warm mood of upscale
living rooms. Corporate collars may be getting starchy again these
days, but the Detour Lounge, Metro's current take on productive ease,
is coming full circle as telecommuting types make casual intimacy a
touchstone of the home office.</LD>
<LD>   "It's the kind of thing you make your statement with," says Metro
director of design Jess Sorel. "A really beautiful lounge chair with
wonderful fabric is a nice little luxury, whereas the other
components will be pretty pragmatic. Maybe you'd splurge on a task
chair. But those tend to be very utilitarian, unless you get into one
of those hokey high-back executive chairs. Some can go so far as
looking like an English wingback chair on a spinning base. It's
pretty funny."</LD>
<TE>   The Detour Lounge comes in three sizes with a laptop friendly
tablet option. The smallest model (still plenty plush) goes for
around a thousand bucks, while customers who insist on Clarence House
silk velvet leopard print can expect to pay much more. But what price
productivity? A Detour Lounge might be just the ticket for the
unmotivated worker who simply can't bear to move from the couch to
the desk. Here's to halfway.</TE>

<DH>Talking Points From Workplace Design Maven Grant Seltzer</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GINNY CHIEN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When they need the goods to create a stylish center of productivity,
architects, interior designers and entrepreneurs go to the team at
the airy Beverly Boulevard business furniture showroom of Jules
Seltzer Associates. Starting in 1947, founder Jules Seltzer
championed creativity-enhancing designs by innovators such as Charles
and Ray Eames and George Nelson. Today the world's oldest Herman
Miller dealer still showcases modernist classics along with
contemporary lines, and the current owner, Jules' son Grant, has made
the home office a focal point.--GINNY CHIEN</LD>
<LD>   Tell us about some hot trends for home offices.</LD>
<LD>   They're generally more casual with cleaner lines. It's what we
call a "soft office," where a homey atmosphere blends into the
corporate office environment. Lighter colors and whites are very
popular today. So are smaller units, thinner styles and more curves.
People also want finer materials, such as nicer fabrics and woods.
And everything is becoming more comfortable. Many tables, for
example, have eased edges so you don't have to put your arms against
anything sharp.</LD>
<TE>   What are the elements of a fabulous home office?</TE>
<TE>   First it has to be aesthetically pleasing. Then it has to fit the
space properly. Don't try to cram things in that won't fit. But most
importantly, it has to help you work and be productive. Most home
offices are despicable because piles of papers and books are
everywhere. You don't see the office after a while. If it can help
you organize by having places for trays, various compartments and
things of that nature, then I think the office is great.</TE>
<TE>   Any suggestions for organization?</TE>
<TE>   Before people come to us, or anyone else for that matter, they
need to ask themselves, "How do I live?" Where do you put your
briefcase? Do you have a lot of reference books? Are you always
losing your keys? If so, maybe you need a little stand with a drawer
right when you walk in. Once you begin thinking this way, you can
begin planning the perfect office and picking out the appropriate
pieces. It's great if an office looks fantastic, but it's supposed to
be a place where you can actually get work done, too.</TE>
<TE>   Why not just go to Office Depot?</TE>
<TE>   If you're design conscious at all, you'll want something that's
pleasing to look at. People are in their offices a lot. It's like an
automobile. Look at a Volkswagen today. The Bug features a little bud
vase. Why do they do that? To make it nice for you to spend time in.
Plus, people today are savvy to designers. Even Target carries lines
by Michael Graves and Philippe Starck. And people know these names. A
few years ago, they might've said, "Who's that?" Or "Who's Charles
Eames?"</TE>
<TE>   But don't the big office machines and wires mess everything up
anyway?</TE>
<TE>   That is a problem, but if you keep in mind what machines you use
every day--graphic designers, for example, often need multiple
computer monitors--you can plan places to put them. You can also get
wire management troughs, which you put underneath work surfaces, so
the wiring is out of sight. And there are these tubes now [in which]
you can put all the wires. That way, you have a nice attractive tube
instead of cords running all over. You have to search a little, but
these things are available at hardware stores and home organization
places.</TE>
<TE>   How do you work with small spaces?</TE>
<TE>   There's a great line called "Ethospace" designed by Bill Stumpf
and Jack Kelley that was originally meant for corporate offices, but
we're finding that it works really well in homes. It's systems
furniture, so you can take different parts and pieces and put it
together for any size room. By taking Ethospace and installing work
rails on the walls where you can stick reminder notes and hang up
trays for things like paper clips, you can make the most out of every
available inch. Even if you only have a 10-by-10 space to play with,
you can still get a total workspace, complete with lots of overhead
storage.</TE>
<TE>   How much would a great home office take out of your bottom line?</TE>
<TE>   You can get a very nice home office for about $3,000. But we have
people that spend up to $20,000 for larger spaces.</TE>
<TE>   What pieces should people splurge on?</TE>
<TE>   The chair is vitally important. It's going to determine whether
you keep working, or stay for 20 minutes and then go watch TV or get
a snack because you're uncomfortable. I'd say a good chair starts at
$350 and goes up to $1,500.</TE>
<TE>   Anything else?</TE>
<TE>   The desk is the centerpiece of the room. When choosing one, you
should go over and run your hand over it. Imagine yourself working
there. People may like the look of a glass or steel top, but they may
not like writing on it. You need to think about stuff like this
before paying for anything.</TE>
<TE>   So it's all about form following function.</TE>
<TE>   Absolutely. It's a rule of good design. And you should always look
for things that are well designed because those are the pieces that
will continue to work for you. Any manufacturer can slap a chair
together for $100, but sit on it for a period of time and you'll want
to get up.</TE>

<HD>Rise of the home office</HD>
<DH>A decade after Americans first began working from home in
significant numbers, the home office has come into its own. As David
Lansing reports below, it has become a dedicated space as carefully
laid out and decorated as any other part of the house. In the pages
that follow, we'll visit the home offices of Southern Californians
who have tailored the environment to their individual lifestyles.
Also, we'll look at the latest trends in corporate offices and trace
the history of the workplace's reigning chair, the Aeron.</DH>

<LD>Some find it hard to believe, but the den and home office are
siblings from the same family. It's just that one is a bit of a
slacker and the other a definite Type-A. Think about it. The den is
where mom hid dad's walnut-veneer bar, shoving it next to that
hideous big screen TV, the one with the picture that looked like it
was being transmitted through the murky bottom of a fish tank, that
he got just before the kickoff of Super Bowl XX in 1986. In fact, the
den and TV go together like football and beer commercials. Where
would one be without the other? At first we expected the brainiac PC
to share accommodations with the slack-witted boob-tube, but it
didn't take Dr. Laura to tell us that the relationship wasn't going
to work. It soon became obvious that once everyone became more
interested in anonymously chatting with strangers who didn't know
what we really looked like instead of watching reruns of "Happy
Days," the computer was destined to trump the TV as the new king of
the household.</LD>
<TE>   And the king needed his own space. We converted bedrooms,
dedicated basements, carved out kitchen nooks, floated airy lofts and
rehabbed shaggy dens so that he--and we--might be more comfortable.
It's not that we've abandoned the TV. It's just that we've decided he
can go anywhere--hidden in an antique armoire, paraded as flat-screen
art, unceremoniously dumped in the bedroom--while we've gussied up
his old digs, the slightly threadbare den, and turned it into the
sleek techno-haven--the home office--for our new favorite, the
computer and all his techie brethren.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody has to have a home office these days," says Santa
Monica architect Brian Murphy. A home office, acknowledges Murphy, is
almost as important to his clients as luxury bathrooms and a
tricked-out kitchen. "We just did a 3,000-foot addition on the back
of a house in Santa Monica that included a dark room and a place to
wash the dogs. But the upper level was devoted to two studio offices.
His and hers. With gorgeous views of the Pacific." The home office,
for a lot of people, has become as important as the master bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   Consider this: trend guru Faith Popcorn, who has blithely
predicted that by 2005 over 20 million people will be working at
home--double the current figure--has her own line of home office
furniture for women. The line may be saddled with an unfortunate
moniker--Hooker Furniture--but no one really doubts Popcorn's
assumptions that home offices, filled with stylish, comfy furniture,
are now a standard feature in most new home construction. "The growth
in home offices has been phenomenal," says Kim D. Shaver, director of
marketing communications for Virginia-based Hooker, a leading
manufacturer of upscale home office furniture. Shaver says the
Virginia-based company saw a 40 to 50% growth rate in annual sales
during the '90s, increasing from about $10 million 10 years ago to
over $60 million last year.</TE>
<TE>   What's driving the boom in home offices, experts say, is
technology, in particular, the computer which, according to the
Consumer Electronics Association, is currently in 56% of U.S.
households. If you've got the type of a job that can be accomplished
using a computer connected to the internet (and, according to
research cited by Shaver, of the 22 million people who claim to be
self-employed, about 8 million rely primarily on the internet for
their business), why bother to go into a regular office? Paul and
Sarah Edwards, who have touted the joys of self-employment in 14
books including "Working From Home," moved, on a whim, from Santa
Monica to a remote hamlet in the Los Padres National Forest in 1999.
"We had never heard of Pine Mountain Club but we spent a Fourth of
July weekend there with friends, loved it, and two days later, we
were looking for houses," says Paul in a phone conversation from his
home office which, he says, has views of mountains and lakes. "If you
can earn your living working at home in a place you want to live, why
wouldn't you?"</TE>
<TE>   Wendy Marlett, senior vice-president of marketing for KB Homes,
one of the largest housing developers in Southern California, says a
recent poll by the company showed that more than 60% of home buyers
surveyed thought having a home office was either "essential or very
important" in their decision-making process. The Meyers Group, a real
estate information company in Irvine, believes that more and more
homeowners will convert a room in the house to a home office. "I'd be
surprised if at least half the homes don't already have a space set
aside as some sort of a home office already, and our research shows
that trend only getting bigger," says Tim Sullivan, in charge of real
estate information for the firm.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the desire for a state-of-the-art home office even
drives the decision to build a new home in the first place. Such was
the case with Dean Patton, a highly sought-after designer who pulled
out of a bustling Los Angeles design firm seven years ago when the
commute from his home in south Orange County became too much. Patton
figured he'd just set up shop in an extra bedroom of the house--a
common solution to many first home offices. "Shortly after I started
my own business, I'm on the phone with a big client and my
two-year-old is in the bathroom, yelling. That's when I knew I needed
to separate the home from the home office."</TE>
<TE>   So the Pattons, who were thinking of moving anyway, began thinking
of building a new home. One that would not only would have separate
office space but its own dedicated entry as well. And since Patton
wanted the design studio to have a very contemporary feel, the living
spaces of their new San Clemente home, with colored concrete floors
and a 20-foot-by-20-foot great room, with exposed ceilings and
floor-to-ceiling windows, followed suit.</TE>
<TE>   Patton's 700-square-foot office has the feel of an ad agency, he
says, which he hopes makes clients feel more comfortable when
visiting. Not that that happens very often. "Fewer than one out of 10
of my clients ever show up here," he said. "But if they do, I feel
very comfortable and so do they."</TE>
<TE>   But while lots of home offices try to button themselves up to look
more corporate, a number of architects and designers are finding that
the influence works the other way as well. Stanley Felderman, whose
Santa Monica-based firm Felderman + Keating was responsible for the
playroom look of MTV's West Coast offices which, he says, were
designed to be "a home away from home," just finished another
corporate project in which they turned a former residence into an
office. "The idea was that the office became the home." They're
complete with guest quarters upstairs in case visitors wanted to
overnight.</TE>
<TE>   East of Doheny, an entertainment production company, also borrowed
design elements from the burgeoning home office trend for their
Melrose office in what was once a theater. Lured by the folk art,
comfy couches and toys, like remote-controlled cars buzzing around,
people often confuse the office site for a design showroom. "It looks
like a home--like a cottage," says David Hamlin, head of business
affairs. "This allows us to come here and feel like we haven't left
our homes, which is to say that it was intentionally designed to be
an atmosphere that makes people feel comfortable, even if it doesn't
exactly look like anyone's real home."</TE>
<TE>   Which brings up an interesting point: an office, whether in the
home or elsewhere, doesn't have to look like home to make us feel at
home. "We tend to think of homey as making reference to traditional
residences," says Felderman. "But there's also a sense that something
'homey,' whether a corporate office or home office, is simply a place
that makes you feel good. There's a visceral sense to it that makes
us more relaxed."</TE>
<TE>   That's certainly the case with Aron Orton's home office in a
Silver Lake townhouse. Orton, who spends eight hours a day as a
commercial editor for ad agency dGWB, spends almost as much time, in
the evenings, as chief executive and sole employee of Dahlia Page
Post, his freelance gig, doing graphics and editing for music videos
of L.A. groups such as Powder and other clients. His home office
takes up almost every square inch of a spare bedroom and, in addition
to a high-tech editing bay full of computers and monitors, includes
such oddities as antique cameras, x-rays of hands, taxidermied
animals and jars of formaldehyde with bats in them.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone would appreciate Orton's "homey" touches in his home
office but, he says, it allows him to tap into his creative energies.
"My office at the ad agency is rather sterile," says the 31-year-old
Orton. "But my home office visually inspires me. When I get tired
looking at a monitor, I can just look around the room and get
excited. This stuff makes me happy."</TE>
<TE>   Orton admits that, at first, he was nervous that clients might not
feel comfortable doing business in a home office decorated with lava
lamps and ceramic hula dolls, but, like Patton, he soon discovered
that there was seldom any need for clients to visit at all. "Everyone
is used to working with people they never meet, or they meet in a
neutral setting like a restaurant or coffee shop. Hardly anyone comes
to my home office."</TE>
<TE>   Still, as far as Dion McCarthy is concerned, the home office needs
to take its cues from the corporate office, which means clutter is
out. And while the space should feel comfortable, it shouldn't be too
homey. "In the last five years, the home office has gone from an
adjunct or satellite to a 'real' office to where it is the real
office," says McCarthy, principal of DesignARC, a West LA
architectural firm that has done a number of high-end home offices.
"When we take on a project, we no longer have the client making
references to a mother office. So there's a desire to make the home
office look as professional as possible, which means independent
entries, so you don't have to pass through the kitchen to get to the
office, and a sophisticated look that can inspire confidence in
clients that visit."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest challenge for McCarthy is figuring out ways to manage
filing systems and communication equipment--computers, printers, FAX
machines, and, in many instances, TVs, DVD players, and recording
equipment--in a 15-by-20 foot space. "This is all stuff that normally
would have been spread out over a three-story high-rise," says
McCarthy, "but not only do we have to get it into a much smaller
room, we have to pretty much make it invisible." Which means a lot of
custom design, including running empty conduits behind walls for
devices not yet developed, to eliminate clutter.</TE>
<TE>   But while Santa Monica architect Brian Murphy agrees that his
biggest design challenge for a home office is finding a place for all
the high-tech equipment, he wonders how long we'll continue to make a
big deal out of where we set up our computers. "It's just like the
TV," he says. "When there's no cache attached to having computers and
FAX machines, people will be less interested in designing rooms to
house them. Frankly, as everything gets smaller and more integrated,
there might be little reason to even have a home office. The home
office will become Starbucks or even the car. And then people will
stop saying, 'Oh, and here's our home office--and our computer.'"</TE>
<TE>   So, one wonders, should the home office fall out of favor in the
years ahead, what will we do with the space? "Well," Murphy says,
with a hint of mischief, "you could always turn it into a really nice
guest room." Or, perhaps, a den?</TE>

<TE>   John Rivera Sedlar outraged the public when he respectfully served
tamales on plates emblazoned with the image of the Our Lady of
Guadalupe at his defunct restaurant Abiquiu in Santa Monica. Yet
Buddha has become a popular restaurant decorating theme without
evoking protests. A golden Buddha has gazed on the bar at Chinois for
almost 20 years. Buddha Bar in Paris is built around a two-story gold
image that looms over the dining room. The luxe Ona Spa on Beverly
Boulevard includes a meditative Buddha Garden Cafe.</TE>
<TE>   Now Koi, a new restaurant on the border of West Hollywood,
features a Buddha fountain in one dining room and an antiqued stone
Buddha head mounted over the fireplace in the outdoor patio. Votive
candles flicker from stone shelves bolted to the wall of the bar.
Designed by Thomas Schoos, the interior is Zenned-out industrial loft
accented with staves of bamboo and stone fossils.</TE>
<TE>   L.A.'s appetite for sushi seems to never flag. Served in a chic,
happening setting, it always brings the crowds, at least for a while.
Out front valets sprint down the sidewalk, pedestrians be damned, to
wherever they stash the cars. If you feel like dropping in on a
Saturday night, don't. Koi is so popular, you won't get past the door
without a reservation.</TE>
<TE>   It's a stage set for a trendy sushi bar, one that could exist only
in Los Angeles. The place is so large, it seats 220. The space, which
once housed L'Ermitage, then Drai's and Cienega, has never looked
better. Remember the dreadful astroturf "patio"? It's now lined with
booths and features two ponds with the requisite Buddhas. The
spacious lounge has been redone in soothing, sober tones and features
age-crusted stone fossils set on the mantelpiece. In the foyer, men
in tight-fitting T-shirts greet each other with awkward hugs. Eyes
swivel toward each newcomer as L.A.'s fashion followers in
belly-baring outfits totter on their Jimmy Choos past the long,
five-chef sushi bar.</TE>
<TE>   Koi is so Zenned out sushi chefs don't even shout out a greeting
to newcomers. Oddly, the sushi counter here is not the most coveted
place to sit, maybe because people tend to come here with more than
one friend. On the other hand, if you're just a party of two, it may
be the quietest place to eat. The high-pitched laughs of groups of
ladies bounce off the walls. The noise level is as effective as a
rude maitre d' hurrying you through your meal. My guests can't wait
to get somewhere quieter to talk.</TE>
<TE>   For a hot spot, Koi has unusually attentive service, from servers
who take earning a good tip seriously. But sometimes even their best
efforts can't make up for the ordinary food, or the kitchen's
slowness. My first lunch, soon after Koi opened in May, was so
mediocre I waited a couple of months before going back a few more
times, to mixed results. As the restaurant caught on, the food did
get better.</TE>
<TE>   While I wouldn't consider Koi one of the more serious sushi
restaurants in town, the sushi, at least on my last visit, is
respectable. Hamachi, toro, uni, salmon are all sparkling fresh.
Sunomono, or cucumber salad, is piled high in handsome square
porcelain dishes. Sushi rolls are neat packets of rice and fish. Two
pieces of toro sushi can set you back $18. On previous visits,
though, much of the fish had a dull cast, and didn't seem as fresh or
as flavorful as it should be. I think they were hoping most people
wouldn't notice if the seafood was doctored with enough chile and
wasabi.</TE>
<TE>   Nobu Matsuhisa, chef/owner of Matsuhisa, Nobu, Malibu and Nobu in
Manhattan, has had enormous influence on Japanese restaurants here,
especially those favored by a non-Japanese clientele. His cheeky
introductions of jalapeno, garlic, sweet Maui onion, osetra caviar,
even butter and mayonnaise to the austere Japanese palette of
flavors, has caught on big-time. Every trendy sushi restaurant is
attempting to emulate his success.</TE>
<TE>   The signature dishes of Koi's chef, Hawaiian-raised Rodelio
Aglibot, include halibut carpaccio with basil ponzu and crunchy
little cakes of seared sushi rice topped with spicy tuna tartare and
a slice of jalapeno. The tuna has either been pounded or whizzed in
the food processor until it's almost a paste and is so spicy that
it's impossible to appreciate the quality of the fish. Hamachi
(yellowtail) sashimi is fine, but it's hard to fathom the impulse to
cover spicy, marinated albacore sashimi in fried, almost burnt,
onions, then douse the plate with ponzu. The onions lose their
crispiness and all you taste is onion and oil.</TE>
<TE>   Equally puzzling is the idea behind the Koi Crunch Roll, spicy
tuna wrapped around gooey cream cheese, the whole rolled up in nori
and then fried like tempura. This is one of the strangest dishes I've
ever tasted. Smoked salmon and cream cheese may be an idea made in
heaven, but combining raw tuna and cheese doesn't translate.</TE>
<TE>   Broiled Alaskan king crab legs in garlic butter sauce isn't a
great example of the giant crab, but some of the other cooked items
pass muster. A pan-roasted duck breast, pink and juicy at the center,
is delicious served with a dab of green chile and a light reduction.
Black cod "bronzed" with miso flakes apart just the way it should.
The miso's sweet earthiness is a lovely foil for the rich flesh of
the fish.</TE>
<TE>   For drinks, try Ybisu beer, which has enough character to stand up
to the food. There's also a long list of sakes by the glass or bottle
(Note: markups on sake tend to be high).</TE>
<TE>   Now that Koi is going full throttle, everything seems fresher. My
advice to anyone going to Koi is to limit the sushi to sushi rolls
and nigiri-zushi, skip the more creative preparations and move on to
a couple of cooked dishes. That is, if you need yet another trendy
sushi address.</TE>

<HD>Airlines Widening 'Use-It-or-Lose-It' Ticketing Policy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>American and Continental airlines have expanded to international
flights their new "use-it-or-lose-it" policy for nonrefundable
tickets.</LD>
<LD>   In the last month, the two airlines, along with Delta Air Lines,
Northwest Airlines, United Airlines and US Airways, stopped allowing
travelers to apply unused, nonrefundable fares to a new flight for up
to one year. American, Continental, Delta and United generally
limited the change to U.S. and Canadian flights; Northwest and US
Airways included virtually all flights. Policies vary, but most are
effective for travel starting Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   US Airways, for instance, said nonrefundable tickets would be
worthless after the original flight departed. American said it would
honor such tickets for the whole day of the flight. (Spokesman Todd
Burke said that would make the ticket valid to 11:59 p.m. on the date
of travel.)</LD>
<TE>   Most of the six, including American and Continental, also said
that they would charge holders of domestic nonrefundable fares $100
to fly standby on the original date of travel, starting Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new policies, unused, nonrefundable international fares
could not be applied to fares on future dates, American's Burke and
Continental spokesman Rahsaan Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   At American, standbys on such fares will be charged a $100 fee for
flights to the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and the Caribbean.
(Other international destinations are not affected because American
traditionally hasn't allowed standbys to them, Burke said.)</TE>
<TE>   At Continental, which allows standbys on international flights,
the fee will be $200 as of Jan. 1, Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Expedia Adds Online Rebooking of Tickets</TE>
<TE>   Expedia.com earlier this month began letting customers rebook
their airline tickets online rather than having to call its 800
number to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Customers access the option through the "My Trips" section of
www.expedia.com, which also calculates any airline-imposed change
fees and differences in air fare they may owe.</TE>
<TE>   Expedia does not charge for the service, which can be used only
with electronic tickets, a spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   Sheraton Opens Resort on Indian Reservation</TE>
<TE>   At first glance, the Sheraton Wild Horse Pass Resort &amp; Spa,
opening Tuesday in the high desert 11 miles southeast of the Phoenix
airport, seems be a typical resort hotel: 500 guest rooms, two
18-hole golf courses, four swimming pools, four restaurants and, of
course, a large spa.</TE>
<TE>   But the $170-million project, which sprawls over 1,200 acres, is
unusual because it is on an Indian reservation, includes an
equestrian center and celebrates the culture of its owners, the Pima
and Maricopa peoples, who together form the Gila River Indian
Community.</TE>
<TE>   The building's artwork is by Native Americans, and educational
programs focus on their culture. A boat ferries guests from the hotel
to the resort's golf courses and the Wild Horse Pass Casino along a 2
1/2-mile re-creation of the region's Gila River, lined with
indigenous plants.</TE>
<TE>   The resort's architects, Wimberly Allison Tong &amp; Goo of Newport
Beach, are responsible for such diverse projects as the House of
Blues club in Los Angeles and the Ritz-Carlton, Laguna Niguel.</TE>
<TE>   Introductory room rates, through Jan. 7, start at $179, subject to
availability. Regular published rates range from $99 to $550,
depending on the season. (602) 225-0100, www.sheraton.com/wild

<TE>   Getting on Board With Walt Disney's Hobby</TE>
<TE>   A 1/8-scale model train that once steamed around the backyard of
Walt Disney's Holmby Hills estate is featured in "The Happiest Train
on Earth," opening Friday at the California State Railroad Museum in
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit, running through March 31, focuses on the
entertainment magnate's fascination with rail, which helped inspire
the design of Disneyland. Celebrities such as actress Mary Pickford
and artist Salvador Dali rode or ran Disney's home train, which
included a caboose he handcrafted, along 2,615 feet of track and
tunnels.</TE>
<TE>   Also at the museum, through September 2003, is a preview exhibit
of more than 100 toy train cars and other objects selected from
thousands donated by the family of former San Diego bank executive
Thomas W. Sefton. Highlights include a rare 1930s Lionel
Transcontinental Limited train set and a Buddy L outdoor railroad--a
"push train" made in the 1920s and '30s that ran on backyard tracks.</TE>
<TE>   The museum is open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. Admission is $3 for
adults, free to ages 16 and under. (916) 445-6645, www.california

<TE>   Leisure Travel Rebounds, but Workers Stay Home</TE>
<TE>   Leisure travel has surpassed last year's level, but business
travelers are still hitting that road--or rather, the skies--less
often, the Travel Industry Assn. reported.</TE>
<TE>   In January through June this year, leisure travel was up 2% from
last year--and nearly 4.5% in June alone, the association reported.
But business travel was down 9% in the six-month period, and air
travel declined 10%.</TE>
<TE>   Feeling more hemmed in on the highways? That may be because auto
travel was up more than 3% January to June, the TIA said.</TE>
<TE>   Traveler's Notes ...</TE>
<TE>   United Airlines will add seasonal weekend service between LAX and
San Salvador between Dec. 13 and Feb. 9. It now operates weekday
flights to San Salvador.... Michelin, known for its maps of Europe,
has issued its first North American road atlas. It's organized
geographically, with adjacent areas mapped on adjacent pages, as in
Thomas Bros. Guides, instead of alphabetically by state. It costs
$16.95 and is available at bookstores, through online travel sellers
and by calling (888) 610-5122.... More than 70 quilts made by four
generations of African American women in the isolated community of
Gee's Bend, Ala., are on display through Nov. 10 at the Museum of
Fine Arts in Houston, (713) 639-7300, www.mfah.org. They will move to
New York's Whitney Museum of American Art from Nov. 21 to March 2....
Magellan's Catalog in Santa Barbara, which sells travel supplies and
clothing by mail order, has opened a retail outlet in Santa Monica at
1006 Wilshire Blvd., (310) 394-9417. Its only other store is in Santa
Barbara, 110 W. Sola St., (805) 568-5400.</TE>

<HD>Booking Student Tours Takes Some Homework</HD>
<DH>Organizing class trips is big business, and not all tour
operators are equal. But there are ways to weed out the dubious ones.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE ENGLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>School is back in session, and with it the purveyors of student tours
ready to send teenagers to New York to march with their band in the
Macy's parade, to Walt Disney World to celebrate graduation, to
England as foreign-exchange students and a world of other
destinations.</LD>
<LD>   "Travel, in the younger sort, is a part of education," Francis
Bacon wrote in 1625, and youthful enthusiasm for new places hasn't
dimmed in the centuries since.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. student travel market was recently growing by about 20% a
year, says Michael Palmer, executive director of the Student &amp; Youth
Travel Assn. of North America, or SYTA, a trade group for travel
suppliers. Then came the Sept. 11 attacks. For months afterward,
schools canceled or rerouted trips because of safety concerns and
closures of the White House and other tourist sites in Washington and
New York, two of the top three U.S. destinations for student
travelers. (The third is Orlando, Fla., SYTA says.)</LD>
<TE>   But student travel is bouncing back, Palmer says. It's big
business, worth more than $2 billion a year to the 57 members of his
group, which claims to represent about 10% of student tour operators
in North America.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of parents want to make sure their kids have these
enrichment experiences," says William Hoh, travel planner at
Adventures America in Pleasant Hill, Calif., which sends about 40,000
teenagers a year to U.S. theme parks, band performances, sports and
other events on behalf of schools, churches and other groups.</TE>
<TE>   For many parents, such group tours are a thrifty choice, Hoh says.
Instead of taking the whole family on a trip, they can send one child
at a time, and group travel is often less expensive.</TE>
<TE>   Recognizing that teens have a big voice in where families vacation
and being eager to influence their lifelong travel patterns, tourist
bureaus and other industry professionals are courting them, Palmer
says.</TE>
<TE>   And their customers are getting younger. Sixth-, seventh- and
eighth-graders are now "big travelers," Palmer adds.</TE>
<TE>   With so many choices, parents and teens may wonder how to tell
whether a tour operator is a class act, should be able to deliver
what it promises and adequately supervises its ever-younger charges.
The answer, experts say, boils down to this: Do your homework.</TE>
<TE>   A good place to start is with SYTA, (248) 814-7982, www.syta.com,
based in Lake Orion, Mich., outside Detroit. The group, formed in
1997, requires each member travel agent and tour operator to have
been in business at least three years, serve at least 3,000 students
per year, have a consumer protection plan with at least $450,000 in
coverage and carry at least $1 million in liability insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Each member company also agrees to a code of ethics that requires
it to be truthful in advertising. Members are listed on SYTA's Web
site.</TE>
<TE>   Another useful organization is the Council on Standards for
International Educational Travel, or CSIET, (703) 739-9050,
www.csiet.org, founded in 1984. Its members organize educational
travel for high school students, especially foreign-exchange
programs. (SYTA focuses on tour and travel groups, although it
includes some foreign-exchange student planners too.)</TE>
<TE>   Each summer, for the upcoming school year, CSIET issues an
advisory list of student-travel organizations that meet its
standards. CSIET's 10 pages of rules require those groups to have
enough money to meet their obligations and to interview host families
in their homes, among other provisions.</TE>
<TE>   For the 2002-2003 school year, 84 organizations applied for the
list and 74 were accepted, says Vanessa Chang, membership director.
Two that were on the list last year were rejected this year, she
adds.</TE>
<TE>   You can order the list, which includes profiles of the
organizations, by sending a check for $17.50 to CSIET, 212 S. Henry
St., Alexandria, VA 22314, or by calling CSIET and using a credit
card. (CSIET posts the list but no details, except Internet links to
some of the organizations, on its Web site.)</TE>
<TE>   Other professional tour associations that require members, student
and otherwise, to meet ethical and financial standards are the United
States Tour Operators Assn., (212) 599-6599, www.ustoa.com, and the
National Tour Assn., (800) 682-8886, www.ntaonline.com.</TE>
<TE>   Members of these two groups must have been in business at least
three years and carry at least $1 million in liability insurance,
among other requirements. Comparable organizations for travel agents
include the American Society of Travel Agents.</TE>
<TE>   You can also check the Better Business Bureau in the city where
the operator is based to see whether complaints have been filed
against it. (For a list of the bureaus, check www.bbb.org.) Or check
the state attorney general's office to see if it has filed any fraud
actions against the company. (For a list of such offices, log onto
www.nacaanet.org/memlink.htm.)</TE>
<TE>   Here are other tips for checking out student tour operators:</TE>
<TE>   * Ask the company to provide you with names and contact
information of students who have been on a previous trip so you can
ask them what they thought of it.</TE>
<TE>   * Ask how long the tour operator has been in business under the
same owner, how long it has taken students to the destination you're
interested in and whether it has liability insurance. Ask the same
questions of the charter plane company.</TE>
<TE>   * Find out who will accompany the students. Many trips use
teachers or volunteers as chaperons to handle discipline, but there
should be professional tour staff as well.</TE>
<TE>   Hoh says Adventures America generally sends one or more
coordinators along to oversee the trip and iron out travel problems,
such as making sure restaurants are ready to receive the group. "We
also usually hire security at night," he says, to monitor hotel
hallways and other areas.</TE>
<TE>   * Get a list of all hotels used on the trip, with phone and fax
numbers. Parents should also get a 24-hour contact number for the
tour operator in case of emergencies, SYTA suggests.</TE>
<TE>   * Read the itinerary carefully. Are meals included? Entrance fees
to attractions? Costs can mount quickly on a trip that seems
inexpensive at first glance.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a big difference between being taken to the Disneyland
Resort and having a ticket for Disneyland," Hoh says. "In the first
case, you're left standing at the gate or in the gift shop."</TE>

<KH>AUSTRALIA</KH>
<HD>Island of Animal Magnetism</HD>
<DH>Off the southern coast of the land Down Under, Kangaroo
Island is a haven for creatures great and small that delight the
human visitors who encounter them</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBBIE SEAMAN</AU>

<DL>KANGAROO ISLAND, Australia</DL>
<LD>Hearing one's sons outside yelling something about a great white
shark fin is a particularly effective alarm clock, especially when
one happens to be in a house perched atop a cliff overlooking the sea
off South Australia.</LD>
<LD>   By the time I ran to the patio in my nightgown, the mysterious fin
had multiplied, and we were looking not at sharks but at a dozen
dolphins cavorting just beyond the breakers, their smooth, wet skins
reflecting the rays of sunrise.</LD>
<LD>   This was my second stay on Kangaroo Island--70 miles southwest of
Adelaide, which in itself is almost at the bottom of the continent
known as Down Under--so I was no stranger to its spell. Yet watching
my 8-year-old fraternal twins, Cameron and Lachlan, react to its
animal magnetism was as much a gift to me as this trip was to them.</LD>
<TE>   Accompanied by my Australian husband, Warren Lancaster, and his
parents, Tom and Kath, we reveled in sights such as a seal
bodysurfing in the Southern Ocean off Kangaroo Island's south coast;
wallabies, smaller cousins of the kangaroos; and large-eyed possums
surprised by our car headlights, scurrying in the bush at night.</TE>
<TE>   Kangaroo Island, first found uninhabited in 1802 by British
explorer Matthew Flinders and now populated largely by farmers, is
more than a mere travel destination. I learned of KI, as the natives
refer to it, in 1979 when I interviewed a bearded young wilderness
photographer, Mike McKelvey, who had emigrated from California to
Kangaroo Island and whose photos brought Australia and KI to life for
me. I swore then that if I ever visited Australia, I would go to
Kangaroo Island.</TE>
<TE>   In March 1992, I made my first visit to Australia on vacation.
After falling in love in Sydney with the man who would later become
my husband, I ventured on, solo, for the visit to KI that I had
promised myself 13 years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The island was an unspoiled microcosm of Australia: pristine,
deserted white beaches, rolling pastures populated by sheep and
various species of gum, or eucalyptus, trees, and even its own tiny
"outback," a four-square-mile expanse of dunes called Little Sahara.
I was sufficiently charmed in my five days here by the kangaroos,
koalas and other critters in the wild to be temporarily distracted
from my lovesickness.</TE>
<TE>   McKelvey was still here, and, having become interested in wildlife
research, was working with his partner, Peggy Rismiller. She is an
American biologist and an expert on tiger snakes and echidnas, the
quirky-looking quilled anteaters that abound on the island. He also
insisted that I meet Belinda Hannaford, a creative spirit and gourmet
cook who rented out lovely cottages overlooking Snelling Beach on the
island's north coast. Her own home, Cliff House, had a breathtaking
view of beach and breakers, framed by native foliage and exotic
flowers.</TE>
<TE>   Children were only a gleam in my eye then. But after Warren and I
were married in Australia and had our twins about two years after
that visit to KI, I fantasized about showing the boys the wildlife
here someday. That dream materialized this year when I planned a trip
for their 8th birthday and invited Tom and Kath Lancaster, the boys'
grandparents who live outside Melbourne, to join us.</TE>
<TE>   July falls during the Australian winter, but the temperatures can
hover around 60 degrees, although it felt warmer. I tracked down
Belinda Hannaford and was delighted to discover that she would rent
us the glorious Cliff House overlooking Snelling. We flew from
Adelaide to Kingscote, where we rented a car.</TE>
<TE>   When we converged on Cliff House, the usually unflappable
Australians in our group were as effusive as the Americans. The
beach, bathed in alpenglow, was visible from almost every room, but
the most spectacular view was from a bedroom I dubbed the Ivory
Tower. Like the rest of Cliff House, it was whitewashed brick with
touches of Mediterranean blue, a round turret entirely occupied by a
bed. I immediately claimed it for Warren and me.</TE>
<TE>   Lachlan and Cameron, meanwhile, declined the remaining bedrooms
and instead ran down into the living room and staked out a space I
called the "Pit"--the nook that was actually the lower part of the
Ivory Tower but sunken a few feet below the living room floor, with
pillows and sheepskins scattered around a glass-covered fireplace.</TE>
<TE>   There is much to see on the island, so we spent too little time at
Cliff House, and I wished I had allowed time to stretch out for a few
hours in the Ivory Tower to read and gaze at the waves. Three days
here was insufficient, and our reconnaissance fell well short of
thorough, but the kids enjoyed the momentum.</TE>
<TE>   We started our explorations immediately. Lachlan and I maneuvered
our way down the cliff path to the beach and explored the dunes until
dark, and Cameron and his grandfather explored the fenced perimeter
on the cliff. So we could cook at Cliff House that night, Warren and
Kath made a grocery run to the little town of Parndana, a half-hour
away near the center of the island. They made it just before closing
time at 5.</TE>
<TE>   There are no fast-food restaurants here, no strip malls, no 24/7
anything, not even a traffic light. There are perhaps two dozen
restaurants, and they're concentrated mostly in the towns. At 96
miles long and 34 1/2 miles at its widest point, the island is larger
than many visitors anticipate. So it's easy to find oneself out in
the bush at lunch or even dinner with nothing to eat or no gasoline.</TE>
<TE>   We had planned for the next day, picking up a picnic lunch we had
ordered from Sue Pearson, who runs a catering outfit called 2 Birds &amp;
a Squid in the town of American River. Our next stop was Pelican
Lagoon Research Lab, also near American River, where McKelvey took
time from a field trip with biology students to show our kids and us
how he tracked echidnas.</TE>
<TE>   Like Hannaford, McKelvey had changed little in 10 years. (Ponce de
Leon, I mused, should have come here to seek the Fountain of Youth.)
He told us he was trying to track an elusive echidna named Johanna.
Echidnas, which are marsupials and the only mammals aside from
platypuses to lay eggs, could be important to humanity's future,
McKelvey explained. "Echidnas have survived 120 million years through
all the climatic changes," he told us. "So what are their strategies
in survival?"</TE>
<TE>   Around McKelvey, the Australian landscape came alive. My husband
spied a scarlet robin, and McKelvey told us it was sitting on a
narrow-leafed eucalyptus, the type used to make eucalyptus oil at a
nearby distillery. Pointing to a fallen tree, he described how, when
foliage becomes too dense, a certain species of gum tree will cause
itself to fall over and let in more light. Its root, however, stays
in the ground to ensure regrowth.</TE>
<TE>   As my sons looked on enthralled, McKelvey explained how
Rosenberg's goanna lizards lay their eggs in one of the hefty termite
mounds--we saw one 4 feet high--and their young hatch and feed on
termites, surviving in a sort of greenhouse atmosphere inside until
their lungs are strong enough to survive outside the mound. "We may
be faced with that problem before long, so we can learn from these
animals," he said.</TE>
<TE>   We piled back into our rented SUV and drove to a picnic site near
the placid, pale blue waters of D'Estrees Bay on the southeast coast.
There we dined on Sue's homemade goodies, ranging from rolls,
mini-quiches, roast beef, cheeses and chutney to fresh fruits and a
delectable apricot pie. Then we made it a point to see as much
wildlife as we could manage while making our way around the island.</TE>
<TE>   Although some distances can be daunting, the island is easy to
navigate. Given enough time and curiosity, you can head down
"unsealed roads," as Australians refer to those stretches of volcanic
red soil. Brief showers interspersed with sun created rainbows and
left glistening droplets on the trees. Occasionally, bright crimson
Rosella parrots would dart near the car's path before flitting away.</TE>
<TE>   Back on a paved road, I won the contest to sight the first wild
kangaroo. The youngster, however, was tame enough to hop his way over
to our vehicle, parting a gaggle of gray, yellow-billed Cape Barren
geese, to look for a handout. Feeding the wildlife is environmentally
incorrect as well as prohibited here, but our visitor seemed just as
happy to let us surround him and make a fuss over him, stroking his
soft fur and scratching behind his ears. These animals, especially
the smaller ones, are unlikely to injure humans, and our boys
delighted in the hands-on encounter.</TE>
<TE>   The next day Warren won for the first koala find, taking
McKelvey's advice to look in the area where Bark Hut Road meets
Pioneer Bend Road toward Stokes Bay on the north coast. He pulled the
car over so we could all jump out and scan the treetops until we saw
the two gray lumps about 60 feet above us.</TE>
<TE>   Their paws clutched tree limbs that looked too flimsy to hold
them, and as they looked lazily down at us, the gnarled forest echoed
with the cackle of a kookaburra.</TE>
<TE>   Seals and sea lions were far easier to see. Visiting Seal Bay on
the south coast, we joined a group of about 15 tourists and followed
one of the park rangers to the beach to watch the animals interact in
their natural environment. Even as we made our way to the beach on a
boardwalk, built since my last visit, we could see seals curled up
together in the dunes out of the wind.</TE>
<TE>   One cub had even climbed up on the walk and lay there, looking
soulfully at us, as my sons crouched nearby. "I've never had seals
this close to me before," Lachlan murmured reverently.</TE>
<TE>   It was hard to believe the warning that these animals are capable
of biting, but we still kept our distance from the roly-poly critters
as our group of about 15 tourists trekked down the beach. We were
gazing at a seal lineup just above the waterline when one of a pair
that had just scampered into the surf caught a wave, his head bobbing
in the foam as he shot to shore, then dove back in. "Where's Surfer
Dude?" cried Cameron, who covets that particular career himself. But
the seal had submerged himself.</TE>
<TE>   On our second full day of touring, the sight of seals was eclipsed
by the geological wonders on the coastline of Flinders Chase National
Park, a 78,500-acre area on the southwest corner of the island. I
also noticed new man-made features here such as boardwalks and
stairs, as well as an attractive new visitor center (with snack bar)
at the entrance to the park. Even more gratifying was the fact that
the natural sculptures named the Remarkable Rocks and Admiral's Arch
still knocked me out.</TE>
<TE>   It was an adrenaline rush to be exposed to the strong winds
unbroken by anything between us and Antarctica. Crashing on the
craggy shore, the sea swells were mammoth and magnificent, their
waters alternately gray or navy or teal, depending on where the sun
shone through the clouds.</TE>
<TE>   It was dizzying to be climbing around the towering Remarkable
Rocks, rendered in abstract shapes by millenniums of rain, wind,
waves and sun until they so barely touch their granite pedestal that
they look as though they were lowered onto the landscape by some
ancient alien spacecraft.</TE>
<TE>   For all their beauty, the Remarkable Rocks seemed like an
appetizer. Admiral's Arch, several minutes away by car, was the main
course. To get there, we zigzagged down a boardwalk-turned-stairway
that wended its way over what looked like layers of old lava and
other igneous rocks but sometimes turned out to be sleeping seals.</TE>
<TE>   Around the last corner, we instantly forgot the seals as we faced
the sort of natural land bridge. It looked more like an enormous
gaping maw, with stalactites for fangs and smooth slabs of gray rock
as the floor of its mouth. Through to the other side, framed by the
arch, we could see in the wild waves a portrait of the ocean's power.</TE>
<TE>   We soon gave in to the boys' impatience to go to a wildlife
sanctuary called Paul's Place, which they knew about from a
10-year-old photo of me with a kangaroo in my arms, a possum on my
shoulder and several brilliantly feathered rainbow lorikeets perched
on my head. This type of hands-on experience is what has made Paul's
Place--about a 15-minute drive north from the Playford Highway off
Stokes Bay Road--an imperative stop for kids and grown-ups.</TE>
<TE>   We arrived just as Paul Stanton, Pied Piper and master of
ceremonies--who hadn't aged in 10 years either--was taking a dozen
visitors to feed his animals. As we took turns with yellow buckets of
feed, there was a stampede of beasts and fowl from all directions,
which quickly became a whirlwind of feathers and fur as we were
besieged by turkeys, goats, kangaroos, emus, different breeds of
ducks and chickens, cows and calves, sheep and tiny lambs, geese,
deer, peacocks and ponies, all wanting a piece of the action. Our
kids screamed with delight when a goat butted one aside to get to a
feed bucket.</TE>
<TE>   Paul vanished wordlessly and reemerged with a 9-foot python, which
he placed around my neck as if it were a jeweled necklace. A
ring-tailed possum, wrapped in a towel and chewing on a piece of
bread, was presented to Cameron. Paul later gave the boys a koala and
a kangaroo to feed with a bottle, and he showed them joeys inside
their mothers' pouches and large emerald emu eggs. The kids' eyes
shone.</TE>
<TE>   So much wildlife, but I still regretted that we had not gone out
to hunt for fairy penguins, which return from the sea at night to
waddle back to their nests on shore. But as I woke up in the Ivory
Tower just after sunrise on the day of our departure, I spied Warren
below the window, beckoning. We dressed quickly and made our way
across the grassy slope above the cliff down to a tiny cove.
Following Warren's lead, we lay prone and peered into the crevasses
where cliffs met sands. There, spying tiny eyes, a beak, a hint of
feathers and the dainty curve of a petite penguin head, we fell
instantly in love. The emperor penguin, the largest of the species,
is about 4 feet tall and can weigh up to 100 pounds, but fairy
penguins are only a foot tall and weigh about 3 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Back home in Connecticut, we are already saddled with a menagerie
that includes a dog, a cat, a ferret, three parrots and a pair of
Japanese fighting fish. My husband and I rolled our eyes on the
flight home as Lachlan and Cameron recited their new wish list: a
kangaroo, a koala, a baby Australian fur seal and perhaps a pair of
fairy penguins.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The newlywed daughter of a friend phoned home to report a tiff with
her husband and asked whether she could come home immediately. A
ticket would have cost $800, so my friend called one of the
less-popular airlines, asked to speak with a supervisor and explained
the problem. "We'll call it a 'family crisis fare,' " said the
airline official, who then authorized a waiver of the usual
advance-purchase rule. The tearful daughter flew home for $400 round
trip.</LD>
<LD>   "Ask, and it shall be given you," the Bible says. Nowhere does
that admonition work more effectively than in travel. Many Americans
receive substantial travel discounts each year simply by requesting
them from an airline, cruise line or hotel. It's called bargaining.</LD>
<LD>   To most Americans, bargaining is unthinkable, something done only
in rug bazaars. Few other nationalities of travelers regard it this
way. Stand in the lobby of a large Venetian hotel during Italy's
off-season, and you will observe one European after another engaged
in bargaining. "We are looking for a room that costs no more than
$49," a proper Englishman says to the front-desk clerk. In fact, that
tourist knows that there is no such thing as a $49 room in that
hotel; he is bargaining. He is saying, in effect, "We will stay in
your hotel if you reduce your rate to $49; otherwise, we will walk
down the block to another hotel."</LD>
<TE>   In other words, you can bargain with dignity. Often the smartest
travelers call a hotel and ask if it has a "teacher's rate," a
"student rate," a "military rate," a "corporate rate," an "airline
employee's rate," whatever.</TE>
<TE>   It does not matter what category you choose. The hotel usually
doesn't care; you could ask for a "housewife's rate" and still get a
discount if the hotel were empty that night. What you are doing is
bargaining. You are telling the hotel, politely, that you know it is
a slow night and that here's a chance to fill an empty room by
cutting the price to you; otherwise you will walk down the block.</TE>
<TE>   Note that these tactics work only in off-season or during slow
cycles of the week. Business hotels tend to empty out on weekends,
when bargaining can be extremely effective; the same hotels tend to
be fully booked from Monday through Thursday nights, when bargaining
often doesn't work. And the tactic works only if you are speaking
with someone authorized to discount (someone working directly for the
hotel), not with an agent staffing a nationwide 800 number.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, where hotels tend to be scattered, not
clustered (as in our Venice example), bargaining is best conducted
from a phone booth or by a phone call from the airport on arrival, or
by a long-distance call from home before you leave on the trip. The
hotel then knows that you can easily make a call to another hotel if
it doesn't accede to your request. Bargaining usually doesn't work if
you are already in the hotel lobby; the desk clerk knows it's
unlikely you will walk out and travel the long distance to another
hotel if he or she refuses the discount.</TE>
<TE>   Does bargaining work for travel products other than hotel rooms?
You bet. Tales circulate in the travel industry of well-dressed
people who walk from ship to ship in the port of Miami on a Saturday
afternoon, asking pursers whether they have any unsold cabins they'd
like to fill at 50% off. They have their luggage, traveler's checks
and proof of citizenship--and are ready to board immediately without
knowing or caring where they are going. They simply want a week's
cruise at a good price. I've heard of the same thing happening at the
Manhattan pier from which the Queen Elizabeth 2 embarks for
transatlantic crossings.</TE>
<TE>   Charter flights are another object of bargaining. When I was a
charter tour operator in the '70s, I sent young staff members to see
off our flights at the airport; they were directed to sell off any
remaining seats for any price that did not injure our dignity. If a
bargainer offered $59 for the one-way crossing to London leaving in
20 minutes, we'd stamp off in righteous indignation; if he offered
$99, that was another matter.</TE>
<TE>   More prudent travelers would phone our office the day before a
charter's departure to determine whether there were empty seats.
Although we could not provide them with hotel space at that point,
we'd welcome the calls as a means of squeezing out a few last dollars
of profit. Hard bargainers continue to make such calls to tour
operators or consolidators who have committed themselves to blocks of
air tickets and would rather cut the price on unsold seats than have
empty seats.</TE>
<TE>   The travel industry consists of perishable products (seats, rooms,
cabins, cars) that must be sold for a particular departure or their
value is lost forever. That is why most travel suppliers will react
positively to your requests for a discount. Ask, and it shall be
given you--more often than you'd suspect.</TE>

<HD>This Spring, Smaller Ships That Don't Require Larger
Wallets</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A reader recently bemoaned the trend toward bigger ships and said the
alternative--small luxury ships--was out of his price range.</LD>
<LD>   Well, good news is on the horizon. P&amp;O Cruises has purchased three
small ships of the former Renaissance Cruises fleet and announced
that they will be sailing late this year and in early spring on
affordable itineraries.</LD>
<LD>   Two of the 688-passenger ships, the former R3 and R4, will sail
under the Princess Cruises flag; the R8 will replace Swan Hellenic's
Minerva and become the Minerva II. R4 will be renamed the Tahitian
Princess and will sail on various itineraries from Papeete, Tahiti.
The R3, renamed the Pacific Princess, will split the year sailing
from Tahiti under the Princess Cruises banner and in the South
Pacific under the P&amp;O Australian Cruises flag.</LD>
<TE>   Few changes are expected to be made on the R3 and R4, besides
painting the blue hull white and attaching new logos on the stack.
The 30,277-ton ships, which carry a crew of 373, will feature many of
the Personal Choice options found on larger Princess ships. There
will be 24-hour dining in the Lido Cafe and alternative dining
programs in Sabatini's Trattoria and the Sterling Steakhouse besides
the traditional dining room experience.</TE>
<TE>   The ships have 282 standard cabins, ranging in size from a
windowless inside one, with 156 square feet to outside cabins with
balconies at a comfortable 216 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   Fifty-two mini-suites are 322 square feet and 10 suites have 786
to 962 square feet. Cabins have twin beds that can be combined into
one queen-size bed, a breakfast table, sofa, desk/dresser and bath
with shower. Suites contain extra chairs, mini-bar and bath/shower
combination, and the top suites have a separate living room with an
entertainment center, a CD player and a bathroom with Jacuzzi tub
plus an additional half-bath for guests.</TE>
<TE>   The initial holiday cruise of the Tahitian Princess will leave
Papeete on Dec. 24 for a 10-day sailing that will call at Bora-Bora,
Moorea and Raiatea. After that will be 34 French Polynesia/Cook
Islands sailings with overnight stays in Papeete and Bora-Bora; eight
French Polynesia/Samoa cruises, which include visits to Pago Pago and
Apia; and eight itineraries in the Marquesas that will visit Nuku
Hiva and Hiva Oa along with the Polynesian ports of call. Promotional
pricing for the 10-day sailings begins at $799 per person, double
occupancy.</TE>
<TE>   South Pacific itineraries for the Pacific Princess are being
developed, with the first sailing scheduled from Sydney, Australia,
on Nov. 18. It will begin sailing in Tahiti in spring, then go to San
Francisco for 10 Alaska cruises next summer, each 11 days long,
before returning to Tahiti and Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Swan Hellenic Cruises, also part of the P&amp;O group, has planned
many changes to the former R8 to bring the ship more in line with its
cruise line "experience," says Carolanne Dieleman, the line's sales
and marketing director. Passengers will be limited to 600, although
the ship can hold 696. Open seating in the dining room will continue,
but the line will add two alternative restaurants, one featuring
ethnic dishes based on the ship's itinerary, the other a grill room
serving simple food, steaks and chops "without fancy sauces."</TE>
<TE>   But the real staples of the Swan Hellenic experience are on-board
lecturers, in-depth shore excursions, classical music recitals, art
classes and performances by local music and dance groups. The
expansive spa on the new Minerva II will offer alternative therapies
and exercises, including tai chi and yoga classes.</TE>
<TE>   The casino aboard the former R8 will be remade into the Wheeler
Bar, and the Observation Lounge will become the Orpheus Room, a venue
for classical and jazz concerts and an occasional mini-production
from London's West End theater district. Other areas on the made-over
ship: an Internet room, fitness center and spa, and a pool deck with
two whirlpool spas.</TE>
<TE>   Cabin decor will reflect the ambience of an English country house.</TE>
<TE>   Minerva II's maiden voyage, from April 16 to 26, will leave from
Valletta, Malta, for visits to Greece and Turkey, sailing via
Katakolo for historic Olympia and Gythion for Mistra before berthing
in Piraeus for Athens. Additional calls will be at Delos, Heraklion
and Rhodes, ending with visits to Kusadasi and Ephesus. Prices begin
at $3,218 per person, double occupancy, and include air fare to and
from London to the ship, shore excursions, entrance fees, transfers
and gratuities, both on board and ashore.</TE>
<TE>   Next summer there will be a series of round-trip sailings from
Britain, including a four-day "tester" cruise from Dover to Amsterdam
and to Antwerp, Belgium, on Aug. 30, and to Guernsey and St. Malo on
Sept. 3. Prices begin at $961 and $755, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   During the 2003 Christmas holidays, the Minerva II will sail in
the Caribbean, ending in New Orleans in its first U.S. visit. From

<HD>In the Sierra, Hot Springs Full of Surprises</HD>
<DH>A couple find an earthy, peaceful retreat--and a new
definition of 'clothing optional'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ALEXANDER</AU>
<BD>Karen Alexander is a freelance journalist in the Bay
Area.</BD>
<DL>SIERRAVILLE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>I learned about the vegetarian, clothing-optional Sierra Hot Springs
retreat north of Truckee from my rabbi. The friend who told her about
it failed to mention the nudity part, but I can't say the rabbi
didn't warn me.</LD>
<LD>   I was seven months pregnant, and a weightless soak in natural hot
springs beckoned. Pregnant women are advised to avoid torrid Jacuzzis
and the like, but one of Sierra Hot Springs' pools was tepid enough
for a safe soak. For my husband, Ross, and me, this escape was
probably our last without a car seat and diaper bag for some time, so
going a little bohemian seemed appropriate.</LD>
<LD>   Sierra Hot Springs is a funky resort (think water yoga, meditation
and a workshop titled "Intuitive Journeys With Andre") at the edge of
Tahoe National Forest, about 60 miles west of the Reno airport. It's
operated by a nonprofit group called the New Age Church of Being but
is better known as the sister property of Harbin Hot Springs, the
longtime popular retreat near Napa Valley. Membership bought at one
property ($5 per month, $20 per year) allows a couple admission to
both.</LD>
<TE>   We set out one Friday afternoon a few weeks ago, stopping to
eat in Truckee after it became apparent that we wouldn't arrive in time
for Sierra Hot Springs' dinner buffet. A swashbuckling railroad town
at the entrance to the national forest, Truckee feels like the set of
a western movie, though the cooks here seem to offer as much foie
gras as chicken fried steak. We scrutinized every restaurant on
Commercial Row, the town's main street, before choosing Moody's
Bistro &amp; Lounge in the Truckee Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's opened in July. It has a lively bar, a hip interior and a
brick patio, which we chose over the more formal-looking dining room.
I had a delicious appetizer of bleu cheese, figs and crostini drizzled
with a port syrup.  My entree was perfectly seared escolar over sun-dried
tomato risotto.  The whole thing was sprinkled with black olive tapenade.</TE>
<TE>   Ross started with curried carrot soup. Fully aware that his next
meals at Sierra Hot Springs would be vegetarian--and possibly laced
with tofu--he soothed his carnivorous spirit with steak frites. It
was a 12-ounce New York steak with bearnaise and bordelaise sauces,
and it came with excellent herbed French fries. With a glass of wine
for Ross, the bill came to $65.80 plus tip--slightly less than our
next four meals combined.</TE>
<TE>   We arrived at Sierra Hot Springs after dark. The resort's
accommodations include a lodge and the Globe Hotel in the center of
Sierraville, about four minutes away.</TE>
<TE>   The lodge has a nice lawn and an ample front porch with
comfortable lounge chairs and wobbly tables. Inside are five private
rooms, a dormitory-style room that sleeps four on mattresses lined up
across the floor ($44 per person on weekends) and shared bathrooms.
Decor is attic chic with earth-mother touches. The building also has
an airy wood-paneled lounge, a communal kitchen, a TV room and space
used for meetings and yoga sessions.</TE>
<TE>   Our room was in the 10-room Globe Hotel, a clean, cheery,
two-story place with a wraparound porch. There are goddess murals on
the staircase and wild red-and-yellow Venetian carpet in the halls.</TE>
<TE>   The word "hotel" is used loosely. Our room ($99 a night, no tax)
had a queen bed with floral sheets, an armoire, a little shelf and
two towels. For everything else, including toiletries, we were on our
own.</TE>
<TE>   Out in the hall, headed for one of the shared bathrooms, I
encountered my first naked people. They were a couple on their way
from the steam room to a shower. I just wanted to brush my teeth, and
the whole scene was a little more intimate than I had expected. I
would soon learn that much about Sierra Hot Springs is more intimate
than I had expected.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday we woke up in time to return to the lodge for
a satisfying continental breakfast: organic yogurt, fruit, cereal,
bagels and delicious fresh-baked, organic whole-wheat apple
croissants. As we ate on the porch, we got a first good look at the
peaceful surroundings. Abutting the forest, the front of the lodge
overlooks a grassy valley that was dusty yellow in the September sun.
In the near distance, cows moved languorously across pastures. If the
actors of "Little House on the Prairie" had ambled by in a covered
wagon, they would not have looked out of place.</TE>
<TE>   We hustled off to a water yoga class--at 9:15, already the second
session of the day. Several water yoga classes are offered on the
weekends at no additional charge, as is one hatha yoga class on land.</TE>
<TE>   Guests have four ways to partake of the resort's namesake hot
springs. Three of the facilities feature natural, unregulated spring
water with no disinfectants and no filtration system, though the tubs
and pools are cleaned regularly. All have adjacent showers.</TE>
<TE>   The smell of sulfur and other minerals is strong but seems to fade
after a few minutes, and the waters feel remarkably silky. Except for
the Warm Pool, which is close to body temperature, the waters are a
sultry 104 degrees or so.</TE>
<TE>   The steamiest is the Hot Pool in the Temple Dome, a gleaming
copper geodesic structure with skylights, stained glass and a stone
sculpture resembling Buddha. Also inside the dome are two cold plunge
tubs.</TE>
<TE>   The somewhat rickety Phoenix Baths are in private wood-paneled
rooms. They are small, deep tubs flowing with constantly running hot
spring water. To use the tubs, visitors merely plug the drain and let
the tub fill.</TE>
<TE>   By far the prettiest of the pools is the Medicine Bath, an outdoor
oasis in the trees. It's a small sand-bottom pool surrounded by rocks
and grass, with a pretty fountain and a delicate gazebo nearby for
shade. Here we stumbled upon a quiet man wearing nothing but a straw
hat. He was painting a watercolor in the morning sun.</TE>
<TE>   Water yoga is in the Warm Pool. It looks like a conventional
swimming pool, and the natural hot-spring water is filtered and
treated with a bromine disinfectant. I was thankful that the pool had
a canvas canopy and was mostly shaded.</TE>
<TE>   When we reported for class, half a dozen guests were in the water.
Other folks were reading, meditating or doing their own yoga regimens
on the deck. Much to our surprise, our bathing suits were the only
apparel in sight. Here "clothing optional" is the exact opposite of
"black tie optional." In the latter, you are the odd bird if you
don't wear a tux. Here, you stick out if you wear anything.</TE>
<TE>   Charles, the water-yoga instructor, is an ageless,
hairless, patient man with a soothing voice and no tan lines. He said
he's one of about 20 people in the country trained in this method of
water yoga. "If you think this next stretch is difficult," he joked
repeatedly, "try it out there on the deck."</TE>
<TE>   We stretched and twisted into various positions for the
better part of an hour, and soon our bodies were sapped of energy. It
was only 10:30, but Ross and I were pooped.</TE>
<TE>   At the lodge we found two cushiony lounge chairs on the front
porch and settled in with books. Giant dragonflies circled lazily
overhead. The cows grazed across the valley. I read three pages
before tumbling into an indolent sleep.</TE>
<TE>   At Sierra Hot Springs, it's luxuriously easy to do nothing. The
hot waters, the resort's raison d'etre, held little allure after our
morning immersion. Even had I not been pregnant, I think the other
hot springs, like most Jacuzzis, would have been too hot for us to
soak in comfortably for more than 10 minutes, though some guests
lingered happily for hours.</TE>
<TE>   I booked a massage for later in the day, and we returned to
Sierraville's downtown, if it can be called that, for lunch. The town
has a pizza place, two diners and a cafe with espresso and
croissants. We had eggs and hash browns at the Stagecoach Steakhouse,
a friendly place where Saturday cartoons were playing above the bar.</TE>
<TE>   We spent the rest of the afternoon on gentle hikes along the
property's wooded outskirts, meandering among the pine trees on roads
maintained by the National Forest Service. Serious trails were only a
half-hour drive away, but the walk here suited us fine.</TE>
<TE>   My 5 p.m. massage with a therapist named Jenna was a highlight of
the day. Treatments are $60 for an hour, $80 for 90 minutes. For the
same price, you can get an "Alpine Watsu" treatment, which is
described as "a co-mingling of Zen shiatsu, range of motion and
stretching, all applied while floating in a warm pool of water."</TE>
<TE>   My massage, in a sunny upstairs lodge room, was nurturing and
professional. Not that I had been in the least bit stressed to begin
with, but I emerged feeling even more peaceful and relaxed.</TE>
<TE>   The lodge serves a $12 vegetarian buffet at 6:30 nightly. That
particular evening, it followed an Asian theme: miso soup, sauteed
greens, edamame (fresh soybeans) and two salads, one green and one
seaweed. The main dish was brown rice or noodles topped with coconut
curry vegetables. All of the food tasted wholesome and delicious,
although the home-baked strawberry shortcake offered for dessert was
so hard it bent Ross' fork.</TE>
<TE>   We brought our plates to our favorite spot on the porch and ate
while the hills changed color and then faded into the darkening
valley. Later we played an intense game of Scrabble on the porch. It
was by far the most rigorous exercise of the day.</TE>
<TE>   Before turning in for the night, we used our flashlight to reach a
little wooden deck by the Medicine Bath to gawk at the heavens. Two
girls and their grandparents were playing quietly in the pool. The
night sky was cloudless and overwhelming with stars. We stared until
our eyes grew heavy. The day had been long and decadently slow, and
we were asleep by 10 p.m.</TE>

<HD>In Fall, the Golden State Shows Off the Meaning of Its Name</HD>

<LD>California state parks offer marvelous desert trails in the winter,
wildflower walks in the spring and alpine sojourns in the summer. But
come fall, hikers often dismiss the Golden State in favor of New
England's color shows.</LD>
<LD>   Nonsense. Many state parks here have fine displays of autumn
foliage. Here are a half-dozen classics.</LD>
<LD>   For more suggestions and information, call the California State
Parks information line, (916) 653-6995, or visit www.parks.ca.gov.</LD>
<TE>   Another good resource is the California State Parks Foundation,
(800) 963-7275, www.calparks.org.</TE>
<TE>   * Cuyamaca Rancho State Park: Autumn is at its colorful best in
the Cuyamacas, a mountain range with 4,000- to 6,500-foot peaks. The
park, northeast of San Diego, has black oaks that glow red and yellow
along the Kelly Ditch Trail. This route travels 5 1/2 miles from
Cuyamaca Reservoir north to William Heise County Park.</TE>
<TE>   Be advised that plenty of crimson poison oak is part of the path's
palette too.</TE>
<TE>   Gnarled old trees stand above a blanket of ferns and dry grasses
in soft shades of yellow and brown. Through gaps in the oak canopy,
you can see nearby canyons aflame with fall color and, when the light
is just right, the blue Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   Black oaks also will impress hikers who take the Harvey Moore
Trail, a 12-mile loop. To the north, Palomar Mountain State Park
features meadows full of bracken fern in rich golden brown.</TE>
<TE>   12551 Highway 79 (five miles north of Interstate 8), Descanso;
(760) 765-0755.</TE>
<TE>   * Point Mugu State Park: All monarch butterflies this side of the
Rockies head west in the fall, and one of the best places in Southern
California to observe their arrival is Big Sycamore Canyon at Point
Mugu State Park.</TE>
<TE>   The trip along Big Sycamore Canyon Trail to Deer Camp Junction (6
1/2 miles round trip) runs through a peaceful canyon with magnificent
trees and, as the season progresses, a multitude of monarchs.</TE>
<TE>   In October and November, the twin delights of falling leaves and
fluttering butterflies are particularly appealing. Ask park rangers
where the monarchs cluster in large numbers.</TE>
<TE>   9000 W. Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu; (818) 880-0350.</TE>
<TE>   * Annadel State Park: Black oaks and big-leaf maples along the
park's creeks are the autumnal attractions of this Sonoma County
park.</TE>
<TE>   A good hike is the five-mile round trip to Lake Ilsanjo.
Unfortunately, in some areas of the park, the yellow of the maple
leaves may be as much because of drought stress as seasonal change.</TE>
<TE>   6201 Channel Drive (south of Highway 12), Santa Rosa; (707)
539-3911, (707) 938-1519.</TE>
<TE>   * Bothe-Napa Valley State Park: Sure, the oaks and maples can put
on a colorful show. But even if they didn't, this park north of St.
Helena is worth a stop. Walk along redwood-lined Ritchey Creek or
trek up to Coyote Peak (6 1/2 miles round trip) for a panorama of the
wine country. If you're touring Napa Valley during the fall harvest,
stop at this park for a picnic.</TE>
<TE>   Off Highway 29/128 between St. Helena and Calistoga; (707)
942-4575, (707) 938-1519.</TE>
<TE>   * Sugar Pine Point State Park: Think Tahoe, and tree lovers like
me naturally think of conifers: firs, pines, incense cedar. Autumn,
however, is a deciduous delight.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the best colors in this area can be found along Highway 89
from South Lake Tahoe to the park, on the lake's western shore.</TE>
<TE>   The black cottonwood and quaking aspen along the General Creek
Trail (a 4 1/2-mile loop) are something to behold this time of year.</TE>
<TE>   Off Highway 89, nine miles south of Tahoe City; (530) 525-7982,
(530) 525-7232.</TE>
<TE>   * Grover Hot Springs State Park: Not far from Sugar Pine Point is
Grover Hot Springs, south of Lake Tahoe and just west of
Markleeville. Easy family hikes in the area include a nature trail
called Transition Walk, which loops around an alpine meadow, and a
walk to a waterfall (three miles round trip) on Hot Springs Creek.</TE>
<TE>   The quaking aspen fringing the meadow are particularly showy in
autumn, when the leaves turn orange and gold. After a hike in the
brisk alpine air, soak in the 102- to 105-degree water of the park's
soothing hot springs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Off Hot Springs Road, four miles west of Markleeville; (530)
694-2248, (530) 525-7232.</TE>

was a marvelous story, except for the part where writer Rosemary
McClure had to fight L.A. traffic and drive eight hours to get to
Williams, Ariz., arriving at 4 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   Amtrak has daily service to Williams, leaving Los Angeles at 6:45
p.m. and arriving at 4:35 a.m. Next time you want to go to the Grand

<HD>Airlines Keep Piling On Restrictions</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Regarding "As Airlines Change Rules, Passengers Hold the Bag" (Travel
Insider, Sept. 15): Once again the airlines are heaping more
restrictions and use-it-or-lose-it rules onto travelers, and their
pattern of poor service continues. The government approved a
$15-billion package to keep the airlines flying, but their service
keeps getting worse.</LD>
<LD>   Government aid is sometimes necessary. But there should be a few
strings attached, including an independent review of egregious
restrictions like those announced recently.</LD>
<LD>   BRENDAN MORRISSEY</LD>
<TE>   Manhattan Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With the new restrictions on ticketing, passengers are going to
travel no matter how ill they are, rather than forfeit a costly
ticket. Aircraft will become germ incubators, and more people will
become sick after flying. I hope the public will patronize only
consumer-friendly airlines.</TE>

<LD>Last month my husband and I stayed at Hotel Neptune in Dubrovnik,
Croatia. After we left the country, I realized I had left my wedding
ring on the bathroom sink at the hotel, and I was sick about its
loss.</LD>
<LD>   When I returned to California a couple of weeks later, I contacted
the hotel by e-mail to inquire about the ring. I was thrilled to
learn that a maid had found it. Now I now have my wedding ring
back--and positive thoughts about Croatia. I highly recommend travel
to this beautiful country and am thankful to its wonderful people.</LD>

<LD>My husband and I returned recently from a week in the Czech Republic.
I've heard repeatedly that tourism is down because of fear of disease
or other problems related to the floods in August.</LD>
<LD>   Cleanup has proceeded at an impressive pace in the Czech Republic.
Many buildings had been repaired, replastered, recarpeted and
repainted by the time we arrived on Sept. 6. We suffered no
food-related illnesses even though we took no precautions.</LD>
<LD>   The best way to help Central Europe recover from the economic
devastation of the recent floods is to continue with travel plans.</LD>

groceries, they returned to a mutiny in their rented RV. Lizzie,
their wolf-chow mix, had taken the wheel. Lizzie's daughter Jo Lula,
the product of a fling with a Burmese mountain dog, was by her side.
"It was perfect," Nancy says, noting that uptight-and-serious Lizzie
looked as if she were "trying to make a proper turn," while ditsy Jo
Lula daydreamed in the passenger seat. ("Her motto ought to be 'No
brains, no headaches,' " Nancy says.) Their owners still chuckle at
this photo. They imagine Lizzie lecturing, "If you're going to drive
someday, keep your eyes on the road and quit barking at the
squirrels!"</CP>

<HD>The Best Vacations Start With a Great Itinerary, Whether on
a Tour or Alone</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN SPANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The humble itinerary is a little-appreciated aspect of travel. It can
be a work of art when carefully and creatively planned. I thrill to
receive my schedule for trips.</LD>
<LD>   I read the agendas in tour brochures for pleasure, and I have
devised a few myself that were deeply satisfying, like the itinerary
I created for a challenging independent visit to China in 1996.</LD>
<LD>   I'm a born planner, so itinerary-making is second nature. But it's
not that way for everyone. Many travelers with time, money and
imaginations as wide as the sky get completely messed up when they
try to make a plan.</LD>
<TE>   The first step is easy: deciding where you want to go, how long
you can spend, whether you want to tour several countries or focus on
one place. The next is knowing when to seek help by calling a travel
agent or booking a package trip. "You can buy an airplane ticket
yourself on the Internet," says Marc Mancini, who teaches in the
travel industry program at West Los Angeles College, "but should you
book a cruise or tour on your own?"</TE>
<TE>   Mancini says the differences among cruise and tour packages and
even among hotels in the same chain are so great that people who make
bookings themselves, without the help of a knowledgeable agent, do so
at their own risk.</TE>
<TE>   Besides cruises and tours, long, complex trips to exotic places
sometimes require the expertise of a travel agent or tour company.
Louanne Kalvinskas, co-owner of Distant Lands, a Pasadena travel book
and gear shop, says she easily organized a trip for herself and her
sister to the Pacific Northwest in September. But when she started
thinking about going to Ethiopia last year, she found a package tour
that suited her fine.</TE>
<TE>   Tours are good for novice world travelers too, Kalvinskas says.
They should think about subjects of interest--Navajo weaving,
Sumerian archeology, Himalayan snow leopards--and then find an
association that sponsors trips that explore them. And even
tour-takers shouldn't leave home without a good guidebook, she says,
because human guides don't know everything and you'll always have
free time to fill.</TE>
<TE>   Do-it-yourself planners spend a great deal of time on the next
step in trip planning: researching destinations. This means
approaches as diverse as taking up meditation if you're going to
India, cribbing ideas from tour company brochures and burying your
head in guidebooks. Kalvinskas gets inspiration about what to do and
see from lushly photographed books in the Insight, Fodor's Exploring,
Knopf and Eyewitness series, then zeroes in with Frommer's, Best
Places and Lonely Planet guides when deciding on such details as
hotels.</TE>
<TE>   Research also is paramount for Rob Sangster, author of "Traveler's
Tool Kit" (Menasha Ridge Press, 1996). He focuses on the literature
and culture of his destination and pays less attention to specifics
such as lodgings because they can be worked out on the spot. He
learns all he can about events--festivals, markets, the theater
season--and transportation so he can plan his trips accordingly.
"There's a little boat that goes across Lake Titicaca between Bolivia
and Peru, but it only makes the trip once a week," Sangster says. "If
you learn these things you get to do all the great things in the
world."</TE>
<TE>   Once you're feeling reasonably knowledgeable about your
destination, the next stage is making a calendar. Travel pros do this
because it allows them to think visually by blocking out days for
each stop. Remember that you won't get much sightseeing done on
travel days and that you should give yourself extra time to
recuperate if you're prone to jet lag. Don't book tight connections
either; it's easier on your nerves.</TE>
<TE>   You begin to lock in your calendar by buying transportation, which
usually means buying a plane ticket. I routinely spend at least a day
calling airlines, travel agents and consolidators, comparing prices
and schedules, but when it comes time to pay for the ticket, I'm as
nervous as a runner before a race. What happens if I buy a
nonrefundable plane ticket but can't get hotel reservations? Sandra
Gustafson, author of the "Great Sleeps" and "Great Eats" guidebook
series, published by Chronicle Books, says not to worry. "See about
the flight first, then book accommodations," she told me recently.
"There are a lot more of them than there are flights."</TE>
<TE>   Next I start booking special tours and expeditions that require
reservations and must be done at a certain time. For instance, the
royal palace in Brussels is open for tours only briefly in the
summer. To see Georgia O'Keeffe's home in Abiquiu, N.M., you must
reserve well in advance.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, I work on accommodations, usually by fax or
Internet. This yields printed confirmations, which can be valuable if
a hotel loses your reservation. Sometimes I don't bother booking
hotels in advance, particularly if I'm going to a place with lots of
choices. It can be fun to find little pearls that aren't in the
guidebooks, and, as Gustafson says, you sometimes get the best deals
on the spot, asking for a room for that night and promising to pay in
cash.</TE>
<TE>   But Gustafson never wings it when she arrives at her destination.
"I'm tired, and I want to know where I'm going to sleep the first
night," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Gradually the calendar fills and evolves into an itinerary, which
I distribute to colleagues, family and friends. I take several copies
on the trip, secreted in my purse, carry-on bag and checked luggage,
to make sure I never lose it. Another copy is ceremoniously placed in
a burgeoning file folder at home.</TE>
<TE>   Itineraries aren't just dates, addresses and flight numbers.
They're the tracks we leave across the world, reminding us years
later of all the places we've been and things we've done.</TE>

<AU>ROSEMARY McCLURE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Easter Island, one of the most mysterious and remote places in the
world, is being coupled with Chile's starkly beautiful Atacama Desert
on a tour designed by LanChile Vacations.</LD>
<LD>   The trip, which can be arranged for one or two weeks, begins with
a visit to Easter Island, a 64-square-mile triangle of volcanic rock
in the South Pacific.</LD>
<LD>   The island is more than 2,000 miles from the nearest population
center and is best known for the giant 1,000-year-old stone monoliths
on its coastline. It has been called an open-air museum because of
its many archeological sites and because of the baffling history of
its first inhabitants.</LD>
<TE>   Easter Island's clear blue waters sharply contrast with the
Atacama Desert, the second stop on the itinerary.</TE>
<TE>   The Atacama is the driest area in the world, with regions where
rainfall has never been recorded. Despite this, its landscape is
striking: a vast region of intense colors, peaks and expanses of
desert.</TE>
<TE>   The LanChile tour books travelers into Explora, a luxury hotel
that offers various excursions in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Cost: A weeklong tour starts at $3,000, including air fare from
LAX, airport transfers, bilingual guided tours, three nights in a
hotel on Easter Island, breakfasts on Easter Island, sightseeing and
national park entrance fees. In the Atacama, the tour includes three
nights' accommodations, all meals and a choice of excursions by
trekking, horseback riding, mountain biking or van to visit salt
lakes, geysers, the Valley of the Moon and ancient villages.</TE>

<DL>VAISON-LA-ROMAINE, France</DL>
<LD>Rays of sun spilled over my shoulder as I stood on the terrace of our
bed-and-breakfast. They poured onto the Ouveze River and the lower
part of town and caught on the hillsides, turning them lavender. As I
looked out over the tiled rooftops, I noticed a small blue house on
the opposite riverbank. It was a stroke of color among
Vaison-la-Romaine's gray stone buildings. The shutters swung open on
the upper floor. A couple stood in the window, and they embraced and
kissed.</LD>
<LD>   Romance comes naturally in this ancient city, as I would learn on
my seven-day visit here last fall.</LD>
<TE>   Before I arrived I had known about Vaison from American writer and
cookbook author Patricia Wells, who lives with her husband in a
converted farmhouse outside town. I envied her for being able to live
in a region that is, essentially, an immense garden planted with
vineyards, orchards and cypress trees and watched over by Mont
Ventoux, at 6,300 feet one of the highest peaks between the Alps and
the Pyrenees. Every time I roasted a leg of lamb or prepared the
classic French potato dish called gratin dauphinois in my kitchen in
San Diego, I thought of the bustling Provencal market where Wells
filled her basket with fresh-picked tomatoes, purple stalks of
asparagus and pungent ropes of garlic. And although I didn't bring
any pots and pans to Vaison, I wanted to soak up the inspiration for
her dishes, to sit in a cafe feasting on roasted chicken with apricot
stuffing or some other culinary delight that I couldn't get back
home.</TE>
<TE>   My husband, Ralph, and I have the palates for fine wine but not
the budget. Still, we have managed to visit Provence once or twice a
year for the past decade, drawn by the region's good food and wine.
This is the kind of place where, when they are not eating, people are
either planning their next meal or talking about their last one.</TE>
<TE>   Last October we were driving on curving country roads of the
Vaucluse, the sun-drenched departement, or county, where the Alps and
the plains of the Rhone River Valley meet, when I saw a small white
sign with "Vaison-la-Romaine" painted on it. On impulse, I asked
Ralph to turn our rented Renault up D938 toward the rolling green
hills in the distance.</TE>
<TE>   Vaison has a little more than 5,000 residents. In summer tourists
swell the population, but it remains mostly a sleepy farm town with
touches of sophistication. The fields along the banks of the Ouveze
River, which bisects the town, contain mostly wine grapes.</TE>
<TE>   People were living in Vaison as far back as 4,000 years ago, but
it was the Romans who put this place on the map. They arrived in the
1st century BC and created a town called Vasio Vocontiorium on the
north bank of the Ouveze. Drawn by the lush agricultural lands,
wealthy Roman families moved in, building luxurious homes with
gardens and mosaic-tile floors, as well as an amphitheater, a bridge,
an aqueduct and baths.</TE>
<TE>   Vaison's population soared to 10,000 by AD 14, and it became a
center of politics in the region. The ruins of Vasio Vocontiorium are
one of the largest and best-preserved Roman archeological sites in
France, and they alone made our detour worthwhile.</TE>
<TE>   We arrived at the base of the Ville Haute, or high village, an
area of narrow medieval cobblestone streets at the base of a chateau,
an abandoned stronghold that dominated the town in the Middle Ages. I
saw a wood sign that pointed to a chambres d'hote, a B&amp;B called
L'Eveche. A few shops and restaurants were scattered around, and I
made a note to peek in later after we checked in at L'Eveche, which
was a bishop's palace built in the 16th century. Its owner, Aude
Verdier, greeted us with a warm smile and a "bonjour" and led us past
a small sitting room with a sofa, a few chairs and a mantel lined
with regional guidebooks, up a steep, narrow staircase past walls
filled with colorful posters of art shows featuring local painters.
Using an old-fashioned skeleton key, she unlocked the solid wood door
to the "rose room," named for the pinkish Provencal bedspreads and
tiles in the large bathroom. I took in the whitewashed beamed
ceiling, oversized tub and pink geraniums along the windows and
promised myself a soak after I had satiated my hunger. Ralph was
eager to taste the local wines, so we said au revoir to our hostess
and set off on foot down the hill.</TE>
<TE>   Walking past splashing fountains and a large city gate, we crossed
the 2,000-year-old, 55-foot single-arched Gallo-Roman bridge that
connects the old Roman city to the south bank's medieval Ville Haute.
The river's slow, shallow current looked harmless enough, but a large
marble memorial at the bridge's entrance reminded us that the
Ouveze's periodic flooding had taken lives. It honored not only the
men and women who died in all the wars the French had fought, but
also 35 villagers who drowned in a flash flood in September 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Ralph held my hand as he guided me through the south bank's maze
of streets lined with eclectic shops. Fashionable clothing, lingerie
and magazines were being sold alongside artwork, books and, two
favorites of tourists, lavender sachets and bags of Herbes de
Provence.</TE>
<TE>   We wandered the streets until the sun set, discovering bakeries
and pastry shops as well as the occasional gallery or artist's
studio. At one, the Galerie d'Art de la Place du Poids, the precise,
intense brushstrokes of renowned French artist Leon Zanella caught my
eye. The bold compositions, bursting in shades of indigo, red and
yellow, were so enticing that I found myself trying to peer into the
shuttered shop.</TE>
<TE>   We eventually rounded a corner and found ourselves in the town
square, Place de Monfort, lined on one side with open-air cafes
covered with bright awnings.</TE>
<TE>   After scanning menus posted outside, we walked into Le Brin
d'Olivier, a hopping little restaurant near the bridge. Each table
was set with fragrant flowers and a large bowl of olives, and I hoped
the crisp elegance of the dining room's decor would be reflected in
the quality of our meals.</TE>
<TE>   Almost all of the restaurant's 40 seats were taken, mostly by
locals dressed as if they were dining at the Ritz. We sipped cooling
kir royales, a classic aperitif of sparkling wine with a splash of
creme de cassis, as we perused the menu. Ralph also ordered vin de
table. The red Cotes du Rhone was light and fresh.</TE>
<TE>   Ralph gave me a morsel of duck, which was smothered in roasted
garlic, sliced and served with a Merlot gravy. He would part with
only one bite, so I dove into my poultry bouillabaisse with garlic,
tomatoes, white wine and olive oil. Crisp croutons and rouille, a
garlicky mayonnaise made with olive oil, added to its potency. With
more wine, an arugula salad, and cheeses and creme brulee with
lavender for dessert, we paid less than $75 for one of the best meals
I have ever eaten.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning we set off to see the Roman ruins. After paying a
$7 entrance fee, we started in the Puymin Quarter, which contains the
House of the Messii. Owned by one of the wealthiest families in
ancient Vaison, the luxurious home was almost 56,000 square feet in
its original state and contained intricate mosaic floors. Slightly
east of the mansion is Pompeii's Portico, a courtyard planted with
cypress and oak trees that once held atriums, thermal baths and
fishponds. Rainwater would collect in pools and was used to irrigate
the gardens. Large colonnaded overhangs shaded the walkways.</TE>
<TE>   We were amazed at the originality and extravagance of these
ancient homes. Villas had plumbing systems, with water brought into
them through lead pipes. Waste water was flushed out through another
system of pipes and aqueducts to the river.</TE>
<TE>   The Villasse Quarter, near the center of town, was the central
shopping area of Vasio Vocontiorium. Romans used the public baths
here. Only a few steps away is the Romanesque Cathedral of Notre Dame
de Nazareth, which was built in the 12th and 13th centuries around a
Roman temple that stood on the same site. The church, considered one
of the finest of its type in Provence, has a beautiful and artistic
cloister with three small arches supported by double rows of pillars.
The flood of 1992 destroyed much of the cloisters, but most of the
church remains standing.</TE>
<TE>   My favorite site was the 6,000-seat amphitheater, built in the 1st
century on the north slope of the hillside and still used for plays
and concerts. Excavations, begun in the late 1800s, uncovered little
of the original structure--only two arches and the bare traces of the
stage foundations remained. Most of what visitors see now was
reconstructed in 1932.</TE>
<TE>   As I sat on a stone seat, Ralph climbed onto the granite stage and
began serenading me.</TE>
<TE>   After our tour of the ancient world, we reentered the modern one.
As in all Provencal towns, the heart of Vaison life is the square,
and every Tuesday since 1483, the Place de Monfort and many nearby
streets are taken over by a farmers market. Strolling the stalls, we
found a range of goods for sale, from cookware to bright fabrics
typical of Provence. After browsing, we purchased the provisions for
a picnic.</TE>
<TE>   We drove out of town and settled in for a picnic in a vineyard,
lunching on crusty bread with tangy mustard, an assortment of smelly
cheeses and ripe, uncured olives while sipping on a local red.</TE>
<TE>   I looked at my husband, a big smile on his face as he tried to
talk me into riding a bike down Mont Ventoux. I closed my eyes and
relived the past few days, waking up to the song of cicadas, smelling
the fragrance of freshly baked bread.</TE>
<TE>   As Ralph poured some more wine, a breeze caressed my shoulders
and, just like that, my husband of 20 years leaned over and kissed
me. Romance was in the air in Vaison.</TE>

<DL>ROBIN HOOD'S BAY, England</DL>
<LD>As we started down the steep hill, the flat calm of the autumn North
Sea lay in front of us, meeting the horizon in varying shades of
gray. The morning threatened drizzle. The street, just wide enough
for one car, bore the sign "Necessary vehicular access only," so we
descended on foot.</LD>
<LD>   At turns in the narrow, worn cobblestone sidewalk, tiny,
picturesque houses and shops materialized from under red tile roofs.
They were crammed closely together, constructed on the craggy, steep
rocks of a ravine that tumbled down to the sea.</LD>
<LD>   When we reached the sea, we tried exploring the village with a map
picked up at a local coffee shop, but it offered little help. We got
lost in a maze of passageways and alleys. Nonetheless, it was great
fun. "Oh, look at this doorway," one of us would call, or "Let's see
what's in this little shop."</LD>
<TE>   Ellie, my traveling companion, and I had taken a train from London
several days earlier and picked up a rental car at the station in
York. We drove across the Yorkshire moors on narrow, winding roads
from Pickering to Red House Farm, where we rented a cottage for a
week. The farm was in Glaisdale, a tiny village within North York
Moors National Park and eight miles from Whitby, an old resort town
and port.</TE>
<TE>   These expansive Yorkshire moors--open, rolling uplands covered
with heather--were made famous by the Bronte sisters in their popular
novels. Between the lonely, forbidding and wind-swept moors lay
green, rolling dales dotted with hamlets.</TE>
<TE>   We followed a leisurely pace in the car, stopping to sightsee
along the two-hour drive to the farm and during the week we were
there, warmed by the friendliness of the people and relishing
differences in the dramatic landscapes.</TE>
<TE>   North York Moors National Park covers 553 square miles. Forty
percent of it is open moorland, the largest expanse of heather
moorland in England and Wales. The high ridges offer far-reaching
views over the green dales and forests. The moors are wild and
remote, offering a haven for curlew, grouse and golden plover, all of
which nest in the heather.</TE>
<TE>   Villages, seemingly little changed in several hundred years, are
scattered throughout the dales. Stopping the car once on a hill to
take pictures and admire the view, we noticed an old, weathered
farmhouse and outbuildings sitting alone in the heather. The setting
made us think of lonely scenes from "Wuthering Heights." Heather grew
around us almost as far as the eye could see, in varying shades of
purple.</TE>
<TE>   Along the coast, steep cliffs rise sharply from the sea and level
out to unspoiled countryside. Small villages of closely clustered
cottages hug the cliffs.</TE>
<TE>   Robin Hood's Bay, or "Bay" as it is known to locals, is nestled in
a cove on the Yorkshire coast. It is one of the most picturesque
villages in the region and is popular with tourists, but the season
was over on the September morning that we arrived, and there were
just a few other visitors.</TE>
<TE>   The stories I had read about it began to take shape in my mind as
we walked past the small homes and shops. I tried to picture how it
might have looked in 1745, when its name was synonymous with
smuggling. Hard to imagine of such a peaceful and innocent-looking
place. Nonetheless, this village once was the headquarters for the
most powerful gang of smugglers on the northeast coast of England,
and many of the townspeople were accomplices. In an era when
smuggling was virtually a national industry, Robin Hood's Bay became
its very heart, chiefly because of its isolation.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, for example, Britain consumed about 4 million pounds
of tea a year, with 3 million pounds of it smuggled in. Residents
despised what they believed to be unjust taxation of goods imported
from the Continent. To them, the solution was simple. Those who
weren't involved in the smuggling operation looked the other way.</TE>
<TE>   Contraband was regularly transferred, usually under cover of
darkness, from ships to small boats, then unloaded on the beach. The
goods were handed off up the hill through tunnels and secret passages
within houses, some say without ever seeing the light of day. The
back of a cupboard in one tiny house might have a trapdoor that
opened into the pub next door.</TE>
<TE>   From the top of the hill the goods were transported across the
moors to waiting customers. The merchants and other recipients were
eager for their tea, brandy, rum, wine, tobacco, spices, perfume and
lace from the Continent and never asked questions, and the villagers
accumulated stashes of illegally earned cash to save for a rainy day.</TE>
<TE>   From our base at the cottage in Glaisdale, we discovered other
area attractions too. The village of Grosmont (pronounced GROW-moat)
was nearby, and it was here that we caught a restored steam train for
an 18-mile trip to Pickering, where we browsed at market day booths
and had lunch at a cafe.</TE>
<TE>   The train provided easy access to scenic walks through the valleys
and surrounding villages. People with backpacks and hiking boots got
on and off at various points. The station at Pickering was a big draw
for photographers; people vied for the best position to take pictures
of the old locomotive and browsed in the gift shop, which contains
photos, paintings and models of the old trains.</TE>
<TE>   Whitby, on the coast, is a charming resort town. We boarded a
double-decker sightseeing bus on the spur of the moment and were glad
we did. The tour offered excellent views of the hilly city as well as
the ruins of 13th century Whitby Abbey. The guide, a local actress,
regaled us with gossip about the town and its people.</TE>
<TE>   We had lunch at Trencher's, a local legend at the harbor, queuing
for half an hour to get a table. The time passed quickly as we
conversed with a friendly English couple ahead of us. When we were
seated I asked for fish and chips, and Ellie ordered prawns. We
learned to ask for descriptions when ordering, however, since the
"prawns," when they arrived, were what we would call monkfish.</TE>
<TE>   Whitby was the home of explorer Capt. James Cook, and it has a
museum in his honor. The region is considered "Capt. Cook Country"
because Cook was born in Marton, was schooled in Great Ayton and did
an apprenticeship in a grocery store in the little fishing village of
Staithes, where he fell in love with the sea and eventually sailed
away. A 70-mile posted tour marks Cook landmarks and museums.</TE>
<TE>   Staithes, a few miles up the coast from Whitby, is a fishing
village. At one time fishing was a way of life for the families who
lived there, with women and children helping to haul in the boats.
The fish were auctioned off from the quay and loaded on teams of
packhorses to be transported across the inhospitable moors to faraway
markets. Later the village became an artists' colony, and today,
although a small fishing fleet remains, it is mainly a tourist
attraction.</TE>
<TE>   When in Yorkshire, a visit must include a sightseeing trip through
villages and across the moors, and the best way to do this is on a
Moorsbus, where someone else does the driving. Tourists are
encouraged to use them. National park officials call the Moorsbus the
"gentle way" to see the moors, less disturbing to the delicate
ecology of the area than hordes of cars. The buses leave from
specified village stops or can be flagged down anywhere in between.
They also provide practical transportation for the locals.</TE>
<TE>   I boarded at the Danby Moors Visitor Centre, a few miles from the
cottage, and left Ellie to enjoy the Sunday Times of London. In
September these buses run only on Sundays, so it is necessary to
check schedules with local officials.</TE>
<TE>   You can ask for a transfer, get off along the way to enjoy
sightseeing in a village that may look interesting and board another
bus later on.</TE>
<TE>   Local people are friendly, and on the bus an elderly woman across
the aisle could see me puzzling over a map I had picked up at the
visitor center.</TE>
<TE>   She leaned over and inquired, "Ye lost on yer mop?"</TE>
<TE>   I told her I was just following our bus route. As soon as I opened
my mouth it was obvious I was American, so she kindly helped me with
Yorkshire pronunciations along the way and pointed out sights. "The
next village is not Chop Gate like it looks, it's 'Chop Yat,' " she
offered. The bus route veers down a steep hill and stops at the
looming ruins of Rievaulx Abbey. I was somewhat surprised to see
crowds and large parking areas full of cars and tourist buses, having
thus far enjoyed fairly tourist-free sights.</TE>
<TE>   Rievaulx Abbey is the remains of a 13th century Cistercian
monastery with graceful, soaring Norman arches. It became the order's
mother church in England and is one of the country's most impressive
sights.</TE>
<TE>   Helmsley is another few miles up the road. I got off the bus
there, explored the village, had tea at a centuries-old hotel on the
square and boarded another bus to complete the circular tour back to
the visitor center.</TE>
<TE>   Another interesting town that we later visited by car was
Thornton-le-Dale. There's a thatch-roofed house here that is said to
be one of the most photographed houses in England. With its neat and
colorful cottage garden and bubbling brook in front, we could see
why.</TE>
<TE>   Although Castle Howard is another fine tourist attraction in
Yorkshire--not far from York and well worth the tour--I had seen it
on a previous visit and chosen other sights. The castle is a
beautiful 18th century palace where the television series "Brideshead
Revisited" was filmed, and they have several rooms devoted to
interesting details relating to the filming.</TE>
<TE>   Most days we would stop in a village after sightseeing, have tea
and scones in the late afternoon and then fix a light supper in the
cottage, taking turns cooking. One evening we tried out the Glaisdale
pub, the Mitre, and had delicious homemade tomato soup served with
fresh bread. The locals sat relaxed at tables, chatting over pints,
their dogs asleep at their feet.</TE>
<TE>   Studying the blackboard listing daily specials, we saw "Stilton
mushrooms" and decided to share an order to see what they were:
sauteed mushrooms in a creamy Stilton cheese sauce--delicious and
well worth our curiosity.</TE>
<TE>   Shepard's Hall Tearoom in nearby Lealholm (LEE-lum) can provide
dinners or snacks. We ate there early one evening and ordered
"starters"--appetizers--instead of dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Toward the end of the week we found A169, which locals call the
"moors road"; it is the most direct route between Whitby and York.
South all the way to Pickering, the view of the moors extends to the
horizon on both sides, bypassing dales and villages, and the feeling
of desolation, and beauty, is real.</TE>
<TE>   We took A169 back to York and the train to London. Although it was
more fun exploring back roads, both ways are worth the experience.</TE>
<TE>   One thing still puzzles me. No one--including a town historian--
seems to know how Robin Hood's Bay was named, but people who live
there seem to agree on one point: It had no connection to Robin Hood.</TE>

<LD>London can easily be one of the most expensive cities in the world to
visit, but it doesn't have to be. For those on a student-style
budget, there are many ways to stretch your funds and still see the
city's tourist sites. Here are three easy ways to cut costs:</LD>
<LD>   * Buy packages for independent travelers offered by six of
London's most popular hostels.</LD>
<LD>   * Download from the Internet instructions for free
"do-it-yourself" walking/public transportation tours.</LD>
<TE>   * Plan your sightseeing around renowned museums and galleries that
are free.</TE>
<TE>   The Youth Hostel Assn. of England and Wales is offering two
special London Explorer packages for independent travelers. Each
package includes accommodations in shared rooms for two, three or
four nights, with breakfast, at your choice of six London youth
hostels.</TE>
<TE>   Although the hostels are used mostly by young travelers, they are
affiliated with the worldwide Hostelling International network and do
not impose age restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   Both packages include a ticket for the Original London Sightseeing
Tour (a five-hour hop-on, hop-off service that operates double-decker
buses along routes linking the city's major sites), plus entrance to
the London Dungeon and a pass for the Tube (subway) system for the
duration of your package.</TE>
<TE>   The City Sights Explorer package also includes a pass for the
London Eye (at 450 feet, the world's highest observation wheel). For
two nights the cost is about $131, three nights is $185 and six
nights is $309.</TE>
<TE>   The London History Explorer version includes a ticket for the
Madame Tussaud Wax Works and another for the London Planetarium. Two
nights is $139, three nights is $193 and six nights is $317.</TE>
<TE>   Reserve through YHA Customer Services at 011-44-1629-592-708 or by
e-mailing a participating hostel. For information on Hostelling
International-American Youth Hostels membership, log onto
www.hiayh.org.</TE>
<TE>   The participating hostels are YHA St. Pancras, near St. Pancras
Tube stop; YHA City of London, near St. Paul's Cathedral; YHA
Hampstead Heath, on the edge of the city near Hampstead Heath Tube
station (this hostel received a "thumbs up" rating from the "Let's
Go: London" guidebook); YHA Holland House (part of this hostel is a
1607 Jacobean mansion), near High St. Kensington Tube station; YHA
Earl's Court, near Earl's Court Tube station; and YHA Rotherhithe, a
modern hostel overlooking the Thames River.</TE>
<TE>   The great news for budget travelers is that you can visit many of
London's top museums and galleries free. (Donations may be suggested,
and there may be charges for tours and special exhibits.) Admission
is free to the British Museum, where you can see the Rosetta Stone,
which made it possible to decipher Egyptian hieroglyphics, and gaze
at the Elgin marbles; the National Gallery, which holds works by
Botticelli, Raphael and Leonardo da Vinci; the National Portrait
Gallery; the Tate Britain and Tate Modern galleries; the Imperial War
Museum; the Natural History Museum; the Science Museum; the Museum of
London; the Victoria and Albert Museum; and the National Maritime
Museum in Greenwich.</TE>
<TE>   When you've tired of museums and galleries, you can find loads of
other free activities in London, from watching colorful characters
speak their minds at Speaker's Corner in Hyde Park to visiting the
Houses of Parliament or watching the changing of the guard at

<DH>The director of 'Copenhagen' didn't think the memory play
could adapt to film. Now it comes to PBS via the BBC.</DH>

<LD>Two brilliant, Nobel Prize physicists, Denmark's Niels Bohr and
Germany's Werner Heisenberg, met in Copenhagen in 1941. The two
colleagues had been as close as father and son and their work opened
the door for the creation of the atomic bomb. But at the time of the
meeting, they were on opposite sides of World War II. Despite their
political differences, Heisenberg made a covert trip to see Bohr at
his house, but the meeting ended a shambles.</LD>
<LD>   Bohr didn't know before the meeting that Heisenberg was heading
the Nazis' atomic research program. According to Heisenberg, Bohr
became upset over this and cut off the meeting. But until this day,
scientists and historians don't know what really happened. Michael
Frayn's Tony award-winning drama, "Copenhagen," was inspired by the
events surrounding that fateful meeting. After its success in London,
on Broadway and in a national tour, "Copenhagen" has reached the
small screen as the third offering in KCET/Hollywood's drama series,
"PBS Hollywood Presents."</LD>
<LD>   Co-produced by KCET/Hollywood and the BBC, the production, which
premieres Sunday, stars Stephen Rea ("The Crying Game") as Bohr,
Francesca Annis ("Reckless") as his wife, Margrethe, and Daniel Craig
("Road to Perdition") as Heisenberg.</LD>
<TE>   Howard Davies, who recently directed the Broadway revival of
"Private Lives," directed and adapted Frayn's memory play.</TE>
<TE>   Frayn knew little about science when he set out to write
"Copenhagen." "But I studied philosophy, and if you study philosophy
you cannot not be interested in quantum mechanics because it has got
so many philosophical implications."</TE>
<TE>   He first learned about Heisenberg's trip to Copenhagen when he
read the book "Heisenberg's War." "As soon as I read it, it seemed to
crystallize a lot of things I had been thinking about over the years
about human motivation, about why people do what we do and why we do
what we do to ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Because it deals with memory and how people remember events
differently, "Copenhagen" unfolds in a "Rashomon" style. "There is a
parallel between theoretical uncertainty as introduced by Heisenberg
in quantum mechanics in the 1920s and uncertainty about human
beings," says Frayn.</TE>
<TE>   With the uncertainty principal, says Frayn, "Heisenberg is saying
however much we improve our techniques we can never know everything
about the behavior of a physical object. There is a theoretical
barrier. And for different reasons, there is a theoretical barrier to
ever knowing everything about human motivation. That is what the play
is about."</TE>
<TE>   Annis found Margrethe to be a welcomed challenge after her usual
portrayals of free-spirited characters. Margrethe is the dutiful wife
and mother, but she has a mind of her own and is not above speaking
out about her distrust of Heisenberg, whom she never liked.</TE>
<TE>   "As an actress I play pretty egotistical people who are just out
there and demanding their own space," she says. "For this part, I
really had to go into myself and think. I really wanted to play the
woman behind the man, who really revered this man and would do
anything to clear the path for him to be creative and original. She
wanted to make that as humanly possible for him."</TE>
<TE>   When Davies initially saw the play in London, he never thought it
would translate into film because it was a memory play that was
devoid of action but filled to the brim with dense dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't until some people approached me from the BBC and said
would I be interested, and I went away and thought about it," he
says. When Davies was told that Frayn would do the adaptation, he
agreed to direct the piece. But Frayn actually had no intention of
adapting his work.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'I don't have a clue how to do it,' " says Davies. "I
walked away feeling I had gotten myself into deeper water than I
thought initially."</TE>
<TE>   Davies says that Frayn is still being attacked in the London press
for making Heisenberg too sympathetic.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people are saying the guy was a Nazi, why is he being an
apologist for him," says Davies. "But I don't think he is. He makes
Heisenberg sympathetic because the man is a man. He is fallible. He
is vain. He's ambitious. But he's not an evil man. He got himself on
the wrong side and either he didn't have the guts or the moral
conviction to actually divorce himself from Nazism."</TE>
<TE>   "PBS Hollywood Presents 'Copenhagen' " can be seen Sunday at 9
p.m. on KCET and KVCR. The network has rated it TV-PG (may be
unsuitable for younger children).</TE>

<LD>Is it Hooray for Hollywood or is it curtains?</LD>
<LD>   Increasingly, it seems that chaos reigns in the entertainment
industry. Top executive Paul Pressler left Walt Disney Co. last week,
the latest in a long line of senior managers to walk out on the
company. Disney's board of directors is putting pressure on Chief
Executive Michael Eisner to put some lift in the company's sagging
earnings. Meanwhile, Vivendi Universal flirted with unloading
Universal Studios, but it got no decent offers and apparently is
resigned to holding on to the movie and television production
business.</LD>
<LD>   A quick glance at the stock market also shows how sickly the
show-biz sector has become. The shares of Disney, AOL Time Warner
Inc. and News Corp.--owner of Fox film studios and television and
cable networks--are all down sharply this year and selling at less
than half their prices of two years ago.</LD>
<TE>   But one company--Viacom Inc.--is holding up better than its
competitors, and its performance underscores an easy-to-overlook
point: This is still a business in which money can be made. It just
has to be managed right.</TE>
<TE>   Viacom owns Paramount Pictures, CBS Television and MTV,
Nickelodeon and other cable networks. Last year, the company posted
$4.6 billion in operating cash flow before taxes and depreciation,
almost 20% of its total revenue--an extraordinarily high level
compared with most industries. Its earnings this year are still
rising, following stringent cost-cutting during the economy's
two-year downturn.</TE>
<TE>   Viacom stock, at $42.48 Friday, barely has declined for 2002,
while the broad market indexes are down 16% to 20%. And Sumner
Redstone, the company's founder, chairman and chief executive, is as
bullish as ever about what lies before him.</TE>
<TE>   "We have as much growth ahead of us," he said last week, "as we
have achieved so far."</TE>
<TE>   Redstone, whose company's headquarters are in New York, was
enjoying one of his frequent stays in a garden suite at the Bel Air
Hotel, expounding on matters including MTV's expansion in China and
future implications of feature films and TV shows being distributed
on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Though weathered at age 78, Redstone is as tough a competitor as
when he started out four decades ago--a lawyer turned theater owner
who argued over every dollar of box office receipts with movie
studios.</TE>
<TE>   Viacom has expanded in the last decade from a company with $2
billion in annual revenue to a giant with about $24 billion this
year. Mergers and acquisitions account for most of the increase. The
onetime syndicator of TV shows, spun off from CBS in 1970, has
gobbled up Paramount, video-rental chain Blockbuster Entertainment
and finally CBS itself two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Its explosive growth has been mirrored throughout the
entertainment industry, as movie companies that were dependent on
U.S. box-office receipts have become vast corporations distributing
films and TV shows around the world over television and cable lines,
as well as in theaters and through home videotapes and now DVDs.</TE>
<TE>   These new distribution outlets have multiplied sources of revenue.
Viacom's cable networks, for example, bring in more than $4 billion a
year, its television network and stations $7 billion and its movie
business around $3 billion. Its products can be sold again and
again--"re-released" in the industry's term, as Viacom is about to do
with classic episodes of the "Star Trek" television series on DVD.</TE>
<TE>   But for all that, entertainment remains a tough business in which
quick reflexes are required. Settling back into a rose-patterned
chair, Redstone told a story about one of his sharpest maneuvers.</TE>
<TE>   It was the mid-1990s, just after Viacom had bought Paramount and
Blockbuster, and the movie studios were selling films to rental
stores at $65 a pop. At that price, Redstone says, "I was going
broke." The high cost meant there were never enough tapes of hit
films in stock because Blockbuster couldn't afford much inventory.
For customers it was "managed dissatisfaction," he says.</TE>
<TE>   So Redstone says he went to the studios with a plan: revenue-
sharing. The studios would sell Blockbuster the rights to the films
at $6 to $8 each. Blockbuster, in turn, would offer customers a huge
selection of tapes and guarantee to keep hit movies in stock. The
studios and stores would share the revenue.</TE>
<TE>   It was a variation on the traditional sharing of the take between
movie studios and theater owners that Redstone had grown up with. "It
worked, and it saved the studios," Redstone declares with no hint of
modesty. (Some question whether Redstone is really the one who came
up with the revenue-sharing idea.)</TE>
<TE>   Today, home-video rentals typically account for 50% of revenue
generated by a motion picture. And international distribution now
brings in more money than domestic exhibition (though it often takes
years for the dollars to show up).</TE>
<TE>   Managing cash flows in Holly- wood, where the average film costs
about $80 million to produce, market and distribute, also is criti-
cal. And Viacom is a star here too. Its Paramount studio pioneered
the concept of bringing in other studios to co-finance movies. "We
are risk averse," Redstone says, "and we make a film for $20 million
less than other studios do."</TE>
<TE>   Global entertainment is an ever-evolving business. Viacom has been
investing to build up the market for MTV and Nickelodeon and other
entertainment properties in Asia, which will have the majority of the
world's 18-to- 35-year-olds in the next 20 years. Meantime, Redstone
is glorying in his status as a global entertain- ment impresario.</TE>
<TE>   "The president of China, Jiang Zemin, traveled 5 1/2 hours to see
me" during a recent trip to Beijing, Redstone recalls. "He called me</TE>
<TE>   a musical ambassador" because</TE>
<TE>   MTV beams Chinese popular music to 400 million homes in that
country and to millions more in other Asian nations and around the
world.</TE>
<TE>   But for all the grand reception of Redstone, Viacom still hasn't
made any money in Asia. And therein lie the promise and the
challenges of today's entertainment industry. The laying out of vast
investments--while waiting years for returns--creates tremendous
volatility.</TE>
<TE>   A year or two of hit films or a surge of TV advertising can make
entertainment companies look golden. However, a few failed films or a
low-rated TV series can make companies look dismal.</TE>
<TE>   The future will be even more complicated. Greater availability of
broadband Internet distribution of entertainment is a certainty in
the next five years, promising to speed the availability of films
through all media instantly. That would mean even greater surges of
cash flow, a development that moguls such as Redstone welcome.</TE>
<TE>   But the Internet also poses a danger: the specter of piracy, which
already has devastated the music industry.</TE>
<TE>   Redstone, for one, doesn't fear it. "We will find a way," he vows,
"to distribute our product legally to customers and to be paid for
it."</TE>
<TE>   In entertainment, as in all businesses, adapting to change is the
real glamour.</TE>

<HD>Rising Costs Put Pressure on Kaiser</HD>
<DH>Insurance: System faces aging membership and increased
competition. The way it meets the challenges may shape the direction
of health care.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON LEE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kaiser Permanente is having one of its brightest financial years
ever, but beneath the rosy numbers lies a harsh reality: The company
is facing a challenge that threatens the survival of the managed-care
model that it pioneered decades ago.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's leading nonprofit HMO and hospital system and its
11,000 doctors are being confronted by the rising costs of treating
its aging membership, while more bare-bones health plans are drawing
away the coveted young and healthy consumers.</LD>
<LD>   Kaiser has long commanded strong consumer loyalty, but many of its
8.3 million members, particularly the 6.3 million in California, have
now grown old with the HMO health-maintenance organization and are
entering prime health-spending years. Kaiser has California's largest
Medicare HMO enrollment, exceeding 620,000 members, and some analysts
estimate that its overall membership may be 10 to 15 years older than
those in other major health plans.</LD>
<TE>   With age comes a greater risk for developing costly, chronic
illness. Kaiser says, for example, that 7.1% of its members have
diabetes. That's almost a full percentage point higher than the
prevalence rate in the United States, according to the American
Diabetes Assn., whose estimate includes people who are not aware they
have the disease.</TE>
<TE>   Outside Kaiser, the pressures may be even greater. As the nation
heads into the third straight year of double-digit health-cost
increases, with no relief in sight, the insurance industry is
devising more plans with skinnier benefits and fatter member
co-payments and deductibles. Employers want them because they
minimize premium increases, and the plans are especially appealing to
young, healthy individuals who don't want to pay higher premiums for
comprehensive coverage they don't think they'll ever use.</TE>
<TE>   These changes will be increasingly visible to millions of
Americans at open enrollments this fall. Many will be offered
so-called consumer-driven plans, which will allow employees to tap
into a savings account to pay for medical services as needed.</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser officials see all this as a direct assault on its
decades-old tradition. The Oakland-based health system has been a
model of managed care, providing a basic full-coverage plan for all
members, with a primary care doctor serving as a gatekeeper to help
control costs.</TE>
<TE>   But like those of other HMOs and health plans, Kaiser's premiums
have soared in the last couple of years. That raises the question of
whether Kaiser can maintain its one-shoe-fits-all approach and its
competitive edge, and avoid segmenting the membership.</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser's outcome could help shape the direction of health care in
California and elsewhere, not to mention the future of HMOs. The
managed-care industry, despite enjoying a run of strong profits
recently, continues to roil under tremendous financial and public
pressure. Just a few days ago, some of the nation's biggest HMOs were
in the limelight again as a federal judge in Florida issued a key
ruling that gave doctors, but not patients, class-action status in a
landmark case accusing HMOs of fraud and denial of care.</TE>
<TE>   Although WellPoint Health Networks Inc., Health Net Inc. and
PacifiCare Health Systems Inc.--the three leading for-profit
managed-care companies in California--were named as defendants in
that case, Kaiser was not. That underscores one advantage of Kaiser's
integrated approach to health care: Because its doctors are salaried
employees of Kaiser, there are no conflicts over payments between
bill payer and provider. (The other major nonprofit health player in
the state, Blue Shield of California, also was not a defendant
because it has reached accommodations with doctors on its own.)</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say that Kaiser has not had its share of criticisms
and lawsuits over finances and patient care. Consumer advocates have
accused Kaiser of practicing assembly-line medicine, and the HMO is
trying to resolve a long-running complaint of alleged patient-care
lapses that led to a $1.1-million fine from regulators.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, regulators and others say Kaiser has established itself
as a leader in preventive care. And many still regard Kaiser, with
its large working-class membership and social mission, as a strong
countervailing force to giant investor-owned insurance companies.</TE>
<TE>   "In those areas like smoking cessation, Kaiser is at the vanguard
in efforts to keep people healthy," said Daniel Zingale, director of
the California Department of Managed Health Care, which regulates
HMOs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shift Is Beginning</TE>
<TE>   In a recent memo to the staff, George Halvorson, Kaiser's new
chief executive, laid out the dilemma this way: "Those shifts [in the
marketplace] will cause many of our healthiest members to leave us
for lower-cost, lower-benefit plans. At the same time, employers will
save money if their sicker patients voluntarily migrate to us."</TE>
<TE>   Halvorson said he already sees signs of this happening, although
he reckons that these shifts won't be felt for a couple of years.</TE>
<TE>   He said Kaiser will be offering more-flexible benefit designs,
with slightly higher deductibles and co-payments, which will cost
users of medical services and drugs more out of pocket. This year,
Kaiser added a hospital co-payment and set an annual cap on Medicare
drug benefits.</TE>
<TE>   But Halvorson and other members of Kaiser's board don't want to go
too far in that direction. Nor do they think national expansion or
big volume growth will be the answer. Although its membership in the
last year is up about 200,000, in recent years Kaiser has pulled out
of New England, Texas and some other states.</TE>
<TE>   Halvorson is looking instead to get much more out of Kaiser's
uniquely large integrated health system. Although there are a few
others like Kaiser in the nation, none comes close to matching its
size--with annual revenue of about $20 billion, 30 hospitals--mostly
in California--and a staff of 126,000 in nine states, including
Hawaii, Colorado and Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   Its huge size has made it harder to coordinate care and
communicate with patients. But Kaiser is putting the finishing
touches on a $1-billion automated medical records system that will
have every member's health history. And Halvorson is counting on
making significant advances in developing proven protocols to treat
large groups of patients with chronic conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "We're competing against an inefficient, splintered and somewhat
disorganized health-care system, so we start with an advantage," said
Halvorson, 55, who was recruited this spring from HealthPartners, a
nonprofit HMO in Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   While other insurers are battling with hospitals and doctors over
rates, Kaiser doesn't have those obstacles and costs. Halvorson
merely strides down the hall if he wants to chat with his counterpart
at the Permanente Medical Group, Dr. Jay Crosson.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Care-Cost Squeeze</TE>
<TE>   Even so, analysts and stakeholders say the Kaiser team faces
daunting challenges. Managed care continues to come under attack from
consumer advocates. Big employers, knowing Kaiser's inherent
advantages over other insurers, are expecting more savings from
Kaiser--and hence, smaller premium increases.</TE>
<TE>   "Can Kaiser effectively treat a chronically ill care population as
opposed to getting rid of the population by cleverly underwriting
around it?" asked Peter Boland, a health-care analyst and consultant
in Berkeley. And even if Kaiser can, will it be enough? "They don't
know," Boland said of Kaiser's leadership. "But unless they take a
chance and roll the dice, they know they won't survive."</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, HMO enrollment has been declining in the last couple of
years, and part of that may be a reflection of the market shifts
Kaiser is worried about.</TE>
<TE>   Brokers say enrollment in cheaper, bare-bones coverage is rising.
And increasingly, large employers are offering consumer-driven health
plans in which an employer typically contributes a set amount for a
worker's medical needs and allows unused funds to roll over to the
next year.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's going to appeal to younger people and those who
don't expect to use a lot of health-care services," said John
Cammidge, executive director of human resources at Stanford
University, which is making such a plan available next year to its
10,000 employees. He estimated that 5% to 10% will sign up for it.
Like most big employers, Stanford also offers Kaiser.</TE>
<TE>   It's unlikely that large numbers of Kaiser members will defect to
one of these new plans any time soon. With big enrollments at major
employers such as pension fund CalPERS, Kaiser's retention rate is
high. Still, it needs new young members to balance its aging
membership.</TE>
<TE>   The average tenure of Kaiser's 3.1 million members in Southern
California is 17 years, and many have been with the HMO much longer.</TE>
<TE>   Albert and Patricia Corey of Marina del Rey joined Kaiser
Permanente in 1971, and when they turned 65 a few years ago, they
stayed with Kaiser by enrolling in its Medicare-Plus Choice plan.
Albert Corey is taking medication to control high cholesterol and
blood pressure. His wife has had surgery for bladder cancer, and her
chronic conditions include diabetes and arthritis.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever we have is coming down to age," said Patricia Corey, who
is 70.</TE>
<TE>   The Coreys are among the roughly 950,000 Kaiser members, of 11.5%,
who have one or more of five chronic conditions--asthma, depression,
diabetes, heart failure and coronary artery disease.</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser doctors say it's hard to determine whether that's a higher
percentage than in the general population or their competitors.
Measurement techniques vary, and many other health insurers haven't
collected such statistics on their members.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Diabetes Program</TE>
<TE>   At Kaiser's sprawling Woodland Hills campus, Dr. Frederick Ziel is
leading one of Kaiser's regional efforts to care for patients with
diabetes. One of the toughest challenges, he said, was identifying
the 6,500 members who have diabetes in his area of the West San
Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those patients are seen by Kaiser doctors at offices in
other locations. But through a central registry, Ziel can track their
conditions, treatments, and whether they are getting needed tests.
Ziel and other medical staff also can see how individual clinics--and
doctors--compare on these measures. Screening reminders are sent to
patients and doctors.</TE>
<TE>   Ziel said the goal of the screenings is to spot trouble early and
take aggressive action through medication, diet and other forms of
intervention. His computer shows some things are working: The annual
retinal screening rate is in the 70% range, among the highest in the
nation.</TE>
<TE>   And how much are these programs saving Kaiser through reduced
spending for complications and hospitalization?</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Paul Wallace, who heads Kaiser's Care Management Institute,
which supports local programs such as the one in the Valley, said he
doesn't know. But, he said, "Our obligation is to make sure we're
getting the best possible outcomes for the money spent."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Proof of Care Results</TE>
<TE>   Proof of that is exactly what many employers are demanding. Allen
Feezor, health benefits administrator for CalPERS, which has about
400,000 Kaiser members, has little doubt that Kaiser is tops in
disease management. But when it came to rate negotiations this
spring, he said, Kaiser could not justify why it should get a 23%
premium increase.</TE>
<TE>   "The really frustrating thing was that the documentation of their
trend costs have been rather abysmal," said Feezor, adding that he
wants to see care outcomes for his membership.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. David Lawrence, Kaiser's chief executive until April, said,
"CalPERS has been looking under the hood with us for years."</TE>
<TE>   Their frustration, he said, was like that of every employer faced
with the rate of medical cost increases running several times higher
than the rate of inflation.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence led Kaiser through a disastrous period in 1997 and 1998,
when it lost more than $500 million, largely because it took on too
many new members and miscalculated the costs of contracting services
to outside providers. Kaiser has recovered nicely since then,
reporting net income of $458 million in the first six months of this
year, a solid 4% margin of revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Zuckerman, who follows Kaiser for Standard &amp; Poor's, which
has a favorable A rating on Kaiser bonds, said the health-care system
is well-positioned but not as a low-price leader, as it has been in
the past. "I think their challenge is to compete on quality outcomes
rather than low cost, to show that their model is better than
others."</TE>

<LD>"Many Southland Workers Fall in Gap Between Income, Rents" [Sept. 19]
bemoaned the fact that minimum-wage earners are unable to afford a
$1,088-per-month "low-end" apartment in Los Angeles County.</LD>
<LD>   Oddly enough, The Times chose to profile a worker who was able to
find an acceptable apartment for $325 and who donates more than 40%
of his gross income every month to relatives in Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   If there are so many minimum-wage workers supporting families in
this state, why couldn't The Times find one?</LD>
<TE>   More important, the rent information The Times relied on
exclusively was gathered from investment-grade complexes of 100 units
or more, an odd definition indeed for the housing market's "low end."</TE>

<TE>   What a sad commentary on the state of our nation. Have we all
become so brainwashed by the myth of capitalism's trickle-down
rewards that we accept the sort of conditions that afflict what is
clearly an ever-growing segment of the population?</TE>
<TE>   Good, hard-working people such as Armando Mantilla, and the many
millions just like him--continue to live every day just a step away
from homelessness. It's shameful.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I was feeling very sorry for Mantilla, who couldn't "afford a
standard two-bedroom apartment" because the minimum wage he earns
won't allow it.</TE>
<TE>   And then, buried in one line on page C12 is the real explanation
of why he can't afford to eat or pay rent--he sends $575 of his
$1,420 monthly paycheck to relatives in Mexico, "forcing" a local
church to feed the Mantilla family.</TE>
<TE>   Whoa! And just who is "forcing" him to send more than a third of
what he makes to relatives in Mexico? He's choosing poverty.</TE>

<TE>   Since when do our wages and our landlords' rents have to subsidize
the lives of people who live in other countries? Mantilla makes more
than enough to enjoy a better apartment and feed his own family. If
he wants to support family in Mexico, that's his choice, but don't
blame our wages and rents.</TE>

<HD>NASD Opposition Hurts Investor Confidence</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a former NASD securities arbitrator who resigned because the
National Assn. of Securities Dealers refused to comply with
California's new rules regarding disclosure of conflicts by their
arbitrators, I was saddened to read that the NASD continues to refuse
to comply with the rules ["Arbitration Halt Frustrates Investors,"
Sept. 18].</LD>
<LD>   Even SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt seems to have no control over the
NASD, which makes one wonder what really is going on on Wall Street.</LD>
<LD>   The NASD contends that the new California law requiring disclosure
of conflicts of interests is too cumbersome and costly. In my
opinion, that contention is simply a smoke screen.</LD>
<TE>   What the NASD is afraid of is that if it is required to follow the
new disclosure rules, it will have a new set of arbitrators who may
not be so pro-industry as the present setup. The NASD may have to
deal with more female, more younger and more non-white arbitrators.</TE>
<TE>   In my years as an arbitrator, the vast majority of my fellow
arbitrators, while very ethical, were mostly retired, white and male.
They were paid little and given no paid training, so what did one
expect. The NASD simply does not want to give up control of the
arbitration proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   I find it amazing in this time of lack of confidence in the stock
market that instead of promoting full disclosure by their arbitrators
of any conflicts, the NASD is promoting less disclosure. Instead of
trying to increase confidence in the stock market, the NASD is going
in the opposite direction.</TE>

<HD>Estimate of Gross State Product May Be Too Low</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp. estimated that
gross state product of California was $1.309 trillion in 2001,
slightly less than France's gross domestic product of $1.310
trillion, as estimated by the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development ["California Economy Already Recovering," Sept. 16].</LD>
<LD>   This small difference, a revision of data that initially put
California ahead of France, dropped California from fifth to sixth in
the rankings of the world's leading economies.</LD>
<LD>   The organization's estimate of the gross state product in 2001
seems too low. I say "seems" because the official number will not be
released by the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis
until June 2003.</LD>
<TE>   The most recent official number is $1.344 trillion for 2000.</TE>
<TE>   To estimate the gross state product for a year, we assume that it
grew by the same amount as total state personal income in that year.
Personal income is a key component of gross state product,
representing about 80%, and statistics on total state personal income
are considerably more current. This approximation has proved to be
very good in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Three independent sources estimate personal income in California
increased in 2001. The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates it
increased 3.1%, the California Department of Finance estimates it was
up 1.8% and the UCLA Anderson Forecast has it up 2%.</TE>
<TE>   Accordingly, we are very confident that California still ranks
fifth in 2001.</TE>

<LD>I read with interest your article regarding the Hughes-EchoStar

<LD>   The focus of the management team of Hughes and its operating
businesses is to successfully complete the merger with EchoStar and
to operate our company as efficiently and competitively as we can.</LD>
<LD>   DirecTV President Roxanne Austin has denied statements in your
article, attributed to "sources," that she has indicated to her top
leadership team that a DirecTV management buyout is a possibility if
the merger is not approved.</LD>
<TE>   Finally, I should point out that the future of Hughes and its
subsidiaries, including DirecTV, is a matter that always will be
determined by the leaders of General Motors and Hughes. Any
implication in the press that the leaders of any Hughes operating
company are working on plans for an independent future are just plain
false.</TE>

<HD>For Some Estates, Probate May Be a Better Choice Than a
Trust</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: My 86-year-old father has an estate that I believe will be
worth more than $1 million when he dies. This includes two homes that
are paid for and various bank accounts, stocks, bonds and other
miscellaneous accounts. He has a will, but he refuses to set up a
trust that could help his estate avoid probate, which is a lengthy
and costly process here in California. He says his heirs will be
"just fine" if his estate goes through probate and that it won't
"cost us in taxes." I'm concerned he's making a mess that will cause
delays and cost us all financially.</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Your dad may be confused about what probate is. Or he may
know exactly what he's doing.</LD>
<LD>   Probate is the court process that typically follows a death.
Property is identified and appraised, creditors are paid and assets
are distributed to heirs. If any estate taxes are owed, they are paid
as well. The estate tax system, however, is separate from the probate
system--something that often confuses people who think they have
taken care of one when their plans address only the other.</LD>
<TE>   In some states, probate is a relatively easy and inexpensive
procedure. In other states, including California and New York,
probate is long and expensive, costing as much as 3% to 4% of the
gross estate. (The gross estate is the total of everything your dad
owns, not counting anything he may owe.)</TE>
<TE>   These costs aren't taxes. They're mostly attorneys' fees.</TE>
<TE>   That's why revocable living trusts, which help estates avoid
probate, are almost a no-brainer if you live in a state in which
probate is expensive. Living trusts typically cost $2,000 to $5,000
to set up, but they would help your father's estate avoid $30,000 or
more in probate fees when he dies. That would be money that could be
going to his heirs.</TE>
<TE>   Some people worry about the hassles of setting up a trust. When it
comes to living trusts, however, the hassles are relatively small.
Once the trust is created and his assets are transferred into it,
there is little additional paperwork and he doesn't have to file a
separate tax return for the trust.</TE>
<TE>   And because the trust is revocable, your father wouldn't be giving
up any control. He can do whatever he wants with the property until
his death.</TE>
<TE>   Your father might not understand all that. Or he might actually
want his estate to drag through the probate system.</TE>
<TE>   Probate, after all, is a public process, as it takes place in
court. People who value their privacy usually want to avoid that
scrutiny, but your dad may prefer court supervision if he isn't
certain his estate will be divided the way he wants.</TE>
<TE>   Living trusts are much more private. The trust usually names
someone to oversee the distribution of the estate, and an unethical
person in that post can create quite a bit of havoc. Estates that go
through probate can have similar problems, but at least in theory
there's a judge looking over the executor's shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Also, if your father is involved in numerous lawsuits, has a
failing business or owes a lot of money, probate might be preferable,
because probate has mechanisms that can resolve such issues,
sometimes more speedily than when a living trust is used.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, your dad just might not care that probate will mean less
money for his heirs if he thinks he's already leaving you enough.
Some people would rather not pay for probate avoidance when it's
their survivors, rather than themselves, who will benefit.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Life Insurance Benefits May Be Subject to Taxes</TE>
<TE>   Q: I was very surprised to read in your column recently that life
insurance policies are part of an estate and taxable. I always have
been told that this is "free money" and not taxable. In fact, I just
read that is how wealthy people can leave money to their heirs and
avoid paying taxes on the funds.</TE>
<TE>   A: It's true that you typically don't have to pay income taxes
when you're the beneficiary and get the proceeds from a life
insurance policy. If you're the one who bought the policy, however,
estate taxes may apply.</TE>
<TE>   The wealthy know (or have been told by their advisors) that life
insurance proceeds will be included in their estates if they're named
as the owner of the policies. To avoid estate taxes, they may
transfer their policy to another person or decide to create an
irrevocable life insurance trust that will "own" the policy.</TE>
<TE>   Whether you should consider such maneuvers depends on your
individual financial and estate situation.</TE>
<TE>   That brings us back to the original advice, which is to consult a
qualified estate-planning attorney if your estate, including life
insurance, is likely to exceed $1 million.</TE>

<HD>Alternative Tax Can Be a Big Blow to Many</HD>

<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ron Speltz, a phone repairman in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, is finding out
that you don't have to be a rich person to pay taxes like one.</LD>
<LD>   Speltz, a 35-year-old father of three, is facing bankruptcy
because of taxes he owes on unrealized gains from stock options. The
culprit? The alternative minimum tax, an obscure federal levy
originally intended to ensure that rich people paid at least some
income tax, but which is increasingly ensnaring middle-income
Americans.</LD>
<LD>   "Here I stand with this huge debt that is financially destroying
our family and I have absolutely nothing to show for it," Speltz
said.</LD>
<TE>   He's not alone. By 2010, the AMT is expected to affect 35 million
Americans--including an increasing number of Californians--unless the
tax code is changed, according to a study released last month by the
Tax Policy Center. That's up from an estimated 1.8 million last year.</TE>
<TE>   Although Speltz's problem with the AMT is more dramatic than most,
experts agree that it can increase a tax bill in ways that are
difficult to explain or justify.</TE>
<TE>   "The AMT operates unfairly on most of the people who get pulled
into it today," said National Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson, the
government official who represents taxpayers' interests in
Washington. "It may have made sense when it was designed in 1969, but
it doesn't make any sense today," Olson said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Budget Deficit Woes</TE>
<TE>   This year, lawmakers appeared ready to revamp the AMT, which
brought in $8.9 billion in 2000. But the burgeoning federal budget
deficit is making it difficult to fix or eliminate the AMT without
replacing the revenue that would be lost.</TE>
<TE>   The AMT is the product of Vietnam War-era outrage over a report
that 155 high-income Americans--they each earned the equivalent of
about $1.1 million in today's dollars--didn't pay income tax. To
prevent the wealthy from sheltering all of their income from
taxation, Congress created the AMT--a parallel tax system that
operates side-by-side with the ordinary federal income tax.</TE>
<TE>   Under the AMT, marginal tax rates are lower, but fewer deductions
are allowed. For instance, deductions for state income taxes, medical
expenses and personal exemptions--the tax deductions you get for
yourself and other dependents--are eliminated under the AMT.</TE>
<TE>   In the last several years, a number of factors have conspired to
turn the alternative tax into a nightmare for many in the middle
class.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, the AMT exemption amount--the equivalent of
the normal tax code's standard deduction--isn't indexed for
inflation. At its current level of $49,000 for married filers and
$33,750 for single filers--including single parents--it's not much
higher than it was 30 years ago. As a result, the alternative tax can
hit a single mom earning $45,000 a year, Olson said.</TE>
<TE>   Even the meager boost in the AMT exemption included in the 2001
tax-cut legislation expires in 2004. That legislation also
contributed to the problem by cutting ordinary tax rates while
leaving AMT rates unchanged, and is a major reason the number of
Americans paying the alternative tax is expected to soar.</TE>
<TE>   To make matters worse, the alternative minimum tax doesn't even
fulfill its original mission. The IRS estimates that thousands of
wealthy Americans still manage to pay no income tax, for reasons
ranging from sheltering money in offshore accounts to reporting large
amounts of tax-free income from municipal bonds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AMT Triggers</TE>
<TE>   What triggers the AMT? Individuals who cut their tax bill too much
can be dragged in--for instance, when certain deductions and tax
credits reduce an individual's tax bill below about 24% of income.
Deducting state taxes can trigger the AMT for people living in
high-tax states such as California. Claiming deductions for high
medical expenses or having a large number of children also can put a
taxpayer at risk. People with substantial capital gains income can
get hit, too, because capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.</TE>
<TE>   Stock options also are a big problem. Roughly 15 million Americans
receive incentive stock options--rights to buy a company's shares at
a set price in the future--as part of their pay packages. If a worker
exercises stock options--buys his or her company's stock--and doesn't
sell the shares, no income tax is due even if the shares rise in
value, giving the worker a paper profit.</TE>
<TE>   But if the paper profit is big enough, the worker may be subject
to the alternative tax, which is levied on the difference between the
exercise price of the options--what the worker actually paid for the
stock when exercising the options--and what the stock was selling for
in the open market on the day the options were exercised.</TE>
<TE>   Stock options were a part of Ron Speltz's annual pay. Hoping to
build a home in 1999, Speltz exercised his options. But he says he
held on to the shares on the advice of a tax expert, who said Speltz
would save money by holding the shares for a year so his profit on
the options would be taxed at lower long-term capital gains rates.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, the stock market tanked and his company's stock was
worth a fraction of what it was worth when he exercised his options.
And Speltz was shocked to learn that, thanks to the AMT, he owes
$262,000 in tax on shares that are now worth $1,120.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to pay the tax bill have been fruitless, and Speltz has
been unable to reach a compromise with the IRS to pay less than what
he owes. In the meantime, his wife has gone back to work and they're
struggling to keep their home.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no problem paying taxes on gains I actually made," he
said. "But I have received nothing."</TE>
<TE>   Brian Morin of Crown Point, Ind., is in similar straits. The
former tech company executive held on to his company's stock after
exercising options, saying he never knew about the AMT. He was able
to realize an $80,000 profit when he finally sold the stock, but his
tax hit was nearly four times higher--roughly $300,000.</TE>
<TE>   "We had no way to fathom how it was possible that we could be
taxed $300,000 on $80,000 in gains," said Morin. "I don't have any
other capital assets. I don't even have a car. We just have no hope
of ever being able to pay this."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hoping for Reform</TE>
<TE>   Morin and Speltz said they are hopeful that the AMT will be
reformed. Half a dozen bills were introduced in Congress last summer
as lawmakers tried to come up with a more lasting solution. But none
is making progress, in part because of the growth of the federal
deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Reforming the AMT is difficult for another reason: Lawmakers want
to preserve the intent of the law--to ensure that the wealthy don't
escape the income tax entirely. In her annual report to Congress,
Taxpayer Advocate Olson provided suggestions for AMT reform,
including outright repeal and indexing the AMT exemption thresholds
for inflation--a move that would cut in half the number of people
subject to the tax.</TE>
<TE>   She admits that fixing the AMT won't be easy.</TE>
<TE>   "The current system not only pulls in unintended targets, it
doesn't capture all the intended taxpayers," Olson said. "I have been
trying to think about how you would structure a replacement system,
and I have to admit I haven't gotten very far. It is a very difficult
issue."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Potential AMT Triggers</TE>
<TE>   The alternative minimum tax is figured using slightly lower rates
than the federal income tax that most Americans are familiar with.
But it takes away deductions and credits that taxpayers might
otherwise claim. Theoretically, every taxpayer is supposed to figure
their tax twice--once under the ordinary system, once using the
AMT--and pay whichever is higher.</TE>
<TE>   Here are some of the deductions and sources of income that can
trigger the AMT:</TE>
<TE>   * Long-term capital gains</TE>
<TE>   * Paper profits from incentive stock options</TE>
<TE>   * State income tax and property tax deductions</TE>
<TE>   * Home equity interest deductions</TE>
<TE>   * Unreimbursed business expenses</TE>
<TE>   * Accelerated depreciation write-offs</TE>
<TE>   * High medical and dental deductions</TE>
<TE>   * Tax-exempt income from private activity bonds</TE>
<TE>   * A large number of personal exemption credits--in other words,
having a big family</TE>
<TE>   In general, taxpayers who have such deductions amounting to more
than $49,000 for married filers or $35,750 for singles--regardless of
income--may risk triggering the AMT. Also, income from capital gains
or paper profits from stock options can trigger the tax. If possible,
postponing deductions for a year or accelerating income can help, but
anyone faced with the AMT should seek advice from a tax professional.</TE>

<HD>Credibility Gap Still a Challenge for Analysts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Clark Westmont, a semiconductor-industry analyst for brokerage
Salomon Smith Barney, decided last week that Irvine-based chip maker
Broadcom Corp. was highly unlikely to earn 29 cents a share in 2003,
which had been Westmont's estimate.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, the analyst's view of Broadcom's profit outlook became
far darker than those of the two dozen other brokerage researchers
who follow the company. Westmont told clients Wednesday that he now
expects Broadcom to earn just 3 cents a share next year.</LD>
<LD>   At a time when the credibility of Wall Street analysts has been
severely undermined by a torrent of conflict-of-interest allegations,
investors' reaction to Westmont's slashed profit estimate showed the
power that analysts still have over share prices: Broadcom stock
plunged $2.04, or 15%, to $11.86 on Thursday, the lowest price since
the shares began trading in 1998.</LD>
<TE>   The price continued to slide Friday, ending at $10.95 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Westmont didn't lower his official recommendation on Broadcom.
He kept his rating at "2S," which under Salomon's grading system
means he expects the stock to perform "in line" with others in its
industry over the next 12 to 18 months. That's analogous to a "hold"
rating at other brokerages.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the "S" warns that Westmont considers the stock
to be speculative, meaning it has "exceptionally low predictability
of financial results and highest risk and volatility," Salomon says.</TE>
<TE>   Confused? This is the new, and supposedly improving, world of
analyst recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   By Friday, some of Westmont's clients may well have been asking a
question that has been repeatedly asked of analysts since the bear
market began 30 months ago: Why didn't he just say "sell"?</TE>
<TE>   An investor who got out of Broadcom at Wednesday's closing price
of $13.90 a share left with 27% more money than someone who mulled
over Westmont's report, then sold on Friday at $10.95.</TE>
<TE>   Westmont, who has been covering the chip industry for eight years,
says he didn't cut his rating on Broadcom to "3," or
"underperform"--the closest Salomon's grading system gets to
"sell"--because by his estimation Broadcom still is a stock worth
keeping long term.</TE>
<TE>   He may well be shown to be right about that. If so, he'll have
plenty of company: Of 25 analysts who follow Broadcom, 14 now rate
the stock "buy" or "strong buy," and 11 rate it "hold" or the
equivalent, according to data-tracker Thomson First Call in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   None of the analysts recommends selling Broadcom at this point,
despite--or perhaps, because of--the record-low share price. Since it
peaked at about $270 in August 2000, the stock has lost more than 95%
of its value.</TE>
<TE>   Investors who are angry with brokerage analysts and their
recommendations probably have more issues with the past than with the
present. In retrospect, the best time to have sold Broadcom was in or
around August 2000. But few, if any, analysts wanted to pull the plug
then, despite the stock's stratospheric valuations.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts' reluctance to say "sell" during the technology-stock
mania of 1998 to 2000 is one basis for the numerous investigations
state and national regulators have launched into Wall Street's
practices.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators' investigations have turned up plenty of evidence
suggesting that some analysts stayed optimistic about stocks not
because they believed in the companies, but mainly to keep their
investment bankers happy.</TE>
<TE>   If a brokerage's bankers were trying to lure fee-rich underwriting
business from a particular company, it helped if the analyst
following the company maintained a bullish rating on the stock.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation by New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer into
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s practices, which resulted in Merrill agreeing
in May to pay a $100 million fine, turned up internal e-mails showing
some of the brokerage's analysts privately slamming Internet stocks
in 2000 and 2001 while continuing to advise the public to buy them.</TE>
<TE>   A similar pattern occurred at brokerage CS First Boston, according
to Massachusetts regulators, who have asked Spitzer to consider
bringing criminal charges against the company.</TE>
<TE>   Analyst practices at Salomon Smith Barney, meanwhile, are under
investigation by Spitzer's office and by the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the National Assn. of Securities Dealers.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street, fearing for its livelihood if not its image, has
taken a number of steps to change its ways since spring. Major
brokerages have pledged that analysts won't report directly to
investment banking departments, and that analysts' compensation won't
be linked directly to specific banking work received from a client
company.</TE>
<TE>   But that may not be enough. Last week, sources told The Times that
Salomon and other major firms are trying to reach an overall
settlement of the various probes by agreeing to build a much more
substantial wall between analysts and bankers, to reduce the
potential for bankers to influence analysts' opinions of stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Exactly how that wall would be strengthened isn't yet clear. But
the SEC and other regulators know that individual and institutional
investors alike are disgusted by the revelations of tainted stock
touts, and that the only chance brokerages have to rebuild confidence
in their advice is to present a meaningful plan for reform.</TE>
<TE>   For many brokerage clients, one element of reform already visible
is in stock rating systems. Regulators in the spring ordered Wall
Street to be clearer in its stock recommendations and to include with
every research report much more disclosure about how ratings work and
whether a firm faces any potential conflicts of interest in following
a particular stock.</TE>
<TE>   At Salomon Smith Barney, that resulted in a change from a
five-level rating system to a three-level system: a 1 rating for
"outperform," indicating that the stock, over 12 to 18 months, is
expected to perform better than others in its industry that are
followed by the analyst; a 2 rating for "in line," meaning the stock
should perform in line with its peers; and a 3 rating for
"underperform," meaning the performance is expected to be worse than
the average peer stock.</TE>
<TE>   Salomon also includes letter ratings indicating whether a stock is
considered low risk, medium risk, high risk or speculative.</TE>
<TE>   Some brokerages, such as Prudential Securities, have opted for
simpler ratings. Prudential labels stocks either buy, hold or sell.</TE>
<TE>   Salomon and other firms with more convoluted grading systems have
argued that fairly rating stocks isn't always as simple as black,
white and one shade of gray.</TE>
<TE>   Here's how Salomon's Westmont explains his decision to keep
Broadcom rated a 2, even while reducing his earnings estimate for
2003 by 90%: The expected earnings shortfall reflects Westmont's
belief that demand for Broadcom's chips will slow because of weaker
sales of devices such as set-top cable TV boxes. Broadcom is big
supplier of chips to the cable and telecommunications industries.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Westmont said he expects Broadcom--which isn't a
banking client of Salomon--to be a survivor of the horrendous
shakeout still going on in the telecom sector. He said the company
has relatively low debt, and expects that Broadcom's sales will
continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace. He forecasts sales of $1.1
billion this year and $1.3 billion in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   In the absence of material earnings per share in 2003, Westmont
said, the only logical way to judge the value of Broadcom's shares is
to compare the price with estimated sales per share. And by that
measure, he said, the stock already is cheaper than shares of many of
its peers. To Westmont, that makes Broadcom an "in line" performer by
Salomon's official terminology--a "hold" in other brokerages'
parlance.</TE>
<TE>   Is Wall Street still far too optimistic on stocks like Broadcom?
Thomson First Call's tally of 25,000 stock recommendations shows 93%
now are "buys" or "holds." Just 7% are "sells." Still, the "sells"
are up from 2% of the total a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   The real test of analysts' objectivity, however, won't come in the
midst of a bear market. It will be during the next bull market, when
everyone senses that stock valuations have become overextended, but
saying so wins no friends.</TE>

<LD>Three to Plead Guilty in Homestore Probe</LD>
<LD>   Three former executives of Homestore Inc. will plead guilty to
criminal charges and pay $4.6 million to settle civil charges in
connection with an alleged phony-revenue scheme.</LD>
<LD>   The cases against the former executives of the Westlake
Village-based Internet company were announced by U.S. Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft, who said the Homestore investigation was an example of the
Bush administration's pledge to crack down on corporate corruption.</LD>
<TE>   In a complaint filed in federal court in Los Angeles against the
three former executives, prosecutors allege that a "major media
company," identified by federal sources as AOL Time Warner Inc.'s
America Online unit, was involved in "round-trip" financial
transactions in 2001 that allowed Homestore to inflate its financial
results by booking its own money as advertising revenue.</TE>
<TE>   AOL said its deal with Homestore "was appropriate."</TE>

<TE>   Fed Lets Rate Stand, but Two Members Oppose</TE>
<TE>   Federal Reserve policymakers acknowledged that the nation's
economic recovery remained wobbly and could be damaged by war with
Iraq. But with two members opposed, they voted to leave their
signal-sending interest rate unchanged for a 10th straight month.</TE>
<TE>   Policymakers left the so-called federal funds rate, the interest
that banks charge each other for overnight loans, at a four-decade
low of 1.75%, where it has been since December.</TE>
<TE>   But the central bank, for the first time, revealed immediately
after the vote that there had been disagreement about the rate
decision. It said that of the 12-member board, Fed Gov. Edward M.
Gramlich and Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert D. McTeer
Jr. wanted to lower rates.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts interpreted the disclosure as a sign that the Fed
was preparing for further cuts--perhaps significant ones--if the
economy weakens.</TE>

<TE>   Disney's Pressler Named Chief Executive of Gap</TE>
<TE>   Paul Pressler, the head of Walt Disney Co.'s $6-billion theme-park
division, was named to succeed retiring Gap Inc. Chief Executive
Millard "Mickey" Drexler, who led the retailer for two decades.</TE>
<TE>   Pressler, 46, who made his name in consumer products and formerly
oversaw Disney Stores, is inheriting a tough job. San Francisco-based
Gap has suffered through two years of fashion and financial missteps.
The retailer has more than 4,200 Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy
stores worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   The departure of Pressler dealt an unexpected blow to Disney chief
Michael Eisner's efforts to turn around the ailing entertainment
giant. Pressler was viewed by some as a potential successor to Eisner
and his leaving is likely to revive criticism from investors that the
CEO has not mapped out a clear succession plan.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Peregrine Files for Bankruptcy Protection</TE>
<TE>   Software maker Peregrine Systems Inc. filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection and sued its auditor, Arthur Andersen, accusing
it of fraud, negligence and failure in its performance of its duties.
Peregrine is seeking $1 billion in damages.</TE>
<TE>   In its bankruptcy filing, the company disclosed that it had
received a subpoena from the Justice Department. Alleged financial
misdeeds at Peregrine, whose chairman is San Diego Padres owner John
J. Moores, already are under investigation by the Securities and
Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Peregrine executives say the blame lies with Andersen, because the
auditor failed to alert the board of directors when Peregrine
management changed its accounting methods--changes that could have
raised red flags about what executives were doing. Peregrine fired
Andersen in April.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen denied the accusations.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing Swaps Misled, Documents Show</TE>
<TE>   E-mails and other documents released by congressional
investigators showed that executives at Global Crossing Ltd. misled
their bankers as well as investors in undertaking controversial swaps
of capacity on their telecommunications networks to boost revenue and
meet financial forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   The disclosure could give lawmakers important ammunition as a
House Energy and Commerce subcommittee prepares to grill Global
Crossing founder and Chairman Gary Winnick this week. Global Crossing
filed for bankruptcy protection in January.</TE>
<TE>   The e-mails point to a compelling motive for the firm's obsession
with meeting quarterly projections and completing last-minute
capacity swaps to do so.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Billionaire Seeks to Purchase Dole Food</TE>
<TE>   Billionaire David H. Murdock announced his intentions to buy Dole
Food Co. in a transaction valued at about $2.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Murdock, company chairman, owns about 24% of the nation's largest
fresh-produce business. He offered to buy remaining shares for $29.50
apiece and assume about $1 billion of debt.</TE>
<TE>   But several shareholders said the deal was not as good as it could
be, causing speculation that Murdock might have to raise his bid.</TE>
<TE>   Murdock, 79, has a history of buying companies when market
conditions are favorable. The most recent transaction was taking real
estate company Castle &amp; Cooke Inc. private two years ago.</TE>

<TE>   ESPN to Launch Spanish Sports Channel in 2003</TE>
<TE>   ESPN said it would launch , ESPN Deportes (ESPN Sports), a 24-hour
Spanish-language sports channel, next year.</TE>
<TE>   The move would tap into one of television's fastest-growing
markets: the 10.7 million Latino households in the U.S., a potential
viewing audience of more than 35 million.</TE>
<TE>   But it also puts ESPN in competition with Spanish-language
networks that use sports as a cornerstone of their programming and
that have locked up some key broadcast rights to sports popular with
Latino audiences.</TE>

<TE>   PUC May Have Broken Law in Edison Rescue</TE>
<TE>   A federal appeals court said the California Public Utilities
Commission may have broken state laws when it hammered out an
agreement in secret last October with Southern California Edison that
allowed the utility to begin paying the huge electricity debts it ran
up during the energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals asked the California Supreme
Court to rule on three potential violations of state law by the PUC
in crafting a rescue plan for Edison. That plan allows Edison to keep
electricity rates at current high levels until the utility's power
debts are paid.</TE>
<TE>   If the state Supreme Court agrees that the PUC violated these
laws, including open-meeting requirements and portions of the
landmark law that deregulated the state's investor-owned utilities,
the bailout agreement would be void, said Judge Sidney R. Thomas,
writing for the three-judge panel.</TE>
<TE>   Edison and the PUC pointed to the court's rejection of challenges
under federal law.</TE>

<TE>   Music Labels Consider Suing Bertelsmann</TE>
<TE>   Several record labels and music publishers are debating whether to
sue German media powerhouse Bertelsmann, owner of the BMG label, for
allegedly helping Napster Inc. users infringe song copyrights.</TE>
<TE>   If successful, a lawsuit could fetch as much as $1 billion--the
amount that Napster would be on the hook for if each alleged
copyright violation resulted in a maximum fine of $150,000. That
would dwarf the $90 million Bertelsmann has lent Napster since
October 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The potentially costly twist stems from evidence recently
unearthed in Napster's Delaware bankruptcy case showing that
Bertelsmann exerted more control over Napster's service than
previously known.</TE>
<TE>   A Bertelsmann spokeswoman and executives at rival labels declined
to comment. The Recording Industry Assn. of America is staying out of
the fight because it represents Bertelsmann and the other labels.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Also</TE>

sons and two other former company executives were indicted on federal

<HD>Turner Takes Tough Stance on Possible CNN-ABC Deal</HD>
<DH>The cable mogul sees the financial benefits of combined
news operations but is scrutinizing the price and timing of such a
venture, sources say</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER and MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Is Ted Turner ready to let CNN go?</LD>
<LD>   The creator of Cable News Network is asking the toughest questions
on AOL Time Warner Inc.'s board about a possible merger between CNN
and the ABC News division, according to people close to the company.</LD>
<LD>   As a little-known cable renegade from Atlanta, Turner dreamed up
the idea for CNN in 1978, when cable subscribers had just 12 channels
on the TV dial and Home Box Office's first original program was the
Pennsylvania Polka Festival.</LD>
<TE>   Few in the industry believed that a 24-hour TV news channel would
work. But today, AOL Time Warner's CNN is among the nation's most
profitable television news operations, earning more than $200 million
annually before taxes on revenue of $1.6 billion, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   So Turner, it seems, is not about to allow CNN to join forces with
Walt Disney Co.'s ABC News without an exacting agreement. "This is
his baby," said one person close to Turner.</TE>
<TE>   Turner, AOL Time Warner's vice chairman and the company's largest
individual shareholder, took a lead role in grilling management about
the possible news merger during a board meeting 10 days ago,
executives close to the cable mogul said.</TE>
<TE>   Turner, 63, could not be reached for comment. He is hiking in
China and Tibet, associates said.</TE>
<TE>   For 18 months, CNN and ABC News have been talking about joining
their news operations. The discussions heated up recently, sources
said, because both companies are grasping for ways to cut costs in
the wake of severe stock slides.</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposal being discussed, AOL Time Warner and Disney
would combine CNN and ABC News into a new company that would be
controlled by AOL, with a stake of about 65%. Disney would own the
rest. Management of the news operations, however, would be more
evenly shared, said sources close to the talks. Among the complicated
issues to be worked out are which overlapping news bureaus would be
cut, and how ABC's celebrated news broadcasters, such as Peter
Jennings, Ted Koppel and Barbara Walters, would fit into any CNN
broadcasts.</TE>
<TE>   Both companies confirmed last week that they were in discussions,
but said no deal is imminent.</TE>
<TE>   Turner sees the financial merits of a CNN-ABC News combination,
sources say, because a joint venture could save an estimated $200
million a year as news programming costs are rising and TV audiences
are sliced ever smaller by an explosion of channel choices. But
Turner questions whether the price and timing of a CNN-ABC venture
are right and whether a better deal could be had by waiting, sources
said.</TE>
<TE>   Disney is feeling pressure from Wall Street to stem losses at its
ABC Network that could top $500 million this year.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question that right now ABC is under more pressure to
do a deal," said Christopher Dixon, an analyst at UBS Warburg.</TE>
<TE>   Turner also doesn't want to rush into any partnership that
unnecessarily restricts AOL Time Warner's flexibility, as joint
ventures notoriously do, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Disney and AOL Time Warner have a history of bad blood. Disney was
one of the most vocal opponents of America Online's $99-billion
acquisition of Time Warner, first announced in January 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, several negotiations between the two rivals have
languished. Cable operators, including Time Warner Cable, have
threatened to drop Disney's ABC Family Channel rather than pay higher
subscriber fees it demanded. Another sore point is Time Warner
Cable's two-year effort to secure a video-on-demand deal with
Disney's movie studio.</TE>
<TE>   "Before we do a deal benefiting Disney, Ted wants to make sure
everything is buttoned up," one AOL Time Warner executive said.
"Nothing is going to slide through this company from now on without
extreme scrutiny."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Feeling Burned</TE>
<TE>   Veteran Time Warner executives, including Turner, feel burned by
the sale of the company to Internet service provider America Online.
Many privately blame former AOL Time Warner Chief Executive Gerald
Levin in particular for a lack of "due diligence"--failing to examine
AOL's books for signs of weakness as well as aggressive AOL
accounting practices that are the target of federal investigations.</TE>
<TE>   The completion of the America Online-Time Warner merger in January
2001 was a bitter awakening for Turner. The company failed to deliver
on the promised synergies between new and old media. A steep decline
in revenue at America Online, which had been hyped as the growth
engine of the new company, sent investors bailing. And as AOL Time
Warner failed to meet revenue and earnings targets, the company's
stock tumbled 75%, leading to several management shake-ups.</TE>
<TE>   On the AOL Time Warner board, Turner has become what one company
executive describes as a "catalyst for change."</TE>
<TE>   "Ted is still angry at himself for not asking more questions about
the AOL merger," one source close to Turner said. "So now, he's doing
his own due diligence, as a board member."</TE>
<TE>   Turner, who owns a 3% stake in the new company, has watched his
net worth dissolve. Forbes magazine pegs his wealth at $2.2 billion,
a 65% drop in the last year, largely because of AOL Time Warner's
steady stock decline.</TE>
<TE>   Turner is allied with other board members and large shareholders
who would like to overthrow the company's chairman, Steve Case, for
his role in AOL Time Warner's troubles.</TE>
<TE>   He already is credited with triggering the early exit of Levin,
who stepped down under pressure this spring and was replaced by
Richard Parsons. A passionate speech by Turner at a board meeting
last November urging a management change captured an undercurrent of
discontent among directors about the direction of the company under
Levin, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Turner's associates say their boss was too trusting in going along
with the merger plan and was distracted by a split with his wife,
actress Jane Fonda. As part of a restructuring before the merger,
Levin stripped Turner of his operating role at the cable group. Levin
merged Turner's group with Time Warner's broadcast operations and put
them under Jamie Kellner, founder of the company's WB network.</TE>
<TE>   After losing responsibility for CNN, HBO, TBS, TNT, the Cartoon
Network and other cable channels, Turner made himself scarce in
Atlanta's CNN Center.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cable Competitors</TE>
<TE>   Turner and Levin had been intense cable rivals dating back to the
1970s. At the time, Levin ran Time Inc.'s fledgling cable channel
HBO, launched in 1971. Levin had urged Time Inc.'s board to launch a
24-hour news channel to capitalize on its journalistic roots, but was
rebuffed because HBO was losing so much money, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Levin was one-upped by Turner, who launched CNN, but flimsy
financing threatened such an ambitious undertaking. The Atlanta
businessman, however, already had turned his Atlanta TV station,
WTBS, into the first cable "superstation" by using new satellite
technology to broadcast his Atlanta Braves baseball games nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Turner settled on the name Cable News Network, instead of Turner
News Network, to appeal to the cable operators he needed to carry the
channel. Turner's proposed format was a mix of four half-hour
segments--news, sports, women's and business news. But his staff
worried that the news channel might bankrupt his company.</TE>
<TE>   CNN's original offices didn't have bathrooms, just portable
toilets outside. Turner's news director suggested hiring an anchor
with star power and mentioned Dan Rather, who was waiting in the
wings at CBS for Walter Cronkite to retire. Turner, who had never
watched much news, asked, "Who's Dan Rather?" according to the
biography "Citizen Turner."</TE>
<TE>   The first CNN broadcast on June 1, 1980, was a bust. During the
first hour, CNN lost its feed from New York, went black, went back on
the air, cut out the middle of a presidential speech, tried-- and
failed--to go live to Jerusalem and then cut to CNN's reporter in Key
West, Fla., while he was picking his nose. In the early days, a
lightbulb exploded during a live shot from Washington, setting anchor
Daniel Schorr's clothes on fire, according to the Turner biography.</TE>
<TE>   But Turner was wily, surviving near-bankruptcy several times and
outmaneuvering the competition. In June 1982, ABC teamed up with
all-news radio stations owned by Westinghouse Electric Corp. to start
the Satellite News Channel as a CNN rival, prompting Turner to create
another channel, CNN Headline News, as a 2-for-1 offer to cable
operators to keep the rival off the dial.</TE>
<TE>   ABC eventually lost a reported $100 million and agreed to sell the
operation to Turner.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trumping the Networks</TE>
<TE>   By the late 1980s, CNN routinely trumped the major networks with
its live telecasts of space launches, wars and royal weddings. Then
in 1991, CNN's eerie gray images of the bombing of Baghdad and Peter
Arnett's live reports from Iraq during the Persian Gulf War prompted
then-President George Bush to say, "I learn more from CNN than I do
from the CIA."</TE>
<TE>   Turner was a major media force by the mid-1990s and attempted to
buy both CBS and NBC. He was convinced that he could save millions of
dollars by combining a broadcasters' news division with CNN.</TE>
<TE>   But he was blocked by his largest shareholders, Time Warner and
Liberty Media Corp. Frustrated by the relatively small size of his
business amid a frantic media consolidation, Turner in 1995 accepted
Levin's offer to buy Turner Broadcasting System Inc. for $6.7
billion. The next year, both NBC and Fox launched 24-hour news
channels, challenging CNN's dominance.</TE>
<TE>   News Corp.'s Fox News Channel took off with its combative brand of
news coverage, helped by its exhaustive treatment of the Monica
Lewinsky scandal. This year, Fox News' ratings have consistently
bested CNN's. Fox News' Bill O'Reilly has the top-rated news show on
cable, beating CNN's longtime star Larry King, who comes in second.
O'Reilly also whips CNN's Connie Chung, lured away from ABC this year
in an attempt beef up CNN's ratings.</TE>
<TE>   The prospect of CNN losing its independence one day makes Turner
nostalgic, a friend said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd characterize his attitude toward the merger as wistful."</TE>

<TE>   Some days I wonder if the conspiracy theorists aren't right: Maybe
we are going daffy from the microwaves beaming out of cell phones or
the acrylamide concealed in French fries.</TE>
<TE>   How else can we account for the weird turn in censorship? It's no
longer necessary to protest something you find offensive. Or to try
to ban it. Now all you have to do is turn to those who can make it
disappear--simply edit it away, gone where it can't offend again.</TE>
<TE>   So now a group of film directors, backed by the Directors Guild of
America, has been dragged into court in Denver to counter a frivolous
legal action by a company that re-edits and sanitizes feature films
to reflect its own moralizing world view. The company, describing
itself as just a friendly co-op of good folks, asked a federal judge
to affirm its right to rent these falsified movies to the public. The
legal action has brought to light the nauseating spread of
like-minded enterprises that similarly excise the combat from war
movies, the embraces  from romances and the raw from street
scenes--all for the sake of you-know-who.</TE>
<TE>   Hey, they're good Christians and they can do what they want,
right? After all, movies don't represent the work, sensibilities,
intellectual property and investments of the people whose names
appear on the credits, do they? No, as long as you believe in
you-know-what it's OK to remake scenes to your liking--and never mind
the fierce objections of those who created the film.</TE>
<TE>   We hear family values evoked in this argument. But it is an
assault on all our values to say that it's OK to hijack and fake
someone else's work.</TE>
<TE>   What's next? Once these self-appointed revisionists finish
cutting, think of all the editing opportunities to add scenes into
movies. Maybe the friendly folks at the co-op will edit a sermon from
Jerry Falwell into "Titanic" to drive home the lesson that awful
things come to people who don't follow the true path.</TE>
<TE>   Cut a little cleavage, add a few prayers ... say, why don't they
make their own movie?</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, it's not just the you-know-who zealots who want to
reshape our world at the expense of our values. The loonies on the
other side are plenty busy with the same mischief.</TE>
<TE>   This year, an observant parent in New York discovered that the
state's high school tests had taken passages from literature and
re-edited them to fit snugly within the most extreme confines of
political correctness.</TE>
<TE>   References to race, religion and heritage were cut from the work
of notable writers, including those whose careers were devoted to
matters of race, religion and heritage. Fat became heavy, skinny
became thin, mention of wine was cut from the phrase "fine California
wine and seafood," Jewish women became just women. Similarly, school
officials in Massachusetts confessed to deleting mention that a
character in a book carried a cigar.</TE>
<TE>   Students were told to write reflective thoughts about these
passages, never knowing they were deceptive.</TE>
<TE>   What a foundation for learning, eh? Start the kids out for college
with a pack of lies. Show them that there's no need to quote
accurately what someone wrote. Go ahead and attribute to writers what
you think they should have written.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the righteous bubble-heads who are taking Wite-Out to
movies, the bluenoses in New York backed down in the face of
ridicule.</TE>
<TE>   But you can bet they haven't given up.</TE>
<TE>   These extremists aren't just silly, they are drilling wormholes
beneath the waterline of our society. There are better ways--good and
common-sense ways--to shelter our children and to stand up for
fairness in our society. If the headlines of corporate scandals have
shown us anything in recent months, it's the damage that results when
people lose sight of the difference between right and wrong in the
pursuit of their own grandiose interests.</TE>
<TE>   On D-Day, the Germans fired real guns that blew people to pieces
on the beach where they bled and died. When Harry met Sally, Meg Ryan
wasn't pretending to be tickled in that diner. It didn't happen that
Herman Melville's Ahab was captain of a whale-watching cruise.</TE>
<TE>   And Ernest Hemingway didn't write about photo safaris either.</TE>

<HD>A Judicial Nominee's Dizzying Spin</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRANK del OLMO</AU>
<BD>Frank del Olmo is associate editor of The Times.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Beltway Bandidos are all worked up over President Bush's
nomination of Washington lawyer Miguel Estrada to be a federal judge.
Yet while the Estrada nomination merits attention and a healthy
debate, it is nowhere near the epochal struggle that the overheated
rhetoric it is generating might lead one to believe.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, don't expect any of the Beltway Bandidos--that small
cadre of professional Latino activists, lobbyists and political
appointees who prefer working inside the Beltway to grass-roots
activism in the nation's far-flung barrios and colonias--to
understand that. They're too close to the perpetual political fires
of the capital to remember that, no matter what today's political
melodrama is, it probably has been played out before, albeit with a
different cast of characters.</LD>
<LD>   Estrada, 41, is a native of Honduras and by all accounts a smart
young lawyer (out of Columbia College and Harvard Law School) with a
deeply conservative ideological streak.</LD>
<TE>   The reason his nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia is generating so much heat is that White House
political operatives have been bandying his name about as the Latino
whom Bush may someday nominate to the U.S. Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Although Estrada has never been a judge, the White House's spin on
his nomination carries weight because the 2nd District is widely
regarded as the second-most-important court in the country, and
something of a farm club for the Supreme Court. It is where Clarence
Thomas sat, for instance, before being elevated to the high court by
President Bush the elder.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Thomas is also the boogeyman who frightens liberal Latino
activists when they ponder the prospect of a young right-wing
activist such as Estrada on the federal bench with a lifetime
appointment. That is why the Congressional Hispanic Caucus lost a bit
of stature by announcing its opposition to Estrada before the nominee
got his hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Washington's Latino liberals were only responding to
the White House spin regarding Estrada. On several occasions the
president has compared the young attorney's brief career to a Horatio
Alger story. Not quite. Estrada was the well-educated son of a
successful Honduran attorney when he immigrated to New York City.</TE>
<TE>   That is far different from the experience of the typical Central
American immigrant, as Bush surely knows.</TE>
<TE>   But then, florid rhetoric is typical of Washington. And so is
politicizing judicial appointments, as anyone who remembers the
battles over Thomas' ascension to the Supreme Court or the failed
nomination of Robert Bork. And if the Senate Judiciary Committee,
which is controlled 10 to 9 by Democrats, votes along party lines,
Estrada won't even be the first Latino lawyer to be shot down for
purely political reasons.</TE>
<TE>   During the Clinton administration, a Republican-dominated Senate
held up the appointment of dozens of qualified attorneys to the
federal bench for no better reason than they had been nominated by a
Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   Among them were such respected Latino attorneys as Samuel Paz of
Los Angeles and a couple of Bush's fellow Texans, Jorge Rangel of
Corpus Christi and Enrique Moreno of El Paso.</TE>
<TE>   So enough of the Sturm und Drang over Estrada. If he beats the
political odds and gets nominated, more power to him. If he doesn't,
the White House will have to find another Latino attorney to nominate
to the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   That raises a fascinating question that no one has asked in the
flap over Estrada: Whatever happened to all the talk that White House
counsel Alberto R. Gonzales, Bush's old friend from Austin, is
destined to be the first Latino nominated to the Supreme Court? Has
Gonzales' reputation begun to wilt in Washington's constant political
glare?</TE>
<TE>   It apparently has, if one ponders the views of conservative
opinion leaders such as New York Times columnist William Safire.
After touting Gonzales as a possible high court nominee early on,
Safire's enthusiasm has cooled. This year, the influential columnist
went so far as to dismiss Gonzales as a lawyer "who signs off on
half-baked memos and orders." Ouch.</TE>
<TE>   No matter what happens to Estrada, we clearly have not heard the
last of Bush's plans to nominate a Latino to the Supreme Court. But
don't expect it to be pleasant--just highly political.</TE>

<HD>Sportsmanship Has Nothing to Do With Being a Boy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILLIE JEAN KING</AU>
<BD>Billie Jean King, U.S. Fed Cup captain, is founder of
the Women's Sports Foundation, an educational organization dedicated
to ensuring equal access and opportunities for girls and women in
sports and fitness.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is a lot of debate going on about Title IX, the federal law
that requires gender equity in sports. I just want to weigh in on one
point: girls' interest in sport.</LD>
<LD>   If I had a daughter, I wouldn't want anyone telling her that boys
are more interested in sports than girls or assuming that she is less
interested. That would be no different than believing stereotypes
such as boys are more interested in math or blacks are more
interested in basketball than tennis. Sports participation is as
important for our daughters as it is for our sons.</LD>
<LD>   Boys have never had to prove that they were interested in sports
to get the opportunity to play. Why should girls have to "prove"
their interest? Society just encourages and expects boys to play.
Interest is a function of the opportunity to play and encouragement
to take advantage of that opportunity.</LD>
<TE>   Boys are not born with a "sports interest" gene. They are pushed,
cajoled, expected and sometimes even embarrassed into playing, and we
provide them with every opportunity to do so. A coach who sees a big
boy in school makes him come out for football. Tall boys are dragged
onto the basketball team. Boys who run fast are encouraged to run
track.</TE>
<TE>   Sports are so important that we must encourage girls in the same
way. Talk about administering interest surveys to prove that boys are
more interested in sports than girls and setting quotas on the number
of girls who can play based on surveys is wrong thinking and a misuse
of an instrument that measures attitudes, not behavior.</TE>
<TE>   I dare any school to invite Serena Williams, Cynthia Cooper or
Julie Foudy to speak to the girls in that school and then administer
an interest survey. Williams would tell them how much fun it is to
play sports. Cooper would say that there is a sport out there in
which every girl can succeed. Foudy would tell them playing is
important for their confidence, health and success in life after
sports. Most girls would want to play after that kind of
encouragement.</TE>
<TE>   So why are teachers and coaches not doing this? Why aren't our
educational leaders encouraging girls to play sports?</TE>
<TE>   This is not and cannot be a "male versus female" issue. Boys and
girls should play sports, and they should be treated equally.</TE>
<TE>   Boys and girls should grow up respecting the rights and abilities
of each other in sports and in life.</TE>

<HD>To Protect and Serve, Honestly</HD>
<DH>The mayor should look for a chief who has the courage to
stand up to corruption.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRANK SERPICO</AU>
<BD>Frank Serpico is the former New York City police
detective whose revelations of corruption resulted in the Knapp
Commission being formed.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In April 1999, after I finished a lecture to a group of criminal
justice students at an upstate New York university, several police
officials and I retired to a local tavern for a beer and some cop
talk.</LD>
<LD>   Out of the corner of my eye I noticed what first appeared to be a
seedy-looking character approaching me. Who was he and why was he
there?</LD>
<LD>   The man seemed out of place, yet with all those cops around, no
one seemed to be concerned. In fact, a couple of officers seemed to
know him.</LD>
<TE>   I soon discovered that he had flown all the way from L.A. just to
see me. Before I took my first sip of beer, I realized we had
something in common; it was like talking to an old colleague.</TE>
<TE>   He said he had something to tell me: Something big was about to
come down in the Los Angeles Police Department, something he and
others had warned supervisors about; they had been ignored.</TE>
<TE>   He was an undercover narcotics officer in the Los Angeles Police
Department. That something big he alluded to was what we now know as
the Rampart Division scandal, in which rogue cops, among other
things, stole drugs and money and planted evidence.</TE>
<TE>   What has this to do with the selection of a new police chief?</TE>
<TE>   Well, as it turns out, the Rampart scandal could have been avoided
if top officials had been willing to listen to a couple of honest
cops and followed through on their revelations.</TE>
<TE>   This story is reminiscent of what happened in my case when, as a
narcotics officer in the New York Police Department in the 1970s, I
brought large-scale corruption in the department to the attention of
the police commissioner. This resulted in the formation of the Knapp
Commission, which concluded that the department was rife with
corruption.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty years have passed, and half a dozen police commissioners in
New York have come and gone, and there are new scandals. I am still
treated as an outcast by the powers that be in the NYPD. This tells
me that they saw me only as a source of embarrassment; they would
have preferred sweeping the issue under the rug.</TE>
<TE>   The best reflection of the commission's attitude at the time was
Chairman Whitman Knapp's response to a reporter who asked how the
commission was going to handle then-Mayor John Lindsey in its
investigation. Knapp asked, rhetorically, how could he investigate
the man who appointed him? The integrity of the chief lays heavily on
the integrity of the man who hires him.</TE>
<TE>   What the community requires is what the police require: a leader
who is concerned with the welfare and safety of the whole community
and not a select few. A police chief with vision, compassion and an
understanding of the communities that his officers are to serve.</TE>
<TE>   There is a need to change the culture of the LAPD so that all
people are treated equally. The new chief should be a person of
integrity who recognizes the diversity of the population and its
needs and believes that minorities and the poor have the right to
equal protection under the law. It should be someone who knows that
part of the reward for police is serving the public, not exploiting
them or being a bully; someone who sees the need for new applicants
to be properly psychologically screened and community-trained and
-oriented.</TE>
<TE>   This person must not be an ego-centered head-breaker or a wannabe
politician looking to advance his own cause. It must be someone who
understands that police are civil servants who need to be respected
and who can be proud of their calling but first have to earn that
respect by respecting the people they serve.</TE>
<TE>   A chief must make his officers understand that if they violate the
law, they will be punished in the same manner that other suspects are
punished. Too often, cops caught breaking the law are simply
dismissed rather than given jail terms.</TE>
<TE>   A good chief will earn the respect of his men by treating them
fairly, without double standards. The police profession is a
demanding one, and officers should feel free and safe to talk to
their commanders like grown men and women, without fear of
retribution. Most important, a chief must encourage his officers to
speak out against corruption, praising and rewarding them when they
do so and not hanging them out to dry.</TE>
<TE>   Police scandals come and go, but one underlying truth remains. In
each instance, there was an honest cop who tried to bring it to the
attention of superiors and was ignored. A scandal must be avoided at
all costs. A few small fry get fired and sometimes are arrested, but
their cases often are reversed on appeal. The good cops are left
holding the bag.</TE>
<TE>   The big chiefs who don't make waves sail on to another
country-club assignment. One NYPD commissioner stated in my case that
it was his job to safeguard the image of the NYPD. In the eyes of the
community, that image doesn't amount to much if communication is
lacking. The police image will only be improved by mutual respect and
fairness, not by fear and intimidation.</TE>
<TE>   Although the grass always seems greener on the other side of the
fence, Mayor James Hahn needn't cross the state line for a candidate
for police chief. All he needs is someone who can identify the local
flora and fauna and knows how to weed his garden.</TE>

<HD>Failing Magic at Disney</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What's bad for Walt Disney Co. is bad for Southern California, and at
the moment Disney Chairman Michael Eisner is looking pretty bad.
Theme park attendance has stalled and the new attraction in Anaheim
has proved a California Misadventure. The studio has lost its edge in
animated film, the Angels continue to lose money despite their
current glory, and ABC, shut out in the recent Emmy Awards, seems to
stand for Anything But Compelling.</LD>
<LD>   Disney has been hard-hit by a tourism slowdown and advertising
slump, but one man shoulders the blame for the company's
shortcomings. Eisner has occupied the chairman's office for 18 years,
longer than anyone other than founder Walt Disney. So today's Disney
is a direct reflection of Eisner, the executive who was recruited in
1984 to restore magic to a troubled entertainment kingdom.</LD>
<LD>   Eisner's penchant for losing top executives has led to a parade of
sorcerer's apprentices. He's failed to identify a successor or a
strategic plan to cure the company's current woes. Board members
blushed when it surfaced that the company had hired their relatives.
Most painful was the plunging stock price that led Warren Buffett to
sell shares and prompted tough questions from longtime board members
Roy E. Disney and Stanley P. Gold.</LD>
<TE>   Disney's future began to emerge Tuesday during a blunt, five-hour
board meeting. The initial changes will reshape Disney's board, which
at times has included Eisner's lawyer, his architect and the
principal of his children's elementary school. Board members Gold and
former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell now share control over the powerful
corporate governance committee. But for the sake of Southern
California's entertainment and retail sectors, we'd like to see more
changes, because the hand-picked board remains too cozy. Eisner also
must safeguard Disney's future by producing the succession plan and
telling how he'll revive the flagging businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Eisner is thinking about selling the Angels and merging the costly
ABC news division with a competitor, and maintains that Disney will
turn around when the economy rebounds. But managing a complex media
company during a tough economy has frustrated other executives--just
ask former Vivendi Universal Chairman Jean-Marie Messier or Steve
Case at AOL Time Warner.</TE>
<TE>   Eisner deserves applause for transforming a moribund theme park
operator and film company into a media giant. But the pressure on
Eisner is growing. And, just as in Hollywood, successful sequels in
the corporate world are few and far between.</TE>

<LD>The 19 hijackers of Sept. 11 operated with impunity in Europe and the
United States. They came and went as they pleased, even in one case
calling the Fairfax, Va., cops indignantly after an attempted
robbery. In 1998, the CIA declared war against terrorism, but the few
warnings from within the intelligence community that might have
uncovered the airplane plot were dismissed by higher-ups.</LD>
<LD>   Yet on Thursday, Cofer Black, the former CIA chief of
counterterrorism, and Dale Watson, former director of FBI
counterintelligence and counterterrorism, told Congress that their
agencies were merely underfunded--and as successful as they could be
under the circumstances.</LD>
<LD>   Huh? No one likes having their failings publicly exposed, but it
defies belief that the intelligence community needed just a few more
dollars to stop the hijackers.</LD>
<TE>   Congressional hearings brought to light FBI agent Coleen Rowley's
attempts to alert headquarters to potential air terrorism. They
exposed the fact that the CIA knew in January 2000 that Khalid
Almihdhar, later a hijacker, had attended an Al Qaeda-linked meeting
in Malaysia, but that it neglected to put him and an associate, Nawaf
Alhazmi (another hijacker) on an immigration watch list until late
August 2001. By then they were in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   For Congress to throw more money at the CIA and FBI and allow them
to continue as before smacks of the boards of directors that gave
their chief executives big bonuses even while the companies verged on
bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   What the testimony of Black and Watson pointedly illustrates is
the circle-the-wagons mentality that still pervades much of the
intelligence community. As former CIA operatives Reuel Marc Gerecht
and Robert Baer have recently pointed out, the agency's problems are
systemic.</TE>
<TE>   Officers in foreign countries too often do not attempt to
penetrate the societies in which they are stationed. The CIA had
depicted an Al Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan as virtually
impenetrable. But if that were so, why was John Walker Lindh, whose
history as a Muslim was brief, able to waltz right in? London had
become a hothouse for militant Islam, but the CIA station there in
the 1990s didn't have any Arabic speakers. No doubt the CIA and FBI
were collecting information on terrorism, but information, as Thomas
Powers points out in the Oct. 10 New York Review of Books, is not
tantamount to intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   The Times' Greg Miller has reported that the CIA has done
everything in its power to prevent House-Senate investigators from
obtaining information about its performance.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe CIA counterterrorism efforts should receive a 100% increase
in funding, as Black maintained before Congress. But not before the
ills of the intelligence community are studied by an independent
panel. It would be reassuring if intelligence officials were less
concerned about safeguarding their reputations and more aggressive
about improving efforts to protect the country.</TE>

<HD>Trouble in Storage</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>So now it appears that pretty soon they'll need to build sprawling,
ugly self-storage units to store the growing number of sprawling,
ugly self-storage units going vacant. Business is dropping
nationally, mainly because of overbuilding and increasing competition
in what has basically been a get-rich-quick scheme to rent storage
space for junk you want to own but don't want to step over every day.</LD>
<LD>   Everything is more crowded nowadays. The standard intersection has
only four corners, and with inconvenient convenience stores occupying
two of them, there's only so much room left for banks, burgers, nail
salons, one-hour photo shops and self-storage units. Homes have the
same space jam.</LD>
<LD>   The basement was invented in medieval days to store misbehaving
peasants. It was called a dungeon. The democratic and more spacious
New World disdained such dank places until the growth of a middle
class that prized owning a lot of stuff.</LD>
<TE>   At first, Americans stored their stuff in the barn, then the attic
of the house. With the advent of earth-moving equipment came an
exotic dark place called the basement. This was a large area beneath
the house containing the furnace, Dad's workbench, a washing machine,
nonseasonal clothes and high school yearbooks. Basements also made
excellent homes for mice and storage tanks for excess rainwater
during wet years.</TE>
<TE>   As housing became more expensive and American family sizes grew,
basements were turned into family rooms, where children could be
noisy and wreck furniture while the adults lived upstairs with their
good stuff.</TE>
<TE>   The basement made so much sense for utilizing another level of
limited urban land space that Southern California builders abandoned
the concept. Furnaces went in the attic. Air conditioners went in the
backyard. And all of the family's stuff had to go somewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Enter the neighborhood self-storage facility, a mind-numbing line
of cement-block cubicles where stuff could be stored until it rotted
or could be donated for an inflated tax deduction. Or sold at the
next garage sale and moved to another family's cement-block cubicle
to await future garage sales.</TE>
<TE>   More than 35,000 self-storage facilities--some 6,000 in California
alone--scar the American landscape today, a 60% jump in 10 years.
Self-storage complexes also boosted the chain-link fence business.</TE>
<TE>   Demand for these basements-away-from-home was so great that
monthly rents could rival actual apartment rents somewhere. (1 rm
apt, grnd flr, no brms, bth or vu). Self-storage became a lucrative
monthly rent-collection business for landlords free of noisy parties,
dirty pets and plugged bathroom pipes. But now vacancy rates are
rising.</TE>
<TE>   Here's one solution: Rent empty units to the Corrections
Department as dungeons.</TE>

<LD>Re "White House Criticizes State Stem Cell Law," Sept. 24: Despite
all, it will happen. If not in the U.S., then in some other country.
Mankind has never been able to keep from pursuing this type of golden
bauble of hope. I object to the religious arguments that are used
against this research because they have always proved to be wrong in
the past. Ethical arguments are fine, but they can also be used to
set protocol and not limits.</LD>
<LD>   However, if you are going to do this research with a limited pool
of stem cells to work from, you are not controlling the potential for
an undesirable outcome to occur as a result of the research. You are
only slowing it down, maybe. So the present approach to this matter
is not a viable solution to the fears of many who foresee terrible
and unwanted results in the long run because of this research. We
have actually prevented nothing from occurring--we have just slowed
it down. There is no simple answer.</LD>

<HD>Sleepless in Encino: Film Crews at Work</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two nights last week (Monday and Wednesday) many of us in the Encino
area were the victims of complete thoughtlessness and lack of
planning by a crew apparently filming in the Sepulveda Dam area. Each
of these nights at about 11 p.m., I was awakened by a series of
tremendous explosions accompanied by what sounded like automatic
weapons fire. My first impression was terrorist activity or police
and gang activity in our neighborhood. This went on for about two
minutes. Monday night it was repeated at about 30 minutes after the
first series of explosions. Wednesday night we got lucky. There was
only one several-minute interruption to our sleep.</LD>
<LD>   When I was a young man, I heard many similar noises in combat.
This was expected. In today's world, when we find ourselves
constantly reminded of terrorism, it hardly seems appropriate for
unannounced explosions to intentionally take place in the middle of
the night near residential areas.</LD>
<LD>   Why were the residents not informed beforehand? Why was the hour
of 11 p.m. chosen for this activity? Many residents are asleep at
this time, and it doesn't require too much intelligence to realize
that it is just as dark about 8:30 p.m. as it is at 11 (this time of
year). Do the people who authorize the filming in residential or
public areas ever consider the disruption caused by their activity? I
feel strongly that they could not care less.</LD>
<TE>   If these last few nights of film company activity are an
indication of a complete lack of concern on the part of those who
scheduled and authorized them, I would like to show my lack of
concern for their activities and suggest maybe they return to the
studios for future "shoot 'em ups."</TE>

<HD>Irreverent 'Barbershop' Cuts Close to Home</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Black Leaders Angered by Scene Say 'Barbershop' Needs a Trim,"
Sept. 25: I am African American, and while I don't personally agree
with the controversial statements made in this hilarious film, I do
recognize that, as a person who has experienced firsthand the types
of discussions and gossip that occur in a barbershop, the statements
made were only an example of the types of outlandish things one might
hear in that environment. When I became the father of a son, one of
the things I looked forward to was taking him to the barbershop, an
institution in any African American community.</LD>
<LD>   There is always one person in the shop, either a customer or
employee, who plays the devil's advocate and stokes the direction of
the subject matter by saying something totally opposite to the
popular point of view. Those statements in "Barbershop," while being
controversial, only served to underscore the depiction of that type
of person in that setting. I think the Revs. Jesse Jackson, Al
Sharpton and other so-called black leaders should fight the bigger
battle against unemployment, lack of educational opportunity, etc.,
and stop attempting to censure the entertainment industry for an
artistic endeavor that is obviously being played for broad laughs.</LD>
<LD>   Duane Norris</LD>
<TE>   Carson</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One word to Jackson and Sharpton and all other critics of the
movie "Barbershop": Chill. I see the level of candor and free speech
in this movie as incredibly refreshing. A people's ability to not
only laugh at themselves (and even at their sacred icons) but let the
world in on it is evidence of great health and maturity. These
critics are not demonstrating this maturity at all, and they are
insulting the intelligence of the African American community as well
as our diverse community at large. By throwing such tantrums they are
only reinforcing the stereotype of the hypersensitive, who have been
so catered to in the political correctness movement that they have
become nothing more than super-self-centered spoiled brats. I shudder
to think how they will react to the typical everyday criticism and
attempts at humor leveled at our first black president.</TE>
<TE>   Shelley Frost</TE>
<TE>   Redondo Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's comment that "you would not make Golda Meir the butt of
a joke" displays a profound ignorance of Jewish tradition. Not only
political leaders of the Jewish state but biblical patriarchs and the
Almighty himself have been legitimate targets for Jewish humor. For
3,000 years Jews have targeted such luminaries both in and out of the
faith; even God is not immune and is the occasional butt of a joke in
the Talmud and the Midrash [rabbinical commentaries on the
Scriptures]. Fair is fair: If Jews can make fun of God, surely blacks
can make fun of Jesse Jackson. Tell Jesse to lighten up.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Helfer</TE>
<TE>   Topanga</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I am deeply disappointed in Jackson's and Sharpton's calls for a
boycott and apology for the movie "Barbershop." Didn't the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. give his life so we could all have civil
rights, including freedom of speech? To top it off, Jackson admits
not having seen the movie, basing his opinion just on reading a
version of the script.</TE>

<LD>Re "L.A. Badge Outshines N.Y. Flash," Commentary, Sept. 26: Former
LAPD detective and current author Joseph Wambaugh would like readers
to believe that if Mayor James Hahn does not select Art Lopez as the
LAPD chief, a negative message would be sent to the rank and file,
especially the Latinos on the force.</LD>
<LD>   To avoid any negative messages, Hahn needs to select the best
qualified candidate regardless of ethnicity.</LD>

<TE>   So Wambaugh slams the outsiders? Well, in the military the guy at
the top is a general, and that means that generals take over
divisions no matter where the general is from or where the division
is located, because a general is a generalist, not a specialist. And
that is how I see the police chief thing. I'd rather have an outsider
with a new perspective and different ideas than an insider with more
of the same.</TE>
<TE>   And besides, John Timoney knows how to do it right, coming to L.A.
and eating enchiladas ("Rivals for Police Chief's Job Pal Around in

<LD>Re "Daschle Accuses Bush of Playing Politics on Iraq," Sept. 26:
Finally! I didn't think the Democrats would ever find their voice.
They have been like sheep, refusing to utter a word against either
rushing to war with Iraq or postponing the huge tax cut that was
passed last year. One can question these things without being
unpatriotic, despite what Vice President Dick Cheney suggested after
9/11. This is a democracy, not a monarchy.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) is concerned about
what the president's policy on Iraq will do to our international
partnerships. I guess what he is concerned about is that they might
get upset and insist we stop sending them billions. Obviously we
can't have that. It would be totally opposed to good liberal
Democratic principles. I guess President Bush didn't think about
that, although I guess I could learn to live with it.</TE>

Congratulations to John Balzar--finally someone in print who
understands the program! All the pantywaists are bemoaning what our
"friends" around the world might think of us. Look at what is
actually happening. The Palestinian Authority is about to be
replaced, the North Koreans are suddenly talkative and Iraq is
praying for inspections. Can you imagine what the Saudis, Iranians
and all those other two-bit dictatorships are thinking?</TE>
<TE>   You see, the beauty of the strategy is that the ones with the
courage to stick to their principles are never actually bluffing.
That's why they rarely have to fight.</TE>

<TE>   Bush may be a brawler today, but we know he wasn't during the
Vietnam War, when he chose to join the Texas Air National Guard to
avoid having to go to Vietnam. It is also reported that Cheney chose
not to go to Vietnam by using the college student deferment. Strange
that we are now being led into war by two people who chose not to
fight in Vietnam.</TE>

<TE>   I can only say a loud amen to the concern expressed by Steve Lopez
about the misplaced priorities of the Bush administration vis-a-vis
protecting the nation from terrorist actions ("Forget the Saddam
Offensive--Focus on Our Defenseless Ports," Sept. 25).</TE>
<TE>   One of my first thoughts after that fateful Sept. 11 was that now
there would be no excuse for continuing the National Missile Defense
program--those billions should be applied to protecting us from much
more dangerous and imminent threats, which would be primarily focused
on our seaports.</TE>
<TE>   But here we are, one year down the road, and it seems that the
amount spent on port security is at very inadequate levels, while the
NMD program is still rolling along. This administration seems totally
devoid of creative thinking.</TE>

<TE>   Re your Sept. 24 editorial, "U.N. Needs to Act Quickly": The Iraqi
palaces are not all residences. But the arms inspectors are not all
arms inspectors either. Just maybe Saddam Hussein doesn't want to
give CIA tag-alongs a road map of his key government offices. In
1998, President Clinton bombed away for several days to get Monica
Lewinsky off the front pages. In 2002, Bush needs a diversion from a
sinking economy.</TE>

<DH>Is purchasing hundreds of costly F/A-22 Raptor warplanes
the best defense against terrorism?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM M. ARKIN</AU>
<BD>William M. Arkin is a military affairs analyst who
writes regularly for Opinion. E-mail: warkin@igc.org</BD>
<DL>SOUTH POMFRET, Vt.</DL>
<LD>If only we'd had the F/A-22 Raptor jet on the morning of Sept. 11.
The ultra-fast stealth aircraft could have intercepted and shot down
the second airliner heading for the south tower of the World Trade
Center in New York City--and possibly those that crashed into the
Pentagon and in Pennsylvania as well.</LD>
<LD>   This claim--complete with the computer modeling to back it up--has
been circulating in hushed whispers inside the Air Force recently,
along with news that the Air Force's new fighter, scheduled for
deployment in the next five years, is being recast as an essential
part of any missile defense of the United States. On Sept. 17, Air
Force Chief of Staff Gen. John P. Jumper announced that the service
was redesignating the airplane formerly known as the F-22 for a
multimission role, thrusting its premier fighter program into a
prominent position in maintaining homeland security.</LD>
<LD>   Given the number of detractors the $100-million-a-plane Lockheed
Martin superjet has attracted over the years--most of them outside
the Air Force--the announcement smacks of opportunism. With the first
Raptor planes now in flight testing, how better to solidify support
from the administration, Congress and the citizenry than to promise
that they will protect us on the home front?</LD>
<TE>   But this is a severe case of war planners fighting the last war.
Yes, maybe if the Raptor had been operational we could have saved
some lives last year. But describing the new airplane as being able
to do everything but deliver babies is a bit much. And if the larger
goal is to prevent terrorism, is spending billions of dollars to be
able to shoot planes out of the sky really the best use of resources?</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force is right about one thing: The F-15 Eagle
interceptors that took off at 8:52 a.m. on Sept. 11, 2001, just six
minutes after American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the World
Trade Center's north tower, weren't able to prevent the next tragedy.
According to a riveting account of the day that appeared in Aviation
Week &amp; Space Technology, the pilots of the F-15s got into the air
with remarkable speed and then "jammed the ... throttles into
afterburner, [devouring] the 153 miles to New York City at supersonic
speeds." But even flying supersonically, the F-15s were still eight
minutes from Manhattan when the second plane, United Airlines Flight
175, smashed into the south tower.</TE>
<TE>   Heartbroken and short on fuel as a result of the extended flight
in afterburner, the F-15 crews refueled over the city and spent the
next five hours intercepting and identifying nearly everything in the
skies in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Without question the F/A-22 Raptor is a faster airplane and might
have gotten to New York more quickly. But what then? Would blasting
an airliner full of people out of the air over a major metropolitan
area have saved lives or caused more casualties?</TE>
<TE>   The Raptor was designed for war. As a recent Air Force report to
the secretary of Defense put it, the aircraft's "combination of
stealth, supercruise, [and] maneuverability ... represent an
exponential leap in warfighting capabilities and allow for the full
realization of operational concepts that are vital to the 21st
century Air Force." The plane "can exploit its stealth and speed,"
the report continued, to destroy targets in the air and on the
ground. It would also "significantly improve the U.S. ability to
engage cruise missiles ... and achieve air superiority with much
fewer platforms." The plane's ability to "supercruise"--to fly
supersonically without going into afterburner--will allow it to
travel faster, save enormous amounts of fuel and extend its range.
All very useful, no doubt, but how do these bells and whistles
benefit domestic security?</TE>
<TE>   By enabling us to achieve more with less, the Air Force Assn., a
civilian advocacy group, says. Because of their increased speed,
F/A-22s could cover the air space above U.S. nuclear power plants in
an emergency with half the number of F-15s it now takes.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force realizes, though, that it is treading on potentially
dangerous ground. On the one hand, Americans might back increased
spending on Raptor aircraft if they believed the planes could be
useful in intercepting Sept. 11-type attacks. But while Air Force
personnel speculate among themselves about how F/A-22s could have
changed things, they don't speculate publicly. As one senior Air
Force officer says, the plane's detractors might "misinterpret" such
comments and assume that "the Air Force is trying to use the tragic
events of 9/11 to support buying more F-22s."</TE>
<TE>   Air Force personnel are reluctant to give ammunition to those they
believe, as the senior officer puts it, "have turned killing the F-22
into a religion." And they have a point. Although the Air Force has
believed in the plane from the beginning, outsiders were more
skeptical, and the plane has traveled a rough road.</TE>
<TE>   The Raptor was conceived during the Cold War, with plans to build
750. When the Soviet Union collapsed, that number was scaled back
sharply. The Gulf War precipitated a second look at the craft's
mission. War planners began to realize that the U.S. had plenty of
capacity to shoot enemy planes from the skies: What it really needed
was more precision bombers. And so a bomb-dropping capability was
added to the F-22's functions.</TE>
<TE>   Still, by the time the second President Bush came into office,
Raptor supporters were barely holding together a consensus that 339
F/A-22s should be built. In May, Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld's staff posited that perhaps the nation could make do with
just 180.</TE>
<TE>   Now, whether because of well-placed whispers about the plane's
role in domestic security or for some other reason, the Air Force
seems to have convinced civilian military planners, including those
in the Department of Defense, that the right number of Raptors is
381. Of the planes, 24 would be assigned to each of 10 so-called air
expeditionary forces, the new Air Force organizational unit. The
remainder will be used for training and spares. But the 381 number
does not officially include planes for defense here at home, which
has raised suspicions that Raptor boosters are capitalizing on fears
about domestic security to secure a commitment to build even more
F/A-22s.</TE>
<TE>   Homeland security is red hot these days, so it's no wonder that
the military sees it as a possible way to get pet projects fully
funded. Nor is it a surprise that the Air Force sees airplanes as
essential to protecting the populace. But there is much harder work
that needs doing--such as improving intelligence and keeping
hijackers off planes in the first place. A force of 10,000 Raptors
can't accomplish that.</TE>

<AU>JULIAN BOND</AU>
<BD>Julian Bond is a distinguished professor at American
University and a history professor at the University of Virginia. He
is board chairman of the NAACP.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>I'm not Andrew Young. I'm not Roger Wilkins either.</LD>
<LD>   But I'm often mistaken for both.</LD>
<LD>   There are worse things than to be mistaken for these two highly
accomplished achievers. Young is a former ambassador to the United
Nations and the former mayor of Atlanta. He was a close confidant of
Martin Luther King Jr. Today, he owns an international consulting
firm. Wilkins was a journalist at the New York Times and at the
Washington Post, where he shared in a Pulitzer Prize for the paper's
Watergate coverage. Before that, he was an assistant attorney general
of the United States. He's now a respected author, a professor at
George Mason University and a member of the Washington, D.C., school
board.</LD>
<TE>   The three of us have much in common. We are all male. All three of
us had connections to the civil rights movement. Each has been in the
public eye for decades. We have all held public office, two of us in
Atlanta. Two of us now live in Washington. Two are university
professors. Two of us--the youngest and eldest--have gray hair. Two
are tall.</TE>
<TE>   Most notably, we are all black--victims not only of mistaken
identity but also of the "blacks-all-look-alike" syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   The experience of being mistaken for another person based largely
on being the same race can range from the mildly annoying to the
nearly fatal, as a long list of convicted but ultimately exonerated
people can attest.</TE>
<TE>   For me, it began in 1976 when the Boston Globe reported that
then-presidential candidate Jimmy Carter "would have to do more than
bring Julian Bond to Boston" to prove his civil rights bona fides.
But it was Andrew Young, not Julian Bond, who accompanied Carter;
that year, I supported the Bay State's own Sen. Edward M. Kennedy for
president.</TE>
<TE>   From then until now, I've been blessed and cursed to be confused
with Wilkins and Young.</TE>
<TE>   "Hello, Mr. Mayor" is a common greeting I receive across the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Since Wilkins joined the Washington school board, I've been
thanked by many grateful citizens of the nation's capital for taking
on this difficult task.</TE>
<TE>   I've been credited with making "the best speech I ever heard" in
places I've never appeared. People I've never met have met me and
have tales to tell about our meeting. I've been a guest in homes I've
never visited and at banquet tables where I never dined.</TE>
<TE>   Wilkins once told me of a businessman who complained to him that
few blacks, except Julian Bond who sat with him, had attended the
Gridiron Club dinner the night before. In fact, it was Wilkins
himself who had graced the man's table.</TE>
<TE>   My knees have bounced children--now grown to adulthood--whom I've
never seen or held. Don't mention the women I've kissed whose lips
have never touched mine.</TE>
<TE>   And I've been praised for statements I've never made and books I
didn't write.</TE>
<TE>   It has happened so frequently that I've composed a
response--"Remember, Young is older; Bond is younger."</TE>
<TE>   I'm still working on a Wilkins phrase.</TE>
<TE>   (Full disclosure requires me to admit that one of us has
contributed, on at least one occasion, to this confusion. Emerging
from a clandestine location, he was greeted heartily by the name of a
second. He responded that he was actually the third of the apparently
interchangeable trio. That he was believed was confirmed when the
third was asked, a couple of decades later, to explain his presence
at the scene.)</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the New York Times reported I had "distanced" myself
from Rep. Cynthia A. McKinney (D.-Ga.) in her unsuccessful reelection
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, I had been confused with Andy Young--this time by a
reporter whom I have never met and with whom I have never talked.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, I have not lived in Atlanta for 14 years. I neither
supported nor opposed McKinney, despite her steadfast support for
NAACP issues, in this or any previous race, and therefore couldn't
"distance" myself from her. As NAACP board chairman, I am prohibited,
as is all our leadership, from engaging in partisan politics.</TE>
<TE>   In an apologetic voice mail message, the New York Times reporter
said she had written "former Atlanta Mayor Julian Bond." Her crack
copy desk, sensing a mistake, dropped "former Atlanta Mayor,"
replacing it with "Chairman of the NAACP."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, they should have dropped "Julian Bond" and replaced me
with "Andy Young." Young had previously endorsed McKinney and
declined to do so this year.</TE>
<TE>   Writing on an unrelated topic, New York Times columnist William
Safire recently said that the paper "willingly corrects itself when
in error." The New York Times did print a correction in my case, but
like all such journalistic admissions of inaccuracy, it was no doubt
seen by many fewer readers than the original mistake.</TE>
<TE>   The Times' error threatened public perception of the National
Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People. It placed me in a
political position I neither sought nor embraced. It was a new low in
the mistaken-identity department.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps in our age group, only a few African American names and
faces command public recognition, although many more should. Perhaps
as we've aged, Wilkins, Bond and Young look more alike than we
believe we do.</TE>
<TE>   If only whites made this mistake, it would be easy to infer
something insidious about racial attitudes. But as time has passed,
blacks have also confused me with other members of the trio, and them
with me, suggesting black interchangeability is becoming race
neutral.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe growing cross-racial misidentification is some odd signal of
racial progress? Perhaps a next step toward racial harmony will be
confusing prominent whites for blacks, and vice versa. Does this take
colorblindness to a new level?</TE>
<TE>   Whatever it all means, I have this to say: I'm not those other
guys. And they aren't me.</TE>

<BD>Marc Cooper is a contributing editor to The Nation and

<DL></DL>
<LD>George W. Bush seems fixed on going to war against Baghdad no matter
what. No matter if Iraq does or does not represent an actual threat.
No matter whether Saddam Hussein allows weapons inspectors in. No
matter what our allies think or what the regional fallout from such
an intervention might mean. No matter what the staggering cost of an
invasion would do to the U.S. economy. No matter how war with Iraq
might distract from the unfinished war against Al Qaeda. And with
Democratic opposition likely to evaporate--Al Gore's recent speech
notwithstanding--Bush's reckless war juggernaut seems unhindered.</LD>
<LD>   It sounds like a job for a peace movement.</LD>
<LD>   This is, I suspect, one of those seminal historic moments when the
American left can and should exercise an influence far beyond its
small numbers. Just as during the battles for civil rights in the
'50s and '60s and in the movement to halt the Vietnam War, the
humanistic and cooperative principles of the left could undergird and
lead the needed resistance to Bush's war plans.</LD>
<TE>   The left, after all, holds the high moral ground on this issue.
Long before either the current President Bush or his father
discovered just how evil Hussein is, progressives denounced his
dictatorial regime. During the 1980s, while Presidents Reagan and
Bush were playing footsie with Hussein, providing him with U.S.
intelligence and arranging weapons purchases for use in his war with
Iran, it was the international and domestic left, not the White
House, that was calling for "regime change" in Baghdad. No other
Middle Eastern leader has butchered nearly so many domestic leftists
as Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   The left also made the defense and independence of the Kurds
living under Hussein's heavy hand in northern Iraq a cause celebre.
When thousands of Kurds were killed by poison gas unleashed on them
by Hussein, the cries of protest from the Kurds' leftist supporters
contrasted mightily with the silence of the White House.</TE>
<TE>   So why is the left having such great difficulty responding
properly to the current crisis? Why is a broad-based peace movement
still struggling to be born? Why are we seeing such small and
ineffective peace protests?</TE>
<TE>   One problem is that too much of the American left has spent the
last year wandering in a political and moral desert. When this
country came together in shock and solidarity after Sept. 11, a
portion of the left effectively divorced itself from the American
body politic. Steeped in four decades' worth of a crude
anti-Americanism, it believed that the use of any American military
power was and would always be immoral. It couldn't accept, as other,
more mature segments of the left did, that a proportionate American
military response to Al Qaeda was not only justified but absolutely
necessary--not as an act of revenge but as a measure of public
safety. Any terrorist network that massacres massive numbers of
civilians must be smashed.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the knee-jerk faction of the left came up with every
possible bogus explanation for the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and
the Pentagon. Some said Osama bin Laden was purely an American
creation, that the U.S. somehow "deserved" this barbaric attack. They
refused to see the obvious: Sept. 11 was the handiwork of a
conspiracy of bloodthirsty religious fascists.</TE>
<TE>   Just days after the attack, with ground zero still smoking and the
search for bodies barely underway, this unhinged faction of the left
was already in the streets of Washington protesting the "racist"
American war, a war in which the first shot hadn't yet been fired.
And just about every dark prediction made by this faction a year ago
has proved false: The U.S. didn't get bogged down in Afghanistan. The
Taliban weren't 10 feet tall, and they folded after five weeks, not
15 years. American forces didn't carpet-bomb the Afghan countryside.
The post-Taliban government is better, not worse, than the one it
replaced. And not only were millions not killed, but some 1.7 million
Afghan refugees have streamed back home to live under the U.S.
"puppet government," the greatest inflow of refugees in decades.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, that same know-nothing part of the left is now
trying to lead the movement against a war in Iraq. And so we are
treated to the spectacle of former U.S. Atty. Gen. Ramsey Clark
(founder of a group called the International Action Center) pleading
on national television for peace in Iraq, but steadfastly refusing to
criticize Hussein when asked his opinion of the man. Indeed, twice
during that appearance, Clark referred to "poor, little Iraq." But
then again, why be surprised by these words from a man who is a proud
member of the International Committee to Defend Slobodan Milosevic?</TE>
<TE>   Clark and his followers are entitled to defend whatever dictators
they choose. But as the Beatles once warned, "if you go carrying
pictures of Chairman Mao, you ain't gonna make it with anyone,
anyhow." And carrying water for Milosevic or Hussein ain't gonna help
build the peace movement we now so desperately need.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, there are still a few progressives who can pat their
heads and rub their stomachs at the same time, who can criticize
Bush's single-minded push for war without becoming simple-mindedly
soft on Hussein. And it is these people who should now step into the
forefront of the peace movement and displace those who can only see
evil in America.</TE>
<TE>   To pose an effective, attractive and moral opposition to the
administration's rush to war, one that resonates with the instincts
and ideals of the American population, the full dimensions of the
standoff with Iraq must be honestly acknowledged. Yes, Bush is
exploiting war fever for domestic political purposes. But it's also
true that Hussein is a bloody tyrant and that the Iraqi people would
be much better off without him; he has violated many U.N.
resolutions; he continues to try to develop horrific weapons of mass
destruction; he cynically manipulated the U.N. weapons inspection
program and might again attempt to do so if it is reinstated.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, an effective peace movement must avoid linking
opposition to the war in Iraq with opposition to the war against Al
Qaeda. Just because Bush cynically folds one battle into the other is
no license for the left to engage in the same moral dubiousness. The
fight against Bin Laden's gang is necessary, and going to war against
Iraq can only detract from it.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, an effective peace movement must get its story straight
on sanctions. Clark calls them "genocidal." But the entire American
left supported similar painful sanctions against the apartheid state
of South Africa. If the left is not for war against Hussein and is
also opposed to economic sanctions, what is it for? If the left is
for containment instead of invasion, then isn't it the U.S. armed
forces that must do the containing? And what about the Kurds who,
under the umbrella of U.S. power, are now flourishing in one of the
most open societies in the region? If, at the end of the day, Hussein
does foil weapons inspections, what is to be done then? What are the
responsibilities of the international community in countenancing or
confronting a long-standing and dangerous dictator like Hussein?</TE>
<TE>   These are devilishly complex questions that deserve much more
meditation, debate and elaboration than the sort of bumper-sticker
answers provided by the White House. Or by Ramsey Clark.</TE>

<BD>Neal Gabler, a senior fellow at the Norman Lear Center
at USC Annenberg, is the author of "Life the Movie: How Entertainment
Conquered Reality."</BD>
<DL>AMAGANSETT, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>As the country braces for war with Iraq, there seems to be none of
the anxiety usually associated with impending conflict. Americans
seem not only sanguine; they appear confident and even eager to
fight. Polls show that a majority of Americans favor going after
Saddam Hussein alone, and that majority becomes overwhelming if the
United Nations is our umbrella.</LD>
<LD>   No doubt this is partly because the debate over the consequences
of war--potential casualties, the possible long-term occupation of
Iraq, the effect of the Iraqi war on the war against terrorism--has
yet to start in earnest. But it may also be partly the result of
another factor: After the highs of the war in Afghanistan wore off
and a period of drift and national purposelessness set in, the war
against Iraq promises to channel our collective energies and give us
something tangible around which to rally. Or put another way, war
brings clarity.</LD>
<TE>   Whatever the political and military reasons for going to war with
Iraq, this cultural one shouldn't be discounted. Countries are a
little like movies. They attract the largest audience and elicit the
most enthusiastic response when they provide the most compelling
narrative. One needn't be overly cynical to say that President Bush
realizes that, after 9/11, the country and his presidency need a
script. Even though, by most accounts, Saddam Hussein does not
constitute an imminent threat to us, a war against Iraq provides a
plot that will shape and direct the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Presidents once came to office having provided the electorate with
scripts that laid out grand plans. Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal
would vanquish the Depression. Harry Truman's Fair Deal would bring
about an egalitarian agenda for postwar America. Dwight D. Eisenhower
was elected on the promise that he would go to Korea and end the war
there, and that he would fight communism both within and outside
America. John F. Kennedy had his New Frontier, which was intended to
infuse the country with hope and vigor. In each case, it was no
accident that the candidate with the best plot, the most
comprehensive and inspiring program, wound up winning the election.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, though, presidential scriptwriting has become
attenuated. The old geographical, ethnic and ideological divisions
that used to sharpen the narrative, and focus and raise the electoral
stakes, have become fuzzy. In a country where Republicans and
Democrats are evenly matched in Washington and where economic and
ideological disputes have been blunted, candidates are reluctant to
lay out a national mission for fear they might offend some
constituency and tip the balance to their opponents. Today, electoral
politics is less a matter of attracting voters than of subtracting
them, which makes for timorous aspirants.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, in times of peace and prosperity, there is less
desire for a grand national narrative. If anything, Americans seem to
suspect that a national mission might upset the status quo--witness
President Clinton's unsuccessful push for a system of national health
care. The result is that candidates and presidents tend to focus on
the mechanics of getting elected, rather than on the larger meaning
of the election. The last presidential candidate--the last
president--who articulated a purpose for his administration was
Ronald Reagan. His successors just seemed to want to get into office
and stay there.</TE>
<TE>   Bush certainly fit that mold. Like his father, he was no foaming
ideologue wanting to change the nature and size of government, no
alarmist wanting to awaken the country to military threats, no
moralist wanting to recharge the country's spirit--though, like his
father, he espoused these things to endear himself to the Republican
right. Essentially, he was just a patrician with a fat Rolodex. Like
his father, he also had difficulty with the "vision thing"--the kind
of narrative amplitude that Reagan and others had brought to office
and the kind the country needs if it is to be stirred to action.</TE>
<TE>   About all Bush had to stir the American soul was a giant tax cut
that he claimed would make this a better country, though basically
all it did was further enrich the wealthy. It was, to say the least,
an uninspired script, and as he headed into the second year of his
administration, he had exhausted his one big idea and he was
floundering--the head of yet another presidency without a cause.</TE>
<TE>   All this was unfortunately magnified by the president's personal
history. Bush was our James Dean president--a young no-account who
had bounced from job to job with his father's safety net below him, a
hellion with an admitted drinking problem, intellectually incurious,
until he finally discovered how to parlay his geniality into
political hay. As president, he was a nice guy going nowhere.</TE>
<TE>   Then came 9/11. The president would probably be the first to admit
that the terrorist attacks on New York City and the Pentagon provided
him with what he and his strategists could not--a plot and a purpose.
Suddenly, as many observers noted at the time, Bush had a reason to
be in office. His was to be the presidency that would fight and
defeat global terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is, as narratives go, fighting terrorism is pretty
awful. It's not easy to convert the mess of destroying Al Qaeda into
a clean Hollywood script. Initially, Bush tried. He invoked the
rhetoric of the Old West ("Wanted Dead or Alive"); he declared that
he would hunt down the perpetrators no matter what it took; he
promised the swift justice of military tribunals. But the fact
remains that unless he brought home the hide of Osama bin Laden and
unless he dismantled Al Qaeda, this was going to be a story with a
horrifying beginning, an uplifting middle--the successful war in
Afghanistan--but a protracted and uncertain end, most likely one
warning of one potential terrorist attack after another.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, 9/11 has made clear the importance of a clean
national narrative. Americans both want and need to believe that the
lives lost on 9/11 were not lost in vain, that the deaths would be
avenged by U.S. action. Again, it's not that Americans continually
feel threatened by terrorists or that we are especially vengeful.
It's that we lack a satisfying plot. The war against terrorism
doesn't provide one.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, mindful of how drift undermined his father's presidency, may
have realized the insufficiency of the terrorism narrative in
focusing his presidency and rallying the country. He may also have
realized that there was an alternative script on the shelf. Saddam
Hussein has long been a favorite Bush target. During the 2000
campaign, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, then a Bush
consultant, even mentioned "regime change" in Iraq as a policy
objective. So, in a political bait-and-switch, the president
substituted the Iraq script for the terrorism one. Seamlessly, Saddam
Hussein replaced Bin Laden as Public Enemy No. 1. Iraq thus became
what Alfred Hitchcock once called a "MacGuffin"--something that
wasn't intrinsically important if you stopped to think about it but
that propelled the plot. The plot was the thing.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on whom you listen to, Iraq may or may not be
intrinsically important, but it certainly makes for a much better
plot for America and the administration than the war on terrorism. It
has a simple villain who will almost certainly either be killed or
brought into custody, not someone who may be dead in a cave or hiding
out on the Pakistan frontier. It has a clearly demarcated
battlefield, not the back alleys and tenements of Europe, Asia and
the Middle East. It has an army, not a ragtag group of fanatical
guerrillas and religious zealots. And it has an attainable objective
that will permit us to declare victory and demand surrender.</TE>
<TE>   Put these together and Iraq provides a conventional narrative,
like World War II, rather than a modern, unconventional narrative
like the war on terrorism, which is precisely the point. The war on
Iraq gives us the lineaments and the catharsis of a movie, the very
things the Bush presidency has so obviously lacked.</TE>
<TE>   So, in the end, there may be legitimate military and geopolitical
reasons to head off to war against Saddam Hussein, and the world
would be better off without him. But these things may matter far less
than the fact that regime change in Iraq is also a good, simple,
clearly defined cause for a country and for a presidency badly in
need of one.</TE>

<HD>New Rules Would Only Tighten Poverty's Grip</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HILFIKER</AU>
<BD>David Hilfiker has worked as a physician in Washington,
D.C., providing health care to the poor for 20 years. He is the
author of "Urban Injustice: How Ghettos Happen."</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Connie, a 25-year-old ex-welfare mother, will soon be earning $14 an
hour as a chef and cake decorator at a local Safeway. This will be
enough, at last, to support her two young boys.</LD>
<LD>   In 1996, hoping to get her high school equivalency diploma, she
came to Academy of Hope, an adult education school my wife founded in
Washington, D.C. But by 1999, she was ready to drop out under the
emotional strain of trying to go to school full time and make ends
meet. Her welfare check and food stamps added up to a yearly income
of only $7,440, about half the official poverty level for a family of
three.</LD>
<LD>   Connie was a gifted cook and had long dreamed of becoming a chef.
She knew that the $7-dollar-an-hour jobs available to even a high
school graduate (which she wasn't) don't bring small families out of
poverty. Since she was intelligent, had worked hard in school and
seemed utterly determined, my wife and I began offering her some
modest financial support so she could continue her studies. She
received her GED a year later.</LD>
<TE>   Soon she had secured a scholarship, gotten a federal loan and
enrolled in a 15-month culinary arts program. We continued to offer
financial support. Noticing that Connie was now able to pay her bills
on time, welfare officials grew suspicious. Everyone knows you can't
live on a welfare check, so if she was able to make ends meet, she
must be receiving other income, which is strictly forbidden. As a
penalty, her food stamp allowance was reduced.</TE>
<TE>   In late 2001, she finally graduated as a chef, near the top of her
class. In the deepening recession, it then took her a while to find a
daytime job as a chef and to arrange for child care. She's not out of
the woods yet, and still needs a little help from us, but Connie will
make it.</TE>
<TE>   She is the lucky exception. It has been six years since Congress
passed the Welfare Reform Act, promising to "end welfare as we know
it." This promise now threatens to become a far grimmer reality than
legislators dreamed possible in the boom year of 1996. Congress is
now supposed to reauthorize the act before it expires tomorrow. You
will be forgiven for not having noticed this, as poverty has long
been off the national agenda. But struggling families and poverty are
still very much with us.</TE>
<TE>   Connie's story, while inspiring, is far from typical. Yes, there
are many mothers "successfully" moving from welfare to work under
welfare reform, but most won't be earning nearly enough to bring
their families out of poverty. Although welfare reform has been
declared a smashing success because it has more than halved the
number of families receiving financial assistance, the overwhelming
majority of those who have left the rolls do not earn enough to leave
poverty behind. Connie would probably not have made it, either,
without extra financial help.</TE>
<TE>   The 1996 welfare reform bill wiped out the 60-year-old entitlement
to financial assistance that federal law had promised poor families,
replacing it with a program accurately titled Temporary Assistance to
Needy Families. Under the new system, any financial assistance,
however temporary, requires the recipient's participation in 30 hours
per week of "work-related activities," which can include education
and vocational training. After 60 months (less in many states),
financial assistance is cut off. Recipients who do not meet even the
most technical requirements of the program can also be "sanctioned"
by having benefits reduced or, more commonly, eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   The 60-month limit and sanctions have been devastating for many.
Despite the economic boom of the '90s, the average income of those
who remain poor has fallen since passage of the bill. For women who
have left the welfare rolls and are working, the median wage is a
mere $7.15 an hour and--because most cannot find full-time,
year-round work--annual earnings are around $10,000, not enough to
bring the smallest family out of poverty.</TE>
<TE>   The Welfare Reform Act did have one truly positive innovation: It
gave states great leeway in designing education, training and work
support programs. Some--like California and Michigan--used this
flexibility well to provide things tailored to the needs of the
recipient, like child care, transportation assistance, substance
abuse treatment, continuing Medicaid coverage and some welfare
benefits while working. It was child-care support and the flexibility
to attend classes in lieu of work that enabled Connie to get her
training.</TE>
<TE>   But instead of building on this kind of flexibility by encouraging
the remaining states to develop innovative programs that meet the
needs of their recipients, President Bush has proposed tightening
work requirements and limiting state flexibility in the welfare
reauthorization bill. The White House wants to define "work-related
activities" very narrowly, which would functionally curtail a
majority of the most successful current state programs. It's an odd
tactic for a president who comes from a party that has traditionally
espoused states' rights rather than centralized federal control. But
the restrictive proposal was picked up by House Republicans and
passed on a strict party-line vote.</TE>
<TE>   Under the House bill, further education, vocational training,
substance abuse treatment, or other programs designed to address
individual barriers to employment would be limited to three months in
any two-year period, or the states would lose credit for
"work-related activity." After the three months, mothers would have
to go to work, ready or not. Furthermore, if they couldn't find jobs
after that three-month period, states would essentially be forced to
employ them in unpaid "workfare" programs, an approach that has been
shown to be ineffective in promoting actual employment. In addition,
all welfare recipients would have to work 40 hours a week or states
would again lose credit. The current, common practice of allowing
mothers with children under 6 months old to work part-time would not
be allowed. A less-draconian Senate version of the bill has been
proposed, but the president has threatened a veto if that version is
sent to him.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last six years, the most successful states have tailored
their programs to the individual needs of the recipients, providing
GED education, specific job training, or even counseling for domestic
abuse. The earnings of California recipients of temporary assistance
who attended community college programs, for instance, increased
markedly after the program, but the largest gains were for those who
completed vocational certificates or received associate's degrees,
which take much longer than 12 months to complete. The president's
proposal as passed by the House would not give credit for such
programs. Of the 26 acceptable work-related activities in Minnesota's
successful Family Investment Program, for instance, the House bill
would disqualify 21.</TE>
<TE>   Nor, under the House bill, would Connie have been able to get her
GED or attend the culinary arts program. She would likely be working
for much less money with little hope of making ends meet.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, instead of reducing benefits to women trying to get
off welfare, Congress should increase those benefits--especially work
supports--that have been successful. Research has shown that
providing reliable child care is essential in moving mothers from
welfare to work. But the current temporary assistance program
provides less than 15% of the needed child-care support.
Reauthorization should be seen as an opportunity to increase such
support substantially.</TE>
<TE>   Even the president has called for $1 billion more for child care.
Unfortunately, the tightened work requirements of his proposal will,
according to the Congressional Budget Office, increase state costs by
more than $11 billion, while providing no extra funds to meet these
costs, so the $1 billion will quickly be eaten away. In practice, the
bill will keep states from providing even the current inadequate
level of child-care support. In the context of a Welfare Reform Act
that originally felt more like punishment than an aiding hand to the
poor, the president's proposal can only be considered even more
punitive.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, the Senate proposal, while hardly ideal, at least
retains far more state flexibility, does not include unfunded
mandates and provides $5 billion more for child care--still
inadequate but far better than the House bill. Since the Senate bill
is already a compromise between Republicans and Democrats, the
House-Senate conference committee should scrap the ultra-punitive
House bill in favor of the Senate's.</TE>
<TE>   Forty percent of families who left the temporary assistance
program have already dropped into even deeper poverty. How many of
them would, like Connie, make it if only they had the needed support?
Isn't that the least a compassionate country's welfare program should
provide?</TE>

<HD>Containment Has Run Its Course</HD>

<AU>ROBERT J. LIEBER</AU>
<BD>Robert J. Lieber is professor of government and foreign
service at Georgetown University. He is editor and contributor author
of "Eagle Rules? Foreign Policy and American Primacy in the 21st
Century."</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Critics of the use of force against Saddam Hussein say the Iraqi
leader can instead be contained. They concede he's a murderous despot
but contend that he's not suicidal. They believe that if Hussein
launched a chemical, biological or nuclear attack against Israel,
other neighbors or the U.S., he would invite devastating retaliation.
As a result, he is deterred from using his weapons of mass
destruction as instruments to achieve regional dominance, in the same
way that the Soviet Union was discouraged from using its nuclear
weapons during the Cold War.</LD>
<LD>   But the Sept. 11 attacks have severely undercut containment as a
way to handle Hussein, for many reasons. The terrorist attacks on
America highlighted dangerous new realities. Geography no longer
protects the United States. Individuals and groups are prepared to
carry out mass murder against us without the slightest moral scruple;
some are willing to sacrifice their own lives in doing so. Even more
ominously, there is little reason to believe that the Sept. 11
attackers would not have used weapons of mass destruction had they
possessed them.</LD>
<TE>   Saddam Hussein's Iraq has long served as a safe harbor for
terrorists, even if the exact nature of its links to Al Qaeda remains
murky. Last week, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice revealed
that high-ranking Al Qaeda detainees have acknowledged that Iraq
trained some of their members in the development of chemical weapons.
Iraq has maintained a terrorist facility at Salman Pak near Baghdad,
where an old Boeing 707 passenger airplane is used in training
hijackers. The regime sheltered the notorious terrorist Abu Nidal,
whose "suicide" was recently announced by Baghdad, and, in 1993, Iraq
tried to assassinate former President Bush during a trip to Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   Besides its ties to terrorists, Iraq has produced large quantities
of potential terrorist weapons, among them the deadly VX nerve gas
and weaponized anthrax. For more than two decades, Iraq has pursued a
covert program to develop nuclear weapons. Given Hussein's obsessive
hatred of the United States, it would be irresponsible to assume that
he would forgo an opportunity to supply terrorists with chemical or
biological weapons, or even a nuclear device, for an attack on the
U.S. if the origin of the weapon could be concealed.</TE>
<TE>   Containment is a risky defense against a man of Hussein's
character. He rose through the ranks of the Baath Party as a hit man.
He has brutalized his own country, possibly murdering as many as
200,000 people. He revels in the torture and execution of opponents,
real or imagined, in his own military and party. Family members have
been among his victims.</TE>
<TE>   His tactical successes cannot conceal his penchant for dangerous
miscalculation. In September 1980, he launched a war with Iran that
nearly resulted in his own defeat. The eight-year conflict inflicted
great damage on Iraq and killed as many as 1 million people in the
two countries. He used chemical weapons against Iranians and his own
population.</TE>
<TE>   Before his march into Kuwait, Hussein threatened to "burn half of
Israel." In 1990-91, the invasion of Kuwait proved disastrous to him
and his people when the Iraqi leader refused to withdraw after the
U.S. assembled an international coalition and deployed overwhelming
force in the Persian Gulf. During the Gulf War, he fired Scud
missiles at Saudi Arabia and Israel. At other times, he has
threatened Jordan. Arab diplomats report that Hussein's staff gives
him only the information he prefers to hear.</TE>
<TE>   Is it not wishful thinking to hope that a man with this record can
be relied upon to make the rational strategic calculations or
exercise the restraint and prudence that advocates of deterrence and
containment assume?</TE>
<TE>   Finally, a policy of containment is no match for a nuclear
capability in the hands of a man of Hussein's character. The evidence
of Hussein's dogged pursuit of nuclear weapons is incontrovertible.
Before they were thrown out of Iraq in 1998, U.N. inspection teams
found evidence of a nuclear program whose size exceeded the estimates
of even the most pessimistic foreign intelligence agencies. The
findings made a mockery of the pre-1990 inspections by the
International Atomic Energy Agency, which gave Iraq a clean bill of
health.</TE>
<TE>   To keep his nuclear program alive, Hussein has defied no fewer
than 16 successive U.N. Security Council resolutions demanding his
compliance with inspections. Iraq has forfeited some $150 billion in
oil revenues because it has refused to meet its disarmament
obligations. If U.N. economic sanctions, periodic punishment by U.S.
and British airstrikes in the no-fly zone, and the heavy costs of
noncompliance have not persuaded Hussein to abandon his nuclear
program, why believe that he can be deterred once he actually has
obtained the weapons?</TE>
<TE>   And that day may not be far off. Hussein's engineers have the
ability to construct a nuclear weapon much more rapidly if Iraq can
obtain enriched uranium or plutonium from foreign sources, such as
the former Soviet Union or South Africa. In such a case, the best
intelligence estimates suggest Hussein could have his nuclear weapon
within a year, or even a matter of months. Still more ominously, the
Federation of American Scientists has estimated that Iraq could
construct its nuclear device in total secrecy.</TE>
<TE>   A nuclear-armed Hussein would have been far harder to dislodge
from Kuwait in 1991. Indeed, it's doubtful that a military effort to
oust him would even have been undertaken. A nuclear-armed Hussein
today or in the near future could be counted on to bully his
neighbors and strive to dominate the entire region. The ability of
the U.S. or the United Nations to deter such action would be greatly
reduced, for who would want to threaten to use force against a regime
equipped with nuclear weapons and led by a dictator who has shown
himself to be both ruthless and rash?</TE>
<TE>   George F. Kennan, architect of the containment doctrine, writing
more than half a century ago, envisioned a measured strategy to block
the expansion of the Soviet Union until its communist leaders
mellowed. Hussein shows no signs of mellowing. While there are
undeniable risks in using force against him, the risks of doing
nothing and of allowing him to acquire nuclear weapons, or to use his
existing chemical and biological weapons, are more dire.</TE>
<TE>   A policy of containment against Iraq assumes that time is on our
side. In fact, time is running out.</TE>

<HD>In California, Politicians Choose--and Voters Lose</HD>

<AU>TONY QUINN</AU>
<BD>Tony Quinn is co-editor of the California Target Book,
a nonpartisan analysis of California's congressional and legislative
elections.</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>What if the World Series had been played during spring training, the
commissioner of baseball having picked the competing teams? Baseball
fans would be outraged. Yet something similar has happened to
California elections. In the vast majority of legislative and
congressional districts, we have no general election contests this
fall because the races were decided in the spring primaries. The
political stadium is dark.</LD>
<LD>   How many competitive races for the House of Representatives are
there in the Southland? None. How many competitive races for the
state Senate? None. How many for the Assembly? Two--at most.</LD>
<LD>   According to the California Target Book, which analyzes
congressional and legislative races in the state, there are nine
hotly competitive elections this fall out of 153 districts. There are
another nine potential contests if the challenger can raise
sufficient funds. Put another way, in only 18 of California's 153
districts--12% of the state--will voters have a choice on who
represents them in the Legislature and Congress.</LD>
<TE>   How did California end up with this system of representation
without elections?</TE>
<TE>   California legislative politics are a three-legged stool: term
limits, gerrymandered districts and the closed primary. While term
limits have eviscerated seniority and institutional memory in the
Legislature, they have produced turnover, which explains their strong
public support. Every attempt to overturn or modify term limits has
failed, including a ploy during the spring primaries to keep the last
of the pre-term-limits legislators in office a little longer.</TE>
<TE>   The public seems to understand that only because of term limits
does it have any choice at all, since every cycle one-third of the
Assembly and one-quarter of the Senate are termed out. Term limits at
least allow political choice; the other two legs of California
politics restrict it.</TE>
<TE>   Gerrymandered districts especially restrict voter choice.
Redistricting, which occurred in 2001, is a process whereby the
politicians choose the voters. The fall elections will be the first
using the new political maps, and they were drawn with great care to
segregate voters so that almost every seat is safe for the incumbent
party. We have a "bipartisan apartheid" in legislative and
congressional districts: Democrats are in Democratic districts,
Republicans are in Republican ones.</TE>
<TE>   As a consequence, virtually every district, even those that term
limits open up, was decided in the spring primaries. Only a handful
were not decided in March, and it's not that the map makers didn't
try to make them safe too. Seven of the nine hotly contested
legislative and congressional districts are in California's Central
Valley, running roughly from Bakersfield to Stockton (four of the
seven seats include parts of the city of Stockton). Although they
hacked up Stockton, the map drawers could not find enough safe
territory to make all the districts safe.</TE>
<TE>   So, we have the absurd situation in which Stockton, a city of
244,000, is the last, best hope for electoral democracy in
California, with more political contests for Congress and the
Legislature in the general election than all of Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   That's why the primary was so important: Real decisions were made.
Term limits forced out 31 Assembly members and seven senators. One
more district opened up when Assemblyman Phil Wyman (R-Tehachapi)
lost his primary. But according to the California Target Book, all
but nine winners were decided in the primary. Essentially, we have
had a shadow Legislature waiting since last March to take office,
with 30 new legislators awaiting pro-forma election in November.</TE>
<TE>   They were elected at a primary with few voters participating. Only
34.6% of registered voters cast ballots last March, the lowest
election turnout in California's history. That amounted to 5.2
million of the 15.3 million registered to vote and the 21.5 million
people eligible to vote.</TE>
<TE>   That brings us to the third leg of the state's political stool,
the closed primary. Thanks to a U.S. Supreme Court decision throwing
out California's former open-primary law, the March elections were
once again limited to registered partisans (and the small number of
decline-to-state voters who asked for a partisan ballot).</TE>
<TE>   If redistricting is the process whereby politicians choose the
voters, a closed primary is the process whereby unwanted voters are
weeded out. Combine gerrymandered districts with the closed-primary
system and a legislator never has to worry about any voters other
than his or her most solid partisans. They are the people who vote in
primary elections.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer than half the voters could participate in many primary
elections. Voters not registered with the dominant party in a safe
district cannot participate in that party's primary election. That
means candidates need only campaign to their own die-hard partisans.</TE>
<TE>   That's what a politician likes--the fewer voters, the better, and
especially if they are the most partisan ones. Candidates beat their
breasts about what hard-core partisans they are, and the tiny number
of people who go to the polls respond by electing the most hard-core
partisans in both parties.</TE>
<TE>   The result is a largely dysfunctional Legislature. Members chosen
in a closed primary, with a minimum of voters participating, come to
Sacramento intent on representing the narrow partisan positions that
got them there.</TE>
<TE>   Is it any wonder they cannot negotiate a state budget? Passing the
budget--it was two months late this year--is the most important and
most difficult thing a legislator does because it requires compromise
and negotiation. The current system encourages exactly the opposite.</TE>
<TE>   One Republican who might have broken the budget impasse this
summer privately told friends, "Look, I can't afford to cross my
primary voters; they demand that I hang tough." The sentiment was the
same on the Democratic side. A look at the shadow Legislature elected
in March shows future members will be even more ideologically rigid.</TE>
<TE>   Californians might remember this when they cast their meaningless
votes in November for their preordained members of the
Legislature--if they bother to vote at all.</TE>

<HD>E. Timor Points a Way for Mideast</HD>
<DH>Strong U.N. action can lead to a peaceful transfer of
power.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>IAN URBINA</AU>
<BD>Ian Urbina is associate editor of the Middle East
Report, a publication of the Middle East Resarch and Information
Project.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>This past week the U.N. momentarily turned its attention away from
the Middle East to congratulate itself on a job well done on the
other side of the globe. There was much reason for pride, as
delegates ushered in East Timor as the newest member of the
international body.</LD>
<LD>   Only three years ago, the small island north of Australia was
being ravaged by increasing bloodshed and a brutal Indonesian
military occupation. But thanks to the role of armed peacekeepers,
the U.N., equipped with a clear political mandate and a strict
timetable for implementation, succeeded in ending the conflict,
dismantling a decades-long occupation and setting this century's
first new democracy on its feet.</LD>
<LD>   East Timor's flag now joins that of 190 other member nations--but
before the international community moves on, it should pause and
reflect on the lessons learned. As the conflict in Israel and the
Palestinian territories again heats up, and solutions seem further
away by the day, the case of East Timor may have some feasible
instruction to offer.</LD>
<TE>   In 1975, Indonesia invaded the small Portuguese enclave of East
Timor, initiating a military occupation that killed an estimated
200,000 people, close to one-third of the population. The United
Nations intervened to conduct a 1999 referendum, in which the
nation's people voted overwhelmingly for independence. After
widespread violence broke out in response to the vote, the U.N.
dispatched 8,000 troops to establish security and ensure a full
withdrawal of the Indonesian military and local militias. The U.N.
then created a transitional government to administer the territory,
exercise executive and legislative authority and support the process
of state-building.</TE>
<TE>   The intervention was generally successful, especially considering
that this was the first time the international body has run a
country. Not only did the U.N. help establish an independent justice
system, backed by an impartial police force (one-third of whom are
women), it also helped train 11,000 civil servants to run the
country, fewer than half the bloated number under Indonesian rule.</TE>
<TE>   The modest but highly professional defense force that the U.N.
helped train to patrol the East Timorese borders offered the
beginnings of a restored sense of security to the beleaguered nation.
But one of the U.N.'s most important successes in East Timor was
keeping to an ambitious timetable of progressively delegating
responsibility for education, health and other services to local
leadership, handing over the reins in full after only 33 months of
transitional rule.</TE>
<TE>   In the Palestinian territories, a U.N. intervention would need a
clear political mandate, codified in a Security Council resolution,
to end the occupation and stop the killing of civilians. As in East
Timor, peacekeepers would need the power to disarm and arrest those
from either side who would disrupt peace, and the intervention would
adhere to a strict timetable, at the end of which would be a
sovereign Palestinian state, with secure borders respected by all
parties.</TE>
<TE>   These would be preconditions for reestablishing good-faith
negotiations, under U.N. supervision, to resolve issues of refugees,
Jerusalem and water. The accomplishments of the transitional
government in East Timor indicate that the U.N. is equipped to
provide the space and oversight for a Palestinian-led reform movement
in any effort to elect leaders, adopt a constitution, reform the
financial system and overhaul the security forces.</TE>
<TE>   With U.N. assistance, the settlement process, too, is reversible.
As one of the most densely populated countries on the globe,
Indonesia suffers from severe overcrowding, and it was mainly
economics--not religion or politics--that drove more than 100,000
Indonesian settlers to migrate to East Timor. Recent studies indicate
that the same is generally true for the settlers in the Palestinian
territories. A largely overlooked poll released in July by the
Israeli organization Peace Now found that for 77% of the settlers it
was not ideology but "quality of life" issues, such as cheap land
prices, tax breaks and reduced mortgages, that brought them to the
West Bank. The poll also found that 68% of settlers said they would
leave immediately and peacefully if the Israeli government demanded
it. These statistics betray a pragmatic and hopeful pro- spect: With
the right combination of financial incentives and political will, a
peaceful withdrawal is possible.</TE>
<TE>   The process would not be easy. For more than 20 years, the
official, if unenforced, U.S. position has been to oppose new
settlements. For even longer, the U.N. has pointed to their
illegality under international law. But the Israeli population in the
West Bank has steadily increased, topping 200,000 in the most recent
count, plus about 175,000 who live on territory annexed by the city
of Jerusalem. Left to its own accord, Israel, like Indonesia, will
not institute a withdrawal. Pressure from the U.N. will be required,
and peacekeepers will need to assume the tasks of evacuating settlers
and dismantling the settlements--both likely to be politically
impossible for any Israeli government to do by itself.</TE>
<TE>   This type of intervention can only occur with U.S. support. In the
case of East Timor, the Indonesian government long refused to permit
a U.N.-backed peacekeeping force to enter the fray. The U.S.
supported Indonesia for decades, but as the occupation received more
attention, the U.S. shifted its position, eventually severing
economic and military aid. Within days of that action, the Indonesian
government reversed its stance and peacekeepers were en route.</TE>
<TE>   Since the start of the recent wave of Mideast violence, the U.N.
has drafted several proposals for an intervention, but the U.S. has
vetoed each one. If calm is to be restored, the U.S. will have to
help facilitate U.N. involvement by exerting a pressure similar to
that it eventually applied on Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from U.N. intervention, another important factor in ending
the occupation of East Timor was the grass-roots international
solidarity movement whose tireless work in cities across the
globe--staging protests, teach-ins, film festivals and letter-writing
campaigns--helped mobilize international public opinion. The strength
of this solidarity movement was in part a result of the wisdom of the
leadership of the East Timor resistance, which engaged in a largely
nonviolent struggle.</TE>
<TE>   But Yasser Arafat's leadership is a far cry from that of East
Timor's Jose Alexandre "Xanana" Gusmao. The prospect for an end to
the Israeli occupation endures despite, not because of, the
Palestinian leadership. The Palestinian Authority's lack of strategic
vision has ceded the struggle to a logic of retribution. The morally
bankrupt and politically counterproductive suicide bombings add a
significant barrier to the already uphill battle of the international
solidarity movement working for a military withdrawal from
Palestinian areas.</TE>
<TE>   Still, hope must not be abandoned in the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict; nor should the exclusive focus on Iraq delay much longer a
reengagement of the U.N. in the steadily deteriorating situation in
the Palestinian territories. On the eve of the 1999 U.N. intervention
in East Timor, the situation seemed beyond repair, and the
international community had opted to look the other way. Three short
years later, there stands a sovereign and democratic nation joining
the U.N., a nation well on its way to full reconciliation with its
former adversary. Let's not let things get even worse in the Middle
East before taking decisive action.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was a time, long ago in genteel old Pasadena, when supporting
an orphanage was occasion for the social event of the season.</LD>
<LD>   A 1921 costume ball--held as a fund-raiser for the Pasadena
Children's Training Society--was "one of the most gorgeous and
picturesque affairs ever given in Pasadena," according to the
Pasadena Evening Post.</LD>
<LD>   "With well-known society women and popular debutantes garbed in
gorgeous costumes, impersonating the famous beauties of history," the
ball, with more than 2,000 attendees, was "the largest and most
successful ever given in Pasadena."</LD>
<TE>   These days, charity events where the well-heeled masquerade as
warrior queens and high priestesses are presumably a thing of the
past. And support for agencies catering to the children society has
left behind is derived more from governmental sources than
cotillions.</TE>
<TE>   But the work continues for the Children's Training Society, which
was renamed the Sycamores in the late 1960s after the move from a
two-story building in central Pasadena to a leafy campus in northwest
Altadena.</TE>
<TE>   Once a place where babies were left on the front steps by parents
unable to care for them, the organization, which celebrates its 100th
anniversary this year, is flourishing, providing a range of social
services for Pasadena-area children and families in need.</TE>
<TE>   The programs vary widely--a residential center for boys removed
from their families; three community-based group homes; two
non-public schools for children with special needs; a mental health
program run in partnership with the Pasadena Unified School District;
a transitional living program for foster youths who have reached 18;
and a neighborhood-based family resource center. In all, the
Sycamores estimates that it reaches more than 1,500 children and
families a year.</TE>
<TE>   "We see ourselves as facilitating opportunities for the community
and being available to them," said Debbie Manners, vice president of
programs at the Sycamores.</TE>
<TE>   The family resource center, in northwest Pasadena, offers
tutoring, recreational activities for children and English as a
second language classes and computer instruction for parents.</TE>
<TE>   Judith Barhydt, director of special education for the Pasadena
Unified School District, said the nearly 100-year partnership between
the Sycamores and the school district is, today, "collaborative and
broad-based."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Barhydt said, the Sycamores helped students, teachers
and staff deal with a series of tragedies that befell students during
the last academic year. "Whenever we have a need for support for a
crisis," Barhydt said, "we call one person at the Sycamores, and they
send a team. They are at home with the family, at the hospital, with
the teachers, with the kids. That's another important partnership."</TE>
<TE>   To maintain its intricate web of social services, the Sycamores
employs 500 people at 13 sites throughout the Pasadena area. The
Sycamores' annual budget hovers around $25 million--most of which
comes from government funding. The $1 million that is raised each
year from private sources goes directly to enrichment programs.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, an artist-in-residence worked with a group of boys
living at the treatment facility to produce papier-mache masks--a
project, said Sycamores president and chief executive William P.
Martone, that allowed the boys to find an outlet for their feelings
while honing their artistic skills. The masks were displayed this
summer in a gallery at the Armory Center for the Arts in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the Sycamores is expanding its enrichment offerings--in
part to bring the arts to children who might otherwise never be
exposed to them, and in part to offer the boys glimpses of career
possibilities. Exploring Music, a project of the Sycamores and the
Pasadena POPS Orchestra, introduced boys at the residential facility
to orchestral music. A photography project, cooking classes and
horticultural lessons are planned.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of what's been lost in our society is the craftsman,
apprenticeship aspect," Martone said. "That's dying away. We are
looking at bringing some of those people to come back, get some kids
interested."</TE>
<TE>   At a recent session in the Sycamores' Altadena campus recreation
room, Pasadena Pops conductor Rachael Worby held 25 boys rapt for
nearly an hour as she and three musicians coaxed music out of bongos,
a snare drum, cymbals, a timpani, a tambourine, xylophones and even a
whoopee cushion. Later in the week, the boys helped the orchestra set
up for a performance at Descanso Gardens and then sat at the concert
in the front row, as Worby's guests.</TE>
<TE>   "There are lots of ways that people grow and change," Worby said.
"But to see these young men emerge on so many different levels in the
face of the one thing which has helped me lead a charmed
life--music--completes a circle for me that nothing else completes.
It means that I am able to impact the parts of this world which
otherwise are left to lay fallow far too often."</TE>
<TE>   For Alicia, 18, who moved into a Sycamores-supported transitional
living facility in January after she graduated from the foster care
system, the Sycamores is providing a different sort of lifeline: a
chance at independent living, with assistance.</TE>
<TE>   The agency secured a lease on an apartment for her and charges her
rent on a graduated scale that increases as she gets closer to 21. A
case manager offers support on everything from balancing a checkbook
to coping with depression. Alicia is working full time at Kinko's,
she said, and plans to begin nursing school in January.</TE>
<TE>   "By the time I'm 21," she said, "I want to be on my own."</TE>
<TE>   For now, though, the Sycamores, she said, helps "with the little
small things: normal skills for a person who is on their own. Just a
little more."</TE>

living at the treatment facility to produce papier-mache masks--a
project, said Sycamores president and chief executive William P.
Martone, that allowed the boys to find an outlet for their feelings
while honing their artistic skills. The masks were displayed this
summer in a gallery at the Armory Center for the Arts in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the Sycamores is expanding its enrichment offerings--in
part to bring the arts to children who might otherwise never be
exposed to them, and in part to offer the boys glimpses of career
possibilities. Exploring Music, a project of the Sycamores and the
Pasadena POPS Orchestra, introduced boys at the residential facility
to orchestral music. A photography project, cooking classes and
horticultural lessons are planned.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of what's been lost in our society is the craftsman,
apprenticeship aspect," Martone said. "That's dying away. We are
looking at bringing some of those people to come back, get some kids
interested."</TE>
<TE>   At a recent session in the Sycamores' Altadena campus recreation
room, Pasadena Pops conductor Rachael Worby held 25 boys rapt for
nearly an hour as she and three musicians coaxed music out of bongos,
a snare drum, cymbals, a timpani, a tambourine, xylophones and even a
whoopee cushion. Later in the week, the boys helped the orchestra set
up for a performance at Descanso Gardens and then sat at the concert
in the front row, as Worby's guests.</TE>
<TE>   "There are lots of ways that people grow and change," Worby said.
"But to see these young men emerge on so many different levels in the
face of the one thing which has helped me lead a charmed
life--music--completes a circle for me that nothing else completes.
It means that I am able to impact the parts of this world which
otherwise are left to lay fallow far too often."</TE>
<TE>   For Alicia, 18, who moved into a Sycamores-supported transitional
living facility in January after she graduated from the foster care
system, the Sycamores is providing a different sort of lifeline: a
chance at independent living, with assistance.</TE>
<TE>   The agency secured a lease on an apartment for her and charges her
rent on a graduated scale that increases as she gets closer to 21. A
case manager offers support on everything from balancing a checkbook
to coping with depression. Alicia is working full time at Kinko's,
she said, and plans to begin nursing school in January.</TE>
<TE>   "By the time I'm 21," she said, "I want to be on my own."</TE>
<TE>   For now, though, the Sycamores, she said, helps "with the little
small things: normal skills for a person who is on their own. Just a
little more."</TE>

<SE>ENRIQUE'S JOURNEY: This is one of four pieces that appeared on the L.A.
Times web site as
part of the six-part series chronicling the journey of Enrique, who
traveled alone from Honduras as a teenager in search of his mother.</SE>

not publish in the paper.]</LD>

<LD>   "If you have money, they let you go," says Carlos Roberto, 17,
pressing against the bars of his cell at the municipal police station
in Tapachula, Mexico. Three times in four days, he says, officers
stopped him and took 20 pesos, or about $2.</LD>
<TE>   Finally, when he ran out of money, he says, they arrested him.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1999 Mexican study, "Migration Between Mexico's Two Borders,"
a coalition of professors and migrant support groups says officers
from a dozen law enforcement agencies, including immigration
authorities, hunt for migrants and rob them as they move north
through Mexico to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   At Mexico's Interior Ministry, Javier Moctezuma Barragan,
undersecretary of Population, Migration and Religious Affairs, who
oversees immigration officers, says the administration of Mexican
President Vicente Fox has taken steps to curb corruption. "I think we
have made some progress," he says. "We hope that the corruption has
gone down, but we hope it will go down more."</TE>
<TE>   Police agencies deny that their own officers rob migrants,
although some accuse officers from other agencies of doing it. "The
judicial police stop the train to rob the immigrants, pure and
simple," says Reyder Cruz Toledo, chief of the municipal police in
Arriaga, a town along the railroad in the southern state of Chiapas.</TE>
<TE>   Genaro Garcia Luna, national director of the Agencia Federal de
Investigacion, the judicial police, did not respond to requests for
comment. But Sixto Juarez, the AFI chief in Arriaga, says his agency
focuses on investigating federal crimes, much like the FBI, and that
migrants do not fall under his purview.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I have one rotten officer," Juarez says.</TE>
<TE>   Some denials are not so absolute. Elias Gonzales Gomez, a
municipal police commander in Tapahcula, where Carlos was jailed,
says allegations that the police rob immigrants are not true. He adds
that Tapachula's 400 officers earn only about $210 a month. "Maybe,"
he says, "there are a few bad ones."</TE>
<TE>   A cleric who helps migrants says robbery under the color of
authority is pervasive. "Se han suelto aqui los perros," says Father
Flor Maria Rigoni, at the Albergue Belen migrant shelter in
Tapachula. "The dogs have been set loose on these people."</TE>
<TE>   By the time immigrants get to Tapachula, just 12 miles across the
Guatemalan border into Chiapas, Father Rigoni says, 80% of those who
stop at his shelter have been robbed, beaten or victimized by
extortion, often by Mexican law enforcement officers.</TE>
<TE>   Abuse by law enforcement is so pervasive, says Jorge Reinoso, head
of Ferrocarriles Chiapas-Mayab, the railroad in southern Mexico, that
he has seen fighting between municipal and state police officers over
who gets to rob a particular group of migrants.</TE>
<TE>   In Nuevo Laredo, Leonicio Alejandro Hernandez, 33, says four
municipal officers approached him on the banks of the Rio Grande and
said, "We charge 1,000 pesos [$100] to cross this river."</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez balked, and the officers lowered their price. "If you
don't give us 500 pesos, 10 days in jail!" he says one yelled.</TE>
<TE>   He says another warned, "Throw yourself into the river, and I'll
kill you."</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez says he paid them and swam away.</TE>
<TE>   Octavio Lozano Gamez, the municipal police chief in Nuevo Laredo,
acknowledges that of his 720 employees, "a small minority of police
officers in the city have this problem of robbing people."</TE>
<TE>   Lozano doubts, however, that even his corrupt officers would pick
poor immigrants to rob. "Any smart police would seek out someone with
more money, gold chains, wristwatches."</TE>

<LD>   Tracker Charles Grout can spot a footprint from a moving Ford
Bronco. His partner, Manuel Sauceda, can tell, within a range of a
few hours, how old it is.</LD>
<TE>   They are agents for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service based in Cotulla, Texas, halfway along a seven- to eight-day
walk between the Rio Grande at Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, and San Antonio.
Their job is to arrest immigrants who enter Texas illegally.</TE>
<TE>   Salary increases for Grout, 40, and Sauceda, 36, are based
partly on how many immigrants they catch. They work together, along
railroads and in the desert, taking turns tracking on foot and
driving ahead in the Bronco, sometimes for days.</TE>
<TE>   One Thursday in September 2000, Sauceda discovers footprints near
a cattle trough southwest of Encinal. He knows immigrants drink from
the trough, although the water smells like rotten eggs and is laced
with green scum. He circles the footprints and draws closer.</TE>
<TE>   If footprints are not windblown or caved in, then they are recent.
If no animals, such as centipedes, snails, birds or snakes, have
crossed them, then they are fresh. If there are discarded food
wrappers nearby, and if the wrappers are not covered with ants, then
the tracks are brand-new.</TE>
<TE>   Sauceda circles the water trough, sweat trickling down his face,
searching among piles of cow manure for clues. He faces the sun and
looks for tiny shadows.</TE>
<TE>   Then he finds more tracks. They have been made that morning. He
detects patterns: one track is waffled, another has fine lines, and
another is shaped like the pointed toe of a boot.</TE>
<TE>   "I see at least four here," he says.</TE>
<TE>   He smiles. Like a bloodhound, he leans over and picks up his pace.</TE>
<TE>   Changes at the Cotulla office show how much harder it has become
to sneak past agents like Grout and Sauceda.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, Cotulla had 20 agents. Now it has 70. It is one of eight
INS stations north of Nuevo Laredo, where 470 agents have been added
in the last seven years. They are among more than 5,600 the INS has
hired since 1993 to expand its forces along the southern U.S. border.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, agents use a growing arsenal of technology:
helicopters, night-vision goggles, thermal imaging that picks up body
heat and seismic sensors that detect footsteps along immigrant
trails. One INS officer's only job is to move the sensors to outsmart
smugglers who try to plot their location.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier on this day, alerted by Sensor No. 53, agents caught 11
Mexican men who had been walking across the desert for four days.</TE>
<TE>   Grout and Sauceda are particularly dogged, partly because it means
saving lives. Every two weeks or so, Sauceda says, he calls an
ambulance for an immigrant who has been bitten by a rattlesnake, or
hit by a train, or grown so dehydrated in the Texas desert that he is
nearing collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Sauceda follows the footprints at the water trough. He comes to a
trail, climbs into the Bronco and drives, opening and closing gates
with keys from a ring that holds scores--given to the agents by
ranchers.</TE>
<TE>   The temperature climbs to 100 degrees--cool compared with highs of
112 to 118 the week before, which had partially melted the asphalt on
Interstate 35. The Bronco has a range-fire-prevention reminder on the
dashboard: "Do Not Operate Off the Road in Dry Grass or Brush."
Sauceda ignores it.</TE>
<TE>   By 2 p.m., Grout and Sauceda have lost and found the tracks
several times.</TE>
<TE>   Whoever is leaving them seems to be angling toward a tower with an
antenna. The two trackers search each big tree and every water
source. They come to a barbed-wire fence. Marks in the dirt show that
their quarry has crawled under it. Grout picks up the tracks on the
other side.</TE>
<TE>   "There they are, the same ones," he says. "Bigger than Dallas."</TE>
<TE>   The track-makers are headed for Encinal. If they reach town, it
will be virtually impossible to find them, and the agents' half-day
spent in the cactus and the searing heat will be wasted.</TE>
<TE>   Sauceda, dripping sweat, trots alongside the footprints.</TE>
<TE>   Grout drives ahead, to the edge of town. He spots an odd-looking
dirt driveway. The right side has been dragged clean. It leads to a
ramshackle house.</TE>
<TE>   He parks. There, in soil leading to the driveway, are the
footprints: waffle, fine lines, the point of a boot ...</TE>
<TE>   "I got 'em!" he says into a walkie-talkie.</TE>
<TE>   "Where?" Sauceda asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Same place as the last time."</TE>
<TE>   Grout takes three paces toward the house. A Rottweiler lunges from
behind a tree. Grout reaches for his .40-caliber Beretta.</TE>
<TE>   A chain stops the dog a few feet in front of him.</TE>
<TE>   Carefully, Grout presses forward seven more paces, then swings
open the door to a yellow shed. Jammed inside are five surprised
immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   He handcuffs them.</TE>
<TE>   Back at the Bronco, he inspects their footwear. Waffle, fine
lines, pointed boot.</TE>
<TE>   Grout smiles.</TE>

<LD>   Coyotes, or smugglers, mistook Darwin Zepeda Lopez for a paying
customer.</LD>
<TE>   They herded him along with their clients toward four
boxcars, doors open. Then they loaded him and about 40 of the others into
one of the cars.</TE>
<TE>   Zepeda, 22, lanky and with big hazel eyes, was traveling north to
the Rio Grande. He had been on his own, with no coyote to help him,
because neither he nor his family could afford one.</TE>
<TE>   Now it seemed he might get a free ride.</TE>
<TE>   Zepeda says he heard the metal doors slide, then clang shut. The
smugglers locked them in from the outside, so the boxcar would not
look suspicious. It was April 2000 in southern Mexico, and the
outdoor temperature was climbing past 100 degrees. Inside, the car
was turning into an oven.</TE>
<TE>   As the train rolled north, the immigrants drank their water
bottles dry. The air in the car turned rank with sweat. Zepeda could
hardly breathe. People began screaming and shouting for help.</TE>
<TE>   Some knelt and pleaded with God to stop the train.</TE>
<TE>   At 40 migrants in each of the four boxcars, the smugglers were
making at least $320,000. Coyote fees have doubled since 1993, when
the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service added 5,600 agents
along the U.S.-Mexico border and made it harder for the undocumented
to enter the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The lowest fee for Central American adults is $2,000 to $3,000.</TE>
<TE>   For children, the price doubles, says Robert J. Foss, legal
director at the Central American Resource Center, a Los Angeles
migrant aid group. Some parents pay more than double. Top smuggling
packages for youngsters, Foss says, run as high as $10,000. These
packages guarantee arrival by air.</TE>
<TE>   Most mothers save for years and hire smugglers for their children.
Some female coyotes pretend to be aunts.  They use false identification
papers for the children, lull them to sleep in backs of cars and, just in
case, teach them English responses to typical INS questions.  Others put
them on small boats and ferry them up the Mexican coast.  Still others
ride with them on buses.</TE>
<TE>   Few smugglers can be trusted. Some are drunks or drug addicts.
Many collect part of their fees upfront, then abandon their charges
along the way. Sometimes they rob and rape them.</TE>
<TE>   As Zepeda learned, they have little regard for life.</TE>
<TE>   Fistfights broke out in his boxcar as the riders jockeyed to suck
fresh air through tiny rust holes over the doors. After four hours,
he says, a woman with asthma begged for water, then slumped to the
floor unconscious. Others pried open her mouth and tried to give her
the few drops they could find. Finally, they left her for dead. Some
stood on her to reach the highest air holes.</TE>
<TE>   For a reason Zepeda could not determine, Mexican officials grew
concerned and stopped the train. But the engineer, perhaps bribed by
the smugglers, gave them no time to inspect thoroughly before moving
on. During the next 40 minutes, Zepeda says, he saw seven migrants
fall to the floor.</TE>
<TE>   The boxcar, he says, looked like a rolling morgue.</TE>
<TE>   It was five hours into the ride before immigration agents and
Mexican soldiers forced the engineer to stop again and opened the
boxcars. In the confusion, Zepeda escaped.</TE>

<LD>   Jose Enrique Oliva Rosa and Jose Luis Oliva Rosa, 15, are twins.</LD>
<TE>   Their father left their home in Honduras before they were born.
Their mother went to work in Los Angeles when they were 6. Finally, a
grandmother could no longer afford to feed them, so they were
separated and passed among relatives.</TE>
<TE>   Both were unhappy.</TE>
<TE>   On June 3, 1999, they set out together to find their mother.
Although she had grown estranged, they hoped that she would embrace
them and let them live with her. They vowed never to part again.</TE>
<TE>   But it is nearly impossible for migrants to travel the length of
Mexico together. Even twins.</TE>
<TE>   For a while, Jose Enrique and Jose Luis succeeded.</TE>
<TE>   Together they rode 20 trains. Together they escaped a shootout
between two gang members and Mexican immigration agents, or la migra.
Together they believed a myth that sleeping on railroad tracks kept
snakes away--and they were nearly killed.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt dead, that train got so close," Jose Enrique says.</TE>
<TE>   In Veracruz state, drug runners locked them in a house, hoping
their mother would pay ransom. The twins broke out, and the drug
runners chased them with 9-millimeter pistols. At Donaji, police put
guns to their chests and demanded their money. The twins bolted. The
police fired over their heads.</TE>
<TE>   They were separated four times, despite their best efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Once, in Guatemala, while Jose Enrique was begging, he lost track
of Jose Luis. Eventually, they found each other. Then in Tierra
Blanca, Mexico, while Jose Luis was begging, a police officer chased
his brother. By sheer luck, they found each other the following day,
on top of a freight train heading out of town.</TE>
<TE>   Farther north, in San Luis Potosi, they ran from immigration
agents throwing rocks. Jose Luis helped shove Jose Enrique over a
wall. As he tried to climb it himself, an immigration agent yanked on
his legs and brought him down on jagged security glass. It slashed an
arm. He required 37 stitches. When the Red Cross released him, he
walked the streets all night, searching for his brother.</TE>
<TE>   The twins found each other the next day on the outskirts of town.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, on July, 19, 1999, they made it to the Rio Grande. They
waded across in water up to their necks. Twice, whirlpools sucked
Jose Luis under. Twice, Jose Enrique saved him. From a pay phone in
Hidalgo, Texas, they called Honduras, hoping to get their mother's
phone number. An Immigration and Naturalization Service agent spotted
them and pulled a gun.</TE>
<TE>   The boys ran--in opposite directions.</TE>
<TE>   After 24 hours, Jose Enrique realized that the only way to find
his brother was to turn himself in, risking deportation and another
trek north. He walked up to a U.S. Border Patrol car and rapped on a
window.</TE>
<TE>   "Have you seen my brother?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   Agents handcuffed him.</TE>
<TE>   Five hours later, Jose Luis came to the same conclusion. Barefoot,
with 40 cactus thorns embedded in his skin, he walked up to an agent.</TE>
<TE>   "Have you got my brother yet?"</TE>
<TE>   They found each other, at last, in an INS detention center.</TE>
<TE>   Their mother rejected them, but an immigration court allowed them
to stay in the United States for fear they would be killed if they
were returned to the streets in Honduras. Their lawyer found a foster
home in Michigan where both of them are living.</TE>

<LD>My wife, Mary, and I didn't know much about the All-American Boys
Chorus in late January 1998, when she came across a newspaper
advertisement about chorus auditions for 7- and 8-year-old boys. I
had heard the chorus perform at several private corporate functions
in Orange County, and I had taken my family to a chorus Christmas
concert in the late 1980s. We laughed at the music director, Father
Richard Coughlin, prancing about the stage as he moved
stiff-shouldered boys through their songs.</LD>
<LD>   I vaguely recalled stories in the early 1990s about Father
Coughlin being accused of child molestation and being forced out of
the organization, which he had founded in 1970 and nurtured for two
decades. So when Mary showed the ad to our 7-year-old son, Alex, and
he said, "Yeah, sure," we had no idea what we were getting ourselves
into.</LD>
<TE>   Alex was sold on the chorus as soon as he saw the group's tour
bus. It had televisions and reclining airplane-style seats. This was
no ordinary children's choir, though. This was a nationally acclaimed
chorus that has traveled the world. Advancing through the
divisions--the white-shirt audition group to the blue-shirt training
division and then to the red-shirt concert chorus--is rigorous.
Nearly 150 boys gather two or three times a week at chorus
headquarters, a building at the fairgrounds in Costa Mesa. They spend
up to six hours a week learning to sing and rehearsing for more than
80 concerts a year.</TE>
<TE>   But learning to sing well, to sing against harmony and to memorize
the basic repertoire of more than 40 songs are only part of the work.
The chorus is a tremendous place to learn leadership skills and
discipline. The priority is discipline--It has to be. The group just
finished a monthlong Asian tour, performing before sold-out audiences
from Kuala Lumpur and Singapore to Seoul and Beijing, so the boys had
to be well-disciplined for only nine staff members to handle them.</TE>
<TE>   Friends questioned our decision to let Alex, now 12, go on the
tour. We were concerned about safety, especially in Malaysia. But the
thought of a staff member harming Alex never entered our minds.
Chorus policies and procedures prohibit a staff member from being
alone with a boy. But more than that, we believed that no staff
member would ever abuse Alex. And we still believe that, despite news
last week about the arrest of Roger Giese, a former chorus member who
was serving as a part-time vocal instructor. Giese, 27, is charged
with child molestation in incidents over the past four years
involving a boy, now 17, he had met in the chorus.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Manrique, the executive director of the chorus, emphasizes
that the alleged incidents did not occur during a chorus rehearsal or
concert or at any chorus facility. Parents, though, have concerns. A
few might consider pulling their sons out of the chorus; most
wouldn't think of it. Hopefully, no one will.</TE>
<TE>   Manrique and co-workers are busy raising funds, recruiting members
and scheduling concerts, so I'm sure they hope the controversy will
quickly fade. But as a member of the news media, I doubt it will. The
case involves a staff member who allegedly violated the trust that
parents put in the chorus, which ensures that reporters will be there
every step of the way as Giese goes through the court system. No one
knows this better than Giese. His full-time job is in public
relations, which helps clients get out of such messes.</TE>
<TE>   The chorus is in a no-win situation. Whether Giese is convicted or
his accuser's story turns out to be unfounded, the damage already is
done. Public accusations stick in people's minds like peanut butter
on the roof of the mouth. The chorus, a tuition-free program that
relies mostly on donations, concert fees and CD sales, has a solid
foundation and will survive.</TE>
<TE>   But for a while, it might be tougher to get bookings and win
corporate contributions, especially in an already tight market for
nonprofit groups and in an atmosphere of supercharged emotions
generated by a string of widely publicized molestation cases.</TE>
<TE>   The chorus also is going through some changes. A new musical
director steps in next month to replace David Albulario, who helped
rebuild the chorus in the aftermath of Father Coughlin's abrupt
departure. Albulario has been planning for a year to chase his dream
of acting in Broadway musicals. The chorus is holding auditions this
month for new members and already has faced some questions from their
parents. The chorus will need new voices; an unusually large group of
boys will leave at Christmas because their voices have changed or
because they're simply tired from the hectic pace.</TE>
<TE>   The Giese episode makes me angry and sad. The chorus is arguably
the best boys choir in the nation; the director of the Vienna Boys'
Choir has compared it favorably with his own group. That such
incidents occur is shameful; that the harm spreads and affects so
many others is frustrating. The chorus is a great organization; I
wish I had another 7-year-old son who could join the group now.</TE>

<HD>Davis' 1-2 Punch Helps O.C.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis showed good sense this month by signing a bill that
allows the Orange County Transportation Authority to eliminate the
stranglehold that a private toll road operator has on proposals that
would ease gridlock on the Riverside Freeway. During a mad dash to
deal with more than 1,000 bills passed by the state Legislature,
Davis managed to exhibit common sense while refusing to sign another
bill that would have erected a life support system for the last-gasp
attempt being made to keep the El Toro airport plan alive.</LD>
<LD>   Davis' signature on AB 1010 clears the way for OCTA to buy the
privately owned and operated 91 Express Lanes. The bill also allows
the authority to collect tolls that will be used to pay for the lanes
and retire toll road debt.</LD>
<LD>   But, more important, OCTA now has the ability to eliminate an
infuriating non-competition clause that prohibits state and local
governments from making needed improvements to public lanes on the
heavily used freeway.</LD>
<TE>   Not signing AB 1010 would have been a mistake. Davis, who seemed
concerned about attaching his name to legislation associated with
private toll roads, thankfully listened to bill sponsor Assemblyman
Lou Correa (D-Anaheim), who accurately described AB 1010 as "a local
solution to a local problem."</TE>
<TE>   The Riverside Freeway is broken. Just ask any motorist caught in
the daily traffic jams on the heavily traveled section of highway
that links Orange and Riverside counties. But $1.6 billion in
proposed improvements that could help to free up traffic jams are
being stymied because the private company that runs the toll lanes is
protected by a clause that prohibits improvements on public lanes
that might lure motorists from the for-profit lanes.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike AB 1010, which clearly promises good things for Southern
California motorists, AB 2333 was nothing more than a heavy-handed
attempt to pump new life into the proposed airport at El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   It's time for park opponents to join Correa, a longtime airport
advocate who urged Davis not to sign the bill because, "at this
point, we need to move on and bring some utility to this base."</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of AB 2333 had hoped to force Orange County to provide
its fair share of future airport capacity by turning El Toro into a
commercial airport. The bill would have punished the county for its
failure to create a commercial airport by threatening a cut in
aviation funding. Davis, though, saw the bill for what it was:
outsiders trying to tell a county what to do.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' decision not to sign AB 2333 came two days after a Los
Angeles judge threw out a challenge to the parks plan that voters had
approved in March. News of the judge's ruling, coupled with Davis'
decision, sparked observations that the long-running airport debate
finally is over.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years of constant haggling over the fate of the closed base
clearly is enough. Let's hope that remaining holdouts get the message
that the war over El Toro is over.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Mary Lou Heard ended up in the right place at the right time. For
Heard, that meant any place on God's green earth where she could grow
her colorful and exotic flowers. For a generation of Southern
California gardeners, that meant Heard's Country Gardens, an
award-winning explosion of colorful flowers that brought life to an
abandoned patch of land in Westminster.</LD>
<LD>   Gardening was more than Heard's life. Gardening gave her life. As
a young, single mother who had moved to Southern California from Ohio
many years ago, Heard harnessed the recuperative power of gardening
to stave off life-threatening depression. "I was busy and
productive," she once told a Times reporter about her early forays
into working the earth. "When you're preoccupied, you have time to
heal."</LD>
<LD>   By that simple measure, Heard's Country Gardens provided countless
gardeners with the seeds, gardening knowledge and self-confidence
needed to set in motion their own healing. Heard was as interested in
how her customers grew as in how their gardens fared.</LD>
<TE>   Her business was less about selling product and more about
teaching customers how to plant and care for flowers. And plant they
did; Parma violets, old-fashioned hollyhocks, hydrangea--even the
early-blooming peonies and clematis she'd grown up with in Ohio, but
that experts said would never take root in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Heard was something of an exotic species herself. Unlike the chain
nurseries that concentrate on volume or garden shops that cater to
the rich tastes of the elite, Heard's shop flowered in her own image.
More so than any other nursery, Heard's Country Gardens was "stamped
with the owner's personality," a senior garden writer with Sunset
magazine said. "Mary Lou saw no reason you couldn't have a slightly
wild, slightly country garden in the middle of suburbia."</TE>
<TE>   Heard viewed gardening as a matter of trust. She championed the
ugly ducklings of the plant world, encouraging customers to plant in
the fall and wait for the following spring's wonders. What Heard
didn't see coming when she opened her shop 17 years ago was a growing
wave of interest in untamed, extravagant and unusual garden designs
that matched her own vision.</TE>
<TE>   Heard died this month at age 57 following a two-year battle with
cancer. Not long ago she told The Times that "every lesson in life
I've learned, I've learned in the garden, even the stillness. I'm not
afraid of death."</TE>
<TE>   Heard's Country Gardens is no more. Mary Lou Heard chose to sell
off her seeds and plants. It was a fitting and restorative move that
ensured her loving hand will continue to shape Southern California's
gardens.</TE>

<LD>Of all the education and training providers in California, community
colleges have been in the best position to respond directly and
quickly to community needs.</LD>
<LD>   The state's 108 community colleges offer programs for transfer to
four-year institutions, career education programs, continuing
education for academic and occupational preparation, life enrichment
and skills improvement.</LD>
<LD>   At Rancho Santiago Community College District, home of Santa Ana
College and Santiago Canyon College, we measure our value by student
success. Last year, 1,593 students completed associate degrees, 488
finished certificate programs and more than 1,751 students
transferred to four-year institutions.</LD>
<TE>   But let's take a look at the flip side of the coin. At Santa Ana
College, the parking lot is nearly always overflowing. At Santiago
Canyon College when it rains, students have to sit in their cars
between classes because there is no library or student center where
they can study. Our colleges are bursting. Since 1995, the college
district's total enrollment has grown 61% to nearly 58,000 students.
And we see continued enrollment growth of at least 10% annually until
2010.</TE>
<TE>   The growing student population results in severe overcrowding
coupled with deteriorating facilities at Santa Ana College and an
unfinished campus at Santiago Canyon College. That forces us to look
beyond the state for resources.</TE>
<TE>   There is a $16.5-billion capital construction backlog in
California. The state is able to fund just 4% of projects needed at
community colleges statewide, according to the California Community
College State Chancellor's Office. At the current rate of
construction, Santiago Canyon College's planned 10 academic and
student support buildings won't be completed until mid-century.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1915, Santa Ana College has delivered on its promise of
high-quality, accessible education. Hundreds of thousands of students
have earned degrees and entered the workforce. Yet, despite valiant
efforts to keep up appearances, this fine old college is rapidly
succumbing to age. A campus that was built in the 1950s and '60s for
a student enrollment of 8,500 now serves nearly 30,000. This creates
inordinate stress on electrical, plumbing and heating equipment. If
you visit the Student Success Center, you will see every computer
station full and lines two or three students deep.</TE>
<TE>   Community colleges always see increased enrollments during
volatile economic times. These are precisely the moments when our
residents rely on our colleges being ready to meet their needs.
Because of our open-door policy, our quick retraining programs, and
our low-cost quality education, our enrollments and the need for
services continue to rise.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, these swelling enrollments come at a time when
California is cutting its budget. In the 2002-2003 state budget,
education reductions were significant. They include cuts of $30
million in CalWORKS, $22 million in matriculation support services
and $5.2 million in faculty and staff development.</TE>
<TE>   Even without these reductions, our community colleges receive the
lowest amount of state funding of any segment of public education at
$4,690 per full-time equivalent student. This compares with $7,487
for K-12, and $10,905 and $26,952 for the California State University
and University of California systems respectively.</TE>
<TE>   State funding accounts for 45% of our district's revenue. But the
budget includes nothing for extraordinary capital projects. To
construct or significantly renovate buildings, the system relies on
statewide voter-approved measures.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation to place Proposition 47, the
Kindergarten--University Public Education Facilities Bond, on the
November ballot. Proposition 47 provides for a bond issue to fund
facilities that will relieve overcrowding and repair buildings. The
proposition, if passed, would appropriate money from the state
general fund to pay off bonds.</TE>
<TE>   But our district cannot rely solely on state funding. Last year it
aggressively sought and received more than $5.2 million in
competitive grants and raised nearly $625,000 in private and
corporate donations.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, this is not nearly enough in the face of our
crumbling and insufficient infrastructure. Without additional
resources, our district cannot continue to serve the community as it
has in the past. We have no choice but to turn to the local
community.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, Rancho Santiago Community College District's
Board of Trustees unanimously approved a recommendation to place
Measure E, a $337-million bond measure, on the November ballot. If
approved, Measure E would fund repair, renovation and construction
projects at both campuses. If passed, taxpayers within our district,
encompassing Anaheim Hills, Orange, Santa Ana, Villa Park and parts
of Garden Grove, Irvine and Tustin, will pay about $25 per $100,000
assessed value of their homes on their annual tax bills.</TE>
<TE>   With our community colleges fulfilling essential needs such as
training firefighters, public safety personnel, nurses, teachers and
other high-caliber professionals, we ask for residents' careful
consideration of both Proposition 47 and Measure E. For the sake of
our future, we must expand resources to assure that our community
colleges are there when we need them.</TE>

<LD>Whisper, whisper, whisper. For at least two years, voices in Santa
Ana have been whispering about political payback in the schools. In
stage whispers loud enough to hear in the next town, they accused
some school board members of using the district's $145-million
school-construction bond issue to give political cronies lucrative
contracts.</LD>
<LD>   No one made a formal allegation, certainly not by name. No one
offered evidence, a document, a taped conversation or backup
witnesses to illegal activity.</LD>
<LD>   After an investigation prompted by a vague and anonymous letter,
the Orange County district attorney concluded this month that there
was no "firsthand" evidence of a crime.</LD>
<TE>   Good, though the D.A.'s conclusion that there was no evidence of a
crime shouldn't be read as an endorsement of the way the Santa Ana
board of trustees has conducted itself. Now Santa Ana voters can
conduct their hotly contested board election without slimy rumors
fouling the waters. As they do so, they can remember some
indisputable actions involving the school board and its bond issue.</TE>
<TE>   Like the time two years ago that slow-moving trustees lost
millions in matching state funds for construction projects. Much of
the delay came from a move by a majority led by John Palacio to
create a new selection and design process. The district knew time was
short and needlessly fumbled around with procedures, while the
Capistrano Unified School District, under the same time strictures,
scrambled and got the money.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana has another chance at state money with a new bond
measure on the November ballot, but the loss from that first mistake
cannot be regained. Rising construction costs in the last two years
already have meant pulling at least two schools off the list.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana voters, not a well-off group for the most part, put
their faith and their wallets into building better schools for
children who attend some of the state's most crowded campuses. And
now they aren't getting the full goods for their money.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the time that trustees were screening architectural
firms for the contracts--an unusual task for trustees, who usually
leave the job to staff, and a major reason the district missed the
state's application deadline. At just that time, the bidding firms
were getting calls from selected trustees, pressing them for campaign
contributions. A couple of companies felt so pressured that they
filed formal complaints.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the reported beggary came from Nativo V. Lopez, whose
campaign took in nearly $24,000 from architects. The practice is
legal, and Lopez--who now faces a recall campaign over a
controversial school site and English-only classes--said he was just
doing what politicians across the nation do to raise campaign funds.
True, many politicians have been rightly criticized for an equally
poor mixing of public business and their own interests. But the
connection between bid and solicitation in this case was disturbingly
direct.</TE>
<TE>   Two-thirds of the winning firms had made donations to at least one
trustee. And thus were the rumors born.</TE>
<TE>   The election process should be untainted by rumors. Besides, with
schools management like this, who needs rumors?</TE>

<LD>Re "I'll Have the Burger Deluxe, With a Side of Guilt," Sept. 5:</LD>
<LD>   Animal rights are as illusory as human rights. Rights don't exist,
and even if they did they would not be absolute because they are
always relative to those who created them.</LD>
<LD>   Furthermore, we create rights for people other than ourselves not
merely to reciprocate but also so we don't have to worry about our
own "rights" being violated.</LD>
<TE>   Animal rights advocates take this a step further: They create
rights for animals so that their (the advocates') self-esteem is not
violated. This is neither right nor wrong but undeniably true. What
bunny hugger doesn't feel better about himself or herself for it?
These people are just as selfish as the carnivorous biotyrants; it
just shows differently.</TE>

<LD>Re "Archdiocese to Cut Programs, Jobs to Close Budget Gap," Sept. 19:</LD>
<LD>   Attention, Bishop Tod Brown:</LD>
<LD>   Please learn from the mistakes of Cardinal Roger Mahony. His
comment in the article said the $4.3-million deficit, proposed
layoffs and ministry cancellations are not related to the grandiose
new cathedral cost. Right.</LD>
<TE>   He also forgot to include the millions of dollars in abuse
litigation settlements and the potential for further huge judgments
imposed by the courts.</TE>
<TE>   This is not the time to be building an expensive diocesan
cathedral that will be used by a small percentage of the population.
And who can predict how many more abuse settlements our diocese will
have to fund? All extraneous expenditures should be looked at
closely.</TE>

<LD>Re "The 'Homeless in Paradise' Inhabit Beach Cities in Growing
Numbers," Sept. 8:</LD>
<LD>   The impression I got was that the typical Orange County homeless
are happy drunks loving the outdoor life. Reporter Janet Wilson
states that Orange County's homeless fit the national pattern, in
which two-thirds of the homeless are single men and three-quarters
have substance abuse problems.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps this describes the homeless men, but this does not
describe the majority of homeless in Orange County or San Clemente.
Based on the County Infolink survey, an estimated 70% of the homeless
are in families. This means there are close to 16,000 homeless in
families in Orange County with about 18% of them (2,900) in south
Orange County.</LD>
<TE>   If the writer had questioned the director of Family Assistance
Ministries further, she would have found out that most people she
serves are families, and many live in their cars, state parks and
motels, or are staying temporarily with friends or families.</TE>
<TE>   The need for affordable housing is so great in Orange County that
66% of the renters can't afford the market rent for a one-bedroom
apartment and 73% of the households are unable to afford the
median-priced home. With statistics like these, we will see more
homeless and overcrowding if land is not set aside for affordable
apartments and higher-density housing isn't approved for more
entry-level homes to be built.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Harry the Hugger is not homeless, he is "houseless by choice." He
is also a tax dodger because by his own admission he makes at least
$50 a day, tax free yet.</TE>
<TE>   Tom is another by-choice "houseless" man making tax-free money by
his own admission, and his pay is $80 a day. That's $1,600 a month
tax free, enough to make house payments and buy food and a car, so
why doesn't he accept the responsibilities that go with being a
renter or homeowner and paying his share of taxes?</TE>
<TE>   Some people are truly homeless, but most are houseless by choice.
They do not want the responsibility of taking care of a home.</TE>
<TE>   Sleeping in public places is illegal. Not paying taxes on cash
jobs is illegal too.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of giving them handouts, governments should put them to
work sweeping streets and cleaning parks, playgrounds and other
public places. They should be earning their money, not sticking out a
hand to say, "You owe me."</TE>

<LD>Re "The Artists Decide to Punt," Sept. 18:</LD>
<LD>   As a former Laguna Beach High School "artist" (class of 1967), it
was with dismay that I received the news of the school name change to
the "Breakers." I know I am not alone among Laguna Beach High alumni
in wondering just where the current student body and administration
get off deciding to make this change without any input from the
thousands of graduates of the last 65-plus years?</LD>
<LD>   It is true the moniker connoted neither prowess nor intimidation,
but it was our moniker, darn it! It was unique. And contrary to your
assertion that the Artists "seldom won," that name presided over many
winning football, water polo, baseball, basketball, track, tennis and
other teams.</LD>
<TE>   Check the records. Why, I'm so mad about this, I just may have to
get creative and go out and paint something ... like a seascape ...
on a flat day ... without breakers!</TE>

<LD>Re "Tug Over Indian Burial Site Escalates," Sept. 16:</LD>
<LD>   The article focused on tribal politics and quibbling over burial
estimates instead of the fact that at least 150 people attended the
prayer vigil to save the site [in San Juan Capistrano]. Or that there
are more than 500 local Acjachemem/Juaneno people who can trace
ancestry to this village and cemetery.</LD>
<LD>   I would bet that none want to see the site desecrated by
construction of a school and athletic fields. I would also bet that
if bulldozers roll, human remains will be exposed. It should be
mentioned that besides the original burials, the site has at least
three reburials from construction of the offices across the street.
These remains should not be disturbed again.</LD>

<LD>Re "Blowing Smoke," Sept. 22:</LD>
<LD>   The Mission Viejo City Council is coming up with new regulations
on cigarette smoking in public, and on its Web site boasts that,
according to the FBI, it is the "safest city in America."</LD>
<LD>   What is obscured is that this city contaminates the Aliso and San
Juan creeks with pathogenic bacterial counts equivalent to those
found inside a toilet bowl during use, according to Orange County
Health Department testing. It has refused to implement new
regulations on urban runoff and is spending hundreds of thousands
from local coffers to litigate. Is this any way to run "the safest
city in America?"</LD>
<TE>   Roger von Butow</TE>
<TE>   Clean Water Now! Coalition</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The writer of the editorial, "Blowing Smoke," did a disservice to
the subject by saying that the current move to restrict smoking in
outdoor places "smacks ... of a supercilious moral judgment on
smokers."</TE>
<TE>   Those of us who would like to see legislation modified to protect
nonsmokers are not individuals who have it in for smokers. Most of us
have friends who smoke for whom we care deeply. But friendship is not
enough to keep us from fighting for what we believe will ultimately
be passed as law.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty years ago, most of us scoffed at the idea of secondhand
smoke being a risk to others. It was considered radical, unfounded by
solid science. But the science came through in a mountain of
evidence. It was simply a matter of time.</TE>
<TE>   Political popularity is certainly not the issue here. The issue we
are facing is the staggering increase of children with asthma, whose
attacks are often triggered by environmental secondhand smoke, adults
with lung disease ... and the well-being of every person who walks
past a smoker and chokes a bit as they breathe the surrounding air.</TE>
<TE>   What seems controversial today will be accepted as fact and
accommodated in our daily lives in the near future. It seems
unthinkable that we once thought the idea of smoking on an airplane
was acceptable. We know better now.</TE>
<TE>   Good science on environmental tobacco smoke is coming in. Soon we
will commonly restrict where individuals who choose to smoke can
indulge. Not because we have a disdain for smokers, but because some
of us care enough to work for change that will help us all.</TE>
<TE>   It is simply a matter of time.</TE>

<LD>Re "Home of Surfing More Than Surfers," Aug. 18:</LD>
<LD>   I couldn't agree more with the sentiments expressed by the many
surfers mentioned in the article. I grew up sailing, first on the
East Coast and then for the last 35 years in Southern California. It
is an outrage that I cannot afford to live in a house with a dock
directly on Newport Harbor to facilitate my passion.</LD>
<LD>   My wife, an avid golfer since her mid-teens, would like to express
her disgust with the greedy developers who have made Pelican Hill
Golf Course homes too expensive for us to afford. A golf course home
would greatly assist her with her chosen endeavor.</LD>
<TE>   Our daughter is grown now, but as a tyke she often created
beautiful sandcastles on the beach. Her future as a master
builder/architect was unkindly cut short because the uncaring
beachfront property owners were not willing to sell their houses for
less than market value in order to ease her access to the sand.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps we could get together with all the displaced surfers and
initiate a class action lawsuit to get what should rightfully be
ours.</TE>

<HD>Courts Rule on El Toro, but Debate Still Rages</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Vote to Zone El Toro as Park Upheld," Sept. 19:</LD>
<LD>   It's time for El Toro airport activists to give up the ghost. The
court decision on Measure W was clear: The people have a right to
rezone via the initiative process, and Measure W's wording was not
misleading.</LD>
<LD>   The El Toro wars have always and only been about shifting the
burden of an airport from Newport Beach to the communities around El
Toro. The issue of a need for a second Orange County airport is a
joke.</LD>
<TE>   Four countywide votes have been taken. Measures A and S were for
an airport but were taken before the county environmental studies
were released and publicly debated. The last two measures, F and W,
were taken after lengthy public debate and went decidedly against an
airport. More recent polls show airport support dwindling even
further.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Smith</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The judge has spoken! Fifty-eight percent of Orange County voters
supported a Great Park at El Toro. That's a majority, and in a
democracy the majority rules. While the pro-airport Newport Beach
attorneys will always feel that money, power and the ability to
litigate trumps majority rule, I'll gladly take the more idealized
view that all of our voices matter.</TE>
<TE>   The reasons for killing an El Toro airport have never been
stronger. Measure W is clear, fair and the law of the land. The
demand for air travel has entered a long-term slump. A high-speed
California train network is on the drawing board. The Navy's auction
of the Tustin marine base is generating enormous sale values per
acre, and Irvine's plan provides similar returns at El Toro, while
keeping 84% of the land for public parks and educational,
recreational and cultural uses.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Small Cities Wheeling and Dealing to Land Discount
Airlines--for Jobs and Tourists," Sept. 18:</TE>
<TE>   The article highlights the stark contrast between small cities
like Wichita and south Orange County. All of these cities are engaged
in fierce struggles to attract discount airlines to their airports to
bring in tourists and associated jobs and increase competition among
carriers to reduce air fares, thus encouraging existing businesses to
remain in their towns. The cities are supplying subsidies, using
taxpayer-funded ad campaigns, setting up marketing partnerships to
entice discount fare carriers, and providing amenities for
prospective airlines, all at considerable expense.</TE>
<TE>   In South County the 600,000 residents of that "city" have waged an
incessant campaign against an El Toro airport, saying it will ruin
their quality of life. So instead of working to improve the business
climate in South County, that "city" is trying to throw out an
existing $50-million, well-planned airport. Instead of trying to
improve the operating climate for existing tourist and
entrepreneurial activities with easy access to the flying public,
they want to remove any possibility of assistance.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line is that without El Toro, the growth of both north
and south Orange County will be slowed and residents' buying power
will be reduced. South County will be unhealthy, quiet and, when the
developers complete their build-out, known as Levittown West, after
the large, planned tract community on Long Island, N.Y.</TE>

<HD>Race Plays No Role in Santa Ana School Recall</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Bilingual Issue Drives Recall Battle," Sept. 15:</LD>
<LD>   Once again Nativo Lopez is using the race card to discredit the
recall effort against him. In an attempt to gain support from Latino
voters, he asserts that the recall effort is being driven by affluent
residents in north Santa Ana, who are trying to stop a school from
being built in their neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   As one of the mothers who started the recall campaign, I can vouch
that the recall effort has nothing to do with racism. It has
everything to do with Lopez's failure as a school board member to
responsibly use our resources to educate our children. The battle
over the Griset School in north Santa Ana is just one of the many
issues that the school board has bungled. Otherwise, 15,000 residents
from every ethnic background, economic background and ZIP Code of
Santa Ana wouldn't have readily signed the recall petition.</LD>
<TE>   The hard-working parents of south Santa Ana have been waiting
years for the new Manuel Esqueda School. We were promised if we voted
for Measure C, our school would be the first one built. We have the
need, the neighborhood support and the property to build this school.
But three years after Measure C was passed, we still don't have our
school.</TE>
<TE>   Yet on the north end of town, where the neighborhood doesn't want
it, and where the property required seizure by eminent domain, the
school board pushes forward with a fast-track program to build the
Griset School. It is painfully obvious that Lopez looks at the Griset
School as his "trophy" in north Santa Ana, meanwhile ignoring and
discriminating against the kids and parents of south Santa Ana whom
he feigns to protect.</TE>

<LD>Re "Nuclear Plant Safeguard," Sept. 16:</LD>
<LD>   The San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station is not safe, despite
recent efforts to improve security mentioned in your editorial. It is
a terrorist disaster waiting to happen. It will come from Al Qaeda
terrorists chartering a business jet in a foreign country, loading it
with roughly 2,000 pounds of high explosives, filing a flight plan to
John Wayne Airport and flying the jet into the nuclear power plant.
More specifically, the terrorists will target the highly radioactive,
spent fuel stored at the facility.</LD>
<LD>   A typical plant generates tons of high-level nuclear waste every
year that is stored underwater or above ground in unhardened,
concrete containers near the reactors. The ugly truth is that there
is no effective no-fly zone around the nuclear plant and there is no
effective anti-aircraft defense system installed at San Onofre.</LD>
<TE>   Remember the image of a plane flying into a big, vulnerable
building on 9/11? This time we will see a large "dirty" explosion
destroy the power plant, close the interstate and send radiation to
San Clemente, Dana Point, Laguna Niguel, San Juan Capistrano, Mission
Viejo, Coto de Caza, Dove Canyon and Rancho Santa Margarita.</TE>
<TE>   Why don't we feel safer knowing the state is distributing
anti-radiation pills to 400,000 residents within 10 miles of San
Onofre?</TE>

<HD>Warren Burnett, 75; Texas Lawyer Quoted Bard, Bible</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Warren E. Burnett, a Texas lawyer as colorful as a kaleidoscope who
was equally adept at sending one murderer to the electric chair and
getting another off by describing him as "temporarily dethroned of
reason," has died. He was 75.</LD>
<LD>   Burnett, also known for championing civil rights, died Monday of a
heart attack in Fort Davis, Texas. He lived in League City, near
Galveston.</LD>
<LD>   With his size 14 shoes, Harley-Davidson motorcycle, private planes
he could fly himself and whiskey-laced victory parties that could go
on for days, Burnett cast a big shadow across the arid plains of west
Texas.</LD>
<TE>   The courtroom orator, who could quote Shakespeare and the King
James version of the Bible, was struck by the fatal heart attack
while sitting on a porch with a cold beer in his hand. Some might
consider that a poetic exit for the lawyer who once offered a
cost-free defense to the only saloonkeeper in lonely Mentone, Texas,
when the state liquor board shut the bar down for a week.</TE>
<TE>   Burnett handily won the death sentence for a killer he prosecuted
during his first term as district attorney in Odessa, Texas. The
hitchhiker was accused of accosting two couples at gunpoint, tying up
the men and assaulting their wives, and then begging for his life so
that he could die in the electric chair after one husband broke free,
grabbed the gun and shot him in the leg. Burnett so emphatically
stressed the killer's "wish" for execution that jurors required a
mere 32 minutes to order death by electrocution.</TE>
<TE>   The lawyer, who later became a staunch opponent of the death
penalty, was just as successful in defending an 18-year-old man for
blowing a 15-year-old schoolgirl's head off with a shotgun. His
client, Burnett argued, was so "temporarily dethroned of reason" that
he thought he was performing a kind deed after the girl said she
wanted "to live with the angels." The youth was acquitted.</TE>
<TE>   Burnett's witty phrasing was not limited to legal issues.</TE>
<TE>   When the city of Odessa once hired the legendary trial lawyer to
wage a battle for a four-year state university, and a judge
questioned the need, Burnett assured him: "Your Honor, there is
enough ignorance in Odessa to justify an eight-year college."</TE>
<TE>   And in 1992, when The Times profiled the city of Toronto, Burnett
as a visitor offered his assessment: "This is a city where everyone
looks as though they're on their way to band practice."</TE>
<TE>   Born in the mining town of Austinville, Va., Warren Edsel Burnett
dropped out of Virginia Tech to serve in the Marines in China and
Burma at the end of World War II. Afterward, he joined a buddy at
Lamar College in Beaumont, Texas, and then went to Baylor Law School.
After a brief stint in the San Antonio district attorney's office, he
moved to Odessa in west Texas.</TE>
<TE>   In 1968, after a meeting of liberal leaders and lawyers ready to
represent them, Burnett became a champion of civil rights. He
organized marches, picketed supermarkets during Cesar Chavez's grape
boycott and waged court battles for school integration and the United
Farm Workers. Burnett, who won numerous seven-figure jury awards,
often took on the cases of minorities and indigents without charging
any fees.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Kay Taylor Burnett; three children;
three stepchildren; and three grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Rep. Patsy Mink, 74; Legislator From Hawaii</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AARON ZITNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. Rep. Patsy Mink (D-Hawaii), an ardent liberal and feminist who
served 24 years in Congress, died Saturday. She was 74 and had been
battling viral pneumonia for several weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Mink died at Straub Clinic and Hospital in Honolulu, her
Washington office said. She had been treated there since Aug. 30 for
the pneumonia, which stemmed from chickenpox.</LD>
<LD>   Mink was elected to Congress in 1964 and left office in 1977 to
run for the Senate, a race she lost. She was reelected to the House
in 1990 and had won her last two elections by wide margins. She
represented most of Hawaii outside of Honolulu.</LD>
<TE>   Despite being hospitalized at the time, Mink easily won a primary
election this month and was favored to win reelection in November.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Daniel K. Akaka (D-Hawaii), a longtime colleague, praised her
Saturday as a "petite woman with a powerful voice and a peerless
reputation as a champion for equal opportunity, civil rights and
education."</TE>
<TE>   Mink's "vision of hope and passion for justice" had helped bring
about statehood for Hawaii and had created new opportunities for the
state's residents, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Hawaii, Mink became a lawyer and then a member of the
House and Senate in Hawaii, while it was still a territory. In
Congress, she was an early opponent of the Vietnam War and
consistently supported abortion rights and opposed the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Mink was an author of Title IX of the Education Act of 1972, which
gave a major boost to women's athletics. The law says both genders
must be treated equally in any education program or activity that
receives federal aid.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, she opposed the toughening of welfare laws signed
by President Clinton, but was also a sharp critic of her Republican
colleagues during Clinton's 1998 impeachment.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1999 book, she suggested that sex discrimination had resulted
in her pursuit of a political career.</TE>
<TE>   Mink said she applied to about a dozen medical schools during her
senior year of college and had good test scores, but was not admitted
anywhere. She went to law school instead, but was rejected by law
firms, she said, because she was married and had a young child. She
eventually opened her own practice.</TE>
<TE>   Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta said Saturday that Mink
had been an "inspiring voice for the people of her state, and for the
forgotten, the disenfranchised, the poor."</TE>
<TE>   "She was the first Asian Pacific American woman admitted the bar
of Hawaii. She was the first Asian Pacific American woman elected to
state office in Hawaii, and the first woman of color elected to
national office in the United States when she joined the Congress in
1964," Mineta said. "She not only opened those doors, she actively
helped others pass through them."</TE>
<TE>   Between her two stretches of House service, Mink ran
unsuccessfully for governor of Hawaii and mayor of Honolulu. She
served under President Carter as assistant secretary of state for
oceans, international environment and scientific affairs.</TE>
<TE>   She was president of the liberal group Americans for Democratic
Action from 1978 to 1981.</TE>
<TE>   Mink was to face Republican state Rep. Bob McDermott in the
November election for the House. According to a report in the
Honolulu Star-Bulletin, the deadline for removal of Mink's name from
the ballot has expired.</TE>
<TE>   State law allows a deceased candidate's name to appear on a ballot
and includes provisions for a special election to fill the seat, the
newspaper said. House seats can be filled only by election, not by
gubernatorial appointment, the paper said.</TE>
<TE>   Mink is survived by her husband, John Mink, and daughter, Wendy.</TE>

<DH>Military: Starting small, U.S. and French troops are

nation's fledgling army.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Lying on their backs at a military academy compound here, about 30
bearded men in green camouflage fatigues do bicycle pedals in the air
before turning on their stomachs for a rough approximation of
push-ups.</LD>
<LD>   Welcome to the new Afghan National Army, troop strength 1,800 and,
ever so slowly, growing.</LD>
<LD>   From these humble beginnings, the country's transitional
government under President Hamid Karzai hopes to create a
nonfactional, multiethnic force of 60,000 to 80,000 that would be
able to take on enemies of a much larger size.</LD>
<TE>   The idea promulgated by Karzai and supported by Western countries
is that a nonfactional army equipped by various donor countries would
break Afghanistan out of its pattern of civil war and conflict among
private armies fighting for land, people and resources.</TE>
<TE>   A viable national army would mean extending security to all
corners of the country, not just the area around this capital city
now protected by international peacekeepers. And having that security
would, many believe, build support for the government and undermine
those people chafing for the return of the Taliban, who at least kept
the streets safe.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest question mark is the country's warlords, who have
militias of their own. How are they going to respond to the upstart
national corps?</TE>
<TE>   And, almost as worrying, will the men here in training, all bound
by ethnic and tribal loyalties, be able to transcend them to serve a
democratically elected civil government?</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Col. Kevin M. McDonnell, commander of the U.S. Army's 1st
Battalion, 3rd Special Forces Group, which since April has been
carrying out training with the French army, was hearing no such
doubts.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the Afghan National Army," he said flatly. And training
"is going great."</TE>
<TE>   McDonnell acknowledged that warlords could be threatened by the
emergence of a national army, but that is no reason not to keep
going, he said. "The longer this continues, the more credibility
we'll have.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people have come into Afghanistan and made promises, a
lot of them. The Afghan people are waiting to see if the concept of
the Afghan National Army really works. They are waiting to see if the
international community has the patience and persistence to make this
work."</TE>
<TE>   And he believes that the army can be a crucible to break down some
of the divisions in the country. "As time goes by," he said, "the
ethnic and tribal ties will start to fade."</TE>
<TE>   At the training academy, the U.S. Special Forces, their bigger
bulk and their desert camouflage distinguishing them from the thin
Afghan soldiers in green, strode about barking instructions and
giving encouragement as translators struggled to keep up. The
trainees were using Kalashnikov rifles donated by Romania, Albania
and Bulgaria.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to not give them U.S. M-16s was because the
Russian-designed automatic rifle is much more familiar in
Afghanistan, having been the preferred weapon during the country's
past decades of war, first against Soviet occupation and then for
power among various factions.</TE>
<TE>   One basic lesson has been how to aim a gun. Contrary to the image
of the skilled fighter, many of the trainees had never used the
sights on their weapons, said Maj. Steve Stover, a Pentagon public
affairs officer.</TE>
<TE>   The Afghan way had been to keep the gun on full automatic and
simply spray the enemy.</TE>
<TE>   Another lesson being taught is to suppress the Afghan idea that a
soldier is loyal first of all to his commander.</TE>
<TE>   "We tell them that they do not have to support any one person but
the elected government of Afghanistan," Stover said.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent September morning, two battalions in training--one in
its sixth week under the aegis of the U.S. Special Forces, and one
just starting under their French trainers--were assembled side by
side outside their barracks. They were a study in contrasts--the one
group in their smart battle-dress uniforms and caps lining up quickly
and quietly, the other in a motley assortment of tunics, robes, hats
and turbans, lounging insolently or stretched out on the ground
waiting for something to happen.</TE>
<TE>   Within a short time, the soldiers show potential, according to
their U.S. trainers.</TE>
<TE>   At a practice session to teach them how to fire mortars, after
having had only two days' instruction, the recruits split into crews
and safely assembled scores of Iranian-made 82-millimeter mortar
rounds and began firing on targets as far as 2 1/2 miles away. (The
risk of an accidental explosion made watching this exercise fairly
terrifying.)</TE>
<TE>   Through trial and error, they'd lay a round on their target after
three or four tries, and--once they had hit their mark--follow it
with a blitz of concussions echoing off the mountains beyond.</TE>
<TE>   "They're doing super," said a lanky Special Forces officer who
gave his name only as Timothy, who said the rounds were falling
within about 35 yards of their target. "Using what they've got,
they're doing pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   While training, the recruits get a monthly salary of $30, to be
increased to $50 upon successful completion.</TE>
<TE>   So far, of the 500 to 600 recruits in each of the five battalions
being trained, about 150 to 200 have dropped out.</TE>
<TE>   Mainly, soldiers said, they were discouraged by the tough physical
regimen and the modest pay, which they considered insufficient
compensation for being far from home and unable to contribute to
their families' upkeep.</TE>
<TE>   McDonnell said he wasn't concerned. This level of "erosion" is
normal in any army, he said, and part of the purpose of basic
training is to weed out the weak soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   A Proud Graduate</TE>
<TE>   Most people would consider Abdul Rahman, 33, a fairly experienced
fighter. Five years ago, he volunteered for the Northern Alliance and
fought with it against the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   He had his own Kalashnikov, was repeatedly tested under fire and
attained the rank of captain by the time the victorious northern
forces poured into Kabul last November.</TE>
<TE>   Today the stocky young man in a short reddish beard is
swaggering--but not because of his past. He is proud because he has
graduated in the first battalion to be trained by international
forces back in April.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, we just fought randomly and used our own tactics," he
said one recent evening. "But now we have learned real military
tactics to defeat our enemies. Now I really feel like a real
soldier."</TE>
<TE>   His enthusiasm aside, however, most experts on the country believe
that there is a long way to go to build a new army.</TE>
<TE>   Already there have been sharp disagreements among rival
commanders, and between Afghan military officers and their foreign
allies, over who should have military power and how it should be
wielded.</TE>
<TE>   The problems have contributed to reported friction between Defense
Minister Mohammed Qassim Fahim and Karzai over how quickly the old
Northern Alliance military command should be replaced by a more
ethnically balanced officer corps, and how quickly the vast number of
moujahedeen veterans should be disarmed and re-integrated into
civilian life.</TE>
<TE>   As Northern Alliance commander since the assassination of Ahmed
Shah Masoud last year, Fahim had his own militia. When the Taliban
fell, his militia entered Kabul and started to style itself as the
national army. But because the Northern Alliance was composed almost
exclusively of ethnic Tajiks--and its leading officers more
specifically Tajiks from one area, Masoud's Panjshir Valley--it has
not gained the full trust of Pushtuns or members of other ethnic
groups.</TE>
<TE>   There remain indications that Fahim and the Panjshir officer corps
are lukewarm toward the troops being trained by the United States and
France. Fahim was notably absent at the first graduation ceremony of
a foreign-trained battalion in April. The soldiers have reported
having trouble getting weapons, pay or assignments from the ministry.</TE>
<TE>   In August, the Defense Ministry issued a draft policy statement on
forming the national army that barely mentions the training program
and seems to imply that its graduates would be put into a national
guard, not the army.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the draft policy is concerned with getting moujahedeen
veterans from the Northern Alliance and other militias to register
their weapons, after which the most suitable fighters would be
assigned to units and trained for army service, and the rest would be
re-integrated into civilian life, including job training and
financial assistance.</TE>
<TE>   But the international community remains strongly committed to the
training program to build an army from scratch. President Bush has
pledged to help Afghanistan develop its army and police force, in
part to remove the need for ongoing international peacekeepers in the
country.</TE>
<TE>   The reason is clear. So far, the international community has been
able to pony up only 5,000 troops to provide security in Kabul. Under
the overall command of Turkey, international patrols sweep through
the capital daily, working with local police, checking sites that
might be targets for terrorist bombings, and setting up temporary
roadblocks to screen cars for explosives or weapons. As a result, the
capital has a modicum of security.</TE>
<TE>   State of Near Anarchy</TE>
<TE>   But that isn't the case for much of the rest of Afghanistan. In
Mazar-i-Sharif in the north, there have been frequent clashes between
rival warlords, leading to shootings in the street. The lack of
security is one reason U.N. officials say that school attendance is
lagging behind in some districts around Mazar. And unlike Kabul, few
women in Mazar have dared to shed their burkas while untrustworthy
gunmen still roam unhindered.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, in the east of the country, the absence of
international peacekeepers has allowed a state of near anarchy around
Khowst and Gardez, where a disgruntled ousted governor has continued
to harass the local officials recognized in Kabul. And in some rural
areas to the south, vestiges of the Taliban have been able to emerge
and intimidate the local population.</TE>
<TE>   All of which argues for the country to get the kinks ironed out
and to get the new national force moving as quickly as possible,
Afghan and foreign officials here believe.</TE>
<TE>   As Karzai declared in a television address as early as January,
"The rule of the gun is the greatest obstacle to everlasting peace
and security in our country."</TE>

<HD>Iraq Has No Ties to Al Qaeda, Paper Says</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Editorial denies U.S. allegations, adding that
the Islamists are incompatible with nation's secular regime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>Iraq's most influential newspaper is denying U.S. accusations that
Baghdad has links with the Al Qaeda terrorist network, saying
Saturday that the allegations are a "stupid new American ploy."</LD>
<LD>   The denial in Babel, the newspaper published by President Saddam
Hussein's eldest son, Uday, came after top U.S. officials including
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and Vice President Dick Cheney
alleged links between Iraq and Al Qaeda, which Washington blames for
the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   However, the Bush administration has not made public any evidence
linking Hussein, whose ruling Baath Party is militantly secularist,
to the radical Islamists of Al Qaeda.</LD>
<TE>   "It is a stupid new American ploy," the front-page editorial in
Babel said. "The ideology, structure and philosophy of our country do
not meet with that of the Al Qaeda organization whatsoever.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush's American propaganda campaign is trying to convince the
Congress and the American public opinion that there is a link between
Iraq and Al Qaeda after Bush failed to sell his allegation that Iraq
possesses weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   "The American people should know that such an organization like Al
Qaeda is outlawed in Iraq," Babel said.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld said last week that senior Al Qaeda leaders have been in
Baghdad "in recent periods." Cheney also accused Iraq of "exchanges"
with Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Any proof of such a link would give the Bush administration
powerful ammunition in its bid to persuade the U.N. Security Council
to approve a new draft resolution requiring Iraq to comply with
weapons inspections or face the consequences.</TE>
<TE>   It could also help Bush get a congressional resolution authorizing
use of military force against Baghdad if needed.</TE>

<DL>DHAKA, Bangladesh</DL>
<LD>At least four bombs exploded in a packed movie house and a crowded
circus show Saturday in southwestern Bangladesh, killing at least 10
people and injuring an additional 200, local police said.</LD>
<LD>   The death toll was expected to increase, a police official in the
town of Satkhira said on condition of anonymity.</LD>
<LD>   However, the national police headquarters in Dhaka, the capital,
said it could confirm only that 40 people were injured and 27 were
taken to hospitals. "There have still been no detailed reports about
the number of dead," a statement said.</LD>
<TE>   Two bombs went off at the packed Roxie Cinema Hall, a movie
theater in Satkhira, 110 miles southwest of Dhaka.</TE>
<TE>   Within minutes and a few blocks away, two more bombs blew up in a
circus show at a stadium in the town center, the officer said.</TE>
<TE>   Two men suspected in the bombings were detained today, Satkhira
Police Chief Rafiqul Islam said. He did not identify them.</TE>
<TE>   The motive remained unknown, but Abdul Matin Chowdhury, the area's
chief government administrator, said suspicion fell on Islamic
fundamentalists who recently demonstrated against the theater and
circus in the belief that such entertainment is immoral.</TE>
<TE>   Hospitals and health centers were overwhelmed by the arrivals of
those injured, United News of Bangladesh news agency reported.</TE>
<TE>   The authorities deployed nearly 1,000 police and paramilitary
troops to patrol the small town.</TE>

<LD>Former British Prime Minister John Major, who campaigned for family

by admitting to a four-year affair with a colleague.</LD>
<LD>   The affair with a former Cabinet minister, Edwina Currie, predated
his tenure. The relationship was revealed in excerpts from Currie's
parliamentary diaries in the Times newspaper.</LD>
<LD>   Major's admission could prompt legal action from the now-defunct
magazine Scallywag, which says it was driven out of business after he
sued it nearly a decade ago for suggesting he had had an affair.</LD>

<DH></DH>
<SE>ENRIQUE'S JOURNEY: This is part one in a six-part series chronicling
the journey of Enrique, who traveled alone from Honduras as a teenager in
search of his mother.</SE>
<AU>Sonia Nazario</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sonia Nazario, the writer, found Enrique in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, in
May 2000. She and Don Bartletti, the photographer, spent two weeks
with him there and rejoined him at the end of his journey in North
Carolina. Then, based on Nazario's extensive interviews with him in
Mexico and during three visits to North Carolina, she and Bartletti
retraced each step Enrique had taken, beginning at his home in
Honduras.</LD>
<LD>   Between May and September 2000, Nazario and Bartletti spent three
months working their way north through Mexico just as Enrique had,
riding the tops of seven freight trains and interviewing and
photographing people Enrique had encountered, along with dozens of
other children and adults making the same journey. Nazario and
Bartletti walked around immigration checkpoints and hitchhiked with
truckers, exactly as Enrique had. To retrace Enrique's steps, they
traversed 13 of Mexico's 31 states.</LD>
<TE>   Nazario conducted interviews in the United States, Honduras,
Mexico and Guatemala with immigrant rights advocates, shelter
workers, academics, medical workers, government officials, police
officers and priests and nuns who minister to immigrants. At four INS
detention centers in California and Texas and in two shelters for
child migrants in Tijuana and Mexicali, Mexico, she interviewed
youngsters who had made their way north on top of freight trains. She
also consulted academic studies and books about immigration.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Times has a strong preference for naming the
subjects of its articles in full. It has done so with two members of
Enrique's family, his girlfriend and a friend. But The Times has
decided to identify Enrique, his mother, father and two sisters by
publishing only their first names and to withhold the maternal or
paternal name, or both, of six relatives as well as some details of
Enrique's employment. A database review by Times researcher Nona
Yates showed that publishing their full names would make Enrique
readily identifiable to authorities. In 1998, the Raleigh, N.C., News
and Observer profiled an illegal immigrant whom it fully identified
by name and workplace. Authorities arrested the subject of the
profile, four co-workers and a customer for being undocumented
immigrants. The Times' decision in this instance is intended to allow
Enrique and his family to live their lives as they would have had
they not provided information for this story.</TE>
<TE>   Scenes from Enrique's life in Honduras with his mother and sister,
including his mother's departure: written from interviews with
Enrique; his mother, Lourdes; his aunts Mirian Liliana Aguilera and
Rosa Amalia; his maternal grandmother, Agueda Amalia Valladares; and

<TE>   Estimate that at least 48,000 children enter the United
States from Central America and Mexico each year, illegally and without
either parent: This total, for 2001, is reached by adding the
following numbers, which are the latest available. The U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service says it detained 2,401 Central
American children. The INS has no figure for Mexican children, but
Mexico's Ministry of Foreign Affairs says the INS detained 12,019 of
them. Scholars, including Robert Bach, former INS executive associate
commissioner for policy, planning and programs, estimate that about
33,600 children are not caught.</TE>
<TE>   For 2000, the total was 59,000.</TE>
<TE>   Reasons children travel to the United States and information that
many come in search of their mothers: from Roy de la Cerda Jr., the

<HD>Rising Crime Vexes Chinese</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>A deliberate mass poisoning that left dozens dead. Serial killers who
met teenage girls through the Internet, then raped and murdered them.
Robberies, child abuse, contract killings, abductions.</LD>
<LD>   A rash of sensational crimes has grabbed headlines in China in
recent months, turning public safety into a hot topic and prompting
hand-wringing over the state of Chinese society.</LD>
<LD>   Shocked by the brutality of some of the incidents, experts and
ordinary Chinese alike are lamenting what they see as a breakdown in
everything from morality to education in a Confucian society that
traditionally has put a premium on both. Others pin the blame on the
widening disparity between China's haves and have-nots--and warn of
further antisocial behavior.</LD>
<TE>   "As long as society is out of kilter, vicious things will keep on
happening," one Internet user wrote in a posting on a popular Chinese
Web site last week. "It's time for people to stop and think. We've
had great economic development, but we've lost so many
things--including our consciences."</TE>
<TE>   Such angst may seem overwrought from a Western perspective: In
general, China is an extremely safe country, a place where children
walk home from school unaccompanied and nighttime brings little cause
for fear.</TE>
<TE>   But there is no doubt the crime rate is soaring. Experts estimate
the number of criminal cases rose last year by nearly a third from
the year before, including more than 20,000 homicides. (In 1999,
there were nearly 17,000 murders in the U.S., whose population is
less than a quarter of China's.) The increase was the latest in a
steady rise that has occurred in near lock-step with China's
market-oriented reforms of the last 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Those reforms have delivered greater freedom and affluence to
millions of people, who have the money to decorate their homes, buy
cars and watch movies on their DVD players. But millions of others
have lost jobs or struggled to keep up, creating a highly uneven
distribution of wealth that government researchers warn is reaching
dangerous levels. The yawning gap between rich and poor, sociologists
say, is producing the conditions for the explosion of homicidal,
larcenous and other illicit behavior.</TE>
<TE>   The decline in public safety--and its probable cause--is a
sensitive political issue for China's Communist regime, which is
gearing up for a crucial party congress in November that could see a
change in leadership. In the run-up to the gathering, President Jiang
Zemin wants China to project an image of shiny, happy people whose
prosperity and satisfaction he is eager to claim at least partial
credit for.</TE>
<TE>   Government sensitivities were on display recently following the
mass poisoning at a fast-food restaurant in the eastern city of
Nanjing. Witnesses reported seeing victims, many of them students,
collapse within minutes of ingesting rat poison-laced food, blood
streaming from their noses and mouths. Dozens of people died.</TE>
<TE>   The Chinese media jumped on the incident--but were told by the
government to back off. An early death toll of 41 put out by the
official New China News Agency was later revised to "many people"
having died.</TE>
<TE>   Within a day, police nabbed the alleged culprit: a restaurateur
who was jealous of his rival's success.</TE>
<TE>   "My God, how many crazy people are there in our society? It has
shown what a failure our educational system is," read one posting in
the heavy Internet traffic that ensued.</TE>
<TE>   The remarks echoed widespread criticism that authorities and
emergency personnel had responded too slowly to the poisoning,
leading to unnecessary deaths.</TE>
<TE>   From the Beijing regime's point of view, the failure to prevent
crime isn't for want of trying. For months, the police have been
prosecuting one of China's periodic "Strike Hard" anti-crime
campaigns, an aggressive crackdown during which thousands of criminal
cases are reportedly solved--often through forced confessions--and
hundreds of convicts executed to demonstrate the government's resolve
and prowess.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, if past campaigns are any guide, such crackdowns
have done little but dent the crime rate temporarily. Instead, they
often have the unintended effect of calling public attention to
high-profile crimes the government would sooner sweep under the rug.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese newspapers, which are livelier and harder for the state to
control than in the past, have taken to crime reporting with almost
the same enthusiasm--and relish for grisly detail--as some of their
Western counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   This year, readers have been treated to reports about China's
first Internet serial killers; a psychopath in Beijing who was
executed for killing 14 prostitutes; a burglar who stabbed to death a
famous elderly Peking opera star; and the leader of a brutal gang of
armed robbers in central China who once slaughtered a family of four
for a booty of 30 yuan ($3.60).</TE>
<TE>   Such incidents, while not necessarily causing ordinary citizens to
modify their everyday behavior, have nonetheless contributed to an
impression of growing lawlessness.</TE>
<TE>   Petty theft in big cities such as Beijing and Shanghai is
considered so routine that few bother to report such cases to the
police.</TE>
<TE>   "Just ask around and see who hasn't had the experience of losing
at least one bicycle" to thieves, said Niu Li, 25, an actress. "I've
never been the victim of violent crime, but I've lost at least three
bikes, my mom had her wallet stolen in a department store, and a
friend of mine lost his car a month ago and hasn't gotten it back."</TE>
<TE>   Residents lament the erosion of community spirit and values that
used to knit people together, even if those qualities sometimes were
forced on them by the Communist regime.</TE>
<TE>   "One of my colleagues was walking down the street in a very
crowded commercial area, and four men came and robbed and beat him,"
said Gao Qiang, 34, who works for a foreign company in Beijing.
"There were so many people on the street, but not a single person
would help, or even just scream or call the police. They just
pretended not to see anything.</TE>
<TE>   "Later my friend reported it to the police, and guess what? They
blamed him for not being careful in a public place."</TE>
<TE>   Derision toward police is common. China's police force is woefully
undereducated, understaffed and underfunded, especially away from the
main cities.</TE>
<TE>   With both the thin blue line and the social safety net stretched
so taut, residents worry that things may get worse before they get
better. Many are dubious about the effectiveness of "Strike Hard" and
other law enforcement crackdowns that occur around public holidays,
such as National Day on Oct. 1.</TE>
<TE>   "The criminals all know that as long as they lie low during
whatever so-called critical time, such as now, with National Day and
the 16th party congress coming up," Gao complained, "they'll
basically be safe."</TE>

<HD>Floods Bring Relief to Friends of Elbe River</HD>
<DH>Europe: Environmental activists are thrilled that plans to
dredge the German waterway for shipping have been sunk by summer's
deluge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DESSAU, Germany</DL>
<LD>It came from the heavens with thunder and lightning and a deluge of
biblical proportions.</LD>
<LD>   Much as one would imagine a miracle, the rescue of the Elbe
River--which had been creeping along for a decade--culminated this
summer when the skies opened and washed away deeply unpopular plans
to dredge the central stretch of the waterway for shipping.</LD>
<LD>   Just a month before the deluge, Germans reveled in the Elbe's
newfound purity with a mass "Bathing Day" along its 700-mile length.
They rejoiced that the river, which for centuries had been celebrated
in art, history and literature, had recovered from the reckless
industrial development of the Communist era. And they railed against
the dredging plan, whose proponents sought relief from overwhelmed
freight trains and truck-clogged highways.</LD>
<TE>   Then came the torrential rains, wiping out billions in property
and killing at least 20 people. Environmentalists and scientists are
blaming the flood on global warming from harmful gases released by
automobiles, airplanes and industry. Suddenly, long-ignored warnings
are being heeded that messing with the natural order of things can
lead to destruction.</TE>
<TE>   "The political lobby pushing to dredge the river has completely
fallen apart since the floods," says Ernst Paul Doerfler, a writer
who has spearheaded an Elbe cleanup mission for the last decade for
the Assn. for Environment and Nature Protection. "Even the chancellor
has recently come out against the project."</TE>
<TE>   Now the regional development priority is on projects more in
harmony with nature.</TE>
<TE>   "The Elbe is the last free-flowing major river left in Europe,"
says Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer of the environmentalist Greens
party. "It doesn't even make economic sense to dredge it, and I'm
sure after this catastrophe that the project will be reconsidered."</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, the waterway that once provided a backdrop for
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and the Brothers Grimm was so befouled
that it could poison a person's blood. Quicksilver from chemical
plants in Bitterfeld and paper-mill effluent from Dresden had made
their way to the mainstream, slowly choking to death millennium-old
oaks with the byproducts of hell-bent industrialization.</TE>
<TE>   "There was so much lead in the soil from industrial waste that we
had to remove the surviving animals from the [game preserve] to
prevent their dying from lead poisoning," horticulturist Ludwig
Trauzettel recalls. "And people couldn't sit on the grass. It was so
infused with chemical waste, it had to be disposed of in sealed
containers."</TE>
<TE>   But Europe's filthiest river has proven extraordinarily forgiving.
As the factories and energy plants that had powered the East German
economy shut down after Germany's 1990 reunification, they took their
poisonous effluents and workplaces with them.</TE>
<TE>   Gone, almost overnight, were the oil refineries, the coal-fired
electricity plants, the smoke-belching steel factories and the
pesticide-spewing farm machinery that had been dumping waste water
into the river throughout the rapid industrial buildup that followed
World War II.</TE>
<TE>   West German industries also played a part in the Elbe's 20th
century pollution. At the river's broad outlet into the North Sea, at
Cuxhaven, biologist Heinrich Reincke has been monitoring the river's
flow and water quality for the last two decades. He notes, as a
nearby example, the massive Dow Chemical plant in Stade that was
dumping toxins at the rate of 12 tons a day in 1980. Subsequent
changes in environmental regulation and technology improvements have
reduced that to less than 440 pounds daily, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Along the length of the Elbe, industrial cleanup and shutdown led
to a virtual halt in the dumping of heavy metals. The construction of
better sewers and drainage cut nutrient waste by 70%.</TE>
<TE>   The most telling of the Elbe's recent turning points, though, was
the river-long "baptism" held July 14, in which thousands of swimmers
gleefully waded into the waters from the sandy shores and city piers
along the river. The mass bathing event is expected to be an annual
activity.</TE>
<TE>   One of the few surviving stretches of river in Central Europe
spared the concrete flanking and locks built to facilitate shipping,
the Elbe is a scene of bucolic serenity as it flows lazily from the
urban centers of Dresden and Magdeburg. Dessau and other smaller
riverfront cities along the Mittlere Elbe, or Middle Elbe, nurtured
hopes after the cleanup of returning to the tree-shaded banks and
reedy estuaries that their grandparents fondly remembered as weekend
idylls.</TE>
<TE>   Those dreams seemed shattered amid the roaring, churned-up torrent
that swept through the central reaches in mid-August. But scientists
such as Reincke say the damage will be short-lived. In fact, the
muck-covered towpaths and riverside trails are now mostly clear again
as the sun returned after the deluge.</TE>
<TE>   Locals say the region's most attractive sights are dependent on a
clean Elbe--a point the dredging enthusiasts now seem unwilling to
counter.</TE>
<TE>   The Woerlitzer Park Garden Kingdom, for instance, draws a million
visitors a year to the idyllic inlets, lakes and channels and the
dappling emerald fields and woodlands a few miles east of Dessau.
Farther upriver is another popular tourist attraction, the town of
Wittenberg, where Martin Luther nailed his famous theses on the
Castle Church door in 1517.</TE>
<TE>   To the south, plaques and historical exhibits mark the riverside
spot near Torgau where Soviet and U.S. soldiers met up after four
years of fighting Nazi forces. Thanks to the massive turnout of
volunteers to sandbag those Elbe landmarks, the region's key tourist
sites survived the flood with minimal damage.</TE>
<TE>   Roswitha Heilmann, manager of the Kornhaus restaurant that dates
to the 1920s heyday of Bauhaus architecture, says the improvement in
the water quality is having an agreeable effect on patronage at her
riverside establishment.</TE>
<TE>   "On nice days, the storks gather on the sand spits across the
water and boaters and cyclists have returned to the shores," she
says, casting an approving eye over the serene landscape of humanity
communing with nature.</TE>
<TE>   The floods did take an enormous toll on the Elbe.</TE>
<TE>   Biologist Reincke says the storms flushed the effluent in storm
drains, sewage treatment plants and storage basins into the river,
filling it with fresh nutrient waste and oily scum. But the damage
was far below the levels of industrial dumping of the Communist era,
sparing the newly recovered Elbe from serious long-term damage, he
says.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a horrible, tragic setback after such a positive
development," Reincke says of the flood damage. "But the river will
recover completely in one to two years."</TE>
<TE>   Scientists are pleased that the massive fish kills they feared
haven't materialized. Little risk of toxic concentrations is expected
because the fish were exposed to contaminants for only a few days
during the height of the flooding.</TE>
<TE>   How quickly the Elbe can refresh its flow with clean water depends
in part on the cleanup behavior of upstream residents in the Czech
Republic. But Reincke notes that the Czechs have been diligent in
their efforts to improve environmental protection as they struggle to
qualify for European Union membership.</TE>
<TE>   Before the flooding, the improved water quality had allowed salmon
to be reintroduced to the river, while most other fish that had been
killed off by pollution returned on their own. The fish are still
plying the Elbe, but health officials have warned anglers to refrain
from eating their catch for a few months so that new tests can be
conducted on suitability for consumption.</TE>
<TE>   With the waters now murky from the soil, debris and sewage swept
up by the flood, swimming has yet to resume even amid a belated heat
wave after a wet summer. But neither has the dredging and damming of
the river, and few expect it to win renewed endorsement.</TE>
<TE>   The dredging project had been on hold before the flood because of
mounting local opposition, and those lobbying against the work see
the inundation as a death blow to the plan.</TE>
<TE>   Deepening the channel by a few inches made little sense before the
disaster, and now German and European development funds will be
needed for more pressing projects to rebuild what the flood
destroyed, says Iris Brunar, spokeswoman for the Pro Elbe local
citizens initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Among the dredging project's most powerful opponents are the
Lutheran Church members in Saxony-Anhalt state, who before the flood
had resumed using the river for baptisms for the first time in
decades.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in principle against anything that pollutes the
environment. This is all God's creation, and we are just a part of
it," district church spokeswoman Karin Bertheau says of humanity's
responsibility to its surroundings. She echoes the environmentalists'
view that there is too little demand for river freight capacity to
justify deepening the channel.</TE>
<TE>   At Woerlitzer, an 18th century estate whose English gardens are
sculpted around Elbe backwaters, horticulturist Trauzettel totes up
the pluses and minuses of the natural disaster and concludes that the
floods probably spared the retreat the worse fate that would have
resulted from dredging. The deeper the river runs, he says, the more
water it will drain from the regional table, leaving trees, crops and
shrubbery to die from dehydration.</TE>
<TE>   "We've already ruined the ecology of much of this region from the
heavy industry that dominated after the war," says Trauzettel, who is
responsible for preserving the lush park, which spreads across nearly
70 square miles and has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage site.</TE>
<TE>   That the Elbe came back to life in a mere decade "is a tribute to
the river's resilience and a second chance for the community to find
a more harmonious balance" with its natural surroundings, Trauzettel
says.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest problem is the threat to the ground water level and
what this could do to agriculture and forestry in the area," adds
Guido Puhlmann, a conservationist at the nearby Mittlere Elbe
Biosphere Reserve.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that it takes decades to show the damage to ground water
levels from dredging and flanking a river, he concedes that there
were too few statistics or scientific arguments against dredging
before the inundation.</TE>
<TE>   Now, say those who have long fought for the river's natural
freedom, Mother Nature has spoken.</TE>

<HD>Malaysia Finds Need for Cast-Off Colonial Tongue</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia</DL>
<LD>As an associate professor at the respected University of Malaya,
Edmund Terence Gomez has a problem: Much of the knowledge he wants to
convey is locked in a language half his students can't read.</LD>
<LD>   Three decades after the country's leaders decreed an end to
colonial-era English in official life and made Malay the sole
language for government affairs, public school instruction and civic
life, Gomez's problem has become Malaysia's problem.</LD>
<LD>   At a time when much of the world has accepted English as the
language of international commerce, technology and cutting-edge
ideas, it has all but died out among large sections of the country's
majority Malay population.</LD>
<TE>   "If 10% of my [Malay] students could follow a simple English
sentence, I'd be pleasantly surprised," Gomez said. Still, the 12
books he assigns as required or optional reading for his third-year
political economy class are all in English.</TE>
<TE>   "The students are overwhelmed, but that's where the knowledge is,"
he said. "If there was a text in Malay, I'd assign it, but there
isn't."</TE>
<TE>   Faced with a threat to the prosperity of this outward-looking
trading nation, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad announced in late
July that math and science would be taught in English from the first
grade on. But the reversal quickly generated an outcry from just
about every segment of society.</TE>
<TE>   Malays fear an erosion of their culture, and the country's large
Chinese and Indian minorities see a threat to alternative-language
schooling that they finance privately. Educators claim that teaching
7-year-olds math and science in a foreign language will produce
children who fail to learn all three, while parents worry about added
stress for their children.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in a restaurant in Seremban, about 40 miles south of the
capital, Kuala Lumpur, Lee Ah Yeow fretted that her 9-year-old son
already finds math and science difficult enough without having to
learn it in a foreign language.</TE>
<TE>   "He's too young for that," she insisted. Like many parents, she
believes that her son should learn English, but only later and as a
separate subject.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition politicians say Mahathir's decision to implement a
sudden change--the new program would begin in January--after years of
doing nothing is a recipe for chaos.</TE>
<TE>   "He's trying to fix things, but it's all wrong," opposition
politician Ronnie Liu said. "It's crazy to do this under such a
deadline. There needs to be a debate. More English teachers need to
be found and trained."</TE>
<TE>   Liu is one of many outspoken ethnic Chinese critics of the change.
Dzulkifli Ahmad, an ethnic Malay and leading member of the opposition
Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party, says he supports greater use of English,
but not Mahathir's proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "I question the wisdom of this," he said. "There's no
infrastructure for it."</TE>
<TE>   At the time, scrapping English seemed like the right thing to do.
Reeling from an explosion of ethnic violence in 1969 and seeking to
unite their nation after 12 bumpy years of independence, Malaysia's
leaders fixed on Malay--the mother tongue of the country's largest
ethnic group.</TE>
<TE>   English remained a subject taught in schools, but the quality of
instruction gradually declined. Elsewhere, it disappeared from the
corridors of domestic power and even from road signs.</TE>
<TE>   Accepted reluctantly by the Chinese and Indian minorities and
viewed by the indigenous Malays as a chance to redress their lowly
status, the change brought the intended social peace and fostered
integration.</TE>
<TE>   But to the dismay of Malaysia's leadership, it has also brought
something else: a generation of publicly educated college graduates
woefully ill-equipped for life in a globalized world.</TE>
<TE>   "Students graduate, but they have no skills," Gomez summed up.
"It's a generation lost."</TE>
<TE>   According to Malaysian government statistics, about one-third of
the students who graduated from the country's 14 public universities
in the last year remain unemployed. Nearly 90% of the jobless are
Malays with degrees in religious studies or social sciences and no
English proficiency.</TE>
<TE>   Other former British or U.S. territorial possessions in Asia have
kept English. In the Philippines, for example, it remains the
language of government, of parliamentary debate and Supreme Court
decisions.</TE>
<TE>   In Singapore, it is one of four official languages and a language
of public school instruction, while in India, English is both an
official language and a preferred "neutral" language for those
communicating across the country's many indigenous linguistic lines.</TE>
<TE>   Fixing the problem here in Malaysia won't be easy. With education
and language both potentially explosive issues, politicians have long
looked the other way. "It's there for all to see, but no one dares to
talk about it," said Liu, a member of the opposition Democratic
Action Party.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the language policy now look back and say it was a
mistake to eliminate English. Others, however, accuse opponents of
playing politics and insist that there isn't time for a long public
debate.</TE>
<TE>   "People are right, this is fast, but the world is changing rapidly
too," said Murugesu Pathmanathan, director of the independent Center
for Policy Sciences and someone known to share the government's
views. "Malaysia has to position itself for the future."</TE>
<TE>   Foreign investors agree.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an issue that must be addressed," said Timothy Garland,
president of the American Malaysian Chamber of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   Aware of the importance of English, members of Malaysia's Chinese
and Indian communities frequently pay for private lessons or listen
to BBC radio transmissions to give them basic comprehension, while
upper- and middle-class Malays from urban areas often send their
children to private schools or abroad to hone language skills.</TE>
<TE>   The rest, however, are left isolated in a monolingual world
penetrated by only occasional bytes of outside knowledge.</TE>
<TE>   "When it comes to contemporary knowledge and information--whether
it's new agricultural techniques or an environmental report--civil
servants and those in the private sector are not able to digest these
things," said Chandra Muzaffar, a political commentator and president
of a social issues group called the International Movement for a Just
World. "It's a huge disadvantage."</TE>
<TE>   Although Malay is the world's 12th most widely spoken language,
educators say it has failed to develop a vocabulary for new ideas and
technology, a fact that makes translating new ideas extremely
difficult. The result is that few foreign-language books find their
way into Malay.</TE>
<TE>   At the large MPH bookstore in the Kuala Lumpur suburb of Bangsar,
for example, only one book, an 88-page softcover cultural history of
Malaysia, was available in Malay. All the rest were in English.</TE>
<TE>   "Malay has helped forge a national identity, but as a language of
science and technology, it hasn't been able to keep up," Pathmanathan
said. He still recalls his struggle to translate two basic works of
political science from English to Malay.</TE>
<TE>   "It took years," he recalled. "I'll never do anything like that
again."</TE>
<TE>   All this has put Mahathir in an unusual position. During his 21
years in power, he has long rankled at the dominance of Western
influence, but he acknowledges that his people need English to
prosper.</TE>
<TE>   "Ninety-nine percent of the information we need comes from
foreigners in English," Mahathir told his party's political
convention in a speech last year. "Information in this Information
Age does not come from the Malays."</TE>
<TE>   This summer, Mahathir delivered an extraordinary lament to a
Harvard Club of Malaysia dinner, expressing dismay and
disillusionment about the results of the policies for which he once
pushed so hard as a younger man, then nurtured during most of his
tenure as prime minister.</TE>
<TE>   He characterized the Malays as a collection of lazy ingrates who
risked the country's future by squandering the advantages legislated
for them. Mahathir is himself three-quarters Malay.</TE>
<TE>   "The Malays have apparently learned nothing from the near loss of
their country in the past," he said. "Today they are still unwilling
to work, and ... because they are not equipping themselves with the
necessary education and skills, they have continued to depend on
others.</TE>
<TE>   "If we discount the non-Malay contribution to the nation's
economy, Malaysia would not be much better than some of the African
developing countries," Mahathir concluded bitterly.</TE>
<TE>   That speech came within a few days of his government's decision to
have the math and science subjects taught in English.</TE>
<TE>   Although Mahathir's allies insist that the decision was carefully
considered and that there is little viable alternative, the breadth
of resistance has brought talk of a possible compromise.</TE>
<TE>   After meeting two influential Chinese community organizations this
month, Mahathir hinted at a possible delay in implementing the new
initiative but offered no specific alternatives. Meanwhile, the
debate continues.</TE>
<TE>   "Malaysia lies at the crossroads of great trade routes, so it must
be open," Muzaffar said. "It must be open to languages and cultures
of the world, including English."</TE>

<HD>Divers Retrieve Bodies From Senegalese Ferry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>DAKAR, Senegal</DL>
<LD>Divers smashed the windows of a capsized Senegalese ferry and hauled
out corpses Saturday as the death toll in one of Africa's worst
maritime disasters reached 399 and was expected to climb.</LD>
<LD>   Rescue workers retrieved hundreds of bodies, many of them
schoolchildren, two days after the Joola overturned in a fierce
Atlantic Ocean gale. Nearly 800 people were on board.</LD>
<LD>   A Gambian navy official said about 300 bodies had been recovered
and transported to the Gambian capital, Banjul. An additional 58
bodies reportedly were on the way to Dakar, Senegal's capital,
bringing to 99 the total number of corpses sent there.</LD>
<TE>   Officials said Saturday that 104 people, including one Frenchman,
had been rescued, but they held out little hope of finding more
survivors.</TE>
<TE>   "I survived, but I saw my wife drown and I could do nothing to
help," said Patrice Auvray of France, who was taken to a hospital in
Gambia.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the passengers were Senegalese. A government crisis unit
set up in Dakar said 10 French, five Spaniards, two Dutch, two
Belgians and two Swiss were on board, along with 20 people from
Guinea-Bissau.</TE>
<TE>   As hundreds of distressed relatives assembled in Dakar's port to
await news of their loved ones, angry crowds demonstrated outside the
city's presidential palace demanding to know how many people had died
in the disaster.</TE>
<TE>   President Abdoulaye Wade told the demonstrators that he understood
their grief, as officials acknowledged that the boat was
significantly overloaded when it capsized. Local media reports said
the ferry, designed for no more than 600 passengers, was dangerously
overcrowded with 796 people.</TE>
<TE>   Wade said the state-owned boat, which was operated by the army,
was not fit to venture into open seas.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a boat designed for lakes. It was not made for the sea.
The responsibility of the state is clear," said Wade, adding that the
families of the victims would receive compensation.</TE>
<TE>   Barricades held back crowds who stood vigil by the hundreds
overnight at the main naval base in Dakar, waiting to find out, in
some cases, whether whole families had perished.</TE>
<TE>   "I have been waiting 22 hours for information!" Daouda Diot,
seeking news of his wife, shouted at military police who were fending
off distraught family members at the base.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the passengers were students heading to Dakar to start the
new school term. "I just had to come to see," said Amina Ndiaye,
waiting at the port of Dakar for any news of her 9-year-old son,
Abdoulaye, who was on board.</TE>
<TE>   France, Senegal's colonial ruler, said it had lent a naval rescue
plane, a military helicopter and divers, and two ships to help
Senegal's military.</TE>
<TE>   The Joola was on its way to Dakar from Senegal's fertile southern
region of Casamance when it capsized Thursday night off Gambia, a
miles-wide former British colony surrounded on three sides by
Senegal.</TE>
<TE>   In May 1996, at least 500 people died in the sinking of the MV
Bukoba on Lake Victoria in Tanzania. In April 1994, an estimated 300
people drowned when an overloaded ferry capsized off Kenya's Indian
Ocean coast.</TE>
<TE>   The Senegalese ferry had been the prime means by which many
citizens crossed between the north and south of their country.</TE>

<PH>ENRIQUE'S JOURNEY / CHAPTER ONE</PH>
<KH></KH>
<HD>The Boy Left Behind</HD>
<DH>In the vast migration that is changing the U.S., thousands
of children travel alone, seeking the mothers who went before them.
Most are visited by cruelty. Some are touched by kindness. Success
comes only to the brave and the lucky.</DH>
<SE>ENRIQUE'S JOURNEY: This is part one in a six-part series chronicling
the journey of Enrique, above, who traveled alone from Honduras as a
teenager in search of his mother.</SE>
<AU>SONIA NAZARIO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The boy does not understand.</LD>
<LD>   His mother is not talking to him. She will not even look at him.
Enrique has no hint of what she is going to do.</LD>
<LD>   Lourdes knows. She understands, as only a mother can, the terror
she is about to inflict, the ache Enrique will feel and finally the
emptiness.</LD>
<TE>   What will become of him? Already he will not let anyone else
feed or bathe him. He loves her deeply, as only a son can. With Lourdes,
he is a chatterbox. "Mira, Mami. Look, Mom," he says softly, asking
her questions about everything he sees. Without her, he is so shy it
is crushing.</TE>
<TE>   Slowly, she walks out onto the porch. Enrique clings to her pant
leg. Beside her, he is tiny. Lourdes loves him so much she cannot
bring herself to say a word. She cannot carry his picture. It would
melt her resolve. She cannot hug him. He is 5 years old.</TE>
<TE>   They live on the outskirts of Tegucigalpa, in Honduras. She can
barely afford food for him and his sister, Belky, who is 7. Lourdes,
24, scrubs other people's laundry in a muddy river. She fills a
wooden box with gum and crackers and cigarettes, and she finds a spot
where she can squat on a dusty sidewalk next to the downtown Pizza
Hut and sell the items to passersby. The sidewalk is Enrique's
playground.</TE>
<TE>   They have a bleak future. He and Belky are not likely to finish
grade school. Lourdes cannot afford uniforms or pencils. Her husband
is gone. A good job is out of the question. So she has decided: She
will leave. She will go to the United States and make money and send
it home. She will be gone for one year, less with luck, or she will
bring her children to be with her. It is for them she is leaving, she
tells herself, but still, she feels guilty.</TE>
<TE>   She kneels and kisses Belky and hugs her tightly.</TE>
<TE>   Then Lourdes turns to her own sister. If she watches over Belky,
she will get a set of gold fingernails from El Norte.</TE>
<TE>   But Lourdes cannot face Enrique. He will remember only one thing
that she says to him: "Don't forget to go to church this afternoon."</TE>
<TE>   It is Jan. 29, 1989. His mother steps off the porch.</TE>
<TE>   She walks away.</TE>
<TE>   "Donde esta mi mami?" Enrique cries, over and over. "Where is my
mom?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   His mother never returns, and that decides Enrique's fate. As a
teenager--indeed, still a child--he will set out for the U.S. on his
own to search for her. Virtually unnoticed, he will become one of an
estimated 48,000 children who enter the United States from Central
America and Mexico each year, illegally and without either of their
parents. Roughly two-thirds of them will make it past the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service.</TE>
<TE>   Many go north seeking work. Others flee abusive families. Most of
the Central Americans go to reunite with a parent, say counselors at
a detention center in Texas where the INS houses the largest number
of the unaccompanied children it catches. Of those, the counselors
say, 75% are looking for their mothers. Some children say they need
to find out whether their mothers still love them. A priest at a
Texas shelter says they often bring pictures of themselves in their
mothers' arms.</TE>
<TE>   The journey is hard for the Mexicans but harder still for Enrique
and the others from Central America. They must make an illegal and
dangerous trek up the length of Mexico. Counselors and immigration
lawyers say only half of them get help from smugglers. The rest
travel alone. They are cold, hungry and helpless. They are hunted
like animals by corrupt police, bandits and gang members deported
from the United States. A University of Houston study found that most
are robbed, beaten or raped, usually several times. Some are killed.</TE>
<TE>   They set out with little or no money. Thousands, shelter workers
say, make their way through Mexico clinging to the sides and tops of
freight trains. Since the 1990s, Mexico and the United States have
tried to thwart them. To evade Mexican police and immigration
authorities, the children jump on and off the moving train cars.
Sometimes they fall, and the wheels tear them apart.</TE>
<TE>   They navigate by word of mouth or by the arc of the sun.
Often, they don't know where or when they'll get their next meal. Some
go days without eating. If a train stops even briefly, they crouch by
the tracks, cup their hands and steal sips of water from shiny
puddles tainted with diesel fuel. At night, they huddle together on
the train cars or next to the tracks. They sleep in trees, in tall
grass or in beds made of leaves.</TE>
<TE>   Some are very young. Mexican rail workers have encountered
7-year-olds on their way to find their mothers. A policeman
discovered a 9-year-old boy four years ago near the downtown Los
Angeles tracks. "I'm looking for my mother," he said. The youngster
had left Puerto Cortes in Honduras three months before, guided only
by his cunning and the single thing he knew about her: where she lived.
He asked everyone: "How do I get to San Francisco?"</TE>
<TE>   Typically the children are teenagers. Some were babies when their
mothers left; they know them only by pictures sent home. Others, a
bit older, struggle to hold on to memories: One has slept in her
mother's bed; another has smelled her perfume, put on her deodorant,
her clothes. One is old enough to remember his mother's face, another
her laugh, her favorite shade of lipstick, how her dress felt as she
stood at the stove patting tortillas.</TE>
<TE>   Many, including Enrique, begin to idealize their mothers. In their
absence, these mothers become larger than life. Although the women
struggle to pay rent and eat in the United States, in the
imaginations of their children back home they become deliverance
itself, the answer to every problem. Finding them becomes the quest
for the Holy Grail.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CONFUSION</TE>
<TE>   Enrique is bewildered. Who will take care of him now that his
mother is gone? For two years, he is entrusted to his father, Luis,
from whom his mother had been separated for three years.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique clings to his daddy, who dotes on him. A bricklayer, his
father takes Enrique to work and lets him help mix mortar. They live
with Enrique's grandmother. His father shares a bed with him and
brings him apples and clothes. Every month, Enrique misses his mother
less, but he does not forget her.</TE>
<TE>   "When is she coming for me?" he says.</TE>
<TE>   Lourdes crosses into the United States in one of the largest
immigrant waves in the country's history. She enters through a
rat-infested Tijuana sewage tunnel and makes her way to Los Angeles.
She moves in with a Beverly Hills couple to take care of their
3-year-old daughter. Every morning as the couple leave for work, the
little girl cries for her mother. Lourdes feeds her breakfast and
thinks of Enrique and Belky. "I'm giving this girl food," she says to
herself, "instead of feeding my own children." After seven months,
she cannot take it. She quits and moves to a friend's place in Long
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Boxes arrive in Tegucigalpa bearing clothes, shoes, toy cars, a
Robocop doll, a television. Lourdes writes: Do they like the things
she is sending? She tells Enrique to behave, to study hard. She has
hopes for him: graduation from high school, a white-collar job, maybe
as an engineer. She says she loves him.</TE>
<TE>   She will be home soon, his grandmother says.</TE>
<TE>   But his mother does not come. Her disappearance
is incomprehensible. Enrique's bewilderment turns to confusion and then
to adolescent anger.</TE>
<TE>   When Enrique is 7, his father brings home a woman. To her, Enrique
is an economic burden. One morning, she spills hot cocoa and burns
him. His father throws her out. But their separation is brief.
Enrique's father bathes, dresses, splashes on cologne and follows her.
Enrique tags along and begs to stay with him.  But his father tells him to
go back to his grandmother.</TE>
<TE>   His father begins a new family. Enrique sees him rarely,
usually by chance. "He doesn't love me," he tells Belky. "I don't have a
dad."</TE>
<TE>   For Belky, their mother's disappearance is just as distressing.
She lives with Aunt Rosa Amalia, one of her mother's sisters. On
Mother's Day, Belky struggles through a celebration at school. That
night she cries quietly, alone in her room. Then she scolds herself.
She should thank her mother for leaving; without the money she sends
for books and uniforms, Belky could not even attend school. She
commiserates with a friend whose mother has also left. They console
each other. They know a girl whose mother died of a heart attack. At
least, they say, ours are alive.</TE>
<TE>   But Rosa Amalia thinks the separation has caused deep emotional
problems. To her, it seems that Belky struggles with an unavoidable
question: How can I be worth something if my mother left me?</TE>
<TE>   Confused by all of this, Enrique turns to his grandmother. Alone
now, he and his father's elderly mother share a shack 30 feet square.
Maria Marcos built it herself of wooden slats. Enrique can see
daylight in the cracks. It has four rooms, three without electricity.
There is no running water. Gutters carry rain off the patched tin
roof into two barrels. A trickle of cloudy white sewage runs past the
front gate. On a well-worn rock nearby, Enrique's grandmother washes
musty used clothing she sells door to door. Next to the rock is the
latrine--a concrete hole. Beside it are buckets for bathing.</TE>
<TE>   The shack is in Carrizal, one of Tegucigalpa's poorest
neighborhoods. Sometimes Enrique looks across the rolling hills to
the neighborhood where he and his mother had lived and where Belky
still lives with their mother's family. They are six miles apart.
They hardly ever visit.</TE>
<TE>   Lourdes sends Enrique $50 a month, occasionally $100, sometimes
nothing. It is enough for food, but not for school clothes, fees,
notebooks or pencils, which are expensive in Honduras. There is never
enough for a birthday present. But Grandmother Maria hugs him and
wishes him a cheery "Feliz cumpleanos!"</TE>
<TE>   "Your mom can't send enough," she says, "so we both have to work."</TE>
<TE>   After school, Enrique sells tamales and plastic bags of fruit
juice from a bucket hung in the crook of his arm.</TE>
<TE>   "Tamarindo! Pina!" he shouts.</TE>
<TE>   After he turns 10, he rides buses alone to an outdoor food market.
He stuffs tiny bags with nutmeg, curry and paprika, then seals them
with hot wax. He pauses at big black gates in front of the market and
calls out, "Va a querer especias? Who wants spices?" He has no
vendor's license, so he keeps moving, darting between wooden carts
piled with papayas.</TE>
<TE>   Grandmother Maria cooks plantains, spaghetti and fresh eggs.
Now and then, she kills a chicken and prepares it for him. In return,
when she is sick, Enrique rubs medicine on her back. He brings water
to her in bed.</TE>
<TE>   Every year on Mother's Day, he makes a heart-shaped card at school
and presses it into her hand.</TE>
<TE>   "I love you very much, Grandma," he writes.</TE>
<TE>   But she is not his mother. Enrique longs to hear Lourdes' voice.
His only way of talking to her is at the home of a cousin, Maria
Edelmira Sanchez Mejia, one of the few family members who have a
telephone. His mother seldom calls. One year she does not call at
all.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought you had died, girl!" Maria Edelmira says.</TE>
<TE>   Better to send money, Lourdes replies, than burn it up on
the phone. But there is another reason she hasn't called. A boyfriend
from Honduras had joined her in Long Beach. She unintentionally
became pregnant, and now he has been deported. She and her new
daughter, Diana, 2, are living in a garage, sometimes on emergency
welfare. There are good months, though, when she can earn $1,000 to
$1,200 cleaning offices and homes. Scrubbing floors bloodies her
knees, but she takes extra jobs, one at a candy factory for $2.25 an
hour. Besides the cash for Enrique, every month she sends $50 each to
her mother and Belky.</TE>
<TE>   It is no substitute for her presence. Belky, now 9, is furious
about the new baby. Their mother might lose interest in her and
Enrique, and the baby will make it harder to wire money and save so
she can bring them north.</TE>
<TE>   For Enrique, each telephone call grows more strained. Because he
lives across town, he is not often lucky enough to be at Maria
Edelmira's house when his mother phones. When he is, their talk is
clipped and anxious.</TE>
<TE>   Quietly, however, one of these conversations plants the seed of an
idea. Unwittingly, Lourdes sows it herself.</TE>
<TE>   "When are you coming home?" Enrique asks.</TE>
<TE>   She avoids an answer. Instead, she promises to send for him very
soon.</TE>
<TE>   It had never occurred to him: If she will not come home, then
maybe he can go to her. Neither he nor his mother realizes it, but
this kernel of an idea will take root. From now on, whenever Enrique
speaks to her, he ends by saying, "I want to be with you."</TE>
<TE>   On the telephone, Lourdes' own mother begs her, "Come home."</TE>
<TE>   Pride forbids it. How can she justify leaving her children if she
returns empty-handed? Four blocks from her mother's place is a white
house with purple trim. It takes up half a block behind black iron
gates. The house belongs to a woman whose children went to
Washington, D.C., and sent her the money to build it. Lourdes cannot
afford such a house for her mother, much less herself.</TE>
<TE>   But she develops a plan. She will become a resident and bring her
children to the United States legally. Three times, she hires
storefront immigration counselors who promise help. She pays them a
total of $3,850. A woman in Long Beach, whose house she cleans,
agrees to sponsor her residency. But the counselors never deliver.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be back next Christmas," she tells Enrique.</TE>
<TE>   Christmas arrives, and he waits by the door. She does not come.
Every year, she promises. Each year, he is disappointed. Confusion
finally grows into anger. "I need her. I miss her," he tells his
sister. "I want to be with my mother. I see so many children with
mothers. I want that."</TE>
<TE>   One day, he asks his grandmother, "How did my mom get to the
United States?"</TE>
<TE>   Years later, Enrique will remember his grandmother's reply--and
how another seed was planted: "Maybe," Maria said, "she went on the
trains."</TE>
<TE>   "What are the trains like?"</TE>
<TE>   "They are very, very dangerous," his grandmother said. "Many
people die on the trains."</TE>
<TE>   When Enrique is 12, Lourdes tells him yet again that she will come
home.</TE>
<TE>   "Si," he replies. "Va, pues. Sure. Sure."</TE>
<TE>   Enrique senses a truth: Very few mothers ever return. He tells her
that he doesn't think she is coming back. To himself, he says, "It's
all one big lie."</TE>
<TE>   Lourdes does consider hiring a smuggler to bring the children but
fears the danger. The coyotes, as they are called, are often
alcoholics or drug addicts. Sometimes they abandon their charges. "Do
I want to have them with me so badly," she asks herself, "that I'm
willing to risk their losing their lives?" Besides, she does not want
Enrique to come to California. There are too many gangs, drugs and
crimes.</TE>
<TE>   In any event, she has not saved enough. The cheapest coyote,
immigrant advocates say, charges $3,000 per child. Female coyotes
want up to $6,000. A top smuggler will bring a child by commercial
flight for $10,000.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique despairs. He will simply have to do it himself. He will go
find her. He will ride the trains.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to come," he tells her.</TE>
<TE>   Don't even joke about it, she says. It is too dangerous. Be
patient.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   REBELLION</TE>
<TE>   Now Enrique's anger boils over. He refuses to make his Mother's
Day card at school. He begins hitting other kids. He lifts the
teacher's skirt.</TE>
<TE>   He stands on top of the teacher's desk and bellows, "Who is
Enrique?"</TE>
<TE>   "You!" the class replies.</TE>
<TE>   Three times, he is suspended. Twice he repeats a grade. But
Enrique never abandons his promise to study. Unlike half the children
from his neighborhood, he completes elementary school. There is a
small ceremony. A teacher hugs him and mutters, "Thank God, Enrique's
out of here."</TE>
<TE>   He stands proud in a blue gown and mortarboard. But nobody from
his mother's family comes to the graduation.</TE>
<TE>   Now he is 14, a teenager. He spends more time on the streets of
Carrizal, which is quickly becoming one of Tegucigalpa's toughest
neighborhoods. His grandmother tells him to come home early. But he
plays soccer until midnight. He refuses to sell spices. It is
embarrassing when girls see him peddle fruit cups or when they hear
someone call him "the tamale man."</TE>
<TE>   He stops going to church.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't hang out with bad boys," Grandmother Maria says.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't pick my friends!" Enrique replies. She is not his
mother, he tells her, and she has no right to tell him what to do.</TE>
<TE>   He stays out all night.</TE>
<TE>   His grandmother waits up for him, crying. "Why are you doing this
to me?" she asks. "Don't you love me? I am going to send you away."</TE>
<TE>   "Send me! No one loves me."</TE>
<TE>   But she says she does love him. She only wants him to work and to
be honorable, so that he can hold his head up high.</TE>
<TE>   He replies that he will do what he wants.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique has become her youngest child. "Please bury me," she says.
"Stay with me. If you do, all this is yours." She prays that she can
hold on to him until his mother sends for him. But her own children
say Enrique has to go: She is 70, and he will bury her, all right, by
sending her to the grave.</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, she writes to Lourdes: You must find him another home.</TE>
<TE>   To Enrique, it is another rejection. First his mother, then his
father and now his grandmother.</TE>
<TE>   Lourdes arranges for a brother, Marco Antonio Zablah, to take him
in.</TE>
<TE>   Her gifts arrive steadily. She is proud that her money pays
Belky's tuition at a private high school and eventually a college, to
study accounting. Kids from poor neighborhoods almost never go to
college.</TE>
<TE>   Money from Lourdes helps Enrique too, and he realizes it. If she
were here, he knows where he might well be: scavenging in the trash
dump across town. Lourdes knows it too; as a girl, she herself worked
the dump. Enrique knows children as young as 6 or 7 whose single
mothers have stayed at home and who have had to root through the
waste in order to eat.</TE>
<TE>   Truck after truck rumbles onto the hilltop. Dozens of adults and
children fight for position. Each truck dumps its load. Feverishly,
the scavengers reach up into the sliding ooze to pluck out bits of
plastic, wood and tin. The trash squishes beneath their feet,
moistened by loads from hospitals, full of blood and placentas.
Occasionally a child, with hands blackened by garbage, picks up a
piece of stale bread and eats it. As the youngsters sort through the
stinking stew, thousands of sleek, black buzzards soar in a dark,
swirling cloud.</TE>
<TE>   A year after Enrique goes to live with his uncle, Lourdes
calls--this time from North Carolina. "California is too hard," she
says. "There are too many immigrants." Employers pay poorly and treat
them badly. Here people are less hostile. Work is plentiful. She
works on an assembly line for $9.05 an hour--$13.50 when she works
overtime--and waits tables. She has met someone, a house painter from
Honduras, and they are moving in together.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique misses her enormously. But Uncle Marco and his girlfriend
treat him well. Marco is a money changer on the Honduran border, and
his family, including a son, lives in a five-bedroom house in a
middle-class neighborhood of Tegucigalpa. Uncle Marco gives Enrique a
daily allowance, buys him clothes and sends him to a private military
school.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique runs errands for his uncle, washes his five cars, follows
him everywhere. His uncle pays as much attention to him as he does
his own son, if not more. "Negrito," he calls him fondly, because of
his dark skin. Although he is in his teens, Enrique is small, just
shy of 5 feet, even when he straightens up from a slight stoop. He
has a big smile and perfect teeth.</TE>
<TE>   His uncle trusts him, even to make bank deposits. He tells
Enrique, "I want you to work with me forever."</TE>
<TE>   One week, as his uncle's security guard returns from trading
Honduran lempiras, robbers drag the guard off a bus and kill him. The
guard has a son 23 years old, and the slaying impels the young man to
go to the United States. He comes back before crossing the Rio Grande
and tells Enrique about riding on trains, leaping off rolling freight
cars and dodging la migra, Mexican immigration agents.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the security guard's murder, Marco swears that he will
never change money again. A few months later, though, he gets a call.
For a large commission, would he exchange $50,000 in lempiras on the
border with El Salvador? Uncle Marco promises that this will be the
last time.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique wants to go with him.</TE>
<TE>   But his uncle says he is too young. He takes one of his own
brothers instead.</TE>
<TE>   Robbers riddle their car with bullets. Enrique's uncles careen off
the road. The thieves shoot Uncle Marco three times in the chest and
once in the leg. They shoot his brother in the face. Both die.</TE>
<TE>   Now Uncle Marco is gone.</TE>
<TE>   In nine years, Lourdes has saved $700 toward bringing her children
to the United States. Instead, she uses it to help pay for her
brothers' funerals.</TE>
<TE>   Within days, Uncle Marco's girlfriend sells Enrique's television,
stereo and Nintendo game--all gifts from Marco. Without telling him
why, she says, "I don't want you here anymore." She puts his bed out
on the street.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ADDICTION</TE>
<TE>   Enrique, now 15, gathers his clothing and goes to his maternal
grandmother.</TE>
<TE>   "Can I stay here?" he asks.</TE>
<TE>   This had been his first home, the small stucco house where he and
Lourdes lived until Lourdes stepped off the front porch and left. His
second home was the wooden shack where he and his father lived with
his father's mother, until his father found a new wife and left. His
third home was the comfortable house where he lived with his Uncle
Marco.</TE>
<TE>   Now he is back where he began. Seven people live here already: his
grandmother, Agueda Amalia Valladares; two divorced aunts; and four
young cousins. They are poor. "We need money just for food," says his
grandmother, who suffers from cataracts. Nonetheless, she takes him
in.</TE>
<TE>   She and the others are consumed by the slayings of the two uncles;
they pay little attention to Enrique. He grows quiet, introverted.</TE>
<TE>   He does not return to school.</TE>
<TE>   At first, he shares the front bedroom with an aunt, Mirian Liliana
Aguilera, 26. One day she awakens at 2 a.m. Enrique is sobbing
quietly in his bed, cradling a picture of Uncle Marco in his arms.
Enrique cries off and on for six months. His uncle loved him; without
his uncle, he is lost.</TE>
<TE>   Grandmother Agueda sours quickly on Enrique. She grows angry when
he comes home late, knocking on her door, rousing the household.
About a month later, Aunt Mirian wakes up again in the middle of the
night. This time she smells acetone and hears the rustle of plastic.
Through the dimness, she sees Enrique in his bed, puffing on a bag.
He is sniffing glue.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique is banished to a tiny stone building seven feet behind the
house but a world away. It was once a cook shack, where his
grandmother prepared food on an open fire. Its walls and ceiling are
charred black. It has no electricity. The wooden door pries only
partway open, and the single window has no glass, just bars. A few
feet beyond is his privy--a hole with a wooden shanty over it.</TE>
<TE>   The stone hut becomes his home.</TE>
<TE>   Now Enrique can do whatever he wants. If he is out all night, no
one cares. But to him, it feels like another rejection.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby is a neighborhood called El Infiernito, or Little Hell,
controlled by a street gang, the Mara Salvatrucha. Some MS have been
U.S. residents, living in Los Angeles until 1996, when a federal law
began requiring judges to deport them if they committed serious
crimes. Now they are active throughout much of Central America and
Mexico. Here in El Infiernito, they carry chimbas, guns fashioned
from plumbing pipes, and they drink charamila, diluted rubbing
alcohol. They ride the buses, robbing passengers.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique and a friend, Jose del Carmen Bustamante, 16, venture into
El Infiernito to buy marijuana. It is dangerous. On one occasion,
Jose is threatened by a man who wraps a chain around his neck. The
boys never linger. They take their joints partway up a hill to a
billiard hall, where they sit outside smoking and listening to the
music that drifts through the open doors.</TE>
<TE>   With them are two other friends. Both have tried to ride freight
trains to El Norte. One is known as El Gato, the cat. He talks about
migra agents shooting over his head and how easy it is to be robbed
by bandits. In Enrique's marijuana haze, train-riding sounds like an
adventure.</TE>
<TE>   He and Jose resolve to try it soon.</TE>
<TE>   Some nights, at 10 or so, they climb a steep, winding path to the
top of another hill. Hidden beside a wall scrawled with graffiti,
they inhale glue late into the night. One day, Enrique's girlfriend,
Maria Isabel Caria Duron, 17, turns a street corner and bumps into
him. She is overwhelmed. He smells like an open can of paint.</TE>
<TE>   "What's that?" she asks, reeling away from the fumes. "Are you on
drugs?''</TE>
<TE>   "No!" Enrique says.</TE>
<TE>   He tries to hide his habit. He dabs a bit of glue into a plastic
bag and stuffs it into a pocket. Alone, he opens the end over his
mouth and inhales, pressing the bottom of the bag toward his face,
pushing the fumes into his lungs.</TE>
<TE>   Belky notices cloudy yellow fingerprints on Maria Isabel's jeans:
glue, a remnant of Enrique's embrace.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Isabel sees him change. His mouth is sweaty and sticky. He
is jumpy and nervous. His eyes grow red. Sometimes they are glassy,
half-closed. Other times he looks drunk. If she asks a question, the
response is delayed. His temper is quick. On a high, he grows quiet,
sleepy and distant. When he comes down, he becomes hysterical and
insulting.</TE>
<TE>   Drogo. Drug addict, one of his aunts calls him.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes he hallucinates that someone is chasing him. He imagines
gnomes and fixates on ants. He sees a cartoon-like Winnie the Pooh
soaring in front of him. He walks, but he cannot feel the ground.
Sometimes his legs will not respond. Houses move. Occasionally, the
floor falls.</TE>
<TE>   For two particularly bad weeks, he doesn't recognize family
members. His hands tremble. He coughs black phlegm.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AN EDUCATION</TE>
<TE>   Enrique marks his 16th birthday. All he wants is his mother. One
Sunday, he and his friend Jose put train-riding to the test. They
leave for El Norte.</TE>
<TE>   At first, no one notices. They take buses across Guatemala to the
Mexican border.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a mom in the U.S.," Enrique tells a guard.</TE>
<TE>   "Go home," the man replies.</TE>
<TE>   They slip past the guard and make their way 12 miles into Mexico
to Tapachula. There they approach a freight train near the depot. But
before they can reach the tracks, police stop them. The officers rob
them, the boys say later, but then let them go--Jose first, Enrique
afterward.</TE>
<TE>   They find each other and another train. Now, for the first time,
Enrique clambers aboard. The train crawls out of the Tapachula
station. From here on, he thinks, nothing bad can happen.</TE>
<TE>   They know nothing about riding the rails.</TE>
<TE>   Jose is terrified. Enrique, who is braver, jumps from car to car
on the slow-moving train. He slips and falls--away from the tracks,
luckily--and lands on a backpack padded with a shirt and an extra
pair of pants.</TE>
<TE>   He scrambles aboard again.</TE>
<TE>   But their odyssey comes to a humiliating halt.</TE>
<TE>   Near Tierra Blanca, a small town in Veracruz state, authorities
snatch them from the top of a freight car. The officers take them to
a cell filled with MS gangsters, then deport them. Enrique is bruised
and limping, and he misses Maria Isabel. They find coconuts to sell
for bus fare and go home.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A DECISION</TE>
<TE>   Enrique sinks deeper into drugs. By mid-December, he owes his
marijuana supplier 6,000 lempiras, about $400. He has only 1,000
lempiras. He promises the rest by midweek, but cannot keep his word.
The following weekend, he encounters the dealer on the street.</TE>
<TE>   The supplier accuses Enrique of lying and threatens to kill him.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique pleads with him.</TE>
<TE>   If Enrique doesn't pay up, the dealer vows, he will kill Enrique's
sister. The dealer mistakenly thinks that Enrique's cousin, Tania
Ninoska Turcios, 18, is his sister. Both girls are finishing high
school, and most of the family is away at a Nicaraguan hotel
celebrating their graduation.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique pries open the back door to the house where his Uncle
Carlos Orlando Turcios Ramos and Aunt Rosa Amalia live. He hesitates.
How can he do this to his own family? Three times, he walks up to the
door, opens it, closes it and leaves. Each time, he takes another
deep hit of glue.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, he enters the house, picks open the lock to a bedroom
door, then jimmies the back of his aunt's armoire with a knife. He
stuffs 25 pieces of her jewelry into a plastic bag and hides it under
a rock near the local lumberyard.</TE>
<TE>   At 10 p.m., the family returns to find the bedroom ransacked.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors say the dog did not bark.</TE>
<TE>   "It must have been Enrique," Aunt Rosa Amalia says. She calls the
police. Uncle Carlos and several officers go to find him.</TE>
<TE>   "Why did you do this? Why?" Aunt Rosa Amalia yells.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't me." As soon as he says it, he flushes with shame and
guilt. The police handcuff him. In their patrol car, he trembles and
begins to cry. "I was drugged. I didn't want to do it." He tells the
officers that a dealer wanting money had threatened to kill Tania.</TE>
<TE>   He leads police to the bag of jewelry.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you want us to lock him up?" the police ask.</TE>
<TE>   Uncle Carlos thinks of Lourdes. They cannot do this to her.
Instead, he orders Tania to stay indoors indefinitely, for her own
safety.</TE>
<TE>   But the robbery finally convinces Uncle Carlos that Enrique needs
help. He finds him a $15-a-week job at a tire store. He eats lunch
with him every day--chicken and homemade soup. He tells the family
they must show him their love.</TE>
<TE>   During the next month, January 2000, Enrique tries to quit drugs.
He cuts back, but then he gives in. Every night, he comes home later.
He looks at himself in disgust. He is dressing like a slob--his life
is unraveling. He is lucid enough to tell Belky that he knows what he
has to do.</TE>
<TE>   He simply has to go find his mother.</TE>
<TE>   Aunt Ana Lucia Aguilera agrees. She and Enrique have clashed for
months. Ana Lucia is the only breadwinner. Even with his job at the
tire store, Enrique is an economic drain.</TE>
<TE>   Worse, he is sullying the only thing her family owns: its good
name.</TE>
<TE>   They speak bitter words that both, along with Enrique's
Grandmother Agueda, will recall months later. "Where are you coming
from, you old bum?" Ana Lucia asks as Enrique walks in the door.
"Coming home for food, huh?"</TE>
<TE>   "Be quiet!" he says. "I'm not asking anything of you."</TE>
<TE>   "You are a lazy bum! A drug addict! No one wants you here." All
the neighbors can hear. "This isn't your house. Go to your mother!"</TE>
<TE>   Over and over, in a low voice, Enrique says, half pleading, "You
better be quiet."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, he snaps. He kicks Ana Lucia twice, squarely in the
buttocks.</TE>
<TE>   She shrieks.</TE>
<TE>   His grandmother runs out of the house. She grabs a stick and
threatens to club him if he touches Ana Lucia again. Now even his
grandmother wishes he would go to the United States. He is hurting
the family--and himself. She says, "He'll be better off there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   GOODBYE</TE>
<TE>   Maria Isabel, Enrique's girlfriend, finds him sitting on a rock
at a street corner, weeping, rejected again. She tries to comfort him.
He is high on glue.  He tells her he sees a wall of fire that is killing
his mother.  "Por que me dejo?" he cries out.  "Why did she leave me?"</TE>
<TE>   He feels shame for what he has done to his family and what he is
doing to Maria Isabel, who might be pregnant. He fears he will end up
on the streets or dead. Only his mother can help him. She is his
salvation. "If you had known my mom, you would know she's a good
person," he says to his friend Jose. "I love her.''</TE>
<TE>   Enrique has to find her. He sells the few things he owns: his
bed, a gift from his mother; his leather jacket, a gift from his dead
uncle; his rustic armoire, where he hangs his clothes.</TE>
<TE>   He crosses town to say goodbye to Grandmother Maria. Trudging up
the hill to her house, he encounters his father. "I'm leaving," he
says. "I'm going to make it to the U.S." He asks him for money.</TE>
<TE>   His father gives him enough for a soda and wishes him luck.</TE>
<TE>   "Grandma, I'm leaving," Enrique says. "I'm going to find my mom."</TE>
<TE>   Don't go, she pleads. She promises to build him a one-room house
in the corner of her cramped lot.</TE>
<TE>   But he has made up his mind.</TE>
<TE>   She gives him 100 lempiras, about $7--all the money she has.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm leaving already, Sis," he tells Belky the next morning.</TE>
<TE>   She feels her stomach tighten. They have lived most of their lives
apart, but he is the only one who understands her loneliness. Quietly
she fixes a special meal: tortillas, a pork cutlet, rice, fried beans
with a sprinkling of cheese.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't leave," she says, tears welling in her eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to."</TE>
<TE>   It is hard for him too. Every time he has talked to his mother,
she has warned him not to come--it's too dangerous. But if somehow he
gets to the U.S. border, he will call her.  Being so close, she'll have to
welcome him.  "If I call her from there," he says to Jose, "how can she
not accept me?"</TE>
<TE>   He makes himself one promise: "I'm going to reach the United
States, even if it takes one year."</TE>
<TE>   Only after a year passes will he give up, turn on his heel and go
back.</TE>
<TE>   Quietly, Enrique, the slight kid with a boyish grin, fond of
kites, spaghetti, soccer and break dancing, who likes to play in the
mud and watch Mickey Mouse cartoons with his 4-year-old cousin, packs
up his belongings: corduroy pants, a T-shirt, a cap, gloves, a
toothbrush and toothpaste.</TE>
<TE>   For a long moment, he looks at a picture of his mother, but he
does not take it. He might lose it.</TE>
<TE>   He writes her telephone number on a scrap of paper. Just in case,
he also scrawls it in ink on the inside waistband of his pants.</TE>
<TE>   He has $57 in his pocket.</TE>
<TE>   On March 2, 2000, he goes to his Grandmother Agueda's house. He
stands on the same porch that his mother disappeared from 11 years
before.</TE>
<TE>   He hugs Maria Isabel and Aunt Rosa Amalia. Then he steps off.</TE>

<HD>Novelty of China's 'Holiday Economy' Is Wearing Off</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHING-CHING NI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SHANGHAI</DL>
<LD>Imagine 1.3 billion people getting a seven-day paid vacation at the
same time. Now imagine that happening three times a year.</LD>
<LD>   It's a holiday with Chinese characteristics. And leaders of the
world's most populous country swear by the power of mandatory rest
and recreation to keep the economy humming.</LD>
<LD>   But three years into the experiment, critics complain that not
only has the highly touted "holiday economy" failed to stimulate
domestic consumption significantly, but it has also hurt some
businesses and put an extraordinary strain on the country's tourist
attractions.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think the holiday economy concept works," said Li
Zhining, an economics professor at the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences in Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Asia had just emerged from a devastating financial
crisis. There seemed no better way to ward off deflationary pressures
and make up for lost business than mobilizing China's own masses to
spend money. So in October 1999, Beijing created a weeklong holiday
to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the People's Republic. A year
later, authorities added the week surrounding Chinese New Year, which
falls around February. Finally, they threw in the traditional May
Day, which also grew from one to seven days off.</TE>
<TE>   At first, the novelty of a long paid holiday enticed a lot of
people to travel and splurge.</TE>
<TE>   According to some estimates, about 200 million Chinese hit the
road during last year's breaks and pumped more than $8 billion into
the economy.</TE>
<TE>   But the novelty is wearing off.</TE>
<TE>   Most Chinese can't afford to travel three times a year, year after
year. Those who can now want to avoid taking holidays with the rest
of the country. Nobody likes bumping into a sea of people, whether
climbing the Great Wall or dipping into the South China Sea.</TE>
<TE>   Prices for package tours already are dropping as travel agencies
face fallen demand leading up to this week's National Day break.</TE>
<TE>   "Many customers complain about traffic jams, poor services and a
lack of quality accommodations," said Chen Yimin, a manager at a
Shanghai travel agency. "But we have no choice. How could the
hospitality industry provide good services when so many people travel
at the same time?"</TE>
<TE>   Hotels, restaurants and retailers acknowledge doing brisk
businesses during the three holidays. But sales tend to drop
precipitously afterward.</TE>
<TE>   The problem, some economists point out, is money. Unemployment is
still a major problem as China undergoes a painful restructuring of
its ailing state-owned enterprises. People don't have enough
disposable income to do the heavy lifting the government expects.</TE>
<TE>   The Chinese are also savers--they've stashed away more than $1
trillion in personal savings accounts. But experts say the bulk of
that money belongs to the country's wealthy few. These deep pockets
are unlikely to turn into big spenders on demand.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, most of them tend to invest money overseas. Local
newspapers are full of reports about well-off Chinese going abroad
and buying multiple homes in cash.</TE>
<TE>   "Ordinary Chinese people live on small salaries," Li said. "But
things like health care, education and housing that used to be
subsidized by the state now must come out of their own pockets. Where
is the extra money to shop and travel?"</TE>
<TE>   A better incentive would be creating more jobs and increasing the
people's purchasing power, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "Long holidays can change when people spend money, but it can't
change how much they will spend," economist Zhao Xiao said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, businesses from lightbulb makers to telecommunications
to car manufacturers also are crying foul. To them, the sudden exodus
of workers and a total shutdown of government agencies amount to a
logistics nightmare akin to a general strike.</TE>
<TE>   "The complete closure of all government offices, bureaus, banks
and state-owned enterprises, without any viable level of service
remaining whatsoever, causes a major slowdown in manufacturing and
trade for both domestic and foreign enterprises," according to a
letter a group of multinational companies recently sent to Chinese
officials. "The complete closure also creates a substantial
communication breakdown between domestic and international customers,
suppliers, sales and distribution [networks]."</TE>
<TE>   Another frustration for businesses is that the government orders
people to work and go to school during the weekend before the long
holidays. That can mean toiling nine consecutive days without a
break. It translates to employee fatigue and lower productivity. By
the time the vacation rolls around, many are too tired to enjoy it.</TE>
<TE>   China eventually might come to the conclusion that it makes more
economic sense to give people the freedom to choose when to work and
when to play.</TE>
<TE>   "The holiday economy is about the state meddling with the market,"
economist Zhao told a Chinese magazine. "Once it's proven to be
totally ineffective, it will definitely exit the stage of history."</TE>

<HD>Post-Rally Stampede at Train Station in Northern India
Claims 14 Lives</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>LUCKNOW, India</DL>
<LD>At least 14 people died and 19 were injured in a stampede in northern
India on Saturday as thousands of people raced to board trains after
a huge political rally, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   "After the rally ended, a lot of people rushed to catch the train.
One man fell down. A few fell over him, and the stampede started,"
Arun Kumar, deputy inspector-general of police in Uttar Pradesh
state, told the private Aaj Tak television channel.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the dead were trampled to death, officials said; however,
three apparently were electrocuted by overhead wires when they
clambered on top of railway coaches after failing to find room
inside.</LD>
<TE>   An estimated 200,000 people had attended the rally by the Bahujan
Samaj Party, the senior partner in the state's coalition government.
The BSP represents the "scheduled castes," previously known as
"untouchables" in Indian hierarchy.</TE>
<TE>   The rally--in the Uttar Pradesh state capital, Lucknow, 250 miles
southeast of New Delhi--was in protest of a local politician who
allegedly made disparaging remarks about Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, a
hero of the scheduled castes.</TE>
<TE>   The BSP is allied with the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata
Party of Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee.</TE>

<HD>Iraqis Won't Yield on Access</HD>
<DH>Inspections: Baghdad refuses to open restricted sites and
threatens U.S. with losses 'that have not been sustained in decades'
if it is attacked.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAGGIE FARLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Iraq on Saturday swiftly rejected a U.S.-British proposal that would
impose stringent rules and a tight deadline for U.N. weapons
inspections, saying it would not accept new terms for inspectors and
would fight fiercely if attacked.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Prime Minister Tarik Aziz said the United States would
suffer losses "that have not been sustained in decades" if it tried
to oust President Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   Baghdad's defiance came amid urgent diplomatic efforts by the U.S.
and Britain to rally support for a tough new Security Council
resolution redrawing the United Nations' rules for weapons
inspections.</LD>
<TE>   The proposed resolution demands that Hussein grant inspectors
access to previously restricted sites, and provides for armed
security to back them up. It would give the Iraqi government seven
days from the resolution's passage to agree to the terms, require
full disclosure of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction within 30
days--and authorize a military attack if Baghdad did not comply.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq announced Sept. 16 that inspectors could return "without
conditions" under existing U.N. resolutions and agreements, which
exempted eight "presidential sites"--including about 12 square miles
of land and more than 1,000 buildings around Hussein's palaces.
Saturday in Baghdad, Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said his
government would not accept new rules.</TE>
<TE>   "Our position on the inspectors has been decided, and any
additional procedure is meant to hurt Iraq and is unacceptable," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration responded that the terms of the
inspectors' work are up to the Security Council to decide.</TE>
<TE>   "Iraq does not have a say in this matter," White House Press
Secretary Ari Fleischer said at President Bush's ranch near Crawford,
Texas. "Even if they did, it again shows that they want to string
things out, change their tune and build up their arms."</TE>
<TE>   Under the draft resolution, if Iraq stuck to its position, the
rejection would trigger the use of "all necessary means"--a
diplomatic euphemism for a military attack. That scenario could
harden objections in Paris, Moscow and Beijing to the use of force
before inspectors have a chance to search for weapons in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday and Saturday, U.S. Undersecretary of State Marc Grossman
and British envoy Peter Ricketts met with French and Russian
officials to try to overcome resistance to the proposed resolution.
The British director of international security, William Ehrman,
traveled to Beijing with the same mission. The U.S., Britain, China,
France and Russia are the five veto-holding members of the Security
Council, and their unity is key to sending a strong signal to Baghdad
that this time, the U.N. means business.</TE>
<TE>   But even after diplomatic consultations, France and Russia
remained unconvinced. Russia has maintained that a new resolution is
not needed for the inspectors' return but that if there is to be new
action, it should follow an idea floated by France of a two-stage
approach: The first resolution would redefine the conditions for the
inspectors and, if the Iraqis blocked them, the Security Council
would have to pass a second resolution to authorize the use of force.</TE>
<TE>   After the meetings in Moscow, Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov told
Russian television that inspectors should return quickly to "give a
clear answer to the question of whether Iraq has weapons of mass
destruction."</TE>
<TE>   Chinese officials have also said they favor the two-step approach,
and Premier Zhu Rongji, in Paris for economic talks, said Friday that
"there would be incalculable consequences" if the United States
launched a military attack on Iraq without Security Council approval.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and British officials said Saturday that they were still
optimistic about winning the other three members' support.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone agreed that there is a challenge to the United Nations,"
U.S. emissary Grossman said after the meetings in Moscow. "I think
all members of the Security Council want to see if we can solve it."</TE>
<TE>   It is still unclear whether France, Russia and China will be able
to force concessions on the draft or will jointly back an alternative
proposal. The U.S. and Britain plan to formally introduce their draft
in the Security Council this week.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq, for its part, was doing lobbying of its own Saturday, as
Foreign Minister Naji Sabri went to Tehran to seek Iran's support
against U.S. military action. "Arab and Muslim governments have
rejected the option of an attack against Iraq, and the peoples of the
region will stand together against an eventual attack," Sabri said.</TE>
<TE>   Iran has called on its western neighbor, with which it fought a
1980-88 war that killed a million people on both sides, to open its
doors to weapons inspectors. But Tehran also fears that an attack on
Iraq could destabilize the region. After meeting Sabri at the
airport, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi told reporters, "It
is absolutely imperative we make serious efforts to prevent a new war
in the region, because the region cannot support a new war."</TE>
<TE>   British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw is also expected to visit
Tehran in the coming weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Baghdad's defiant stance may affect Monday's talks in Vienna
involving the chief U.N. weapons inspector, Hans Blix, international
nuclear officials and Iraqi officials. The talks were scheduled for
this month immediately after Iraq accepted the return of inspectors,
and until a new resolution overwrites the agreements that set up the
inspection program, the negotiators will discuss logistics under the
old terms.</TE>
<TE>   Still, if the 15-member Security Council agrees on anything, it is
that the old inspections program needs to be strengthened and
deadlines added. Although Blix's aide, Ewen Buchanan, said Friday
before the team left for Vienna that Blix would be amenable to
discussing such matters as basic housing, communications and
transportation arrangements under the existing mandate, everyone at
the table will be aware that the rules could suddenly change.</TE>
<TE>   The first team of U.N. inspectors is set to arrive Oct. 15 in
Baghdad, with a total of 280 team members to be on the ground within
a few months.</TE>
<TE>   The teams will have to reequip themselves before they can begin
visits to suspected sites that have been unmonitored since the
inspectors left Iraq four years ago ahead of a U.S.-British bombing
strike.</TE>
<TE>   Because Iraq has previously possessed and used biological and
chemical weapons and they are easiest to develop and conceal, Iraqi
attempts to buy uranium in Africa--described in a British dossier
released last week--have sparked concerns that a clandestine nuclear
program also is underway.</TE>
<TE>   The arrest in Turkey on Saturday of two Turkish men with more than
33 pounds of weapons-grade uranium--though not linked to Iraq--added
to those fears. The smugglers had hidden the uranium in a lead
container under a taxi seat and were arrested after attempting to
sell it to undercover police officers. The Turkish state-run
Anatolian news agency quoted police officials as saying that they
believed it came from an Eastern European country and were
investigating whether the uranium was destined for a neighboring
state.</TE>
<TE>   The White House had no comment Saturday evening.</TE>

<HD>France Offers Aid to Ivory Coast as Rebels Advance</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>YAMOUSSOUKRO, Ivory Coast</DL>
<LD>France pledged logistical help to its embattled former colony of
Ivory Coast on Saturday, as rebels spread out over more territory and
were within 26 miles of the administrative capital here.</LD>
<LD>   At least 270 people have been killed and thousands have fled their
homes since a failed coup attempt more than a week ago. The uprising
has turned into a wider conflict and left swaths of northern Ivory
Coast in the hands of rebels.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Special Forces and French soldiers settled into makeshift
staging points for any rescue missions for their nationals, after
overseeing an evacuation of thousands of Westerners from the
rebel-held city of Bouake last week.</LD>
<TE>   Mutineers in the north spread out along the western border Friday
and Saturday, meeting little resistance as they moved into Odienne
and then south to Touba, rebel and Western military officials said.
Rebels were within about a dozen miles of Yamoussoukro. They said
they aimed to march on the city and then head for the commercial hub
of Abidjan.</TE>
<TE>   President Laurent Gbagbo's government has repeatedly pledged to
rout the insurgents. French authorities said Saturday that they had
agreed to a government request for logistical help.</TE>
<TE>   "We are mobilized to guarantee the safety of the French community
in Ivory Coast, and we are also providing logistical support to the
Ivory Coast authorities," a French Foreign Ministry statement said.</TE>
<TE>   Details on the timeframe and type of support were not available.</TE>
<TE>   Fearing the danger posed to their own countries from turmoil in
what is the region's second-biggest economy, West African leaders
will meet in Ghana today to discuss the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Minister Moise Lida Kouassi said Ivory Coast is asking
African friends, as well as France, for transportation, field
communications, munitions and other supplies. But he said Ivory Coast
was not seeking troop reinforcements or an intervention force.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that our own soldiers can liberate our territory from
this aggression," he said.</TE>

<HD>Blast Rocks Candidate's Convoy in Kashmir; 4 Die</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SRINAGAR, India</DL>
<LD>Suspected Islamic militants blew up a vehicle carrying a legislative
candidate in India's Jammu and Kashmir state Saturday, killing her
father, two supporters and a police escort, an official said.</LD>
<LD>   The explosion hit the convoy of Khaleda Mushtaq, a member of the
opposition Nationalist Congress Party, as she campaigned ahead of
voting Tuesday in the Anantnag district, about 35 miles southeast of
the state's summer capital, Srinagar.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of people have been killed since August in Jammu and
Kashmir, where Islamic militants fighting Indian rule have threatened
to kill candidates and voters. The rebels say the elections are
rigged to favor the ruling pro-India National Conference party.</LD>
<TE>   Mushtaq was seriously wounded in the explosion, while her father,
two of her supporters and a policeman were killed, police said. Two
passersby were wounded.</TE>
<TE>   The blast left a 7-foot crater in the dirt road and hurled
Mushtaq's vehicle about 50 feet into a paddy field, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Anantnag is one of four districts that go to the polls in the
third round of voting scheduled for Jammu and Kashmir on Tuesday. The
elections, which began this month, will end Oct. 8.</TE>
<TE>   New Delhi hopes that strong voter turnout will solidify its rule
in the disputed Kashmir region, which is split between India and
Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Arifeen, which India says is a front for the Pakistan-based
Lashkar-e-Taiba militant group, claimed responsibility for the attack
on Mushtaq's convoy in a call to a local news agency.</TE>
<TE>   The attack came as nearly 1,000 people blocked traffic, threw
stones and shouted anti-Indian slogans in Srinagar after an Indian
security vehicle allegedly struck and killed Muzzamil Ahmad, a
19-year-old Muslim.</TE>

<DL>OMANTHAI, Sri Lanka</DL>
<LD>The Sri Lankan government and Tamil Tiger rebels swapped prisoners of
war Saturday in the latest move to push ahead a peace process after
19 years of war.</LD>
<LD>   The exchange in a dusty no man's land in northern Sri Lanka
happened amid unprecedented scenes of friendliness between top
military leaders from both sides, who mingled with the prisoners to
say their goodbyes. Seven soldiers were exchanged for 11 Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam rebels. Those freed looked healthy and were
smiling.</LD>
<LD>   Sri Lanka's top military officer, army chief Gen. Lionel
Balagalle, sat casually next to the Tamil Tigers' northern commander
Theepan, an encounter unimaginable several months ago.</LD>
<TE>   "It is yet another significant milestone to a negotiated
settlement of what was at one time considered an intractable
conflict," said Austin Fernando, an official in the Defense Ministry.</TE>
<TE>   The swap came less than two weeks after the two sides met in
Thailand.</TE>
<TE>   The rebel prisoners were given gift packs that included chocolate,
crackers, fruit and a card that read "With the compliments" of
Balagalle, the army chief.</TE>
<TE>   "I kept going by the hope I would see my family again," said navy
Capt. Ajith Boyagoda, who was captured by the rebels in a battle
eight years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Freed rebel Kennedy, 32, who like many guerrillas uses only one
name, said, "I am not sure what the future holds, but I'm happy to go
back home." He was captured in a 1994 attack on the Palali military
airfield on the Jaffna peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   The Tamil rebels now say they have no more prisoners of war. The
government says it has rebel detainees who are not considered
prisoners of war.</TE>

<LD>An Islamic party that bans alcohol and favors veils for women more
than doubled its number of seats in parliamentary elections,
according to preliminary government figures released today.</LD>
<LD>   With a few seats still undecided, the Justice and Development
Party had 37 in the 325-member House of Representatives, Interior
Minister Driss Jettou said on Moroccan television. That more than
doubled the 14 seats previously held by the party.</LD>
<LD>   The socialists of Abderrahmane Youssoufi, prime minister in the
last legislature, were leading with 44 seats, Jettou said. The
conservative Istiqlal Party had 40. A center-right party won 37
seats.</LD>

Friday's elections, but none of them were expected to emerge with a

<HD>Japan Sends Team to North Korea to Confirm Abductees'
Identities</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>A Japanese fact-finding team seeking to confirm the identities of a
dozen people abducted by North Korea decades ago arrived in Pyongyang
on Saturday for a four-day visit.</LD>
<LD>   The government team flew to the North Korean capital from Beijing,
where the group had landed the day before, Foreign Ministry official
Kentaro Hatakeyama said.</LD>
<LD>   The team is expected to conduct DNA tests to confirm the
abductees' identities and interview the only four still alive to
determine whether they wish to return to Japan. The group also is
likely to request a meeting with those in Pyongyang who could provide
details about the abductees.</LD>
<TE>   Reversing decades of denial, North Korean leader Kim Jong Il
admitted in a summit with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi
this month that agents conducted repeated covert kidnap- pings of
Japanese. Pyongyang said it used the abductees to train spies in
Japan's language and culture.</TE>
<TE>   Kim's confession was welcomed as a sign of unusual openness from
the isolated Communist nation, but it also generated outrage in
Japan.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea has said that of the 12 Japanese abducted in the 1970s
and '80s, eight are confirmed dead.</TE>
<TE>   Families of the abductees have demanded that Pyongyang provide
more information and proof that the people it claims died were
actually their kin. The families of those said to be alive in the
North have refused a government proposal to visit them there, saying
the abductees should instead be returned to Japan within a month.</TE>
<TE>   Before leaving Tokyo, the team met with relatives of the abductees
to collect hair samples, photos and other information that might help
confirm identities.</TE>

<HD>Palestinians Mark 2nd Anniversary of Latest Uprising</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>GAZA CITY</DL>
<LD>Waving flags, banners and guns, tens of thousands of Palestinians
demonstrated Saturday to mark the second anniversary of their latest
uprising against Israel, even as two more died in clashes with
Israeli troops.</LD>
<LD>   Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat, under Israeli siege
in his West Bank headquarters for the 10th day, promised to continue
the struggle for a Palestinian state. Speaking by phone, his remarks
were relayed via loudspeakers to tens of thousands of marchers in
Gaza City.</LD>
<LD>   "We, the Palestinian people, care not about the siege, because we
are the stronger people!" he cried. "The people are with you, Abu
Ammar!" chanted the crowd, using the 73-year-old leader's nom de
guerre.</LD>
<TE>   The siege has shored up Arafat's slumping popularity and stalled
Palestinian reforms seen by Israel and the U.S. as crucial to
resuming peace diplomacy. But on Saturday, Israel showed signs that
it would bend to U.S. pressure and end the siege.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has sent a personal message to Israeli Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon urging him to drop the siege, said a U.S.
official who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon has sent an aide, Dov Weisglass, to Washington for talks on
how to resolve the impasse between the Israeli army and Arafat, whom
troops have trapped with 200 other Palestinians in his Ramallah
compound.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's government has said the siege, which followed Palestinian
suicide bombings that killed seven Israelis, would go on until the
surrender of 50 "wanted men" it says are in Arafat's quarters. The
Palestinian leader has refused to hand over anyone in the building.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers of the Gaza rally estimated that 50,000 people had
turned out. They added that they had asked militants not to bring
guns.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to reporters at the rally from his car while surrounded
by bodyguards, the founder of the radical Islamic group Hamas, Sheik
Ahmed Yassin, urged the intifada to continue.</TE>
<TE>   "Resistance is the only way to achieve our goals and recover our
rights," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Protesters in several West Bank communities, including Ramallah
and a refugee camp near Bethlehem, sent hundreds of balloons into the
sky.</TE>
<TE>   Children clutching candles gathered by night at Arafat's Jericho
office and heard the leader tell them by phone, "You are our future.
We are together until victory."</TE>
<TE>   Relatives said an unarmed 25-year-old Palestinian man was killed
by Israeli machine-gun fire early Saturday in the Gaza Strip. The
military said he had been shooting at troops.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors in Gaza City said a 19-year-old was shot and killed while
throwing stones.</TE>

<HD>Talk of an Iraq War Riles Britons</HD>
<DH>Rally: Thousands march through London protesting the Blair
and Bush administrations' steady press for a military solution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM WALLACE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Jeering President Bush and chanting "Not in our name!" tens of
thousands of antiwar protesters tramped through central London on
Saturday, massing in Hyde Park for a three-hour rally against what
they see as the British and American governments' enthusiasm for a
war with Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Aimed at stopping a conflict that has yet to start, the protest
was a preemptive strike of its own by a peace movement angered at
Prime Minister Tony Blair's support for the Bush administration
against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   Organizers said that more than 350,000 people--some shouting
"Shame!" as they passed Blair's 10 Downing St. residence--marched
from the demonstration's starting point near the Houses of
Parliament.</LD>
<TE>   London's Metropolitan Police estimates were lower, putting the
crowd at about 150,000. And the numbers were certainly boosted by the
fact that the rally was twinned with a demonstration calling for an
independent Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   But the marchers were the visible tip of deep public anxiety here
about a war, especially if London and Washington acted without the
backing of the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   Recent polls have shown that only one in five Britons would
support such an attack, although the number rises to 70% in favor if
a U.N. imprimatur was obtained.</TE>
<TE>   However, most of the speakers who addressed the crowd Saturday had
no doubt that a war against Iraq would be wrong under any
circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not about the defense of British interests. It's a war so
a bunch of corrupt American politicians can get their hands on Iraqi
oil," said London Mayor Ken Livingstone, a radical left-wing populist
whose style and personal clashes led to his expulsion from Blair's
Labor Party two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Livingstone's language was fully in keeping with the protest's
tone.</TE>
<TE>   Although there was no violence, a small but loud minority
occasionally screamed "Down, down, USA!" And a much larger portion
applauded wildly whenever Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was
denounced from the stage as a "bloody war criminal," which happened
frequently.</TE>
<TE>   Several speakers also mocked Blair for his "revolting love affair"
with Bush.</TE>
<TE>   The link was likely to have alarmed the prime minister's advisors,
who have tried to turn the public conversation here away from a focus
on the unpopular Bush and onto the merits of the case against
Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   But in Hyde Park on Saturday, the anger at the U.S. president and
the prime minister--whom one banner called "Bomber Bush, Bomber
Blair"--appeared synonymous.</TE>
<TE>   "They are twins of evil," said Yvonne Ridley, a British journalist
who gained fame here for being captured by the fundamentalist Taliban
when she sneaked into Afghanistan before last year's U.S.-led bombing
ousted the regime.</TE>
<TE>   Ridley, now a full-time peace campaigner, said Blair's support for
the American position makes him "a shallow, vain, self-serving
hypocrite--the 51st governor of the United States."</TE>
<TE>   The same charge of collusion was evident Saturday in Rome, where
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is under attack for supporting
Washington despite polls showing a majority of Italians oppose a war
in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Police in the Italian capital said more than 50,000 protesters
clustered in the city center, blowing whistles and waving antiwar
banners in a march organized by the Communist Refoundation Party.</TE>
<TE>   The British march also had a retro, 1970s left-wing tinge to it,
with copies of the Socialist Worker newspaper being hawked in the
crowd.</TE>
<TE>   The most vociferous personal attacks on Blair came during speeches
from trade union leaders, a group that feels betrayed by Blair's
abandonment of old socialist principles for the more electorally
satisfying center.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, one of the organizing groups of Saturday's rally was the
Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament--now a puny shadow of the once
powerful movement that, in the '70s, counted Blair and some of his
senior Cabinet ministers among its members.</TE>
<TE>   But the rally also showed the diversity among antiwar critics.</TE>
<TE>   There were members of the Christian clergy as well as thousands
from Britain's 1.8-million-strong Muslim community.</TE>
<TE>   And the biggest rumble of anticipation for any speaker greeted
American Scott Ritter, the former United Nations weapons inspector in
Iraq who is now a vocal critic of military intervention.</TE>
<TE>   Ritter dismissed the Blair government's recently released dossier
on Hussein's alleged arsenal of chemical, biological and nuclear
weapons as falling far short of a "case for war."</TE>
<TE>   He argued that "this document is not worth one drop of blood from
an American soldier, a British soldier or an Iraqi civilian."</TE>
<TE>   But Ritter also chastised those in the crowd shouting
anti-American abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "The American people can be your ally," he told them. "But we have
an alcoholic at the wheel of American foreign policy in George W.
Bush, and we need to reach in and grab the keys to the ignition away
from him."</TE>
<TE>   The comment drew loud applause.</TE>
<TE>   The former Marine also argued backstage with Ridley, who was
wearing a T-shirt featuring an American flag--with dollar signs and
swastikas in place of stars--and the slogan "Terrorist No. 1."</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't like it," Ritter said in an interview. "I wore that flag
on my sleeve in war, and I love my country. What I'm doing here is
about being a good American--about holding my country accountable to
its standards--and that's what I'm here to tell these people.</TE>
<TE>   "But this issue of war with Iraq is not going to be resolved in
London," he said quietly. "It's going to be resolved in the United
States, by Americans."</TE>

rally here by accepting a traditional Serbian welcome: a piece of

selling points in the Serbian presidential race. He is widely viewed
as a "true Serb."</LD>
<LD>   "Kostunica is trying to preserve the last crumb of dignity for
us," said Jelical Markovic, a 39-year-old single mother who attended
the rally in this city bombed by NATO during its 1999 campaign
against former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. "Those who are
in power now, their personal interest is all they care about."</LD>
<TE>   Two years after the ouster of Milosevic, who used nationalist
rhetoric to rally ethnic Serbs to the country's detriment, a deep
yearning remains for the confidence that nationalism offers: a sense
of identity in a world that for most Serbs is filled with
uncertainty.</TE>
<TE>   For most Serbs, the 1990s were a humiliation in which their
country, once viewed as the most progressive of the post-World War II
Communist states, was hobbled politically and economically by
Milosevic's rule. Now they believe that the international community
is making unreasonable demands and conditioning every dollar of aid
on the country's compliance with the International Criminal Tribunal
for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague.</TE>
<TE>   The result is an election campaign with a strong nationalist
backbeat. Of the 11 candidates on the ballot today, only two have
eschewed nationalist themes.</TE>
<TE>   Westerners have misunderstood the soul of Serbia, said James Lyon,
director of the Yugoslav office of the International Crisis Group, a
Brussels-based organization that monitors troubled countries.</TE>
<TE>   "The overthrow of Milosevic was not a liberal, democratic
revolution," Lyon said. "It was a nationalist revolution that brought
some democratic leaders to power, but the majority remains
traditional, conservative and very nationalist."</TE>
<TE>   Although no one believes that this election will take Serbia back
to a Milosevic-style government, the transition to a democratic
system and a market economy could move forward far more slowly than
over the last two years, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   "Both of the leading candidates worked to unseat Milosevic; both
are committed democrats. But they do have different programs," a
Western diplomat said.</TE>
<TE>   The two leading candidates are Kostunica and Miroljub Labus, a
former professor of Marxist economy who recruited a cadre of
expatriate Serbs to return to help build the country's economy when
Milosevic fell. Labus is generally viewed as the candidate who would
most aggressively push the economic reforms that would help the
country attract investment and create jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Kostunica now holds the job of Yugoslav president, but he is
running for the presidency of Yugoslavia's dominant republic, Serbia.
Although it might sound a bit like the president of the United States
running for governor of California, the Serbian post is actually more
powerful.</TE>
<TE>   When Kostunica defeated Milosevic for the Yugoslav presidency two
years ago, he was lauded for his dedication to the rule of law and
his background as a constitutional lawyer. He promised to support
economic and democratic reforms, but in fact he had little
responsibility for rebuilding the country's ruined economy. That was
the charge of the Serbian parliament led by Prime Minister Zoran
Djindjic, and it has proved a painful task.</TE>
<TE>   For roughly 45 years after World War II, Yugoslavia had a
state-run economy, although a more flexible one than that of other
Communist countries. In 1987, when Milosevic rose to power, he
drained its treasury by giving increasingly large subsidies for
essential goods such as electricity, vegetable oil, bread, milk and
sugar, and by waging a series of costly wars. He also allowed money
to be siphoned off by his mafia cronies.</TE>
<TE>   When Kostunica and Djindjic came to power two years ago, the
country was deeply in debt, many state-owned industries were in
disrepair and the NATO bombing had taken a toll on some of the
country's infrastructure. Since then, the public has faced repeated
sharp increases in the cost of essential goods, and wage increases
have been insufficient to keep up with them.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past two years, people have to sell their little weekend
houses, their cars, their homes even. A transition is OK, but not
this overnight transition," said Markovic, the single mother and
Kostunica supporter in Novi Sad, adding that she had traded in her
more expensive car for a cheaper one and given up going to cultural
events and movies to save money.</TE>
<TE>   At Labus' campaign appearance in Novi Sad, just one day after
Kostunica's, there was no bread, no salt, no brandy. Instead, a live
band played a mix of songs drawn from the many faces of Serbia: Gypsy
rhythms, the rock 'n' roll of Belgrade youths and the folk music of
the region.</TE>
<TE>   Labus has made a point of reaching out to minorities in his
campaign and has mostly distanced himself from the nationalist
rhetoric. But even he has made some concessions, occasionally
referring to his pride in being a Serb and changing his signature
from Latin script to Cyrillic, according to local media.</TE>
<TE>   His main political disadvantage is also the source of his
political advancement: his close association with Djindjic, who is
one of the most powerful, but also least liked, public figures in the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Djindjic, whose approval ratings are below 20%, is widely viewed
as being close to mafia figures and has been sharply criticized for
his recent decision to dismiss members of parliament who were not
supporting him.</TE>
<TE>   "Labus is seen as connected with Djindjic. He's not a powerful
person himself, so if he wins, Djindjic can eat him in five minutes,"
said Branko Pavlovic, a deputy in the Serbian parliament who once
supported Djindjic's coalition but has since become disillusioned.</TE>
<TE>   "For those of us who fought Milosevic and wanted a modern Serbia,
it is pretty much frustrating the way Djindjic has destroyed the
parliament," Pavlovic said.</TE>
<TE>   But it is a testament to Djindjic's influence that most people
talk as if the two leading contenders were Kostunica and Djindjic --
even though the latter's name will not be on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Labus appears to be holding his own. One recent poll
found that Labus, who has waged a Western-style campaign that targets
younger voters as well as ethnic minorities, would win support from
29% of voters while Kostunica would garner the votes of 27%.</TE>
<TE>   An ultranationalist candidate, Vojislav Seselj, ranked third, with
support from nearly 12% of voters.</TE>
<TE>   Other polls reverse the Kostunica-Labus numbers, but the two are
within a percentage point of each other.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it is unlikely -- although not impossible -- that Labus
will have enough votes to win outright under Serbian election law,
which requires the winner to receive a majority, or more than 50% of
the vote.</TE>
<TE>   And in a runoff, Kostunica is likely to pick up the votes of those
who voted for more strident nationalists in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   By the standards of the Milosevic era, Kostunica's brand of
nationalism seems like weak tea, but it doesn't take much for Serbs
to sense whether a political figure can make them proud.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Kostunica has not bowed as easily as Djindjic to the
request by the United States for the extradition of war crimes
suspects to the Hague tribunal, where Milosevic is on trial on war
crimes charges.</TE>
<TE>   And Kostunica insists that the ethnic Albanian-majority province
of Kosovo, now under United Nations control, will remain a part of
Serbia -- a critical point for many Serbs, because it is the
spiritual seat of the Serbian Orthodox Church.</TE>
<TE>   "When Kostunica says The Hague is biased against Serbs, everybody
likes that because they feel The Hague is biased and most of them
don't know any war criminals personally. So they feel Kostunica is
sharing their feelings," said Srdjan Bogosavljevic, who runs
Strategic Marketing and Media Research, a polling firm in Belgrade,
the Yugoslav and Serbian capital.</TE>
<TE>   But even Kostunica's "milder" nationalism can be provocative. This
month, he created a firestorm when he went to a border town near
Bosnia-Herzegovina and announced that the neighboring Bosnian Serb
republic was only "temporarily separated" from Serbia.</TE>
<TE>   Bosnians demanded a retraction of his comments, as did the
international community.</TE>
<TE>   Less than a decade ago, Bosnian Muslims and ethnic Croats fought a
bloody 3 1/2-year war to win independence from Yugoslavia. Bosnia,
although divided into a Serb republic and a federation that includes
Muslims and ethnic Croats, is now independent.</TE>
<TE>   Kostunica said that his remarks were misunderstood and that he
meant all of the former Yugoslav federation would one day be together
as part of the European community. But his words undoubtedly also did
the job of reassuring those who might have doubted his Serbian
fervor.</TE>
<TE>   For those voters eager to avoid alienating the international
community and who look forward to the day when Yugoslavia is more
like the rest of Europe, it felt like a throwback.</TE>
<TE>   "My hope for the future is that we in Novi Sad, in Serbia, live
better," said Svetlana Buncic, 40, an account manager and mother, who
said she would vote for Labus, saying he is "a fresh face."</TE>
<TE>   "I like that he wants us to join the European Union," she said,
"because I want us to go to work like the Italians, like the French,
with a smile on our face."</TE>

<HD>83 Manatee Deaths Most for State Since '99</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The death of a manatee brought the number of the endangered animals
killed by boats in the state this year to 83, the highest recorded in
Florida since 1999.</LD>
<LD>   The manatee died Thursday at Sea World, where it was taken after
being struck by a boat, said officials at the Florida Fish and
Wildlife Conservation Commission.</LD>
<LD>   "It's disappointing that state and federal government [officials]
haven't adequately addressed manatee threats," said Sandra Clinger, a
coordinator for the Save the Manatee Club.</LD>
<TE>   But Jim Kalvin, founder of the boating advocate group Standing
Watch, attributed the increase in deaths to the growing manatee
population. The state's annual aerial survey found 3,276 manatees in
2001, up from 2,639 in 1996.</TE>

<HD>Pentagon Battles Unknown Preparing for a Toxic War</HD>
<DH>Military: Despite gains since Gulf War, soldiers fighting
in Iraq could be exposed to many agents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FT. LEONARD WOOD, Mo.</DL>
<LD>Defense strategists have made sweeping advances since the 1991
Persian Gulf War to protect U.S. troops from chemical and biological
warfare: intensified training, improved gas masks, cooler and lighter
protective suits, and sensors to detect hazardous agents sooner and
from greater distances.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the science of defending against such weapons remains in its
infancy. As another war looms against Iraq--the only nation known to
deploy toxic agents since World War II--even the world's best-trained
and -equipped soldiers are vulnerable. The Pentagon has sought to
prepare for the worst by sending chemical specialists to the Chemical
Defense Training Facility at Ft. Leonard Wood, the only site where
actual toxins are used in military training. About 60,000 already
have trained at the facility, which expects 4,500 more from all four
branches of the armed services this year and 6,000 next year. They,
in turn, train their front-line colleagues.</LD>
<LD>   Some recent technological advances hold the prospect of saving
hundreds of soldiers' lives. For example, a specially equipped
vehicle that during the Gulf War could not identify chemical weapons
on contact without forcing soldiers out of its protective hull can
now spot a toxic cloud three miles off without stopping.</LD>
<TE>   But for biological weapons, that kind of advance detection remains
several years away. The best equipment available today can detect
biological agents only half an hour after exposure, though usually in
time to treat victims. Even that marks an improvement over 1991, when
biological weapons couldn't be detected at all.</TE>
<TE>   More worrisome, this equipment--a two-person lab mounted on a
Humvee--can identify only 10 biological agents. (Which 10 is
classified information, but likely includes those Iraq is thought to
possess--anthrax, botulinum, ricin and aflotoxin--as well as
often-mentioned threats such as plague and smallpox.)</TE>
<TE>   Novel biological agents could go undetected, killing or
incapacitating soldiers who might not show the effects for hours or
even days. Because existing devices search the air, they would not
detect if a man infected with smallpox--a kind of walking time
bomb--strolled past.</TE>
<TE>   "One of my biggest fears is that there will be something that is
totally unknown and unexpected," said Anna Johnson-Winegar, a former
United Nations weapons inspector in Iraq and now deputy assistant
secretary of Defense for chemical and biological defense.</TE>
<TE>   Lethal agents also could be modified to maximize their effect and
make them even harder to spot. VX, for example, could be turned into
a nearly undetectable "dusty VX" by impregnating the liquid toxin on
a particle of silicone or dust and making it airborne.</TE>
<TE>   "And that's not even going into the whole area of the genetically
engineered microorganisms," Johnson-Winegar said. "It's pretty easy
to make them antibiotic-resistant or put some type of a coating or
shell on them so that our detectors don't work." Knowing which
weapons Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has is tricky because of his
elaborate security measures and the fact that the technology used to
make these weapons can be as simple as a beer-fermenting vat. No
weapon inspectors have gone into Iraq since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   What does seem clear is that Hussein is more likely to resort to
chemical or biological weapons in a new U.S. attack--a point
emphasized by British Prime Minister Tony Blair when he presented a
British intelligence dossier against Hussein on Tuesday. During the
Gulf War, Hussein was deterred by the expectation that he could lose
the war and still retain power as long as he did nothing to provoke
an overwhelming response from coalition forces. (Some speculate that
Gulf War Syndrome, a malady among returning U.S. troops, was the
result of an unknown agent, although none has been found.)</TE>
<TE>   With President Bush insisting on ousting the Iraqi leader this
time, Hussein "will not hesitate to use these weapons," says former
Iraqi Gen. Najib Salhi, who defected in 1995. Although special
operations soldiers likely would be among the first on the ground in
an assault on Iraq, military strategists believe Hussein would
probably direct chemical and biological attacks at larger fixed
targets such as airfields and bases. "Port facilities [and] airfields
are always more lucrative to hit because there are more people
there," said Gen. Paul V. Hester, commander of Air Force Special
Operations Command at Hurlburt Field, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq has loaded toxic weapons on Scud missiles and, according to
U.S. intelligence officials, has equipped unmanned planes with crude
spraying devices, though it's not known whether these delivery
devices are effective. Even so, the vulnerability is extreme.</TE>
<TE>   In general, chemical weapons such as mustard gas and VX can kill
quickly over a limited area but lose their lethality over time and
distance. They can be detected in nanoseconds by the right equipment,
giving soldiers time to don protective gear.</TE>
<TE>   Sarin, the gas that cultists used to kill 12 and sicken 5,000 in a
Tokyo subway in 1995, is lethal in confined spaces but dissipates
quickly in the open air. VX can linger in liquid form for days or
even weeks, leaving a lethal contact hazard that diverts soldiers
from battle to cleanup.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were a bad guy, [VX] would be the chemical agent of choice
if I were to hit an airfield ... or a city or a state," said Maj.
Gen. John Doesburg, commander of the Soldier &amp; Biological Chemical
Command in Aberdeen, Md.</TE>
<TE>   Biological weapons are harder to detect and take days to show
their lethal effects. Anthrax is long-lasting and comparatively
simple to produce and deliver; it can be made by two people in a
crude lab for $2,000. Botulinum, by contrast, is harder to produce
and cannot survive long in heat or sunlight. Smallpox takes up to two
weeks to kill and can be passed from one person to another
unwittingly. "Soldiers will be concerned because you can't see it,
you can't touch it, you can't smell it--but you're told it's there,"
Doesburg said.</TE>
<TE>   Even basic industrial chemicals could pose a threat. The
Pentagon's current chemical detectors are not set up to identify
common hazardous chemicals such as chlorine gas, which the Germans
used in World War I.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about nightmare scenarios, one defense researcher said,
"Think Bhopal"--referring to a 1984 industrial accident in which a
toxic cloud of hydrogen cyanide spewed from a Union Carbide plant in
Bhopal, India, killing more than 2,000 people within hours. As many
as 20,000 later died from gas-related illnesses.</TE>
<TE>   The new technologies and improved equipment that the Pentagon has
brought out since the Gulf War include:</TE>
<TE>   * Chemical masks and suits: The armed services are replacing the
hot and heavy Battle Dress Overgarment--a charcoal suit with a
strap-on hood--with a sleeker, cooler one-piece suit.</TE>
<TE>   * Portable detection kits: M-256 kits have been distributed to
every unit. Soldiers would use them to identify nerve, blister and
blood agents such as hydrogen cyanide.</TE>
<TE>   * The Fox chemical detection vehicle: An amphibious armored car
introduced by the Germans during the Gulf War to detect nerve agents,
it now also detects blister agents, such as mustard gas, from three
miles away. U.S. forces have 113 of them, nearly double the total in
1991.</TE>
<TE>   * The Biologically Integrated Detection System: Created in 1996,
this Humvee-mounted lab alerts operators that one of 10 biological
agents has been found, but it can't identify which one; the findings
must be verified with a laboratory, a procedure that can take hours.
It also can detect a change in the size and number of particles in
the air--possibly because of a dust cloud or an unknown virus.
Operators also tote a new $60 hand-held device that can detect eight
biological agents on contact.</TE>
<TE>   * Decontamination systems: Cleaning an area struck by chemical or
biological weapons can take days, requiring soldiers to spray a toxic
decontaminant on exposed vehicles, buildings and equipment. Army
researchers are now testing a system similar to de-icing trucks used
at airfields. The GL1800 looks like an armored telephone truck, with
a carriage that can lift an operator 42 feet to spray contaminated
equipment from a safe distance. The new system uses an experimental
nontoxic decontaminant. Among the first soldiers likely to face the
prospect of toxic weapons in combat are from the 101st Airborne
Division at Ft. Campbell, Ky.</TE>
<TE>   The 101st underwent accelerated chemical training before going to
Afghanistan and its troops now ponder the daunting prospect of
chemical warfare in Iraq. Several soldiers fresh from Afghanistan
said they're paid to take what comes.</TE>
<TE>   If Hussein used chemical or biological weapons, "he'd be an
idiot," said Staff Sgt. John Hughes, a 38-year-old licensed practical
nurse who returned from a seven-month stint in Afghanistan in
mid-July. "I don't think it'd be a problem. It's something that the
infantry trains on all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Added Chief Warrant Officer Edward Anthony Greer, 38, a Black Hawk
helicopter pilot from a tough area of Gary, Ind., who also returned
from Afghanistan in July, "I'm from Gary. I learned to dodge at an
early age."</TE>

<HD>Mayor Going Against the Grain in the Big Easy</HD>
<DH>Crackdown: C. Ray Nagin's anti-corruption crusade is a
public relations coup, but not everyone's on board.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>They are calling from all over town to lay their laurels at the
mayor's feet. "I'm behind you 100%," gushes the first caller. "Thank
you for stepping up to the plate," the next one says reverently.
Mayor C. Ray Nagin nods, bald pate gleaming under the studio lights
of WWL 870 AM. "Thank you," they say, one after the next.</LD>
<LD>   Ever since Nagin swept from obscurity to celebrity in last
winter's elections, he has been the toast of his hometown. He's a
natural showman who, with fiery rhetoric and dramatic flourish,
rolled into office and set about systematically scrubbing graft from
city bureaucracy. The former cable TV executive has vowed to shake
the antiquated government into shape and lure big business back to
the foundering Big Easy.</LD>
<LD>   "This city is just on fire," radio host David Tyree exclaims. "An
earthquake, I don't know what."</LD>
<TE>   Flush with promises to stop the laissez faire palm greasing of
prior administrations, Nagin seems too good to be true--and some
skeptics say he has yet to follow through.</TE>
<TE>   In New Orleans government, a dynastic dinosaur traditionally run
by career civil servants, Nagin is a rarity. As a self-made
businessman and political outsider, "He was invisible," University of
New Orleans political scientist Susan Howell said. "Nobody knew who
he was."</TE>
<TE>   He was born in Charity Hospital, grew up in the scrappy streets of
this city's working-class neighborhoods and went to Alabama's
Tuskegee University on a scholarship. In last year's campaign, Nagin
talked up an anti-corruption platform that attracted white and
middle-class black voters alike.</TE>
<TE>   After his spring inauguration, it didn't take long for the
commotion to begin. On a dank morning in late July, police stole
through the streets before sunrise, banged on doors and rounded up
the first of more than 80 suspects in Nagin's much-touted crackdown.</TE>
<TE>   The sting came off in tidy choreography. That morning's newspaper
carried the story in awkward verb tense: "In predawn raids, police
this morning were scheduled to fan out across New Orleans to arrest
city bureaucrats, brake-tag inspectors and illegally licensed cab
drivers ... an opening salvo by the Nagin administration in what
bodes to be the biggest crackdown on municipal corruption in the
modern history of this city." The Times-Picayune was fed the story in
advance; Nagin is nothing if not publicity-smart.</TE>
<TE>   Later that morning, Utilities Director Lilliam Regan arrived at
her City Hall office to find the door locked. Before the watchful
lenses of a bank of television cameras, Regan was fired. Then Brian
Cain, head of the Taxicab Bureau, was marched out of City Hall in
handcuffs. A few days later, Regan was arrested on charges of
malfeasance in office.</TE>
<TE>   The battle cry rang unmistakably. In news conferences, Nagin
called it a fight for the heart and soul of New Orleans, the
existential struggle of a town mired in poverty and old-time graft.</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans has long been regarded as an anachronistic banana
republic where the only way to do business--be it a vehicle
inspection, a construction contract or a garbage collection--is to
pay a bribe or call in a favor. Whether or not the city lives up to
its crooked reputation, conventional wisdom holds that its image
alone is enough to drive away business.</TE>
<TE>   Nagin has tapped into a prevailing fear that New Orleans is
choking on its own mystique. The population of fewer than 500,000 is
dwindling, grown children are forced to find jobs elsewhere and city
workers are disgruntled and underpaid, critics point out. In his
exuberant speeches, Nagin summoned the phantoms of bills slipped over
countertops and wads of cash pressed into waiting palms.</TE>
<TE>   "It was political theater," scoffed Martin E. Regan Jr., Lilliam
Regan's husband and lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever it was, it worked: Eager whistle-blowers jammed the phone
lines at the Metropolitan Crime Commission, dumping more than 1,000
tips into the laps of investigators. When Nagin swaggers through a
downtown shopping mall, voters crowd around him like children
swarming Santa Claus. They shake his hand--and offer to slip him
documents that detail some scrap of bygone graft. They have been
waiting for years, they tell him.</TE>
<TE>   "Corruption had gone on in the open for so long that there was
really a feeling of hopelessness," said Rafael Goyeneche, president
of the crime commission. "There was a sense that it was so embedded
in the culture of the community, there was no way to change it."</TE>
<TE>   But as the dramatic summer cooled down, skeptics began to ask
what, exactly, had been accomplished. Aside from Regan, the net had
rounded up a motley collection of cabbies, vehicle inspection agents
and low-level bureaucrats. They were charged with small-time
crookery: extorting cash from drivers whose cars wouldn't have passed
inspection, or pocketing a payoff in exchange for a taxi permit.
"There was a sense that, God, all we're doing is catching little
fish," said John Maginnis, a political commentator in Baton Rouge.</TE>
<TE>   If doubts festered in the early days, Regan's inglorious court
appearance brought them boiling to the surface. Two weeks after
Regan's arrest, Magistrate Judge Gerard Hansen ruled that the city
didn't have any evidence that she did anything wrong. It turned out
Regan had waived $50 fees for a handful of taxi drivers, including a
medical hardship case for a driver whose leg was amputated. "I'd
probably act in the same way," Hansen said.</TE>
<TE>   There were other uncomfortable points about the former utility
chief. For one thing, Regan insists it was her investigation that
brought to light alleged corruption among her underlings. Her
supporters say she was a watchful guardian of city money, a hawkish
regulator who scrutinized audits of Entergy New Orleans Inc., the
city's electricity provider, and drove a pending lawsuit to recover
money she believed the company owed the city for years of "gross
over-billings."</TE>
<TE>   Although the legal case against Regan crumbled, Nagin made it
clear that she is unlikely to be invited back to his administration.</TE>
<TE>   Of the skeptics, perhaps none is so miffed as Marc H. Morial,
Nagin's predecessor in the mayoral office.</TE>
<TE>   The politically entrenched son of New Orleans' first black mayor,
Morial makes for an experienced critic. He too spent his first days
in office attacking corruption. That was in 1994, when the New
Orleans Police Department was considered one of the country's
dirtiest. Morial's sweeping purge went down as the crowning
achievement of his administration and still stands as a blueprint for
police reform.</TE>
<TE>   In the headiest days of this summer's arrests and intrigue, Nagin
hinted that complicity in the graft eventually would be traced all
the way to the top of the former administration. "I was offended,"
Morial said. "I'm a tough guy and a big boy, but I don't think you
throw names around and imply illegalities unless you've got
evidence." As the days passed, Nagin grew quieter. Asked a few weeks
ago whether he expected Morial to be implicated, the mayor gave an
unequivocal "no."</TE>
<TE>   "Nagin has made a big splash," Morial said. "But there's a
witch-hunt mentality prevailing."</TE>
<TE>   Nagin says his phones have been tapped since he began his crusade.</TE>
<TE>   He says somebody pulled the fire alarm at City Hall one day, then
hacked into the e-mail account of his chief technical officer. He
says a stranger sidled up to his father at a beer joint and warned
that somebody in the Nagin family could get hurt. "It's a little
unnerving," he said, shrugging. "But it's just intimidation."</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, federal investigators appear to have folded
Nagin's work into their two-year probe of City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Appearing with Nagin at his side, U.S. Atty. Jim Letten told New
Orleans reporters that more city employees are likely to be charged
with federal crimes in coming months. In late August, a city engineer
was charged with extorting $20,000 from an electrical contractor.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Nagin's rhetoric has come down a few pegs. Instead of
talking about New Orleans' soul, he is casting about for an endgame.</TE>
<TE>   The probe is taking up too much time, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "How do we exit from this? Is there a graceful way?" he asked.
"How do we get back to the business of running a city?"</TE>
<TE>   It remains to be seen what changes come next, or how they'll go
over in a town whose appetite for reform has just been whetted.</TE>
<TE>   "The next question is, 'Is this real?' In order to be credible, it
has to go to the higher levels," said Howell, the political
scientist. "It will be worse if he stops now than if he had never
started."</TE>

<HD>Juvenile Home to Close Amid Allegations of Staff Abuses</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MORGANTOWN, Pa.</DL>
<LD>A juvenile detention center set up under an ambitious plan to treat
the state's worst youth offenders will close because of abuse
allegations against staffers, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The state Department of Public Welfare on Friday said it had
determined that between July 2001 and April of this year there were
14 sexual assaults--most committed by employees--on inmates at New
Morgan Academy.</LD>
<LD>   A provisional six-month license was issued to the private facility
in February as the department investigated the allegations. It
decided not to renew the license, which expires Wednesday, department
spokesman Jason Pagni said.</LD>
<TE>   It was not clear whether any employees will face criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   New Morgan Academy was established in 2000 with the aim of
"treating troubled youth with dignity and respect."</TE>
<TE>   But the facility's operator, Cornell Companies Inc., admitted that
it failed in its ambition of combining juvenile justice with mental
health care.</TE>
<TE>   "We have had a series of people who not only failed to abide by
[company] policy but failed to abide by state law and common
decency," said company spokesman Paul Doucette.</TE>
<TE>   Doucette said that in the most recent case of abuse, four
employees roughed up a 15-year-old boy to teach him a lesson. The
four were suspended and will be fired, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The facility will close next month after the company decides with
the state and county where to transfer the inmates.</TE>
<TE>   Cornell is the nation's third-largest private correctional firm,
with about 75 facilities around the nation and 30 in Pennsylvania.</TE>

<HD>Giuliani Defines 'Leadership' For New Era</HD>
<DH>Politics: His new book talks tough about the war on
terrorism, but the ex-mayor is happy in this stage of his life and
might remarry soon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>He had visited the smoldering World Trade Center 30 times in the last
36 hours and was in a state of shock. Rudy Giuliani badly needed
sleep, but when President Bush flew to New York three days after the
terrorist attacks and asked what he could do for him, the mayor
crisply answered: "If you catch this guy, Bin Laden, I would like to
be the one to execute him."</LD>
<LD>   More than a year later, Giuliani remains emphatic. "I still mean
it," he said in his office 24 stories above Times Square. "I think
I'm the logical person to do it, as a representative" of all New
Yorkers.</LD>
<LD>   During eight years at City Hall, the Big Apple knew Giuliani as a
mayor firmly in control, a tough politician who never minced words
and thrived on confrontation. That image has been softened somewhat
in the former mayor's just-published "Leadership," a 400-page guide
for political and private leaders based on his life in politics and
as a former U.S. attorney.</LD>
<TE>   He's looking more relaxed, his prostate cancer is under control
and Giuliani says "there's a good chance, a really good chance" that
he and girlfriend Judith Nathan may soon make a wedding announcement.
Nowadays, he runs an international consulting firm specializing in
corporate security, makes speeches at $100,000 each and is happily
embarked on a new life.</TE>
<TE>   But the old Rudy still shines through: In an interview Friday, he
said he expects to reenter politics and refused to rule out runs for
the presidency, the U.S. Senate or New York governor. He no longer
entertains plans to seek his old post, however, because his mayoral
successor, media mogul Michael R. Bloomberg, is doing "a very good
job."</TE>
<TE>   "I've learned that you don't cut off options, and I have no idea
of what the future will bring," the former mayor said, acknowledging
the political buzz that has him either poised to step in for Vice
President Dick Cheney if needed in 2004, or running against U.S. Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton in either a New York senatorial or U.S.
presidential contest down the road.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now I'm in the private phase of my life, [but] I think I'll
want to go back to government again. Maybe it will be appointed
office," he said with a wry smile, fueling already rampant
speculation that Giuliani might be a candidate for the proposed post
of Homeland Security czar.</TE>
<TE>   Wherever he goes, people ask Giuliani about America's readiness to
combat terrorism, and he has a tough message for them: At a time when
millions may be lapsing into complacency, Giuliani said the nation
should brace itself for suicide bombings. They are easier to pull off
than the highly coordinated Sept. 11 attacks, he noted, and
preventing them in big cities is difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because [bombings] passed us by in the first wave doesn't
mean we can dismiss them in the second," Giuliani noted. "And New
York is in many ways easier to patrol than Los Angeles. L.A. is a
very big, sprawling place, with numerous downtown areas. You have to
do the best you can."</TE>
<TE>   In the hours after the Sept. 11 attacks, Giuliani said he and his
staff wrestled with one question more than any other: Would the
terrorists strike again at New York City, or stage another attack
somewhere else, to show their versatility and keep American security
forces off balance?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," he said with a frown, looking over Times Square,
"but as a former prosecutor I was taught to put myself into the head
of my enemy. And I became certain that they [Al Qaeda terrorists] are
going to wait awhile, and then they're going to do something that's
not anticipated."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the strain and trauma he went through after the terrorist
attacks, Giuliani insists that he has not fundamentally changed as a
person. But the circumstances of his life have been radically
altered. On the morning of the World Trade Center disaster, he was a
lame-duck official who was undergoing a messy divorce. Within days,
he was suddenly transformed into "America's mayor," a politician who
led New York through an emotionally wrenching period and became
Time's Man of the Year.</TE>
<TE>   Looking to the future, he said Americans will need a higher level
of leadership, given the twin legacies of the terrorist attacks and
burgeoning corporate scandals. Political and business leaders, he
noted, should be putting a much greater premium on candor.</TE>
<TE>   "What people expect now is direct communication [from leaders], as
opposed to the scripted, spun and orchestrated interventions that
take place," he said. "One thing that happens if you're not scripted
is that you make more mistakes. But then people can be more realistic
about leaders. They don't have to pretend to be perfect, and I think
that's going to be equally true of a president, a mayor, a governor
or a corporate CEO."</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani's book is full of tough talk about the battles he fought.
It tells the story of a Republican law-and-order candidate who
unseated David Dinkins, a Democratic, African American mayor, in a
town where Democrats outnumber Republicans 4 to 1. Giuliani was
elected without the support of some of the city's most powerful
political groups, including labor unions, and this gave him a free
hand to enact sweeping reforms at City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   New York led all big cities with a stunning 70% drop in major
crimes during his administration, and the welfare rolls also were
slashed. "Leadership" offers a vivid guide to how Giuliani made this
happen.</TE>
<TE>   But some may be surprised--astonished, even--by his omissions.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor, a die-hard Yankee fan, makes numerous references to his
favorite team, all intended to illustrate lessons about leadership.
He also imparts some practical "wisdom" for would-be leaders in
scenes from "The Godfather" and takes credit for a host of political
triumphs.</TE>
<TE>   But there is not one mention of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed West
African peddler who was killed in a hail of 41 police bullets while
Giuliani was in office. That case brought racial tensions in New York
to a boiling point.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is there a reference to Abner Louima, a Haitian immigrant who
was brutalized in a Brooklyn police precinct, and whose case set off
a citywide furor over police brutality. In a book that recounts the
high points of his administration and the crises he faced, the mayor
doesn't note that many in the black community were infuriated by his
policing policies.</TE>
<TE>   A gracious, thoughtful man in private, Giuliani could often be
rude and unforgiving with his opponents in public.</TE>
<TE>   At one point in the book, he describes his smashing 1997
reelection victory, but fails to mention the name of his Democratic
foe, New York City Council President Ruth Messinger, referring to her
only as "my Jewish, female opponent."</TE>
<TE>   None of this will surprise longtime Giuliani friends. The former
mayor has long insisted that his anti-crime policies benefited
minority communities more than any other segment of New York, and
that politics is a rough business.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't possibly be mayor of New York for eight years and not
have things you wish you would get to do again or do over again,"
Giuliani said, shrugging off the past. "But you don't get that
chance."</TE>

<HD>Interior Dept. Revives Plan for Mine on California Indian
Site</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Defying the Senate and the California Legislature, the Interior
Department has removed a key hurdle for development of the proposed
open-pit Glamis gold mine in an isolated, rocky section of desert in
eastern Imperial County.</LD>
<LD>   The action came just days after the Senate adopted an amendment
written by Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) that attempted to thwart the
mine by prohibiting the use of federal funds to examine the mine's
potential or prepare a permit for it.</LD>
<LD>   Former Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt tried to kill the project
in January 2001, arguing that it would irreparably damage cultural
and religious sites sacred to the Quechan Indian Tribe.</LD>
<TE>   But Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton gave the project new life,
and the department ruled Friday that claims to develop the mine are
valid. The decision was made after mineral experts determined that
economic conditions and the site's ore stores will support a
profitable mine.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Quechan Tribe were angered that the agency
announced the finding without consulting them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a complete slap in the face to the tribe, the California
Legislature and the U.S. Senate," said Courtney Coyle, an attorney
for the tribe.</TE>
<TE>   "The destruction of this sacred area would violate the Interior
Department's obligations to protect the interests of federally
recognized Native American tribes, with tragic consequences," Boxer
said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   While the ruling moves Reno-based Glamis Gold Ltd. one step closer
to excavating a 1,571-acre mine on Bureau of Land Management property
about 45 miles northeast of El Centro, Calif., it does not authorize
it to begin production.</TE>
<TE>   The next step is a three-month review of a study prepared under
Babbitt's tenure of the likely environmental effects of the project.
The agency then decides whether to approve or reject the mine or to
seek more information on its environmental impact.</TE>
<TE>   Norton revived the Glamis project last year after her chief lawyer
ruled that the Clinton administration had misinterpreted the law in
rejecting the mine. Friday's ruling was the first major action toward
reconsidering the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Boxer had attempted to prevent the Bush administration from going
forward on Glamis, which is unpopular with the tribe and other area
residents, by offering an amendment to the Interior Department
spending bill. Her amendment was approved by voice vote last week
with the support of Senate Republicans. But it is unclear whether the
House would endorse her amendment.</TE>
<TE>   The California Assembly recently passed a bill aimed at protecting
sites that are valuable to Indian tribes from mining and other
damaging activities.</TE>
<TE>   Glamis said the agency's finding is important because it will back
up its effort to be compensated if the state or the federal
government rejects the mine.</TE>
<TE>   "What this decision of the BLM does is confirm that we have a
compensable interest," said Chuck Jeannes, a senior vice president of
the company, on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Boxer criticized the Bush administration for giving the mining
company such a valuable document and said its action was the latest
of several to favor the mining industry at the expense of
environmental and cultural treasures.</TE>
<TE>   She noted that Norton and several other top Interior officials
have worked extensively for mining interests in private business.</TE>
<TE>   "This mine would rip the heart out of the tribe's religious
center," Boxer said. "There can be no justification for this
decision."</TE>

<HD>Protests Go Smoothly as Debt Relief Plan Deliberated</HD>
<DH>Summit: IMF reiterates $1-billion pledge. Policymakers
propose bankruptcy court to ease pitfalls of governments going into
default.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH, RANDY TRICK and EDDY RAMIREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>As protesters denounced the global economic regime, world leaders
agreed Saturday to pursue new ways of resolving financial crises,
including a groundbreaking bankruptcy court process for insolvent
governments.</LD>
<LD>   Members of the International Monetary Fund's policy-making panel
also promised to make good on an earlier pledge to contribute another
$1 billion for Third World debt relief.</LD>
<LD>   The actions came during the first day of official deliberations by
members of the IMF and World Bank. The sister institutions, which
lend money to nations in distress and finance development programs in
poor countries, will conclude their fall meetings today.</LD>
<TE>   "What we're seeing is a new compact between developing and
developed countries, effectively a new deal for the world economy,"
said British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown. "The developed
world will meet its commitments."</TE>
<TE>   Much to their dismay, the elite financial institutions have come
to symbolize a wide range of grievances about the global economy, and
previous meetings have drawn thousands of protesters to Washington.
IMF and World Bank leaders sought Saturday to emphasize their
achievements, as well as their ongoing efforts to improve the
sometimes chaotic system of global finance.</TE>
<TE>   They said their new crisis-response initiative would reduce the
likelihood that future debt defaults would cause as much damage as
the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s or the more recent
collapse of Argentina's economy.</TE>
<TE>   "The lack of any predictable process for resolving debt crises
exacerbates the depth and duration of the difficulties," said U.S.
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill. "We must explore every possible
option to improve the current system."</TE>
<TE>   The policy committee directed the IMF staff to develop by April a
"concrete proposal" for establishing an internationally recognized
legal process for restructuring the debts of governments in default.</TE>
<TE>   It also endorsed efforts to include "collective action" clauses in
future government bond issues to prevent one or two holdouts from
blocking a debt restructuring plan approved by a majority of
creditors.</TE>
<TE>   The objective of both proposals is to resolve future debt crises
quickly and before they threaten to destabilize large regions.
Without such procedures, governments tend to delay inevitable
defaults as long as possible, and a single creditor can go to court
and tie up debt restructuring efforts for years.</TE>
<TE>   The additional $1 billion for debt relief will be used to cover
the IMF and World Bank's share of the Heavily Indebted Poor Country
Initiative, which has approved up to $37 billion in debt relief for
34 countries.</TE>
<TE>   But the new deal falls far short of what many debt-relief
advocates say is needed to let impoverished countries spend their
money on social programs to relieve suffering rather than paying back
lenders.</TE>
<TE>   Wealthy nation finance ministers rejected proposals endorsed by
nongovernment organizations such as Jubilee 2000 to increase HIPC
debt relief by as much as $150 billion.</TE>
<TE>   While finance officials huddled over their new initiatives, a
diverse collection of anti-globalization activists rallied for an
entirely different vision of global justice.</TE>
<TE>   Lofting placards and chanting slogans, demonstrators called on the
IMF and World Bank to open their meetings to the public, forgive
billions of dollars in debt, withhold support for projects that
degrade the environment and ban policies that impose economic
hardships on local residents.</TE>
<TE>   By unofficial estimates, at least 5,000 protesters were on the
streets Saturday afternoon. But their goal of surrounding the IMF and
World Bank headquarters was thwarted by a force of about 3,000
riot-clad police from Washington and other communities, as far away
as Ohio and Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the interactions between protesters and law enforcement
contrasted sharply with those on Friday, when police arrested 649
anti-globalization activists, including self-proclaimed anarchists
accused of vandalism. By early Saturday evening, police said they
arrested four protesters for allegedly carrying explosive devices
nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps because the march was orderly and police had succeeded in
thoroughly shutting down a large area of downtown surrounding IMF
headquarters, near the end of the day officers relaxed some of their
restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   They allowed a group of a few hundred protesters to proceed to a
small park a few blocks from IMF headquarters, where they ended the
march with a rally. And when about 40 activists bound themselves
together with duct tape and lay down in the middle of an
intersection, police--who had already blocked off the street--decided
to wait them out rather than arrest them.</TE>
<TE>   The demonstrators had begun with a rally near the Washington
Monument that featured singing, dancing and drum-beating that lent a
festival flavor to a clear autumn day.</TE>
<TE>   Marie Clarke, national coordinator for the debt-cancellation group
Jubilee USA Network, said poor nations should be allowed to spend
their money on AIDS patients instead of debt service to world lending
agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Nader, the consumer crusader and Green Party presidential
candidate in 2000, said he feared that Congress would abandon its
drive for tougher corporate crime laws amid the debate over war with
Iraq. He denounced high chief executive salaries and the looting of
corporate treasuries as the biggest "fit of greed and self-enrichment
that the world has ever seen."</TE>
<TE>   Colorful props have become a staple of the anti-globalization
protests, and Saturday's demonstrations were no exception.</TE>
<TE>   A 20-foot inflatable pig was labeled "Hog-tied corporate glutton."
An inflatable shark had a globe in its mouth and the sign: "IMF
equals Loan Shark." A large, rolling Trojan horse was marked: "World
Bank Aid."</TE>
<TE>   A dozen activists donned business suits and oversized papier-mache
heads and hands stained with red paint.</TE>
<TE>   "These are businessmen, butchers, with blood on their hands," said
Eddie Haynes, 34, of the Vermont-based Bread and Puppet Theater. "So
few people have so much power over so many, and it's killing people
who don't have an ability to protect themselves," he said.</TE>
<TE>   An environmentalist contingent took exception to financial
policies that activists said encourage the exploitation of energy and
mineral resources in poor countries.</TE>
<TE>   "Because they pollute, they lower the standards of living, which
hurts the goal of poverty elimination," said Nick Salter, 17, from
Denver.</TE>
<TE>   As they marched, the protesters chanted "More world, less bank,"
and carried signs saying, "Drop the debt." As their route took them
past Department of Treasury headquarters, many booed.</TE>

<HD>In Governors' Races, This Might Be Year of the Woman</HD>
<DH>Politics: Their number, now five, could double. The office
is a path to the White House.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Ten years after women stormed into Congress in unprecedented numbers,
female candidates across the country are climbing toward another
possible milestone this fall: a record haul of governorships.</LD>
<LD>   Female candidates nominated by major political parties are
competitive in states from coast to coast--and beyond. Hawaii voters
are certain on Nov. 5 to elect their first female governor, either
Republican Linda Lingle or Democrat Mazie Hirono.</LD>
<LD>   Depending on the outcomes of several other races that are too
close to call, the elections could roughly double the ranks of women
who are state chief executives. There now are five.</LD>
<TE>   The rise of women in state politics has national implications.
With more women serving as governors, more will be considered
potential presidential or vice presidential candidates.</TE>
<TE>   In recent times, the path to the White House has run through the
statehouse. Four of the last five presidents, including the current
President Bush, were governors.</TE>
<TE>   This year's gubernatorial races are critical to "building a
pipeline to the presidency," said Marie Wilson, head of the White
House Project, a group that promotes women for national office.</TE>
<TE>   Even if none of the current female governors or gubernatorial
candidates lands on a national ticket, they are laying the groundwork
for another to become president or vice president.</TE>
<TE>   "It shows women breaking through to a new level in American
politics--being seen as a chief executive, being a final voice in
decision-making," said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for
American Women and Politics at Rutgers University in New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past, women have been seen as legislators--and that was a
big breakthrough. But to be the last, the final authority, the 'buck
stops here,' that is significant. It really breaks down those
stereotypes."</TE>
<TE>   The nation's first female governor was Nellie Tayloe Ross of
Wyoming, who won a special election in 1924 to succeed her husband.</TE>
<TE>   In 1974, Ella Grasso of Connecticut made history as the first
female governor who was not a widow or wife of a former governor. And
in the 1990s, two notable governors were Ann Richards of Texas and
Christie Whitman of New Jersey, now administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, 19 women have served as governors, including one who held
office in Ohio for a mere 12 days. In 33 states, a woman has never
been chief executive. That includes California, where female
Democratic nominees twice failed in the 1990s to win the
governorship.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, 206 women have served in Congress, including 13 now
in the Senate and 60 in the House. A decade ago, in what became known
in politics as the Year of the Woman, female candidates made huge
gains on Capitol Hill, raising their ranks in Congress by more than
50%.</TE>
<TE>   Now they are trying to pull off a similar feat at the highest
state level. But unlike the 1992 campaigns, which followed the
explosive Anita Hill--Clarence Thomas hearings, gender is not a major
issue this year in most states.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, what is notable about the current field is how many of
the candidates have held lower statewide offices. Most of the 10
women nominated by major parties for governor are attorneys general,
lieutenant governors, state treasurers or the like. One is a state
party chairwoman. Another ran credibly for governor twice before as a
Democratic nominee.</TE>
<TE>   "They're all serious heavy hitters in their own states," said John
Kohut, an analyst for the Cook Political Report. "That's an
indication of how times have changed."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the contests have focused less on personalities than on
issues such as budgets, schools, roads, health care--or, as Kohut
said, "Who's got a plan to fix what."</TE>
<TE>   In Arizona, where women hold four top statewide offices, Atty.
Gen. Janet Napolitano, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, said she
encounters almost no questions concerning her gender. The national
media calls occasionally, she said, but local reporters "just don't
ask about it."</TE>
<TE>   Napolitano is in a tight race with Republican Matt Salmon, a
former congressman. As an attorney general and former U.S. attorney,
she has an edge many female gubernatorial candidates have lacked: a
hefty law-enforcement resume.</TE>
<TE>   Her solid anti-crime credentials have freed Napolitano to mine for
votes by talking up other issues: the economy, the budget, schools
and what she calls a "Plan for Arizona Women." The plan is a
compendium of positions on domestic violence, women's health and
education concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Napolitano still faces a tough road to victory. Arizona, generally
a conservative state, has not had a Democratic governor since Bruce
Babbitt left office in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   If she wins, Napolitano would become the first woman elected to
succeed a female governor. Republican Jane Dee Hull is ineligible to
run for reelection because of term limits.</TE>
<TE>   In Massachusetts, another woman is trying to set the same
precedent of succeeding a female governor. But Democrat Shannon
O'Brien, vying to succeed acting Gov. Jane Swift, a Republican, is in
a completely different campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Gender has been an inescapable, even dominating, theme in
Massachusetts politics almost from the moment Swift was elevated from
lieutenant governor in early 2001 to fill a vacancy.</TE>
<TE>   Plagued by questions about her handling of various personal family
matters, including an incident involving a child-care emergency,
Swift saw her standing plummet rapidly.</TE>
<TE>   Businessman Mitt Romney elbowed her aside for the Republican
nomination, an extraordinary fall for any incumbent but especially
noteworthy in this instance because of the impressions left by a man
taking a woman's place.</TE>
<TE>   Romney, seeking to minimize potential damage, chose a woman to be
his running mate and has made a point on the campaign trail of noting
women who support him.</TE>
<TE>   O'Brien, the state treasurer, defeated three men Sept. 17 for the
Democratic nomination.</TE>
<TE>   Against that backdrop, the issue of gender now has moved to the
forefront in Massachusetts' general election. Romney, in a radio
interview last week, likened O'Brien's experience to that of Swift's
and urged voters to back his candidacy for a change in the
statehouse.</TE>
<TE>   O'Brien fired back, accusing Romney of making a comment with
sexist overtones. "I think it's dangerously close to implying that
all girls are alike," the Democrat said.</TE>
<TE>   How the volatile gender issue will play out in Massachusetts
remains uncertain. Recent polls show a close race.</TE>
<TE>   Another attention-grabbing candidate is Jennifer Granholm, the
Democratic gubernatorial nominee in Michigan. Like O'Brien, she
defeated prominent male candidates in her party's primary.</TE>
<TE>   As state attorney general, Granholm has developed a reputation as
a dynamic politician who can wow a crowd.</TE>
<TE>   She is favored to defeat the Republican nominee, Lt. Gov. Dick
Posthumus, which would return the statehouse to the Democrats for the
first time in 12 years.</TE>
<TE>   If she wins, Granholm would be the first woman to govern her state
and, given the key role Michigan usually plays in presidential
elections, instantly become a national figure.</TE>
<TE>   However, as a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Canada, she would
be ineligible under the Constitution to run for president.</TE>
<TE>   A major factor in how many women win governorships Nov. 5 will be
whether national trends shift predominantly in favor of either party.
With the exception of Hawaii's Lingle, all of the female
gubernatorial hopefuls are Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   A GOP sweep on election night would mean a decrease in the number
of female governors. That's because three of the current five are
leaving office: Swift, Hull and Gov. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.). Those
continuing in office are Govs. Judy Martz (R-Mont.) and Ruth Ann
Minner (D-Del.).</TE>
<TE>   A Democratic sweep, on the other hand, would result in 11 female
governors.</TE>
<TE>   Both all-or-nothing scenarios are highly unlikely. Analysts figure
the parties will split the close races, leaving women in charge of
seven or eight states. Anything more than five would be a record.</TE>
<TE>   "One or two or three seats is a huge gain," said Wilson, of the
White House Project. "You will give people more and more experience
with seeing [women] lead at an important level."</TE>

<HD>Southeast Assesses Damage as Isidore Wanes; Mississippi to
Seek Disaster Aid</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JACKSON, Miss.</DL>
<LD>Tropical Storm Isidore appeared to be nothing more than a messy
rainstorm when it swept into Biloxi--certainly nothing like the
hurricane that hit Mexico days earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Casinos on Gulf of Mexico beaches had been ordered closed, but
evacuations were only recommended. When Col. Danny Pepper briefed
about 20 National Guard troops late Wednesday, it looked as though
the briefing wasn't needed.</LD>
<LD>   But 90 minutes later, the evacuation was made mandatory. Isidore
had just brought an 8 1/2-foot storm surge--3 to 5 feet higher than
was forecast.</LD>
<TE>   Three feet of water stood in homes as guardsmen knocked on doors
and waded through chest-deep water in east Biloxi.</TE>
<TE>   The events early Thursday in Biloxi highlighted the fine line
between necessary precaution and undue disruption in calling an
evacuation.</TE>
<TE>   The storm gouged a 12-foot hole in the Treasure Bay casino in
Biloxi, severed its moorings and sent a 25-foot section of its
docking ramp 100 yards down the beach.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Ronnie Musgrove said he didn't view the Harrison County
evacuation as coming too late, given that it had been recommended
earlier. Neighboring Hancock County had issued a mandatory evacuation
order Wednesday morning.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been talking for a long time about heeding the evacuation
notices, and by and large that was done in a very effective manner,"
Musgrove said. "For the areas that were not, the National Guard
assisted us tremendously in making that evacuation possible."</TE>
<TE>   Across Mississippi, about 4,400 homes or apartments were damaged,
according to preliminary estimates. At least three deaths in
Mississippi and Tennessee were blamed on the storm.</TE>
<TE>   With mops, brooms and wheelbarrows, residents along the Gulf Coast
were cleaning up Saturday in homes and yards flooded by the storm
surge and as much as a foot of rain that fell Wednesday and Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think the water would get this high. It just kept coming
and coming and coming," said Susan Serpas, whose front yard in
Delacroix, La., was under 4 feet of water.</TE>
<TE>   Most areas hit by Isidore were drying out Saturday as the storm
broke apart over the Northeast. Flooded rivers and creeks in the
Midwest remained high, but water levels were expected to drop over
the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   In Florida's Escambia County, which includes Pensacola, 103 homes
were flooded, but the damage was relatively minor, said Michael
Hardin, the county's emergency management chief.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has declared about a dozen counties in Louisiana
disaster areas, and Musgrove planned to request federal aid for
Mississippi.</TE>

<HD>U.S., State Jurists Tangle in Next Phase of Sleeping-Lawyer
Saga</HD>
<DH>Law: A federal judge orders Texan to explain why the
attorney who won the defendant a retrial will not be appointed to
defend him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The retrial of an accused murderer in Texas whose first lawyer slept
through testimony has precipitated an unprecedented face-off between
a federal judge and a state judge who refuses to reappoint the
appellate lawyer who won the defendant a second chance at justice.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge David Hitt- ner has ordered Texas District
Judge Joan Huffman in Houston to explain why she won't appoint Robert
McGlasson to represent Calvin J. Burdine, who received the death
sentence in 1984 for the stabbing death of his roommate.</LD>
<LD>   In a separate order, Hittner directed Huffman to participate in
court-supervised mediation to resolve the situation.</LD>
<TE>   If no agreement is reached, Huffman has been ordered to come to
court and explain why Hittner should not appoint McGlasson himself.</TE>
<TE>   Experts on federal-state judicial relations and the death penalty
said they were unaware of any instance where a federal judge had
taken such action.</TE>
<TE>   USC constitutional law professor Erwin Chemerinsky said it was
"outrageous" for Huffman to refuse to appoint McGlasson. However,
Chemerinsky also said he was unaware of any instance where a federal
judge had attempted to compel a state court judge to appoint a
particular lawyer in a murder case.</TE>
<TE>   "This is extraordinary," said Chemerinsky, who suggested that the
case may become a test of how much power a federal judge has to
effectuate earlier rulings.</TE>
<TE>   Hittner, appointed to the federal bench in 1986, ordered a new
trial for Burdine in 1999, saying his constitutional rights had been
violated when his trial lawyer, Joe Frank Cannon, slept through
significant portions of his murder trial. That decision was upheld by
a federal appeals court. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to review it
in June, paving the way for a retrial.</TE>
<TE>   In the current clash, Hittner acted on Sept. 19 in response to a
lawsuit filed two days earlier by the American Civil Liberties Union
branch in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   The ACLU contends that Huffman's refusal to appoint McGlasson, who
has represented Burdine for 15 years, is a violation of Burdine's 6th
Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel. The ACLU also
alleged that Huffman violated Burdine's right to a fair trial by
pushing the retrial forward very rapidly--originally scheduling it
for Oct. 7.</TE>
<TE>   ACLU attorney Annette Lamoreaux agrees that Hittner's order
against Huffman is "very unusual." But she maintains that Hittner has
the authority to ensure that his original decision is carried out.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it reflects the seriousness with which Judge Hittner
views this case," Lamoreaux said. " ... I hope that Judge Huffman
will do the right thing and agree to appoint Mr. McGlasson.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason one doesn't find any cases where a federal judge gets
involved in circumstances like these is because they haven't had to,"
Lamoreaux said. She maintains that Huffman's refusal to appoint
McGlasson is illegally disrupting the ongoing attorney-client
relationship between the two men.</TE>
<TE>   Burdine, 49, has said he wants McGlasson to stay on the case.</TE>
<TE>   Although indigent defendants have the right to court-appointed
counsel, as a general rule, they do not have the right to a lawyer of
their own choosing.</TE>
<TE>   However, there are several instances where state appeals courts
have ordered a reluctant trial judge to appoint the same lawyer who
won a retrial for a convicted murderer.</TE>
<TE>   That did not happen in this instance, though. After Huffman
initially refused to appoint McGlasson, the Texas Criminal Defense
Lawyers Assn. asked the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals to order
Huffman to appoint McGlasson.</TE>
<TE>   The appeals court summarily denied the motion.</TE>
<TE>   "One shouldn't have to go to a federal court, but on occasions
like this when a state judge doesn't seem to understand that the
United States Constitution applies to them, then I think a federal
judge is the best person to acquaint them with that fact," Lamoreaux
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Texas attorney general's office, which is representing
Huffman, conceded in court papers that Hittner has jurisdiction.</TE>
<TE>   Just hours after Hittner ordered Huffman to come to his court,
Huffman pushed Burdine's trial back five months until March 3. But
she did not change her position on the issue of appointing McGlasson.</TE>
<TE>   Huffman refused to appoint McGlasson three months ago. She said
McGlasson was not eligible to represent indigent clients, such as
Burdine, because he is not on a recently created list of lawyers
qualified to handle capital cases in Harris County. The list was
assembled under rules promulgated under the state's new Fair Defense
Act.</TE>
<TE>   Huffman said that, even though McGlasson was entitled to continue
representing Burdine, she would not permit him to be paid with state
funds. "I intend to follow the rules, as I believe I'm required to
do," Huffman said at a June 26 hearing.</TE>
<TE>   McGlasson, who heads the death penalty appeals unit in the federal
public defenders' office in Atlanta, is a member of the Texas bar and
once ran a death penalty project in the state. He has said he is
willing to take a leave from his job to handle Burdine's new trial,
but he needs a court appointment so he can be paid for the work.</TE>
<TE>   Huffman, who was a district attorney in Houston for 14 years
before becoming a judge in 1998, has been criticized by numerous
Texas attorneys, including sponsors of the Fair Defense Act. Her
critics contend that she distorted the act's purpose by refusing to
appoint McGlasson, who has a long-standing relationship with Burdine,
is a death penalty specialist and could handle the case more
efficiently because he is so familiar with the record and the issues.</TE>
<TE>   The Houston Chronicle has blasted Huffman in editorials, including
one Sept. 20 that said she "seems indifferent to fairness.... No
state law prohibits Huffman from giving Burdine a fair trial. Duty
and the Constitution compel her to give him a fair trial, at least
the second time around."</TE>
<TE>   Huffman declined to comment. Her court coordinator referred calls
to the Texas attorney general's office.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Atty. Gen. Daniel E. Maeso contends in court papers that
Huffman is immune from suit because of her office. Maeso also
contends that Burdine is not entitled to the attorney of his choice
and, more specifically, is not entitled to have McGlasson as his
lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the attorney general's office has issued no response to
Hittner's order for Huffman to participate in mediation starting in
early October, under the supervision of a retired Texas state appeals
court judge.</TE>

<HD>Convict Is Targeted in Levy Inquiry</HD>
<DH>Crime: The suspect is in prison for assaulting two other
women near where the ex-federal intern's body was found. Police see
other similarities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Detectives in the Chandra Levy murder case are focusing on a man
convicted of assaulting two women jogging in Rock Creek Park last
year--though the suspect was initially discounted after he passed a
polygraph test that investigators now believe was flawed.</LD>
<LD>   Ingmar Guandique, 21, has been in prison for the assaults on the
joggers since July 2001, two months after the Modesto woman
disappeared. After her remains were found in the park May 22, some
investigators reexamining his case were struck by the similarities in
the three crime scenes, law enforcement sources said.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators then discovered that a Spanish-speaking interpreter
instead of a bilingual technician was used in administering
Guandique's polygraph, sources said. Relying on an interpreter,
according to legal experts, can skew the results of the test because
the questions are filtered through and possibly altered by the
interpreter.</LD>
<TE>   The clothes Guandique was wearing when he was arrested July 1,
2001, were sent to the FBI laboratory in Washington for DNA tests,
according to law enforcement sources. He wore the same dark,
knee-length baggy shorts during both attacks for which he was
convicted, according to reports from police.</TE>
<TE>   Guandique, a Salvadoran immigrant, has become the focus of the
Levy probe because the attacks on the joggers occurred not far from
where her body was found and because of the violent nature of the
assaults, according to law enforcement sources.</TE>
<TE>   In a pre-sentencing memorandum, Assistant U.S. Atty. Kristina
Ament called Guandique "a predator" who, armed with a knife, used the
isolated portions of the park "as a hunting ground, waiting beside
popular running trails, selecting victims and stalking them."</TE>
<TE>   Levy's skeletal remains were discovered a little more than a year
after she vanished, in an isolated pocket of the park about half a
mile from where Guandique attacked one jogger and less than two miles
from where he attacked another.</TE>
<TE>   There is no evidence linking Guandique or anyone else to the
17-month-old case. A team of District of Columbia police, FBI agents
and prosecutors from the U.S. attorney's office is conducting the
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   D.C. Police Chief Charles Ramsey cautioned that investigators
don't know whether Guandique was involved but said, "He's someone
we're interested in."</TE>
<TE>   In May, authorities played down Guandique as a suspect because
Levy had been killed before his attacks on the joggers--who fought
back and escaped without serious injury. They theorized that someone
who already had killed would have been more violent with the later
victims. The interest in Guandique has shifted attention from Rep.
Gary A. Condit (D-Ceres), who was romantically involved with the
24-year-old former federal intern when she disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators have not interviewed him since Levy's remains were
found, though Ramsey said, "We have not excluded anyone."</TE>

<HD>TV Ad Seeking to Buff Up Israel's Image to Air in L.A.</HD>
<DH>Media: The 30-second spot, to run on cable news channels,
shows the nation as a modern democracy. Palestinian Americans have
denounced it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHANNA NEUMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Skyscrapers appear in the background, computers crowd desks, Muslim
women cast votes at a polling place and a voice-over intones, "Israel
is America's only real ally in the Middle East ... shared values,
shared visions for peace."</LD>
<LD>   A partnership of Jewish organizations in New York and the Silicon
Valley has launched a new $1-million television advertising campaign
on cable news channels, appearing in the Los Angeles market beginning
Monday. Alarmed by polls showing that Israel's image has been
tarnished by heavy media coverage of its conflict with Palestinians,
the groups designed a 30-second ad that portrays Israel as a modern
democracy that prizes free speech, scientific advances and religious
freedom.</LD>
<LD>   "The news coverage is factually accurate but misses the truth,"
said Jennifer Laszlo Mizrahi, a consultant who, along with several
other pollsters in Washington, produced the ads. "People were
starting to think about the Mideast in terms of moral equivalence"
between Israel and the Palestinians.</LD>
<TE>   The Washington consultants--Democrats Mizrahi and Stanley
Greenberg, pollster to the Clinton White House along with Republicans
Frank Luntz, a pollster, and Neil Newhouse from Public Opinion
Strategies--found in a study of American public opinion that support
for Israel had slipped from a record high of 60% after the Sept. 11
attacks to 42% in July, while support for Palestinians also fell,
from 10% to 8%. Concerned about the falloff, they went looking for
partners. The American Jewish Committee in New York, and Israel21c in
Cupertino, a nonprofit group started by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs,
soon signed on, and the ad campaign was born.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian Americans have assailed the ad, which started airing
in Washington a few weeks ago, as racist. "It's an old theme, which
has long been used to describe the Arab-Israeli conflict,'' said
James Zogby, founder and president of the Arab American Institute, a
think tank in Washington. "Though subtle, it is racist, because, at
its core, the message it projects to Americans is that, 'We are like
you, [the Arabs] are not.' "</TE>
<TE>   Zogby also questioned the ad's rosy portrayal of Israel as a
democracy, when in fact Arab Israelis are denied social benefits.
"They have a right to vote, but they are essentially voiceless,
third-class citizens," said Zogby.</TE>
<TE>   Replied Larry Weinberg, executive vice president of Israel21c: "We
depicted Israel as a vibrant, vital democracy, not a perfect one."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the merits of the campaign's themes, the ads open a new
chapter of advocacy in television advertisements, particularly in
foreign policy. Advocacy groups have long used newspaper advertising
to promote their causes. And they have often used television
campaigns to influence domestic policy in Washington--none more
effectively than the "Harry and Louise" spots that helped torpedo the
Clinton health-care initiative.</TE>
<TE>   But this is the first time American Jewish groups have taken to
the television airwaves to promote Israel, and they predict it will
encourage others to join the debate.</TE>
<TE>   "The Jewish community stayed away from television out of fear it
would reinforce the old invalid stereotype of Jews controlling the
media," said Weinberg of Israel21c. "We were depriving ourselves of
one of the most effective communication tools in history so as not to
inflame the stereotype."</TE>
<TE>   Luntz, whose polls showed that Americans were beginning to see
Israel as undemocratic, called the ads "the first attempt I know of
to reach the American electorate. If this ad attracts attention,
you'll see more of this, particularly in issues of international
security."</TE>
<TE>   Like Weinberg, Mizrahi sees the campaign as the political
coming-out of the Jewish community. "In the era after Joe Lieberman
[Connecticut Democratic senator and the first Jew nominated for vice
president], Jews are comfortable enough that they can say what they
believe in on television, not just quietly in the opinion section of
the New York Times," she said. "Now they can shout it from the
rooftops of CNN."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, CNN turned down the groups' request for air time,
arguing that it does not accept advocacy ads on international issues
about regions in conflict. It recently turned down an ad from Saudi
Arabia, timed to air on the anniversary of Sept. 11, expressing
sympathy with Americans during the commemoration. "If you're going to
cover the region as closely as we do, it is not appropriate to accept
advocacy ads," said CNN spokesman Matthew Furman. "We did not accept
them either from the United Arab Emirates, Egypt or Saudi Arabia."</TE>
<TE>   To David Harris, executive director of the American Jewish
Committee in New York that is co-sponsoring the ads, the turndown was
striking in light of charges from some Jewish groups that CNN has a
pro-Palestinian tilt in its news coverage. "To us, it was an
outrageous decision," said Harris. "An ad about democracy gets turned
down when it comes from an American group."</TE>
<TE>   But Israel21c was able to place the ads anyway, through local
affiliates. They are scheduled to run in all the places news junkies
go--Fox, MSNBC, CNBC, CNN and Headline News--in 100 major markets, as
if they had been placed nationally. Then, if deemed a success,
backers hope to run a second ad chronicling Israel's support for
peace initiatives back to 1947.</TE>
<TE>   "So far, the e-mails have been supportive," Weinberg said. "They
come from evangelical Christians, from Jews, from all over the world,
thanking us for taking this step."</TE>

<HD>Museum Offers Insight Into King Assassination</HD>
<DH>Civil rights: Memphis, Tenn., center's expansion allows
patrons to look at evidence in '68 slaying.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MEMPHIS, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>Congressional reports, Justice Department documents and the rifle
used to assassinate the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. opened to public
review Saturday at the National Civil Rights Museum.</LD>
<LD>   The detailed multimedia exhibit includes evidence that would have
been presented in court against King's confessed killer James Earl
Ray, had the case gone to trial. But the museum also covers
conspiracy theories of King's death and acknowledges some questions
still are unanswered.</LD>
<LD>   "I didn't know there was so much evidence collected," said
Christine Deener, who attended the opening of an $11-million
expansion of the museum.</LD>
<TE>   The museum has been housed for over a decade at the Lorraine
Motel, and visitors could look into King's room and peer out on the
balcony where he fell mortally wounded on April 4, 1968.</TE>
<TE>   The expansion includes the former rooming house from which the
rifle shot was fired--giving visitors a view from the killer's
perspective to the Lorraine balcony.</TE>
<TE>   The .30-06 hunting rifle found outside the rooming house is
included, as are personal items Ray left in the room rented under an
assumed name.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit also covers Ray's many unsuccessful attempts to take
back his guilty plea. The plea in 1969 removed the possibility of a
death sentence. Ray drew 99 years in prison and died there of liver
disease in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Many museum visitors, even those such as Deener who are convinced
of Ray's guilt, left the exhibit wondering if he was part of a
conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll never know," said Bettye Williams of Springfield, Ill. "He
didn't do it alone, but I don't know to what degree others were
involved."</TE>
<TE>   The museum tells the story of America's struggle for civil rights
since the days of slavery. The expansion allows that history lesson
to continue from King's slaying to the present.</TE>
<TE>   Benjamin Hooks, the museum's chairman and a former director of the
National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, said the
expansion shows that much progress toward equal rights has been made
since the 1960s, though more work needs to be done.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a day of victory and triumph," Hooks said. "We celebrate
those who have gone without so we might move forward. We stand upon
their shoulders."</TE>

<HD>Tough-on-Crime Cases Top Supreme Court Fall Session</HD>
<DH>Law: Megan's Laws, three-strikes decisions are to be
decided. Nothing arising from the war on terrorism is on the
justices' agenda.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court, which opens its new term next week, will take up
constitutional challenges this fall to two popular tough-on-crime
measures of the 1990s: Megan's Laws, which alert the public to sex
offenders who were released from prison, and three-strikes laws,
which can keep three-time felony offenders in prison for life.</LD>
<LD>   Judges in California, Connecticut and Alaska have ruled that these
laws sometimes go too far.</LD>
<LD>   They say Megan's Laws brand as dangerous all former offenders,
even if their crimes were long in the past. And in California,
shoplifting can be the third strike that sends a two-time offender to
prison for life.</LD>
<TE>   The high court will also decide whether states can force drug
makers to discount the price of prescription drugs. With the debate
about how to temper soaring drug costs stalled in Congress, lawyers
for the pharmaceutical industry and the Bush administration are
urging the court to void Maine's discount-drugs law.</TE>
<TE>   And in a case that has attracted wide interest in the
entertainment industry, the court will decide the fate of a 1998 law
that extended copyrights for films, books, songs and plays that were
released in the 1920s and 1930s.</TE>
<TE>   These are among the 41 cases set for arguments this fall, with the
first to be heard Oct. 7.</TE>
<TE>   However, the fall term truly gets underway this week, when the
nine justices meet behind closed doors for the annual ritual of
sifting through the nearly 2,000 appeals that arrived over the
summer.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who hates to take time even
for discussion or debate, will ask fellow justices to vote on a list
of appeals that, in his view, raise a significant and disputed legal
question. It takes at least four votes to grant an appeal. And as
early as Tuesday, the court is expected to announce cases that will
be taken up in the coming months.</TE>
<TE>   So far, there are no cases arising directly from the war on
terrorism. The first will be coming soon, however.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department says it will appeal a ruling that opens the
immigration hearings for those picked up during the FBI's
anti-terrorism probe. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft ordered all such
hearings closed to the public and media. But in August, a U.S.
appeals court sided with Detroit newspapers and ruled that the
Constitution's guarantee of freedom of the press forbids secret
hearings.</TE>
<TE>   Terrorism may also cast a shadow over several current cases.</TE>
<TE>   For example, a case from Oxnard tests whether a police officer can
try to force a confession out of man who has been shot and is near
death.</TE>
<TE>   In November 1997, Sgt. Ben Chavez rode in the ambulance that
carried Oliverio Martinez to an emergency room after he had been shot
six times in a struggle with two officers. Police were looking for a
suspected drug dealer in a park when they spotted Martinez on his
bicycle and stopped him. Chavez repeatedly tried to get a statement
from Martinez that would exonerate his fellow officers. Doctors and
nurses insisted Chavez leave the emergency room, but he persisted.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez, although paralyzed, survived and sued Chavez and the
Oxnard police. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals cleared the suit
to go before a Los Angeles jury, ruling that "coercive interrogation"
by police is unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. Solicitor General Theodore B. Olson and Assistant Atty.
Gen. Michael Chertoff, two leaders of the Bush administration's legal
war on terrorism, filed a brief on behalf of the Oxnard police. They
urged the high court to rule that the Constitution allows "coercive
questioning" by police and federal agents, as long as any forced
admissions are not used against the suspect in court.</TE>
<TE>   Pressuring Suspects</TE>
<TE>   In the war on terrorism, information about Al Qaeda operatives is
more important than possible testimony in a criminal trial. Ashcroft
wants federal agents to be free to hold witnesses and suspects and
pressure them to talk. He hopes these detainees can tip off agents to
other plotters and their plans.</TE>
<TE>   If the Supreme Court upholds a constitutional "right to be free of
coercive questioning," Olson said in a court brief, it "will
undermine legitimate ... efforts to obtain potentially life-saving
information during emergencies."</TE>
<TE>   Olson concedes that the police and federal agents cannot torture a
witness or use brutal methods that "shock the conscience." But
pressuring a dying man to talk is not "so outrageous" as to be deemed
unconstitutional, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The war on terrorism may also affect the outcome in a pending
deportation case.</TE>
<TE>   Congress in 1996 said that immigrants who commit crimes in the
United States must be deported. The government also insists they
remain jailed until their deportations.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, however, the 9th Circuit Court said this mandatory
detention rule is extreme, unfair and unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   Olson urges the Supreme Court to reverse that decision and to rule
that deportable immigrants can be jailed without a hearing. If the
high court agrees, most legal challenges to last year's roundup of
1,200 immigrants in the terrorism probe would be swept aside.</TE>
<TE>   The Megan's Law and three-strikes cases come before the court in
November. Both laws arose from horrible crimes involving children.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, 12-year-old Polly Klaas was abducted from her home in
Petaluma, Calif., and killed by Richard Allen Davis, a
twice-convicted kidnapper on parole.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, Megan Kanka, a 7-year-old New Jersey girl, was
abducted and killed by a paroled sex criminal who lived nearby. Her
parents knew nothing of their neighbor's criminal history.</TE>
<TE>   Now, all 50 states require released sex criminals to register with
local authorities and supply them with a photo and a current address.
Thirty states, including Alaska and Connecticut, make this
information available to the public on a state Web site. In
California, the registry can be viewed at police stations, and
communities are alerted when high-risk offenders have moved into the
area.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say that ex-offenders who have served their time and are
not dangerous should not be labeled as a threat to the community.</TE>
<TE>   "People have lost their homes and their jobs" after being listed
on the state's Web site for past sex crimes, said Darryl Thompson, an
Anchorage lawyer for two men who are contesting the registration
requirement. "Even the spouses and their girlfriends are hurt by it."</TE>
<TE>   State officials say they are simply giving the public accurate
information about a criminal conviction.</TE>
<TE>   "If my kid is going to another neighborhood, I check the site,"
said Cynthia Cooper, a state lawyer who is defending Alaska's law.</TE>
<TE>   In a Connecticut case, the court will decide whether ex-offenders
are entitled to a hearing to determine whether they are still
dangerous. In the Alaska case, the court will decide whether Megan's
Law can be applied to ex-offenders whose crimes occurred before the
law was enacted.</TE>
<TE>   California's three-strikes law is harsher than others because a
petty theft can trigger a life sentence if it is a criminal's third
offense. More than 7,000 criminals have been sentenced under the law.
Of these, 311 were sentenced for a petty theft.</TE>
<TE>   The high court will consider two of those cases. Leandro Andrade,
a 37-year-old heroin addict, was sentenced to 50 years in prison for
a third strike of shoplifting videotapes from two Kmart stores in San
Bernardino County. Gary Ewing got a sentence of 25 years to life
after he limped out of an El Segundo golf shop with three Callaway
clubs tucked into his pants leg.</TE>
<TE>   Sentence Overturned</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit overturned Andrade's sentence as "grossly
disproportionate" to his crime. State prosecutors say Andrade and
Ewing had long records of thefts or burglaries that justify locking
them up for life.</TE>
<TE>   The prescription drug case will be heard in December.</TE>
<TE>   Maine's law says that drug makers must offer the state's residents
the same discounts that are offered to low-income people enrolled in
Medicaid.</TE>
<TE>   If Maine wins, dozens of states are expected to copy the law. Last
week, the Bush administration urged the court to void it on the
grounds that it hijacks the Medicaid program to aid people who are
not poor.</TE>
<TE>   In the next few months, the court also is likely to take up cases
on college affirmative action, campaign finance reform, sex Web sites
on library computers and gay rights.</TE>
<TE>   A conservative law firm is urging the court to take up a
University of Michigan law school case and to rule that colleges may
not use a student's race as an admission factor.</TE>
<TE>   The court's conservative and liberal factions have been evenly
split on this issue.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department is also urging the court to revive a law
that requires public libraries to install filters on computers to
screen out sexually oriented Web sites. A lower court said this
violates freedom of speech.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, gay rights lawyers are challenging a Texas law that is
one of the few remaining laws making it a crime for gays or lesbians
to have sex in their own homes.</TE>
<TE>   The Lambda Legal Defense Fund is appealing on behalf of two men
who were arrested at home and prosecuted.</TE>
<TE>   Before voting on whether to take up the issue, the court asked
Texas lawyers last week to submit a brief defending the law.</TE>
<TE>   A challenge to the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law also is
destined to reach the high court. First, however, a three-judge panel
in Washington will consider whether the limits on so-called soft
money--unrestricted campaign donations--and negative campaign ads
within 60 days of the election violate the 1st Amendment.</TE>

<HD>Voters Get Chance to Take 'Tax' Out of 'Taxachusetts'</HD>
<DH>Ballot: Initiative would repeal the state's levy on income.
It isn't expected to pass, but foes warn if it does it will devastate
government and schools.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>A ballot initiative that has received scant public notice could
permit voters here to enact a revolution Nov. 5, banning state income
taxes in the commonwealth once known as "Taxachusetts."</LD>
<LD>   Supporters, who hail mainly from the state's small Libertarian
Party, say the measure would wrest spending power from profligate
bureaucrats and place budget control where it belongs: in the hands
of the people. Detractors, including the entire state Legislature,
say that passing the bill would paralyze state government by
stripping Beacon Hill of its primary funding source.</LD>
<LD>   Even by the standards of tax rebellion, the bill is so bold that
few expect it to pass. But its mere presence on the ballot signals a
triumph for the Libertarian Party, which has long espoused an
anti-tax philosophy in Massachusetts and which collected about 13,000
signatures to place the proposal before voters. The initiative's
existence also reflects a creeping cantankerousness among some
segments of the always unpredictable Yankee electorate.</LD>
<TE>   Gubernatorial candidates Shannon O'Brien, the Democratic state
treasurer, and venture capitalist Mitt Romney, the GOP
standard-bearer, made no mention of the proposal last week in a
fierce debate. But Carla Howell, the Libertarian candidate, has made
ending state income tax the centerpiece of her campaign and "the
focus of my life, absolutely."</TE>
<TE>   Stressing the potential effect of the initiative in a state that
annually derives $9 billion--40% of its operating budget--from state
income taxes, Howell said: "There probably is not a voter alive who
has had the opportunity to vote on something like this."</TE>
<TE>   Her most outspoken foe is Michael J. Widmer, the president of a
nonprofit, nonpartisan group called the Massachusetts Taxpayers
Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   He agreed that the ballot question is "far and away the most
sweeping tax cut proposal ever to reach this state's ballot--and
perhaps the most sweeping proposal of its kind in any state."</TE>
<TE>   The bill is so revolutionary, Widmer added, that "it would repeal
the 20th century."</TE>
<TE>   In particular, Widmer charges that the measure would destroy the
state's public education. Howell counters that abolishing state
income taxes would "dramatically benefit schools in Massachusetts" by
ending involvement from state legislators.</TE>
<TE>   Just as important, according to Howell, banning state income taxes
would force Massachusetts to reexamine what she considers runaway
state spending.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to take a close look at what we are already spending $23
billion on," she said, referring to the state's annual budget. "This
is the only plan that will work."</TE>
<TE>   In a contentious state Legislature that normally cannot even agree
on the weather, not one Beacon Hill lawmaker has endorsed the
measure, which one state senator said would turn Massachusetts into
"the Idaho of the East Coast." The Legislature would have the power
to overturn the measure if it passes.</TE>
<TE>   Herman B. "Dutch" Leonard, a professor of public management at
Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government and a student of tax
revolts, said the measure "is not the kind of policy proposal that
serious people take seriously--and maybe that's the problem."</TE>
<TE>   Although a late-summer poll showed 37% of voters supporting the
initiative, Leonard called the proposed income tax ban "a sleeper"
that has generated little attention. But with voter turnouts
averaging less than 30%, the bill could entice cranky citizens sick
of wondering what the state does with the money extracted from their
shriveling paychecks, Leonard said.</TE>
<TE>   States typically derive most of their revenue from sales and
income taxes. Through counties and other jurisdictions, they also
receive funds from property taxes. In the nine states that do not
have personal income taxes, sales taxes tend to be higher than the
national average. Because sales taxes are paid in small, steady
doses, they generally meet little opposition--even in regions where
the rate is 10% or higher.</TE>
<TE>   As shown by California's passage of Proposition 13 in 1978,
"property taxes tend to produce the most resistance," Leonard said.
But income taxes also raise citizen ire, Leonard said, "because you
file an annual return that shows exactly what you paid--and you
wonder, what did I get for all that?"</TE>
<TE>   Libertarian Howell, a 25-year veteran of private-sector work in
management and engineering, made such disgruntlement the rallying cry
of an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate. As a candidate for
governor, she blasts the "arrogance" of a government that assumes it
knows best how to spend citizens' money. She especially targets fat
in state education budgets, such as "solid oak paneling being used
[in schools] when pine would do just fine."</TE>
<TE>   After studying free-market economics, Howell concluded that
"government central planning destroyed the Soviet economy, and the
same principle applies here. Government spending is destroying
schools in Massachusetts."</TE>
<TE>   The very simplicity of Howell's proposal is why Widmer, for one,
fears that some citizens may embrace it.</TE>
<TE>   "The electorate is in a sour mood because of everything that is
happening in the world--Sept. 11, the economy, corporate greed, the
stock market," Widmer said. "When people are unhappy, they often want
to send a message."</TE>
<TE>   The rocky history of high tariffs produced the moniker
"Taxachusetts," an insult hurled at then-Gov. Michael S. Dukakis by
George Bush when both were running for president in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Massachusetts has phased in a series of income tax
reductions that have pushed it out of the ranks of the highest-taxing
states, at least by some measurements.</TE>
<TE>   But personal income taxes have been a fundamental revenue source
for more than half a century, and eliminating those funds would carry
enormous consequences, Widmer said. Sales taxes would skyrocket, and
property taxes also would have to climb, he added.</TE>
<TE>   The current 5% state sales tax exempts food and clothing, placing
Massachusetts in the bottom tier nationally.</TE>
<TE>   Public schools might have to close, Widmer predicted, because most
major cities rely on state aid for as much as 80% of their school
budgets.</TE>
<TE>   All public programs would be at risk, he warned, from courts to
prisons, public safety to prescription drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly what would happen is that it would usher in a lengthy
period of fiscal and political crisis, with all the impact of
both--plummeting bond rating and economic harm," Widmer said.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be hard to fathom that large a shift in the state tax or
expenditure structure in any short time period," said Leonard, the
tax historian. "At best, it would be incredibly disruptive."</TE>
<TE>   Stressing that he was not predicting that the bill would pass, he
added: "Maybe people are in denial about this possibility, about what
it would actually mean."</TE>
<TE>   If passed, the bill would take effect Jan. 1.</TE>

<HD>Angels Do Spot Check</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Rodriguez has a place on playoff roster, but
Cook, Sele left out after 8-4 win over Seattle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For a bright-eyed 20-year-old who has never seen the neon lights of
the Big Apple, it is a chance to shine in a spotlight he can't even
imagine. For a hardened 39-year-old, it might be lights out.</LD>
<LD>   There was elation and disappointment in the Angel clubhouse at
Edison Field on Saturday and it had nothing to do with their 8-4
victory over the Seattle Mariners in front of a sellout crowd of
43,202.</LD>
<LD>   The reactions came after the Angels unveiled their 25-man roster
for the division playoff series against the New York Yankees that
begins Tuesday night at Yankee Stadium. Teams can make further roster
adjustments if they qualify for the next round.</LD>
<TE>   Included on the roster announced Saturday is 20-year-old September
call-up Francisco Rodriguez, the right-handed reliever who tied Nolan
Ryan's franchise record by striking out eight consecutive batters.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez will join fellow relievers Troy Percival, Scott
Schoeneweis, Scot Shields, Brendan Donnelly and Ben Weber, and
starters Jarrod Washburn, Kevin Appier, Ramon Ortiz and John Lackey
on the first-round roster.</TE>
<TE>   The everyday players will be starters David Eckstein, Darin
Erstad, Tim Salmon, Garret Anderson, Brad Fullmer, Scott Spiezio,
Troy Glaus, Bengie Molina and Adam Kennedy, and reserves Orlando
Palmeiro, Shawn Wooten, Benji Gil, Jose Molina, Alex Ochoa and Chone
Figgins.</TE>
<TE>   Left out are Dennis Cook, the 39-year-old left-hander who came off
the disabled list Sept. 1 after sitting out 52 games because of a
torn rotator cuff; Aaron Sele, the right-hander who will be making
his first start in today's regular-season finale since tearing the
rotator cuff in his throwing arm Aug. 20; and Mickey Callaway (2-1),
the right-hander who pitched a career-high eight innings Saturday to
beat the Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   The list is tentative because the Angels don't have to turn it in
until Tuesday, but it isn't expected to change unless there is an
injury in today's game.</TE>
<TE>   "I am pretty excited," said Rodriguez, who has never set foot in
New York, much less Yankee Stadium. "I'm 20 years old. I'm the rookie
guy. I just do my job, but I never thought I would make the playoff
roster."</TE>
<TE>   Cook was not happy to see his name left off the list.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a little disappointed," he said. "I still think I can help.
I'm maybe the only guy who does, but I still think I can help in the
playoffs. But there are guys throwing better than me and you've got
to go with those guys, the hot-handed guys. Everyone who was put on
the roster is deserving, so I have no gripe.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll still be around and hopefully I can offer advice that can
maybe help somebody."</TE>
<TE>   Is Cook, who began his career with Class-A Clinton in 1985,
contemplating retirement?</TE>
<TE>   "I will go home," he said, "be a dad and figure everything out
after that."</TE>
<TE>   When Callaway took the mound Saturday, he had not been informed of
his status for the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Early on, he was struggling to stay in the game. After giving up a
single to Luis Ugueto and walking Willie Bloomquist, there was a
conference at the mound.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little rusty," said Callaway, who last pitched Sept. 18.</TE>
<TE>   But he shook off that rust to retire the next three batters and
went on to hold the Mariners to three runs and eight hits with a
career-high six strikeouts and two walks.</TE>
<TE>   After the game, Callaway was informed he would not be back on the
mound in the division playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "I always kept a positive attitude," he said, "but I certainly
understand."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels unloaded on Seattle starter Ryan Franklin (7-5) for
eight runs and 12 hits in 5 2/3 innings, but only two of those runs
were earned. That's because of an error by Ugueto in the sixth
inning, in which the Angels went on to score seven runs.</TE>
<TE>   Designated hitter Brad Fullmer had two hits, including a triple,
giving him five hits in 10 at-bats in the last two games. Reserve
shortstop Alfredo Amezaga also had two hits, boosting his average to
.583 (seven for 12) since being added to the roster this month.</TE>
<TE>   But the only roster that matters now is the one that goes into
effect Tuesday, the one that offers a career springboard to some and
a diving board to others.</TE>

<HD>Square Deal at the Belfry</HD>
<DH>Golf: Woods wins two matches, Duval teams with Calcavecchia
for an unlikely victory and Ryder Cup is tied, 8-8, heading into
singles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SUTTON COLDFIELD, England</DL>
<LD>The unwritten Ryder Cup rules for both teams are simple, really, just
a matter of counting. Ready? You start at eight and if the U.S. gets
to 14 first, it's over.</LD>
<LD>   A three-day marathon that has turned into a sprint, that's what
the Ryder Cup has become, with nothing left today but 12 matches
worth 12 points and equal chances for glory or gloom at the Belfry.</LD>
<LD>   For the first time since the 1991 Ryder Cup at Kiawah, the U.S.
and Europe start the final day in a tie. How that happened was either
heartbreaking or lucky, depending on your point of view, because the
8-8 tie after Saturday wouldn't have occurred if not for a heavy dose
of the unexpected.</LD>
<TE>   How often does Sergio Garcia miss a two-foot putt? He did it
Saturday. Teamed with partner Lee Westwood and two up with two to
play against Tiger Woods and Davis Love III, Garcia three-putted the
17th after reaching the green in two and lost the hole.</TE>
<TE>   Then, at the 18th, Westwood stood over a 3 1/2-footer for par that
would halve the match. He missed, pulling it.</TE>
<TE>   "We got away with one," Love said. "You never know what's going to
happen."</TE>
<TE>   Woods and Love accepted the gift, a 1-up victory in best ball,
then stood back to watch Scott Hoch and Jim Furyk drop the last hole,
but still halve their match with Paul McGinley and Darren Clarke,
even though the U.S. had a 2-up lead through 13 holes.</TE>
<TE>   Woods, who won twice Saturday, was nearly flawless in his
afternoon match with Love. Woods made seven birdies, which was not so
simple when his task was to hit the ball and then drag Love along.</TE>
<TE>   Love, who had no birdies with David Duval on Friday, had one
birdie with Woods until the 17th, where he displayed a keen sense of
the dramatic by chipping in for birdie to win the hole.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Love nor Woods tried to drive the par-four 10th hole,
which measured 263 yards to the front, even after they saw both
Garcia and Westwood make it with the match all square.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't the right play," Love said. "We just didn't hit good
wedges."</TE>
<TE>   Garcia and Westwood got their birdie to take a 1-up lead, but when
Woods birdied the 13th, it was even again.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, by now, the unpredictable had become routine. Who
except U.S. captain Curtis Strange saw a better-ball pairing of Duval
and Mark Calcavecchia? Strange probably wished he hadn't after they
were 3-down to Niclas Fasth and Jesper Parnevik after seven holes.</TE>
<TE>   But Duval boldly drove the green at the 10th, two-putted for a
birdie and turned the match around in what became a 1-up U.S.
victory. Fasth and Parnevik were 2-up at the 10th and Duval knew
something had to give.</TE>
<TE>   "In that situation, we needed something," Duval said. "Really, to
swing the momentum, we had to take a shot at it."</TE>
<TE>   Europe's biggest weapon, Colin Montgomerie, improved his record to
3-0-1 and with Padraig Harrington, finally solved the Phil
Mickelson-David Toms team, 2 and 1.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, it's a numbers game right now, for both sides. In the
last 11 Ryder Cup competitions, the U.S. has won the singles nine
times. The only exceptions were in 1995 at Oak Hill and in 1985 at
the Belfry--both victories by Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Bjorn doesn't buy the theory that the U.S. usually wins
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "What is history?" he said. "Oak Hill? We won the singles, 7-5, at
Oak Hill. It can be done. If we can win, 7-5, in America [with] a
team that was the underdogs there, we can win the singles here."</TE>
<TE>   Sam Torrance front-loaded his singles lineup with his stars while
Strange back-loaded his. Hoch leads off against Montgomerie, then
it's Toms and Garcia, Duval and Clarke, Hal Sutton and Bernhard
Langer, Calcavecchia and Harrington, Stewart Cink and Bjorn, Scott
Verplank and Westwood, Paul Azinger and Fasth, Furyk and McGinley,
Love and Pierre Fulke, Mickelson and Phillip Price and Woods and
Parnevik.</TE>
<TE>   The four alternate-shot matches in the morning were an even split,
with Woods-Love defeating Clarke-Bjorn, 4 and 3, and Mickelson-Toms
turning it on late again to defeat Fulke-Price, 2 and 1.</TE>
<TE>   But Westwood-Garcia kept rolling, having little trouble with
Cink-Furyk, 2 and 1. Cink and Furyk produced one birdie in 17 holes
and shot five over.</TE>
<TE>   In the last alternate-shot match, Montgomerie-Langer edged
Verplank-Hoch, 1-up.</TE>
<TE>   Langer said Montgomerie's play has been a vital element and
credited his mental approach.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think he was down very much the last two days," Langer
said. "He seemed very relaxed, even in the practice rounds."</TE>
<TE>   Europe maintained its one-point lead from the first day and the
U.S. trailed, 6 1/2--5 1/2, when Saturday's better-ball matches began
in the afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   But Strange left himself open for some second-guessing with his
pairings, as soon as they were announced.</TE>
<TE>   Strange benched Azinger and paired Duval with Calcavecchia, who
has admitted he isn't comfortable in better ball. Strange also kept
Hoch out on the course, even though he was winless after two matches,
and paired him with Furyk, which meant that Furyk would play all five
matches.</TE>
<TE>   All four of the U.S. teams trailed, but Strange's moves worked
out, thanks to a bold play by Duval and the putts by Garcia and
Westwood that stayed out of the hole.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Nederlander Family Expresses Interest</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan and Jeff Leeds;   Steve Springer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The success of the Angels, who are returning to the playoffs for the
first time in 16 years, and the consummation of a new labor
agreement, ensuring there will be no work stoppage for four years and
possibly easing baseball's competitive and revenue disparities, seem
to have revived the long-dormant efforts of the Walt Disney Co. to
sell the team.</LD>
<LD>   Sources said Saturday that the Nederlander family, one of the last
independent operators in the increasingly consolidated entertainment
and production business, has expressed interest.</LD>
<LD>   Disney officials declined to comment, but lawyer Neil Papiano, who
represents the Nederlanders, confirmed what he described as "very
preliminary discussions" regarding the Angels and added that Disney
and the Nederlanders have been "longtime partners" in several
entertainment ventures.</LD>
<TE>   "Given their relationship and the Nederlanders' interest in
baseball, it's probably not surprising that the Angels would have
come up," Papiano said. "However, it's very preliminary. No one at
this point has asked to look at any of the club's figures or books."</TE>
<TE>   That step would require approval of the commissioner's office and
might have to wait until the division series between the Angels and
New York Yankees is concluded, given the Nederlanders' financial ties
to the Yankees. James Nederlander Sr. and his brother, Robert, are
limited partners in the Yankees, and Robert served as Yankee
president in 1990-91. They would have to divest those holdings under
baseball rules if they were to buy the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   The Nederlanders own theaters from New York to Los Angeles and are
involved in the production of a wide variety of Broadway shows and
concerts.</TE>
<TE>   Their companies own or lease or operate and/or exclusively book
several Southern California venues, including the Greek Theatre
(which they plan to operate in conjunction with the House of Blues),
Pantages Theatre and Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim, where Disney's Mighty
Ducks play.</TE>
<TE>   The Nederlanders are not alone in their interest in the Angels,
who have suddenly become a hot ticket in Orange County and taken on
the look of a hot property.</TE>
<TE>   Although the status of negotiations between Disney and Alabama
businessman Donald Watkins is unclear, The Times reported in
Saturday's editions that Carlos Peralta, a billionaire who owns a
Mexican League baseball team, is also pursuing the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   In March, Forbes magazine listed Peralta among the 400 richest
people in the world and estimated his net worth at $1.3 billion. A
baseball official said Saturday that Peralta is sincere in his desire
to buy a major league team and hopes to meet with Disney officials
soon.</TE>
<TE>   In its desire to sell the Angels, separately or in tandem with the
Ducks, Disney has hired Lehman Brothers, a New York investment
banking firm, to identify potential buyers and aggressively shop the
teams.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While the rest of the San Francisco Giants drenched each other with
bubbly, beer and water, Barry Bonds stood quietly in a corner with a
towel wrapped around his neck.</LD>
<LD>   Although Bonds hit the splash homer that propelled the Giants into
the playoffs with a 5-2 victory over the Houston Astros on Saturday
at Pacific Bell Park, he is reserving all his excitement for a later
date.</LD>
<LD>   "I've been here, done it--seven times," Bonds said. "I want to win
the World Series."</LD>
<TE>   It was Bonds' fifth-inning homer and pinch-hitter Tom Goodwin's
two-run double in the seventh that sent the Giants on their way to
clinching the National League wild card with their seventh
consecutive victory.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds' 46th homer and the 613th of his career landed in McCovey
Cove.</TE>
<TE>   Houston and San Francisco set a major league record for a
nine-inning game by using eight pitchers apiece.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants will play NL East champion Atlanta in the first round
of the playoffs starting Wednesday at Turner Field.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 17, Colorado 8--Matt Williams and Steve Finley each
homered twice at Phoenix, where the defending World Series champions
hit five home runs to clinch the NL West.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona will face NL Central champion St. Louis in the first round
of the playoffs starting Tuesday. The Diamondbacks lead St. Louis by
one game in the race for home-field advantage, but the Cardinals hold
the tiebreaker if the teams finish with identical records.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 3, Milwaukee 1-- Chuck Finley earned the 200th victory
of his career and kept the host Cardinals in the hunt for home-field
advantage in the first round of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The Brewers tied a franchise record with their 55th road loss.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 5, New York 2--Chipper Jones reached 100 runs batted in
for the seventh consecutive season, John Smoltz got his 55th save,
two short of Bobby Thigpen's major league record, and Vinny Castilla
hit a two-run homer at New York.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 5, Pittsburgh 4-- Bobby Hill's single drove in the winning
run, capping a two-run, ninth-inning rally at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 9, Florida 3-- Placido Polanco and Bobby Abreu hit
consecutive doubles in a five-run third inning at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 6, Cincinnati 0-- Vladimir Guerrero had three hits but
remained one homer shy of a 40-40 season when his third-inning drive
landed directly on top of the right-field wall at Montreal before
bouncing back on the field for a run-scoring single.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AMERICAN LEAGUE</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 10, Texas 8--Miguel Tejada homered twice and the A's
rallied from a five-run deficit at Arlington, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   The A's remained a half-game behind New York in the competition
for home-field advantage through the American League playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   New York 4, Baltimore 2-- Bernie Williams had three hits and two
RBIs at Baltimore, and the Yankees won their fourth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Williams has 204 hits, improving on his team season record by a
switch-hitter. He had 202 in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 6, Kansas City 5-- Jim Thome tied the score with his
52nd homer, a three-run drive in the eighth, and Ellis Burks hit a
grounder that went for an error and scored the winning run in the
10th at Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 10, Detroit 2--Carlos Delgado hit his 10th home run in
September, and the host Blue Jays won their sixth in a row, matching
their season high.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 9, Boston 6--Boston's Manny Ramirez doubled twice at
Fenway Park to improve his league-leading batting average to .349.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 3, Chicago 2-- Bobby Kielty hit a two-run homer in the
eighth to lead the Twins at Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Guardado earned his 45th save.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As expected, Florida outfielder Tim Raines, 43, a seven-time
All-Star, announced his retirement. He had 808 stolen bases in 23
seasons, eighth all-time.</TE>

<HD>No. 20 Nebraska Sees Red, Loses Again</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's a new Big Red to deal with in the Big 12 North, where Iowa
State suddenly has eclipsed Nebraska.</LD>
<LD>   Seneca Wallace ran for two touchdowns and threw for another as the
19th-ranked Cyclones signaled a shift of power in the conference by
dominating No. 20 Nebraska, 36-14, Saturday at Ames, Iowa.</LD>
<LD>   Adam Benike kicked three field goals for the Cyclones (5-1, 2-0 in
conference), who handed the Cornhuskers (3-2, 0-1) their first
consecutive regular-season losses since 1976.</LD>
<TE>   "I was ready for this one like never before," said Iowa State's
Michael Wagner, a former La Puente Bishop Amat standout who rushed
for 107 yards in 19 carries.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa State receiver Lane Danielsen wasn't nearly as surprised by
the team's effort.</TE>
<TE>   "Going into it, I expected victory," Danielsen said. "I felt like
we were a better team. There was never a point in the game when I
felt we were going to lose the game."</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska's loss came two weeks after a numbing 40-7 loss to Penn
State and is sure to turn up the heat on fifth-year Coach Frank
Solich, whose team committed five turnovers in losing for the fourth
time in the last seven games.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll either splinter apart or come together," Solich said.
"There's no middle ground."</TE>
<TE>   Iowa State beat a ranked team for the first time since 1993 and it
was the Cyclones' first victory over Nebraska since Nov. 14, 1992.</TE>
<TE>   The Cyclones scored 17 points off turnovers and dominated in every
area. They outgained Nebraska, 412-273, and held the Cornhuskers to
81 yards rushing. Nebraska had averaged 411 yards rushing in its
previous nine games against Iowa State.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Stuntz replaced an ineffective Jammal Lord at quarterback.
Lord's only highlight was a 90-yard touchdown pass to Ross Pilkington
in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace scored on runs of one and seven yards and he passed to
Danielsen for a three-yard touchdown, which gave the Cyclones a 19-7
halftime lead. They put the game out of reach with an 80-yard scoring
drive to start the second half, culminated by Wallace's one-yard
touchdown run after a shove from fullback Joe Woodley.</TE>
<TE>   "We've come a long ways, we've got a long ways to go," Iowa State
Coach Dan McCarney said. "If we want to take it to the next level, if
we want to be special, if we want to make this a memorable season,
these are the games we've got to start winning."</TE>
<TE>   No. 2 Oklahoma 31, South Florida 14--Nate Hybl threw two touchdown
passes and Antonio Perkins returned a punt 82 yards for a score for
the Sooners at Norman, Okla. Oklahoma (4-0), which was idle last
week, punted on its first four possessions before Perkins got them
going with his punt return four minutes into the second quarter. He
wound up with 150 yards in six returns. South Florida is 2-2.</TE>
<TE>   No. 3 Texas 49, Tulane 0--Chris Simms passed for 176 yards and two
short touchdowns and Selvin Young had two short scoring runs and a
71-yard punt return for a touchdown in the Longhorns' victory at New
Orleans. Cedric Benson rushed for 88 yards, including a 15-yard
touchdown run for the Longhorns (4-0), who handed Tulane (2-3) its
first shutout since 1995, when the Green Wave lost to Southern
Mississippi, 45-0.</TE>
<TE>   Simms completed 17 of 31 passes but seemed out of sync on several
drives, and he was intercepted once. Texas didn't get its first score
until late in the first quarter when an interception by Reed Boyd at
the Tulane 27 helped set up Sloan Thomas' 11-yard touchdown
reception.</TE>
<TE>   No. 24 Texas A&amp;M 31, Louisiana Tech 3--Dustin Long threw Texas
A&amp;M's first passing touchdown in seven regular-season games, leading
the Aggies at College Station, Texas. It was the first game for the
Aggies (3-1) with assistant head coach Kevin Sumlin calling the
offensive plays. Coach R.C. Slocum stripped offensive coordinator
Dino Babers of his play-calling duties after last week's 13-3 loss to
No. 5 Virginia Tech. Louisiana Tech is 2-3.</TE>
<TE>   Missouri 44, Troy State 7--Freshman Brad Smith threw for 213
yards, ran for 137 and scored two touchdowns to lead the Tigers (3-1)
over the Trojans (1-4) at Columbia, Mo. Zack Abron rushed for 98
yards and also scored twice for Missouri and R.J. Jones tied a school
record with three interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Troy State defensive back Damien Coleman was taken off the field
on a stretcher late in the second quarter, and was hospitalized with
an injured neck. Troy State Coach Larry Blakeney said after the game
that Coleman had some weakness in his right hand. Results of a CT
scan came back negative.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas 43, Tulsa 33--Bill Whittemore ran for three touchdowns,
passed for another and accounted for 395 total yards for Kansas at
Tulsa, Okla. Whittemore's touchdowns included a 74-yard run as the
Jayhawks (2-3) handed Tulsa (0-5) its 15th consecutive loss, the
nation's longest losing streak.</TE>

<HD>Clarett Comes Back, Ohio State Cruises</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After missing a week because of a knee injury, Ohio State freshman
Maurice Clarett ran for 104 yards and scored three touchdowns on
short first-half runs as the sixth-ranked Buckeyes beat Indiana,
45-17, in a Big Ten Conference game Saturday at Columbus, Ohio.</LD>
<LD>   Clarett, who had arthroscopic surgery Sept. 17 to remove torn
cartilage from his right knee, gained 51 yards in 14 first-half
carries, then gained 53 yards in seven second-half carries.</LD>
<LD>   The three touchdowns gave Clarett nine in four games--the most by
an Ohio State freshman during one season in more than half a century.
Cris Carter had eight in 1984, and Robert Smith matched the total in
1990.</LD>
<TE>   The 6-foot, 230-pound Clarett missed last week's narrow victory at
Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   "All of us in the stadium were excited to have Maurice back in
uniform and playing," Tressel said. "We're better when he's playing."</TE>
<TE>   Clarett scored on runs of two, one and four yards as Ohio State
(5-0, 1-0 in conference) built a 21-10 lead on the Hoosiers (2-3,
0-1). He didn't carry the ball after having a 28-yard run called back
because of a holding penalty with five minutes left in the third
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana stayed in the game until midway through the third quarter,
thanks to quarterback Gibran Hamdan, who completed 16 of 26 passes
for 210 yards and a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   No. 14 Michigan 45, Illinois 28--John Navarre threw for 264 yards
and four touchdowns and Michigan's defense forced five turnovers at
Champaign, Ill. Michigan (4-1, 1-0)--second to last in scoring in the
Big Ten--scored 31 consecutive points.</TE>
<TE>   After winning the Big Ten last season, Illinois (1-4, 0-1) is off
to its worst start since going 0-11 in 1997. It was the third time
this season Illinois has given up more than 30 points.</TE>
<TE>   Navarre threw two touchdowns passes to tight end Bennie Joppru,
who had seven catches for 74 yards. Running back Chris Perry ran for
two scores and had 90 yards rushing in 22 carries.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan State 39, Northwestern 24--Charles Rogers set an NCAA
record by catching a touchdown pass in his 13th consecutive
regular-season game as Michigan State won at East Lansing, Mich.
Rogers broke the record shared by Marshall's Randy Moss, Michigan's
Desmond Howard and Pacific's Aaron Turner.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers' 21-yard touchdown reception midway through the second
quarter gave Michigan State (3-2, 1-0) a 17-10 lead. The Spartans
scored 16 consecutive points over a span of 5:44 during the third and
fourth quarters to pull away from Northwestern (2-3, 0-1).</TE>
<TE>   Michigan State's Dawan Moss rushed for a career-high 191 yards in
26 carries.</TE>
<TE>   Purdue 28, Minnesota 15--Joey Harris ran for 106 yards and two
touchdowns and the Boilermakers scored 21 third-quarter points at
West Lafayette, Ind. Purdue (3-2, 1-0) has won seven consecutive
games against Minnesota and has not lost at home to the Gophers since
1990.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota (4-1, 0-1) was stymied by a defense that returned one
interception for a score and recovered a fumble that led to another
touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota's Asad Abdul-Khaliq came in leading the nation in
passing efficiency, but was 16 for 48 for 233 yards with one
touchdown and one interception.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Before the Angels' famous collapse in the 1986 American League
championship series against the Boston Red Sox, there was 1982, when
they squandered a 2-0 lead in a best-of-five series against the
Milwaukee Brewers.</LD>
<LD>   Before Dave Henderson, there was Cecil Cooper.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels had three chances to finish the Brewers after winning
twice in Anaheim Stadium but failed and became the first team to fail
to reach the World Series after taking a 2-0 lead in the league
championship series.</LD>
<TE>   The Brewers never trailed in Games 3 and 4 at Milwaukee, then
rallied for a 4-3 victory behind Cooper's two-run single off Angel
reliever Luis Sanchez in the seventh inning in Game 5.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee had demons to face after the 1982 World Series, in which
it squandered a 3-2 series lead en route to losing in seven games to
the St. Louis Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   The Brewers haven't been to the playoffs since 1982, the
second-longest streak in the major leagues behind Montreal's 21-year
drought.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who is the Angels' leading hitter in postseason play?</TE>
<TE>   Righty vs. lefty: No one second-guessed Manager Gene Mauch's
decision to have closer Donnie Moore pitch to Henderson in the ninth
inning of Game 5 in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   But with the left-handed Cooper at the plate and the bases loaded
in Game 5 in 1982, Mauch stuck with the right-handed Sanchez. Mauch
had left-hander Andy Hassler warmed up and ready to go.</TE>
<TE>   Wrote Times staffer Mike Penner: "Mauch, perhaps overanalyzing the
situation, tried to explain how Hassler got most of his outs on
pitches outside the strike zone, which is why the manager didn't want
to bring him in, needing his pitcher to throw strikes. Hassler,
though, wasn't buying any of that."</TE>
<TE>   Said an angry Hassler: "I'm not going to let that ... put the
monkey on my back. If he's not man enough to say he made a mistake,
then I'll say it."</TE>
<TE>   For what it's worth: The Angels' 2002 media guide devoted only
four of its 428 pages to the club's three postseason appearances.
Three pages feature box scores of the 1979, 1982 and 1986 ALCS games.
A fourth page includes team playoff records.</TE>
<TE>   Thank you: "The most useless, overpaid job in sports journalism
today is sideline football reporter for television," wrote USA
Today's Jon Saraceno. "Rarely is valuable information passed along. I
don't know when, or where, it will happen, but one day a frustrated
coach walking off at halftime is going to be asked one too many inane
questions and he's going to erupt like a volcano."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1984, Mike Prindle of Western
Michigan set an NCAA record with seven field goals in a 42-7 rout of
Marshall.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Fred Lynn, who batted .611 (11 for 18) in the 1982
ALCS.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: New Clipper guard Marko Jaric said he received an
unexpected greeting when he presented his passport upon arrival in
the United States last week.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy at passport control said, 'Oh, you're going to play for
the Clippers, oh, you play for Yugoslavia,' " said Jaric, a member of
the Yugoslavian national team that won the world championship. "That
was nice. It's good that people know something good about Yugoslavia,
something positive. Not just war."</TE>

<HD>Gesser Makes a Go of It</HD>
<DH>Pacific 10: He throws for 431 yards in Washington State's
48-38 win at California, despite having a dislocated rib.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>Washington State Coach Mike Price didn't dare keep Jason Gesser from
playing Saturday, even if the quarterback did have a dislocated rib.</LD>
<LD>   After a slow start, Gesser seemed like his old self, passing for
431 yards and four touchdowns as No. 16 Washington State rallied to
defeat California, 48-38, in the Pacific 10 Conference opener for
both teams.</LD>
<LD>   "The guy is tough as steel," Price said. "He wasn't going to let
me make any other decision. He probably would have quit if I tried,
or boycotted or revolted."</LD>
<TE>   Three Washington State receivers topped 100 yards, led by Jerome
Riley with seven receptions for 139 yards and a touchdown. The
Cougars (4-1), who were the preseason favorites to win the
conference, scored 29 points in the third quarter to erase a 21-9
halftime deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Kyle Boller threw for a career-high 371 yards and three touchdowns
to lead Cal, which lost its second consecutive game after starting
3-0. The Golden Bears have lost four in a row to the Cougars and six
of seven.</TE>
<TE>   Gesser completed 28 of 44 passes. Mike Bush had five catches for
125 yards and a touchdown and Devard Darling had six catches for 109
yards and a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Gesser started and played the whole game despite the dislocated
rib on his right side, which he hurt last week against Montana State.
He wore a special hard flak jacket. After struggling in the first
half, he directed scoring drives in the Cougars' first two offensive
series of the second half on the way to a 10-point lead.</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought I would not play," Gesser said. "I pretty much
gave [Price] no choice."</TE>
<TE>   Darling caught a six-yard touchdown pass with 4:35 left to break a
38-38 tie. Gesser set up the score by completing a 41-yard pass to
Riley despite getting drilled by Tully Banta-Cain as he released the
ball.</TE>
<TE>   Drew Dunning had a season-best 48-yard field goal with 2:27 left
to seal the victory.</TE>
<TE>   After a fumbled kickoff by the Cougars, the Bears (3-2, 0-1) tied
it at 38-38 on a 20-yard field goal by Mark Jensen with 7:33 left.</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Makonnen had seven catches for 136 yards and a touchdown
for the Bears. Joe Igber carried 20 times for 111 yards and a
touchdown, but he got most of his yardage early.</TE>
<TE>   The teams combined for 1,050 yards of offense.</TE>
<TE>   Cal built its 21-9 halftime lead behind Boller's 16 completions
for 191 yards, including five to Tom Swoboda for 53 yards and a
touchdown.</TE>

<HD>It Ends Up Being Wild-Goose Chase</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Dodgers beat the Padres, 14-2, but are eliminated
from playoff contention when the Giants, with Goodwin's help, defeat
the Astros.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Miracles finally ceased for the Dodgers on Saturday. They walloped
the San Diego Padres, 14-2, before 33,664 in Dodger Stadium, ending a
string of five consecutive one-run nail-biters with a laugher, but
they ran out of lifelines.</LD>
<LD>   While the Dodgers pounded 18 hits off the Padres, the San
Francisco Giants beat Houston, 5-2, to clinch the National League
wild-card berth and eliminate the Dodgers from playoff contention.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers won six of their last seven games, thrilling their
fans with five victories in their last at-bat, but they were unable
to gain ground on a San Francisco team that has won seven in a row
and is 28-10 since Aug. 19. The Dodgers have 92 wins entering today's
season finale but will finish in third place.</LD>
<TE>   "There's an emptiness in here today," Manager Jim Tracy said.
"When you have the potential to win 93 games and you're still going
home, that's a big pill that is difficult to swallow.... It's a
bittersweet day for me. I hurt for my players, because when you've
had the year they've had, you wish in your heart there was something
more for them."</TE>
<TE>   Most Dodger starters were pulled by the seventh inning Saturday
and were watching the clubhouse television when Giant pinch-hitter
Tom Goodwin, who drew almost all of his $3.5-million salary from the
Dodgers after being released in spring training, slapped a two-out,
two-run double in the seventh to push a 3-2 lead to 5-2.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a little tough to swallow," Dodger first baseman Eric
Karros said of Goodwin, who beat the Dodgers with an RBI single in
the 11th inning on July 19 and a two-run homer in the ninth on July
21. "The announcers were commenting how he has 14 runs batted in this
season, five against us. That's kind of ironic."</TE>
<TE>   Said Dodger General Manager Dan Evans: "I looked at the Giants'
celebration, and that's my motivation for the off-season. We won 92
games, and it wasn't enough. We have to figure out how to get better.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody's real happy around here, but that's good. When your
expectations are elevated to the point where third place is not good
enough, that's a good sign. This hurts, but we'll build on it."</TE>
<TE>   Many Dodgers will head home tonight feeling conflicted. By most
estimates, the Dodgers exceeded expectations in 2002. A team few
thought would challenge for a playoff spot rode a deep and talented
rotation, an opportunistic if not overwhelming offense and the
reliable relief arms of Eric Gagne and Paul Quantrill to the final
weekend of the season before being eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   But how can the Dodgers, with a payroll in excess of $100 million,
feel satisfied knowing they led the NL West by 3 1/2 games on July 2,
led the wild-card race by 4 1/2 games on Aug. 24 and still didn't
earn their first playoff spot since 1996?</TE>
<TE>   "As players, there's no question we're disappointed," second
baseman Mark Grudzielanek said. "A lot of guys aren't happy with
what's gone on, with how we played. Some will say we improved, but
with a club like this, we want to win. With the personnel we have, we
should win."</TE>
<TE>   Some wrote off the Dodgers after they were swept by the combined
score of 24-2 in a season-opening series against the Giants, but a
rotation led by Hideo Nomo, Odalis Perez, Kazuhisa Ishii and Andy
Ashby compensated for an anemic offense during the first two months,
and then Shawn Green got hot.</TE>
<TE>   Green smashed 10 homers in seven games from May 21-27, Dodger
hitters began to support the pitchers, Gagne put a padlock on the
ninth inning--his 52 saves leading to the team's 33-15 record in
one-run games--and the Dodgers surged into first place in late June.</TE>
<TE>   A post-All-Star game funk, in which the Dodgers lost 17 of 25
games, dropped them seven games back in early August.</TE>
<TE>   But they rebounded, winning 20 of 27 from Aug. 7-Sept. 6, and were
back in the playoff race.</TE>
<TE>   Then Ishii suffered a fractured skull when he was hit by a line
drive on Sept. 8, Kevin Brown was sidelined for the rest of the
season because of a back injury, Ashby and Omar Daal went into
horrendous pitching slumps, the Dodgers lost 11 of 17 from Sept.
7-24, and the Giants surged past them.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," Grudzielanek said, when asked when the season got
away from the Dodgers. "We can't let that happen. We hit a rut after
the All-Star break, and there were some periods in the second half
when we were absolutely terrible."</TE>
<TE>   There were plenty of highlights: Green's major league-record
four-homer, 19-total-base game in Milwaukee on May 23; Perez's
near-perfect game in Chicago on April 26; Gagne's emergence as a
dominant closer; Dave Roberts' evolution into a top-notch leadoff
batter; Ishii's 10-1 start; Nomo's 14-1 record since May 12 and Brian
Jordan's 30 RBIs in September.</TE>
<TE>   There were as many lowlights: Giving up eight runs in the seventh
inning of an 8-6 loss to Milwaukee on May 21; Troy O'Leary's two-run
homer off Gagne that gave the Expos a stunning 4-3 win on Aug. 13;
three losses in four games at Colorado Sept. 12-15, and Ishii and
shortstop Alex Cora being hauled away in ambulances in a span of two
weeks in late August and early September.</TE>
<TE>   There are plenty of questions heading into the off-season: Will
Brown return to full strength after elbow and back surgery? Will
Darren Dreifort ever come back? Will Jordan, who can demand a trade,
or free agents Daal and Marquis Grissom, be back? Can the Dodgers
deal Grudzielanek and make a run at free-agent slugger Jeff Kent?</TE>
<TE>   But for now, there is only disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't have enough to finish it off," Grudzielanek said. "San
Francisco was definitely the better team, and they proved it."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Omar Daal threw eight shutout innings Friday night, giving up two
hits and striking out six in the Dodgers' 1-0 victory over the
Padres.</LD>
<LD>   One of Daal's best performances of the season was probably his
last as a Dodger--the left-hander will be a free agent this winter
and seems certain to leave.</LD>
<LD>   Daal, who is 11-9 with a 3.90 earned-run average, wants a
multiyear deal and assurances he'll be a starter. With four
starters--Hideo Nomo, Andy Ashby, Kazuhisa Ishii and Kevin
Brown--under contract for 2003 and another, Odalis Perez, under team
control, the Dodgers can't make any promises.</LD>
<TE>   When Daal, who made $5 million this season, was demoted to the
bullpen to start the season, he demanded a trade, but the Dodgers
kept him as an insurance policy if Brown or Ashby suffered relapses
from last year's elbow surgeries.</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, Brown was limited to 10 starts, so Daal made 23
starts and filled a rotation spot from late May through the end of
the season.</TE>
<TE>   "But I hope they get someone else as insurance next year, not me,"
Daal said. "I'm a starter, not an insurance policy."</TE>

<LD>The meeting ends today with the $100,000 Ralph M. Hinds Handicap
holding center stage, and Reba's Gold and Hot Market figure to get
plenty of attention as they make their local debuts in the 1 1/8-mile
feature. One look at the company they were keeping at Del Mar will
make the case.</LD>
<LD>   Reba's Gold was freshened after setting the pace in the
Californian at Hollywood Park in mid-June, when he was overpowered by
the likes of Milwaukee Brew and Bosque Redondo, then ran well in his
last appearance in the Del Mar Breeders' Cup Handicap, finishing only
a length behind a couple of very tough customers in Congaree and
Kela.</LD>
<LD>   If the Dan Hendricks trainee can run back to that effort around
these tight bends, he should be hard to deny under David Flores.</LD>
<TE>   He'll no doubt have Hot Market as one of his primary targets, as
this horse likes to run at the front.</TE>
<TE>   Hot Market has come back to meet trainer Craig Lewis in the
winner's circle after five of his 14 starts, and came within a head
of winning the Pat O'Brien at Del Mar in his most recent outing. Jose
Valdivia Jr., who has been aboard for the last three victories, makes
a rare visit to the fair as Hot Market makes his first attempt at
nine furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   If you subscribe to the "horse for course" theory, Sigfreto and
Nates Colony make nice options. The former is unbeaten in two stakes
appearances at this track, having won the Derby last season and the
Phil D. Shepherd two weeks ago. Nates Colony has clicked in all three
of his starts at this track and ran in the Pacific Classic at Del
Mar.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Crown O Lites. 2. Prideful. 3. Kate'n Amy. 4. Who
Dis. 5. Broke The Slump. 6. Avie Cielo. 7. Trieste. 8. Profound
Secret. 9. Minnesota Shuffle. 10. Calcupbound. 11. Rehabilitated. 12.
Reba's Gold. 13. Glow Of Gold.</TE>

<LD>Chance Harridge threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to Don Clark with 17
seconds left to lift Air Force over Utah, 30-26, Saturday at Salt
Lake City.</LD>
<LD>   The Falcons (4-0, 2-0 Mountain West) scored 24 unanswered points
in the second half to win their fourth consecutive game. Their last
three victories have come in overtime or the last minute of
regulation.</LD>
<LD>   The Utes (2-3, 0-1) lost their third in a row.</LD>
<TE>   Clark caught two touchdown passes and Harridge ran for one as the
Falcons took advantage of six Utah turnovers and a blocked punt.</TE>
<TE>   Utah's Brandon Warfield ran for 193 yards and three touchdowns,
but fumbled three times. The Utes also had a season-high 148 yards on
13 penalties, including four for unsportsmanlike conduct.</TE>
<TE>   Air Force entered the game as the worst passing team in the
nation. Harridge was only six of 16 for 99 yards, and the 20-yarder
to Clark was the longest of the game. Utah held the Falcons to a
season-low 188 rushing yards.</TE>

<HD>It's Hog Heaven in Iowa</HD>

<AU>Mike Bresnahan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Looks as if the Clay County Fair won't be the most exciting thing to
happen in Iowa this year.</LD>
<LD>   For the first time in forever, there's reason to care about
college football in Ames, Iowa, after Iowa State's 36-14 victory over
Nebraska.</LD>
<LD>   Add Iowa's 42-35 overtime victory at Penn State, and suddenly the
fabled Tri-State Rodeo looks more like a dog-and-pony show to
delirious Iowans.</LD>
<TE>   In particular, the folks in Ames, accustomed to turning their back
on football every year in early October, have reason to watch the
Cyclones' next game, Oct. 12 against Texas Tech.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of red-clad Cyclone fans stormed the field after
Saturday's game and several headed for the goalposts. One reveler
accidentally popped Coach Dan McCarney.</TE>
<TE>   "I got a fat lip out of that," McCarney said. "That can get a
little dangerous, but I'll try to fight my way out of that danger any
time."</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska did not run a play in Iowa State territory until less
than 10 minutes remained, and McCarney, in his eighth season at Iowa
State, improved to 1-24 against ranked teams.</TE>
<TE>   "This was time to shock the world," Iowa State running back
Michael Wagner said.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, some Iowans will say they knew it all along, that Iowa
State should have won by 45 points.</TE>
<TE>   After all, Iowa State beat Iowa by five, Iowa beat Penn State by
seven and Penn State crushed Nebraska by 33.</TE>
<TE>   The saddest person in Jack Trice Stadium might have been Nebraska
center John Garrison, who predicted victory during the week.</TE>
<TE>   "I made that comment because of the confidence I had in this
team," he said. "It's not the performance I pictured."</TE>
<TE>   Only slightly less exciting for the Hawkeye State was Iowa's
victory over Penn State.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa, which last won the Rose Bowl in 1959, blew a 22-point lead
in the fourth quarter but battled back in overtime and became the
third team to beat a Joe Paterno-coached team three years in a row.</TE>
<TE>   "We kept hearing about how ... tough it is to come up here and
play," Iowa defensive lineman Jared Clauss said. "They are loud, but
we weren't intimidated by that. We weren't intimidated by the
stadium, by the crowd or any of this."</TE>
<TE>   Iowa players, some still wearing shoulder pads and helmets, dived
into the crowd to celebrate with Hawkeye fans.</TE>
<TE>   The game shouldn't have been close. Iowa committed two turnovers
in the last 7 1/2 minutes to aid Penn State's 22-point rally.</TE>
<TE>   "If we protect the ball a little better in the second half, it's
probably not as exciting," Iowa Coach Kirk Ferentz said. "We're 1-0
[in the Big Ten Conference] and that's the extent of it."</TE>
<TE>   Paging Lt. Frank Drebin...</TE>
<TE>   Penn State better increase its crowd-control personnel--again.</TE>
<TE>   Extra security was recently added at Beaver Stadium because of a
rise in rowdy behavior in the student section, where 35 people were
ejected for throwing water bottles during last week's 49-17 victory
over Louisiana Tech. Several Nebraska fans also reported being
harassed after Penn State beat the Cornhuskers on Sept. 14.</TE>
<TE>   But who let that LaVar Arrington guy into the stadium? The
Washington Redskin linebacker was kicked out of Beaver Stadium
because he kept yelling at officials from the sideline of his alma
mater, Penn State.</TE>
<TE>   The former All-American was the second pick in the 2000 NFL draft.
The Redskins have a bye this week.</TE>
<TE>   Not Quite a Nutt House</TE>
<TE>   In anticipation of an overflow student section at Razorback
Stadium, Arkansas officials installed an additional 1,400 seats to
ease any overcrowding issues for the Alabama game.</TE>
<TE>   The most devoted students were in "The Nutt House," a section in
the north end zone named after Arkansas Coach Houston Nutt. The first
1,000 students in the section received free T-shirts from the school.</TE>
<TE>   The free gear might have been the highlight of their day: Arkansas
lost, 30-12.</TE>
<TE>   Krohn's All Alone</TE>
<TE>   A Pacific 10 quarterback transfers and struggles at his new
school. For once, it's not J.P. Losman.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Krohn left Arizona State for Massachusetts during the
off-season when it became apparent Coach Dirk Koetter had lost
confidence in him.</TE>
<TE>   Krohn, immediately eligible to play because the Minutemen compete
in Division I-AA, completed 13 of 36 passes Saturday for 194 yards
with three interceptions and a touchdown in a 56-24 loss at North
Carolina State.</TE>
<TE>   N.C. State's defense harassed Krohn early, intercepting his passes
on the Minutemen's first two possessions to set up scoring drives and
remind Arizona State fans what they're not missing.</TE>
<TE>   Krohn's replacement at Arizona State, sophomore Andrew Walter,
passed for 414 yards and five touchdowns and led the Sun Devils past
Stanford, 65-24.</TE>
<TE>   Walter led Arizona State to its highest score in a Pac-10 game and
posted one of the top 10 passing games in school history. The five
scoring throws tied Krohn for third.</TE>
<TE>   "Andrew was just firing, and we just rode it," Koetter said.</TE>
<TE>   Former UCLA hopeful Losman, by the way, had 121 yards passing and
two interceptions in Tulane's 49-0 loss to Texas.</TE>
<TE>   How About Ice Cream?</TE>
<TE>   Hopefully, nobody gets hungry during Georgia games.</TE>
<TE>   Damien Gary returned a punt 71 yards for a first-quarter touchdown
and the Bulldogs blocked a punt for the second consecutive week in a
41-10 victory against New Mexico State.</TE>
<TE>   "I doubt anyone is going to get popcorn when the other team goes
back to punt," Coach Mark Richt said. "We have a chance to block it
or return it for a TD."</TE>
<TE>   Georgia isn't the only Southeastern Conference team feasting on
opponents' punt teams.</TE>
<TE>   Louisiana State's Domanick Davis had 295 all-purpose yards,
including a 78-yard punt return in the Tigers' 31-13 victory over
Mississippi State. Davis had two punt returns for touchdowns
nullified because of penalties in the Tigers' first two games, but
finally got one that counted.</TE>
<TE>   Disarmed Forces</TE>
<TE>   The day started off well enough for Matt Silva, who rolled out of
bed and arrived at Michie Stadium for his first start as Army's
quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Then he threw his first pass, which was intercepted by Southern
Mississippi linebacker Rod Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Then he threw five more interceptions in a 27-6 loss and set an
Army record for most interceptions thrown in a game.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew that he was going to be a little shaky," Davis said.</TE>

<HD>Galaxy Can't Close It Out</HD>
<DH>Soccer: L.A. comes out flat in 4-1 loss to Wizards,
bringing first-round MLS playoff series back to the Rose Bowl for a
deciding game Wednesday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KANSAS CITY, Mo.</DL>
<LD>A disgusted look on his face, Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid could barely
look in the direction of his team's dressing room as he sat in a
stairwell in the bowels of Arrowhead Stadium on Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   The way he was talking, you'd have expected to walk into the
cramped quarters and find Galaxy team members combing the carpet for
their teeth.</LD>
<LD>   "Reality doesn't really sink in until you get slapped squarely in
the face and we got kicked in the face. We got kicked by a mule,"
Schmid said after the Galaxy's 4-1 loss to Kansas City in front of
9,484, a loss that evened the first-round, first-team-to-five-points
Major League Soccer playoff series at three points apiece and set up
a Game 3 Wednesday night at the Rose Bowl.</LD>
<TE>   "Hopefully there's some pain in that locker room and hopefully
they can turn that pain into what they need to do on Wednesday,"
Schmid said. "It's been a long time since we got our butt kicked."</TE>
<TE>   More than three months.</TE>
<TE>   The only time this season that the Galaxy lost by more than one
goal happened June 15 at the Meadowlands, where the New York/New
Jersey MetroStars thumped the Galaxy, 5-0.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the four goals the Galaxy gave up to Kansas City on
Saturday night tied a franchise playoff high, equaling the four the
MetroStars scored in a 4-1 game in the first round last season.</TE>
<TE>   In its locker room, the Galaxy seemed aware of its plight.</TE>
<TE>   A stunned Carlos Ruiz, who's normally flashing smiles to everyone
within sight, sat slumped in his chair staring at the ground after
being limited to one shot three days after setting an MLS playoff
record with six.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a spent Cobi Jones limped to the greaseboard at the
front of the room, picked up the blue pen and scribbled "PRIDE" for
his teammates to see and ponder.</TE>
<TE>   "That's right," yelled Tyrone Marshall. "That's what it all comes
down to: one game."</TE>
<TE>   It could have been over after two.</TE>
<TE>   But, as it did in its postseason opener, the No. 1-seeded and
Western Conference champion Galaxy inexplicably came out
lackadaisical.</TE>
<TE>   Eighth-seeded Kansas City, which is known for its deliberate
style, stormed the Galaxy from the first whistle, knowing that it
needed at least a tie to extend the series.</TE>
<TE>   The Wizards dominated the midfield in the first half, when the
Galaxy took only two shots, none on goal, and they took a 2-0 lead
into the half courtesy of goals by Igor Simutenkov, in the 19th
minute, and Eric Quill, in the 37th minute.</TE>
<TE>   "They had more play, more grit in the midfield, especially in the
first half when they were running through us very easily," Jones
said. "We wanted to cope with it in the second half but by that point
we were down two goals and we had to open up a little bit more."</TE>
<TE>   Schmid tried to jump-start the Galaxy offense by replacing
midfielder Mauricio Cienfuegos, 34, with forward Chris Albright, 23,
to start the second half.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't matter.</TE>
<TE>   With the Galaxy pushing the tempo, the Wizards' counterattack
thrived and Preki's goal in the 70th minute made it 3-0.</TE>
<TE>   On the ensuing kickoff, Ruiz quickly passed to Albright, who
lofted a high volley from 55 yards out and, with Wizard goalkeeper
Tony Meola's back to the play, the ball went over Meola's shoulder
and into the net for the score.</TE>
<TE>   The Wizards answered, though, two minutes later when Dario Fabbro
beat goalkeeper Kevin Hartman on a breakaway.</TE>
<TE>   "[The Wizards] came out with a lot of energy and pressed up,"
Schmid said. "They took risks and they sent people forward. We got
overwhelmed in midfield, we didn't win tackles, we didn't win 50-50
balls. I mean, we made a change at halftime but there were 10 other
guys I could have taken out and it wouldn't have mattered."</TE>

<HD>Evening Attire Doesn't Wear Out</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Outrunning Lido Palace in the stretch after favored Repent dropped
out of contention on the turn for home, Evening Attire ran himself
into a Breeders' Cup berth Saturday with a 2 3/4-length win in the
$1-million Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park.</LD>
<LD>   Sixteen of Evening Attire's 17 races have been over New York
tracks, where he's notched all seven of his wins, but his trainer,
Pat Kelly, said that the 4-year-old gelding's next start will be in
the $4-million Breeders' Cup Classic at Arlington Park on Oct. 26.
Evening Attire's sire, Black Tie Affair, was an Arlington-based
horse--he won six races there--who also won the 1991 Classic at
Churchill Downs and was later voted horse of the year.</LD>
<LD>   Lido Palace, who probably will miss the Classic because it would
require paying an $800,000 supplementary fee to make him eligible,
finished three-quarters of a length ahead of Harlan's Holiday. The
rest of the order of finish, in a 1 1/4-mile race over a drying-out
track listed as good, was Nothing Flat, Abreeze, Milwaukee Brew,
Repent and Puzzlement. Evening Attire, ridden by Shaun Bridgmohan,
was timed in 1:59 2/5 and paid $21 for $2.</LD>
<TE>   Evening Attire races for a partnership that includes Tommy Kelly,
a Hall of Fame trainer and son of the horse's trainer.</TE>
<TE>   As for Repent, "He had no punch and flattened out on the middle of
the turn," said Ken McPeek, his trainer. "Perhaps he has a lung
infection or he might have bled. We'll have to check him out. It's
hard to believe, because he was doing super."</TE>
<TE>   Also at Belmont, the German-bred Kazzia, ridden by Jorge Chavez
for Sheik Mohammed's Godolphin Racing, beat Turtle Bow by a neck to
win the $750,000 Flower Bowl Invitational. Mot Juste was third and
Starine ran fourth in a race reduced to seven starters by two
scratches, including Banks Hill, last year's Breeders' Cup Filly and
Mare Turf winner. Banks Hill, who has won only one of four starts
since the Breeders' Cup, will hope for firmer ground Saturday in the
Yellow Ribbon at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Kazzia, who paid $8.10, is considered the best 3-year-old filly in
Europe and won for the fifth time in six starts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Asong For Billy, claimed off Roberta Grissom by trainer Paul
Aguirre for $40,000 out of a maiden race at Hollywood Park on July 4,
overtook Splendid Times in the stretch to win the $100,000 Pomona
Derby on the next-to-last day of the Los Angeles County Fair meet at
Fairplex Park.</TE>

<TE>   Hall of Fame jockey Eddie Delahoussaye, who had been expected to
return Wednesday when the Oak Tree meet opens at Santa Anita, instead
will miss the rest of the year because of injuries suffered in a
spill at Del Mar on Aug. 30. Delahoussaye has been bothered by
headaches.... Arlington Park's stakes for 2-year-olds were both won
by longshots, Moonlight Sonata taking the $100,000
Arlington-Washington Lassie and Most Feared bagging the $150,000
Arlington-Washington Futurity. Moonlight Sonata paid $122.60, biggest
upset in Lassie history, and Most Feared returned $13.60.</TE>

<TE>   Valiantly, a 45-1 shot, won the $345,500 Pacific Coast Quarter
Horse Racing Assn. Breeders Futurity at Los Alamitos, in a race that
was marred when favored Special Queen Sa crashed into the inner rail
shortly after the start.</TE>
<TE>   Ridden by Eddie Garcia, who also won last year's race, Valiantly
paid $95.40, $35.60 and $19.20 across the board. The 2-year-old
filly, owned by Florencia Garcia and trained by Felix Gonzalez, won
one of the Futurity trials, but against a field that wasn't
considered especially strong.</TE>
<TE>   Deefirst was second and Just Think ran third. The time for 350
yards was 17.58 seconds. Neither Special Queen Sa nor her rider, Alex
Bautista, appeared to be seriously injured.</TE>

<LD>Long Beach Wilson so thoroughly dominated the South Coast water polo
tournament, the Bruins could have won the title playing a man down.
Or two.</LD>
<LD>   Wilson, No. 1 in The Times' rankings and the Southern Section
Division I poll, pretty much did so during a 14-9 trouncing of
Anaheim Servite in the tournament final Saturday at Newport Harbor
High.</LD>
<LD>   Servite, ranked No. 2 by The Times and No. 1 in Division II, had
seven man-advantage opportunities but scored on only one. Early in
the fourth quarter, Wilson was whistled for two ejection fouls within
10 seconds giving Servite a two-man advantage, but the Wilson defense
held tight and did not allow a score.</LD>
<TE>   Wilson held Servite without a goal from the last minute of the
third quarter until the Friars scored with five seconds left in the
game.</TE>
<TE>   "Without question defense is the strength of our team," Wilson
Coach Tony Martinho said.</TE>
<TE>   Twice during the second quarter, Wilson scored short-handed goals.
Clint Wilson made a steal at mid-pool and outsprinted two Servite
defenders for a score that gave Wilson a 5-4 lead with three minutes
left in the half. Garrit Barth did the same with 41 seconds left to
give Wilson a 7-5 halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   Clint Wilson finished with four goals for the Bruins (8-0). Barth
and John Foster each had three, and goalie Brent LaBounty had 11
saves.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Buckner had four goals for Servite (6-1).</TE>

<HD>Penn State Upended by Iowa</HD>
<DH>Big Ten: No. 12 Nittany Lions rally for 22 points in fourth
quarter, then fall in overtime, 42-35.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>STATE COLLEGE, Pa.</DL>
<LD>After losing a 22-point fourth-quarter lead, Iowa settled down during
an overtime that must have felt oddly familiar.</LD>
<LD>   C.J. Jones' six-yard touchdown reception in the overtime held up
for the Hawkeyes (4-1), who upset the No. 12 Nittany Lions, 42-35,
Saturday in a Big Ten opener.</LD>
<LD>   Penn State (3-1) had a chance to force a second overtime, but Zack
Mills' fourth-down pass fell incomplete to give the Hawkeyes their
third win in row over the Nittany Lions.</LD>
<TE>   It was only the second overtime game for both teams, with the
first coming against each other two years ago. In that game, the
Hawkeyes kicked a field goal in the second overtime, then intercepted
a pass from Rashard Casey to win it, 26-23.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Banks had 261 passing yards and four touchdowns for Iowa,
which has won four of five against Penn State and hasn't lost at
Happy Valley since 1994.</TE>
<TE>   After the game, Penn State Coach Joe Paterno ran after the
officials and grabbed one by the shoulder. Paterno later said he was
upset over a "couple of lousy calls on the other side of the field."</TE>
<TE>   Iowa is only the third school to beat a Paterno-coached team three
years in a row. Alabama (1987-89) and Michigan (1997-2001) also did
it.</TE>
<TE>   "We were hoping our defense would hold Penn State and they were
able to come together and win it for us," said Iowa's Fred Russell,
who ran for 142 yards and a touchdown. "It felt like it did two years
ago, when we won it in overtime here."</TE>
<TE>   Penn State staged a frantic comeback in the last 7 1/2 minutes of
regulation, scoring three touchdowns and converting a two-point
conversion to force overtime.</TE>
<TE>   But in the overtime, Penn State wasn't nearly as effective. On
second and eight from the nine-yard line, Mills threw to Tony
Johnson, but Johnson was ruled out of bounds. Two plays later, Mills'
final pass attempt hit the back of center Joe Iorio's helmet and fell
to the ground, ending the game.</TE>

<HD>Williams' Death Leaves Questions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lance Pugmire</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Of all the people who wanted answers from Kevin Williams, his mother
said she needed them most. When Williams, also known as Miles Dabord,
died Friday night at Scripps Hospital in Chula Vista, the questions
about his involvement in the South Pacific disappearances of his only
sibling, former NBA player Bison Dele, and two others became more
difficult to resolve.</LD>
<LD>   "I'll continue living with it as I have thus far--only now, I know
this is the way it will be forever," said Patricia Phillips, the
mother of Williams and Dele. "Sometimes, you aren't meant to know
things. So, you just construct your life around what you do know and
try your best to move forward. That's all I can do."</LD>
<LD>   Kevin Williams, 35, was deemed by French Polynesian police to be
the primary suspect in the early July disappearances of Dele, his
girlfriend, Serena Karlan, and boat captain Bertrand Saldo. Williams
was sailing with the three.</LD>
<TE>   But law enforcement officials were never able to press Williams
for an official story. Williams was found comatose in Tijuana and
transported to Scripps on Sept. 15. Doctors told Phillips he had
suffered massive brain damage after overdosing on insulin and not
taking his asthma medication. Surrounded by a cousin, close friend
and former girlfriend, Williams died at 7:45 p.m. Friday,
approximately 33 hours after being removed from life support.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips was summoned to the hospital early Friday from her Santa
Monica home, but traffic kept her from arriving until 10:40 p.m.
Williams will be cremated, Phillips said, and his ashes spread along
with those of her mother and sister at a memorial garden she is
planning near Ashville, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   A private ceremony for Dele and Williams is planned for Oct. 12 at
Trinity Baptist Church in West Los Angeles.</TE>

extend his record for victories in a season to 11. He drove into the
grass in his first lap and nearly spun.</TE>
<TE>   "I went wide in the first corner and couldn't make the corner,"
Schumacher said.</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher, who won the inaugural Indy race in 2000 and finished
second to now-retired Mika Hakkinen last year, went to his garage for
tires and stayed there until only a little more than 25 minutes
remained in the hour-long session.</TE>
<TE>   Three minutes later, his red Ferrari flashed past the finish line
to complete his record lap and knock Juan Pablo Montoya's
Williams-BMW off the top rung. Montoya qualified fourth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Burton made his fourth Busch Series victory of the season
look easy, beating rookie Kerry Earnhardt by more than three seconds
in the Mr. Goodcents 300 at Kansas Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   Burton, who started on the outside front, took control after
driving his Ford past Earnhardt's Chevrolet on the 172nd of 200 laps
on the 1.5-mile tri-oval. Burton led for 48 laps.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to win real bad, but I knew I couldn't hold Jeff off,"
said Earnhardt, who led for nine laps in his best finish this season.
"Once he got an open track, he just ran me down in nothing flat."</TE>
<TE>   Joe Nemechek was third, followed by series leader Greg Biffle, who
widened his lead over Jason Keller from 35 to 127 points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Todd Burns of Riverside claimed the 2002 Auto Club Late Model
Series championship as rain caused a lengthy delay to the race card
before 4,980 at Irwindale Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   Burns earned the title despite being in seventh place when the
50-lap race was stopped on Lap 35. Tim Huddleston won by default
because of the cancellation but could not close on Burns' lead. Burns
finished with a 26-point margin over Huddleston.</TE>
<TE>   The 75-lap Jani-King Super Late Model Series race was postponed
until next Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   After the 1-hour 51-minute rain delay, the Mechanix Wear Speed
Truck Series got underway with a shortened 50-lap feature. Dan
DiGiacomo led from start to finish.</TE>
<TE>   Ricky Wildman pulled into a tie for the lead in the King Taco
Legends Car Series by winning his sixth race this season. Tom
Landreth, who had led by eight points before the race, finished
fifth. Wildman holds the tiebreaker going into the final race with
six victories to three for Landreth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Glen Helen Raceway in San Bernardino will play host today to the
$100,000 World Cup of Motocross, taking the place of the canceled
Motocross des Nations that had originally been scheduled for this
weekend at Competition Park in San Jacinto.</TE>
<TE>   An international contingent of riders will be on hand for the
one-day event, which will consist of three 20-minute motos. The first
begins at 11 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   There will also be two support events, including a Fast Masters
race that includes Jeff Ward, Jeff Emig, Jeff Matiasevich, Larry
Brooks and Jeff Stanton competing in two 20-minute motos.</TE>
<TE>   American riders scheduled to comprise the three-man Team USA are
Tim Ferry, Sean Hamblin and Kyle Lewis. Ricky Carmichael, the
supercross and motocross champion, declined to participate.</TE>
<TE>   Other international team riders include Jean-Sebastien Roy of
Canada, Grant Langston of South Africa, Chad Reed of Australia and
Sebastien Tortelli of France.</TE>

**** Makings of a classic
*** Smash-mouth football
** Good for an end around
* Strictly fantasy fodder
** Dallas (1-2) at St. Louis (0-3), 10 a.m., Channel 11: After Ernie
Conwell's well-meaning "a house divided cannot stand" comment this
week, is there any doubt who will win this one? LINE: St. Louis by 12
*** Chicago (2-1) at Buffalo (1-2), 10 a.m.: It took the Bears four
years of losing before they started winning the close ones. Bills'
two losses are by a combined 11 points. LINE: Buffalo by 3
** New Orleans (3-0) at Detroit (0-3), 10 a.m.: Jim Haslett honors
Lou Holtz this week by spouting, "This is not a mismatch." LINE: New
Orleans by 7 1/2
*** Miami (3-0) at Kansas City (1-2), 10 a.m., Channel 2: Will Priest
Holmes steal back the thunder that Ricky Williams took from him
during their "Hook 'Em Horns" days? LINE: Miami by 3
*** Carolina (3-0) at Green Bay (2-1), 10 a.m.: Even another Panther
victory probably won't make the Super Bowl buzz any louder than a
house fly. LINE: Green Bay by 7
*** Cleveland (2-1) at Pittsburgh (0-2), 10 a.m., KNX (1070): Maybe
Tim Couch was in a reminiscent mood this week and studied tapes of
his backpedal-and-launch days at Kentucky. Steeler secondary cringes.
LINE: Pittsburgh by 6
* New York Jets (1-2) at Jacksonville (1-1), 10 a.m.: Jaguar owner
Wayne Weaver predicts on Web site that team will make playoffs. Tom
Coughlin hurts mouth after biting lip. LINE: Jacksonville by 3 1/2
* Houston (1-2) at Philadelphia (2-1), 10 a.m.: "No game is an easy
game," Eagle safety Blaine Bishop said. Except this one. LINE:
Philadelphia by 19 1/2
** New York Giants (2-1) at Arizona (1-2), 1 p.m.: What will be
worse: the game-time temperature on the field or the heat on Cardinal
quarterback Jake Plummer if he doesn't produce? LINE: New York by 3
** Tampa Bay (2-1) at Cincinnati (0-3), 1 p.m.: Jon Gruden hoping
that Keyshawn Johnson's visit to Bengalland has same effect as
showing a misguided teen the inside of a prison. LINE: Tampa Bay by 7
**** New England (3-0) at San Diego (3-0), 1:15 p.m.: The Chargers,
who haven't beaten the Patriots since 1973, hope glare of New England
Super Bowl rings doesn't blind them on road from nowhere. LINE: New
England by 3
*** Tennessee (1-2) at Oakland (2-0), 1:15 p.m., Channel 2, KMPC
(1540), KNX (1070), XTRA (690): Last time the Titans lost to the
Raiders, they were the Houston Oilers and pro football was still
being played at the Coliseum. LINE: Oakland by 7
** Minnesota (0-3) at Seattle (0-3), 5:30 p.m., ESPN: The
what-will-Randy-Moss-do-next sideshow bumps up this snoozer by one
star. Bet ESPN can't wait for NBA season. LINE: Seattle by 3
** Denver (3-0) at Baltimore (0-2), Monday, 6 p.m., Channel 7:
Luckily this game is in Baltimore so Brian Griese can't walk his dog
as a way to kill time Sunday. LINE: Denver by 7

<LD>King Coach Andy Murray, once a finalist for the Mighty Ducks'
coaching job, can't resist taking swipes at the Ducks.</LD>
<LD>   He aimed his latest jab at the Disney-owned club, which hosts the
Kings today at the Arrowhead Pond, when asked about the Ducks'
off-season moves, including the free-agent signings of Adam Oates,
40, and Fredrik Olausson, 35.</LD>
<LD>   "We signed some talented guys too," Murray said before Saturday
night's 5-4 exhibition victory over the San Jose Sharks at San Jose.
"They're just about 15 years younger than some of the guys the Ducks
signed."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Enforcer Ken Belanger, who played in 43 games last season, might
not be ready for the start of the regular season for the Kings
because of a back injury, Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   Fellow tough guy Ryan Flinn, who made a strong impression in 10
games with the Kings last season while Belanger was sidelined because
of a broken thumb, is sitting out because of a back strain.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Kip Brennan, 22, is filling the enforcer role.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Though he does not participate in contact drills, Ian Laperriere
has been practicing with the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   The feisty forward, who had abdominal surgery last month, is
expected to be in the lineup for the season opener Oct. 9 against the
Phoenix Coyotes.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Crowe</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   All eyes will be on Joffrey Lupul, Anaheim's No. 1 draft pick in
June, tonight. Lupul, who missed the first part of training camp
while recovering from a hairline fracture in a lower vertebra, will
skate on the Ducks' third line centered by Matt Cullen.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Regular-season individual game tickets for the Ducks will go on
sale today at the Arrowhead Pond at 2 p.m. Tickets will also be
available at all Ticketmaster locations and by calling (877)
945-3946. Fans who purchase a regular-season ticket at the Pond will
receive a free ticket for tonight's exhibition.</TE>

<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The envelopes please ...</LD>
<LD>   MOST VALUABLE PLAYER</LD>
<LD>   National League: 1. Barry Bonds, San Francisco; 2. Albert Pujols,
St. Louis; 3. Shawn Green, Dodgers.</LD>
<TE>   American League: 1. Alfonso Soriano, New York; 2. Alex Rodriguez,
Texas; 3. Miguel Tejada, Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Comment: It's time to give Bonds permanent possession of the NL
award and be done with it.</TE>
<TE>   As he drives the Giants into the playoffs, winning a batting title
at 38, shattering Ted Williams' record for on-base percentage and
breaking his own mark for walks in a season, he has proven again that
no hitter--active or otherwise--has had greater influence on pitching
and managerial decisions.</TE>
<TE>   In the AL, there has seldom been a more difficult decision.</TE>
<TE>   The field is deep, the MVP rules ambiguous.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the voter instructions say, "There is no clear-cut
definition of what Most Valuable means. It is up to the individual
voter to decide who was the Most Valuable Player in each league to
his team. The MVP need not come from a division winner or other
playoff qualifier."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, that last sentence implies that it would be fine to
select Rodriguez, and it would be. He is the best player in baseball,
the runaway leader in home runs, runs batted in and total bases. He
also is valuable to the Rangers in the field, at bat, and in the
dugout and clubhouse, but there is also something to the fact that
his team finished last.</TE>
<TE>   Although that might not matter in a season when the MVP
competition wasn't so deep, when there weren't so many players making
valuable contributions to winning teams, the fact that there are
weighs against picking a player from a losing team. Yes, it might be
more difficult playing for a loser, but the ramifications and
consequences on a per-game basis aren't as severe.</TE>
<TE>   In staying with Soriano, who was also my midseason MVP, I am sure
to raise complaints. Some will say that it is impossible to single
out one Yankee when Jason Giambi and Bernie Williams are also having
MVP-caliber seasons. However, Giambi struggled early, Williams was
injured early, and Soriano has been the catalytic constant on a team
with more than 100 wins, a team that was looking for just such a
catalyst after the departures of Paul O'Neill, Tino Martinez and
Scott Brosius.</TE>
<TE>   Soriano leads the AL in runs, hits, extra-base hits and stolen
bases--a sweep achieved only twice before--may still become only the
fourth player to hit 40 home runs and steal 40 bases in the same
season, is batting .330-plus with runners in scoring position and has
the most homers and total bases of any AL player who is going into
the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   A-Rod supporters need not apologize. Neither do I.</TE>
<TE>   CY YOUNG</TE>
<TE>   National: 1. Randy Johnson, Arizona; 2. John Smoltz, Atlanta; 3.
Curt Schilling, Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   American: 1. tie between Pedro Martinez, Boston, and Barry Zito,
Oakland; 3. Derek Lowe, Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Comment: Call it the easy out, but I could not separate Martinez
and Zito. Martinez dominated more categories, but Zito had more wins
and was pivotal to the surging A's in the second half, when he went
11-2 with a 1.74 earned-run average while also posting an overall
record of 12-1 in starts that followed an Oakland loss.</TE>
<TE>   A Cy Young Award would be the fourth for Martinez, who won one in
the National League, and the fourth consecutive for Johnson. It would
further enhance the perceptions that Johnson's free-agent signing by
the Diamondbacks ranks as one of the best ever, and that the trade in
which the Dodgers sent Martinez to Montreal ranks as one of the worst
ever.</TE>
<TE>   ROOKIE OF THE YEAR</TE>
<TE>   National: 1. Jason Jennings, Colorado; 2. Austin Kearns,
Cincinnati; 3. Brad Wilkerson, Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   American: 1. Eric Hinske, Toronto; 2. Rodrigo Lopez, Baltimore; 3.
Jorge Julio, Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Comment: It is best to put pitchers and position players in their
own categories, but a significant number of pitchers has won the
rookie award in either league and it is difficult to ignore Jennings'
nine wins in Coors Field and 16 overall, the most by a rookie pitcher
since Tom Browning won 20 in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   The AL award could also go to a pitcher, since Lopez won 15 games
for the pathetic Orioles after San Diego gave up on him and Julio
saved 25 for the Orioles, but Hinske's 23 homers and 82 RBIs as the
Blue Jays' third baseman are as impressive as his Gold
Glove-in-waiting defense.</TE>
<TE>   MANAGER OF THE YEAR</TE>
<TE>   National: 1. Tony La Russa, St. Louis; 2. Bobby Cox, Atlanta; 3.
Jim Tracy, Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   American: 1. Mike Scioscia, Angels; 2. Art Howe, Oakland;. 3. Ron
Gardenhire, Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   Comment: Scioscia convinced a team that finished 41 games out of
the division lead last year and started 6-14 this year that it had
championship capability and had to focus only on one game at a time.</TE>
<TE>   Now the Angels are about to appear in the playoffs for the first
time in 16 years.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it's a tough competition.</TE>
<TE>   Howe's A's won the AL West title after losing Giambi, Johnny Damon
and Jason Isringhausen. Gardenhire's Twins won in the AL Central by
shrugging off the specter of contraction and, like the A's, had one
of baseball's lowest payrolls.</TE>
<TE>   La Russa kept his Cardinals focused in winning the NL Central
title despite the death of Darryl Kile and injuries that forced him
to use 14 starting pitchers.</TE>
<TE>   EXECUTIVE OF THE YEAR</TE>
<TE>   National: Dan Evans, Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   American: Billy Beane, Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Comment: Locked into inflexible and immovable contracts, Evans
found ways to add Odalis Perez, Brian Jordan, Omar Daal, Dave
Roberts, Cesar Izturis, Kazuhisa Ishii, Paul Shuey, Paul Quantrill,
Hideo Nomo and Tyler Houston, among others, helping the Dodgers stay
in playoff contention until the final weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Beane performed his usual sleight of hand, enabling the
small-market A's to overcome the loss of Giambi, Damon and
Isringhausen. He struck quickly with the additions of Billy Koch and
David Justice, among others, then persuaded his reluctant owners to
expand the midseason budget to add Ray Durham and Ricardo
Rincon--both pivotal to the 20-game winning streak that swept the A's
into first place.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the A's, Twins and even the $60-million Angels represent a
strong rejection of the competitive-disparity lament as they head
into the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Bud Selig would call it an aberration. Others would call it good
management.</TE>

<KH>AROUND THE HORN</KH>
<HD>Firing Season About to Begin</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSS NEWHAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The shakeup of Bud Selig's Milwaukee Brewers, with General Manager
Dean Taylor fired, Wendy Selig-Prieb moved from club president to
board chairman and respected Milwaukee attorney and civic leader
Ulice Payne hired as president, was just the first of the winter
storm clouds--in Milwaukee and elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   A conservative estimate is that 10 of the 30 major league managers
may not be back next year, and there may be several changes among
general managers as well.</LD>
<LD>   "It could be a real carousel," said Buck Showalter, who, along
with Bob Melvin, the Arizona Diamondbacks' bench coach, is considered
a possible replacement for Jerry Royster, who was hired by the
Brewers as interim manager after the firing of Davey Lopes and is
certain to have seen his last sausage race at Miller Park. Royster
could be fired by the end of business today.</LD>
<TE>   Among other interim managers whose positions seem in jeopardy are
Bruce Kimm with the Chicago Cubs, Luis Pujols with the Detroit Tigers
and Joel Skinner with the Cleveland Indians.</TE>
<TE>   A second straight season of 100 or more losses for the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays could also claim Hal McRae, although shortstop Chris Gomez
says there's not much a new manager could change, considering "we're
just not very good."</TE>
<TE>   In addition:</TE>
<TE>   * The Boston Red Sox, who still had a wild-card shot until
Wednesday, may fire Grady Little, despite their high-profile search
last spring.</TE>
<TE>   * The ongoing fallout of a tumultuous and underachieving season
may have convinced New York Met owner Fred Wilpon that a
housecleaning is needed, starting with Manager Bobby Valentine.</TE>
<TE>   * The uncertain status of the Montreal Expos affects Frank
Robinson, who initially agreed to manage for one year and now says he
is willing to stay.</TE>
<TE>   * The Texas Rangers have said that Jerry Narron will open next
season as the manager, but Narron plans to leave for his North
Carolina home after today's final game and will not participate in
postseason meetings, indicating he is convinced that General Manager
John Hart plans to make a change.</TE>
<TE>   * The San Francisco Giants have begun to address the expiring
contract status of General Manager Brian Sabean, but Peter Magowan,
the managing general partner, insists he will leave the decision on
Manager Dusty Baker's expiring contract to Sabean, or whoever the GM
is.</TE>
<TE>   No one is safe, of course, if Baker isn't, but then Baker might
feel it is time to leave on his own, giving up his popularity and
family connections in the Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   How that and the rest of it plays out is uncertain, but the
changes may not end at the manager's office.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Port, who was the Angels' general manager when they last went
to the playoffs, could be out as Boston's interim general manager,
replaced, perhaps, by Sabean or J.P. Ricciardi, the Toronto Blue
Jays' general manager.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Phillips could pay the price for the Mets' combustion,
replaced, perhaps, by Omar Minaya, his former assistant and now
Montreal GM.</TE>
<TE>   Syd Thrift could be out as the Baltimore Orioles' GM, replaced,
perhaps, by ... well, hasn't owner Peter Angelos long been serving as
de facto GM?</TE>
<TE>   The Two Bills</TE>
<TE>   The playoff-bound Angels are as much Bill Bavasi's team as Bill
Stoneman's, as much Stoneman's as Bavasi's. Each acknowledges the
other's role in the team's construction.</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Stoneman referred to the foundation laid by
predecessor Bavasi and his scouting director, Bob Fontaine Jr., and
said:</TE>
<TE>   "The bulk of this team was here. Whether it was Bill Bavasi or Bob
Fontaine, they made some pretty good decisions before Mike [Scioscia]
and I ever got here.</TE>
<TE>   "They made some pretty good decisions that have really paid off
now."</TE>
<TE>   Colleague Bill Plaschke charted Fontaine's contributions in his
Friday column. Both Fontaine and Bavasi left after the 1999 season
rather than implement the wholesale changes that then-club president
Tony Tavares desired.</TE>
<TE>   Among Angel regulars, Garret Anderson, Darin Erstad, Troy Glaus,
Tim Salmon and Bengie Molina are all products of the Bavasi
administration.</TE>
<TE>   So are starting pitchers Jarrod Washburn, Ramon Ortiz and John
Lackey.</TE>
<TE>   So are relievers Troy Percival, Scott Schoeneweis, Scot Shields,
Al Levine and Francisco Rodriguez. So are the valuable Orlando
Palmeiro and Shawn Wooten.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Stoneman used several Bavasi/Fontaine players in
trades, acquiring Adam Kennedy in the Jim Edmonds deal, Brad Fullmer
for Brian Cooper, Alex Ochoa for Jorge Fabregas and Kevin Appier for
Mo Vaughn, who was Bavasi's biggest free-agent signee.</TE>
<TE>   In further enhancing what he inherited, there is no minimizing the
shrewd eye Stoneman and staff have displayed while working under a
restrictive budget.</TE>
<TE>   David Eckstein and Ben Weber were picked off waivers.</TE>
<TE>   Brendan Donnelly and Benji Gil were signed as minor league free
agents.</TE>
<TE>   Aaron Sele, Dennis Cook and Scott Spiezio came as major league
free agents.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill and his guys have added some fine pieces that have worked
perfectly," said Bavasi, now director of player development for the
Dodgers and reluctant to comment on the Angels' success.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm proud of the time we spent there, happy and thrilled for the
guys who have become veterans on that team, but I don't think it's
right for me to say that I take pride in what the Angels have done
this year because it's not my team. Bill and his guys have done a
tremendous job. It's their team."</TE>

<HD>Clark Takes Servite to New Heights</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Trevor Clark is so tall that water polo teammates at Anaheim Servite
High call him "Lurch" after the monster-like character from the 1960s
television series, "The Addams Family." They tell him he's going to
attend the fictional Lurch State University.</LD>
<LD>   At 6 feet 7 1/2 and 205 pounds, Clark, walking across a pool deck,
draws stares from people who see him for the first time because it's
rare to find someone with his height playing water polo.</LD>
<LD>   Clark has run into only one player close to his size, and that was
a 6-9 Russian teenager this summer.</LD>
<TE>   High school athletes 6-7 or taller usually end up playing
basketball, volleyball or football.</TE>
<TE>   But Clark's sports future was influenced at an early age by his
mother, Suzette, a swim instructor and coach. Clark started swimming
when he was 5. He tried other sports but always enjoyed the
competition in the pool. When he arrived at Servite as a freshman,
Coach Jim Sprague taught him water polo.</TE>
<TE>   Between his freshman and junior years, he grew from 6-1 to 6-7.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely an advantage," Clark said of his height.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, Clark developed into one of the top college prospects
in the nation. He started for the U.S. junior national team that
earned a silver medal at the Junior Pan American Games in Boca Raton,
Fla.</TE>
<TE>   His size and potential helped get him selected for the team, but
steady improvement proved he deserved a spot.</TE>
<TE>   "I was the youngest on the junior team, so at the beginning, I had
a confidence problem that I couldn't play with these guys," he said.
"But as the summer panned out, I was just as good. I could go the
whole 28 minutes if I needed to. I have 200% more confidence than I
did before."</TE>
<TE>   Similar to a tall center in basketball who's expected to excel,
Clark said he is dealing with the high expectations to be "this god
in the water."</TE>
<TE>   But Clark wasn't even the first- or second-best player on his
Servite team last season, when he scored 74 goals and was a two-meter
defender. The Friars were upset by Anaheim Esperanza in the Division
II quarterfinals, leaving him frustrated and angry.</TE>
<TE>   "I decided to make it my life journey to make sure it didn't
happen again," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He started training for his senior year without taking any break,
jumping into the pool two days after the Esperanza defeat.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to stop," he said. "I wanted to keep going. I
wanted it to be a continual process and see where it led me."</TE>
<TE>   He turned 17 on Sept. 3 and was featured as Sports Illustrated's
Old Spice Athlete of the Month for August.</TE>
<TE>   Clark could end up causing as many headaches for coaches trying to
devise a strategy to defend him as a 7-footer does in basketball. He
has been moved to the two-meter man position, where he's stationed in
front of the goal. Deflecting his shots is not easy.</TE>
<TE>   "One person isn't going to stop Trevor," Sprague said. "He's too
big."</TE>
<TE>   All of the nation's top collegiate water polo programs have
expressed interest in Clark, who says USC, California and UCLA are
the leaders in the recruiting competition.</TE>
<TE>   When he's not in a pool or at school, he probably can be found
shaping surfboards in his garage.</TE>
<TE>   And he's still growing.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'll top out at 6-9," he said.</TE>

<HD>Walter, Arizona State Leave No Doubt, 65-24</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's no longer a quarterback question at Arizona State.</LD>
<LD>   Andrew Walter passed for 414 yards and five touchdowns in his
first start this season, leading the Sun Devils past Stanford, 65-24,
Saturday at Tempe, Ariz.</LD>
<LD>   Walter, a sophomore who started in two losses last year, earned
the starting job by rallying the Sun Devils (4-1, 1-0 in conference)
to victories in their last two games.</LD>
<TE>   This time, he had them leading 38-16 at halftime. Arizona State
had its highest Pac-10 point total and Walter's five touchdowns
passes tied Jeff Krohn (2000) for third best in school history.</TE>
<TE>   Cornell Canidate had a nine-yard touchdown reception and ran for
touchdowns of one, eight and seven yards, validating Arizona State
Coach Dirk Koetter's decision to give the freshman his first start.
Canidate had 77 yards in 15 carries as the Sun Devils won their
fourth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Casey Moore scored on a two-yard pass play from Chris Lewis and a
68-yard run for Stanford (1-2, 0-1). The Cardinal outscored the Sun
Devils, 130-65, in their previous three games.</TE>
<TE>   No. 13 Washington 41, Idaho 27--Cody Pickett threw for 438
yards--the second-most in Washington history--and three touchdowns as
the Huskies (3-1) defeated the Vandals (1-4) at Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Pickett completed 32 of 44 passes without an interception, one
week after throwing for 404 yards in a 38-7 victory over Wyoming. He
holds the school record of 455 yards, which he set last season.</TE>
<TE>   Washington suffered a setback after standout receiver Reggie
Williams didn't return after spraining his left knee early in the
second quarter. The severity of the injury wasn't immediately known.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 14, North Texas 9--Gary Love ran back a blocked field goal
65 yards for a touchdown on the last play of the first half to help
the Wildcats (3-1) defeat the Mean Green (1-4) at Tucson.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Bell had a 14-yard touchdown run for Arizona, which ran out
the last 2:44 after missing its fourth field-goal attempt with 4:58
left.</TE>

<HD>St. Louis' Perspective Is Defective</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They are panicking in St. Louis, melting down in Missouri, all
because the hometown Rams have lost their first three regular-season
games, two of them by a touchdown or less.</LD>
<LD>   We'd like to tell them all to get a grip, except we have learned
from history and know that St. Louis is too ploddingly literal when
it comes to this stuff. Within the last decade, St. Louis has gotten
its grip around too many of our favorite things: Jim Edmonds, Mark
McGwire, Wayne Gretzky, a once-proud football team known as the Rams.</LD>
<LD>   Clearly, this is a city that lost all sense of decency long ago.</LD>
<TE>   Now, just because Kurt Warner throws a few wobblers in September,
it's a city that has also lost its mind.</TE>
<TE>   From here to the banks of the Mississippi River, you can hear the
beached wail:</TE>
<TE>   Martz has lost it! He's nothing without Vermeil!</TE>
<TE>   (Even though Mike Martz went 14-2 last season with a team that
outscored opponents, 503-273. Dick Vermeil, last we checked, still
thinks he can return to the Super Bowl with the Kansas City Chief
roster and Trent Green as his quarterback.)</TE>
<TE>   Warner's arm is dead! His shoulder's shot! His confidence is gone!
His psyche was shattered by the loss to New England! Send in Jamie
Martin! Warm up Marc Bulger!</TE>
<TE>   (Warner is playing with a bad thumb but doesn't like talking about
it because, unlike other Ram quarterbacks we have known, he doesn't
like to make excuses. The man has been to two Super Bowls, won two
MVP trophies in three years. Think you can spare him a few more
quarters? Jamie Martin? We caught Martin's act, just before the Rams
packed up the moving vans. You don't want to go there. Marc Bulger?
Four syllables, St. Louis: T.J. Rubley.)</TE>
<TE>   We can't win without James Hodgins! He was the real MVP of this
team!</TE>
<TE>   (James Hodgins is a blocking back. He is sidelined with a foot
injury. He should be back some time in October. Marshall Faulk missed
two games to injury last season. The Rams still made it to the Super
Bowl.)</TE>
<TE>   We never should have let Az Hakim go! We can't spread defenses
anymore!</TE>
<TE>   (The Rams did not re-sign Hakim during the off-season because he
dropped a lot of passes. He has since moved on to Detroit. The Lions,
with Az Hakim spreading defenses, are also 0-3.)</TE>
<TE>   We never should have let Ryan Tucker go! John St. Clair is a bust!</TE>
<TE>   (You might have a point there. St. Louis' offensive line hasn't
been the same since Tucker, in a historic end-around, became a Ram
who moved to Cleveland.)</TE>
<TE>   Take a deep breath, St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams might not be the juggernaut of '99, but this team has
something that team never had: four division games against Arizona
and Seattle. Does anyone really believe the Rams, even in their
current discombobulated state, are going to finish behind the
Cardinals and the Seahawks in the new (and devolved) NFC West?</TE>
<TE>   That leaves the Rams chasing San Francisco for first place and the
playoffs. The Rams trail the 2-1 49ers by two games, but have two
games against the 49ers to erase that gap. The 49ers have issues of
their own--generally speaking, the passing game; if you'd rather get
personal, Terrell Owens.</TE>
<TE>   Six reasons why the Rams aren't done yet:</TE>
<TE>   1. The schedule. The Rams were hit hard right from the start, with
road games at Denver and Tampa Bay, teams that figure to contend for
the Super Bowl. Their only home game so far was against the New York
Giants, who still know how to tackle and were amped to end a
five-game losing streak against the Rams. The schedule eases
today--home game against Dallas--and after rivalry games against the
49ers and Raiders, the Rams get a five-game run against Seattle,
Arizona, San Diego, Chicago and Washington.</TE>
<TE>   2. Thirteen games to go. It's a long season, and teams do hit down
cycles. The '99 Rams lost back-to-back games, in midseason, and went
on to win the Super Bowl. The '00 Rams lost three in a row, in
November, and still finished 10-6 to make the playoffs--and might
have reached another Super Bowl had the much-lamented Hakim not
fumbled that fourth-quarter punt in New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   3. Realignment. From the Ram perspective, the NFL shuffled its
divisions just in the nick of time. Old NFC West rival New Orleans is
3-0 after three games against 2001 playoff teams. Atlanta has Michael
Vick, meaning Atlanta has a chance to win every game it plays.
Carolina won't be undefeated after today, but the Panthers are not
the pushovers of seasons past. By swapping six games against that
threesome for four against the Cardinals and the Seahawks--a.k.a. A
Flock of Seagulls--the Rams definitely traded up.</TE>
<TE>   4. He's Kurt Warner, not Jim Everett. Last week, a columnist for
the St. Louis Post-Dispatch actually wrote: "If Warner's stunning
decline continues, he'll soon be compared to Jim Everett."</TE>
<TE>   Did I mention there is widespread panic in St. Louis? Warner will
never, ever be compared to Everett--note to St. Louis: We were
there--until/unless he: a) returns his two league MVP awards to the
NFL office; b) returns his Super Bowl MVP trophy too; c) persuades
everyone to ignore the all-time NFL quarterback ratings, which list
Warner No. 1, ahead of Steve Young and Joe Montana and every other
quarterback who has played the game; d) sacks himself on national
television with another trip to the Super Bowl on the line; e) sacks
a talk-show host on national television after the host derisively
calls him "Chris Everett," a slanderous insult to a great and gutty
tennis player who never sacked herself in the big match against
Martina Navratilova; f) ends a season by losing the last 10 games, as
Everett did in 1991; g) loses his job to T.J. Rubley; h) loses so
many games that home attendance dwindles, giving the team an excuse
to look elsewhere, essentially escorting the Rams out of town.</TE>
<TE>   5. The Rams have already moved. Georgia Frontiere and John Shaw
got what they wanted, the sweetheart deal of a lifetime, in 1995.
There's no more incentive for them to run the team into the ground
and kill off fan interest, unless, perhaps, Pottsville is promising a
new stadium. This time, it actually makes financial sense to keep the
team competitive. Although the whole Eric Crouch affair--burning a
third-round pick on a big-name-without-a-position who retires after
the exhibition season--sounds suspiciously like vintage Anaheim Rams,
circa 1990.</TE>
<TE>   6. Rams-49ers. The division championship will hinge on two games:
Oct. 6, Rams at 49ers, and Dec. 30, 49ers at Rams. The Rams have
swept the last three season series with the 49ers, which makes
today's home game against Dallas so important. A victory over the
Cowboys sends the Rams to San Francisco with some regained swagger.</TE>
<TE>   A loss today to the Cowboys?</TE>
<TE>   In that case, St. Louis, you will be granted unconditional
permission to panic.</TE>

<LD>There was a chill at kickoff, a black sky at halftime, spitting rain
in the third quarter, soggy grass at the finish.</LD>
<LD>   Quick enough to stop Oregon State, the USC defense also proved
powerful enough to chase away summer, filling the Coliseum on
Saturday with the smell of wet leaves and old-time football.</LD>
<LD>   Pete Carroll football.</LD>
<TE>   Scare-the-bejabbers-out-of- the-Pac-10 football.</TE>
<TE>   One day into their march toward the Rose Bowl, the Trojans have
made it clear that theirs will not be a march, nor will it smell much
like roses.</TE>
<TE>   Their 2002 season will be about pushing, grabbing, chasing,
tackling.</TE>
<TE>   From Student Body Right to Student Body Slam.</TE>
<TE>   Just ask Oregon State, which hobbled away Saturday night with a
bag of ice on the left hand, a limp in the left ankle, and a darting
look in the eyes.</TE>
<TE>   And that was just the quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know where to start," Derek Anderson said after his team
was finished in a 22-0 victory by the Trojans. "I'm pretty sore."</TE>
<TE>   Start with the Trojans giving up 131 yards to a team that had been
averaging 500 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Continue with the Beavers converting one third down in 15
attempts.</TE>
<TE>   How about USC's 14 tackles for losses?</TE>
<TE>   Or that the Beavers crossed midfield only three times?</TE>
<TE>   "We can't have days like that," Anderson said in disbelief. "We're
too good of an offense to go out there and not move the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Expect that tenor to be echoed by Pacific 10 football types
everywhere today when they read the newspapers and digest the
Saturday results and make the comparisons.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State scored 65 points. Washington State scored 48.
Washington scored 41. Cal scored 38.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon State, the highest-flying offense in the highest-flying
conference, scored zilch?</TE>
<TE>   While this victory was as thick as a 6-foot-4, 280-pounder, its
face belonged to boyish Pete Carroll.</TE>
<TE>   This plan of attack is what the former NFL defensive guru has been
preaching since arriving here last year.</TE>
<TE>   This is the first time that eternally restless Trojan fans have
seen exactly what he is talking about.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just what I'd hoped for," said Carroll, who was given the
game ball by players who understood. "I wanted to build a team that
was different than everyone else in the conference. I wanted to build
the defense that could give us that separation."</TE>
<TE>   So far this year, he's done exactly that, the Trojans' momentary
freak-out against the Kansas State option notwithstanding.</TE>
<TE>   Holding Auburn, Colorado and Oregon State to 473 yards combined
will possibly raise a few hay-strewn eyebrows at the Pullman home of
their next opponent, Washington State.</TE>
<TE>   "Golly darn, we get that many yards in practice!"</TE>
<TE>   Oregon State didn't believe it either, even though the Beavers had
just endured three hours of it.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, their previous four games were against weaker
nonconference opponents, including Eastern Kentucky and Temple.</TE>
<TE>   But this is still a Dennis Erickson team that could have claimed a
national championship two years ago. And this was still the first
time anybody had shut out the Beavers in five years.</TE>
<TE>   "We're shocked," battered center Mike Kuykendall said. "To go from
500 yards a game to 131? To get beaten like that? Yeah, it's a
shock."</TE>
<TE>   Harder still for the Beavers to fathom was that it didn't happen
with gimmicks, but grit, an 11-man offense steamrollered by a
four-man rush.</TE>
<TE>   Said Erickson: "They really didn't do much blitzing. It was just
four guys. We really have to look at that."</TE>
<TE>   Said Carroll, smiling: "We have all those blitzes and all that
stuff. We just haven't had to use them much yet."</TE>
<TE>   The Trojan strength, nurtured by a Jimmy Johnson disciple named Ed
Orgeron, is a four-man line that is swarming quick.</TE>
<TE>   Shaun Cody and Kenechi Udeze on the left side. Mike Patterson and
Omar Nazel on the right.</TE>
<TE>   Remember the names. They echoed through the Coliseum on Saturday
like the strains of "Conquest."</TE>
<TE>   Late in the second quarter, USC was leading, 6-0, but Oregon State
was driving.</TE>
<TE>   Third down on the USC 30, Stephen Jackson was nailed for a
two-yard loss by Udeze.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth down, Anderson was sacked for a seven-yard loss by Udeze,
causing a fumble that was recovered by Cody.</TE>
<TE>   On the ensuing possession, the Trojans drove for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Two plays that changed the game.</TE>
<TE>   "They were really hungry for it today," Kuykendall said.</TE>
<TE>   From the moment safety DeShaun Hill cracked receiver Kenny Farley
on the third play of the game ... to the moment Cody whacked Anderson
and Nazel flattened Jackson on their last meaningful play in the
third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "This is all about being different," said Carroll, on a nasty day
that felt precisely that.</TE>

<HD>A Higher Calling</HD>
<DH>Undrafted but undaunted, Priest Holmes is a self-made NFL
star</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was no bed, no sofa, not a stick of furniture. Still, the
parents of Priest Holmes understood. Their only concern was that
their middle son was indeed chasing his dream, which happened to be
playing running back in the NFL.</LD>
<LD>   They didn't fret that he'd gone undrafted out of Texas, or that
his signing bonus from the Baltimore Ravens was a mere $2,500, or
that his chances of carving out a career in pro football were about
as slim as the meager pickings in his bachelor-style refrigerator.
Priest was living like a monk.</LD>
<LD>   "We went up and visited him and slept on the floor with him," said
his stepfather, Herman Morris, the only dad Holmes has ever known.
"He had blankets and pillows, linens, but no bed. Priest will
probably kill me for telling you this, but he used boxes and stuff as
tables. He had a small TV and a VCR to watch game films. It was very
humbling."</LD>
<TE>   Humility runs deep in Holmes, even now, five years removed from
his rookie season. He's the centerpiece of Kansas City's offense, led
the league in rushing last season, made the Pro Bowl, and is coming
off a 30-carry, 180-yard rushing performance in a 41-38 overtime loss
to New England--even though the defending Super Bowl champions knew
who was getting the ball down after punishing down.</TE>
<TE>   The day after the Patriot game, Holmes didn't stick around Kansas
City, collecting handshakes and backslaps. He did what he does every
week: boarded a plane for San Antonio to spend 24 hours with his
three sons and their mother, Stephanie, his longtime girlfriend.
Holmes has been trying to persuade her to move to Kansas City. So
far, she's resisted. In the meantime, the frequent-flier miles are
piling up.</TE>
<TE>   "He's very involved with their schoolwork," said Morris, who still
lives in San Antonio with his wife, Norma, where they raised their
family. "Their teachers all have Priest's number, and he goes by
their school quite a bit. His coming home every week has really
helped those kids; they were getting to be a real handful. He stays
until Tuesday night every week. He pretends he isn't sore, but I know
he is. I'm just really proud he's doing what he's doing."</TE>
<TE>   When the Chiefs play host to Miami today, the game will have
special meaning for Holmes and Dolphin running back Ricky Williams,
who were teammates at Texas for two seasons. Holmes was the
undersized mentor with the oversized heart, the senior who came back
from a devastating knee injury to have a 120-yard rushing game
against third-ranked Nebraska in the Big 12 championship game.
Williams, almost four years his junior, was the high school
All-American who went on to win the Heisman Trophy. The Longhorns
also had another outstanding back, Shon Mitchell, who was faster than
both.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty amazing how they worked us all in," Holmes said.
"Pretty much, we'd give Ricky the ball at the 20, and he'd probably
get an 80-yard run. If he didn't, we'd give the ball to Shon Mitchell
at the 50-yard line, and once we'd get down to the goal line, they
would give it to me."</TE>
<TE>   The three backs got along remarkably well, considering each would
have been the offensive focal point on just about any other team in
the country.</TE>
<TE>   "No one was greedy," said former Longhorn coach John Mackovic, who
now coaches at Arizona. "Clearly, Priest was the most unselfish of
them all."</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, that didn't carry much weight with NFL scouts. Holmes
was not drafted, an especially low point because his parents had
planned a celebratory barbecue that weekend and filled the house with
well-wishers. With each round, the mood grew darker.</TE>
<TE>   "There weren't any tears, but there were some sad expressions,"
Morris said. "There was some gloom. But those were close, supportive
friends. Today, those same people will tell you, they knew all along
it would work out. And they did."</TE>
<TE>   Holmes signed a free-agent deal with the Ravens in 1997 and bucked
long odds to make the team as a special-teams player and reserve
running back. When he was sure he had a job and those weekly
paychecks were rolling in, he sent for his oldest son, De'Andre, who
was 5 at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "Priest wanted to play an active role in [De'Andre's] life,"
Morris said. "He came to Stephanie with a plan, a proposal. He made
sure he had families around them who could help give them support."</TE>
<TE>   The boy lived with his father for the better part of two years,
going home to San Antonio for holidays and the summer months.</TE>
<TE>   "Having De'Andre up there helped Priest, also," Morris said. "It
balanced him. The kid had to be ready for school every day, do his
homework. Priest had a legitimate excuse not to go wild."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Holmes' career flourished. He burst into the national
consciousness in his second season, starting the first 13 games at
running back and finishing with 1,008 yards rushing and seven
touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   At 5 feet 9, 213 pounds, he was dwarfed by the other backs in the
AFC Central, bruisers such as Tennessee's Eddie George, Pittsburgh's
Jerome Bettis and Cincinnati's Corey Dillon. The Ravens felt they
needed to get bigger at the position--and they were shaken when
Holmes suffered another knee injury in 1999--so in 2000 they used the
No. 5 pick on Jamal Lewis, who is two inches taller and 15 pounds
heavier than Holmes.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though Priest knew Jamal was going to get his job, he
supported Jamal throughout the whole process," said Ernest Byner, the
longtime NFL running back who now is Baltimore's director of player
development. "Priest was teaching him, giving him knowledge and
information from Day 1. Not a lot of guys would do that."</TE>
<TE>   Although Holmes played in 2000, his role was greatly reduced.
Predictably, Lewis took over as the No. 1 back. After winning the
Super Bowl, the Ravens let Holmes go. It wasn't a popular decision
among Baltimore players.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a no-brainer to me that this guy was a great player," said
former Baltimore defensive back Rod Woodson, who now plays for the
Raiders. "He was a great worker, a family guy, everything that you'd
want as a player. I remember looking around the locker room and
everybody was saying the same thing: Wherever this guy goes, he's
going to do well."</TE>
<TE>   That was immediately apparent in Kansas City last season, when
Holmes gained 1,555 yards on the ground, joining Christian Okoye as
the only Kansas City player ever to lead the league in rushing.</TE>
<TE>   All the while, he made those weekly trips home to San Antonio. His
stepfather has put together a scrapbook, clipping every
Holmes-related newspaper and magazine story he can find. Holmes might
leaf through it someday. For the moment, though, he spends more time
looking through photo albums of his kids.</TE>
<TE>   "Priest doesn't even keep his Super Bowl ring," Morris said. "We
keep it here."</TE>
<TE>   Morris paused, then made a confession.</TE>
<TE>   "I slip that ring on every now and then," he said. "I've thought
about wearing it, but I haven't gotten that bold yet. I represented
Priest at a banquet when the school district honored him. He wasn't
able to go, so his mother and I went and accepted an award for him. I
felt like wearing that Super Bowl ring, but I decided against it. I
will sometime."</TE>
<TE>   A guy can dream.</TE>

<HD>Mickelson and Toms Become a Sweet Pair</HD>
<DH>Golf: Players who battled down the stretch in two 2001 tour
events make a world of difference for U.S. at Ryder Cup.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SUTTON COLDFIELD, England</DL>
<LD>It's not a Ryder Cup partnership you would have expected.</LD>
<LD>   If this is some kind of buddy act, it sure had the wrong kind of
beginning--last year's PGA Championship, when David Toms made a hole
in one Saturday, then laid up on the 72nd hole and sank a clutch putt
for par to beat Phil Mickelson by one shot.</LD>
<LD>   And they didn't appear to be the two parts of a potential team a
couple of months earlier at New Orleans, where Toms shot 63-64 on the
weekend and beat Mickelson by two shots.</LD>
<TE>   Friends, at least golf friends, are where you find them, and U.S.
Ryder Cup captain Curtis Strange found Mickelson and Toms at the
Belfry. And just in time too.</TE>
<TE>   The only group that Strange kept together all four matches,
Mickelson and Toms didn't win them all--they were 2 1/2--1 1/2 after
losing to Colin Montgomerie and Padraig Harrington in the better-ball
match Saturday afternoon--but they were solid.</TE>
<TE>   Said Montgomerie: "David Toms is a very underrated player and
Phil, he's a magician around the greens. We did very well to hold
them off."</TE>
<TE>   But there's a more important assessment. The Mickelson-Toms team
might represent an important juncture for the U.S. in the Ryder Cup,
because the alternate-shot and better-ball matches have been a major
problem for U.S. captains for the last two Ryder Cups.</TE>
<TE>   Points by partners have been hard to come by.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the U.S. trailed, 10-6, after two days.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, the U.S. trailed, 10 1/2-5 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Now, maybe that has turned around. Instead of going into today's
singles matches trying to come from behind, the U.S. is even with
Europe, 8-8.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the U.S. has outscored Europe, 7-5, since the first
better-ball matches Friday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson and Toms, who squeezed what looks like an important
half-point out of Friday afternoon's alternate-shot match with
Montgomerie and Bernhard Langer, scored another victory in Saturday
morning's alternate-shot match against Pierre Fulke and Phillip
Price. It wasn't exactly an overpowering performance, with one
birdie, an eagle and one bogey, but it got the job done, which is the
task that Mickelson and Toms had been assigned.</TE>
<TE>   "When we play together, for whatever reason, it's the right tempo,
the right rhythm, visually watching each other's shots," Mickelson
said. "I certainly prefer to be teamed together. I haven't had the
greatest success playing against him, so I like him on my team."</TE>
<TE>   Toms, a Ryder Cup rookie, made the team as a result of his
outstanding 2001 season when he won three times--at the PGA
Championship, at New Orleans and Kingsmill.</TE>
<TE>   Toms says he's a member of the Mickelson appreciation society.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, we're teammates and it's an absolute pleasure for me to
play with him. If I was going out to watch somebody play golf as a
spectator, he'd be the one."</TE>
<TE>   Simply because he had been able to beat Mickelson twice, head to
head, in tournaments, Toms said there is no truth to any suggestion
that they somehow carry a grudge.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that somebody is always trying to make a rift out of
something that's not there," Toms said. "For us, after the two times
that it happened, he shakes my hand, says 'Great going.' That's the
way it is. And this week we are teammates, and real close teammates."</TE>

<HD>Florida's Big Plays Top Kentucky</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a game full of big plays, mistakes and momentum shifts,
seventh-ranked Florida somehow came out with a 41-34 victory over
Kentucky, in a Southeastern Conference game Saturday at Gainesville,
Fla.</LD>
<LD>   Keiwan Ratliff returned an interception for a touchdown and scored
two points on a defensive conversion to help the Gators (4-1, 2-0
SEC) overcome their own mistakes and two special teams touchdowns
from Kentucky's Derek Abney.</LD>
<LD>   Florida's Rex Grossman threw for 375 yards and two
touchdowns--both to Taylor Jacobs--but on this day, hardly anyone
noticed. There were too many other crazy things happening.</LD>
<TE>   Florida's Matt Leach had two extra point kicks blocked. Punter
Sean Morton dropped a clean snap. Morton's replacement, Jason Hunter,
had a punt blocked. Earnest Graham lost a fumble that led to a quick
Kentucky touchdown. Abney had a 100-yard kickoff return for a
touchdown and returned a punt 49 yards for another score.</TE>
<TE>   Abney's punt return pulled Kentucky (4-1, 0-1) to within 39-34
with 5 minutes 24 seconds left, but when the Wildcats went for the
two-point conversion, Ratliff intercepted Lorenzen's pass and made it
to the end zone for a second time.</TE>
<TE>   Ratliff's return was good for two points and a seven-point lead
that the Gators were able to protect.</TE>
<TE>   No. 8 Georgia 41, New Mexico State 10--Damien Gary returned a punt
71 yards for a touchdown and the Bulldogs (4-0) also blocked a punt
for the second week in a row, winning at Athens, Ga. Gary also caught
a 20-yard scoring pass for Georgia. New Mexico State is 1-3.</TE>
<TE>   No. 11 Tennessee 35, Rutgers 14--Kelley Washington had seven
catches for 197 yards and a touchdown, all in the second half, as the
Volunteers stumbled early but won at Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   Rutgers, a 40 1/2-point underdog, took the lead when Nathan Jones
returned the opening kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown, prompting
loud boos from the crowd of 103,925. The Scarlet Knights (1-4), took
a 14-7 halftime lead before Washington's receptions sparked the
Volunteers (3-1).</TE>
<TE>   No. 22 Louisiana State 31, Mississippi State 13-- Domanick Davis
gained 295 all-purpose yards and scored two touchdowns at Baton
Rouge, La. Defending SEC champion LSU (3-1, 1-0) has beaten
Mississippi State (1-3, 0-2) in 10 of the last 11 games, including
six consecutive at Tiger Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Auburn 37, Syracuse 34--Carnell Williams ran for a career-high 202
yards and his eight-yard touchdown run in the third overtime gave the
Tigers (4-1) the win at Auburn, Ala. Williams scored on a six-yard
run in the second overtime, and his 40 carries were the second-most
in Auburn history. Walter Reyes sent the game to the third overtime
with a two-yard touchdown run for Syracuse (1-3).</TE>
<TE>   Alabama 30, Arkansas 12--Santonio Beard ran for 134 yards and
Shaud Williams had an 80-yard touchdown run on the game's first
offensive play as Alabama won at Fayetteville, Ark. Brodie Croyle had
285 yards passing and two touchdowns for the Crimson Tide (4-1, 1-0),
which gained 267 yards rushing against an Arkansas defense that
entered the game leading the nation in stopping the run. The
Razorbacks are 2-1, 0-1.</TE>
<TE>   South Carolina 20, Vanderbilt 14-- Corey Jenkins ran for 97 yards,
threw for 180 yards and scored the go-ahead touchdown for South
Carolina at Nashville. Vanderbilt (1-4, 0-3) has lost 12 consecutive
SEC games. The Commodores got the ball back in the last two minutes,
but South Carolina (3-2, 1-1) clinched the victory on Jonathan
Martin's interception with 29 seconds left.</TE>

<HD>No Ifs, Ands or Buts: Dodgers Didn't Do It</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As I stood watching the Choking Dogs on Saturday, and knowing how
they must feel about me, I realized Dr. Alan Weinberg and I have
something in common.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Weinberg said he wanted a picture of my prostate Friday, and I
hate having my picture taken because I don't like to smile, but he
said his scrapbook wouldn't be complete without it. Now I'll be
honest, I wasn't thrilled with the idea, but the daughter and the
bagger are going to want a lot of pictures taken at next summer's
wedding, so I figured it would be good practice grinning and baring
it.</LD>
<LD>   Now I never did very well in geography, so I had no idea where the
prostate is located, but I figured Dr. Weinberg probably did, so I
asked him how he wanted me to pose.</LD>
<TE>   He had me lie down on my left side, my head facing the wall and my
best side to the camera. Now I've never seen Playgirl, but I imagine
this is what the magazine will want when I start appearing daily on
ESPN next month, and Playgirl puts together its spread on
"broadcasting hunks."</TE>
<TE>   I got the feeling, however, Dr. Weinberg wasn't sure how to use
the camera, because I had no idea it would end up there--and I'll be
frank with you, the first thought that flashed through my mind was I
had just met Kevin Brown's best friend.</TE>
<TE>   At some point I heard the door open, a nurse's voice, and I got to
wondering, what if she's a Spark fan, has her own camera and by
nightfall these pictures are on the Web. Then I realized a Spark fan
probably wouldn't be interested in something like this, and I
relaxed.</TE>
<TE>   Now somebody else probably would have asked themselves, "How did I
ever get myself into this position?" But to be honest, it's not the
first time I envisioned something like this happening to me. Do you
remember those old Polaroid TV commercials with Mariette Hartley and
Bum Garner? I do, because I've always been afraid I might run into
Garner packing a camera, and I think I know what he'd do with it if
given the chance.</TE>
<TE>   Now there's no telling how long Dr. Weinberg would have had me
there had I not started screaming, "I got to see the Choking Dogs, I
got to see the Choking Dogs...."</TE>
<TE>   "My turn, Doc," I said, "to be a pain in the butt."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AND SO here I stand in Dodger Stadium--I fear never again being
able to sit, sickened and irritated by what I am hearing in the
Dodger clubhouse after the Giants have clinched the National League
wild-card berth, and vehemently disagreeing with Manager Jim Tracy's
assessment of the season.</TE>
<TE>   A night earlier the Dodgers had taken 10 innings to beat the minor
league team from San Diego, and catcher Paul Lo Duca said, "These
games we're winning, that takes a lot of guts."</TE>
<TE>   I think it takes a lot of guts to say something that stupid, but
that's what these guys have been hearing from their manager. In fact,
they believe there is something heroic in going 10-11 to finish the
season. Heroic is going into Dr. Weinberg's office, taking one's
medicine and not punching the guy in the nose.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't ask anything more of the guys in that room," Tracy
said, and if that's true, then Tracy is telling us this is no playoff
team because they don't have what it takes to make the playoffs. And
if this is no playoff team, then why does it have the third-highest
payroll in baseball?</TE>
<TE>   Tracy called it a "good year" for the Dodgers, just stopping short
of calling it a "great year," when I interrupted to say I thought it
was a season of failure: They didn't make the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "I disagree with you on that one," Tracy said, although the
Dodgers' record shows they didn't make the playoffs. " ... We don't
have anything to be ashamed of, and everything to be proud of."</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing noble in what the Dodgers have done. They played
the early part of the season beyond expectations, but then wasted it.
When it came time to answer the challenge, they choked--playing at
best mediocre baseball--38-35 since the All-Star break, 14-12 in the
final month of the season, and 42-40 since going 21 games over .500
in late June when Tracy boasted how good the Dodgers were.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers still haven't won a playoff game since 1988, and now
Tracy is telling the media, "We haven't lost; the Giants won. It's
just that simple."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy said he felt disappointed because his players worked hard
and didn't make the playoffs. Dr. Weinberg talked about his
9-year-old son and the cute things the little twerp likes to say,
while Dr. Weinberg adjusted the zoom lens on his camera. To both men
I say the same thing: "Enough already."</TE>
<TE>   "We won 92 games with a chance to win 93. It's a shame that's not
enough," Tracy said. "I wish there were some kind of special reward
for having this kind of year." I suggest the "We Came Close" award in
the Dodgers' name so the losers don't have to feel like losers.</TE>
<TE>   I understand Tracy's slobber, but the Dodgers choked. There's no
trying in baseball. It doesn't matter if a team wins 93 or 83 games
when it comes to making the playoffs. It's all about making the
playoffs, and the chance to win the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   I was going to say it's about time someone put a boot into the
Dodgers' behind and tell them what really counts, but I don't think
you'll ever hear me use that expression again.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Neil Oda:</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a disappointed Dodger fan and wrote this little poem, which
encompasses most of the 2002 season. I would really like it if you
could use it as 'Today's Last Word.' "</TE>
<TE>   It's a good thing you're already used to disappointment.</TE>

<HD>The Breeze Feels Good to Bruins</HD>
<DH>UCLA: Paus has big first half and special teams do job in
43-7 rout of San Diego State.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Air Paus sounds like an airline with frequent flight delays, but
Saturday it got UCLA to its destination--an untroubled place where
big plays are made on third down, points come easily and victory is
secure by halftime.</LD>
<LD>   A more pleasant location would be hard to imagine one week after
getting manhandled by Colorado and one week before beginning Pacific
10 Conference play.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA throttled San Diego State, 43-7, in front of 33,610 at
Qualcomm Stadium and will visit No. 23 Oregon State with a 3-1
record.</LD>
<TE>   "A lot of people didn't expect us to be in this position going
into Pac-10 play," said Coach Bob Toledo, who received a pat on the
back from UCLA Chancellor Albert Carnesale after the game.</TE>
<TE>   "After getting beat, we were on a mission, and we accomplished the
mission."</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins grounded the vaunted Air Craft attack of first-year
Aztec Coach Tom Craft while unleashing their own aerial assault under
the direction of sometimes pedestrian passer Cory Paus.</TE>
<TE>   The senior quarterback tossed touchdown passes of 37 yards to
Craig Bragg and 64 yards to Mike Seidman in a 26-point second quarter
that made the halftime score a lopsided 33-7.</TE>
<TE>   "The first half was really what the teams are," Craft said. "They
were better than us in every area."</TE>
<TE>   Playing behind a line missing injured senior tackle Mike Saffer,
Paus completed 12 of 21 for 216 yards before exiting for good in the
third quarter. Seidman, who has become increasingly vocal about
having the ball thrown to him, had six catches for 134 yards, both
career bests.</TE>
<TE>   The only complaint Paus lodged was about the firmness of the
dual-use field--especially the dirt infield that cut a swath from the
five-yard line to the 50 on one end.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so hard, I can't believe the Padres play baseball on it," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   But like his teammates, the quarterback got right back up after
taking a tumble. The Bruins, haunted by the memory of four
consecutive losses after a 6-0 start last season, were determined to
bounce back after falling hard to Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, it was San Diego State (0-5) that continued its tailspin,
not only remaining winless this season but winless in 18 tries
against UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Aztec officials are campaigning to gain entry into the Pac-10, but
the team must improve to get serious consideration. This was San
Diego State's 13th consecutive loss to the Pac-10.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Adam Hall came in leading the nation with 1,621 yards
passing, but he was held to 183 yards, completing 16 of 34. He had
two passes intercepted and was sacked four times.</TE>
<TE>   "It was challenging and I made some bad reads," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruin rallying cry on defense was "get off the field," which
the players screamed every time the Aztecs lined up on third down.
San Diego State converted only three of 15 third-down plays.</TE>
<TE>   "That was our plan, to fly around and make plays, especially on
third down," cornerback Matt Ware said. "We wanted to get off the
field and let our offense and special teams make plays."</TE>
<TE>   Early on, Hall tried to pick on Ware, who moved from free safety
to cornerback because he is taller than other Bruin corners. But Ware
stuck close to 6-foot-2 J.R. Tolver and 6-5 Kassim Osgood, Aztec
receivers who came into the game ranked No. 1 and No. 3 in the
nation.</TE>
<TE>   "They were saying to me, 'You think you're a corner, you're just a
safety,' " Ware said. "But I felt comfortable out there."</TE>
<TE>   Comfort threatened to become lethargy in the second half, but
Bruin energy was sparked by 40 reserves getting to play. The last
touchdown came on a 15-play, 71-yard drive in the fourth quarter
engineered solely by freshmen at the skill positions.</TE>
<TE>   The running game was strong throughout. Although starting tailback
Akil Harris struggled for the second game in a row, Manuel White
gained 76 yards in 14 carries and had a 29-yard run nullified by a
penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman quarterback Drew Olson replaced Paus for a series in the
second quarter after a safety caused by a poor punt snap by the
Aztecs extended the lead to 23-0. The Bruins punted after three plays
and the Aztecs promptly scored.</TE>
<TE>   Paus returned on the next possession, connecting with Seidman on a
deep post for the 64-yard touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the play that worked in spring and fall practice," Paus
said. "It's good to do it in a ballgame."</TE>
<TE>   The Bruin special teams were as high-flying as the offense and
defense. The first touchdown--a bruising four-yard run by White--came
two plays after middle linebacker Marcus Reese intercepted a pass at
the six.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA forced five turnovers, ranging from an interception by senior
cornerback Ricky Manning to a fumble recovery by walk-on defensive
lineman Matt Kocher, who was in the game because he grew up in San
Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Special teams, a weakness going into the season, contributed in a
variety of ways.</TE>
<TE>   * A punt by Nate Fikse was downed at the San Diego State
three-yard line midway through the first quarter and Reese made his
interception three plays later. Fikse, who had been either shanking
punts or booming them into the end zone, placed three inside the 20.</TE>
<TE>   * Jibril Raymo recovered a blocked punt in the end zone on the
first play of the second quarter for a 14-0 lead. Matt Clark blocked
the kick, swatting away the ball with his left hand.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm left-handed and I took the correct angle," Clark said. "I
thought that if I beat the dude in front of me I'd have a shot at a
block."</TE>
<TE>   * Chris Griffith made both of his field goal tries, including a
season-long boot of 46 yards. The senior has made three in a row
after missing three of four in the first two games.</TE>
<TE>   * Freshman Tyler Ebell broke a punt return for 53 yards and rushed
for UCLA's last touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "The kicking game really showed up," Toledo said. "We played well
in all phases. I'm pleased with the progress we've made."</TE>
<TE>   But more severe tasks are ahead. The Pac-10 schedule presents
immediate challenges, a visit to Oregon State followed by a home game
against Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a confidence-booster, just what we needed," Bragg said.
"It was good getting another nonconference game before going to
Oregon State."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO THE GAME</TE>
<TE>   Steve Henson's keys to the game and how the Bruins matched up:</TE>
<TE>   1. Don't let San Diego State receivers J.R. Tolver and Kassim
Osgood break runs after the catch: The Bruin secondary and
linebackers did an excellent job of swarming Tolver and Osgood and
gang-tackling them after catches. Tolver, the nation's leading
receiver, had only three catches for 30 yards. Osgood was better,
making 10 catches for 145 yards, but he never broke a long play. His
touchdown came on a 10-yard slant pattern.</TE>
<TE>   2. Stick to the game plan and generate a balanced attack rather
than getting into an aerial duel with the Aztecs: UCLA won both the
aerial duel and ground battle, establishing a solid running attack
behind burly Manuel White that churned out 197 yards before
subtracting 32 for five sacks. The Bruins passed for 238 yards, 30

<KH>UCLA NOTES</KH>
<HD>Seidman Reception Is Loud and Clear</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>It wasn't exactly Keyshawn Johnson saying give me the damn ball, but
UCLA tight end Mike Seidman let everyone know where he stood.</LD>
<LD>   Coaches, teammates, quarterback Cory Paus, even reporters.</LD>
<LD>   "I need to be a big-play guy," Seidman said.</LD>
<TE>   There wasn't any doubt about his role Saturday against San Diego
State after Seidman caught six passes for 134 yards--including a
64-yard touchdown--in the Bruins' 43-7 victory.</TE>
<TE>   So he spouted off a little bit. Everybody was happy enough to let
it go.</TE>
<TE>   "I would want the ball too, if I was a big horse like that," Paus
said. "I mean, Mike's an unbelievable talent. He does a good job in
one-on-one matchups. We try to take advantage of those any time we
can."</TE>
<TE>   That's what they did Saturday, and Seidman got rid of the
frustration he was feeling after last week's loss to Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate losing, is the main thing, and then when I can't
contribute as much as I would like to when we lose, I do get
frustrated," he said. "When we win, that makes me happier than
anything.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't want to be the guy being selfish, exactly. I'm not like
that. I'm not selfish at all. I mean, if I was selfish, you'd have
heard me complaining the last three years that they haven't been
throwing the ball a lot. But like I said, I want to win. This is my
senior year."</TE>
<TE>   Ever since Seidman came out of Westlake High rated as one of the
top 30 players in the nation, everyone expected big things out of the
6-foot-5, 254-pound tight end with the good hands and the open-field
running ability.</TE>
<TE>   But before this season, he had caught only 20 passes, and no more
than 12 in a season. Despite a lot of talk of going to the tight end
more, the Bruins didn't seem to--even this season, Seidman had no
more than three catches in a game despite being the clear No. 1 after
playing in a rotation in the past.</TE>
<TE>   "He was so highly touted," tight ends coach Gary Bernardi said. "I
always praise him for his ... I don't know if the word's
'graciousness' or what, but he was patient."</TE>
<TE>   That's not the same as being quiet, but Seidman managed to voice
his complaint without alienating the coaches and the team.</TE>
<TE>   "That's right. He's a polished guy," Bernardi said. "He was easy
to talk to. He and I have had many conversations about it, and I've
told him over the years, my job was to make him a complete player. I
don't want you to leave here just being a guy who can catch passes."</TE>
<TE>   San Diego State decided to play a lot of single coverage on
Seidman, and that--along with a couple of play-action plays designed
to get the ball to him--opened the doors.</TE>
<TE>   "If they man me up with a free safety, I'm a lot bigger than any
free safety," Seidman said. "Then, if I get the ball in the open
field, I might ramble a little bit. It's hard for guys to tackle a
guy my size."</TE>
<TE>   From the press box, an NFL scout watched.</TE>
<TE>   "He's definitely stepped up his senior season," the scout said,
citing team policy he not be identified. "He's intriguing. He's got
size, and all the intangibles for the position. But everybody uses
tight ends so differently. Some teams want a guy just to be a
blocker. He's a guy you want if you use the tight end in your passing
offense.</TE>
<TE>   "But this is one game. It's more important what he does against
the big teams."</TE>
<TE>   Seidman understands. There's a lot of season left.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hoping they saw that if they come to me, I can make something
happen," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mike Saffer's cough is Ed Blanton's gain.</TE>
<TE>   Saffer, a UCLA senior tackle, will be out three to five weeks
because of a broken rib that became excruciating Friday after he
coughed. He had informed trainers early in the week that he injured
the rib against Colorado last Saturday, but he practiced all week and
planned to play.</TE>
<TE>   Blanton, a 6-foot-9, 330-pound redshirt freshman making his first
start, filled the void admirably.</TE>
<TE>   "That guy did a great job," guard Eyoseph Efseaff said. "I kept
glancing over at him in the huddle to see if he looked OK. He was
fine."</TE>
<TE>   However, the loss of Saffer will be felt as the Bruins enter
Pacific 10 Conference play.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll miss Mike's leadership," Coach Bob Toledo said. "It's hard
to replace a four-year starter with a redshirt freshman. You lose
something, even when the redshirt freshman is as big as a house."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Saffer is not the only key lineman sidelined with an injury.
Defensive tackle Rodney Leisle changed into street clothes at
halftime and put a protective boot on his right foot.</TE>
<TE>   He might have developed a stress fracture, although a diagnosis
won't be made until today. "It's a bad situation," Leisle said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins have recovered all eight fumbles this season, including
three against San Diego State.</TE>

<HD>USC's D-fining Moment</HD>
<DH>College football: The defense allows only 131 yards as No.
18 Trojans shut out Oregon State, 22-0, in Pac-10 opener.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A rainbow emerged from the mist and arched briefly above the
peristyle end of the Coliseum late Saturday afternoon during USC's
Pacific 10 Conference opener against Oregon State.</LD>
<LD>   The only sight more radiant was the play of USC's defense, which
faded not even for a moment in the No. 18 Trojans' comprehensive 22-0
victory over the No. 23 Beavers before a crowd of 56,417.</LD>
<LD>   "We never stopped, we were relentless," USC defensive end Omar
Nazel said.</LD>
<TE>   One week after missing tackles and allowing uncontested pass
receptions in a loss at Kansas State, USC manhandled previously
high-powered Oregon State. The Beavers were shut out for the first
time since Nov. 15, 1997, when USC blanked them, 23-0, in Corvallis,
Ore.</TE>
<TE>   The loss also kept Oregon State winless at the Coliseum since
1960, a streak of 19 games.</TE>
<TE>   "USC kicked our rear ends--in a lot of phases," Oregon State Coach
Dennis Erickson said.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon State (4-1) came into the game averaging 47.5 points and
500 yards a game after victories over Eastern Kentucky, Temple,
Nevada Las Vegas and Fresno State.</TE>
<TE>   The Beavers had rolled past those overmatched opponents with a
big-play offense directed by sophomore quarterback Derek Anderson,
who had passed for 15 touchdowns, and sophomore tailback Steven
Jackson, who ranked seventh nationally with a 134-yard-per-game
rushing average.</TE>
<TE>   But USC (3-1), led by a ferocious defensive line, limited Oregon
State to 131 yards. The Beavers had only eight first downs and
converted only one of 15 third-down attempts.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a great day's work," said USC Coach Pete Carroll, who
has a six-game winning streak in conference games. "It didn't really
matter what we called. The guys up front were just tearing it up."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson completed only eight of 30 passes for 80 yards and was
sacked five times, twice by nose tackle Mike Patterson, once each by
Nazel and end Kenechi Udeze and once by several members of the unit.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything worked," Udeze said. "We put pressure on the
quarterback and we could see he was eager to get rid of the ball
because he knew we were coming."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, who rushed for 227 yards last week against Fresno State,
gained only 67 yards in 15 carries.</TE>
<TE>   "They were pretty much dominating the line of scrimmage. It was
pretty overwhelming," Jackson said. "I couldn't believe what was
going on."</TE>
<TE>   Neither could Erickson, whose team was penalized 12 times for 116
yards.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never had an offense that was so inefficient as we were
today," he said. "Give their defense credit. It was ugly."</TE>
<TE>   USC's offense did its part by controlling the ball. The Trojans
had possession for 37 minutes 55 seconds and produced 330 yards
against a Beaver defense that ranked 13th in the nation and first in
interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Carson Palmer completed 23 of 41 passes for 231 yards
and connected with freshman wide receiver Mike Williams on two
touchdown passes.</TE>
<TE>   Flanker Keary Colbert, who caught 11 passes last week against
Kansas State, was Palmer's favorite target again, catching six passes
for 67 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, tight end Alex Holmes and running back Sultan McCullough
each caught four passes against a Beaver secondary that was penalized
three times for pass interference.</TE>
<TE>   "They tried to get up in our receivers' faces, but we weren't
going to let them do that," said Palmer, who moved past Rodney Peete
to become USC's total offense leader. "We kept on trying to run by
them and we got them a couple times."</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans took a 13-0 halftime lead on second-quarter field
goals of 43 and 42 yards by Ryan Killeen and an 11-yard touchdown
pass from Palmer to Williams with 10 seconds left in the half.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer and Williams connected again for a touchdown with 4:45 left
in the third quarter on a 16-yard fade route to the left corner that
USC tried and failed to execute in its three previous games.</TE>
<TE>   "Practice finally makes perfect," said Williams, who came back
from a four-drop performance against Kansas State.</TE>
<TE>   Killeen added a 32-yard field goal with 10:34 left in the game and
the race for a shutout was on.</TE>
<TE>   "I looked up at the scoreboard and said, 'Hey, let's get a goose
egg,' " Udeze said. "The key was never letting up. We went hard from
the first play to the last."</TE>
<TE>   Udeze, Patterson, Nazel, defensive tackle Shaun Cody and nose
tackle Bernard Riley led the push and linebackers Mike Pollard,
Melvin Simmons and Matt Grootegoed swarmed in support.</TE>
<TE>   USC's untested secondary came through with solid performances from
cornerbacks Darrell Rideaux and William Buchanon and safeties DeShaun
Hill and Troy Polamalu.</TE>
<TE>   Buchanon, in particular, played well in his first start. The
redshirt freshman was targeted by Kansas State last week when he
replaced Ronald Nunn in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Nunn's season-ending knee injury thrust Buchanon into a starting
role and he did not flinch.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon State flanker James Newson caught only three passes, the
longest for eight yards. Wide receiver Shawn Kinter was limited to
one reception for 19 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought they were going to throw the ball downfield, but they
stuck with more intermediate routes," Buchanon said. "They never
really got going because the defensive line did such a good job."</TE>
<TE>   Next week the Trojans play at Washington State, the second step in
a challenging five-game run that also includes games against
California and Washington at the Coliseum and a trip to Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   Simmons, for one, isn't worried.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody in the Pac-10 has to get this film," he said. "It's
going to make everyone think a little bit earlier about SC."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO THE GAME</TE>
<TE>   Gary Klein's keys to the game and how the Trojans matched up:</TE>
<TE>   1. Prevent the big play: USC gave up a 31-yard pass reception to
tight end Tim Euhus but otherwise stifled any big-play opportunities
for the Beavers, who produced 29 plays that covered 25 yards or more
in their first four games. USC's defensive line pressured quarterback
Derek Anderson and the secondary broke up numerous passes with
athletic plays.</TE>
<TE>   2. Control the clock: The Trojans dominated possession,
controlling the ball for 37 minutes 55 seconds. Quarterback Carson
Palmer stuck with short and intermediate pass routes and Trojan backs
rushed for 99 yards without a fumble. The defense did its part as
well. Oregon State converted only one of 15 third-down attempts.</TE>
<TE>   3. Eliminate special-teams mistakes: Ryan Killeen made three of
four field-goal attempts and the only extra point he attempted.
Punter Tom Malone averaged 39.8 yards on six kicks and avoided the
shanks that would have provided Oregon State with good field
position.</TE>

<HD>This Time, Williams Gets a Grip in Victory</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>ROB FERNAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With each catch Saturday, Mike Williams slowly earned redemption.</LD>
<LD>   And won back his reputation.</LD>
<LD>   A week after dropping four passes in a loss to Kansas State,
Williams returned to the sure-handed form he showed throughout
training camp by catching two touchdown passes in USC's 22-0 victory
over Oregon State in a Pacific 10 Conference opener at the Coliseum.</LD>
<TE>   Williams, who finished with four catches for 62 yards, said the
key was staying positive and feeding off the encouragement of
teammates and coaches.</TE>
<TE>   "My teammates had confidence in me the whole time," he said. "I
forgot about last week, it was over. I worked hard in practice this
week, and they just called my number. I came through."</TE>
<TE>   After his miserable outing in the 27-20 loss at Kansas State, a
performance he described as not being able to "catch a cold in the
North Pole with an ice cube on my nose," Williams demonstrated why he
has drawn comparisons to Keyshawn Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-5, 215-pound freshman from Tampa, Fla., lived up to the
hype by making all the catches expected of a big-time receiver.</TE>
<TE>   He scored his first college touchdown on an 11-yard pass from
Carson Palmer with 10 seconds left in the first half, giving USC a
13-0 lead. Palmer bought time by eluding a rush before spotting
Williams alone in the deep right corner of the end zone. Strong
safety Lawrence Turner left Williams alone when it appeared Palmer
might run.</TE>
<TE>   "Carson did a good job of finding me," Williams said. "I had
mentioned to him earlier that [Turner] couldn't guard me. That's the
kind of quarterback he is. If you tell him what works, he goes with
it. I did what I didn't do last week. I caught it.</TE>
<TE>   "It was my first college touchdown, of course it felt great," he
added. "You don't know how long I've been waiting for that. I blew a
couple of opportunities last week and the week before that, so to
finally do it is a great feeling."</TE>
<TE>   On his second touchdown, Williams ran a fade route into the left
corner of the end zone and outjumped 5-11 cornerback Shamon Jamerson
to haul in a 16-yard touchdown pass from Palmer, giving the Trojans a
19-0 lead with 4:45 left in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "That's routine," Williams said. "We work on that in practice,
going up and getting the ball. Carson put it where he throws it in
practice."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer said despite what happened last week he never lost faith in
Williams. "He came out and did what we expected him to do," Palmer
said. "It didn't surprise me at all after the week he had last week."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Left tackle Jacob Rogers suffered a sprained right knee in the
second quarter and was replaced by Eric Torres.... Free safety
DeShaun Hill left the game with a shoulder injury.... Sandy Fletcher,
moved from safety to wide receiver for the game, sprained his left
ankle.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>LA MESA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>For months, the dark videos with the homemade feel beamed out over
the Web site: Bedraggled men beating each other to a pulp. A scruffy
street person ramming his head into a wall. Another poor fellow
ripping out his own tooth with a pair of pliers.</LD>
<LD>   But Bumfights.com offered only snippets. If you wanted a full dose
of street mayhem you had to pay for the full video--at $19.95 a pop.
By some accounts, 300,000 copies were sold.</LD>
<LD>   Howls of protest ensued. Advocates for the homeless demanded that
the young men promoting the video be prosecuted. Rep. Earl Blumenauer
(D-Ore.) called for a federal investigation.</LD>
<TE>   But the FBI said it didn't have jurisdiction and prosecutors in
Las Vegas--where Bumfights.com makes its home--saw no crime. It took
the persistence of a nurse in the San Diego suburbs--disgusted by the
repeated injuries to a homeless man who brawled for cash and 40-ounce
beers--to get authorities to crack down last week on the "bum
fights."</TE>
<TE>   Now three Las Vegas men--Zachary Bubeck, Michael Slyman and Daniel
Tanner--and Ryan McPherson, a La Mesa man who had long ago befriended
the homeless video stars, stand charged with a felony for allegedly
soliciting the violent acts.</TE>
<TE>   McPherson, 19, spent a couple of nights in jail before posting
$20,000 bail. He also faces four counts of witness dissuasion for
allegedly offering two of the street people $25,000 each not to talk
to police.</TE>
<TE>   Through their lawyers, the defendants insist that they did nothing
to provoke the edgy and often bloody scenes that unfold in their
video "Bumfights: A Cause for Concern Volume 1."</TE>
<TE>   According to one defense lawyer, the prosecution by La Mesa police
and the San Diego district attorney's office is illegally chilling
the burgeoning art of underground video.</TE>
<TE>   Friendship, Anger</TE>
<TE>   And the street-worn pugilists? They continue to soak in a sort of
lukewarm celebrity, saying they still consider the young video-makers
friends, but expressing anger that they were pushed so far and not
paid what they say they were promised.</TE>
<TE>   It was McPherson who first made contact with the homeless men who
would become video stars: Rufus Hannah, 47, and his best friend,
Donald Brennan, 53.</TE>
<TE>   McPherson was a sophomore at Grossmont High School in La Mesa when
he began filming them for fun, in addition to his normal subjects:
neighborhood skateboarders. He saw the men almost every day and had
them over for Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners, his attorney said.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last two years, Hannah and Brennan say, they were each
paid about $1,000 to appear in the videos--riding in a shopping cart
down a flight of stairs, setting their hair afire, jumping off roofs
and running head-first into glass signs and metal garbage bins.</TE>
<TE>   A boarded-up former Taco Bell in this San Diego suburb served as
the backdrop, as did several locations in Las Vegas, where the men
were taken to film more scenes.</TE>
<TE>   "When you never know where your next meal is coming from, you'll
do anything to get one," said Brennan, who was dubbed "Braindead" in
the videos. He spoke from his usual perch on a curb behind a gas
station in La Mesa, a beer by his side and a cigarette in his hand.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the occasional odd job, Brennan said, his only other
income is a monthly $306 check from Veterans Affairs.</TE>
<TE>   The duo said their pay varied. Sometimes they'd get 50 bucks.
Sometimes they were given a hotel room for the night and a pizza.
Always, they were handed a 12-pack of beer. And they say they were
each promised $50,000 that they never saw.</TE>
<TE>   But the payments came at a price. Hannah split his head open and
Brennan broke a leg and an ankle. They think the video producers went
too far, exploiting their thirst for beer and a little cash and
making increasingly demented requests.</TE>
<TE>   "Things started getting weirder and weirder," Brennan said. "He
wanted us to ram our heads into stuff and throw us off cliffs. He
knew if he got us inebriated he could take advantage of that."</TE>
<TE>   On one of their three trips to Las Vegas, Brennan and Hannah say,
they were plied with alcohol by the video makers and taken to a
tattoo parlor. Brennan emerged with "Bumfight" and a beer bottle
tattooed across his forehead. Hannah bears the same message across
his knuckles.</TE>
<TE>   Not Guilty Pleas</TE>
<TE>   Three of the defendants--McPherson, Bubeck, 24, and Tanner,
21--have pleaded not guilty. An attorney for Slyman, 21, filed a
challenge Friday asking the court to dismiss the soliciting charge.
Lawyers for all the defendants joined in arguing that the criminal
complaint is too vague as to who was assaulted and when the injuries
were caused.</TE>
<TE>   McPherson's attorney, Jan Ronis, said the teenager gave Brennan
and Hannah money out of sympathy, not to encourage them to perform or
fight for the camera.</TE>
<TE>   "They never encouraged, aided or abetted or solicited and clearly
never paid these guys to do anything illegal," Ronis said. "This
casts a chill on the underground movie industry or any documentary
industry."</TE>
<TE>   The video entrepreneurs are being punished merely because the
police did not like the content of the videos, Ronis claimed.</TE>
<TE>   The "Bumfights" video sold 300,000 copies over the Internet this
summer, according to published reports.</TE>
<TE>   At $19.95 apiece, La Mesa Police Lt. Raul Garcia said, that works
out to nearly $6 million.</TE>
<TE>   And that's not counting "Bumfights" stickers, T-shirts and hooded
sweatshirts--sporting Hannah's mug.</TE>
<TE>   Neither the defendants nor their lawyers will say how many of the
videos have been sold, although McPherson said in a brief telephone
interview that the sales have been greatly exaggerated and that the
rights to the video have been sold to another company.</TE>
<TE>   Friends of the homeless men and advocates want the video makers
punished for what they have done.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pitiful that you take people like this and you just misuse
them. It's like they're not human," said Barry Soper, who has often
hired the men to do odd jobs at his San Diego apartment complex.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Coalition to End Hunger &amp; Homelessness has been
collecting petitions to renew the call for a federal investigation.
They have more than 1,000 signatures so far, said the group's
executive director, Bob Erlenbusch.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Brennan and Hannah remain ambivalent about McPherson, saying
they don't want to see the young man they've known for years go to
jail.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to see it happen, not to a friend," Brennan said.
"But I feel like he went behind my back a little bit. We didn't
realize he was starting to make money off this stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Now a San Diego lawyer, Mark Quigley, has taken the transients'
case. He said he does not know yet how much the men will seek from
the video makers and their Las Vegas company, Indecline Productions.</TE>
<TE>   Fame of a Sort</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Hannah and Brennan have a new profile on the streets of
La Mesa--as demonstrated by the carload of tourists that approached
their curbside haunt last week.</TE>
<TE>   "You're famous, man. Mind if we take our picture with you?" Dean
Mayden of Kansas City, Mo., shouted to Brennan and Hannah.</TE>
<TE>   Turning to a reporter, Mayden said under his breath, "I just can't
believe they'd exploit people like this. It's definitely not right."</TE>
<TE>   Then Mayden pressed a $5 bill into Brennan's hand. He beamed and
turned to pose for a picture with the star of "Bumfights."</TE>

<LD>As his young son looked on, a 27-year-old man fatally stabbed his
ex-girlfriend before killing himself Saturday morning during a
court-ordered custody transfer in front of Santa Monica City Hall.</LD>
<LD>   The attack occurred about 9:50 a.m. in front of the couple's
6-year-old boy and a domestic violence counselor who was there to
supervise the exchange.</LD>
<LD>   The 21-year-old mother from Santa Clarita was stabbed several
times in the upper body. She was taken to a nearby hospital, where
she died. The father, a West Los Angeles resident, died at the scene
from self-inflicted knife wounds.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities are withholding their identities until their families
are notified.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica police officers, headquartered next to City Hall,

<HD>Davis Signs Bill on Forced Mental Care</HD>
<DH>Politics: 'Laura's law' will allow court-ordered treatment
of mentally ill. Governor also approves law allowing Segway scooters
on sidewalks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN and CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation Saturday permitting authorities to
treat severely mentally ill people against their will if judges
conclude that they cannot care for themselves and are likely to
become dangerous.</LD>
<LD>   The legislation represents a significant amendment to a state law
that protects the civil rights of mentally ill people, the
30-year-old Lanterman-Petris-Short Act. The act helped lead to the
emptying of state hospitals, which once housed more than 30,000
people but now care for 4,000. All but about 800 of those remaining
patients have committed crimes and were sent to institutions by
courts.</LD>
<LD>   The legislation, Assembly Bill 1421, establishes a hearing process
in which judges will determine whether the person has a history of
failing to comply with treatment and has, within four years,
exhibited "serious violent" behavior against others, or tried to hurt
himself or herself. The individual could be represented by a public
defender or a private lawyer.</LD>
<TE>   Davis said he expects the measure to help reduce homelessness,
hospitalization and involvement in the criminal justice system.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a critical step in helping the seriously mentally ill, as
well as their families," Davis said in a statement, predicting that
the bill would "help end the cycle of hospitalization, quitting
treatment and relapse."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' decision to sign the bill marked a victory for
Assemblywoman Helen Thomson (D-Davis) in her final year in the lower
house. Thomson tried for five years to win approval of the measure,
which was backed by law enforcement and many family members of the
mentally ill. Liberals in the Legislature, siding with some patients'
rights activists, had blocked its passage until this year.</TE>
<TE>   Thomson called the final version of the bill "Laura's law," named
for Laura Wilcox, a 19-year-old woman who worked at a Nevada County
mental health facility and was killed by a man whose mental illness
had gone untreated. It is similar to a New York law adopted in 1999
after a mentally ill man pushed 32-year-old Kendra Webdale into the
path of a subway train.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the compromise, counties will have the option of
participating, and would bear the costs. People would be treated in
expanded outpatient programs considered the "least restrictive"
necessary to achieve recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Under current law, people generally can be detained for 72 hours.
In extreme cases, they can be held for six months. The law provides
parents and other family members of adults who are mentally ill
little or no opportunity to intervene on the individual's behalf.
Thomson's bill will allow family members to testify at hearings.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it will have any impact on the population in state
hospitals," said Stephen W. Mayberg, director of the state Department
of Mental Health. "Our goal is to treat people not in institutional
settings."</TE>
<TE>   In other action Saturday, Davis vetoed seven bills, saying they
would cost local government tens of millions of dollars. The bills
generally sought to limit local officials' power to tailor benefits
for workers.</TE>
<TE>   "Under different economic circumstances," Davis said in a veto
message, "I would be supportive of many of these bills, as they
provide deserved benefits to workers who provide critical services to
California's citizens. However, local government budgets are already
under severe strain, which would be exacerbated if these bills become
law at this time."</TE>
<TE>   Davis signed legislation sponsored by the Segway Co. of
Manchester, N.H., to permit the company's futuristic, battery-powered
scooter to be operated on California sidewalks and in pedestrian
malls.</TE>
<TE>   The so-called "human transporter" is a self-balancing, two-wheeled
device designed to zip people at speeds as high as 20 mph. The
company intends to charge about $8,500 for the scooters and
advertises them as an environmentally friendly alternative to
walking.</TE>
<TE>   To operate its vehicles legally on sidewalks, Segway needed a
change in the law that would classify them as "pedestrian," a
characterization assailed by advocates for the blind. Otherwise, the
machines would have been listed as motor vehicles and be barred from
sidewalks. There is no age minimum for operating the machines.</TE>
<TE>   Starting March 1, the bill will give local governments the
authority to determine where and when the scooters can be operated.
It also will allow local entities to outlaw them.</TE>
<TE>   One of Segway's main venture capitalists was Kleiner, Perkins,
Caufield and Byers. A partner in the firm, John Doerr III, is one of
Davis' major donors, having given him $160,000 since 1999, including
$25,000 in June.</TE>
<TE>   Segway's nationwide lobbying campaign has succeeded in gaining
approval to use the vehicles on sidewalks in 29 states, despite
concerns that they could crash into blind people and result in
liability suits against local government.</TE>
<TE>   The bill, SB 1918 by Sen. Tom Torlakson (D-Antioch), easily
cleared both houses of the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   Davis signed other bills:</TE>
<TE>   PRESERVE--Farmers, local government and conservation groups can
receive $4.8 million in loans and grants to preserve farm, grazing
and oak lands from development. The bill called for spending $9.6
million from Proposition 40 conservation funds approved by the voters
in March, but Davis cut the sum in half. AB 52 by Assemblywoman
Patricia Wiggins (D-Santa Rosa).</TE>
<TE>   FRAUD--Companies must publicly disclose twice a year loans to
their directors at preferential rates, yearly pay for directors and
top executives, and the names of independent auditors. The measure is
intended to curb corporate fraud. AB 55 by Assemblyman Kevin Shelley
(D-San Francisco).</TE>
<TE>   PRIESTS--Clergy and certain other church employees must report to
authorities known or suspected cases of child sexual abuse, except if
the information has been acquired in a confessional. AB 299 by
Assemblyman Rod Pacheco (R-Riverside).</TE>

<HD>Black Group Endorses Art Lopez</HD>
<DH>LAPD: Political advocacy association says it backs the
police chief finalist because of his record in Oxnard department.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY McCARTNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An African American political organization on Saturday endorsed
Oxnard Police Chief Art Lopez as its choice to lead the Los Angeles
Police Department.</LD>
<LD>   Lopez is one of three finalists for police chief, and leaders of
the Black American Political Assn. of California said they are
backing him because of his record in Oxnard.</LD>
<LD>   Since he took over the Oxnard Police Department in 1998 after a
long career with the LAPD, Lopez has tried to recruit more black
officers, said Bobbie Blair, leader of the group's Oxnard chapter.</LD>
<TE>   This year, Lopez attended the organization's Juneteenth
celebration and brought several officers to talk with residents.</TE>
<TE>   The Black American Political Assn. works to elect candidates who
support African American political causes, and said it has 60,000
members in California.</TE>
<TE>   Organization President Percy Pinkney said the group simply did not
know the other candidates: William Bratton, former New York City
police commissioner, and John Timoney, former Philadelphia police
commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   Pinkney said several black LAPD officers told the organization
that Lopez "worked well with them and was always for equal justice"
when he was with the department.</TE>
<TE>   Not all group members supported the endorsement, however.</TE>
<TE>   Windsor Heights resident Ernestine Napue said she was not happy
with any of the three finalists, and hoped the city would take a look
at more candidates. She also worried that Lopez could be too close to
Mayor James K. Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   Napue said she was disgusted by Hahn's decision earlier this year
to not give former Chief Bernard C. Parks a second five-year term.
She said whoever next leads the department should "definitely be
African American or Latino" in order to properly represent city
residents and fix the troubled department.</TE>
<TE>   The group also announced its endorsement of Parks, who is running
for the District 8 seat on the Los Angeles City Council. It backed
Anthony Batts as its choice to lead the Long Beach Police Department,
and endorsed Proposition 49, which would expand after-school programs
at public schools.</TE>

<HD>Fair's Charm Survives Changing Times</HD>
<DH>Recreation: The county event, which ends today, clings to
agrarian roots and still manages to reinvent itself each year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Urban sophisticates may argue that county fairs are as anachronistic
as butter churns and bundling boards. Then how come more than a
million people schlep to Pomona every year for the L.A. County Fair?</LD>
<LD>   Eighty years after its founding, the L.A. County Fair--the county
fair with the highest attendance in the nation, according to
Amusement Business magazine--appears to be thriving. Management won't
release attendance figures until after the fair ends today, but even
as farmland in the county has shrunk from almost 900,000 acres in
1920 to 130,000 acres in 1997 (according to the U.S. Census Bureau),
the county fair has flourished.</LD>
<LD>   Even last year, when the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks caused it to
close for a day, the fair took in $20 million, enough to meet its
expenses, according to spokeswoman Wendy Talarico.</LD>
<TE>   Stephen Chambers, executive director of the Western Fairs Assn. in
Sacramento, has a theory on why fairs have survived, and it isn't
just the Kettle Korn. Unlike theme parks that "utilize capital and
technology to create fantasy worlds," he said, fairs "celebrate the
accomplishments of ordinary citizens."</TE>
<TE>   While fairs began as places where farmers could get up-to-date
agricultural information, "today's farmers can't wait for the fair,"
Chambers said. "They're on the Internet every day." No longer just
celebrations of horticulture, he said, "fairs reflect the success of
the community."</TE>
<TE>   Some things at the Pomona fair never seem to change. It's often
oppressively hot (105 degrees on Wednesday); riders still scream when
they get to the top of the Ferris wheel; the weight guesser rarely
misses; and unspeakable new uses are inevitably found for Spam.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, the fair remains true to its agrarian roots. Since
this year's fair, advertised as "Kinder, Simpler, Funner," opened
Sept. 13, visitors have packed the Maternity and Nursery Barn to see
cows and sheep give birth on the straw. Those who can't get to Pomona
to watch squirming piglets suckling at imposing sows can see photos
at www.lacountyfair.com.</TE>
<TE>   Hands-on activities are a major trend in fairs, said Chambers, who
cites such oddball examples as the plant petting zoo at the Orange
County Fair.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd never seen Brussels sprouts except neatly trimmed and sitting
in a basket," Chambers recalled of his first encounter at the fair
with the vegetable in its natural state.</TE>
<TE>   The fair is also a learning experience for some of those who work
it.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Bob Small, a professor at Cal Poly Pomona and
founder of Dr. Bob's Hand Crafted Ice Creams, this year set up a
small production facility operated by his students. The hands-on
experience they get making and selling ice cream is reminiscent of
the education that technical schools once provided, Small said. "It
was called, 'learning by doing.' "</TE>
<TE>   State and county fairs stay relevant by constantly reinventing
themselves. In the 1960s, visitors to Pomona snapped up the fad du
jour: live chameleons wearing tiny collars that could be pinned to
the buyer's shirt.</TE>
<TE>   The 2002 fair reflects this year's fads. Visitors ante up $2 a
throw to win a stuffed replica of cartoon character SpongeBob
SquarePants, just as earlier fairgoers vied for stuffed Scooby Doos.
There are extreme skating shows and daily demonstrations of feng
shui--the hip, new version of the ancient Chinese art of arranging
spaces.</TE>
<TE>   Entertainment at fairs has also evolved. Despite the appearance
this year of Travis Tritt, country is no longer the sole musical
option.</TE>
<TE>   "They're breaking away from, 'It's Winona in the grandstands at
8:30 tonight,' " said Chambers, who said he was charmed in Pomona by
a group singing golden oldies while dressed as vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   One well-attended attraction at the fair this year is the
California Department of Justice's information booth about Megan's
Law, named for Megan Kanka, a 7-year-old New Jersey girl who was
raped and killed. There, visitors can tap into the database to see if
a registered sex offender is living in their neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Recent high-profile abductions seem to have caused inquiries to
soar, according to Information Officer Mike Van Winkle. By the end of
the day Wednesday, 4,699 people had checked the database in Pomona.
That's almost twice as many as last year, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Another of the fair's biggest draws are the competitions, from
sculpture to milk drinking. "Overall entries--people who are
competing at fairs--have skyrocketed in recent years" to hundreds of
thousands of entrants nationwide, Chambers said.</TE>
<TE>   One popular competition in Pomona is "tablescaping," in which
entrants create elaborate table settings on such themes as Neil
Diamond. In this retro competition, entrants lose points for putting
the forks in the wrong place.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, there were 27,000 entrants in various fair competitions
in addition to 6,300 livestock entries, Talarico said.</TE>
<TE>   "Where else can you enter your quilt or your jam or jelly?" asked
Talarico, who said the fair added two popular contests this year, for
best salsas and tamales.</TE>
<TE>   "Creature comforts"--including more shaded places to sit, improved
landscaping and the addition of mist-blowing devices--are on the rise
at fairs, according to Bob Johnson, president of the Outdoor
Amusement Business Assn., whose 5,000 members own carnivals and other
concessions.</TE>
<TE>   But the heart of the fair is still a little bit country. In one of
the cavernous livestock barns, 4-H member Kelsey Clelland, 14,
hand-sheared the brown wool of her yearling ewe Ebony. Wearing a
fashionably cropped T-shirt, Kelsey struggled to keep the 150-pound
ewe on its shearing platform. "The animals get really stressed out at
the fair," she said.</TE>
<TE>   A ninth-grader at Claremont High School, Kelsey said she likes
"regular teenage stuff," such as surfing and listening to the band
Blink 182. Only a few of her classmates have ever wrestled a
recalcitrant ewe, and most think her involvement in the fair is cool,
she said. If a few of them tease her, so be it.</TE>
<TE>   "I think farming is really important," Kelsey said. "Some people
who come to the fair don't know some of these animals are going to be
eaten."</TE>
<TE>   Her mother, Donna Clelland, said farm skills are the least of what
teens like Kelsey get from the 4-H program.</TE>
<TE>   "They learn social skills, they learn marketing skills, they learn
how to speak in front of the public," Clelland said. "And it keeps
her out of the malls."</TE>
<TE>   Talarico said she believes the county fair is stitched into the
personal histories of millions of Angelenos. "There are so many
people who have stories--they met their spouse at the fair, or their
parents met at the fair, or they had their first date at the fair,"
she said.</TE>

<LD>Urban sophisticates may argue that county fairs are as anachronistic

<TE>   Most carnivals are family businesses whose owners recognize that
the seedy, carny reputation that still clings to traveling shows is a
liability, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Cammack Shows, which has run the midway in Pomona for the last
18 years, has pre-employment drug testing and random drug testing
during the fair, said Tony Fiori, its marketing, media relations and
safety director. It also offers employees a free haircut on site.</TE>

<HD>Rescuer Is Honored as Forest Fire Fades</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A San Diego firefighter received a commendation Saturday for quick
action that may have spared an inmate working on the Williams fire in
Angeles National Forest from severe burns.</LD>
<LD>   James Jones, 27, a U.S. Forest Service firefighter based in the
Cleveland National Forest, got his award in the early morning hours,
then left for the fire lines on what has become a soggy, fading
blaze. Several hundred of his comrades were released from the fire,
which consumed 35,925 acres last week before soggy weather subdued it
this weekend.</LD>
<LD>   The fire was reported to be 75% contained Saturday--a major
advance from the day before--with the threat significantly
diminished, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   The rescue occurred on Wednesday, as the raging fire tore along
the East Fork of the San Gabriel River. Jones and his engine crew
were helping to clear brush and light backfires to protect Follows
Camp, a small, mostly seasonal settlement, when an inmate working in
a ravine above him was hit by a falling boulder and sent hurtling
down into the burn area.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, the only firefighter close to where the man landed, hauled
the semiconscious inmate out of a pit, saving him from what could
have been severe burns, according to witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   "It was well over 2,000 degrees, and he went in there and hauled
him out like a piece of luggage," said Mark Miller, a California
Department of Forestry and Fire Protection captain who supervised the
crew. "It was way hot."</TE>
<TE>   The boulder, which Miller said measured 3 feet in diameter and
weighed hundreds of pounds, caromed down the ravine, sending the crew
scurrying for cover, Miller said. Inmate Del Karnes had run to the
side of the ravine: The boulder slammed into his lower leg and sent
him end-over-end down about 70 feet of slope.</TE>
<TE>   The dazed Karnes landed in an area of slash and brush that had
just been ignited, according to Miller. "He went from standing
position to a ball, and was just pummeled down into the fire," Miller
said. Karnes broke an ankle and was evacuated to a hospital. He could
not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   "I just ran up to him like anyone else and dragged him from the
burn," Jones said, shrugging off the incident. "With your adrenaline
going, it's easy to do."</TE>
<TE>   The burly nine-year veteran said he had seen the boulder come
loose, yelled for the crew to take cover, then watched in shock as
the inmate fell. Karnes was in the burn area only a matter of seconds
before being rescued, Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as he stopped rolling, I pulled him out," he said. "I
think anyone would have done it, seeing that happen.''</TE>
<TE>   The commendation Saturday came amid other positive developments on
a stubborn fire that has forced the closing of the entire national
forest.</TE>
<TE>   High humidity and sporadic drizzle suppressed the flames, which
once threatened several foothill communities, as well as Mount Baldy
Village, according to fire officials. A series of backfires set
overnight helped clear underbrush and trees in an area south of the
village, said Richard Wingate of the Mount Baldy volunteer fire
department.</TE>
<TE>   The weather, which is expected to continue to be relatively damp
and cool for several days, should aid the effort, with more drizzle
and humidity predicted for today. But winds are expected to pick up
slightly, forecasters said.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the soggy village Saturday, relieved residents--and a
few from neighboring communities--applauded the work of the
firefighters who had kept the flames at bay.</TE>
<TE>   At the Mount Baldy Lodge at mid-morning, groups of firefighters,
still in sooty gear, dug into a breakfast of sausage and pancakes as
the owner, Missy Ellington, served coffee and thanks in equal
portions.</TE>
<TE>   With the fire slowed, Ellington said, she was starting to relax.
"We've had a lot of firefighters around, and we feel pretty safe
now," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "The firefighters have just been awesome," said Jennifer Tobias,
30, who has worked as a waitress at the lodge on and off since
childhood and was back Saturday to help out. Tobias said the lodge
had served 230 meals to firefighters Friday night and more than 200
on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Just outside the village, Esther Morales, whose niece had been
evacuated with other residents last week, stopped her Range Rover
near a firefighting crew to distribute more food. Morales and several
friends had filled the back of her vehicle with boxes of fruit and
cookies and had talked their way through several checkpoints to carry
out their project, they said. "Everybody just said, 'Keep going,' "
Morales said.</TE>
<TE>   Handing out bananas, apples and chocolate chip cookies to a "hot
shot" team from Montana, Morales said she and friends Linda Alvarez,
Hope Brown, and Brown's daughter Montana, 7, just wanted to say
thanks to all who had helped save the area from further destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighter Stephanie Juko said she was grateful for the fruit and
the personal thanks. "You get tired at times, but you get used to
it," said Juko, whose crew had been fighting the fire since
Wednesday. "We'll be here as long as they need us."</TE>

<DH>Safety: Angeles National Forest is off limits until rains
arrive, leaving hikers and mountain bikers without their favorite
recreation destination.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>There were the Boy Scouts who first learned via television news that
their long-planned campout near Mt. Baden-Powell was off because of
the abrupt closure last week of the Angeles National Forest.</LD>
<LD>   There was the equestrian who halted her after-work trail ride
above Altadena when she spotted a hastily erected U.S. Forest Service
sign. And there were all those boaters baffled by the locked gates
barring their way to Pyramid Lake off the Golden State Freeway in the
northwest reaches of Los Angeles County.</LD>
<LD>   "They're calling like crazy. People who are at the gates and on
their cell phones asking what's going on, and I imagine that will
continue until we can get the signs up," said Joe Young, who works
part time at the Santa Clara/Mojave Rivers Ranger District office
near Saugus.</LD>
<TE>   Workers hustled last week to close the sprawling, fire-plagued
forest to all recreational use because of the extreme fire hazard
resulting from a record drought and a series of summer fires.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people don't even know Pyramid Lake is part of the
forest," Young said.</TE>
<TE>   Shutting down a national forest, especially one as vast and as
widely used as the Angeles, is a complicated business. But forest
officials decided to halt all recreational use as of noon Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement came as about 3,000 firefighters battled the
worst of the area's fires so far this season. It began a week ago in
the San Gabriel Mountains above Azusa, near the Williams Camp,
consumed nearly 36,000 acres and at least 72 structures and
threatened historic Mount Baldy Village and homes in the foothills of
Glendora and Claremont.</TE>
<TE>   The Angeles will be closed until the start of significant rains,
which could be as late as January or even longer. That means the
temporary loss of what officials believe is America's busiest
national forest.</TE>
<TE>   More than 3.5 million people a year use the forest's 500-plus
miles of hiking trails, streams, 66 campgrounds, 36 picnic sites,
five large lakes and four ski areas. They ride horses and mountain
bikes, go fishing, practice shooting at designated areas, learn about
the wilderness at five visitor centers. Motorcycles vie with cars and
SUVs on the winding Angeles Crest Highway--State Route 2--on their
way to Wrightwood or other mountain vacation spots.</TE>
<TE>   The 656,000-acre forest, which covers much of the San Gabriel
Mountains and a separate rugged area across the Santa Clarita and
Antelope valleys, comprises one-fourth of Los Angeles County's land
area and is nearly ringed by suburban communities. That puts it
within an hour's drive of more than 20 million people.</TE>
<TE>   Almost since its establishment as a national forest in December
1892, the Angeles has been known as Los Angeles' backyard playground.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be a large hole in the recreational opportunities for
so many people," said Clare Marter Kenyon, an activist in Los
Angeles' Mount Washington neighborhood, who said she had hiked in the
forest for 30 years. Her favorite trails are the cool and shady
Switzer and the isolated Buckhorn.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel sad for all the thousands of people who can't go up there
for a little picnic on Sundays and get away from the urban grind,"
she said. But Marter Kenyon, like many regular users of the forest,
said she understands the Forest Service's decision.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said they were following many of the same procedures
used in 1993, when they closed the forest after a devastating fire
above Altadena and when conditions were similarly dry.</TE>
<TE>   Main roads through the forest remain open--the Angeles Forest and
Angeles Crest highways and Big Tujunga, Upper Big Tujunga Canyon,
Little Tujunga and Sand Canyon roads, as well as Mt. Wilson Road, but
no stopping is allowed along any of them. All Forest Service roads
are closed.</TE>
<TE>   Private areas within the forest boundaries, such as the village of
Wrightwood, are open. Facilities that operate on special-use permits,
such as private campgrounds and Pyramid Lake, are closed and will be
evaluated case by case for possible reopening.</TE>
<TE>   "You can drive up to Wrightwood and have lunch, but you can't stop
along the way," is how forest spokeswoman Gail Wright summed up the
situation.</TE>
<TE>   In the adjacent San Bernardino National Forest to the east,
officials this week closed part of the Lytle Creek area, which is
near the Williams fire.</TE>
<TE>   Officials there also banned campfires in any area of the forest
until the fire season ends.</TE>
<TE>   Wright acknowledged that the Forest Service does not have enough
rangers to patrol the entire Angeles National Forest. Many of its
most popular trails are accessible from the foothills above Pasadena
and Sierra Madre and from the highways that traverse its isolated
peaks and valleys.</TE>
<TE>   Workers have been posting signs throughout the forest and at
trailheads, and they have been informing visitors of the situation.
Officials expect most visitors will comply, once they learn the
forest is closed. For repeat or flagrant violators, however, the
penalties can be stiff--a $5,000 fine, six months in jail or both,
Wright said.</TE>
<TE>   "We think most people will attempt to do the right thing. For
those who try to get around [the ban], the enforcement people will be
out there," Wright said.</TE>
<TE>   Many seemed resigned to the situation, even as they pined for the
forest's rugged peaks and peaceful glades.</TE>
<TE>   "I've disagreed with the Forest Service on many things, called
them stupid and bureaucratic," said attorney Paul R. Ayers, who has
sued over damage to Rubio Canyon and led hikes throughout the San
Gabriels. "But this is not an unreasonable decision. It is very, very
dangerous up there right now, and people have to respect that.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody can outrun a wildfire," Ayers said.</TE>
<TE>   At Phiddipides, an Encino store for runners, cancellation of the
annual 100-mile "ultra marathon" was a hot topic last week.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great run, a beautiful run, very difficult, but with such
great scenery you never get bored," said Mike Dimkich of Woodland
Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy Sullivan of Altadena, who loves riding her horses on the
forest trails above her home, said the closing poses special problems
for the horse owners of her community, who have very few safe areas
outside the forest to ride and exercise their animals.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a really sad situation, and it just further amplifies the
need for the county to provide safe areas" for riders, Sullivan said,
adding that she is "really torn" about the forest closing.</TE>
<TE>   "I love riding in this beautiful area, so close to the city, and
yet, when I was up there a couple of weeks ago, I noticed how very
dry the brush was, and I thought, this is so dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   For the Boy Scouts of Troop 103 from Ventura, the closing means a
delay, possibly of several months, in their plans to earn the "Five
Peaks" patch. The forest's Mt. Baden-Powell is required hiking for
the patch, and the plan was to camp near the base next Saturday night
and make the climb Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we've been knocked out of the ring on that, and we had
planned it for at least six months," said a disappointed Assistant
Scoutmaster Jerry Boone.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe, if the rains come early enough, we can still do it before
it gets too cold; otherwise, we'll have to wait and try again in the
spring," said Boone, who had planned the outing with his son, Trevor,
12, and other scouts and troop leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Lawrence of the San Fernando Bike Club and friends who ride
mountain bikes canceled a challenging ride planned for next month up
the Mt. Wilson toll road and down the Gabrielino Trail.</TE>
<TE>   "We could probably still do it and get away with it, but we won't.
We understand why it's closed, and we're going to be good citizens
and honor that. It's disappointing, but the forest is a very valuable
asset, and we all need to do what we can to protect it," Lawrence
said.</TE>
<TE>   And a representative of the Angeles chapter of the Sierra Club,
which had to cancel a campout and a trail cleanup scheduled for this
weekend, said the closing of the Angeles, as frustrating as it is,
poses an opportunity to try other wilderness areas in the vicinity.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got the Santa Monicas, the Cleveland National Forest, the
Los Padres National Forest, the Whittier Hills," said Bill Corcoran,
regional representative for the Sierra Club.</TE>
<TE>   Then, with a little swipe at the Angeles National Forest's
still-controversial decision a few years ago to start charging a $5
fee to use the forest, Corcoran added:</TE>
<TE>   "There are all kinds of places where people can get out and enjoy
nature without having to pay five bucks. It's a good time to explore
areas they haven't seen before."</TE>

<HD>Army National Guard Unit Arrives Home in Southland</HD>
<DH>Welcome: Families greet 300 soldiers who had pulled
homeland defense duty in Utah.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H.G. REZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About 300 soldiers from the California National Guard returned home
and to civilian life Saturday after spending the last year on
homeland defense duty.</LD>
<LD>   Troops from the Third Battalion of the 160th Infantry Regiment
arrived at the Los Alamitos Army Airfield aboard a chartered DC-10 to
a thunderous welcome from family and friends, who broke through a
porous line of sentries to greet their loved ones on the tarmac as
they deplaned.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm supposed to go," pleaded a soldier who was mobbed by his
family as soon as his combat boot touched the ground.</LD>
<TE>   The soldiers had been ordered to stand in formation for the
traditional head count and to await the report "All present and
accounted for, sir!" before joining their families.</TE>
<TE>   Rene Espinoza, 18, of Carson fidgeted nervously with 4-month-old
Victoria Cathleen in her arms while waiting for her husband, Spc.
Frank Espinoza, 20, to appear at the plane's door. She had to wait a
long time.</TE>
<TE>   Espinoza is a member of Charlie Company, the last unit to leave
the plane.</TE>
<TE>   "Where is he? I haven't seen anybody else from his platoon," Rene
said to her mother, Rosemary Naval.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, a soldier walked out with Charlie Company's insignia, and
Rene recognized another who is in her husband's platoon. When Spc.
Espinoza appeared at the plane's door, his family rushed forward.</TE>
<TE>   His mother-in-law put two colorful leis around his neck, setting
him apart in the sea of camouflage-wearing troops on the tarmac.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, Rudy Naval, a helicopter door gunner in Vietnam, chuckled
as he recounted his fight with the Army bureaucracy to make sure that
his daughter's and son-in-law's wedding went on as planned in Las
Vegas in January, even if he was on a mission in support of Noble
Eagle One, the name of the operation for homeland security.</TE>
<TE>   Naval said Espinoza had been granted leave to attend his wedding.
But 24 hours before the ceremony, he was told he couldn't leave his
post, Naval said.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing's changed," said Naval, recalling his own experience in
the Army three decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   "We had everything planned, and about 40 family members were in
Las Vegas for the wedding. I started calling people, beginning with
the guy at the guard gate, all the way to Frank's battalion
commander. They finally told him he could go to his wedding, which
took place on time."</TE>
<TE>   Later, Espinoza was allowed to go home for his daughter's birth.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, an excited Espinoza rushed to his wife and daughter
when the battalion was dismissed. After giving his wife a quick kiss,
he reached for the baby.</TE>
<TE>   "I've only seen her seven times in my whole life. I just want to
hold her," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Now that he is a civilian again, Espinoza said, he will return to
college, where he was majoring in computer information systems before
his unit was activated.</TE>
<TE>   But even after Espinoza and the others were dismissed, the troops
could spend only a short time getting reacquainted with their
families before they were bused to armories in San Pedro, Inglewood,
Glendale, Oxnard and Bakersfield, from where they departed last
October.</TE>
<TE>   During their deployment, the soldiers guarded Army ammunition
depots in Utah.</TE>

<HD>Style Can Upstage Substance in Hollywood Secession</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NITA LELYVELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When it comes to winning at the polls, Hollywood secessionists could
have a tough road ahead. But for pure street theater, their campaign
may just be unbeatable.</LD>
<LD>   Hollywood and San Fernando Valley secession advocates share many
campaign issues, but the style of the Hollywood campaign is
undeniably flashier.</LD>
<LD>   The movement's moneybags, a millionaire nightclub owner who wants
to be Hollywood's mayor, is plastering his image on everything from
water bottles to a 20-foot billboard truck that roams day after day
around the city.</LD>
<TE>   He also has printed up black T-shirts featuring a Warhol-esque
red, yellow and blue triptych of his photo, framed by the words,
"Gene La Pietra for Hollywood City Council, a colorful candidate for
colorful times."</TE>
<TE>   On a Web site, billboard queen Angelyne now poses sex-kittenishly
as a candidate for Hollywood mayor.</TE>
<TE>   Billy Tsangares, a Los Feliz T-shirt shop owner who started the
"Free Winona" campaign after actress Winona Rider was arrested on
suspicion of shoplifting, has offered himself up as a candidate for
Hollywood City Council, handing out news releases printed on canvas,
with George Washington's image and the words, "Cityhood is American."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood secession even has a rock video, in which a band, Fleur
de Lis, poses in front of the Hollywood sign and belts out the
campaign's anthem: "Hey, L.A., Set Hollywood Free."</TE>
<TE>   Voters all over Los Angeles will decide on Nov. 5 whether to let
Hollywood and the Valley secede. An independent Hollywood would cover
15 square miles, have a population of about 185,000 and be run by
five at-large City Council members who would choose a mayor from
within their ranks.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood secession campaign organizers know how to draw
attention.</TE>
<TE>   Each day, paid workers stand at busy intersections during rush
hour, holding large "Free Hollywood" signs and cutouts of American
icons, from Elvis Presley to Marilyn Monroe.</TE>
<TE>   They also know how to draw crowds.</TE>
<TE>   Council candidates are appearing en masse at events, campaigning
together for Hollywood independence, without which there won't be a
Hollywood City Council.</TE>
<TE>   Most afternoons, candidates and volunteers head to the top of
Runyon Canyon, a local hiking trail popular with dog owners, with
buckets of biscuits for the dogs and La Pietra's personalized water
bottles for the owners. The original water bottle labels are covered
by stickers, which feature a photo of La Pietra crouched with his
arms around his three dogs. A caption reads, "Gene with Max, Bella &amp;
Bommer."</TE>
<TE>   Anti-secessionists aren't amused by La Pietra. Some view him as a
would-be dictator, trying to stage a hostile takeover of their
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to live in Gene La Pietra's Hollywood," said
Hollywood bookstore owner Susan Polifronio through gritted teeth, as
she stood at a recent political event on Cahuenga Boulevard holding
an "I Love Los Angeles" sign.</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra seems to bask in the attention, whether it's positive or
negative.</TE>
<TE>   Last week he organized a $28,500 "Hollywood for Cityhood Kick-Off
Celebration" at his Arena Cafe nightclub on Hollywood Boulevard.
Full-page newspaper ads touted live entertainment, food, open bar and
speakers, at no charge.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the club, beside neat stacks of free lawn signs, a dozen
candidates formed a receiving line, reaching out to shake the hands
of each new arrival.</TE>
<TE>   At the front, La Pietra crooned, "Heaven, I'm in heaven, when I
see so many people lining up.... "</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds came, including many genuine secession supporters. The
line for the free hamburgers, hot dogs, and Thai, Armenian and
Mexican dishes snaked around corners. Guests happily donned the
stars-and-stripes top hats handed out at a booth inside. They gazed
at 8-foot-tall, 4-foot-wide posters of Hollywood candidates along the
high walls of the club's main room.</TE>
<TE>   Most stuck around after chowing down, waiting for the main event,
La Pietra's grand entrance. The lights dimmed, a smoke machine
churned out fog and green lasers fanned out overhead. "Hail to the
Chief" boomed from the speakers and La Pietra strode onto the stage.
With a large American flag unfurling behind him, he raised his arms
in a Nixon-style V.</TE>
<TE>   "We're there!" he shouted. "We're there! Isn't this the most
exciting?"</TE>
<TE>   Then he called out the names of about a dozen other Hollywood City
Council candidates, who jogged onto the stage like players running
onto a field, delivering short, pep rally-type speeches.</TE>
<TE>   "The opposition tells us we're not smart enough to have our own
city. We say we are!" called out Garry Sininian, as fellow Armenian
Americans in the crowd cheered.</TE>
<TE>   "I know we can do it. You know we can do it," pitched young movie
director Tad Davis. "Let's set Hollywood free."</TE>
<TE>   As strobe lights and laser beams lit the disco floor, gallons of
rainbow confetti and hundreds of red, white and blue balloons dropped
from the ceiling.</TE>
<TE>   Mariachi singer Alejandro Lopez, La Pietra's partner, took to the
stage with his group, Azteca, and sang:</TE>
<TE>   "Viva Hollywood. I love Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "Viva Gene La Pietra, mayor of Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "I love Gene La Pietra, mayor of Hollywood."</TE>
<TE>   While there's no shortage of theater, getting the votes remains
the challenge.</TE>
<TE>   After La Pietra's presidential-style entry, he said, "There's a
story in the Bible: 40 days and 40 nights and then there was a
miracle.</TE>
<TE>   "We have 40 days. Let's get cracking."</TE>

<HD>There's No Telling Where a War With Iraq May Take Us</HD>

<LD>Forget what you've heard.</LD>
<LD>   National polls, some of which suggest 70% of Americans support a
war against Iraq, are not to be trusted. Roughly 75% of the readers
of this column are opposed, and that many people can't be wrong.</LD>
<LD>   Twice now I've raised questions about the wisdom of such an
undertaking, and several hundred people have backed me up.</LD>
<TE>   So who's out of step? Us, or Washington?</TE>
<TE>   I was going to suggest that we reinstate the draft, and see if the
thought of sending their own children and grandchildren into battle
makes lawmakers slow the drumbeat.</TE>
<TE>   But a growing number of people in Congress have come out of
hibernation and are finally asking why President Bush is in such a
hurry. They're also wondering if we have any idea what we're getting
into.</TE>
<TE>   Good question, and for an answer, I checked with USC professor
Richard Dekmejian. He's an authority on international terrorism,
Islamic fundamentalism and Middle East politics.</TE>
<TE>   Dekmejian, for the record, is no fan of Saddam Hussein, who has
never been shy about slaughtering anyone who doesn't bow before him.
In a 1985 book called "Islam in Revolution," Dekmejian wrote about
the murder of a Shiite holy man by Saddam's forces, and he was
invited by Hussein's emissaries to visit Iraq and hear Saddam's
version of history, an offer he declined.</TE>
<TE>   The best-case outcome of U.S. intervention, Dekmejian would agree,
is the one put forth by President Bush. Saddam Hussein is destroyed,
his weapons program dismantled, and democracy takes root in Iraq and
beyond, spreading love and happiness throughout the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   There is, unfortunately, a better chance that a blind pig will
snort a truffle in Baghdad and open a chocolate shop.</TE>
<TE>   Things could go terribly wrong very quickly, says Dekmejian. He
thinks it would be much smarter to continue containing Iraq and
limiting Hussein's access to atomic weapons than to stir more
madness.</TE>
<TE>   "If Saddam sees that this is his end, he might just as well use
whatever he has, not only against Israel, but American troops,"
Dekmejian says.</TE>
<TE>   "When that happens, do the Israelis attack back, and do they use
atomic weapons? I don't know, but one has to remember that the man in
charge of Israel can be dangerous too. Not as dangerous as Saddam, of
course. And this could escalate the entire Arab-Israeli conflict."</TE>
<TE>   If chaos reigns, he says, it's not a stretch to imagine India and
Pakistan following America's lead on preemptive strikes and going to
war over Kashmir. A war that could well go nuclear.</TE>
<TE>   But let's, for the moment, push aside the specter of the United
States pulling the trigger that starts World War III. Let's assume we
accomplish the first objective and blow Saddam Hussein into the next
century.</TE>
<TE>   What then?</TE>
<TE>   No telling, says Dekmejian. But one distinct possibility is chaos.</TE>
<TE>   "And the human cost will be enormous."</TE>
<TE>   Imagine Los Angeles if you were to get rid of all official
authority and turn the city over to the Crips and Bloods. That's what
we'd be looking at in Iraq, only worse, and American troops would be
caught in the middle of it.</TE>
<TE>   The Crips in this case are the Shiites, and the Bloods are the
Sunnis, who currently rule the country. They don't much like each
other, and it'll be a race to see who gets to the Sunnis first--the
Shiites or the equally vengeful Kurds, who have been gassed, and
persecuted for years, by Saddam's people.</TE>
<TE>   I happen to have spent some time in Iraq's Kurdish reaches, and I
can tell you firsthand that they don't even get along with each
other. And one faction has been particularly close to Iran, which
arguably is more dangerous than Iraq, and could conceivably get drawn
into this mess. If so, Dekmejian says, Russia could follow.</TE>
<TE>   Given the long, complex histories of these conflicts, and the
depth of hatred that exists, Dekmejian has a neat summary of any
expectation for democracy to triumph in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "It's completely insane."</TE>
<TE>   "First of all," Dekmejian explains, "you need some precedent for
democracy, some cultural inclination and homogeneity, and the fellows
opposing Saddam don't even run their own organizations
democratically.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll need a massive military force to occupy the place and keep
people from killing each other, so it will mean a long-term
commitment financially and militarily."</TE>
<TE>   And that, believe it or not, could be the least of our concerns.
Bombing Iraq could work wonders for the recruiting efforts of the
world's anti-American terrorist organizations, says Dekmejian, who
fears the radicalization of untold thousands of Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   "For a variety of reasons that have to do with U.S. foreign policy
and our support of authoritarian regimes in that part of the world,
the countries of Islam are at a mass level of anger and fury," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   "Attacking another Arab country in this atmosphere of hostility is
the wrong thing to do, and it's going to contribute to terrorism
rather than detract from it. I expect the blowback to occur across
the world."</TE>
<TE>   Blowback, of course, is another word for Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Shall we take another poll now?</TE>

<HD>San Clemente Hits a Happy Median</HD>
<DH>Economy: Area near pier is in middle after U.S. income
benchmark drops 2.2%. Residents, even those without jobs, plan to
stay put.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the first things Melissa Magner did when she moved into her
small, wood-frame apartment on Encino Lane five years ago was measure
the short walk down a curl of palm-lined streets to the beach just
north of the San Clemente Pier.</LD>
<LD>   Two-tenths of a mile, exactly.</LD>
<LD>   "This is," she said last week, "a good place to be unemployed."</LD>
<TE>   Magner, a 32-year-old recreation therapist, has been out of
regular work since the beginning of the year, part of a nationwide
slide that last year reduced the median household income by 2.2%, to
$42,228, the first time since 1994 the benchmark shifted downward.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess I'm it. I'm the reason," Magner said with a laugh in her
frontyard, a rectangle of grass, potted plants and patio chairs just
a few steps up the street from an ocean view.</TE>
<TE>   While the median remains near the all-time high, the slip reflects
broad pressures from such economic realities as jobs exported under
globalism, domestic layoffs and stagnant corporate profits and
reduced wages.</TE>
<TE>   On the surface, little of that would seem to involve Magner's
neighborhood. But it does. Through a convergence of coincidence, the
neighborhood's household income in the 2000 census was the price of
two pizzas higher than the national median.</TE>
<TE>   That makes Magner's neighborhood a fulcrum for a statistical
abstract: Half the nation's households make more than $42,228, and
the other half make less.</TE>
<TE>   This is what the median looks like in the flesh, and in wood and
stucco. Magner's neighborhood--technically, census tract 421.08,
block group 5--comprises a small cluster of streets with
single-family homes and apartments between the San Clemente Community
Center and a block of condominiums on a bluff overlooking the beach.</TE>
<TE>   The neighborhood reflects the nation in narrow economic terms, but
its makeup carries a decidedly Southern California skew. According to
census data, a higher percentage of white residents lives here than
in the nation overall--unusual, given Southern California's ethnic
diversity. Residents are younger than the national median. And most,
like Magner, are renters, while nationally more people live in homes
they own.</TE>
<TE>   Amanda Watts, 39, and her husband are part of the local minority
who own their home. Although they get along with their
neighbors--"It's the kind of place where people say 'Hi,' " said one
resident--they don't really know many of them.</TE>
<TE>   Watts knows more people from around town than she does from her
surrounding streets, a function of the transient nature of rental
neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like Newport Beach was before the crowds," said Watts, a
stay-at-home mother of two boys, ages 14 and 11. "It has that
small-town feeling. People recognize you. I must wave to 20 people a
day. But it's not that small-town. It still has variety."</TE>
<TE>   If Magner's unemployment checks weigh down the neighborhood income
median, the Watts family helps lift it back up. Watts said her
husband makes well above the median as operations manager for a
company that makes automated welding machines.</TE>
<TE>   With the recession, though, orders have been down, the company was
recently bought out and her husband--and fellow workers--saw their
paychecks cut.</TE>
<TE>   "We're fortunate that he's still working," she said.</TE>
<TE>   There's no way to determine the nature of work done by the
neighborhood's residents. Some are self-employed. Many of the
renters, residents say, work in restaurants and other service
industries. Some, like Magner, don't have jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Magner quit as a recreation therapist at Saddleback Memorial
Medical Center in January to pursue a dream: to become an elementary
school teacher. Having completed her courses, she signed up this
spring to do four months of student teaching--"working for free," she
says--to finish her credential requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Magner taught a class for autistic pre-kindergarteners but
couldn't land a full-time teaching job when school opened this month.
Substitutes make only $90 a day with no benefits, so Magner decided
to return to recreation therapy.</TE>
<TE>   But she's not giving up on her dream.</TE>
<TE>   "I want a regular classroom, eventually," she said as she waited
for a return call from a hospital human resources office. One
concession she won't make: moving.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just so laid-back," she said as breezes ruffled flowering
bushes and a sprinkler whooshed somewhere down the street. "It's just
such a nice beach attitude, great neighbors. It's just a wonderful
place to live."</TE>

<HD>Firm Hopes to Expand Morro Bay Power Plant Despite Poor
Economy</HD>
<DH>Energy: Critics of the natural gas-burning site say its
electricity is not needed. Updated facility would be more efficient,
says owner Duke Energy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLY CONNELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>MORRO BAY</DL>
<LD>Central Coast environmentalists hope the vagaries of California
energy economics can do what they could not: slow or even halt
expansion of the Morro Bay Power Plant overlooking a scenic estuary
of pelicans, harbor seals and stately Morro Rock.</LD>
<LD>   Weak prices for electricity, lower demand, and more power plants
coming online in California have combined to cause a slowdown in
plant construction across the state.</LD>
<LD>   Though plant owner Duke Energy says all systems are go for
expanding its aging Morro Bay facility, construction shutdowns at
three out-of-state Duke units--and planned layoffs of managers
directly overseeing Morro Bay's $600-million-plus expansion--have
raised eyebrows in San Luis Obispo County.</LD>
<TE>   For 13 days this month, the 1,000-megawatt, natural gas-fueled
plant was idle because the state power grid did not need its
relatively expensive energy, according to officials at Duke.</TE>
<TE>   The company wants to replace the plant with a 1,200-megawatt power
station that would burn more cleanly and at lower cost. City leaders
in this tourist town of 10,000 support the expansion while a
grass-roots community group wants to stop it.</TE>
<TE>   The project manager and others associated with the expansion will
be laid off effective this week, as will the project manager for a
proposed Duke plant in Avenal, inland in adjacent Kings County.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Mullen, Western U.S. spokesman for the Charlotte, N.C.-based
company, stressed that Duke is merely being hit by the weak economy
afflicting the entire industry.</TE>
<TE>   Though there have been layoffs at Duke operations across the
country, he didn't give specifics. He estimated that the California
layoffs amount to just five to 10 people. He stressed that there is
already a new project manager overlooking Morro Bay and Avenal.</TE>
<TE>   "Our hope is by the time we get the California [plant expansion]
permits, we'll start seeing the market turn around," Mullen said.
"Right now, we are in a batten-down-the-hatches kind of mode. We're
trying to ride out the heavy weather of the current market
conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a 100-year-old company. We've learned to manage through
down cycles in the past," he explained.</TE>
<TE>   Duke hopes to tear down the 45-year-old Morro Bay plant and build
a unit with smaller, 145-foot stacks at the edge of the bay. The
project was proposed in 1998, and had an estimated cost of $500
million.</TE>
<TE>   With the price tag already $100 million more, Duke fears that it
could eventually approach $800 million by the time state permits are
granted and construction is complete.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the plant in the local environmental community tend
to oppose even its smaller-profile yet expanded capacity.</TE>
<TE>   "The shutdown came at the conclusion of a number of months of
failure by Duke to get the new plant permitted," said Jack McCurdy,
vice president of the alliance fighting the Morro Bay plant. "From a
financial standpoint, we think they are in serious trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Though Duke has its vocal foes in the community, the vote on a
Morro Bay initiative in the fall of 2000 showed that a majority of
voters in town supported the expansion and modernization. And the
city government has consistently concurred.</TE>
<TE>   With the plant's assessed valuation of $130 million, Duke is
already the third-largest property owner in San Luis Obispo County.
That valuation could jump to more than $700 million after a plant
expansion, significantly boosting property tax income for local
government.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the plant say they are resigned to it being there in
one form or another, so they have chosen to carry out the fight over
the details.</TE>
<TE>   One such detail will come up when a subcommittee of the California
Energy Commission hears testimony in Morro Bay on Oct. 24. The focus
will be Duke's ongoing efforts to let the new plant use a saltwater
cooling system, which staff regulators say would kill fish and crab
larvae.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever happens, Mullen said, he is confident there will still be
a plant in Morro Bay.</TE>
<TE>   "It just makes environmental sense to replace older power plants
with cleaner, more efficient ones," he said. "If we are not able to
do that, we will still have an operating plant here."</TE>

<LD>Two suspects were arrested early Saturday after a fight at an Irvine
apartment complex in which one man was stabbed and another injured by
punches and kicks to the head.</LD>
<LD>   Carlos Gomez, 19, of Tustin, and a 16-year-old male accomplice,
also from Tustin, were arrested at the scene. Gomez was booked into
Orange County Jail. The teenager was taken to Juvenile Hall.</LD>
<LD>   Irvine police said Gomez stabbed John Fagardo, 19, during an
argument at a party and tried to flee with his younger companion.
Sebastian Ortiz, 18, went to Fagardo's aid and was attacked when he
pursued the two suspects.</LD>
<TE>   Fagardo was in good condition at a local hospital, and Ortiz was
treated and released at the scene. Both are Irvine residents.</TE>

<HD>Really Taking Care of Mater Dei</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Some lives have a symmetry to them. Long or short, good or bad,
sometimes what has come before in a person's life blends seamlessly
with what comes at the end.</LD>
<LD>   Not to put too fine a point on it, but Josef D'Heygers may be
living just that kind of life. In broad strokes, he has been an
anonymous man--a Belgian shoemaker for most of the first half of his
life, a caretaker at Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana for the last
half of it.</LD>
<LD>   But to say he was invisible to most of us is not to say he was
unimportant. His duties at Mater Dei, the county's preeminent Roman
Catholic high school, have put him in contact with thousands of
people over the years. He was the man, beginning in 1956 when he came
to America, who opened the Mater Dei doors at 5 a.m. for the bakers
who brought bread and who closed the gates at night. He was the man
who maintained the grounds, cleaned the gym and drove the nuns
around.</LD>
<TE>   Unmarried and childless, D'Heygers, now 87, made Mater Dei his
family, thankful for the pittance he made when he started and for the
modest sums he made down through the years. His first quarters
consisted of a cot in an unused school restroom. For many years, it
was a trailer on campus, and now the school has provided him with an
apartment above the campus ministry center.</TE>
<TE>   And in this fall season of 2002, D'Heygers has put all those years
into perspective--for himself and for the school.</TE>
<TE>   He has donated, upon his death, a six-figure contribution that is
among the largest in the schools' recent $18.7-million fund-raising
drive. Neither D'Heygers nor the school will reveal the amount, but
in listing the major donors according to the size of their gift,
D'Heygers is among the 10 leading contributors.</TE>
<TE>   The poor man who became a rich man has amazed and delighted school
officials and made D'Heygers a bit of a media celebrity. He's done
two newspaper interviews and been featured on an L.A. TV broadcast.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't look to be famous," he says in a Dutch accent still
almost impenetrable to American ears. "But, in another way, I like
it. I'm getting old and it's a great feeling that I lived a good
life."</TE>
<TE>   The school's expansion consists of three new buildings. One of
them includes a clock tower that will forever bear D'Heygers' name.</TE>
<TE>   "I think when he started he was making $200 a month," says school
spokeswoman Christine DeBaun. "He never asked for raises but he
always got them, but he probably never made more than $1,000 a month,
because he had free room and board."</TE>
<TE>   D'Heygers says he realized at 65 that he was generating income.
With pension income both from America and from Belgium, D'Heygers
began investing under a friend's watchful eye.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the kindly man who seldom left campus and who
seemed never to buy anything except a movie ticket and (once) a car,
apparently was saving his money. "His mother always said, save, save,
save," DeBaun says. "Mater Dei was his whole world. He lives for the
kids--that includes the kids who are now 50 years old and the ones
who are here now."</TE>
<TE>   D'Heygers doesn't go to Mater Dei games anymore but can often be
seen walking the grounds. He says the students today are as friendly
and mannered as those of a generation or two ago.</TE>
<TE>   D'Heygers was 41 when he first laid eyes on Mater Dei, then just a
6-year-old school with tumbleweeds on the grounds. "It seemed small,"
he recalls. "It needed a lot of work to fix it."</TE>
<TE>   From the closest vantage point of anyone, he has seen it grow to a
school of 2,100 students. In a society where people come and go--and
often forget where they came from--D'Heygers has left a legacy simply
by staying put and not forgetting who first took him in.</TE>
<TE>   "I've lived so long," he says. "My last thought will be of the
school."</TE>

<DH>Santa Paula: Task force aims to identify problem cases
early and keep at-risk students on track to a high school diploma.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's 11:30 a.m., and Santa Paula Police Officer Michelle Velasco
stands at the door of the mobile home, knocking.</LD>
<LD>   She rings the doorbell. She knocks again.</LD>
<LD>   After about five minutes, a teenager saunters to the door.</LD>
<TE>   "Hi," the 34-year-old officer says. "Why aren't you in school?"</TE>
<TE>   The boy tells Velasco he was sick. He got food poisoning, and
that's why he hasn't been to class in two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   It's a line she's heard before.</TE>
<TE>   "You look OK now," she says. "Why don't I give you a ride there?"</TE>
<TE>   This is what she does. Student by student, home by home, she has
spent the last two years trying to keep Santa Paula's most at-risk
teenagers in class.</TE>
<TE>   Now, school officials are working to connect her daily efforts in
combating truancy with a broader, more long-term project: attacking
the root problems they believe cause many students to give up on high
school.</TE>
<TE>   Velasco is part of a new task force in Santa Paula that joins
people from law enforcement, courts, school districts and social
service agencies to tackle issues facing at-risk youth.</TE>
<TE>   The goal, officials said, is to steer young people away from drugs
and violence and give them the support they need to make it through
high school. That goal will only get more difficult in two years,
when students will be forced to pass a rigorous high school exit exam
before they can graduate.</TE>
<TE>   "If they can just finish, then they at least have that high school
diploma to fall back on," Velasco said. "We are trying to ensure that
more kids get that chance."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, a record number of ninth-graders were expelled from
Santa Paula High School--many within the first few days of classes,
said district Supt. Bill Brand.</TE>
<TE>   Although the numbers were comparatively small--25 students out of
1,200--they jolted him.</TE>
<TE>   After all, these were 13- and 14-year-old kids, Brand said.
Typically, the school expels eight to 10 students a year.</TE>
<TE>   "All expulsion does is take the student and put him out of the
system," he said. "That's not doing anything for the community or the
student."</TE>
<TE>   Although expelled students can continue their educations at
alternative schools, it's harder to keep track of their progress.</TE>
<TE>   Because education codes mandate that students be expelled for
certain crimes, Brand said his only choice was to work on the issues
at the front end through the task force.</TE>
<TE>   The effort is divided into four areas: improving school
attendance, reducing substance abuse, preventing violence and
increasing parent involvement.</TE>
<TE>   Strategies include personal attendance plans for every child
beginning in sixth grade, creation of nonviolent conflict management
and peer mediation programs at all schools, support groups for young
students and regular parent training sessions.</TE>
<TE>   The group is still planning how to implement many of the ideas.
But signs of change are evident at Santa Paula High.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks before classes began this year, the school held an
information session for parents, telling them their rights and
responsibilities related to truancy, that drew hundreds.</TE>
<TE>   And an improved system of tracking absent students that Velasco
developed over the summer has enabled her to catch habitually truant
students much sooner.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, a teenager could skip class dozens of times before
anyone in the attendance office noticed, Velasco said. By that point,
it was often too late to get the student back on track.</TE>
<TE>   Velasco said the Ventura County district attorney's office is a
key partner in the project. In the last two years, it has stepped up
efforts to prosecute truant students and their parents.</TE>
<TE>   The truancy policies should get even more enforcement capability
this year, Velasco said, because the high school created its own
student attendance review board--a panel of adults that puts students
on contracts and imposes sanctions in an attempt to keep them going
to school. Sanctions might include fines, community service or
mandatory tutoring.</TE>
<TE>   Parents, meanwhile, could be fined or sentenced to parenting
classes.</TE>
<TE>   Velasco, barely 5 feet 2 and seven months' pregnant, said she
needs that backing when she goes around Santa Paula knocking on
doors. That is why the task force is so important, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems there were some holes, but we have spent some time
patching up those holes, and making sure we don't lose anyone through
the cracks," she said. "It seems to be working."</TE>

<HD>L.A. Holds Picnic to Say 'Thank You' to Volunteers</HD>

<LD>Everett Littlefield watched the devastation of the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks unfold before him on television. He saw the smoking ruins in
New York, the stricken faces of survivors at the Pentagon, the
wreckage on a field in Pennsylvania.</LD>
<LD>   "I asked myself, 'What is going to be my response to this?' " the
67-year-old Silver Lake resident said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Before the dust had even cleared, he headed to the Los Angeles
Fire Department to sign up as a volunteer to aid injured people at
large-scale emergencies such as earthquakes and riots. He is now
trained to do field triage as part of a volunteer corps formed in
1987.</LD>
<TE>   Littlefield, a retired set builder for UCLA's theater arts
program, was among the 2,000 volunteers and guests enjoying an annual
picnic Saturday at Lake Balboa in Encino that was held to thank them
for the countless hours they've donated to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   He views his volunteer work as a call to duty, "like the
military," and said it has added a new dimension to his retirement
years.</TE>
<TE>   "Like most working people, I spent my life competing with
everyone," he said. "As a volunteer, my task is to cooperate with
everyone."</TE>
<TE>   There are about 25,000 city volunteers, including 11,000--mostly
coaches--in the Department of Recreation and Parks alone. They
include greeters at Los Angeles International Airport, crossing
guards for school children, and citizen surveillance team members who
alert police to crimes in progress.</TE>
<TE>   Picnic participants said they became volunteers for a variety of
reasons, from supporting cherished pastimes and participating in
important causes to passing the time and making a difference in a
small but important way.</TE>
<TE>   Harriet Segurson loves books. She loves to run her fingers over
them, examine the "About the Author" blurbs, admire the infinite
variety of their covers. The retired Los Angeles Unified School
District teacher has been a bookworm her whole life.</TE>
<TE>   "When I retired, I knew there would be a lot of empty space in
front of me," said Segurson, 64, a West Hills resident. So she went
to the Platt branch of the city library in Woodland Hills and the
librarian eagerly "snapped me up" before she had even filled out the
required paperwork.</TE>
<TE>   Watching his son play on a city-sponsored basketball team made
Kirk Ridd, 40, of Sherman Oaks start thinking that he could make a
difference, one young life at a time.</TE>
<TE>   "Coaches on school teams often just put the best kids on the
floor," said Ridd, who owns a music recording studio. "But the city's
program emphasizes sportsmanship over winning."</TE>
<TE>   Ann Frontiera wanted to "give something back to society" after
getting a college education "practically tuition-free" at UCLA. The
68-year-old San Pedro resident has been an information desk volunteer
at the Maritime Museum for 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell people where the restroom is," she explained
matter-of-factly. The payoff is that she gets to meet people from all
over the world because cruise ships dock nearby. "Besides," she said,
"if I didn't spend time volunteering, I would just go to stores and
spend money."</TE>

<HD>Stage Set for More Port Labor Strife</HD>
<DH>Trade: Cargo operations are scheduled to resume after a
36-hour lockout by employers, but signs of progress are scant in
union contract dispute.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE and NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>West Coast ports were set to resume cargo operations today after a
36-hour lockout by employers. But with no progress made in the
contract dispute that led to the closure, the stage was set for more
labor strife and congestion.</LD>
<LD>   Terminal operators closed the ports Friday night, saying they
wanted to have a "cooling-off" period in response to work slowdowns
staged by the union to gain leverage in contract negotiations, which
are now in their fifth month.</LD>
<LD>   The union denied that it had orchestrated slowdowns, saying it
merely urged members to refuse overtime and to strictly follow safety
rules. At a rally Saturday near the Port of Los Angeles, dockworkers
and supporters from the community angrily claimed that the shipping
lines created the crisis to discredit the union, and said the lockout
was unwarranted and unfair.</LD>
<TE>   As the ports stood eerily silent Saturday afternoon, a spokesman
for the International Longshore and Warehouse Union said members
would return to the docks this morning as requested. But in a
telephone interview, spokesman Steve Stallone said members would
continue to work under the same safety guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, he said, so-called "steady" clerks who normally
report to the same job site every day would instead report to
dispatch halls for job orders--leading to the possibility of clerks
being assigned to unfamiliar workplaces and slowing cargo operations.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents shipping lines and
terminal operators at the 29 major West Coast cargo ports, said that
if the steady clerks fail to report for work, and if further
slowdowns are detected, it would consider the union's response a
strike.</TE>
<TE>   "We just talked to the union's international officers and asked
them not to do those things," association President Joseph Miniace
said Saturday afternoon. "So we will just see. If they do not give us
labor, then that's a strike. And if there's a strike, the gates would
be locked. I'd be bitterly disappointed if this turns into a mess
tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   The West Coast ports move an estimated $300 billion in imports and
exports annually--about 60% through the ports of Los Angeles and Long
Beach--and economists said a protracted shutdown would be
economically devastating.</TE>
<TE>   Miniace met with ILWU President James Spinosa and other top union
executives over lunch Saturday, but neither side reported progress on
the core issues separating them. Negotiations have bogged down over
the control of information flowing through the ports, which has
changed rapidly with the use of scanners, sensors and other new
technology. The union also wants to expand its jurisdiction to
nonunion computer operators, which employers have resisted.</TE>
<TE>   No negotiations are currently scheduled.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Hurtgen, director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation
Service, traveled to San Francisco on Friday in an attempt to help
break the tension. But a spokesman for Hurtgen said Saturday that
neither the union nor the maritime association had contacted him.</TE>
<TE>   Association spokesman Steve Sugerman said the employers group was
willing to use mediation. ILWU spokesman Stallone said he was not
aware of any contact between the union and mediators.</TE>
<TE>   Stallone said the association's concerns about steady clerks were
overblown, and that any clerks dispatched from the hiring hall could
perform the work.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be enough people at the hall waiting to fill as many
orders as there are to give," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, traffic snarled at the gates of ports from San Diego to
Seattle as the association reported productivity drops of 30% to 90%.
Crane operators who normally move 25 to 30 containers off ships in an
hour were moving only three an hour, Sugerman said.</TE>
<TE>   One shipping line president estimated the cost of each idled ship
at $30,000 a day. Miniace said the association is tracking the cost
of the combined slowdowns and lockout, but said an estimate was not
available. "Each day they work slower, the growth of problems is
exponential," he said. "Containers stack up on the terminal, truckers
don't have room to drop off their loads. Pretty soon you've got an
intermodal disaster."</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, several heavily laden cargo ships made their way
toward the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, but their crews were
forced to anchor far from the docks. Eight ships had arrived since
the beginning of the lockout, four each anchored outside the ports of
Los Angeles and Long Beach. Another seven were scheduled to arrive
from Saturday afternoon through this morning.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Marine Exchange said there had been no
problems and, with 59 anchorages inside and outside of the port
breakwaters, there was plenty of room for more.</TE>
<TE>   The quiet port was a strange contrast to the normal bustle at the
waterfront. Huge cranes that would have been unloading as many as
three dozen ships were idle, a sight strange enough to draw one crane
operator back to the massive new Pier 400 at the Port of Los Angeles
on his birthday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice down here today. Quiet, and you can breathe for a
change without the fumes," said the operator, who asked that his name
not be used. "This would all be very busy right now. This is very
strange."</TE>
<TE>   In Wilmington, a group called Friends of Labor held a rally that
drew about 250 dockworkers and community supporters. They handed out
fliers targeting merchants that belong to the West Coast Waterfront
Coalition. The union has accused the group of being closely aligned
with the association.</TE>
<TE>   Activists volunteered to leaflet the merchants, including
Wal-Mart, Target and Home Depot, starting today and to ask shoppers
not to buy while the labor dispute continued.</TE>
<TE>   Leading the Wilmington rally was Diane Middleton, 59, a community
activist and attorney who represents injured dockworkers.</TE>
<TE>   She questioned the association's characterization of a slowdown,
and said workers have been putting in more time than usual lately
because of heavy cargo loads. "It looks more like a speed-up to me,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Other port community residents, ranging from a chiropractor to a
boys' club manager, joined in the pro-union rally, saying their jobs
depend on the union wages earned by longshore members.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the people who keep our community strong," Middleton
said of the longshore workers, who earn $80,000 to $150,000 annually
with overtime. "It's strong because of longshore wages."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the shipping lines and terminal operators that comprise
the maritime association have been hurting financially because of an
excess of shipping capacity that has forced them to cut rates.</TE>

<LD>Mothers and men sobbed as Brenda Florence, a sorrowful yet resilient
parent, spoke with her eyes hidden behind dark sunglasses in front of
the Inglewood City Hall on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "Somehow or another, we must go on," she told the crowd of nearly
50 people, including many parents of slain children, who gathered to
remember Florence's three sons, who were killed within a week of one
another last year.</LD>
<LD>   Former Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard Parks and Inglewood Mayor
Roosevelt Dorn also attended the rally, sponsored by the Stop the
Violence, Increase the Peace Foundation.</LD>
<TE>   The tribute was also a plea to the community, made by parents,
activists and church leaders, to remember other victims and prevent
further bloodshed.</TE>
<TE>   "We have all been touched by violence," said Parks, whose
granddaughter, Lori Gonzalez, was killed on May 28, 2000, an innocent
bystander caught between two gangs in the parking lot of a fast-food
restaurant in southwest Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Three white candles were positioned in front of the podium, which
was decorated with pictures of Florence's three sons. Christopher
Florence, 21, was shot on Sept. 28, 2001, as he was driving in
Inglewood. Two days later, his brothers Torry, 29, and Michael, 27,
were shot as they waited inside a car at a red light. The three
brothers were not gang members, according to police.</TE>
<TE>   Four pictures of other victims were positioned against a wall in
front of the City Hall. One was of Parks' granddaughter. Another
showed a man named Steven Eric Gray, and it read: "Aug. 24, 1966 to
June 22, 2002." One photo showed a smiling boy, with the words "My
Beloved Mijo" written on top of the frame. The fourth showed a young
man, Tony Scott, who was killed Aug. 3, 1998. The word "unsolved" was
written beneath his portrait.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon Johnson said she can relate to Florence's pain, although
she said losing three children at once must be unbearable.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson clutched photos of her son, Andre Morgan, showing his
junior high school graduation and the moment he kissed his baby
sister in the hospital right after she was born.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan, a Crenshaw High School senior and honor roll student, was
killed Nov. 26, 2001, after a gunman approached him in the 600 block
of East Arbor Vitae Street and shot him repeatedly.</TE>
<TE>   A sad and bitter father, Carlos Monroe, distributed fliers asking
for information on the slaying of his son, Ezzat "Darrin" Monroe, 18.
Monroe was a football and basketball player and swimmer. He was shot
Aug. 24, 2002, in a parking lot, and he died the next day.</TE>
<TE>   Gloria Montana, who lost her 19-year-old son, Phillip Shaw, on
March 7, 1997, approached Florence after the ceremony. "I just want
you to know, I understand what you are going through. I had a son
too," she said. "It will never be the same." The two women hugged and
cried.</TE>
<TE>   Khalid Shah, executive director of the Stop the Violence, Increase
the Peace, a nonprofit group that works with at-risk youth and
provides victims' assistance, called the deaths examples of "urban
terrorism." He said such killings deserve as much attention as the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks or the videotaped beating of an Inglewood
teenager by police.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the ceremony, Mayor Dorn promised to begin plans to
build a monument in Inglewood that will feature the names of victims
lost to violence.</TE>

<HD>Another New Start for Simon</HD>
<DH>Politics: He vows at state GOP convention that he'll finish
strong. 'We're on the verge of a surge!'</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Gubernatorial hopeful Bill Simon Jr. sought to rally Republican
loyalists Saturday with a pungent assault on Democrat Gray Davis,
acknowledging at the same time the skepticism weighing on his
underdog campaign.</LD>
<LD>   With just over five weeks left until election day, Simon vowed to
invigorate his effort with a new wave of television advertising and
an effort to reach beyond the kind of party faithful who flocked to
the state GOP convention in Garden Grove. But there were few signs of
how he intended to do so. Speaking to reporters after headlining
Saturday's luncheon, Simon expressed opposition to several bills just
signed into law by Gov. Davis, saying he would have vetoed measures
to encourage stem cell research, expand family leave and crack down
on firearms--all positions with broad appeal to California's
philosophical middle.</LD>
<LD>   Privately, the campaign acknowledged it was expecting
get-out-the-vote help soon--and possibly cash and an
endorsement--from the National Rifle Assn.</LD>
<TE>   Throughout the convention, which began Friday, Simon's advisors
and state party operatives strived, with varying degrees of success,
to put on a show of unity and good cheer.</TE>
<TE>   Working behind the scenes, GOP leaders managed to quash a
dissident group's effort to embarrass President Bush and his
California allies in a feud over internal party operations and the
president's appointment of federal judges. Resolutions on the two
matters were tabled through parliamentary means.</TE>
<TE>   But the Simon team was less successful papering over the dissent
within its own camp, hosting a news conference that featured his
feuding advisors scarcely bothering to hide their mutual animosity.
They acknowledged a failure to establish an image of Simon in the
minds of most voters and skirted questions about the financial
commitment the multimillionaire candidate is prepared to make to his
own candidacy. So far, Simon has loaned his campaign roughly $9
million and advisors said only that they are convinced they will have
the money needed "to effectively communicate" during the campaign's
final stretch, as strategist Sal Russo put it.</TE>
<TE>   The best news, Russo said, was that Simon remains competitive
despite repeated missteps and millions of dollars in negative Davis
advertising--a theme the campaign promised to take to the airwaves
and Simon enunciated in Saturday's keynote.</TE>
<TE>   The buoyant candidate arrived at the convention hotel to a
marching band's oom-pah choruses of "Louie, Louie." He took two
passes through the atrium lobby, grinning and glad-handing his way
amid a throng of sign-waving supporters. "Time for a surge, don't you
think?" he asked one well-wisher. "We're on the verge of a surge!"</TE>
<TE>   In his formal remarks Simon flayed Davis for everything from the
state electricity crisis--here the lights were dimmed in the hotel
ballroom in a bit of theatrics--to his budget policies to his
aggressive fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   "In 38 days, we are going to bring new leadership to California,"
Simon told the audience of several hundred convention delegates and
guests. "We are going to restore honor and dignity to the governor's
office just as President George W. Bush has restored it to the Oval
Office. And we are going to take back our government from a failed
career politician and put the destiny of California into the hands of
our people once again."</TE>
<TE>   Noting that California had recently fallen behind France and lost
its claim to be the world's fifth-largest economy--at least by one
statistical measure--Simon taunted, "I know of a way to get France
back to No. 6: Let's have Gray Davis go run France!"</TE>
<TE>   More seriously, Simon acknowledged, albeit indirectly, the
skepticism that has shadowed his campaign since he pulled an upset in
the March primary by romping past former Los Angeles Mayor Richard
Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   He spoke of those who doubted his candidacy before, and
acknowledged many doubt it still. He spoke of the "summer
doldrums"--drawing knowing snickers--when his campaign was plagued by
a multimillion-dollar fraud verdict, since overturned, and he faced
controversies over his tax returns and varied positions on gay
rights. And he conceded that, among many pundits at least, the
California Republican Party is seen as hopelessly crippled and his
campaign as hopelessly behind.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 5, he vowed, "We are going to send a message to the entire
nation, that the party of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush is alive
and well in California."</TE>
<TE>   The involvement of the NRA, the country's premier gun owners
group, could provide an important boost to the Simon campaign, which
is struggling for cash and counting on an exceedingly low turnout on
election day. That makes each party's get-out-the-vote efforts
particularly important.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, however, gun control has wide support in
California, particularly among the female voters and suburbanites
needed to win statewide office.</TE>
<TE>   The NRA was angered by a law signed last week by Davis that
removes liability protection for gun manufacturers, according to
Republican sources, who said the group may give up to $50,000 to
Simon in addition to its help turning out sympathetic voters.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what their involvement is going to be, but we
welcome their support," said Mark Miner, a spokesman for the Simon
campaign. "They encourage safe and legal use of firearms. Bill Simon
is a strong believer in following existing laws to punish criminals
who illegally use guns."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to reporters on Saturday, the GOP nominee said he would
not have signed the gun liability law. Simon has previously said he
supports current gun control laws, but would not expand them.</TE>
<TE>   As Republicans gathered just a mile or so from Disneyland, the
local congresswoman--Democratic Rep. Loretta Sanchez of Garden
Grove--held a news conference at a nearby hotel to praise Davis and
assail Simon's business record.</TE>
<TE>   Garry South, the chief strategist for Davis' campaign, caused a
stir and drew a battery of hecklers when he crashed the GOP
convention and held court in the lobby for more than two dozen
reporters. He scoffed at the Simon campaign's assertions that
Saturday marked a new beginning. "Every time they say they've turned
a corner" it turns out to be "a dead end," South said.</TE>

<LD>Residents have been told to boil water for at least five minutes
before drinking it or cooking with it. City officials issued the
warning after city water tested positive for E. coli and coliform
bacteria.</LD>
<LD>   Four of eight samples taken earlier this week from wells that
supply water to about 16,000 households and businesses tested
positive for coliform bacteria. Two tested positive for E. coli.</LD>
<LD>   Mark Lightcap, Chico district manager for the California Water
Service Co., said city officials believe the samples were false
positives, but issued the warning because they wanted to "err on the
side of caution."</LD>

<HD>Battle Lines Are Drawn Over Growth Lines</HD>
<DH>Simi Valley: Measure's backers say '98 anti-sprawl law
didn't go far enough. City officials feel betrayed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the first anti-sprawl initiative was proposed in Simi Valley in
1998, then-Mayor Greg Stratton did what he thought was best for his
city. He voted for it.</LD>
<LD>   Now, slow-growth advocates want another crack at the city's
growth-control law, hoping to give voters a say over two proposed
housing developments in neighboring canyons. While Stratton once
helped activists draw urban growth boundaries around his city, he is
now busy drawing battle lines.</LD>
<LD>   "We sat with them and figured this out, and now they're saying
four years later, 'We had our fingers crossed,' " said Stratton, who
is retired from the council and is heading up the campaign to defeat
Measure B. "I don't like to do business like that. You work with
someone, and you would think that meant you had an understanding."</LD>
<TE>   Proponents of the measure, however, don't see it that way.</TE>
<TE>   Politics is an evolving process, they say, and what seemed like a
good growth boundary in 1998 is no longer good enough in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't realize the full scope of the development plans," said
Kevin Conville, spokesman for the Simi Valley group backing the
initiative. "We've been asked continually why we weren't more
aggressive the first time around."</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley's was one of four growth-control measures--known as
the Save Open Space and Agricultural Resources initiatives--that were
negotiated and placed on local ballots four years ago. The ordinances
require voter approval before a city can annex land for development.</TE>
<TE>   Measure B is an attempt to reclaim some of the land that could be
developed under Simi Valley's existing ordinance, said Bill Fulton, a
Ventura-based regional planning expert. SOAR leaders predict that
Simi Valley won't be the last city to attempt such a change as
sentiment against urban sprawl continues to grow throughout Ventura
County. The Simi Valley initiative is intended to give voters more
latitude about future growth.</TE>
<TE>   "SOAR created a perception that people could vote on more things
than the law actually allowed," said Richard Francis, an Oxnard
attorney who wrote most of the SOAR laws passed in the county since
1995. "We're now trying to make the law conform with those
perceptions."</TE>
<TE>   Driving the movement in Simi Valley, proponents say, is the
public's desire to vote on two major development proposals: a
1,600-home project on 2,439 acres of land in upper Alamos Canyon
owned by Unocal Corp. and a 550-unit project in Runkle Canyon that
includes affordable housing for seniors. Both pieces of land are
outside of city limits but within its growth boundary, meaning that
the projects require only City Council approval.</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley leaders, most of whom are conservative Republicans
with business backgrounds, already have given both developers
preliminary approval to continue moving ahead with their plans.</TE>
<TE>   Measure B would halt that process, prohibiting development on any
land adjacent to the growth boundary, including the Unocal and Runkle
projects--without first the approval of Simi Valley voters.</TE>
<TE>   Slow-growth advocates in Simi Valley are most concerned about the
Unocal plan, not only because of the scope of the project but also
because they see the Alamos Canyon land as valuable open space.</TE>
<TE>   The land, just north of the Ronald Reagan Freeway, is a patchwork
of scrub-covered hills, oak-studded valleys and canyons. Unocal is
proposing to build a 399-acre industrial business park, 42-acre
cemetery and a residential development including as many as 1,600
homes in the canyon. Plans also call for saving about 1,400 acres of
open space, city officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "What our community should be looking at for Alamos Canyon is a
site for a regional park, not a huge commercial and industrial
development," Conville said. "It's sick."</TE>
<TE>   But those who oppose Measure B--including all five council
members, the Simi Valley Chamber of Commerce, the city school
district and park district officials--say the Unocal and Runkle
projects are key to ensuring the city's success as a vibrant,
job-rich community over the next 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the next growth area," said Mayor Bill Davis, who said
he feels betrayed by the new SOAR measure. "You have state guidelines
that say you must build your fair share of housing, and we could not
even get close to reaching those numbers if these two pieces of
property go away."</TE>

he feels betrayed by the new SOAR measure. "You have state guidelines
that say you must build your fair share of housing, and we could not
even get close to reaching those numbers if these two pieces of
property go away."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents also argue that voters should be aware that Measure B
could backfire and result in the kind of ugly development that no one
wants.</TE>
<TE>   The argument is that changing the growth boundary would encourage
developers to bypass the City Council entirely and go to the Ventura
County Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Although the land may be zoned as open space by the county, that
designation doesn't stop other uses, including ranchette-style homes,
a mining operation or even a landfill or jail, said Stratton.</TE>
<TE>   So, if Measure B passes and a proposed subdivision is shot down by
voters, those other uses may become more attractive to landowners,
Stratton said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of really ugly things that can be put out there,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Francis and Conville, however, both insist there is no basis for
such fears. It's unreasonable to suspect that the county and SOAR are
in cahoots on a nefarious plot to destroy Simi Valley, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's akin to saying, 'If Measure B passes, aliens from Mars will
come here and suck our brains out,' " Conville said. "Anything is
possible."</TE>
<TE>   But if Simi Valley residents don't trust the county, Stratton
said, it's because of the way the town was developed before it
incorporated in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   "While the county was busy working with Westlake, they were
letting developers wander into Simi Valley to build whatever they
felt like," Stratton said. "That's why so many people in Simi Valley
are upset about this."</TE>
<TE>   Conville drives all over Los Angeles County for his job as a sales
representative but contends the worst traffic he sees all day is on
the Ronald Reagan Freeway in Simi Valley during rush hour.</TE>
<TE>   "With any more expansion, traffic is just going to be that more
horrendous," he said. "It's a degradation of our quality of life
throughout Ventura County."</TE>
<TE>   He grew up in Simi Valley, and believes there is a strong
disconnect between the majority of the city's residents and their
elected council members. That theory is based mostly on his role as a
signature-gatherer for SOAR: Volunteers collected 9,100 names in 1998
and 8,100 this year.</TE>
<TE>   "People are tired of seeing the constant building," Conville said.</TE>
<TE>   It's a sentiment that seems to be spreading throughout the county.</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley's Measure B is one of three SOAR-related initiatives
on the November ballot. Ventura voters will decide the fate of a
1,390-home hillside development, and Santa Paula residents are being
asked whether the city should expand into rural Adams Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   Some Measure B supporters hope that the initiative will force
developers to present the city with better development proposals,
offering more open space and less density. Others are determined to
stop the city from getting bigger.</TE>
<TE>   But opponents question the level of involvement that people
outside of Simi Valley have had in the push for a new growth
boundary--namely Francis and Supervisor Steve Bennett, the architects
of SOAR.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not sure why we were so lucky to get their interest,"
Stratton said.</TE>
<TE>   Resident Michael Bain wrote in a letter to the editor: "Who do
Francis and Bennett think they are? They started this chaos of growth
boundaries and now they want to further restrict cities from moving
forward."</TE>
<TE>   Calling those arguments "ridiculous," Conville pointed to the El
Segundo-based Unocal Corp., a Los Angeles-based public relations firm
and the Seal Beach-based developer that are fighting Measure B.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is that the citizenry should have a say,"
Conville said. "The City Council is hellbent to approve these massive
projects that will expand Simi Valley, and you can't fight City
Hall--they've proven that time and time again."</TE>
<TE>   That's what the referendum process is for, Stratton said. Under
Measure B, Simi Valley voters will find themselves in the same
position Ventura and Santa Paula residents are in now: going up
against a wealthy developer in a future election campaign, he argued.</TE>
<TE>   "There may be a way to stop something, but this doesn't do it,"
Stratton said. "It just changes the battlegrounds."</TE>

<HD>2 Oxnard Teens Stabbed in Gang Fight in Fillmore</HD>
<DH>Crime: One victim, 19, is reported in critical condition.
Deputies arrest three suspects.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 19-year-old Oxnard man was in critical condition after being
stabbed in the chest during a gang brawl Saturday outside a house in
Fillmore, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Luis Morales was hospitalized at the Ventura County Medical
Center. Sheriff's Department officials said his injuries were not
life-threatening.</LD>
<LD>   Morales' friend, Jesus Ramirez, 19, also of Oxnard, suffered a
minor stab wound in the leg during the fight. He was treated at the
same hospital and released.</LD>
<TE>   According to Sgt. Ernie Montagna, Morales and Ramirez arrived at a
friend's house in the 400 block of Old Telephone Road shortly after
midnight when they were confronted by several men in a car.</TE>
<TE>   Words were exchanged and a fight ensued, Montagna said. The fight
lasted a few minutes before the suspects fled.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County sheriff's deputies spotted the suspects' vehicle a
few blocks from the scene and arrested three men.</TE>
<TE>   Fillmore residents Hector Enrique, 36; Eddie Murillo, 25; and
Albert Martinez, 25, were each taken into custody on suspicion of
conspiracy and assault with a deadly weapon.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the melee remained under investigation, but
authorities said that all the men involved are either gang members or
associates of rival gangs from Oxnard and Fillmore.</TE>
<TE>   The stabbings mark the second serious act of gang violence in the
city in less than a month. Although dozens of gang members reside in
Fillmore, violence is more frequently reported in neighboring Santa

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Few who navigate Washington Boulevard between Culver City and Los
Angeles are aware that they are traversing the crossroads of a circus
ghost town, the erstwhile Barnes City.</LD>
<LD>   When Al G. Barnes, born Alpheus George Barnes Stonehouse,
established the winter home of his eponymous trained animal circus in
1919, west of what is now the San Diego Freeway between Washington
and Culver boulevards, he ushered in future circus stars and eager
fans. He managed to get the area incorporated, playing a little dirty
politics in the process, and he left a parade of broken hearts. For
nearly two decades, the Al G. Barnes Circus was an L.A. amusement
mecca--beginning as early as 1911 at Venice Beach. The circus was the
home of Tusko, an 8,000-pound elephant; Jack the Human Fly; and fat
Sally and her 112-pound sweetheart.</LD>
<TE>   Mabel Stark, the "world's only woman tiger trainer"--even though
there were others before her, including Martha Florine and Princess
Irene--and animal trainer Louis Roth got their starts under Barnes'
big top. But Barnes' life was like a theatrical high-wire act,
teetering between failure and acclaim. He spent more than half his
life in the spotlight of a real three-ring circus, fighting off
ex-wives, girlfriends, animal activists, charges of perjury and
income tax evasion, a paternity suit and personal injury suits, all
the while living on a fast track aboard a luxurious private train.</TE>
<TE>   Born on a farm in Ontario, Canada, in 1862, Barnes ran away from
home to begin a checkered career as a street peddler, roadshow
impresario and circus meister.</TE>
<TE>   In 1895, he arrived in Glenwood Springs, Colo., on a horse-drawn
wagon, armed with a squeaky phonograph and a motion-picture
projection machine. There, he met Dolly Barlow, who owned a small
farm. She sold it five years later for $2,700, when she married
Barnes. With the proceeds, they bought up several roadshows that
eventually became the Al G. Barnes Circus.</TE>
<TE>   In 1911, at the invitation of the Pacific Electric Railway and
Abbot Kinney's Venice of America Amusement Park, the Al G. Barnes
Circus rolled into town. Barnes and his company would return for the
winter after traveling around the West and Canada in the summer. He
and hundreds of performers, trainers, workers and animals would
arrive aboard his private train, each of its 40 cars named for a city
in Southern California. As an army of well-muscled roustabouts
pounded 15-pound sledgehammers onto tent stakes to pitch the big top,
the circus paraded through Los Angeles--elephants, horses, acrobats,
tigers--the whole glorious troupe.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone wanted to be part of the show. In 1912, Mabel Stark
bought a ticket to the circus while vacationing in Los Angeles. She
loved it so much that she chucked her nursing career. So apparent was
her rapport with furry creatures--and with Barnes--that he offered
her a job on the spot as a lion tamer. Over the years, she was
clawed, slashed and chewed 18 times, but she continued to tour the
world with different circuses--including about a decade with Barnes,
off and on.</TE>
<TE>   Even after entering semiretirement, she was the headline act at
the now-defunct Jungleland in Thousand Oaks, made famous in 1966 when
one of Stark's declawed lions took a bite out of Jayne Mansfield's
son while the actress was posing for publicity shots.</TE>
<TE>   During the circus' glory days, audiences cheered as Barnes rode
into the center ring astride Tusko the elephant. "Laaaaa-dieeeees and
gentlemen, boys and girls," he'd croon before introducing such greats
as cowboy Ben Pitti, a former member of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show
who transfixed the crowd with his trick riding, roping and knife
throwing. They also loved the Flying Letourneaus, female trapeze
artists who performed without a net. Patrons sat transfixed on hard
bleachers under the big tent to marvel at the fire-eaters, clowns,
magicians and Lotus, a giant hippopotamus. One day, Tommy the
elephant wandered away. Searchers finally found him mired in the La
Brea Tar Pits. Tommy's soul-mate, Freda, came to his rescue, pulling
him out with her trunk. But no sooner was he free than Freda slipped
into the muck. The loyal and grateful Tommy reached in and hauled her
onto solid ground.</TE>
<TE>   (Both elephants were last noted in 1933, pulling the stumps of
walnut trees out of the ground for an El Monte housing tract.)</TE>
<TE>   In 1919, as box office profits rolled in, Barnes bought 100 acres
of the Washington Boulevard property and began putting up permanent
buildings. But success, in and out of the ring, led to a long string
of women and heartache. During a five-year public battle in Los
Angeles divorce court--in which Barnes' wife Dolly accused him of
having many lovers and deserting her--Barnes took up with his
calliope player, Babe Eckhart.</TE>
<TE>   That relationship ended dramatically in 1919. When Barnes refused
to marry her, Babe shot and killed herself on the step of his private
Pullman in Idaho. For the rest of his life, Barnes carried around her
picture--much to the dismay of his other wives.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, after he and Dolly agreed on a $50,000 property
settlement, he up and married his bareback rider, Sarah Jane Hardigan
(or Hartigan; the proper spelling is a mystery). They had been an
item for some time and had at least one child when they wed.</TE>
<TE>   But their bliss didn't last. In 1923, Barnes got a Nevada divorce
charging Sarah Jane with battery: She'd chased him around a locked
cage with a horsewhip in front of thousands of spectators.</TE>
<TE>   When he left her, she slapped him with a paternity suit and began
a long and bitter fight contesting the divorce. The court battle
ended six years later with the Los Angeles Superior Court upholding
the Nevada decree. About the same time, Sarah Jane dropped the
paternity suit when Barnes admitted that two of her three children
were his.</TE>
<TE>   Perjury charges stemming from a tax-evasion case were dropped
after he paid the government almost $200,000 in back taxes. In 1926,
Long Beach animal-rights activists complained that Barney the
performing dog had an infected eye, a horse had a diseased hoof and
Tusko's toenails were too long and his chain too short. Barnes
steadfastly denied wrongdoing but complied with their requests to
remedy the problems.</TE>
<TE>   Over time, Barnes' winter-home neighbors began to resent him and
his entourage. The roar of his lions at feeding time could be heard
all the way to Ocean Park Avenue, now Glencoe. And his sometimes
disorderly employees did a swift business with local bootleggers.</TE>
<TE>   In February 1926, to protect his interests, Barnes and his cronies
voted to incorporate the area as Barnes City. Some of the 692
registered voters lived in adjacent neighborhoods, others were
bootleggers, and 254 were showmen who worked for Barnes. Virtually
the entire electorate--603 of the 692--approved of the incorporation.</TE>
<TE>   "Barnes changed his entire circus schedule so his show would play
at Barnes City on election day so the monkeys could vote without
leaving their cages," a proponent of incorporation opined.</TE>
<TE>   Barnes handpicked the fledgling city's first board of trustees and
made his brother the mayor. The officials were sworn in at City
Hall--an empty building at Louise and Centinela avenues that was the
focal point of continuing civic discord.</TE>
<TE>   Barnes City, population 2,500, existed only 14 months. Disgruntled
residents forced a new election, throwing the Barnes faction out of
office and unincorporating the town.</TE>
<TE>   It took the courts another three years to decide that this slice
of land belonged to the city of Los Angeles, not the unincorporated
area of the county.</TE>
<TE>   Angry over the townsfolks' revolt, Barnes led his troupe out of
town in 1927. When he returned to L.A. later that year, he moved the
circus to Valley Boulevard in Baldwin Park. Five years later,
Paramount Studios rented his new site to film "King of the Jungle,"
starring Buster Crabbe and Frances Dee.</TE>
<TE>   Barnes rarely found a deal he could refuse and, in 1929, he sold
the old-time tent circus to the American Circus Corp. for $1 million,
newspapers reported.</TE>
<TE>   The circus kept its name for almost another decade but was
swallowed up soon after the purchase by Ringling Bros. It remained in
Baldwin Park until 1938.</TE>
<TE>   In 1931, Barnes married for a third time, to Margaret Goldsborough
of Colorado. Six months later, at age 68, he died of pneumonia at his
Indio ranch.</TE>
<TE>   He attracted a troupe to his funeral, including all three
wives--current and past--and a contingent of circus performers. They
bade farewell as only performers can, with a special matinee in
Indio. A showman to the last.</TE>

<HD>Orange County Squeezed as Cheap Water Era Ends</HD>
<DH>Utilities: Pumping from local aquifer must be cut, outside

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County's water picture is growing increasingly dire.</LD>
<LD>   Although the amount has yet to be decided, officials announced
last week that municipal water agencies must reduce the amount of
water they draw from the aquifer that supplies the 2.2 million people
who live in central and northern Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   The impending cutbacks will leave cities from Anaheim to Irvine
more dependent on water imported from Northern California and the
Colorado River, sources that are increasingly drying up.</LD>
<TE>   This triple-whammy of reduced supply comes at a time when the
county's population is booming, and some scientists believe Southern
California is on the verge of a prolonged drought.</TE>
<TE>   Conservation measures and increased storage capacity have kept
county residents well-supplied with water so far. But if the drought
and worst-case supply scenarios unfold, soaring water bills, parched
brown lawns and dirty cars could become a reality as early as 2005.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a crisis... but it raises red flags," said Ron
Wildermuth, spokesman for Orange County Water District, which manages
the aquifer. "We can't keep continuing on this trend."</TE>
<TE>   Water agencies throughout Southern California are spending
billions of dollars to ensure the region's future water supply.</TE>
<TE>   Still, "it's all kind of coming home for everyone in Southern
California that the times of cheap and plentiful water are rapidly
ending," said Dave Kiff, assistant city manager of Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The local aquifer, which provides 75% of the drinking water for
northern and central Orange County, has been so over-tapped and
under-replenished that it has sunk down to 30 feet below sea level in
some parts of the county.</TE>
<TE>   Local officials appear to be unanimous in the view that some
reduction in the water drawn from beneath the ground will be
required. The question, which won't be answered until spring, is how
much.</TE>
<TE>   Under the worst-case scenario, cities would be forced to reduce
their reliance on local ground water from 75% to 57%, making up the
difference with higher-priced imported water, which could drive up
water bills for the average household by as much as $30 a year by
next year.</TE>
<TE>   Rainfall in Santa Ana was just over 3 inches last winter--less
than a quarter of average.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year was really a pretty severe drought. We haven't had big
water for the last couple years," said Glen MacDonald, an expert on
climate with UCLA's Institute of the Environment. "It's very
difficult to anticipate if this is a multiyear drought, and that's
the important thing."</TE>
<TE>   However, some scientists, including William Patzert, an
oceanographer with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,
believe this is the beginning of a prolonged drought. Patzert said a
large-scale change in ocean temperatures appears to be shifting into
a "cool phase" that could bring years--or even decades--of drought to
the region.</TE>
<TE>   "It's getting serious," Patzert said. "In Denver and Albuquerque,
they're rationing water. Of course, we're not, because we steal water
from everywhere else."</TE>
<TE>   Other states, including Nevada and Arizona, and the federal
government, are beginning to resist California's tendency to use more
than its water allocation. The state is under federal order to reduce
the water it takes from the Colorado River. Meanwhile, decreased
snowfall in the Sierra Nevada, pollutants that require dilution with
purer water, and environmental concerns that can curtail the flow of
river water mean there's less to import from Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   And the population will increase. Wildermuth said the state is
projected to add 15 million people, nearly half of that in Southern
California. Orange County is expected to receive 300,000 to 700,000
people. Each will use about 140 gallons of water every day."While
this is happening, the water industry is changing," Wildermuth said.
"It's more difficult today to build an in-stream dam [or] canals [to
carry more imported water]. The future is local and regional
projects, conservation and water efficiency."</TE>
<TE>   To cope with these issues, the Metropolitan Water District of
Southern California, OCWD and other agencies throughout the region
are committing well over $2 billion to ensure the adequacy of future
supplies.</TE>
<TE>   Another priority will be conservation. Although Southern
Californians use less water than others in the United States, there
is room for improvement. One of the first targets could be
over-watered lawns. "I'm worried, and I'm optimistic," said Kiff of
Newport Beach. "I'm worried about the cost because certainly the
rates are likely to go up, and I'm optimistic that we can respond
effectively by conserving."</TE>
<TE>   Pat Scanlon, the Southern California Water Co.'s district manager
in Orange County, added, "Look at all of the utilities. Water's the
cheapest and people are used to that. Those days are gone."</TE>

and worst-case supply scenarios unfold, soaring water bills, parched
brown lawns and dirty cars could become a reality as early as 2005.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a crisis ... but it raises red flags," said Ron
Wildermuth, spokesman for Orange County Water District, which manages
the aquifer. "We can't keep continuing on this trend."</TE>
<TE>   Water agencies throughout Southern California are spending
billions of dollars to ensure the region's future water supply.</TE>
<TE>   Still, "it's all kind of coming home for everyone in Southern
California that the times of cheap and plentiful water are rapidly
ending," said Dave Kiff, assistant city manager of Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The local aquifer, which provides 75% of the drinking water for
northern and central Orange County, has been so over-tapped and
under-replenished that it has sunk up to 30 feet below sea level in
some parts of the county.</TE>
<TE>   Local officials appear to be unanimous in the view that some
reduction in the water drawn from beneath the ground will be
required. The question, which won't be answered until spring, is how
much.</TE>
<TE>   Under the worst-case scenario, cities would be forced to reduce
their reliance on local ground water from 75% to 57%, making up the
difference with higher-priced imported water, which could drive up
water bills for the average household by as much as $30 a year by
next year.</TE>
<TE>   Rainfall in Santa Ana was just over 3 inches last winter--less
than a quarter of average.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year was really a pretty severe drought. We haven't had big
water for the last couple years," said Glen MacDonald, an expert on
climate with UCLA's Institute of the Environment. "It's very
difficult to anticipate if this is a multiyear drought, and that's
the important thing."</TE>
<TE>   However, some scientists, including William Patzert, an
oceanographer with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,
believe this is the beginning of a prolonged drought.</TE>
<TE>   Patzert said a large-scale change in ocean temperatures appears to
be shifting into a "cool phase" that could bring years--or even
decades--of drought to the region.</TE>
<TE>   "It's getting serious," Patzert said. "In Denver and Albuquerque,
they're rationing water. Of course, we're not, because we steal water
from everywhere else."</TE>
<TE>   Other states, including Nevada and Arizona, and the federal
government, are beginning to resist California's tendency to use more
than its water allocation.</TE>
<TE>   The state is under federal order to reduce the water it takes from
the Colorado River. Meanwhile, decreased snowfall in the Sierra
Nevada, pollutants that require dilution with purer water, and
environmental concerns that can curtail the flow of river water mean
there's less to import from Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is that there's a lot of people in Southern
California," Patzert said. "We haven't rationed anybody in the last
four years. We're using it like drunken sailors."</TE>
<TE>   And the population will increase. Wildermuth said the state is
projected to add 15 million people, nearly half of that in Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County is expected to receive 300,000 to 700,000 people.
Each will use about 140 gallons of water every day.</TE>
<TE>   "While this is happening, the water industry is changing,"
Wildermuth said. "It's more difficult today to build an in-stream dam
[or] canals [to carry more imported water]. The future is local and
regional projects, conservation and water efficiency."</TE>
<TE>   To cope with these issues, the Metropolitan Water District of
Southern California, OCWD and other agencies throughout the region
are committing well over $2 billion to ensure the adequacy of future
supplies.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't afford to take it for granted," said Adan Ortega Jr.,
MWD's vice president of external affairs.</TE>
<TE>   One of the world's most innovative water projects is being built
in Orange County. The water district and the Orange County Sanitation
District are working on a $600-million project to purify sewage and
make it as clean as bottled water.</TE>
<TE>   The first phase of the project is expected to be completed in 2007
and will create up to 72,000 acre-feet of water per year, or enough
to supply nearly 600,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really tailor-made for drought--it's locally controlled and
it's reliable, whether you have a drought or not," Wildermuth said.
"It diversifies the water portfolio."</TE>
<TE>   The agency is building catchment basins that will increase water
percolating into the ground.</TE>
<TE>   It is also installing pumps at the Santiago sand and gravel pits
which can capture and hold as much as 4.6 billion gallons of Santa
Ana River water to distribute to other percolation fields.</TE>
<TE>   Water officials throughout the region are proposing to build seven
desalination plants, which filter salt from seawater.</TE>
<TE>   These projects would cost at least $1 billion, but MWD is offering
subsidies to encourage their development.</TE>
<TE>   Plants have been proposed in Dana Point and Huntington Beach, as
well as in Los Angeles and San Diego counties. Ortega said
desalinated water will eventually fill 10% of the local water demand.</TE>
<TE>   MWD is also building a $1-billion pipeline through the San
Bernardino Mountains that will bring more water to the Southland.</TE>
<TE>   Another priority will be conservation. Although Southern
Californians use less water than others in the United States, there
is room for improvement.</TE>
<TE>   One of the first targets could be over-watered lawns. Most yards
are so drenched that if the excess were added up over a year, it
could cover the entire lawn with five feet of water. In addition to
straining water supplies, this also increases coastal pollution and
often kills the plants residents are trying to tend.</TE>
<TE>   Ortega of the MWD said if locals watered their yards more
carefully this would reduce water consumption by 10%. Shorter
showers, low-water-use toilets, showerheads and washers would also
help.</TE>
<TE>   Conservation is one of water officials' constant refrains. The
other is that residents must face increased water bills. "I'm
worried, and I'm optimistic," said Kiff of Newport Beach. "I'm
worried about the cost because certainly the rates are likely to go
up, and I'm optimistic that we can respond effectively by
conserving."</TE>
<TE>   Pat Scanlon, the Southern California Water Co.'s district manager
in Orange County, added, "Look at all of the utilities. Water's the
cheapest and people are used to that.... Those days are gone."</TE>

<HD>For $3 Million, Art Center Is Yours</HD>
<DH>Culture: The Port Hueneme building is often praised for its
design, but sits empty once again. Location has been its Achilles'
heel.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With a beachfront setting, top-notch acoustics and an intimate
atmosphere, the Dorill B. Wright Cultural Center had all the
necessary ingredients for success.</LD>
<LD>   Except for location.</LD>
<LD>   The Port Hueneme performing arts center's site--more than seven
miles from the Ventura Freeway--hampered efforts to attract sizable
crowds that would help generate enough cash to make it
self-supporting. Since it opened in 1983, the 564-seat theater
depended on subsidies from the city to keep operating. It was shut
down 10 years later in the midst of a city budget crunch.</LD>
<TE>   The center was finally sold in 2000 to a private entertainment
company run by Tracey Birdsall-Kall, an actress who planned to turn
it into a bustling film studio, movie theater and home to an
international film festival. But those lofty plans went awry, and the
building sits empty, the property again up for sale.</TE>
<TE>   Some local arts supporters--including the center's namesake,
81-year-old Dorill B. Wright--say the time may be right for a new
owner to step in and reopen the building as a performing arts center.</TE>
<TE>   They point to the county's growth over the last decade and the
success enjoyed by other regional arts venues as evidence that Port
Hueneme could finally support a performing arts center.</TE>
<TE>   Nestled between a park and a condominium complex on a quiet,
tree-lined street, the $2-million center was the dream of Port
Hueneme arts supporters, including Wright, who fought hard to bring a
theater to the city.</TE>
<TE>   But location proved to be its Achilles' heel.</TE>
<TE>   Times have changed, says Margaret Travers, director of the Ventura
County Arts Council. Census data show that the county's population
increased more than 84,000 between 1990 and 2000. And that rise means
more prospective patrons, she said.</TE>
<TE>   If new owners booked the right mix of performances and mounted an
aggressive marketing campaign, the center could become a thriving
cultural facility to rival those in Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure the location had an impact on whether it was successful
or not," Travers said. "But there are lots of things that are often
off the beaten path that people make a point of going to."</TE>
<TE>   The key would be to book the right acts for the venue's size, she
said. For example, the Wright center is not likely to attract
big-name acts such as Sheryl Crow or Bill Cosby, or bring in touring
Broadway musicals, as does the 1,800-seat Thousand Oaks Civic Arts
Plaza. But small theaters can still find a niche, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The Simi Valley Cultural Arts Center has made the most of its
240-seat theater, offering a mix of film screenings, plays and
popular concerts. "You have to analyze your audience," Travers said.
"And I suppose early on, you have to try a variety of [acts] to see
what will appeal to the broadest audience."</TE>
<TE>   Wright still hopes to see the center reopen as a performing or
visual arts venue. He likened the cultural center to a public library
or park, both which generate little revenue but enhance the quality
of life for area residents.</TE>
<TE>   For an arts venue to be successful, it must have support from the
city of Port Hueneme, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "You cannot operate one of these facilities at a profit, based on
ticket sales alone," he said. "You have to develop a community-based
support system that basically helps cover part of the operating
cost."</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks both help their arts centers. Simi
Valley pays the salaries of the center's full-time employees and, in
return, receives a percentage of the ticket sales. In Thousand Oaks,
the city partnered with the Alliance for the Arts, a private
nonprofit group that raises thousands of dollars each year for the
arts plaza.</TE>
<TE>   The city of Port Hueneme has the option to purchase the Wright
center, but Community Development Director Greg Brown said there are
no plans to do so.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, it's unlikely the city could afford the building's
asking price of nearly $3 million, he said. And with several other
performing arts centers around the county, it would be difficult to
compete, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Potential buyers have been few, mostly because of the building's
distance from Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an exceptional building," said Carl Alaniz, who is
representing Birdsall-Kall in the sale. "I'm surprised that it hasn't
sold yet. If this thing were sitting anywhere but Port Hueneme, it
would have been gone by now."</TE>

she was burned out with filmmaking.</TE>

<HD>Yosemite's New Superintendent Brings Track Record of
Getting Big Jobs Done</HD>
<DH>Recreation: Mike Tollefson is seen as a can-do
administrator who will carry out provisions of the park's
much-debated valley restoration plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When official word came last week that a leadership change was in
store at Yosemite, the reaction from the national park's legions of
admirers was swift--but far from certain.</LD>
<LD>   Was this, ecologists asked, a Bush administration run on the
environment? Would it sidetrack the Yosemite Valley restoration plan?
A few players even took to dissecting a press announcement for clues
to what the personnel shift might mean.</LD>
<LD>   But the story behind the departure of Supt. David Mihalic and
arrival of Mike Tollefson at one of America's most beloved, yet
battled-over parks is simple, insiders say.</LD>
<TE>   Top national park officials lost faith in Mihalic's desire to
speedily deliver on the key infrastructure projects that over the
next decade are intended to rejigger civilization's imprint on
Yosemite's crowded valley floor.</TE>
<TE>   Tollefson, 55, is seen as a can-do administrator with a track
record of getting the job done.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a fabulous thing for the valley plan," said John
Reynolds, who until his retirement in August served as the National
Park Service's western regional director. "If I had to choose someone
to ensure that the valley plan is carried out, it would be Mike
Tollefson."</TE>
<TE>   Reynolds and several others with a deep interest in Yosemite also
say they have seen no indications that the Bush administration is
angling to undermine the much-debated valley master plan, which was
pushed through in the waning months of the Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   "My radar remains on alert," said Jay Watson, the Wilderness
Society's California regional director. "But I don't think it will
happen, based on the character of Mike Tollefson. If the Bush
administration made a run at the valley plan, we'd oppose them with
every ounce of energy."</TE>
<TE>   Tollefson said he has been told by National Park Service Director
Fran Mainella that the valley plan's list of projects--ranging from
rejiggered roads to a revamped Yosemite Lodge and, most controversial
of all, shifting 65% of the day-use parking out of the valley
floor--is the top priority.</TE>
<TE>   "My marching orders are to implement it," he said in an interview
last week. But he admitted that, despite a five-year stint as
superintendent of neighboring Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks
in the latter 1990s, the ambitious plans for the Yosemite Valley
remain a bit murky to him. "I have heard there's controversy over the
plan," he said, "but I don't even know what it is."</TE>
<TE>   At Sequoia, Tollefson won plaudits for pushing through a
restoration effort that eliminated about 300 buildings around the
Giant Forest grove. The structures were replaced by new sequoias and
vegetation.</TE>
<TE>   For the last two years, Tollefson ran Great Smoky Mountains
National Park, which straddles the Appalachian Mountains. He was
credited with pushing a key biological study that cataloged scores of
insects and other creatures, as well as pushing forward a congestion
management plan at a park that is the nation's busiest, with more
than 10 million visitors a year. By contrast, Yosemite was visited by
about 3.5 million people last year.</TE>
<TE>   Some say Tollefson's experiences elsewhere won't translate at
Yosemite, a crown jewel of the National Park System and perhaps its
most politicized.</TE>
<TE>   "People care so much about Yosemite, being superintendent there is
like working in a fish bowl," said George Whitmore, the Sierra Club's
Yosemite committee chairman.</TE>
<TE>   Mihalic, who spent three years as Yosemite superintendent, was
slated to switch with Tollefson and become the leader at Great Smoky
Mountains. As of last week, Mihalic had not committed to making the
switch, park officials said. Mihalic did not return calls. Some park
staffers said he was considering retirement.</TE>
<TE>   During his tenure at Yosemite, Mihalic won kudos for helping
cement the valley plan. But critics said he could be gruff and
impersonal. When it came to getting the valley projects off the
ground, the efforts lagged, earning criticism in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Tollefson faces several challenges, among them persistent charges
that the valley plan smacks of elitism. While Yosemite Lodge is set
for significant reconstruction and is expected to see room rates
rise, the number of campsites in the valley is slated to be reduced
to about 500 from the 849 that existed before the disastrous flood of
1997.</TE>
<TE>   But the biggest controversy remains a plan to reduce traffic
congestion in the valley by cutting the number of day-use parking
spaces, currently about 1,650, by two-thirds. The 550 remaining
spaces would be clustered in one central spot. The plan envisions
more than doubling the park's shuttle bus fleet to help ferry most
day-use visitors from remote lots outside the valley.</TE>
<TE>   Tollefson may have an edge in trying to win over the biggest
opponent of the valley transportation plan: Rep. George Radanovich
(R-Mariposa). Radanovich said he thinks highly of Tollefson from his
days at Sequoia, where the congressman and park official worked well
together to iron out some tough issues.</TE>
<TE>   Watson said a key signpost of whether Tollefson is a success--or
if the Bush administration is meddling in the Clinton-era valley
planning document--will be progress made next year to hammer out the
fine details of the transportation plan.</TE>
<TE>   On the flip side, some of those who didn't prevail two years ago
in the fight over the valley plan are hopeful that Tollefson will
listen anew to their thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Hardy, who ran Yosemite's concession services for two decades
until he retired in 1993, hopes to sway Tollefson toward spreading
parking around Yosemite Valley to ease congestion.</TE>
<TE>   He also hopes that two campgrounds taken out by the 1997 flood
along the Merced River can be restored. The valley plan envisions
letting those 350 campsites be reclaimed by meadows and trees.</TE>
<TE>   Whitmore said he hopes Tollefson can be swayed on some details of
the valley plan. Right now, he said, the valley blueprint "is an
asphalt relocation plan" that shifts things around, but doesn't do
enough to reduce man's impact on one of nature's wonders. "He's got a
reputation as a man who will listen," Whitmore said. "We're hopeful."</TE>
