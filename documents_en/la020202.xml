<HD>A Certain Familiarity</HD>
<DH>The camaraderie behind 'Birthday Girl' is rooted in the
involvement of director Jez Butterworth's brothers Tom and Steve.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLEN BASKIN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite the dire fiscal straits of many dot-coms these days, it still
often seems that nearly anything your heart may desire is just a
keystroke or two away on the Internet. But an e-mail-order bride?</LD>
<LD>   "In Europe, this is actually a common phenomenon," says
writer-director Jez Butterworth. "Everybody knows somebody who knows
somebody who's done it."</LD>
<LD>   In "Birthday Girl," which opened Friday, that somebody is
mild-mannered English bank clerk John Buckingham (Ben Chaplin). "I
think he's a very shy man, very lonely and socially inept," Chaplin
observes of his character. "He has no family to talk about or share
anything with, no friends to speak of other than at work." And then
John "takes this Herculean action" of ordering a bride on the From
Russia With Love Web site. He presses enter and it's done.</LD>
<TE>   "From then on," Chaplin says, "he's on skis and he's just jumped
over the men's downhill slalom, and he's got no control."</TE>
<TE>   That lack of control is evident from the moment John goes to meet
his prospective bride at the airport. Despite what he's been told,
the Russian Nadia (Nicole Kidman) doesn't speak a word of English.
"It's really a simple metaphor about communication between men and
women," Butterworth says. "They can't speak to each other--in this
case, quite literally." Because of this, a good 20 minutes of the
film passes in near silence when John and Nadia are together, warily
checking each other out. Eventually, detente appears to have been
reached when the two learn to communicate in the international
language of, well, if not exactly love, then at least highly charged
sex.</TE>
<TE>   But still, things are not quite what they appear, as John quickly
learns when Russian "cousins" of Nadia show up on his doorstep. Just
when he thought he had his new relationship on course, it takes a
startling and perhaps even life-threatening turn. "Birthday Girl"
veers in tone from black comedy to romance to thriller, yet sustains
its razor-thin balance to the end. "I can't write entirely serious
stuff," Butterworth says. "Sooner or later I see the absurdity in
something and am forced to try and bring it out."</TE>
<TE>   The creative inspiration behind "Birthday Girl" was the thought
that "we wanted to make a film about a character who knows what he
wants and thinks he can buy it," Butterworth says. "He thinks all he
has to do is one simple thing, but actually he's going to have to
suffer and lose everything and make all kinds of sacrifices before he
finally gets anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   An Understanding Among Brothers</TE>
<TE>   The script for "Birthday Girl" was written by Jez Butterworth and
his brother Tom. A third Butterworth, Steve, served as producer on
the film, which was shot in England and Australia in 1999 on a budget
of just under $20 million. According to Miramax, production on the
film was nearly completed in 1999 but had to be halted when Kidman's
schedule called for her to go to work on "The Others," also a Miramax
release. In mid-2000, while in the midst of making that film, Kidman
returned to England to shoot some additional scenes for "Birthday
Girl."</TE>
<TE>   On working with his brothers, Jez (a not-uncommon English
diminutive of his given name, Jeremy) says, "I suppose to collaborate
in any art you need not necessarily like-minded people, but people
who understand implicitly what you're on about. [Working with family]
is one of those things that either works or doesn't. I know it's some
people's worst nightmare, but I think it's great."</TE>
<TE>   The notion of brothers working together in the film business is
not new--just think of the on-screen antics of Groucho, Harpo, Chico
and Zeppo Marx or twins Julius J. and Philip G. Epstein, who wrote
more than a dozen screenplays together including "Casablanca"--but in
recent years the cinematic band of brothers has grown in numbers into
a full-scale orchestra, with numerous siblings sharing or passing off
writing, producing and directing responsibilities. Last year alone
saw films by the brothers Coen ("The Man Who Wasn't There"), Hughes
("From Hell"), Farrelly ("Shallow Hal") and Kornbluth ("Haiku
Tunnel"); in front of the camera, Owen and Luke Wilson shared screen
time in "The Royal Tenenbaums."</TE>
<TE>   Collaborating with Tom on writing is one thing--the two began
writing together while they were students at Cambridge
University--but additional challenges are faced when a
writer-director must deal with his producer, even if it's his
brother. "Films are made between the two stones of art and money,"
Jez observes. Rubbing his clenched fists against each other in
illustration, he notes that "Steve and I are doing this all day long.
I want to do something, and he says, 'I can't afford it.' We're going
to butt heads, but what can you do? You've got to spend Christmas
with that person in the end."</TE>
<TE>   These sentiments are echoed by Steve Butterworth. "One of the
great things about working with your brothers is that you've already
had a hundred arguments with them before and it's all worked out in
the end. You still love each other and know full well that you're
going to see them the next day."</TE>
<TE>   "In making films," he adds, "the relationship between the director
and the producer is all about trust, and that's really a given for
us."</TE>
<TE>   The Butterworths also worked together on "Mojo," the 1997 film
based on Jez's Olivier Award-winning play. Playwriting is a solo task
for Jez, and his latest effort is due to open in London later this
year. He may be in the spotlight more than his siblings, but Jez is
actually the youngest of the three: Tom is 34, Steve is 33 and Jez is
32. Bringing up the rear is John Henry, 25, who has also tossed his
creative hat into the familial film arena: He and Jez have just
completed a screenplay for Sydney Pollack's Mirage Enterprises.</TE>
<TE>   The male bonding in evidence on the "Birthday Girl" production
team was also shared between Jez and Chaplin. Both grew up in nearby
suburbs in the same Herefordshire region where the film takes place.
"It's the first time I've worked with a director who's the same age I
am. We had very similar references, so there was a lot of shorthand
involved."</TE>
<TE>   "Birthday Girl" is Chaplin's highest-profile leading role since he
was the object of Uma Thurman and Janeane Garofalo's affection in
1996's "The Truth About Cats &amp; Dogs." He has also appeared in
"Washington Square" (1997), "The Thin Red Line" (1998) and "Lost
Souls (2000), and will next be seen as Sandra Bullock's FBI colleague
in "Murder by Numbers" this spring.</TE>
<TE>   For Kidman, the role of Nadia is yet another unconventional choice
in a career that has often steered off the mainstream movie-star
track--and one she almost didn't get the chance to play.</TE>
<TE>   "I was dubious at first," Butterworth says of casting Kidman. "I
thought there was every chance that her celebrity might overbalance
the [rest of the film]. But when I met her, her interpretation of the
role and her wish to take the risk were just irresistible."</TE>
<TE>   At the beginning of the shoot, "Nicole and I sort of had a little
aside, and I said, 'Look, I've directed lots of actors before, but
I've never directed a movie star. Is it any different?' She said no,
and that was that, really."</TE>

<HD>During Halftime, It's U2 or Bust</HD>
<DH>Television: NBC will try to lure males from Super Bowl
shows with Playmates on 'Fear.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About two hours into the Super Bowl--or, put another way, more than
six hours into Fox's coverage if you include the "All-Madden Team"
special, three-hour pregame show, actual game and postgame
festivities--the rock band U2 will take the stage in the New Orleans
Superdome for a three-song concert.</LD>
<LD>   The Super Bowl is the kind of blockbuster event (an average 84.3
million viewers tuned in last year) that usually has rival network
chiefs quietly conceding defeat for a day. In addition to U2 at
halftime, Fox has loaded up its coverage with superstar acts,
including troubled pop diva Mariah Carey singing the national anthem.</LD>
<LD>   But NBC Entertainment President Jeff Zucker thinks--no, he
knows--he's got something that'll temporarily prompt coveted young
male viewers to change the channel: Playboy Playmates.</LD>
<TE>   While U2 is moving through its hit songs, NBC will offer buxom
centerfolds on a special edition of the network's unscripted stunt
show "Fear Factor." The first 23 minutes will air during halftime,
Zucker said--around 4:45 p.m. locally--while the rest of the episode
will air after the game, at 10 p.m. Eastern time and 7 p.m. on the
West Coast, opposite a post-Super Bowl episode of the Fox sitcom
"Malcolm in the Middle."</TE>
<TE>   "Fear Factor" debuted last summer in an attempt to attract the
audience watching alternative formats such as CBS' "Survivor." While
the show hasn't nearly reached "Survivor"-like heights in popularity,
it has become a valuable weapon for NBC Monday nights at 8, most
especially among young males, a demographic advertisers target. Each
show has six contestants competing for money by enduring extreme
situations (i.e. eating buffalo testicles, bobbing for plums in a vat
of snakes, standing on the wing of an airplane).</TE>
<TE>   The edition of "Fear Factor" airing Sunday is being chopped up
specifically to steal away men during halftime of the game, offering
a portion of the football crowd what it presumably can't get during a
populist broadcast like the Super Bowl. To wit: big-breasted women,
wearing an assortment of clothing under odd circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   Though Zucker told a gathering of reporters last month that at
least one stunt "involves water," the truncated halftime installment
will more prominently feature the Playmates walking on a tightrope
between two tall buildings, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't get the full value of the Playmates in the first stunt.
The full value of the Playmates is in the third stunt," said Zucker,
who at times has appeared to enjoy the hostility "Fear Factor" has
generated, with some critics saying the network's brand is being
sullied by such programming. But Zucker said NBC already had the
Playmates lined up for the network's game show, "Weakest Link," when
his staff saw an opening to grab eyeballs during a lull in the game.
And hey, buzz is buzz.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the network strategies on display is a question of
sociology. Does the average football fan, already a little
bleary-eyed from the game and stoked on beer and carbohydrates, want
to watch a popular music act at halftime or Playmates?</TE>
<TE>   That question, said Daniel Kellison, co-creator and executive
producer of Comedy Central's "The Man Show," is "a no-brainer."</TE>
<TE>   "Ultimately what NBC has done is a form of evil genius," said
Kellison, whose 4-year-old show, hosted by comedians Jimmy Kimmel and
Adam Carolla, is an intentionally sophomoric bacchanal for the
beer-drinking regular guy, adolescent and otherwise (each "Man Show"
episode ends with footage of "girls on trampolines").</TE>
<TE>   Super Bowl Sunday, Kellison noted, "is the most primal day of the
year for men. They're drinking, they don't have to think, they go
back to their caveman roots.... At halftime, they're not going to
want to watch Barry Manilow or U2 or anyone. They're going to want to
watch girls in bikinis, struggling through some sort of [situation]."</TE>
<TE>   Told the Playmates would be walking on a tightrope, Kellison
thought Playmates Jell-O wrestling would be a better idea.</TE>
<TE>   NBC's halftime strategy, it should be said, is not new. It was
actually initiated by Fox, which aired a live episode of its popular
sketch comedy series "In Living Color" versus halftime of the 1992
Super Bowl. In subsequent years, MTV did special halftime
installments of popular programs including "Beavis and Butt-head" and
"Celebrity Death Match"; meanwhile, the Super Bowl countered with
blockbuster concerts, featuring Aerosmith and Britney Spears.</TE>
<TE>   For Fox, getting U2 this year is a bit of a coup, since the band
is enjoying a resurgence with its album "All That You Can't Leave
Behind," and possesses a fan base that spans generations.</TE>
<TE>   But no matter how awesome the act, Kellison--apparently speaking
for a certain segment of the male population--feels this Super Bowl
tradition needs to go.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so bizarre to throw a big, showy production number in the
middle of the most masculine event of the year," he said. "Thank God
Barbra Streisand is retired."</TE>

<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>YOKOSUKA, Japan</DL>
<LD>Crystal Williams can seem like a pretty average American 10th-grader.
She slouches her way through English class, is a devoted forward on
the school basketball team and complains that her teachers give out
too much homework.</LD>
<LD>   But Crystal, born and raised in Japan by her American serviceman
father and Korean-born mother, is anything but average.</LD>
<LD>   As Crystal Kay, she is an up-and-coming star in Japanese pop
music. And she embodies something fundamental in the psyche of fans
in this country: They love the exotic, especially if it's familiar.</LD>
<TE>   "I look American, but I'm singing in Japanese," the 15-year-old
explains. "They like that."</TE>
<TE>   Japan's fascination with things American is nothing new. Young
people have been snapping up the latest in music for decades.</TE>
<TE>   But imported music has one major drawback: Since it's not in
Japanese, it's hard to sing along to. Domestically produced pop music
closely follows trends in America, but there has long been something
of an authenticity gap.</TE>
<TE>   The answer: bicultural kids.</TE>
<TE>   The market for aspiring singers like Crystal got a huge boost
after now 19-year-old Hikaru Utada emerged from the campus of Tokyo's
American School in Japan three years ago to become one of the biggest
hits this country's music world has ever seen.</TE>
<TE>   "First Love," Utada's debut CD in 1999, sold more than 9.5 million
copies, making it the best-selling album in Japan ever. Though both
of Utada's parents are Japanese--her mother was also a singer--she
was born in New York and now attends Columbia University.</TE>
<TE>   Before long, Japanese producers were scouring other international
schools for similar talent. Such schools are often where embassy
employees, foreign corporate executives or Japanese who have lived
long stretches abroad send their children.</TE>
<TE>   Crystal is something of a flip side to the story. Instead of being
essentially a Japanese kid raised among Americans, she is basically
an American kid raised in Japan. Crystal has never lived in the
United States. Her entry into the business was aided by her mother,
also a singer, who had connections in the entertainment industry.</TE>
<TE>   Just four months after Utada's debut album was released, Crystal,
then 12, was out with her own debut single. She has released two
albums so far.</TE>
<TE>   After three years in the business, Crystal is now recognized on
the street and can generate squeals of joy when she steps on stage.</TE>
<TE>   But Crystal, who wants to go to college in the United States,
doesn't expect success in Japan to translate easily into fame
overseas.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it would be really hard to be successful in the States,"
she said. "The level is higher, and there are so many talented
people."</TE>

Rogaine for hair loss, Cipro for anthrax and Viagra for impotence.
And you buy all this in a package.... Let me tell you something: If
you are a fat bald guy with herpes, gonorrhea and anthrax, I don't
think you're going to need the Viagra." (Jay Leno)</LD>

<HD>Sculpture on the Cycle of Life</HD>
<DH>Radiant sifted pollen, shimmering milk and beeswax are the
basics of Wolfgang Laib's intriguing works.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES ART CRITIC</BD>
<DL>LA JOLLA</DL>
<LD>The German artist Wolfgang Laib makes sculptures that are less
concerned with being independent objects than with their usefulness
as offerings. The gentle power of ritual, ceremony and spiritual
simplicity courses through his most impressive work. Art becomes a
radiantly charged intersection between life and death--between the
material world and an ineffable soul.</LD>
<LD>   A traveling survey of Laib's work since 1972, organized by the
American Federation of Arts, opened Sunday at San Diego's Museum of
Contemporary Art. Laib (pronounced "libe") showed several times in
Los Angeles about a decade ago, including a powerful installation at
the Museum of Contemporary Art. The San Diego exhibition concludes a
national tour, and it has been slightly trimmed along the way; but
for viewers unfamiliar with Laib's sculpture, the show is a concise
introduction. It also lets us in on what he's been up to since he was
last seen in any depth in Southern California.</LD>
<TE>   Fifteen sculptures and 18 drawings are supplemented by 14
black-and-white photographs, mostly of the 51-year-old artist's
travels in India, Myanmar, Tibet and other parts of Asia. Eastern
philosophies have been important to Laib, and the documentary-style
photographs provide useful information that amplifies several of his
sculptural sources. Laib originally intended to follow in his
father's footsteps and become a doctor--he finished medical school
just as his interest in art fully blossomed--but attending the
condition of the human spirit, not the mechanics of the human body,
seems to have arisen as his principal concern.</TE>
<TE>   The earliest works in the show are a group of eight stones, each
the size of a large potato, carved into a balanced lozenge and
polished to a high sheen. Titled "Brahmandas" (1972-75) and laid out
on a floor-level pedestal, they're not much to look at. But that
seems to be part of the point: Even a meager piece of stone, when
carefully considered, contains an essential wonder that can be
extrapolated into the entire universe. Coaxing it out is the artist's
aim.</TE>
<TE>   That poetic dichotomy marks the show's earliest major sculpture,
"Milkstone" (1983-87). A thin slab of white marble, just over 3 feet
square and about an inch thick, rests on the floor. (It's gorgeously
installed alone in a gallery whose big glass windows overlook the
Pacific.) Starting at the edges of the marble square, Laib ground a
slight concave depression into the stone surface. Milk is then poured
on, until the surface of the stone is completely covered.</TE>
<TE>   Looking at the glistening white work, it's nearly impossible to
tell where the liquid ends and the solid begins. Marble, a classic
sculptural material, is here transformed into the supporting role of
a pedestal, which seamlessly sustains a shimmering plane of
life-nourishing milk. Given the low-slung configuration at your feet,
the gallery floor likewise becomes the sculpture's horizontal
pedestal. Art--and audience--are subtly exalted.</TE>
<TE>   This embodied reverence for art as a humanly generative,
sustaining activity is among the most appealing features of Laib's
work. It radiates throughout the exhibition and its museum site.
After all, the milk in "Milkstone" cannot be left to sour and curdle
when the piece is being publicly exhibited; the milk needs to be
wiped off at the end of each day and refreshed in the morning.
Picture it in your mind's eye: This simple activity, ritually
attended to by museum staff, restores a humbling sense of
guardianship to curatorial routine.</TE>
<TE>   Also exceptional are two pieces made with flower pollen, one from
dandelions and the other from hazelnut. Pure pollen is sifted into a
square configuration on the floor and flooded with light from above.
The intense, gorgeous color of the square--vivid yellow or burnished
gold--is like a bottomless pool. You can't take your eyes off it.</TE>
<TE>   Precisely where the sculpture begins and ends cannot be
determined, though, as the sifted pollen filters out onto the floor
and into the surrounding atmosphere. The ordinary white-walled
gallery is quietly transformed, becoming a secular chapel where art
and nature merge.</TE>
<TE>   Typically for Laib's aesthetic, the feminine associations of milk
are here balanced with the masculine associations of pollen, just as
nature and culture harmonize--not to mention life and death. "Rice
House" (1995-96), for example, is a 5-foot-long slab of marble,
roughly carved into a shape that recalls an elongated Monopoly house,
around which small mounds of white rice huddle. The rice-laden marble
suggests sustenance and shelter, but it also recalls a cemetery
marker.</TE>
<TE>   Serenely systemic cycles of life and death spread out in your
mind, like the row of 27 brass plates lined up on the floor in "The
Rice Meals" (1983); most plates hold a small mound of rice, one a
smaller mound of golden pollen. As an offering, "The Rice Meals"
hovers between a steadfast faith in the nourishment provided by art
and socially poignant allusions to hunger and the distribution of
food.</TE>
<TE>   These are the works on which Laib's reputation as an artist
developed in the 1980s. Less familiar--and less satisfying--are his
large-scale sculptures assembled from sheets of richly colored,
aromatic beeswax. The three on view here date from the 1990s. Their
forms are architectural (stairways, walls, temples). The largest is
composed of six boat-shaped blocks of beeswax, lifted high overhead
near the ceiling on a wooden trestle.</TE>
<TE>   Titled "You Will Go Somewhere Else," the allusions to death and
transformation in its "heavenly boats" are not hard to grasp. (The
form's specific relationship to harvest practices in parts of Asia is
revealed by one of the documentary photographs, which shows sheaves
of grain piled atop wooden trestles.) But the narrative implications
diminish its power, making the sculpture oddly anthropological and
descriptive.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the "milkstone" and pollen sculptures are persuasive
because of the sleek, pared-down emphasis on their status as
offerings. Sculpture gets regarded in a remarkably original way--as a
contemplative condition in real time and space, created for the
presentation of richly metaphorical substances.</TE>
<TE>   Philosophically, the term "presentation" refers to things known in
human consciousness through the senses, moment by moment.
(Interestingly, given Laib's medical background, it also refers to
the position of a fetus in utero at the moment of birth.) In his most
compelling work Laib avoids the descriptive limitations of much
ordinary sculpture in favor of a remarkably generous gift of
perceptual imminence.</TE>

<HD>Some See Red Over 'Project Greenlight'</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's too bad that Miramax surrounded Pete Jones with such an
inexperienced crew for his first feature film ("For 'Greenlight,'
Nothing Succeeds Like Failure," by Patrick Goldstein, Jan. 29).
Wasn't the contest supposed to reward the screenwriter with the
chance of a lifetime?</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Chris Moore put together a ragtag group of so-called
filmmakers and left them to wallow in their ineptitude.</LD>
<LD>   For those of us who take our jobs seriously (I've been in the film
business 15 years), it is painful to watch "Project Greenlight." The
producers could have done many things to help Pete.</LD>
<TE>   Did they encourage him to visit another set to watch an
experienced director? I'll bet not. Did they explain to him that
low-budget filmmaking is all about the art of compromise? Doesn't
seem so.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, Pete isn't always the most likable guy with his "over my
dead body" remarks, but he deserved better than he got. It's obvious
that Miramax decided that producing a conflict-ridden documentary was
more important than giving a first-time director a positive
experience. What a waste.</TE>
<TE>   RICHARD ROSSER</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Palisades</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As Patrick Goldstein said, "Project Greenlight" does serve as a
"Survivor"-type arena for the voyeurs of the world, people who have
nothing better to do than watch masochists go to war over a few shots
to be attempted at the "magic hour." But the clever show serves
another purpose: At its core it's really just an
anti-gee-whiz-come-to-Hollywood-and-be-a-filmmaker message.</TE>
<TE>   With the growing proliferation of kids spending every dime they
have, racking up credit card bills and selling sperm to get their
films made, that means more competition for Miramax at the big lotto
film festivals, i.e., Sundance. The more films entered by the Billy
Joe Bobs of the world, the greater the chance that one of these
longshots could beat out a Miramax "indie" for an all-coveted slot.
(And come on, we don't need Oliver Stone to tell us that the film
festival circuit has basically become one big marketing ploy for the
Miramaxes of the world.)</TE>
<TE>   So any sane person who sets their eyes on "Project Greenlight"
says one thing: "Golly, they're not having any fun. I don't want to
do that anymore."</TE>

<LD>Re Brian Lowry's TV column ("The Big Coin Toss," Jan. 30):</LD>
<LD>   One way to beat NBC at its own game is to tape the day's Olympic
programming and replay it at your leisure, zapping the endless
commercials, schmaltzy fillers and inane talking heads. I have taped
two previous Olympics and boiled down hours of drivel to about 90
minutes of sports.</LD>
<LD>   Viewers may as well tape the shows. We'll know the results before
NBC's taped coverage is aired on the weft coast.</LD>

<LD>Times staff writer Randy Lewis has done your readers a great
disservice. His review of Saturday's show at the Universal
Amphitheater was ridiculously slanted and totally inaccurate ("Berry
Taps Into an Ageless Joy," Jan. 28). His interview with Berry seems
to have left him so star-struck that he glorified Chuck's set and
disrespected Little Richard's far superior show.</LD>
<LD>   I am a huge fan of both artists' rock hits. They are some of the
best music ever recorded. Chuck Berry is one of the greatest
songwriters of all time. But while Richard really cares about his
show, his music, his fans and has a "real band" of powerful players
who are well rehearsed and in tune with him and the audience, Chuck
hardly bothers and just "wings it"--not even caring enough to put on
a tight show.</LD>

<LD>Lynn Smith's article on movie theater walkouts ("Cinema Paradiso? Not
Always," Jan. 30) cracked me up. A few months ago, my husband and I
went to see the film "Blow" because our favorite actor, Johnny Depp,
was in it. But we ended up leaving the minute our least favorite
actor, Paul "Pee-wee Herman" Reubens, made an appearance. Life is too
short to sit through torture! We've learned to check out the casts on
the Internet from now on.</LD>

<LD>In the article "After Reshaping Talk Station, He's Moving On" (by
Steve Carney, Jan. 25) it appears that David Hall is ignorant of one
of the true pioneers of talk radio: Joe Pyne. Pyne was a right-wing,
opinionated and forthright personality who would never have tolerated
a "ditto" let alone a "megaditto" on his show and refused to allow
callers to fawn over him, unlike Rush Limbaugh, who wants callers to
"make him look good."</LD>
<LD>   Pyne was ruffling feathers on KLAC in the 1960s when David Hall
was still in his crib. Although they tried with Marv Gray and Sam
Yorty (then Wally George), no one ever replaced Joe Pyne.</LD>
<LD>   For my money, you could lump every loudmouthed talk show
personality from today all into one; they still wouldn't hold a
candle to the pioneer of talk radio: Joe Pyne.</LD>

<LD>Reading Don Heckman's fine appreciation of Peggy Lee ("Peggy Lee Did
Do Right by Her Material," Jan. 25) brought back many memories of the
legendary performer. I have been a devoted fan for more than 40
years, since my early teens, when I bought my first Peggy Lee record,
"Lover," and wore it out.</LD>
<LD>   At last count, there are more than 50 CDs of her recordings. For
the uninitiated, start with "The Man I Love" (with Frank Sinatra
conducting the orchestra), "Pretty Eyes," "Black Coffee" and "Dream
Street," then go on to her hits and more recent recordings.
Fortunately, her voice and magic will live forever.</LD>

<TE>   Don Heckman need not apologize to jazz buffs for Peggy Lee.
Although I saw Little Willie John debut "Fever" one hot summer '50s
night in Paso Robles, my mind recalls Lee's later version. To those
cranky jazz purists: Tell 'em to spin Lee's "Why Don't You Do Right"
compilation album from the '40s.</TE>

<HD>Bridge Dance Theatre's 'Truth,' at the Least, Is
Disheartening</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>VICTORIA LOOSELEAF</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To set out to create a 65-minute multimedia dance-theater piece based
on the notion of truth, only to present a litany of cliches, a
lackluster movement vocabulary and self-conscious performances, is
not only disheartening but disturbing. Such was the case Thursday,
when the generally enterprising Bridge Dance Theatre performed its
new work, "In the Beginning Truth Walked Around Naked," at Highways
Performance Space.</LD>
<LD>   Phyllis Douglass, Bridge's artistic director-choreographer, wrote
the text (based on the Hassidic folk tale "Truth and Parable") with
Bianca Rose, who doubled as videographer and storyteller. Set to
Brian Gross' aggressive techno score, the work began with Jason
Matney exploring a bucket of flower petals before lying in a fetal
position on a card table. This was followed by Rose's video,
projected on the wall--a parade of people voicing their ideas of
truth, and a laundry list of statistics on suicide, domestic
violence, teenage pregnancy and pediatric AIDS.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Leslie Cooke, Marla McClure, Maura Riley and Nancy
Meyer stood on folding chairs spouting other views of
truth--"passion," "knowledge," "misery"--after which Matney
occasionally partnered the women. Despite plenty of leaps, spins and
lots of rolling around the floor, the dancers seemed stuck in an
emotionless mode.</LD>
<TE>   Maria Wortham's bland, baggy costumes further plagued the evening
that could have been dubbed "Truth ... or Consequences."</TE>

<LD>   New Line Loses Appeal on 'Goldmember' Suit</LD>
<LD>   New Line Cinema has to scrap plans to call the third installment
of its "Austin Powers" franchise "Austin Powers in Goldmember."</LD>
<TE>   The Motion Picture Assn. of America has denied the studio's appeal
of an earlier ruling blocking the use of the name--a spoof of the
1964 James Bond picture "Goldfinger." The decision was made Thursday
by six arbitrators from four different studios.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 24, the MPAA ruled the title "inadmissible" in response to
a complaint from MGM and United Artists, owners of the Bond
franchise. Movie trailers, posters and online promotions using the
"Goldmember" name must be withdrawn, the MPAA said.</TE>
<TE>   The collision between the studios and the bucktoothed superspy
isn't a first: In 1999, they petititoned the MPAA over the use of
"The Spy Who Shagged Me" and, that time, New Line emerged victorious.</TE>
<TE>   The issue, said MGM, is more than self-interest. "It is vital to
maintain the integrity of the MPAA title registration procedure by
which all major motion picture studios have abided for many years,"
Jay Rakow, senior executive vice president and general counsel of
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc., said in a statement. "MGM will seek
monetary penalties pursuant to the terms of the MPAA award and will
take all other appropriate action to continue to protect its
intellectual property and its filmmakers."</TE>
<TE>   New Line said that the "Austin Powers" film, featuring Mike Myers
in four roles, is still on track for a July 26 release. A new title
has not yet been selected.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though New Line is disappointed by the MPAA's decision, we
will abide by it," the company said in a statement. "We remain
committed to our filmmaker's vision and are moving forward."</TE>

<TE>   Christopher Guest Set  to Skewer Folk Music</TE>
<TE>   Actor-writer-director Christopher Guest is hooking up with Spinal
Tap buddies Harry Shearer and Michael McKean on a mockumentary
skewering '60s folk music.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Hollywood Reporter, Guest will direct the project
for Castle Rock Entertainment, which produced his last two films.
Longtime collaborator Eugene Levy and Guest are writing the script.</TE>
<TE>   The story, Guest says, will be a musical revolving around folk
artists well past their prime who are invited out of obscurity for
one last shot at stardom.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the cast of Guest's "Waiting for Guffman," which skewered
middle-American community theater, and "Best in Show," which targeted
canine competitions, will be returning in the new project, with tunes
to be written by Guest, Shearer, McKean and Levy.</TE>

<TE>   New Ventura Musical Has Broadway Hopes</TE>
<TE>   The script of a musical based on the life of maverick Minnesota
Gov. Jesse Ventura is progressing, with songs titled "Do You Like the
Rolling Stones?" "The Heart Is a Muscle," "Hooyah!" and "You're
Different." The piece is titled "The Body Ventura."</TE>
<TE>   Composer-lyricist Stephen Dolginoff told Playbill On-Line that he
is awaiting Ventura's approval for a revised Act 2. When Ventura
signs off, producer Pierre Cossette plans to move forward with plans
to take it to Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   In a January interview, Ventura told the Associated Press that he
sought a rougher edge to the musical. "I wanted more gutty and
gritty, and we're starting to move that way. Instead of being
milquetoast and G-rated, we're starting to go for R-rated," he said.
"Let's make it who I really am."</TE>

<TE>   Paltrow Making London Debut in 'Proof'</TE>
<TE>   Gwyneth Paltrow plans to make her British theater debut in June at
London's Donmar Warehouse, with her "Shakespeare in Love" director,
John Madden, in charge of "Proof."</TE>
<TE>   Paltrow, who won a best actress Oscar for her "Shakespeare in
Love" work, will be playing the same part that won Mary-Louise Parker
a Tony Award for best actress, that of a talented young woman who has
inherited her father's mathematical genius--and may also have
inherited his mental instability.</TE>
<TE>   Madden shot down talk that his pairing with Paltrow is a dry run
for a film of the play. "We're doing this as a piece of theater," he
said Friday. "That's what the focus is and what the raison d'etre
is."</TE>

<TE>   New Image for Fox's Van Susteren</TE>
<TE>   Those tuning in to see Greta Van Susteren in her new Fox News
Channel show Monday night may do a double-take. The 47-year-old
ex-host of CNN's "The Point" looks dramatically different after a
face lift on Jan. 14, the New York Daily News reports.</TE>
<TE>   Her new image began popping up on Fox this week in promos for "On
the Record," the new 7 p.m. nightly newscast. According to USA Today,
Van Susteren undertook the procedure to remove the bags under her
eyes in anticipation of her 30th high school reunion. The work, she
said, was done in her doctor's office and was nothing more than an
eye lift. If the swelling doesn't go down by Monday, she'll make a
reference to it on the telecast.</TE>

<TE>   Vienna Buys Back Strauss Memorabilia</TE>
<TE>   The Viennese government is paying approximately $4.38 million to
the heirs of composer Johann Strauss Jr. for musical scores and other
memorabilia--items that had originally been returned to the family
because they'd been confiscated by the Nazis.</TE>
<TE>   In 1939, Hitler's Gestapo appropriated the collection of original
scores, first printings, correspondence, paintings of the Strauss
dynasty and other memorabilia.</TE>
<TE>   After World War II, authorities granted the heirs permission to
take part of the 1,400-piece collection out of the country if they
ceded the rest to Vienna.</TE>
<TE>   Only in 1999, as part of general restitution laws to victims of
the Holocaust, were those articles also returned to the heirs.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking on behalf of the heirs, Marianne Cochran Crespo de la
Serna told the Austria Press Agency: "We always said that Strauss
belongs to Vienna."</TE>

<HD>Are They Pardners No More?</HD>
<DH>Museums: The proposed alliance between the Southwest and
the Autry seems to be off. Pechanga Indians have inside track.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After several months of subtle cowboy-Indian skirmishing over access
to the coveted collection of the Southwest Museum on Mount
Washington, the cowboys are in retreat.</LD>
<LD>   The prize in this rivalry is the chance to collaborate with the
respected but meagerly funded Southwest Museum, which is looking for
a partner to help improve its balance sheet and boost public exposure
of its 350,000 western artifacts from the 18th, 19th and early 20th
centuries.</LD>
<LD>   In a genteel updating of the hostilities a century past, the
principal contenders have been the Gene Autry Museum of Western
Heritage and the Temecula Band of the Luiseno Mission Indians, also
known as the Pechangas, who operate a casino resort on tribal land
near Temecula, midway between Los Angeles and San Diego along
Interstate 15.</LD>
<TE>   Though the Southwest Museum's executive director, Duane King,
sought to stress that no final decisions have been made, Autry
director John Gray said that his institution and the Southwest are no
longer actively pursuing a courtship.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very disappointed that we're not proceeding to create a
larger entity for Los Angeles, and we still hope that there's a role
for the Autry with the Southwest Museum in the future," Gray said.</TE>
<TE>   "We pretty much know that they're leaning toward the Pechanga
tribe," said Autry public relations director Jay Aldrich, noting that
this is the first time in more than a decade that Autry officials
haven't considered a merger with the Southwest Museum as a live
possibility.</TE>
<TE>   The Pechangas, increasingly prosperous with revenues from a
gambling operation that opened in 1995, entered the picture with a
letter to Southwest officials last May. In November, Pechanga elders
visited the museum, King said, and museum board members have made
several visits to the Pechangas' property.</TE>
<TE>   The idea under exploration, King said, is that the Pechangas would
build a museum and cultural center that would display items from the
Southwest Museum's collection, about 98% of which is in storage,
unseen by visitors. The Southwest Museum "would provide artifacts on
a rotating basis for exhibition, as well as assistance with
educational programs and public programs. And in return [the
Pechangas] would provide support for our efforts here in Los
Angeles," King said.</TE>
<TE>   In large part, said King, the Southwest board members have faced
the decision of "whether to remain independent or to become part of
another museum. The Pechanga band ... has offered an alliance that
would not change the governance or the function of the Southwest
Museum."</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to reach a Pechanga Tribal Council spokesman were
unsuccessful Thursday and Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1914, the Southwest Museum has stood on a hill in the city's
largely residential Mount Washington neighborhood. Its holdings have
been called the most significant of their kind in a nongovernmental
museum.</TE>
<TE>   But its out-of-the-way location and modest finances (its annual
attendance is roughly 75,000; its fiscal 2001 budget of $2.3 million
included no acquisition funds and its endowment is less than $5
million) have led to rumors of alliances with wealthier
organizations. From 1998 to 2000, the museum operated a satellite
exhibition area at the Los Angeles County of Museum of Art's LACMA
West building on Wilshire Boulevard</TE>
<TE>   King said the museum is committed to its current site and, in a
$3-million expansion campaign that is separate from the alliance
discussions, it plans to open a third building at its Mount
Washington site in mid-2003.</TE>
<TE>   While the board and staffers have been in discussions with the
Pechangas, he said, "I don't want to create the impression that we
have ruled out the Autry. We have not ruled out the possibility of
any alliance with anyone."</TE>
<TE>   Early last year, Southwest officials had drafted a plan for how an
Autry-Southwest merger might be achieved. Under that plan, the
institutions could have created a National Center for Western
Heritage to function as an umbrella organization, with a new building
to rise near the current Autry site.</TE>
<TE>   Like the Southwest Museum, the Autry collects and displays
artifacts of western heritage. But the Autry museum (its 2001 budget
was $12.5 million and its endowment tops $100 million), created with
funding from the famous singing cowboy and his wife, Jackie Autry,
also collects and displays show-business memorabilia illustrating the
pop-culture image of the Old West. The museum in Griffith Park drew
320,000 visitors last year, but it has carried a lightweight
reputation among academics.</TE>
<TE>   Gray said Friday that the museum is committed to expanding its
scholarly programs and stressing inclusiveness, and cited the Autry's
"Native Voices" program, which encourages Native American
playwrights, and an ongoing project on the literary west in which the
Autry has partnered with Otis and Occidental colleges.</TE>
<TE>   For the Pechangas, a museum would be part of a broader plan to
diversify the tribal economy and celebrate their heritage. This
summer, the Pechangas are scheduled to open a 522-room hotel with
seven restaurants, 75,000 feet of casino space, adding to an
entertainment center that already includes gambling, restaurants, a
concert and prizefight venue.</TE>
<TE>   In May 2001, the Pechangas bought a 724-acre ranch (once the
retreat of "Perry Mason" author Erle Stanley Gardner) that neighbors
their casino. Though any major decision would need the approval of
the Pechangas' 1,200 tribal members, the Southwest Museum's King said
a portion of that land is under discussion as a possible museum site.
"It's just a beautiful site," King said. "One way or another, they're
going to do a museum. And I think it's going to be an excellent
facility."</TE>

<LD>If anyone has it easy when it comes to counter-programming the Super
Bowl, it's public television: Everything they show qualifies as
alternative fare to the annual football extravaganza.</LD>
<LD>   Still, the folks at KCET have put some thought into it this year
and come up with something that has all the requisite female appeal:
a three-part documentary on soap operas.</LD>
<LD>   "Never Ending Stories--How Soap Cleaned Up" (2:30-5 p.m. Sunday,
KCET) explores the history, methodology and extraordinary influence
of this often denigrated yet enduringly popular dramatic form.</LD>
<TE>   There's just one catch. It's a British program, produced for the
BBC in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The result is that it's divided about evenly between British and
American programs and personnel, meaning U.S. viewers are going to
find out a lot more about "Coronation Street" and "EastEnders" than
most of them ever wanted to know.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the American segments are severely limited in scope: The
producers chose to focus all of their attention on three U.S.
programs--the granddaddy of broadcast soaps, CBS' daytime drama
"Guiding Light," and two prime-time serials that are well known in
England but--hello!--have been off the air for more than a decade:
"Dallas" and "Dynasty."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the series covers a wide range of interesting topics, from
how viewers often confuse the actors with their characters to the way
the public's view of real life has been influenced by soap opera
precepts. And while the producers acknowledge that the genre is often
mocked, they don't go down that road themselves. In fact, much of the
second installment is spent respectfully detailing the difficulties
of writing serials.</TE>
<TE>   "That's our challenge every week, every year: to tell the
continuing story," says James Harmon Brown, one of the head writers
of "Guiding Light." "Because it can't end. It can never end."</TE>
<TE>   Unless the ratings tank, that is.</TE>

<HD>Director's Time to Reconsider</HD>
<DH>Movies: Joseph Cedar aimed to lionize religious heroism in
'Time of Favor,' but Israeli film now questions such devotion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM TUGEND</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some films are inspired by current events, but in creating "Time of
Favor," director Joseph Cedar seemed to anticipate history. The
Israeli movie, which opens today in Los Angeles, examines how a
deadly fusion of religious fanaticism and nationalist fervor could
lead to a nightmare scenario engulfing the incendiary Middle East, if
not the world.</LD>
<LD>   In Cedar's script, the apocalyptic threat is embodied in a young
Jewish religious student who plots to "cleanse" the Temple Mount in
Jerusalem by blowing up the Dome of the Rock, one of Islam's holiest
shrines.</LD>
<LD>   On Sept. 20, 2000, Cedar wrapped post-production on "Time of
Favor." Eight days later, Ariel Sharon, then leader of the opposition
and now Israel's prime minister, undertook a politically charged
visit to the Temple Mount, under heavy Israeli police protection.</LD>
<TE>   Although Sharon did not enter the Dome of the Rock or the adjacent
Al-Aqsa Mosque, his presence on the Temple Mount infuriated Muslim
authorities and, at least in Palestinian eyes, triggered the
continuing cycle of violence dubbed by Arabs as the "Al-Aqsa
intifada."</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 28, 2001, one year after the Sharon visit, "Time of
Favor," having finally found an American distributor, was scheduled
to open its commercial run in New York and Los Angeles. But after
Sept. 11, the distributor thought it prudent to delay release of a
film featuring a Jewish terrorist and dealing with the kind of
motivations underlying the disastrous attack.</TE>
<TE>   The Middle East and the world have changed drastically since Cedar
conceived and filmed "Time of Favor," and so has the 33-year-old
director and screenwriter.</TE>
<TE>   Graduate of Hebrew U. and NYU Film School</TE>
<TE>   He was born in New York and when he was 5 his father, a noted
geneticist, and his mother, a drama psychotherapist, emigrated to
Israel. The Cedar family, parents and son, are modern, or centrist,
Orthodox Jews. They observe Jewish law and rituals but also live in
the secular world. The men are usually recognized by wearing a small,
knitted yarmulke--which Cedar balances on top of his close-cut
hair--as distinguished from the black hats and coats of the ultra- or
fervently Orthodox Jews, known as haredim.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to most of the haredim, the modern Orthodox fulfill
the country's army duty. Cedar served three years in a paratroop
unit, where he was one of three yarmulke-wearing soldiers among the
mass of bareheaded comrades. The Cedar family settled in a section of
Jerusalem inhabited by like-minded national religious Jews of the
Gush Emunim movement, whose adherents largely populate the Israeli
settlements on the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   So when Cedar, having graduated from the Hebrew University in
Jerusalem and the New York University film school, started thinking
about his debut movie, he visualized his protagonist as "a national
religious hero, willing to sacrifice for a greater cause," he says.
"I thought the concept romantic and I was proud to glorify this kind
of ethos."</TE>
<TE>   When he started writing the script, he moved to a West Bank
settlement and his friends there and in the wider Orthodox community
had high hopes for the project.</TE>
<TE>   "They told me that since I was the first observant Jew to make an
Israeli feature film, here was a chance to show how great we really
are," recalls Cedar.</TE>
<TE>   But as the screenplay and the movie evolved, Cedar's viewpoint
changed, or, as he put it, "I matured.... I came to believe that the
central question of the film was how much an individual must
sacrifice for the good of a group or to advance a cause." The film,
its maker acknowledges, leaves him with more questions than answers,
but if there is an overriding message, it is addressed to a potential
Arab suicide bomber or to the kind of Jewish zealot who assassinated
former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to tell each of them that while you may think what you're
doing is for the good of your people and pleases God, your life is
more important than any of these causes," says Cedar.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of Sept. 11, the exhortation takes on added force,
Cedar believes, in showing "how fanatics who worship God can end up
committing the most horrendous acts in his name."</TE>
<TE>   Disturbed by America's  Post-Sept. 11 Mood</TE>
<TE>   There is another, heightened relevance between the film and
reality, one that disturbs Cedar following a recent visit to his
native New York. He understands the emotions underlying the "United
We Stand" banners, but he worries that they exclude, by implication,
those individuals and groups--including Palestinian Americans--who
cannot join the majority consensus.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are very strong and united, you become numb to groups
and individuals with other opinions, and that's bad," says Cedar.</TE>
<TE>   He is also concerned that Americans, like Israelis before them,
are in a "heat-of-revenge" state, which, though understandable, can
corrupt the soul.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to say to Americans that the humanistic ethics that
prevailed before Sept. 11 are now as valid as ever," Cedar says.</TE>
<TE>   In Israel's counterpart to the Oscars, "Time of Favor" won six
awards, including best picture, and best actor for Aki Avni, who
portrays the devout company commander of a unit made up entirely of
religious soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   Avni portrays a man torn between loyalties: He's a disciple of a
charismatic rabbi and he's a professional soldier.</TE>
<TE>   Avni, currently visiting Los Angeles, comes from a non-Orthodox
background. To prepare for his role, he spent a few weeks at a West
Bank yeshiva, or religious school, of the type portrayed in the film
whose graduates go on to military service.</TE>
<TE>   He liked the experience and the people.</TE>
<TE>   "I know there are many who say that the settlers are an obstacle
to peace," says Avni. "I don't have to agree with everything they do,
but I found that the people there are doing a brave job.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a dream, and I find such people attractive."</TE>

<LD>Terrorists have once again threatened to kill perennial Brazilian
presidential candidate Luiz Inacio da Silva, popularly known as Lula.
This has happened often throughout his long, controversial political
career. This time he and the government should take the threat
seriously--as should all who care about the region's tenuous grip on
democracy.</LD>
<LD>   A group that calls itself the Brazilian Revolutionary Front has
already killed two members of Lula's Workers' Party and threatened to
kill 15 others. Last September, gunmen shot to death the mayor of a
city in Sao Paulo state. A month later, a bomb injured a Workers'
Party mayor from a nearby city. Then last week, eight gunmen
kidnapped Celso Daniel, the popular leftist mayor of a Sao Paulo
suburb. Two days later, police found his bullet-riddled body.</LD>
<LD>   Brazilian officials, including President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso, dispute suggestions that Daniel's death is linked to his
politics. They suggest that common criminals abducted and killed him,
although no ransom note was ever sent. Have they forgotten Brazil's
recent history? Death squads, formed by a military dictatorship in
the 1960s and '70s, not only carried out hundreds of political
assassinations but created a legacy of violence and intimidation that
still resurfaces periodically in Brazilian society.</LD>
<TE>   The American public hears about such mayhem only rarely, as in
1988 when anti-environmental ranchers ordered the murder of
rubber-farmer-turned-Workers'-Party-activist Francisco "Chico" Mendes
or, three years later, when human rights groups made credible
accusations that death squads were behind the mass killings of
homeless children in the streets of Rio de Janeiro. It's time to pay
attention again.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of brushing off the latest kidnapping and murder, Brazil's
president should order a thorough investigation. Then he should
demand law enforcement scrutiny of the other attacks on political
figures and the spate of threats, which are causing a sickening pall
of political paranoia to fall on a nation that should be emerging as
a shining example of South American democracy.</TE>

<HD>Brownstein Examines Presidents' Strengths</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Clinton's Got Right Stuff, but at Wrong Time," Jan. 28: After
reading Ronald Brownstein's piece comparing Presidents Clinton and
Bush in regard to the response needed after Sept. 11, I am urged by
the underlying jingoism and nearsightedness of this column to
respond. Brownstein doesn't seem to understand that the desperate
need for justice will drive people to sacrifice their lives
regardless of the fear factor.</LD>
<LD>   Brownstein is himself espousing obsolete ideologies "at the wrong
time" when he suggests that what we need is "to reestablish a healthy
fear of the United States." To believe, in the present context,
Machiavelli's 500-year-old advice in "The Prince" (that it is better
to be feared than to be loved) is to be out of touch with the
present. Because we are no longer talking about principalities,
kingdoms or nation states. Aren't we talking about a global uprising,
of which Islamist extremism is only one facet? Take a look at
Argentina, for instance, Chiapas or Colombia.</LD>
<TE>   Does Brownstein suppose that by pepper-spraying (a cruel and
unusual punishment) nonviolent demonstrators in Seattle their
convictions will be quelled? Once you get people upset, will you get
any respect (and cooperation) from them by a little skull-cracking?
Does Brownstein endorse state terrorism? Perhaps I am just a dreamer
(and a pessimistic one at that), but my instincts tell me that this
is not going to bear the fruits we are hoping for.</TE>

<TE>   Did President Clinton's "analytical brilliance" fail to recognize
that the United States was under repeated acts of terrorism during
his tenure, starting with the first attack against the World Trade
Center in 1993 and ending with the bombing of the Cole in 2000?</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps if Clinton had responded to these acts of terrorism the
way that President Bush has, the destruction of the World Trade
Center would never have taken place.</TE>

<TE>   A God-given intelligence, a gifted assimilation of facts and an
amazing ability to mesmerize the populace do not constitute brilliant
leadership. The world has many of these pretenders in elevated
positions who are regrettably and sadly lacking. Bear witness to the
results of eight years in the White House.</TE>

<LD>"Cell Phone Numbers Racket" (editorial, Jan. 17) is well-intentioned
but misinformed. As attractive an idea as taking your number with you
when you switch wireless providers may be, it will redirect almost $1
billion in its first year and half-a-billion dollars every year
thereafter away from consumers' No. 1 concern: continuing to expand
coverage and quality.</LD>
<LD>   This is a matter of choice. Should the industry spend billions on
continuing to fight blocked calls and dropped calls, or should that
money be spent on rebuilding the infrastructure for something that
will be of value only to a few? The money will be spent and should be
spent on what consumers really are asking for.</LD>

<LD>As shocking as the Enron debacle has been, it pales in comparison
with the potential implications of the Andersen scandal. There always
have been and always will be companies that attempt to cook their
books. Regular outside audits under the presumably watchful eye of
the SEC were established after the crash of 1929 to protect investors
from such crooked practices. What Andersen's aiding and abetting of
Enron's dishonest dealings has done is to discourage Americans from
putting their money anywhere but under their mattresses, because how
are we to know that any audit is for real? That is a recipe for
another Great Depression, and legitimate enterprises will be punished
along with the bad apples. Enron was crooked, but Andersen is by far
the greater criminal.</LD>

the public is? Mrs. Lay describes their present financial situation
as "nothing left" (Jan. 29). I'm sure it's quite different from the
employees' "nothing left." The Lays really give capitalism a bad
name.</TE>

<TE>   In "Enron's Run Tripped by Arrogance, Greed" (Jan. 27), about
Enron's practice of pushing the envelope for every rule, you failed
to state the obvious: Every deal Enron made was hammered out in
negotiations with executives, attorneys and accountants of other
companies. By focusing solely on Enron's apparent transgressions, you
are missing the story.</TE>

<LD>Crispin Sartwell's excellent commentary ("Thinkers Go to the Back of
the Lunch Line," Jan. 28) touches on a more pressing absurdity:
standardized testing. Am I the only one who felt like I'd fallen down
the rabbit hole when it seemed all our local, state and federal
officials declared comprehensive standardized testing the panacea for
our public schools?</LD>
<LD>   It sounds nice as a meaningless political sound bite but does
nothing to solve the problems plaguing our schools. In fact, it does
the opposite: Teachers must spend so much time preparing for these
tests that they can no longer help students to learn critical
thinking. Then again, perhaps that is what these politicians
wanted--a populace without the ability to think critically.</LD>

<TE>   After reading Sartwell's column, I have only one question. At what
age do children get to tell their teachers that certain material or
tests are stupid? This seems to be a child's dream come true; I know
that as a child I would have loved to have this kind of "courage to
stand up for what I believed." Up until test time I "knew it all"
too. (This assumption was rectified upon grading.)</TE>
<TE>   I think all this child is learning is disrespect for his teachers,
especially since his parents are taking his side on the issue. Part
of education is learning how little we really know, and tests seem to
be a proven method.</TE>

<HD>Central Valley: Buy Out Farmers at a Fair Price</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The $500-Million Water Bill" (editorial, Jan. 19) misled readers
about Central Valley Project irrigation water on the San Joaquin
Valley's west side. The cost to provide CVP water to farms and
communities is being repaid in full with the exception of the
interest on the loan from the federal government. No one is getting a
free ride, and the return on investment on the cost to construct the
CVP is more than $55 billion, far more than the actual cost of the
project.</LD>
<LD>   It was well understood that the San Luis Drain was an integral
part of the CVP. The decision not to construct the drain spelled the
ultimate doom to much of the farmland that received CVP water.
West-side farmers counted on the promises of the federal government
to complete the project as planned. It never was. Nor is the amount
of water being delivered that was contracted under the original terms
of the CVP agreement. Most years, west-side farmers can only count on
about 50% of their promised supply.</LD>
<LD>   The decision to buy out a certain number of farms is the only way
the federal government can fulfill its obligation to provide adequate
water or drainage. Shortchanging farmers who have worked the land
despite the failings of others is an unfair way to rectify a promise.</LD>

<LD>So President Bush hopes to silence criticism of prisoner treatment by
calling captured Taliban soldiers "unlawful combatants" instead of
"prisoners of war" ("Officials Agree on Prisoners' Status," Jan. 29)?
Fat chance. Whatever you call them, they are still human beings and,
as such, deserve to be treated humanely.</LD>
<LD>   If Bush wants to silence criticism then he ought to freely let
journalists and representatives from Geneva into the camp to see for
themselves how prisoners are being treated. Have we forgotten that
we're supposed to be the good guys?</LD>

<TE>   Do we deny accused criminals within the U.S. due process because
we find their crimes particularly despicable? Obviously not; doing so
would violate the very principles for which America stands. Yet, the
U.S. government is currently denying the Guantanamo detainees due
process. The Geneva Convention states that all detainees be
considered POWs until determined otherwise by a judge. Failing to
take this step is un-American. The Declaration of Independence holds
that all men are created equal, not just those lucky enough to be
Americans.</TE>

<HD>LAPD Slow to Help in Identity Theft</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What was missing from "Identity Theft Tops Fraud Reports" (Jan. 24)
is the slow response from local police, in my case, the LAPD. I was a
victim of identity theft through the Internet. Electronic checks were
used to withdraw money from my checking account and credit cards were
applied for.</LD>
<LD>   I was able to obtain the name, address, phone number and e-mail
address of the person responsible, but the LAPD officers refused to
take the information. They told me I had to receive a victim's packet
first and then provide additional information. Already it has been
five weeks since I made the initial report, and I have yet to be
contacted by the LAPD. By the time the victim's packet arrives, the
perpetrator will probably be onto his next victim and another
identity.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The monetary and psychological harm of identity theft is
infinitely compounded by the complete lack of assistance by the three
major credit reporting agencies.</TE>
<TE>   These agencies often fail to help or correct their records even
when provided with irrefutable evidence that people have been robbed
of their money, their credit and their identity. One news story noted
that a victim, not the perpetrator, had been arrested for fraud. Law
enforcement agencies and credit reporting agencies must cooperate to
quickly find the identify thieves and to restore the victim's
identify and credit-worthiness.</TE>

<LD>Re "Warming Up to a New Crisis," Commentary, Jan. 25: In the past,
for reasons mostly of arrogance and economics, this country has had a
tendency to react only when a problem has reached the crisis stage.
Examples from Pearl Harbor to Sept. 11, and even California's energy
debacle, come easily to mind. All problems that could have been
anticipated should have been. This tendency has been costly in lives
and money, but we've managed--so far.</LD>
<LD>   If we don't give early recognition to the problem of global
warming, before the crisis stage, Mother Nature may not give us
enough time to react or adapt to the change we have created in our
environment.</LD>

<HD>Billboard-Size Rhetoric</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The City Council on Wednesday made it sound as if billboards were as
welcome in Los Angeles as Al Qaeda training camps. "Scourge."
"Destroying our city." "Ruining neighborhoods." That's how
impassioned the rhetoric got as council members debated the merits of
proposals to ban new signs and beef up ineffectual efforts to bring
down the thousands of illegal ones that make parts of the city so
ugly.</LD>
<LD>   Alas, it's still too early to tell whether our leaders are finally
getting serious about going after these eyesores or are merely
angling for a good sound bite while keeping a hand out for the free
ads and campaign bounty this industry so notoriously offers.</LD>
<LD>   There is, however, reason to hope. This is not, after all, the
same council that last summer dutifully passed billboard regulation
that had, in essence, been dictated by sign company executives.
Promising Angelenos that they would remove more than a thousand signs
around the city, the outdoor advertisers sought the right to put up
70 billboards along local freeways--on sites that previously were
off-limits.</LD>
<TE>   The deal sounded much better than it was for people sick of seeing
their streets forested with gigantic steel poles and in-your-face
ads. In truth, companies would get to ditch their least profitable
signs in exchange for new, humongous signs that would generate
millions in revenue. The council obediently approved the plan and
asked planners and the city attorney to draft an ordinance--a process
that's still going on.</TE>
<TE>   What a difference an election makes. With eight new council
members and public outrage rising with every new billboard that
sprouts, momentum has shifted dramatically. On Wednesday, Councilman
Jack Weiss presented his colleagues with a strong, simple proposal:
Give city inspectors more muscle and spring for enough of them (four
now oversee the city's 10,000 billboards) to bring down the scofflaw
signs. He'd pay for this with an annual permit fee on each sign.</TE>
<TE>   Weiss' measure nicely complements a motion that Cindy Miscikowski
introduced last week to permanently ban all new billboards in the
city, except in special districts like Hollywood, where some
residents consider them part of the neighborhood's character. Her
measure comes before the Planning and Land Use Committee next week.
It too should pass.</TE>
<TE>   When Weiss' ordinance came up Wednesday, council members fell over
one another vowing to "crack down" on the estimated 4,000 illegal
signs citywide. The ordinance failed by just one vote to get the
required 12 unanimous ayes required to pass on the first reading.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes back to the council next week, the proposal needs
only a simple majority to pass. Between now and then, should any of
Weiss' council supporters have second thoughts, they might recall the
hourlong parade of residents venting spleen about the signs looming
over their homes and businesses. These folks vote, and there's
thousands more who think just as they do.</TE>

<LD>As this is written, there is no way to know the truth about the fate
of Wall Street Journal correspondent Daniel Pearl, whom kidnappers
abducted in Karachi, Pakistan, on Jan. 23. But then truth is
something that people who threaten journalists fear.</LD>
<LD>   Pearl's kidnappers have kept changing the stories they use to
rationalize their actions. First they accused Pearl of being a CIA
agent. Later they said he worked for Israeli intelligence. Both
claims are phony justifications for their crime.</LD>
<LD>   Daniel Pearl is a journalist. As such, he does indeed gather
information. But a reporter's intentions couldn't be more different
from those of a spy. Spies are secretive. Journalists use print,
radio, television or the Internet to broadcast information as widely
as possible, to share what they have found with the world.</LD>
<TE>   Danny, as his colleagues call him, went to Pakistan to find out
what was really going on and to tell the world what he found. His
pregnant wife, Mariane, said he had been learning Urdu to better
understand the people whose stories he felt a need to tell.</TE>
<TE>   Good people and groups with righteous causes know that journalists
are their best hope for getting the word out and--if others agree
with their message or empathize with their plight--for garnering
support. They know that threatening, kidnapping or killing these
surrogates for the wider public is counterproductive.</TE>
<TE>   What people around the globe also need to realize--and what
self-conscious practitioners of the trade are often reluctant to
say--is that the most essential characteristic for correspondents is
courage. They go to each assignment knowing what these kidnappers
apparently do not: that a newspaper cannot and would not exchange
prisoners for a journalist. That the United States government will
not negotiate such a deal--as the Islamic extremists who in 1985
kidnapped Terry Anderson, the Associated Press bureau chief in
Lebanon, found out over the seven years they held him.</TE>
<TE>   If the people who kidnapped Pearl had talked to him instead, the
world might have had a chance to evaluate their grievances and
ideals. Now they'll be judged solely--and harshly--for their
shortsighted criminality. Their one last hope for sympathy is tied to
Pearl's safe release.</TE>

<HD>In Defense of John Walker Lindh's Parents</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GLENN SACKS</AU>
<BD>Glenn Sacks is an adjunct professor of English as a
second language at College of the Canyons.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many Americans seem to want to put Marilyn Walker and Frank Lindh on
trial along with their son John. However, America could learn more
from what John Walker Lindh's parents did right than by what they did
wrong.</LD>
<LD>   There are three charges commonly leveled at Lindh's parents:</LD>
<LD>   * They stood by and allowed their son to become deeply involved in
a violent, anti-American religion. Islam, as a whole, isn't violent
or anti-American and isn't much different from other mainstream
monotheistic religions. Practitioners believe in giving charity to
the poor, submit to one God, etc. Lindh's parents no doubt valued the
salutary effects the religion had on their son, how it gave him a
sense of purpose and self-discipline, and helped to keep him away
from teenage scourges such as drugs and alcohol.</LD>
<TE>   I taught high school and I know a lot of parents who would have
loved to have seen their troubled sons make the same conversion. Do
we really think his parents should have anticipated that their son
would somehow adopt the extreme, pseudo-religious insanity of the
Taliban?</TE>
<TE>   * They encouraged and subsidized their son's descent by paying for
John's 1998 trip to Yemen to study Islam and later by sending him
$1,200 while he was at a religious school in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Look at the situation as it must have appeared to Lindh's parents
in 1998. They probably thought, correctly, that travel is good for
young people because it broadens their horizons. Perhaps they
understood that young people who can't travel or follow their desires
often feel stifled and deprived later in life when they are saddled
with families and responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   Also, it is natural, and even admirable, that John would want to
study his religion in some of the countries where it is deepest and
strongest. Most American parents would be proud of their sons or
daughters if they wanted to travel to Rome to study Catholicism or to
Israel to study Judaism. Perhaps they were impressed by his
willingness to learn Arabic and hoped that one day this would be an
excellent job skill.</TE>
<TE>   This criticism is based on the utterly fanciful notion that if
parents firmly implant moral and political values in a child, when
that child becomes a teenager he or she will follow them instead of
rebelling.</TE>
<TE>   * Even now, when they see what their son did, they defend him--a
clear example of the moral vacuum that caused the problem in the
first place.</TE>
<TE>   Marilyn and Frank appear to be trying to protect their son from a
public that has prejudged him guilty. What parents wouldn't?</TE>
<TE>   Lindh's parents have weaknesses, like any other parents, but they
also have important strengths. The biggest of these is that, although
they're divorced, rather than attacking or carping at each other,
they've stood united in defense of the son they love. In so doing,
they set a fine example for the millions of American parents who
selfishly break their children's hearts by trying to turn their
children against the other parent.</TE>
<TE>   At each step along the way Lindh's parents have tried to deal with
their enigmatic son with intelligence and compassion. Those who
vilify them have forgotten one of life's most important lessons:
Sometimes you do the right thing and it still doesn't work.</TE>

<HD>Senior Lead Officers Belong in the Field</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRY SCHAUER</AU>
<BD>Terry Schauer is a retired LAPD officer.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a retired L.A. police officer and resident of the city, I follow
the articles on LAPD Chief Bernard Parks' quest for another term.</LD>
<LD>   One issue frequently brought up in discussions about Parks'
effectiveness is the battle over the senior lead officers program and
the heat the chief took from the community when he decided to put the
SLOs back in the field--a decision that he has since reversed.</LD>
<LD>   I retired in March 2000 after serving 30 proud years with the
LAPD. The last 23 years were as a SLO for the Rancho Park community.
Parks' decision to put the SLOs back in the field was a correct one,
and he should have stuck to his guns.</LD>
<TE>   When I was a rookie in 1970, I was part of a basic car--a patrol
car assigned permanently to a particular neighborhood, which was
under the supervision of a SLO. At that time, all nine officers
assigned to basic cars attended monthly community meetings. All
officers would handle community concerns and problems and contact
appropriate agencies to assist where necessary. All officers were
familiar with crime and traffic problems in their assigned areas. All
officers performed community tasks and worked as a team.</TE>
<TE>   Fast-forward to the late 1990s. The SLOs were no longer working in
the field, banished instead to a back room, a trailer or an off-site
location. Most SLOs never wore a uniform and were virtually unknown
to most of the patrol officers in the station. SLOs became the
dumping ground for every complaint, project, concern that no one else
wanted to handle. Patrol officers and supervisors would routinely
tell citizens to "call your SLO" and drive away, not taking the extra
few minutes to give a competent referral or conduct a follow up that
would have solved the problem then and there.</TE>
<TE>   Community policing was the "SLOs' job," according to most patrol
officers and supervisors. The chief saw this was a problem and in
response moved the SLOs back into the field. He hoped to return
things to the way they had been but instead fell pressure to
complaints from an "elite" group of citizens who treated the SLOs as
their personal lackeys.</TE>
<TE>   Their response was shortsighted and self-serving. They wanted to
ensure that "their" SLO remained available for whatever picayune task
they could invent. So, buckling to pressure, Chief Parks removed his
most capable and experienced officers from the field.</TE>
<TE>   I must thank the chief for making my last years on the LAPD
memorable. I returned to being a top-producing field officer and a
peer leader, and I worked with and trained many fine young officers.
I enjoyed my job, and routinely I met people who said, "Gee, I spoke
to you on the phone a while back. I didn't know you were an actual
police officer." It felt great to actually be a police officer again.</TE>

<LD>Mormon 'Sea Trek' Hits Stormy Financial Waters</LD>
<LD>   Last year's transatlantic re-creation of a Mormon migration from
Northern Europe to Utah has turned into a financial nightmare for
organizers, with three Norwegian ships demanding $530,000 in unpaid
bills.</LD>
<LD>   Bill and DeAnn Sadleir of Salt Lake City organized the 59-day
voyage, known as Sea Trek 2001, from Denmark to New York City, to
commemorate the 85,000 Mormon converts who left Europe. According to
the Salt Lake Tribune, the Sadleirs were not able to sell all the
spaces on the ships and so far have not paid three Norwegian ships
the $530,000 owed to them. In addition, the couple owe about $43,000
to a Russian ship.</LD>
<TE>   Pope to Lawyers: Don't Help End Marriages</TE>
<TE>   VATICAN CITY--Calling divorce a "plague" that has "devastating
consequences" for all of society, Pope John Paul II urged Catholic
lawyers and judges this week not to cooperate in the dissolving of
marriages.</TE>
<TE>   The Roman Catholic pontiff told judges and lawyers of the Roman
Rota that the "indissolubility" of marriage is "good for the married
couple, for their children, for the church and for all of humanity."</TE>
<TE>   Britain Returns Looted Ethiopian Relic</TE>
<TE>   LONDON--An oblong wooden box that was part of the loot seized by
British forces in an attack on the Ethiopian Emperor Tewodros in 1868
and that ended up in a church in Edinburgh, Scotland, is on its way
back to Ethiopia.</TE>
<TE>   The box, called the "tabot," represents the Ark of the Covenant.
It was handed over this week at a ceremony in St. John's Episcopal
Church, where it was discovered last year by the rector, the Rev.
John McLuckie.</TE>
<TE>   Church of Today Leader Vows to Stay in Group</TE>
<TE>   WARREN, Mich.--A best-selling New Age author and leader of the
Church of Today said her congregation won't be quitting the Assn. of
Unity Churches.</TE>
<TE>   Marianne Williamson said a handful of her 2,300 members threatened
to file suit if the church proceeded with a planned break.</TE>
<TE>   Open House Set for a Mormon Temple</TE>
<TE>   PHOENIX--Arizona's second Mormon temple, perched on a butte above
the tiny town of Snowflake, goes on public display during a two-week
open house beginning today. It will serve nearly 35,000 members of
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in northeastern
Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the town's 5,600 residents--half of them non-Mormon--hope
it will help make Snowflake a boomtown that draws Mormon pilgrims and
retirees.</TE>
<TE>   Iranians to Be Allowed to Fly to Holy Sites in Iraq</TE>
<TE>   TEHRAN--Iraq said it would allow Shiite Muslim pilgrims from Iran
to fly to visit holy shrines in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq's visiting Foreign Minister Naji Sabri was quoted by the
state news agency as saying the air route between the two countries
"will be opened soon."</TE>
<TE>   Pilgrims now travel by land. In July 1998, Iraq agreed to allow
12,000 Iranians a month to visit its holy cities of Karbala and
Najaf.</TE>
<TE>   Westmont College Installs Its 7th President</TE>
<TE>   Westmont College, an evangelical Christian school near Santa
Barbara, has inaugurated Stan D. Gaede as the seventh president of
the 60-year-old school.</TE>
<TE>   Gaede, who replaces David Winter, has been working in the post
since July. Winter retired after a 25-year stint as head of the
college.</TE>
<TE>   The new president is a graduate of Westmont, where he finished in
1969 before earning a doctorate in sociology at Vanderbilt University
in Nashville in 1974.</TE>

<LD>Iraq said it would allow Shiite Muslim pilgrims from Iran to fly to
visit holy shrines in Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Iraq's visiting Foreign Minister Naji Sabri was quoted by the
state news agency as saying the air route between the two countries
"will be opened soon."</LD>
<LD>   Pilgrims now travel by land. In July 1998, Iraq agreed to allow
12,000 Iranians a month to visit its holy cities of Karbala and
Najaf.</LD>

<HD>CKE Says Quarterly Sales Beat Forecasts</HD>
<DH>Food: Firm still expects a loss but says gains at Carl's
Jr. and Hardee's bolster its predictions that it will return to
profitability soon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CKE Restaurants Inc., buoyed by good weather and its successful "$6
burger" promotion, rang up sales in the fourth quarter that exceeded
expectations, the company said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The stock, which more than tripled over the last year, climbed
Friday to a 52-week high of $10.85 before closing at $10.80, up 90
cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<LD>   Although the Anaheim-based company expects to post a
fourth-quarter loss, its ninth consecutive quarter in the red, sales
gains at its Carl's Jr. and Hardee's fast-food restaurants bolstered
CKE's earlier predictions that it would return to profitability early
this year. Analysts expect CKE to report a loss of 2 cents a share
for the quarter, according to a survey by Thomson Financial/First
Call.</LD>
<TE>   Sales were much stronger than expected at Hardee's, which has been
a drain on CKE since the company acquired the chain in 1998. Sales of
restaurants open at least a year--a key industry measure--jumped 6.4%
for the three months ended Jan. 28, according to preliminary reports.
Same-store sales at Carl's Jr. increased 4.3%. The company had been
expecting sales increases of 1% at Hardee's and 2% at Carl's Jr.
restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike such fast-food competitors as McDonald's Corp. and Taco
Bell, CKE has largely avoided price wars. The chain has instead
focused on higher-priced and more profitable premium products,
including the "$6 burger," said restaurant consultant Randall Hiatt
of Fessel International in Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   At Hardee's, the gourmet hamburger, which actually sells for
$3.95, has generated strong sales since it was added to the chain's
menu in late November, said CKE's director of finance, Steven Posey.
The promotion was expanded to Hardee's after boosting Carl's Jr.
sales for five months.</TE>

<LD>British music giant EMI Group restructured its U.S. sector Friday,
ousting the heads of its stagnant Virgin Records division and
announcing a plan to move the label's headquarters this year from
Beverly Hills to New York.</LD>
<LD>   The shake-up comes barely a week after EMI dumped Virgin star
Mariah Carey and signals the end of an era at Virgin--a decade
dominated by Virgin honcho Nancy Berry, who was fired in November
along with her former husband and boss, Ken Berry.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Virgin executives Ray Cooper and Ashley Newton will be
replaced by pop producer Matt Serletic, who has scored recent hits
for such acts as Matchbox 20, Carlos Santana, Aerosmith and Celine
Dion. Virgin's new chairman, Serletic, who has not run a major label,
will be teamed with EMI executive Roy Lott, whose new title will be
president and chief operating officer.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, EMI music chief Alain Levy also promoted David Munns to
chairman of the British music giant's North America sector. Andy
Slater will retain his title as president of EMI's other top label,
Hollywood-based Capitol Records.</TE>

<LD>"Olympics Scrambles to Bridge Generation Gap" (Jan. 27) was no
surprise to me. I am 31 years old, and my interest in the Olympic
Games has been lacking for the past 10 years, but not for the reasons
you listed. I am frustrated every time I turn on the TV during the
Olympics to be treated to figure skating or gymnastics. There are
other sports and, believe it or not, people want to see them.</LD>
<LD>   Most young people today do not relate to the drama and competition
of the Olympics because they are not able to see much of the
competition. There is a lot to be said about watching a sporting
event live, from beginning to end, versus seeing continual
highlights.</LD>
<LD>   If only NBC could take advantage of today's technology and utilize
many more channels to show more events live. The more NBC takes away
from the true athletics going on at the Games, the more it takes away
from the true Olympic spirit of competition and from young people's
understanding of what the Games are all about. Stop the circus and
show the Games.</LD>
<TE>   Alex Benoliel</TE>
<TE>   Lakewood</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One aspect you did not visit regarding the decline in Olympic
viewership is that it has become unbearable to watch because of the
amount of commercials. Every five minutes we're taken away to a
commercial break. I never thought I'd say this, but it's worse than
the NFL broadcasts. I wouldn't be surprised if you found a steady
increase of commercials per hour correlating with the decline in
viewership.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Davey</TE>
<TE>   Temecula</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I can't believe that Olympic organizers cannot figure out why the
Games are considered irrelevant. Network television has destroyed
young viewer interest by packaging the show strictly for prime time.
The main events are heavily advertised at the beginning of the
evening, when the sappy human-interest stories are shown in an effort
to trap viewers into wasting their entire evening. By the time the
marquee events come on--around 11 p.m.--the young people (and a lot
of older ones) have given up.</TE>
<TE>   We've tried to keep our kids interested by videotaping, but after
a while the tapes just pile up going unwatched. It is so stupid and
arrogant of the so-called "savvy marketers" to think that throwing in
the Dixie Chicks and LeAnn Rimes will bring the people back. Kids
watch the X Games because they are on during a convenient time
period!</TE>

<HD>Gabler on Class Conflict</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Neal Gabler's "Class Dismissed" (Opinion, Jan. 27) suggests, class
warfare was over and done with in the U.S. years ago and, through
distortion, distraction and misdirection, the wealthy won the war.
Wealth accumulates in the hands of a few, while most struggle to pay
off their debts. The irony is that the primary function of our
national and local governments, as they stand today, is the
protection and production of wealth.</LD>
<LD>   From the U.S. military to the local fire department, our tax
dollars are spent to protect corporate interests and the interests of
those who least need protection. Even when a fire department saves a
home owned by a typical middle-class family, it is the wealth of
insurance companies that it protects. Perhaps income taxes should be
abolished and wealth taxes instituted. That seems to me to be a more
equitable way for the government to raise money. Those who benefit
most should pay most.</LD>
<LD>   Michael J. Farrell</LD>
<TE>   Canoga Park</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For years I have been saying the middle class is being eradicated.
Gabler stated, "The middle class will keep losing ground." I used to
consider myself substantially middle class. Now I am being pushed
into being one of the poor, with the unfortunate circumstance of not
being poor enough, yet not being affluent enough, to obtain services
and benefits I need or would like. As far as deciding to make my
fortune, it seems that time has eluded me, no matter what efforts I
have put forth.</TE>
<TE>   I continue to put one foot in front of the other, while losing
ground steadily, and see no solution. This administration only cares
about enhancing the fortunes of corporations and, in doing so,
continues to squeeze people like me out of the picture.</TE>
<TE>   Marsha E. Huberman</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gabler's column bemoans the loss of "class conflict" as though it
were one of the great, uplifting political movements of modern times.
While I feel no unhappiness over its apparent lack of current success
with the citizenry, I do feel that Gabler is being somewhat
disingenuous when he states that "we don't hear that kind of talk
anymore." In point of fact, fomenting class warfare has long been a
key element of the Democratic Party's playbook and remains so today.
The difference is that today it is better known as the politics of
"victimization." No one is responsible for his or her actions or lack
of income or lack of status because we are all at the mercy of the
malevolent actions of the wealthy and powerful.</TE>
<TE>   Government, according to Gabler, is the "only instrumentality that
could possibly remedy unfairness," presumably through taxation, which
Gabler supports as a "tool for correcting an imbalance." Government
is supposed to make life fair? I thought that government was supposed
to use taxes to protect us from terrorists and maybe fix the roads. I
didn't know that social engineering was part of the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Newell</TE>
<TE>   Trabuco Canyon</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gabler's fine article helps explain the demise of the troika of
big government, big management and big labor that kept this country
in equilibrium from the Depression through the '60s. The demise of
labor and the capturing of government by corporate America have
reduced the system to a monolithic holding company. The brainwashing
of the American public was no less systematic, albeit more subtle,
than what we have seen in foreign regimes.</TE>
<TE>   When the unemployed, non-unionized laborer argues that he/she is a
capitalist, there can be little hope of change.</TE>
<TE>   Mayer Gerson</TE>
<TE>   Northridge</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gabler laments the loss of class warfare as a political issue of
our day. With condescension, he describes a middle class that has
undergone "a national brainwashing" because it doesn't press for
higher taxes on "the rich." Quite possibly the middle class
understands that greater taxes would mean its members' jobs would be
at risk and not some "luxury yacht" for a multimillionaire.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Moore</TE>
<TE>   Westlake Village</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gabler is right, of course. The myth of the self-made man has been
peddled by everyone from Rockefeller to Reagan. And Americans have
swallowed that myth whole, choosing to believe that they'll be the
one in a thousand to win the working-class lottery. But in the face
of an ever-widening chasm between the rich and the rest, how long
will that myth forestall social revolution?</TE>
<TE>   Unless the wealthy accept their responsibility to the society that
fostered them, America is doomed to become a land of gated
communities and slums. The price to reverse that march to madness is
not great, but the wealthy must pay their fair share.</TE>
<TE>   If they won't do it voluntarily, government (meaning the rest of
us) must force them.</TE>

<LD>Graham Fuller ("Bush Must See Past the Acts of Terror to the Root
Causes," Commentary, Jan. 29) puts the cart before the horse. He
writes, "Ending the occupation is the sole means of beginning to
attain peace." In reality, the first step must be the creation of a
belief that a bordering Palestinian state will not be a security
threat to Israel. Israel had such a belief while Ehud Barak and
Yasser Arafat were negotiating, but it disappeared when Arafat turned
down, without even a counteroffer, Barak's offer of Palestinian
statehood with a part of Jerusalem as the capital.</LD>
<LD>   Arafat's main excuse for rejecting Barak's offer was that it did
not give refugees the right to return to Israel proper, which, if
granted, would subsequently have led to the demise of the Jewish
state. This revealed the "real" Arafat, one who wants the elimination
of Israel. The failure of Arafat to erase that image, by not
curtailing violence, is why President Bush, Ariel Sharon and even the
dovish Israeli left feel that Arafat is no longer a relevant
negotiating partner. Bush and Sharon are right. The first step on the
road to peace is to curb the violence.</LD>
<LD>   The Palestinians will have their state as soon as a majority of
Israelis is convinced that the new state will not be a security
threat to Israel.</LD>

<TE>   Bush may be making the worst mistake of his career by distancing
the United States from Arafat while welcoming Sharon to the White
House on Feb. 7. The only way the U.S. should get involved in this
tragic and violent crisis is by attempting to broker peace.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon does not represent the majority of the people of Israel; he
is a hawk who intends to provoke a war and win it. His escalating
battle of retaliation uses the extremists among Palestinians. As they
violently avenge the latest Israeli action, public opinion in Israel
and the U.S. turns against the Palestinians. This creates room for
Sharon to launch an attack on the PLO and retake the territories, all
in the name of "ending terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Bush has surrounded himself with advisors known for
their right-wing beliefs and hawkishness. They may even believe that
destruction of the PLO leadership would bring about peace. For the
U.S. to fall into Sharon's plan--to give him a green light, in
effect, by welcoming him to the White House--is to risk a
conflagration in the Middle East that surely will not end there.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Palestinians Have an Alternative to Terror," letter, Jan. 28:
Aaron Levinson is right, the Palestinians do have an alternative to
terror, but so do the Israelis. Violence used to induce fear for the
sake of political change is terrorism, and it is wrong, even if a
state commits it.</TE>
<TE>   Israel has not made a reasonable offer to the Palestinians. The
so-called generous offer at Camp David divided Palestine into three
sections, with Israel controlling all travel between. It also did not
address the right of return or the Old City of Jerusalem, and it left
Israel in control of all of Palestine's borders, as well as a host of
other problems. The Israeli government and the Palestinian terrorists
are mirror images; both are committed to violence, not peace.</TE>

<TE>   President Bush's comments expressing disappointment with Arafat
were not only unfortunate but untimely ("Arafat Helping Foster
Terror, Bush Declares," Jan. 26). Arafat has virtually been made a
prisoner, surrounded by Israeli tanks, while F-16 fighters are
destroying the police facilities that he is supposed to use in order
to arrest the militants who have been terrorizing Israel. This
administration is in the process of destroying any influence this
nation has for fairness and credibility in solving this complicated
situation. It may be time for the European Union or United Nations to
intercede, or else the matter may explode into unimaginable violence.</TE>

<HD>New Bible Edition to Be Gender-Neutral</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The evangelical publisher Zondervan and the International Bible
Society this week announced plans to publish an edition of the Bible
called "Today's New International Version," an adaptation of the
popular "NIV" that will include some gender-neutral references.</LD>
<LD>   The new version, which is being called the TNIV, will change 7%
from the NIV, officials of Grand Rapids, Mich.-based Zondervan and
the Bible society said.</LD>
<LD>   Among the changes: "Sons of God" will become "children of God" and
"brothers" will be translated as "brothers and sisters" when scholars
determined that the original text did not intend a gender. References
to God and Jesus will remain masculine.</LD>
<TE>   "We firmly believe that to effect positive change in our world, we
must communicate with today's generations in the English they are
being taught and that they speak," Peter Bradley, president of the
Colorado Springs, Colo.-based Bible society, said in a statement. "To
accomplish this mission, we must make certain that Scripture is
presented in a way that is unquestionably accurate and perfectly
clear."</TE>
<TE>   Other changes in the new version include describing Mary, the
mother of Jesus, as "'pregnant" rather than "with child." Jesus will
be called Messiah rather than Christ when the text refers to belief
in his messianic status but will still be called Jesus Christ when
Christ is used as part of his personal name.</TE>
<TE>   Also, some references to Jews will be more specific, using phrases
such as "the Jews there" or "the Jewish leaders."</TE>
<TE>   The TNIV translation of the New Testament will be released in the
spring and the complete text, including the Old Testament, is
scheduled to appear in 2005. The NIV will continue to be published.</TE>
<TE>   "With the confidence of IBS, we look forward to the responsibility
of bringing this new edition to millions of people around the world
who will receive a fresh, new, accurate understanding of God's word,"
Bruce Ryskamp, chief executive and president of Zondervan, said in
the statement.</TE>
<TE>   The older version's gender usage became hotly disputed in 1997
when World magazine, a conservative weekly, reported that the Bible
society was working on an inclusive-language revision.</TE>
<TE>   The society had already produced such an edition with a British
publisher.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention, the largest U.S.
Protestant denomination, criticized the language change in 1997, as
did James Dobson of the influential organization Focus on the Family.</TE>
<TE>   After meeting with critics, the Bible society said it would halt
publication of Britain's inclusive edition and had "abandoned all
plans for gender-related changes in future editions of the New
International Version."</TE>
<TE>   The Bible society isn't quite abandoning its pledge because it is
not discontinuing publication of the NIV.</TE>

<HD>A Diverse Array of Seekers, Deeply in Touch With the
Transcendent</HD>
<DH>SPIRITUAL GENIUS: THE MASTERY OF LIFE'S MEANING, by
Winifred Gallagher. Random House: $24.95, 304 pages</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN KIRSCH</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"All of us use spiritual genius some of the time," insists Winifred
Gallagher in "Spiritual Genius," "but some of us use it all of the
time."</LD>
<LD>   That's what inspired Gallagher to seek out 11 examples of
"spiritual genius," which she defines broadly (and rather blandly) as
"the uniquely human ability to seek life's meaning."</LD>
<LD>   But she lets us see that spirituality finds vivid expression in
the lives of the men and women profiled here, among them "a low-key
Hindu doctor, a passionate Muslim scholar, a sociable Talmudist, a
witty Buddhist hermit, [and] a workaholic Christian social reformer."</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, the callings of these "spiritual geniuses" are as diverse
as their religious backgrounds. Rabbi Lawrence Kushner, for example,
is a thoroughly modern Jew who says medieval texts of Jewish
mysticism offer "a diagram of the DNA of the universe," a stance that
inspired one rabbi to say Kushner "sells Hasidic mysticism to Reform
Jews."</TE>
<TE>   The Venerable Tenzin Palmo, born Diane Perry in a Cockney area of
London, is a Buddhist nun who "has spent most of 12 years--three of
them uninterrupted--in solitary retreat in a remote Himalayan cave at
13,000 feet." And Mata Amritanandamayi, "popularly known as India's
hugging saint," is revered by her followers as an incarnation of
Devi, the mother goddess of the universe. "The unique ministry of
this up-close-and-personal goddess is as simple and earthy as it is
profound," writes Gallagher. "Over the past 25 years [she] has spent
from five to 15 hours a day embracing all comers--so far, some 20
million."</TE>
<TE>   "Spiritual Genius" has its lighter moments. Gallagher attends a
meeting of the Assn. of Contemplative Sisters--founded by cloistered
Catholic nuns "to support the individual spiritual genius of each
sister"--and finds "a chorus line of women, mostly of a certain age,
costumed as Mouseketeers, movie queens, cowgirls and other L.A.
types," all of them belting out "California, Here I Come" to the
delight of their fellow contemplatives.</TE>
<TE>   The most compelling examples, however, are those who are called to
the things of this world. Brother James Kimpton is a British Catholic
monk who runs schools and settlements in one of India's poorest
backwaters. His daily concerns have far less to do with meditation
than with feeding the hungry, sheltering the homeless and comforting
the sick.</TE>
<TE>   "Back home, religion--or, more often, spirituality--is
increasingly an aspect of 'personal fulfillment,'" says Gallagher,
"but to Brother, it's a literal response to Jesus' statement:
'Whatever you do to the least of my brethren, you do to me.' "</TE>
<TE>   Another example is Riffat Hassan, born in Pakistan and now living
and teaching in America.</TE>
<TE>   She is an Islamic feminist theologian and a human rights activist
who speaks out against the abuse of women by fundamentalists in the
Muslim world. The group she founded, the International Network for
Rights of Female Victims of Violence in Pakistan, is devoted to the
victims of "honor killings"--women murdered by male relatives on
suspicion of adultery or other alleged behavior that impugns the
family honor.</TE>
<TE>   "In a society constructed on the true basis of Islam," she says,
"men and women would be equal, as they are in the sight of God."</TE>
<TE>   Gallagher understands the awkwardness of presenting a gallery of
mystics and healers at the very moment when we have been reminded
that spiritual fervor has its dark side, but she suggests that each
person in her book has something important to teach us.</TE>
<TE>   "Following history's bloodiest century, our hopes for this new one
have already been shaken by appalling acts of terrorism," she writes.
"We're deeply disillusioned with institutions, including religious
ones, but we still hunger for the meaning and authority they once
supplied."</TE>
<TE>   Above all, she insists that the answer to religious fanaticism is
to be found in religious diversity.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been as inconceivable to my husband's English and
Romanian ancestors to look beyond their Protestant and Jewish
traditions for spiritual teachings as for my Irish ones to venture
outside the Catholic Church," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, Protestants, Jews and Catholics may hear teachers from other
traditions from their own congregations' pulpits or take yoga or Zen
classes in their basements."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Kirsch, a Book Review contributor, is author of, most
recently, "The Woman Who Laughed at God: The Untold History of the
Jewish People."</TE>

<HD>Inge Morath, 78; Magnum Portrait Photographer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Photographer Inge Morath, whose artistry elevated portraits of the
famous as well as images of foreign cultures and sights as
commonplace as a person at a piano, died Wednesday of lymphomic
cancer at a New York City hospital. One of the first women admitted
to the international photo agency Magnum, she was 78.</LD>
<LD>   Best known as a portraitist whose works hang in the permanent
collections of many museums, Morath photographed notables as diverse
as Jean Cocteau, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Eleanor Roosevelt and
Marilyn Monroe.</LD>
<LD>   She married one of her subjects, playwright Arthur Miller, after
his divorce from Monroe. She and Miller collaborated on several books
during their nearly 40-year marriage.</LD>
<TE>   Among her most famous shots is one of Monroe in a black cocktail
dress, lost in thought and kicking up leaves in the Nevada desert.
She traveled through Iran in the 1950s, cloaking her cameras beneath
a chador, and talked her way into a Spanish matador's dressing room
before a crucial fight, armed only with her Leica and straightforward
charm.</TE>
<TE>   "She has a brilliant sense of place, of the surprising couched in
the commonplace, whether it be Africa or Russia or New England,"
Ralph Pomeroy wrote in the book "Contemporary Photographers."</TE>
<TE>   Morath was born in Graz, Austria, the daughter of two scientists.
She grew up in Berlin during the rise of Hitler and studied Romance
languages in college. After World War II started and she refused to
join the Nazi student movement, she had to leave school and assemble
plane parts at a Berlin factory while bombs rained down.</TE>
<TE>   When the Russians entered Berlin, she joined a stream of refugees
out of the city and walked to Salzburg to find out if her parents
were still alive. She found them, but nearly died in the process.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Morath moved to London and married British
journalist Lionel Birch. She also began to learn photography from
Simon Guttman, art editor of Picture Post.</TE>
<TE>   By 1953 she had divorced Birch and was working at Magnum's Paris
office with Robert Capa and Henri Cartier-Bresson, two of the
founding members of the cooperative that was turning photojournalism
into art.</TE>
<TE>   Her first job was editing contact sheets for various members, but
particularly for Cartier-Bresson. He taught her to look at images
upside-down, as painters do, to judge their composition.</TE>
<TE>   From Capa she learned that a photo "comes from inside.'' This was
an important discovery, she said, "because I was ashamed to speak
German after the war, a millstone of guilt, so a picture was like
daring to say 'love.'"</TE>
<TE>   She joined Magnum as a full-fledged member in 1955. She and Eve
Arnold became the first women admitted to the intensely macho club.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of them did say, 'Here comes a woman, how dare she take
pictures,'" she recalled. "But I was very single-minded then and I
didn't give a damn what the others thought."</TE>
<TE>   In time, she proved she was as tough and resourceful as the
others.</TE>
<TE>   In Spain to photograph the running of the bulls, she won rare
permission to enter a famous matador's dressing room. It was
considered bad luck for a woman to see the fighter before the fight,
but she convinced him that when she was taking pictures she was not
looking at him "with womanly eyes" but doing a job.</TE>
<TE>   In Iran in the 1950s, she was allowed to photograph Muslim men at
ritual exercises after winning their favor with gifts of Polaroid
shots.</TE>
<TE>   During Ramadan, she sneaked inside a grand mosque to photograph
the worshiping men, prostrate on the floor. One man sat up and
alerted the others, who began throwing stones at her. Fortunately,
she said, "there weren't too many [stones] on the floor there ... and
I just got out very fast."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Cartier-Bresson, who clicked his shutter at a decisive
moment in the action, Morath often waited until the drama passed and
her subject was at ease. A well-known portrait of Cocteau shows the
natty poet, artist and filmmaker nearly reclining on a ledge near a
fireplace, distractedly pointing his finger one way and looking
another. The shot came after a period of antic posing nearly
everywhere else in the room. "It is so him," Morath recalled many
years later, "because he is almost in flight, already on to the next
thing."</TE>
<TE>   Her moxie would be unquestioned after an event in early 1959. She
had been assigned to shoot the filming of John Huston's "The
Unforgiven" in Mexico. She was with the director on a duck hunting
trip to Durango when she spotted two men struggling in a nearby lake.
One of the men was the movie's star, World War II hero Audie Murphy.
Stripped to her underwear, Morath plunged in and towed Murphy back to
land by her bra strap. In thanks he gave her the watch he had carried
throughout the war.</TE>
<TE>   In 1961, Magnum sent Morath to the location of another Huston
film, "The Misfits." Written by Miller, the movie starred Clark
Gable, Montgomery Clift and Monroe.</TE>
<TE>   Her famous shot of Monroe caught the actress reciting lines to
herself when she thought no one was looking. Of all the famous shots
of the 1950s icon, many seem exploitative, but Morath's focus is
elsewhere. "I liked her," Morath said. "I liked that kind of dreamy
quality she sometimes had."</TE>
<TE>   Monroe, according to Miller, took to the photographer immediately,
"appreciating her kindness and the absence--remarkable in a
photographer--of all aggression. She doted a little on the pictures
Inge Morath had taken of her, sensing real affection in them."</TE>
<TE>   Morath said she took little more than a professional interest in
Miller then. But he had noticed the "slender, noble-looking young
woman with bobbed hair and European accent, who seemed," he wrote in
his 1987 memoir, 'both shy and strong at the same time." After his
marriage to Monroe disintegrated, he married Morath in 1962.</TE>
<TE>   They traveled extensively together and turned some of their
experiences into the books "In Russia" (1969) and "Chinese
Encounters" (1979), for which Morath spent four years learning
Mandarin. When Morath wanted to stay closer to home to raise their
daughter, Rebecca, he wrote and she photographed "In the Country"
(1977), about rural Connecticut.</TE>
<TE>   Morath, who lived in New York and Roxbury, Conn., is survived by
her husband, their daughter and a grandson.</TE>

<HD>Hockey Boosters Score Big With Rink</HD>
<DH>New facility in Mar Vista is the first of its kind built in
a city park. One dad's vision and persistence made the difference.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN RODERICK</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While I was driving recently through my newly adopted Mar Vista
neighborhood, another recent arrival caught my eye and refused to let
go. The sight was so unexpected that I had to pull over and check it
out more closely.</LD>
<LD>   The newcomer looked out of place resting on what used to be
softball diamond No. 2 at Mar Vista Recreation Center. I knew the
field that once stood there. It was where, years before, the team I
played for clinched a championship trophy in a weekend warrior
league. I believe I even dinked a crucial hit to right field to aid
the cause that day.</LD>
<LD>   Since then--as a gift to myself for my 40th birthday--I'd given up
softball for roller hockey and endured a few embarrassing seasons
chasing 20-year-olds with more resilient knee joints. I gave up the
game without ever scoring a goal.</LD>
<TE>   As the first roller hockey facility constructed in a Los Angeles
city park, the Mar Vista rink marks the sport's coming of age. It
also represents a triumph of the city's network of citizen boards
that have been empowered to suggest ways to help the city's parks
better meet the needs of their neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   The origins of Mar Vista's state-of-the-art rink date to the early
1990s, when the popularity of hockey exploded in Southern California.
The phenomenon was due both to the advent of inline skates--which
made hockey moves easier and were cooler than the traditional
"quads"--and to the influence of the L.A. Kings' Wayne Gretzky, ice
hockey's consummate marketing tool.</TE>
<TE>   Gretzky, holder of most of the National Hockey League's important
scoring records, gave the downtrodden Kings new street credibility.
His charisma also led to Disney's Mighty Ducks landing in Anaheim.
All of this served to inflame local interest in youth hockey, both on
ice skates and on wheels. New ice rinks and pay-to-play roller hockey
facilities opened from North Hills to Orange County. Even so, finding
a safe and desirable place to play remained every puckster's dilemma,
which makes the new rink at Mar Vista a major addition.</TE>
<TE>   As outdoor rinks go, it's a beaut. The concrete skating surface is
smooth as ice. Fiberglass dasher boards surround the floor, just like
at frozen hockey rinks. Instead of glass, an enclosure of chain link
keeps wild pucks from flying onto Palms Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   In pickup games played on beach parking lots and schoolyards,
skaters shoot between upturned trash barrels. Here, there are goalies
who wear pads and guard actual nets. There's even an electric
scoreboard, plus team benches, penalty boxes and bleachers. Lights
too--sizzling white lamps on twin standards that are on most nights.</TE>
<TE>   It's all due to the vision of Tom Ponton, a Mar Vista father of
three who saw the need for a community hockey rink and who had the
time and persistence to move the city's bureaucracy. It's a story
with lessons for the advocates of improvements at other parks.</TE>
<TE>   Ponton had helped coach in his son's hockey league at nearby
Cheviot Hills Recreation Center and saw the program outgrow the small
gymnasium there. The same thing happened at Mar Vista, where demand
for hockey was squeezing basketball, volleyball and other activities
for gym time.</TE>
<TE>   As the chairman of Mar Vista's park advisory board, Ponton brought
up the idea of an outdoor rink to relieve pressure on the gym and to
give kids a good place to explore hockey.</TE>
<TE>   He learned that a decent concrete rink with boards and fences
would cost about $270,000. With help from the city, the board at Mar
Vista applied for a grant under Proposition K, a bond measure that
city voters approved in 1996 for improvements like this. They got
$247,000, enough to make the project possible.</TE>
<TE>   First, though, city parks officials had to be convinced that
hockey was deserving. The sport was being played in organized fashion
at only a few parks in the city. "They weren't too hot on the idea at
first," Ponton recalled. But the park advisory board collected 200
letters of support from local parents, schools and other
organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the parks department assigned grant writers to help
Mar Vista secure the main chunk of needed money. The parents also got
help from Lisa Gritzner, the chief deputy to City Councilwoman Cindy
Miscikowski. "I've learned that if you have trouble at the bottom,
you go to the top. She's been the project's guardian angel," Ponton
said.</TE>
<TE>   Fund-raising festivals and sponsors brought in the cash needed for
the scoreboard, bleachers and lights. Archstone Communities, a
development firm with plans to build apartments near the park, gave
$14,000.</TE>
<TE>   An additional $5,000 came from Operation Cleansweep, a city
program that helps fund beautification. Local businesses also chipped
in.</TE>
<TE>   Construction began in June, and the completed 175-by-75-foot rink
opened to skaters in November. Now, 182 boys and girls play on 16
teams organized by age and ability. Players range in age from 6 to
17. Each pays $70 and receives a jersey and trophies at a
season-ending banquet.</TE>
<TE>   Coaches and referees are provided, some of them from the UCLA ice
hockey team. The rules forbid body checking, but kids wear full
protective gear, including helmets.</TE>
<TE>   More than 50 adults have registered to play in pickup games
scheduled most evenings and Sundays. The rink is also open for public
skating two hours every Sunday at 11 a.m. but is closed when there
are no organized activities. Once the park hires someone to
supervise, the rink will be opened more hours.</TE>
<TE>   "Safety is going to be our first concern," said the park's
director, Dorothy Bamgboye.</TE>
<TE>   For now, no other municipal roller hockey facilities are planned.
The Mar Vista rink is something of an experiment, and parks officials
are happy to admit that it wouldn't have happened without Ponton and
the parents at Mar Vista.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a very strong park advisory board. It's what they
wanted and they were able to raise a lot of the money for it," said
Jane Kolb, a spokeswoman for Ellen Oppenheim, the city's general
manager for recreation and parks.</TE>
<TE>   Not that it was easy. Ponton first had to assuage neighborhood
concerns that the rink would draw rowdy crowds and be lighted too
brightly at night. The site was moved farther from nearby homes, but
then the park's baseball advocates had to be convinced that one of
Mar Vista's six diamonds was expendable.</TE>
<TE>   Ponton, a 52-year-old business owner, also had to master the
machinery of City Hall. "I've learned that you just have to go slow.
The bureaucracy is beatable, but you have to be patient."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the time spent was worth it. "Now we have this
state-of-the-art facility where the kids can play. I'm proud of it.
We really had a need for it."</TE>

<HD>The Case for 'Yellow Theology'</HD>
<DH>A former Buddhist preaches a style of Christian evangelism
that is sensitive to Asian culture.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>K. CONNIE KANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the first couple of years after he became a Christian, Dickson
Yagi, born in a Buddhist family in Hawaii, could hardly contain his
happiness at the thought of going to heaven.</LD>
<LD>   Then, as his new religion took hold, he began to worry about his
non-Christian relatives and friends. Were they headed for hell? Was
there no hope even for devout Buddhists, such as his beloved
grandfather, should they die without accepting Christ as their lord
and savior?</LD>
<LD>   Yagi went on to become a Southern Baptist minister, spending 27
years as a missionary in Japan, but he never forgot the way that
question ate at him. It shaped the style he used in trying to bring
Christianity to Japan, a style he calls "yellow theology": evangelism
that is sensitive to the religious and psychosocial history of people
of Asian ancestry.</LD>
<TE>   The third-generation Okinawan American's personal experiences
convinced him that the "good news" of Christianity can become
alienating "bad news" to potential Asian converts.</TE>
<TE>   "Many missionaries have ignored, condemned and ridiculed marvelous
elements in Asian culture through ignorance and misunderstanding,"
said Yagi, 64, who retired from missionary work in 2000 because of
prostate cancer, returned to the U.S. and eventually settled in Los
Angeles, where he specializes in Buddhist-Christian relations.</TE>
<TE>   Take ancestor worship. For centuries, Christian missionaries
warned potential East Asian converts that they would no longer be
able to engage in a practice Christians considered idolatry.</TE>
<TE>   Telling tradition-minded Asians that they can no longer bow in
front of the images of their ancestors at a memorial table, laden
with choice foods, was tantamount to condemning their way of life. It
clashed with one of their most cherished precepts--filial piety.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the Catholic Church dropped the prohibition. But
Protestant churches have not, creating frictions within Asian
families with Christian and non-Christian members.</TE>
<TE>   Yagi, a graduate of seminaries in America and Japan, counsels
Protestant missionaries to interpret ancestor worship less literally.</TE>
<TE>   "Worship in the Western context brings images of a weak man
standing before an omnipotent God," he writes in "Christ for Asia:
Yellow Theology for the East" in the faculty journal of the Southern
Baptist Theological Seminary.</TE>
<TE>   "In ancestor worship in Japan, however, the opposite is true.
Although the dead can haunt and harm the living, it is the dead who
are so utterly dependent on the living for rituals that guarantee
their well-being."</TE>
<TE>   Thus, ancestor respect, not ancestor worship, would more
accurately describe what takes place, Yagi said.</TE>
<TE>   "Japanese speak to the dead in the funeral service, at the home
Buddha altar and at the grave. They report family events. They talk
as if the person were still alive," he said. "This is not prayers of
adoration or prayers of supplication. They just say it feels good to
get their feelings out."</TE>
<TE>   Not Preaching a 'Terrible Message'</TE>
<TE>   It is the task of yellow theology, he said, "to squeeze the
Scriptures and see if any kind of minimum survival hope will ooze out
to soothe the agony of Asian Christians." In this case, the biblical
command to honor one's parents should take precedence. Working in
Japan, where Christians constitute less than 1% of the population,
Yagi could not bring himself to preach that only one in 100 Japanese
would go to heaven and the rest to hell. That sounded like a
"terrible message."</TE>
<TE>   So he delved into how to deal with the separation of a handful of
Christians from their loved ones and made it his life's work.</TE>
<TE>   He had been the first member of his Shingon Buddhist family to
convert to Christianity. As a small boy, he heard a visiting American
missionary from Japan speak at his church in Hilo, Hawaii. He was so
impressed with the missionary's knowledge of Japanese culture and
language that he felt as if he were hearing God himself.</TE>
<TE>   But an issue the missionary raised during his exchanges with
youngsters at Kinoole Baptist Church--whether their families kept a
butsudan (Buddhist altar) and his unequivocal stance that such
symbols of idolatry must be destroyed--troubled young Yagi.</TE>
<TE>   His grandfather kept a butsudan in the living room. He sat in
front of it every morning and prayed.</TE>
<TE>   The missionary's command to the boy that "You must tear it down as
Gideon did," reciting the Old Testament story of prophet Gideon,
touched him deeply. When he talks about it now, he explains it as
part of a concern in Asian and Asian American churches: In becoming a
Christian, does a convert sever ties with his non-Christian loved
ones, who will be banished to hell?</TE>
<TE>   "I'd rather go to hell and be with my family than go to heaven and
spend the rest of eternity with white people I don't even know" is a
familiar comment heard by Asian American pastors.</TE>
<TE>   How, the young Yagi wondered, could he possibly tear down his
grandfather's beloved altar and still remain his grandson? As far
back as he could remember, his grandfather, Seiryu Yagi, who had
immigrated to Hawaii in 1907 from Okinawa, Japan, to escape poverty,
would sit cross-legged in front of the altar at the crack of dawn to
pray, the fragrant scent of incense and the tinkle of prayer bells
signaling the household that the patriarch of the clan was at
intercessory prayers for four generations of Yagis in Okinawa,
Hawaii, California, Brazil and Peru.</TE>
<TE>   Images of Buddha as 'Evil and Demonic'</TE>
<TE>   Like the missionary he encountered in his childhood, Yagi said,
too many well-intentioned Christian workers from the West see the
images of Buddha as "something evil and demonic." Yet even Christians
growing up in Japan would understand the kindness and compassion each
of the many Buddhas and bodhisattvas represent, Yagi said. Jizo is
synonymous with compassion, as he leads dying children to heaven, and
Kannon is the epitome of maternal love.</TE>
<TE>   Yagi was in his 30s by the time his grandfather lay dying of
cancer in a Hilo hospital. The family summoned Yagi, who was in
Louisville, working on his doctorate at Southern Baptist Theological
Seminary, to hurry home.</TE>
<TE>   Calling him by his Japanese name, the grandfather asked: "Kazuo,
will you pray for the family?" Of course, the grandson said.</TE>
<TE>   The old man let out a sigh of relief, leaned back in his bed, and
was at peace, Yagi recalled. For years, the elder Yagi had been
deeply troubled by the fact that he could not count on any of his
American-born sons to promise to take care of the butsudan after he
died. But he remembered that he and his grandson had shared a "spirit
of prayer."</TE>
<TE>   The grandfather understood that the Buddhist prayers could not
continue after his death, and that his grandson's prayers would be
Christian. No matter. He was at peace, believing Buddha would
understand. Yagi is certain he will revisit his grandfather in his
eternal life.</TE>
<TE>   Religions are about transforming peoples' hearts, Yagi said. "When
I find kind people, to me, they are very precious to God," he said.
"The labels, such as Christian, Buddhist, Hindu, [are] secondary
because God sees the heart."</TE>

<HD>Car Makers See January Sales in U.S. Skid by 5.2%</HD>
<DH>Automotive: End of zero-percent financing, decrease in
fleet sales lead to slump for the Big Three. But some foreign
companies show gains.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM BROWN</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Auto makers on Friday reported a 5.2% drop overall in U.S. auto sales
for January, hit by a slump in demand from rental fleets and a
rollback on highly popular no-interest financing deals.</LD>
<LD>   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and the Chrysler arm of
DaimlerChrysler gained market share late last year as strong consumer
spending and interest-free financing on vehicles helped drive the
recession-hit U.S. economy unexpectedly into an expansion in the
final three months of 2001.</LD>
<LD>   But auto makers ended most of the no-interest deals in early
January, and that was reflected in a 12.7% dip in monthly sales at
GM, a 12.6% drop at Ford and a 9% fall at Chrysler.</LD>
<TE>   Those declines--which do not include U.S. sales of foreign brands
owned by Detroit auto makers--came despite a January rise in U.S.
consumer sentiment for a fourth straight month to its highest level
in a year.</TE>
<TE>   GM, the biggest auto maker, said it sold 43,000 fewer vehicles
than in January 2001. Nearly 40,000 of the vehicles in that loss came
from a sales drop to bankrupt rental car company ANC Rental Corp.,
which runs the National and Alamo rental car chains. GM said its
total retail sales were flat and its truck sales were up 10%.</TE>
<TE>   No. 2 auto maker Ford also said declines in fleet sales hurt its
results, but it saw weakness in the retail market as well.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. light-vehicle sales totaled 17.2 million units in 2001. That
was the second-highest yearly total in the country's automotive
history despite the recession and economic fallout from the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   January sales ran at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 15.8
million units. That defied gloomy predictions late last year--when
some industry analysts said January sales could slow to an annual
rate of under 15 million units--but was slightly below more recent
estimates of 16 million.</TE>
<TE>   And U.S. auto makers acknowledged that even without zero-percent
financing, sales were artificially propped up by aggressive price
cuts that erode their profitability.</TE>
<TE>   All of Detroit's auto companies have been hurt by the recession,
quality problems, overcapacity and tough competition from Asian and
European rivals.</TE>
<TE>   But Ford, the world's No. 2 auto maker, has been hardest hit in
the last year. A turnaround plan, which the company unveiled Jan. 11,
will close up to seven North American plants and cut 35,000 jobs
worldwide, or about 10% of the company's work force.</TE>
<TE>   There was a bit of good news in Ford's sales results Friday. Its
Jaguar brand said U.S. sales in January rose 87.5%, while its Land
Rover brand saw sales jump 133%, fueled in part by consumer demand
for its all-new Freelander compact sport-utility vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Luxury car maker Mercedes-Benz, a German unit of German-American
DaimlerChrysler, also performed strongly, registering a 19% gain in
January sales.</TE>
<TE>   Japan's top auto maker, Toyota Motor Co., said its sales rose 7.1%
for the month. Japan's third-ranked auto maker, Nissan Motor Co.,
said its sales rose 9.6% in January, thanks to its fast-selling new
Altima mid-sized sedan, while No. 2 Honda Motor Co. reported that
sales for the month were flat against strong results last year.</TE>
<TE>   Other foreign brands that fared well in January included South
Korean powerhouse Hyundai Motor Co., which saw U.S. sales rise 22%,
and its Kia Motors Corp. affiliate, which reported a 32% increase in
sales.</TE>

<HD>Flight Attendants Union Defeated at Delta</HD>
<DH>Labor:  Organizers call for new election, claiming the
airline interfered with the vote. Mediation board will probe
allegations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A five-year campaign to unionize flight attendants at Delta Air Lines
Inc. ended in defeat after a ballot count Friday. But organizers
demanded a new election, claiming the company illegally interfered
with the vote.</LD>
<LD>   The National Mediation Board, which monitored the campaign, will
investigate the allegations, board spokesman Daniel Rainey said.
Pre-election complaints by the union were found to have some merit,
but a full investigation was postponed until after the vote count, he
said.</LD>
<LD>   Of Delta's 19,033 flight attendants, 5,520 voted to be represented
by the Assn. of Flight Attendants. Votes were cast by 5,609. Ballots
that were not returned were counted as "no" votes.</LD>
<TE>   Delta spokesman Anthony Black said he expected the results to be
upheld and said the union's accusations "are completely without
merit," but he declined to address specific allegations.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Delta Chairman and Chief Executive Leo F. Mullin
said the nation's third-largest air carrier "deeply appreciates the
confidence implicit in these election results, which reaffirm the
strong relationship between our company and our employees."</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta-based Delta, the nation's third-largest carrier, is one of
the least unionized of the major U.S. airlines.</TE>
<TE>   Lorraine York, a Delta flight attendant based in Los Angeles who
supported the union, said posters in employee lounges across the
country urged attendants to "Give a Rip" by destroying their ballots,
she said. She said supervisors exploited job insecurities in the
industry after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and equated a pro-union
vote with disloyalty.</TE>
<TE>   Black rejected that complaint, but said flight attendants may have
appreciated the flexibility Delta had as a nonunion company in
dealing with post-Sept. 11 financial troubles in the industry. While
most major airlines announced massive layoffs in the weeks following
the terror attacks, he said, Delta offered voluntary leaves,
job-sharing and other alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   This week, the airline posted a fourth-quarter loss of $486
million, or $3.97 a diluted share, after excluding one-time items
such as the cash Delta received as its portion of the industry's
federal bailout. Delta, like most major carriers, posted a loss for
2001.</TE>
<TE>   Delta shares fell 29 cents to close at $31.31 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The union also claimed Delta wrongly told about 3,000 flight
attendants on unpaid leave that they were ineligible to vote. Union
spokeswoman Dawn Deeks said Delta spent about $2.5 million on
anti-union consultants.</TE>
<TE>   She said the union will ask the mediation board to order a new
election in which only mailed responses are counted.</TE>
<TE>   The Assn. of Flight Attendants, which represents 50,000 flight
attendants at 26 carriers, began funding an organizing drive at Delta
in the fall of 1997. Three years later, after gathering signatures
from more than half the flight attendants, the union petitioned for
an election with the mediation board.</TE>

<HD>Goodyear to Replace Tires on Large Vans</HD>
<DH>Autos: Firm says action is a response to warning about
rollover risk, concern over potential tread separations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. said Friday that it will replace some
200,000 heavy-duty tires on 15-passenger vans in the wake of a
federal investigation into accidents caused by the tires losing their
treads. At least 11 people died in the accidents.</LD>
<LD>   Goodyear maintains that the tires are safe, but said it will
replace them because of the National Highway Traffic and Safety
Administration's warning that the vans have a higher risk of rolling
over when fully loaded than do smaller vehicles.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a proactive, voluntary replacement program, done out of
concern for the NHTSA advisory on 15-passenger vans and the potential
for tread separations," said Goodyear spokesman Chuck Sinclair. "It
has not been determined that there is a higher incidence of tread
separations" with the tires, known as Load Range E tires, Sinclair
said.</LD>
<TE>   NHTSA issued a consumer advisory in April about 15-passenger vans,
"alerting [drivers] to the fact that these vehicles have a much
higher likelihood of rollover when loaded with passengers," agency
spokesman Rae Tyson said.</TE>
<TE>   "We found people were not aware of the different handling
characteristics," Tyson said.</TE>
<TE>   The Times reported in October 2000 that a number of fatal
accidents involved Goodyear Load Range E tires that had lost their
treads  and that Goodyear was not taking action on the tires.</TE>
<TE>   The next day Goodyear informed NHTSA of the tires' involvement in
the crashes, and the agency opened a defect investigation into Load
Range E tires the following month.</TE>
<TE>   Goodyear's move Friday was the latest in a series of steps taken
by manufacturers to address tire failures that made headlines  after
the extensive recall and replacement of Firestone tires in the last
year and a half.</TE>
<TE>   Load Range E tires were involved in 133 crashes of the large vans,
which resulted in 11 known deaths and 133 injuries, Goodyear's
Sinclair said. The vans often carry school groups, such as athletic
and debate teams.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, NHTSA has tallied 18 fatalities and 158 injuries in 86
crashes involving Load Range E tires in all vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   But Sinclair said analysis of a number of tires that failed showed
"the tread separations were caused by something external to the
tire," such as under-inflation, overloading, damage from impacts or
water seeping through punctures and rusting the steel belts.</TE>
<TE>   With Goodyear's decision to replace the tires, NHTSA will drop its
defect investigation, Tyson said.</TE>
<TE>   It is common for manufacturers to agree to replace products under
investigation before a formal "finding of defect" is reached, which
would probably result in a mandatory recall.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-one lawsuits have been filed against Goodyear relating to
Load Range E tread separations, 12 of them involving 15-passenger
vans, Sinclair said. Some were settled out of court, others resolved
in court and some are pending, but Sinclair said he didn't have a
breakdown.</TE>
<TE>   Akron, Ohio-based Goodyear has produced more than 28 million Load
Range E tires since the early 1990s. They are used on large passenger
and cargo vans, ambulances, large pickup trucks, trailers and shuttle
buses used by hotels and car rental agencies.</TE>
<TE>   The replacement program  covers  16-inch Load Range E tires
produced from 1996 to 2000, Sinclair said.</TE>
<TE>   Tires made in 2001 were not included because a design change that
added two layers of nylon capping to the tires was complete by then.</TE>
<TE>   Goodyear will contact registered owners of such vans, produced by
General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler, to replace
the tires at Goodyear's expense.</TE>
<TE>   The move is similar to but on a much smaller scale than Bridge
stone/Firestone Inc.'s decision in August 2000 to replace 6.5 million
tires that showed a tendency to lose their treads at high speeds.</TE>
<TE>   Ford said in May 2001 that it would replace an additional 13
million Firestone tires on its vehicles that the auto maker said
showed a risk of losing their treads. The Firestone tires involved
have been linked to at least 271 deaths.</TE>

<HD>Indexes Drop as Stocks End Their Two-Day Rally</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Technology issues take a hit as a new
employment report fails to lift the market. Yields fall on concerns
about the economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street retreated Friday as investors collected their wins from a
two-day rally, but the selling was subdued and focused on the
technology sector.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 12.74 points, or
0.1%, at 9,907.26. The losses were more significant for the
technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index, which fell 22.79 points,
or 1.2%, to 1,911.24. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index dropped 8
points, or 0.7%, to 1,122.20. Losers led winners by 9 to 8 on the New
York Stock Exchange and by 4 to 3 on Nasdaq in moderate trading.</LD>
<LD>   For the week, the indexes were mixed. The Dow rose 0.7%, Nasdaq
fell 1.4% and the S&amp;P lost nearly 1%.</LD>
<TE>   Friday's decline followed a dramatic advance Wednesday and
Thursday as the market, rebounding from an earlier sell-off, reacted
to bargain hunting and an upbeat forecast from the Federal Reserve.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be 'Buy the dips and hold' in the technology sector.
Now it is 'Buy the dips and sell on strength,'" said Charles White,
portfolio manager at Avatar Associates.</TE>
<TE>   Sun Microsystems slipped 39 cents to $10.37 on concerns about the
competitiveness of its products. Intel dropped 37 cents to $34.67,
falling back from gains Thursday prompted by a Merrill Lynch upgrade
of the stock. Microsoft lost $1.05 to $62.66.</TE>
<TE>   Financial stocks also were weak. American Express tumbled 75 cents
to $35.10, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter fell $1.59 to $53.41 and J.P.
Morgan Chase dropped $1.89 to $32.16.</TE>
<TE>   But Disney rose $1.39 to $22.45, after reporting
stronger-than-expected quarterly results and announcing it will no
longer buy consulting and auditing services from a single company.</TE>
<TE>   A new batch of satisfactory but unimpressive economic data failed
to create much excitement.</TE>
<TE>   The Labor Department reported the nation's unemployment rate
unexpectedly dropped to 5.6% in January, the lowest level since
before the terrorist attacks. But analysts cautioned that the change
occurred not because employment rose but because 924,000 job seekers
stopped looking for work.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, reports on January business activity from the Institute
for Supply Management and consumer sentiment from the University of
Michigan showed improvement, but were below expectations.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Treasury bond yields fell on fears the economy may not rebound
as quickly as some had hoped. The yield on the benchmark 10-year
Treasury note fell to 4.98%, from Thursday's close of 5.03%.</TE>
<TE>   * Waste Management fell $3.69 to $25.13 after it trimmed
fourth-quarter profit estimates.</TE>
<TE>   * TMP Worldwide dropped $4.36 to $38.21 after Forbes magazine
reported that the owner of the Monster.com Web site skimmed over
mergers-and-acquisitions expenses to make financial results look
better. The firm demanded a correction, calling the reporting
"inaccurate and irresponsible."</TE>
<TE>   * Amgen gained $2.38 to $57.78. The biotech company's new Neulasta
drug will be used during chemotherapy to prevent a drop in
infection-fighting white blood cells. Amgen said its older form of
the therapy, called Neupogen, had sales of $1.3 billion last year.</TE>

<HD>Venture Fund-Raising Down 5% in Quarter</HD>
<DH>Investments: With $48.2 billion raised in 2001, a survey
suggests that such funds may be on the rebound.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors committed $9 billion to venture capital funds in the fourth
quarter, a 5% fall from the third quarter but a level that suggests
fund-raising could rebound after plunging last year, according to a
survey released Friday.</LD>
<LD>   For all 2001, venture firms raised $48.2 billion, a 46.5% drop
from $90.1 billion raised during a record 2000, according to research
firm VentureOne Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Fund-raising tumbled last year as investors backed away from risky
privately held companies as the Internet boom driven by start-ups
went bust.</LD>
<TE>   Investors also retreated as markets for mergers, acquisitions and
initial public offerings, each needed for returns on early stakes in
start-ups, went sour with the broad stock market.</TE>
<TE>   The outlook for those markets remains wobbly and may further
restrain investors from committing money to venture funds, said
Curtis Feeny of Voyager Capital.</TE>
<TE>   "There just are not enough exits," Feeny said.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth quarter's 5% drop in fund-raising, however, was the
smallest fall between quarters last year and suggests venture
fund-raising is stabilizing, according to VentureOne.</TE>
<TE>   The firm also noted that the $48.2 billion raised last year was
only 5% below the $50.5 billion raised in 1999 ahead of the hey-day
of venture investing in Internet start-ups.</TE>

<HD>Lear to Cut Jobs, Shut Factories to Reduce Costs</HD>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lear Corp., the largest maker of automotive interiors, said Friday
that it would eliminate 6,500 jobs and close 21 factories and offices
to reduce costs as auto makers in North America build fewer cars and
trucks.</LD>
<LD>   The company will close most of the facilities and eliminate the
majority of the jobs this year, Lear Vice Chairman Jim Vandenberghe
said. The job cuts represent about 6% of the Southfield, Mich.-based
company's 110,000 employees.</LD>
<LD>   Lear said it had a fourth-quarter loss of $48.8 million on
expenses of $110.2 million for closing factories and cutting jobs.</LD>
<TE>   The parts supplier is cutting back as it expects North American
production of cars and light trucks this year to be no more than last
year's 15.5 million vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Lear shares fell 17 cents to close at $39.99 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>MetLife Inc., whose advertisements ask, "Have you met life today?"
won't block AT&amp;T Wireless Services Inc. from airing its new "mlife"
commercial during Sunday's Super Bowl, even though the insurer will
press ahead with a trademark suit against the telecommunications
firm.</LD>
<LD>   MetLife, the biggest U.S. life insurer, filed a lawsuit asking a
federal judge to block AT&amp;T from continuing to use the "mlife"
campaign, including the Super Bowl ad.</LD>
<LD>   After an hour of negotiations at federal court in Manhattan,
MetLife agreed that AT&amp;T could air the ads Sunday, AT&amp;T said it would
withdraw a trademark application, and the two sides said they would
meet next week. MetLife's suit is still pending.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a good outcome. We're delighted to be moving forward with
our campaign," said Mark Siegel, spokesman for AT&amp;T Wireless.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T Wireless has been airing the ads for "mlife" on television,
in print and at some airports, in anticipation of its formal
introduction during the Super Bowl. Redmond, Wash.-based AT&amp;T
Wireless is trying to create a new identity with consumers after
being spun off from AT&amp;T Corp. in July.</TE>
<TE>   MetLife spokesman Kevin Foley could not be reached for comment on
why the insurance company withdrew the bid to stop the Super Bowl ad.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bayer Corp. sued Chiron Corp., alleging the California biotechnology
company hid equipment, patent and regulatory problems in a diagnostic
unit that Bayer bought for more than $1 billion.</LD>
<LD>   In a lawsuit filed in federal court in Delaware, Bayer said it
bought all the shares of Chiron Diagnostics in November 1998.
Chiron's products include rapid blood-testing equipment used in
emergency rooms and intensive-care units.</LD>
<LD>   Bayer said Emeryville, Calif.-based Chiron's Rapidpoint 400 blood
analyzer, introduced just before the acquisition, was giving false
readings, hadn't been properly tested and didn't meet Food and Drug
Administration standards.</LD>
<TE>   Chiron officials said they had not seen the lawsuit and could not
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Chiron fell 11 cents to $42.26 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>CalPERS Doubted Enron Partnership</HD>
<DH>Probe: When the pension fund was offered a chance to invest
in 1999, its officials spotted a conflict of interest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>California pension officials raised concerns about Enron Corp.'s
off-the-books partnerships more than two years ago, long before the
deals came under investigative scrutiny, records and interviews show.</LD>
<LD>   The California Public Employees' Retirement System, or CalPERS,
had invested since 1993 in the partnerships, which Enron used to move
debt and liabilities off its books to boost its credit rating and
bottom line.</LD>
<LD>   In 1999, former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow
offered the pension fund a chance to invest in a new Enron
partnership, LJM2 Co-Investment. CalPERS officials immediately
spotted a problem: Fastow would be wearing two hats, acting as
general partner of LJM2 while continuing to hold his position as
chief financial officer of Enron.</LD>
<TE>   With a shot at partnership profit that could dwarf his hefty Enron
paycheck, Fastow would have an obvious conflict of interest, CalPERS
officials told him. In transactions between Enron and LJM2, Fastow
might be tempted to favor the partnership.</TE>
<TE>   According to people familiar with the deal, the arrangement was
rejected by CalPERS officials led by Sheryl Pressler, the fund's
chief investment officer, and Barry Gonder, the head of its
fast-growing alternative-investments program.</TE>
<TE>   Both have since left CalPERS for private-sector investment firms
and could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   CalPERS at the time already had a profitable six-year relationship
with Enron, the Houston-based kingpin of energy trading.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, it invested $250 million to become a 50-50 partner with
Enron in a natural-gas venture called Joint Energy Development
Investments, or Jedi, like the intergalactic knights from "Star
Wars."</TE>
<TE>   That deal had produced a $132.5-million gain for CalPERS in four
years, and a successor partnership, Jedi 2, seemed on its way to
making another killing in the oil and gas markets.</TE>
<TE>   But LJM2 was something different. In the earlier deals, Enron
executives didn't have any "personal economics," as CalPERS
spokeswoman Patricia K. Macht put it in recent interviews. The
company itself was the investor and reaped the profit.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Fastow would earn more than $30 million in management
fees and investment gains from his unusual partnership roles with
LJM2 and its smaller predecessor, LJM Cayman.</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission, congressional panels and
an internal committee at Enron all are investigating whether similar
arrangements involving Enron executives might have tainted more of
Enron's 3,000-plus partnerships and affiliates.</TE>
<TE>   The size of Fastow's gains came to light only on Nov. 8, in a
filing with the SEC in which Enron restated five years' worth of
financial results and slashed its previously reported profit by $586
million, citing improper accounting in its partnership deals.</TE>
<TE>   It was one of the most explosive revelations during Enron's slide
toward America's biggest corporate bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow, 40, was forced out of his job in October and now is
considered by congressional investigators to have played a key role
in developing ways for Enron to hide the massive losses and debt
associated with its soured investments in areas including water and
broadband communications fiber.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow has declined to comment, but spokesman Gordon Andrew said
that the limited-partnership structures were above board and that the
credit-rating agencies fully understood that their purpose was to
keep debt off Enron's balance sheet.</TE>
<TE>   As for the questionable accounting treatment that the partnerships
received, "Mr. Fastow was not responsible for accounting at Enron,"
Andrew said Friday. "He never even took an accounting course."</TE>
<TE>   Andrew acknowledged that much of the public blame for the scandal
is falling on Fastow, "and there's probably more on the way."</TE>
<TE>   That's today. But in the fall of 1999, Fastow was on a roll. While
he made his sales pitch to CalPERS, newsstands were displaying the
October issue of CFO Magazine, touting the young financier as winner
of the 1999 CFO Excellence Award for Capital Structure Management.</TE>
<TE>   In a rare interview with CFO, Fastow boasted that he had used the
partnerships to keep nearly $1 billion of debt off Enron's balance
sheet. That, he said, was the key to maintaining the firm's
triple-B-plus credit rating, which in turn was crucial for Enron's
core energy-trading business.</TE>
<TE>   More than bad publicity or the SEC investigation launched in
October, it was ratings downgrades by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's
Investors Service that caused Enron's trading partners to stop
extending it credit, sparking a kind of "run on the bank" that
ultimately triggered its Dec. 2 bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   None of that could be foreseen by any of the participants in that
1999 meeting. Pressler and Gonder declined Fastow's offer, but they
hardly slammed the door.</TE>
<TE>   Just three months later, CalPERS was saying yes to another Enron
proposal, this one a $15-million investment in a start-up called New
Power Co., whose goal was to take advantage of the national
deregulation wave by selling electricity directly to consumers and
small businesses over the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   In that case, however, CalPERS saw no conflicts because New Power
was an actual subsidiary, with no shared responsibilities for
management.</TE>
<TE>   CalPERS ponied up an additional $25 million in a second round of
financing for New Power the following July. Along with other early
investors, CalPERS received stock and warrants in New Power when the
company had an initial public offering in October 2000.</TE>
<TE>   CalPERS officials could not quantify the fund's losses on its
7million shares and warrants. However, the loss appears considerable.
The initial public offering price was $21 a share. Since then,
blaming problems with regulators, falling natural-gas prices and
other factors, the company has reported nothing but losses, and the
stock has plunged to less than $1.</TE>
<TE>   CalPERS manages the retirement funds of 1.2 million
Californians--state, school and local public agency employees and
their families. As of October, nearly 370,000 retirees and other
beneficiaries were receiving monthly checks from the fund.</TE>
<TE>   For CalPERS, the Enron deals were part of an ambitious push into
the rock 'n' roll side of investing: high-risk, high-reward
private-equity deals available only to big institutional investors
and super-wealthy individuals.</TE>
<TE>   The far bigger but blander side of CalPERS is its portfolio of
publicly traded stocks, bonds and real estate, worth $139 billion as
of Oct.31. The private-equity assets were worth $7.5 billion, or 5%
of the total.</TE>
<TE>   CalPERS doesn't employ analysts to pick its regular stocks. It
decided years ago that it could perform just as well and save
millions of dollars in fees by turning itself into an index fund,
buying stocks to mirror the proportions of the Wilshire 2,500 index,
a barometer of the 2,500 largest public companies.</TE>
<TE>   That's why CalPERS today holds 2.7 million nearly worthless shares
of Enron common stock, not to mention large stakes in Global Crossing
Ltd. and Kmart Corp., both of which filed for bankruptcy in January.
CalPERS held on through the bad news of last fall and swallowed a
$40-million loss on Enron because, as a matter of policy, it doesn't
buy or sell on news events. If Enron is in the Wilshire 2,500, it's
in the CalPERS fund.</TE>
<TE>   "That's our discipline," spokeswoman Macht said.</TE>
<TE>   But the private-equity fund, now known as the Alternative
Investment Management, or Aim, program, scrutinizes its deals to the
nth degree, Macht said.</TE>
<TE>   "Some partners don't want to work with us because we're too slow,
and we deliberate about everything," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Jedi 1 was CalPERS' first big private-equity venture, and the fund
remained cautious even as the partnership exceeded expectations,
generating annual returns of more than 22% over four years--far
higher than CalPERS' overall investment return in those years. In
1997, when Enron came back with a proposal to launch Jedi 2, a
bigger, more diversified partnership, CalPERS agreed but insisted on
first selling Jedi 1.</TE>
<TE>   It was that decision by CalPERS that inadvertently triggered some
financial machinations by Enron that it would have to reverse four
years later in its humiliating earnings restatement.</TE>
<TE>   To buy out CalPERS' stake for $382.5 million, Enron created
another partnership, Chewco Investments. Ultimately, an internal
investigation by Enron disclosed that Chewco's investors lacked
sufficient independence from Enron for the transaction to be kept off
the Enron balance sheet.</TE>
<TE>   In a domino effect, Chewco's disqualification disqualified Jedi 1,
and both entities, losses and debts together, had to be bought back
onto Enron's books.</TE>
<TE>   Not all investors were put off by LJM2, however. According to
court filings, the partnership's big-name investors included
Citicorp, Primerica Life Insurance Co., Travelers Insurance Co. and
Leon Levy, the Wall Street legend who founded investment firm Odyssey
Partners.</TE>
<TE>   These investors were given Enron's assurance that the deal--and
specifically Fastow's dual role--had received the blessing of outside
legal counsel and of Enron's blue-chip board of directors, including
luminaries such as Wendy Lee Gramm, former head of the federal
Commodity Futures Trading Commission and wife of Sen. Phil Gramm
(R-Texas).</TE>
<TE>   None of that was enough to satisfy CalPERS, which long has been
one of the loudest advocates for good corporate behavior. CalPERS
lends its name, and the muscle of the voting shares it can wield in a
proxy fight, to campaigns to assure the independence of corporate
boards and auditors.</TE>
<TE>   CalPERS, for example, backed former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt's
unsuccessful attempt to bar accounting firms from doing certain kinds
of consulting work for the companies whose books they audit.</TE>
<TE>   Critics in Congress have said the Andersen accounting firm,
Enron's chief auditor, may have relaxed its standards because of the
$1 million a week in fees it was earning from Enron, more than half
of it for consulting work--a charge Andersen has denied.</TE>
<TE>   CalPERS' Macht contends that the fund saw nothing amiss in its
earlier dealings with Enron and, although it was concerned over the
way LJM2 was set up, it had no way of knowing its ultimate effect on
the company.</TE>
<TE>   For years, the fund's practice has been to examine the
worst-performing stocks in its portfolio and investigate whether
improprieties at the board level or sloppy accounting might have
contributed to the bad results. Only then has CalPERS singled out
such a company for criticism, Macht said.</TE>
<TE>   Enron in the late 1990s was such a solid performer in terms of
stock gains that a slip-up such as LJM2 wouldn't have brought the
company in for extra scrutiny, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We did what made sense for our investment program: We passed on
the investment and told Enron why," Mark Anson, CalPERS chief
investment officer, said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the Enron experience has caused CalPERS to do some
soul searching. The fund is reexamining its policies and considering
whether, for example, it might extend its corporate evaluations to
more than just the poorest performers.</TE>
<TE>   Securities experts are inclined to cut CalPERS some slack for not
publicly voicing its concerns with LJM2. "I would not think that any
investor has an obligation to speak out on such an issue, certainly
not a legal obligation," said David S. Ruder, a securities law
professor at Northwestern University and former SEC chairman.</TE>

<HD>Region's Gas Price Hikes Expected to Slow</HD>
<DH>Fuel: Ample West Coast supplies should help keep the
average per-gallon cost well below $2, analysts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART SILVERSTEIN and LAURA LOH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The surge in average gasoline prices around Southern
California--nearly 30 cents a gallon in January--isn't over yet,
analysts said Friday. But they predicted that increases would
moderate soon, holding costs at the pump well below the $2 level that
alarmed consumers last spring.</LD>
<LD>   The run-up in prices since the beginning of the year--when average
prices in Los Angeles County were the lowest in years, at 98 cents a
gallon--is expected to slow largely because gasoline inventories on
the West Coast are ample.</LD>
<LD>   Still, analysts say, more increases are coming due to the annual
switch this time of year from winter-grade to summer-grade gasolines,
which are more expensive to produce. In addition, they said, gas
station owners are eager to boost prices to reverse a recent trend of
squeezed profit margins.</LD>
<TE>   "I think you'll see prices continue to march up, maybe a dime to
15 cents over the next four to six weeks," said Fred Rozell, retail
pricing director for the Oil Price Information Service, a Lakewood,
N.J.-based firm.</TE>
<TE>   Rozell's firm reported Friday that prices climbed to an average of
just more than $1.26 for a gallon of self-serve regular gasoline in
Los Angeles County. That was up 4.5 cents from a week earlier but
down nearly 23 cents from a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Gasoline prices also rose to $1.26 in Orange County and were
several cents higher in the Inland Empire and San Diego and Ventura
counties.</TE>
<TE>   In early 2001, gas prices were on an upward spiral that took the
price at the pump to a record $2.04 in May in L.A. County before
tumbling over the next seven months to the lowest price in years.</TE>
<TE>   The price gyrations reflect the increasing volatility of the
national and state gasoline markets. The wide swings, some consumer
activists contend, stem from price manipulation by the handful of big
companies that increasingly dominate the refining and marketing of
gasoline, particularly in states such as California.</TE>
<TE>   "When these guys get this big, there's very little control over
them," said Jamie Court, executive director of the Foundation for
Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, a nonprofit watchdog group in Santa
Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Most analysts and industry officials attribute the price
fluctuations to free-market forces. They cite the dwindling number of
refiners and marketers but also government environmental standards
requiring varying blends of gasoline for different regions of the
country and intensified financial speculation by traders in the
energy market.</TE>
<TE>   Also, they say, the increasing efforts of oil companies to cut
costs by keeping inventories comparatively low lead to price spikes
when production is disrupted by refinery fires or other problems.</TE>
<TE>   Although oil prices in international markets jumped Friday, they
are down one-third from a year ago. Gasoline prices nationally have
been relatively stable over the last month, hovering around $1.12 a
gallon in recent days.</TE>
<TE>   The California attorney general's office has investigated the
possibility of gasoline price fixing since 1999, but no charges have
been filed. At the national and state levels, "there have been a
number of investigations over the years ... but no one has ever
proved anything," said Herschel T. Elkins, the office's consumer
chief.</TE>
<TE>   California has long had its own smog-fighting specifications for
gasoline, so its gasoline prices traditionally have been particularly
volatile. In the state, "prices whip around, not necessarily in
connection with national trends," said Joseph Tovey, a New York
investment banker specializing in the energy industry.</TE>
<TE>   That, analysts say, makes predicting price trends in California
hazardous. "We think any price swing upward will be moderate--barring
any refinery outages," said Jeffrey Spring, a spokesman for the
Automobile Club of Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see $2-a-gallon gasoline happening this year, unless
something major occurs," Spring said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said refinery maintenance work that curbed gasoline
production on the West Coast in recent weeks contributed to January's
increase in prices, but they added that the work should be complete
soon. What's more, few analysts expect a big jump in the price of
crude oil in coming months, given the weak demand for energy in the
global recession.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the likelihood appears slim that rising gasoline
prices could substantially hinder the local economy's recovery from
the current slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly looks to me like the increase we've had in gasoline
prices in January is pretty mild," said Tom Lieser, a UCLA economist
specializing in California issues. "In historical terms, it's still a
fairly moderate range for gasoline prices. I don't like to see them
going up again, but I think it's a matter of degree."</TE>
<TE>   Still, some consumers who had gotten accustomed to the lower
gasoline prices said they were dismayed by the recent increases.
Maribel Ponce, who filled up her SUV at an East Los Angeles Mobil
station selling regular unleaded for $1.19 a gallon, said she has cut
back on socializing to drive less.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing I do now is go to school and work," said Ponce,
20, a UCLA student.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Johnson, 58, said the increase in gasoline prices is hitting
him hard because he has a 100-mile daily commute between his home in
Riverside and his city job in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I still have to come to work every day," he said while filling up
his white Mustang. To save money, Johnson said, he's taking fewer
trips with his mobile home.</TE>

said that the days of prices below $1 seemed too good to be true.
"That was wonderful," said Arseneault, who works as a building

more normal.</TE>

<HD>Jobs Report Adds to Hope of Recovery</HD>
<DH>Economy: Decline in unemployment rate for January suggests
that the worst of the recession may be over.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The U.S. economy offered tantalizing new hints Friday it may be
recovering faster than expected as the government reported that the
January unemployment rate slipped to 5.6% and that employers shed
jobs at the slowest pace in five months.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, an industry report showed the nation's battered
manufacturing sector expanded production and collected new orders for
a second straight month, breaking almost a year-and-a-half-long
string of setbacks.</LD>
<LD>   But no one, including notoriously optimistic investors, was
breaking out the champagne over the latest reports. That's because
the jobless decline was accompanied by an inexplicably large plunge
in the size of America's labor force, and by figures showing a
near-record number of jobless workers have run out of unemployment
benefits.</LD>
<TE>   "I wouldn't trumpet this as evidence the recovery is here,"
Timothy J. Bartik, senior economist with the nonpartisan Upjohn
Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo, Mich., said of the
new jobs figures.</TE>
<TE>   The stock market certainly didn't do much trumpeting. Worried
other Enron-like accounting scandals may lurk in the wings, investors
treated the new employment report as if it showed the recovery would
be slower, not faster, in coming, and pushed stock prices down.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite index dropped 22.79 points, or 1.2%, to
1,911.24. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index fell 8 points, or 0.7%, to
1,122.20, while the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 12.74
points, or 0.1%, to 9,907.26.</TE>
<TE>   Unemployment fell from 5.8% in December to 5.6%, the Labor
Department said. The decline was the first since May and confounded
forecasters who had predicted the rate would rise to 5.9%. Employers
cut payrolls by 89,000 in January, according to the department,
considerably less than December's 130,000-job reduction. Virtually
all the job losses were in manufacturing and construction and were
partially offset by gains in services such as health care.</TE>
<TE>   Although substantially higher than the national average, jobless
rates among traditionally disadvantaged groups did not significantly
change during the month, according to department officials.
Unemployment among blacks fell from 10.2% in December to 9.8%. The
rate among Latinos rose from 7.9% to 8.1%.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest mystery of the day was what happened to the nation's
civilian labor force--the total of those working, plus those looking
for work. The labor force suddenly shrank in January by 924,000
people, the biggest decline since the government started keeping
records in 1948.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts split into two camps on the meaning of the drop.
Optimists wrote it off as a statistical fluke and the kind of thing
that often happens in December and January when employment rises,
then falls around the Christmas holiday season. Pessimists said it
showed the economy has deteriorated to such an extent hundreds of
thousands have given up hope of employment and stopped looking for
work.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't take the number too seriously, but the direction of
[the] trend may be correct," said Joel L. Naroff, a Holland, Pa.,
economist.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said one piece of evidence suggesting the trend is more
than a fluke is a sharp drop both in the number of women working and
the number counted as unemployed.</TE>
<TE>   The employment total for adult women dropped by 103,000 in January
while the unemployment total fell by more than 320,000, according to
department statistics. The combination suggests that women are
leaving the labor force in droves, said Lawrence Mishel, vice
president of the Economic Policy Institute in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   If the trend is underway, then although the unemployment rate has
not reached high levels by historical standards, joblessness is still
taking a nasty toll by leaving those who lose their jobs out of work
for inordinate periods.</TE>
<TE>   Other Labor Department figures show that the average amount of
time that someone remains jobless is growing, leaving many workers
without unemployment benefits.</TE>
<TE>   A new analysis of department data by the liberal Center on Budget
and Policy Priorities shows that 300,000 workers exhausted their
regular 26 weeks of state-provided jobless benefits in December, a
75% increase over the previous December, and the largest number to
run out of benefits in any December since 1973.</TE>
<TE>   (Center analysts said that because benefit exhaustion data is not
seasonally adjusted, statistics from one period can only be compared
with those of the same period in previous years.) During the last
three months of last year, 860,000 jobless workers ran out of
benefits, a 70% increase from the previous year, according to the
center analysis. About 132,000 of them were in California, the
analysis showed.</TE>
<TE>   In most previous recessions, exhausting state-provided benefits
was of little consequence because Washington almost always helped
finance extended benefit programs. But the rules for the current such
program are so rigid that workers in only two states, Oregon and
Washington, now qualify, and without legal changes few others are
expected to join them.</TE>
<TE>   "Congress needs to get off its duff and pass an extension," said
Wendell E. Primus, the center's director of income security.</TE>
<TE>   Although the new industry report on factory production and orders
suggested the slump in American manufacturing may be close to over,
the Labor Department said that factory employment dropped 89,000 last
month, its 18th straight decline. Most of the additional job losses
were in construction where employers shed 54,000 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The losses were partially offset by the addition of 62,000 jobs in
retailing, which usually lets workers go in the post-holiday period.</TE>
<TE>   Average hourly earnings of production and non-supervisory workers,
who make up about 80% of the nation's work force, remained steady at
$14.59, the first time they have not increased in a year. Average
weekly earnings declined $1.50.</TE>

<HD>Bush Unveils Proposal to Keep Pension Funds Safe</HD>
<DH>Reform: His plan aims to avoid troubles that befell Enron
stockholders. But critics say the president's measures are
inadequate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN, LIZ PULLIAM WESTON and JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Friday unveiled his plan to prevent future pension
fund meltdowns, prompting an immediate political and economic debate
about whether the changes would be enough to keep workers from losing
their life savings in future Enron Corp.-style debacles.</LD>
<LD>   Bush said his pension reform plan would grant workers the same
protections as a company's executives, but Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle (D-S.D.) immediately called the proposal inadequate--warning,
as did other critics, that it could instead increase the risks that
employees and shareholders face.</LD>
<LD>   Daschle said Democrats soon would offer a "much tougher and more
comprehensive" alternative, thus setting the stage for a
high-profile, election-year fight between the Democrat-controlled
Senate and the Republican White House.</LD>
<TE>   Bush's plan, which he detailed Friday at a West Virginia retreat
for GOP leaders, would allow employees to sell company stock in their
401(k) accounts after three years. It also would make companies more
liable for losses during so-called blackout, or lock-down,
periods--like the one that kept Enron employees from selling their
shares when the company's stock plummeted last fall.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, executives would be barred from selling their company
shares during lockdown periods, which are typically declared when a
firm changes pension plan administrators. Enron executives' sale of
company stock during its two-week lockdown has raised ire among
rank-and-file workers.</TE>
<TE>   "The plan will ensure that company executives be bound by the same
blackout restrictions they impose on their workers," Bush said. "If
it's OK for the sailor, it ought to be OK for the captain."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's plan would require that companies give a 30-day notice
before such lockdowns and provide more frequent reports about their
401(k) plans. Bush also wants to allow 401(k) plan providers to give
workers retirement advice.</TE>
<TE>   As details of Enron's collapse emerge, the White House has become
increasingly defensive about its ties to the energy company and the
public perception that the administration is too cozy with big
business. On Friday, Bush avoided referring to Enron by name but
resorted to populist rhetoric as he promoted his pension reform plan.</TE>
<TE>   "My plan will strengthen the workers' ability to manage their own
retirement funds by giving them more freedom to diversify, better
access to professional investment advice and quarterly information
about their investments," he said.</TE>
<TE>   About 42 million workers own 401(k) retirement accounts, with
$2trillion in total assets. The plans allow workers to put aside
money for retirement, tax-deferred, with employers often matching
employee contributions--sometimes in company stock.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the large corporations that match with stock also restrict
workers' ability to sell those shares, essentially forcing them to
remain invested in the company.</TE>
<TE>   A bill co-sponsored by Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) would permit
401(k) plans to have no more than 20% of assets invested in company
stock and would allow employees to sell after 90 days. A similar bill
by Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez) would allow sales after one year.</TE>
<TE>   "In the stock market, three years is a long time," said Miller,
who was sharply critical of Bush's proposal. "You're just trapping
these people in the same situation that Enron trapped them in."</TE>
<TE>   Critics also panned Bush's plan for 401(k) providers to give
investment advice. They said that approach could compound the risks
to workers and shareholders by allowing them to be steered into
investments in which their advisors may have a financial stake.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's one lesson we should have learned from Enron, it's
that conflict of interest matters," said Barbara Roper, head of
investor protection for the Consumer Federation of America.</TE>
<TE>   Though Bush's proposals would make it easier for workers to sell
company stock, some said more should be done to prevent employees
from voluntarily overloading their 401(k) accounts with company
shares. Many Enron employees voluntarily bought company stock for
their 401(k) accounts; companywide, the plan had 62% of its assets in
Enron stock, which is now virtually worthless.</TE>
<TE>   But Roper and others also found elements to praise in Bush's
plan--including the fact that the chief executive's support for
change makes it more likely that Congress will enact significant
reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Employer groups, meanwhile, applauded Bush for not advocating
limits on how much workers can invest in company shares.</TE>
<TE>   But they questioned whether some of the president's reforms could
result in higher fees or fewer choices for 401(k) plans. Companies
might decide against switching to a better plan because of concerns
about greater liability during lockdowns, said David Wray, head of
the Profit Sharing/401(k) Council of America.</TE>
<TE>   Companies also might scale back or discontinue their matching
contributions if employees were allowed to diversify more freely.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything that would inhibit a company's ability to provide a
401(k) match, or encourage them to forgo the match, is a big
mistake," said Mark Niziak, senior counsel at New York Life Benefit
Services, a provider of 401(k) and defined-benefit pension plans.</TE>

<HD>SEC Probes Global Crossing Allegations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal securities regulators  are looking into an ex-employee's
allegations that Global Crossing Ltd. used misleading accounting
techniques to enhance its revenue, according to the company and the
ex-employee's attorney.</LD>
<LD>   Officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission apparently
started their review this week after news that Roy Olofson, a former
finance executive at Global Crossing, warned the company's top
attorney about his concerns in a letter in August.</LD>
<LD>   The struggling telecommunications company filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection Monday. The Bermuda-based company, which has
executive offices in Beverly Hills, listed $12.3 billion in debt and
$22.4 billion in assets--making the company's bankruptcy filing the
nation's fifth-largest.</LD>
<TE>   Dan Cohrs, Global Crossing's chief financial officer, said Friday
that the company has been contacted by the SEC about Olofson's
letter. He characterized the inquiry as a "routine question" from the
commission, which regulates the U.S. securities market.</TE>
<TE>   "They have asked us to provide them with some information, and we
are cooperating with them," Cohrs said. He said the commission wanted
a copy of Olofson's letter.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Brian C. Lysaght, who is representing Olofson, said he
was contacted by the SEC on Wednesday. "It was clearly about Global
Crossing," he said. "But we've been playing phone tag."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly Bowers, the SEC's assistant regional director in Los
Angeles, would neither confirm nor deny that the agency had called
both parties.</TE>
<TE>   Olofson's Aug. 6 letter, obtained by the Los Angeles Times, noted
that he was "very disturbed" by Global Crossing's aggressive
accounting methods and urged the company's general counsel, James
Gorton, to investigate the matter. He asked Gorton not to involve
Cohrs or Olofson's boss, Joseph Perrone, who was the executive from
the Andersen accounting firm in charge of Global Crossing's account
until he joined the company last year.</TE>
<TE>   Gorton, who left Global Crossing shortly after receiving Olofson's
letter, said he circulated the letter among the company's top
managers and then hired an outside law firm, Simpson Thacher &amp;
Bartlett, to review the matter.</TE>
<TE>   "No one expressed any alarm about [the letter] at all," Gorton
said. "Global Crossing disclosed [the disputed contract accounting]
in their reports."</TE>
<TE>   Charles Cogut, Global Crossing's attorney at Simpson Thacher,
declined to comment Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Gorton said he left Global Crossing because his three-year
contract had expired and he wanted to move on--a decision he had
disclosed to other executives weeks before Olofson's letter arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing has said that the accounting practices Olofson
questioned are used throughout the telecommunications industry, and
that the company has carefully disclosed its methods.</TE>
<TE>   The accusations come amid the debacle enveloping Enron Corp., the
bankrupt Texas energy trader that received a letter from an Enron
executive who was worried that the company's accounting methods were
misleading.</TE>
<TE>   In U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York, where Global filed its
petition, telecommunications equipment maker Lucent Technologies Inc.
said Global Crossing owes it at least $123 million, significantly
more than the $31 million listed as the amount owed Lucent.</TE>
<TE>   Lucent, based in Murray Hill, N.J., asked the Bankruptcy Court to
force Global Crossing to accept or reject ongoing equipment and
network contracts with Lucent.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing, noting that Lucent is one of its largest and most
important suppliers, said it is working to resolve the matter.</TE>
<TE>   "Lucent has contracts with a variety of Global Crossing
[operations] around the world," said Global Crossing spokesman Dan
Coulter.</TE>
<TE>   "The difference in the amount ... arises from different
interpretations of those contracts."</TE>

<LD>Connecticut may sue Forstmann Little &amp; Co. to recover the state's
$96-million investment, used by the fourth-biggest U.S. buyout firm
for stakes in two money-losing telecommunications companies.</LD>
<LD>   State Treasurer Denise Nappier said she hired a law firm, Paul
Hastings Janofsky &amp; Walker, after Forstmann Little failed to respond
to the state pension plan's concern about the buyout company's more
than $2billion in investments in XO Communications Inc. and McLeodUSA
Inc., now valued at $1billion.</LD>
<LD>   Forstmann Little said that it worked to keep Connecticut officials
informed and that the McLeodUSA investment ultimately would be
beneficial for the state pension fund.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>WorldCom Inc. Chief Executive Bernard Ebbers may have to repay as
much as $183.7 million in loans backed by 11.3 million shares of the
company after the shares sank to a seven-year low this week.</LD>
<LD>   The loans from Bank of America and WorldCom, which Ebbers took out
to buy WorldCom stock, are due the business day after the company's
shares close at or below $10.</LD>
<LD>   The so-called margin debt amounted to $183.7 million as of March
30, the phone-and-data service provider said in a regulatory filing.</LD>
<TE>   WorldCom stock fell 44 cents, or 4.4%, to $9.61 in heavy trading
on Nasdaq. The shares fell below $10 on Wednesday, closing at $9.85,
as earnings reports from rivals disappointed investors. Analysts said
the shares also had been hurt by concern that Ebbers' shares would
flood the market.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no foreseeable circumstances that would require Mr.
Ebbers to sell his shares," said Brad Burns, spokesman for the
Clinton, Miss.-based company. He declined to comment on whether terms
mentioned in the March filing had been amended.</TE>

<HD>UAL Loss Biggest in Airline History</HD>
<DH>Aviation: United Airlines parent's $2.1-billion deficit for
2001 reflects the recession and drop in travel after Sept. 11.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>United Airlines parent UAL Corp. posted a massive fourth-quarter loss
that, although smaller than Wall Street expected, still left UAL with
a net loss of $2.1 billion for 2001--the worst showing in airline
history.</LD>
<LD>   As the last major carrier to post its results, UAL put an
exclamation point on the industry's disastrous 2001, when the
carriers were hit with an economic recession and the unprecedented
drop in air travel after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The major
airlines combined lost more than $7 billion last year.</LD>
<LD>   In the fourth quarter, UAL lost $640 million, or $11.74 a share,
after excluding one-time gains and charges, including its portion of
the federal bailout aid. That was considerably better than the
$14.96-a-share loss forecast by Wall Street, according to analysts
surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call.</LD>
<TE>   But United, the nation's second-largest carrier behind AMR Corp.'s
American, remains in deep trouble. Based in Elk Grove Township, Ill.,
United is a leading carrier for business passengers and thus is being
particularly hurt by the slump in business travel. The airline said
it expects another significant loss in the current quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Airline executives said that United is losing about $10 million a
day, but that it also has about $2.6 billion in cash. "We think we
have enough time to implement the recovery plan," said Frederic
Brace, UAL's chief financial officer.</TE>
<TE>   That plan includes trying to secure huge savings from United's
employees, who own a majority of UAL's stock and account for nearly
40% of United's costs. Brace said that the airline was seeking
several billion dollars in labor-cost reductions via negotiations
with the workers' unions, but that the effort is being slowed by
United's dispute with its mechanics.</TE>
<TE>   The 15,000 mechanics, represented by the International Assn. of
Machinists, will vote this month on a contract proposed by a
presidential board, which was appointed to block a mechanics strike
while it tries to broker a settlement. Its proposal carries sizable
pay hikes, and the mechanics have indicated they won't entertain any
concessions until the higher wage scales are in place.</TE>
<TE>   UAL President Rono Dutta, in a call with analysts Friday,
acknowledged that the dispute also is affecting the airline's
bookings. "Our labor uncertainty has caused some loss of traffic," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, United said that its overall passenger traffic has been
improving every quarter since Sept. 11 and that it plans to restore
127 flights in April. Immediately after the terrorist strikes, which
involved two of its jetliners, United slashed about 20% of its
operations to roughly 1,650 flights a day.</TE>
<TE>   But investors Friday found little to like in UAL's results. The
airline's stock tumbled $1.27 a share, or 8%, to $13.43 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   UAL's net loss in the fourth quarter, after including the
government aid and other one-time items, was $308 million, or $5.68 a
share, and its $2.1-billion net loss for the year equaled $40.04 a
share. UAL's annual revenue tumbled 17% to $16.1 billion from $19.4
billion.</TE>
<TE>   The prior record for an annual loss was in 1990, when Continental
Airlines lost $1.23 billion, according to New Haven, Conn.-based
consulting firm Back Aviation Solutions.Two other carriers broke that
record last year: US Airways lost $1.97 billion and AMR lost $1.8
billion.</TE>

<HD>Camarillo Charter School Will Dare to Be Different</HD>
<DH>Education: Campus, to be run by the new Cal State Channel
Islands, will encourage innovative techniques.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All students at this elementary school will be taught both English
and Spanish. Each class will be led by one of the best, most
experienced teachers in Ventura County, who will be encouraged to use
cutting-edge techniques.</LD>
<LD>   Is this public education?</LD>
<LD>   It will be at University Preparation School, a charter school set
to open in Camarillo this fall.</LD>
<TE>   The new Cal State Channel Islands will run the school as a kind of
public school laboratory. College students going through the
university's teaching credential program will get hands-on experience
under the guidance of veteran educators, who will use the program to
learn new ways of teaching. Aspiring school administrators will be
able to experience firsthand the rigors of the job.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, 500 local youngsters from kindergarten to fifth grade
will experience what proponents hope will be one of the county's most
enriching educational environments.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a wonderful opportunity for the students, and, as
importantly, for the teachers," said Howard Hamilton, superintendent
of the Pleasant Valley Elementary School District. "It should raise
the level of teaching quality throughout Ventura County."</TE>
<TE>   As a charter campus, University Preparation School will be funded
by the state on a per-student basis. The school will not have to
comply with California's rigid education code, but teachers will be
responsible for annual standardized testing.</TE>
<TE>   When it opens in the fall, the school will be housed in what is
now El Rancho Structured School in the Pleasant Valley Elementary
School District under a five-year agreement.</TE>
<TE>   About 250 students living in the neighborhood around El Rancho,
many of whom are learning English, will have the option of attending
the charter school. The other half of the enrollees will be recruited
from around the county.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the focus is on building a staff.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, a committee of Ventura County teachers, administrators
and university faculty members will interview four finalists for
principal.</TE>
<TE>   Then the hunt begins for teachers. The university is seeking
tenured teachers in Ventura County and nearby Las Virgenes Unified
School District. An ability to teach students from diverse
backgrounds and proficiency in a second language will be a plus.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the first students in the university's teaching credential
program--there will be about 140--will have a rare opportunity to
work with the county's "distilled expertise" in teaching, said
Barbara Thorpe, chief of academic planning for Cal State Channel
Islands.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a gift," she said. "It's an opportunity for our student
teachers to have a wonderful experience in a school that will have a
number of farsighted and unique aspects to it."</TE>

<HD>FasTrak, Big Mac No Longer a Combo</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>McDonald's customers with FasTrak tollway transponders can no longer
use them to pay for Big Macs and other meals at four Orange County
restaurants. The fast-food giant has ended the pilot program.</LD>
<LD>   In a memo to the Orange County Transportation Corridor Agencies,
which uses FasTrak, McDonald's said it ended the program Thursday at
restaurants in Costa Mesa, Laguna Niguel, Mission Viejo and Rancho
Santa Margarita.</LD>
<LD>   The company had extended the initial test period to February 2003,
but pulled the plug early. McDonald's representatives were
unavailable Friday to comment on the decision. Each side had a clause
in its contract allowing it to end the partnership with 60 days'
notice.</LD>
<TE>   "We were happy with the partnership," said Lisa Telles, a
spokeswoman for the transportation agency. " ... It added more value
to having a transponder in your car. The more places you could use
it, the more you'd want to use it. They certainly left open that they
may come back and talk to us, but there were no specific plans that
we were told about."</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's launched the pilot program in April 2000. The TCA
received 25 cents for each transaction. Telles said the TCA collected
about $56,000 during the test.</TE>
<TE>   If a McDonald's customer had a transponder and used the
drive-through lane, a device read the wallet-sized unit on the car
windshield, alerting the employee taking the order.</TE>
<TE>   Customers would then be asked if they wanted to pay using FasTrak.
Telles said FasTrak usage at the restaurants had steadily increased.
McDonald's total for the first month of the test was $36,000. In
December 2001, the latest period for which figures were available,
the total was $89,000.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why McDonald's ended it, except it was a test
program," Telles said.</TE>
<TE>   The TCA continues to explore other venues where the transponder
could be used, such as parking lots, Telles said. But the equipment
necessary to read the transponder is costly, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Telles said she was not sure what the fast-food company will do
with its hardware.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Chancellor Selection Called Best Choice, Sham</HD>
<DH>Education: New Orange County college chief had earlier
received two 'no-confidence' votes from faculty and was the fourth or
fifth choice of a selection committee.</DH>

<LD>Trustees of the South Orange County Community College District on
Friday appointed as chancellor a controversial college president who
has sued the district and who twice has received "no-confidence"
votes from faculty.</LD>
<LD>   The appointment of Raghu P. Mathur, president of Irvine Valley
College, by the conservative-controlled board of trustees had been
widely expected. Many faculty members on Friday called the selection
process a sham.</LD>
<LD>   Mathur, 53, was ranked fourth or fifth among the five candidates
the selection committee forwarded to trustees, said Lee Haggerty,
who, as president of the teachers union, sat on the panel. The
committee was made up of professors, administrators and staff from
Irvine Valley and Saddleback colleges, which make up the South County
district.</LD>
<TE>   "He was going to be their man from the beginning," Haggerty said.</TE>
<TE>   Don Wagner, president of the board, said trustees did not look at
the selection committee's rankings. He called Mathur "the best
candidate who came forward after a nationwide search."</TE>
<TE>   Wagner said trustees were aware of the "no-confidence" votes by
Irvine Valley faculty, but they were not discussed. District trustees
have been at odds with faculty at both campuses over employment and
governance issues.</TE>
<TE>   The vote was 5-2, with David Lang and Marcia Milchiker voting
against Mathur's appointment.</TE>
<TE>   "My feeling was the pool was inadequate and I felt we probably
ought to make certain we were looking at the best possible
candidates," Lang said of his vote. Trustee Dorothy Fortune said the
board interviewed four candidates and the fifth dropped out. She said
Mathur "has done exceptionally well in a situation full of problems
he did not make, going back 20 years."</TE>
<TE>   She said faculty criticism was directed against him because he was
following the board's direction.</TE>
<TE>   Mathur will be paid $170,000 to $180,000 a year, with details of
his contract still to be negotiated, Wagner said.</TE>
<TE>   Mathur is expected to take over Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The board decided in January 2001 not to renew the contract of the
previous chancellor, Cedric Sampson, who was on sick leave when the
board acted. During Mathur's term as president at Irvine Valley, many
administrators left, and faculty complained about his authoritarian
manner.</TE>
<TE>   Mathur acknowledged there had been divisions at Irvine Valley but
said that things have improved.</TE>
<TE>   Controversy has followed Mathur since the board voted 4-3 to
appoint him interim president of Irvine Valley in April 1997,
promoting him from chairman of the school of physical sciences.</TE>
<TE>   Five months later, a judge ruled that the board had violated the
state open-meetings law in making the appointment.</TE>
<TE>   Faculty members said he lacked administrative experience and was
too closely aligned with trustees.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, 75% of faculty at Irvine Valley voted "no confidence" in
him, and a year later, the faculty senate called for his removal.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, 90% of the faculty said they had no confidence in Mathur.</TE>

<HD>Injured Boy's Family, Disney Settle Lawsuit</HD>
<DH>Litigation: The amount ensures lifetime medical care for
Brandon Zucker, left brain-damaged in 2000 when he was trapped under
a Disneyland ride.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The family of Brandon Zucker, the boy severely brain-damaged when he
was trapped beneath a spinning ride at Disneyland in September 2000,
on Friday settled a lawsuit against the Walt Disney Co.</LD>
<LD>   The terms of the settlement are confidential, but the amount is
enough to ensure that Brandon "will continue to receive the finest
medical care for the rest of his life," according to a joint
statement issued Friday by the Walt Disney World Co. and the family's
attorneys, Thomas Girardi and Amy Fisch Solomon.</LD>
<LD>   "This has always been our primary mutual objective," the statement
said, adding that the settlement does not assign fault. The case was
scheduled to go to trial on Monday.</LD>
<TE>   The accident was the first major test case for a California law
regulating amusement parks.</TE>
<TE>   A state investigation found that operator error contributed to the
accident and ordered design changes to improve safety. The amusement
park complied and the ride has since reopened.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon, who turned 6 last month, remains hospitalized at
HealthBridge Children's Rehabilitation Hospital in Orange. He
suffered irreversible brain damage and cannot talk or walk. He is
sustained through a feeding tube.</TE>
<TE>   The accident on the Roger Rabbit Car Toon Spin ride occurred when
the family was visiting the park to celebrate the 40th birthday of
Victoria Zucker, Brandon's mother.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, the family moved to Orange County from their home in
northern Los Angeles County to be closer to Brandon. But with the
money from the settlement, they hope to return to the Santa Clarita
area and have Brandon live with them.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon's father, David Zucker, said the settlement will take care
of Brandon's needs, which "is all we wanted."</TE>
<TE>   None of the settlement details were disclosed but Santa Ana
attorney Wylie Aitken, who settled a wrongful-death case with
Disneyland stemming from a Columbia Sailing Ship accident, estimated
the Zucker settlement would probably fall "in the area of $30
million."</TE>
<TE>   That figure, Aitken said, is based on three factors: Brandon will
not be able to take care of himself financially, he will require
lifetime medical care, and "it is a permanent destruction of the
quality of life."</TE>
<TE>   Despite what Girardi called a guarded long-term prognosis, Brandon
laughs and smiles and responds to his parents, showing far more
progress than doctors expected.</TE>
<TE>   In the first days after the accident, doctors were unsure whether
he would survive.</TE>
<TE>   But Brandon, who once loved riding his scooter with his brother
Nicholas and running about and punching the air like boxer Rocky in
the Sylvester Stallone movies, kept fighting back. Even today,
Girardi said, he "continues to show great strength and improvement."</TE>
<TE>   Since December, Brandon has spent half-days in a special education
program at a public school in Tustin, bused there each day from
HealthBridge.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. and Mrs. Zucker are massively pleased that this part of the
ordeal is over," Girardi said. "Obviously, like any mom and dad, they
were not looking forward to actually going through the trial.</TE>
<TE>   "They are also very pleased with the settlement. They know that it
will take care of Brandon for the rest of his life if something
should happen to either or both of them."</TE>
<TE>   Family friend Elinor Silverstein said the Zuckers wanted to thank
everyone who prayed for Brandon. Now, she said, "They're ready to
move on and they need peace and quiet in their lives."</TE>
<TE>   While this settles the family's legal case without a trial, the
last year has been difficult for the Zuckers.</TE>
<TE>   The simplest pleasures, such as Christmas shopping for toys, are
now heartbreaking, the family said in a recent interview. Even
Brandon's 6th birthday celebration took place at the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Disneyland spokesman Ray Gomez declined to provide additional
details on the settlement, but said, "We wish them well and we're
glad that this is behind us.''</TE>
<TE>   The accident plunged Disneyland into the media spotlight for days
as questions were raised about ride safety and park procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon was riding with his brother and mother in a simulated
taxicab on the Roger Rabbit ride on Sept. 22, 2000, when he fell out
of the car's entryway and was pinned under a following car, in which
his father and grandmother were riding.</TE>
<TE>   He was dragged about 10 feet before the ride stopped
automatically.</TE>
<TE>   His 45-pound frame was trapped under the taxi for about 10 minutes
as his father, emergency workers and Disneyland guests worked
frantically to lift it off.</TE>
<TE>   When freed, Brandon was not breathing and had no pulse. He spent
days in a drug-induced coma at UCI Medical Center in Orange.</TE>
<TE>   He suffered a torn liver, spleen and diaphragm and a collapsed
lung. His pelvic bone was fractured. He suffered massive brain damage
from lack of oxygen.</TE>
<TE>   After the accident, state investigators issued a report finding
that Brandon was seated in the wrong spot--closest to the cutout
entryway--and that ride operators may have failed to lower a lap bar
completely.</TE>
<TE>   The Division of Occupational Safety and Health ordered several
safety changes and Disney overhauled the ride by adding automatic
latching doors, sensor-equipped bumpers and both audio and written
warnings.</TE>
<TE>   Disney officials have repeatedly maintained the ride is safe, even
without the state-ordered changes.</TE>
<TE>   The ride--a whimsical, spinning taxicab tour that takes passengers
through scenery based on the movie ''Who Framed Roger
Rabbit?''--travels less than 3 mph, a walking pace.</TE>
<TE>   With the exceptions of Brandon and a 13-year-old girl who suffered
minor foot injuries when she jumped off the ride to retrieve a
stuffed animal, more than 20 million visitors to Disneyland have
ridden the attraction safely.</TE>

<HD>Study Supports After-School Programs</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Enrollment in after-school programs sponsored by the state Department
of Education helped California students make academic gains,
according to a study at UC Irvine.</LD>
<LD>   At a news conference in Sacramento on Friday, state Supt. of
Public Instruction Delaine Eastin released an evaluation of the
program, which creates partnerships with local communities to provide
academic enrichment in after-school activities.</LD>
<LD>   Administrators say the study of standardized test scores and
promotion rates proves that students in those after-school programs
are doing better than students who are not enrolled in them.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a matter of extending the school day," said Pat Rainey,
administrator of the Before and After School Learning and Safe
Neighborhoods Partnerships Program, which receives $87.8 million a
year in state funds for about 1,000 centers. "School is no longer
just 8 to 3. It's about allowing kids extra time to be around their
peers and learn new things from other people."</TE>
<TE>   Students originally scoring in the lowest 25% on the SAT 9
standardized test showed the largest improvement after participating
in the after-school program, according to the UC Irvine study. In
reading, 4.2% of after-school participants moved out of the lowest
25% compared with 1.9% of all students statewide. In math, 2.5% of
after-school participants moved out of the lowest 25% as compared
with 1.9% statewide.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Joan Bissell of UC Irvine, the author of the report, said
second- and third-grade students in the after-school program were
promoted to the next grade levels at significantly higher rates than
children who weren't.</TE>

<HD>Davis Aide Departs Quickly</HD>
<DH>Social services: Frank Grimes had come under fire for
blocking funds for women's shelters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Advocates of government-supported shelters for battered women and
children Friday applauded the surprise resignation of Frank Grimes as
director of Gov. Gray Davis' office of Criminal Justice Planning.</LD>
<LD>   Grimes, a Los Angeles police officer for 32 years and a charter
member of Davis' administration, quit the $112,000 position without
advance notice effective Friday, saying he was returning to his home
state of Massachusetts to work on an undisclosed "project that is
very close to my heart."</LD>
<LD>   He did not amplify further, but said in a statement that he had
hoped this "special opportunity" would come along someday and "now
that it has, I feel that I must act immediately or it will pass me
by."</LD>
<TE>   Davis accepted the resignation "with regret." Members of the
governor's staff insisted that Grimes, 63, was not pressured to
resign, though barriers he erected to the release of government funds
for women's shelters last year have drawn heavy criticism from
influential female legislators and shelter operators.</TE>
<TE>   In October, Davis publicly scolded Grimes for denying grants to
shelters on what the governor called the "most trivial of
technicalities." These included rejecting typewritten applications
because they were not spaced correctly or had taken too many pages to
describe their programs. Grimes indicated he wanted to insert more
competition into the funding process.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the Legislature had to pass a $2-million emergency
bailout to keep the shelters program from collapsing. The foul-up
angered and embarrassed Davis, who is running for a second term.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to admit I'm pleased about his resignation," said Sheila
Halfon, director of the Haven House in Pasadena, the nation's oldest
women's shelter. Her application was among those turned down.</TE>
<TE>   Halfon said Grimes' office returned about $2 million in unspent
money to the federal government last year, asserting the shelters
didn't want or need the money. "It was never offered to us," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Grimes, who had served as Davis' liaison to law enforcement when
Davis was lieutenant governor, had been asked to appear at a special
fact-finding hearing of two Senate committees on Tuesday. He was
expected to defend his agency's process for distributing federal
money, but is not now expected to testify.</TE>
<TE>   "His [resignation] timing was perfect. Maybe he saw the
handwriting on the wall," said Sen. Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough),
chairwoman of the Select Committee on Government Oversight.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa Monica), a strong advocate of women's
shelters, said Davis' chief of staff, Lynn Schenk, had summoned
Grimes to her office two weeks ago to discuss the grants policy.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very, very evasive and very uncomfortable," said Kuehl,
who attended the session. "Lynn told him, 'This has to be fixed. The
governor is very upset.' She was very strong with him."</TE>
<TE>   Kuehl said Grimes had behaved more as an "adversary" than an
evenhanded administrator of funds. "The shelters and the sexual
assault response teams were more and more hamstrung in their ability
to provide services," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis spokesman Byron Tucker denied the notion that Grimes was
pressured to resign.</TE>
<TE>   Davis named N. Allen Sawyer, the agency's chief deputy director,
as Grimes' interim successor.</TE>

<HD>Harrises' Bail Set at $1-Million Each</HD>
<DH>Court: Though moved by support for the former SLA members,
a judge says she could be reading such things about the victim of
their alleged crime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Weighing their notorious past in the Symbionese Liberation Army
against two decades as reborn solid citizens, a Superior Court judge
on Friday ordered William and Emily Harris held on $1-million bail
each in a bloody 1975 bank robbery in a Sacramento suburb.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Tani G. Cantil-Sakauye listened to more than an hour of
heartfelt testimonials from family and friends of the two erstwhile
revolutionaries before rejecting calls for lower bail that would have
allowed them to return to lives left behind after their arrest Jan.
17.</LD>
<LD>   The judge said she was moved by the scores of letters from
supporters of the former spouses, who served nearly eight years in
state prison for SLA crimes and then forged new careers, donated to
charitable causes and established strong family ties.</LD>
<TE>   Cantil-Sakauye said she was convinced that they had indeed
experienced a quarter century of "metamorphosis and wisdom and
maturity" since the shotgun slaying of 42-year-old Myrna Opsahl
during a bank robbery in Carmichael.</TE>
<TE>   But it wasn't enough to sway her, Cantil-Sakauye told a silent
courtroom crowded with the Harris' friends. "I realized I could also
be reading those letters about Myrna Opsahl."</TE>
<TE>   The case may have grown dusty with time, the judge added, but it
remains "very serious and very much alive" in the Sacramento
community, where Opsahl is remembered as a God-fearing mother of
four. She was at the bank to count church dues when gun-wielding SLA
members stormed the branch.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys expressed dismay over the judge's ruling, but
resolved to quickly work with the pair's supporters to raise the
bail, perhaps by early next week. If they cannot come up with the
full $1 million, the attorneys plan to return to court to plead again
for lower bail.</TE>
<TE>   "To set bail at such a high amount is tantamount to punishment,"
Charles E. Bourdon, the San Francisco attorney representing Emily
Harris, said after the hearing. Attorneys were seeking $200,000 bail
for William Harris and $500,000 for his former wife, who now goes by
her maiden name, Emily Montague.</TE>
<TE>   Stuart Hanlon, William Harris' attorney, also groused that
prosecutors are attempting to "inflame the public" post-Sept. 11 by
suggesting the SLA defendants are terrorists "instead of dealing with
the present reality"--that neither defendant is a public threat or
likely to flee to avoid prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   They also rejected the judge's rationale that $1 million bail was
appropriate because it matched that set in Los Angeles after the 1999
arrest of Sara Jane Olson.</TE>
<TE>   The attorneys noted that Olson, a former SLA member who reinvented
herself as a Minnesota soccer mom, had been a fugitive for two
decades. William and Emily Harris, in contrast, served time for SLA
crimes, and refused to flee in recent weeks despite looming charges
for Opsahl's slaying.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors said the bail was appropriate given the serious
nature of the crime. Deputy Dist. Atty. Rob Gold noted that William
Harris had served for a time as SLA "general field marshal," and
Emily Harris was "at the center of that revolutionary core" that made
the SLA one of the oddest and most violent bands of militants to
emerge from the Vietnam-era tumult.</TE>
<TE>   "The irony," Gold said, "is that the Harrises now have become the
people they used to despise."</TE>
<TE>   William and Emily Harris appeared in court Friday with Olson and
Michael Bortin, 53, who also face murder charges in the bloody bank
robbery. A fifth defendant, James Kilgore, has been a fugitive since
the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Olson, 55, was sentenced Jan. 18 to 20 years to life in prison for
a failed bombing attempt against LAPD officers in 1975, and is
ineligible for bail. As she entered the courtroom Friday in a jail
jumpsuit, Olson flashed a beaming smile and said hello to a friend in
the audience.</TE>
<TE>   Bortin, extradited from his home in Oregon earlier in the week,
was grim-faced as the judge set his bail hearing for next Friday.</TE>
<TE>   William Harris, 57, and Emily Harris, 54, both wore street clothes
for the hearing, though their ankles were shackled. In a front row,
William Harris' wife, attorney Rebecca Young, sat with eldest son
Shane, 13.</TE>
<TE>   Though he served as the SLA's leader after the bloody shootout and
fire in Los Angeles that killed several of the group's top leaders in
1974, friends said in court Friday that William Harris was fully
rehabilitated. He had started a new career as a private investigator,
became a devoted father, coached youth soccer and sank roots in the
east San Francisco Bay Area. Among those who offered testimonials of
support Friday was a San Francisco Superior Court commissioner and a
research attorney at the California Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Emily Harris was described as a compassionate contributor to
causes big and small, from AIDS walks to youth basketball programs.
She has lived for years in the Los Angeles area with another woman,
and shaped a successful career as a computer consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Shoup, an Indianapolis woman who got to know Harris when
they were college sorority sisters, said her longtime friend had been
changed by the years. She corresponded with Harris in prison, and
early letters were angry and "quite political," a reflection of her
SLA days, when the group was thrust into national headlines with the
1974 kidnapping of newspaper heiress Patty Hearst.</TE>
<TE>   "But as time went on, Emily's true voice came back to me," said
Shoup, a writer and teacher.</TE>
<TE>   "Those were very strange times we grew up in," Shoup added. "We
were all shaped by the politics of those times....We all grew up, and
we don't see things in the same way."</TE>

<HD>Kerkorians Escalate Their War of Words</HD>
<DH>Courts: Billionaire accuses his ex-wife of 'deceiving' him
into thinking the baby now at the center of their child-support feud
is his.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN W. O'NEILL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The war of words escalated Friday in the bitter child-support battle
between Kirk and Lisa Kerkorian, with each accusing the other of
engaging in misleading, bare-knuckled legal tactics to the detriment
of the 3-year-old girl at the center of the dispute.</LD>
<LD>   MGM mogul Kirk Kerkorian, 84, said in court papers filed Thursday
that former tennis pro Lisa Kerkorian, 36, "deceived" him into
believing he was the child's biological father until a DNA test in
November 2000 "scientifically excluded" him. He said he told Lisa
Kerkorian about the DNA results months ago.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, Lisa Kerkorian's lawyer fired back in a written
statement in which he neither confirmed nor disputed the paternity
test's existence.</LD>
<TE>   "Whether or not there's a DNA test is legally irrelevant and
morally outrageous," said attorney Stephen A. Kolodny. He said
Kerkorian's denial was "completely inconsistent" with his sworn
statements in previous court proceedings acknowledging that he was
the father of Kira Kerkorian.</TE>
<TE>   To now deny paternity, Kolodny said, was "a particularly cruel
tactic to use against a small child."</TE>
<TE>   Kolodny was in court Friday and was not available for further
questions.</TE>
<TE>   Kerkorian believed he was Kira's father when he acknowledged
paternity in August 1999--more than a year before the DNA test, said
his lawyer, Dennis M. Wasser. Kerkorian continues to provide monthly
child support for Kira, who turns 4 in March, Wasser added.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Lisa Kerkorian initiated the public legal battle by
filing a request for $320,000 in monthly child support, accompanied
by a 33-page declaration detailing her relationship with Kirk
Kerkorian. Her court filing laid bare details of their brief 1999
marriage and divorce, as well as the lavish lifestyle they
shared--multimillion-dollar real estate transactions, dozens of trips
to Las Vegas and Hawaii aboard the MGM jet, and a $70,000 first
birthday party for Kira at the Hotel Bel-Air.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Kerkorian is asking a Los Angeles Superior Court judge to
award the record amount of child support to sustain the lifestyle she
claims her daughter enjoyed until her relationship with Kirk
Kerkorian chilled.</TE>
<TE>   In statements issued Friday, her lawyer challenged Kirk
Kerkorian's credibility and said he was shirking his duty as a
parent. Kolodny's sharply worded statement accused Kerkorian of
waging an "ongoing campaign against his 3-year-old daughter, Kira, in
his attempt to avoid supporting her."</TE>
<TE>   "They launched the campaign," the billionaire's lawyer retorted.
"They filed it in a public forum rather than in the private paternity
action."</TE>
<TE>   Kirk Kerkorian, in his own 25-page court declaration, said that he
loves Kira, has set up a trust fund for her education and is willing
to continue paying up to $50,000 a month in child support until she
turns 18. But, he added, he has tired of Lisa Kerkorian's escalating
financial demands, charging that she is using the child as a "pawn."</TE>
<TE>   In his declaration, Kirk Kerkorian said he values his privacy, and
gave Lisa Kerkorian tens of millions of dollars to keep her happy and
silent. He now is suing her for breaching half a dozen
confidentiality agreements concerning their marriage and divorce and
the issue of Kira's paternity.</TE>
<TE>   Kirk Kerkorian said he submitted samples of his and Kira's hair
for the DNA test after Lisa Kerkorian continued making financial
demands and threats to go public with details of their relationship.</TE>
<TE>   Kira was born in March 1998, about nine months after a weeklong
reconciliation in the couple's rocky relationship. They met in 1986
and became romantically involved in 1991. She claims the relationship
continued for nearly a decade. He claims it was essentially over by
1995.</TE>
<TE>   Kirk Kerkorian said he agreed to marry Lisa in August 1999 because
he "was extremely concerned about her emotional state and how it
might affect Kira." He said that she felt society "looked down" on
her because she had had a child out of wedlock and that she wanted to
"legitimize" Kira, even though the child was 17 months old.</TE>
<TE>   She said in her declaration that she was heartbroken after he
insisted that she divorce him, as agreed, a month after they married.
He lost interest in her, she said, when he could no longer use his
money and power to control her.</TE>
<TE>   The deal-breaker, according to his declaration, was her demand in
September 2000 for a $25-million trust fund. "Finally--and
belatedly--I had had enough," he said. He refused, and sought the DNA
test.</TE>
<TE>   "By late 2000, I seriously questioned whether my paternity of Kira
was simply a fabrication," he said. By then, he added, "I already had
developed a close bond with Kira." He said he considers himself her
"psychological father."</TE>
<TE>   His relationship with Lisa Kerkorian became increasingly
acrimonious after the divorce became final in January 2000. Each
dispatched police to the other's home. Finally, matters came to a
head at Christmas last year. He had given Kira a toy Mickey Mouse
phone and a pet bunny on Christmas Eve.</TE>
<TE>   On Christmas morning, he said, Lisa Kerkorian phoned him "dozens
of times," then came to his house, tossing the Mickey Mouse phone
over the fence. It broke into pieces.</TE>
<TE>   She "then threatened my houseman that if I did not come to the
phone, she was 'going to throw the rabbit over [the fence] next,"'
his court papers say.</TE>
<TE>   "Since then," Kirk Kerkorian said, he and Lisa Kerkorian have
"barely" spoken. "There is nothing to say." Because of the tension
between them, he hasn't seen Kira since Christmas Eve.</TE>

<HD>Officials Urge Open, Fair Evaluation of Police Chief</HD>
<DH>LAPD: Commission must address Parks' bid for a second term
carefully, to avoid dividing the city, they say. Officers union keeps
the pressure on, calling him 'a failure.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD and JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks' announcement that he wants
a second term prompted city officials Friday to stress the need for a
fair and open evaluation process to avoid an outcome that divides the
city.</LD>
<LD>   Parks, who formally announced his desire to stay in the job at a
private party Thursday night, will now be judged by the five-member
Police Commission, appointed by Mayor James K. Hahn.</LD>
<LD>   The commissioners will have to make their decision amid mounting
calls both for the chief's reappointment and ouster. The Police
Protective League, which represents rank-and-file officers, repeated
its long-standing opposition to his reappointment in a statement
Friday, labeling him "a failure."</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, African American community leaders are increasing their
calls for the black police chief to stay on. On Tuesday, several
hundred people attended a Police Commission meeting at a church in
South Los Angeles to voice their support for Parks.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a very difficult job, and I think we're up for the
task," said Police Commission President Rick Caruso. "If we do our
job well, there should be a minimal divisiveness going on in the
city. It's not going to be easy, but we'll get it done."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn asked people to respect the process and not allow the issue
to create tension in the city.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't a process that ought to be swayed by politics or
pressure or news conferences or anything else," he said. "This is a
serious evaluation of probably the most important general manager
position in the city of Los Angeles. It ought to be made in an
atmosphere of calm deliberation."</TE>
<TE>   Caruso said that in the next few weeks the commission will put out
a list of the criteria the panel will use to evaluate the chief.</TE>
<TE>   Those performance standards will reflect the responsibilities
Parks was given when he was hired, Caruso said, adding that the
commission will consider issues such as the crime rate and the
implementation of a federal consent decree mandating reform of the
Los Angeles Police Department. The commission's deliberations will
take place in closed session.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to do this completely on the merits of the chief's
performance and, based upon that, decide whether we believe he's the
right person to lead the department in the next five years," Caruso
said.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski, who chairs the Public Safety
Committee, said she is glad the commission has indicated that it
wants to get the evaluation process done quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "There is tension that is out in all segments of our community,"
she said. "We need not have that exacerbated."</TE>
<TE>   Parks' decision to seek a second term was expected at a party
Thursday night celebrating his 37th anniversary with the LAPD, but he
kept his guests guessing until the end. As friends and family munched
on spring rolls at the Sunset Room in Hollywood, his wife, Bobbi, and
several members of his top staff said they didn't know what he was
going to say.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, after about a dozen speakers praised his leadership,
Parks pulled out a letter to the Police Commission announcing his
request to stay on the job, and signed it on his son's back as the
guests applauded.</TE>
<TE>   His decision heated up an issue that has been at a slow boil for
months.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the union kept up its drumbeat of opposition.</TE>
<TE>   "Chief Parks has demeaned officers so that their morale is at the
lowest ebb," union leaders said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the union is trying to raise $1 million to wage
a formal campaign against Parks. In a letter to retired police
officers Jan. 17, league President Mitzi Grasso called Parks "a
disaster" and asked for donations to the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The union's tactics have drawn criticism from city leaders,
including Hahn and Caruso. African American community leaders have
accused the league of waging a dangerous campaign that could
undermine public safety.</TE>
<TE>   The debate puts Hahn, who won election with support of both
constituencies, in a difficult situation. The mayor does not have a
formal role in the reappointment process, but his opinion is expected
to carry weight with his commissioners.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn and the chief have had several public disagreements. As city
attorney, Hahn pushed for the federal consent decree, while Parks
fought it. Later, as mayor, Hahn asked Parks to implement a flexible
work schedule for police officers despite the chief's misgivings.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Hahn said he will voice his opinion about the chief
sometime during the evaluation process.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor, who was not invited to Parks' party Thursday, said the
chief told him of his decision before the announcement. Hahn did not
say what his response to Parks was.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point in the process I'm going to let my opinion be
known, but today is not that day," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The commission must make its decision about Parks by mid-May. The
panel's decision is final unless the City Council overturns it with a
vote of two-thirds, or 10 members.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, most council members refrained from offering an opinion
about Parks, saying they wanted to allow the commissioners to do
their job.</TE>
<TE>   "This is their moment," said Councilman Jack Weiss. "The city is
counting on them to be independent from politics and make the best
decision on the merits."</TE>
<TE>   Former police commissioners encouraged the current panel to
depersonalize the process as much as possible in order to cope with
the intense pressure being exerted from both sides.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to get input from the customers," said Raquelle de la
Rocha, a former commission president, referring to residents. "But
the customers don't understand the intricacies of the job. LAPD is a
massively complex organization. You wouldn't be doing a good job if
[you] overweighted [public opinion]."</TE>
<TE>   Although commissioners are assumed to share the mayor's vision,
they are also supposed to have enough independence from political
leaders to ward off the potential for corruption, said Joe Gunn,
executive director of the commission.</TE>
<TE>   The current panel has shown several flashes of independence that
mark a tendency to operate autonomously from Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   The commission balked at rubber-stamping the department's budget
recently, for example, and rather than accepting the mayor's proposal
for disciplinary changes, it decided to study the issue first.</TE>
<TE>   "You would have to be very naive to think the mayor's opinion
doesn't count," Gunn said. "But I can speak for my group here--they
are pretty opinionated."</TE>

<HD>Family, Team Mourn 'Young Pele'</HD>
<DH>Violence: A procession from his school to his home honors
soccer player. 'I still can't believe that this happened,' father
says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANUEL GAMIZ JR.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About 250 friends, relatives and teammates marched quietly along
Alondra Boulevard in Compton on Friday night to mourn the fatal
shooting of a young soccer player known to many as the "Young Pele."</LD>
<LD>   Carrying lighted candles, the mourners paused briefly to say
prayers for Jose Manuel Rodriguez at the spot where he died before
finishing their mile-long procession from Dominguez High School to
his family's home.</LD>
<LD>   Rodriguez, 17, was shot Jan. 23 as he and three teammates drove
home from school to pick up their soccer gear. A car pulled up beside
theirs at Alondra and White Avenue, and a single shot was fired.
Rodriguez, hit in the head, died the next day.</LD>
<TE>   "I still can't believe that this happened," the youth's father,
Isidro Rodriguez, said Friday night. "My son didn't deserve this. I
hope we find the person responsible."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators don't know if Rodriguez was the intended target or
if the assailant simply meant to hit anyone in his car.</TE>
<TE>   Some people in the community have speculated that the shooting
stemmed from rivalries with other schools or sports clubs. Sheriff's
homicide detectives have declined to comment, other than to say that
Rodriguez had no known ties to gangs and that the attack did not
appear to be gang-related.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez was buried Thursday, two hours before his high school
team lost a close, hard-fought game against Downey High School. The
Dominguez players wore black ribbons on their red jerseys in honor of
their teammate.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough being here, looking out there and not seeing him,"
head coach Jose Rosas said Thursday night as he watched the game. "He
would be on the field all the time. He'd play any position I asked
him to because he just loved to play."</TE>
<TE>   The boy's love of soccer started at an early age, according to his
soccer friends. His graceful play reminded them of Pele, the
Brazilian hailed by many as the greatest ever to play the game.</TE>
<TE>   "If he could, Jose would play all day," said George Alvarez, a
teammate who sat out the game.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all there for him," said Rosas, who has been at Dominguez
for 17 years. "We're family."</TE>
<TE>   Basil Kimbrew, a Compton school board member, said the tragedy has
become a familiar one in that community.</TE>
<TE>   "Probably the hardest thing in the world is to sit there and watch
your child die without being able to do anything," said Kimbrew, who
has been with the family since the shooting occurred.</TE>
<TE>   "Every year, we have more kids killed here in Compton than most
cities," Kimbrew said. "These are kids who are snuffed out in the
beginning of their lives."</TE>
<TE>   The day before Rodriguez was shot, he scored a goal in a game
against Lynwood. His team said they would remember that play for the
rest of their lives.</TE>
<TE>   "It was pure grace," Rosas said.</TE>

<HD>Davis Conferred With Enron's CEO During State Energy Crisis</HD>
<DH>Policy: Governor says he met with Lay over several months
at the request of Clinton and Bush administrations but ultimately
took none of his advice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis conferred with then-Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay
roughly half a dozen times last year when the Houston energy trader
was riding high and California was mired in its energy crisis, but
ultimately took none of his advice, the governor said in an interview
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Davis made the comments as Enron struggles to emerge from
bankruptcy, and as its influence on President Bush's energy policy
has become the focus of various investigations. Davis added his voice
earlier this week to demands for an investigation into Enron's impact
on the California energy crisis.</LD>
<LD>   The question of Davis' contacts with Lay surfaced Friday night in
a broadcast of the PBS show "Now With Bill Moyers."</LD>
<TE>   The segment focused on Lay's influence on the Bush energy policy
and with administration officials. But in an interview taped last
spring for a Frontline/New York Times co-production by investigative
journalist Lowell Bergman, Lay said he also had contact with the
Clinton administration and with Davis. At the time, the Democratic
governor publicly was labeling Texas energy companies as gougers and
pirates.</TE>
<TE>   "The strange thing is California," Lay says on the broadcast. "I
mean, Gray Davis will put me in that same list as one of the biggest
snakes on the globe. But yet ... he very much wants to meet with me,
and he can call me up from time to time and ask ... my advice on
things, which is just a little bit incongruous."</TE>
<TE>   Davis, whose handling of California's energy crisis has become a
campaign issue, was quick to respond. In an interview, Davis said he
spoke with Lay at the urging of top federal officials ranging from
Clinton and Clinton's energy advisors to several ranking Bush
administration officials.</TE>
<TE>   Their conversations date back to December 2000 and continued until
last May, Davis said. The former Enron chief came across as cordial,
thoughtful and professorial, Davis recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, Davis said, he hoped Lay would be "an honest broker"
who could provide counsel and mediate between the state, other
independent power generators and the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no apologies for talking to Ken Lay," Davis said. "Every
government official in the Clinton and Bush administrations said,
'Have you talked to Ken Lay?' I did learn a good deal talking to Ken
Lay. I learned his view was quite different than mine.... I did ask
him for advice on a number of things, and he generally gave me advice
that I did not take. In fact, I can't remember any advice I took."</TE>
<TE>   Lay urged Davis to require that consumers pay the record wholesale
prices being charged for power in late 2000 and last year, Davis
said.</TE>
<TE>   Lay also advocated that private companies be allowed to take
control of the state's massive electrical power grid, and that the
state further deregulate the electric system, the governor said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said Lay, who once worked in the U.S. Department of Energy
and turned Enron into the country's seventh-largest corporation, was
widely seen by officials in Washington as being "the single most
knowledgeable person about energy deregulation."</TE>
<TE>   "He comes across as having no ax to grind," Davis said. ''He had a
huge ax to grind in seeing that energy deregulation was not changed
in any way."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' explanation did not quiet his political rivals, who used
the opportunity to again attack Davis' handling of the energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Bill Jones, seeking the Republican nomination
for governor, renewed his call on Davis to return Enron campaign
donations. Davis has taken $119,500 from the company since 1996,
including $42,500 since taking office in 1999. Davis has indicated no
plans to return the money, but says he no longer accepts campaign
money from energy brokers or generators.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a policy disaster and a political embarrassment," said
Jones. "It is a good example of big money and access."</TE>
<TE>   Citing calls in Washington for the Bush administration to turn
over records of contacts with Lay, Jones said that "the same request
could be made to Davis for phone records and documents."</TE>
<TE>   Added Margita Thompson, spokeswoman for Richard Riordan, the
former Los Angeles mayor who also is seeking the GOP nomination: "We
need to know what happened in those meetings and we need to know what
role Enron played in Davis' energy fiasco."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan himself met with Lay at a Beverly Hills hotel in May. At
the meeting, Lay presented Riordan a four-page plan detailing his
solution to California's energy crisis. The plan called for further
energy deregulation. Also attending the meeting were actor Arnold
Schwarzenegger and financier Michael Milken.</TE>
<TE>   Enron was in a far different financial position in May, having
reported first-quarter revenue of $50.1 billion, nearly a 281%
increase over the same quarter in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Davis administration officials said the governor last spoke with
Lay on May 8, the date on which California had the last of its six
rolling blackouts. An estimated 300,000 people were left without
power for hours, and electricity was trading at record highs. Davis
spokesman Steve Maviglio said Davis urged Lay to attend a meeting in
Sacramento of power generators. Lay sent an underling.</TE>
<TE>   Davis also met in Los Angeles and in Washington with Lay and
several other executives and state and federal officials.
Additionally, Lay visited the governor at his Capitol office at least
once last year.</TE>
<TE>   Any benefit that Lay received from the access to Davis is unclear.
Davis said there were no benefits for the company. And Enron
spokeswoman Karen Denne said Davis followed none of Lay's advice:
"That's safe to say. Everything they needed to do, they did too
late."</TE>
<TE>   Davis defends his handling of the energy crisis, saying his
actions helped avert economic disaster and power outages during the
summer.</TE>
<TE>   "These people could care less about tomorrow," Davis added. "They
just wanted to bilk us for every dollar they can get today. They're
just a bunch of wildcatters. They want your money; they want it now
They want your first born; they want it now."</TE>

<HD>Some Trusted Inmates Just Walk Out the Door</HD>
<DH>Jail: Selected convicts get special status on work details,
and a few take advantage of it to escape. Then the low-key hunt for
them is on. Critics fault screening process.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They are known in the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department as
walk-aways.</LD>
<LD>   They are convicted inmates who are allowed to work in the
department's stations and jails because they are considered
low-security risks but who nevertheless take advantage of the light
supervision to slip away undetected.</LD>
<LD>   In one week last month, four of them walked away. Three were
captured and returned to jail to face felony escape charges. One
remains at large; two detectives are literally beating the bushes in
Wilmington searching for the former transient.</LD>
<TE>   The department does not respond in the same way to these escapes
as it does when other inmates, considered to be more dangerous, flee.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer's escape by Kevin Jerome Pullum, for instance,
triggered a widespread search that included about half the department
and the LAPD. Pullum eluded authorities at the Twin Towers jail after
being convicted of attempted murder; he used a fake identification
card with a photo of actor Eddie Murphy as "Dr. Dolittle" to slip
out.</TE>
<TE>   Scores of deputies, along with police from other agencies, fanned
out across the county to capture Pullum. He was found on skid row by
Los Angeles Police Department officers.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the hunt for walk-aways is low-key. Six detectives
have the job of finding them; between searches, those deputies tend
to other duties. Often, however, their hunts for walk-aways are short
ones.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Sheriff Dennis Dahlman, who oversees the custody
division, said that when he was a deputy in Lynwood, inmate workers
would occasionally leave their posts, only to stop in at the topless
bar next door. Deputies would simply drop in on the bar, round up the
wayward inmate and head back to the station, quarry in tow.</TE>
<TE>   Convicted Felons Now Part of Special Program</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the pool of inmates used for these work
assignments has changed. Years ago, more of the inmates were in jail
for less serious offenses, such as drunk driving, public drinking and
low-level drug possession. Today, however, inmates in the program are
more likely to be convicted felons, serving county jail sentences
for, among other things, robbery or assault with a deadly weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Pedro Guevara, the inmate who escaped this month and continues to
elude authorities, was convicted of robbery and sentenced to a year
in county jail.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's Department officials defend their practice of using
inmates to clean and perform various duties in the stations and
jails. They say these inmates provide a valuable service, saving the
county--and thus, taxpayers--money that would otherwise be spent on
costly maintenance contracts. Inmates even clean the sheriff's
headquarters in Monterey Park.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, department officials say, they are careful to screen
these inmates to select only those who are determined to be at the
lowest risk of escaping. Of the nearly 3,000 inmates who applied for
the work program last year, 1,900 were disqualified from station
assignments.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be honest with you," Dahlman said. "We're going to make
mistakes on people. We make the best determination we can ... but
we've had these walk-aways since we've had the program."</TE>
<TE>   Baca's Rivals Criticize Eligibility Parameters</TE>
<TE>   Still, some are concerned, particularly by the recent spate of
escapes.</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Mike Antonovich recently directed department
officials to explain the screening process for these inmates. And
Sheriff Lee Baca's challengers in the upcoming election said they
would not allow it to continue in its present form.</TE>
<TE>   "These are serious felons," Antonovich said in an interview.
"Those convicted of violent offenses should not be part of the
program."</TE>
<TE>   Sgt. Patrick Gomez, who is opposing Baca in the March 5 election,
said he would require inmates to wear an ankle bracelet to track
their whereabouts if they work outside the jails or stations. And,
Sgt. John Stites, another Baca challenger, said he would reevaluate
how inmates are screened for the program.</TE>
<TE>   The guidelines are stricter for inmates assigned to work in
stations than for those working in jails. The inmates in the stations
typically have more freedom, and department officials say they have
more rigid requirements.</TE>
<TE>   According to the department guidelines, inmates who are eligible
to work in stations cannot have any prior violent crime or sex crime
convictions, they cannot have extensive criminal records, and they
must be serving sentences of 90 days or more in county jail. They
must not have any current restraining orders against them, nor can
they be under any medical or mental health care. They also must have
a permanent home address.</TE>
<TE>   Inmates who work in the jails, known in the department as
trusties, must meet many of those same guidelines but not all.</TE>
<TE>   Guevara, 55, was sentenced in November. He did not have an
extensive record, and he was not receiving any ongoing medical care,
according to the department and the prosecutor who handled the case.
He was, however, a transient when he was arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Guevara walked away from the Century Regional Detention Facility
in Lynwood on Jan. 16. He was working on the loading dock with about
six other inmates when the deputy supervising the workers apparently
got a phone call and entered a nearby office, the station captain
said. At that point, Guevara slipped on a jumpsuit used by other
workers, turned his jail-issued denim jacket inside out and ran past
the security gate to freedom.</TE>
<TE>   "He had been working that assignment for the previous 30 days, but
for whatever reason, he picked that day to leave," said Capt. Steven
Selby, who commands the jail. "How dangerous is this person? To us,
he was a very, very low risk."</TE>
<TE>   What typically makes these inmates bolt, Sheriff's Department
officials say, is an emotional call from a family member, a
girlfriend or a close friend.</TE>
<TE>   That's precisely what happened on Jan. 12, officials say, when two
inmates escaped together from the East Los Angeles station. One left
after hearing from a girlfriend, and the other left after he was
notified that a friend had been shot, department officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The men were found, four days later, hiding in an attic of a house
in Huntington Park. Ramon Ferrin, 18, was sentenced for drug
possession; the other, Jose Iniguez, 20, for weapons possession.</TE>
<TE>   The third worker who escaped in January, Derik Frazier, 19, walked
away from the Temple City station Jan. 10 and was recaptured 11 days
later, hiding under a bed in West Covina. Frazier had been sentenced
to a year in county jail on a felony burglary charge.</TE>
<TE>   8 Inmates Walked Away Last Year; 7 Recaptured</TE>
<TE>   In all, six inmates who worked in stations escaped last year; five
were found. Two escaped from jails, and both were captured. So far
this year, four have walked away from stations, and three have been
captured.</TE>
<TE>   Guevara is proving elusive. Dets. Robert Mallon and Michael Soop
are spending their days cruising alleys, overpasses and parks, and
passing out fliers featuring Guevara's mug shot. They promise
transients $20 for information.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a matter of time," Mallon said the other day as he
picked through blankets and garbage in an area next to railroad
tracks and across from large, bright yellow sulfur piles in
Wilmington. "He's going to get caught. He doesn't know anything else
but this.... We'll get him sooner or later."</TE>
<TE>   Mallon, who has worked for the department 32 years, said he will
chase Guevara until he is caught, or until Mallon receives another
case. As a member of the department's metro unit, Mallon also
investigates cases involving kidnapping for ransom, murders for hire,
major extortion and serial robberies. He worked on the Pullum case,
putting in hours and hours of overtime along with other detectives.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Joe Impellizeri, Mallon's boss, said he makes a judgment call
about the length of these searches and the resources committed to
them.</TE>
<TE>   "We're assessing the risk to the community," he said. "I'm not
going to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in overtime like we
did with Pullum. This guy's not a threat."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Alfred Coletta, who prosecuted Guevara, said
the inmate had used a knife in the course of a robbery that involved
his girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   Coletta said the victim, another transient, had tried to get his
radio back from the girlfriend when Guevara apparently threw down the
knife to intimidate him.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think he's going to be a mass murderer in L.A. County,"
Coletta said. "I don't think he's going to be hard to find."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the hours spent driving through Wilmington aren't the most
thrilling for the veteran detective. "It's exasperating," Mallon
said. "Real exasperating."</TE>

<HD>Appeals Court Voids Death Sentence of Man in Gruesome
Double Murder</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court on Friday overturned the death sentence of a
Lassen County man who has been on death row in San Quentin for nearly
20 years, ruling that the killer's attorney provided unacceptably
deficient representation.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals held 3 to 0 that attorney
Thomas Buckwalter "was constitutionally ineffective in failing to
investigate and present potentially compelling mitigating evidence to
the jury" about his client Benjamin W. Silva.</LD>
<LD>   The appellate panel ordered a new state court sentencing hearing
for Silva, now 49, overturning a ruling by a federal district judge
in Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   However, the appeals court upheld Silva's convictions on
first-degree murder and kidnapping, stemming from the gruesome deaths
of two college students in Madeline, Calif., in January 1981. The
trial judge in the case said he had never seen any crime "more
heartless or coldblooded."</TE>
<TE>   "I am pleased, obviously, and glad it was a unanimous decision,"
said USC law professor Michael J. Brennan, who, along with San
Francisco attorney Philip Trevino, represented Silva in his federal
appeal. "Phil and I both have believed for many years that Mr. Silva
was entitled to further state proceedings."</TE>
<TE>   Robert M. Foster, a deputy attorney general, said he was
disappointed with the ruling. He said the state would ask the 9th
Circuit to rehear the case with a larger panel of judges. He said the
three-judge panel had mischaracterized Buckwalter's performance.</TE>
<TE>   Buckwalter, who is now the district attorney in Modoc County, said
he would have no comment until a final ruling has been rendered.</TE>
<TE>   According to testimony and court records, Silva and two other men,
Joe Shelton and Norman Thomas, used a red light to simulate a police
car and stop Kevin Thorpe, 21, and Laura Craig, 20, on U.S. 395 near
Madeline.</TE>
<TE>   The three men forced the couple to drive to Shelton's property and
took their cash and belongings, court records show.</TE>
<TE>   "Thorpe then was chained to a tree while Craig was taken inside a
cabin and repeatedly sexually assaulted," according to the 9th
Circuit decision.</TE>
<TE>   The following day, Silva and Shelton killed Thorpe by shooting him
numerous times at close range with an M-11 machine gun. Then, Thomas
testified, at Silva's direction, he dismembered Thorpe's body.</TE>
<TE>   Several days later Craig was shot twice and killed by the side of
the road.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas told police of the murders a few weeks later after being
found in possession of a firearm in violation of his probation. In
exchange for the evidence he provided, murder charges were dropped
against Thomas, and he received an 11-year sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Shelton was tried later that year and received a life sentence
after being convicted of killing Thorpe and Craig.</TE>
<TE>   Because of publicity at the time, Silva's trial was moved to San
Bernardino County. Thomas served as the key witness against Silva,
who was convicted of killing Thorpe but acquitted of murdering Craig.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, the California Supreme Court, in a 6-1 ruling, upheld the
guilty verdict and the death sentence against Silva. The U.S. Supreme
Court declined to review the case. Then, new lawyers asked a federal
judge to review the case, and a number of delays ensued.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian rejected the defense
attorney's contention that trial lawyer Buckwalter's performance had
been inadequate at either phase of the trial.</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit said that although Buckwalter's performance during
the guilt or innocence portion was "far from ideal," it still "met
minimum standards of reasonableness." But the appellate judges said
the attorney was so inadequate during the penalty phase that he
harmed Silva's cause.</TE>
<TE>   "Buckwalter's failure to investigate Silva's background and to
prepare evidence relating to his family history, mental health and
substance abuse problems resulted in an egregious failure to uncover
and present a raft of potentially compelling mitigating evidence" to
the jury in the penalty phase, Judge Betty B. Fletcher wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Her opinion was joined by Judges Sidney R. Thomas and Kim M.
Wardlaw.</TE>
<TE>   Buckwalter had told a federal magistrate that he was hamstrung
because Silva had threatened to disrupt the trial if Buckwalter
contacted his parents and that this possibility prevented him from
even secretly trying to investigate Silva's background, lest his
client find out.</TE>
<TE>   Silva admitted telling Buckwalter that he did not want him to use
his parents as witnesses, but said he never ordered Buckwalter not to
talk to them or threatened to alienate the jury, Fletcher wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever was said, an attorney's "duty to investigate mitigating
evidence is never entirely removed nor substantially alleviated by
his client's direction not to call particular witnesses to the
stand,"' Fletcher wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "Put another way, even if he could call Silva's parents as
witnesses, Buckwalter still had a duty to determine what evidence was
out there in mitigation in order to make an informed decision as to
how to best represent his client," Fletcher added.</TE>
<TE>   Among the evidence unearthed by Silva's new lawyers, Fletcher
emphasized, was that he had been "severely abused and neglected as a
child by alcoholic and impoverished parents; that he may suffer from
organic brain disorders resulting from fetal alcohol syndrome ... and
that at the time of the crime, he was probably suffering from
amphetamine-induced organic mental disorders and withdrawal
symptoms."</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, Buckwalter's performance was not only well below
professional norms, it prejudiced Silva's chance at the penalty phase
and undermined confidence in the outcome, Fletcher wrote.</TE>

<HD>A New Direction for 4 Orphaned Brothers, Sisters</HD>
<DH>Family: The siblings feared they would be separated after
their mother died. However, friends and counselors help them stay
together.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Skateboarders call it doing a "180 Ollie"--picking yourself up and,
in an instant, turning yourself in a totally new direction.</LD>
<LD>   That's what the four Lee orphans are doing, thanks to their
teenage skateboarding buddies at Fairfax High School and strangers
who banded together in a desperate campaign to help the youngsters
stay together.</LD>
<LD>   The children--15-year-old twins Shane and Patrick, and sisters
Grace, 12, and Emily, 13--were left parentless two months ago when
their mother died of a heart attack.</LD>
<TE>   They spent several days in temporary shelters before a friend of
their mother reunited them and moved them into her small Westside
apartment.</TE>
<TE>   But that turned out to be a temporary reprieve. The woman's
landlord decided that the children were in violation of the lease.
They were ordered to leave the apartment by today.</TE>
<TE>   A week ago, the four seemed on the verge of being scattered among
individual foster homes--or worse. Because foster parents often are
difficult to find for teenagers, the twin boys knew they could end up
in Los Angeles County's McClaren Hall, a children's crisis center
that often houses troubled youngsters and juvenile delinquents.</TE>
<TE>   Some timely intervention by the skateboarders changed that.</TE>
<TE>   They tipped off a school counselor about the plight of Patrick and
Shane and their sisters. The counselor got a pair of school social
workers involved. The workers enlisted the help of a private
psychotherapist who had contacts within a gay parents support group.
Members of that group came to the orphans' rescue.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the Lee children learned they have a new home. And,
for a change, a father.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't let those kids be split up," said Gavin Glynn, who
will serve as their foster dad until he can adopt them.</TE>
<TE>   "These are kids coming out of a tragic situation, not out of a
tragic environment. They are very loving, hopeful, ambitious kids."</TE>
<TE>   Glynn, a 40-year-old television writer, is already the father of a
7-year-old boy he is in the process of adopting. They live in a
five-bedroom home in the West Adams district.</TE>
<TE>   He met the Lee children last weekend. Over dinner at a Norm's
Restaurant, he heard the heartbreaking tale of how the youngsters
were left alone after their mother died Dec. 6.</TE>
<TE>   Katherine Lee, 46, was an employee of a Venice moving and storage
company. She was a single parent: Her husband had walked out on the
family and dropped from sight nearly a dozen years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Lee had battled cancer. But the treatment for that had led to
heart problems that caused her to be hospitalized early last year.</TE>
<TE>   Her children immediately called 911 when Lee was stricken with a
heart attack in late November at the family's North Hollywood home.
Patrick followed instructions relayed to him on the phone by the
emergency operator and performed CPR as paramedics responded. But his
mother died later at UCLA Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   Determined to Keep Siblings Together</TE>
<TE>   After the four children's brief stint in temporary housing, their
friends were determined to keep them from being swept into Los
Angeles County's 51,000-child foster-care system and separated.</TE>
<TE>   With the approval of a distant relative who is unable to take in
the four, the Lee children were claimed by Rebecca Toole, a former
neighbor of Lee. Toole is a medical office worker and the mother of
an 11-year-old. She led the Lee children through a difficult
Christmas with the assistance of friends who helped with gifts.
January's eviction order was a jolt to everyone.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd used up all my savings by that time or else we'd have moved
instantly," said Toole--who helped the four children gather photos
and other mementos from their old house before its furnishings were
carted away. "I wish I could have kept all four of them. I would have
if I could."</TE>
<TE>   Shane, Patrick, Emily and Grace worried that they would be split
up four ways when they left Toole. "Maybe," Patrick told one of his
skateboarding pals, "Shane and I could stay together and Emily and
Grace could stay together. We could stay two and two, and be close
enough to talk."</TE>
<TE>   Skateboarder Jason Mendez, also 15, asked his parents if Patrick
and Shane could move in with him. That was not possible, but Jason
mentioned his friends' dilemma to Fairfax High counselor Amanda
Jiggins.</TE>
<TE>   Jiggins is popular with Fairfax High's skateboarders because she
lets them store their boards in her office during the school day.
Skateboards may not be ridden on campus.</TE>
<TE>   "I have my little posse of about 12 or 15 skateboarders. Shane and
Patrick are part of the bunch," Jiggins said.</TE>
<TE>   It was Jason who told Jiggins of Lee's heart attack. Jiggins
immediately took Shane and Patrick aside and quietly inquired about
their well-being.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked them if they were OK, if they needed anyone to talk to.
They said, 'No, we're fine, we have each other.' I asked about their
sisters. They said Emily was real sad. I decided I had to find out
what was happening to these kids," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so worried that the second they got into the system they'd
be dispersed," Jiggins said. "The boys had said it: They had each
other."</TE>
<TE>   Jiggins alerted school social worker Brenda Rappaport. She is a
licensed family therapist who assists troubled Fairfax High students
through a state-funded program called Healthy Start. She also serves
Burroughs Jr. High School, where Grace and Emily are enrolled.</TE>
<TE>   Rappaport and campus Parent Center coordinator Heather Evans began
spreading the word that a new home was needed for four worthy
children. Rappaport also mentioned the search to West Los Angeles
psychotherapist Terry Jordan, who shares a private practice office
suite with her.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan remembered that her brother, Grant Gochin, is affiliated
with the gay fathers support group Pop Luck. Gochin, a Chatsworth
financial planner, e-mailed the group's 160 members on Jan. 24.
Twelve hours later, Glynn responded. "The Lee kids can live here," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Glynn contacted the private children's placement group that he
worked with when he took in his son. Sylvia Fogelman, founder of the
Southern California Foster Family and Adoption Agency, was astounded
by his offer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unusual for people to reach out quite this way. Most people
are wary of teenagers, even one," Fogelman said.</TE>
<TE>   'I Think It's</TE>
<TE>   Going to Be Good'</TE>
<TE>   Because Glynn already was certified to be a foster parent, things
moved quickly. A department employee showed up around midnight Monday
to collect the children, and Tuesday the children began settling in
at Glynn's home.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's going to be good," said Shane that afternoon. "It
can't get worse."</TE>
<TE>   By the day's end the four also found themselves deep within the
system: The first order of business by the county was to clamp a lid
of secrecy over the case, prohibiting further contact with the
children by The Times.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, county officials began the closed-door process of
making them wards of the court. A county worker showed up early to
take the children to a surprise court hearing. Shane and Patrick
convinced her to instead let them go to Fairfax High and take
semester final exams.</TE>
<TE>   Declining to comment directly on the case, department director
Anita Bock nonetheless praised Glynn. "Sibling groups are difficult
to place. Teenagers and preteens are harder to place. They bring a
specific set of challenges," she said. "It's great to find somebody
who can take all the children."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, those who rallied to help Grace, Emily, Patrick and
Shane were still at work.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Mendez was figuring out how he can get his parents
fingerprinted and background checked so that his skateboarding
buddies can once again sleep over at his house. Now that they are in
the system, that procedure is required by officials.</TE>
<TE>   Grant Cochin worked with a lawyer friend to complete paperwork
establishing an education fund for the Lee kids. Contributions can be
made to the "Lee Children's Irrevocable Trust" through Gochin at
Merrill Lynch Private Client Group, 16830 Ventura Blvd. No. 601,
Encino, CA 91436.</TE>
<TE>   Terry Jordan was offering a lifetime of free counseling service to
the four youngsters to help them work through their trauma.</TE>
<TE>   Brenda Rappaport and Heather Evans were waiting for word about
Thursday's private court hearing to make certain the children's
placement is proceeding as hoped.</TE>
<TE>   Rebecca Toole was in contact with the orphans' new court-appointed
attorneys, reminding them that she could be counted on in case of
emergencies.</TE>
<TE>   Amanda Jiggins was lining up a truck so that today she can pick up
desks that friends have donated for the children to use in their new
bedrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Gavin Glynn was hunting for a van that will accommodate his whole
family. He also was making plans for a memorial for Katherine Lee
that will help bring some closure to her children.</TE>
<TE>   "These kids are so genuine and kind. They're very caring to my
son--they're already treating him like a little brother," Glynn said.
"I lucked out."</TE>
<TE>   No, four orphans lucked out.</TE>

<HD>Winona Ryder Charged in $4,760 Shoplifting</HD>
<DH>Courts: Burglary, grand theft, drug possession and
vandalism filing is 'out of whack,' her lawyer says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Actress Winona Ryder was charged Friday with four felony counts for
allegedly shoplifting about $4,760 in merchandise from a Beverly
Hills department store and possessing a controlled substance in
December, prosecutors said.</LD>
<LD>   Ryder, 30, faces one count each of second-degree commercial
burglary, grand theft of personal property, vandalism with more than
$400 damage and possession of Oxycodone, a controlled substance,
according to court papers filed Friday by the Los Angeles County
district attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   She is free on $20,000 bail, but prosecutors have recommended an
increase to $30,000. If she is convicted, she could face a sentence
of three years and eight months in state prison.</LD>
<TE>   Ryder's defense attorney, Mark Geragos, said that he was not
surprised charges were filed, but that he believed their severity was
"out of whack."</TE>
<TE>   Geragos said his client had prescriptions for the drugs she was
carrying and had receipts for the merchandise. She maintains her
innocence, he said.</TE>
<TE>   ''The idea that they charged her with four felonies is
mind-boggling,'' he said. ''I believe we're going to prevail.''</TE>
<TE>   Ryder's publicist, Mara Buxbaum, issued a statement on her behalf:</TE>
<TE>   "We are shocked at what appear to be grossly exaggerated charges,"
the statement said. "We look forward to the opportunity to explain
and resolve these allegations."</TE>
<TE>   District attorney's spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said the reason for
the charges was simple: "We had the evidence."</TE>
<TE>   Ryder was arrested Dec. 13 after video cameras at a Saks Fifth
Avenue store allegedly recorded her taking the items, removing their
antitheft devices and stuffing them into a large bag. When store
security officers confronted her outside the store, they searched her
bag and found the merchandise, as well as pain medication,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder originally was set to be arraigned in early January, but
prosecutors said they needed more time to review the evidence.
Beverly Hills Superior Court Judge Elden Fox extended her bail bond
and told her to return Feb. 8 for arraignment.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors asked Beverly Hills detectives for more help
investigating the case. Detectives presented additional evidence this
week to prosecutors, who examined it and late Thursday made their
decision to file charges.</TE>
<TE>   Geragos said he spoke with the actress for several hours Thursday
night. "She's had better days. But she is as tough as they come," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Geragos met with prosecutors last month and showed them various
documents that he described as exonerating evidence.</TE>
<TE>   But Gibbons said Friday, "Whatever he presented was insufficient
to cause us to change our mind on the charges."</TE>
<TE>   Geragos said he does not believe Oxycodone was what Ryder had in
her purse the day of her arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Oxycodone, a strong narcotic pain reliever similar to morphine, is
the active ingredient in OxyContin. OxyContin produces a heroin-level
high and has been linked to abuse and deaths nationwide, according to
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.</TE>
<TE>   Geragos said Ryder was taking pain medication because she broke
her arm last spring while shooting a movie and re-injured it a few
days before she went shopping in December.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder has appeared in films including "Girl, Interrupted" and
"Reality Bites." She is a two-time Academy Award nominee, for best
actress in "Little Women" and for best supporting actress in "The Age
of Innocence."</TE>
<TE>   After her arrest, T-shirts with the slogan "Free Winona" hit
novelty stores.</TE>

<HD>Hildegard Knef, 76; Sultry German Actress, Torch Singer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hildegard Knef, a smoky-voiced actress and singer who starred in
Germany's first post-World War II movie and scandalized church
officials with a 1951 nude scene, died Friday at a Berlin hospital.
She was 76.</LD>
<LD>   Officials at the Heckeshorn Lung Clinic said Knef, who had
suffered from emphysema, died of a lung infection after being brought
to the hospital on Thursday. Her health had declined after emergency
lung surgery last year.</LD>
<LD>   ''She was the voice of Berlin and one of Germany's greatest
international stars,'' said Dieter Kosslick, the director of the
Berlin Film Festival. He said the festival, which opens next week,
would adjust its program to honor her.</LD>
<TE>   Knef, born in Ulm, studied at the Babelsberg Film Institute and
acted on stage in war-shattered Berlin just after the end of World
War II. She became a star for her role as a former concentration camp
inmate returning home in Wolfgang Staudte's 1946 ''Murderers Are
Among Us.''</TE>
<TE>   Knef, who sometimes worked as Hildegard Neff in the U.S., appeared
in more than 50 films, most of them made in Europe. She reportedly
turned down a Hollywood studio contract after being told she would
have to change her name and say she was Austrian, not German.</TE>
<TE>   She scandalized Roman Catholic authorities with a brief nude scene
in the 1951 German film ''The Story of a Sinner.'' Among her other
film credits were as Pirate Jenny in a 1962 version of ''The
Threepenny Opera'' and as Catherine the Great in ''Catherine of
Russia.''</TE>
<TE>   Her work in the United States included the role of Ninotchka in
Cole Porter's Broadway musical ''Silk Stockings'' in the 1950s, and a
supporting role in ''The Snows of Kilimanjaro,'' an adaptation of the
Ernest Hemingway story that starred Gregory Peck and Ava Gardner.</TE>
<TE>   She launched a career as a singer in the 1960s and wrote a
best-selling 1970 autobiography, ''The Gift Horse.''</TE>
<TE>   She continued to act and sing almost until the end of her life,
appearing as herself in the 2000 documentary ''Marlene Dietrich: Her
Own Song'' and in the 1999 German comedy ''An Almost Perfect
Wedding.''</TE>
<TE>   Marriages to American Kurt Hirsch and British actor David Cameron
ended in divorce. She is survived by her husband, Paul von Schell,
and her daughter, Christina Antonia.</TE>

<HD>New Court Site Announced</HD>
<DH>Downtown L.A.: State building declared unsafe after the
Northridge quake will be razed and the land sold to the federal
government.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California and federal officials announced Friday the state will sell
an empty office building in downtown Los Angeles that will be
bulldozed for construction of a 20-story federal courthouse by 2008.</LD>
<LD>   The building, at 1st Street and Broadway, was deemed unsafe after
the 1994 Northridge earthquake. It will be razed and the land subject
to a toxic cleanup before construction begins, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The federal government has allocated $34.5 million for the
purchase and design work, and Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Los
Angeles) expressed confidence that Congress will soon appropriate the
$414 million needed to build the courthouse.</LD>
<TE>   Richard Scofield, a spokesman for the House Appropriations
Committee, confirmed a nonpartisan commission on judicial needs has
placed Los Angeles very high on a priority list to receive the money.</TE>
<TE>   The new courthouse will be the quarters for 60 U.S. district
judges and magistrates, while the existing federal courthouse at 312
N. Spring St. will be used mainly for U.S. attorney offices,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The other U.S. courthouse downtown is in the Roybal Federal
Building.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the U.S. General Services Administration invited
artists to submit proposals by Feb. 15 for interior and exterior art
for the new structure.</TE>
<TE>   The prospect of a new federal courthouse, the third in downtown
Los Angeles, comes at a time when the Civic Center area is about to
undergo substantial new building, clearing and renovation, with the
city, county, state and federal governments all involved.</TE>
<TE>   * The California Department of Transportation plans to begin
construction in the middle of next year on a $170-million regional
headquarters on property bounded by 1st, 2nd, Los Angeles and Main
streets.</TE>
<TE>   * The old Caltrans building and other structures on the block
bounded by 1st, 2nd, Main and Spring streets will be razed, and that
area will become open space. The city has set aside $25 million for
the project and negotiated a land swap with the state.</TE>
<TE>   * The venerable county Hall of Justice on the north side of Temple
Street between Broadway and Spring Street, vacant and in considerable
disrepair for several years, also would be refurbished under a
contract between the county and a private partnership that is now in
final discussions. The value of the project has been put at $80
million or more.</TE>
<TE>   The projects continue a downtown building boom that began with the
new Roman Catholic cathedral and Los Angeles Philharmonic concert
hall. Both are well along in the construction process.</TE>
<TE>   Aileen Adams, secretary of the State and Consumer Services Agency,
said the state agreed to sell the 3.7-acre 1st and Broadway site to
the federal government for $2.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   She said $500,000 of the purchase price for what was known as the
Junipero Serra State Office Building will be put in escrow to pay for
removal of any ground contamination. The rest of the money will go
into the state's general fund.</TE>
<TE>   Adams said building the 1.3-million-square-foot courthouse is
expected to produce between $100 million and $150 million in
construction wages as well as a substantial number of permanent
courthouse jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Sharon Yonashiro, a county official involved in
developing plans for refurbishment of the Hall of Justice, said
Friday the county last year entered into an exclusive negotiating
agreement with Clark Construction Co., Urban Partners and a number of
architectural firms to pursue the project as a long-term lease and
lease-back arrangement.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very anxious to proceed," she said. "A big transaction and
negotiations take a long time, but we are very seriously working with
this entity toward bringing a contract to the Board of Supervisors
for approval."</TE>
<TE>   County Sheriff Lee Baca has expressed interest in moving his
department's headquarters back into the Hall of Justice when the
refurbishment is complete.</TE>

<HD>Wife's Blood Found in Home</HD>
<DH>Crime: The evidence is discovered in couple's bedroom. Her
husband pleads not guilty to murder.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN and JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Detectives found a small amount of Jana Carpenter-Koklich's blood in
the bedroom she shared with her husband, who is charged with killing
her, authorities said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Bruce Koklich, 42, pleaded not guilty Friday to one count of
murder at the Los Cerritos Courthouse in Bellflower.
Carpenter-Koklich, daughter of the late ex-state Sen. Paul Carpenter,
disappeared Aug. 18 from her Lakewood home, authorities said. Her
body has not been found.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff's Lt. Ray Peavy said Friday that when investigators
checked the interior of the home, there was "no blood visible to the
naked eye." But they discovered the blood spots by using Luminol, a
substance that makes even trace amounts detectable. The blood matched
Carpenter-Koklich's, Peavy said.</LD>
<TE>   Sheriff's detectives also found larger bloodstains in her Nissan
Pathfinder, which was found Aug. 27 in a Signal Hill garage.
Detectives declined Friday to explain the suspected motive, why the
evidence points to Koklich or the timing of the arrest, which
occurred a week after the death of Carpenter-Koklich's father.</TE>
<TE>   Koklich was arrested Thursday outside his Long Beach real estate
office and was taken to Los Angeles County Jail, where he is being
held in lieu of $1-million bail. Los Angeles County Superior Court
Judge Barbara M. Scheper denied a request Friday to reduce that
amount.</TE>
<TE>   Koklich's attorney, Henry Salcido, said his client plans to post
bail next week in the form of property bonds.</TE>
<TE>   The suspect had reported his 41-year-old wife missing Monday
morning, Aug. 20, when she did not show up for work at the office
they shared and when he could not find her at home. He also offered a
reward for information on her whereabouts.</TE>
<TE>   That weekend, her mother said Friday, Carpenter-Koklich did not
return her phone calls and missed a date with her to see a movie.</TE>
<TE>   When Janeth Carpenter asked her son-in-law what the couple had
been doing over the weekend, "he couldn't tell me anything," she
said. "I knew that he must have been lying."</TE>
<TE>   Carpenter said she went to their house several times the week that
Koklich reported his wife missing. She and the housekeeper discovered
that a bedsheet, towel, doormat and pillow were missing, Carpenter
said. She said Koklich told her he believed his wife had been
abducted by a carjacker Monday morning.</TE>
<TE>   "After these items were missing, I thought she was abducted from
the house," Carpenter said.</TE>
<TE>   She said she did not know of any problems in her daughter's
marriage. Paul Carpenter, however, told authorities he believed that
his daughter wanted to divorce her husband but that Koklich did not
want to split the assets.</TE>

<HD>Mine Firm Takes Santa Clarita to Court</HD>
<DH>Resources: Suit accuses the city of withholding financial
data on its fight against gravel project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A company that plans to dig a massive sand and gravel mine in Soledad
Canyon filed a lawsuit Thursday that accuses Santa Clarita of
withholding financial information in its fight against the project.</LD>
<LD>   The city has spent $1.5 million in legal, public relations and
administrative costs to block the mine, city spokesman Jason Smisko
said.</LD>
<LD>   But Mexico-based Cemex, parent company of mine operator Transit
Mixed Concrete, contends that the figure is much higher, although its
suit does not specify a number.</LD>
<TE>   The suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, alleges that the
city has turned over only some of the public records documenting its
spending, and the legal action seeks the release of more.</TE>
<TE>   "The public has the right to know how much they're spending on
this," Cemex spokesman Brian Mastin said.</TE>
<TE>   Smisko said the city has released every document it is required to
by law. "They're just trying to harass us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The mine would extract 78 million tons of gravel and sand from
federal lands just east of Santa Clarita. It has been approved by the
federal government, but still requires a mining permit from the
county Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   The board is scheduled to consider the issue Feb. 26. Santa
Clarita officials and residents say the mine would damage the
environment and threaten endangered species. The city has paid to bus
hundreds of angry mine opponents to previous supervisors' meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Cemex denies that the mine would hurt the environment. Its suit
also seeks city documents about the endangered species, including the
unarmored threespine stickleback fish and the arroyo toad.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Santa Clarita sued the U.S. Department of the
Interior, claiming that the agency failed to protect the endangered
species. Another Cemex suit filed in U.S. District Court alleges that
county officials have delayed the project in violation of federal
law.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Supervisor Mike Antonovich, a leading foe, said
Friday that the lawsuit will probably force the board to postpone its
consideration of the mine.</TE>

<HD>Saddle Sore at Super Bowl: Naked Cowboy Hits New Orleans
Still in Arrears</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During his exhaustive research into Super Bowl activities in New
Orleans, Times sports columnist T.J. Simers casually mentioned that
he glimpsed the Naked Cowboy.</LD>
<LD>   But Simers, who is admittedly more interested in catching a
glimpse of actress and sports fan Salma Hayek, didn't furnish any
details.</LD>
<LD>   So we don't know whether the guitar-toting chap will be among
those performing during halftime ceremonies Sunday (I mean the Naked
Cowboy, not Simers).</LD>
<TE>   A street musician who wears nothing but jockey shorts, boots and a
hat, the cowpoke (a.k.a. John Burck of Cincinnati) played L.A. a few
years ago--at the prestigious venue known as the Venice Beach
boardwalk.</TE>
<TE>   During the visit, Burck sadly told how he had sought fame in
Hollywood fully clothed.</TE>
<TE>   "I was totally ignored," he said. "I made, like, $1."</TE>
<TE>   Off went (most of) the clothes, and he has since hitchhiked around
the country in the near-buff, playing on street corners, outside
sports stadiums and, occasionally, on daytime TV shows.</TE>
<TE>   The "Trail of Events" page on his nakedcowboy.com Web site lists
such career highlights as:</TE>
<TE>   "11-03-01, Times Square: Britney Spears stops and says, 'Hi, Naked
Cowboy!"' It doesn't get any better than that.</TE>
<TE>   Naked Cowboy (cont.): He's also hawking a line of products on his
site. I hate to say he's not living up to his name, but I find it
distressing that he, of all people, would be selling Naked Cowboy
T-shirts ($25 each).</TE>
<TE>   Don't party too hearty: Every year at this time I think of one
snapshot in my collection and wonder if it was intended as a subtle
reminder not to overeat and over-drink (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   And if you do have a hangover Monday ... : I'm not sure I'd try
any of the herbs found in a product by Gerald and Monica Klose (see

<TE>   The Raspberry foundation pays tribute to the worst performances in
the movies. And Carey is considered a shoo-in for a worst actress
nomination for her role in the flop "Glitter." The Razzie folks point
to research by the illustrious Rotten Tomatoes Web site, which found
that 56 out of 59 reviewers thought the movie was a bomb.</TE>

Mate Party" in honor of Valentine's Day. For $60, couples were
treated to a slide show about "animal mating habits" as well as a
docent-led tour of the zoo's "most successful" breeding partners.
Alas, attendance fell below expectations, so the show won't be staged
this year.</TE>
<TE>   I doubt that the gorillas will be disappointed.</TE>

<LD>Officials at St. Luke Medical Center in Pasadena say the hospital
will close Feb. 10, two months earlier than previously announced.</LD>
<LD>   When Tenet Healthcare revealed that it was closing St. Luke for
financial reasons, it said the hospital would be shut down April 3.
But after the hospital's anesthesiology group canceled its contract
with St. Luke last month, Tenet said, the health-care firm was forced
to move the closure up.</LD>
<LD>   At a county hearing Thursday night, a Pasadena fire official noted
that paramedics in the vicinity will have to travel farther to reach
a hospital. The city of Pasadena's Public Safety Committee will hear
a report Monday about the potential impact of the closure on medical
care in the community.</LD>

<HD>Film IndustryVeterans Swap Stories of Tinseltown's Past</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every six weeks, about 1,000 years of Hollywood history settles into
several tables at the Lamplighter Family Restaurant in Sherman Oaks.</LD>
<LD>   The occasion is a lunch and reunion for 20 or so picture, sound
and music editors, most now retired and in their 70s and 80s. On
Friday, 18 industry veterans showed up to celebrate the birthdays of
seven in their party, swapping stories of the Hollywood they saw as
they edited film, mixed sound and worked for decades behind the
scenes.</LD>
<LD>   "They go back a lot of years," said Bill Elias, a regular of the
group, whose members together have scores of Emmy and Oscar
nominations and several wins.</LD>
<TE>   At 63, Elias is one of the youngsters--and he's been in the
business for 53 years.</TE>
<TE>   Now a picture editor at Paramount, Elias was a 10-year-old extra
in Abbott and Costello's "Mexican Hayride." Elias' father had a
newsstand, and Costello was a friend. Such a good friend, Elias said,
that when his father needed $5,000 for an operation, "Lou Costello
put up the money to save my Dad's leg, so, of course, I'm a big fan."</TE>
<TE>   Eugene Marks, 79, has been both a sound editor and a music editor.
He edited the sound effects on two of James Dean's three pictures,
"Rebel Without a Cause" and "Giant."</TE>
<TE>   Marks recalled Dean's flying past him one morning in Coldwater
Canyon on the way to Warner Bros.</TE>
<TE>   "He came roaring by me in his black Porsche," Marks said. "Later
that day, he was looping some lines, and I said to him, kiddingly,
'You should drive a little more carefully. You almost drove me off
the road.' "</TE>
<TE>   Dean paused for a long moment and then said: "I should have killed
you."</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Sandler, 72, was a picture and sound editor on numerous
films, including "Can-Can." He remembers the day when Soviet Premier
Nikita Khrushchev visited the set and was flustered by the scantily
clad dancers, including Shirley MacLaine.</TE>
<TE>   "He came in on a Saturday--I'll never forget," Sandler said. "He
said, 'You should show people's faces, not their backsides'--that's
what Nikita said."</TE>
<TE>   Sandler also was present at 20th Century Fox when Michael Curtiz
was directing the John Wayne western "The Comancheros."</TE>
<TE>   An actor playing a grizzled cowboy had a bar scene in which he was
supposed to strike a match on his pant leg. The actor tried two or
three times, without success. Then, as a gag, he pulled his lighter
out of his pocket.</TE>
<TE>   "Curtiz didn't get the joke, and he started cursing him in
Hungarian."</TE>
<TE>   Neil Burrow likes to come to the gatherings with his father,
Milton Burrow, 80, a sound man whose own credits include "All the
President's Men."</TE>
<TE>   The younger Burrow is 49. He also was a sound editor, who got his
job in true Hollywood fashion, he said, "by sheer nepotism. Not a
talented bone in my body."</TE>
<TE>   Now retired like his dad, the younger Burrow collects Hollywood
memorabilia of the 1930s and '40s. He was only a youngster when he
began going to the studios with his father, "and so I saw the tail
end of the old studio system," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As for the white-haired encyclopedias gathered at the Lamplighter,
he said, "They're living treasures of information."</TE>

<HD>Blame in UCI Fire Severity: No Sprinklers</HD>
<DH>Safety: Investigators say leaking, flammable benzene gas
set off the $3.5-million lab blaze in July and that automatic dousing
would have kept flames from spreading.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHIL WILLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An accidental buildup of flammable gas triggered the explosion and
fire that destroyed two UC Irvine chemistry labs last July in a
$3.5-million blaze that could have been less severe had the building
been fitted with automatic sprinklers, UCI officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The likely culprit was a clogged distillation device, which
allowed highly volatile benzene gas to escape and eventually explode
inside Reines Hall on July 23, according to an outside investigative
team hired by the university. The findings were released Friday.</LD>
<LD>   A graduate student working in the lab suffered second-degree burns
on his face, arm and leg, but recovered and received his doctoral
degree in November.</LD>
<TE>   While investigators commended the university's response to the
fire and found that the research building met state codes, they
concluded that the blaze spread quickly because there was no fire
sprinkler system.</TE>
<TE>   About two-thirds of the buildings on the UCI campus lack the
sprinklers, including a child-care center and two dormitories.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the opinion of the investigation team that automatic
sprinklers would have been beneficial in controlling the fire," the
report stated. "Sprinklers would have activated soon after the fire
began, controlling the fire's growth and subsequently limiting fire
damage."</TE>
<TE>   The university's environmental health staff is conducting a second
investigation to assess the fire safety features in all UCI
buildings, including fire extinguishers, smoke detectors, exit plans
and sprinklers, UCI spokesman Tom Vasich said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "You can always do better, and this really gives us an opportunity
to find ways to make sure our labs are safe," Vasich said.</TE>
<TE>   Vasich said the university also hopes to replace 30 chemical
distillation devices similar to the one in the explosion. Newly
developed distillation systems do not require that flammable
chemicals be heated, which makes them safer. They cost about $5,500
each.</TE>
<TE>   UCI chemistry professor William Evans, whose lab was destroyed,
said he already had replaced four of the five most heavily used
distillation systems before the fire.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the older systems are in use at UC Irvine and in labs
across the country, mostly without incident, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a freak accident that happened to reliable equipment and
a reliable operator," Evans said. "We've used that equipment for 10
years, and the student has used that equipment for four years."</TE>
<TE>   University of California spokesman Chuck McFadden said the old
distillation devices on campuses are slowly being replaced as funding
allows.</TE>
<TE>   "Generally, those units have been fine. We haven't had a whole
series of problems with them," McFadden said. "They are upgrading
them as the opportunity and the budget present themselves."</TE>
<TE>   The UCI fire probe was led by Ken Groves of Sevorg Services, an
accident-investigation firm in Rutheron, N.M.</TE>
<TE>   The report determined that a buildup of pressure occurred when
graduate student Cy Fujimoto was purifying benzene.</TE>
<TE>   The escaping benzene exploded when it was ignited by a still
undetermined source. Fujimoto's injuries might have been less severe
had he worn a protective lab coat and gloves, as required, the report
concluded.</TE>
<TE>   According to the report, the fire-resistant design of the
building--from the noncombustible material to thick fire
walls--helped contain the blaze to two laboratories.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after the lab fire, UCI officials said sprinklers could prove
undesirable in a building with so many chemicals that are highly
reactive to water and could help fuel a blaze.</TE>
<TE>   Groves' report dismisses that argument, however, noting that
sprinklers can prevent flames from reaching any kind of chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   "The investigation team argues that the presence of hazardous
materials, including reactive and flammable materials, makes the
installation of automatic sprinklers in these facilities that much
more important," the report concluded.</TE>
<TE>   It hasn't been decided yet whether Reines Hall will be retrofitted
with sprinklers.</TE>
<TE>   The building opened in 1990 but was constructed under 1979
building codes, in place when the building design was approved.
Orange County's building codes required sprinklers, but UC Irvine is
owned by the state and fell under its codes, which did not require
sprinklers at that time.</TE>
<TE>   In the report, investigators noted that the California Building
Code now requires sprinklers in all new buildings with hazardous
materials.</TE>

<HD>SCR's Fund-Raising Is a Hit</HD>
<DH>Arts: Theater's national reputation has played well with
donors. Goal is now set at $50 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>South Coast Repertory's campaign to raise $40 million is 18 months
ahead of schedule, so leaders of the Costa Mesa theater announced
Friday that they are upping the ante to $50 million.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly $38 million has been raised since mid-1998, when South
Coast began a five-year drive to build a 336-seat theater, renovate
the two existing auditoriums and boost its endowment so it could
launch an annual series of plays aimed at family audiences.</LD>
<LD>   David Emmes, the theater's producing artistic director, said
Friday that with momentum strong and interest among prospective
donors still high, South Coast will try to raise an additional $10
million by mid-2003. The extra money would enrich the theater's
endowment, help commission new plays, enhance the size and quality of
productions, and extend educational programs.</LD>
<TE>   Since the campaign began, South Coast's status as a birthplace for
important new works has been certified by back-to-back Pulitzer
Prizes in 1999 and 2000 for plays commissioned and first produced at
the theater: Margaret Edson's "Wit" and Donald Margulies' "Dinner
With Friends." Productions of both recently appeared on HBO.</TE>
<TE>   Such credentials have played well with donors and boosted the
funding campaign's success, Emmes said. "That's been very helpful in
reinforcing that SCR has a national reputation and that we are
playing a leadership role in the American theater."</TE>
<TE>   Raising an additional $10 million will help South Coast remain at
the forefront, Emmes said. SCR would use some of the money to create
a fund that would enable it to continue developing plays, at least
matching the current commission budget of $200,000 a year, with
playwrights getting $10,000 to $25,000 per script, depending on their
experience and stature.</TE>
<TE>   Part would be allocated toward staging shows with large casts and
complex sets, at a time when the trend among nonprofit theaters is
toward smaller and less expensive productions.</TE>
<TE>   South Coast officials announced that they were raising the bar on
fund-raising during a ceremony Friday in which the uppermost steel
beam was placed on the three-story addition, which will house the
Julianne Argyros Stage. It is scheduled to open in October.</TE>

<HD>Youth Playing With Rifle Is Shot to Death</HD>
<DH>Accident: Victim's teenage companion told a neighbor that
he thought the weapon was unloaded.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 15-year-old Whittier youth was shot and killed Friday at the house
of a 14-year-old friend when a rifle the two of them were playing
with went off, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The 15-year-old was pronounced dead shortly after 2:30 p.m.
Whittier police said the shooting was accidental.</LD>
<LD>   Helen Gomez, a neighbor, said she heard a loud sound and the
screams of children about 2:15 p.m. In front of the house, she came
upon the 14-year-old, covered with blood and yelling for someone to
call 911. Inside, Gomez found the other boy's body. She didn't see
anyone else in the home.</LD>
<TE>   "He said, 'We thought there were no bullets,'" Gomez said.</TE>
<TE>   Police Lt. Bill Webster said the boys had found the rifle in the
house, but investigators were still trying to determine its owner and
where it had been stored. The 14-year-old has been interviewed by
detectives, Webster said.</TE>
<TE>   Police declined to identify either boy, and would not say whether
adults were in the home when the shooting occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said the 14-year-old's parents are conscientious and
work long hours. Gomez said they had warned their children not to
have friends in the house when they weren't home.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors and friends said the house is frequented by young people
for after-school basketball and other games.</TE>
<TE>   "My son used to play with their kids, a lot of kids did," said
Shera Cordova, a neighbor, who added that she had not been aware of
any gun in the home. "This is a horrible thing."</TE>
<TE>   Shane O'Brien, 13, said he had been best friends with the victim
since they were in elementary school. His friend, Shane said, loved
inline skating so much that he talked about finding a way to do it
professionally. "He didn't deserve this," said Shane. "I hope he's
doing well wherever he is."</TE>
<TE>   Kory Fivecoat, another neighbor, brought his 6-year-old boy to the
site of the shooting, joining a loose gathering of friends.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a gun owner, and I wanted to bring him here to teach him a
lesson -- my wife insisted on it," said Fivecoat, 26. "I want my boy
to know how dangerous it is to play with guns."</TE>

<LD>Katrina Eva Sarkissian, who allegedly stabbed a popular 15-year-old
girl to death at a Westside party in November, killed herself the
next day by taking a large dose of antidepressant tablets, the Los
Angeles coroner's office has concluded.</LD>
<LD>   Deanna Maran, a sophomore honors student, attempted to stop
Sarkissian's younger half-sister from damaging items in the backyard.</LD>
<LD>   The chastised girl called Sarkissian to complain. When Sarkissian,
17, arrived, another girl pinned Maran to the ground at the front of
a Thayer Avenue house.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities said Sarkissian pummeled Maran and then stabbed her.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, Sarkissian was called in for questioning by police,
but she collapsed, stopped breathing and died 3 1/2 hours later.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>About 300 people showed up this week to air suggestions and concerns
on removal of the Matilija Dam, north of Ojai.</LD>
<LD>   While nearly everyone seemed to favor the dam's demise, the 20
speakers at the meeting Thursday in Ventura raised questions over
safety, the environment and the cost of the project.</LD>
<LD>   The reservoir created by the dam holds only about 1.3 million
gallons--5% of its original capacity--primarily because of sediment
trapped behind the dam.</LD>
<TE>   There are several options for removing the dam. One includes
taking chunks from the top of the dam and allowing the sediment to
gradually wash downstream. Another is to scoop the sediment from
behind the dam and dump it elsewhere.</TE>

<HD>Worker Accused of Fraud</HD>
<DH>Insurance: Santa Paula man denies charges that he collected
disability payments while holding another job.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County prosecutors have filed perjury and fraud charges
against a Santa Paula construction worker who allegedly pocketed
$15,000 in disability benefits while secretly holding down a second
job.</LD>
<LD>   Aureliano Cordero, 32, is charged with six counts of workers'
compensation insurance fraud and one count of perjury. He pleaded not
guilty during an arraignment Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Cordero was arrested earlier this week after a joint investigation
by the Ventura County district attorney's office and the fraud
division of the California Department of Insurance.</LD>
<TE>   According to prosecutors, Cordero began working for Wild Wood
Structures, a Santa Paula-based commercial roofing and framing
company, in October 1999.</TE>
<TE>   A month later, he reported a job-related injury and filed a
workers' compensation claim. Cordero reported that he had been struck
in the arm by metal bands used to tie lumber together at the
construction yard, authorities said. And he told doctors the injury
prevented him from working because of chronic pain and weakness in
his arm and shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of the complaints, authorities said, Cordero was
declared temporarily disabled and collected more than $15,000 in
disability and medical payments over the course of 14 months.</TE>
<TE>   But according to prosecutors, Cordero secretly worked for seven
months washing cars at a Santa Paula auto dealership while collecting
the disability checks. He later testified at a June 2001 deposition
that he had not worked since the original injury, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Cordero, also known as Marcos Cordero and Aureliano Cordero
Rodriguez, could face five years in state prison and $50,000 in fines
if convicted. A preliminary hearing is set for Feb. 11.</TE>

<HD>Murdock Returns to the Arena</HD>
<DH>Politics: The billionaire's hefty contributions to local
GOP candidates have raised concerns. But the Dole CEO insists he has
no ulterior motives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The last time billionaire David Murdock got involved in local
politics, it ignited a grand jury probe of his closest ally on the
Ventura County Board of Supervisors and helped end her political
career.</LD>
<LD>   After lying low for a decade, the 78-year-old Dole Food Co. chief
and Republican financier is back on the scene. He is motivated, he
says, because he recently moved from Los Angeles County to a home
near Thousand Oaks.</LD>
<LD>   Murdock, the developer of the exclusive Lake Sherwood community,
has poured more than $128,000 into the campaigns of two candidates in
the March 5 supervisorial race, prompting opponents to call for
contribution limits.</LD>
<TE>   Murdock has given $91,000 to entrepreneur Randy Hoffman, a
candidate for an open seat representing the Conejo Valley, and
$27,500 to the reelection campaign of Supervisor Judy Mikels, whose
district includes Simi Valley, Moorpark and Somis.</TE>
<TE>   He has also contributed $5,000 each to Sheriff Bob Brooks, who
faces no opposition, and Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. Greg Totten, who
is locked in a tight contest to succeed his retiring boss. At the
state level, Murdock has given $100,000 to Republican gubernatorial
candidate Richard Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   But it's his involvement in county politics that has raised the
most eyebrows, with detractors wondering what is motivating the
billionaire developer to enter the political fray again.</TE>
<TE>   At an invitation-only fund-raiser for Mikels this week at his
gated Sherwood Country Club, Murdock took the podium and addressed
the issue head-on.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's been asking me ... why have I been involving myself?"
he said. "There isn't really anything I want, except I want a good
business climate.</TE>
<TE>   "I am a devout, middle-of-the-road Republican," Murdock added. "I
thought we were getting more liberal and more liberal and more
liberal all the time."</TE>
<TE>   He said he has watched in frustration over the years as businesses
that should have opened in Ventura County chose Orange County instead
because of the bureaucratic hurdles they faced.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people think private enterprise has no right to say anything
to government. I believe everyone in this room ought to be able to do
whatever they want to do as long as they aren't hurting anyone," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Murdock said he had hoped to move Dole headquarters to Ventura
County in 1992, but was confronted with so many obstacles that he
settled on a site a few miles away in Westlake Village, which is in
Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with The Times on Thursday, Murdock said he is
building a hotel and spa in western Los Angeles County and has
projects in the works throughout California. That includes the
Bakersfield area, where state records show he has contributed to the
campaigns of incumbent county supervisors and several Republican
candidates for state Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   But he denied that he had any development plans in Ventura County
beyond the remainder of the 630 homes planned at Sherwood. Murdock
was also quick to point out that he relocated 1,400 oak trees at
Sherwood at great expense so as to minimize damage.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm an environmentalist," he said. "I'm a perfectionist."</TE>
<TE>   Murdock said that Dole's farmland in the county would remain
agricultural. He said he long ago dropped any plans to move the
company's produce through the Port of Hueneme. He recently signed a
deal to ship through San Diego rather than Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no ulterior motive," he said of his involvement in local
politics.</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks Councilwoman Linda Parks, Hoffman's opponent in the
supervisorial race, balks at Murdock's assurances. "I don't believe
it," she said. "Not for a second."</TE>
<TE>   Mikels' opponent, John Lane, a fraud investigator for the Los
Angeles city attorney's office, echoed Parks' comments. "I don't
think the average voter is that naive, not to think there's a quid
pro quo [involved in large donations to political candidates]," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman and Mikels said their opponents are pandering to an
audience that would like to stop all growth.</TE>
<TE>   Murdock's connections to the county date to the early 1980s, when
he bought 1,900 acres around Lake Sherwood and set about filling the
lake, which had become a mud flat. He envisioned an enclave for the
super rich near his existing Arabian horse farm and weekend estate in
Hidden Valley, and by 1987 he had county leaders on board.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, he hit a few snags involving permitting and
maintenance of the lake. Then-Supervisor Madge Schaefer became
Murdock's close ally during these years, functioning as the county's
emissary on the Sherwood project.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, Murdock hosted a fund-raiser for her at his horse ranch,
donating a pony that drew $4,000 at auction.</TE>
<TE>   The following year, with some permits still pending on the
Sherwood project, Murdock threw a barbecue at the ranch, inviting
Schaefer and top planning and public works officials to thank them
for their help.</TE>
<TE>   A grand jury was convened to investigate impropriety. In mid-1990,
Schaefer and other county officials were cleared of any wrongdoing
but the grand jury recommended creation of an ethics panel to
establish a code of conduct.</TE>
<TE>   But the investigation made Schaefer increasingly vulnerable. She
lost the election that year to 25-year-old slow-growth advocate Maria
VanderKolk.</TE>
<TE>   Growth remains a central theme in the current election. Parks, who
campaigned for countywide growth controls, is among the county's most
prominent anti-sprawl advocates, while Hoffman, a millionaire
businessman, has been careful to describe himself as a slow-growth
candidate as well.</TE>
<TE>   He officially opposes the 3,050-home Ahmanson Ranch development at
the county's eastern edge. The project was approved in 1991 but has
been stalled by a slew of lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman praises Murdock's Sherwood development as an asset to the
community, however, and said he also admires Murdock's status as
chief of a company the size of Dole Foods.</TE>
<TE>   Mikels said she has known Murdock for a couple of years, but has
only once directly intervened on his behalf. At the time, she said,
he was having technical problems with county officials over his horse
ranch.</TE>
<TE>   He wanted a lower horse-to-worker ratio than county regulations
allowed. She felt his request was reasonable and helped get his
problems ironed out, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "He likes my style," Mikels said. "I'm a Republican, obviously
conservative, and what he told me is, now he's going to take an
interest in local government because he lives here and this is his
government."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Murdock is somewhat amused by the interest generated by
his reemergence on the local political scene. The international
businessman, who is not yet registered to vote in Ventura County,
seemed eager to put his critics at ease about his influence.</TE>
<TE>   "In case someone thinks I want to run Ventura County," he said, "I
have no interest whatsoever."</TE>

and more liberal all the time."</CP>

<HD>Killer Overdosed, Coroner Says</HD>
<DH>Autopsy: Authorities say Katrina Sarkissian took a large
amount of antidepressant pills after stabbing a girl to death at a
Westside party.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTHA GROVES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Katrina Sarkissian, who stabbed a popular 15-year-old girl to death
at a Westside party in November, killed herself the next day by
taking a large dose of antidepressant tablets, the Los Angeles
coroner's office has concluded.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling, released Friday, settles only one of many questions
lingering in the aftermath of an unchaperoned Saturday night teen
party that went wildly awry.</LD>
<LD>   Police say many of the circumstances are not in dispute: About 30
teenagers gathered Nov. 17 at a home in an upscale Westside
neighborhood.</LD>
<TE>   Deanna Maran, a sophomore honors student who was on Santa Monica
High School's volleyball, water polo and track teams, attempted to
stop Sarkissian's younger half-sister from damaging items in the
backyard.</TE>
<TE>   The chastised girl called Sarkissian to complain. When Sarkissian,
17, arrived about 10:30 p.m., another girl pinned Maran to the ground
at the front of the Thayer Avenue house.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Sarkissian pummeled Maran and then stabbed her,
possibly with a T-shaped "punch" knife in which the blade pops out
between the user's fingers. No weapon was ever recovered.</TE>
<TE>   According to other party-goers, Maran pleaded for Sarkissian to
stop hitting her, to no avail. Several teenagers loaded the bleeding
Maran into a car and drove her to Santa Monica Hospital, where she
was pronounced dead.</TE>
<TE>   The next afternoon, Sarkissian, who sported a tattoo reading
"Princess" on her lower back, was called in for questioning by Los
Angeles police. But she collapsed and stopped breathing. She died 3
1/2 hours later at UCLA Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   Some teens speculated that she had swallowed some sleeping pills
to calm her nerves before being questioned by police.</TE>
<TE>   But the autopsy report leaves no doubt that Sarkissian was intent
on suicide. According to a test of a blood sample taken at the
hospital, she had an extraordinarily high concentration of
nortriptyline and died of "acute nortriptyline intoxication." The
coroner's office concluded that she might have taken as many as 43
75-mg pills.</TE>
<TE>   Nortriptyline is often prescribed to treat depression under the
brand names Pamelor and Aventyl.</TE>
<TE>   The coroner's office also released its autopsy report on Maran,
confirming that she died of a stab wound. The report showed that she
had consumed some alcohol that night.</TE>
<TE>   Still to be determined is whether Sarkissian's 15-year-old
half-sister or anyone else will face charges.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to figure out what can we prove and what should we
do," said Alex Karkanen, a deputy district attorney in the Inglewood
Juvenile Office, which is investigating. "No matter what we do,
someone's going to go ballistic."</TE>
<TE>   Noting that this case is "right up there on the top of the
difficulty scale," he said that the office is taking its time.</TE>
<TE>   Police Det. Ron Phillips, supervisor of the homicide unit in West
Los Angeles, said investigators are also looking into the possibility
that another teenage girl played a part.</TE>
<TE>   Family members of those involved said they remain perplexed by the
event.</TE>
<TE>   Guilt and remorse continue to plague many of the students who
stood by, as well as those directly involved.</TE>
<TE>   "All I care about now is my daughter's sanity," said Matthew
Bernstein, the father of Katrina's half-sister.</TE>

<HD>Concerns Are Raised Over Removal of Dam</HD>
<DH>Environment: Most at meeting favor taking down Matilija
Creek structure, but safety and cost issues are cited.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN F. SHERRY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About 300 people showed up this week to air suggestions and concerns
on removal of the Matilija Dam, north of Ojai.</LD>
<LD>   While nearly everyone seemed to favor the dam's demise, the 20
speakers at the meeting Thursday evening in Ventura raised questions
over safety, the environment and the multimillion-dollar cost of the
project. The meeting was hosted by the Army Corps of Engineers and
the Ventura County Flood Control District.</LD>
<LD>   The reservoir created by the dam holds only about 1.3 million
gallons--5% of its original capacity--primarily because an estimated
6 million cubic yards of sediment are trapped behind the dam.</LD>
<TE>   That sediment contains everything from silt and sand to clay and
boulders.</TE>
<TE>   The concrete dam is an imposing structure at 168 feet high and 620
wide. There are several options for removing it. One includes taking
chunks from the top of the dam and allowing the sediment to gradually
wash downstream over an extended period. Another option is to scoop
all the sediment out from behind the dam and dump it elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Most officials believe that if the dam had not been built 55 years
ago on the north fork of Matilija Creek, about 16 miles from the
ocean, much of the trapped material would have naturally washed
downstream, and replenished Ventura's beaches.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it would be a definite opportunity for us to help restore
some of the sediment along the coastline," said Richard Handley, a
member of the Surfrider Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The project could take from two to 25 years to complete, depending
on which removal option is used, and cost $20 million to $200
million, said James Hutchison of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.</TE>
<TE>   Removal of the dam also would benefit species such as steelhead
trout, which cannot bypass the structure to spawn upstream. County
Supervisor John Flynn recalled that the fish were plentiful in his
childhood.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd walk by the water and there would be steelhead by the
hundreds, it would seem, going upstream," Flynn said.</TE>
<TE>   "The beneficiaries of this project will be our children and
grandchildren."</TE>
<TE>   Some speakers feared that allowing extra silt from behind the dam
to flow freely could cloud the water and harm the steelhead. Others
just hoped to return the environment to the way it was before the dam
was built.</TE>
<TE>   "We're concerned with water and sand," said Kevin Ready, executive
director of Beacan, an agency that represents five coastal cities,
and Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. "There's got to be a good way
to make use of both of them."</TE>
<TE>   Other species as well could benefit from the restoration of the
river's ecosystem. Besides steelhead, officials have identified 27
species within the Ventura River watershed that are threatened to
some degree, including two-striped garter snakes, California
red-legged frogs and southwestern pond turtles.</TE>
<TE>   Although some speakers said they looked forward to the additional
fishing and swimming opportunities removal of the dam would create,
some residents feared crowds.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't look forward to the day when thousands of fishermen come
to Matilija Canyon and trespass on my land," landowner Morgan
Alexander said.</TE>
<TE>   The final environmental impact report on the project is not due
until fall 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The study to determine the best option for the dam's removal will
cost about $4.2 million, with half paid by county taxpayers. Some
residents balked at the price tag for the study and removal.</TE>
<TE>   Other speakers were concerned that care be taken if dam removal
uncovers toxic substances or Native American artifacts.</TE>
<TE>   Still, most seemed to look forward to free-flowing waters. "The
dam coming down is a good thing," said Julie Tumamait Stenslie of the
Chumash nation. "I believe it brings our world back into balance."</TE>

<LD>I don't know about you, but I'm feeling this NHL All-Star week.</LD>
<LD>   OK, how many of you were even aware the NHL's best were in town
this week?</LD>
<LD>   Apparently none of my friends, judging by the number of times I've
had the following conversation this week:</LD>
<TE>   "You going to the Super Bowl?"</TE>
<TE>   "No. I'm covering the NHL All-Star game."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh. Yeah. Right. That."</TE>
<TE>   Well, the week already has featured everything you could want in
an event like this: superstars, nostalgia and drama.</TE>
<TE>   And they haven't even played the main game yet.</TE>
<TE>   To tell you the truth, the game isn't even my favorite part. It's
the SuperSkills Competition.</TE>
<TE>   (Or, as Tim Hardaway would call it, the "SuperSkeeeeels
Competition.")</TE>
<TE>   As for the All-Star game itself, I'd put the NHL third on my list
of the pro sports gala events. My favorite is the NBA, because you're
very likely to see what you want to see (i.e. a Kobe Bryant dunk or
Allen Iverson crossover).</TE>
<TE>   Second is baseball, because when you do see what you want, it's
memorable. The problem with the NHL All-Star game and the Pro Bowl is
that these are sports that market hitting and violence, and in these
games there's none. The NFL gets additional points subtracted because
the players care more about hanging out in Hawaii than playing the
game itself.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday the NHL SuperSkills competition provided plenty of
excitement, as it usually does. It's the perfect showcase for the
best in the world at what they do, with competition mixed in.</TE>
<TE>   The anchor leg of the three-man puck control relay put Teemu
Selanne vs. Joe Sakic. Sakic had a one-zone head start on Selanne,
but Selanne caught up as he zigzagged through the pylons and barely
nipped Sakic at the finish line.</TE>
<TE>   You had Sergei Fedorov firing the puck into the net at 101.5 mph.</TE>
<TE>   You had goaltender Dominik Hasek turning away Mario Lemieux, Paul
Kariya and Brendan Shanahan on a three-on-none.</TE>
<TE>   There was Jarome Iginla, his legs shaking from his first time
being on the ice with the same stars and participating in the same
competition that he used to watch as a youngster, drilling four
targets in six tries in the shooting accuracy competition. The guys
feeding him pucks: Lemieux and Kariya.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't beat that, can you?" an excited Iginla said.</TE>
<TE>   It all came down to the final event, mano a mano, with Hasek
skating out to challenge shooters, flipping, flopping and doing
everything to stop breakaways by Rob Blake, Chris Chelios, Mark
Parrish, Joe Thornton and Sakic. He gave up only one goal to the
sublime Lemieux, but his performance was enough to preserve an
overall 12-11 victory for the World team over the North Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Stars all around. Including Wayne Gretzky.</TE>
<TE>   Gretzky still has juice. He also has more responsibilities than
ever, doubling as the managing partner of the Phoenix Coyotes and
executive director of the Canadian Olympic team.</TE>
<TE>   He met with reporters Friday evening to talk Olympic shop and it
was a standing-room-only affair.</TE>
<TE>   To the Canadian media, it was the equivalent of a Donald Rumsfield
security briefing.</TE>
<TE>   They wanted to know about Team Canada's third goalie, about the
line combinations, about Lemieux's ability to play in back-to-back
games. Gretzky's handling this whole executive thing very well. He's
smooth, yet informative. In his new capacity he remains a perfect
ambassador for his sport.</TE>
<TE>   Staples Center might be Shaq's Shack, but Gretzky at least gets a
share of it for making the Kings worthy of a new building. The Kings
wouldn't mean a thing in this town if Gretzky didn't arrive in 1988.
The best news of the week was the announcement that his No. 99 will
be retired and hang in the building.</TE>
<TE>   He's more concerned about selling the Coyotes to the desert
dwellers now, but the sight of this town turning out for this week's
hockey festivities puts a smile on his face.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great sports city," he said of Los Angeles. "If you're
going to have a chance [for hockey] to succeed, you have to have a
great sports city--and this is."</TE>
<TE>   He liked the fact that the L.A. fans would get an up-close look at
the best players in the world this week. He liked the NHL FANtasy
setup and even took his kids there on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   (You want to talk fantasy? Try walking into the Kings' locker room
and seeing names such as Lemieux, Roenick and Iginla over the stalls.
Only on All-Star weekend.)</TE>
<TE>   Hey, the Stanley Cup's in town. Go down and see it now or take
your chances that the Kings will get ahold of it sometime before
you're buried. I have to admit, that thing has a magic pull to me. I
had to touch it when I was in the New York Rangers' victorious locker
room in 1994. And I coughed up the three bucks to take my picture
with it at the FANtasy on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The best part of the FANtasy at the Convention Center was the 1980
Olympic hockey team reunion Friday afternoon. Seeing them gathered
together, you could tell they have a special lifetime bond.</TE>
<TE>   I don't think a single sporting event will ever make so many
Americans feel so good as that team's gold-medal achievement.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it's too much to expect sports to provide an uplifting
national moment. It's possible, but it can't happen that easily.</TE>
<TE>   Entertainment and distraction? Sports can fill those roles no
problem. So far, the NHL's All-Star week is up to the task.</TE>

players who are making their debuts in the event, which will start at
noon at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   "It's almost mind-blowing," said New York Islander forward Mark
Parrish, a first-time All-Star. "I don't think I will realize how
much it is until the summer when I am sitting around with my buddies.
That's when I'll get a chance to say, 'Wow, that was fun, playing
with all of those great players.'"</LD>
<LD>   Toronto's Pat Quinn and Detroit's Scotty Bowman will coach against
each other today, just as they did 21 years ago when the NHL last
held an All-Star game in Los Angeles. Quinn will coach the North
American team, while Bowman will be behind the bench for the World
team.</LD>
<TE>   Detroit defenseman Chris Chelios, a late replacement for New
Jersey's Brian Rafalski on the North American team, will be making
his 11th All-Star game appearance, more than any other playing in
today's game.</TE>
<TE>   Playing in their 10th All-Star game, for the North American team,
are Pittsburgh's Mario Lemieux and Colorado's Joe Sakic and Patrick
Roy.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose winger Teemu Selanne heads the World team with his eighth
All-Star appearance. Washington's Jaromir Jagr has been voted to the
starting lineup for the 10th consecutive year but missed the 1994,
1997 and 2001 games because of injury.</TE>
<TE>   With the NHL scheduled to take a 12-day break later this month for
the Salt Lake Olympic Games and the Super Bowl being played Sunday,
today's All-Star game could have easily been lost in the shuffle.</TE>
<TE>   But that hasn't been the case. Friday night's Young Stars game and
Super Skills competition was a sellout, and the same is expected for
today's event.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's an obligation," Lemieux said about playing in
today's game. "It's not that hard of a game. ... Come here for a
couple of days, enjoy yourself, play the game and try to put a show
on for the fans.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't take a lot out of you. If the guys are healthy and are
feeling good, they should be here and be a part of it."</TE>
<TE>   Boston forward Joe Thornton is one of seven first-time All-Stars
playing on the North American team. You can tell by the smile he wore
Friday that today's game is something special.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my first one, and there was no way I was going to stay
back in Boston," Thornton said.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto's Mats Sundin added that making the most out of an
All-Star game is up to the individual. "This is my seventh time
playing in the game, and I still enjoy it," he said. "I think it's an
honor to be picked. The NHL is a big league with a lot of great
players."</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia forward Jeremy Roenick, who will be playing in his
seventh All-Star game for the North American team, created his own
fun Friday with a personal video camera. While Thornton talked to
reporters, Roenick interrupted the session by teasing his North
American All-Star teammate.</TE>
<TE>   Said Parrish: "It's great to see [veteran All-Stars] excited just
as much as the young guys, but the only difference is that they know
how to react to everything."</TE>
<TE>   With eight countries being represented in today's game and the
Olympics right around the corner, this year's All-Star weekend has
taken on a more international flair because of the World vs. North
American format, which has been used since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "This is really a showcase for the Olympics because a lot of the
questions we are getting are about the Olympics," Colorado defenseman
Rob Blake said. "I think it really just increases the hype."</TE>
<TE>   Or as St. Louis defenseman Chris Pronger, who will play on the
North American team today and for Canada in the Olympics, said:
"Being here is good because there's a lot of trash talking going on.
You know those Americans. They love trash talking."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>NHL All-Star weekend on Friday sounded a lot like Olympic hockey
media day.</LD>
<LD>   Players spent much of the time fielding questions about the
upcoming Olympics and were happy to answer.</LD>
<LD>   "Right now, just thinking about winning the gold medal for Canada
gives me chills," the Mighty Ducks' Paul Kariya said.</LD>
<TE>   Kariya has been fielding questions about the Olympics for more
than a year. Now, with the Games in sight, the fervor for Canada to
win its first gold medal in hockey since 1952 is evident to him.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time [the Ducks] have gone to a Canadian city, the talk
isn't about the game, it's all about the Olympics," said Kariya, who
missed the 1998 Games because of a concussion.</TE>
<TE>   "The game we were there for at the time was irrelevant. Everyone
wanted to talk about the Olympics, who you're going to skate with,
and what the competition will be like in the Games."</TE>
<TE>   Toronto Coach Pat Quinn, the North American team's coach for
today's All-Star game, has an explanation for the intense Canadian
interest: "We taught hockey to everybody in the world and it's still
our game," he said. "Now at the international level we have a chance
to claim that title back as the leader of hockey. It really belongs
to us anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Kariya expects tough hockey competition, not a Canadian
coronation, in Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not like the NBA, where the USA goes into the Olympics
and you know they are going to win," Kariya said. "There are a lot of
good teams out there."</TE>
<TE>   One top player who won't be in Salt Lake City is Colorado goalie
Patrick Roy, the NHL all-time leader in victories. He chose not to
play for Team Canada, preferring to focus on the Avalanche's season
and said there will be no regrets.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't have any second thoughts because I really thought about
my decision," Roy said. "I don't want to go back on that subject. I
have too much respect for the three guys there and wish them the
best."</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey's Martin Brodeur, Toronto's Curtis Joseph and Dallas'
Ed Belfour will be Canada's goalies.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kariya won the Mac Award, given to the NHL all-star who made the
most substantial commitment to children. A $25,000 donation to a
charity designated by the player comes with the award. Kariya donated
the money to the Ronald McDonald House in his hometown of Vancouver.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay goalie Nikolai Khabibulin, who will play for the World
Team, spent All-Star weekend in Southern California two years ago as
well. Unfortunately for him, the All-Star game was being played in
Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Khabibulin spent the 1999-2000 season playing for the Long Beach
Ice Dogs of the International Hockey League. He was immersed in a
two-year contract squabble with the Phoenix Coyotes, which led to a
trade that sent him to Tampa Bay in March of last season.</TE>
<TE>   Now, in his first full season back, Khabibulin was selected for
the All-Star game. "Considering the fact I haven't played a couple
years, it's a pretty good accomplishment," said Khabibulin, who
played in only two games for the Lightning last season. "I never had
any doubts about my ability to play. But maybe I'm better than I
thought I would be."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Jose's Teemu Selanne denies that there is friction between him
and Shark Coach Darryl Sutter. Reporters said there was a heated
exchange between the two after a game last month.</TE>
<TE>   Sutter, it was reported, said: "I don't care if you get into your
Porsche and drive back to Anaheim right now."</TE>
<TE>   To which Selanne reportedly replied: "The Porsche is in Finland."</TE>
<TE>   Selanne, a free agent after this season, claimed there is not a
problem.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a rumor that he was yelling at me," Selanne said.
"That's not true. I have no problem with the coach, I never have.
Darryl is a good guy and a good coach."</TE>
<TE>   Chris Foster</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In Friday night's YoungStars game, Atlanta's Ilya Kovalchuk had
seven goals in eight shots to lead a team coached by Barry Melrose to
a 13-7 victory over a team coached by Jim Fox.</TE>
<TE>   In the SuperSkills competition, Detroit goaltender Dominik Hasek
stopped Colorado's Joe Sakic in the final shot of the breakaway relay
round to give the World All-Stars a 12-11 victory over the North
American All-Stars.</TE>
<TE>   For the fourth year in a row, the Mighty Ducks' Paul Kariya won
the puck control race in a close battle over Chicago's Alexei
Zhamnov. Other event winners were Carolina's Sami Kapanen (fastest
skater), Detroit's Sergei Fedorov (hardest shot); Calgary's Jarome
Iginla and Vancouver's Markus Naslund (shooting accuracy), and
Colorado's Patrick Roy and Hasek (best goaltender).</TE>

<LD>The Angels have hired USC basketball announcer Rory Markas and former
Ohio State football and basketball announcer Terry Smith as their new
radio team. They replace Mario Impemba and Daron Sutton, who left to
take jobs with other teams.</LD>
<LD>   "Of all the things I have done in broadcasting," Markas said
Friday night, "this is the dream job."</LD>
<LD>   Markas was the Milwaukee Brewers' television announcer for three
seasons in the early 1990s, and was a fill-in on radio before that.
Smith was an announcer for the triple-A Columbus Clippers.</LD>
<TE>   Other finalists for the jobs, according to a source, were Fox's
Jose Mota, the son of Dodger coach Manny Mota, Milwaukee-based
announcer Len Kasper, former San Diego Padre announcer Mel Proctor
and ESPN's Gary Miller.</TE>

<LD>Jeffrey Loria doesn't have a signed agreement to buy the Florida

<LD>   In another unusual development in baseball's bizarre off-season,

and unanimously agreed that owners should vote in favor of a deal
that hasn't even been finalized.</LD>
<LD>   Henry, who heads the group that was given approval by major league
owners on Jan. 16 to buy the Boston Red Sox from the Jean R. Yawkey
Trust for $660 million, intends to sell the Marlins to Loria for
$158.5 million.</LD>

<LD>Pepperdine (14-6, 7-0) at Loyola Marymount (9-12, 2-5), 5, Fox Sports
Net 2, KXLU-FM (88.9), KPLS (830)--Loyola has lost seven consecutive
games to Pepperdine, including Wednesday's 84-59 West Coast
Conference blowout at Firestone Fieldhouse. Pepperdine has a
nine-game winning streak and is in first place in the WCC. Glen
McGowan had 17 points, Jimmy Miggins 15 and Boomer Brazzle 13 for
Pepperdine against Loyola.</LD>
<LD>   UC Irvine (15-6, 8-2) at Cal State Fullerton (4-15, 1-9), 7,
Channel 56, KUCI-FM (88.9)--Irvine guard Jerry Green is primed to
become the school's all-time leading scorer in a Big West Conference
matchup between the first-place Anteaters and last-place Fullerton.
Green had 20 points in a 72-64 victory over UC Riverside Thursday,
giving him 1,778 in his career, tying the record set by Tod Murphy in
1982-86. Fullerton forward Pape Sow scored 27 points in the Titans'
77-60 loss to Long Beach State Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Long Beach State (7-14, 3-7) at UC Riverside (6-12, 3-7), 7, KRLA

victory Thursday when the 49ers defeated Fullerton behind a
career-high 30-point performance from senior forward Travis Reed.
Riverside led Irvine by four points with 6:25 left, but the

<LD>Shelly Finkel, Mike Tyson's manager, has begun processing the
necessary paperwork to apply for a California boxing license for his
fighter. Finkel hopes to complete the application next week, get a
special hearing before the California Commission and gain the right
for the former two-time heavyweight champion to face Lennox Lewis at
Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   But even if all that happens, and even if Staples Center president
Tim Leiweke continues to bid for the fight despite heavy criticism,
it doesn't necessarily mean the bout will be held here.</LD>
<LD>   Although the Nevada State Athletic Commission boldly and wisely
denied Tyson a license Tuesday because of erratic behavior both
inside and outside the ring, four states have expressed an interest
in a Lewis-Tyson match, including California, according to Finkel.
The others are Texas, Michigan and Georgia.</LD>
<TE>   Finkel says he also has a "big offer" from a European country
which he declined to identify. He discounted expressions of interest
from promoters in Denmark and South Africa, saying those weren't
viable options.</TE>
<TE>   "There are lot of positives in connection with California," Finkel
said, "if they can license him and do it quickly. It's a great area
with a big and affluent population. I don't see any negatives."</TE>
<TE>   Finkel uses the word "quickly" because he knows that allegations
of two separate sexual assaults involving Tyson in his Las Vegas
house in the past four months could soon turn into formal charges.
And if that happens, the states showing an interest in Tyson might
finally be shamed into doing the right thing and following Nevada's
shining example.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, what will be the determining factor in deciding
which offer Finkel pursues?</TE>
<TE>   What is always the determining factor in boxing? Why do people
like Finkel and Leiweke continue to court and accommodate Tyson?
Money, of course.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from Las Vegas' MGM Grand, the original location of the
fight, had agreed to a $12-million site fee. That was only possible
because of the potential return through gaming activity.</TE>
<TE>   Without the high rollers in the mix, Finkel will be fortunate to
get half that amount.</TE>
<TE>   Let the bidding begin.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Integrity, Boxing  in the Same Sentence</TE>
<TE>   It's been a long time since we used those words together. But then
it's been a long time since a boxing commission showed the courage of
the Nevada group.</TE>
<TE>   A week ago, cynics were saying Tyson would get a rubber stamp from
the Nevada commissioners, that they would not dare stand in the way
of that Nevada juggernaut, the gaming industry.</TE>
<TE>   A city whose bright lights have been dimmed by the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks and the subsequent dropoff in tourism would not
stand for a "Not Welcome, Mike Tyson" sign going up at the city
limits.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong, wrong, wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Well prepared, articulate and, ultimately wise, the commission
turned Tyson down by a 4-1 vote.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very proud of them," said Marc Ratner, the commission's
executive director.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Unconscionable, Boxing  in the Same Sentence</TE>
<TE>   Dan Goossen, who once promoted Tyson, says that any state that
licenses the fighter could ruin it for everybody.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have 49 states making the right decision," Goossen said,
"and one going against them, it spoils the whole lot.</TE>
<TE>   "This goes way beyond Mike Tyson. If other commissions can't
respect the integrity of the Nevada commission, then we may have
pushed ourselves toward the establishment of a federal boxing
commission."</TE>
<TE>   Sounds good to me.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oh, and by the Way ...</TE>
<TE>   Tyson's menacing shadow has pushed into the background separate
fights tonight by two undisputed champions (HBO, 6:45 p.m.).</TE>
<TE>   In Reading, Pa., Bernard Hopkins (42-2-1, 29 knockouts) puts his
undisputed middleweight crown up against Carl Daniels (47-3-1, 30). A
victory for Hopkins would be his 15th consecutive defense of at least
a piece of the middleweight title, breaking the record of 14 by
Carlos Monzon.</TE>
<TE>   In Miami, Roy Jones Jr. (45-1, 36) will defend his undisputed
light-heavyweight championship against Glen Kelly (28-0-1, 15). Kelly
is a perfect Jones opponent. Few have ever heard of him.</TE>

<LD>Perseverance was the key to Mission Viejo's 64-58 South Coast League
victory over Capistrano Valley Friday in front of 2,100 at Mission
Viejo.</LD>
<LD>   That was especially true for Diablo forward Travis Niesen, who
missed seven short-range shots in the first half when his team fell
behind by as many as 10 points and trailed, 32-26, at the half.</LD>
<LD>   Niesen and Mission Viejo, No. 20 in The Times' rankings,
persisted, however. Niesen converted five of seven shots from the
field in the second half to help the Diablos (22-2, 9-0 in league)
secure their 15th consecutive victory.</LD>
<TE>   Mission Viejo grabbed its first lead, 36-35, midway through the
third quarter. Niesen's steal and left-handed slam dunk in the fourth
quarter thrilled the crowd and ignited a 22-12 Diablo run over the
last 51/2 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Jake Collins led Mission Viejo with 16 points and Niesen finished
with 15 points, seven rebounds, six assists and four steals. Matt
Sweany had 20 points and Pete DeCasas scored 10 fourth-quarter points
to finish with 19 for No. 21 Capistrano Valley (19-6, 6-2).</TE>
<TE>   "We are one brain cell short of being a really good team,"
Capistrano Valley Coach Brian Mulligan said. "I'm not saying the kids
aren't trying or aren't bright, we just seem to make weird decisions
late in games."</TE>

<TE>   In the Del Rey League:</TE>
<TE>   Torrance Bishop Montgomery 53, Gardena Serra 46--Gavin Lee scored
20 of his 23 points in the second half and had 12 rebounds as the
Knights gained a share of first place in the Del Rey League with the
victory at Serra.</TE>
<TE>   Frederick Washington scored all 12 of his points in the first half
for Bishop Montgomery (19-5, 6-1), which avenged an 82-78 loss on
Jan. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Eugene Jeter led No. 14 Serra (22-3, 6-1) with 13 points and Chris
Hemphill added 10 points and nine rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   The Cavaliers pulled to within 48-44 on a jumper by Jeffrey Arnold
with 1:09 left, but Samir Hernandez was called for an intentional
foul on the Knights' next possession. Lee made both free throws,
Bishop Montgomery kept the ball and scored to take a 52-44 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Washington's fast-break layup gave Bishop Montgomery a 23-17 lead
with two seconds remaining in the half.</TE>
<TE>   Serra scored the game's first basket but never led again. The
Cavaliers made only two of 10 field-goal attempts in the first
quarter and trailed, 14-5.</TE>

<TE>   Crescenta Valley 66, Pasadena Muir 63--Chris Tarne hit a
three-point basket with 15 seconds to play to give the Falcons (17-7,

Muir (20-4, 5-3).</TE>

<LD>Mitch Albom of the Detroit Free Press writes that New England's Drew
Bledsoe shouldn't feel too bad that he won't start at quarterback for
Sunday's Super Bowl game against St. Louis, giving way to Tom Brady.</LD>
<LD>   "What's the hurry to start against the Rams? They tend to
embarrass almost everyone they face. Their most common score is We
Win.</LD>
<LD>   "The Rams don't defeat people, they disappear on them. You think

<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Jeff McInnis looked and played upset during the Clippers' loss Monday
to the Memphis Grizzlies. Coach Alvin Gentry benched McInnis for the
closing minutes of the game, then overtime, further angering the
starting point guard.</LD>
<LD>   They talked the next day, however, and McInnis felt a heavy burden
lift from his shoulders. He scored a season-high 31 points in
Tuesday's victory over the Dallas Mavericks, then added 15 points and
nine assists in the Clippers' triumph Thursday over the San Antonio
Spurs.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm having more fun now," McInnis said. "One of my best friends
was charged with murder [in McInnis' hometown, Charlotte, N.C.] and I
was playing mad. We talked [he and Gentry] and I got a lot of stuff
out. I cried. It was good to get off my chest."</LD>
<TE>   McInnis describes himself as a fiery player. But his emotions
boiled over against Memphis. He ignored his defensive responsibility
at least twice to yell at the referees about missed calls. After the
talk, McInnis seemed calm, cool and collected against Dallas and San
Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   "I got 31 the other night against Dallas; I wasn't scoring, but I
just kept playing and I got 15 [against the Spurs]," he said. "I was
trying to do everything I could for my team. I feel we're playing
pretty good ball. We kind of shut them up [San Antonio's fans]. It
was fun."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Corey Maggette's status continues as day-to-day because of a
strained left knee. He did not practice Friday. Darius Miles is
expected to replace him at small forward tonight against the Atlanta
Hawks.... Elton Brand's high school jersey will be retired in a
ceremony Monday at Peekskill (N.Y.) High School.... Lamar Odom joined
his teammates in Atlanta after undergoing an examination Thursday on
his sprained right wrist in L.A. He is expected to be sidelined for
at least a month.</TE>

<TE>   Update--The Clippers have won two in succession on the road for
the first time since Feb. 21-22 of last season. The Hawks have lost
12 of 13, including 97-90 Friday to Michael Jordan and the Wizards at
Washington. Shareef Abdur-Rahim, who leads the Hawks with averages of
20 points and 9.6 rebounds, had 25 points in Friday's loss. The
Clippers handled the Hawks with ease Nov. 5 at Staples Center,
109-86. Quentin Richardson scored 20 points in that Clipper victory.</TE>

<HD>San Vicente May Provide Boost</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: With Kentucky Derby lacking a favorite,
prospects can draw inspiration from Silver Charm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This year, more than most years, the Kentucky Derby winner could come
from anywhere, which might be encouragement for the seven horses
running today in the San Vicente Stakes, even though some of them
appear to have distance limitations.</LD>
<LD>   The field for the seven-furlong San Vicente can take inspiration
from Silver Charm, who used a win in the Santa Anita stake in 1997 to
launch his 3-year-old season, a year marked by wins in the Derby and
the Preakness.</LD>
<LD>   This year comes with no pre-packaged favorites for the Derby.
Johannesburg and Repent, who ran 1-2 in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile,
haven't emerged as 3-year-olds and, in fact, Johannesburg, based in
Ireland, is no cinch to be at Churchill Downs on May 1. Siphonic,
third in the Breeders' Cup race, had a hard-luck defeat at Santa
Anita last month and needs to reassert himself, and Saarland, who won
at 11/8 miles after disappointing in the Breeders' Cup, is awaiting
the start of his Florida campaign.</LD>
<TE>   None of these horses is trained by Bob Baffert, Wayne Lukas or
Nick Zito, trainers who have won seven of the last 11 Derbies and
have started 42 Derby horses  during those years. Baffert is running
Popular, who's never been around two turns, in the San Vicente, and
he trains Danthebluegrassman, a double stakes winner at Golden Gate
Fields, but overall his prospects appear thin. Lukas and Zito have
been even less visible with their 3-year-olds. No one should be
betting against all three of them taking a holiday on the first
Saturday in May.</TE>
<TE>   Another prep race for Derby prospects today is the $150,000
Hutcheson at Gulfstream Park. Among the six contenders is trainer
Shug McGaughey's Maybry's Boy, a stablemate of Saarland and winner of
the Spectacular Bid Stakes at the Florida track on Jan.3.</TE>
<TE>   Because Came Home, running for the first time since a
seventh-place finish in the Breeders' Cup shattered his undefeated
record, and Werblin, unbeaten in two starts, are heavy favorites in
the San Vicente, Baffert may have to turn to the $400,000 Strub, the
richest race on the card, for a stakes win today. He's running Fancy
As and the longshot Pie N Burger in the Strub, which also has drawn
Mizzen Mast, the 2-1 morning-line favorite off two consecutive wins,
and Western Pride, who has won five of his last six starts.</TE>
<TE>   Baffert has won the Strub three of the last four years--with
Wooden Phone, General Challenge and Silver Charm--and with another
score could break the stakes record shared by Charlie Whittingham,
Laz Barrera and Bill Molter.</TE>
<TE>   Corey Nakatani has been even hotter than Baffert in the Strub,
winning the last three with Baffert's pair and Event Of The Year.
Nakatani has had a tough meet, winning only three races through the
first 27 racing days, but his Strub mount, Momentum, is a serious
threat after running fifth as the favorite in the San Fernando.
Nakatani also rides Werblin in the San Vicente.</TE>
<TE>   The San Antonio Handicap  will be run Sunday. High weight in the
11/8-mile race, with 121 pounds, is Lido Palace, one of the best
older horses in the country last year. This is the post-position
lineup for the San Antonio, with jockeys and weights: Euchre, Garrett
Gomez, 119 pounds; Seinne, Chris McCarron, 113; Irisheyesareflying,
Kent Desormeaux, 117; Lido Palace, Jerry Bailey, 121; Straight Flush,
Nakatani, 115; Gander, Gary Stevens, 114; and Redattore, Alex Solis,
116.</TE>

Endangers our highways.</LD>
<LD>   It also holds particular sway over a group of rugged,
stick-wielding men who lace on skates and chase a galvanized rubber
slab across it for a living.</LD>
<LD>   NHL players may be more preoccupied by ice than anybody else.</LD>
<TE>   After all, it's on a bed of frozen water that they ply their
trade.</TE>
<TE>   But in this era of multipurpose arenas, where ice rinks might be
covered for a week or more while basketball games, concerts, tractor
pulls carry on above, the playing surfaces around the league are far
from uniform and in fact can vary greatly.</TE>
<TE>   In Staples Center, host of today's 52nd NHL All-Star game, the ice
sheet ranks somewhere near the middle of the NHL pack on its best
days and among the poorest in the league on its worst.</TE>
<TE>   In Edmonton, home of the league's most highly regarded playing
surface, gliding across the well-manicured ice is "like skating on
glass," says Joe Nieuwendyk of the Dallas Stars. Which is to say, a
good thing.</TE>
<TE>   In Florida, it's said to be like plowing through quicksand.</TE>
<TE>   And while Madison Square Garden may be the self-proclaimed
"world's most famous arena," its infamy around the NHL is due to its
rutty ice.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it's subjective."The biggest determination on ice
conditions is whether you win or lose," King Coach Andy Murray says.
"It's not very often that I'm unhappy with the ice when we win. But
when we lose, I've been known to say what's wrong with it."</TE>
<TE>   There's something to that, but obviously there's more to it.</TE>
<TE>   When the ice is smooth and hard, as it should be, it is capable of
producing hockey at its most appealing--fast-paced and skillful, full
of pinpoint passes and graceful, powerful skating.</TE>
<TE>   But when the surface is substandard, the play is often sloppy.</TE>
<TE>   Bad ice, the players say, is brittle. It's bumpy. Or it's slushy.</TE>
<TE>   "We call it soft ice," King center Bryan Smolinski says. "Your
skates sink into it. You feel very lethargic, not crisp. The puck
doesn't slide, it wobbles."</TE>
<TE>   Rough ice can make a demanding sport that much more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "The puck is not going to lay flat," Eric Lindros of the New York
Rangers said in a recent interview. "It's going to be bouncing around
all the time. The easy passes are not going to be easy passes.
They're going to be tough passes. Handling that thing is going to be
really difficult."</TE>
<TE>   Also difficult is understanding why the ice is not more uniform.</TE>
<TE>   "With all the money being put into new arenas now," Nieuwendyk
says, "I always wondered why other cities couldn't make ice like they
do in Edmonton."</TE>
<TE>   It's not for lack of trying.</TE>
<TE>   Edmonton's Skyreach Centre boasts built-in advantages over many of
the league's other arenas, among them the city's dry air,
mineral-rich water and lack of an NBA franchise, the latter giving it
ample time to properly groom the ice.</TE>
<TE>   Heat and humidity are natural enemies of smooth, hard ice, which
is why arenas in warmer climates such as Los Angeles and Florida are
at a disadvantage.</TE>
<TE>   Also at a disadvantage are arenas that rarely go dark.</TE>
<TE>   It's no accident that many of the arenas with the most highly
regarded ice sheets, among them Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, the
Pengrowth Saddledome in Calgary and the Xcel Energy Center in St.
Paul, Minn., are located in cold-weather climates and do not share
space with NBA teams.</TE>
<TE>   The frozen surface at General Motors Place in Vancouver, home of
the Canucks, reportedly is much improved since the NBA's Grizzlies
moved to Memphis this season.</TE>
<TE>   The one arena with a top-shelf ice surface and an NBA team is the
Pepsi Center in Denver, home of the Nuggets and Colorado Avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   The NHL recently began monitoring ice sheets around the league,
asking referees and players from both teams to rate the ice after
each game.</TE>
<TE>   A one-page questionnaire asks if the ice surface is "hard and
fast," "chippy" or "soft and sluggish," and asks for an overall
rating of ice conditions as poor, below average, average, good or
excellent.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that the ice quality is considered a problem," league
spokesman Frank Brown says. "It's our aim to make it as uniform as
possible so that the game, the players and the fans can benefit."</TE>
<TE>   The ice sheets are ranked from top to bottom each month based on
the information returned to the league. Seven teams, however, are not
fully participating in the survey, according to a recent league
memorandum.</TE>
<TE>   At Staples Center, where the ice ranked 28th in the NHL in the
league's November survey but improved to 16th in December, the key is
controlling as many variables as possible, said Lee Zeidman, the vice
president of building operations.</TE>
<TE>   Zeidman is only half-kidding when he says of the ice sheet in the
home of the Kings, Lakers and Clippers, "It's ranked No. 1 among
buildings that have two NBA franchises."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it's the only one.</TE>
<TE>   But all the activity at Staples, which hosts about 250 events a
year, means that regular ice grooming is a rarity, Zeidman said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're one of the few buildings that gets very few open days to
actually perform maintenance on the ice," he says. "I'd say during
the course of the season we may have maybe half a dozen days where
the ice is actually exposed for a complete day without anything going
on and allowing us to do maintenance."</TE>
<TE>   In Edmonton, the ice is exposed for six days in most weeks.</TE>
<TE>   For King games, Zeidman and his crew try to keep the humidity in
the building at about 40% and the air temperature between 62 and 66
degrees, about four to six degrees cooler than at Laker or Clipper
games.</TE>
<TE>   The temperature of the inch-thick ice sheet is 22-26 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   At the suggestion of Dan Craig, hired as the league's ice
technician after building his reputation in Edmonton, Staples Center
changed the water mixture in its ice this season to get a better
density.</TE>
<TE>   When the ice sheet was laid in September--it is removed each
spring after the Kings' season ends--tap water was mixed with
de-ionized water for the first time, adding minerals to the ice.</TE>
<TE>   "Adding minerals to the mix," Craig explains, "creates a better
density so that when the players are skating on it, it doesn't chip
away as easily."</TE>
<TE>   It has helped, but the ice sheet at the Kings' practice facility
in El Segundo is still superior to the one they skate on during
games.</TE>
<TE>   That's because it's housed in a much smaller building, making it
easier to control humidity and temperature.</TE>
<TE>   Craig has helped introduce other league-wide measures to improve
ice conditions. Pregame youth games that used to chew up the ice
before play are now banned. And during timeouts, workers clear the
puck-stopping snow accumulation around the nets and in front of the
benches.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, we can't control Mother Nature," he says, "so what we
have to try to do is work the building around what Mother Nature
gives us.</TE>
<TE>   "So, on a rainy day, you have to make sure that you close up your
building solid for as long as you can before the game [to keep the
moisture out] and try to dehumidify your building with the units you
have available to you."</TE>
<TE>   Craig is optimistic that, through hard work and education, the
NHL's ice sheets will one day be uniform.</TE>
<TE>   Others are more skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's realistic that a place as busy as Madison
Square Garden will ever have ice like they do in Edmonton," says Jack
Larson, vice president and general manager of the Xcel Energy Center,
home of the Minnesota Wild.</TE>
<TE>   Mathieu Schneider of the Kings is even more pessimistic.</TE>
<TE>   "The league is trying to come up with a formula," he says, "but
they haven't yet. You just have to get used to playing on bad ice."</TE>

<HD>Walker Says He Wants to Return</HD>

<DL>MEMPHIS, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>Samaki Walker, who signed a contract at less than his market value
last summer to play for the Lakers and Coach Phil Jackson, said he
intends to return next season.</LD>
<LD>   Walker's contract is for $1.4 million this season and $1.54
million, at his option, next season. He could become a free agent,
but said that was remote.</LD>
<LD>   "My main concern is to be a champion," he said. "The only way I'm
not here next year is if Phil decides not to be here. He's been the
best guy for my career. The confidence he's had in me, it's
confidence I didn't always have in myself.</LD>
<TE>   "This has been a rebirth. It's like my basketball life started all
over. It's all about learning. I always knew I had potential and now
I have a coach who understands that."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson appears set on serving the entirety of his Laker contract,
which contains two more seasons after this one, at least. He might
resign earlier if his troublesome hips and back worsen, but he is
healthy now.</TE>
<TE>   Having left San Antonio--at the Spurs' option--with a reputation
for being soft and playing below his potential, Walker has improved
steadily in his half-season with the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   He averaged 25.3 minutes, 7.2 points and seven rebounds through 43
games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal, the Western Conference's leading All-Star
vote-getter but playing on a very sore big toe, is not yet ready to
commit to the game. The Lakers play twice--at Dallas on Sunday and
against Chicago on Wednesday--before the All-Star game in
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   "If I can't do it, I won't," he said. "Fine money won't make me
change my decision. Fine money, to me, is tax. I'm not worried about
what the system says."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said recently he thinks O'Neal should attend the game and
play a few minutes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Phil Jackson's 700th coaching victory came in his 946th game, the
fastest ever to 700, according to Laker officials.</TE>
<TE>   "A very elite number," Jackson said. "It was probably more
important that I passed Red Holzman last week. That was symbolic for
me."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson played for Holzman as a New York Knick.</TE>

<DH>Pro basketball: Guard leads second-half rally from a
nine-point deficit as Lakers defeat Grizzlies, 100-85.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEMPHIS, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>It is the nature of the Lakers' business, which peddles two of the
most accomplished scorers in NBA history, that reserves who take
shots make them or be publicly and privately condemned.</LD>
<LD>   That led the Lakers on Friday night to Derek Fisher, currently at
a career juncture that finds him reconciling his scoring, as a point
guard, with his new role as a bench player, most recently while
looking at a nine-point deficit.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, they keep throwing new variables at Fisher, a determined
player who pushes regularly through surgeries and scouting reports
and a recent demotion.</LD>
<TE>   It landed him finally on a locker-room folding chair, his feet
floating in ice water, his teammates fairly pleased with a 100-85
victory against the Memphis Grizzlies at the Pyramid.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just getting back to going out and playing basketball,"
Fisher said, "and not being concerned with the change or when the
minutes are going to come."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers had lost in Memphis on Dec. 21 as part of a humiliating
run of failures against the league's last-place teams, and again they
trailed, 69-60, with a minute left in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Even without injured Michael Dickerson or Jason Williams, the
Grizzlies were game. They played pesky defense on Kobe Bryant (13
shots, 13 points) and weren't totally run over by Shaquille O'Neal
(26 points, 10 rebounds), which meant the Lakers required another
option or two. Now, that's not exactly how they refer to Fisher, Rick
Fox, Robert Horry and the others in team meetings, but close enough.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher made five of seven three-point attempts and scored 21
points, 11 in the third quarter. His threes drove the Lakers to an
11-0 run spanning the end of the third and beginning of the fourth,
and launched the 36-6 run that finished the Grizzlies and made Phil
Jackson the fastest NBA coach ever to 700 victories. Horry scored all
six of his points, on two three-point baskets, in the first 41/2
minutes of the fourth quarter, and Fox scored all of his 10
points--on four-of-four shooting--in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   As they did Wednesday in Orlando, the Lakers went from lethargic
to dynamic in the final 15 or so minutes, and it's beginning to save
their trip. They've won three in a row, are 3-1 since they left Los
Angeles a week ago, and have formidable Dallas, on Sunday, ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Along with O'Neal, unexplainably forgotten at times by the other
Lakers considering Bryant was swamped by defenders, this was a
victory for the other guys. They don't come often, not with O'Neal
and Bryant around.</TE>
<TE>   "That comes with the territory," Fox said of the reserve's
existence. "But, five or six of us get to ride this ship with Shaq
and Kobe. If that's the worst that happens, I'll take that."</TE>
<TE>   Fox laughed about the victories that most often are Shaq's, or
Kobe's, or both.</TE>
<TE>   "And when you lose," he said, "it's because those guys didn't do
anything."</TE>
<TE>   By the time the Lakers went from nine down (69-60) to 21 ahead
(96-75), Fox had made his point for the reserves and for himself.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the game, Fox believed he was fouled excessively by
Memphis point guard Brevin Knight. No foul was called.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'OK,'" Fox recalled, " 'it's a long game.'"</TE>
<TE>   Late in the second quarter, Fox aggressively fouled Knight and was
assessed a flagrant foul. Knight groused at Fox, who was as defiant.
Then Fox jawed with Grizzly assistant Scott Roth, at one point
shouting, "What, you want to fight me?"</TE>
<TE>   "He got a little sensitive," Fox said, smiling.</TE>
<TE>   Knight and Pau Gasol led the Grizzlies with 13 points each, the
same as Bryant, who had 13 in the first and fourth games against the
Grizzlies this season, 36 and 56 in the middle games.</TE>
<TE>   "They sent double-teams to Kobe all the time," Jackson said. "They
weren't going to allow him to beat them tonight. He moved the ball
ahead, particularly at the end of the third and the fourth quarter."</TE>
<TE>   That left Fisher for two three-point baskets in the final 36
seconds of the third quarter. The Lakers made 24 of 35 shots in the
second half, including eight of 10 three-point tries. Fox, Fisher and
Horry were 11 of 15 in the second half, seven of eight from behind
the arc.</TE>
<TE>   "Just come in and play basketball," Jackson said of Fisher, in
particular. "That's what it's about. Take your chances, your
opportunities, and make the most of it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a basketball team, and everybody has to do their job;
however they have to plug in, they do it."</TE>

<HD>Chick's Fans Show How to Play Strong Defense</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To Rick Cipes of L.A., who says it's time for Chickie to hang it up
[Viewpoint, Jan. 26], I say this: Chick Hearn on his worst day is
still so far better and more entertaining than anyone else at their
best that it isn't even worth discussing. The fridge is closed!</LD>
<LD>   Steve Smith</LD>
<LD>   San Gabriel</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I know that Chick makes his mistakes and even I get miffed, but
even on his worst day Chick is at the top of his class. I am an adept
golfer, but I am no Tiger Woods and Paul Sunderland is no Chick
Hearn.</TE>
<TE>   Chick is like a vintage car coming out of a restoration shop after
heart surgery, he should be roaring to go and good for many more
years. Love ya, Chickie.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Marikian</TE>
<TE>   Monrovia</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I am amazed at Chick Hearn's skill at 85 years old. To call a
basketball game the way he does with the rapid pace of the game is
beyond peers. Has he made some mistakes? Who hasn't?</TE>
<TE>   I have heard many younger announcers make errors, and most of them
are calling slower games like football and baseball. I still can
listen to Chick call a game on radio, close my eyes and see Kobe
dribbling from right to left, a bounce pass to Fox or a slammm dunk.
I am not ready to lose that just yet, so in my opinion, Rick, you are
alone!</TE>
<TE>   Chris Fisher</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bravo to the author of the letter suggesting that Chick Hearn
should retire.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever skills he once had at accurately and entertainingly
calling a basketball game have now been replaced with a consistent
comedy of errors, like calling Kobe "Byron." It is not that we don't
like Chick. He just doesn't have "it" anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Compare the quality of Chick's work to that of Vin Scully, still
among the best of the best in any sport. Vin doesn't rely on silly
colloquialisms such as "butter getting hard" or "Jell-O jiggling."</TE>
<TE>   Vin just calls the game. Chick should just call it quits.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Guss</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   How dare Rick Cipes suggest that Chick hang it up? If every Laker
were as prepared as Chick is for every game, the Lakers would have
several more championship banners hanging from the rafters.</TE>
<TE>   Stu Lantz said it best recently when the camera caught a fan
holding up a banner that read "We miss you Chick." Stu said, "That's
the understatement of the century."</TE>
<TE>   Stu was right. Come back soon, Chick.</TE>
<TE>   Maurice Sanchez</TE>
<TE>   Coto de Caza</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If Rick Cipes is not alone in his position regarding Chick Hearn's
retirement, I believe that those among him of the same opinion are
very few in number.</TE>
<TE>   Chick's play-by-play is brilliant, and his enthusiasm for the game
is boundless. Even his pronunciation of Slava Medvedenko's surname is
tolerable, and like Shaq's free throwing, I'm sure Chick will
eventually get it right.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Leon</TE>
<TE>   Van Nuys</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thank you, Rick Cipes, for your eloquently written letter
concerning the passing of the torch via Chick Hearn. A lot of us
share your sentiments but do not dare disparage a living icon. I
believe that it is time for a new and unbiased perspective toward
Laker game reporting. Like a previous reader reported, listening to a
Laker game is more like being privy to a love affair.</TE>
<TE>   As for this Laker game viewer, the Jell-O is getting moldy, the
eggs are rotting and the refrigerator needs recycling.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Jones</TE>
<TE>   Calabasas</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Just love the Lakers and the coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Not a single mention in The Times after the San Antonio game where
Kobe Bryant blatantly shoved his defender out of the way for an
important, late-game, non-call, field goal.</TE>
<TE>   Then, when Shaq was called for a questionable foul against Allen
Iverson, there wasn't enough room for all of Phil Jackson and the
Lakers to complain. It seems The Times continues to be a Laker
co-conspirator in the "Us Against the World" sob story.</TE>
<TE>   Calls go both ways. But when it's not reported, the fans feel it's
all about unfairness put upon their beloved Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Grow up, Phil. Grow up, Lakers. Grow up, Times.</TE>

<HD>Trading Odom? There's the Mistake</HD>

<LD>I could not stay silent when T.J. Simers wrote in his recent column
that the Clippers should trade Lamar Odom. As a Clipper season-ticket
holder, I too have experienced the excitement and the frustration
that seem to accompany the talent-laden roster.</LD>
<LD>   While I agree that they need and lack that one veteran player to
take them to the next level, you don't trade your best player to get
him. The Lakers would never trade Kobe or Shaq. The Clippers, I'm
praying, have the foresight to never trade Odom or Brand.</LD>
<LD>   I'm not condoning or excusing the mistakes Lamar Odom has made. He
is a young man and is imperfect like the rest of us. Trade him, and
you're giving away the future.</LD>

<LD>It sickened me to see St. Louis trot out Jackie Slater and Eric
Dickerson for the coin toss in the NFC championship game. I can just
imagine the fans of St. Louis asking each other, "Who are those
guys?"</LD>
<LD>   This is the equivalent to the Ravens marching out Brian Sipe or
Jim Brown for such a ceremony. Let's all hope New England wins or
Georgia might bring back Dieter Brock to hand out the rings on
opening day.</LD>

<TE>   Sports history has certainly produced its share of outlandish,
egotistical owners, but if there has ever been a more perfidious
buffoon than Georgia, who, with her actions, proves the axiom, "It's
always better to be alimony-filthy-rich than honest," I've yet to
find him or her.</TE>

<TE>   There should be no surprise or disappointment with regard to the

St. Louis--loss of fan base.</TE>

<TE>   I had to laugh when I read the position-by-position matchup by Roy
Jurgens before the NFC championship game. He had Kurt Warner and
Donovan McNabb rated--are you ready?--even. What? Does he know that
Warner was the No. 1-rated passer in the NFL this season, and was MVP
for the second time? Threw for nearly 5,000 yards and 38 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Warner is on pace to be one of the greatest quarterbacks in
history. McNabb has not come close to those stats in his four years
in the NFL, and wouldn't be rated in the top 100 quarterbacks. This
is what you call even?</TE>
<TE>   You guys at The Times haven't given Warner the credit he deserves.
Sam Farmer even said that Kordell Stewart should have been MVP. Come
on, guys. Swallow hard, and tell it like it is.</TE>

<TE>   In 1950 our Rose Bowl-bound Cal Bears hosted the Dons at Memorial
Stadium. The game was played in a heavy rain before about 4,000 of us
fans lost in the 85,000-seat stadium. The Bears won, 13-7, after
stopping Ollie at the goal line just before the half. We got lucky
that day, but Ollie went on to greatness.</TE>

<LD>Jerry Crowe's cheap-shot hyperbole [Jan. 27] regarding King Coach
Andy Murray "snapping" when encountering "choppy water" would imply
to those not in attendance (at the Jan. 26 game against Colorado)
that Andy pulled a Bobby Knight and threw a finger or furniture in
the direction of the referees. That is "snapping."</LD>
<LD>   Anyone who has followed the season knows that the Kings "choppy
water" was at the beginning of the season, and they have successfully
rowed through it--with Murray at the helm.</LD>
<LD>   Andy Murray had every right to be livid and conducted himself
quite civilly considering the circumstances. Crowe's need to portray
Murray as a man who snapped because things didn't go his way was his
own feeble attempt at a slap shot.</LD>

<TE>   Many sports fans around the country do not regard the NHL as a
major league sport because of the NHL propensity of using minor
league referees.</TE>
<TE>   To this bystander who has been involved in hockey for more than 70
years, last Saturday's King-Avalanche game was the worst-officiated
game I've ever seen.</TE>
<TE>   The NHL is to be partially blamed for assigning a rookie referee
to a game involving two of the league's better teams. The veteran
referee didn't seem to counsel his inexperienced colleague as the
game went on.</TE>
<TE>   It's inconceivable to me that the NHL cannot produce more
competent officials from the United States and Canada than these two
guys. They were just plain brutal.</TE>

<LD>The score was tied with just over two minutes remaining when Rod
Strickland threw up the kind of shot he hardly ever takes, much less
makes.</LD>
<LD>   The long jumper went in for his second three-point basket of the
season, helping the Miami Heat defeat the slumping San Antonio Spurs,
88-83, on Friday night at Miami.</LD>
<LD>   "The shot clock was winding down," Strickland said. "I just tried
to get some room and get a shot up."</LD>
<TE>   The basket put the Heat ahead to stay, and it won for the ninth
time in 11 games. San Antonio has lost three in a row, and six of
eight.</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs rallied from an 18-point first-half deficit but missed
their final seven shots after taking an 81-78 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Strickland's only basket of the second half put Miami ahead 84-81.
He had been one for nine from three-point range this season, his
other being a 60-footer at the end of the first half against New
Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Washington 97, Atlanta 90--Michael Jordan had 28 points and eight

<TE>   Shareef Abdur-Rahim had 25 points and eight rebounds to lead the
Hawks, who have dropped 12 of 13 and had lost their previous five
games by an average of 21 points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 98, Boston 95--Kevin Garnett had 21 points and 15
rebounds and Terrell Brandon had 21 points, nine rebounds and nine
assists at Boston as the Timberwolves won in overtime to end a losing
streak at four.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota won for the fourth consecutive time at the FleetCenter.
The Celtics dropped their third in a row, their first three-game
losing streak since Nov. 17-24.</TE>
<TE>   Boston hasn't defeated the Timberwolves since Jan. 2, 1998.</TE>

season, has won 15 of 16 overall and 18 in a row at home.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Orlando 85, Detroit 83--Tracy McGrady made a shot from just inside
the three-point line with 1.8 seconds lef to lead the Magic at Auburn
Hills, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Stackhouse had a chance to tie it, but hit the side of the
backboard on an off-balance shot from the baseline as time expired.</TE>

<TE>   Charlotte 73, Houston 72--Lee Nailon made a 20-foot jumper for the

<TE>   Cuttino Mobley scored 23 points for the Rockets, who fell to 1-19
with Steve Francis out of the lineup. The All-Star guard sat out with

<DL></DL>
<LD>The NCAA put Alabama on five years' probation Friday, jolting the
football program with a two-year bowl ban and heavy scholarship
reductions.</LD>
<LD>   The governing body said it considered giving the Crimson Tide the
most severe punishment--the death penalty--under the repeat violator
rules for a recruiting scandal in which boosters were accused of
paying money for high school players.</LD>
<LD>   "These violations are some of the worst, most serious that have
ever occurred," said Thomas Yeager, chairman of the infractions
committee.</LD>
<TE>   The NCAA reduced the number of football scholarships the school
can award by 21 over three years.</TE>
<TE>   The university, accused of 11 major violations and five minor
charges under former coaches Mike DuBose and Gene Stallings, said it
would appeal.</TE>
<TE>   President Andrew Sorensen said university officials "are firm in
our belief that the penalties are inappropriate."</TE>

<HD>Schedules Will Be Balanced</HD>
<DH>NFL: Addition of Houston next season and realignment mean
all four teams in each of the eight divisions will have 14 common
opponents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB OATES</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>The road to the Super Bowl, largely unchanged since 1970, will have
several new onramps next season.</LD>
<LD>   With the addition of the Houston Texans, the NFL will expand to 32
teams in 2002, and the league has been realigned into eight four-team
divisions. Among the effects:</LD>
<LD>   * The season will begin Sept. 8-9 (a week after Labor Day
weekend), and there will be a two-week layoff between the conference
championship games and the Super Bowl, which, after San Diego in
2003, will be played in February.</LD>
<TE>   * Several division rivalries--Arizona moves from the NFC East to
NFC West, Seattle moves from the AFC West to the NFC West--have been
abandoned in hopes of creating natural geographic rivalries, such as
Seattle versus San Francisco and Tampa Bay versus New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   * Four division winners and two wild cards from each conference,
rather than three division winners and three wild cards, will advance
to the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   * And most important, the unbalanced schedule--which helped the
New England Patriots and Chicago Bears go from worst to first this
season--is gone, replaced by a balanced schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be no more last-place schedules for teams finishing
fifth--no more easy schedules for people to cry about," said Dennis
Lewin, an NFL senior vice president who supervises scheduling. "One
of the great things about a balanced 32-team league is that all four
teams in each of the eight divisions will play mostly common
opponents--14 common opponents, 14 of their 16 games."</TE>
<TE>   Said Mike Reinfeldt, a Seattle Seahawk senior vice president: "The
14 common opponents works out to 88% of your schedule. So when the
dust settles, that helps ensure that the deserving teams make the
playoffs." Each team's schedule will have home-and-home games against
the others in its division (six games).</TE>
<TE>   In addition, each team in, say, the AFC West will play four games
against opponents from another division in its conference plus four
games against others in an NFC division (eight games).</TE>
<TE>   Each team's other two games will be played against opponents in
its own conference based on the previous year's finishes. In 2002,
for example, teams that were first in 2001 will play two other
first-place finishers.</TE>
<TE>   "Each year, every divisional schedule will rotate to different
divisions," Lewin said. "Which means that every team will meet every
other team in its own conference at least once every three years--and
home and away every six years. On the same rotating basis, every team
will also regularly meet every team in the other conference--less
often but regularly."</TE>
<TE>   That will correct some of the NFL's previously disjointed
scheduling. The Green Bay Packers haven't played in Washington since
1979, and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers have never played in Buffalo.</TE>
<TE>   "As an NFL player, I played just once in Washington," Seattle's
Reinfeldt said. "I've been in the league ever since in various
capacities--that's 27 years--and when the Seahawks played the
Redskins this season, that's the first time I've seen them in 27
years."</TE>
<TE>   Most club executives seem to be looking forward to the four-team
divisions.</TE>
<TE>   "The intimacy of it appeals to football people," Reinfeldt said.
"You've got three teams to beat--the other three in your
division--and you're in the playoffs. It helps the players focus on
what you've got to do, it helps the coaches focus, even the fans. In
an eight-team division, the rivalries are too diluted."</TE>
<TE>   But the realignment will take some getting used to.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the big NFL rivalries are division rivalries," Reinfeldt
said. "And I think it's important to preserve those. They're moving
[Seattle] out of the AFC West next year and into the NFC West, and
we're not happy about that. Our fans enjoyed hating Oakland and
Denver--and now they're going to have to learn to hate new teams. So
that learning curve is a negative. On the other hand, we're looking
forward to new rivalries with the 49ers, the Rams and Arizona. The
49er rivalry, both of us on the coast, should be great."</TE>
<TE>   The realignment into eight divisions also will have an impact on
the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   With eight division champions and only four wild cards, there's a
good chance that some 10-6 non-division championship teams won't make
it. It's possible, in fact, that a division champion will get there
with an 8-8 record, or even 7-9.</TE>
<TE>   "That very thing has happened in the past--an 8-8 team in the
playoffs and a 10-6 team stays home--and what it means is that that's
the way things are," said Bill McGrane, director of administration
for the Chicago Bears. "I don't have a problem with it. You have a
rule that everyone knows about. You play by the rules or you find
another job."</TE>
<TE>   Theoretically, any one division could still send up to three
playoff teams--as was the case this season when three AFC East teams
made it.</TE>
<TE>   "But after this, fewer wild cards can be expected to win the Super
Bowl," Lewin said. "It's a matter of percentages. Division winners
will have the best chance."</TE>

<LD>DeKALB, Ill.--A student trying out for the Northern Illinois
University football team died Friday after collapsing during
conditioning drills.</LD>
<LD>   Jawan Jackson, of the Chicago suburb of Robbins, was running
sprints with the football team when he fell to one knee around 6:55
a.m. at the student recreation center.</LD>
<LD>   He collapsed while athletic trainers were tending to him and they
immediately tried to resuscitate him before calling paramedics.</LD>
<TE>   Jackson, a 19-year-old freshman, was taken to Kishwaukee Community
Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 7:40 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   "He appeared to be a healthy young man who was in fairly good
shape," county coroner Dennis Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   "We require that any athlete trying out for a sport sign a
certificate that indicates they have had a physical exam and are able
to participate in tryouts, and he had done so," an NIU spokeswoman
said of Jackson.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Games begin in six days and, consequently, so do the Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   From the lighting of the torch on Friday to its snuffing out Feb.
24, Salt Lake City will have become a whole new animal--a party
animal. So will the surrounding communities, especially Park City,
often dubbed "Sin City" by the Mormons.</LD>
<LD>   In the next several days tourists will be flooding into Utah's
great white north, to be on hand for the spectacle that is the 2002
Olympic Winter Games, but also to be part of the spectacle.</LD>
<TE>   A large percentage will be coming from Southern California, and
those packing skis or snowboards will be delighted to know that this
week's storm left a blanket of powder three feet thick in places.</TE>
<TE>   They might also make note that Park City's primary Olympic venues,
Deer Valley Resort and Park City Mountain Resort, are open even on
Olympic competition days, with 96% of their terrain available to the
general public.</TE>
<TE>   "There are still a lot of people who think they can't ski or
snowboard here," said Michelle Palmer, spokeswoman at Park City
Mountain Resort.</TE>
<TE>   PCMR's Eagle Race Arena, site of snowboarding halfpipe and giant
slalom events, and Alpine giant slalom events, is located on the
northernmost portion of the front face of the mountain, so event
spectators are funneled in that direction, while skiers and boarders
can ride the lifts to their favorite runs without too much
interference.</TE>
<TE>   Or so said Palmer. There will be 16,000 ticket holders streaming
through the main entrance on event days, so lift-ticket holders might
want to access the slopes via Town Lift on Main Street.</TE>
<TE>   Deer Valley Resort spectators--the facility has moguls, aerials
and slalom events--will be using the main Snow Park base entrance,
while skiers (snowboarders are not allowed at Deer Valley) will be
using the Silver Lake entrance higher up the mountain.</TE>
<TE>   But enough about mountain logistics. Once the Games begin, the
flurry of activity will go well beyond the slopes.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 9, the first athletes will be honored for their
performances at Olympic Medals Plaza in Salt Lake City. Later that
evening, in the plaza's amphitheater, the Dave Matthews Band will
give its first Olympic performance.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 10 at Park City Mountain Resort, Olympic women
snowboarders will be rocking and rolling on the halfpipe. Later that
evening, at Harry O's on nearby Main Street, Smashmouth will be
rocking and rolling on stage.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 11, back at Olympic Medals Plaza, the Foo Fighters will
pick up where Dave Matthews left off.</TE>
<TE>   You get the picture....</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Salt Lake City and Park City are the two main center stages for
Olympic entertainment, and consequently, the Games.</TE>
<TE>   Salt Lake City may have more headliners--Barenaked Ladies, Sheryl
Crow, Creed and Train to name a few others. But Park City, with three
Olympic venues (Utah Olympic Park being the third), figures to be
just as lively, if not more so.</TE>
<TE>   Park City's historic Main Street, which is open only to pedestrian
traffic throughout the Games, has events or attractions scheduled
daily from 10 a.m.-11 p.m. The Egyptian Theater is staying open
beyond that, showing "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" nightly at
midnight.</TE>
<TE>   Main Street will be buzzing day and night. Skiers and snowboarders
can now glide directly into its heart, thanks to the completion in
December of Town Bridge, a one-million-pound structure that "connects
the mountain resort to the town that supports the resort," Palmer
said.</TE>
<TE>   Town Lift, which traverses a line of aerial tramway towers once
used to transport silver during Park City's mining era, provides
access back to the slopes and is reachable via shuttle during the
Games.</TE>
<TE>   "Town Bridge is unique to Utah," Palmer said. "Telluride [in
Colorado] has its gondola and Aspen [Colo.] has trails leading
directly into town. Now we have the Town Bridge."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Park City Mountain Resort's Legacy Lodge Stadium Club, which
recently obtained a license to sell liquor, is featuring live video
feeds of Olympic action and daily autograph sessions with past and
present Olympic athletes.</TE>
<TE>   The Salt Lake Olympic Committee has use of the facility for six
days, charging $125 a day. The resort is using it the other 11 days,
charging only $12 for basically the same thing, according to Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   Athletes scheduled to attend: Picabo Street, Donna Weinbrecht, Jim
Craig, Phil Mahre, Nadia Comaneci, Evander Holyfield, Shannon Dunn,
Rosalynn Sumners, Eric Schlopy, Paul Wylie, Jenni Meno and Todd Sand,
Elvis Stojko, Bart Conner, Eric Bergoust, Ildiko Strehli, Ashley
Hayden, and members of the American men's and women's bobsled teams.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Many athletes have yet to make their way across the Utah state
line. Among them, snowboarding halfpipe specialists Tommy Czeschin,
Ross Powers and Danny Kass, who are at Mammoth Mountain through today
"looking to shake the pre-Olympic jitters," a resort spokeswoman
said.</TE>
<TE>   The three have chosen, at the behest of Coach Pete del Giudice, to
train at the Eastern Sierra resort's superpipe to "get back to the
basics before facing the pressure of the Olympics."</TE>

<LD>Snowboarding, sport of competitive amplitude and amped competitors,
takes its second run at the Winter Olympics this month with
expectations decidedly more mellow than the first.</LD>
<LD>   This time, maybe the men's giant slalom gold medalist won't be
busted for marijuana.</LD>
<LD>   This time, maybe the actual participants will receive more
publicity than the Norwegian superstar boycotting the competition.</LD>
<TE>   This time, maybe the American snowboarders will actually find
something decent to wear.</TE>
<TE>   "The last Olympics in Japan, we had the worst outfits ever," says
Shannon Dunn, bronze medalist in the women's halfpipe at the 1998
Nagano Olympics. "I'm sorry, whoever designed them.... Our snowboard
outfits were horrible. Mine was probably two sizes too big. I felt
like I was wearing a big trash bag.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, snowboarding is about style and looking good--and then
you have to wear these horrible outfits. I don't know. I'm hoping for
the best this year."</TE>
<TE>   It was a culture collision waiting to happen, from the moment the
International Olympic Committee determined in the mid-1990s that its
Winter Games might be a tad staid and should consider adding some
events that might appeal to a younger audience and noticed that quite
a few kids seemed fascinated with this curious amalgamation of
skiing, surfing and skateboarding.</TE>
<TE>   Snowboarding was a boom sport, participation in the United States
almost doubling from 1988 to 1995. But it was also a free-form,
do-it-yourself sport that prided itself on individualism and
self-expression. Snowboarders thought young, acted young, were
young--and that included everything from attire to attitude to midair
halfpipe maneuvers carrying such labels as "roast beef air," "misty
flip" and the "McTwist."</TE>
<TE>   It was a language completely foreign to the conservative IOC, and
the ensuing fallout was hardly surprising.</TE>
<TE>   The sport went into its first Olympics kicking and screaming. In
December 1995, the IOC granted four snowboarding events Olympic medal
status: men's and women's giant slalom, in which two competitors at a
time race downhill, and men's and women's halfpipe, in which riders
zigzag across a cylindrical bowl of ice performing aerial stunts that
are graded by judges for such elements as number of rotations in the
air, overall impression and amplitude--the height of each maneuver.</TE>
<TE>   However, there was one crucial proviso. The IOC decreed that the
event be coordinated and controlled by the International Ski
Federation (FIS), rather than the sport's existing governing body,
the International Snowboarding Federation (IFS).</TE>
<TE>   Many snowboarders were outraged, among them Norway's Terje
Haakonsen, one of the sport's biggest names. He compared the IOC to
the Mafia and announced he was boycotting the 1998 Games.</TE>
<TE>   "Snowboarding is about fresh tracks and carving powder and being
yourself and not being judged by others," he said at the time. "It's
not about nationalism and politics and big money. Snowboarding is
everything the Olympics isn't."</TE>
<TE>   Haakonsen went surfing while the first official Olympic
snowboarding competition plunged from one controversy to another.
Three days after Canada's Ross Rebagliati won the gold medal in the
men's parallel giant slalom, the IOC announced that Rebagliati had
tested positive for marijuana and would be stripped of his medal.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadian Olympic Assn. filed an appeal, dragging the sport and
the IOC through a legal skirmish that bordered on low comedy.
Rebagliati claimed he hadn't smoked marijuana in 10 months but
inhaled second-hand smoke at a party held at his hometown of Whistler
just before leaving for the Olympics. The Canadians also argued that
no Olympic athlete had ever been disqualified for using a
non-performance-enhancing drug and that marijuana was not on the
IOC's list of prohibited substances.</TE>
<TE>   Rebagliati was eventually reinstated as Olympic champion, but the
incident clouded the snowboarding competition in Nagano and continues
to hang over the sport as it readies for Round 2 in Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone [in the media] seems to like that story," says Ross
Powers of South Londonderry, Vt., returning for his second Olympics
after winning the bronze medal in the men's halfpipe in 1998. "About
half the interviews we do, that gets brought up."</TE>
<TE>   Dunn, who lives in Carnelian Bay, Calif., believes the U.S. media
"didn't really cover" the snowboarding competition in Nagano.</TE>
<TE>   "A big reason was just because of that whole Ross Rebagliati
fiasco," she says. "And then on top of that, they didn't really get
snowboarding. They didn't know how to cover it. I think they were
pretty skeptical about the whole event. They didn't know what to do
with it, so they didn't do too much with it. I think it got
misrepresented by what happened with Ross.... It's kind of a bummer
it had to happen the first year of our Olympics."</TE>
<TE>   Circe Wallace, a sports marketing specialist who has been involved
with snowboarding for 15 years, takes a different view.</TE>
<TE>   "Personally, I thought it was hilarious," she said. "I thought it
was the perfect representation of how the Olympics perceives
snowboarding. Here we are--we're still anti-establishment, no matter
what you do. You can put us in the Olympics, but we're still getting
in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just the nature of the beast. And, thank God for it. I think
snowboarding is all about self-expression. I think it's all about
freedom. I think it's all about getting outside of the norm....</TE>
<TE>   "The only reason that snowboarding got any exposure in '98 was
because Ross Rebagliati was busted for dope. And that's the only
reason that anyone got invited to Letterman. That's the only reason
snowboarding made it on the map in '98."</TE>
<TE>   If the IOC was embarrassed, the sensation quickly passed. Taking
note of the popularity of the Winter X Games, which made their debut
in 1997 and feature such "extreme" sports as snowmobiling and snow
mountain bike racing, the IOC has added 10 events to its 2002 Winter
Games agenda, one of them a rather intense head-first sliding event
known as skeleton.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the IOC, like all of us, is trying to be more relevant
and find events that are more a part of youth culture," says Jim
Page, the U.S. Olympic Committee's managing director for sports
performance.</TE>
<TE>   "More or less, the same concept was followed with freestyle skiing
[which became an Olympic sport in 1992] before the X Games. It was a
sport that became very attractive to youth, had a different and more
exciting culture for young people. The International Ski Federation
got involved and found a way to run competitions and got it in the
Games.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that process is what happened with snowboard as well."</TE>
<TE>   Svein Romstad, general secretary of the International Luge
Federation, believes the IOC needed to add events that appeal to a
younger audience, particularly during the Winter Games.</TE>
<TE>   "Being a winter-sports person, I think that's where we separate
ourselves from the Summer Games," he says. "A more
living-on-the-edge-type deal versus the Summer [Games], which have
much more traditional events. I think it's very, very good for the
Games. I think it's a natural progression. Times have changed."</TE>
<TE>   Romstad watched some of the snowboarding competition in Nagano in
1998 and said the sport "does appeal to a younger demographic. It
broadens your demographics. It makes for good television and it's
unique. I think it's a very positive development, without a doubt."</TE>
<TE>   Even if it comes equipped with its unique baggage, some pieces
filled with styles of Olympic-issue clothing many self-respecting
snowboarders wouldn't be caught dead in.</TE>
<TE>   Olympic tradition and snowboarding iconoclasm clashed again when
U.S. competitors were handed their uniforms for the Nagano Games.
Uniforms? Snowboarders have their traditions as well--one is to come
as you are, another is to do your thing. Many were aghast at the idea
of being told what to wear, and when to wear it.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn cringes when recalling the cowboy hat, scarf and long coat
ensemble the U.S. team had to wear during the opening ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   "All the pants were tapered, high-waisted, just no style--full
'80s style," Dunn says. "I couldn't believe it. Of all the outfits, I
think the U.S. had the worst. They were just so cheesy."</TE>
<TE>   And then there was the standardized U.S. team apparel the
snowboarders were required to wear during and in between competition.</TE>
<TE>   "I was dying, having to wear that stuff," Dunn says. "It was
humiliating.... Because it really makes a difference. You have to
walk around in these hideous clothes. It's just so bad--you have to
wear them.</TE>
<TE>   "I was roommates with Cara-Beth Burnside at the time, and we could
not put on our clothing. They told us everyone's got to wear the
jeans with the white polo shirt or whatever and you have to go to
breakfast in this outfit. And we're, like, sorry, there's no way
we're wearing that stuff.</TE>
<TE>   "So we walked out in our own clothes and we got so shunned.
Everyone stared at us, and then we got reprimanded. So we had to
change our clothes. And then we just joked about it--we tucked our
shirts in and pulled our pants way up high."</TE>
<TE>   To a snowboarder, this is no trivial matter. Powers says it
factored into his decision to leave the U.S. snowboarding team after
the 1998 Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "Snowboarding is kind of like an individual sport," he says.
"That's one of the reasons I switched off the U.S. team and just ride
for Burton, for Polo [Sport], my own companies. Because they want you
to be your own person instead of, like, being on a team.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be awesome if we could wear our own clothes. But those
are the people funding the team and getting us there and everything.
So I think we can wear their stuff for a week or so."</TE>
<TE>   This never happens at X Games, though. Dunn and Powers have
participated in both competitions and appreciate the X Games as a
snowboarding event that caters to snowboarders.</TE>
<TE>   So why bother with the Olympics at all?</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, one Olympic tradition still holds after all these
years: the allure of a gold, silver or bronze medal.</TE>
<TE>   "The X Games are cool because you get to hang out with a bunch of
other action-sport dudes, like the snowmobilers and the freestylers,"
Powers says. "Definitely, all the [top] snowboarders showed up there.
It's probably the biggest [snowboarding] event this year.</TE>
<TE>   "But the X Games are more within the snowboarding community. The
Olympics are, like, the whole world. Everyone knows what the Olympics
are. The Olympics are for everyone, from kids to their grandparents."</TE>
<TE>   Asked which championship she would rather win, the X Games or the
Olympics, Dunn does not hesitate.</TE>
<TE>   "The Olympics," she replies. "Obviously, the X Games are yearly,
so there's not as much pressure to win. Because if you don't do well
one year, you can come back and do it again the next year. The
Olympics is just every four years, it's once or twice in your
lifetime. It's kind of a rare opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   So they will assemble again in Salt Lake City and risk the
attendant indignities and assaults on the freedom of self-expression
that come with the Olympic rings.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, Dunn says, she has already checked out the new uniforms
on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "The things I've seen," she reports, "aren't that bad."</TE>

<HD>Perez Avoids Bumps in His First Pebble Trip</HD>
<DH>Golf: A seven-under second round gives Q-school winner a
four-shot lead in National Pro-Am.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PEBBLE BEACH</DL>
<LD>Everybody seems to agree that the greens this week at the AT&amp;T Pebble
Beach National Pro-Am are leaving something to be desired. Like
smoothness.</LD>
<LD>   Because of recent rain, they are soft to begin with, and then you
get 180 pros and 180 amateurs walking all over them in spikes and you
can see the problem. These greens have more holes in them than an
Enron financial report.</LD>
<LD>   It's a problem that all the players face--how to navigate a golf
ball over a bumpy green and try to keep it from going airborne on its
way to the hole.</LD>
<TE>   Some are better at it than others and on Friday, the best/luckiest
was Pat Perez, who obviously knows a thing or two about doing it the
hard way. Perez followed up his opening 66 with a second-round 65 at
Pebble Beach and holds a four-shot lead over Lee Janzen after two
rounds.</TE>
<TE>   Perez, 25, was the medalist at the last PGA Tour qualifying school
and earned his first ticket to the big leagues. When you're playing
well enough to turn in a 13-under 131, the greens simply aren't a
problem, even if it is the first time you've played Pebble Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "They're bumpy, but you just try to steer 'em in there and you
make 'em," Perez said.</TE>
<TE>   Janzen's 67 at Spyglass leaves him alone in second, one shot ahead
of Jerry Smith. As for Smith, who had a 69 at Poppy Hills, he says he
couldn't have been any more fortunate and not only because he did it
at his least favorite course. "It's not easy. I made all three
three-footers, four-footers and five-footers; you know, the ones you
just don't want to have out here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods is 12 shots off the lead, which means Tiger has Perez
right where he wants him, or it's going to be a very long weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Woods turned in a mediocre one-over 73 at Spyglass Hill and is
only one-under 143 after 36 holes.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Woods said he didn't really know what was wrong. He did
know where the ball was going, it's just that there wasn't much he
could do about it. "I hit a few left, hit a few right, hit a few fat,
long, I had it all," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Woods, who also complained about the greens, didn't feel
comfortable with his irons or his swing, but didn't say anything bad
about the new prototype titanium driver he's using this week.</TE>
<TE>   "All you can do is hit good putts and from there, see what
happens," he said. "It's just one of those things. Sometimes they
bounce in if you hit them poorly and sometimes they don't when you
hit them good."</TE>
<TE>   Woods should have known he was in for an adventurous day on the
par-five first hole when he hit into some ice plant, chipped out and
managed to save par.</TE>
<TE>   In two rounds, Woods has played the par-five holes in only two
under. But that fact didn't seem to trouble Woods as much as the
condition of the greens.</TE>
<TE>   "The greens aren't as good as they have been in the past," he
said. "The greens are a lot more bumpy than they have been. It was
tough to make putts. I mean, I hit good putts and it's not too often
I ever feel nervous over a two-footer. And out here, there is a good
chance of missing them."</TE>
<TE>   For a while on Wednesday, there was a good chance that Perez would
miss the tournament. He was sick, played only nine holes at Poppy
Hills and seriously thought about withdrawing. Instead, Perez felt
well enough to tee it up on Thursday and 66-65 has made him feel
better. That's not what he was thinking about Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was going to be a horrible week," Perez said. "I
thought the first two days would be a nightmare."</TE>
<TE>   In the nightmare category is Phil Mickelson at six-over 150, 19
shots out of the lead, and close to missing the cut. That's the same
situation facing defending champion Davis Love III, who had a 73 at
Spyglass and is five over through 36 holes, mostly because of his
first-round 76. If Mickelson and Love were all over the place,
consider Jesper Parnevik, who had 18 pars at Spyglass. First-round
leader Brent Schwarzrock fell eight strokes back with a 75 at Poppy
Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Perez isn't exactly spending the winner's check yet, which is
wise, since there's a long way to go. But he says there will be a
time when it's going to be his day on a Sunday. "It's one thing to
get to the tour, but it's also another thing to win. You want to play
as well as you can. I'm thankful to be in the position I'm in."</TE>

<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>It's Super Bowl versus Mardi Gras.</LD>
<LD>   It's a bloated, bombastic weeklong celebration of commercial
promotions and pomposity, platitudes and pandering to the lowest of
our sporting tastes--buy warm beer and fast cars--up against a city's
history, its biggest and best party, its personal advertisement for
the lowest of our partying tastes--women taking off shirts to receive
cheap trinkets and plastic beads, nonchalant nakedness splashed with
cheap beer by guys driving fast cars.</LD>
<LD>   And the winner is?</LD>
<TE>   Good taste and some sobriety. A subdued murmur of quiet dinners
and tasteful displays of fanfare. Printed signs and T-shirts in the
pro-Ram or pro-Patriot vein instead of obscene slogans of the
anti-Ram or anti-Patriot variety.</TE>
<TE>   Some things can't be faked, especially not in New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   The history, the music, the great food and sweet accent belonging
to the residents are not for tourists.</TE>
<TE>   And so, when the city's biggest party, Mardi Gras, had to be split
in half to accommodate the city's ninth go at hosting the Super Bowl,
it was not an improvement. For Mardi Gras or the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   There were Mardi Gras parades last weekend in the French Quarter.
There will be more next weekend in the French Quarter. There will be
some this weekend out in the suburbs. There will be some private
Mardi Gras parties in Garden District homes decorated in twinkling
lights and the purple, gold and green beads that are also draped
around the merchandise in just about every store around the city.</TE>
<TE>   The line to check into the Hyatt Thursday and Friday was long and
winding but you could walk down Bourbon Street and not have bodies
touching.</TE>
<TE>   It's not supposed to be that way during Super Bowl week or Mardi
Gras week, when walking down Bourbon Street is a way to become
acquainted with strangers. You should not be able to carry on a
conversation or hear those of others.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think a lot of guys feel it's appropriate to be out on
the streets partying," said Ram defensive back Aeneas Williams, a New
Orleans native. "I know guys on my team kind of feel like,
considering the times and what has happened in our country, they
don't want to go out, getting in trouble, hanging out. I know people
around town have thought the Super Bowl is hurting Mardi Gras. But I
kind of wonder, isn't it Sept. 11 that has hurt Mardi Gras?"</TE>
<TE>   Said Patriot wide receiver Troy Brown: "This city has been pretty
laid-back this week. It's been kind of dull, which is good for the
players. I don't know if it's good for the city. I hope that's not a
commentary on the teams involved. Are we boring?"</TE>
<TE>   A little.</TE>
<TE>   The Ram and Patriot rosters are filled with players who are more
comfortable in prayer groups than in roving groups of party boys
stumbling into Pat O'Briens. There has been little controversy, less
buzz about this 36th Super Bowl. The betting line, 14 points given to
the Patriots, is the third highest in Super Bowl history.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't bring our kids because my wife thought it would be too
ugly for our 14-year-old and 12-year-old," said Jerry Hulse, a
45-year-old Ram fan. "But after we went out last night, my wife said,
'This isn't any different than what we'd find at home on the
weekend.' I'm not disappointed. It's nice to be able to walk around
the Quarter and look in the windows and stuff and not be hassled.
It's just not what we expected."</TE>
<TE>   Doreen and her band of jazz musicians are singing and playing in
Jackson Square and the music is rousing. But it's not about the Super
Bowl. It's about the sound. Doreen and her band are always about in
Jackson Square.</TE>
<TE>   The city's conflicted identity is evident in many storefronts.
Instead of "Super Bowl souvenirs" or "Mardi Gras souvenirs," the
signs advertise "New Orleans souvenirs." There are Mardi Gras masks
and beads next to Super Bowl hats and shirts.</TE>
<TE>   And the mingling of merchandise hasn't meant big sales.</TE>
<TE>   "Mardi Gras Sale" read the sign at the Bayou Trading Company on
Royal Street. "We wouldn't normally be doing that in the middle of
Mardi Gras," owner Bruce Lowrey says, "but that may have more to do
with Sept. 11 than with the split in Mardi Gras weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "You can look out on the street and it's like a normal weekend. I
know the merchants here all consoled ourselves that the Mardi
Gras/Super Bowl/Mardi Gras split would work for us, but it hasn't
produced. Splitting up has taken away from Mardi Gras momentum, I'll
say that. It has upset many of the Krewe and parade people, that's
for sure."</TE>
<TE>   In the New Orleans Centre mall, a shopping center connecting the
Hyatt and the Superdome, a radio was playing and three people were
listening to reports about an American newspaper reporter who had
been kidnapped in Pakistan. Some 100 feet ahead, just outside the
door, all you could see was chicken-wire fencing, plastic barriers
and armed National Guardsmen standing and staring.</TE>
<TE>   "You know," said Hulse, the Ram fan, "maybe people don't feel so
much like partying with everything that's happened. I mean, we'll all
be excited Sunday, and if the Rams win I imagine a bunch of us will
go to the Quarter and have some beers. But I don't think you'll see a
lot of guys getting in trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Hulse was wearing a strand of red, white and blue beads around his
neck. He had just bought them at a souvenir stand in the mall. He
held a strand for his wife.</TE>
<TE>   They were Mardi Gras beads, to be worn for the parades or to throw
at a comely woman. But Hulse didn't know that.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's nice," Hulse said, "to have these symbols of 9-11."</TE>
<TE>   When Super Bowl meets Mardi Gras in 2002, then, the winner is
solemn enjoyment over raucous debauchery. Which doesn't make either
the Super Bowl or Mardi Gras less fun. Only different.</TE>

PST, Channel 11</KH>
<HD>Can Rams Be Stopped?</HD>
<DH>Defending St. Louis Can Be Scary, but the Patriots Will
Have a Chance if They Follow This Five-Step Plan</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>San Francisco 49er quarterback Jeff Garcia is headed for his second
Pro Bowl, holds a bunch of 49er records, and, who knows, might be
playing New England in the Super Bowl on Sunday if not for that nasty
four-letter word:</LD>
<LD>   Rams.</LD>
<LD>   Six times he has played them. Six times he has lost.</LD>
<TE>   "If you want to know how to beat them," he said, "you've got to
ask somebody who came before me."</TE>
<TE>   OK, how about New Orleans Saint quarterback Aaron Brooks? The
Saints have beaten the Rams in three of their last five meetings.
Brooks' suggestion is easy to say, hard to do: score, score and score
some more.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to put points on the board," he said. "Whether they're
playing on turf or grass, they're still the best offense in the
league. You've got to put 30-plus points on the board. If you don't,
forget about it."</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots should be capable of that, right? They scored at
least 34 points four times this season. Marcellus Wiley, a Pro Bowl
defensive end for San Diego, is familiar with what New England can
do. His team lost to the Patriots in Week 4, and Wiley is a true
believer in the capabilities of quarterback Tom Brady.</TE>
<TE>   But ...</TE>
<TE>   "This ain't Pop Warner, baby," he said. "They're going to the
Super Bowl and they're playing the Rams. This is a whole different
world. They're in trouble. They're in deep trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Then again, few people thought the Patriots had a chance to beat
Pittsburgh. At the beginning of the season, some oddsmakers put New
England's chances of winning the Super Bowl at 10,000-1--and that was
before the 1-3 start and Drew Bledsoe's injury. So anything can
happen.</TE>
<TE>   Five things the Patriots need to do to improve their odds:</TE>
<TE>   * Avoid a first-quarter turnover.</TE>
<TE>   The Ram defense is scorching hot after great games against Green
Bay and Philadelphia, and both of those included touchdowns off early
miscues. Early in the first quarter against the Packers, Brett Favre
threw a pass directly into the hands of cornerback Aeneas Williams,
who returned it for a touchdown. A week later, two plays into the
Philadelphia game, Donovan McNabb fumbled while scrambling away from
pressure. The Rams recovered at the Eagle 21 and scored a touchdown
five plays later.</TE>
<TE>   When there's blood in the water, St. Louis can smell it. When the
Patriots played St. Louis in the regular season, they turned over the
ball on their first series and the Rams converted it into a
touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "If you make a mistake on them," Coach Bill Belichick said,
"they're going to make you pay for it."</TE>
<TE>   * Attack the Rams' two-deep zone.</TE>
<TE>   The key is to put pressure on safeties Kim Herring and Adam
Archuleta, the last line of defense, who cover the deeper regions of
the field. One way to do that is by establishing the run. But that's
no simple task against a defense that hasn't allowed a 100-yard
rusher this season.</TE>
<TE>   Middle linebacker London Fletcher plays so deep, he's almost a
third safety, and he's usually in perfect position to play deep
routes over the middle. The cornerbacks do a great job of forcing the
receivers wide before essentially handing them off to the safeties.
That requires an opposing quarterback to be extremely precise with
his passes, squeezing them into ultra-tight spots.</TE>
<TE>   Swing passes and dump offs to running backs? That's playing right
into the Rams' hands.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that a lot of people don't realize is we want people to
try to dink and dunk all the way down the field," defensive end Chidi
Ahanotu said. "That's what this defense is built for. It's like,
here's your two yards, here's your three yards. We know along the way
you'll get a shot in the ribs, you'll get a shot in the chin, you'll
fumble the ball."</TE>
<TE>   * Make a big play on special teams. The Raiders will never forget
those Adam Vinatieri field goals that knifed through that Foxboro
blizzard and straight into their hearts. And Troy Brown's punt return
for a touchdown was a turning-point play in the victory over the
Steelers.</TE>
<TE>   The St. Louis kickoff coverage unit is one of the team's few soft
spots, ranking 30th in the league during the regular season. Against
Philadelphia, the Rams gave up a 41-yard kickoff return to Brian
Mitchell while trying to protect a 29-17 lead. That return led to an
Eagle touchdown and was a big reason the visitors had a chance down
the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   * Do something, anything to disrupt Kurt Warner.</TE>
<TE>   If, as some people insist, Belichick is a defensive genius, this
is a good test of his abilities. Do the Patriots try to blitz Warner
in hopes of keeping Marshall Faulk back as a blocker? The Eagles
tried that--although they didn't blitz nearly as much as usual--and
they barely touched the quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Do you assign a spy to shadow Faulk? The Rams have too many other
places they can go with the ball. (Besides, there isn't a linebacker
or safety in the league who can cover Faulk.)</TE>
<TE>   Saint defensive coordinator Rick Venturi said Warner throws the
second-level pass--the 20- to 25-yard ins, corners and
comebacks--better than anyone. He gets rid of the ball quickly,
before his receivers are out of their breaks.</TE>
<TE>   "His anticipation is tremendous," Venturi told the New Orleans
Times-Picayune. "I was yelling at the safety during the game and when
I went back and looked at the film there was no way he could have
broken on it."</TE>
<TE>   One thing the Patriots will do is try to disrupt and re-route Ram
receivers at the line of scrimmage, something they did well in the
first game.</TE>
<TE>   "It was press coverage pretty much the whole day," receiver Isaac
Bruce recalled. "I don't know how much more physical they could be
without being offsides. They were up in our face, trying to jack us
around. They hit hard."</TE>
<TE>   * Don't give up on the run.</TE>
<TE>   Ram Coach Mike Martz says there are a lot of similarities between
his offense and the old Buffalo Bill "K-Gun" with Jim Kelly at
quarterback. The New York Giants beat those Bills in Super Bowl XXV
by grinding it out on the ground and controlling the clock.</TE>
<TE>   A key for the Patriots will be Antowain Smith, who is a great
short-yardage runner and has enough speed to pop outside from time to
time. He's a good blocker too, which is vital considering Brady
probably won't be quite as mobile because of his sprained left ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Keep it on the ground and keep St. Louis grounded.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds nice," Garcia said. "But it's really hard to do."</TE>

<LD>Time marched backward Friday, to an era when it was our parents who
had the gray hair and mortgages and the slacks with elastic
waistbands, not us.</LD>
<LD>   To a time when we were younger, more idealistic, less certain of
where we were heading in life.</LD>
<LD>   To a time when all things seemed possible--and for the members of
the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team, the impossible was possible.</LD>
<TE>   All 20 players who created the "Miracle on Ice" at Lake Placid
nearly 22 years ago reunited Friday at the L.A. Convention Center for
the first time since they visited the White House days after the
gold-medal triumph that stunned the hockey world. Most had seen one
another over the years in groups of three or four or 15. But they
hadn't been together as a team since 1980, when the youngest, Mike
Ramsey, was 19, and the oldest, Buzz Schneider, was 25, and the world
was theirs.</TE>
<TE>   They're all in their 40s now. Yet, though the reflection they see
daily in the mirror is that of an adult, they see one another as the
kids they were in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like going to your class reunion," Dave Christian said, "and
you've got a bunch of old people telling you they went to school with
you."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the years and the receding hairlines--for those who had
hair--they immediately fell into their old patterns as they gathered
for a "game" on a mini-rink against a team of NHL alumni. Players who
had been clowns in 1980 were the clowns Friday. Those who were quiet
in 1980 were reticent Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "Those things never change," said Mark Wells, who has endured
several back surgeries and other medical woes and played Friday
against his doctors' orders. "I played in the Olympics and won a gold
medal, but you know what, being here at age 44, after kind of being
an invalid the last 16, 18 years, this is bigger."</TE>
<TE>   It was big. It was a license for them to be kids again, to wallow
in nostalgia for a few hours and be grateful they were all there,
though perhaps thinner on top and thicker around the middle than they
were in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   "'The Today Show' had nine or 10 guys in New York and I saw them
and said to my wife, 'They look old,' and she didn't say anything,"
Ramsey said. "Then I said, 'Do we look that old?' and she didn't say
anything."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Pavelich, notoriously reclusive and last seen by some of his
teammates 15 years ago, emerged from the woods of northern Minnesota
to be there. He drove 22 hours, showing up in khakis and hunting
boots and vest as the pregame introductions began. Teammates were
happily surprised to see him in the flesh.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of interesting things between here and northern
Minnesota," Mark Johnson said. "I wasn't sure he'd get here."</TE>
<TE>   Why did he leave the fish and game and peace of the great north
woods for this raucous reunion?</TE>
<TE>   "It was just that time," he said, in what, for him, amounts to a
speech.</TE>
<TE>   Never was more said in fewer words. As we approach another
Olympics, it was just that time for them--and for me, a reporter who
covered the 1980 U.S. Olympic team for New York Newsday--to enjoy the
fact we're all still alive and able to be together in the post-Sept.
11 world.</TE>
<TE>   I hadn't seen some of them for years. As a hockey writer for
nearly two decades, I saw Christian, Johnson, Ramsey, Ken Morrow,
Neal Broten and Jack O'Callahan as they went to solid NHL careers.
But others, such as Schneider, Eric Strobel and Wells, remained, in
my mind, as they looked on the pages of the 1980 team media guide I
dug out of the closet the other day.</TE>
<TE>   I gasped when I saw John Harrington, his brown hair still thick
but decidedly gray. I gasped even louder when I saw O'Callahan, who
had no hair at all. Team captain Mike Eruzione, who has made a living
off Lake Placid, is heavy enough for his teammates to have joked
about it.</TE>
<TE>   "When they're doing the introductions and they bring Mike out
last," their coach, Herb Brooks, recounted with glee, "O'Callahan
says, 'Eruzione, it looks like they're introducing everyone by
weight, so you know who's gonna be last.'"</TE>
<TE>   They were a team again, laughing and needling each other. And I
was again allowed a peek at this wonderful bond that has survived
time and distance and career turns good and bad.</TE>
<TE>   The Lake Placid Games were the greatest hockey moment most of them
enjoyed; it was certainly among the greatest upsets ever to unfold at
the Olympics or in sports. The players became public property, in a
way. Yet all handled it with uncommon grace and class.</TE>
<TE>   "The moment was public property, not the team," said Brooks, who
will take his own nostalgia trip in a few weeks when he coaches the
2002 U.S. Olympic team at Salt Lake City. "These guys were mature
guys. They've all been very successful. They're doing different
things and they've all made adjustments in their lives. They're not
narcissistic people. They don't live off this. They've made the
transition to everyday life and they've never been hung up on
themselves."</TE>
<TE>   One player told me a year or two after Lake Placid he hoped he'd
never be one of those former athletes who sat on a bar stool and told
whoever would listen that he was on the 1980 hockey team, that he
used to be somebody. He said he hoped he didn't have to look back
some day and realize he peaked when he was 22 or 24.</TE>
<TE>   Judging by what they've made of themselves--bankers, financial
advisors, an oral surgeon, two coaches--they've kept Lake Placid in
its proper perspective. It was a wonderful time, one worth cherishing
for something that can never happen again athletically or
emotionally. But they've stayed open to greater possibilities in
their lives and never felt their lives went downhill from there.</TE>
<TE>   I hope I can say the same, that I've stayed open to the
possibilities of wonders to come at Salt Lake City or Athens or
Dodger Stadium or Staples Center. It was just that time. This is
another.</TE>

<HD>Police Arrest Raiders' Russell in Sexual Assault Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Oakland Rai-der defensive tackle Darrell Russell and two other men
were arrested Friday in Alameda on suspicion of drugging and sexually
assaulting a 27-year-old woman.</LD>
<LD>   Russell, serving a one-year NFL suspension after testing positive
for the drug Ecstasy, had not been formally charged and was being
held in jail, Alameda County District Attorney Tom Orloff said.</LD>
<LD>   Alameda Police Lt. Jim Brock said Russell's bail was set at $1.2
million and that he would be charged with seven counts of rape.</LD>
<TE>   He said Russell knew the woman for about six months and apparently
called and asked her to meet him and some friends at the Starlight
Lounge in San Francisco on Wednesday. The woman told police Russell
bought her a drink just before closing time.</TE>
<TE>   Brock said the woman went to the hospital and was tested for rape.
He said physical evidence gathered there showed she had been
assaulted.</TE>
<TE>   During the arrest, police also collected "strong physical evidence
that corroborates the victim's account of what occurred," Brock said.</TE>
<TE>   The woman said she was assaulted at a home in Alameda where
Russell had been staying.</TE>
<TE>   A message was left for Russell's agent, Leigh Steinberg, on
Friday. The Raiders could not immediately be reached for comment.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Tries to Fulfill Gold Cup Dream</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Americans last won tournament almost 11 years ago.
Today they play Costa Rica for title at Rose Bowl.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the United States won its first and only Gold Cup title in July
of 1991, Landon Donovan was 9, growing up in Redlands with dreams of
one day being part of the U.S. national soccer team.</LD>
<LD>   Today, Donovan has the chance to help the U.S. win its second
regional championship when it plays Costa Rica at noon at the Rose
Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   It has been Donovan's inspired play, as much as anything else,
that has sparked the U.S. in the sixth biennial Gold Cup. He scored
the team's first goal in the 12-nation tournament, and his speed and
vision have added another dimension to the U.S. attack.</LD>
<TE>   In part, that has been because Coach Bruce Arena moved the
19-year-old from a forward position into an attacking midfield role.
Donovan is adapting well to the switch.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel more comfortable," he said after the U.S. had turned in
one of its most positive performances in some time in Wednesday
night's semifinal against Canada. "I'm getting used to [teammate]
Chris [Armas], and getting used to playing in the middle. Overall,
it's making me more relaxed and easier for me to play."</TE>
<TE>   With Donovan playing alongside Armas, Eddie Lewis and Cobi Jones
in midfield, behind a front line of Brian McBride and Josh Wolff, the
U.S. ran the Canadians ragged. The torrid pace continued when
DaMarcus Beasley replaced Lewis and Clint Mathis replaced Wolff, and
later still when Brian West replaced Jones.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we played great tonight," Donovan said Wednesday after
the Americans tied Canada, 0-0, but advanced on penalty kicks, 4-2.
"It was probably our best performance so far."</TE>
<TE>   In that game, U.S. goalkeeper Kasey Keller came up huge, flinging
himself to his left to save Kevin McKenna's penalty kick and, later,
throwing himself to his right to deny Tom Nsaliwa.</TE>
<TE>   Donovan, McBride, Jeff Agoos and Mathis were a perfect four of
four on the penalty kicks for the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   A similar strong showing will be needed today against the Costa
Ricans, who finished first in the North and Central American and
Caribbean (CONCACAF) region's World Cup qualifying group, ahead of
Mexico and the U.S. The Americans are 3-0 against Costa Rica in Gold
Cup play, but Costa Rica holds a 9-8-4 edge in the all-time series.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, who reaches a milestone today by playing in a record 150th
game for the U.S. national team, believes USA-Costa Rica is becoming
as good a series as USA-Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely a good rivalry," he said. "We've been battling
for the past couple World Cup [qualifying tournaments]. All the games
have been very close and hard fought."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. defense, which allowed South Korea one goal in the
opening game, has since shut out Cuba, El Salvador and Canada. Costa
Rica, however, presents a different series of challenges.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, Costa Rica Coach Alexandre Guimares has
better-quality players on his squad than any other U.S. opponent in
this Gold Cup. The Central Americans are experienced, gifted and
astute.</TE>
<TE>   Forwards Paulo Wanchope, Ronald Gomez and Hernan Medford present a
variety of problems with their speed and shooting power. Midfielder
Harold Wallace is also a threat in Guimares' fluid formation, in
which left back Carlos Castro frequently moves up to turn a 4-4-2
alignment into a more adventurous 3-5-2 formation.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. back line has not been severely tested during the
tournament. Agoos and Pablo Mastroeni have secured the center, while
Frankie Hejduk and Carlos Bocanegra have held down the right and left
back positions, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   When opponents have managed to break through, Keller has been
virtually unbeatable. And his best moments have come in one-on-one
confrontations.</TE>
<TE>   He stopped a penalty kick by South Korea's Yoo Sang-Chul in the
opening U.S. game before his two penalty saves Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Keller, who is battling Brad Friedel for the starting spot in the
World Cup, believes it's his turn to win.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had a few good tournaments in the Gold Cup," he said. "This
is my third time. The first time [in 1996], I finished third. The
second time [in 1998], I finished second. Now, I think it's time for
first."</TE>

<HD>Tagliabue Says League Needs Team in L.A.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke and Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>Commissioner Paul Tagliabue publicly acknowledged Friday that the
league needs a team in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, he offered no insight into how that would actually
happen.</LD>
<LD>   "At some point, we need to be there," he said of Los Angeles
during his annual Super Bowl news conference.</LD>
<TE>   Tagliabue cited several reasons why football should return to the
Southland.</TE>
<TE>   "We know we have many, many thousands of passionate fans in the
greater Los Angeles area," Tagliabue said. "They are big supporters
of our game. Our television audience there reflects that strong
interest. We have many great players from that area. We've had many
great teams there.</TE>
<TE>   "So we want to leave no stone unturned to respond to that
interest."</TE>
<TE>   But?</TE>
<TE>   "Exactly how we do that is something that we've been working on.
We are disappointed that we were not able to solve it in the last
decade."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   You want changes in instant replay? More coaches' challenges? No
replay in the final two minutes?</TE>
<TE>   Tagliabue said you're basically out of luck.</TE>
<TE>   "The likelihood is that I don't see a consensus of 24 clubs around
any substantial changes to the replay system," he said. "I think it's
working well."</TE>
<TE>   He said he didn't think coaches would receive more than two
challenges because it would protract the game. And he said he likes
the replay official being in control in the final two minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "The ultimate safeguard," he called it, although the Oakland
Raiders probably would disagree.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tagliabue confirmed that President Bush would not make it to
Sunday's game, although his father, former President George H.W.
Bush, will participate in the coin toss with former NFL star Roger
Staubach.</TE>
<TE>   Advantage, Patriots, because Coach Bill Belichick's father Steve
was a longtime Naval Academy assistant coach and scout, and Staubach
was Belichick's boyhood hero.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There might be more flexibility in the "Monday Night Football"
schedule.</TE>
<TE>   The league, which determines the Monday night lineup before the
season, was burned again this year when neither the Patriots nor the
upstart Chicago Bears appeared. Critics would like the schedule to be
adjusted during the season to provide for better matchups in the
final weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been discussing this internally," Tagliabue said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Times-Picayune in New Orleans printed a story this week
describing how many NFL teams give their allotted Super Bowl tickets
to high-paying sponsors, who then sell them to ticket brokers, who
sell them to the public for astronomical prices.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, that's how a $400 seat shows up in your classified ads for
$1,200.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of condemning that practice, Tagliabue surprisingly
defended it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not scalping, it's just recognizing the value of an
association with an NFL team," Tagliabue said. "I think there's some
misunderstanding as far as what's fair and appropriate, and what's
not."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One Patriot quarterback has beaten Kurt Warner twice.</TE>
<TE>   Third-string Damon Huard did it while playing for Frankfurt in the
league now named NFL Europe. Warner was playing for Amsterdam.</TE>

<HD>After Loss, Bruins Look to Rebound</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EUGENE, Ore.</DL>
<LD>A 29-point loss ought to stir anger in the vanquished. It did a year
ago, to the day.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA lost by 29 at California, got mad, beat No. 1 Stanford, went
home glad.</LD>
<LD>   However, the 91-62 humiliation at Oregon on Thursday prompted more
dismay than steam.</LD>
<TE>   Oh, forward Matt Barnes woke up sore Friday, but a neck spasm was
the reason. He is questionable for tonight's game at Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, the Bruins calmly tried to explain their poor
performance, and what they might do about it. It was less than
convincing.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody was playing real bad, but we've got to move on," center
Dan Gadzuric said. "You can't hold your head down and keep thinking
about it."</TE>
<TE>   Added forward Jason Kapono: "We're not a very consistent team
right now. Our minds weren't in the game throughout. I don't know
why. We should have been."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Steve Lavin is taking a clinical approach to discovering an
answer.</TE>
<TE>   "We respond by watching video, formulating a game plan, making
adjustments and continuing to try to become a better basketball
team," he said. "I've been saying we are a month or so from being
where we want to be, where we aren't beating ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Last season, fiery senior guard Earl Watson would get indignant
about a loss and passionate about turning it around. But Watson isn't
around anymore and UCLA (14-6, 6-4 in Pacific 10 Conference play)
continues to search for an identity. The full-court press came and
went. So did pushing the ball up the floor offensively.</TE>
<TE>   Lately, the Bruins believe they are best when deliberate. Making
six or seven passes and whittling down the shot clock leads to
high-percentage shots, the thinking goes.</TE>
<TE>   But against Oregon, the shots weren't falling and the Ducks
cranked up the pace in transition while the Bruins moseyed back on
defense at the same plodding pace they used on offense.</TE>
<TE>   All that shifting gears, the slowing down and speeding up, takes
more energy than going hard all the time. Doesn't a car use less gas
flying down the freeway than stopping and starting in city traffic?</TE>
<TE>   "It is difficult playing at two speeds," guard Billy Knight said.
"Sometimes you get confused and go too fast on offense.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now we look like a slow team, a half-court team. That seems
to suit us better. But we have to play defense hard all the time. We
can't dictate the pace our opponent will play."</TE>
<TE>   As for the video, Lavin must have recognized that whenever
Gadzuric had the ball at the high post, his defender backed off and
dared him to shoot. Often, the Bruin center didn't even notice
because his back was to the basket.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got to turn and face the basket and put the ball on the
floor or take the shot if it's there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Defensively, Gadzuric has gone from indiscriminately contesting
every venture into the key and racking up fouls to resembling a
matador with a cape.</TE>
<TE>   "He's in a Catch-22," Lavin said. "He wants to stay out of foul
trouble, but he has to play defense, because he does it well."</TE>
<TE>   The other glaring problem is a lack of production from freshman
point guard Cedric Bozeman, who lacks aggressiveness and creativity.
He's waiting for something to happen rather than making something
happen.</TE>
<TE>   Bozeman was scoreless for the third time in seven games, four of
which are losses. UCLA has lost three of four, an identity is out
there somewhere, but it remains elusive.</TE>

<LD>UCLA's 13 losses at McArthur Court since 1964-65, when Oregon
rejoined the Bruins in the same conference for the first time since
1958-59:</LD>
<LD>   1966: OREGON 79, UCLA 72</LD>
<LD>   The Bruins wouldn't lose again in conference for three years and
45 games.</LD>
<TE>   1970: OREGON 78, UCLA 65</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins were 21-0 and ranked No. 1 coming into this game. The
loss would also be only one of three during UCLA's run of seven NCAA
championship seasons which started in 1966-67.</TE>
<TE>   1974: OREGON 56, UCLA 51</TE>
<TE>   This game followed a 61-57 loss to Oregon State at Corvallis--the
Bruins' first conference back-to-back defeats in eight years.</TE>
<TE>   1977: OREGON 64, UCLA 55</TE>
<TE>   This was one of three losses in a Pacific 8 championship season
for the Bruins in Gene Bartow's second--and final--season as coach.
An NCAA tournament loss to Idaho State also had something to do with
Bartow's departure.</TE>
<TE>   1984: OREGON 62, UCLA 51</TE>
<TE>   This was one of eight Pacific 10 losses that sealed Larry Farmer's
fate as Bruin coach.</TE>
<TE>   1986: OREGON 80, UCLA 65</TE>
<TE>   This loss was the last in a 9-9 Pacific 10 season, the Bruins'
worst conference showing since 1952-53. Adding insult to injury, UCLA
lost its next game to UC Irvine in the first round of the NIT at
Pauley Pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   1990: OREGON 105, UCLA 99</TE>
<TE>   The 105 points, at the time, were the fifth most given up by the
Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   1994: OREGON 80, UCLA 79</TE>
<TE>   This loss prevented the Bruins from tying for the Pacific 10
championship and it altered their NCAA tournament regional seeding.
UCLA wound up having to travel to Oklahoma City for what amounted to
a home game for its first-round opponent Tulsa--a school that Ed
O'Bannon couldn't give the location of during the Selection Sunday
press conference. The Golden Hurricane blew past the Bruins, 112-102.</TE>
<TE>   1995: OREGON 82, UCLA 72</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins lost their Pac-10 opener, then reeled off 26
consecutive victories en route to their first NCAA championship since
1974-75.</TE>
<TE>   1997: OREGON 87, UCLA 85</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins overcame this overtime loss to the Ducks--and the
biggest loss in school history (48 points) to Stanford a month
earlier--to reach the NCAA tournament's round of eight.</TE>
<TE>   1998: OREGON 97, UCLA 81</TE>
<TE>   This lopsided loss was followed five games later by the
second-worst defeat (44 points) in school history to Duke. The
Bruins, however, managed to reach the NCAA tournament's round of 16.</TE>
<TE>   2000: OREGON 73, UCLA 58</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins shrugged off this loss, and seven others in the Pac-10,
to reach NCAA tournament round of 16.</TE>
<TE>   2002: OREGON 91, UCLA 62</TE>
<TE>   Thursday night's loss was the third-worst (29 points) in
conference for the Bruins since the Pac-10 was formed in 1978-79.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EUGENE, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Eleven games into the Pacific 10 Conference season and perennial
league also-rans USC and Oregon are playing for sole possession of
first place.</LD>
<LD>   "No one in their right mind would have expected it," USC senior
forward Sam Clancy said.</LD>
<LD>   "But that's the way it turned out. Oregon's a good team and I saw
that they weren't ranked. They don't get any respect either, so it's
the teams of no respect battling each other for first place."</LD>
<TE>   Oregon senior guard Frederick Jones said the Ducks have known for
a while that their winning mind-sets were anything but delusional.</TE>
<TE>   "The only people we've surprised is pretty much the media and the
other teams in the conference," Jones said. "We knew ourselves that
we were a good team. We're used to battling USC for those middle
spots [in the Pac-10 standings]. It's nice to see both of us now
fighting for that top spot."</TE>
<TE>   The 23rd-ranked Trojans, picked to finish third in the preseason
media poll, and the Ducks, picked sixth, are at the epicenter of a
Pac-10 power struggle that will unfold today at venerable McArthur
Court.</TE>
<TE>   Fresh off its blowout victory against UCLA, Oregon is the league's
highest-scoring team in conference games, averaging 88.9 points. USC
is second, averaging 83.1.</TE>
<TE>   "We like chaos and they like chaos," Oregon Coach Ernie Kent said.
"They like to play that way and we like to play that way. It will be
a great, entertaining game [with] a lot of up-and-down stuff and
that's when we're at our best, when we can get out in transition or
have to scramble and make plays because we're a very skilled
basketball team."</TE>
<TE>   But USC, which punishes teams with various and relentless
full-court press defenses, may not want to run with the Ducks or get
into a shootout with them.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans might actually ease up on the tempo and sit back in a
zone defense.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they slow the ball down at all or run a lot of
half-court sets," said Brandon Granville, the Trojans' senior point
guard. "They're at their best when they're pushing the ball and just
shooting, shooting open shots. We're still going to try to create
turnovers and that's probably going to be our main objective, but
it's also going to be to slow them down and get them into a situation
that they're not used to."</TE>
<TE>   USC is coming off a 64-51 victory against Oregon State on Thursday
night in which the Trojans committed a season high-tying 17
turnovers. The victory ensured the Trojans of at least a split on the
trip, the main goal for most Pac-10 teams on the road. In USC's two
previous weekends, it lost the first game--to Arizona and California,
respectively--but came back to beat Arizona State and Stanford two
days later.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no pressure on us," USC senior forward David Bluthenthal
said. "I think anytime there's no pressure on you, not that you
necessarily play looser, but we can just go out there and play our
game."</TE>
<TE>   Meaning the Trojans don't believe in the Mac Court Mystique, which
Oregon has proved with a 12-0 record at home this season.</TE>
<TE>   Kent, though, doesn't think the Trojans' senior trio of
Bluthenthal, Clancy and Granville will allow USC to play scared.</TE>
<TE>   "Those guys have been starting since [they were] freshmen," Kent
said. "They've been to the [National Invitation Tournament] they've
been to the NCAA, they've been deep into the tournament last year.
They should have beat Duke. I mean ... they won't get rattled."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, USC has enjoyed a modicum of success at Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   In coming back from 12 points down with 5:22 to play last season
to pull out an 87-80 victory in overtime, the Trojans have won three
of their last five games in Eugene.</TE>

<LD>The USC women's game Friday against Washington was the start of five
of seven at home. But instead of moving forward in the Pacific 10
Conference, the Trojans took a step back with a 69-63 loss to the
Huskies before 500 at the Sports Arena.</LD>
<LD>   Former Lake Forest El Toro High star Giuliana Mendiola led the
Huskies (12-8 overall, 7-4 in the Pac-10) with 22 points--20 in the
second half--to tie her career high. Her layup with 9:19 left in the
second half broke a 49-49 tie, and put Washington ahead for good.</LD>
<LD>   "It was exciting to play in front of my family," said Mendiola,
who made nine of 11 shots and had six assists in front of about 50
friends and relatives. "My team was looking for me, and fortunately
the shots went in."</LD>
<TE>   USC (11-10, 7-5), which led 33-31 at halftime, dropped into a tie
for fifth place in conference and the loss left the Trojans with
plenty to ponder.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans can dwell on wasting a 19-point, 14-rebound effort by
Ebony Hoffman, and 17 points by Aisha Hollans. Or how Washington
scoring 24 points off USC's 19 turnovers negated the Trojans' 39-34
rebounding edge.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to grow up as a team sooner or later," Trojan Coach
Chris Gobrect said.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Terry</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA 79, Washington State 55--Reserves Brianna Winn and Sissy
Pickett each scored a career-high 13 points to lead the Bruins to a
Pac-10 victory in front of 1,536 at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Winn, a freshman guard, scored eight of her points in the first
half, when the Bruins (6-14, 3-9) led by as many as 26 points.
Picket, a freshman center, scored all of hers in the second half,
including six in a row during a 26-8 run that put the Bruins up by
their largest margin, 29 points at 70-41 with 6:15 to play.</TE>
<TE>   That sequence came after UCLA went scoreless for the first 4:43 of
the second half, allowing the Cougars (2-19, 0-11) to cut a 22-point
halftime deficit to nine at 42-33 with 15:33 left.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA scored 17 of the next 23 points to go ahead by 21 at 60-39
and never looked back. The victory ended a losing streak at five.</TE>
<TE>   Francine McCurtain had 14 points for the Cougars, who have lost 16
in a row since an 80-72 victory over Gonzaga on Nov. 29.</TE>
<TE>   Lauren Peterson</TE>

<TE>   TOP 25 GAMES</TE>
<TE>   No. 7 Purdue 82, Michigan State 66--Shereka Wright scored 18
points and the Boilermakers (17-3, 8-2 Big Ten) used a 20-3 run late
in the game to hold off the Spartans (14-8, 4-7) at East Lansing,
Mich., for their sixth consecutive victory. Purdue forced 20
turnovers and was 26 for 32 at the free-throw line.</TE>
<TE>   No. 21 Old Dominion 70, Rutgers 48--Lucienne Berthieu had 20
points and 10 rebounds and the Lady Monarchs (14-5) used a 16-0 run
in the second half to pull away from the Scarlet Knights (7-13) in a
nonconference game at Piscataway, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Old Dominion held Rutgers without a field goal for 13 minutes
while breaking the game open.</TE>

<LD>A Buena High School custodian was arrested Friday at the Ventura
school on suspicion of possessing child pornography.</LD>
<LD>   John Gomez Ruiz, 41, was taken into custody after detectives from
the Ventura County Sheriff's Department searched his Saticoy home and
his school work station. Detectives said they found evidence of child
pornography at the home. They discovered adult pornography and
suspected illegal drugs at his school work station, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura Unified School District Supt. Trudy Tuttle Arriaga issued
a statement saying it was the first the district had heard of the
custodian's alleged activities and that there is no indication any
students were involved.</LD>
<TE>   Ruiz was placed on administrative leave while the district and
police investigate the case, Arriaga said.</TE>

<HD>Trucking Firm to Be Tried for Manslaughter</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Westlake Village trucking company facing manslaughter charges in
connection with a February 2000 crash that killed one of its drivers
lost a motion this week to dismiss the case.</LD>
<LD>   R.P. Cummings Inc. had argued there was not enough evidence to
hold the corporation criminally liable.</LD>
<LD>   But Ventura County Superior Court Judge Barry B. Klopfer ruled the
firm could be prosecuted. Klopfer cited the company's history of
brake repairs as well as its directives to drivers ordering them not
to document problems found during inspections.</LD>
<TE>   The ruling Thursday is the latest twist in an unusual case.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, another judge dismissed the criminal complaint.</TE>
<TE>   But the Ventura County district attorney's office appealed, and
Presiding Superior Court Judge Bruce A. Clark ruled there was
sufficient evidence to prosecute the company.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Hildebrand, a 41-year-old Ventura resident, died when he
lost control of a company-owned tanker truck on a steep grade near
Santa Paula and crashed into a creek. Prosecutors contend the brakes
failed because of poor maintenance.</TE>

<HD>Enron Probe Reaches Into White House</HD>
<DH>Energy: The Justice Department asks Bush's staff to preserve all
documents relating to firm, including e-mails and records of contacts
with company officials.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The government's criminal probe into Enron Corp.'s collapse reached
into the White House on Friday, as the Justice Department asked the
president's staff to preserve all Enron-related documents, including
e-mails and records that might show staff contacts with company
representatives.</LD>
<LD>   The action marked the first time that the Justice Department has
interceded with the White House in the Enron investigation.</LD>
<LD>   Presidential spokeswoman Claire Buchan said the White House "will, of
course, fully comply" with the request, made by Christopher A. Wray, the
principal associate deputy attorney general.</LD>
<TE>   Wray's request asks the White House to "ensure the retention of these
records," which might shed further light on the extent of any contacts
between White House officials and Enron.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department also sent similar letters Friday to other
government departments and agencies, Bush administration officials said.
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, would not say how
many or which agencies received the letters.</TE>
<TE>   Bush aides emphasized that the request for the preservation of
Enron-related documents, including e-mails, did not suggest a suspicion
of criminal activity by current or former government officials.</TE>
<TE>   In any criminal or civil investigation, "it's routine to ask people to
maintain documents that may become relevant down the road," said one Bush
staffer.</TE>
<TE>   The General Accounting Office, the investigative agency of Congress,
said this week that it would sue the White House for refusing to disclose
information about the meetings of Vice President Dick Cheney's energy
task force. Cheney has said he and his staff met with Enron
representatives on six occasions.</TE>
<TE>   The White House has steadfastly spurned questions from reporters about
the extent of its contacts with Enron executives, characterizing such
probes as a fishing expedition.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, however, it has disclosed that Commerce Secretary Don
Evans and Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill fielded telephone calls from
now-ousted Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay.</TE>
<TE>   Both Cabinet secretaries said they took no actions to help Lay, a
personal friend and financial supporter of President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Wray's request seeks documentation of White House-Enron contacts going
back to Jan. 1, 1999--when Bill Clinton was president. Thus the records
also could detail contacts between Enron and the Clinton White House,
which would underscore the Bush administration's contention that such
contacts are not unusual.</TE>
<TE>   As the dimensions of the Enron debacle have spread, the White House
and Bush have found themselves increasingly on the defensive. Although
there have been no specific allegations of wrongdoing, Enron's donations
to Bush's political campaigns--totaling about $700,000 over the
years--have fueled a perception that it has enjoyed special access to
this White House.</TE>
<TE>   In part to inoculate himself and other Republicans from the potential
political fallout from the Enron controversy, Bush on Friday proposed a
package of pension reforms designed to prevent a recurrence of Enron's
Dec. 2 bankruptcy, which left thousands of workers not only jobless but
also holding all but worthless retirement accounts.</TE>
<TE>   At the White House, the Justice Department letter was addressed to
Alberto R. Gonzales, White House counsel. The president's chief lawyer
quickly circulated an "administrative alert" to White House aides,
directing all staffers to comply.</TE>
<TE>   The White House on Friday night released copies of Wray's letter and
Gonzales' internal office memorandum.</TE>
<TE>   Wray's letter to Gonzales, dated Friday, notes that a Justice
Department task force and the FBI are conducting a criminal investigation
"of various matters relating to Enron Corp." and adds:</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that documents in the possession of the White House, its
staff and employees may contain information relevant to our investigation
into the financial condition of Enron and statements made by Enron
employees and agents relating to its financial condition and business
interests."</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, Wray is asking the White House and other agencies to
preserve "all documents, electronic records and correspondence, computer
records and storage devices, notes and memorandum which relate in any way
to Enron's financial condition and/or business interests, including
contacts with its officers, employees, agents or other representatives
and any individuals acting officially or unofficially, directly or
indirectly on behalf of Enron about these matters."</TE>
<TE>   Wray asks the White House to err on the side of caution in retaining
possibly relevant materials, saying:</TE>
<TE>   "Although federal law imposes broad requirements for preserving
documents even apart from the needs of any investigation, in the present
circumstances all [underlined for emphasis] documents relating to these
subjects should be preserved, even if there would be a question whether
the document would be a presidential or federal record or even if its
destruction might otherwise be permitted."</TE>
<TE>   Wray suggests, but does not state, that the department or the FBI
eventually will want access to those records, writing:</TE>
<TE>   "At this time, we are only requesting that you ensure the retention of
these records."</TE>
<TE>   Gonzales' administrative alert to White House aides says, "You are
directed to comply with the Department of Justice's request in all
respects."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Justice Departments and independent counsels sought White
House documents related to the Whitewater investigation of President
Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and the Reagan
administration's Iran-Contra scandal.</TE>
<TE>   In another Enron development Friday, lawmakers raised questions about
the company's much-anticipated internal investigation into its financial
and accounting problems.</TE>
<TE>   Two key congressmen complained that Herbert Winokur--a member of a
panel created by Enron's board of directors to look into the company's
collapse--is an Enron board member who led its finance committee and
approved many of the transactions under review.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Winokur is essentially investigating his own actions and
approving or disapproving the resulting report," wrote Reps. John D.
Dingell (D-Mich.) and Peter Deutsch (D-Fla.) in a letter Friday to
William Powers, dean of the University of Texas law school.</TE>
<TE>   Powers is chairman of Enron's internal investigating committee.</TE>
<TE>   Critics also have raised questions about Powers' independence. Powers
has had responsibility for law school fund-raising since he became dean
in September 2000. Enron has contributed more than $50,000 to the law
school since he took the post, bringing its total contributions to the
law school to more than $276,000, university officials said.</TE>
<TE>   But Powers downplayed suggestions of a conflict of interest.</TE>
<TE>   "As with any report by a committee of a board, readers can and should
evaluate the fact that it was written by people commissioned by the
company," Powers said in a statement. "Certainly the board had a right,
indeed a responsibility, to find out what happened."</TE>
<TE>   The report is expected to be released over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   An Enron spokeswoman referred inquiries to an attorney representing
Enron's board of directors, who did not return a phone call.</TE>
<TE>   Winokur is one of three members of the investigating panel. The other
is Raymond Troubh, a New York financial consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Friday, congressional investigators said they expected former
Enron executives Andrew S. Fastow and Michael Kopper--who headed some of
the firm's off-the-books partnerships--to appear next week at a hearing
by a panel of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The two men are
expected to plead the 5th Amendment, investigators said.</TE>

<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>An e-mail message believed to have been sent by the kidnappers of
Wall Street Journal correspondent Daniel Pearl claimed Friday that he had
been killed because their demands for the release of Pakistani terror
suspects had not been met.</LD>
<LD>   "We have killed Mr. Danny Now Mr bush can find his body in the grave
yards of Karachi we have thrown him there," the message read. "The Reason
why we killed him is because US killed so many people in Afghanistan and
other parts of the world."</LD>
<LD>   The claim about Pearl, who disappeared last week in the port city of
Karachi, could not be verified.</LD>
<TE>   By this morning, police said, officers had searched about 300
cemeteries and had turned up nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Police sources in Karachi early today confirmed that they had raided a
house in the city and seized a computer that they believed were used to
send some of the e-mails. They declined to elaborate on the development,
and there was no immediate indication that the raid had shed any light on
Pearl's fate.</TE>
<TE>   The rambling, randomly punctuated missive, which appeared similar in
style to earlier messages, said Pearl was "collateral damage" like that
inflicted by the U.S. bombing raids in neighboring Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The e-mail added a warning to other U.S. citizens in Pakistan: "now we
are thirsty for the blood of another American. When US attacked
Afghanistan and killed so many people they did not think about this that
there would be no place for Americans outside America. Now they must
leave Pakistan because we will kill more Americans as we find them."</TE>
<TE>   Hope emerged Friday evening when various reports surfaced of a demand
for a $2-million ransom for Pearl's freedom. But as the night wore on,
those reports began to unravel. The U.S. Consulate in Karachi, the U.S.
Embassy in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, and the inspector general of
police in Sindh province, where Karachi is located, all denied reports
that they had received such a call.</TE>
<TE>   "The Pakistani authorities are taking it seriously, and they are in
the process of searching graveyards to assess its validity," U.S.
Consulate spokesman Lonnie Kelley said of the e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   The Wall Street Journal said in a statement: "We have seen the latest
reports, and we remain hopeful that they are not true."</TE>
<TE>   But an editor at the Wall Street Journal said the newspaper fears that
the e-mail saying Pearl had been killed is "credible."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Wentworth, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, said he
had no knowledge of a report that an e-mail ransom note was sent to the
mission there. "The only e-mail I've seen is the one sent to various news
organizations claiming he is dead," Wentworth said. "There are a lot of
rumors around, and we're working with Pakistani authorities to try to
nail them down."</TE>
<TE>   In Karachi, Inspector General Syed Kamel Shah said that he had been
unable to confirm any ransom demand but that his department was
continuing to investigate the reports.</TE>
<TE>   "We're investigating vigorously," Shah said.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, where the case has risen steadily on the foreign policy
agenda, officials at the White House and State Department said U.S.
officials continued working with Pakistani authorities to find Pearl but
had no progress to report late Friday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   CIA counter-terrorism experts examined the new e-mail "to see if they
can determine if it's authentic," one official said.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that the message had fewer misspellings and other errors than
the previous e-mails. "So there are some inconsistencies," said the
official, who asked not to be identified. "It's kind of confusing. It's
difficult to say if it's a hoax or not."</TE>
<TE>   Hours before the discovery of the latest e-mail, President Bush had
promised a dogged pursuit of any leads in the case.</TE>
<TE>   "We are working with the Pakistan government to chase down any leads
possible--for example, trying to follow the trail of the e-mails that
have been sent, with the sole purpose of saving this man, of finding him
and rescuing him," Bush said during a White House appearance with
Jordan's King Abdullah II.</TE>
<TE>   Dubbing themselves the National Movement for the Restoration of
Pakistani Sovereignty, Pearl's captors demanded the release of all
Pakistani citizens held by U.S. troops at the Guantanamo Bay naval base
in Cuba, as well as the release of the former Taliban ambassador to
Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Before the latest e-mail became public, frustration was evident among
Pakistani officials at the kidnappers' unorthodox methods, including
their steadfast reclusion in cyberspace, where they masked the route and
origin of their e-mails, using screen names such as "kidnapperguy" and
"strangepeoples."</TE>
<TE>   "We're keeping the Americans informed of our progress, but we're not
making much headway," acknowledged a senior Pakistani military source,
who declined to be identified. "These are smart people. Long before we
hear from them, they are spreading their information to the international
media. They refused to get into any personal or telephone contact with us
or anyone else."</TE>
<TE>   Expanded police questioning of known militant group leaders and
criminals in Karachi has produced little to go on, Interior Ministry
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Terrorism experts offered their own theories.</TE>
<TE>   "My own mind is the government has not made up its mind which group it
is and it's very embarrassed," said Rasul Bakhsh Rais, an expert on
terrorist organizations and director of the Area Studies Center at the
Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad.</TE>
<TE>   Rais speculated that the so-called National Movement for the
Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty, a name that has appeared only in
the first e-mail message from the kidnappers, is "not a legitimate
organization" but could be a surviving cell of Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda
terrorist network, perhaps combined with a sectarian group operating in
Karachi.</TE>
<TE>   Rais said the captors were apparently looking to send a message to the
U.S. and to Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf that the network is
still alive and capable of attacks on American interests, despite the
U.S. military campaign and Musharraf's crackdown on Islamic extremist
groups. The captors' shifting agenda is just a "pretext to present
themselves as a patriotic element" and portray Musharraf as a lackey to
U.S. interests in the region, Rais said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the top local suspects is a radical element within the Mohajir
Quami Movement, also known as the Muttahida Quami Movement. It is an
Indian Muslim migrant group well funded by money it extorts from Karachi
business interests.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Rogers, a social scientist at the University of Bradford in
Britain who studies the changing nature of political violence, said the
kidnappers' method of e-mailing demands yet never opening a direct
negotiation channel is unusual.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks as though it's something new," he said in a telephone
interview Friday. "I've seen no parallel."</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani Foreign Affairs Minister Abdus Sattar said his government
had information linking suspects in the kidnapping with "certain
individuals occupying important positions in the Indian government."</TE>
<TE>   India responded by demanding that he name the officials, and called
the allegation a "grand charade."</TE>

<HD>Israeli Reservists Reject West Bank, Gaza Duty</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Army relieves some dissenters of their commands. Move
follows outcry over 'oppression' of Palestinians.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>What began with a terse note tacked to a Tel Aviv University
bulletin board has mushroomed into the most serious protest movement
against the Israeli army's conduct in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 16
months of fighting with the Palestinians--and it is coming from soldiers
themselves.</LD>
<LD>   In newspaper ads, more than 100 reserve combat officers and soldiers
have denounced the army for what they call immoral behavior toward
Palestinian civilians and have vowed that they will no longer serve in
the West Bank or Gaza. Alarmed by the declaration, the army has begun
relieving some of the dissenters of their commands and is threatening to
court-martial them.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking to Israel Radio on Friday, Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, the army's
chief of staff, said that if the protesters were "ideologically
motivated" by a political view that Jewish settlements should be
abandoned and the occupied territories handed to the Palestinians, then
"this is not only refusal but grave sedition."</LD>
<TE>   The dissent has touched off a firestorm of debate in a nation where
army service is a pillar of citizenship and where the conflict with the
Palestinians that erupted in September 2000 is seen by most as an
existential threat that mandates national unity.</TE>
<TE>   The men represent a minuscule fraction of the tens of thousands of
Israelis who perform reserve duty annually, but their status as
long-serving reservists in combat units gives their criticism weight both
inside the army and in Israeli society.</TE>
<TE>   The movement started when two reservists posted a note at Tel Aviv
University, where they study, that said: "If you are thinking about
refusal and you're having a hard time with it, call us."</TE>
<TE>   Within 10 days, more than 30 reserve personnel--many of them officers
in combat units--had called the attached number. More than 50 officers
and soldiers signed an ad published Jan. 25 in the mass-circulation daily
Yediot Aharonot, saying they will not serve. On Friday, more than 100
reservists signed a reprint of the letter that ran again in Yediot.</TE>
<TE>   "We hereby declare that we will no longer fight the war for the
settlements' safety," the reservists wrote. "We will no longer fight
beyond the Green Line [Israel's pre-1967 border] with the purpose of
controlling, expelling, starving and humiliating an entire people."</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers said that they will do reserve duty "in any assignment
that serves the defense of the state of Israel" but that "the assignment
of occupation and oppression does not serve this cause, and we will have
no part in it."</TE>
<TE>   In a poll of 504 Israelis conducted by Israel Radio, whose results
were aired Thursday, about 30% of those questioned said they supported
the reservists' protest. Forty-five percent said they believed more
reservists will join the movement and refuse service in the West Bank and
Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   "We relate to this phenomenon seriously and severely," Mofaz told
Israel Radio. "Why seriously? Because some of those officers who wrote
the dissenting letter also volunteered in the past to take on
responsibility. They contributed to state security on many occasions.
They led soldiers to battle. They endangered their lives."</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister Ariel Sharon shared Mofaz's ambivalence about the
dissenters.</TE>
<TE>   "I see this as a very serious matter," Sharon told Yediot in an
interview Friday. "If the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers don't
carry out the decisions of the elected government, that will be the
beginning of the end of the democracy." But because the men are combat
veterans, Sharon said, he is considering meeting with them to discuss
their grievances.</TE>
<TE>   Although they may not change the government's policy, the protesters
have already sparked the first real public debate here about the army's
conduct toward Palestinian civilians--and about whether the military is
routinely asking troops to carry out illegal orders--since the
Palestinian revolt began.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews with Israel Television and the Maariv newspaper, retired
Adm. Ami Ayalon, former head of the Shin Bet, Israel's internal security
service, said he disagrees with the reservists' public protest. But
Ayalon also expressed surprise that more soldiers have not refused to
carry out what he said are "blatantly illegal orders" in the West Bank
and Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   "From what I know of what is going on on the ground, many illegal
orders are being issued and there are very few cases of refusal," Ayalon
told Maariv. "That means that too few soldiers refused to carry out too
many illegal orders. When we kill unarmed children, that is an illegal
order."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the dissenting reservists have given harrowing accounts to
Israeli reporters of acts they said they committed against Palestinian
civilians in the West Bank and Gaza, acts that some of them said they
feared constituted war crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "We were raised to be officers with values, and they've turned us into
combatants who deal in bloodshed and war crimes," said Lt. David
Zonshein, a 28-year-old software engineer who was one of the founders of
the movement. Zonshein told Yediot that he hopes to sign up 500
reservists in the movement because "when we reach 500 people, they will
have to decide--occupation or the IDF."</TE>
<TE>   The dissenters' allegations that troops are routinely asked to carry
out illegal orders have been strenuously denied by Mofaz, the army
spokesman's office and other reservists. They all insist that troops are
serving legally in the territories and that instances of abuse cited by
the protesting reservists are aberrations that are punished when
uncovered by army investigators.</TE>
<TE>   "When there are illegal orders with a black flag, it is right not to
obey them," Mofaz said. "But I must say that in the fighting that has
been going on for over 16 months . . . I can say with full confidence
that very few armies in the world would . . . behave on the same moral
and value level as IDF soldiers and commanders do in the field."</TE>
<TE>   In the past in Israel, dissenters have refused to serve in various
wars, as well as in the West Bank and Gaza after the Jewish state
occupied those areas in the wake of the June 1967 Middle East War.
Usually, however, such acts of protest have been carried out on an
individual basis, rarely as a collective, public act.</TE>
<TE>   "These aren't just 50 guys," said Peretz Kidron, spokesman for Yesh
Gvul, a leftist group that counsels individual soldiers on refusing to
serve in the West Bank and Gaza. "They made a point of mentioning their
ranks and the reserve unit they serve in, and they are all with highly
regarded combat units. This is an elite group."</TE>
<TE>   Two other groups of reservists responded to the dissenters with their
own ads Friday in Yediot.</TE>
<TE>   "We are ashamed of you as fighters whose duty it is to fight alongside
you, and we regret the decision of the army and state, who mistakenly
deemed you worthy of the right to serve and command," wrote one group of
nearly 100 reserve officers and soldiers in an open letter to the
protesters.</TE>
<TE>   "We are opposed to the explicit and implicit attempts to describe the
IDF's actions to protect security throughout Israel, including the
territories, as a war crime or illegal command," wrote a second group of
more than 100 reserve officers and soldiers in another letter. "We trust
the IDF's morality and that of the unity government guiding it, even if
we do not agree with every step of policy."</TE>
<TE>   Nir Abudram, one of the counter-movement's founders, told Yediot
Aharonot that his group, the Right to Serve, had collected more than
100,000 signatures in a single day of canvassing.</TE>
<TE>   The dissenting reservists are refusing to speak with foreign
reporters. A spokesman for the group, however, agreed to respond to some
of the criticisms in a chat with a Los Angeles Times reporter.</TE>
<TE>   "Our statements are aimed against a political system and not the
army," said Amit Mashiah, who is also a reservist. "The Israeli army is
the people's army. It is based on citizens who care about their country.
We never criticized the army--we criticized the people who sent them
there. Our movement is a part of a struggle in order to determine the
face of our society. We believe that what we are doing is for our society
and for our country."</TE>
<TE>   Mashiah said that the group decided not to speak to foreign media
because it believes "this is an internal Israeli issue" that should be
debated within Israeli society. "We don't want to do anything that would
harm Israel," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But in interviews with Israeli reporters, the dissenters have said
that they were asked too many times to carry out orders that violated
their consciences.</TE>
<TE>   "I stopped ambulances at checkpoints as a paratroop officer," Zonshein
told talk-show host Yair Lapid after the army relieved Zonshein of his
command last week. "I stripped areas clean of groves and trees that are
people's livelihood as a paratroop officer. I entered houses and
threatened the father as a paratroop officer, and I fired at
neighborhoods as a paratroop officer, and, as such, I signed the letter,
to say: Enough."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, Zonshein said, he has allowed Palestinians in distress to
pass through roadblocks "against regulations" stipulating that ambulances
are supposed to coordinate their passage with the army in advance of
arriving at roadblocks.</TE>
<TE>   Israelis who criticize the dissenters, Zonshein said, "must remember
that everyone who signed the letter is willing to be killed for this
country--but there are basic moral conditions. Not everything is allowed,
not even in war."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, reserve Col. Ron Shechner said he views the protest
movement as dangerous to both the army and Israeli democracy. It is
important, Shechner said, that the men who signed the ad be disciplined
for their act of disobedience.</TE>
<TE>   "There are moral dilemmas in every war," Shechner said. "But this
group of reservists is dishonest and ungrateful. Claiming that the army
is immoral is false. It is a lie. We are dealing with this whole
difficult, complex situation with silk gloves, in a surgical way. We are
endangering our own lives so as not to hurt innocent people."</TE>

<HD>Arrests on Border Fall After 9/11</HD>
<DH>Migrants: No clear cause is cited, but the U.S. economy, optimism
in Mexico and fear of detention are called possible factors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Arrests of undocumented immigrants on the U.S. border from Southern
California to the tip of Texas have fallen sharply since the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, in some areas dropping more than 50% as officials
report remarkably fewer people trying to slip into the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities in Washington and along the nearly 2,000-mile-long border
say that, while the sputtering U.S. economy and increasing optimism in
Mexico have contributed to the surprising decrease, the growing specter
that the United States is no longer a haven likely is playing a
significant role. Officials also say tougher inspections at the border
are a factor.</LD>
<LD>   Immigrants from Mexico and Central America are telling U.S. Border
Patrol agents and groups that work with migrants that they fear future
terrorist strikes and are concerned about reports of hundreds of Middle
Eastern immigrants who have been detained incommunicado since the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   "There is a very real ripple effect down here," said Doug Mosier, a
Border Patrol official in El Paso.</TE>
<TE>   Federal District Judge Filemon Vela in Brownsville, Texas--the
southernmost point along the border--said Mexican news media have
aggressively covered the Sept. 11 attacks and that, though New York and
Washington are far away, the story has hit home.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the newspapers and stations in Mexico show a lot of this,
sometimes more than we do, and they publish gory pictures and stuff like
that," Vela said.</TE>
<TE>   "I watch a lot of Spanish-speaking television, and they cover it as
much or more than we do. The fear is out there."</TE>
<TE>   The Border Patrol--this country's front guard in trying to stem the
flow of illegal immigration--started seeing declines in arrests shortly
after three hijacked airliners slammed into the World Trade Center and
the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Border Patrol officials released statistics Friday showing that the
overall drop in illegal border crossings was 45%, with 176,097 arrests
between Oct. 1 and Tuesday, compared with 320,367 for the same period a
year ago.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, the decreases have been equally dramatic.
Arrests fell 39% in San Diego, bringing down apprehensions in that busy
international zone to a 27-year low. El Centro saw a 59% drop.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, large numbers of undocumented workers usually return to
Mexico for the Christmas holidays, then return to the U.S. border by
early January. That did not happen this year.</TE>
<TE>   No one seems to be able to cite a single cause for the decline. Some
point to economic problems in the U.S., much of it a direct result of the
Sept. 11 attacks. Others said some Mexicans are expressing a renewed hope
that conditions will improve in their country under President Vicente
Fox.</TE>
<TE>   Still other officials, while saying the aftereffects of Sept. 11 are
inescapable for anyone trying to enter this country, disagree about how
much undocumented workers really know about Sept. 11 and whether that
alone has been enough to keep them out.</TE>
<TE>   Some said the migrants typically are poor and have had little
schooling. They disagreed with Vela, saying migrants may know little
about the attacks and that, even if they did, their desire for jobs and
money still would propel them north.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of them, probably most of them, have an elementary education,"
said San Diego Border Patrol Agent Tony Hicks. "They are aware of 9/11,
though many may just know that a building went down in New York."</TE>
<TE>   They also disagree about how much longer the decline in arrests will
last. The number of border arrests for some offenses, such as immigrant
smuggling, has remained constant, while there has been an increase in the
number of drug seizures.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a Wild West week this week," Mosier in El Paso said. "We
had some drug smugglers take some shots at agents, and they shot out two
of the side rear windows on their vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody got hurt, and the smugglers were able to get back into Mexico.
But they left behind 219 pounds of marijuana."</TE>
<TE>   In New Mexico, John Crews, the Las Cruces branch supervisor for the
U.S. attorney's office, said that, while illegal entry arrests are down,
drug seizures and other cases still are being prosecuted at a steady
rate.</TE>
<TE>   He said Sept. 11 brought an increase in police vigilance at the
border, with some vacations and days off being canceled. "All the cars
and every person are being inspected," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're trying to maintain a larger, more visible presence on the
border and at all the checkpoints."</TE>
<TE>   Those patrols could increase even sooner, as the Bush administration
plans to use the military to help police the border and the Pentagon is
devising a plan for enhanced border security as part of the homeland
security effort.</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego, illegal entry arrests have been declining for five
years. Hicks said the steady drop there is the result of Operation
Gatekeeper and other Border Patrol initiatives to beef up patrols.</TE>
<TE>   "It's enforcement and the manpower," he said. "And we are continuing
to build our infrastructure and our fences."</TE>
<TE>   Roberto Martinez, recently retired director of a border project for
the American Friends Service Committee in San Diego, said he believes
migrants still are getting through the border. Migrants are continuing to
go around U.S. border checkpoints and through isolated mountain and
desert terrain to reach the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Just this week, five Mexicans were found dead after they apparently
hid in a railroad coal car in Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez's work drew him close to many migrants and their families,
and in the last few months, he said, he has come to believe that "9/11 is
making a bad situation for us worse."</TE>
<TE>   The reason, he said, is that Mexican migrants worry about ending up
like the Middle Easterners rounded up in this country after Sept. 11 and
held in jails in New York and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "Muslim detainees are complaining in New York, and that's nothing new
for us," Martinez said. "They are going through the fear factor that
Mexicans have undergone for years."</TE>
<TE>   In McAllen, Texas, federal public defender Tom Lindemuth said his
seven staff attorneys have seen their monthly caseloads drop from 50 to
40 clients each.</TE>
<TE>   "It took a nose-dive," he said, explaining that arrests are down
because fewer people are trying to get through.</TE>
<TE>   "The police are inspecting people very closely at the border now. They
don't assume you're a U.S. citizen anymore, even if you say you are. The
lines are a lot longer. There's almost always a pedestrian line at the
bridge.</TE>
<TE>   "It is more of a hassle to get across."</TE>

border, tighter security at checkpoints has increased wait times.</CP>

<HD>A Field of Glory, and Pain</HD>
<DH>The 1972 Miami Dolphins were something special, going undefeated
and winning the Super Bowl. But the many debilitating injuries the
players suffered are still taking their toll.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROB FERNAS</AU>
<AU>DAN ARRITT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill Stanfill, who played defensive end, can't turn his head more
than a few inches because of fused vertebrae in his neck. When he puts
his car in reverse, he says, "I ease back until I bump into something."</LD>
<LD>   Teammate Manny Fernandez, a defensive tackle, has given up tennis,
handball, golf and running because of chronic pain in his knees. "I can
walk," he says. "That's about it."</LD>
<LD>   Larry Csonka, the hard-charging running back on that same 1972 Miami
Dolphin football team, never takes off his Super Bowl ring: A mangled
knuckle won't allow it.</LD>
<TE>   Nick Buoniconti, the star linebacker, gets around on a titanium hip.</TE>
<TE>   They achieved perfection on the field with a 17-0 record, the only
undefeated season in the history of the National Football League. But
almost 30 years later, many of the '72 Dolphins are paying a steep price
for the sacrifices made in the name of winning.</TE>
<TE>   They represent a side of pro football invisible to the 80 million fans
who will tune in Sunday to watch Super Bowl XXXVI. They live with pain
and, in some cases, disability. Broken-down body parts serve as reminders
of the beatings they took: reconstructed knees, replaced hips, sore
backs, torn-up shoulders, stiff necks, bum ankles, bent arms and crooked
fingers.</TE>
<TE>   Remembered for their grit and grace on the field, they are growing old
before their time. Some limp when they walk, ache when the weather gets
cold or struggle to enjoy simple pleasures like playing a game of catch
with their children.</TE>
<TE>   In their stiffness and pain, the former Dolphins have plenty of
company. Johnny Unitas, arguably the greatest quarterback in NFL history,
can barely use the right hand with which he rifled passes for the
Baltimore Colts. Jim Otto, a rock of consistency during 15 years as
center for the Oakland Raiders, has seen his body chipped away by 40
surgeries--30 on his knees, both of which have been replaced.</TE>
<TE>   Such long-term damage reflects football's violent nature and its
tradition of playing while injured. Battered bones, joints and muscles
were not given time to heal. Instead, they were subjected to fresh
pounding.</TE>
<TE>   "Guys played hurt," said Sonny Jurgensen, the Hall of Fame quarterback
for the Washington Redskins who played in the NFL from 1957 to 1974. "You
were letting your team down if you didn't play hurt."</TE>
<TE>   The risk of injury is just as great today.</TE>
<TE>   "As players get bigger, stronger and faster, the impact of injuries
certainly is not going to go away," said Dr. Rob Huizenga, an assistant
professor of medicine at UCLA who was team doctor for the Los Angeles
Raiders from 1983 to 1991. "People are still playing in pain."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest differences from 30 years ago, Huizenga said, are improved
surgical techniques and rehabilitation. In the 1970s, a knee injury could
end or significantly diminish a player's career. Today, he could return
from surgery that same season.</TE>
<TE>   But players still risk the kind of long-term damage that has hobbled
the ex-Dolphins. Faster recovery from surgery means players return sooner
to the game's jarring collisions. "I'm not sure we've made any
advancements over the long haul," Huizenga said.</TE>
<TE>Many Players Show No Sign of Bitterness</TE>
<TE>   Remarkably, many of the '72 Dolphins express no regrets. No evident
bitterness taints their memories of that glorious season, which
culminated in a 14-7 victory over the Redskins in Super Bowl VII at the
Coliseum in January 1973.</TE>
<TE>   Fernandez, 55, who sells title insurance and lives in Cooper City,
Fla., endured 12 surgeries as a player, starting in high school. But, he
says, playing on two NFL championship teams--the Dolphins won Super Bowl
VIII as well--made it worthwhile. "It has made other aspects of my life
easier."</TE>
<TE>   His body bears the scars of eight NFL seasons: a left knee that has
been operated on five times, leaving it with no cartilage; a
deteriorating right knee; bone spurs in his shoulders, each of which has
been surgically repaired twice; a worn-out ankle; and a back that needs a
third surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Kuechenberg, 54, a construction consultant in South Florida,
suffers from double vision. Repeated blows to the head during 14 seasons
of blocking defensive linemen frayed his optic nerves.</TE>
<TE>   Kuechenberg recalls having to guess which player to block during games
and practices from 1981 to '83, his last three seasons. "You see two of
them, and you don't know which to dive at," he said. "You wind up looking
pretty foolish. I threw a cross-body block at [teammate] Kim Bokamper
once, and I didn't even touch him."</TE>
<TE>   Several eye surgeries later, he still has problems. Kuechenberg says
driving can be tricky, especially at busy intersections.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't know what car's real and which isn't," he said. "So I have
to close one eye. At night, it's like a kaleidoscope."</TE>
<TE>   Stanfill, 55, a businessman in Albany, Ga., struggles to get around on
two artificial hips.</TE>
<TE>   His neck problems started with a violent head-to-head collision with a
teammate during a 1975 exhibition game. Twenty years later, vertebrae in
his neck began to rupture. Surgeons fused four of the disks together to
prevent further damage. His left hand has atrophied because of nerve
damage related to his neck condition.</TE>
<TE>Injuries Blamed on Artificial Turf</TE>
<TE>   Former defensive end Vern Den Herder, 53, supervises work on his
1,000-acre cattle ranch and farm in Sioux City, Iowa, despite searing
pain that often engulfs his upper back and neck, the result of
head-butting opposing offensive tackles for 12 years.</TE>
<TE>   Csonka, 55, a television host for outdoor-sports shows, hobbles from
chronic pain in the feet that carried him to a team-record 6,736 yards
rushing.</TE>
<TE>   "My toe joints took so much trauma," said Csonka, who blames his
condition on artificial playing surfaces at several NFL stadiums. "I wish
I never had to play on that surface. My life would be more enjoyable."</TE>
<TE>   Safety Dick Anderson has an arthritic neck, an aching lower back and a
left knee that is chronically sore. In 1975, he tore his anterior
cruciate ligament, the primary stabilizer of the knee. Fearing that
surgery would end his career, he played through the injury for his final
two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   In a 20-year span, he has had six knee surgeries, but the joint is
arthritic, and he needs a seventh operation.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're playing, you really don't think about what you're going
to feel like in 30 years," said Anderson, 55, owner of a Miami insurance
company.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson's story shows how far players would go to stay in the Miami
lineup during the team's heyday in the early 1970s. Playing in pain
was--and still is--common throughout the league, but it was elevated to a
high principle by the ultra-competitive Dolphins.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the players relied on painkilling drugs and on quick-fix
steriods, such as cortisone.</TE>
<TE>   Stanfill said cortisone injections, coupled with the trauma of
repeated hits, cost him his hips years later. A condition called
avascular necrosis cut off blood to the bone tissue, causing it to die.</TE>
<TE>   Tight end Marv Fleming, 60, who is retired and living in Marina del
Rey, still feels the effects of injections of cortisone and the
anesthetic Xylocaine that he received for a pulled back muscle. The shots
killed the pain, but Fleming suffered a muscle tear in the same area
after returning to the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I never shot it up the last time," said Fleming, a graduate of
Compton High. "Now I have scar tissue."</TE>
<TE>   Injecting cortisone directly into bone and tissue was known to cause
problems, even in the 1970s, but Fleming said he had it done to treat a
heel injury during the 1972 season. Fleming took a similar injection
before Super Bowl VII.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't walk, but I was the only tight end, so I had to play," he
recalled. "They stuck the needle in . . . all the way up to the bone.
They'd move the needle all around, then take it out, rub the heel a
little bit and say, 'It's show time.' "</TE>
<TE>   To play in Super Bowl VIII in 1974, Kuechenberg had the marrow drilled
out of his broken left arm and a steel-alloy rod inserted.</TE>
<TE>'Whatever It Took to Win'</TE>
<TE>   Center Jim Langer, 53, who lives in Minnesota, played with screws in
his knee. When the screws loosened, he allowed the team doctor to place a
piece of wood over his knee and hammer them back into place. The
procedure reset the screws but caused an old scar to split open.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an attitude that whatever it took to win, we did," said Howard
Kindig, a backup center and long snapper for the '72 Dolphins. "It didn't
matter if you were a superstar or third-string. There was one thing in
mind, and that was winning football games."</TE>
<TE>   Fernandez played his first playoff game against the Oakland Raiders in
1970 with one of his arms strapped to his side with a leather harness.
The device prevented him from raising the arm and further damaging a
separated shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   "I literally played the whole game with one arm," Fernandez said. "It
sounds kind of unbelievable, doesn't it? Does to me too. But it seemed
like the way to go then."</TE>
<TE>   An avid hunter, Fernandez has had his rifles modified to reduce the
recoil and protect his surgically repaired shoulders. His damaged knees
have given him the most trouble. After retiring from football in 1977,
Fernandez gradually gave up recreational activities.</TE>
<TE>   "Running is not even an option," he said. Fernandez can walk on a
treadmill or stair climber "as long as I don't get too rambunctious." He
controls the pain, to a degree, with prescription drugs. He recently had
to stop taking one medication because it was too hard on his stomach.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day is a surprise," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Players who retired in the 1970s, as many of these Dolphins did, were
not covered by lifetime medical insurance. Some applied for workers'
compensation, the state-administered programs that provide benefits to
people injured on the job.</TE>
<TE>   But because Florida excluded professional athletes from workers'
compensation, Fernandez, Stanfill and other Dolphins had to pay their own
medical bills.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, the NFL Players Assn. won a grievance against the Dolphin
organization on behalf of a group of ex-players, forcing the team to pay
for health insurance.</TE>
<TE>   "It took eight years of legal battles to do that, and [the Dolphins]
fought it tooth and nail," Fernandez said. "If I don't get treated for
two years, [the benefit] goes away. But that hasn't been a problem."</TE>
<TE>   Today, retired players can become eligible for lifetime benefits by
paying an annual $50 fee to the players' association. In the 1970s,
players who retired kept their NFL-provided insurance for less than a
year--until the start of the next season.</TE>
<TE>   "That was all you had," said Gene Upshaw, executive director of the
players' association and a former Oakland Raider all-pro guard who played
against the '72 Dolphins. "You could file for workman's compensation,
like you could in any other job, but in '72 players were not even
thinking about [doing that]."</TE>
<TE>   Pension and disability benefits have increased over the years, notably
with the 1993 collective bargaining agreement and subsequent extensions.</TE>
<TE>Dolphin Organization Comes In for Praise</TE>
<TE>   Despite their legal battles, Fernandez and Stanfill have nothing bad
to say about the Dolphins. "It's kind of a contradictory situation,
because they do great things for us sometimes," Fernandez said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the perks has been the recognition he receives as a member of
the greatest team in Dolphin history. "I'm a salesman, and the community
out here has been pretty open and receptive to me," Fernandez said. "It
has made it easier to make a living."</TE>
<TE>   Becoming successful outside of football was more important for this
group than for current players because NFL salaries were much lower in
the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Stanfill, selected the top collegiate lineman in the country at the
University of Georgia in 1968, was the 11th pick in the 1969 NFL draft.
He was paid a rookie salary of $20,000.</TE>
<TE>   The most he made in a season was $125,000, and that was only after
Csonka, running back Jim Kiick and receiver Paul Warfield left the
Dolphins for the World Football League in 1975, prompting Miami to raise
salaries to prevent further defections. Stanfill and Fernandez became the
first $100,000 defensive linemen in the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   Stanfill says he would do it all again today, even if it meant living
with artificial hips and a neck that doesn't turn.</TE>
<TE>   "You're damn right I would, especially at [the money] these jokers are
making nowadays," he said. "It's because of Sundays. I loved every game
and hated every practice.</TE>
<TE>   "It's because of those Super Bowls and what went on in the locker
room. The pranks. The mess we could get ourselves in."</TE>

<HD>Indonesian Cleric Had Role in Skyjackings, Officials Say</HD>
<DH>Terror: In Malaysia, a jailed Cal State graduate helps unravel Al
Qaeda's Southeast Asia network.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK FINEMAN and BOB DROGIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia
</DL>
<LD>A Cal State graduate from Malaysia has led authorities here to
conclude that a Muslim cleric from Indonesia ran terror operations for Al
Qaeda in Southeast Asia and played a role in the Sept. 11 skyjackings.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said Yazid Sufaat, who has a 1987 bachelor's degree in
biological sciences from California State University, Sacramento, has
cooperated with authorities since he was arrested Dec. 9 as he returned
from apparently serving in a Taliban medical brigade in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   Law enforcement and intelligence officials said Sufaat identified the
alleged regional terrorism chief as Riduan Isamuddin, who is also known
as Hambali. Sufaat also is helping them unravel the logistics and
operations of a network that was far larger--and far more dangerous--than
U.S. officials suspected.</LD>
<TE>   Officials said Hambali, who remains at large, used Malaysia's modern
infrastructure, bustling economy and numerous Muslim organizations to
hide a way station for Osama bin Laden's loose-knit global army--a place
to help future suicide skyjackers in transit, to forge identification
letters and to purchase explosives.</TE>
<TE>   FBI Director Robert Mueller said for the first time publicly Thursday
that Al Qaeda operatives in Malaysia took part in planning the Sept. 11
attacks. Evidence previously pointed to operatives in Hamburg, Germany,
and financial conduits in the United Arab Emirates.</TE>
<TE>   Hambali left Malaysia shortly before Sept. 11, officials here said,
and his precise role remains unclear. Officials believe that he returned
to Indonesia, home to another cleric who authorities in Malaysia and
Singapore say is the network's spiritual leader, Abu Bakar Bashir.</TE>
<TE>   One Malaysian official compared their roles to that of top members of
the Mafia. "If Abu Bakar is the godfather, Hambali is the consiglieri,"
or chief advisor and operational director, the official said. Abu Bakar
has declared Bin Laden to be "a true Muslim fighter" but denied any
terrorist ties.</TE>
<TE>   Officials describe Sufaat as a foot soldier who provided housing and
false identification letters and helped obtain explosives.</TE>
<TE>   The officials said, for example, that Hambali instructed Sufaat to
play host to two of the Sept. 11 skyjackers in January 2000, as well as
Zacarias Moussaoui, a French citizen who has been indicted in Virginia
for his alleged participation in the plot.</TE>
<TE>   Sufaat's signature also appears on a phony letter that the FBI found
in Moussaoui's apartment after his arrest in August. The letter, which
Moussaoui apparently obtained during one of two visits here in September
and October 2000, appointed Moussaoui marketing representative in North
America and Europe for a computer technology company called Infocus Tech,
Malaysia. It was signed, "Yazid Sufaat, Managing Director."</TE>
<TE>Wife Calls Allegations Against Sufaat 'Wrong'</TE>
<TE>   Documents on file here indicate that the ownership of Infocus is
obscured in a complex web of companies. But they show clearly that
Sufaat's wife, Sejahratul Dursina, also known as Chomel Sufaat, is a
significant shareholder, with at least 20% of the 500,000 outstanding
shares.</TE>
<TE>   She declined to be interviewed. On Friday night, she made a statement
to a Malaysian Internet news service staunchly defending her husband, who
was ordered detained for two years earlier in the day.</TE>
<TE>   "I strongly deny these allegations against him. They are baseless,
wrong and outrageous," she told Malaysiakini.</TE>
<TE>   Saiful Kasri, the lawyer retained by Infocus, said this week that the
company is a "100% legitimate" importer of U.S. computer software and
hardware and has partnerships with U.S. companies that were jeopardized
by the indictment.</TE>
<TE>   "Yazid Sufaat has nothing to do with the company," Kasri said. "He is
neither a director, employee nor shareholder."</TE>
<TE>   Malaysian officials said their investigation convinced them that
Infocus Tech and its real managing director--as well as Sufaat's
wife--are not suspected of wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Published reports this week quoted the FBI as alleging that Sufaat
also gave Moussaoui the $35,000 that Moussaoui declared when he flew into
Chicago from London last February. Malaysian officials said Sufaat has
denied that.</TE>
<TE>   "No money whatsoever changed hands," a Malaysian official said,
quoting Sufaat.</TE>
<TE>   The official said that "in fact, we believe that Sufaat had no
knowledge of what they were planning--neither Moussaoui nor the hijackers
who stayed at his condo the previous January."</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing that Sufaat found peculiar during his visit was that
Moussaoui asked him if there were any flight schools nearby," the
official added.</TE>
<TE>   When Moussaoui learned that the only school was hours away, he left
Malaysia. "We assume he may have also been scouting the region for flying
schools and he decided it was easiest to do in America," the official
said.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui was arrested in Minnesota for alleged visa violations Aug.
17 after instructors at a local flight school told the FBI that they were
suspicious of his demands to learn to use a Boeing 747 simulator even
though he had flunked out of another school's course for beginning
pilots.</TE>
<TE>   He was indicted Dec. 11 on conspiracy charges resulting from his
alleged numerous links to the Sept. 11 skyjackers and their handlers. His
trial is scheduled for this fall.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said Hambali instructed Sufaat to play host to two future
Sept. 11 skyjackers, Khalid Almihdhar and Nawaf Alhazmi, for three days
in January 2000. Their presence in Malaysia already has been reported,
but Sufaat has provided authorities with new details.</TE>
<TE>   Local officials said U.S. authorities had asked Malaysian intelligence
to watch for a group of suspected Arab terrorists who might be entering
the country in 2000. The CIA asked the authorities to only record and
watch their movements, not to arrest them.</TE>
<TE>   Those suspects, as well as Almihdhar and Alhazmi, arrived in Kuala
Lumpur on Jan. 5, 2000, and Malaysian agents tracked them 20 miles south
to a secluded and well-kept condominium complex called Evergreen Park.</TE>
<TE>   The group stayed in Sufaat's modest three-room, two-bath weekend
retreat next to a country club and 18-hole golf course designed by Jack
Nicklaus. Malaysian officials said they immediately gave surveillance
photos of the group to U.S. intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   CIA officials have said they determined only last summer that the
meeting was important, when they identified one person in the photos as a
possible suspect in the bombing of the U.S. destroyer Cole in Yemen in
October.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, they warned the FBI and U.S. immigration officials to
watch for Almihdhar and Alhazmi, but it was then determined that they
already had entered the United States. The two men are believed to have
helped commandeer American Airlines Flight 77 and crashed it into the
Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>Visits to Malaysia to Enlist Support</TE>
<TE>   Officials said Hambali used his frequent visits to Malaysia to enlist
support for a campaign to create a strict Islamic state comprising the
Malaysian peninsula, Indonesia and the southern Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   He did so, they said, by using local clerics who preached the severe,
anti-Western brand of Islam espoused by the Taliban. The gatherings took
place in private homes, or small, little-known Muslim schools.</TE>
<TE>   Sufaat had gone to California in the early 1980s, first enrolling at
Humboldt State University and later transferring to Sacramento.
University records indicate that he was born Jan. 20, 1964.</TE>
<TE>   He graduated in 1987 with a bachelor's degree in biological sciences,
concentrating on clinical laboratory technology, with a minor in
chemistry. He is remembered by the few teachers who recall him as an
average student. He met his wife, who is also Malaysian, while in
California.</TE>
<TE>   When he returned home, his mother-in-law didn't approve of his
capitalist ambitions and secular liberalism and insisted that he attend
religious classes. Many young Malaysians returning to this moderate
Islamic nation from the West do so.</TE>
<TE>   Sufaat studied with someone who later introduced him to Hambali, and
Sufaat gradually became a disciple.</TE>
<TE>   "I would put it this way: If Hambali was the travel agent, Sufaat was
the guy at the airport holding up the sign," said a Malaysian official,
who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   In nearly two months of interrogations, Sufaat has provided details
that have helped officials begin to understand Hambali's leadership of
Jemaah Islamiah, a network with cells in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia
and the Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   Other details have come from more than 40 others detained, including
cabdrivers, factory workers, accountants and corporate executives.</TE>
<TE>   After returning from California, Sufaat's life was anything but
remarkable. He initially joined the Malaysian army, where he was a lab
technician assigned to a medical brigade. After five years, he left the
service with the rank of captain and worked for a civilian laboratory.</TE>
<TE>   In August 1993, he set up his own company, Green Laboratory Medicine.
Corporate records show that Sufaat owns half the 220,000 shares in the
company, which thrived on government subcontracts to test the blood and
urine of foreign workers and state employees for drug use.</TE>
<TE>   Sufaat's wife helped establish Infocus Tech in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   They lived in a quiet suburban enclave, in a modest yellow-brick row
house on a block-long street called Diamond Lane. They had four children,
hired an Indonesian maid and drew no attention from police.</TE>
<TE>Suspect 'Was Already on Our Radar Screen'</TE>
<TE>   Even after Malaysian authorities tracked the future skyjackers and
other suspected terrorists to his condo, Sufaat drew only a little
scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   "Sufaat was already on our radar screen, but he really became
interesting after Sept. 11," a Malaysian official said, "after the FBI
found the letter in Moussaoui's apartment."</TE>
<TE>   But by then, Sufaat was gone. His wife, through attorney Kasri and
human rights investigators, said Sufaat went to Pakistan last June
because he wanted to do his doctorate in pathology at the University of
Karachi. He needed the degree, she said, to meet new Malaysian government
standards for drug-testing subcontractors.</TE>
<TE>   Malaysian officials said they are convinced that Sufaat spent much of
last fall in Afghanistan, serving in a Taliban medical brigade.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, Malaysian intelligence was ready when Sufaat crossed the
Thai border to Malaysia on Dec. 9. "We had a complete profile of Sufaat
by the time he came home," one official said.</TE>
<TE>   Sufaat has been imprisoned under a law that, in effect, allows
Malaysian authorities to detain a suspected subversive indefinitely
without formal charges.</TE>
<TE>   Malaysian officials said Sufaat acknowledged his role soon after his
arrest. He helped Malaysian and Singaporean authorities break up a cell
that plotted to attack U.S. military and commercial targets in Singapore,
as well as several embassies there, they said.</TE>
<TE>   They said Sufaat also admitted that his Green Laboratory was used as a
conduit to purchase 4 tons of ammonium nitrate to build a truck bomb for
the Singapore cell--ingredients that authorities now believe are stored
on the Indonesian island of Batam a short ferry ride from Singapore.</TE>

<DH>Blacklist: An exhibit details Hollywood's reaction to the 'Red
Scare' of 50 years ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNN SMITH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amid the faded posters, grainy photographs and yellowed lists of
names on display in the gallery of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences in Beverly Hills is a small booklet affixed with some dirty,
45-year-old laundry.</LD>
<LD>   Stapled in 1957 over Article 8, Section 1, Paragraph F of the
academy's bylaws, a typewritten revision warns that anyone who admits
membership in the Communist Party or who refuses to testify before a
"duly constituted Federal legislative committee or body . . . shall be
ineligible for any Academy Award . . ."</LD>
<LD>   There's more. The booklet is one of more than 200 items in an
unusually comprehensive exhibit that opened Friday in which the academy
acknowledges its complicity and that of the movie industry at large in
destroying or damaging the careers of hundreds during the infamous era of
the Hollywood blacklist.</LD>
<TE>   "We behaved as badly as anybody," said the academy's current executive
director, Bruce Davis.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit, which is open to the public and runs through April 21, is
the academy's first detailed presentation of its role in the events that
led to the blacklist and helped perpetuate it. Although some of those
events are now more than half a century old and many of those blacklisted
have died, the academy has had to face the fact that the blacklist
remains a volatile issue, one that continues to inspire recriminations,
accusations and anger.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit is likely to stir more debate about the blacklist years in
Hollywood. Some in Hollywood think the academy has not gone far enough to
right its wrongs. Others fear that visitors will learn little about those
who cooperated with the House Un-American Activities Committee, and will
leave with an oversimplified impression of a complex time.</TE>
<TE>Putting It Together Was a Difficult Task</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit arrives as the war on terrorism has excited a new
nationalism and alerted civil libertarians to watch for government
crackdowns on freedom of speech.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of the reason for doing shows like this is to make it less
likely for it to happen again," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Mounting a show about the era was a delicate task. Some people on
opposite sides still won't speak to each other, said the academy's Ellen
Harrington, co-curator of the show with author Larry Ceplair. One person
refused to donate items out of fear that the exhibit would not give
credibility to those who supported the blacklist, Harrington noted.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the academy learned just how inflammatory the issue still was
when it presented a lifetime achievement award to acclaimed director Elia
Kazan, who had cooperated with the House committee.</TE>
<TE>   To some, such as blacklisted writer Norma Barzman, Kazan was a symbol
of those in Hollywood who cooperated with the committee and thereby
altered the course of many lives, including her own. She and her
blacklisted husband, Ben, left the United States for Europe in 1949 and
lived in France for 27 years.</TE>
<TE>   Barzman said she was "bouncing mad" over the Kazan award. She said she
told the academy's then-President Robert Rehme: " 'Now you've got to do
something for us.' They called me in a year later and said, 'We're going
to do it, and make it bigger than you wanted. I said, 'Nothing is too big
for me.' "</TE>
<TE>   The Kazan controversy accelerated plans the academy already had for an
exhibit on the blacklist, Davis said. He noted that Ceplair, co-author of
"The Inquisition in Hollywood: Politics in the Film Community,
1930-1960," wasn't subject to interference by the academy. "There wasn't
any point in doing it unless he had absolutely free rein," he said.</TE>
<TE>   To some like Barzman, the exhibit is a way for the academy to improve
its image. Davis said the presentation isn't meant to be a "ritual
expiation," noting that the academy already has made several mea culpas
to the blacklisted. And he said the academy "absolutely" stands by its
award to Kazan.</TE>
<TE>Role of Pariah Is Reversed for Some</TE>
<TE>   Veteran producer Sam Gelfman wants the academy to publicly acknowledge
during the upcoming Oscar ceremony the half-dozen blacklisted people who
won or were nominated for Academy Awards under pseudonyms. Even though
credit has been restored to all blacklisted nominees and winners, the
acknowledgment needs to be made public, he said. "They should have it,"
he said. "It's right."</TE>
<TE>   On the other side, some say those who cooperated with the
congressional committee have now taken on the role of pariah, once played
by those tarred with the brush of communism. They complain that their
side is rarely heard.</TE>
<TE>   "People had their own reasons for talking to the committee," said
Kenneth Lloyd Billingsley, author of "Hollywood Party: How Communism
Seduced the American Film Industry in the 1930s and 1940s."</TE>
<TE>   Some former party members didn't like the way they had been treated by
the party, which had squelched free speech. Others were moved to speak
because of Stalinist atrocities, including anti-Semitism, Billingsley
said.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit, "Reds and Blacklists: Political Struggles in the Movie
Industry," explains that the academy contributed to the political climate
even before the first congressional hearing in 1947. In the 1920s and
'30s, the academy, unlike today, was deeply involved in labor-management
struggles that helped politicize Hollywood--and always on the side of the
studios.</TE>
<TE>   Studio executives and producers agreed not to hire anyone whose name
appeared on the blacklist. By 1955, the movie industry had caved in to
the "Red Scare."</TE>
<TE>   The unions also cooperated with the House committee. The Writers Guild
agreed that studios could remove names of blacklisted writers from
movies; the Directors and Screen Actors guilds adopted loyalty oaths.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than politics, the reasons were more often profit, job
security, and--in denying awards to blacklisted writers--embarrassment,
the exhibit asserts.</TE>
<TE>Examples of Some of the Actual Lists</TE>
<TE>   Items on display were gathered from museums and individuals. They
include posters of anti-communist movies from the 1950s such as "I
Married a Communist," a photo of movie stars Humphrey Bogart, Lauren
Bacall and others as they board an airplane for Washington, D.C., in 1947
to support friends who would try to challenge the congressional
committee, and letters from some who went to prison rather than inform.</TE>
<TE>   There are examples of some of the actual lists used by studios. One
contains the names of those who didn't respond to a subpoena to appear
before the committee that were published in the panel's annual report.</TE>
<TE>   A second list contains names gathered by organizations such as the
American Legion from letterheads of suspect organizations, authors or
entertainers. According to Ceplair, the effect of appearing on either
list was the same: "You could lose your job."</TE>
<TE>   Ceplair, a teacher at Santa Monica College, knows that such an exhibit
won't please everyone.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the nature of the beast," he said. He said his goal was to
show that "for about 15 years in this country, the 1st Amendment went on
vacation because of actions by various governments in the U.S. and a lot
of vigilante or hate groups."</TE>
<TE>   The congressional hearings weren't the first time the government had
expanded its powers to control speech in a time of crisis, but they
remain the worst in recent memory, Ceplair said.</TE>
<TE>   The roughly 600 people affected in Hollywood were among thousands of
ordinary people across the country who lost jobs because they were
accused of being communists or communist sympathizers.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after the academy amended its bylaws in 1957, however, its board
was embarrassed because blacklisted writers began receiving awards under
pseudonyms, and explanations became difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Finally in 1959, when it became known that an Oscar would be going to
"Nathan E. Douglas" (Nedrick Young) and his writing partner for "The
Defiant Ones," the board met to rescind the rule.</TE>
<TE>   "They also met with Young and said, 'If you come, don't embarrass the
academy.' So, that's what happened," Ceplair said. "Ned Young and his
partner won, came up, said thank you very much and that was it." The
exhibit includes a clip of the ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Stories about the rule had been breaking on television and the
blacklist began to crumble, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth MacRae, Young's widow, said she recently asked the academy
to publicly acknowledge his work under his pseudonym. "I think the
academy needs to go the extra step and connect them with their films,"
she said. She has not yet received a response.</TE>
<TE>Perceptions of a Real Threat</TE>
<TE>   Many in Hollywood then--and some now--believed communists posed a real
threat to the movie industry. Testimony from actors, screenwriters and
producers from the era released last year by the National Archives
indicate that communists had infiltrated trade unions, inserted
anti-capitalist messages into scripts and taught young actors how to
portray pro-communist attitudes in their scenes.</TE>
<TE>   There are those who insist the threat of communism and its propaganda
in films justified whatever action they took to combat it.</TE>
<TE>   "People have played it down until there wasn't a threat there. There
was a threat," said Ramona Moloski of Canoga Park, the daughter of
high-profile union leader Roy Brewer, now 92, who cooperated with the
committee and opposed strikers. "My dad's main thrust was to save the
country from being overthrown by the communists. It hurts me when I see
them go after my dad," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "The minute you tried to fight communism, you got on their list,
believe me."</TE>

<HD>At Talks, Much of It Ducks Behind Doors</HD>
<DH>Meeting: Private chats rule the day at the World Economic Forum in
New York, where terrorism is as much on the agenda as finance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Diplomacy trumped finance at the World Economic Forum on Friday,
with foreign leaders and U.S. officials ducking into hotel suites for
dozens of meetings while nonstop seminars focused on Africa, the
Arab-Israeli conflict and international counter-terrorism strategies.</LD>
<LD>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell spoke in the morning about fighting
world poverty as well as terrorism, a persistent theme of the discussions
here. Later in the day, he held private meetings with Israeli Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres, Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, as well as other world leaders.</LD>
<LD>   Powell called the international campaign to raise humanitarian aid for
Afghanistan an essential element of the battle against Al Qaeda and
Taliban fighters in that country.</LD>
<TE>   "As we fight terrorism--using military means and legal means and law
enforcement and intelligence means and going after the financial
infrastructure of terrorist organizations--we also have to put hope back
in the hearts of people," Powell told the forum, an annual who's who of
the business, diplomatic, academic and media worlds.</TE>
<TE>   There were no reported meetings between Peres and Palestinian
officials, however, despite widespread hopes for such talks. Ahmed Korei,
the speaker of the Palestinian parliament and a key peace negotiator, who
plans to visit Washington next week, was expected to stop at the forum en
route to attend some of its sessions.</TE>
<TE>   But Powell said he was "very pleased" to hear news reports from Israel
about meetings there earlier this week between Israeli Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon and Korei and two other top deputies of Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   "Dialogue is an important thing," Powell said. But Sharon, who is
scheduled to visit the White House next week, has said in interviews in
Israel that he will urge President Bush to end all contacts with Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Powell also met privately with European diplomats who have been
pressing for more active international engagement in the Mideast
conflict, including French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine and Javier
Solana, the chief foreign policy coordinator for the European Union.</TE>
<TE>   After Powell spoke, panelists at a seminar titled "Understanding
Global Anger" suggested that hostility toward the wealthy West shouldn't
be difficult to comprehend.</TE>
<TE>   "Two-thirds of the world population is poor and hungry, so two-thirds
of the world population is angry," said Amr Moussa, the secretary-general
of the Arab League. "We don't have to ask why."</TE>
<TE>   The Philippines' Arroyo, a ubiquitous and energetic presence at
Friday's meetings, also persistently linked political discontent to
economic problems.</TE>
<TE>   She told reporters shortly before her meeting with Powell that she
hopes the coalition fighting terrorism--a fight that has now extended to
the far edges of the Philippine archipelago--will unite behind a global
campaign to boost economic development in areas where radical
anti-Western forces have gained strength.</TE>
<TE>   "These resources could have gone into the fight against poverty," she
said. "Where there is great poverty, you will also have the breeding
ground for the recruits, for the evil ideologues who spread terror."</TE>
<TE>   Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien struck a similar note, appealing
for a major increase in foreign aid to Africa.</TE>
<TE>   "Poverty, Mahatma Gandhi once said, is the worst form of violence,"
Chretien said.</TE>
<TE>   Forum organizers say that 2,700 delegates from 106 countries are
attending the meetings at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel, including 30 heads
of government and at least 100 Cabinet ministers. Many of them came as
much to meet one another as to listen to the high-minded panel
discussions.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the bilateral meetings that make this worth it," said Sen.
Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), the chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee, who met privately here Friday with half a dozen foreign
ministers and heads of state.</TE>
<TE>   Biden was a featured speaker in a long morning discussion on "new
priorities for U.S. foreign policy."</TE>
<TE>   "It was interesting," he said later, "but it didn't yield much."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he added, the forum was a rare opportunity to hear a spectrum
of non-American opinion about U.S. policy abroad. "There is concern
whether the U.S. will use the war on terrorism as an opportunity for
further consensus on other issues, or as an excuse of unilateralism," he
said. "It's a legitimate question."</TE>
<TE>   On many panels, there was an undercurrent of unease about Bush's State
of the Union attack on Iran, Iraq and North Korea as an "axis of evil."
It is a concern generated both by the implied broad expansion of the U.S.
counter-terrorism campaign and by fears among Europeans and others that
the administration is reverting to unilateralism after a period of close
consultation with foreign allies.</TE>
<TE>   The most pointed critic, however, was a U.S. senator, Democrat Bob
Graham of Florida, who called it "an unfortunate phrase" that falsely
implied an alliance of the three in language reminiscent of the World War
II Axis powers and President Reagan's anti-Soviet "evil empire" remarks
in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Iran and Iraq "are almost biblical enemies," and neither has known
close relations with the North Koreans, Graham said, adding that he has
seen no convincing evidence of an Iraqi connection to the Al Qaeda
terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   "It does not serve the objective of the war against terrorism to get
diverted by other nations," Graham said.</TE>

<HD>Sharon Takes Umbrage at Criticism From Israelis</HD>
<DH>Mideast: As his approval rating sags during 16 months of fighting,
the prime minister complains that his compatriots 'know how to hate.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJORIE MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has President Bush on Israel's side as
he prepares to fly to Washington next week to coordinate policies on Iran
and the Palestinian Authority.</LD>
<LD>   Sharon also has Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat right
where he wants him, politically weakened and under military siege at his
West Bank headquarters in Ramallah.</LD>
<LD>   The 73-year-old former general should be feeling his might. But in the
first interviews he has granted in months, Sharon gives the impression
that he is the one besieged. With a new poll showing his approval rating
sagging at the end of his first year in office, Sharon is impatient with
Israelis on the left and right who criticize his handling of the 16-month
Palestinian uprising.</LD>
<TE>   "The Bulldozer," as he has long been called, is thin-skinned,
apparently, about attacks from fellow Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   "Jews as individuals are great individuals--talented, ambitious,
intelligent, smart," he told the Yediot Aharonot newspaper in an
interview published Friday. "As a people, I would not give them as high a
grade. Jews know how to hate.</TE>
<TE>   "One might have thought that we had gotten over it. The signs, from
Tel Aviv to [my] farm, 'Sharon is a murderer,' '[Menachem] Begin is a war
criminal,' had almost completely disappeared," he said. "But now there
are new signs . . . signs pointing to the home of 'the murderer.' The
hatred seethes."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to Nahum Barnea and Shimon Shiffer, journalists who have
known and covered Sharon for decades, the prime minister expressed a
yearning to be back on his farm in the Negev desert.</TE>
<TE>   "I need landscapes," he said. "Fields. I need birds. Animals. Because
of the security madness, I live behind closed curtains. It's oppressive
to me."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's nemesis, Arafat, may also be chafing at a lack of space. The
Palestinian leader has been confined to Ramallah for nearly two months,
most of the time shut in his headquarters surrounded by Israeli tanks. To
hear Sharon talk, Arafat won't be leaving soon.</TE>
<TE>   "The greater Arafat's sense of isolation grows, the more he will
employ the measures required of him," Sharon said.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon has demanded that Arafat arrest those who organized and carried
out the assassination of Israeli Tourism Minister Rehavam Zeevi in
October, and those who arranged a 50-ton arms shipment that Israel says
was headed for the Palestinian Authority when it was intercepted last
month.</TE>
<TE>   If he does not, "then he'll sit there," Sharon said. "I don't think
that we have exhausted all the pressure. I see the United States is
increasing its pressure on him. It is postponing [U.S. envoy Anthony C.]
Zinni's returning, even though Arafat longs to see him.</TE>
<TE>   "We pledged not to harm Arafat physically. Nor did I set as a goal
expelling him from here. But I plan to tell President Bush next week, 'I
suggest you ignore Arafat, boycott him, don't hold any contacts with him
and don't send any delegations to him.' "</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with the Maariv newspaper, also published Friday, the
prime minister was asked why he didn't kill Arafat in 1982 when, as
defense minister, Sharon led the invasion of Lebanon and had the
Palestinian leader under siege in Beirut.</TE>
<TE>   "We made a promise, and promises must be kept," Sharon said, referring
to Israel's pledge to the United States at the time not to harm Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he regretted that, Sharon said: "There is no question that he
has caused us many losses and very heavy damage. Absolutely, but we made
a promise not to."</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian Authority has called Sharon's comments "very
dangerous." It cites Israel's killing last month of Raed Karmi, a
military leader of Arafat's Fatah movement, and other targeted attacks as
proof of the government's willingness to assassinate Palestinian leaders.</TE>
<TE>   But Sharon insisted to Maariv that he has "no plan to touch Arafat
personally. This would cause Israel damage. We have no intention today of
harming Arafat."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon spokesman Raanan Gissin lashed out at the media for publishing
only excerpts of the interview dealing with Sharon's regrets and
suggesting that they meant the prime minister was threatening to kill
Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   "If he wanted to kill Arafat, he could have done it. He doesn't,"
Gissin said in a telephone interview. "Besides, Arafat will bring about
his own demise. It's a different world after Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon calls Arafat "irrelevant" and refuses to meet with him,
although he has allowed Foreign Minister Shimon Peres to continue a
dialogue with Palestinian negotiator Ahmed Korei. Israel Television
reported Friday that Sharon met this week with Korei; Arafat's chief
deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, better known as Abu Mazen; and Arafat's financial
advisor, Mohammed Rashid.</TE>
<TE>   Although critics on the right say Sharon should cut off all contact
between his government and the Palestinian Authority and topple
Arafat--as former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wrote in Maariv on
Friday--left-of-center politicians charge that Sharon has no plan for
ending the uprising and reaching a long-term peace settlement with the
Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   In a poll published in Maariv on Friday, 48% of respondents said they
were satisfied with Sharon's performance in general, compared with 57% in
December.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if they were satisfied with his performance on security matters,
just 37% said yes--down from 54% in the previous poll. Moreover, fewer
than a third of those polled said they believe that Sharon has a plan,
compared with 58% who said he is "just reacting" to Palestinian shootings
and suicide bombings in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon insisted that he does have a vision.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to reach a diplomatic arrangement which will be followed by
peace. But to reach an arrangement, terrorism has to stop first," Sharon
told Yediot Aharonot. "We need a lot of restraint. Patience. If we
believe, we will reach both security and peace."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon said he is willing to make "painful" territorial compromises
for a peace treaty with the Palestinians that establishes a demilitarized
Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians say Sharon's vision falls far short of their demand
for a Palestinian state in all of the West Bank and Gaza Strip captured
by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War, with traditionally Arab East
Jerusalem as its capital.</TE>

<LD>Former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic will face only one
trial to answer for three separate indictments for war crimes in Kosovo,
Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, the U.N. tribunal said.</LD>
<LD>   An appellate bench of the tribunal in The Hague agreed to a
prosecution request to hold a single trial for Milosevic, allowing key
witnesses to appear only once rather than be recalled for several trials.</LD>
<LD>   The court said the trial could begin as scheduled Feb. 12.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors have said they will call as many as 30 political insiders
to testify and link Milosevic to the atrocities during his 13-year rule.</TE>

<HD>Argentine Court Overrules Bank Freeze</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES
</DL>
<LD>Argentina's Supreme Court ruled Friday that a widely hated banking
freeze is unconstitutional, striking a surprise blow at government
efforts to shore up the teetering financial system.</LD>
<LD>   The court voted 5 to 0 against the freeze, ruling in favor of
plaintiffs who had demanded their trapped savings.</LD>
<LD>   It said that the executive decree authorizing the limits ran roughshod
over citizens' rights to their savings, that it was "irrational" and that
it virtually "annihilated" constitutional rights to private property.
Three judges abstained.</LD>
<TE>   It remained unclear whether the government will now be obliged to
permit the full withdrawal of deposits.</TE>
<TE>   The government of President Eduardo Duhalde had no immediate comment,
with officials saying they were still studying the decision.</TE>
<TE>   Economy Ministry sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
interpreted the ruling as a narrow decision that applies only to
plaintiffs who filed lawsuits demanding their money from the banks.</TE>
<TE>   But some constitutional experts said the ruling on a specific case set
a precedent for what could be a wave of lower court cases by depositors
wanting access to their cash.</TE>
<TE>   "If this ruling applies to all accounts, then all you have to do is go
to court and tell the judge you want your deposits to be returned. And
the banks would have to do it," said Aldo Abram, an economist for the
Exante consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   The banking restrictions have allowed most Argentines to pull no more
than $800 a month from their accounts and were imposed Dec. 1 after
anxious depositors yanked more than $1 billion from the banking system in
one day.</TE>
<TE>   Anger over the freeze and other economic crisis measures fueled the
ouster of the last elected president, Fernando de la Rua, on Dec. 20.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the efforts of Duhalde, protests have raged for weeks against
the freeze and other austerity measures, occasionally triggering violence
that included attacks on bank branches around the country.</TE>
<TE>   The lifting of the curbs could spark a massive depreciation of the
recently devalued peso if people use the freed money to buy safe-haven
U.S. dollars.</TE>
<TE>   The peso has lost nearly 50% of its value since Duhalde broke a
decade-old currency peg that made one peso equal to one dollar. The peso
sold at 2.05 to the dollar Friday, traders said.</TE>

<HD>BBC Cites U.S. Killings in Korea</HD>
<DH>Report: Up to 400 people died on a beach at the start of war in
1950, documentary contends.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON
</DL>
<LD>A British Broadcasting Corp. documentary aired Friday reported that
U.S. warships killed as many as 400 Korean refugees gathered on a beach
during the early days of the Korean War.</LD>
<LD>   The documentary also cited new American witnesses to the killing by
U.S. troops of civilian refugees under a railroad bridge at No Gun Ri in
July 1950.</LD>
<LD>   The report, entitled "Kill 'Em All," cited "newly unearthed" military
documents in which U.S. commanders, fearing North Korean infiltrators
might be hiding among refugees, issued orders such as "Shoot all
refugees" and "All refugees . . . are fair game."</LD>
<TE>   The documentary featured South Korean survivors who described the
killing by U.S. soldiers of 82 villagers cowering in a small shrine. It
also said that as many as 400 civilians died when U.S. warships shelled a
crowd of refugees on a beach.</TE>
<TE>   The BBC said the killings on the beach occurred Sept. 1, 1950, but the
network did not name the ships involved. The BBC said it arrived at the
400 figure from interviews with survivors.</TE>
<TE>   "So many people were hit by the shrapnel," said survivor Choe Il
Chool. "So many were screaming and crying. The whole beach was full of
mutilated bodies. The warships were really close. The sound of the shells
was so loud."</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon on Friday declined to comment on the BBC report.</TE>
<TE>   In January 2001, the U.S. said American soldiers killed or injured an
unconfirmed number of refugees at No Gun Ri but denied that U.S.
commanders issued oral or written orders to shoot and kill Korean
civilians at No Gun Ri.</TE>

<HD>India Rebuffs Pakistan on Talks</HD>
<DH>South Asia: New Delhi says negotiations with Islamabad have proved
futile. Cross-border fire in Kashmir kills four people, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>JAMMU, India
</DL>
<LD>The Indian government Friday rejected calls by Pakistan to hold
talks to end their military standoff after troops traded heavy fire
across the disputed region of Kashmir.</LD>
<LD>   Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, who has ordered the
biggest military buildup on the border since the last war with Pakistan
in 1971, said talks with Islamabad had proved futile.</LD>
<LD>   "They [Pakistan] keep saying the leaders of the two countries should
meet. Meet for what? Do we meet for discussing the weather or some
business?" Vajpayee said at a party conference in New Delhi.</LD>
<TE>   Vajpayee's remarks came as troops exchanged mortar and heavy machine
gun fire at several points along the so-called Line of Control that
divides the Himalayan region between the two nuclear-armed rivals.</TE>
<TE>   An Indian defense official said three civilians, including a
4-year-old child, had died in the Poonch district northwest of Jammu in
overnight cross-border firing by Pakistani soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   "Stocks of fodder of some border families in the area caught fire due
to enemy mortar fire," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Across the frontier in Pakistan, a soldier was killed by Indian
machine gun fire near the border town of Sialkot, witnesses and military
officials said. The firing began late Thursday and continued through
Friday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani Foreign Minister Abdus Sattar said he hoped to hold talks
with India's national security advisor, Brajesh Mishra, during a
conference in Munich, Germany, this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal really is to revive, recommence and strengthen dialogue with
India in order to peacefully resolve Kashmir and other issues," Sattar
said.</TE>
<TE>   Indian Defense Minister George Fernandes said Pakistani troops
continue to fire across the border to provide cover for Islamic militants
sneaking into the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no other reason [for the firing] unless they have ammunition
which they want to burn. Knowing their financial situation, they are not
in a position to burn ammunition," the United News of India news agency
quoted him as saying in New Delhi, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   Fernandes said there had been a slight drop in the number of rebels
crossing into Indian-ruled Kashmir, but he added that it was not
significant and that New Delhi would not withdraw its troops from the
border until infiltration ended fully, the news agency said.</TE>
<TE>   Indian officials and military analysts also point out that numbers
traditionally taper off at this time of year when snow closes mountain
passes and make conditions harsh.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen people, including three children, died in separate incidents
of violence elsewhere in Kashmir during the last 24 hours. Police said
three children died Thursday while playing with a grenade they found in a
meadow in the Udhampur district.</TE>
<TE>   An activist of the pro-India People's Democratic Party was among those
killed by suspected guerrillas along with his bodyguard in the Baramulla
district.</TE>
<TE>   Four militants of the Lashkar-e-Taiba, one of the two separatist
groups blamed by India for a Dec. 13 attack on its Parliament, were shot
dead by security forces at Surankote in the Poonch district, the news
agency said.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ZAMBOANGA, Philippines
</DL>
<LD>At least five Muslim guerrillas were killed Friday in a battle with
Philippine troops on Basilan island, where two Americans and a Philippine
nurse are being held hostage, a Philippine military commander said.</LD>
<LD>   The firefight came a day after the Philippines and the U.S. opened a
training exercise aimed at wiping out the Abu Sayyaf rebel group, which
authorities say may have ties to the Al Qaeda terrorist network.</LD>
<LD>   In Manila, the capital, two lawyers asked the Supreme Court to stop
the exercise, arguing that the Philippine constitution contains no
provision for U.S. troops to be deployed "in a war zone area" such as
Basilan.</LD>
<TE>   Philippine troops engaged about 20 rebels in a 15-minute fight on
Basilan across from Zamboanga on the southwestern tip of Mindanao island,
said Southern Command chief Lt. Gen. Roy Cimatu.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say that this group is the blocking force of the main Abu
Sayyaf group that is holding the hostages," Cimatu said. "If it is . . .
probably we will have some positive developments in the near future."</TE>
<TE>   Guerrillas who escaped the fighting were being pursued by the troops,

<HD>Feuds Simmer Beneath a Warlord's Gaze</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Fighters cross the country to plead for their jailed
comrades. How disputes like these are settled will be crucial to the
future.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HERAT, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>With their gold and silver turbans glistening in the afternoon
sunlight, the men from Kandahar laid down their weapons and sat at the
feet of the warlord of Herat. Ismail Khan, the self-proclaimed emir of
five western provinces, stared down at them, serene and impassive.</LD>
<LD>   Many of the visitors were former members of the Taliban from the very
city where that regime had jailed Khan for three years. Now, in a cool
green garden just after noon prayers, they were seeking his favor. They
wanted their jailed comrades freed from the warlord's prison.</LD>
<LD>   Khan did not oblige them, but he did grant them a jalsa, a collective
meeting for airing grievances. After three hours of arguing and
posturing, of veiled threats and somber pleas for reconciliation, it was
decided that not even the emir of the west could solve everyone's
problems in a single day.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, they would form a committee.</TE>
<TE>   The men from Kandahar, along with elders from three other southern
provinces, would select three men to resolve their complaints in
negotiations with three of Khan's men. The Kandahar men accuse the
warlord's gunmen of killing, kidnapping and robbing their sons, fathers
and brothers after Khan drove the Taliban from the western provinces in
November. At least 600 of their men are being held incommunicado at
Herat's central prison, the Kandahar contingent claims.</TE>
<TE>   The Kandaharis and their confederates left mollified, if not
satisfied--a sign that postwar Afghanistan has the capacity to resolve
disputes, or at least defuse them, by talking instead of shooting. But
oaths of revenge muttered by some of the armed visitors as they left made
it clear that the rule of the gun is not over.</TE>
<TE>   How lingering feuds from the latest war in Afghanistan are resolved
will be crucial to the survival of the interim government. Leaders of the
150-man southern delegation said they had consulted with interim Prime
Minister Hamid Karzai; his photograph graced the windshields of their
dusty SUVs. They also had the blessing of the man who rules their
southern provinces--warlord Gul Agha Shirzai, Khan's rival.</TE>
<TE>   During the meeting in Khan's garden this week, there were tense
moments. One visitor wagged his finger in the emir's face, a grave
insult. Another, an elder, shouted Khan down and shoved a fat file of
written complaints into his hands. Yet another lectured him about honor.
Several times, the warlord's bodyguards tensed and edged toward his
guests. Above his flowing white beard, a smile played on Khan's lips.</TE>
<TE>   That his former enemies would drive across Afghanistan to seek his
indulgence put Khan in an expansive mood. He seemed to savor every minute
of their uncomfortable presence as supplicants in his kingdom. They are
ethnic Pushtuns. He is Tajik. With an alluring smile, he assured them
that the difference didn't matter.</TE>
<TE>Visitors Are Left to Sip Green Tea for an Hour</TE>
<TE>   He invited them into his whitewashed villa on a hill above his
military garrison, with its stunning view of Herat's legendary blue
mosque. Then he let them wait, restlessly sipping green tea, for an hour
while he reviewed his private army. He made sure his guests could see the
long green formations, row after row of armed men, and his two dozen
tanks and armored vehicles in the hazy distance.</TE>
<TE>   Then he took them to his mosque for noon prayers.</TE>
<TE>   Only later, when the Pushtuns were sated by the great feast of roast
chicken and lamb that Khan had set before them, would he upbraid them.</TE>
<TE>   The southerners were still finishing their cold Pepsis, sitting
cross-legged on 25 new Iranian carpets Khan had bought at the bazaar that
morning, when the emir rose to address them. He was conciliatory. He
offered to speak Pashto, not the Dari tongue of the Tajiks. He called
them his "brothers of Kandahar." He advised them to stop speaking of
Tajiks or Pushtuns, of Kandaharis or Heratis, because now everyone is
simply an Afghan.</TE>
<TE>   Khan spoke for nearly 30 minutes, without notes. No one interrupted
him. Each Pushtun addressed him as "Your Excellency Emir," the title that
Khan's functionaries insist upon from visitors.</TE>
<TE>   Khan reminded his guests that Afghans had erred by allowing Russians,
Pakistanis, Arabs and Iranians into the country to meddle or conquer. At
the mention of Iran, the elders murmured, because Khan has been accused
of accepting money and arms from that country, where he took refuge after
escaping from Taliban custody. He assured them that such charges are
propaganda and that he fully supports the interim government in Kabul,
the Afghan capital.</TE>
<TE>   Hanging over the meeting was the question of who had been Talibs.
Dozens of the visitors wore thick, wild beards and massive turbans in the
Taliban style, yet no one could be found who admitted to having served in
the movement. Khan played along, but finally he spit out, "Ninety percent
of the people in the Herat jail are your Taliban."</TE>
<TE>   The Pushtuns stirred, and Khan seemed to sense a belligerency among
them.</TE>
<TE>   "We are ready for a fight if need be, but it's better to talk," he
told them. "I tell you, my brothers, the only way is to sit together and
solve our own problems."</TE>
<TE>   Upon hearing this, the Pushtuns erupted in a chorus of "Allahu akbar!"
(God is great).</TE>
<TE>   The head of the council of elders in Kandahar, Said Zahir Agha, rose
unsteadily on his cane. He asked Khan for a gift: the release of their
men.</TE>
<TE>   "If our sons and brothers have murdered, kill them," Agha said. "If
they have stolen, punish them. If not, please release them."</TE>
<TE>Amid the Outbursts, an Ever-Present Smile</TE>
<TE>   Khan did not respond. Agha asked him for a private meeting with his
delegation's top four elders. Khan nodded, almost imperceptibly, agreeing
to that request.</TE>
<TE>   Next to speak was silver-bearded Haji Abdul Raouf Noorzai, from
Kandahar.</TE>
<TE>   "We appreciate what you say," he told Khan. "But we don't want words.
We want action."</TE>
<TE>   There were shouts of approval.</TE>
<TE>   "You call yourself emir of these provinces," Noorzai went on, "so try
to keep honor among your people."</TE>
<TE>   Khan's smile did not leave his face.</TE>
<TE>   "I try my best," he said evenly.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, one of the Pushtuns walked up and squatted before the seated
emir. He said that two of Khan's soldiers had killed his two nephews and
stolen six cars and 15 motorcycles from his dealership. It was this man
who thrust his finger in the warlord's face. Khan motioned for his police
commander.</TE>
<TE>   "Is this true?" he asked the officer.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, it's true, but the violators have been jailed."</TE>
<TE>   "If they are in jail," Khan declared, "then the law will decide."</TE>
<TE>   The Pushtuns cried out: "No! You must kill them! They killed our
people!"</TE>
<TE>   Khan raised his hand and the shouting ceased.</TE>
<TE>   "No, you cannot take the law into your own hands," he said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the elders tried to get Khan to read the stack of complaints
the Pushtuns had brought--kidnappings, carjackings, rapes, murders,
evictions. Khan glanced at them, then withdrew a written complaint of his
own from the daybook he carried. Stapled to it was a photo of a teenage
boy.</TE>
<TE>   "Those Taliban bastards kidnapped this young boy," Khan said. "I have
hundreds more cases like this in my office. You should come see them."</TE>
<TE>   Then he summoned his police commander again. The officer described how
the Taliban stole every vehicle from the Herat police force and drove
them to Kandahar.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe you were driving one of them," he said to one of the Pushtuns.</TE>
<TE>   More Pushtuns rose to register grievances, but Khan cut them off.</TE>
<TE>   "Stop!" he said. "I don't have time to hear your problems."</TE>
<TE>   He proposed the six-man commission, three from each side, "to solve
all these problems and dispense justice." The Pushtuns agreed, and
selection of the panel was set for the next day.</TE>
<TE>   Then Khan stood and issued his decision on the jailed men: Anyone held
in his prison and found to have been a Talib would not be released. For
all the prisoners, there would be proper trials, he promised.</TE>
<TE>   If a man is convicted of murder, he will be executed, Khan said. If he
is convicted of torture, he himself will be tortured.</TE>
<TE>   The Pushtuns fell silent. Khan stared down at them and slowly
repeated, "I will not release any Taliban."</TE>
<TE>   He fixed his narrow brown eyes on one of the Pushtuns who had been
arguing with him and said, "Even if he's one of yours, I won't release
him."</TE>
<TE>   There was nothing more to say. The meeting was over. The Pushtuns
loaded their weapons onto their convoy. Some of them vowed to take up
arms to free their comrades. Others said no, give the new commission a
chance. The southerners sped from Khan's villa in a cloud of white dust,
their turbans bouncing against the roofs of their SUVs.</TE>
<TE>   Khan's security men hustled him into a silver Toyota Land Cruiser and
he too was gone, taken to safety somewhere in the province he rules.</TE>

<HD>Fighting Drives Government-Backed Warlord From Afghan City</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GARDEZ, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>After two days of deadly battles, a warlord backed by interim
Afghan Prime Minister Hamid Karzai retreated Friday from his fight for
control of this southeastern provincial capital, a setback for Karzai's
efforts to put the nation under government control.</LD>
<LD>   Local fighters and residents said they expect more battles once the
warlord, Bacha Khan, regroups his men in the rugged mountains surrounding
Gardez.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, U.S. military officials said they now believe that innocent
people were among the estimated 15 who were killed and 27 who were
captured in a nighttime raid on two remote compounds in Afghanistan last
week.</LD>
<TE>   A formal investigation has not been completed, but two senior
officials said it appears likely that a mix of Taliban and anti-Taliban
fighters were at the site about 60 miles north of Kandahar. U.S.
intelligence officers had believed that the compounds were hide-outs for
members of the Al Qaeda terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Tommy Franks, head of the U.S. Central Command, ordered an
investigation this week in response to assertions from Afghan government
officials that a police chief, his deputy and members of a district
council were among those killed or captured.</TE>
<TE>   In Gardez, the fight between Khan and the city's shura, or council,
brewed for months, growing primarily out of tribal bad blood. Khan
accuses shura members of being Taliban and Al Qaeda sympathizers, which
they deny. Members of the council have met with Karzai and expressed
their loyalty.</TE>
<TE>   It is widely believed in the city that Khan was responsible for
calling in U.S. airstrikes in December in which 27 people died. The U.S.
military has never released results of an investigation of the incident
after claims that innocent civilians were targeted.</TE>
<TE>   Residents said they were dismayed during the recent fighting that U.S.
forces did not intervene and attempt to prevent a new cycle of violence.</TE>
<TE>   "We looked to the Americans, hoping they would do something," said
Abdul Malek, a policeman. "The people of Gardez are a little disappointed
in America now."</TE>
<TE>   While the city was rocked by fighting that reportedly killed at least
61 people, U.S. aircraft hovered overhead but did not intervene. Nor did
Special Forces troops that were conducting covert operations from an old
fort nearby.</TE>
<TE>   The battle was the biggest outbreak of fighting since the Taliban was
driven from power.</TE>
<TE>--- UNPUBLISHED NOTE ---</TE>
<TE>Beginning in stories published in 2006, the Afghan warlord Bacha Khan is
identified as Pacha Khan Zadran. (Second reference is "Pacha Khan.")</TE>

<HD>Faith-Based Initiative Gains Unusual Leader</HD>
<DH>Charity: Jim Towey worked with Mother Teresa and AIDS patients.
Bush hopes he will invigorate program.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush sought Friday to jump-start his beleaguered bid to
give religious charities a larger role in public life, naming a
Democratic follower of Mother Teresa to run the effort and proclaiming
that there is "a tremendous opportunity" to solve social ills with
faith-based approaches.</LD>
<LD>   The White House picked Jim Towey, an advocate of the elderly who has
worked closely with Democrats and Republicans, to help salvage the
stalled effort, which has been one of Bush's top domestic priorities. The
appointment comes as the White House and key senators are close to
agreeing on a compromise bill that would provide new tax incentives for
charitable donations and possibly some new funds for community-based
services.</LD>
<LD>   But the emerging accord will steer clear of last year's controversial
"charitable choice" proposal, which raised fears that the church-state
wall would tumble down and that religious employers would be exempted
from civil rights laws in their personnel decisions.</LD>
<TE>   "We have a tremendous opportunity now to take the spirit [of
faith-based organizations] and apply it to problems like poverty and
addiction, abandonment and abuse, illiteracy and homelessness," Bush said
at a White House ceremony to introduce Towey. "These are incredibly tough
problems. But I believe with the help of faith we can solve the
problems."</TE>
<TE>   Towey, 45, who spent a year living and working in a Washington hospice
for AIDS patients, ran Florida's health and social services agency under
Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles in the mid-1990s. But Towey's 22-month
stint, marked by his activist leadership style, ended in a partisan brawl
when the Republican state Senate refused to confirm him.</TE>
<TE>   He is considered an unusual public figure, more comfortable in sandals
than wingtips. A devout Roman Catholic, he has a sense of humor some
might consider irreverent.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1995 interview with the St. Petersburg Times, Towey declared, "My
career goal is to go to heaven."</TE>
<TE>   Towey has managed to forge close relationships with Democrats and
Republicans alike, including Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, the president's
brother. He sought out Mother Teresa in Calcutta in the 1980s, beginning
a long association in which he volunteered hands-on care and legal advice
for her ministry. In 1996 he founded Aging with Dignity, an advocacy
group for senior citizens.</TE>
<TE>   "He brings to the job managerial skills and a servant's heart," Bush
said Friday. "He will be a great director, and I look forward to working
with him to advance a bold initiative."</TE>
<TE>   Towey "understands there are things more important than political
parties, and one of those things . . . is helping to heal the nation's
soul," Bush said. "There is nothing more important than helping the
hopeless see hope, helping the addicted see a better life."</TE>
<TE>   Accompanied by his wife and four young sons, Towey responded, "I'm
deeply grateful to God and to you, sir, for entrusting me with this honor
to serve my country, particularly those Americans who are hurting and in
need. Mother Teresa introduced me to this joy that comes from befriending
those in need, and discovering their tremendous dignity."</TE>
<TE>   Towey will fill a vacancy left by Democrat John J. DiIulio Jr., who
resigned last fall after struggling with Congress and religious
conservatives about the direction of the initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also announced the formation of a new White House advisory
council, headed by domestic advisor John Bridgeland, that will oversee
Towey's office.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the initiative seized on the reorganization as a sign that
the White House initiative, which was launched with great fanfare early
last year, was being downgraded. "After 12 months of criticism from the
right, left and center, it's been downgraded to part of an office on
volunteerism," said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of
Americans United for Separation of Church and State, a watchdog
organization. "It looks like Towey will have his work cut out for him."</TE>
<TE>   But Bush said the relief efforts sparked by last fall's terrorist
attacks provided fresh evidence of the importance of faith-based and
community organizations: "They provide help," he said. "They have helped
heal the nation's wounds."</TE>
<TE>   Eager to achieve even a scaled-down victory, White House strategists
have been working toward a compromise initiative that could sail through
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   A sign of the emerging consensus emerged last month, when a coalition
of churches, civil libertarians and other groups agreed on three elements
of a compromise: charitable tax deductions for filers who don't itemize;
requiring religious groups to set up separate operations to handle their
social services; and encouraging private-sector donations to faith-based
groups.</TE>
<TE>   On Capitol Hill, Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Rick Santorum
(R-Pa.) are completing negotiations with the White House on a $10-billion
plan that would include tax incentives for charitable giving and a
"compassionate capital" fund to aid grass-roots, faith-based efforts. It
also would reaffirm existing law that prohibits the government from
discriminating against organizations based on their religious names or
their use of religious icons.</TE>
<TE>   But notably absent from the emerging deal will be the "charitable
choice" provision that critics feared would allow faith-based
organizations to discriminate in employment and blend the provision of
social services with religious practices.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to be a consensus bill with overwhelming bipartisan
support," said Dan Gerstein, a Lieberman spokesman. "There's nothing in
here that's going to antagonize people."</TE>
<TE>   Some supporters of the more sweeping approach, however, expressed
disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   "You take half a loaf of bread when you can get it, realizing that
you'll just continue to work for more," said Stephen Lazarus, senior
policy associate with the Center for Public Justice.</TE>

<HD>Where the Buffalo Roam, Stories Are Told Via Poem</HD>
<DH>Cowboys: A genre of poetry born on the prairies two centuries ago
is attracting fans young and old.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ELKO, Nev.
</DL>
<LD>JoAnn Hoffman, a worldly California art dealer and model, got
smitten with the last man in the world she would have expected--a cowboy
from South Dakota.</LD>
<LD>   He wooed her with his seductive, honest poetry, plumbed from his soul
by way of his heart, each one signed, "Always your buckaroo."</LD>
<LD>   She married him, and now she's a denim-and-boots cowgirl, with a smile
as wide as the brim of her hat.</LD>
<TE>   Hoffman, 46, has since discovered that the world of cowboy poetry
includes a lot more buckaroo writers than just her husband.</TE>
<TE>   This week she and her husband, Robb Hoffman, drove 18 hours in subzero
temperatures, from Hill City, S.D., to this northern Nevada railroad,
mining and cattle town to attend the 18th annual National Cowboy Poetry
Gathering.</TE>
<TE>   About 8,000 people are expected to attend the function, which
concludes tonight. They're filling every motel room, clogging the streets
with their extended-cab pickups, parading through town beneath a sea of
cowboy hats and pouring into the convention center to be warmed by the
prose, poems and simple songs of working cowboys.</TE>
<TE>   "For people who value this lifestyle and ethic, the poetry tells the
story," Robb Hoffman, 45, said. "Cowboying is a dying breed. But we still
have the stories, and when they connect, there are tears."</TE>
<TE>   More than 250 cowboy poetry gatherings have sprung up around the
country, from Oregon to Texas--and a popular one that is staged annually
in Santa Clarita--but this is the granddaddy.</TE>
<TE>   "This has turned out to be much bigger than cowboys and poetry," said
Waddie Mitchell, 51, a local rancher and poet who helped launch this
cowboy Woodstock in 1985. "It's Americana. We're celebrating the cowboy's
philosophy, reflecting on what's really important: family, friends, the
land and reestablishing links to our traditions."</TE>
<TE>   These are poems written by cowboys and cowgirls for one another,
providing intimate snapshots of hard, honest, uncomplicated lives, and
the unpretentious relationships they have with the land, the animals and
each other.</TE>
<TE>   They rhapsodize about the sunsets, complain about the cows, praise
their ponies, compliment their neighbors and curse--and thank--the land.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most popular cowboy poets, Wallace McRae, wrote about
cowboys preparing for a cattle roundup in "One More Shipping Day,"
including this verse:</TE>
<TE>   You can see the frosty grass now, in the pre-dawn's eerie light,</TE>
<TE>   And there's just a hint of light above the hill.</TE>
<TE>   To the west a coyote caterwauls farewell to his friend, Night.</TE>
<TE>   But except for him, and us, the world is still.</TE>
<TE>   "This gathering is an oxymoron--cowboys and poetry, in the middle of
nowhere, in the middle of winter," Mitchell said. "Whoever would have
thought it would have taken off like it has? But it seems that people are
hungry for this."</TE>
<TE>   Cowboy poetry dates to the early 1800s, fashioned by men and boys on
the trails, around the campfires or in the bunkhouses, passing the time
by telling stories blended with bravado and hyperbole, wit and poignancy.
Storytelling evolved into cowboy theater.</TE>
<TE>   Similar literary genres developed among loggers, railroaders, sailors
and soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   These cowboy stories framed an oral history of the Old West and
frequently were put to rhyme so they could more easily be memorized and
passed along.</TE>
<TE>   By the late 1800s, some poems were being printed in cow town
newspapers; in the early 1900s, the first anthologies were printed in
book form. Cowboy novelty songs were being performed on stages in the
1930s, by yodeling cowboys accompanied by harmonicas and accordions. But
by and large, this genuine cowboy art form played only to cowboy
audiences.</TE>
<TE>   To the public, cowboys seemed a tough, calloused breed, hardened by
blazing summers and frigid winters, solitary and stoic, free of emotion
and civil sensibilities. But in fact their lives were rich with
experience, and they felt compelled to share it, at least among
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell operated a cattle ranch outside of Elko and heard his
cowhands reciting poems, old and new. There's an audience for this, he
thought, among all the cowboys around these parts.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell and folklorist Hal Cannon together staged the first poetry
gathering in 1985, with more than 50 cowboys reciting their poems. It
captured an immediate following, and the Elko gathering has now grown to
capacity, limited only by the number of motel rooms in town. Even this
week, with frigid temperatures and icicles draped on cars like crystal
concertina wire, the followers have made their pilgrimage.</TE>
<TE>   They come not just for the poetry but for seminars: rawhide braiding,
horsehair hitching, gourmet trail food. There are headier sessions too:
preserving watershed, financial management advice for female ranchers,
rangeland restoration after fire.</TE>
<TE>   But mostly, people come for the poetry, which in genuine hands can be
the most emotional use of language.</TE>
<TE>   "The poems reflect deep, Christian values," said Bill Davis, 59, a
grain inspector for California's department of agriculture who drove from
Sacramento with his wife, Lou Ann. "Family values, good morals."</TE>
<TE>   It's popular among younger audiences too. "I love the history and the
storytelling," said Kari Martin, 25, of Yerington, Nev. "I'm from a
ranching family, and it's nice to hear how the life used to be."</TE>
<TE>   With broadened exposure, cowboy poetry has found not only an audience
beyond the rural West but also among writers hoping to emulate the style
but whose boots may never have stomped through a corral.</TE>
<TE>   "Our initial ranching audience has extended to wannabes," said Charlie
Seeman, executive director of the Western Folklife Center, which sponsors
the gathering.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers feed the interest, providing workshops during the week on
poetry writing.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe we're all cowboys, or we want to be," said participant Doug
Miller, 54, a high school English teacher from White Salmon, Wash.
"Cowboy poetry seems a contradiction: You can't visualize cowboys sitting
around writing poetry. But then you understand that they're celebrating
the land that they nurture and protect, and the relationships that
they've developed with the land and one another."</TE>
<TE>   Blake Allmendinger, a professor of American literature at UCLA who
wrote "The Cowboy," a study of cowboy poetry, wonders if the genre is
being hijacked by non-cowboy writers.</TE>
<TE>   "We're seeing [other] people jumping on the bandwagon, and it makes me
wonder what a person's credentials have to be," he said. "Just live in
the country? Put on a cowboy hat and be able to rhyme? Are people
appropriating that persona? Cowboy poetry is elastic and [new works]
aren't exactly like what they used to be."</TE>
<TE>   But the art form remains vibrant, said John Dofflemyer, who lives
along the western slope of California's Sierra Nevada, near Visalia. A
widely published poet and a fifth-generation rancher, he was this week's
keynote speaker.</TE>
<TE>   Dofflemyer said he began writing poetry while attending a boarding
school far from home. "I dealt with that by writing about the rural
landscape. It was my release."</TE>
<TE>   Modern cowboy poetry embraces contemporary issues--tensions with
environmentalists, frustration with the economy, anger at the government.
But they largely follow the traditional template of a cowboy
poem--long-metered, clip-clop couplets.</TE>
<TE>   The new poems are replacing bravado and slapstick humor with
introspection and vulnerability, said Dofflemyer, 53, who for years
published a cowboy poetry quarterly. Contemporary subjects better
resonate with readers today who question their values and reevaluate
their lifestyles, although the poems may still contain passages that only
cowboys can relate to.</TE>
<TE>   The terrorist attacks Sept. 11 on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon prompted more writings, still and always with a cowboy's
perspective on life and relationships.</TE>
<TE>   While not drawing direct reference to the attacks, Waddie Mitchell
said he was moved by Sept. 11 to reflect on how people deal with
conflict.</TE>
<TE>   His effort, "Harsh Words," opens with this verse:</TE>
<TE>   When you face an altercation</TE>
<TE>   With a loved one or a friend,</TE>
<TE>   And what you say next could determine</TE>
<TE>   How things turn out in the end,</TE>
<TE>   Hold a tight rein on emotions,</TE>
<TE>   Keep them checked at any cost,</TE>
<TE>   For they can stampede all your senses</TE>
<TE>   And a temper's easily lost.</TE>

<HD>Idaho Officials Repeal Term Limit Legislation</HD>

</DL>
<LD>Signaling growing disenchantment with term limits in statehouses
across the West, the Idaho Legislature on Friday defied the governor's
veto and became the first state in the nation to repeal its 7-year-old
law.</LD>
<LD>   State representatives, citing problems in recruiting qualified new
lawmakers in Idaho's far-flung rural districts, voted 50 to 20 to
override Gov. Dirk Kempthorne's veto. That was followed by a 26-8 vote in
the Senate.</LD>
<LD>   Several members of the legislature, the most heavily Republican in the
nation, would have been barred from running for reelection in 2004 under
the law, which limits state and local officials to eight years in office.
Numerous county commissioners and school trustees, who are limited to six
years of service, would have been kept out of the 2002 elections.</LD>
<TE>   "We are all pleased that we have had the courage . . .--veteran
legislators along with freshmen and sophomores--to take this action,
which is in the long-term interest of the state of Idaho," Republican
House Speaker Bruce Newcomb said after the vote.</TE>
<TE>   He said term limits were "sold to the people of Idaho" by special
interests outside the state. "What we have done today is begin the debate
in Idaho, where it should have been taken up when all this started."</TE>
<TE>   A day earlier, Kempthorne had acted on his long-standing threat to
veto the legislation, citing two statewide votes--in 1994 and 1998--in
which Idaho citizens signaled their endorsement of term limits.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, this is a matter of the people's will. I cannot say to the
people who elected me to office that I respect their decision in my case
but reject their collective judgment--on the very same ballot--when they
affirmed their support for term limits," Kempthorne said in a letter to
the House speaker. "It is a question of process, and the will of the
voters of Idaho cannot be ignored and must be protected."</TE>
<TE>   After Friday's override, Kempthorne spokesman Mark Snider said the
vote was expected. "Everybody knew it was going to happen. For the
governor, this wasn't a personal issue, it was a philosophical issue.
It's not something he lobbied the Legislature on. His veto was based on a
principle, and what happens from here on out happens."</TE>
<TE>   Term limit advocates in Idaho have promised to put the issue before
the voters again, in a referendum in November. Don Morgan, chairman of
the Idaho group Citizens for Term Limits, said: "Now we go back to the
people. This is going to set off a political firestorm in Idaho. Right
now, this state Legislature is the most Republican in the nation. I am
not sure that will be true after the next elections."</TE>
<TE>   Stacie Rumenap, executive director of U.S. Term Limits, a national
organization that has helped push the adoption of term limits across the
county, predicted the new initiative would succeed. "If there was ever a
demonstration of the need for term limits, this is it," she said. "As
term limits are creeping up on these legislatures, we are seeing efforts
by the states to undo the will of the people." Seventeen states have term
limit laws on the books.</TE>
<TE>   California has a measure on the March ballot, Proposition 45, which
would allow local voters to petition the secretary of state to allow
term-limited incumbents to run for reelection. In Montana, where popular
Republican Gov. Mark Racicot was barred from running last year, two state
senators--B.F. Christiaens and Mack Cole--recently filed suit to overturn
that state's 10-year-old term limit law.</TE>
<TE>   And in Oregon, the state Supreme Court last month overturned its term
limit law, which took effect in 1991. The court didn't decide the case on
the merits of term limits themselves but found the initiative that
imposed term limits violated a state law that requires each
constitutional amendment be voted upon separately.</TE>
<TE>   Term limits were popular a decade ago, particularly among Western
Republicans who sought to end the careers of liberal East Coast members
of Congress. But the U.S. Supreme Court voided congressional term limits
in 1995. Idaho's law was adopted in 1994, with the approval of nearly 60%
of the electorate, but it has been a contentious issue ever since.</TE>
<TE>   The approval margin slipped to 53% in a subsequent advisory vote in
1998. Two years ago, the Idaho Republican Party made repeal of the law a
part of the state party platform. Legislators have said the law was never
intended to apply to local officials, particularly in rural states like
Idaho where recruiting and keeping experienced local officeholders can be
a challenge.</TE>

<HD>Amtrak Threatens to Halt Red-Ink Routes</HD>
<DH>Travel: Rail system wants federal subsidy bumped to $1.2 billion.
Carrier announces it will cut spending and 1,000 jobs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Amtrak said Friday that it will shut down later this year all
long-distance routes that don't turn a profit unless Congress more than
doubles its annual subsidy to $1.2 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The national passenger rail system also announced immediate spending
cuts of $285 million, including the elimination of 1,000 jobs, or 4% of
its work force.</LD>
<LD>   "Everyone knows that you can't make a profit while running a network
of unprofitable trains, but that's exactly what we're expected to do,"
Amtrak CEO George Warrington said.</LD>
<TE>   Odds of getting the $1.2 billion seem remote in a budget year when
military and security spending are the priorities and the federal deficit
has reemerged.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to turn Amtrak into an independent, profit-making enterprise
are widely acknowledged to be petering out in failure. Last month, a
federal reform commission recommended that the system be broken up into
smaller regional companies, which could be operated by state and local
governments or private entities.</TE>
<TE>   However, Amtrak still has considerable support on Capitol Hill, and
many lawmakers believe the federal government should continue to
subsidize rail service indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   Five interstate trains serving California may be permanently sidelined
if Amtrak follows through with its proposed cuts in October, spokeswoman
Vernae Graham said. They are the California Zephyr, linking Chicago and
the Bay Area; the Coast Starlight, between Seattle and Los Angeles; the
Southwest Chief, from Chicago to Los Angeles by way of Kansas City, Mo.;
the Sunset Limited, from Orlando, Fla., to Los Angeles; and the Texas
Eagle, from Chicago to Los Angeles by way of San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   Routes within California--such as the Pacific Surfliner between San
Luis Obispo and San Diego--would not be affected, Graham said. Those
routes are supported by state subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak ticket revenues have risen 26% since 1997, while ridership grew
11%. But expenses have grown even faster. For every $1 in additional
revenue, expenses grew by $1.05, according to a report last month by the
Transportation Department's inspector general. As a result, the system
last year suffered its worst operating loss: $1.1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not clear whether Amtrak or any other entity could ever operate
a linked national system such as that in place today without operating
subsidies," the report concluded. "Congress will need to weigh the likely
costs of subsidizing a linked national system against the merits of
preserving such a system."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to its operating shortfall, Amtrak needs $1 billion a year
in capital investment "for the foreseeable future," the inspector
general's office found.</TE>
<TE>   Congress has appropriated $521 million for Amtrak in the current
budget year. Measured against that funding level, the $1.2-billion
request represents a 130% increase.</TE>
<TE>   House Transportation Committee Chairman Don Young (R-Alaska) branded
Amtrak's request as "irresponsible" and said he will hold hearings to
explore reforms. He questioned the rationale for maintaining the current
extensive route system.</TE>
<TE>   But his Democratic counterpart, James L. Oberstar of Minnesota, said
the real problem is that Congress has underfunded the rail service. "We
need to invest in Amtrak, not destroy it," Oberstar said.</TE>
<TE>   On top of its annual subsidy, Amtrak also received an additional $418
million from the government in the current budget year, bringing the
total to $939 million. Measured against that funding level, the
$1.2-billion request for the coming year still is significant, about 28%.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak spokeswoman Kajal Jhaveri said the request has to be seen in
the context of government subsidies for roads and aviation. "We might be
asking for an increase of 100%, but highways and aviation received $46
billion," Jhaveri said. "We are asking for this to accommodate the basic
needs to manage and operate the system."</TE>
<TE>   Long-distance rail service is Amtrak's biggest money loser. According
to the inspector general's report, it posted an operating loss of $304
million last year. "Amtrak has historically struggled with generating
growth on intercity trains, which represent most of Amtrak's
long-distance routes," the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak's Northeast corridor and local West Coast routes have posted
better results and, as a consequence, have a more promising future.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer qualms about returning to air travel also could benefit the
rail system.</TE>
<TE>   "In the current economic climate, and in the wake of the terrorist
attacks, Amtrak's relative performance has been more promising than its
competitors," the inspector general found. While air travel dropped after
Sept. 11, Amtrak ridership held steady and revenues grew modestly.</TE>

<HD>Path to Refugee Status Easing</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Immigration and Naturalization Service is trying to speed up
its system for granting refugee status and hopes to extend it to 70,000
people this year, the head of the agency said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   INS Commissioner James Ziglar also said a newly created Office of
Juvenile Affairs within the agency will work to help the roughly 5,000
juvenile immigrants who enter the country each year unaccompanied by
adults.</LD>
<LD>   In remarks before the National Immigration Forum, a pro-immigrant
umbrella group based in Washington, Ziglar also touched on the aftermath
of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, saying that the INS is working with
the FBI, the Treasury Department and the Office of Homeland Security to
make the nation more secure.</LD>
<TE>   He added, however, that the terrorist attacks should not stop the
country from encouraging immigration from around the world.</TE>
<TE>   "The events of Sept. 11 were caused by evil, not immigration," Ziglar
said. "We cannot judge immigrants by the actions of terrorists."</TE>
<TE>   Ziglar said the INS had developed a business-model plan to expedite
the granting of refugee status and would work with the State Department
to cut through red tape that has prevented the INS from reaching its
70,000-refugee mandate in past years. In the future, Ziglar said, he
would like to see the country accept even more refugees and other legal
immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   The commissioner noted that he and Homeland Security Director Thomas
J. Ridge are working to develop bilateral border policies with Canada and
Mexico. Ziglar said American companies need and benefit from immigrant
labor, including undocumented immigrants from Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can find a way to move illegal immigrants into legal channels,
we would enable the border patrol to focus on the bad guys coming across
the border rather than the people coming across to work," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ziglar said that raising the numbers of immigrants who could come here
legally would end the human smuggling network that consumes attention
along the U.S.-Mexico border.</TE>
<TE>   While the agency will work to encourage immigration, it will maintain
a hard line against those who break immigration laws, including those who
abuse student visas.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be tough in enforcing laws but tender in dealing with people,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Office of Juvenile Affairs would work to reunite children with
their parents when appropriate and would develop new guidelines for their
shelter, care and treatment while they remain in the United States.
Funding requires congressional approval.</TE>
<TE>   Ziglar also spoke of his controversial decision to suspend
international adoptions from Cambodia. He said the INS had to put the
best interests of children ahead of those of U.S. citizens who wanted to
adopt. He said the INS often did not have enough information on children
from places like Cambodia and Vietnam to determine if they are truly
orphans.</TE>
<TE>   "I make no apologies on the INS stance on questionable adoptions," he
said. "We are not going to aid and abet child trafficking."</TE>
<TE>   But Ziglar said he understands the emotional heartache caused when
Americans are told they cannot bring a child back to this country. He
said the INS will work to prevent situations in which Americans
incorrectly believe they will be able to adopt a child they have traveled
abroad to meet.</TE>

<HD>Ties to Enron Pose Vexing Problem on Campaign Trail</HD>
<DH>Politics: Candidates from both parties struggle to distance
themselves from the disgraced company.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>It seemed like a productive day for Elizabeth Hanford Dole. She was
in Houston last September for a speech, and an influential supporter
pulled together a luncheon fund-raiser at a snazzy hotel for Dole's U.S.
Senate campaign in North Carolina.</LD>
<LD>   Dole, the race's likely Republican nominee, went home with a tidy
$20,000. But now she's paying an unexpected political price. The host of
that fund-raiser was Kenneth L. Lay, then-chairman of the still-solvent
Enron Corp. And given the company's financial collapse, Democrats are all
over her for it.</LD>
<LD>   "Another day, another Enron-Dole connection," the state Democratic
Party said in a recent news release, taking note of reports that a top
Dole strategist also lobbied for Enron. On Friday, the party started
airing a television ad attacking Dole for "conducting fund-raisers at the
house of a scoundrel."</LD>
<TE>   Dole, wife of 1996 GOP presidential candidate Bob Dole and herself a
White House aspirant in the 2000 race, makes a high-profile target. But
she is not alone in having to cope with Enron on the campaign trail.</TE>
<TE>   Even as Congress prepares to ask more questions about Enron during
several hearings next week, politicians throughout the country are having
to explain their ties to a company that has become a national symbol of
corporate greed, mismanagement and influence peddling.</TE>
<TE>   In Senate campaigns in Minnesota, Colorado and Texas, Republicans
already have had to deal with Enron-related issues. Indeed, many
Democrats see GOP links to the company as a topic that can play to their
strengths--and help them overcome the daunting political challenge posed
by President Bush's wartime popularity.</TE>
<TE>   "Enron has the potential to shape the entire political environment for
2002, impact other issues and reduce confidence in the Bush
administration and Republicans," said a recent analysis by three
Democratic consultants, including James Carville, President Clinton's
onetime political aide.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Enron is becoming a burr under the saddle for politicians of both
parties, even the safest incumbents. The 188 House members who received
Enron-related donations include 71 Democrats, and 29 Democrats were among
70 senators getting such contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Many of these politicians have opted to return their Enron-related
donations or give the money to a fund established to help the company's
former workers or other charities. But even those who have kept the
contributions know what side of the issue they want to be on: "against"
Enron. The trick is how to get there.</TE>
<TE>   Questions about Enron have been particularly felt in Texas, where the
Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing by the home-state company affected thousands of
voters. In the lively race to succeed retiring Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas),
Enron connections could cause trouble for the expected GOP nominee, state
Atty. Gen. John Cornyn.</TE>
<TE>   Cornyn has received between $150,000 and $200,000 in Enron-related
contributions over the years--most directly from Lay--and has refused to
give back any of the money. He sided with the company in a regulatory
dispute last year. But in January, to avoid an appearance of any conflict
of interest, Cornyn withdrew from the state's investigation of Enron's
collapse.</TE>
<TE>   "He wrote a favorable legal opinion for Enron in September, but now
that the state is a creditor of Enron, he has thrown up his hands," said
Robert Gibbs, spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.</TE>
<TE>   But Democrats' hands are not entirely clean: Rep. Ken Bentsen, one of
several candidates in the Democratic Senate primary, has received $44,750
from Enron and its executives since 1989, according to the nonpartisan
Center for Responsive Politics. Bentsen has given $3,000--the most recent
donation received from Enron's political action committee--to the fund
for the company's employees.</TE>
<TE>   Far from the Texas epicenter, the Enron controversy erupted last month
in Minnesota, where Democratic Sen. Paul Wellstone is in a tough fight
for reelection against St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman, who was recruited to
run by Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Erlandson, chairman of the state's Democratic Farm Labor Party,
recently criticized Coleman for accepting $2,500 from the PAC of Enron's
accounting firm, Andersen. He challenged Coleman to take a stand on a
series of Enron-related policy questions.</TE>
<TE>   The Coleman campaign responded by alleging that Wellstone had accepted
a contribution from Andersen's political action committee in his 1996
campaign. Wellstone's campaign denied that, saying it only received a
donation from an accountant who worked for Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   In Colorado, Democratic Senate candidate Tom Strickland has
spotlighted an accounting proposal that many believe might have prevented
some of Enron's problems. He criticized Sen. Wayne Allard, a Republican
seeking reelection, for signing a letter two years ago opposing new rules
that would have set stricter conflict-of-interest standards for
accounting firms. An Allard spokesman said the senator had simply sought
a delay of the rules to allow more time for congressional study.</TE>
<TE>   Strickland's campaign manager, Brian Hardwick, responded:
"Unfortunately, it appears that the request effectively killed the
reform."</TE>
<TE>   In House campaigns, Democrats are expected to try to build on anger
fueled by the Enron case to highlight votes last year by GOP incumbents
that favored an economic stimulus bill that included a big tax break for
the company. A preview of that argument can be seen in a recent ad in
South Dakota, in which Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.)
responds to critics who held him responsible for blocking the measure.</TE>
<TE>   "Why are they spending so much money promoting an economic stimulus
plan that allows some big special interests to avoid paying any taxes and
gives Enron a $250-million tax cut?" the pro-Daschle ad asked.</TE>
<TE>   Dole has taken a two-pronged approach in responding to criticism of
her Lay-sponsored fund-raiser, which surfaced in the media in
mid-January. Of the $20,000 she collected, she sent $5,000--the amount
her campaign estimated came from Lay, his wife and the Enron PAC--to the
Enron employee fund. But she kept the rest. Her campaign spokesman said
that money came from non-Enron sources.</TE>
<TE>   The Dole fund-raiser has become controversial not just because of its
Enron connection but also because it happened Sept. 20, when most
politicians had suspended fund-raising activities because of the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks. In the ad that started airing Friday, the North
Carolina Democratic Party charges: "Sept. 11. Elizabeth Dole promises she
will put her campaign on hold, but then on Sept. 20, flies to a secret
fund-raiser hosted by Kenneth Lay."</TE>
<TE>   Mary Brown Brewer, Dole's communications director, said the candidate
had promised only to suspend her "public campaign" and did not consider
the fund-raiser a public event.</TE>

<HD>Storm Leaves 21 Dead Across Midwest, Northeast</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS
</DL>
<LD>A snow and ice storm smashed through the Midwest and into New
England on Friday, after weeks of temperatures so mild that folks in city
after city were bemoaning the wimpy winter.</LD>
<LD>   The storm was blamed for at least 21 deaths in eight states. Power was
out to hundreds of thousands of homes in Missouri, Oklahoma, Michigan,
Ohio, Indiana and New York. Sheets of ice coated roads in many states,
making travel treacherous. "There are going to be some busy tow trucks
across Nebraska," said Terri Teuber of the state's highway patrol. "There
are a lot of vehicles in ditches."</LD>
<LD>   Ditto for western New York, not far from Buffalo.</LD>
<TE>   "We've been through the freezing rain and the ice, and [Friday
morning] we had winds gusting up to 50 mph," said Gordon Dibble, chief
deputy in charge of road patrols for the Genesee County Sheriff's
Department. "So now we have many, many, many power lines down, trees
blown over, jackknifed tractor-trailers, cars rolled into the ditch.
We've got just about everything there is."</TE>
<TE>   In a typical year, a storm like this one would be just another
aggravation, another entry in the log of winter woes. This year, however,
it was big news because, in many of the states that were hardest hit, the
storm broke a string of days so warm that January felt a lot like April.</TE>
<TE>   In Milwaukee, for instance--which got 6.7 inches of snow, a local
record, Thursday--the average temperature in January was nearly 8 degrees
higher than usual. There was so little snow that the city's road salt
reserves, heaped in towering mounds, offered the most tempting sledding
around.</TE>
<TE>   In Lawrence, Kan., fishermen were catching 10-inch crappies all last
month, long after the lakes typically are frozen solid. In Des Moines,
golfers were lining up putts in T-shirts and shorts. Dairy Queens in
Nebraska were doing a brisk business selling ice cream. And in St. Paul,
Minn., an annual winter treasure hunt ended early when a teenager found
the prize as he was kicking some leaves in a park that's typically buried
under at least a foot of snow.</TE>
<TE>   All that warm weather led some die-hards to gripe that winter wasn't
winter without chapped lips and frozen beards.</TE>
<TE>   Kids wanted snow days off from school and hockey games on the ponds.
Ice fishermen wanted ice.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why we live here, for the changing of the seasons," explained
Jan Fascilione, who works at a skating rink in Downers Grove, Ill., a
Chicago suburb.</TE>
<TE>   Fascilione got her changing seasons, and then some, when the storm
dumped 13 inches of snow Thursday on Downers Grove. By Friday, she was
regretting her fair-weather enthusiasm for winter. She had wanted a
dusting of snow, she said, "but not this much." She had wanted winter to
settle in, "but not this quickly."</TE>
<TE>   The storm that rolled through the Midwest and Northeast actually
originated in Southern California, where it was relatively mild, just
cold air and a surprise dusting of snow. But as it pushed east across the
Rockies, the storm system smacked into a stream of cold air coming south
from Canada and a jet of warm, moist air coming north from the Gulf of
Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   The result: Schools closed, airports delayed flights and power lines
went down one after another as snow and freezing rain seized city after

<TE>   Snow fell for 30 hours straight in Omaha; the roads were so slick that
the state highway patrol did not even risk sending tow trucks out until
the storm eased Friday. In Kansas City, Mo., meanwhile, tree limbs fell
with such rapid-fire thuds that one resident said it sounded like someone
was blasting away with a shotgun. In Oklahoma, utility officials called
the storm the worst in a century and warned that 225,000 customers might
be without power for days.</TE>
<TE>   Heavy rains pelted Boston on Friday. Northern New England reeled from
the season's biggest snowfall. Freezing rain atop 10 inches of snow in
Vermont forced many businesses and even state government offices to
close. In Maine, the mix of snow, sleet and rain prompted meteorologist
Bob Marine of the National Weather Service to predict, "We're going to
have a little of everything."</TE>

<HD>Poll Shows Orange County Supports Public Arts Funding,
Especially for Kids</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A survey of Orange County voters showed that most would approve
spending tax money to support the arts, especially educational
programs for children.</LD>
<LD>   The public poll, released by Arts Orange County, a nonprofit arts
council, sampled 500 registered voters on what they thought about
being taxed to fund the arts.</LD>
<LD>   The results showed that 70% of registered voters would support a
small portion of local taxes being allocated to the arts. Of this
group, 28% said they were willing to spend from 11 cents to $3.99 per
capita, and 42%, most of whom were from south Orange County, said
they would pay $4 or more per capita, although the survey results did
not specify if the arts funding would come from existing taxes or a
new one. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4%.</LD>
<TE>   The county's current contribution to the arts is 5 cents per
capita.</TE>
<TE>   The poll also showed that people attend arts events for personal
growth and to spend time with friends and family. Most prefer to
attend arts events in the county, but 29% look to Los Angeles for
additional events and 2% travel to San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   The poll also said that 95% of those surveyed believed that money
should go to children's arts programs, as part of youth development
and education.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a consensus in public funding for the arts in children's
education," said Bob Meadow of Decision Research, the Washington,
D.C.-based research firm that conducted the survey.</TE>
<TE>   The findings were based on 500 phone interviews conducted in
English and Spanish of voters selected at random. Most of the
respondents were older, with incomes of $100,000 or more.</TE>
<TE>   The survey was commissioned by Arts Orange County on behalf of the
county Board of Supervisors as part of a three-year marketing and
development project of the county and the arts community.</TE>
<TE>   The outcome coincides with results from the first statewide public
opinion survey presented by the California Arts Council last year,
said Arts Orange County executive director Bonnie Brittain Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Minicucci, deputy director of the California Arts Council,
agreed that the results could help the art councils develop long-term
strategies. "Both surveys show public support is deeper than we
expected," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Three very different nonprofit arts institutions in Laguna Beach
have become fund-raising allies, sharing a $60,000 grant aimed at
improving their chances of being remembered in donors' wills and
trust funds.</TE>
<TE>   The Laguna Playhouse, Laguna Art Museum and the Art Institute of
Southern California, a 300-student undergraduate college, will
receive the money--a grant from the Newport Beach-based Pacific Life
Foundation--over the next two years. They jointly will hire a
consultant to help them set up programs designed to make it easy for
donors to make death bequests. The consultant also will help solicit
prospective donors.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the three will approach its established contributors in
hopes of boosting income through "planned giving" programs. But they
also are interested in launching a new fund for bequests to benefit
them jointly.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more effective than if all three of us are trotting around
at the same time," said Alan Barkley, president of the Art Institute.
"It can look sort of as if we've got our act together."</TE>
<TE>   None of the three Laguna Beach institutions is large enough to
afford its own donation expert. The grant allows them to share one.
The consultant also will help the organizations do the legal
paperwork for receiving bequests, said Bolton Colburn, director of
the art museum. Now, Colburn said, people who want to leave money to
the museum must have their own lawyers handle the bequest. "A lot of
people would consider giving a gift if they knew we had a program
that makes it easy for them."</TE>
<TE>   The Laguna arts troika collaborated last year in pushing for a 20%
local hotel tax increase to benefit the city's arts organizations and
promote tourism.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Stein, the Laguna Playhouse's executive director, expects
the tax will yield about $50,000 this year for the theater. The
combined efforts have been possible, Stein said, because he, Colburn
and Barkley cooperate well. "We like each other and we get along."</TE>
