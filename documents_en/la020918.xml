<HD>The Sights, the Sounds, the Smells: It's Soccer Season</HD>

<LD>For 12 seasons now we've been coming to our soccer league's Opening
Day Parade of Teams, 2,500 kids with morning breath, dressed in the
bright colors of Post-It Notes. For me, it is the social event of the
year.</LD>
<LD>   "Hi, Coach," yells Ellen, last year's goalkeeper.</LD>
<LD>   "Hey, Coach," says Walt, one of last year's dads.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the time, I'm just another good-looking guy with a $12
haircut and a dopey, Opie, Ron Howard grin. But at opening day, I am
someone.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, Coach," one little girl says.</TE>
<TE>   "Who are you again?"</TE>
<TE>   "Your daughter," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "Likely story," I say.</TE>
<TE>   To our left, some mother is trying to thread her team banner onto
eight feet of wobbly plastic pipe. Twice now, I have nearly been
harpooned by mothers like these, rushing to assemble their banners.
It's like walking through a fondue pot.</TE>
<TE>   "Watch out," says the little girl, who grabs my hand, knowing her
father is a magnet for stupid behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "Over here," I say, pulling her along.</TE>
<TE>   With my luck, I'd get harpooned near vital organs (aren't most
organs vital?) and the ER doctors would decide that it would be safer
to leave the pole in.</TE>
<TE>   "Plus, your HMO won't cover it," a nurse would explain.</TE>
<TE>   So I'd wear a banner pole the rest of my life--4 feet sticking out
the front, 4 feet out the back.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, here comes the human shish kebab," my friends would joke at
backyard barbecues. After a while, I'd begin to shun such occasions,
or anything else that involves skewered meats.</TE>
<TE>   It goes well, this Opening Day Parade of Teams. There is a cool to
the morning air that wasn't there a month before.</TE>
<TE>   As always, the youngest kids go first, parading around the junior
college track in front of parents and other relatives.</TE>
<TE>   "Our next team is the Shooting Stars," the announcer says, and in
the stands, 12 sets of parents clap till their hands burn.</TE>
<TE>   "Our next team is the Vipers," the announcer says, and so on.</TE>
<TE>   Out on the field, we await our turn. We're in the middle of all
the teams. Above us, a mushroom cloud of morning breath has now
formed.</TE>
<TE>   And as the sun heats up, 5,000 little feet begin to sweat, many of
them in last year's soccer shoes, giving the whole place the aroma of
a tire factory. Or bad cheese.</TE>
<TE>   I stand there in the middle of it all, wondering how Notre Dame is
doing. Trying to remember what time UCLA kicks off.</TE>
<TE>   Next to me, a player hops on one foot, as if clearing an insect
from her ear.</TE>
<TE>   "What are you doing?" I ask.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopping," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody bring doughnuts?" someone else asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody seen our banner?" I ask, for the 10th time.</TE>
<TE>   "Hi, Coach," says another parent, stopping by to say hello.</TE>
<TE>   There is a sprinkling of original names among the parade of teams.
One team is called the "Ear Wax." Another team is the "Whatever."</TE>
<TE>   I can just picture that coach asking his players what they'd like
to be called.</TE>
<TE>   "So, what should our team name be?" he'd ask after an early season
practice.</TE>
<TE>   "The Shooting Stars!" one kid would shout.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody like that name?" the coach would say.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever," a tired 10-year-old would moan.</TE>
<TE>   And soccer history is made.</TE>
<TE>   In a few hours, we'll have our opening game, on a field where the
grass grows all the way up to the players' shins. Parents will put
their lawn chairs along the sidelines, in grass sticky from fruit
punch and Gatorade.</TE>
<TE>   Some things will go very well. Some things will go not so well.
That's the soccer life. That's opening day.</TE>
<TE>   But in my experience as a coach, there are certain things that
guarantee a good season. Follow them closely--or not at all--and you
will never regret it.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen rules for a successful soccer season (and a full,
well-rounded life):</TE>
<TE>   1) Be realistic with your expectations.</TE>
<TE>   2) Stress fundamentals.</TE>
<TE>   3) Stress team play.</TE>
<TE>   4) Delegate important responsibilities (since you'll probably
forget them all anyway).</TE>
<TE>   5) Be positive.</TE>
<TE>   6) Be negative.</TE>
<TE>   7) Be positive, then negative, then positive again.</TE>
<TE>   8) Draft lots of kids from Mexico and Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   9) Don't test your referee whistle in the minivan or the bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   10) Refrain from hugging mothers you're not married to, even after
big goals.</TE>
<TE>   11) Don't throw your clipboard in disgust (it'll guillotine your
foot).</TE>
<TE>   12) Don't skimp on the sunscreen.</TE>
<TE>   13) Remember your Valium.</TE>
<TE>   14. Just win, baby.</TE>
<TE>   15) Just win, win, win, win, win.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the most controversial of these rules are probably Nos. 14
and 15. Many coaches at this level downplay winning because it puts
too much pressure on the children.</TE>
<TE>   On our teams, we prefer to stress that winning is everything yet
nothing. All at once.</TE>
<TE>   "What's the score, Coach?" players will ask during games.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," I'll say.</TE>
<TE>   "Are we winning?" they'll ask.</TE>
<TE>   "Not sure," I'll say.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't because I don't care. It's because I'm lousy at math.
Two goals in the first half, three more in the second. Free kicks.
Penalty kicks. Who can keep track, what with all the parents
screaming and snoring and making all the other sideline sounds
parents make?</TE>
<TE>   So, our intent in every game is to score so many goals that it
doesn't matter how many we have exactly, only that we have more than
our opponents.</TE>
<TE>   It's like paying for breakfast in a foreign currency you haven't
quite grasped. You just overpay, trusting that you didn't just
finance some waiter's new villa.</TE>
<TE>   "We win, Coach?" they ask me after every game.</TE>
<TE>   "I think so," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "What was the score?"</TE>
<TE>   "Who am I, Copernicus?" I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever," they say.</TE>
<TE>   Let the games begin.</TE>

<HD>Fashion-Conscious Social Conscience</HD>
<DH>Designer Kenneth Cole is at it again with sleek advertising
that carries political messages</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL QUINTANILLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It looks like a typical newsstand scene: a woman engrossed in a
newspaper, a man gazing toward the racks and another walking away
gripping the headline of the day, "Holy War." Though the news is on
target, the staged scene is a fashion ad, accessorized with the
legend "Mideast peace is the must-have for fall."</LD>
<LD>   The ad--featuring male models in sleek, dark pinstriped suits, a
woman counterpart in a cargo pocketed trench coat and wool knit
hat--is part of New York designer Kenneth Cole's new campaign for his
fall collections. Long known for his sociopolitical marketing
messages and his company's creed, "To be aware is more important than
what you wear," he launched the campaign Sunday with newspaper
inserts in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Dallas,
Philadelphia and other metropolitan centers.</LD>
<LD>   Customers familiar with Cole and his campaigns know they can
expect this kind of thing from him, says Ruth P. Rubinstein,
sociologist and author of "Dress Codes: Meanings and Messages in
American Culture" (Westview Press, 2000), who teaches a clothing and
society class at New York's Fashion Institute of Technology.</LD>
<TE>   "A lot of people feel that way anyway, that there has to be peace
in the Middle East. Kenneth is really just putting his feelings and
money where his mouth is," Rubinstein says.</TE>
<TE>   But Cole's critics have said his messages (AIDS, homelessness, gun
control and reproductive rights, among others) are shameless
marketing tools to generate publicity for his company, Kenneth Cole
Productions, which has annual worldwide sales of $1 billion. Seven
months ago, critics accused him of exploiting the Sept. 11 terrorist
attack in a group of ads about how the tragedy brought Americans
closer together.</TE>
<TE>   "Our ads always begin with a conversation with Kenneth about
what's on his mind, what he's mad about, frustrated about. It becomes
an ongoing dialogue for weeks about the issues that are important to
him and relevant to the consumer," says Lori Wagner, senior vice
president in charge of marketing and advertising for Cole.</TE>
<TE>   "We work very close on the edge," she says about Cole's campaign
concepts, including the current one that features the slogan "Some
statements are more fashionable than others," a staple of Cole ads
for the last several seasons. The slogan is among a series of
provocative catchphrases in the insert: "Wearing protection is the
new black," "Not voting is so last season," "Gun safety ... it's all
the rage," "Security ... the accessory for fall," and "Choice. No
woman should be without one."</TE>
<TE>   Cole, 48, was unavailable for comment and because he was preparing
for his men's spring 2003 show tonight at Bryant Park in Manhattan
and for his women's show later in the week. As his firm's executive
creative director, the designer, who is married to Maria Cuomo,
daughter of former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, still writes ad copy
just as he did in 1983 when he founded his company and launched his
first advertisement promoting AIDS awareness, Wagner says.</TE>
<TE>   "Our current campaign represents the lifestyle of a Kenneth Cole
customer who looks forward to the messages and believes in the same
values that Kenneth believes in," Wagner says.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always been Kenneth's philosophy that the ads should be
expressive, a way to communicate to customers. Our voice is our brand
and our voice is Kenneth's voice. What he is hoping to do with these
statements is generate conversation and talk about issues that are
important. We get both positive and negative reaction," Wagner says,
adding that tonight's menswear show will feature a new television
commercial to launch Cole's new fragrance for men and women.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a typical fragrance commercial. It's not about romance
or flowers or puppies. I can't say it's controversial but hopefully
it will stir people in some way," she says about the spot featuring a
man and woman with opposing views on various subjects.</TE>
<TE>   The spot will break in 38 markets, including Los Angeles, next
week and is consistent with the company's national campaign, says
Wagner, who says Cole e-mails staff to remind them to vote at
election time.</TE>
<TE>   "People have always accused fashion designers of being frivolous
and meaningless rather than caring about society," says Rubinstein of
FIT.</TE>
<TE>   "But most people don't understand fashion. They think that people
in the industry are empty-headed and that the industry has no
feelings," she says, adding that other designers began to focus on
social issues three or four years ago hoping to change that image.
"For designers, maybe it takes care of their sense of guilt."</TE>
<TE>   Marshal Cohen, co-president of NPDFashionworld, a market
information company based in Port Washington, N.Y., says that in the
1990s controversial fashion ads were the sexy ones. "But political
and sociological issues have become something that consumers are
looking to associate with."</TE>
<TE>   "When everyone else was afraid to touch sociological issues,
Kenneth was not. More companies in the recent past have been doing
more about branding themselves as a company. But with Kenneth Cole,
there is an added feature--as a customer you're not only endorsing
the brand but there's that added dimension to make you feel what you
wear," Cohen says.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to see more of that kind of advertising/branding as
a trend because people today view the world as a smaller place and
consumers are looking to identify with a product that they buy now
more than before. It's about making a political statement and
designers like Cole are finding ways to be top-of-mind with
consumers."</TE>
<TE>   David Wolfe, creative director of New York-based Doneger Group, a
fashion trend consulting and forecasting firm, agrees, saying he
personally finds Cole's ads admirable. "Some people have a problem
using fashion advertising as a platform for his messages," he says.
"You can decide that's what he's doing, but I don't believe it. He's
simply taking advantage of the exposure.</TE>
<TE>   "In fact, fashion advertising is usually easy to ignore, and I
have a feeling that most people read Cole's advertising more than
they do fashion ads. They remember and buy the message before they
remember and buy the clothes," Wolfe says. "Often, fashionistas are
not known for their social awareness or social issues, and so I
think, maybe, Kenneth Cole is doing fashion readership a favor by
issuing his little wake-up call through his fashion advertising."</TE>

<LD>Foxes</LD>
<LD>   You might think that foxes, with their vertical slit eyes,
partially retractable claws, light body weight and long, bushy tails,
are members of the cat family. But these mammals are actually related
to dogs.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles Zoo recently opened a new habitat with three
different species of foxes--a pair of Channel Island foxes, a pair of
bat-eared foxes and a single red fox.</LD>
<TE>   * The Channel Island foxes are found only on some of the Channel
Islands off the coast of Southern California. The numbers have
dwindled because of changes in their native habitat and an abundance
of golden eagles preying upon them. At the zoo, the pair will be part
of a breeding program, in an effort to increase their population.</TE>
<TE>   * The bat-eared foxes are from South Africa, where they live in
dry open plains surrounded by wooded areas. They have large,
oval-shaped ears and sharp, pointed muzzles and look a lot like bats.</TE>
<TE>   * The red fox is the largest and most widespread fox in North
America. Despite the name, this species of fox can come in a variety
of colors.</TE>
<TE>   Foxes adapt very easily to their environment. Like humans, they
are omnivores, eating almost anything that is available. A typical
fox diet can range from small mammals such as mice, rats and
squirrels to earthworms, vegetables, insects and berries.</TE>
<TE>   You can learn more by visiting the zoo's foxes. Each of their
habitats was designed to depict their natural environment. For more
information, call (323) 644-6400 or visit www.lazoo.org.</TE>
<TE>   This information was provided by Judy Shay at the Los Angeles Zoo,
located in Griffith Park at the juncture of the 134 and 5 freeways.</TE>

<DH>New York-based Kiehl's brings no-glitz beauty products to
Santa Monica location</DH>

<AU>VALLI HERMAN-COHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hundreds of bottles stocked the shelves, fresh sea breezes wafted
through the doors and clerks strolled in their crisp white lab coats,
greeting fans at the newest outpost of Kiehl's, the venerable
151-year-old New York pharmacy and skin-care company.</LD>
<LD>   Tricky construction regulations caused an 18-day delay of the
opening of the Montana Avenue store in Santa Monica, which is no
biggie, considering Kiehl's let the entire 20th century pass without
building a second store. With the mail-order and wholesale businesses
growing fast, Kiehl's heiress and company president Jami Morse
Heidegger sold the family firm to L'Oreal two years ago, a move
that's helping to expand the business. A San Francisco boutique
opened last year, and in July, another opened in Boston.</LD>
<LD>   Local fans could barely stand the wait, though. The scene was
almost comic during those early August days as a steady stream of
customers arrived, only to be turned away, bereft of joy and
Pineapple Papaya Facial Scrub. Soon enough, however, the company
appeased visitors the same way it's attracted them for years--by
handing out generous free samples of the 111 formulas for adults,
babies and even horses.</LD>
<TE>   Kiehl's has operated since 1851 at 13th Street and 3rd Avenue in
New York and along the way built a loyal following. Unlike many skin
and beauty products that put hope in a jar in the name of science,
Kiehl's hypes its anti-hype approach. Detailed labels on the plain
plastic bottles explain the efficacy of each product and its
ingredients, whether it's a $5 lip balm or a $26 water-based
moisturizing sunscreen.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not a glitzy company," said company spokeswoman Shannon
Cooney.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, men--who make up a third of all shoppers--flock to
the no-nonsense formulas and packaging. The store decor is as
gender-neutral as it is respectful of history. Marble-topped
counters, pressed-tin ceilings and apothecary jars mix with modern
beakers, brushed steel cabinets and contemporary lighting. Slightly
kitsch elements--such as a baby photo wall and a surfboard--connect
to the community, and a faux human skeleton represents the old
apothecary. The store's quasi-laboratory environment aims to offer
the kind of atmosphere and service that was common in old-fashioned
pharmacies like the original Kiehl's.</TE>
<TE>   Name a beauty or skin problem, and the clerks usually have a
product and a regimen ready. They're not squeamish about discussing
the subtleties of your blemishes because they have probably a dozen
different ways to treat them.</TE>
<TE>   True to its quirky nature, until this month Kiehl's didn't have
eye-makeup remover--a sure seller in most skin-care lines--because it
hadn't arrived in a satisfactory formula. As with other items,
customer requests led to its introduction.</TE>
<TE>   Though the products are unassuming, they reflect the company's
long and colorful history, and especially that of the Morse family,
which has operated Kiehl's for the last 81 years. In 1921, Irving
Morse purchased the business from John Kiehl and expanded it into a
full-service pharmacy, one of the first to develop an anti-cavity
fluoride treatment. As he and successive generations developed the
enterprise, they added products and decor that reflected their
interests--from motorcycles to acrobatic stunt planes to race cars.</TE>
<TE>   Second-generation owner Aaron Morse, a motorcycle enthusiast,
hired Hells Angels as the East Village store's security force in the
'70s. His daughter Jami brought rich creams to aid skin callused by
exercise classes. Her husband, world champion skier Klaus Heidegger,
inspired a line of sport products, such as a swimmer's shampoo. Their
daughter Nicoletta's interest in horses led to three equine products.
Though they don't sell dog shampoo, they do offer canines a water
fountain and a snack.</TE>
<TE>   Also in the '70s, Morse worked with Neiman Marcus in Beverly Hills
to begin selling the products outside of the New York store for the
first time and expanded their reach into Hollywood. An
attention-getting service delivered the goods around L.A.: Morse
trained his pet chimpanzee to emerge from a white limousine or a red
Ferrari, tote packages to the door, and ring the bell.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll still have delivery in Los Angeles," Cooney said, "but I
wouldn't expect a monkey to be ringing any bells."</TE>

<HD>Vidal's War of Words With Editor Continues</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM RUTTEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Gore Vidal's 1981 bestselling novel, "Creation," the
narrator--imperial Persian emissary Cyrus Spitama--describes his
young nephew thusly: "Democritus is studying philosophy here at
Athens. This means that he delights in quarrels."</LD>
<LD>   So, too, does Vidal, who is as famous for his capacity for lasting
animosities as he is for his acidic tongue.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, when Doubleday--Vidal's current publisher--issued a
"restored edition" of "Creation," an unusual author's note had been
inserted, blaming--but not naming--his former editor, Jason Epstein,
for poor editing.</LD>
<TE>   "Through various intricate but relentless stratagems," writes
Vidal, "he managed to cut a number of key scenes."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Epstein dismissed the author's note as "vintage Gore"
and said he hadn't thought much of the book at the time. "I could
have cut anything and it would have been an improvement," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Vidal, who was in Norway and unavailable last week, has replied.
In a four-page fax he titled "Editors," and in a phone conversation
from his villa in Ravello, Italy, he disparaged not only his former
editor but also contemporary American publishing, which Epstein
helped shape.</TE>
<TE>   Vidal pointed out that "I have never before talked about Epstein
in public. That author's note is as close as I have come." And, in
it, "I simply refer to him as an 'overly busy editor.' Pure flattery.
Epstein is never busy; sloth, self-promotion and neo-Automat cooking
are his sluggish activities." (The latter is a reference to Epstein's
frequent essays on dining and cooking for various publications.)</TE>
<TE>   "When it comes to my books," Vidal said, "editors--as opposed to
copy editors--have not been needed. The popular romantic notion that
a wise, self-effacing editor must always save a mindless genius by
restructuring his work for him began with Max Perkins of Scribners.
Today, semiliterate editors reshape, rewrite illiterate 'authors.' "</TE>
<TE>   Vidal also took issue with other Random House editors' assertion
that many of Epstein's reservations about "Creation," which is set in
the 5th century B.C., sprang from Epstein's own longtime interest in
antiquity.</TE>
<TE>   "For the record," Vidal said, "Epstein has no known interest in
antiquity or in any other past save his own as the self-proclaimed
creator of today's publishing industry. Apart from cookbooks and the
lives of big money New Yorkers, he reads little.... The general
ignorance of people in book publishing is appalling," he went on,
"though reflective of the rest of the American population. It's just
that people in publishing have to do more bluffing."</TE>
<TE>   Epstein, reached at his home in New York on Tuesday, declined to
comment on most of Vidal's assertions.</TE>
<TE>   Vidal does credit Epstein with retaining leading scholars to
consult on the research for his historical novels. "That was very
useful to me," Vidal said.</TE>
<TE>   The author also noted that "Creation" was fulsomely praised by
both Anthony Burgess--some of whose comments serve as a preface to
the revised edition--and by Mary Renault, perhaps the leading
English-language novelist of classical antiquity. In fact, Vidal
recalled that in her essay on the redacted version of "Creation" for
the New York Review of Books, Renault wrote, "It is a very long time
since I read a book of more than 500 pages with no awareness of its
length, beyond a wish at the end that it was longer."</TE>
<TE>   The point, Vidal said, "is that Renault is the expert and Burgess
is a first-rate critic--two hats never worn by Mr. Epstein."</TE>
<TE>   Vidal was particularly biting about Epstein's abilities as an
editor of fiction.</TE>
<TE>   "Years ago," Vidal recalled, "Epstein gave me the manuscript of a
novel," saying, "I've got to publish this, I think. I won't tell you
who wrote it, but I hate it and there's a contract. Tell me what you
think."</TE>
<TE>   "I told him it was a marvelously funny novel," said Vidal.</TE>
<TE>   According to Vidal, Epstein replied, " 'But the guy in it turns
into a breast!'</TE>
<TE>   " 'Well that's better than a cockroach,' I said, trying to look on
the sunny commercial side.</TE>
<TE>   "Reluctantly, he published Philip Roth's 'Breast' (1972). Roth
then left Random House. Epstein mourned his departure.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Why did he leave?' " Vidal recalled Epstein asking.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Because,' I said, 'we all know when we have an editor who
doesn't get it and never will.' "</TE>
<TE>   "I have no memory of any of that," Epstein said Tuesday, "and I
doubt I would have done such a thing. I might have discussed the book
with Gore, but I certainly never would have given him the manuscript
to read.</TE>
<TE>   "Actually, I rather like 'Breast,' which I think is a very funny
book, and I was happy to publish it. Philip, by the way, left Random
House because he got a much better offer for his next two books than
we were prepared to match."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Epstein insisted that he still thinks of Vidal as a
friend, even though they last spoke two decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   "That's optimistic, isn't it," Vidal sniffed. "What he thinks of
as friendship, I recall otherwise. He was genial and generally no
bother. I gave him my books and he published them," Vidal said.</TE>
<TE>   The author said that, looking back on that period, his greatest
regret was leaving his first publisher, Little Brown, for the larger
Random House. "Epstein was the judgment of God on me for leaving the
honorable people at Little Brown.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want this to be a morality tale, add that note. I ended up
having as my editor a megalomaniac with a cooking problem."</TE>

<LD>   The words in italics are stage directions that give you
information about the scene and tell you what to do. Have fun reading
the lines and acting out the parts!</LD>
<LD>   The characters for Scene 3 are Mac, Clifford, Cleo and T-Bone.
They are tossing a beach ball.</LD>
<TE>   T-BONE: Here it comes, Mac!</TE>
<TE>   Mac smacks it toward Clifford.</TE>
<TE>   MAC: It's all yours, Clifford!</TE>
<TE>   Clifford balances the bouncing ball on his nose--then tosses it to
Cleo as she stands frowning at Clifford.</TE>
<TE>   CLEO: (teasing) That's Princess Cleo....</TE>
<TE>   CLIFFORD: Oh, sorry, Cleo. I mean, Princess Cleo.</TE>
<TE>   MAC: Go on, Princess Cleo--go get the ball and let's keep playing!</TE>
<TE>   CLEO: You know, Mac--I don't think a princess should have to chase
after her own ball. Why don't you go and get it for me?</TE>
<TE>   MAC: Why would I do that?</TE>
<TE>   CLEO: Chasing a ball can make a dog very tired. And a princess
should never be allowed to get too tired.</TE>
<TE>   T-BONE: I'll go get it for you. I don't want you to get too tired,
Princess Cleo.</TE>
<TE>   CLEO: Thank you, T-Bone.</TE>
<TE>   Clifford drops his head down to Cleo.</TE>
<TE>   CLIFFORD: Gosh, Cleo. I thought the rules were that whoever missed
the ball had to go and get it.</TE>
<TE>   CLEO: That's still the rule, Clifford. But the rules are different
for me. I am a princess, after all.</TE>
<TE>   Just then T-Bone rolls the ball to Cleo.</TE>
<TE>   T-BONE: Here you go, your majesty!</TE>
<TE>   CLEO: Great! Now let's play "Keep Away"! Try to get the ball from
me, T!</TE>
<TE>   She starts to run, pushing the ball with her nose.</TE>
<TE>   T-BONE: Huh? Hey wait, Cleo. You can't change games in the middle
of playing!</TE>
<TE>   CLEO: Oh yes I can. I'm a princess! Heh, heh, heh!</TE>
<TE>   Cleo takes off running with the ball.</TE>

<HD>Helping You to Roam, as in Italy</HD>
<DH>Vespas and other hot-selling scooters afford a zippy ride
plus a cool image</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HILARY E. MacGREGOR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a recent morning, Gary Newman set off for work from his Studio
City home on his chromed-out Vespa. He tucked his colorful tie into
his sweater and strapped on his helmet. As he sped by a local golf
course, men turned to watch. When he stopped, they crowded around
like young boys to take a look.</LD>
<LD>   "You need a beautiful woman on the back," yelled one man. "With
her hands in the air ... like this!"</LD>
<LD>   Newman, 50, who sells lawn crypts for Mount Sinai Memorial Park,
had a Vespa 30 years ago and had dreamed of having another ever
since. Shortly after a Vespa boutique opened in Sherman Oaks in late
2000, Newman rushed to get one. He bought a white one for $4,000
because his son told him it looked sexy. He invested another $4,000
in chroming it out and putting in a racing engine. And though he got
it for kicks, before long it became his main mode of transportation.
He has since logged 11,000 miles on the scooter, and his four-door
BMW 528i often sits in the garage. "I tell you," he says, "this is
just a lot more fun."</LD>
<TE>   Today's scooter fad cuts across gender and age demographics. Motor
scooters are much easier to ride than motorcycles and are
characterized by a step-through design. Generally, they have smaller
engines than motorcycles, automatic transmissions and smaller wheels.
They appeal to both genders. Riders are old-time aficionados and
young hipsters, millionaires who take their scooters on their yachts
to Caribbean islands, college students who zip around campus.</TE>
<TE>   And not just in L.A. Nationwide, motor scooter sales have more
than quadrupled in the last six years, according to the Irvine-based
Motorcycle Industry Council. In 1996, 12,000 scooters were sold
nationwide. Three years later, the figure had more than doubled to
25,000. And by 2001, sales of scooters reached 50,000.</TE>
<TE>   Some manufacturers attribute the revival of scooter chic to the
surge of Italian designs hitting the American market. Italian
manufacturer Aprilia entered the U.S. market at the end of 1999, and
after a nearly 20-year hiatus, Piaggio relaunched its retooled,
retro, eco-friendly Vespa stateside with the Sherman Oaks boutique
and hopes to open its 80th shop by early next year.</TE>
<TE>   Both scooters and motorcycles have enjoyed a surge in popularity
in recent years due to better technology, more interesting designs
and improved niche marketing. Indeed, some of today's scooters--such
as Aprilia's Atlantic 500, and Honda's Silver Wing, which sells for
about $7,500--are beginning to blur the line between scooters and
motorcycles, in both their appearance and engine size.</TE>
<TE>   "The level of development in two-wheel technology in the last
decade is really wonderful," says Ty van Hooydonk, a spokesman for
the Motorcycle Industry Council. "Scooters are a lot better than they
have ever been. These really are the golden days of motorcycling and
scooters."</TE>
<TE>   But for most scooter buyers, it's all about image.</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S., Piaggio doesn't focus on selling a scooter. It
focuses on selling a lifestyle. "It's like a Mercedes or a BMW," says
Mike Malamut, president of Vespa of California, who runs the Sherman
Oaks, Santa Monica and Newport Beach boutiques.</TE>
<TE>   Scooters were designed in Italy as runabouts to get you around
town inexpensively, but Vespas sold in the United States are "more
like a toy, or a luxury item," Malamut says.</TE>
<TE>   In Italy, where the roads are narrow, parking places scarce and
gas more expensive, scooters are simply a mode of transportation.
"They are a way to go from A to B," says Giancarlo Fantappie,
president of Piaggio USA.</TE>
<TE>   But in the United States the strategy is different: Vespa
boutiques here are slick and futuristic. In Sherman Oaks, banners of
movie stars riding Vespas adorn one wall. Customers can sip
cappuccinos brewed on the premises as they look at
accessories--helmets, trunks, T-shirts, even soap. Piaggio brought in
its own Italian designers to create the store, importing every
detail, down to the light fixtures from Italy. "The whole concept of
the boutique is not the motor scooter per se," says Fantappie. "It is
to sell a little piece of Italy."</TE>
<TE>   The scooter-as-fashion marketing approach appears to be benefiting
non-Vespa scooter vendors as well. Scooter manufacturers such as
Honda and Yamaha sell their scooters alongside motorcycles, not out
of a separate boutique. Some dealers find the current scooter cachet
is pulling in a new clientele in search of cool.</TE>
<TE>   But that Italian influence is affecting what customers are asking
for. Due to customer demand, Yamaha in 2001 introduced the Vino
Classic, a $1,600 scooter with a 49-cc engine. The scooter was
specifically designed to appeal to customers' fetish for European
flair, with rounded, more organic styling and smooth, swooping lines.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been a lot of European scooters that have come over
here and sparked a lot of interest," says Brad Banister, spokesman
for Yamaha Motor Corp., USA.</TE>
<TE>   "We are playing on the Italian name. When customers say they want
a scooter, they have the Vino scooter in their heads. It is
Italian-looking, two-tone, zippy and really, really inexpensive."</TE>
<TE>   Piaggio's Fantappie believes that Vespa has not only boosted
overall scooter sales in the United States, but believes the company
is altering the way Americans think of scooters. "Thanks to our name,
and the presence of Vespa in major metropolitan areas, I really
believe there is a change in the way Americans see scooters,"
Fantappie says. "People start considering that with Vespa they can
get around in style. They are sexy, cool and fun."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, but they're no Harley. One challenge scooter vendors face
is the macho factor. In Italy, a man with a Vespa is the ultimate
Romeo, darting through traffic with a girl on the back. Young men
court on Vespas, and bring their fiancees home to Mama on Vespas. But
American men often have to overcome macho pride to sit atop a cute,
automatic scooter.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Frishman, 56, of San Diego, who is an avid bicyclist, wanted
something he could ride outside with his wife, who doesn't like to
cycle with him. He got a scooter. That's when the needling from his
office mates began.</TE>
<TE>   But Frishman's riding tall. "There is a line you cross over from
dorky to cool," he says. "I think I have crossed over that line."</TE>
<TE>   Now, no matter where he goes, people come up and talk to him. "We
are just having a blast," Frishman says. "The best part is, my wife
is sitting right behind me. She has her arms around me all the time."</TE>
<TE>   When he finds himself at a stoplight in the middle of a pack of
hard-core Harley-Davidson riders, all decked out in leather, their
loud tailpipes backfiring like minor explosions, he leans over and
says, "Mighty fancy scooter you got there."</TE>
<TE>   A few weekends ago, Frishman and his wife rode to Coronado. He
parked his Vespa next to three Harleys. The Harley guys and Frishman
and his wife all sat at window tables, peering out.</TE>
<TE>   "People were walking along the sidewalk, and we could just hear
them talking," Frishman recalls. "Here are all these fancy
motorcycles, and they were ignoring them, looking at the Vespa,
saying, 'Look at the little trunk on the back, the matching
helmets.... '</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't had so much fun in a long time," he says.</TE>

<DH>Women gather at the spot where many found their voices in
the '70s and blossomed</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNELL GEORGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a desolate stretch of Spring Street, beyond downtown's high-rise
chessboard and the pungent crush of Chinatown, the only signs of life
besides the occasional passing sedan or pacing yard dog are pink
balloons, tied to the facade of an old brick warehouse and tugged by
an intermittent wind.</LD>
<LD>   Even without balloons, the stout red-brick building has long
resembled some sort of out-of-season blossom. Which is what this
structure--the Woman's Building--was in its heyday: the outgrowth of
a stubborn life force pushing out of inhospitable, if not impossible,
circumstances.</LD>
<LD>   On this glowing Sunday afternoon, there is not just one bloom to
marvel at on the building's grounds, but many, a garden of activists,
teachers, mothers, performance artists, poets. Art pieces themselves,
they're draped in bright silks or dress-down denim, hair freshly
hennaed, gelled or cropped close, bodies ornamented with Bakelite
bangles, tattoos or cat's-eye glasses.</LD>
<TE>   Nearly 100 women (and a smattering of men) ascend the crumbling
concrete steps. And when they squeeze through the doors, they
reignite the spare interior simply with their presence.</TE>
<TE>   Many of these women grew up here, and the ideas that flourished
inside have lived on in their works and memories. Founded by graphic
designer Sheila Levrant de Bretteville, art historian Arlene Raven
and artist Judy Chicago, whose project "The Dinner Party" sought to
recognize women's achievement and expression in history, the Woman's
Building became a North Star on a dream map for women who were
looking to redefine their lives and work.</TE>
<TE>   Until it closed 10 years ago and was converted to artists'
studios, it was a safe haven for those embarking on political and/or
artistic endeavors and desiring a woman-centered environment in which
to do so. And its history--rich, splintered, groundbreaking--is the
subject of a new book, "Insurgent Muse: Life and Art at the Woman's
Building" (City Lights) by Terry Wolverton--a good enough excuse for
a long overdue party.</TE>
<TE>   Just as they once traveled great physical distances, often from
small towns in wide-open states, now, decades later, these women have
journeyed from university posts, nonprofit chairmanships, their
artist studios and their backyard barbecues to pay tribute and again
reassess.</TE>
<TE>   A Collage of Memories</TE>
<TE>   Bits of memories are offered up, forming a collage: "Remember the
dances on the third floor? Consciousness-raising on the railroad
tracks? Dianic Mechanics? When we tore a whole car apart and then did
performances about it?"</TE>
<TE>   Back in 1973, the plan was to create a space that would offer
instruction and discussion in a wide range of disciplines--creative
writing, graphic design, performance art, video and visual arts. The
descriptor "public center," Wolverton explains in the book's
introduction, "signified the wish to make a place for women artists
in the mainstream, while 'women's culture' revealed more subversive
intentions." Here women would be encouraged to delve into a range of
studies often cast to the margins--women's spirituality, lesbian
politics and making art that reflected a woman's point of view,
unfiltered by male sensibilities.</TE>
<TE>   As well as creating a meeting place, the founders developed an
alternative program--a philosophy of spirit--for women's art
education. Called the Feminist Studio Workshop, or FSW, its goal was
to link the pressing issues of the women's movement with a basic arts
and art history curriculum. The center grew to offer a range of
resources--galleries, theater groups, a Sisterhood Bookstore annex,
an office for the National Organization for Women, a coffeehouse and
a feminist travel agency.</TE>
<TE>   It was a place to "experience oneself as both woman and artist,"
writes Wolverton, who tried on incarnations ranging from student to
teacher to executive director in her 13-year association. For women,
she explains, the center was an antidote to a culture that "proved to
be a funhouse mirror, distorting and diminishing, a surface into
which you walked and then disappeared."</TE>
<TE>   It was a community--lesbian, straight, artists, activists--that
encouraged all involved to develop an "authentic voice," says
Wolverton. And it provided an audience eager to hear and challenge
those voices.</TE>
<TE>   This late summer party is no different, observes Eloise Klein
Healy, watching conversation fly. "It's like a sauna in here!" she
continues, fanning herself with one of the pink programs outlining
the day's events--an opening ritual, music, readings and
remembrances. "But it always was. When it would fill up and things
got going, it was always like this. This buzz," she says, chuckling.</TE>
<TE>   Healy, a poet and the former chair of the MFA creative writing
program at Antioch University, first caught wind of the Woman's
Building in on a flier in 1975. She stayed 15 years, doing everything
from washing windows and hanging Sheetrock to serving on the board.
"I didn't know any women writers at the time," she recalls, "I was
kind of floundering. Didn't know what to do. I had been taught by a
lot of literature professors, not writers." Certainly not women who
were busy shoving away boundaries. Here, women set about rewriting
old texts and ideas, chapter after chapter.</TE>
<TE>   Spirits of the Past</TE>
<TE>   Reunions are full of ghostly images, and one struggles with tricks
of memory. Who was that person I meant to be? Who is this person I am
now? Did I hold up my end?</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes I think, 'My God did that all happen?' " says
photographer Maria Karras, delivering her testimony into a dented
microphone. "It's very spooky when you think about the sprits that
brought us here." Women traveled from Missouri, Virginia, Kentucky,
New Mexico and Canada, she recalls, providing "the labor that built
these walls."</TE>
<TE>   There is lots to be proud of, says Pat Akers, an executive
recruiter and tai chi teacher, her hands shoved into the back pockets
of her jet-black jeans, surveying the room as if it were an expanse
of land. Old faces have jarred some stowed memories. "It's like a
homecoming!" she enthuses. "Back then, in L.A. you had two types of
feminists--there were the 'Dinner Party' women and the Woman's
Building women. In 1979, when the 'Dinner Party' project was
finished, a lot of us came down to the Woman's Building."</TE>
<TE>   Akers was involved in two Woman's Building-based projects--the
Women's Graphic Arts Center and Women Against Violence Against Women,
which was one of the key voices in a high-profile protest of the
Rolling Stones' 1976 album "Black and Blue" ad campaign, which
featured a battered woman. "We brought that billboard down."</TE>
<TE>   Seeing the women who've come together to celebrate the building's
history, says Akers, "you remember that sense of community. It was
feminism in its best traditional sense: to honor ourselves as women.
Being here forced me to find that part of myself. It really helped me
to describe and define what I wanted."</TE>
<TE>   Karen Sterling, now a counselor at Hamilton High School in Los
Angeles, wasn't at the Woman's Building during the heady, crazy '70s
but was there at the end to carefully crate up the evidence of its
creative output--posters and other printed ephemera, which went to
the Smithsonian Institution, and performance videos and a library
that went to Otis Art Institute, Los Angeles. "What they have up here
now, the posters? Just a twinkle of an eye of what this place
produced ... all under the auspices of feminism."</TE>
<TE>   Offering thanks, performer Anna Homler sings and plays a toy
accordion. Healy reads poetry from volumes that in some way, large or
small, were put together by the Woman's Building. And a special
guest, the folksinger Phranc, bounds up to the stage in trademark
flat-top and stovepipe jeans, waving her old FSW card and proudly
showing off her old bad mood. "I had a really good look back then.
Angry. And if you crossed my path and you were straight...." She
strums through the floating ellipses on a worn guitar, the music far
from angry now, a counterbalance to her former self.</TE>
<TE>   "When I dropped out of school at 17 to become who I wanted ... I
came here. You were my family, my community and my high school. It
was here that I learned about tolerance." She leans into the first
lines of a song, "I respect you, I really appreciate the things you
do...."</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting on the Journey</TE>
<TE>   Conversations bounce off the freshly whitewashed walls. Women
stand amid bountiful wrought-iron tables that are draped in pink
cloths, strewn with grapes, rose petals and almonds.</TE>
<TE>   For all of the hugs and tears, what's been rolling around many
minds are questions: Did they succeed? Had the Woman's Building been
an absurd journey? Just a tangent?</TE>
<TE>   To Wolverton, the day's flurry of longing remembrances and passion
suggests that what was started isn't finished, that there is, in the
gathering, the insurgent power of not just a movement but of bold,
original thought.</TE>
<TE>   Florence Rosen takes her turn before the microphone. Her red
metallic eyeglass frames match the cherry socks peeking out of her
Birkenstocks. "Back in 1978, I knew this was cooking down here, but I
was cooking at home," she recalls with a wistful smile. "At 50, I
would see these women communicating and confident. I didn't have
that. I wanted to have that feeling."</TE>
<TE>   That "feeling."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the Woman's Building seemed to grace those who entered
with magic powers--those of confidence and clarity. For many women,
the experience opened a passageway, led them to begin to understand
they could be anything they wanted to be.</TE>
<TE>   And more important than any structure, any building, was one
understanding: As Wolverton writes, "The truth is that there was not
one, but two Woman's Buildings. This building was intrinsically the
foundation for the second--that grander gleaming manse of your
imagination."</TE>
<TE>   Terry Wolverton will read from and sign "Insurgent Muse" this
evening at 7 at the Central Library, Mark Taper Auditorium, 5th &amp;
Flower streets, downtown Los Angeles. Reservations: (213) 228-7025.</TE>

<HD>World Festival Loses Another Attraction to Visa
Difficulties</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The World Festival of Sacred Music on Tuesday announced the loss of
another of its best-known international attractions--a Syrian troupe
of whirling dervishes--due to turmoil in the Middle East and
stepped-up security precautions that have prompted U.S. consulates to
delay or deny visas to performing artists from countries considered
havens for terrorists. Two singers missed performances at the
festival's opening Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   New, post-Sept. 11 visa restrictions also have jeopardized another
prime attraction, a Balinese gamelan orchestra set to make its U.S.
debut, director Judy Mitoma said. The 16-day Los Angeles festival,
which began Saturday, encompasses 55 events in venues across the
city.</LD>
<LD>   Festival organizers knew that visas would be difficult given new
security restrictions, Mitoma said. "We got a head start, got all the
papers in line, but at this point it doesn't matter" when the artists
are trying to travel from nations identified as trouble spots. She
said the difficulties only reaffirm the purpose of a festival
committed to reflecting the religious diversity of Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Rahat Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, a noted singer of Islamic qawwali
music, missed his scheduled appearance at the festival's opening gala
at UCLA's Royce Hall, but not because of visa problems, Mitoma said.
Turmoil in his home country of Pakistan prevented him from getting a
flight in time. Najwa Gibran, a Toronto-based singer of Arabic music,
was prevented from joining the Los Angeles-based multiethnic Yuval
Ron Ensemble in a performance at the UCLA Hammer Museum.</TE>
<TE>   Ron, an Israeli-raised American Jew, said that Gibran, a
25-year-old Israeli Arab with Canadian citizenship, was turned back
twice by border patrol agents while trying to catch flights from
Buffalo, N.Y. Ron said agents claimed she might stay to work
illegally in the U.S. and refused to read documents showing she was
engaged to perform at the festival. Mitoma said that the Whirling
Dervishes of Damascus canceled appearances on Sept. 28-29 after being
told by U.S. consular officials in Syria that it was unlikely they
would get visas in time. The Syrians already "were very nervous"
about coming to the United States at a time of high tension between
the U.S. and Arab world over Iraq, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Mitoma said she spent all day Monday talking to consular officials
and trying to enlist California congressional representatives on
behalf of Cudamani, the gamelan group from Bali, which needs visa
clearance by Thursday afternoon to catch its flight. Its tour
includes festival performances Sept. 28 at the Wilshire Ebell Theater
and Sept. 29 at the Greek. Stuart Patt, a spokesman for the consular
affairs bureau of the U.S. State Department, said the government is
"working out ways to speed up the process" for visas.</TE>

<HD>'Courageous Steps' Views Reeve's Work in Progress</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Christopher Reeve has come up well short of the goal he had set for
himself five years ago for his 50th birthday. But he is far from
disappointed.</LD>
<LD>   In 1997, two years after he became paralyzed from a severe spinal
cord injury suffered in an equestrian competition, the actor made
famous for his role as Superman in several films, said he hoped to be
walking by Sept. 25 of this year. He was determined to prove wrong
the doctors who had said he would never walk again.</LD>
<LD>   As his 50th birthday approaches, Reeve still cannot walk, is
paralyzed from the neck down and cannot breathe without a respirator.
But he has demonstrated amazing progress in regaining movement in his
right wrist, left fingers and both legs that has him and doctors
filled with optimism.</LD>
<TE>   Reeve's improvement has been chronicled in a documentary,
"Christopher Reeve: Courageous Steps," airing tonight on ABC. The
special is narrated by Reeve and directed by his 22-year-old son,
Matthew.</TE>
<TE>   Footage from the special includes Reeve receiving treatment as
part of a study of the effect of exercise on recovery of function for
paralyzed patients, conducted at St. Louis' Washington University
School of Medicine. He can feel a pin prick over the majority of his
body and has regained limited movement in most of his joints. His
speaking and breathing is not as forced as before, and his balance in
sitting has improved.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're trying to show is that conventional wisdom is falling
by the wayside," Reeve said earlier this week in a phone interview.
"We want to show that it's possible to have recovery several years
after the injury."</TE>
<TE>   Reeve also had criticism for government restrictions on
controversial stem cell research that might have brought him and
other patients even more progress.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1998, research became controversial after embryonic stem cells
were isolated at the University of Wisconsin," Reeve said. "And I
feel we've lost almost four years of significant progress because
first the Clinton administration and then the Bush administration
have had to wrestle with the ethics and morality of their use."</TE>
<TE>   He added, "If it is not that controversial and if there had been
full government funding of embryonic stem cell research, I believe we
would be in human trials by now. And there might have been a
possibility of realizing the goal that I stated in 1995. However,
that's pure speculation. The next step, obviously, is to proceed and
to make sure that scientists are funded to do the best
research--cutting-edge research, whether or not it involves stem
cells or ... whatever it is."</TE>
<TE>   Reeve's progress did not begin until five years after his injury.
The special shows how he is able to be more active in his life and
with his family.</TE>
<TE>   Working on the project with his son brought them closer together,
Reeve said. The idea for the documentary originated with Matthew
Reeve, who graduated from Brown University in May with a degree in
Visual Art and Modern Culture &amp; Media.</TE>
<TE>   "Having Matthew film me made all the difference in the world,"
Reeve said. "It gives the whole project a fly-on-the-wall look at my
life that would not have been possible. I would not have revealed
myself in this way to other filmmakers."</TE>
<TE>   The documentary also reveals candid observations from Reeve about
his inability to be intimate with his wife, or to be able to give his
children a hug.</TE>
<TE>   "People are used to seeing me at events like fund-raisers, or
making speeches at the Oscars, and that's when I have everything
pulled together," he said. "But this film shows what really goes on
daily."</TE>
<TE>   "Christopher Reeve: Courageous Steps" will be shown at 10 tonight
on ABC.</TE>

<DH>HBO records its biggest audience ever with the season
premiere of 'The Sopranos,' beating the networks in its time slot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Sopranos" hit a record-shattering high note for Home Box Office
on Sunday, as the pay-cable series' long-deferred fourth-season
premiere dominated the ratings, while striking fear into the hearts
of the major networks.</LD>
<LD>   Estimates from Nielsen Media Research indicate that 13.4 million
people were watching one of HBO's channels while "The Sopranos"
aired--the pay channel's biggest audience ever, eclipsing the show's
2001 premiere by 2 million viewers.</LD>
<LD>   That audience would have placed "Sopranos" sixth among all
prime-time programs last week--a stunning figure given that HBO is
received by roughly a third of the 106.7 million homes with
television in the U.S. The program easily won its time period,
beating all the broadcast networks, which have yet to launch their
new seasons.</LD>
<TE>   Tune-in for "The Sopranos" clearly caught the attention of network
officials, who privately said that it exceeded their projections--a
sentiment echoed by HBO.</TE>
<TE>   "This was above what most bright and logical minds thought we
would do," said Dave Baldwin, HBO's executive vice president of
program planning. "This was a big number."</TE>
<TE>   The question now is how well the series will hold up over its
13-week run against original competition--having previously played in
the spring and summer, when it faced more reruns.</TE>
<TE>   The series will continue the next 12 weeks, facing such events as
the Emmy Awards this Sunday as well as the second--and if necessary
seventh--game of the World Series. ("Sopranos" isn't an Emmy
contender this season because it wasn't shown during the eligibility
period.)</TE>
<TE>   The third season of "The Sopranos" did drop after its premiere,
averaging about 9 million viewers. As The Times reported recently,
audience estimates for the program are imprecise, since Nielsen does
not break out HBO programs individually, instead lumping together the
number of people watching any of its channels at a given moment.</TE>
<TE>   Still, HBO runs each episode five times per week, and Baldwin
noted that the channel pays more attention to the overall percentage
of subscribers that watch, which topped 30% during the third season.
Because HBO doesn't sell advertising, it measures success by
subscriber satisfaction, as reflected by who signs up for or cancels
the service.</TE>
<TE>   "Sopranos" set the bar almost impossibly high for the series that
followed, the Emmy-nominated Larry David comedy "Curb Your
Enthusiasm." Almost 60% of HBO viewers tuned out once "The Sopranos"
ended.</TE>

<HD>'Trapped' in an Uneasy Moment</HD>
<DH>Movies* The new thriller, about the kidnapping of a child,
opens this weekend; the studio is scaling back advertising,
promotion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANITA M. BUSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Columbia Pictures' thriller "Trapped," which centers on the abduction
of an 8-year-old girl, has proved too close to real life for the
studio's comfort. The movie bows this weekend, only days after a jury
recommended the death sentence for David Westerfield in the murder of
7-year-old Danielle van Dam, culminating what seemed like an endless
summer of child kidnappings and murders.</LD>
<LD>   In response to the news environment, the studio did an about-face
on its initial ad campaign and adopted an unusual marketing strategy
to open a film: imposing a media blackout and keeping its stars off
the normal promotional circuit.</LD>
<LD>   Billed as a thriller, "Trapped" stars Kevin Bacon and Courtney
Love as kidnappers of an 8-year-old asthmatic girl and Charlize
Theron as the mother who defies the FBI and tries to save her
daughter's life.</LD>
<TE>   The film was directed by Luis Mandoki, whose track record includes
"Angel Eyes" and "Message in a Bottle," which received tepid reviews
and were not standouts at the box office.</TE>
<TE>   Concerns over the quality of the film could be an issue. Its only
audiences so far have been made up of film buyers for the nation's
theater chains.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to throttle any chance of negative reviews or news
reports, nervous studio executives kept film critics and media from
seeing the film before its release. There was no press junket for
"Trapped," and the studio asked its actors not to talk about the
film.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't want Jay Leno looking at Kevin Bacon and saying, 'What
the hell were you thinking in making a film like this right now?' "
said one studio insider.</TE>
<TE>   Even as books on the topic, such as Alice Sebold's "The Lovely
Bones," remain popular, and television dramas continue to embrace the
theme, the movie studio remains steadfast in its silent treatment,
declining to comment for this story, and lobbying principals involved
in "Trapped" to keep quiet.</TE>
<TE>   Columbia also restricted its ad spending to television and print,
forgoing other media such as outdoor and radio.</TE>
<TE>   Usually when a studio adopts such a strategy, it's a sure sign
that the movie is a dud.</TE>
<TE>   However, the response was not so dour from theater film buyers who
saw the film in an exhibitor screening Sept. 6. "It was an intense
thriller with a really great payoff. It was a quality film," said
Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations.</TE>
<TE>   The film is opening on 2,000-plus screens. Also coming out this
weekend are Warner Bros.' sci-fi action movie "Ballistic: Ecks vs.
Sever," which debuts on roughly 2,500 screens; Fox Searchlight's "The
Banger Sisters" on 2,700 screens; and Paramount Pictures/Miramax
Films' period drama "The Four Feathers," on 1,800.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope this doesn't set a precedent," said Peter Rainer, chairman
of the National Society of Film Critics. "If they start shutting down
the media entirely because of a sensitive subject matter, they will
presumably do it with other films. Usually the reason to keep the
media out is that the film doesn't live up to expectations. If the
name of the game is cutting your losses, you may feel that you have
less to lose keeping it from journalists than opening it up for
scrutiny."</TE>
<TE>   Exhibitors who saw the film were critical of the first 30 minutes,
calling it "very intense." One noted that, as a parent, it was
"disturbing" for him to watch.</TE>
<TE>   And therein lies the problem.</TE>
<TE>   When the initial trailer for "Trapped" appeared in mid-May, the
kidnapping theme was a central component. It had four clips of the
little girl and direct statements from the abductors such as "Your
daughter was kidnapped three hours ago," "You're never going to see
your kid again" and "I'm the one who decides whether she lives or
dies." It ended with Theron's character pointing a gun and saying,
"Give me back my daughter, you son-of-a ... "</TE>
<TE>   As the release date approached, though, television commercials for
"Trapped"--based on "24 Hours," the bestselling book by Greg
Iles--did not include scenes with the little girl. Menacing
statements from kidnappers were excised. The commercial now sells the
thriller aspect of the film and only implies an abduction, with
Theron screaming into the phone "bring her back" at the end of the
ad. A new TV ad for the film that broke this week includes mention of
a kidnapping but once again leaves out shots of the little girl.</TE>
<TE>   The print campaign for "Trapped" has no mention of an abduction.
Instead, ad copy reads: "It was the perfect crime until she refused
to be the perfect victim," referring to Theron's character.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really a parent-empowerment movie," said one person involved
in the production of the film. "The woman is the hero. It's like
'Ransom.' "</TE>
<TE>   In fact, early on in the "Trapped" campaign, Columbia's marketing
team was using a marketing strategy similar to that for "Ransom."</TE>
<TE>   "Ransom," which starred Mel Gibson and was directed by Ron Howard,
was one of the most high-profile films ever made about a child
kidnapping. The film, released in 1996, was able to rise above its
sensitive subject matter and gross an estimated $308.9 million
worldwide. Advertising for the picture featured Gibson turning the
tables on the kidnappers, refusing to pay the ransom for his son and
yelling into the phone, "Give me back my son."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike "Trapped," "Ransom" had an actor who was coming off of
several take-charge roles such as the "Lethal Weapon" franchise.
Theron previously starred in "The Cider House Rules" and "Sweet
November," among other movies.</TE>
<TE>   "We looked at it as an empowerment vehicle for the regular man,
but you can only do that with the right actors," said "Ransom"
producer Brian Grazer. "You are looking at a guy with a ton of power.
You can only do that with Mel or with one or two other people. I
wouldn't do that with 99.9% of the actors out there."</TE>
<TE>   But when "Ransom" opened, the news environment was very different.
The seemingly logical step to take would be to postpone "Trapped"
until the media maelstrom subsides.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't do that. One problem is that no one knows when this will
all die down, ... at least, that's what the studio is telling us,"
said one source who was involved in the production of the film.</TE>
<TE>   "It always gives you pause when a movie mirrors a real event,"
said Dergarabedian.</TE>
<TE>   Several studios faced that problem after Sept. 11. The same
studio, Columbia Pictures, debated whether to release the war drama
"Black Hawk Down." After meetings with filmmakers, the studio decided
to release the film as planned.</TE>
<TE>   Release dates for a number of other pictures, such as Arnold
Schwarzenegger's "Collateral Damage" and Disney's "Big Trouble," were
delayed until this year because of terrorist themes.</TE>
<TE>   In this instance, if Columbia shelved "Trapped," it would have to
shoulder interest costs on a $30-million production budget.
Postponing the film would also prolong the return on its investment
for German financing partner Senator Films, which has been under
pressure as a result of the shaky German economy.</TE>
<TE>   When Columbia originally scheduled the film for release, the
public was not being pummeled by regular news stories about child
abductions. Historically, the date proved to be the best time to
release to an older female audience, according to one person involved
in the film. A thriller such as "Trapped" usually pulls in an older
female audience, and according to tracking numbers "Trapped" is,
indeed, skewing toward that demographic.</TE>
<TE>   "Trapped" is now facing competition this weekend from two other
films angling for its key female demographic: "The Banger Sisters,"
starring Goldie Hawn and Susan Sarandon, and "The Four Feathers,"
with Heath Ledger and Kate Hudson.</TE>
<TE>   "If Columbia moved the date on 'Trapped,' they would have had to
deal with the press on why they moved the date," said one marketing
head at a competing studio. "They obviously don't want to do that."</TE>
<TE>   This is not the first time that real-life events have intruded on
the marketing of Hollywood films. After the beating of Rodney G. King
in 1991, Universal Pictures postponed the release of its film
"Looters" and changed its title, while the producers of the 20th
Century Fox release "Unlawful Entry" reedited a scene in which a
white police officer beat a black burglar with a baton.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy surrounding director Adrian Lyne's big-screen
adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's "Lolita" in 1997 worsened when the
film's debut overseas coincided with pedophilia scandals in France
and Belgium.</TE>
<TE>   "To begin with, there was no disguising the subject matter," said
Joel Michaels, one of the producers on the film. "Lolita" is about an
older man's sexual obsession with an adolescent girl. In addition to
the cases in Europe, recalled Michaels, "It was also not so long
after the JonBenet Ramsey case. It was not good for the movie. We
suffered the consequences. It added to the difficulty in getting the
film released in North America."</TE>
<TE>   Because of the sensitivity of the subject matter and in an
environment still rife with news reports on the Ramsey case, it was
hard to land a U.S. distributor.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the Columbine high school shootings in 1999. Immediately
after the tragedy, politicians began blaming Hollywood studios and
record companies for marketing violent movies and music to America's
youth; other high school shootings in the months that followed kept
the issue high in the public consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   One of the films affected by Columbine was Dimension Films'
"Killing Mrs. Tingle," a yarn about three high school students who
decide to kill their teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Miramax Films' Dimension reacted swiftly and changed the title to
"Teaching Mrs. Tingle."</TE>
<TE>   Whether audiences will embrace "Trapped" remains to be seen.
Pre-opening tracking numbers from research screenings are low.
"Columbia has a big problem," said one former marketing president.
"They know this is a losing situation. By minimizing the buys and
obscuring their message and then on top of it keeping the media away
from it, they are hoping to bypass any negative reviews and slip the
film in before anyone knows what hit them.</TE>
<TE>   "Sony has had such a big year, they don't need the controversy.
They don't need the money so they cut their losses. Regardless of
whether the picture is just a dog ... in the end, they'll win because
at least they'll have the perception of looking socially
responsible."</TE>

<HD>New Shows Arrive Ahead of the Writing</HD>
<DH>On WB's 'Do Over,' UPN's 'Twilight Zone' and Fox's 'Cedric
the Entertainer Presents' and 'Fastlane,' the script isn't the thing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOWARD ROSENBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Knocked cold in a freak accident, 34-year-old Joel Larson awakens to
find himself a high school freshman and fated to relive his past in
"Do Over," the WB's klutzy new Thursday night comedy following its
recently premiered remake of "Family Affair."</LD>
<LD>   Think "Back to the Future," "Peggy Sue Got Married" and ABC's
coming "That Was Then." To say nothing of "It's a Wonderful Life,"
whose George Bailey gets to review a lifetime of Bedford Falls
courtesy of an angel.</LD>
<LD>   "This is just great," Joel groans caustically about TV. "Every
show for the next 20 years is gonna be a repeat."</LD>
<TE>   Some of us know the feeling.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving tonight is "The Twilight Zone," UPN's inert reprise of
the Rod Serling-created/hosted classic that famously addressed a
"fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man." That sense of
exploration is absent from this new version.</TE>
<TE>   There's something familiar, too, about tonight's debut of two Fox
newcomers. One is the uneven variety/sketch comedy show "Cedric the
Entertainer Presents." The other, "Fastlane," revs up a brash new
environment, then fills it with a pair of pretty stock cop
characters.</TE>
<TE>   Staleness is not "Do Over's" greatest flaw. Lack of humor is.</TE>
<TE>   Having his second go at age 14, Joel (Penn Badgley) now gets a
shot at altering his own future and that of his dysfunctional family.
It's 1981, and what a difference two decades make. His parents are
not only youthful, but still married. His sister has yet to discover
substance abuse. And just like old times, the family dog is still on
the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Although you expect hyperbole in most sitcoms, it's a stretch even
for this one that Joel so easily would persuade his 1981 best friend
that he is really 34 and from the future. Imagine your response if
someone you've known for years tells you he's from another time and
is merely inhabiting the body he's in. Sure you'd buy it.</TE>
<TE>   As for nostalgia, meanwhile, only viewers under 20 themselves are
likely to find antique allure in a show set in the '80s. Especially
one notably starved for laughs.</TE>
<TE>   Joel: "Oh, my God, I'm stuck here." At least viewers can turn the
channel.</TE>
<TE>   If "Do Over" represents a failure of writing, doubly so for the
new "Twilight Zone" hosted (not very expertly) by Forest Whitaker.
Not that he or any other host could make much difference.
Scripts--many written by Serling--were the soul of the original
series that ran from 1959 to 1965 on CBS. And tonight's are thinner
even than those of an early remake from the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   The first of two stories has a family moving to a bucolic
residential compound where kids are required to dress and act alike,
and the truly insubordinate ones are Stepfordized. The plot is a
monotone. The payoff you wait for never arrives, nor does suspense.
The second story stars Jason Alexander as the Grim Reaper, a
self-loathing character who spews dark wisecracks and apologizes to
cadavers for being the instrument of death.</TE>
<TE>   "I kill flowers, too," he adds. Whatever. Talk about something
having no pulse. This story is death.</TE>
<TE>   Much livelier is Cedric the Entertainer's half-hour of mostly
sketches. It combines old-style variety with waz-up lite brought to
you by some of the people behind the oft-inspired "In Living Color,"
the lesser "Martin" and a taste that can take years to acquire, "Def
Comedy Jam."</TE>
<TE>   Fox has shrewdly conjoined Cedric with "The Bernie Mac Show," its
world-class comedy starring his colleague from the "Original Kings of
Comedy."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Bernie Mac lead-in will help, consistent writing
would be more beneficial to Cedric and his supporting company of
Wendy Raquel Robinson, Shaun Majumder, Amy Brassette and JB Smoove.</TE>
<TE>   Just a hoot is the opening sketch depicting a TV program applying
rudimentary Spanish ("Que Hora Es?") to intense drama. And amusing in
spots is "Love Doctor," with Cedric as a satin-robed marriage
counselor sounding like Barry White while crooning advice.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, aaarrrgggghhh! That includes some of Cedric's recurring
characters. The effort is here, but the material ranges mostly from
sophomoric to flat-out bad.</TE>
<TE>   "Fastlane" speeds through its first hour, meanwhile, rarely making
a pit stop for plot. Its young target audience may not care,
especially with those good-looking bodies at hand.</TE>
<TE>   Male protagonists are Van Ray (Peter Facinelli) and Deaqon Hayes
(Bill Bellamy), rubber-screeching, tough-talking undercover cops who
are partnered in an elite crime-fighting unit despite not getting
along. Will they find a way to settle their differences? If you have
to ask, it's past your bedtime.</TE>
<TE>   The setting is L.A., the boss Billie Chambers (Tiffani Thiessen),
a nasty "La Femme Nikita" type who grants Van and Deaq access to a
storehouse full of fast-lane goodies called the Candy Store.</TE>
<TE>   The premiere zooms but is badly acted and badly written. Van has
no charisma, and Deaq, an African American, for some reason is not
allowed to speak a grammatical sentence. Maybe it's just his
undercover act. Or maybe "Fastlane" is a fifth dimension beyond that
which is known to man.</TE>
<TE>   "Do Over" will air Thursday nights at 8:30 on the WB. The network
has rated it TV-PG-DL (may be unsuitable for young children due to
coarse and suggestive dialogue).</TE>
<TE>   "Twilight Zone" will air Wednesday nights at 9 on UPN. The network
has rated it TV-PG-L (may be unsuitable for young children due to
coarse dialogue).</TE>
<TE>   "Cedric the Entertainer Presents" will air Wednesday nights at
8:30 on Fox. The network has rated it TV-PG-L (may be unsuitable for
young children due to coarse dialogue).</TE>
<TE>   "Fastlane" will air Wednesday nights at 9 on Fox. The network has
rated it TV-14-LDSV (may be unsuitable for children under the age of
14 due to coarse language, suggestive dialogue, sex and violence).</TE>

<LD>When director Oliver Hirschbiegel met with Disney executives a few
months ago to discuss possible projects, he says, "I told them I
really want to do a kids' movie. They didn't believe me. They thought
I was joking." It's easy to understand why studio execs had trouble
picturing the German filmmaker as a PG-13 kind of guy. Hirschbiegel,
after all, is responsible for "Das Experiment," a disturbing look at
human nature that may well qualify as the feel-bad movie of the
season.</LD>
<LD>   The premise of "Das Experiment": University professors recruit 20
ordinary citizens to assume the roles of "guards" and "prisoners" for
a two-week psychology experiment.</LD>
<LD>   Almost immediately, the guards begin humiliating the prisoners.
Torture and murder ensue. Based on Mario Giordano's novel "Black
Box," "Das Experiment" originally included the statement that it was
"inspired by" the 1971 Stanford Prison Experiment conducted by
psychology professor Philip Zimbardo, who declined to comment for
this story but criticized the movie in a professional journal.</LD>
<TE>   The reference has been removed from the film's credits.</TE>
<TE>   "Das Experiment" star Moritz Bleibtreu ("Run Lola Run") recently
joined Hirschbiegel in a Studio City deli to talk about reaction to
their film in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "The way people would ask questions after they saw the picture,"
Bleibtreu says, "it felt like they were saying, 'Why are you showing
me this? I don't want to know that I could possibly be like that.'
They were shocked because it forces you to think about what you would
do in that situation. People really seemed to personalize it."</TE>
<TE>   Audience members fainted at one screening; others walked out.
"That's not what we wanted," Hirschbiegel says. "We did not want
people to faint. We don't want people to have nightmares after
watching it."</TE>
<TE>   Yet it's not surprising that "Das Experiment" has provoked extreme
responses. Shot in a straightforward documentary style, the movie
depicts characters being gagged, raped, urinated on, stripped naked
and solitarily confined inside a vault-sized black box, stabbed,
sprayed with fire extinguishers, clubbed and forced to wear "Sissy"
signs.</TE>
<TE>   "The book was very intense," says Hirschbiegel, a German
television director who read "Black Box" in one sitting and decided
to adapt the novel for his feature film debut. "It had believable
characters and the whole situation was like a Shakespearean play in a
way, if you look at these characters at the beginning and how their
positions shift."</TE>
<TE>   The most chilling power shift is embodied by Berus (Justus von
Dohnanyi). At the start of the experiment, he's a quiet, middle-class
family man assigned the role of guard. By Day 5, he's become an
out-of-control sadist.</TE>
<TE>   Bleibtreu, who played prisoner No. 77 in the film, found Berus'
transformation plausible: "If you take somebody like Berus, who maybe
is a good father and has a good job but who never had power in his
life, and then you suddenly give him power, something he's never had
before, of course he might misuse it. That can be a very tempting
situation."</TE>
<TE>   The sight of blond, square-jawed Berus abusing barely dressed
captives and barking orders in German raises the question among some
viewers: Did Hirschbiegel intend "Das Experiment" as a metaphor for
Germany's World War II concentration camp mentality?</TE>
<TE>   "No one believes me," the filmmaker replies, "but it never ever
occurred to me that Justus might look like a Nazi. That's
coincidental. Doing this as a German movie, of course, I was always
aware of that and I did read books about behavior of the guards in
the concentration camps, because I never understood how your loving
family father would do these horrible things. But I didn't think of
'Das Experiment' as a study of fascism. I think it's a universal
thing."</TE>
<TE>   Hirschbiegel's research encompassed material on American prisons,
British concentration camps during the Boer War and Yale psychologist
Stanley Milgram's electric shock "obedience" experiments in the
1960s. He says it all led to a disheartening conclusion: People in
positions of authority tend to abuse power in remarkably similar
ways, regardless of national boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   "The techniques of manipulating and controlling people and keeping
them down seems to be the same all over the world," he says. "It must
be something that just comes from the human mind, because it's not
like the people who do these things all got together to exchange this
information."</TE>
<TE>   Most of "Das Experiment" was filmed during five weeks in the
cellar of a Cologne cable factory. Cast members bonded on the mock
prison set according to their roles in the film.</TE>
<TE>   "Within two days you had the actors who were playing prisoners in
one group," Hirschbiegel says, "and the actors playing the guards in
another. During the catering breaks, they'd sit by themselves, away
from the other group. We were down there 14, 15 hours a day, without
any daylight, and we were shooting in sequence, so it caused the
fiction and reality to melt together. The more intense the scenes got
that we were shooting, the more tense the real-life situation. It was
hard to escape that energy."</TE>
<TE>   Two-thirds of the way through the shoot, Bleibtreu wanted out. "It
got to a point," he says, "eight or nine days before we finished,
where I just did not want to scream at anybody, or get screamed at,
or beat anybody, or get beaten up. 'Let me do a comedy scene or
something!' Because no matter how much you try to laugh at the
situation and keep it away, it just gets to you, physically and
psychologically. Every day, I'd go to the set, put the [gown] on, go
to prison, go to my cell, then at night, go home exhausted, have a
drink and go to sleep."</TE>
<TE>   Hirschbiegel admits that during the production his role as
director began to remind him of the psychology professor in "Das
Experiment" who tries to manipulate his subjects' behavior from afar.
"In any film, the director is kind of a mad professor, looking down
on the action," he says. "But it was unsettling to sit there at the
monitor and watch the actors carrying out my orders. I realized how
easy it would be to see them as guinea pigs in a cage and for me to
say, 'A little more, a little bit more.' "</TE>
<TE>   Bleibtreu says of the director, "Oliver was smart enough to pick
up on this tension on the set and to use that, but never to the point
where we'd exploit any kind of bad feelings between the actors. If
we'd done this, we wouldn't have been any better than the people in
the actual film."</TE>
<TE>   Citing David Fincher's "Fight Club" (1999) as a model,
Hirschbiegel says he was careful to avoid "commenting" on his
characters' ethical judgment. He was more interested in showing how
social dynamics and peer pressure shape moral boundaries. "The
wonderful and the terrible thing about human beings is, we are very
flexible. In a bad sense, that means if we step over a line, we will
never step back. We look for the next line to step over. It takes a
lot of strength and moral integrity to step aside and ask yourself,
'What am I doing?' "</TE>
<TE>   And if no one questions the behavior?</TE>
<TE>   Bleibtreu cites a scene in "Das Experiment" in which the guards
abuse their prisoners for the first time. "After the guards did their
stuff with the fire extinguishers, it's almost like they were waiting
for a response from the professors. One guy said, 'Don't you think
that was too tough?' and another one says, 'They didn't say anything;
if they didn't say anything, it must be fine.' Almost like 'OK, good!
I don't have to think for myself anymore.' But it's going to come
back to you."</TE>
<TE>   "If there's a message people could take from this film,"
Hirschbiegel adds, "it's that no matter what, it is you who are
responsible for what you do. No institution, and no person, can take
that away."</TE>

<HD>In the Center Ring</HD>
<DH>Pop Music* Not long ago, Circo was virtually unknown. Now
the pop-rockers from Puerto Rico have two Latin Grammy nominations
and a flock of new fans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERNESTO LECHNER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last year, the Puerto Rican band Circo flew to Los Angeles for a
monthlong series of shows at various clubs. Though the pop-rock
quintet stirred some word of mouth in rock en espanol circles, Circo
remained an obscure band, overshadowed by such major acts as
Fabulosos Cadillacs, Orishas and El Gran Silencio.</LD>
<LD>   But when this year's Latin Grammy nominations were announced in
July, Circo received two nods--for best rock album by a duo or group
with vocal and, more prestigious, best new artist. The winners will
be named in tonight's nationally televised ceremony from the Kodak
Theatre in Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   Suddenly, Circo is not obscure.</LD>
<TE>   On Monday, hundreds of fans, industry insiders and media
representatives crowded the Knitting Factory Hollywood, where Circo
was performing as part of a showcase organized by performing arts
organization BMI that also included Latin rock acts Bayu and Kinky.</TE>
<TE>   The club was packed. Photographers and television crews were
everywhere. In the middle of the club's bar, Circo's publicist
Veronica Gonzalez surveyed the scene with disbelief.</TE>
<TE>   "When the guys were doing their monthlong residency, it was really
hard getting people to see them," she recalled of last year's visit
to Los Angeles. "At one point I even said to myself, 'Am I doing
something wrong here?' People just weren't giving them a chance.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, sometimes you need the acceptance of a major
organization like [the Latin recording academy] for people to pay
attention and admit that this is a good band."</TE>
<TE>   Circo's lead singer is also surprised by the abrupt change in his
band's hipness quotient. But he is determined to take this case of
Grammy hysteria with a grain of salt.</TE>
<TE>   "We see this as a great opportunity," said Jose Luis "Fofe" Abreu.
"It is rare for a group like ours to get so much media attention. I
guess the message is that there's a Latin alternative scene out there
that is worth getting to know. It deserves industry attention and is
able to sell records."</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, Circo's performance showed the vision and musical
chops to merit a couple of Grammys.</TE>
<TE>   Like most rock en espanol songwriters of his generation, Abreu,
31, is obsessed with the sounds of '80s British new wave and goth
rock. Ask him to name a few favorites and he'll mention the Cure, the
Smiths, Peter Murphy and Dead Can Dance.</TE>
<TE>   These influences were evident throughout Monday's performance.
There was a shimmering beauty to "Sufro," a pretty pop tune with a
melancholy keyboard line and restless drumbeat that sounded like an
unreleased Spandau Ballet single.</TE>
<TE>   The chorus of "Libelula," on the other hand, echoed Argentina's
Soda Stereo, the first band to successfully transpose the '80s
aesthetic to Latin territory.</TE>
<TE>   The evening's only faux pas was a disastrous version of the
classic bolero "Historia de un Amor," butchered through the use of
electronic beats, distorted vocals and postmodern irreverence.</TE>
<TE>   Circo's strongest asset is Abreu's voice--equal parts London fog
and Puerto Rican spice. Abreu could fit in with salsa outfit El Gran
Combo (he boasts the vocal strength and flamboyance of a sonero), but
he tailors his singing to the more subtle genre of infectious
pop-rock.</TE>
<TE>   His stage persona--part asexual clown, part hyper circus
ringmaster--added humor and drama. (The band's name is Spanish for
"circus.") Clutching the colorful megaphone depicted on the cover of
the group's debut album, "No Todo Lo Que Es Pop Es Bueno" (Not
Everything That's Pop Is Good), he cheered for Puerto Rico,
celebrated Mexican independence and guaranteed the crowd that no one
leaves a Circo gig alone.</TE>
<TE>   To those who don't follow Latin music closely, this might seem
surprising coming from an island famous for tight, flavorful tropical
music. But Puerto Rico has also had a burgeoning rock scene for more
than a decade, and the charts there have recently been dominated by
hip-hop and native rappers such as Vico C.</TE>
<TE>   Before Monday's show, Abreu talked about the excitement awaiting
the band--attending the Latin Grammy ceremony and perhaps walking
away with an award or two.</TE>
<TE>   "We are fully prepared to enjoy the whole Latin music industry
circus--with a lot of ingenuity and a dash of sarcasm," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is really unbelievable to us, knowing that we'll be walking
down the same red carpet as Los Bukis or Vicente Fernandez. The
gossip magazines might ask us about our clothes. Mine are vintage.
Maybe we'll even make it to the list of the evening's best-dressed
celebrities."</TE>
<TE>   Abreu points at his mismatched outfit, which includes a green tie
and spiked belt, and adds: "Or the worst ones."</TE>
<TE>   The Latin Grammy Awards air tonight from 9 to 11 p.m. on CBS.</TE>

<HD>All That Viewers Ask for Is a Little Closure</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Would you start watching a movie if someone said they couldn't
promise you'd get to see the last 10 minutes? Read a book that might
not have a final chapter? Buy a CD that ends in the middle of your
favorite song?</LD>
<LD>   If that sounds crazy, consider what the networks will do as the
new TV season (insert sound of trumpets blaring) officially begins
next week. Executives will ask people to commit to shows, embrace
them, make an appointment to watch them.</LD>
<LD>   Then they will abruptly cancel said shows, with no sense of
resolution or closure for those viewers who bond with them. To some,
the feeling is akin to having the show plucked away in the middle of
the story, whether it was "Prey" in 1998, "Brimstone" in 1999, "Now
and Again" in 2000, or Fox's "Dark Angel" and ABC's "Once and Again"
a few months ago.</LD>
<TE>   This upsets people. In fact, it causes die-hard fans to go a
little nuts, based on the "Save our show" campaigns that percolate on
the Internet--especially those involving series with a
science-fiction component. (Attend a "Star Trek" convention, you'll
figure it out.)</TE>
<TE>   People devote considerable time to these efforts, raising money to
place ads in the trade papers and doing quirky things like inundating
networks with artifacts from the show, from bottles of Tabasco sauce
on "Roswell" to plastic eggs--a hallmark of one of the villains--on
behalf of "Now and Again."</TE>
<TE>   OK, so some of these folks need to get a life. Yet just because
they care about a TV show more than might be healthy doesn't
necessarily mean they're wrong. Moreover, the fact that they will
spend money on their cause suggests there is an untapped market out
there that has yet to be addressed.</TE>
<TE>   Despite all the technological innovations of recent years--from
video on demand to DVD players to personal video recorders like
TiVo--no one has figured out how to cash in on the passion that
exists for canceled TV shows. A core group is clearly willing to pay
to see these series reach a conclusion, only to have the product
yanked from the shelves.</TE>
<TE>   Most producers would welcome the chance to tie up the loose ends.
In fact, "Now and Again" creator Glenn Gordon Caron said he still has
"nutty ideas" about doing a graphic novel or movie or something to
wrap up the show, whose stars, Eric Close and Dennis Haysbert, have
moved on to roles in the CBS drama "Without a Trace" and Fox's "24,"
respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Caron said he never intended to leave fans hanging with the
first-season finale, produced with "a cockeyed optimism that the show
would be back."</TE>
<TE>   "I was stunned with how rabid the fans were," he added, citing the
difference between the snail mail that dribbled in when he produced
"Moonlighting" and the way Internet chat boards light up today as
soon as the credits roll.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, drawing conclusions from the few thousand souls
conversing in chat rooms can be misleading in a business in which a
program regularly consumed by millions of people is still deemed a
failure.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the series that usually inspire such obsessive
behavior when canceled are becoming somewhat endangered by recent
viewing patterns, where the trend has been toward shows that offer
self-contained episodes, like "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" and
"Law &amp; Order." Not only are these programs hits, but they also repeat
better than serialized programs like "ER" during the summer and in
syndication--a major economic consideration.</TE>
<TE>   As an example, take Fox's "24," which barely performed well enough
to earn a second season. Because of its heavily serialized nature,
Fox opted not to repeat the episodes this summer, instead running a
Labor Day marathon on its FX cable network and releasing the first
season on DVD.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the issue of repeatability, network executives worry that
serials deter some potential viewers--scaring off those who are busy,
affluent and don't want to feel as if they have to dutifully catch
every episode to keep up.</TE>
<TE>   "People are so time-stressed," said Alan Wurtzel, president of NBC
standards and research. "This environment simply magnifies some of
these hurdles, which in the past might not have been all that
significant."</TE>
<TE>   What the Internet campaigns demonstrate is the powerful ardor that
can be generated among those who are willing to make a
commitment--people who not only plan leisure time around shows but
also form online communities to pine for them. The question is, will
they do so as readily if networks continually disappoint them?</TE>
<TE>   Margaret Williams, who works at the University of South Dakota in
Vermillion, S.D., does not sound like a crank, and she is 41 years
old, meaning advertisers still acknowledge her existence.</TE>
<TE>   She is, however, a big fan of "Dark Angel." And she is still angry
that Fox canceled it in May without any payoff--perceiving the
network as being unresponsive to its audience. Williams maintains she
hasn't watched Fox since.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not a bunch of dumb sheep out here that will watch
anything," she said. "I want to let the networks know we're not going
to watch substandard shows.... I don't want to watch people eating
worms. We want quality."</TE>
<TE>   Network officials try to be sympathetic, but they operate a
business in which the percentages say cut your loss on low-rated
programs and try again. Even producers, while flattered to see their
babies showered with adoration, aren't always sure what such
campaigns accomplish.</TE>
<TE>   "You get sort of cynical, and you want to say to people, 'Please
don't waste your energy,' " Caron noted.</TE>
<TE>   It's easy not to sympathize or identify with people who become so
enthralled by a television show, but they're out there, maybe living
next to you. And while the networks can dismiss them as lunatics,
they doubtless speak for others who don't complain as loudly but
would probably like reassurance there will be a final chapter before
they open a book or commit to a TV show.</TE>
<TE>   So are networks hurting themselves in the long run by letting
loyal customers, people who sat through a season's worth of
commercials, end the experience with a bad taste in their mouths?
Because until technology solves this dilemma, just thinking about it
as a consumer, does wanting to know how the story ends really sound
like too much to ask?</TE>

<HD>The Three Faces of a Baseball Legend</HD>
<DH>Lee Blessing's introspective drama uses multiple actors to
explore Ty Cobb's drive to excel as well as the workings of the
athlete's twisted psyche.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEAN MITCHELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What is the final measure of a man who achieves greatness in his
chosen profession but sacrifices his humanity to do so? It's an
age-old question that playwright Lee Blessing asks anew in "Cobb," a
dramatic perusal of the legendary baseball player Ty Cobb, at the
Falcon Theatre in Burbank.</LD>
<LD>   Essentially a one-man show performed by four actors, "Cobb"
predates Ron Shelton's 1994 movie of the same title that starred
Tommy Lee Jones, and has been staged around the country for more than
a decade. This Los Angeles premiere, backed by Kevin Spacey, played
off-Broadway two years ago. It's stuffed with baseball lore and
Blessing's unmistakable intelligence, but might be hard to recommend
to anyone who doesn't care to learn why Cobb used his unorthodox
batting grip or why he hated Babe Ruth (whose crowd-pleasing home
runs changed forever the scrappy baserunning game at which Cobb
excelled.)</LD>
<LD>   "Cobb" aims higher than that, attempting to map the twisted psyche
of a man who at age 18 saw his mother shoot his father to death.
Except for recalling that famous detail, Blessing does not set out to
redeem Cobb or alter the dominant view of him as a mean-spirited
bully and dreaded competitor. But he is also interested in how Cobb
must have viewed himself, and this is the news that "Cobb" has to
offer, even if it must remain largely speculation.</LD>
<TE>   Beginning with a glimpse of Cobb as an addled cancer patient near
the end of the war that was his life (he died at age 75 in 1961),
"Cobb" works backward through the great ballplayer's own combative
introspection to reconstruct his spectacular career while vividly
illustrating his psychotic personality. It's a little odd watching a
man haunted by questions even while he is reminding us that his
success on the diamond stemmed from an iron-willed self-confidence
and atavistic singleness of purpose.</TE>
<TE>   But that is the blueprint for the play, and Blessing (who wrote
another, more ambitious baseball play, "The Oldtimers Game," in the
early '80s) is a good enough dramatist to make us suspend logic for
the better part of the evening.</TE>
<TE>   Directed by Joe Brancato, the action unfolds rapidly on a simple
multi-platform set, with Cobb's varied incarnations separated from
one another on different levels, and the occasional visual aid of old
baseball photographs illuminated from behind. The actors nimbly toss
bats back and forth and reproduce Cobb's menacing left-handed swing
with a convincing athleticism--particularly Matthew Mabe portraying
the young Cobb.</TE>
<TE>   Mabe, in Detroit Tiger pinstripes, short-billed cap and
turn-of-the-century high collar, is too handsome to be Cobb but
otherwise does a marvelous job embodying his ferocity, Southern twang
(Cobb was from rural Georgia) and, yes, love for the game, which
seems to have been the only real love of Cobb's lonely life. At one
point he leads the ensemble in a wonderfully staged re-creation of a
"trip around the bases," demonstrating Cobb's speed, cunning and
intimidation and why he chose to be a singles hitter rather than a
home-run slugger like his nemesis Ruth, whom he derides as looking
like "an egg on stilts."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Cullen plays Cobb as the unshaven old coot, shuffling
around his cancer ward in a robe, his face puckered in bile as he
croaks insults to all while awaiting the end. Michael Sabatino, as
the middle-aged Ty, a self-made millionaire in a three-piece suit, is
the odd man out, altogether too bland and smooth and un-Southern to
have us believe he is related to the other two.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing any number of Negro League uniforms, Richard Brooks, the
only casting change since New York, portrays the ghost of Oscar
Charleston, a fabulous black ballplayer who serves as a reminder that
his formidable skills went unacknowledged in pre-Jackie Robinson
America except to earn the dubious honor of being called "the black
Ty Cobb." It's a nice touch to imagine Cobb, who was a bigot, facing
death while hectored by the thought that "the black Cobb" might have
been the better player. But it's hard to believe it happened.</TE>
<TE>   As with any psychological profile that seeks to penetrate the mind
of a historical figure, "Cobb's" achievements are limited by a
writer's fantasy. We know what Cobb did; we can never know what was
inside the crawl space of his head. Still, "Cobb" is a worthy effort
to find out, and considering the skin-deep idolatry that passes for
history in so much written about baseball, it's a play more real and
memorable than anything you're likely to see on the ESPN Classic
channel.</TE>

<LD>   'Sesame' Introduces HIV-Positive Character</LD>
<LD>   The newest member of the "Sesame Street" family, an HIV-positive
Muppet named Kami, was unveiled Tuesday at a news conference in Cape
Town, South Africa. She'll join the cast of the South Africa version
of the educational series, "Takalani Sesame," on Sept. 30.</LD>
<TE>   "It is our hope that the series will help South African children
acquire the life skills necessary to overcome prejudice associated
with those with HIV/AIDS," said Gary E. Knell, president of Sesame
Workshop, the TV show's parent company.</TE>
<TE>   Workshop officials underscored Kami's importance by citing
research showing that one in nine South Africans is living with the
disease and that by the year 2015, 15% of all South African children
under 15 are expected to be orphaned.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement that "Sesame Street" would be adding an
HIV-positive character drew protests from some U.S. congressmen
earlier this year, but the flap died down after workshop executives
stressed that she would only be on the South African edition.</TE>

<TE>   Four Networks to Share Emmys' Special Award</TE>
<TE>   The four major broadcast networks will share the Governors Award
at the prime-time Emmys Sunday, awarded by the Academy of Television
Arts &amp; Sciences in recognition of last year's jointly televised
telethon, "America: A Tribute to Heroes."</TE>
<TE>   In announcing the award Tuesday, the academy said it was impressed
by the camaraderie that ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC showed "in coming
together to underwrite, support and enable the production" of the
celebrity-packed Sept. 21 telecast, which ultimately was carried live
on 35 U.S. broadcast and cable TV networks and on 8,000 radio
stations. The telethon was subsequently credited with raising $250
million for victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "That telecast helped bring our nation together and showed the
world that we were united and still standing strong during a time of
utmost tragedy," said academy chief Bryce Zabel.</TE>

<TE>   'Everwood' Attracts Modest Audience</TE>
<TE>   "Everwood," a drama about a widower relocating from New York to
Colorado, drew decent ratings in its premiere on the WB on Monday
night, attracting about 7.4 million viewers.</TE>
<TE>   That represented a drop of only about 19% from its lead-in, "7th
Heaven," which registered its best season premiere ever with 9.1
million viewers.</TE>

<TE>   Cincinnati Orchestra Reaches Accord</TE>
<TE>   The Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra and its musicians have agreed to
a new two-year contract. Retroactive to Sept. 2 and running through
Sept. 5, 2004, it will increase the orchestra's costs by an annual
average of 2.4%.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new deal, a musician's minimum weekly salary stays at
$1,675 in the first year. Each musician will receive a one-time
payment of $1,000 in March 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The minimum weekly scale will increase $25 per week in the first
half of the 2003-04 year, and then go up another $25 in the second
half.</TE>

<TE>   Calgary Philharmonic Seeks Pay Cuts</TE>
<TE>   Facing a deficit of $1.1 million, the Calgary Philharmonic
Orchestra has asked its musicians to take pay cuts, has frozen
administrative salaries and today is launching a desperation
advertising campaign to lure new subscribers, Canada's National Post
reports.</TE>
<TE>   Says one print ad: "This may be our last season."</TE>
<TE>   Philharmonic executives told the paper that the orchestra could go
under if it does not receive 2,000 new subscriptions by the end of
next month.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no [government] bailouts unless we can demonstrate that
we can develop something that is stable and sustainable," said Larry
Fichtner, the Calgary Philharmonic chairman.</TE>

<TE>   15 Folk, Traditional Artists to Be Honored</TE>
<TE>   The National Endowment for the Arts will present its 2002 National
Heritage Fellowship Awards to 15 folk and traditional artists in
ceremonies in Washington today. Each of them will receive $10,000.</TE>
<TE>   The only Californian being honored is Tolowa tradition bearer
Loren Bommelyn of Crescent City. Other recipients, all from the U.S.,
include several fiddlers, an Appalachian songwriter, a Sephardic
musician, several basket-makers, an accordionist and a Tibetan sand
mandala painter.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The subway and light-rail stations in Los Angeles seem as if they'd
be ideal settings for art. Every day, thousands of people from all
walks of life mill around on the system's well-lighted platforms
waiting for trains. No advertisements or scaled-down billboards
clutter these spaces.</LD>
<LD>   Likewise, no newsstands, kiosks, vending machines or
mini-convenience stores compete for your attention. Eating and
drinking are forbidden, as is music (unless it's played on
headphones). Odd as it may seem, the tunnels and walkways of L.A.'s
skeletal transit system share many of the physical features of art
museums from 20 years ago--before they transformed themselves into
multipurpose entertainment centers by adding fine restaurants,
boutique gift shops, designer architecture and loads of supposedly
educational programming.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, the five most recent installations commissioned by
the Metropolitan Transportation Authority appear to have been
designed for such trendy institutions. Today, too many museums behave
as if art is elitist, incomprehensible and inaccessible--and that the
public is best served by being treated to an amusing variety of
undemanding diversions and vaguely cultural experiences.</LD>
<TE>   At the 7th Street/Metro Center station in downtown L.A., where the
Red and Blue lines meet, a dozen or so TV monitors have been affixed
to pillars and walls high overhead. Each presents George Legrady's
"Chance Encounters," a literally endless video made up of 20-second
segments.</TE>
<TE>   Each segment consists of the first names of two people, randomly
paired by a computer program and set against a sequence of 26
animated backdrops. For example, Karl and Hannah are followed by
Kathy and Gloria, Keisha and Christine and so on.</TE>
<TE>   The idea is that the subway brings a potentially infinite variety
of folks into close proximity for the lengths of their trips, and
that they go their separate ways without getting to know one another.
That's true, but it's also trite. Like a screen-saver for the
imagination, Legrady's tedious piece adds nothing beyond the obvious
to a trip across town. He is scheduled to revise what's on the screen
monthly; maybe his next contribution will be better.</TE>
<TE>   At the same station is a permanently installed series of squat
concrete benches decorated with abstract patterns. Theatrical
spotlights shine from the ceiling, casting shadows of stylized leaves
on the uncomfortable seats and the ground around them. The shadows
are faint, and there's a good chance you could use the benches
without even noticing the patterns. They're most visible when you
open a newspaper or paperback, whose pages catch the spectrum of
faded colors at the edges of the shadowy pattern.</TE>
<TE>   Titled "Plantings," this installation pays homage to Ernest A.
Batchelder's Arts and Crafts tile work in the building located
directly above ground. The underground piece of static theater is the
result of a collaboration among Noel Korten, director of exhibitions
of the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery; Kipp Kobayashi, a corporate
designer; and architect Marta Perlas. The number of
collaborators--and the paltriness of their product--reflects the
top-heavy, over-administrated nature of publicly funded art projects:
More time, effort and money appear to have gone into committee
meetings and approval processes than the work itself.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhat more successful are the five concrete benches decorated
with ceramic-tile fragments at the Imperial/Wilmington/Rosa Parks
station, halfway between Long Beach and downtown, where the Blue and
Green lines meet. Designed by artists Michael Massenburg and Robin
Strayhorn, each of the indestructible, S-shaped benches commemorates
an important year in the life of Rosa Parks. Permanently installed
beneath a vast concrete overpass, they combine photographic transfers
depicting historic events with a quilt-like patchwork of bright
colors.</TE>
<TE>   The artists, as a symbolic token of their public commitment,
invited members of the South-Central Senior Citizens Center to
participate in design decisions. The results are bland and banal, but
that's part of the point. Massenburg and Strayhorn are less
interested in making art that forges communities than tapping into
existing communities to make art. That sort of backward thinking is
yet another hallmark of current public art. It betrays a deeply
cynical view of what art can actually do. The best thing about the
benches is that they provide some sorely needed seating.</TE>
<TE>   The most visually satisfying and intellectually stimulating
installation is Robbert Flick's series of seven illuminated photo
panels, installed until July 2003 at the Wilshire/Normandie station.
Each 4-by-3-foot light box contains a grid of 121 snapshots the
photographer made on July 10, 1997, when he drove along Wilshire
Boulevard following the route of the subway from downtown toward the
station. He aimed his camera at the north side of the street.</TE>
<TE>   Time and space collapse and expand as you scan Flick's
photographs. Their fractured cinematic expansiveness draws viewers
into the picture. Their collaged components capture the dynamic
rhythm of urban life.</TE>
<TE>   An overall view of this slice of Los Angeles comes into focus
slowly. Distant objects appear in several frames of film. Those
up-close flash by more quickly. In one sequence, an MTA bus appears
to be nearly as long as a city block. It looks that way because it
was traveling alongside Flick's car, at approximately the same speed,
as he snapped frame after frame. The longer you look, the more you
see.</TE>
<TE>   The piece, however, has been installed so high on the wall that
it's difficult to savor its details. It's also located just inside
the station entrance, a spot that travelers rush by. A better
location would be on the platform, where people have more time to
contemplate Flick's fascinating portrait of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Artists Cindy Bernard and Joseph Hammer have glued red, green and
blue theatrical gels to the windows of car #127, to which they've
also added an audio component. But the work isn't reviewed here
because, despite the best efforts of the MTA's media relations
department, the car could not be located last Wednesday as it made
its two-hour round trip between Los Angeles and Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   In nearly every instance, the scale of the transit system dwarfs
the art. The works come off as afterthoughts, decorative flourishes
that are meant to add a bit of whimsy and individualism to an
otherwise rational operation. Such thinking sells art short. When art
is interesting, it embodies a lot more than idiosyncrasy.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest problem with this project is that it is based on the
idea that art at subway stops is public and that art in museums
isn't. That's simply wrong. Art is public not because it's located in
public places, but because of what it does: galvanize peoples'
opinions and ideals. Until administrators figure this out, our urban
landscape will continue to be littered with lifeless works whose
claim on public attention is disingenuous.</TE>

<LD>It's early in the morning, but 17-year-old Anner Alfaro rides the bus
to Venice High School with a broad smile. As he explains to the
camera, a rich array of experiences awaits him.</LD>
<LD>   "You go to class to trip out," he says. "To sleep ... to try to
bring your high down ... to get caught up with your girlfriend ... to
listen to your Walkman."</LD>
<LD>   "Basically, you go to class to do everything but learn," he
concludes cheerfully.</LD>
<TE>   Which helps explain why although the teenager, who goes by his
street nickname "Creek," should be enjoying campus life as a
soon-to-graduate senior, his school credits brand him a mid-term
sophomore, and a failing one at that.</TE>
<TE>   In "A.K.A. Creek: Educating a Big City Schoolboy" (tonight at 10
on KCET), Alfaro serves as the star of his own horror story. And when
he's later given a video camera to record his thoughts and
activities, he becomes its director and producer as well.</TE>
<TE>   But the documentary's larger purpose is to take America's
sprawling urban educational systems to task for allegedly
institutionalizing mediocrity while ignoring innovations that might
save them, most prominently voucher programs that would bring school
choice.</TE>
<TE>   Although early on he appears to be beyond the help of any learning
system, Alfaro is gradually revealed to be a young man of unsparing
insight, uncommon intelligence and aching sensitivity, which make his
plight all the more heartbreaking.</TE>
<TE>   The eldest of four children in a household fronted by a widowed
mother who became pregnant with him at 14, you can hear Alfaro's
street-tough patois fall away as he sternly lectures his siblings
about their own life paths.</TE>
<TE>   And then you wonder what might have been, and what the future
might hold for a boy called Creek.</TE>

<LD>"Monday Night Football" gave ABC a jump on the television season that
officially begins next week, combining with telecasts of the movies
"Notting Hill" and "Liar, Liar" to help the network score a rare
second-place weekly finish, based on viewing estimates issued Tuesday
by Nielsen Media Research. ABC is seeking momentum as it heads into
the season, having languished in the ratings throughout much of the
summer.</LD>
<LD>   The network--which ranked first last week among adults 18 to 49,
the primary demographic monitored by advertisers--also took advantage
of reruns on competitors to launch "The Drew Carey Show" and "Whose
Line Is It Anyway?" in its new Monday time slots.</LD>
<LD>   Led by multiple episodes of "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" and
"Everybody Loves Raymond," CBS topped the standings in overall
viewing for the 10th time in the last 13 weeks, since the NBA
playoffs concluded on NBC. The network also recorded the highest
ratings on Sept. 11 with a rerun of its documentary "9/11."</LD>
<TE>   The CBS unscripted series "Big Brother" also was a highlight,
managing to post its highest Thursday rating of the summer.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fans of everything automotive should find heaven in Southern
California this weekend with two of the year's most significant car
events.</LD>
<LD>   The Route 66 Rendezvous in San Bernardino, Thursday through
Sunday, pays homage to the cars of the 1950s, '60s and '70s and to
the road that so many of them traversed. Over on the coast Sunday,
the Palos Verdes Concours d'Elegance will feature almost 200 of the
finest classic autos in the nation, with a special salute to racing
and competition cars.</LD>
<LD>   The Route 66 bash enters its 13th year with a worldwide reputation
as a premier place to see real cars in action. Participants--limited
to 2,448 vehicles, one for every mile of the "Mother Road" that once
linked Southern California and Chicago--will cruise through downtown
San Bernardino in a series of events viewed by 500,000 spectators.
For information, call the San Bernardino Visitors and Convention
Bureau, (909) 889-3980, or go online at www .route-66.org.</LD>
<TE>   A less raucous car celebration will be held on the Palos Verdes
peninsula with the 10th running of what now is called the Acura Palos
Verdes Concours d'Elegance. The event will be on the fairways of the
Ocean Trails Golf Club and will feature everything from
turn-of-the-century horseless carriages to Indy cars and racing
motorcycles. Special events include a fashion show, children's art
activities, a designer's display highlighting the design selected for
the 2005 reintroduction of the Packard brand and an Acura-sponsored
display of NSX sports cars.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets are $30, with children younger than 16 admitted free.
Advance-purchase tickets for $20 can be obtained at www.pvconcours
.com. Information, (866) 522-7746.</TE>

<HD>Her New Slogan: 'Hybrid Thinking'</HD>
<DH>Marketing business owner likes her Prius so much she's
buying a small fleet for her company</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Colette Brooks bought a Toyota Prius for herself this summer and
liked it so much she bought two more, for the top assistants in her
Culver City marketing business. Now she's planning to add three more
to her 15-year-old company's first-ever corporate fleet.</LD>
<LD>   Although a number of government agencies around the country have
begun using hybrids for their employee car fleets, hybrid fleets for
private businesses such as Brooks' Big Imagination Group are
relatively rare. Toyota Motor Corp. and rival Honda Motor Co., which
sells two hybrids in the U.S., say there might be a few others, but
they don't know about them. The rental fleets of Los Angeles-based EV
Rentals are the closest they can come to another commercial use of
hybrids.</LD>
<LD>   Ron Cogan, publisher of the Green Car Journal and a consultant to
the auto industry on environmental issues, says he hasn't heard of
other private hybrid fleets either.</LD>
<TE>   But the car makers and "green" car enthusiasts such as Cogan say
that as more and more business owners like Brooks discover the
high-mileage, low-emissions gasoline-electric cars, their use as
corporate cars should increase tremendously.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks says driving a hybrid, which replaced a 3-year-old
Volkswagen Eurovan as her daily transportation, has made her more
environmentally aware and launched her on a new mission. She's
refocusing her business a bit and now is aggressively pursuing
"green" clients, she says.</TE>
<TE>   Getting a Prius and discovering its benefits, she says, even
inspired her to come up with a new slogan for her marketing
business--"hybrid thinking."</TE>
<TE>   Making the leap from a van to a Prius wasn't that difficult for
Brooks, a 44-year-old who describes herself as a bit of an
unconventional thinker, a dog lover and an avid surfer. "I drive from
Malibu to Culver City every day, and I wanted efficient
transportation that was big enough for my surfboard," she says. "We
have six vehicles, and except for the [Subaru] Outback my husband
drives, they are all gas guzzlers."</TE>
<TE>   After shopping around she decided on the Prius because it seats
five, gets upward of 50 miles per gallon--thanks to its small
gasoline engine augmented by an electric motor--and is distinctive
enough to tell others that she's driving something special.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks says she also wanted to send a signal in the wake of the
summer's corporate greed and corruption scandals that not every
businessperson is all about spending money. "I've had BMWs and
Mercedes-Benzes and Range Rovers," she says. "I wanted something
responsible."</TE>
<TE>   She quickly decided that she also wanted to share her newfound
feeling of environmental and corporate responsibility, so she bought
two more and gave them to her top assistants as "employee perks. Now
we're going to get three more." Which will be six cars for a company
with 10 employees.</TE>
<TE>   To help drive home her respect for hybrids, Brooks designed and
printed large vinyl graphics she applied to each Prius. "So What
Drives You?" they ask others on the highway.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a wonderful statement," Cogan says. "It is hard to find
examples of hybrid use in the early stages of these cars, and this
woman with her small fleet is a great statement all in itself. But
when she wraps them in that slogan it really makes them stand out, so
she's helping to elevate these vehicles in the public consciousness."</TE>
<TE>   Brooks says her greening comes in part because of her love of the
outdoors, but it has had some tangible payoffs as well.</TE>
<TE>   "We did the figuring in-house and estimate that with just three
cars we'll save the company $4,500 a year in fuel costs."</TE>

<HD>Ford Focuses on Quality With Longer Warranty</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoping to reignite interest in its recall-plagued Focus, Ford Motor
Co. says it will offer a five-year, 100,000-mile extended powertrain
warranty on 2003 models.</LD>
<LD>   Since the compact was introduced in 2000, there have been 11
safety-related recalls: seven for 2000 models, three for 2001 models
and one for 2002 models. The National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration also is investigating reports of engine compartment
fires in Focus models of all three years.</LD>
<LD>   Ford executives say the extended warranty is part of a
$100-million marketing and advertising campaign aimed at
reestablishing the Focus as an agile, fun-to-drive, economical car.</LD>
<TE>   Providing a longer warranty period is Ford's way of telling buyers
they don't have to be afraid of investing in the vehicle.
Additionally, Ford is making the extended warranty transferable if
the original owner sells the car before the five years are up. That,
Ford hopes, will increase consumer confidence and prop up prices of
used models.</TE>
<TE>   The extended powertrain warranty augments Ford's standard
three-year, 36,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty on the car. Through
August, Ford sold 164,036 Focus models (it comes as a sedan, a wagon
or a three-or five-door hatchback) in the United States. The company
would like to see sales rise to about 275,000 units a year.</TE>
<TE>   Online Support</TE>
<TE>   American Honda Motor Co. says the four-and five-speed automatic
transmission woes reported in last week's Highway 1 have occurred in
just 1.6% of the 1 million Hondas and Acuras sold with those
transmissions.</TE>
<TE>   The day after the story ran, it seemed as if the owners of most of
those cars with transmission problems were online, e-mailing more
tales of woe and seeking more assistance. One thing consistently
asked for that wasn't provided in the original article were the
addresses of the online forums dedicated to Acura and Honda
transmission problems.</TE>
<TE>   So here they are.</TE>
<TE>   The only one with a specific transmission problem discussion is:</TE>
<TE>   www.acura-cl.com/forums. Go to "Frequent Topics" and the
transmission problems forum is the first one listed.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Lear, the Webmaster, says he welcomes input from fans as well
as foes. An ongoing poll, for instance, shows that most respondents
have not had any problem with their Acura transmissions--a result in
line with Honda's figures.</TE>
<TE>   Lear's forum is dedicated to the Acura CL coupe. There is another
forum, www.acura-tl.com, for owners of the Acura sedan. Go to the
"forums" header, then "TL discussion," where a number of topics,
including transmission problems, are kicked around.</TE>
<TE>   And for Honda owners (the four-speed automatics on V-6 equipped
Accords and Odyssey minivans are the ones that can have problems)
there's www.v6accord.com/forums, which has a continuing transmission
discussion under the "performance parts" heading.</TE>
<TE>   Cars Rule in California</TE>
<TE>   It is common knowledge these days that light trucks--defined as
pickups, minivans and sport utility vehicles--are outselling standard
passenger cars in the U.S. It first happened in 1999, and the truck
share of the market has grown each year since.</TE>
<TE>   But that's a national average.</TE>
<TE>   Surprising as it may seem, especially to passenger-car drivers
surrounded by pickups and SUVs, trucks still are No. 2 in California.</TE>
<TE>   The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers says the annual Ward's
Motor Vehicles Facts and Figures shows that last year consumers in 36
states bought more trucks than cars.</TE>
<TE>   But in California and 13 other states, including neighboring
Nevada, trucks accounted for slightly less than 50% of all new
passenger vehicle registrations in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Jed Connelly, senior vice president of Gardena-based Nissan North
America, says that although the balance is close in California, the
scales still tip toward cars because of the climate.</TE>
<TE>   "Sports cars and convertibles do it," says Connelly, whose company
doesn't offer convertibles but has just re-launched one of the
country's most recognizable sports car lines, the Nissan Z, with a
convertible version coming next year.</TE>
<TE>   The list of states where cars are preferred by a slight margin
includes a couple of other sunny climes--Florida and Hawaii--as well
as Eastern seaboard states with major urban centers, where smaller,
more fuel-efficient cars make more sense than trucks.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it is only a matter of time before trucks rule everywhere.
The imbalance is growing steadily. The Ward's data show that
registrations of new trucks last year totaled 9.1 million, or 52% of
all new non-commercial vehicles. That represented 570,000 more trucks
than cars nationally. In 2000, the margin was trucks 51%, cars 49%,
with 250,000 more trucks.</TE>
<TE>   New Ferrari Chief</TE>
<TE>   Former Ferrari of Germany Managing Director Maurizio Parlato has
been appointed president and chief executive of Ferrari and Maserati
North America. He replaces Stuart Robinson, who has left the company.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, North America has been Ferrari's leading market, and
with the return of Maserati to the U.S. and Canada, Parlato's New
Jersey-based unit also is expected to become the top Maserati
marketer.</TE>

<HD>ATV Fans Call Media Scrutiny Unfair</HD>
<DH>All-terrain vehicle riders, responding to calls for limits,
say the recklessness of a few people is skewing public perception.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEANNE WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ross Buchanan is an avid all-terrain vehicle rider who bemoans the
reckless behavior and hell-raising by a few that have tarnished the
sport he and his family love so much.</LD>
<LD>   "Ninety-nine percent of people out there riding all-terrain
vehicles are very cautious and responsible about how their kids
ride," says Buchanan, who's been riding ATVs in California for close
to 20 years.</LD>
<LD>   "It seems the troublesome riders or the relatively few people who
get hurt get most of the attention."</LD>
<TE>   Quading, as riding the four-wheel off-road vehicles is commonly
called, has become a big family sport, enthusiasts say.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so cute," Buchanan says. "You see the mom and dad riding,
and the kids following behind them like little ducklings."</TE>
<TE>   But the sport recently has come under intense scrutiny by safety,
medical and environmental advocates who worry about the number of
children killed each year in ATV-related accidents.</TE>
<TE>   Some want a federal rule barring riders younger than 16 from using
adult-size ATVs. Others want a complete ban on use of ATVs of any
size by children younger than 16.</TE>
<TE>   Their call for a federal inquiry on ATV safety by the Consumer
Product Safety Commission, reported in a Sept. 4 Your Wheels column,
has angered many ATV fans. Some say they fear the sport would suffer
under the proposed ban and stricter rules.</TE>
<TE>   Advocacy groups, including the Consumer Federation of America, the
American Academy of Pediatrics and various environmental groups, note
that the Consumer Product Safety Commission recently reported that
there have been 4,541 ATV-related deaths nationwide in the last two
decades and that 38% of those killed were children younger than 16.
More than 800 of the youngsters killed in ATV-related accidents were
younger than 12.</TE>
<TE>   With its popular sand dunes and desert recreational lands,
California is a major ATV market. That is perhaps why, according to
the Consumer Federation report, California leads the nation with 278
ATV-related fatalities.</TE>
<TE>   Buchanan, a Simi Valley resident, was one of several readers who
wrote in response to the Sept. 4 column ("Coalition Targets Youths'
ATV Use").</TE>
<TE>   Most complained that the sport is getting a bad rap in the media
and said the column unfairly sensationalized the actions of a
relatively few irresponsible parents and ATV riders.</TE>
<TE>   Reader Don Williams said all the column did was "regurgitate the
press releases of the anti-ATVers who are nothing more than
environmental extremists who pose as safety advocates."</TE>
<TE>   Williams, of Malibu, identified himself via e-mail as the managing
editor of ATV Action magazine. The magazine's Web site says the call
for a federal inquiry on ATV safety comes from "a very disturbing
alliance of trial lawyer-dominated 'consumer' groups and envirokooks
out to end ATVing."</TE>
<TE>   Buchanan, too, worries that pressure by environmental groups to
keep certain areas off-limits to ATVs will put a damper on his
family's vacations and weekends.</TE>
<TE>   During the winter, he says, he takes his wife and two children,
ages 12 and 16, ATV riding nearly every other weekend, usually at the
sand dunes near El Centro or in the desert near Death Valley.</TE>
<TE>   He says his family has never witnessed an ATV-related accident and
attributes that to stepped-up enforcement of safety rules in popular
recreation areas. But he acknowledges that accidents do happen and
says that alcohol, reckless behavior and people driving their ATVs at
night are often the causes.</TE>
<TE>   Under the rules of the Bureau of Land Management, no alcoholic
beverages are allowed while riding ATVs or other vehicles on
BLM-regulated lands. And under California law for off-highway
vehicles, helmets must be worn and children must be supervised by
parents.</TE>
<TE>   Though there are special, child-size ATVs available from most
manufacturers, there are no laws requiring children to use them, and
some ATV-enthusiast parents see them as too limiting.</TE>
<TE>   Buchanan, for example, says that though his son, Trevor, 12, rides
one of the smaller, child-size vehicles, it's too small for his
5-foot-9-inch frame. He says Trevor really needs to move up to a
larger, adult-size vehicle that would better accommodate him.</TE>
<TE>   As for Trevor, he says ATV riding is "really fun ... especially
when the sand is soft and gives you a smoother ride."</TE>
<TE>   The Buchanans say that they don't let Trevor and his 16-year-old
sister ride double on ATVs and that they make sure both children wear
full protective riding gear, including special padded pants, boots,
helmets, goggles and gloves.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very safety-conscious with our children," Buchanan says.
"We love it all--the camping, the campfires and the riding.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing beats a wonderful family vacation, but adults also must
heed the concerns expressed by physicians who treat youngsters
injured or killed in ATV accidents.</TE>
<TE>   "It is time to say enough is enough, and put the safety of our
children first," says Dr. Rebecca Brown, assistant director of
services at Children's Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Just because fall is coming doesn't mean the grill goes in the
garage. Slightly cooler weather can make for better grilling (who
wants to sweat over a hot fire?). And grilled food enlivens a fall
menu.</LD>
<LD>   For a change of pace, try Cornish hens. Their taste is mild and
delicate enough to handle robust marinades. And their petite size
lends them to more festive presentations.</LD>
<LD>   Here, the hens are cloaked in an orange marinade and finished on
the grill at the end of their cooking with an orange marmalade glaze.
The glaze goes on at the last minute so it doesn't burn. The warm
spinach salad is a perfect accompaniment to the hens, a fresh and
vibrant mix. It's an easy way to get spinach on the table.</LD>
<TE>   Cooler weather also offers a chance to serve heartier, seasonal
side dishes, such as this wild rice with dried apricots, which can be
made ahead. The tricky aspect is cooking the wild rice. Check the
rice often after 30 minutes and turn off the heat while the rice is
still a little chewy. Overcook it, and the grains will split open and
turn too mushy for this salad.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Grilled Cornish Hens</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 1  1/2 hours, plus 4 hours
marinating</TE>
<TE>   Nonstick cooking spray</TE>
<TE>   3 small Cornish hens, about 2 pounds each, thawed if frozen,
split, backbone removed with kitchen shears</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup orange juice</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup balsamic vinegar</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon minced garlic</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon minced shallot</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon finely grated orange zest</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   2/3 cup orange marmalade mixed with 2 tablespoons low-sodium soy
sauce, for glaze</TE>
<TE>   Orange slices, for serving</TE>
<TE>   Spray a grill rack set 4 inches from the heat source with nonstick
cooking spray. Heat the grill to medium.</TE>
<TE>   Place the hens in a large plastic food bag. Combine the orange
juice, vinegar, oil, garlic, rosemary, shallot, zest, soy sauce, 1/2
teaspoon of salt, red pepper flakes and pepper in a small bowl. Pour
the marinade over the hens. Turn the bag around several times until
the hens are evenly coated with the marinade. Marinate 4 to 6 hours,
refrigerated, turning the bag occasionally. Bring the hens to room
temperature 30 minutes before grilling.</TE>
<TE>   Remove the hens from the marinade; discard the marinade. Lightly
sprinkle the hens with salt and pepper.</TE>
<TE>   Place the hens skin side down on the rack. Grill, turning with
tongs 3 to 4 times, until the meat is fully opaque (insert a knife in
the joint between the breast and thigh to check; there should be no
redness), and the skin is brown and crispy. This should take about 40
minutes. Brush each side of the hens with the glaze on the last turn.</TE>
<TE>   Transfer them to a platter. Brush the tops with the glaze again.
Arrange the Warm Spinach Salad on a platter. Place the hens
attractively on top. Garnish the platter with the orange slices and
rosemary sprigs. Serve immediately. Alternately, serve the hens and
salad on separate platters; this way, the hens can be served warm or
at room temperature.</TE>

<TE>   Place the spinach in a large bowl; cover with a damp paper towel.
(The spinach can be refrigerated several hours or overnight.) Combine
the vinegar, water, oil, salt and pepper to taste in a small bowl.
Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Cook the bacon in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat
until crisp, about 4 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the
bacon to a paper towel. Pour off the fat but do not clean or wipe the
pan. Add the vinaigrette to pan. (This can be done several hours
ahead and kept at room temperature.)</TE>
<TE>   To serve, bring the vinaigrette to a boil; add the onion. Pour the
hot vinaigrette over the spinach. Toss several times to coat the
greens. Add freshly ground pepper and the bacon. Toss. Taste; adjust
the seasoning. Serve immediately.</TE>

drain in a colander. Rinse under running water; drain. Add the rice
to the saucepan, reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, until the
rice is just tender but still chewy. Do not overcook. Check the
texture often after 30 minutes; the rice will take about 45 minutes.
Add more water if the mixture is dry. Place the rice in a strainer to
drain off any liquid; transfer to a medium bowl.</TE>
<TE>   While the rice is still warm, toss with the lemon juice and oil.
Let the mixture cool to room temperature. Add the cucumber, parsley,
mint, poultry seasoning, red pepper flakes and pepper. Use a fork to

<DH>For Indian curry with finesse and fire, look no farther

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles is a city proud of its spectacular range of ethnic foods
and proud, too, that so much of it is authentic. When it comes to
authenticity, however, a glaring exception is Indian curry. Oh, there
are many dishes that are described as curry. But, trust us, they're
just impostors.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the genuine article does in fact exist here. It's just that
you have to know where to look and know what you're looking for. And
if you find it--or if you prepare it at home--you're in for a
culinary epiphany. A true curry is carefully cooked, with freshly
ground spices balanced skillfully so that the flavor is alluringly
spicy--not just fiery hot. Good curries are never drenched with oil
or thickened with flour. And they never taste alike. Each has its own
character, and each should be eaten thoughtfully. Those who
understand curry know it is best appreciated when it is tempered with
rice or bread, rather than being scooped up straight, as if it were a
soup or a stew.</LD>
<TE>   These are four of the best curries I've eaten in this city. Each
is from a different region of India, and each is a stunning
representation of that style of cooking. The chefs were willing to
tell how they make them, even volunteering to demonstrate so we could
see how they created these superb flavors. All of them are easy to
reproduce at home, even if you've never cooked Indian food before.
There are no secret techniques, only meticulous procedures and
timing. Follow directions, work with patience and use the correct
ingredients, and you will have an excellent curry, too.</TE>
<TE>   Once you've experienced the real thing, you'll never settle for
bogus cooking--the kormas made with canned white sauce, Punjabi
seasonings from the north thrown into south Indian food, garam masala
sprinkled on every dish. It's not always a matter of deception. Cooks
may have no professional training, and may not have the time or
resources to roast and grind spices and prepare sauces fresh each
day. It's more convenient to use commercially ground spices and store
batches of sauce in the refrigerator.</TE>
<TE>   Here's just one example of what happens. Almost every restaurant
slaps the word vindaloo onto a fiery dish that tastes nothing like it
would in its place of origin, which is Goa, the former Portuguese
enclave on the west coast of India.</TE>
<TE>   Goan food is particularly difficult to find here, so we sought out
one of the few Goan chefs in the city, Addi Decosta, to explain how
vindaloo should be made. For years, Decosta cooked his
vinegar-seasoned curry at Chicken Madras in Hawthorne. (He has sold
that place and will open a new restaurant, Addi's Tandoor, in Redondo
Beach next month.)</TE>
<TE>   A Goan native, Decosta is scandalized by American vindaloos that
reek of tomato sauce--a real no-no. Goan cooks of the past relied on
vinegar as a preservative, because they didn't have refrigeration, he
says. When tomato sauce is added, the vinegar has to be reduced to
balance the acidity. This throws off the flavor.</TE>
<TE>   "Vindaloo is like a pickle, almost," Decosta says. "The longer you
keep it, the better it tastes." Goan cooks stored their vindaloo in
clay pots, reheating it as needed. The standing time also tenderizes
tough meat. Pork is traditional in vindaloo, but today more Goan
cooks are opting for lighter foods and have switched to shrimp. The
difference is seafood has to be cooked and served immediately.</TE>
<TE>   It's not likely Goan food will become more common in Los Angeles,
because Goan chefs are not immigrating here. "In Goa, they have many
resorts, so they are all busy over there," Decosta says. "And they
are very well paid."</TE>
<TE>   Sanjay Dwivedi, executive chef of Tantra, a new restaurant in
Silver Lake, has just arrived from London where he cooked at Zaika, a
top Indian restaurant that was awarded a Michelin star in 2001. He is
also taking an ambitious approach here. "I want to put Indian food on
the map--good Indian food, so that people know it's light, it's
healthy, it's flavorsome, rather than just tasting of spices," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Dwivedi already has diners raving about his intense, deep brown
rogan josh, a Kashmiri lamb dish. One customer even rushed into the
kitchen to say, "That's the best lamb curry I ever tasted."</TE>
<TE>   Good rogan josh should taste "really oniony" and meaty, Dwivedi
says. The dish cooks for hours, first a massive batch of sliced
onions, along with some of the spices, then lamb shanks, meat and
more seasonings. "The amount of time spent making this curry is why
it tastes the way it does--beautiful," Dwivedi says.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone in the kitchen gives a stir as the creamy mixture bubbles
in a huge pot--but no cream is added, and very little liquid. "It's
the onions that make the sauce thick and give the lamb flavor,"
Dwivedi says.</TE>
<TE>   The onions are cooked until golden brown, and this darkens the
curry. Other cooks in Tantra's kitchen were surprised at the deep
hue. They were accustomed to lighter rogan joshes that contain much
more tomato. "You can have a hint of tomatoes," Dwivedi says. "but
you can't put in too much. It will spoil it."</TE>
<TE>   The final touch is garam masala--freshly made from spices such as
cinnamon sticks, cloves, mace, green and black cardamoms, fennel
seeds and bay leaves that are dry roasted and then ground. Dwivedi
stirs in sugar and lemon juice, too, to counteract sharpness.</TE>
<TE>   "How you cook your spices is the main difference in a curry," he
says. "If your spices are raw or have not been cooked all the way, it
can taste very bitter. The oil can't be too hot, or the spices will
burn. If too cold, the flavors won't come out." And don't even dream
about spice blends. "The last thing you want to use is curry powder,"
he says.</TE>
<TE>   Yes--a good curry is not made with curry powder. A classic book on
Indian food, "Mrs. Balbir Singh's Indian Cookery," published
repeatedly since it first appeared in 1961, attributes "drabness and
monotony" to ready-made curry powders.</TE>
<TE>   Those are the last words you'd use to describe the Chicken
Mangalorean at Surya on West Third Street. It is a truly glorious
dish. Even though it has never been put on the menu, everyone seems
to know it's there. As a matter of fact, it's the second most popular
dish after chicken tikka masala, says owner Sheel Joshi. "We have
quite a few people who won't eat anything else, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Creamy, unctuous and just a little spicy, it is devastatingly
addictive. Joshi devised the recipe, phoning to Mangalore on India's
southwest coast for input. "It's a mix of north and south," he says.
The classic northern seasonings--ginger, garlic, cinnamon, cloves and
cardamoms--get together with southern coconut milk, curry leaves and
mustard seeds.</TE>
<TE>   At first glance, one assumes the cook was not paying attention and
burned the spices. But the black flecks in the golden sauce are
deliberate. Fresh curry leaves, mustard seeds and red chiles cook in
oil so hot that the curry leaves crackle and turn black instantly.
The chiles also blacken. "They should burn--that really gives the
flavor to the oil," Joshi says.</TE>
<TE>   The taste of curry leaves is hard to describe. Think of toned-down
eucalyptus crossed with pepper, a flavor unlike anything in the gamut
of herbs and spices that most Americans know. It is what gives this
dish its cachet. Without curry leaves, the sauce would be pleasantly
creamy, but not distinctive.</TE>
<TE>   No longer rare, curry leaves are sold fresh in many Indian
markets. But they're not always available, and that's why chicken
Mangalorean is not printed on the menu.</TE>
<TE>   Another creamy curry, malai kofta, comes from the Punjab. It's
usually reserved for weddings and other festive occasions, but you
can have it every day at A-1 Produce and Veggie Lovers Deli in
Northridge. At one side of this large market is a kitchen and deli
counter serving vegetarian dishes and a display of luscious Indian
sweets and snacks.</TE>
<TE>   Here you can buy freshly made paneer cheese, one of the
ingredients in malai kofta. Malai means creamy, and kofta is food
shaped into a ball. The cheese is grated along with vegetables to
form the balls, which are bound with besan (chick pea flour). The
kofta are fried until golden brown, then added to a sauce that
combines tomatoes, onion and a raft of spices with rich, heavy
whipping cream.</TE>
<TE>   Somi and Veena Rehil, who own the market, are from northern India.
Somi is from Chandigarh, the capital of the Punjab, and so they know
this style of cooking intimately. Like Decosta and Dwivedi, they
insist on fresh seasonings. Customers sometimes think that curry
means a dish made with special curry powder, Veena Rehil says. "We
never use curry powder."</TE>
<TE>   But of course, curry powder is entrenched in the West. It's the
key seasoning for that common "curry" cooked with apples and served
with cute little dishes of raisins, coconut, mango chutney and other
condiments. I have to admit, this dish can be pretty good. I remember
eating lots of it in college, cooked by Sikh students who did the
best they could with what they could find in a small-town market.</TE>
<TE>   But it's nothing compared with India's extraordinary curries--the
sumptuous banquet dishes of the Mogul emperors, the Hyderabadi
curries that blend Mogul cuisine with southern ingredients, the sweet
vegetarian dishes of Gujarat, and so many more. Too bad we can't
taste them all, but we're lucky to have a few worthy contenders.</TE>

is very tender, 20 minutes longer. Stir in the lemon juice and sugar,
then season to taste with salt. Divide among 8 serving plates, making
sure each serving has a lamb shank piece.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The mango did it. The Meyer lemon did it. Over the years, many fruits
have crossed the barrier from exotic rarity to become available to
all of us. First prized by immigrants or backyard hobbyists, they're
seized upon by farmers looking for lucrative new crops. Then, they're
propelled into supermarkets.</LD>
<LD>   Now there's a new one poised to make the leap, and it's safe to
say it is the strangest one yet.</LD>
<LD>   The pitahaya--a.k.a. the dragon fruit--is an outlandishly flaming
pink, spineless cactus fruit that looks like an artichoke from Mars.
Improbably enough, it's now the object of a mad scramble, one of the
most colorful booms in California's agricultural history, replete
with paranoia and intrigue. Many doubters scoffed, but the first
commercial harvest is arriving at stores this week.</LD>
<TE>   The texture of the flesh is similar to kiwifruit, though its
subtle flavor and refreshing juiciness are really more reminiscent of
watermelon. The first type to be marketed domestically is the
white-fleshed dragon fruit, which has translucent pulp dotted with
tiny, edible black seeds; these are soft and not at all gritty, as
are those in common prickly cactus pears.</TE>
<TE>   Two dozen similar-looking species, some with red-colored flesh,
vary considerably in quality, from insipid gelatinized mousse to
delightfully sweet strawberry-flavored pulp.</TE>
<TE>   Pitahayas mostly are eaten fresh, sliced in wedges or cut in half
and scooped out with a spoon. Some people like them refrigerated or
with a dash of lemon or lime to add balance. In tropical lands where
they are abundant, the fruits are juiced for drinks and made into
sorbet and ice cream. They keep for a week or more in the fridge,
though they gradually lose firmness and acidity and turn flabby.</TE>
<TE>   Although few chefs have yet seen or tasted dragon fruit, those who
have are eagerly awaiting its availability.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so visually stunning that our customers are intrigued by
it," said Bill Yosses, pastry chef of Citarella restaurant in New
York, who has used wedges of the fruit to garnish a trifle. "I'd love
to try making a confit of that scaly skin--I have a hunch that it's
edible."</TE>
<TE>   Pitahayas, also called pitayas, are climbing cacti native to the
tropical forests of Mexico, Central America and parts of South
America. California gardeners have grown the plants for decades,
often as backyard ornamentals. Until recently, however, no one
thought to establish a commercial orchard here. The plants were
reputed to be tricky to grow here and to require labor-intensive
hand-pollination to bear fruits.</TE>
<TE>   California pitahaya cultivation is still in its infancy, as
growers determine the best techniques to nourish their plants and
protect them against sunburn, cold, wind and gophers.</TE>
<TE>   The planting that is largest and furthest along is the 18 acres
grown by the Dragon Fruit Co. in Borrego Springs, 25 miles west of
the Salton Sea. Surrounded by grapefruit groves and swathed in
shadecloth to protect the plants from the scorching sun, it has been
dubbed the "skunkworks" by rare fruit fanciers after the top-secret
Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Co. facilities in Burbank and Palmdale.
The company is eager to keep competitors from learning its
technology, and posted signs warn against trespassing.</TE>
<TE>   "We're out in the middle of nowhere for a reason," said Ron Bunch,
a plant breeder for D'Arrigo Bros., a large grower and produce
wholesaler and the senior partner in the pitahaya venture.</TE>
<TE>   A parade of uninvited visitors--some competitors, others just
curious--have come snooping in the last year, according to Thomas
Antel, another partner who owns the land. Some have even sliced the
netting around the facility to spy inside, he said, so he recently
installed infrared cameras and motion sensors.</TE>
<TE>   The partners have battled hard freezes and 120-degree days, both
potentially fatal to pitahayas. The harsh climate is rough on humans
too. "Above 115 degrees, it starts to get to you a bit," Antel said.
"When you roll down the window your eyes turn to poached eggs."</TE>
<TE>   The partners are determined to be the first commercial producers
of pitahayas and dominate the market, before supplies increase and
prices drop. Dragon fruit from backyard growers currently fetch $5 a
pound wholesale, but Coosemans Los Angeles, a specialty produce
wholesaler, has been marketing pitahaya (ranging from half a pound to
2 pounds each) from a small planting in Carpenteria to high-end
hotels such as the Bellagio in Las Vegas and the Beverly Hills Hotel
for $15 to $17 a pound. "For something this special, they don't care
what it costs," said Omar Reynaga, a salesman.</TE>
<TE>   Already at least a dozen more California growers have pitahaya
plantings in various stages of development. Some hang up the phone as
soon as the subject of pitahaya is broached, but others readily share
their information and plant materials.</TE>
<TE>   Sven Merten, 33, left a career in biotechnology to grow exotic
fruit on a farm on a stony hillside in Rainbow, in north San Diego
County. His license plates read DRGNFRT and PITAYA.</TE>
<TE>   "I was looking for a crop that would do well here, that no one
else was growing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago he assembled an experimental collection of 60
pitahaya selections, mostly from fellow members of California Rare
Fruit Growers, an organization of fruit gardening enthusiasts. Once
he figures out which varieties from this half-acre test plot offer
the best combination of productivity and good flavor, Merten plans to
put in five acres of pitahaya. It will take two years after this
planting, he said, for a commercial crop.</TE>
<TE>   Most of his plants bear round or slightly oblong fruits, with
waxy, pinkish-red skin and fleshy scales that might well befit a
tropical dragon. Each sports a showy "tail," actually the dried
flower from which it is formed.</TE>
<TE>   The French brought pitahayas to Vietnam a century ago, and many
new California growers are immigrants who knew the fruit in their
homeland. Not far from Merten, in Fallbrook, Dziep Dang of Bien Hoa
Farm tends 10 steamy greenhouses packed with 3,000 healthy pitahaya
plants. She and her husband, Harold Do, though, call the cactus thanh
long, meaning "green dragon." Dangling over wooden and metal pipe
supports, the plants bear vivid pink fruits.</TE>
<TE>   The farm's season started three weeks ago and runs through
October. Dang sells the plants and fruits on weekends, and brokers
also distribute them to Vietnamese markets in Little Saigon,
Westminster and Garden Grove.</TE>
<TE>   Dang's dragon fruit plants are self-pollinating, a crucial
convenience for commercial farmers. In the tropics bats and moths
pollinate the pitahaya's large, fragrant white flowers, which open
only once near sunset and close just after sunrise. Here, however,
the insects required by many pitahaya types seem to be absent, and
they must be pollinated by hand.</TE>
<TE>   The pitahayas prevalent in Central America have red, violet or
fluorescent fuchsia pulp. Compared to the white-fleshed types, many
are sweeter and have more complex, interesting flavors. But so far,
at least, California growers have favored the more readily available
white-fleshed type, which yields larger fruits, comes into bearing
earlier and generally does not require hand pollination.</TE>
<TE>   One of the few American growers of red-fleshed pitahaya, Jim
Weiss, demonstrated hand pollination at his four tangles of cacti
sprawling underneath buzzing power lines in Torrance. Just after
sunrise recently, he took some pollen from a flower's stamen between
his thumb and forefinger and rubbed it on the pistil.</TE>
<TE>   "Simple enough," he said. "My biggest challenge is remembering
when they are going to bloom and getting over here in time."</TE>
<TE>   While California growers are putting in their orchards, some fear
that they may soon be undercut by foreign fruit. Although widely
grown in many tropical countries, fresh pitahaya has not been legally
imported into the United States because it is a host of fruit flies
that could damage domestic agriculture. Foreign growers have
concentrated on Europe and Canada, but as American demand increases,
that may change.</TE>
<TE>   Colombian growers, who raise an oblong, yellow-skinned form of
pitahaya that is sweeter and more luscious than any other (but very
vulnerable to freezes), have already applied to the U.S. Department
of Agriculture to export fruit fumigated with methyl bromide.</TE>
<TE>   Companies in Vietnam and Thailand recently signed contracts for
the construction of electron beam irradiation facilities that could
zap the pests in pitahaya and other fruits, allowing them to be
exported to the U.S. Meanwhile, there are a few small-scale plantings
in Hawaii, and interest is increasing in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to fresh fruit, products made with processed pitahaya
are now on the market. Nicaragua, in the heart of the pitahaya's home
range, has 2,000 acres of red-fleshed fruit--more than the export
market can absorb.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking to make use of this surplus, a Nicaraguan company markets
frozen pitahaya pulp and concentrate as a flavoring and coloring.</TE>
<TE>   A few creative chefs have used them in sorbet and bakery goods,
but the major use has been in manufacturing drinks.</TE>
<TE>   Snapple Beverage Corp. now offers a drink made with "dragon fruit
juice" called Fire, which tastes like Hawaiian Punch, and SoBe
Beverages sells Dragon, a "dragon fruit blend." The Vietnamese
maintain that only white-fleshed varieties should properly be called
dragon fruit, but so far no dragons have sued for trademark
infringement.</TE>

It had a sweet vanilla spice, plum cherry flavors and the tannins

<LD>Leg of lamb never tastes better than when it is marinated, crusted
with herbs and grilled medium-rare. For a terrific dinner for six,
plus enough leftovers for a weeknight sandwich supper, buy a 3
1/2-to 4-pound boned and butterflied leg of lamb. Grill it one day,
enjoy these sandwiches the next.</LD>
<LD>   To make the marinade, mince 6 large cloves of garlic and mix with
1/2 cup of olive oil, 1 teaspoon of salt and 2 teaspoons of freshly
ground pepper. Pour the marinade over the lamb and marinate in the
refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours. Just before grilling, remove the lamb
from the marinade and coat one side with  1/4 cup dried oregano and
the other side with  1/4 cup crushed dried rosemary.</LD>
<LD>   For grilled-to-perfection lamb, grill over a medium-hot fire,
covered, for about 15 minutes per side. You can slice and peek to
check for doneness, but I'm a big fan of instant-read thermometers.
Medium-rare is 120 to 130 degrees.</LD>

Who Play With Fire," (Chronicle Books, $16.95).</TE>
<TE>   As a time saver, use roasted red peppers available in jars at
well-stocked supermarkets. Blot dry with a paper towel before
slicing.</TE>

<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 25 minutes</TE>
<TE>   2 red bell peppers, cored and quartered</TE>
<TE>   4 pita breads, halved</TE>
<TE>   1 cup plain yogurt</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup mayonnaise</TE>
<TE>   Zest of 1 lemon</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon lemon juice</TE>
<TE>   1 large English cucumber</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh mint</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   1 pound grilled leg of lamb, thinly sliced, then cut into thin
strips</TE>
<TE>   Heat the broiler. Place the peppers on a rimmed baking sheet
skin-side-up. Broil until the skin is blackened, 8 to 10 minutes.
Wrap in damp paper towels and set aside while you make the sauce.
Turn the oven to 250 degrees. Wrap the pitas in foil and warm in the
oven.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, combine the yogurt, mayonnaise, lemon zest and juice in
a bowl. Trim the ends of the cucumber. Use the coarse side of a box
grater to grate about 1/3 of the cucumber, including the peel.
Without packing it, measure 1 cup. Grate more if needed. Mix the
grated cucumber, mint and salt into the yogurt mixture. Add pepper to
taste. Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Cut the rest of the cucumber into 2-inch-long matchsticks. Scrape
the skin off the peppers and cut into thin strips. Mix the cucumber,
peppers and lamb in a large bowl. Add 2/3 cup of the sauce and gently
mix. Fill each pita half and serve immediately. Serve the sandwiches
with crudites (raw veggies), using the extra sauce as a dip.</TE>

<LD>The New Orleans version of the snow cone has turned up in an unlikely
place--an industrial stretch of Santa Fe Avenue in South Gate. There,
a stand called New Orleans Snoballs dispenses cups of soft crushed
ice drenched with syrups that range from exotic tamarind, mango and
kiwi-strawberry to old-fashioned vanilla, caramel and cherry and
novelties such as bubble gum and cotton candy. For a really cool
experience, try a stuffed Snoball composed of vanilla or chocolate
ice cream sandwiched between two Snoballs in any flavor you choose.</LD>

<HD>For Vodka, an Absolution</HD>
<DH>Two California distillers have a revolutionary idea: use
pure fruit, not artificial flavorings</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROD SMITH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vodka is the ultimate flavor delivery vehicle. It is officially
defined as an odorless, colorless, flavorless spirit, but any
connoisseur will assure you that the crystalline weight and purity of
a fine vodka offer a sensation that is, if not exactly a flavor, an
unmistakable impression.</LD>
<LD>   It's a kind of expectant void in which the senses are poised to
receive taste itself, a Zen-like stillness awaiting only the specific
nuances that will make the mind say, "Ah, lemon. Ah, lime. Ah,
Buddha's Hand citron ..."</LD>
<LD>   So why have flavored vodkas been almost uniformly disappointing?
Why do they almost always taste like Kool-Aid? It could be because
most are made in much the same way, pumped full of artificial
flavorings.</LD>
<TE>   Now, two of the finest artisan distillers in California are trying
to break out of that trap, making spectacular flavored vodka by
infusing the neutral spirit with crushed pure fruit. Not quite
convinced by the generic citrus-like tang of Absolut Citron and its
ilk? Try Domaine Charbay Ruby Red Grapefruit or Hangar One Mandarin
Blossom.</TE>
<TE>   The difference between these flavored vodkas and the
run-of-the-mill high-production commercial varieties is like that
between watching a video and seeing a fresh print of the film on a
wide screen with THX sound.</TE>
<TE>   This combination of perfect flavor delivery vehicle and high
craftsmanship was probably bound to happen eventually. Vodka is the
most popular spirit on the American market, and has been since
shortly after its introduction by Smirnoff, in 1939. Last year about
40 million cases of vodka were sold in the U.S. (up 4% from 2000),
and industry analysts say 25% of all cocktails consumed are now made
with vodka.</TE>
<TE>   Flavored vodkas first became popular in this country in the 1990s,
when they were embraced by young, hip, cash-rich drinkers during the
decade's dot-com-driven hedonism. Every major vodka brand offers at
least one flavor. But for the most part, these are fit only to be
mixed into cocktails.</TE>
<TE>   That is not to say that the marriage came easily. In fact,
distilling vodka is a completely different process from most
small-volume artisan distillation. Producing vodka requires extremely
efficient distillation that was virtually impossible (or highly
impractical) before the invention of the column still in 1830. Vodkas
are usually made by the millions of gallons.</TE>
<TE>   The pot or alambic still, which is used for distilling most
brandies, whiskeys and eaux de vies, does only one small batch at a
time, and is not nearly as efficient in refinement and fortification
as a column still.</TE>
<TE>   That's good for most spirits, where some residual aroma and flavor
are desired. But it makes it tough to produce something as refined as
vodka. That's why both Hangar One and Charbay begin with base vodka
bought from specialty distillers in the Midwest. This is infused with
flavor and then a portion of it is re-distilled.</TE>
<TE>   Charbay's flavored vodka had its birth in 1995 when Marko
Karakasevic, the son of Napa Valley master distiller Miles
Karakasevic, was having a drink at Tra Vigne restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd been watching all the premium vodkas explode onto the
market," he recalls. "I didn't think we could compete in that market,
but then I noticed that the only flavored vodka on the back bar was
Absolut Citron. That tasted like a melted Popsicle to me. I knew we
could do better. And I realized that was the way to get in [to the
vodka market]."</TE>
<TE>   A Family Project</TE>
<TE>   The Karakasevic family began distilling 13 generations ago in
Eastern Europe. Since 1983 they have operated a still in the woods
high above Napa Valley on Spring Mountain, and more recently
installed another in a more accessible location in Ukiah. Miles has
become famous for his brandies, ports and eaux de vies, but the
flavored vodka project is almost entirely Marko's baby.</TE>
<TE>   At first he had to sell the idea to his father. "We're not in the
vodka business," said Miles. "We're all about fragrance. I think of
us as a house of perfume."</TE>
<TE>   What eventually sold him on the project was the idea that Charbay
flavored vodkas would be varietally specific infusions of fresh,
whole fruit.</TE>
<TE>   Hangar One is a joint project between two of the best-known
figures in California distilling, Ansley Coale of Germain-Robin and
Jorg Rupf of St. George Spirits. It was the possibility of doing
something better than what was commonly available that also convinced
Rupf when Coale approached him last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd never thought about doing vodka before," Rupf says. "Our
distillation processes are geared to extract maximum flavor. That's
what a good eau de vie is. Vodka is the opposite. It's counter to
what we do. But there has been a progression in the manufacture and
perception of vodka. Now the high-end imports have some distinctive
characteristics, and that's what opened my eyes to being able to get
involved."</TE>
<TE>   Domaine Charbay now has four flavored vodkas, with two more in
development. I especially like the clear, high-toned orange note in
the Meyer Lemon. The Key Lime is almost too intense alone, but a
little soda makes every sip a sojourn on some tropical beach.</TE>
<TE>   Blood Orange, which takes color as well as flavor from the fresh
fruit, leaves Absolut Mandrin in the dust. And why bother mixing a
Greyhound with canned grapefruit juice when you can sip Charbay's
Ruby Red Grapefruit Vodka on ice? Coming soon: raspberry and ginger.</TE>
<TE>   Crystalline Flavor</TE>
<TE>   Hangar One has three flavors. Unlike the Charbay vodkas, these are
almost clear, with just the slightest hint of color. But the aromas
and flavors are no less intense.</TE>
<TE>   Kaffir Lime has a blade-fine aroma and glycerin smoothness that
give an impression of skating on thin green ice.</TE>
<TE>   Buddha's Hand Citron is ravishing, inexplicable, enticing--and
then you taste it. The Mandarin Blossom is like a vivid, fleeting
dream of paradise.</TE>
<TE>   These remarkable flavored vodkas pretty much peg the pleasure
meter. However, they still come up short in one vital category.</TE>
<TE>   Because the commercial pepper vodkas are all dismal, those of us
who love the sensation of fiery ice have been left to our own crude
decoctions of, say, Ketl One and habaneros. We'd love to see what
Charbay and Hangar One could do with that.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Le Volte is actually the second label of the famed Tuscan estate
Ornellaia, which Robert Mondavi has just bought from Marchesi
Lucovico Antinori. (His older brother, Piero, runs the Antinori wine
estates.)</LD>
<LD>   The property is in Bolgheri, close to the Tuscan coast and not far
from Sassicaia, the estate which proved it was possible to make great
Bordeaux-style wines in this little-known area.</LD>
<LD>   This wine, distributed by Mondavi, stains the sides of the glass a
deep garnet with violet overtones. Dry and finely chiseled, this
delightful red--a blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and
Merlot--wears a cloak of gorgeous, plummy fruit. The good news is
that even in Tuscany, it is possible to find a bargain.</LD>
<TE>   About $20. Available at some Bristol Farms markets; Hi-Time Wine
Cellars in Costa Mesa, (949) 650-8463; Wally's in West Los Angeles,
(310) 475-0606; The Wine Club in Santa Ana, (714) 835-6485; The Wine
House in Los Angeles, (310) 479-3731 and Wine Exchange in Orange,

<LD>Sometimes a low-fat vegetable soup made with little fat or cream
lacks flavor. But try sauteing the vegetables before adding them to
the soup pot. You'll wind up with a full-bodied soup--one you'd swear
was fattening.</LD>
<LD>   It's important when cooking light to use just a little oil for
sauteing. In this recipe, nonstick cooking spray takes the place of
some of the oil.</LD>
<LD>   Boost the soup's flavor, too, by choosing the right vegetables.
Add leek and fennel, both strong in flavor, to the carrot, celery and
onion.</LD>
<TE>   A combination of chicken broth and water also adds flavor, but you
can make this soup vegetarian by using vegetable broth instead.</TE>
<TE>   For a final touch, a few teaspoons of an anise-flavored liqueur at
the end of cooking bring out the anise flavor of the soup.</TE>

carrot, celery and fennel. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the
vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the chicken broth,
water, potatoes and bay leaf. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat,
cover, and simmer until the vegetables are tender, 30 minutes.</TE>

<LD>Sole is a delicate but firm white fish that needs only a flash in the
pan with butter and lemon to be delicious. But when tomatoes and
basil are at their best, they're perfect as a topping for this sole,
which starts on the stove and finishes in the oven.</LD>
<LD>   I like the tomato topping so much that I make extra and serve it
on slices of toasted French bread.</LD>
<LD>   You can also use halibut or tilapia in this recipe; just be sure
to keep an eye on the fish as it cooks, particularly if some filets
are thicker and larger than others. Add a few extra minutes cooking
time for thicker filets.</LD>
<TE>   Sole Provencal</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 25 minutes</TE>
<TE>   2 pounds tomatoes, seeded and roughly chopped</TE>
<TE>   2 cloves garlic, finely minced</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons capers, drained</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup fresh basil leaves, thinly sliced</TE>
<TE>   5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 pounds sole filets</TE>
<TE>   About 1/2 cup flour, for dredging</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 400 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the tomatoes, garlic, capers, basil, 2 tablespoons of
olive oil, 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper in a bowl
and set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Rinse the fish and pat dry. Lightly sprinkle with salt and pepper
and dredge in flour. Heat a large skillet and add the remaining olive
oil. Add several filets to the pan and cook 1 minute per side, then
remove. Repeat with the remaining filets. Place the fish in one layer
in a large roasting pan. Spread the tomato mixture over the top and
bake until the fish flakes with a fork and is cooked through, 5 to 7
minutes. Serve over the Basmati Rice Pilaf.</TE>

<LD>   Whittier</LD>
<TE>   DEAR ALICIA: Were they also the biggest? These pork chops are
huge, but not simple. They're all dressed up.</TE>
<TE>   Send requests to Culinary SOS, Food Section, Los Angeles Times,
202 W. 1st St., Los Angeles, CA 90012 or e-mail to:
cindy.dorn@latimes.com. Please include your last name and city of

<TE>   Jack Fry's Pork Chops</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 1 hour, 10 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 2
hours, 5 minutes</TE>
<TE>   ROSEMARY DIJON BUTTER</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, softened</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons fresh rosemary</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</TE>
<TE>   Thoroughly combine the butter, rosemary and mustard in a food
processor. Set aside 2 tablespoons and reserve the rest for another
use.</TE>
<TE>   BREADING</TE>
<TE>   2 cups fresh bread crumbs</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon chopped chives</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon chopped parsley</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh sage</TE>
<TE>   Combine the bread crumbs, rosemary, chives, parsley and sage in a
food processor.</TE>
<TE>   TOPPING</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon olive oil, divided</TE>
<TE>   5 new potatoes, quartered and blanched</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 onions, diced</TE>
<TE>   1 cup chicken stock</TE>
<TE>   16 cloves garlic, peeled and blanched</TE>
<TE>   3/4 pound fresh shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and sliced</TE>
<TE>   4 slices applewood-smoked bacon, diced</TE>
<TE>   8 spears asparagus, blanched and cut into 2-inch pieces</TE>
<TE>   Heat 1 teaspoon of oil in a large nonstick skillet over
medium-high heat and cook the potatoes, stirring often, until golden
brown and cooked through, 12 to 13 minutes. Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   In a large skillet, heat another teaspoon of oil. Add the sugar
and cook over high heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar
becomes dark brown like syrup. Add the onions and chicken stock and
cook until the liquid is reduced by half, 8 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in the same skillet used for the potatoes, heat 1/2
teaspoon of oil over medium-high heat and add the garlic. Cook until
golden brown, 2 1/2 minutes; remove the garlic and reserve.</TE>
<TE>   Add the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of oil to the skillet and cook the
mushrooms over medium-high heat until tender, 3 minutes. Remove and
set aside. Cook the bacon in the skillet over medium-high heat,
stirring, until crisp, 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels, reserving
the bacon fat in the skillet; set the skillet aside for the Vermouth
Sauce.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the potatoes, onion and stock mixture, the garlic,
mushrooms, bacon and asparagus in a large bowl. Set aside and keep
warm.</TE>
<TE>   VERMOUTH SAUCE</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon reserved bacon fat</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup dry vermouth</TE>
<TE>   3 cups chicken stock</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   Remove all but 1 tablespoon of bacon fat from the skillet and
reserve. Add the vermouth and cook over high heat, scraping up any
browned bits in the bottom of the skillet, until the vermouth is
reduced by half, 5 minutes. Add the chicken stock and rosemary and
cook until the liquid is reduced by half, 20 minutes. Add salt and
pepper to taste.</TE>
<TE>   PORK CHOPS</TE>
<TE>   4 (12-ounce) center-cut rib pork chops</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</TE>
<TE>   3/4 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon pepper</TE>
<TE>   Breading</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon reserved bacon fat</TE>
<TE>   Topping</TE>
<TE>   Vermouth Sauce</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons Rosemary Dijon Butter</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 375 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Brush the pork chops on both sides with the Dijon mustard. Season
with the salt and pepper. Coat the pork chops with the Breading.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the bacon fat in a large skillet over high heat and sear the
chops on both sides, working in 2 batches, if necessary, 1 1/2
minutes a side. Place on a jellyroll pan and bake until the internal
temperature of the chops reaches 160 degrees, 30 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Place the pork chops on serving plates and top with the warm
vegetable Topping. Deglaze the pork chop skillet with the Vermouth
Sauce over medium heat, scraping up any browned bits. Add the
Rosemary Dijon Butter, tilting and swirling the pan so that the
butter melts and the sauce thickens. Pour over the chops and serve.</TE>

<LD>DEAR SOS: I was born and raised in New York. I've not been able to
get a really good malted milk here. All I get is a thick shake with
malt powder added. The only time I get a good one is when I visit New
York.</LD>
<LD>   ADA ESTELA</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles</LD>
<TE>   DEAR ADA: I found recipes in our files for thick malted milk
shakes. Then I called Kevin McCafferey, the owner of Soda Jerks in
Pasadena. He said he thinks what you want is a New York malted, which
has the consistency of an egg cream. Here's his recipe.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York-Style Chocolate Malted</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 5 minutes</TE>
<TE>   For a vanilla malted milk, omit the chocolate syrup.</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups cold milk</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup vanilla ice cream</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup thick chocolate syrup</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon malted</TE>
<TE>   milk powder</TE>
<TE>   Combine the milk, ice cream, chocolate syrup and powder in a
blender and blend until smooth.</TE>

<LD>Coumadin patients--An Aug. 12 story in the Health section may have
given the impression that patients taking the powerful anticoagulant
Coumadin needn't worry about using ibuprofen or naproxen. Although
occasional use of ibuprofen or naproxen might not cause a problem for
a Coumadin patient, the combinations could still excessively thin the
blood. Anyone taking Coumadin is urged to consult a doctor or
pharmacist before taking additional prescription or over-the-counter
medications.</LD>

the Dodgers' pennant chances in 1934--"The Dodgers? Are they still in
the league?"--was made before the start of the 1934 season, not
during the pennant race, as was reported in a Sports story Tuesday on

<HD>A First-Class CEO's Worth? Whatever the Market Will Bear</HD>
<DH>Big taxes on big paychecks could help to rein in executive
greed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Limit compensation and perks for CEOs? Let's be careful here. We
don't want to find ourselves down the road with a weakened business
system, one that is further than ever from our root values.</LD>
<LD>   "Terribly bad social policy and perhaps even bad morals." That's
what the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said about
hyperinflated executive compensation. William J. McDonough,
reportedly a contender to replace Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, went
on to quote the Bible's admonition, "Love thy neighbor as thyself."
In other words, there's no excuse for the average CEO to pull down
475 times more money than the rank and file. He called on corporate
executives to get their greed under control.</LD>
<LD>   OK. If some CEOs and boards of directors throttle back with
bonuses and stock options, swell. And if institutional shareholders,
those with swag at corporate annual meetings, are successful in
bringing the interests of investors more in line with payouts to
CEOs, great. If Congress can muster the guts to make stock options
and perks, like company-paid $6,000 shower curtains, appear on
earnings reports, it's about time.</LD>
<TE>   But hang on, dear readers: To "love thy neighbor as thyself" means
CEOs too.</TE>
<TE>   What am I driving at? This: Payback is sweet right up to the point
when it becomes ugly. Taken too far, and U.S. politics is no stranger
to that impulse, we all wind up worse off.</TE>
<TE>   McDonough's exhortation is being one-upped by those who want to go
further and, lynch mob-like, impose limits on executive compensation.
Time to pause and catch our breath.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, such a proposition doesn't have a prayer of
succeeding. In a market economy, the one thing we know beyond doubt
is that the supply of creative loopholes always grows to meet demand.</TE>
<TE>   But there's a better reason to keep our cool when our blood runs
hot. A generation ago, I watched as an anti-government mood took hold
in the nation, not unlike the anti-business attitudes developing now.
The Vietnam War, the credibility gap, welfare giveaways--everyone
found a reason to doubt government and those who served in it.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, excesses and aberrations in government were brought under
rein.  But deeper down, the nation suffered. Today, the best among us
no longer consider public service a noble calling. The result: Look
at the pipsqueaks in our city halls, state legislatures, in Congress
and elsewhere. The idea that government is us, not them, faded. Voter
participation correspondingly declined. Cynicism replaced civic
engagement as we contemplated the future of the country. No reason
now to repeat the mistake with business. We don't want to drive good
people away from corporate America. Today's headlines prove that we
dearly need the converse.</TE>
<TE>   So, yes, our newfound intolerance for corporate lawbreakers is
overdue. Our frustration with the cozy cronyism of boardrooms, Wall
Street and political campaigns is solidly founded. The affronts of
executives who cast workers to the wolves for the sake of building
luxury worlds for themselves should not be tolerated.</TE>
<TE>   We can also lament that Washington's response to the corporate
scandals has been to make business law even more complicated, instead
of more straightforward.</TE>
<TE>   But taking the next step and trying to limit how much someone is
paid or what perks they receive is not American and not in the best
interest of Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Who is to say that the men and women who manage our industries are
not as valuable as the rookie NFL player signed for $10 million? Or
the actor who pockets $20 million per picture plus a cut of the
gross?</TE>
<TE>   Fact is, runaway greed has infected our culture, not just our
corporations. It has cast a pall on athletes and entertainers the
same as CEOs. Worst of all, it has undermined the ideal under which
our nation has prospered for most of its history: that hard work
brings just rewards.</TE>
<TE>   What to do? Simple, profound: A progressive tax code dampens
greed. It affects CEOs the same as baseball players, lottery winners,
Hollywood stars and those who live off trust funds. Each additional
increment of earnings is taxed at a higher rate, progressively
reducing the incentive to focus single-mindedly on money.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the top income tax bracket is 38.6%, on its way down to
35%. We need only look back a few decades to see the merits of the
opposite approach. From 1950 to 1963, the income tax rate exceeded
90% for every dollar earned over $400,000.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't a perfect era, but Elvis Presley didn't stop singing. He
lived quite flamboyantly. Mickey Mantle didn't stop swinging;
baseball was in fact a better game. General Motors set a record for
corporate profits. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange finally
rebounded from the Depression. Philanthropy reached new heights, the
social safety net was enlarged and wages grew. University researchers
under Jonas Salk discovered a vaccine to prevent polio.</TE>
<TE>   There was still plenty of incentive, lots of enterprise, leaps
forward in innovation. And less argument about when enough was too
much.</TE>

<HD>Iraq's 'Yes' Isn't Quite Good Enough</HD>
<DH>Washington must build support for specific demands.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHILIP H. GORDON and MICHAEL O'HANLON</AU>
<BD> Philip H. Gordon and Michael O'Hanlon are senior
fellows at the Brookings Institution.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Was Monday's decision by Iraq to readmit U.N. weapons inspectors,
without preconditions, a good thing or a bad thing?</LD>
<LD>   Optimists will say that inspections did uncover and destroy many
of Saddam Hussein's illicit weapons in the 1990s and that a
continuation of inspections and deterrence is preferable to a major
war. Critics of the idea will worry that Hussein is just promising
inspections to stall our march to war and that he will obstruct the
work of inspectors once the threat of a U.S. invasion recedes.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, it is too soon to know whether the Bush administration
has achieved a success. It has at least managed to make the threat of
war real enough to convince Hussein to soften his blustery stance.
But no Iraqi disarmament has occurred, and none is guaranteed.</LD>
<TE>   Moreover, Hussein outmaneuvered the administration this week,
accepting a relatively lenient set of demands based on the existing
U.N. Security Council Resolution 1284 before the United States could
work with other countries to develop a new and tougher resolution
linked to the threat of force. Because virtually all U.S. allies
would prefer even a flawed inspection process to war, the
administration's job of crafting an ultimatum that enjoys
international support is now more difficult. Russia has already
challenged the notion that a new resolution is necessary at this
point.</TE>
<TE>   The good news is that the administration still should be able to
recover. Specifically, it should be able to lead the international
community in crafting a Security Council resolution that toughens the
1999 U.N. Resolution 1284--which made some sanctions relief
contingent on Iraqi cooperation with weapons inspectors, rather than
complete disarmament. The U.S. needs to keep arguing that Iraqi
disarmament, rather than inspections per se, is the core demand that
must be met before the lifting of sanctions can be considered. It
needs to get the rest of the world behind this view. And it needs a
new and stronger resolution to formally remind Hussein of the
consequences of noncompliance.</TE>
<TE>   A new resolution must insist, of course, that Iraq readmit weapons
inspectors, fully support their work and ensure their immediate
access to any and all sites--including presidential palaces and
compounds.</TE>
<TE>   The United Nations must have exclusive prerogative to determine
the composition of inspection teams and be able to immediately grant
asylum to Iraqi weapons experts and their families should they
provide information to the U.N. that could put their lives at risk.</TE>
<TE>   The resolution also must demand that Iraq vigorously start the
disarmament process. It must account for, display and allow U.N.
destruction of certain stocks of chemical and biological weapons and
munitions that we know it possesses.</TE>
<TE>   It must do all this within a short, specific period.</TE>
<TE>   Looking to the longer term, Iraq must agree to intrusive,
long-term monitoring of its weapons capabilities. These demands are
already found in existing resolutions, but they need to be spelled
out.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, the international community needs the right to
demand no-notice inspections whenever and wherever it wishes, even if
sanctions against Iraq are lifted someday.</TE>
<TE>   Restrictions will have to remain on Iraq's oil revenue, and
industrial countries will have to establish rules for controlling
Baghdad's importing of potentially dangerous technologies.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. also needs to hold separate talks with Iraq's neighbors.
Because these countries would all prefer to avoid a U.S. invasion of
Iraq, they need to agree to stop their illicit trade with that
nation--by which oil comes out and many goods, including weapons and
dual-use technology, enter Iraq. This would require detailed
negotiations with Jordan, Turkey, Syria and perhaps even Iran,
including consideration of some combination of economic incentives
and strong pressure that would depend in its details on the country
in question.</TE>
<TE>   These demands are tough, but they are also specific and focused on
Iraq's weapons rather than its internal political practices. They are
far from unreasonable, as U.S. allies should recognize. And yet they
also create an ultimatum tough enough that allows us to take yes for
an answer from the Iraqi regime. At the moment, Iraq's yes is not
quite good enough.</TE>

<HD>The Artists Decide to Punt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Laguna Beach Artists seldom won on the football field, but you
had to love them for their moniker.</LD>
<LD>   No one could claim that this high school's nickname belittled
Native Americans (the rap on the Indians and Braves) or glorified
religion-based war atrocities (the Crusaders). It didn't chase after
the qualities of four-footed carnivores. No, Artists was a name for a
school and kids who were daringly different, for football players who
weren't afraid to show their sensitive side. It was a label devoid of
aggressive overtones, and therein lay the problem. As one out-of-town
athletic director put it, "There isn't a whole lot of fear struck
into your opponents by a name like that."</LD>
<LD>   Tired of the oh-so-mature taunts the name tended to evoke from
their adolescent opponents on the field, Laguna Beach's teenagers
voted to dump the Artists label, that ages-old nod to the pretty
city's rep as an artists' colony of sorts. They became the Breakers,
the school's original nickname for a couple of years in the 1930s.
It's an appropriate name for a school with a white-water view, though
read another way it has a threatening quality. (Just what is it
you're intending to break, oh gentle former Artists?)</LD>
<TE>   The vote made for a nice exercise in democratic action and student
empowerment, even though it miffed Pacific Grove High, near Monterey,
Calif., which swears it has held claim on the Breakers mascot since
the 1890s. "Don't we have a copyright or something?" the school's
athletic director jokingly growled.</TE>
<TE>   The editor of the Cal-Hi Sports Record Book vows to drop Laguna
Beach from the almanac's list of most fitting and original team
labels. "Oh, brother," Mark Tennis moaned over the Artists name being
ditched because of its namby-pamby image. He's an admirer of the Los
Angeles Ribet Academy's Fighting Frogs, and who can blame him?</TE>
<TE>   After all, pro football Hall of Famer George Allen wasn't afraid
to coach the Whittier College Poets, and it isn't pretty to
contemplate what the iconoclastic coach would have said to any
receiver who whined about being teased by the other team. Nor does
Whittier think of changing its team name, persevering in its belief
that the pen is mightier than the tight end.</TE>
<TE>   Being different isn't an admired quality during adolescence, that
period of stringent conformity. It takes on greater resonance in
college, where you're more likely to see names like the UC Santa Cruz
Banana Slugs and the UC Irvine Anteaters, with their endearing
animalistic chant of "Zot! Zot!" At some point in life, whimsy wins
out over toughness.</TE>
<TE>   But for now, Breakers, go forth this season and whup 'em.</TE>

<LD>"It sounded like the city blew up," a resident of the Texas Gulf
Coast town of Freeport told a TV reporter after a blast there Friday
rocked buildings and blew out windows nearly 50 miles away. The
explosion was another in a series of reminders about two threats that
Americans face in the age of terrorism: hazardous chemicals and a
government that thinks information is hazardous to citizens.</LD>
<LD>   In Freeport, sheriff's deputies would say only that an explosion
had occurred at a chemical company and people should stay indoors.
Residents finally figured out that the explosion had occurred at a
BASF nylon manufacturing plant. A recorded message there confirmed
the blast but gave no details.</LD>
<LD>   Plant officials took their time filling in the critical blanks.
So, for hours, anxious residents had no clue they were being exposed
to potentially toxic ammonia and cyclohexanone oxime, released when
an overheated rail car blew up outside the plant.</LD>
<TE>   People living near the nation's chemical plants and the rail lines
and highways connecting them need protections from dangerous
chemicals, whether released by accident or murderous fanatics. But
contrary to the Bush administration's paternalistic posturing and the
chemical industry's proprietary demands, keeping people in the dark
about the risks around them only makes matters worse.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) should address this
two-part problem head-on by amending the homeland security bill
(whose language will be finalized today) with a provision by Sen. Jon
Corzine (D-N.J.). It would beef up security at plants containing
hazardous chemicals while guaranteeing the public the right to such
basic information as which chemicals are there.</TE>
<TE>   Two months ago, a Senate committee passed the Corzine bill in a
19-0 vote. Then, with an audacity that is incredible in light of
recent chemical mishaps, the industry began lobbying Senate leaders
to kill the bill before today's vote.</TE>
<TE>   The Corzine bill, as carefully amended, requires chemical plants
to assess their vulnerability to accidents and terrorist attacks,
compels them to take measures to reduce that vulnerability and
requires them to make public a basic outline of their risk
assessments (with sensible exemptions to protect trade secrets and
thwart terrorists).</TE>
<TE>   Chemical companies contend that disclosing any information would
end up benefiting terrorists. And the Bush administration, with a
penchant for secrecy that predates last year's terror attacks, seems
to view as mere annoyances such critical tools of democracy as the
Freedom of Information Act.</TE>
<TE>   But Corzine's bill strikes a common-sense balance between security
imperatives and democratic freedoms: in this case, a plant's interest
in avoiding sabotage versus people's right to information that would
let them lobby for environmental safeguards or make important
decisions--such as when it's OK to let a child play outdoors.</TE>

<LD>Shareholders should learn about perks and benefits granted to top
executives through Securities and Exchange Commission filings, not
from leaks during a messy divorce. So should federal regulators, who
Monday began investigating the eye-popping post-retirement package
that General Electric granted to long-time Chief Executive Jack
Welch.</LD>
<LD>   GE easily could have avoided the public relations fiasco that
erupted after divorce documents of Welch's wife disclosed details of
GE's reported largess. In 1996, at about the time GE's corporate
board was readying Welch's compensation package, directors swatted
down a Teamsters proposal to tie compensation to published formulas
and submit packages to shareholder votes.</LD>
<LD>   Six years later, organized labor has a strange bedfellow in the
Conference Board, a business think tank that Tuesday scolded
corporate America for creating conditions ripe for a continuing
string of corporate scandals.</LD>
<TE>   The respected executives, investment fund directors and former
government officials who wrote the report called for all publicly
traded companies to expense stock options, fully disclose benefit
packages to shareholders and link compensation plans to long-term
corporate goals rather than to the quarterly stock price. And they
went a welcome step further by suggesting that companies alert
shareholders before their executives sell stock in their company.</TE>
<TE>   Welch clearly isn't cut from the same cloth as those who've
ransacked Enron and other bankrupt companies. But "Neutron Jack"
earned $16.7 million during his last year on the job and his net
worth reportedly tops $900 million. Yet, board members granted the
retiree access to corporate jets, use of a New York apartment and
tickets to professional sports contests.</TE>
<TE>   SEC investigators must determine whether GE accurately reported
those perks and benefits. But investigations wouldn't be necessary if
corporate boards did what the Conference Board is
demanding--explaining pay plans not only "in plain English, but in
plain sight as well."</TE>
<TE>   Corporations should be free to concoct whatever executive pay
formulas they desire--500 times what the lowest-paid production
worker takes home or triple what Texas Ranger shortstop Alex
Rodriguez earns during a season. But extravagant compensation
packages usually run counter to shareholder interests. They must be
explained upfront, and clearly, so investors know how a company is
spending their money.</TE>

<HD>Why the Sudden Rush to Go to War With Iraq?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Our current administration is determined to start a war with Iraq.
President Bush has said that we really don't care what the rest of
the world thinks, we will attack regardless. According to polls, more
than 60% of the American people support this. A war with Iraq is
wrong for so many reasons.</LD>
<LD>   It's morally wrong to preemptively attack a country. Why Iraq and
why now? We didn't attack the Soviet Union when it was our enemy and
had nuclear weapons. It is going to stir up ill feelings toward
Americans all across the Arab world and probably increase the
incidents of terrorism against us, giving us a further reason to
escalate our attacks. There will be many casualties if we start a
ground war. This one won't be over in two months. Our young men will
die. Many innocent Iraqis will die. I weep for my country.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Iraq Says a U.N. Team Can Return; U.S. Dismisses Offer," Sept.
17: I am confused. President Bush goes before the U.N. and demands
action. He demands that the U.N. enforce previous resolutions with
respect to weapons inspections. The Iraqi government responds by
indicating that it is ready to welcome U.N. weapons inspectors
unconditionally. Yet the U.S. immediately dismisses this response as
inadequate.</TE>
<TE>   Are we being a little premature here? Are we relying strictly on
Iraq's past behavior to form current strategic policy? Are we focused
on just one option, the option of war? Should we not at least test
the integrity and truthfulness of Iraq's response before we condemn
it as being "too little, too late"? Are we in such a rush to go to
war?</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Stein</TE>

<TE>   For inspections in Iraq to be successful, any site that is said to
be off limits to the inspectors must become a target for cruise
missiles within three hours.</TE>

<TE>   Bush calls for action on Iraq. What is the rush? People who have
visited the country report that the infrastructure is devastated by
years of sanctions and intermittent bombings. Bush's countrymen are
suffering from lack of basic health care and quality education and
the country is de facto bankrupt--yet he keeps repeating this mantra
of how dangerous Saddam Hussein is and that we need to pour billions
of dollars into destroying Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Bombing Afghanistan did not bring terrorists to justice--patience,
diplomacy, cooperation and following international laws do that. I
strongly question the motives behind this push for military actions
against Iraq. Congress and the Senate should do the same.</TE>

squandering of our freedom." We should heed these words today.</TE>

<LD>I'm not sure what is more disgusting, the creators, actors and
industry that feeds off shows like "The Sopranos" or the sheep who
watch these shows (" 'Sopranos' Staying Hip Amid Hype," Sept. 15).
Imagine these scenarios: The intimate lives of Nazis in
thousand-dollar suits with the soundtrack of "Ode to Joy" in the
background. How about a Crips gang member agonizing over having to
whack a Blood who was a childhood pal while Barry White croons in the
background? How about an Irish or Cuban family that controls the
criminal enterprises along with the unions of an American city and
will break the arms of immigrants who refuse to pay them a weekly
service fee, which is exactly how the Mafia became entrenched in
America? This show makes you wonder if maybe the radicals who hate
American culture don't perhaps have some kind of a point.</LD>

<LD>After 61 years, the nation still remembers Pearl Harbor.
Sixty-one-plus years from now, it will still remember Sept. 11.
Weeks-long coverage by the media either numbs us to the tragedy or
prolongs the pain. To set aside one day each year to pay solemn
homage to those events and their heroes is appropriate and
sufficient. Just as with a death in the family, we as a nation must
muster the courage to get on with our lives, wherever that path may
lead.</LD>

<LD>Re "Florida Is Gripped by Terrorist Scare," Sept. 14: Perhaps Eunice
Stone did hear two Arab Americans and a foreign student making joking
remarks about 9/11 and commenting about a potential attack on Sept.
13. Perhaps she made the whole thing up. Regardless, our justice
system prevailed. The men were cleared of wrongdoing by the
authorities and sent on their way. If they did make the remarks in
question, they should expect to suffer the consequences of their
hateful and inappropriate speech. If Stone made the whole thing up,
she should suffer the legal consequences. Accusing people based
solely on the way they look is inexcusable in our democracy.</LD>
<LD>   If Stone did accurately report what they said, she was correct in
reporting them to the authorities, and the three paid a small price:
17 hours of police interrogation and loss of their medical school
internships (Sept. 16). We all should be mindful of the consequences
for inappropriate speech, even remarks made in jest, like joking
about having a gun in the line at airport security, in these troubled
times. I fear the biggest casualty will be our own loss of vigilance
in reporting real potential threats as the memory of 9/11 fades.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shame on Larkin Community Hospital--and let's give respect to the
three Muslim medical students who were to complete internships there.
How could hospital President Dr. Jack Michel have the nerve to ask
these three students to transfer somewhere else? After what Kambiz
Butt, Ayman Gheith and Omar Choudhary have been through, why must
Michel add to their hardship?</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the answer lies in the numerous anti-Muslim threats the
hospital has received over the past few days. The answer lies in the
continuing racial bigotry that mars our country. Until we shed this
mistrust of all Muslims that obviously pervades the U.S.,
embarrassments like the Alligator Alley episode will continue to sap
credibility from our international efforts and brand this country as
a haven for bigots. This change can only work one open mind at a
time.</TE>

<LD>With his remarkable West Bank concert, famed pianist Daniel Barenboim
has crossed a divide impossible to traverse thus far by efforts
toward a peace process ("World-Class Pianist Forges a Link for Peace
in Mideast," Sept. 11). If an audience of Palestinians can come
together and share common ground with Israeli Barenboim, might not
the heads of state, politicians and diplomats do so as well? Share
common ground, that is. Because, literally, isn't that what this
conflict is all about? Kudos to Mr. Barenboim.</LD>

<LD>Re the Sept. 13 letter from Dominick Rubalcava on the L.A. Department
of Water and Power's "commitment" to the Owens Valley, please
remember that this commitment is still to take every drop of water
possible. No significant DWP environmental project in the Owens
Valley came voluntarily. Only litigation or its threat has caused
change. Locally, for 90 years, we have attempted negotiation, with
little result except more delay.</LD>
<LD>   The lower Owens River re-watering is for damage started in 1970.
How long should we wait? On Sept. 12, Judge Edward Denton of the Inyo
Superior Court ordered that the DWP complete by Nov. 1 the draft
environmental impact report for the re-watering of the lower Owens
River. If not met, court sanctions will be considered. Rubalcava's
offer of a smaller pump-back station on the river, after agreeing to
it in the long-term water agreement, is akin to offering to give back
something stolen if the victim will pay money (water).</LD>
<LD>   Rubalcava is correct in saying that L.A. has conserved more water
than probably any other city, and for that we thank the citizens of
L.A., who own these lands that we all care about.</LD>
<TE>   Michael Prather</TE>
<TE>   President, Owens Valley</TE>
<TE>   Committee, Lone Pine</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles does not act as if it is truly committed to
environmental restoration of the Owens Valley. Commitments for
environmental restoration were made by the city in the Inyo-L.A.
water agreement, the city's 1991 EIR on groundwater pumping and a
1997 memorandum of understanding with Inyo County and other parties,
including the Sierra Club. Is the city really committed to these
agreements that ended 25 years of litigation?</TE>
<TE>   More than five years after the agreements have taken effect,
little has been done to restore mitigation project sites. Restoration
work at Hines Spring and re-greening projects in Big Pine and
Independence have not been started. The Big Pine ditch system is
still dry. Hundreds of acres in Laws have not been irrigated, in
direct violation of the water agreement. Nearly every environmental
study the city promised in the 1997 memorandum has been late.</TE>
<TE>   The Sierra Club and other parties to the 1997 memorandum believe
that the larger pump station violates the water agreement and would
restrict flows to the delta that are necessary to meet habitat goals
agreed to in the memorandum. The larger pump station does not make
sense economically. It will cost more than it returns to the city
unless its real purpose is to export additional ground water from the
Owens Valley.</TE>

<LD>Re "Bilingual Issue Drives Recall Battle," Sept. 15: Three cheers to
Francisco Gonzalez for his brave fight to have his children learn
English in the public schools. It seems that the real racists and
"anti-immigrants" are people like Santa Ana Unified School District
Trustee Nativo Lopez who are depriving Latino children of their right
to become fluent in English. Lopez's statement that the recall group
espouses "nativism ... based on racism and negativism" by implying
that "English is superior to Spanish" is dangerously divisive and
irresponsible.</LD>
<LD>   Just as Spanish is the unifying language of Mexico and Central
America and is necessary for success in those regions, so English is
the language of the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Depriving immigrant children of their right to become fluent in
English dooms them to a life of failure and second-class status.</LD>
<TE>   Exactly what rights and services is Hermandad Mexicana Nacional
lobbying for if not the right of immigrants to succeed in achieving
the American dream? Why else would immigrants have come to this

<HD>George Daniell, 91; Portrait Photographer and Watercolor
Artist</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>George Daniell, 91, a photographer best known for his black-and-white
portraits of actors, artists and writers, died Saturday in Bar
Harbor, Maine, of complications from a stroke. He had been partially
disabled by a stroke in 1988.</LD>
<LD>   Also a painter, Daniell studied drawing at Yale University and New
York's American People's School and Art Students League. He began
taking photographs as a teenager in his native Yonkers, N.Y., and,
after graduating from college, became a freelance photographer in New
York City and Europe. His work appeared over the years in Time and
Life magazines, among others, and is represented in the collections
of the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the National Gallery in
Washington.</LD>
<LD>   Daniell photographed celebrities as and where he found them in his
travels about the United States and Europe: a young Sophia Loren in a
Rome movie studio, Audrey Hepburn on the set of "War and Peace,"
Tennessee Williams in Key West, Fla., Georgia O'Keeffe on her Ghost
Ranch in New Mexico, and W.H. Auden smoking a cigarette and lounging
in a doorway on the Italian island of Ischia. He called Loren "the
most beautiful woman I've ever seen," and O'Keeffe "very nice and
very warm" but an artist treasuring her privacy.</LD>
<TE>   After Daniell moved to Trenton, Maine, in 1960, he spent more time
painting than photographing. Daniell excelled in watercolors and his
subjects ranged from the gay culture of New York's Fire Island, where
he spent his youth, to Maine coastal life, nudes on beaches and still
lifes of lobster, fruit and flowers.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, he also enjoyed writing.</TE>

<HD>Aaron Danzig, 89; Lawyer in Landmark Railroad Negligence
Suit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Aaron Danzig, 89, a lawyer who argued against the Erie Railroad Co.
in a negligence lawsuit that became a landmark U.S. Supreme Court
case, died Sept. 10 in New York City.</LD>
<LD>   In the 1938 case Erie Railroad Co. vs. Tompkins, Danzig
represented a man whose arm was severed in a railroad accident in
Pennsylvania. In the case, Pennsylvania law required proof of willful
or wanton negligence on the part of the railroad for an accident
victim to collect damages.</LD>
<LD>   So Danzig chose to bring suit in federal court, where a looser
definition of negligence was found in prior federal decisions. A
federal jury awarded his client $30,000, and the railroad appealed
all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.</LD>
<TE>   The justices sided with the railroad. In the decision, Justice
Louis D. Brandeis rejected the concept of federal common law, or law
based on previous court rulings. Brandeis reasoned that federal
courts must apply state law in civil cases, except when those laws
conflict with an act of Congress or the Constitution. The case
resulted in a significant shift of power to state courts and helped
discourage court shopping by litigants.</TE>
<TE>   Danzig was born in Newark, N.J., and graduated from Columbia
College in 1933. He received his law degree from Columbia in 1935.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court decision in the Erie Railroad case forced his
company, which had been working on a contingency basis, out of
business. He later formed Nemeroff, Jelline, Danzig &amp; Paley, which
specialized in corporate law.</TE>

<LD>Charles M. Denton, 78, a veteran San Francisco Examiner columnist,
author and publicist, died Sunday in Tiburon, Calif., after a heart
attack.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Glendale, Denton served in the Navy during World War II,
graduated from USC and began his career in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   From 1949 until he moved to San Francisco in 1963, he worked as a
reporter and columnist successively for United Press, International
News Service, the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner and briefly for the Los
Angeles Times. He served as president of the Greater Los Angeles
Press Club from 1955 to 1957.</LD>
<TE>   In 1963, Denton was hired by the then-Hearst-owned San Francisco
Examiner to compete with the San Francisco Chronicle's popular
columnist, the late Herb Caen. As a displaced Southern Californian,
Denton attracted readers for five years with his humorous accounts of
discovering the City by the Bay.</TE>
<TE>   In 1968, he left news journalism for corporate publicity, heading
communications for the Leslie Salt Co. and Crown Zellerbach before
becoming a vice president of the public relations firm Hill and
Knowlton.</TE>
<TE>   Denton was coauthor of the book "A Matter of Life" and wrote
television scripts and plays as well as numerous articles for such

<HD>AOL Board May Not Have Votes for Ouster</HD>
<DH>Media: Some company directors have been lobbying to remove
Steve Case, sources say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN and SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Company directors unhappy with AOL Time Warner Inc. Chairman Stephen
M. Case appear to lack the support needed to oust him at Thursday's
regularly scheduled board meeting, people close to several directors
said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Vice Chairman Ted Turner, the largest individual shareholder and
thus the biggest loser in AOL Time Warner's ongoing stock slide, has
indicated he would support removing Case but does not plan to
spearhead such an effort, one source close to him said. Last year,
Turner played an instrumental role in the campaign to push out AOL
Time Warner Chief Executive Gerald M. Levin, sources said. Levin,
along with Case, orchestrated the January 2001 merger that created
the world's biggest media company.</LD>
<LD>   "There is no substance to it," AOL Time Warner spokesman Ed Adler
said about reports that Case is on his way out.</LD>
<TE>   However, some board members have been lobbying hard behind the
scenes to force out Case, and could even push for a vote on his
status at the board meeting to embarrass Case and pressure him to
resign, said sources close to some AOL Time Warner directors. Among
the directors said to be leading the anti-Case campaign are Stephen
F. Bollenbach, chief executive of Hilton Hotels Corp., and Francis T.
"Fay" Vincent Jr., a former major league baseball commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   Vincent declined to comment, saying it was inappropriate for
directors to discuss company business before a board meeting, and
Bollenbach did not return a telephone call seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Bollenbach and Vincent have the backing of some of AOL Time
Warner's largest institutional shareholders, sources said, including
Capital Research Group, which was the biggest AOL Time Warner
investor on record as of June. Sources said that Capital's Los
Angeles-based media money manager, Gordon Crawford, more than doubled
his stake in AOL Time Warner this spring and summer, and that he is
working to unseat Case.</TE>
<TE>   Crawford was one of the biggest boosters of the America Online and
Time Warner marriage when it was announced. Crawford's firm now holds
an 8% stake. By comparison, Turner owns about 3% of AOL Time Warner
shares while Case holds less than 1%.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street analysts acknowledge that another management shakeup
at AOL Time Warner would be jarring.</TE>
<TE>   Of the three executives most closely identified with the merger,
only Case remains. Levin, former chairman of Time Warner and chief
executive of the combined company, resigned under pressure last
spring. Robert W. Pittman, former chief executive of America Online
and co-chief operating officer after the merger, resigned in July.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive Richard D. Parsons, who took over from Levin in
May, repeatedly has voiced his support for Case, saying he remains a
valued advisor on company strategy.</TE>
<TE>   If Case departed, analysts said, Parsons could assume the
additional role of chairman, although some investors favor a current
board member assuming that post. Turner would be an obvious
candidate, although he is considered by some board members to be too
volatile.</TE>
<TE>   But the sentiment toward Case on Wall Street is by no means
unanimous.</TE>
<TE>   "If they're going to get that much brainpower in one room on
Thursday, I'd like to see them do something that contributes to
earnings," said Henry Asher, president of Northstar Group, a
Manhattan investment firm that owns AOL Time Warner shares.</TE>
<TE>   Many disgruntled shareholders of the former Time Warner Inc. blame
Case for hyping the benefits of the January 2001 merger when he was
chairman of America Online.</TE>
<TE>   The popular Internet service was supposed to fuel tremendous
profit growth by giving Time Warner's established but staid
brands--including Warner Bros. Studios, Warner Music, Turner
Broadcasting and the Time Inc. magazines--exciting new exposure in
the online world.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the merger has been a fizzle for stockholders. AOL Time
Warner's shares have plunged more than 70% since the merger, as
Internet advertising has all but evaporated and the growth of
subscriptions to the online community has slowed sharply. AOL Time
Warner's shares closed Tuesday at $12.58, down 9 cents, on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Worse, the company is the target of a federal criminal
investigation and a barrage of shareholder lawsuits. The Justice
Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are
investigating allegations that America Online used questionable
advertising transactions to falsely boost its sales and profit.</TE>
<TE>   While denying wrongdoing, AOL Time Warner last month announced
that it had identified three transactions in which the Internet unit
had "inappropriately" booked ad revenue totaling $49 million.</TE>
<TE>   Under the AOL Time Warner bylaws, replacing a chairman requires a
three-fourths vote of the board, or at least 11 of the 14 members.
The anti-Case forces do not appear to have enough votes to dismiss
him, say people familiar with the board's thinking.</TE>
<TE>   The board is evenly divided between former Time Warner and AOL
directors. Parsons, Turner, Bollenbach and Vincent come from the Time
Warner side of the merger. Other directors sharing that pedigree are
Carla Anderson Hills, former U.S. trade representative; Reuben Mark,
chairman and chief executive of Colgate-Palmolive Co.; and Michael A.
Miles, former chairman of Philip Morris Cos.</TE>
<TE>   The directors with America Online roots, besides Case, are Daniel
F. Akerson, chairman of XO Communications Inc.; James L. Barksdale,
former chairman of Netscape Communications Co., now owned by AOL Time
Warner; Frank J. Caulfield, a general partner in venture capital firm
Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers; Miles R. Gilburne, a principal of
ZG Ventures, also a venture capital firm; Kenneth J. Novack, vice
chairman of AOL Time Warner; and Franklin D. Raines, chairman of
Fannie Mae.</TE>
<TE>   Sources say several of the AOL directors are waffling in their
support of Case, including Barksdale.</TE>
<TE>   Company directors did not return calls for comment Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph E. Stocke, managing director of Stoneridge Investment
Partners, a Malvern, Pa., firm holding about 1 million AOL Time
Warner shares, said that while ousting Case might remove "some of the
taint" from the company, Case's expertise in building America Online
could still be of value to the company.</TE>

<HD>Arbitration Halt Frustrates Investors</HD>
<DH>Securities: Despite Pitt's attempt to end standoff, NASD
and NYSE haven't resumed hearings while they challenge new rules.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 500 investors complaining of fraud and mistreatment by
their stockbrokers still can't get a hearing in California, nearly
two weeks after Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L.
Pitt offered hope of ending an arbitration standoff.</LD>
<LD>   On July 1, a new state law governing ethical disclosures by
arbitrators handling investor complaints in California took effect.
The National Assn. of Securities Dealers and the New York Stock
Exchange are challenging the rules in a federal court in Oakland and
have brought a halt to arbitration hearings in California.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this month, Pitt told the groups to resume hearing
arbitration cases. Despite assurances of cooperation, hearings still
hadn't resumed this week, and Pitt repeated his request Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   Plaintiffs' attorneys and the state Judicial Council, which wrote
the rules at the direction of the Legislature, say they are losing
patience over the arbitration logjam.</TE>
<TE>   ''Twelve days after Pitt's letter [to the NYSE and NASD], I'm
still getting calls from California residents saying their lawyers
are telling them they have to go to Nevada" to resolve securities
disputes, said Gene Wong, chief counsel for the state Judicial
Council.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an outrage," said Vincent DiCarlo, a Sacramento attorney who
represents investors in arbitration proceedings. "There's no reason
they can't comply" with the state rules pending legal review.
Alternatively, DiCarlo said, brokerage firms faced with investor
complaints could allow the cases to be heard in courts.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute comes as public attention is focused on widespread
allegations of brokerage firm misconduct, including charges that
analysts, trying to win lucrative investment banking business for
their firms, publicly promoted stocks that they privately called
"dogs" and worse.</TE>
<TE>   In the most prominent of those analyst-conflict cases, New York
Atty. Gen Eliot Spitzer got the jump on Pitt and the SEC, winning a
$100-million settlement from Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Spitzer is
conducting a similar investigation of Citigroup Inc.'s Salomon Smith
Barney unit, and securities regulators in other states have formed a
task force to investigate additional allegations of misconduct in the
securities industry, which typically had been a province of the
federal government.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC said Tuesday that it would submit a "friend of the court"
brief in the case filed against the California rules, discussing its
obligation "to oversee a uniform national system for resolving
investor complaints."</TE>
<TE>   The SEC also said it would study whether California's disclosure
rules should be incorporated into national policy. It said it had
chosen Michael Perino, a visiting professor of securities law at
Columbia University, to determine whether NASD and NYSE rules need to
be modified.</TE>
<TE>   The California rules are cumbersome and costly, said Ray
Pellecchia, an NYSE spokesman. He said objectionable provisions
include an overly broad requirement that arbitrators disclose all
financial relationships that their family members have had with the
brokerage houses involved. The disclosure requirements are so broad
that they would encourage frivolous challenges to arbitrators, he
said, delaying hearings and multiplying their costs.</TE>
<TE>   Pellecchia and Nancy Condon, a spokeswoman for the NASD, said
discussions are underway with the SEC over a way to resolve the
arbitration standoff, but neither they nor the agency would
elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, some plaintiffs' attorneys have begun taking
clients out of state for arbitration hearings under the national
rules.</TE>
<TE>   "It's either that or sit around twiddling your thumbs, which we
can't do," said Timothy Karen, an attorney in Del Mar, Calif. Karen
said he was moving several cases involving millions of dollars of
losses, including allegations of analyst fraud, to Portland, Ore.</TE>

<HD>Delayed Vote of Project May Put Cadiz in Financial Bind</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL A. HILTZIK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A final vote by the Metropolitan Water District board on the
controversial Cadiz water storage project may not take place until
mid-January, district officials said Tuesday--a delay that could
heighten financial pressures on its corporate sponsor, Cadiz Inc.</LD>
<LD>   The MWD board's subcommittee on rules and ethics scheduled a
series of hearings and project reviews to take place through November
in preparation for a final board vote on the $150-million venture. At
least one board member observed that holiday schedules, among other
factors, could delay that vote until after December.</LD>
<LD>   The timing of the MWD vote is crucial to Cadiz, a publicly traded
company led by Keith Brackpool, an advisor to Gov. Gray Davis on
state water issues. Cadiz stands to see as much as $1 billion in
revenue over 50 years from the project, which includes plans to store
up to 1.5 million acre-feet of surplus Colorado River water in a
Mojave Desert aquifer underlying company-owned land.</LD>
<TE>   But Cadiz, which has never turned an annual profit and currently
records almost all its revenue from agriculture in the San Joaquin
Valley, faces the expiration or maturation of about $64 million in
debt by Jan. 30. In the past, these credit lines have been extended
by lenders but generally at higher rates.</TE>
<TE>   Under the terms of one loan, Cadiz's foreign bank--ING
Baring--could obtain more than 1.3 million Cadiz shares for a nominal
fee if the loan is not repaid by Jan. 30, according to company
documents. That would give Baring and its affiliates about a 10%
share of Cadiz.</TE>
<TE>   The Mojave project has been held up for years by environmental
concerns about plans to extract an additional 1.5 million acre-feet
of water from the aquifer.</TE>
<TE>   Cadiz did not reply to a request for comment on the MWD meeting.
Its shares rose 21 cents to $4.31 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi Awaiting Diller's Next Move</HD>
<DH>Strategy for entertainment unit could hinge on whether
studio mogul agrees to take lead role</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CORIE BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The future of one of the world's biggest entertainment companies is
being held up by one man--and he seems in no hurry to let it move
forward.</LD>
<LD>   Barry Diller, long known as one of Hollywood's shrewdest
executives, has emerged as the key to what shape Vivendi Universal's
entertainment operation will take in the months ahead, according to
sources close to the company and Diller.</LD>
<LD>   The French chief executive of Vivendi, Jean-Rene Fourtou, wants
Diller to assume an important leadership role in the entertainment
division if it is spun off into a separate public company.</LD>
<TE>   Diller already is president of Vivendi Universal Entertainment,
and Fourtou envisions keeping him as part of the spinoff. The
thinking is that Diller's stature would bring instant credibility to
any new media company, while allowing the Paris-based conglomerate to
pull back from the front lines of movie making, television and theme
parks.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, however, Diller's financial advisors are
counseling him to steer clear of taking on heightened
responsibilities at a revamped Vivendi. Instead, they're urging him
to stay focused on his primary business, USA Interactive Inc., which
owns Home Shopping Network, Ticketmaster and Expedia.com.</TE>
<TE>   Diller himself hasn't tipped his hand as to which way he is
leaning. Those close to him say he understands that USA Interactive
is a company on the rise and is increasingly demanding of his time.</TE>
<TE>   "Still," said one Diller advisor, "it's entirely possible that he
will look at the studio with romantic eyes."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, as Diller makes up his mind, Viviendi finds itself
stymied in its long-range planning. Sources close to Diller and
Vivendi say the company will not move ahead until it has either a
commitment or rejection from Diller.</TE>
<TE>   Diller and Vivendi declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Next week at a highly anticipated board meeting, Fourtou will
outline the assets Vivendi plans to sell to meet the approximately
$10-billion target he has set for paying off some of the company's
debt load. He also plans to announce a further reduction in Vivendi's
40% stake in Vivendi Environnement, the company's utility division,
as well as a loan of nearly $2 billion to help solve the
corporation's immediate cash crisis.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to Universal Entertainment, Fourtou does not have
the luxury of time either. The company's entertainment executives,
faced with the continuing uncertainty, already are exploring options
elsewhere, according to sources close to the company.</TE>
<TE>   "We've built some of the best management in Hollywood," a source
said. "It would be terrible to lose them, and you are going to if you
can't articulate a future they can believe in."</TE>
<TE>   One job Diller would be unlikely to consider is that of chief
executive because he already holds that post at USA Interactive. With
a 0.5% stake in USAI and 69.1% of the voting power, Diller's ego as
well as a personal fortune of $750 million is invested in the firm.</TE>
<TE>   At Vivendi Universal Entertainment, Diller receives no salary. He
was given a 1.5% stake in the division worth a minimum of $275
million. USAI was given a 5.44% stake in Vivendi Universal
Entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Diller rejected Universal Music Group as part of his unit, a
strategic move considering the dismal financial prospects for music
companies in the age of rampant Internet piracy.</TE>
<TE>   As long as Diller is considered a potential player in Vivendi,
investment bankers close to the company as well as company insiders
insist, the music company will remain a separate division.</TE>
<TE>   Diller's advisors are urging him not to invest time or money in
Vivendi's entertainment assets. One of them is Gordon Crawford,
senior vice president of Capital Research and Management, one of the
largest institutional investors in USAI.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Diller's longtime bankers at Allen &amp; Co. have not yet been
brought in to work on any Vivendi-related ventures.</TE>
<TE>   The media industry is considered a mature, slow-growth business,
said some of those advisors. There will be little financial upside to
owning a film and television studio for many years to come, they
said, noting the stark contrast with the huge potential Diller has as
the chairman and controlling shareholder of e-commerce company USAI.</TE>
<TE>   "The busted stock prices in media are a real problem," said one
investment banker. Management problems, not just at Vivendi but also
at Walt Disney Co. and AOL Time Warner Inc., have several companies
trying to spin off assets in a down market.</TE>
<TE>   To protect the value of USAI, Diller has repeatedly stated he
would not merge or involve his company.</TE>
<TE>   If so, Fourtou would consider merging Vivendi Universal
Entertainment with one or more strategic partners to create a new
media company, according to sources close to Vivendi.</TE>
<TE>   With Diller in a leading role, he would have the ability to wield
heavyweight influence in the media world. A force in that industry
since his days running Paramount Studios and then Twentieth Century
Fox, creating the Fox Broadcasting Network, Diller has long said he
would like to be a more influential player.</TE>
<TE>   Diller has said he believed that three or four media giants would
control the world's entertainment, information and electronic
commerce. He said he planned to be a major player in one of those
companies.</TE>
<TE>   Still, said one of Diller's closest associates, "I don't think he
is anywhere near making a decision about Vivendi."</TE>
<TE>   Any venture Diller touches would have cachet that the company's
French executives lack, said Wall Street sources. The U.S. financial
markets would value the venture more highly, the sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps more important, Diller would heighten interest across the
media industry, attracting more potential partners to the venture,
according to investment bankers familiar with Vivendi.</TE>
<TE>   "Diller is the ideal person to do something with," said one of the
bankers. "He could be an investor, the chairman, the guy who puts the
whole team together."</TE>
<TE>   Without Diller, Fourtou's options are limited. One strategy feared
by Hollywood insiders is that Vivendi would sell Universal's assets
to rival media companies interested in merging them with their
existing operations. That would leave the industry with one fewer
major studio.</TE>
<TE>   Already, Viacom Inc. and News Corp. have made inquiries, said one
investment banker working with Vivendi. Bargain-hunting private
equity firms such as Blackstone Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp;
Co. also are circling, hoping to pick off bits and pieces.</TE>
<TE>   At the board meeting next week, Vivendi will announce plans to
unload its Canal Plus Technologies unit, which makes pay-TV software,
to Thomson Multimedia for about $180 million.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi will sell its entire publishing division, both the French
publishing houses as well as Boston-based Houghton Mifflin Co., for
an expected $4 billion, say sources close to the company.</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou expects to raise an additional $2 billion with the sale of
Canal Plus' various non-French divisions, including the $1-billion
sale of its Italian pay-television company Telepui to Rupert
Murdoch's News Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Selling 51% of the remaining French Canal Plus in a public stock
offering would raise an additional $2 billion, a source said.
Vivendi's 10% interest in EchoStar along with the Moroccan telephone
company Maroc Telecom could raise another $2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Now if it could only figure out the future of its entertainment
properties.</TE>
<TE>   "Vivendi has had every possible future option spelled out for it,"
said one investment banker familiar with the extraordinary asset
review process that has taken place during the last two months. "The
next move is Diller's."</TE>

<HD>Industrial Output Off 0.3% in August</HD>
<DH>Economy: The decrease, which was unexpected, is the first
this year as firms make fewer automobiles, home electronics items and
appliances.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. industrial production unexpectedly dropped in August, the first
decrease this year, as companies made fewer autos, appliances and
home electronics products.</LD>
<LD>   Production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities fell
0.3% last month after rising a revised 0.4% in July, twice the rate
previously estimated, the Federal Reserve said.</LD>
<LD>   The last time production declined was in December.</LD>
<TE>   "The U.S. economy is losing momentum," said John Silvia, chief
economist at Wachovia Corp. "Businesses are finding out that there
just isn't any forward momentum in orders, and that means the economy
may be sloshing around for some time."</TE>
<TE>   Economists had expected a 0.2% rise in industrial production,
following July's previously reported 0.2% gain.</TE>
<TE>   The plant-use rate fell to 76% last month from 76.2%. That
compares with an average 81.8% rate during the record 10-year
expansion from March 1991 to March 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The low rate of capacity use suggests that businesses have plenty
of room to increase production without building more factories or
buying more equipment.</TE>
<TE>   A 2.5% drop in electric and gas utility production accounted for
much of the drop in the Fed's report and followed a 2.4% increase in
July. Output from mines increased 0.8% after falling 0.5%.</TE>
<TE>   Work at factories, which makes up about 90% of industrial
production, fell 0.1% last month, the first decline this year, after
increasing 0.3% in July.</TE>
<TE>   Production of consumer durable goods, which include automobiles,
furniture and electronics, fell 0.9% after increasing 2.1% the
previous month.</TE>
<TE>   Production of autos and parts fell 1.4% after rising 3.9%. Over
the last 12 months, production is up 12% as car and truck sales have
risen because of incentives.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   General Motors Corp. sales climbed 18% last month as zero-interest
loans and discounts helped clear out 2002 models. Sales by all auto
makers rose to an annual rate of 18.7 million, the fastest since
October.</TE>
<TE>   Production of business equipment, which includes communications
equipment, fell 0.4% last month after decreasing 0.3% in July.</TE>

<TE>   Manufacturers are producing less and are reducing their work
forces.</TE>
<TE>   Factories shed 68,000 jobs in August, the most since January.
Manufacturers are adding hours to employees' workweeks. The
manufacturing workweek rose to 40.8 hours from 40.7 in July, and the
average amount of worker overtime per week rose to 4.2 hours from 4
hours.</TE>
<TE>   Productivity is rising. Manufacturing efficiency rose 4.3% in the
second quarter, after increasing 9.7% in the first three months of
the year. The first-quarter gain was the largest since 1982.</TE>
<TE>   Improving productivity is one reason the economy is expected to
expand at a 2.7% annual pace in the third quarter, more than twice as
fast as the 1.1% growth rate of the previous three months.</TE>

<HD>Signing Bonuses for Execs Coming Under Scrutiny</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The latest aspect of executive pay to come under the microscope:
upfront payments to newly hired chief executives that are averaging
$15 million each, according to a study released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   These so-called golden hellos are a twist on the signing bonus,
which has been around for decades, said Paul Hodgson, senior research
associate at the Corporate Library, a Web site that tracks executive
compensation agreements. This is the first time the Corporate Library
has studied the upfront payments--now dubbed "inducement awards,"
"make-whole" payments or other names--but they appear to be getting
bigger and becoming more prevalent, said Hodgson, who wrote the
study.</LD>
<LD>   The study looked at 30 of the most recent signing bonuses, taken
from a database of 1,800 major U.S. companies. The upfront payments
averaged $15 million per CEO--ranging from $45 million paid to Gary
Wendt when he was hired by Conseco Inc. in 2000 to $150,000 paid to
Steve Odland in 2001 when he joined AutoZone Inc. Payments were made
in cash, stock, additional contributions to supplemental retirement
plans or in a combination of forms, Hodgson said.</LD>
<TE>   These upfront payments became common in the tight labor market of
the late 1990s and have flourished since.</TE>
<TE>   "This is part of the high-stakes game that we're in now," said
Robin Ferracone, partner in the Los Angeles compensation practice at
Mercer Human Resource Consulting. "This was in response to the tight
labor market, where companies determined that to wrest a CEO from his
or her former company, a large sign-on payment had to be paid."</TE>
<TE>   Hiring away a CEO is complicated by the long-term incentive plans
many executives enjoy. An executive who leaves early for another job
may be walking away from tens of millions of dollars, said Jack
Marsteller, practice leader for Towers Perrin's Los Angeles executive
compensation practice. Moreover, the executive also could be leaving
behind retirement and supplemental retirement benefits, restricted
stock and other expensive benefits.</TE>
<TE>   The prospect of losing those payments has forced companies to
either pay up or look for someone with less negotiating power.</TE>
<TE>   However, the practice of paying millions in cash or stock has
compensation critics saying that it's just another way executives get
preferential treatment, similar to massive stock option grants and
huge retirement payments to former CEOs.</TE>
<TE>   "It can be difficult to second-guess from the outside where a
payment like this may be necessary," said Ken Bertsch, director of
corporate governance at TIAA-CREF, a mutual fund and pension company.
"But these packages have become excessive. We may have overdone this
notion of recruiting CEO superstars."</TE>

<HD>Global Offices for Sale</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Telecom firm's former Beverly Hills
headquarters is on the market in the wake of bankruptcy filing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The posh corporate compound in the heart of Beverly Hills that once
served as the headquarters for Global Crossing Ltd. and Chairman Gary
Winnick has been put up for sale or lease in the wake of the
telecommunication company's filing for bankruptcy protection this
year.</LD>
<LD>   No sales price or leasing rates have been established for the
2.5-acre property on Santa Monica Boulevard and North Crescent Drive.
But real estate brokers said the former Global Crossing
Plaza--renamed North Crescent Plaza--will probably be sold, and is
expected to easily fetch far in excess of the about $50 million
Winnick spent on purchasing and renovating the historic property.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not for the faint of heart," commercial real estate broker
Robert Chavez said. "It's going to be expensive even in this down
market."</LD>
<TE>   The property includes two buildings totaling about 124,000 square
feet, a parking structure, lush gardens, reflecting pools and
fountains. The complex dates to the late 1930s when entertainment
industry mogul Lew Wasserman hired architect Paul Williams to design
a building for his company, Music Corp. of America (MCA).</TE>
<TE>   Williams designed a second building in the early 1960s when the
complex served as headquarters for electronics company Litton
Industries.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick bought the property for $41.5 million in 1998 through a
partnership known as North Crescent Realty V, and it housed the
headquarters of Global Crossing, Asia Global Crossing, and Winnick's
Pacific Capital Group and Colony Capital investment companies.</TE>
<TE>   An additional $7.5 million was spent on an elaborate restoration
of the property.</TE>
<TE>   The property is vacant after having as many as 250 employees
during Global Crossing's peak.</TE>
<TE>   It was put on the market after several unsolicited offers were
made, real estate broker Martin Morgenstern of Cushman &amp; Wakefield
said.</TE>
<TE>   Proposals for the property have included transforming it into a
luxury hotel, a talent agency, entertainment industry offices or a
medical center, area brokers said.</TE>

<HD>Hershey Trust Decides to Kiss Off All Bids</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Board members of the charitable trust that controls Hershey Foods
Corp. said late Tuesday that they would not sell the nation's largest
candy maker after rejecting all offers.</LD>
<LD>   "The trust board has rejected all the bids that it received. It is
asking the company to end the process of exploring the sale," Hershey
Trust Co. spokesman Rick Kelly said.</LD>
<LD>   All 17 trustees met behind closed doors in a suburban Philadelphia
hotel Tuesday to conduct board business and discuss the secretive
process of seeking bids on its controlling stake. The $5.9-billion
trust, which controls 77% of the company's shareholder votes and 31%
of its common stock, announced July 25 that it had ordered Hershey
Foods executives to seek bids on its stake. More than half the
trust's assets are invested in the stock, and board members say the
trust could be hurt if the company's finances falter.</LD>
<TE>   The potential sale, however, sparked protests from the public and
politicians, who said the interests of the community would be pushed
aside in any sale.</TE>
<TE>   A state judge granted an injunction on a sale, pending a Hershey
Trust Co. appeal, and state Atty. Gen. Mike Fisher had petitioned the
judge to require the trust to seek court approval before it could
sell the candy maker.</TE>

<HD>Home Prices Rise Sharply in August</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Median values reach a record $370,000 in
Orange County and near-record $267,000 in L.A.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Home prices in Southern California's largest counties grew robustly
in August, as the cost of all types of housing from entry-level
condos to luxury homes reached levels far above those of a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   The median price, the point at which half the homes sell for more
and half for less, jumped by 20% in Orange County and by 15% in Los
Angeles County, DataQuick Information Systems Inc. reported Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County median, at an all-time high of $370,000,
represented the largest year-over-year increase since 1989. Los
Angeles County's median price hit $267,000, slightly below its record
high in June.</LD>
<TE>   Home sales dropped by 8% in Orange County and by 12% in Los
Angeles County in August. But John Karevoll of DataQuick said those
declines do not reflect a new trend because sales a year ago were
unusually high.</TE>
<TE>   "The real estate statistics we're seeing right now are incredibly
strong," said Karevoll, the analyst who compiled the report for the
La Jolla firm.</TE>
<TE>   But some wonder how long the robust market will last. Prices have
been growing at an unsustainable pace and the rate of increase is
likely to slow, said Mark Boud, principal of Real Estate Economics, a
consulting firm in Laguna Niguel.</TE>
<TE>   "We think appreciation will slow," Boud said, though he still
believes the market is healthy.</TE>
<TE>   Condominiums, typically a source of lower-priced housing, again
showed the largest percentage gain last month, with the median rising
21% in Orange County and 20% in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Prices have been boosted by a low supply of homes for sale, the
lowest mortgage rates in generations and a rickety stock market that
has prompted consumers to invest more in the perceived safe harbor of
real estate.</TE>
<TE>   The rising prices have caused many buyers to shift to
adjustable-rate loans, which are easier to qualify for than
fixed-rate loans, to buy expensive homes, some agents say.</TE>
<TE>   And some homeowners are growing more inclined to sell as prices
continue to climb.</TE>
<TE>   "We're definitely seeing more inventory, even though it's not
lasting very long," said Ted Brass, an agent at Century 21 in
Inglewood.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, some market observers say that even though there is
a shortage of homes priced less than $300,000--which would ordinarily
make the market move faster--the housing market is showing signs of
slowing.</TE>
<TE>   "Buyers are backing away from paying top dollar for inferior
homes," said Patrick Knapp, an agent at Remax in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the flood of consumers refinancing their home loans
to capture lower rates has overwhelmed lenders, appraisers and escrow
and title companies, clogging the mortgage paperwork pipeline for new
buyers. Many sales that would have occurred in August, Knapp said,
will be posted this month.</TE>

<DH>Wall Street: Falling industrial production adds to investor
jitters as the blue-chip indexes fall to six-week lows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A drop in industrial production and a profit warning from McDonald's
on Tuesday took a jab at investors' already shaky confidence in the
economy, sending blue-chip stock indexes to six-week lows.</LD>
<LD>   In the bond market, long-term Treasury yields slid to new 40-year
lows as investors again poured money into high-quality bonds.</LD>
<LD>   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average sank 172.63
points, or 2.1%, to 8,207.55, the lowest close since Aug. 5.</LD>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 fell nearly 2% to 873.52, the lowest
since Aug. 6.</TE>
<TE>   The tech-dominated Nasdaq composite slid 15.94 points, or 1.3%, to
1,259.94, but it had been lower as recently as Sept. 5.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks were pressured Tuesday by discouraging economic data from
the Federal Reserve, which said industrial production fell 0.3% in
August. Analysts were forecasting an increase of 0.1% to 0.2%.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's, one of the 30 Dow stocks, saw its shares tumble $2.78,
or nearly 13%, to a seven-year low of $18.91 after warning that weak
sales would hurt profit this quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Also, supermarket giant Kroger slumped $2.25 to $15.76 after the
firm cut its earnings growth estimate for the year, citing cautious
shoppers and tougher competition. Rival Safeway slid $2.98 to $24.05.</TE>
<TE>   "This economic recovery keeps getting pushed out by these earnings
warnings," said Barry Berman, head trader for brokerage Robert W.
Baird &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   After regular trading ended, banking titan J.P. Morgan Chase also
warned that results this quarter would fall short of expectations,
amid rising bad loans.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks failed to gain traction from Iraq's announcement late
Monday that it would readmit United Nations weapons inspectors. Oil
prices fell but closed above their lows for the day.</TE>
<TE>   "My feeling is the news on the Iraq thing was a little positive,
but I don't think the Iraq scenario as a whole is positive until
there is an end to it," said Stephen Carl, principal and head of
equity trading at Williams Capital Group.</TE>
<TE>   Losers outnumbered winners by 23 to 10 on the New York Stock
Exchange and by 21 to 12 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's session marked the one-year anniversary of the
resumption of trading after the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Worries about the economy again turned the focus to the Federal
Reserve. Central bank policymakers will meet on Tuesday and are
expected to leave their key short-term interest rate unchanged at
1.75%--unless the economic news worsens considerably.</TE>
<TE>   In the bond market, some investors still appear to be betting that
the Fed will eventually ease credit further. The 10-year T-note yield
fell to 3.82% Tuesday, down from 3.91% Monday and a new four- decade
low.</TE>
<TE>   Yields also fell on shorter-term Treasuries.</TE>
<TE>   Some investors also snapped up high-quality corporate bonds.
Wal-Mart Stores sold $500 million in five-year notes at an annualized
yield of 3.46%.</TE>
<TE>   Among Tuesday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Other restaurant stocks fell sharply with McDonald's. Wendy's
slid $1.79 to $30.83, Cheesecake Factory fell $1.67 to $25.45, and
fast-food operator Yum Brands sank $2.09 to $27.26.</TE>
<TE>   Soft drink stocks also weakened. Coca-Cola dropped $1.73 to
$48.95, and PepsiCo slid $1.70 to $39.25.</TE>
<TE>   * Mortgage giant Fannie Mae plummeted after its regulator, the
Office of Federal Housing Enterprise, said it would conduct weekly
financial reviews of the company. Fannie Mae on Monday said the
mortgage loan refinancing wave had caused an imbalance in its assets
and liabilities, though it said that was unlikely to hurt earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the stock slumped $4.73 to $66.25, a 7% drop. Rival
Freddie Mac shed $3.28 to $58, a 5% drop.</TE>
<TE>   * Energy stocks were lower as crude prices fell. Exxon Mobil
dropped $1.33 to $33.07, ChevronTexaco lost $2.63 to $71.37, and
Unocal was off $1.04 to $31.77.</TE>
<TE>   * Defense stocks, which had surged on Monday amid U.S.-Iraq
worries, fell back. Boeing lost 94 cents to $36.29, General Dynamics
fell $3.90 to $82.70, and Alliant Techsystems gave up $3.71 to
$69.99.</TE>
<TE>   * On the plus side, electronics retailer Best Buy rose $1.37 to
$25.46 on second-quarter earnings that were a penny a share higher
than analysts were expecting.</TE>

<HD>J.P. Morgan Expects Higher Loan Defaults, Lower Revenue</HD>
<DH>Earnings: The bank says its third-quarter profit will fall
'well below' the second quarter's. Shares slump on the news.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL NOLL</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., the second-biggest U.S. bank, Tuesday cut
its forecast for third-quarter profit because of a surge in loan
defaults by telecommunications and cable companies and a plunge in
trading revenue.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Executive William B. Harrison Jr. said in a conference call
with investors that he may fire employees to slash costs after the
bank said third-quarter profit from operations would fall "well
below" the 58 cents a share earned in the second quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. cut the bank's credit rating one level to
A-plus.</LD>
<TE>   After the announcement, Morgan shares, down 41% year to date,
slumped to $19.51 in after-hours trading. The stock had slipped 16
cents to $21.55 on the New York Stock Exchange in regular trading.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement could rattle financial stocks today.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't fully appreciate the level of deterioration that would
occur beginning in the last couple of months," Harrison said. "It
developed into worse than we thought."</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, the world's biggest arranger of syndicated loans
and a top underwriter of corporate bonds has been hit by Enron
Corp.'s collapse, loan losses from the failure of companies such as
Global Crossing Ltd. and Argentina's debt default.</TE>
<TE>   Another setback came last week when a federal judge rejected
Morgan's claims of fraud against 11 insurers as part of an effort to
collect $965 million for losses on gas and oil trades with Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Loan losses overall are expected to total about $1.4 billion in
the three months ending Sept. 30, an increase from $302 million in
the previous quarter, the bank said.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan's trading revenue in July and August was about $100
million, compared with $1.1 billion for the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The company cited "less favorable results from trading positions
in a challenging market environment" for the decline. U.S. stock
prices plunged to five-year lows in July.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call had, on average, forecast
that Morgan would earn 54 cents a share in the current quarter, up
from 51 cents a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Harrison said the bank doesn't plan a "massive" cut in jobs. "It's
going to be thoughtful," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the expected earnings shortfall, Morgan on Tuesday
declared its regular quarterly dividend of 34 cents a share. Some
analysts had thought the dividend might be suspended.</TE>

<HD>OPEC Might Not Increase Output</HD>
<DH>Oil: Some members say higher prices are due to geopolitical
rather than supply concerns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>OSAKA, Japan</DL>
<LD>The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries may leave its
oil-production quotas unchanged at a meeting this week, after Iraq
decided late Monday to allow the unconditional return of United
Nations weapons inspectors, traders and analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   October crude oil futures prices fell 2% in New York on Tuesday,
losing 59 cents to $29.08 a barrel, on the belief that Iraq's
decision makes a U.S. attack less likely. But the price closed well
above the low of $28.24 set early in the session, as the White House
expressed skepticism about Iraq's move.</LD>
<LD>   Oil still is up 47% this year, partly on concern that a war would
disrupt Middle East supplies.</LD>
<TE>   OPEC will meet here Thursday to consider its first increase in
output quotas in two years.</TE>
<TE>   "A weakness in oil prices in the next few days will take the
pressure off OPEC to lift production," said Stuart Smith, an energy
analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in Sydney, Australia.</TE>
<TE>   OPEC Secretary General Alvaro Silva said ministers will review the
effect of U.S.-Iraq tensions on prices when they begin their quota
debate.</TE>
<TE>   The cartel is meeting to decide oil production levels for the rest
of the year. Officials from Iran, Venezuela and Kuwait have contended
that oil prices have risen because of geopolitical concerns, not
underlying demand, and that output should not be increased at the
risk of lower prices.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter and OPEC's most
influential member, hasn't publicly stated its position for the
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia previously has said the group would boost output in
the event that an attack on Iraq reduced supply. But a majority of
the group's members have signaled there's no need to ship more oil at
current prices.</TE>
<TE>   "There is enough oil in the market to meet the oil demand and any
expected increase due to cold winter," said Kuwaiti Oil Minister
Sheikh Ahmad Fahad al-Ahmad al-Sabah. Prices are "fair" for producers
and consumers, he said in answer to faxed questions before leaving
Kuwait for Osaka.</TE>
<TE>   The seasonal rise in demand for heating fuel in the Northern
Hemisphere may keep prices from falling much further, some analysts
and traders said.</TE>
<TE>   The International Energy Agency estimates that fourth-quarter oil
demand will rise to 78.1 million barrels a day, up 1.1 million, or
1.4%, from the year-earlier quarter.</TE>

<HD>Oracle Profit Drops; Forecast Is Downbeat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Declining sales at Oracle Corp. led to a 33% drop in the database
maker's fiscal first-quarter income, and Chief Executive Larry
Ellison said earnings per share for the full fiscal year could
stagnate or dip slightly from the year before.</LD>
<LD>   Profit fell to $343 million, or 6 cents a share, in the three
months ended Aug. 31 from $511 million, or 9 cents, a year earlier,
Oracle said Tuesday. Excluding an investment write-down, the Redwood
City, Calif.-based company matched the consensus estimate by Wall
Street firms of 7 cents a share.</LD>
<LD>   Sales fell more than 10% to $2.03 billion, dragged down by new
product licenses, which fell 23%. Less expensive updates to
previously installed products grew 9%.</LD>
<TE>   "Our assumption for the second half of the year is that again
we'll see improvement, but we certainly don't expect any sharp
improvement," Oracle Chief Financial Officer Jeff Henley said.</TE>
<TE>   Investors had been hoping for more new license sales and more
optimism about the coming months, analysts said. Oracle shares fell
to $8.60 in after-hours trading after the earnings report. It had
dropped 25 cents to $9.03 in regular Nasdaq trading.</TE>
<TE>   "License revenues were a little lower than what a lot of people
had modeled, but they did meet the overall targets," said analyst
Cameron Steele of RBC Capital Markets, who owns Oracle shares and
recommends them. RBC does no investment banking business with Oracle.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue at the No. 2 free-standing software maker has been sliding
for a year and a half. IBM Corp. and Microsoft Corp. have been making
progress in parts of the database market that Oracle had dominated
for years, and users haven't flocked to other Oracle applications.</TE>
<TE>   "What investors have wanted with Oracle is, first of all, growth,
which they don't have in this environment, but secondly forecasts and
earnings that are at least predictable. Now we have that," Steele
said. Still, "there's a little controversy on which direction the
company is going."</TE>
<TE>   Oracle executives said they eliminated 500 to 600 jobs in the most
recent quarter and would trim about that number in the next three
months. Many of the cuts will come in Europe, which performed worse
in the first quarter than the company had anticipated.</TE>

<HD>Conference Board Panel Calls for Cuts in Executives' Pay</HD>
<DH>Management: The group of business veterans issues
recommendations but is unable to agree on how to treat options.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A panel of business leaders said Tuesday that America's executives
are overpaid and called on corporate directors to take steps to rein
in compensation, including requiring companies to record stock
options grants as an expense.</LD>
<LD>   The 12-member panel of the Conference Board, which includes former
Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt and Intel
Corp. Chairman Andy Grove, issued 23 recommendations in all. The
members were unanimous on everything but the options recommendation.</LD>
<LD>   Intended to rebuild confidence in public companies after almost a
year of accounting scandals, the report came on the same day that
Tyco International Ltd. said former Chief Executive L. Dennis
Kozlowski forgave $56.4 million in company loans to employees and
treated himself to a $6,000 shower curtain, $96,943 worth of flowers
and other items with corporate cash.</LD>
<TE>   "Executive compensation has become disconnected from long-term
performance," said Peter G. Peterson, chairman of New York-based
buyout firm Blackstone Group and co-chairman of the Conference Board
panel. "There is an imbalance between unprecedented levels of
executive compensation, with little apparent financial downside
risk."</TE>
<TE>   The panel said stock options encourage executives to focus on
boosting their companies' stock price in the short term, rather than
managing for long-term growth. Options give holders the right to buy
shares at a fixed price regardless of where they are trading in
public markets.</TE>
<TE>   "The trouble with options is they reward the good, the bad and the
ugly in a rising market, and in a bear market they reward nobody,"
said commission member Paul A. Volcker, a former chairman of the
Federal Reserve. "It's like rewarding people by giving them tickets
to the New Jersey lottery."</TE>
<TE>   The recommendation that companies treat option grants as expenses
was opposed by Volcker--who said they should be phased out entirely
as an executive compensation incentive--and by Intel's Grove.</TE>
<TE>   The technology executive endorsed options as a tool to motivate
and retain employees and said options can't be accurately valued
because their worth depends on the price of shares when options are
exercised.</TE>
<TE>   Technology companies such as Intel have used options regularly in
lieu of cash to attract and retain employees and have led the
resistance to proposals on treating options as expenses, which could
reduce corporate profits.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International, a
San Jose-based trade group, said its members do not support proposals
to expense options. The group said 74% of the workers in its industry
receive stock options.</TE>
<TE>   Billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who advised the panel, said
it is better to give options an approximate cost than to continue the
practice of pretending they have no value.</TE>
<TE>   The Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets U.S.
accounting rules, said it plans to require companies to disclose
options expenses quarterly.</TE>
<TE>   The Conference Board recommendations are expected to carry weight.</TE>
<TE>   "There's going to be some acute pressure on big companies that are
in the public eye to adopt some of these recommendations," said
Joseph Carcello, accounting professor at the University of Tennessee.
"The compensation system we've created for executives in this country
is in many ways the source of our problems."</TE>
<TE>   Among the panel's other proposals: requiring executives to give
advance public notice of plans to sell shares in their companies,
making directors and top managers hold stock for extended periods and
entrusting executive pay decisions to compensation experts hired by
independent board members rather than by management.</TE>
<TE>   The Conference Board panel said that it would conduct a national
campaign to persuade public companies to adopt its recommendations.</TE>

<HD>Psoriasis Treatment Clears Key Hurdle</HD>
<DH>Medicine: Samples made by Genentech are as effective as
earlier batches made by it and Xoma, the firms say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JED SELTZER</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Genentech Inc. and Xoma Ltd. said Tuesday that their experimental
drug for the skin disorder psoriasis cleared a major hurdle,
increasing the likelihood that it will be approved for sale.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of Berkeley-based Xoma jumped 8% on the news, while stock
in South San Francisco-based Genentech rose almost 3%.</LD>
<LD>   The market for psoriasis drugs is estimated at more than $1
billion in the United States and as much as $5 billion globally. The
disease, characterized by scaly bumps and raised patches on the skin,
afflicts more than 100 million people around the world. Most
psoriasis sufferers use ointments or creams.</LD>
<TE>   The two biotechnology companies said batches of the drug, Raptiva,
made by Genentech were just as effective in treating psoriasis as
earlier batches of the medicine made from material manufactured by
both firms.</TE>
<TE>   The Food and Drug Administration asked the companies to conduct
the additional study to prove that the drug could be duplicated at
Genentech facilities without changing its chemical composition.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA request, which delayed the drug's potential introduction,
came after the companies said in April that the Raptiva being
manufactured by Genentech was qualitatively different from earlier
batches.</TE>
<TE>   The companies said they anticipate submitting an application by
year-end seeking U.S. marketing approval for the drug.</TE>
<TE>   Raptiva has shown impressive efficacy in clinical trials, reducing
psoriasis by at least 75% in some 61% of patients taking the drug for
about a year, said analyst Darren Mac of Fulcrum Global Partners.</TE>
<TE>   The new study confirms an earlier trial showing that the proper
weekly dose of Raptiva is 1 milligram per 1 kilogram of body weight,
said Michael King, an analyst at Banc of America.</TE>
<TE>   "Given this is consistent with the other results, this gives the
FDA more comfort that Genentech has selected the right dose and I
think makes the drug more approvable," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Biotechnology and drug companies are racing to be the first to
market a psoriasis drug.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Biogen Inc. indicated that U.S. regulators probably
would decide about marketing approval for its psoriasis drug,
Amevive, in early 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Other firms seeking to market psoriasis drugs include Johnson &amp;
Johnson and Amgen Inc., which hope to treat the skin disorder using
their arthritis drugs Remicade and Enbrel, respectively. Arthritis
drugs may be effective against psoriasis because both ailments are
related to inflammation caused by an overactive immune system.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Xoma climbed 49 cents to $6.58 on Nasdaq. Genentech rose
92 cents to $31.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Slowest Sales in 5 Years Seen for Holiday</HD>
<DH>Economy: The National Retail Federation predicts a 4% gain
as consumers worry about war with Iraq and the recovery's pace at
home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The nation's top retail trade group said Tuesday that the upcoming
holiday shopping season would be the slowest in five years, with
sales increasing a scant 4% as consumers worry about war with Iraq
and the slow pace of economic recovery at home.</LD>
<LD>   The National Retail Federation predicted the November-December
sales period would post the smallest increase since 1997. Sales also
grew 4% that year as the nation emerged from an economic slowdown.</LD>
<LD>   By comparison, sales last year grew 5.6% in November and December,
even after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks threatened to dampen
demand.</LD>
<TE>   The outlook could be even darker in California. A separate report,
conducted for the NRF by BIGresearch, said Californians probably will
spend less this Christmas than shoppers nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   And overall, consumers here were more pessimistic than Americans
as a whole on whether the economy would rebound this year.</TE>
<TE>   The preliminary report did not say why Californians had a gloomier
outlook, although one retail analyst suggested the state amplifies
the national trend.</TE>
<TE>   "In California I think that we're suffering the same type of
malaise as the rest of the country--too much bad corporate news, too
much uncertainty in the stock market and unemployment numbers that
aren't encouraging," said Richard Giss, a retail analyst with
Deloitte &amp; Touche in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, 62.4% of consumers said they plan to spend the same
this holiday season as they did last year, with 29.3% saying they
planned to spend less and 8.3% planning to spend more, BIGresearch
found.</TE>
<TE>   "This year, I think we're seeing consumers be very, very cautious
and frankly appropriately so," NRF President Tracy Mullin said.
"We're in a very volatile economy and a very volatile global
situation, and consumers are nervous. That's a reasonable way for
consumers to approach the holiday."</TE>
<TE>   In California, consumers' outlook is slightly more conservative,
with 60.6% of those surveyed saying they planned to spend the same as
they did last Christmas season, 31.7% anticipating spending less and
7.7% expecting to spend more than they did a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's index of retail stocks was down 1.3% on
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Retailing is a major component of the state and U.S. economy,
accounting for two-thirds of the gross domestic product. Of
California's 14.6 million nonfarm workers, 2.6 million, or about 18%,
work in retailing.</TE>
<TE>   The success of the holiday shopping season also is a big factor
for California's apparel makers, such as Levi Strauss &amp; Co. and
Quiksilver Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "You cannot have a big holiday season without apparel sales,
because it's the No. 1 item on most people's holiday list," Giss
said. "If you have difficulty in apparel, that has a trickle-down
effect in our local economy because we have a huge apparel
manufacturing base here and we're a big apparel market."</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, predicting retail sales is a notoriously dicey
proposition, because changes in world events, national politics or
macro economic data can affect consumer psychology. Despite last
year's gloomy holiday predictions, for example, consumers shopped to
make themselves feel better and to brighten their homes as spending
time with family and friends gained importance.</TE>
<TE>   Although the NRF, as a retail trade group, is usually optimistic
in its outlook, it also has tended to be on the mark in terms of
predicting total holiday retail sales, in line with government
figures of sales of general retail goods.</TE>
<TE>   Forecasting consumer spending has become even more important over
the last 18 months, as retail buying emerged as one of the few
economic bright spots softening the blow of recession.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts worry that consumer resilience might be waning as
housing starts slow and employment numbers continue to falter.</TE>
<TE>   "Whereas in the prior couple of years, consumers spent
liberally--surprisingly so in 2001--for holiday 2002, retailers will
be fighting for consumers' dollars and working to spur the kind of
excitement that will get consumers into their stores," said Matt
Fassler, a retail analyst with Goldman Sachs in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some analysts note that because the NRF bases its forecast
on total retail sales, which most closely mirror government data,
Tuesday's report may underestimate holiday sales. Most retail
analysts base their estimates on same-store sales, which exclude new
and closed stores and so more closely examine consumer demand for
goods.</TE>
<TE>   By that estimate, Michael Niemira of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi says
he sees sales improving from last year, with a same-store sales gain
of about 4% this holiday season.</TE>
<TE>   Because same-store sales exclude new stores, which can skew the
sales figures higher, a 4% sales gain would be considered a solid
holiday season.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not going to be a bad holiday season," the NRF's Mullin
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not going to be a blockbuster, it's not going to be
spectacular, but it's going to be a good solid holiday season."</TE>

<LD>A group of dissident Walt Disney Co. investors said they will
recommend corporate governance changes to directors of the Burbank
entertainment giant, but declined to specify what the proposals would
be.</LD>
<LD>   Providence Capital said it had organized a meeting at its New York
offices of 36 institutional shareholders holding from 10% to 15% of
the company's shares, but declined to name any of them.</LD>
<LD>   Topics included changes in Disney's bylaws, possible plans for a
successor to Chief Executive Michael Eisner and the company's
struggling ABC network and theme parks.</LD>
<TE>   Disney directors are scheduled to meet Tuesday amid growing
pressure on Eisner and the company's sagging stock price. A Disney
spokesman said the company has not received any recommendations, but
"we welcome any input from our shareholders."</TE>

Clayson, who will be leaving at the end of the month to become a CBS
News correspondent.</LD>
<LD>   Executives want to bring back Harry Smith, who co-anchored the
program until 1996, with NBC Sports personality Hannah Storm as a

<LD>Best Buy Co.'s fiscal second-quarter profit fell 27%, but beat
analyst expectations.</LD>
<LD>   The largest U.S. electronics retailer said net income dropped to
$62 million, or 19 cents a share, as it spent more to open stores.
The results were a penny better than the average analyst expectations
that were revised last month after the company warned of lagging
sales. Sales increased 20% to $5.01 billion, helped by Best Buy's
acquisition of the Future Shop chain in Canada last year.</LD>

<HD>Schwab to Cut 10% of Staff as Trading Drops</HD>
<DH>Brokerage: Number of daily transactions falls 25% in August
from previous month. Firm might miss forecast.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Charles Schwab Corp. said Tuesday that it would cut about 10% of its
staff, or about 1,880 employees, to cope with weak client trading
volume.</LD>
<LD>   The discount brokerage also said it might miss its third-quarter
earnings forecast.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco-based Schwab said the number of trades it handles
daily fell 25% in August from the previous month to an average
117,500, the biggest drop since May 2000.</LD>
<TE>   The trading activity--which excludes mutual fund trades--fell even
further in the first nine days of September, to an average 100,000
daily.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Financial Officer Christopher Dodds said the company expects
to earn 7 to 8 cents a share for the third quarter, compared with an
earlier forecast of 8 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts on average were expecting 8 cents, within a range of 7 to
9 cents, according to Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Schwab shares fell 60 cents, or 6%, to $9.17 in New York Stock
Exchange trading, down from a 52-week high of $19 in January.</TE>
<TE>   Schwab fired about 7,200 employees, or 25% of its staff, in a
restructuring last year.</TE>
<TE>   The end of the bull market in 2000 meant the company was too big
for the declining customer activity.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, Schwab cut 350 jobs in August when it closed a call
center in Austin, Texas, ending the month with 18,800 employees.</TE>
<TE>   It plans to cut about 10% of that remaining staff by the end of
October, Dodds said.</TE>
<TE>   Schwab said its recent cost-cutting moves, including the latest
round of job cuts, would save more than $225 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   Schwab continues to bring in new money, despite the glum
environment. It brought in $4.4 billion in net new assets in August,
ending the month with $767.6 billion in total client assets.</TE>
<TE>   That was down 7% from a year earlier as stock market declines cut
into portfolio values.</TE>

<HD>Firms Still Deny Harm in Smoking, Report Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Several major tobacco companies are continuing to deny in court
filings that smoking causes disease, even though in recent years they
have publicly acknowledged the health hazards of their products, a
congressional staff report said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Over the last five years, cigarette makers, struggling to repair
their tattered image, have conceded on their Web sites that there are
significant risks associated with smoking--in some instances making
statements that are hardly different from the views of their longtime
foes. But the report, prepared for Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles),
contends that the companies still are being evasive about the health
hazards of smoking, secondhand smoke and the addictiveness of
nicotine.</LD>
<LD>   "A test of whether the industry has reformed is the truthfulness
of company statements made under penalty of sanction in a court of
law," said Waxman, ranking minority member of the House Committee on
Government Reform and an industry critic.</LD>
<TE>   Waxman's report is based on industry responses to a massive
lawsuit filed by the Justice Department in September 1999. A federal
judge in Washington threw out significant parts of the case but has
permitted the government to pursue claims that tobacco companies were
guilty of fraud and racketeering in concealing the hazards and
addictiveness of smoking.</TE>
<TE>   The industry has contended vociferously that the suit is meritless
and that, unlike other major cases, it will not settle. The case is
scheduled for trial next year.</TE>
<TE>   The major tobacco companies said that they had acted responsibly.
Spokesmen for Philip Morris Cos., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings
Inc., Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. and its parent, British
American Tobacco, all said the firms had made appropriate statements
about risks associated with smoking on their Web sites. Lorillard
Tobacco could not be reached.</TE>
<TE>   Waxman's report states that:</TE>
<TE>   * Four of the five major cigarette firms--RJR, BAT, Brown &amp;
Williamson and Lorillard--still question whether smoking causes
disease, "even though medical and scientific authorities universally
accept that smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema and
other diseases." Only Philip Morris, the largest manufacturer, did
not contest that smoking causes disease, and RJR acknowledged only
that smoking "may contribute to causing disease in some individuals."</TE>
<TE>   * Four of the five firms decline to admit that nicotine is
addictive, "even though leading medical and scientific authorities
have concluded that it is." Only Brown &amp; Williamson, the
third-largest manufacturer, admitted that nicotine is addictive. For
example, Lorillard stated that "after reasonable inquiry, the
information known or readily obtainable by Lorillard is insufficient
to enable Lorillard ... to admit or deny" that nicotine is addictive.</TE>
<TE>   * All five major tobacco firms deny that environmental tobacco
smoke, commonly known as secondhand smoke, causes disease in
nonsmokers, "even though medical and scientific organizations,
including the U.S. Surgeon General and the World Health Organization,
have found that environmental tobacco smoke causes disease." For
example, Brown &amp; Williamson acknowledged only that such smoke can be
"irritating" or "annoying" to nonsmokers.</TE>
<TE>   "Refusing to admit that nicotine is addictive or that cigarettes
cause disease is the equivalent of saying that the earth is flat,"
Waxman said.</TE>
<TE>   The congressman issued the report just days before the U.S. Senate
opens hearings on whether the Food and Drug Administration should be
given expanded authority to regulate the cigarette companies. The
report comes at a time when the cigarette makers--who in the last
five years have agreed to pay out $246 billion in settlements and
have been hammered by juries for almost $150 billion in damages--have
been attempting to convince the public that they are not an outlaw
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to the report, Philip Morris attorney Michael York said
Tuesday, "Philip Morris is very comfortable with the positions it has
taken on its Web site and in the court proceeding."</TE>
<TE>   Brown &amp; Williamson spokesman Stephen Kottak said, "There are risks
to smoking. We acknowledge those risks. They are clearly spelled out
on our Web site."</TE>
<TE>   Brown &amp; Williamson's Web site says that the company's position on
smoking and disease has evolved in recent years partly because its
"position on disease causation was widely misinterpreted." The site
now states that Brown &amp; Williamson scientists "have concluded that,
assessing all of the scientific evidence together, the best judgment
is that smoking is a cause of disease."</TE>
<TE>   In its response to written questions from Justice Department
lawyers, however, Brown &amp; Williamson took a narrower position.</TE>
<TE>   "For certain diseases, including lung cancer, studies in the U.S.
and elsewhere indicate that the risks are strong and consistent. This
suggests that smoking is a cause of (or a contributor to) disease in
humans. However, we know of no way to verify that smoking is a cause
of any particular person's adverse health or why smoking may have
adverse health effects on some people and not others." At another
point, the response states that the firm concurs that "smoking is a
cause of certain diseases."</TE>
<TE>   David Betteridge, a BAT spokesman in London, said that whatever
Brown &amp; Williamson officials said was fine with him, since Brown &amp;
Williamson is a subsidiary of BAT.</TE>
<TE>   An RJR spokesman said only that the company stood by the positions
on its Web site, but declined further comment.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Daynard, a law professor at Northeastern University in
Boston and a longtime industry foe, said he thought it was
"shortsighted" of the companies to haggle over whether smoke causes
disease and whether nicotine is addictive, given the overwhelming
scientific evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "It will not take a silver-tongued lawyer for the Justice
Department to prevail on these issues," he said. "This seems like a
rear-guard action in a surprising venue."</TE>

<HD>Sun to Sell Desktops With Linux System</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>A month after Sun Microsystems Inc. reversed course and said it would
do more to promote the free Linux operating system, the big computer
maker plans to announce today that it intends to sell a line of
desktop machines running Linux and other open-source programs.</LD>
<LD>   The move could give a boost to Linux in the area it's weakest: the
personal computer. Big companies have been increasingly turning to
Linux to run servers that control computer networks or single
functions, but few individuals have been willing to assemble a
complete set of PC software instead of using Microsoft Corp.'s
Windows operating system, word-processing software and other
applications.</LD>
<LD>   Sun plans to do the assembling itself and offer the hardware,
software and support to some kinds of companies, executives said
Tuesday. Chief Executive Scott McNealy will introduce the products at
a San Francisco convention.</LD>
<TE>   "We're creating a user experience that will feel very similar to
what they're used to," said Tony Siress, Sun senior director of
desktop solutions.</TE>
<TE>   Sun said in August that it would start shipping Linux servers that
use Intel Corp. processors instead of its own more expensive chips.
It hinted that it would soon do more with desktop software.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft has a monopoly on desktop operating systems, and its
smaller productivity programs such as Word and Excel are even more
profitable. Linux enthusiasts have cobbled together free desktop
projects but hoped that a big technology firm such as Sun--a
Microsoft foe--would get more involved.</TE>
<TE>   Today's news still will disappoint some who have been rooting for
a full desktop software suite. Sun said the project launching next
year would target specialized workers, such as those in call centers
or retail establishments who do the same few tasks over and over.</TE>
<TE>   Siress declined to say how much the system would cost per desk or
how many desktops would make such a volume purchase economical. The
machines will use Intel chips and be cheaper than those outfitted
with Microsoft software.</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, top Linux seller Red Hat Inc. reported that its
quarterly loss narrowed to $1.7 million, or 1 cent a share, from $4.6
million, or 3 cents, in the previous quarter.</TE>

<HD>FTC: Weight-Loss Ads Often Deceive</HD>
<DH>Advertising: Report says 55% of those studied lack proof or
probably are false. Agency implores nation's media outlets to act as
gatekeeper.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You've seen or heard the too-good-to-be-true weight-loss
advertisements: No diet or exercise required; lose eight to 10 pounds
per week; take it off and keep it off. The Federal Trade Commission
said Tuesday that many of these ads are exactly that--too good to be
true and are getting more outlandish each year despite increased
enforcement actions.</LD>
<LD>   The FTC issued a report that did not single out specific products,
companies or ads, but studied about 300 advertisements from 2001. The
FTC said that 55% of the weight-loss ads made claims that lack proof
or probably were false, such as "I lost 46 pounds in 30 days!"</LD>
<LD>   The report said about 61% of U.S. adults are overweight or obese,
and consumers spent about $35 billion in 2000 on weight-loss
products.</LD>
<TE>   When pressed for specific examples of deceptive ads, FTC officials
cited a list on its Web site of several dozen recent cases in which
it is pursuing enforcement action.</TE>
<TE>   Among those cases are the Hollywood 48-Hour Miracle Diet and
Enforma Natural Products' Fat Trapper and Exercise in a Bottle. Other
advertisements tackled by the FTC included abdominal machines that
claimed to produce washboard abs through electrical stimulation. In
most cases, the FTC is seeking to have the advertisements pulled and
to get reimbursement for consumers.</TE>
<TE>   The latest FTC case, announced Tuesday, was against a Canadian
company, Bio Lab, accused of making false weight-loss claims and
false claims for quick cellulite loss. The FTC said that the
company's ads ran in the Los Angeles Times, the Washington Post, the
Philadelphia Inquirer and other newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   The FTC report said deceptive ads contribute to the losing battle
against obesity, which is second only to smoking in causing
preventable deaths annually. The ads have become more misleading in
their claims in the last 10 years, the FTC said, and the agency
implored the nation's major media outlets to do more to police those
advertisements and keep them out of print or off the air to protect
the public.</TE>
<TE>   "There is some frustration and concern," said J. Howard Beales,
director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. "Clearly,
enforcement action has to be part of the solution, but we need to
think about other ways of getting the message out."</TE>
<TE>   The FTC study tracked advertisements listed in specific
publications in 1992 and 2001 to see how the ads had changed. The
latter produced particularly disturbing results, Beales said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, according to the report, 57% of advertisements were for
low-calorie meal replacements. But by 2001, the report said,
two-thirds of the ads were for dietary supplements and claimed that
diet and exercise were unnecessary.</TE>
<TE>   Some ads claimed results of weight loss of eight pounds to 10
pounds a week, far higher than most experts say is realistic.</TE>
<TE>   The latest ads, Beales said, were of the sort that could lead to
serious health consequences if someone who had been under a doctors'
orders to lose weight through diet and exercise stopped in the hope
that a pill would do the trick instead.</TE>
<TE>   Lucille A. Olson, a Los Angeles County coordinator for the
54-year-old national support group called TOPS, or Take Off Pounds
Sensibly, said that she found those types of ads most egregious.</TE>
<TE>   "People have died from some of those diet supplements. They are
tricking people who are looking for a magic bullet," said Olson, who,
with the help of TOPS, has lost 110 pounds over the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   Both Olson and Beale added that most Americans seeking to lose
weight have difficulty realizing that loss of half a pound or a pound
a week is the safest and most effective goal.</TE>
<TE>   Regarding the FTC's proposal that media outlets examine the
veracity of weight-loss advertisements and refuse to run those making
egregious claims, Jim Ewert of the California Newspaper Publishers
Assn. said it would clearly "run afoul of constitutional free speech
guarantees."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Beales and other federal officials said that it can and
should be done if a few standards are followed, such as refusing to
run ads that claim diet and exercise are not required.</TE>

<HD>Hussein Blunts U.S. Game Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>The game has begun.</LD>
<LD>   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, playing for time and the life of
his regime, has ceded a point to the United States in hopes of
slowing the diplomatic blitz against him. After balking for four
years, he will allow U.N. weapons inspectors back into his country.</LD>
<LD>   But that's all Hussein is doing, U.S. officials warn. The view
from Washington is that nothing has really changed. "We've seen this
game before," Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said curtly after
talks Tuesday at the United Nations.</LD>
<TE>   Yet the leader of Iraq may have scored a point or two with other
key nations, including some of the five permanent members of the
Security Council who have veto power and Arab countries whose
assistance would be crucial to any U.S. military campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Their view is that diplomacy now has a chance, that the U.N.
should not be too hasty in condoning the use of force.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, new diplomatic cleavage has emerged less than a
week into the Bush administration's global initiative to confront
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein's strategy, designed to divide and prevail, rather
abruptly undermined Washington's game plan at the world body--at
least for the short term. It also forced the Bush administration to
look for supporters all over again, according to U.N. diplomats.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly changes the mood on the Security Council. Our battle
is to get the U.N. to focus on the last 10 years rather than the last
10 minutes," a senior State Department official conceded.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration had expected Iraq to eventually allow the
weapons inspectors to return in a last-ditch effort to forestall
military action. But it was taken by surprise when the offer came
even before the U.S. could win passage of a U.N. resolution forcing
Baghdad's hand, according to U.S. and U.N. officials.</TE>
<TE>   The United States and other U.N. members now view the issue of
Iraq from different perspectives--and potentially with different
solutions, experts warn.</TE>
<TE>   "U.S. instincts will be to proceed as if nothing happened and to
continue toward a U.N. resolution and congressional approval," said
Judith Yaphe, an Iraq expert and former intelligence analyst now at
National Defense University in Washington. "The problem will be that
those who welcomed our actions at the U.N. just last week and were
willing to sign on to the kind of activities we wanted in a
resolution may shift again. Many are now welcoming Saddam's overture.
Others see change where we see none."</TE>
<TE>   The Security Council, particularly the permanent members, appeared
split Tuesday on what happens next.</TE>
<TE>   Russia's position in the days ahead may prove the most critical.
Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov said Tuesday that Moscow no longer
sees a need for a new U.N. resolution either spelling out what
Baghdad must do or warning of specific consequences should it not
cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   And many nations in or near the Middle East expressed relief that
the tension that had been building since President Bush's speech to
the General Assembly last Thursday calling for action against
Hussein's rule has dissipated.</TE>
<TE>   "Iraq's offer gives us some breathing room," Jordanian Foreign
Minister Marwan Muasher said in an interview. "The situation is not
solved, but it's a very good first step.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what the U.N. asked for, and this is what it got," he
added. "We're now one step back from the threshold of war, and we're
going to try to work through the process to give peace a chance."</TE>
<TE>   After a week of building a new consensus, the United States found
itself just trying to keep the ball rolling Tuesday. Bush warned that
the world "must not be fooled" by Iraq's offer.</TE>
<TE>   In U.N. corridors, meetings with allies and a flurry of telephone
calls, U.S. officials struggled to keep the focus on a new resolution
or resolutions.</TE>
<TE>   Washington would like to have a tentative draft for circulation by
Thursday, according to U.N. diplomats.</TE>
<TE>   The core of the U.S. counter-argument is that Hussein, rather
cleverly, made no pledge either to let the weapons inspectors do
their job or to surrender any weapons of mass destruction that the
Iraqis might have.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just his latest overture. It's an attempt to circumvent
the will of the international community. Iraq's letter doesn't
address the substance or the ultimate goal of the inspections. It
doesn't even mention disarming--only the logistics of the
inspectors," said the senior State Department official, who requested
anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The new divide may play out on both the number of resolutions and
the timing. Instead of getting one sweeping and immediate resolution
that would include the right to use force if the process of arms
inspection and elimination again breaks down, the United States may
have to settle for two resolutions--and possibly a lengthy delay in
passage of the second.</TE>
<TE>   The first resolution would call for Iraqi compliance and the
second would deal with the consequences for the lack of it, U.N.
diplomats predict.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the administration says, it is confident that the
result will be the same.</TE>
<TE>   "We view this only as an eleventh-hour move to distract the
debate," the State Department official said of Hussein's offer. "Our
message to others on the Security Council: We need to stay the
course. He is only reacting as we're unified in our approach."</TE>
<TE>   But analysts predict that Iraq's move may change the timing of the
conflict--dragging it out over many months rather than wrapping it up
quickly--and add to the diplomatic burden for the U.S. in seeing it
through.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing is now likely to happen immediately," said Yaphe, the
Iraq expert.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a TV show with a quiet denouement."</TE>
<TE>   Already, Iraq on Tuesday brought up old arguments that implied
some limits on the inspections. Deputy Prime Minister Tarik Aziz,
Hussein's front man with the outside world, said the U.N. teams
should finish within a "reasonable time" and not overstep their
mission.</TE>
<TE>   He also said the inspections should culminate with the lifting of
U.N. economic sanctions--never mentioning a host of other U.N.
resolutions, covering issues ranging from the release of prisoners to
human rights violations, that Bush told the United Nations must be
enforced.</TE>

<HD>2 Top ETA Suspects Arrested in France</HD>
<DH>Europe: Spanish official says the men gave orders in the
separatist group blamed for violence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>MADRID</DL>
<LD>Spain said Tuesday that two top leaders of the Basque separatist
group ETA had been arrested in a police swoop in southwestern France,
and officials called the development a major blow against the
outlawed organization.</LD>
<LD>   "Today is a very important day in the fight against terrorism,"
Interior Minister Angel Acebes said, confirming the arrest near
Bordeaux on Monday night of ETA suspects Juan Antonio Olarra Guridi,
35, and Ainhoa Mugica, 32.</LD>
<LD>   Olarra and Mugica "were the ones who gave the orders, provided all
the material for the attacks ... and most importantly, they were the
ones who selected the targets," Acebes said, describing them as top
leaders.</LD>
<TE>   However, ETA is known not to rely on a vertical command structure,
using committees of leaders instead, which has enabled it to
withstand high-level arrests.</TE>
<TE>   Olarra had 20 arrest warrants outstanding against him, 11 of them
international warrants, Acebes said.</TE>
<TE>   Mugica was wanted on nine national and three international arrest
warrants, the interior minister said.</TE>
<TE>   Both are named on European Union and U.S. lists of wanted
international terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   ETA stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom. The group is blamed
for more than 800 killings during its 34-year-old campaign of
bombings and shootings aimed at carving an independent Basque
homeland out of territory straddling northern Spain and southwestern
France.</TE>

<HD>Catholic Bishops Oppose a Unilateral War on Iraq</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY B. STAMMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Leaders of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops are questioning
the moral legitimacy of a war with Iraq and urged President Bush to
"step back from the brink."</LD>
<LD>   In a letter Friday to the White House made public Tuesday, the
60-member Administrative Committee of the Roman Catholic bishops
conference drew a sharp line between U.S. military action over the
last year in Afghanistan and a preemptive war with Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Bishop Wilton Gregory, president of the conference, said Catholic
bishops have "serious questions about the moral legitimacy of any
preemptive, unilateral use of military force to overthrow the
government of Iraq."</LD>
<TE>   "Given the precedents and risk involved, we find it difficult to
justify extending the war on terrorism to Iraq, absent clear and
adequate evidence of Iraqi involvement in the attacks of Sept. 11 or
of an imminent attack of a grave nature," Gregory wrote in the
letter. He ended with a plea: "We respectfully urge you to step back
from the brink of war."</TE>
<TE>   The letter was the latest warning by religious leaders over such a
war. Last week, 48 Protestant, Orthodox and Anglican clergy
challenged a first strike against Iraq by the U.S., calling talk of a
preemptive blow alarming. Their letter was sent through Churches for
Middle East Peace, which in the past has raised objections to U.S.
policy in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   Among those signing that letter were the presiding bishops of the
Episcopal Church and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America,
leaders in the Presbyterian Church (USA) and the United Methodist
Church, the National Baptist Convention's president, and the general
secretary of the National Council of Churches.</TE>
<TE>   The Catholic statement was approved last week, before Bush's
speech Thursday at the United Nations in which he urged the world
body to join the U.S. in taking action against Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.</TE>

this month.</LD>
<LD>   The head of parliament's human rights commission, Leonidas
Ntibayazi, said officials in Gitega province reported that the
victims were fleeing clashes between Hutu rebels and the Tutsi-led
army Sept. 9. They took refuge in houses about 75 miles northeast of
the capital, Bujumbura, and were shot to death. There was no

<LD>The U.N. World Food Program suspended operations in northern Uganda
after rebels attacked a food convoy and killed a driver.</LD>
<LD>   The guerrillas, believed to be members of the Lord's Resistance
Army, on Saturday ambushed the convoy of eight trucks, all marked
with WFP flags and traveling with an army escort. The army repulsed
the attack after exchanging fire.</LD>
<LD>   The suspension leaves 120,000 people without food aid. The Lord's
Resistance Army is led by a self-styled prophet who wants to oust the
government and rule by the Ten Commandments.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>To the folks back home, it's the small things that magnify the
absence of loved ones serving as Army reservists in Afghanistan. It's
the stuff they never thought about when the part-time soldiers were
in Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   "My son was mowing the lawn the other day, and a pebble broke the
front window," said Ana Hernandez of Hacienda Heights.</LD>
<LD>   Her husband, Army Sgt. 1st Class Victor Hernandez, normally
handles such matters, but he is in Afghanistan. "It's 6 o'clock at
night. Where am I going to find someone to put in a window?"</LD>
<TE>   Her husband, a postal worker, has been away from home before,
spending nine months in Germany during the 1991 Persian Gulf War and
seven months in Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1997. This time, Ana Hernandez
said, his absence seems more profound, particularly for the couple's
five children, ages 10 to 21.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, they were little and didn't quite understand," she said.
"Now that they're older, I think it's harder for them. They really
look up to him a lot, especially for their homework."</TE>
<TE>   Marissa Reyes of Torrance, whose husband is in his third month of
duty in Afghanistan, said the couple's second-grade son repeatedly
asks where his father is.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a young kid, and we try to explain things.... But it's still
a problem," she said.</TE>
<TE>   There also are financial considerations for some families;
military pay is often much less than a regular salary.</TE>
<TE>   The Postal Service discontinued Hernandez's pay while he is
overseas, his wife said. And she has been off work as a part-time
retail clerk since hurting her back a week after he left. The family
is living on her husband's military pay and a small disability check
she receives. That amounts to half their pre-deployment income.</TE>
<TE>   She has invoked a federal law allowing deferment of some bills for
families of military personnel stationed overseas. "We did have some
money saved up, and that's been what we've been using," she said.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't take long for families to tire of the separation.</TE>
<TE>   "In the first month ... I felt kind of lost and depressed," said
Pam Hicklin, whose husband, Tom, is nearing the end of a 90-day
deployment in Afghanistan. "And then I got to the point where I was
feeling all right and handling things, and then felt like a lot of
responsibility that we used to share had suddenly been tossed upon
me."</TE>
<TE>   Now she's preparing for the separation to end, which comes with
its own stresses.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband was also called up for service in Operation Desert
Storm and in Bosnia. She remembers meeting him in Germany near the
end of his Bosnia assignment and experiencing a sense of strangeness
when she saw him.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything was new," she said. "He picked me up from the airport,
and it was awkward and strange with him. It felt like this was my
husband, but not."</TE>
<TE>   This time, she's determined to bridge the distance, which seems
vast despite daily e-mail contact. "I told him that, when he comes
back, we're going to make a pact not to get angry with each other for
the first two weeks," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Hicklin, an assistant professor of clinical psychiatry and
behavioral sciences at USC's Keck School of Medicine, heads a unit in
Afghanistan that works with soldiers enduring the strains of battle,
separation and the transition home.</TE>
<TE>   The irony is not lost on his wife. "Who's here to help me in
dealing with it?" she said from the couple's home in Pasadena, which
they share with their 20-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   Still, many families aren't questioning their loved ones'
decisions to be part-time soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   The 10 siblings of 23-year-old Sgt. Ricardo Ramirez of La Puente
are content with his being overseas, especially because he is working
to become a U.S. citizen. But they recognize the dangers of his
presence in a place as volatile as Afghanistan. Ramirez's brother and
sisters haven't told their mother, who doesn't speak or read English,
where he is stationed.</TE>
<TE>   "We were going to tell her last week," acknowledged his sister,
Isabel Alcaraz. "But we haven't. We told her he is in Egypt.
Eventually, we will tell her."</TE>

<HD>Al Qaeda Behind Indonesia Bombings, Agent Says</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Captured Kuwaiti says the network attacked
churches and plotted an assassination.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>Al Qaeda is responsible for a series of deadly church bombings in
Indonesia and plotted the assassination of President Megawati
Sukarnoputri, according to the confession of a top agent from the
terrorist network caught here.</LD>
<LD>   Omar Faruq, a Kuwaiti who described himself as Al Qaeda's senior
representative in Southeast Asia, said the group hoped to trigger a
religious civil war in Indonesia that would lead to the formation of
a "pure Islamic state," according to a confidential U.S. document
obtained Tuesday by The Times.</LD>
<LD>   Faruq's statements indicate that Al Qaeda has been much more
active in Indonesia than the government has been willing to
acknowledge. Top officials have repeatedly denied that terrorists
have been operating in Indonesia, the world's most populous Islamic
country.</LD>
<TE>   At the same time, Faruq's confession suggests that the terrorists
have had a high failure rate in Indonesia. Various assassination and
bomb plots were either bungled by the operatives or foiled by
security measures taken to protect U.S. facilities, according to the
electronic copy of the document summarizing his interrogation.</TE>
<TE>   Faruq said he was sent to Southeast Asia by top Al Qaeda leaders
in Afghanistan to plan "large-scale attacks" against U.S. interests
in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan,
Vietnam and Cambodia.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesian intelligence agents arrested Faruq in early June south
of Jakarta, the capital, and handed him over to the United States. He
was taken to a third country, reportedly Afghanistan, for
interrogation.</TE>
<TE>   One U.S. official said the document is "an accurate report" of
what Faruq told U.S. agents during his interrogation. U.S.
authorities are trying to corroborate his statements.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 9, Faruq told his interrogators that he had set in motion
a plot to bomb U.S. embassies in Asia to mark the anniversary of the
Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   At least one other Al Qaeda operative in custody confirmed his
statement, prompting the United States to shut its embassies in
Indonesia, Malaysia and several other countries and to raise its
terrorism alert to "code orange," the second-highest on a scale of
five.</TE>
<TE>   This week, Time magazine reported many details of Faruq's
confession, including two plots against Megawati and the
establishment of a school on the island of Borneo to train Islamic
militants. The magazine said its report was based on a secret CIA
document and regional intelligence reports.</TE>
<TE>   The document obtained by The Times says that Faruq admitted his
involvement in a plot to shoot Megawati in 1999 before she became
president. Faruq said he was to be the triggerman, according to the
account. The plot also targeted 40 unidentified "prominent citizens,"
the document said. There is no indication that any of the killings
took place.</TE>
<TE>   A second plot against Megawati was planned for August 2001 shortly
after she was elected president, the document says. Faruq said that
bombers planned to blow up Megawati in or near the Atrium mall in
Jakarta but that their device went off prematurely, seriously
injuring the man carrying it.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear, however, whether this attack was aimed at the
president. According to Megawati's office, she was nowhere near the
Atrium building that day. A lawyer for one of the arrested bombing
suspects said this year that they were targeting Christians who they
believed would be gathering at the mall that day.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the document focuses on Faruq's connections with Abu Bakar
Bashir, an Islamic cleric who is accused of heading the terrorist
organization Jemaah Islamiah.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say Jemaah Islamiah planned to blow up the U.S.
Embassy and six other buildings in Singapore last year using truck
bombs driven by suicide bombers. The plot was uncovered, and dozens
of suspects have been arrested in Singapore and Malaysia.</TE>
<TE>   Singapore and Malaysia say Bashir is the head of Jemaah Islamiah
and have sought his arrest, but Indonesian officials say they have no
evidence against him. The U.S. government is considering adding the
group to its list of international terrorist organizations.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Tuesday, Bashir denied that he had ever been
involved in terrorist activity and said that he had never met Faruq.</TE>
<TE>   "My ability is proselytizing and teaching. That's it," Bashir
said. "So, that information is absolutely untrue. It's a big lie!"</TE>
<TE>   According to the document, Faruq said that Al Qaeda encouraged
Bashir's goal of sparking "a religious civil war in Indonesia in
order to achieve his vision of a pure Islamic state under Islamic
law."</TE>
<TE>   Bashir's plan of "training jihadists and massing weapons and
ammunition" has been coordinated with a senior lieutenant of Osama
bin Laden known as Rashid, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of militant Muslims have traveled to the Molucca Islands
in eastern Indonesia to fight Christians in a religious war that has
killed as many as 10,000 people. Faruq admitted that he plotted to
blow up a Christian gathering hall there in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Faruq also told interrogators that he was the mastermind of a
series of 24 near-simultaneous church bombings on Christmas Eve 2000
that killed 19 people and injured more than 100. "These bombings were
planned with the complete knowledge, approval and logistical support"
of Bashir, Faruq said, according to the document.</TE>
<TE>   Police say that Riduan Isamuddin, a cleric and longtime friend of
Bashir, organized at least 13 of the bombings. Also known as Hambali,
he is a top Jemaah Islamiah leader with close ties to Al Qaeda. He is
wanted in Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia.</TE>
<TE>   Faruq also said that Bashir ordered the bombing of the Istiqlal
mosque in Jakarta and blamed it on Christians "to foment sectarian
strife."</TE>
<TE>   Bashir denied any part in any bombings and was particularly
incensed by the charge that he had arranged for the bombing of a
mosque. "I say the American officials and intelligence agents are
crazy. They are crude infidels. How could I bomb Istiqlal mosque? I
challenge them to prove it."</TE>

<HD>Russia, France Say No New Resolution on Iraq Is Needed</HD>
<DH>Dispute: Again dismissing Hussein's offer, U.S. presses for
firmer action by U.N. Inspectors prepare for return to Baghdad.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAGGIE FARLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>Russia and France on Tuesday questioned the need for a new U.N.
resolution authorizing military force against Iraq now that President
Saddam Hussein's regime has agreed to let weapons inspectors back
into his country.</LD>
<LD>   But as U.N. weapons inspectors and Iraqi arms experts moved ahead
with plans for the monitors' return, U.S. officials dismissed Iraq's
offer as a "diversion" and urged Security Council members not to take
Baghdad at its word.</LD>
<LD>   Wary that the Iraqi offer is reopening a rift in the Security
Council after it briefly unified on Iraq policy this week, President
Bush warned Tuesday that the world "must not be fooled" by Hussein's
latest move to let inspectors return.</LD>
<TE>   Bush echoed the challenge he made at the United Nations on
Thursday that helped spark the international community to confront
Iraq's decade of defiance.</TE>
<TE>   "The United Nations must act," he said. "It's time to determine
whether or not they'll be a force for good and peace or an
ineffective debating society."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials were confident that they could pass a tough new
resolution "within days," even though Russia's foreign minister
declared another U.N. measure unnecessary if inspectors can be
quickly dispatched to Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "From our standpoint, we don't need any special resolution for
[inspections] to occur," Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov said here,
adding that the U.N. has already made "all the necessary resolutions,
all the necessary decisions about that."</TE>
<TE>   Ivanov's comments were echoed by French Foreign Minister Dominique
de Villepin, who agreed that the focus should be not on a new
resolution but the quick return of inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   Russia and France are among the five permanent members, who have
veto power, on the Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   The full 15-member council requested a meeting with chief weapons
inspector Hans Blix today to hear what monitors would require before
they could start searching for suspected biological, chemical and
nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Blix, the executive chairman of the U.N. Monitoring, Verification
and Inspection Commission, met Tuesday night with his Iraqi
counterparts to discuss "practical arrangements" of the monitors'
return to Iraq. Before the inspectors can set foot on the ground in
the country, the United Nations and Iraq must iron out logistical
issues involving offices, flights, escorts and other planning.</TE>
<TE>   Blix said in a statement that the two sides will meet in Vienna
during the week of Sept. 29. A precise date had not been set so that
Blix would have flexibility to work with the Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   At the United Nations, however, U.S. officials warned that
Hussein's offer fell short because it did not address a host of
concerns raised by past U.N. resolutions, including the elimination
of all weapons of mass destruction, but merely promised to allow new
inspections.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue is not inspectors," Secretary of State Colin L. Powell
said here Tuesday. "The issue is disarmament."</TE>
<TE>   Washington is pushing for one or two new U.N. resolutions that
would contain at least three elements: to record Iraqi breaches of 16
past U.N. resolutions, specify what Iraq must do to fulfill its U.N.
obligations and spell out the consequences if Hussein's regime fails
to cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   Powell urged Security Council members to support a new resolution
to ensure that Iraq does not return to "business as usual."</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot just take a one-and-a-quarter-page letter signed by the
[Iraqi] foreign minister as the end of this matter," Powell said at a
U.N. briefing. "We have seen this game before."</TE>
<TE>   The United States aims to expand the inspectors' mandate to
include complete access to "presidential sites," which the U.N.
previously accepted as off-limits, without Iraqi escorts and without
warning, and to clear the way for military intervention at the first
sign of obstruction.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Iraqis agreed Monday night to allow inspectors to
return, the debate centered on whether the U.N. terms should be
contained in one resolution or two. A French proposal suggested
holding up the debate on a second measure until after Iraq had
breached the first--an arrangement the U.S. feared would cause
needless delays.</TE>
<TE>   If the other Security Council members would not accept a single
"front-loaded" resolution that included consequences for Iraq, the
U.S. hoped to link the two resolutions so that the second would kick
in without debate after a breach of the first, a State Department
official said.</TE>
<TE>   But Iraq's swift response--helped along by U.S. threats of war and
pressure from Arab allies and Russia--has changed that debate.</TE>
<TE>   Arab leaders, who are concerned about the instability an attack on
Iraq would bring to the region, echoed Ivanov's statements and
resisted U.S. attempts to introduce other unresolved issues--from the
return of Kuwaiti war prisoners to human rights--into the debate.</TE>
<TE>   "After the letter of the Iraqi government accepting the
unconditional return of the inspectors, I see no need for another
Security Council resolution," said Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed
Maher. "I think we should pursue this solution without straying into
other alleys or raising other matters."</TE>
<TE>   Other U.S. allies, particularly Germany, have been urging the U.S.
to stop its military "adventure" against Hussein. German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder has made Iraq an issue in his fight for reelection
Sunday, as polls show that 80% of the German population opposes
following the U.S. into a war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "The important thing now is that we do not let slip this chance
for a political, nonconfrontational and cooperative new order in the
Middle East," Schroeder said.</TE>
<TE>   For many at the United Nations, the best opportunity to avoid
armed conflict is to let the weapons inspectors do their job.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. statement released after Tuesday's meeting between Blix,
the chief weapons inspector, and two Iraqi officials said Hussein's
representatives had agreed to consider national legislation
prohibiting any activities leading to the creation of weapons of mass
destruction, as required by U.N. resolutions. The Iraqis also
promised to file more than half a dozen overdue reports on imported
dual-use items and changes in former weapons sites.</TE>
<TE>   There was no word on when the inspectors would return to Iraq, but
Blix said in an interview last week that he could have an advance
team on the ground within a week. It would take at least a month to
procure proper equipment and 60 days to reestablish a baseline for
inspections, he said.</TE>
<TE>   When the teams are fully operational, they have 120 days to report
to the council about whether Iraq is cooperating and about their
progress on any remaining banned weapons issues.</TE>

<HD>N. Korea Admits Kidnappings</HD>
<DH>Asia: Kim tells Koizumi that eight of 12 abducted Japanese
have died. His acknowledgment and apology pave the way for talks on
establishing ties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALERIE REITMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Years after the mysterious disappearances of at least a dozen
citizens from its shores, Japan on Tuesday got a grim revelation
about their fates--and an apology--from reclusive North Korean leader
Kim Jong Il.</LD>
<LD>   The victims were indeed kidnapped by North Korea in the 1970s and
1980s to assist spies in infiltrating South Korea. Eight have since
died of undisclosed "disease or disaster"--including Megumi Yokota,
who disappeared from a coastal path in 1977 at age 13 while walking
home from school badminton practice and was never heard from again.</LD>
<LD>   Four are alive and living in North Korea.</LD>
<TE>   It was an extraordinary revelation for Kim to make to Japanese
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi during the first summit between the
two long-estranged nations. It was also a reversal of North Korea's
repeated denials that it had abducted Japanese citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Kim's seeming candor and his apology paved the way for the two
countries to agree to begin discussions next month aimed at
establishing diplomatic relations. Koizumi had made it clear that
negotiations on other issues would fail if North Korea didn't come
clean about the kidnappings.</TE>
<TE>   In the discussions, Kim admitted to Koizumi that a North Korean
"organization with a special mission" abducted the Japanese, saying
it did so without his knowledge. Kim said he has punished those
involved, and he vowed that nothing of the kind would happen again.</TE>
<TE>   Kim also agreed to extend North Korea's moratorium on nuclear
missile testing through "2003 and beyond." In addition, spy ships
that recently ventured into Japanese waters--including one sunk by
Japan's coast guard in December--were probably "elements of the North
Korean military" that Kim vowed to investigate and prevent from
straying again. And he asked the Japanese leader to tell the Bush
administration that the North is ready to resume stalled negotiations
with the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Koizumi apologized to North Korea for Japan's brutal
35-year occupation of the Korean peninsula, which began in 1910.</TE>
<TE>   Koizumi said that although the summit didn't solve "all the issues
between Japan and North Korea," he saw positive signs for the future.
"I came with the hope to bring peace to the region to prevent these
things from happening again," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nick Eberstadt, a longtime North Korea watcher at the conservative
American Enterprise Institute in Washington, heralded the summit as a
"complete change" in the diplomatic posture of Kim's government,
which, he said, in the past has involved "lying about everything
unapologetically and energetically."</TE>
<TE>   "To have North Korea for the first time in its history not lie
about one of its misdeeds will give enormous hope to the proponents
of engagement," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, one motivation for Kim is getting more aid to overhaul
his barely functioning economy and feed his starving people. Japan is
said to be discussing $300 million to $500 million in aid if talks
proceed, and the amount may climb.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not just the cash that will be important. There is an
expectation that the Japanese government will build highways and
power plants and communication systems," said Jo Dong Ho of the Korea
Development Institute, a think tank in Seoul sponsored by the South
Korean government.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea has given the North hundreds of millions of dollars
since President Kim Dae Jung hugged and toasted with Kim Jong Il two
years ago at a summit in Pyongyang, the North's capital.</TE>
<TE>   The North Korean leader also may be trying to placate the Bush
administration, which has lumped North Korea with Iraq and Iran as an
"axis of evil" because of its alleged attempts to produce nuclear
weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "North Korea understands the situation they're going to be in if
the United States targets North Korea after Iraq," said Kaoru
Murakami, an independent international relations analyst in Tokyo who
has written extensively about North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   In Japan, the summit's diplomatic advances were overshadowed by
the news that so many of the kidnapping victims had died.</TE>
<TE>   Television news stations provided round-the-clock coverage of the
one-day summit, and newspapers issued special editions with word of
the dead. Many tearful interviews with the families of the kidnapping
victims were shown.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives of the missing expected that, at worst, they would get
no word. No one was prepared to hear that many were dead.</TE>
<TE>   "North Korea kept saying it had no involvement, and now we can't
believe them that she's really dead, leaving out all the details of
how she was taken, how she married, how she died," said a sobbing
Shigeru Yokota, father of Megumi Yokota.</TE>
<TE>   The Yokotas did learn that they are grandparents: Megumi has a
daughter living in North Korea who confirmed the death.</TE>
<TE>   Pyongyang said Tuesday that the Japanese were taken to teach North
Koreans the Japanese language and to provide false identities. North
Koreans who were believed to be Japanese would more likely gain entry
to South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   But many questions remain unanswered. Why are so many dead, when
many of those kidnapped would now be just in their late 40s? What
were they made to do? How did North Korean agents arrive in and get
away from Japan without being noticed? Were the victims killed to
keep them from talking about the incidents? Are they really dead?</TE>
<TE>   And how, in an authoritarian nation as tightly controlled as North
Korea, could Kim Jong Il not have known about the kidnappings?</TE>
<TE>   The victims' families watched the summit together in a room in the
parliament building, with TV news cameras trained on them. In the
afternoon, they were taken to a Foreign Ministry guest house and
briefed individually by top officials on the fate of family members.</TE>
<TE>   Japan had demanded to know the whereabouts of 11 citizens
allegedly kidnapped from Honshu, Kyushu and Shikoku islands. Of
those, the North Koreans reported that two couples are alive.</TE>
<TE>   Yasushi Chimura, then a 23-year-old apprentice carpenter, and his
fiancee, Fukie Hamamoto, a clothing shop employee, also 23 at the
time, disappeared July 7, 1978, after dining in a restaurant to
celebrate their engagement. Their car was found near the sea in Fukui
prefecture in western Japan. The family was told that they are now
married and have three children.</TE>
<TE>   College student Kaoru Hasuike, then 20, and Yukiko Okudo, 22, a
cosmetician, vanished from the coast of Niigata prefecture on July
31, 1978, after telling relatives that they were going on a date.
Hasuike's bicycle was found at the library near the coast where they
were supposed to meet. They are alive and married with two children,
and Hasuike is an interpreter in a research organization.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Megumi Yokota, the dead include:</TE>
<TE>   * Keiko Arimoto, then 23, disappeared after writing her parents
from Copenhagen in 1983 to say she had been offered a good job. This
year, the former wife of one of nine Japanese who hijacked a Japan
Airlines jet to North Korea in 1970 told a court that she helped
abduct Arimoto.</TE>
<TE>   * Shuichi Ichikawa, 23, a public corporation employee, and Rumiko
Masumoto, 24, an office clerk, went missing on Aug. 12, 1978, after
telling relatives that they were going to the beach to watch the
sunset in Kagoshima, on the southern island of Kyushu.</TE>
<TE>   * Tadaaki Hara, 43, a cook, disappeared in June 1980 from Miyazaki
City on Kyushu. A South Korean court found that a Northern agent had
abducted Hara and shipped him to North Korea, then tried to acquire a
Japanese passport by impersonating him.</TE>
<TE>   * Also, an unnamed Tokyo club hostess, 24 or 25, went missing in
1978 or 1979 after dropping her two children off at a day care
center. Japanese authorities think she taught Japanese to a North
Korean agent convicted in the bombing of a Korean Air jet in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea offered two names of men that hadn't been on Japan's
official list of victims. Toru Ishioka, then 23, of Sapporo, had
traveled to Europe in March 1980. He disappeared after sending a
letter postmarked from Vienna. In September 1988, his family received
a letter from him saying he was living in North Korea with Arimoto
and Kaoru Matsuki.</TE>
<TE>   Matsuki, whom North Korea also said was dead, had left Japan for
Spain in April 1980 to study Spanish. He disappeared after sending a
letter to his family from Madrid around that time.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea said it had no information about Hiroshi Kume, 52, a
Tokyo security guard who disappeared from the Sea of Japan coast in
September 1977, and couldn't confirm whether he had been abducted. A
North Korean living in Japan allegedly confessed to helping a North
Korean agent abduct Kume.</TE>
<TE>   Even the families of the four reported to be alive said they
couldn't rejoice at the news, particularly since all 11 families have
been through so much together.</TE>
<TE>   "If this had been 10 years earlier, everybody would have been
alive, and now only a few are," said Kazuo Okudo, father of Yukiko
Okudo. "I can't be happy just because my daughter was found alive. I
need to actually see my daughter and decide after I see her alive and
see how she's living."</TE>

<HD>Bomb Injures 5 Arab Children; Jewish Settlers Are Blamed</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Blast occurs at a West Bank school. U.S. and
global partners offer a three-phase peace plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>HEBRON, West Bank</DL>
<LD>A bomb exploded in a West Bank school Tuesday, wounding five
Palestinian children, and Israeli police and Palestinian officials
said they believed that extremist Jewish settlers were behind the
blast.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli military officials said the explosion occurred in the
courtyard of an elementary school in the West Bank village of Yatta,
south of the city of Hebron.</LD>
<LD>   A second bomb was found and safely detonated.</LD>
<TE>   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in the West Bank, a 14-year-old Palestinian was killed
in the Tulkarm refugee camp when a bomb he was apparently making blew
up, Palestinian security officials said.</TE>
<TE>   As the violence continued, the U.S. and its key global partners in
Mideast peacemaking met at the United Nations in New York and agreed
to attempt to establish a provisional Palestinian state next year.</TE>
<TE>   They issued a communique outlining three phases, with the aim of a
final settlement between Israel and the Palestinians being reached by
2005.</TE>
<TE>   It specifies that Israel should end its occupation of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip but does not say whether Israel should give up
all land the Arabs lost in the 1967 Middle East War.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is there a direct reference to Jerusalem, part of which
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat expects to become the
capital of a Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   To prepare for a state, the document also suggests that the
Palestinians adopt a constitution with provisions to stop corruption
and to provide "the vibrant political system which Palestinians
deserve."</TE>
<TE>   The communique was the first major political document by "the
quartet," an ad hoc enterprise of the European Union, Russia, the
U.N. and the U.S. to bring an end to the Mideast impasse.</TE>
<TE>   Five Arab nations, Israel and the Palestinian Authority also
participated.</TE>

<HD>Rioters Attack Factory in Nigeria</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LAGOS, Nigeria</DL>
<LD>Thousands of rioters burned and looted a factory complex in Lagos
after an accidental fire killed at least 15 workers, witnesses said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Managers for the Chinese company that owns the factories fended
off rioters trying to invade their offices by pulling guns, general
manager Mun Kwan Lai said.</LD>
<LD>   "They were throwing stones, banging on the gates while the place
was still on fire," Lai said. "They had iron pipes and were arming
themselves with whatever was on the ground."</LD>
<TE>   The fire probably was caused by an electrical problem, assistant
general manager David Guo said. The six factories in the complex made
goods ranging from sandals to cutlery.</TE>
<TE>   Rioters were angered by accusations that the doomed workers had
been trapped behind exit doors locked by managers.</TE>
<TE>   Lai denied the accusation.</TE>
<TE>   Police said that 10 people were arrested for looting but that
thousands had been involved.</TE>

<HD>Leader Pledges to Rid Pakistan of Al Qaeda</HD>
<DH>Asia: After turning over a key suspect, Musharraf declares
he'll continue to hunt foreign terrorists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>One day after turning over key Sept. 11 suspect Ramzi Binalshibh to
American authorities, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf on Tuesday
vowed to root out any Al Qaeda operatives remaining in his nation and
promised that foreigners among them would be handed to the United
States or other countries to face justice.</LD>
<LD>   Al Qaeda fighters who fled Afghanistan after the fall of the
Taliban regime last year will be hunted down and will not be allowed
to make themselves comfortable in Pakistan, Musharraf said in two
appearances in this southern port city where security forces last
week killed two Al Qaeda suspects and captured 10 others.</LD>
<LD>   Musharraf revealed that the captives included a Saudi, an Egyptian
and eight Yemenis. Binalshibh and four others were given over to U.S.
custody Monday; five remain in Pakistan undergoing interrogation by
the Inter-Services Intelligence, the country's security agency.</LD>
<TE>   Associated Press quoted an unnamed Pakistani senior security
source Tuesday as saying that one of the five held by the Pakistanis
has been tentatively identified as the killer of Daniel Pearl, the
Wall Street Journal correspondent kidnapped here in January and later
slain. Pearl had been working on a story about Richard C. Reid, the
Briton accused of trying to detonate a shoe bomb last December on a
flight from Paris to Miami.</TE>
<TE>   According to the AP report, the detainee, a Yemeni, is a suspected
member of the Al Qaeda terrorist network who allegedly killed Pearl
three days after the journalist tried to escape his captors.
Authorities have long suspected an Al Qaeda link to the killing,
although the four men convicted of kidnapping and murdering Pearl
were Pakistanis affiliated with militant Islamic groups.</TE>
<TE>   The AP report said that the same man who led police to Pearl's
body in a shallow grave in Karachi, Fazal Karim, was taken to see the
suspected Al Qaeda members captured by police last week and fingered
one of them as Pearl's killer. The police official quoted, however,
did not identify the alleged killer by name.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf used his two-day visit here to underline his
determination to rid Pakistan of the Islamic extremists who have also
targeted him and his military government.</TE>
<TE>   The president called the raids that netted Binalshibh a "great
achievement." Binalshibh, a Yemeni national, admitted being the
coordinator of the Sept. 11 attacks in an interview with
Arab-language television network Al Jazeera that aired last week
before the raid.</TE>
<TE>   A city of about 14 million people with some neighborhoods so
lawless that they are practically off-limits to police, Karachi would
seem to be the ideal haven for Al Qaeda militants.</TE>
<TE>   They could hide in Afghan refugee enclaves and draw support from
militant Islamic groups that have proliferated in recent years,
stoked by popular rancor at the perceived injustices suffered by
Muslims in the portion of the Himalayan region of Kashmir held by
India rather than Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   "We have committed ourselves to this war on terrorism, and
whatever we have promised we will do," Musharraf told journalists.
"We will not allow Al Qaeda to operate here. Pakistan will continue
to hunt them down."</TE>
<TE>   Later, dedicating a new private Islamic bank, Musharraf said he
did not think there are a large number of Al Qaeda operatives in the
country. But however many there are, he said, "we will make sure that
they cannot use Pakistan as a base."</TE>

<HD>Shanghai Port, Firm Sign Deal</HD>
<DH>Asia: China's largest container terminal will be managed by
a Sino- Danish partnership.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHING-CHING NI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SHANGHAI</DL>
<LD>The world's fastest-growing port city joined hands with a leading
global transportation conglomerate Tuesday to manage China's largest
container terminal.</LD>
<LD>   The partnership between Shanghai and Denmark's APM Terminals
signals the enormous interest of multinational firms in capitalizing
on Shanghai's extraordinary growth. It also marks the rising
importance of Shanghai as a regional economic powerhouse.</LD>
<LD>   Few ports' growth could compare with the meteoric rise of Shanghai
from a backwater about a decade ago to one of the world's biggest
trading hubs.</LD>
<TE>   In 1995, Shanghai ranked 20th in the world, but booming
international trade moved it to No. 5 this year. If the growth
continues, the city is expected to rank No. 3 in a few years and
eventually upset leaders Hong Kong and Singapore.</TE>
<TE>   "Shanghai is kind of the new kid on the block in this industry,"
said Richard Nicholson, general manager for development in China for
A.P. Moller Group, the shipping giant's parent company. "But Shanghai
is on the way up and fast."</TE>
<TE>   With the exception of last year, when the impact of the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks slowed the pace of growth to about 13%, container
traffic at the port has expanded more than 20% every year for the
last 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   "At that rate, the new terminal is going to be full in another two
years or so," Nicholson said. "They will need to build more."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Shanghai plans to begin construction next year of a
deep-water port on an island southeast of the city. When completed,
it will substantially expand the city's container capacity and cement
its role as an international shipping center.</TE>
<TE>   Without a new port, it will be tough for Shanghai to compete
effectively against its regional rivals, including third-place South
Korea and fourth-place Taiwan, in terms of size or efficiency.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, as mainland China's largest port, Shanghai will
continue to be overtaxed by a bustling domestic cargo market and
increasing regional trade now that China has joined the World Trade
Organization. The new terminal, which is expected to receive its
first ship's call in February, will be the largest in the current
port of Shanghai. It will help speed up the turnaround time for
larger vessels that are hampered by the Shanghai harbor's relatively
shallow waters.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect the [new terminal] to lead China in performance and
efficiency," Lu Haihu, Shanghai Port director, said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   APM Terminals operates more than 30 public terminals, including
one at the Port of Los Angeles. The choice of running these two
Pacific Rim piers was no accident.</TE>
<TE>   "Of all the action in world trade, the biggest by far is the
transpacific trade," Nicholson said.</TE>

<HD>Koreas Celebrate Groundbreaking for Railroad Lines in DMZ</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>Hopeful that this time the long-stalled project will go forward,
South Korea today celebrated the groundbreaking of railroad lines
through the demilitarized zone that would reconnect the North and
South Korean lines after more than half a century.</LD>
<LD>   The North Koreans reportedly were holding simultaneous ceremonies
on their side of the 2 1/2-mile-wide strip that divides the two
nations.</LD>
<LD>   Barely in time for the groundbreaking, the North and South Korean
militaries Tuesday hammered out an agreement at the truce village of
Panmunjom to allow construction workers into the heavily
mine-infested no man's land to start work.</LD>
<TE>   The work is supposed to start Thursday with the clearing of land
mines. The ambitious schedule calls for the railroads to open next
year, but for the first roads alongside the lines to be ready as
early as November.</TE>
<TE>   In the agreement reached Tuesday, South Korea said it would
provide $40 million worth of construction materials to North Korea
for its part of the project. The project, one of the hallmarks of
South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's "sunshine policy" of engagement
with North Korea, has stalled so many times over the last two years
that cynics have questioned whether it will ever be completed.</TE>
<TE>   The groundbreaking today, coinciding with Tuesday's historic
summit in Pyongyang between North Korean leader Kim Jong Il and
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, gave heart to those who
hope that the North is emerging from the extreme isolation of the
past.</TE>
<TE>   "The question will be not the groundbreaking itself, but what
happens after the groundbreaking," said a senior U.S. military
official involved with the project.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea arranged much of the fanfare for the ceremonies, which
took place simultaneously at multiple locations near the DMZ.</TE>
<TE>   At Dorasan Station, the northernmost stop on the truncated South
Korean railroad line, a train was decorated with a banner reading,
"The Iron Horse wants to keep going"--a slogan expressing the hope
that South Koreans might be able to take a train all the way to
Pyongyang, the North's capital. The project calls for the connecting
of two separate railroad lines--one that runs near the west coast of
the peninsula between the capitals of the estranged Koreas and the
other along the east coast. The countries hope to have a temporary
road ready this year along the east coast so that South Korean
tourists can visit the North Korean resort of Mt. Kumgang by land.</TE>
<TE>   The deal came out of the June 2000 summit between the North and
South Korean presidents. But while South Korea has completed much of
the construction, North Korea has balked at its part of the bargain.
The North Koreans still need to build more than seven miles of
railroad on the western line and almost 11 miles on the east coast.
If all goes as scheduled, the North and South portions of the
railroads should be connected in the middle of the DMZ next year.</TE>
<TE>   The dream is that one or both of the railroads would connect with
Chinese lines and with the trans-Siberian railway into
Russia--transforming the Korean peninsula into a transportation hub.</TE>

<HD>In Afghanistan, Reservists' Duties Expand</HD>
<DH>Military: Americans who were activated make up about a
quarter of the U.S. force in the Asian nation. Their families and
finances are on hold.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BAGRAM, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>He can handle the monotony, deal with the heat and dust, and dodge
the scorpions and bloodsucking camel spiders. It's the uncertainty
that bothers Maj. Valvincent Reyes.</LD>
<LD>   Reyes, an Army reservist who is a Los Angeles County probation
officer in civilian life, was activated in June and feels proud of
his role in the war effort here--screening soldiers for
combat-related stress disorders.</LD>
<LD>   But Reyes doesn't know when he'll be reunited with his wife and
three children in Torrance. He's already missed three birthdays and
may be absent for his older daughter's high school graduation in the
spring.</LD>
<TE>   "In the back of our minds--we know we're always helping others,
and we're wondering who is going to help us," said Reyes, who is
attached to the Army Reserve's 113th Medical Company. "Our families
want to know more about our length of time here."</TE>
<TE>   When they joined the reserves, most of the men and women here did
not expect that they would be sent thousands of miles away for as
long as two years. But in today's era of a slimmed-down military and
greater global commitments, middle-aged and middle-class Americans
increasingly are being separated from spouses and children for
extended overseas duty. They often serve longer abroad than full-time
soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   Reyes' concerns are typical among the 2,000 activated reservists
and National Guard troops serving at this wind-blown military base in
the desert north of the Afghan capital, Kabul. Though proud to be
serving, they fret over family, finances, jobs and the length of
their tour.</TE>
<TE>   By filling support functions, reservists do more than grease the
wheels of the base machinery. They are its wheels. Reserve units sort
mail, treat and transport the wounded, build barracks and arrange the
installation's complex supply logistics. All told, reservists
represent about a quarter of the U.S. forces in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   It's not that reservists are surprised to have been called up.
Given the military's increased reliance on its 1.25 million
reservists, many knew that it was just a matter of time. A possible
U.S. military campaign against Iraq has only increased the odds.</TE>
<TE>   "Reserves are now 80% of the medical assets of the U.S. Army,"
Reyes said, "so we were primed to come after 9/11. We knew we'd be
called up."</TE>
<TE>   What they didn't know was for how long.</TE>
<TE>   "I came thinking I'd be here only six months, and now I'll
probably be extended," said Sgt. Ricardo Ramirez of La Puente, who
arrived in Afghanistan on July 11. His 109th Army Veterinarian unit
tests food for possible spoilage and cares for bomb-sniffing dogs.
Ramirez said the uncertainty sometimes causes his girlfriend back
home to cry when they talk on the phone.</TE>
<TE>   He hasn't even told his mother that he is in Afghanistan. She
thinks he's elsewhere in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Whether in war or peacetime, reservists said, when they've been
called up it has usually been for an average of about 6 1/2 months.</TE>
<TE>   But in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, the Pentagon has
invoked rules that permit it to keep reservists on active duty for as
long as two years, and the individual services have begun invoking
that option.</TE>
<TE>   Sgt. Jason Clifford of Atlanta, part of the 310th Chemical
Company, was called up last Oct. 10 and has recently received
notification that he has been extended for a second year.</TE>
<TE>   "When I signed up, I thought, well, the most I'll do if there is a
war is six or seven months," he said. "But I never planned on two
years."</TE>
<TE>   The military's reliance on part-time forces has been increasing
since the late 1980s, when Pentagon planners foresaw tighter budgets
after the Cold War ended. The total of reserve and guard units is now
not much less than the 1.4 million full-time soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   The military may be risking losing reservists by stretching their
active-duty stints--and their patience, said Jay Farrar, a military
analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in
Washington. He said reenlistment data he has seen suggest that
reservists are already leaving the ranks because of the added time
commitment. The U.S. military can ill afford losing reservists.
Despite their "weekend warrior" image, Farrar said, reserve units are
consistently more efficient and cohesive than the regulars.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Dan Stoneking said this month that
each of the reserve branches is on track to meet its enlistment
goals.</TE>
<TE>   Many reservists, including Reyes, suffer no financial hardship
because their employers keep their jobs open and make up the
difference between their civilian and military wages.</TE>
<TE>   Spc. 4 Nikki Prodromos of the 300th Mobile Public Affairs
Detachment is not so lucky. She had to shut down her cleaning
business, give up an apartment she loved and put her possessions in
storage--an expense the Army won't reimburse.</TE>
<TE>   "I hated letting my employees go. Good ones are hard to find. And
I'm now making a third as much as I did with my business," said
Prodromos, who is divorced and lives in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   But the situation cuts both ways. For Ramirez, being called up was
a windfall. He had just been laid off from his industrial painting
job when he was activated. And he thinks that his service in Bagram
will help him find a job when he gets out.</TE>
<TE>   For those with families back home, the time away can be agonizing.
Maj. William Hensell of Phoenix, a 28-year veteran of the reserves,
had never been called up. Neither had his father, who spent 38 years
in the Army Reserve. But here the younger Hensell is, helping manage
supplies with his unit, the 164th Corps Support Group.</TE>
<TE>   "The distance, the lack of communication, leaving my wife alone
are the toughest parts, not being able to help her do the things you
take for granted, like mowing the yard and taking out the laundry,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to her three children and her job as a hospital social
worker, Sgt. Valencia Knox-Davis, a 19-year veteran of the Army
Reserve's 834th Postal Company based in Miami, misses the little
things: sitting on her front porch, eating junk food and watching
football on TV. "I don't think I'll ever get used to it," she said of
life in Afghanistan. "It's rough. The dust especially. It's like
talcum powder that goes everywhere when you step in it."</TE>
<TE>   And yet, for some reservists like Robert Kanyr of Sierra Madre, a
father of two college-age children, there's no better place to be.
The longtime California Highway Patrol officer said that he relishes
active duty and that his wife, Laurie, understands.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the most gratifying thing I've done. I have 30 years in the
reserves and feel privileged that I'm still healthy and able to do
it," said Kanyr, a master sergeant in the 146th Aeromed Evacuation
Squadron of the Air National Guard. "Apart from the dust, life is
good."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Missed a 'Golden Opportunity,' Iranian Says</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Tehran aided war on terrorism, foreign minister
notes, but Bush nonetheless labeled the nation part of an 'axis of
evil.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The United States missed a "golden opportunity" to improve relations
with Iran over the past year as the two nations increased contacts
both publicly and behind the scenes during the war on terrorism in
Afghanistan, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said in an
interview with The Times.</LD>
<LD>   Noting Tehran's cooperation in brokering a post-Taliban government
in Afghanistan and its quiet assistance in tracking Al Qaeda
operatives passing through Iran, Kharrazi said his government was
"shocked" when President Bush labeled Iran one of three nations in an
"axis of evil" during his State of the Union address in January.</LD>
<LD>   "Everyone was thinking that it was [moving] on a positive
course.... We had very good cooperation on Afghanistan with the
United States. Despite these positive moves and our constructive
role, look how they responded. That was a shock for everyone. This
does not produce trust, but mistrust," he said late Monday.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a golden opportunity for the U.S. administration to change
the course and develop better relations, but they failed."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's condemnation of the Iranian government reflected U.S.
concerns about Iran's support for Hamas and Islamic Jihad, two
Palestinian groups that have sponsored suicide bombings against
Israel, as well as for Lebanon's Hezbollah, according to U.S.
officials. Washington also charges that Iran is working on its own
weapons of mass destruction, despite vehement denials from the
government and trips by nuclear and chemical weapons inspectors to
Tehran.</TE>
<TE>   Iran's experience in playing a "positive" role in Afghanistan has
made Tehran wary of what position to take if the United States should
eventually engage militarily across an even more important Iranian
border--with Iraq, Kharrazi said.</TE>
<TE>   Because Iraq used chemical weapons against Iran during their
1980-88 war, Kharrazi said, Tehran shares U.S. concerns about
Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction. But Iran is also deeply
worried about the potential spillover--from political instability in
the region to a mass influx of refugees across the border--in the
event of a U.S. military action against Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   Iran is also uncomfortable with any use of force to change the
regime in Baghdad and supports other options.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing [on which] we certainly differ with the United
States is using force to change the government of another country. We
don't think this is a legitimate right of others, regardless of how
powerful they may be. This is up to the people of Iraq to decide
their future government," said Kharrazi, who served as Iran's U.N.
ambassador from 1989 to 1997.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, however, Kharrazi indicated that Iran would
accept the use of force as a "reality" if a new U.N. resolution
authorizes military action against the regime of Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein. And he said Hussein had failed to prove that his
regime had ended its aggressive intent against neighboring countries.</TE>
<TE>   Kharrazi also said that Iraqis have the right to demand and fight
for greater freedom, and he believes that the majority of Iraqis want
a more representative government.</TE>
<TE>   Tehran allows at least three of the six major Iraqi opposition
groups supported by the United States--the Iraqi National Congress,
the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq and the Patriotic
Union of Kurdistan--to have major offices in Iran. In an exemption
from its economic sanctions on Iran, Washington pays for the office
of the Iraqi National Congress in Tehran.</TE>
<TE>   But in the meantime, Iran will continue to have diplomatic ties
with Iraq and engage in a dialogue, particularly to resolve the many
issues lingering 14 years after the end of the nations' war.</TE>
<TE>   "Our current policy is to solve outstanding issues which remain
from the time of the war, such as prisoners of war. As long as this
regime is in Baghdad, there should be some mechanisms to guarantee
good neighborly relations and no more aggression," Kharrazi said.</TE>
<TE>   After the debate at the United Nations on weapons inspectors,
Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri is scheduled to visit Tehran later
this month, Kharrazi said.</TE>
<TE>   On Iraq, Kharrazi said his government had played a key role in the
arrest last month in Amsterdam of a militant Islamic leader with ties
to Al Qaeda who had set up shop in northern Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Mullah Krekar, whose full name is Najm Din Faraj Ahmad, is the
leader of Ansar al-Islam, a Kurdish rebel group that has developed a
growing presence in northern Iraq since the Sept. 11 attacks. Many of
its fighters, who oppose both the Iraqi regime and the Iraqi
opposition, are believed to have trained with the Al Qaeda terrorist
network in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been very serious with the case of Al Qaeda, as we are
against their ideologies, their tactics and their strategies,"
Kharrazi said. "We have no relations with them and oppose them and
wherever we find them, we arrest them."</TE>
<TE>   The Iranian foreign minister, who is in New York for the U.N.
General Assembly opening session, said Tehran had also acted this
year on tips from the United States identifying areas and specific
buildings used by Al Qaeda members or supporters passing from
Afghanistan and Pakistan through Iran. But he said the intelligence
had proved dated or useless.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan has become a more active border than Iran recently as an
escape route for Al Qaeda supporters in Afghanistan, according to
other Iranian officials.</TE>
<TE>   Iran would welcome additional intelligence collaboration to
apprehend terrorist suspects, Kharrazi said.</TE>
<TE>   "We said any piece of information from any source would be helpful
for us to find these people and arrest them. So if the Americans have
any information, let them give it to us right away."</TE>
<TE>   Kharrazi said Tehran had not closed the door on improving ties
with Washington, which have been frozen since shortly after the 1979
seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. Iranian militants held 52
Americans hostage for 444 days.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly there are ways two countries can solve their problems,
provided there is political will," he said. "We have the political
will provided the Americans are eager to develop better relations
based on mutual respect and equal footing."</TE>
<TE>   He called on Washington to take steps to prove "sincerity and
readiness," including accepting Iran's government and not interfering
in its internal affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Iran last month dispatched a seasoned diplomat, Mohammed Javad
Zarif, who has long experience in the United States, as its new
ambassador to the United Nations--a controversial appointment that
was challenged by hard-liners in Tehran. Zarif's approval as Iran's
top representative in the U.S. is widely seen in Iran as a signal of
interest in eventual rapprochement by the reformist government of
President Mohammad Khatami.</TE>

<HD>Tyco Details Extravagance of Ex-CEO</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>For former Tyco International Ltd. Chief Executive L. Dennis
Kozlowski, $2,200 apparently wasn't an extravagant price to pay for a
wastebasket. Nor was $15,000 for an umbrella stand--at least, not
when the purchases were made with the company's money.</LD>
<LD>   In a report submitted Tuesday to federal regulators, Tyco claimed
that Kozlowski bought these items, and others, at shareholder
expense. The filing, which marks the latest revelations of alleged
executive excess in the wave of corporate scandals this year, also
adds new details about Kozlowski's use of corporate loan and bonus
programs to carry out what prosecutors last week said was a
deliberate looting of the conglomerate since 1995.</LD>
<LD>   Tyco, which ousted Kozlowski in June, now asserts that he
misappropriated tens of millions of dollars of company funds during
his tenure. Kozlowski, 55, was indicted on corruption and grand
larceny charges last week in Manhattan. Two other senior executives
also were charged.</LD>
<TE>   The information in the company's report sent Tuesday to the
Securities and Exchange Commission echoes the indictment, but
includes additional allegations of abuse--listing outlays such as
$6,000 for a shower curtain and more than $1 million for a
Roman-themed birthday party in Sardinia for Kozlowski's wife. The
report stunned even some veteran critics of corporate practices.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like going to a buffet and stuffing your pockets with
everything in sight," said Charles Elson, a corporate governance
specialist at the University of Delaware.</TE>
<TE>   Kozlowski's lawyer, Stephen Kaufman, did not return phone calls
seeking comment. He has said the indictment represented unproven
allegations.</TE>
<TE>   In a year in which a number of chief executives have faced charges
of financial malfeasance and self-dealing, the cases brought against
Kozlowski by prosecutors and the company allege an elaborate scheme
in which shareholder funds were systematically used without
authorization by the company's directors.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the report alleges that Kozlowski--whom the company
has described as one of the highest-paid CEOs in the U.S. in the
1990s--had Tyco buy his home in New Hampshire at three times its
market value in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Kozlowski frequently donated money to charities in his own name,
using company funds, the report said. In one case, he gave $1.3
million to preserve the Squam Swamp in Nantucket, Mass. The land was
next to his own estate and the donation prevented the land from being
developed.</TE>
<TE>   The company also alleges that Kozlowski enriched dozens of other
Tyco employees with unauthorized bonuses and benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Kozlowski struck a compensation deal with Mark Belnick, the former
chief corporate counsel, that gave Belnick an incentive to aid
Kozlowski's diversion of company funds, the company said. Kozlowski
secretly promised to tie Belnick's annual bonus to his own, the
report said.</TE>
<TE>   In another instance, the report said, Kozlowski directed that the
company forgive relocation loans given to 51 employees and pay the
income taxes they would have owed. The deal cost Tyco almost $96
million, about one-third of which went to Kozlowski.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco contends that Kozlowski and the other executives who have
been indicted--Belnick, 55, and Mark H. Swartz, 42, the company's
former chief financial officer--went to great lengths to mask their
actions from the company's board.</TE>
<TE>   The report said the 51 employees whose loans were forgiven were
forced by Kozlowski to sign confidentiality agreements, forbidding
them from disclosing the deals. Some were barred from keeping
duplicate copies of the agreements.</TE>
<TE>   The company revealed the names of a number of high-ranking
executives whose company loans were forgiven at Kozlowski's
direction. Several of them have repaid their loans, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   . It was not clear whether more Tyco employees could be charged
with wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Other than Kozlowski, Swartz and Belnick, the other employees
thought their compensation packages had been approved by Tyco
directors, a Tyco spokesman said, and they believed the compensation
was proper.</TE>
<TE>   Swartz's attorney said in a statement Tuesday that his client is
innocent and the report "does not change that fact." Belnick's
attorney did not return a phone call.</TE>
<TE>   The report was compiled by a special Tyco investigative committee
headed by prominent attorney David Boies. Tyco is one of several
companies that have hired law firms to conduct corporate
investigations following the disclosure of accounting troubles or
other problems.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco described the report as far more extensive than required by
law but said it was undertaken to restore investor confidence in the
company.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco, which had sales of $36 billion last year from products
including undersea cables, alarm systems and electronic components,
stressed Tuesday that it would not have to restate its books to
account for the millions it alleges were stolen by Kozlowski. In
part, that is because bonuses and other payments were masked by
previously recorded write-offs, Tyco said.</TE>
<TE>   However, new Chief Executive Edward D. Breen has ordered an
internal audit of the company's books.</TE>
<TE>   Kozlowski, once considered a master deal maker who transformed
Tyco with hundreds of mergers in the 1990s, was ousted by the company
in early June and indicted a day later in a case brought by Manhattan
Dist. Atty. Robert Morgenthau on charges of evading sales taxes on
purchases of expensive artwork.</TE>
<TE>   Morgenthau returned last week with a broader indictment alleging
corruption.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile on Tuesday, Kozlowski and Swartz, in a court appearance,
said they were having trouble raising bail because their assets have
been frozen by Morgenthau's office. Kozlowski must post a
$100-million bond secured by $10 million in cash or property, while
Swartz must post a $50-million bond secured by $5 million in assets.
The men are due in court on Thursday for another hearing on the
matter.</TE>

<HD>Small Cities Wheeling and Dealing to Land Discount
Airlines--for Jobs and Tourists</HD>
<DH>Business: Wichita's AirTran deal uses tax money to cover
losses, ensure cheap fares.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WICHITA, Kan.</DL>
<LD>Nothing burns Pete Austin like the ads. He can't watch TV, listen to
the radio, open the newspaper without seeing an advertisement for
AirTran, the discount carrier with bargain fares.</LD>
<LD>   Cheap flights are fine, but the ads infuriate Austin because he
knows AirTran is not paying for them. The city of Wichita is. He is.
And he flies planes for a competing airline.</LD>
<LD>   "The city is essentially using my tax dollars to try to eliminate
my job," he fumed.</LD>
<TE>   Wichita officials don't see it quite like that. They frame their
unprecedented $5.1-million subsidy of AirTran as a gambit to create
jobs by bringing in affordable flights--and on them, tourists,
conventioneers and business travelers. They also hope that reasonable
air fares will encourage existing businesses to stay put.</TE>
<TE>   Wichita's lavish subsidy for the Orlando, Fla.-based AirTran ups
the ante in a fierce bidding war that has erupted around the nation
in recent years, as small and midsize cities vie to woo budget
airlines to their gates.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last few years, dozens of communities--from Albany, N.Y.,
to Stockton, Calif., from Eugene, Ore., to Tallahassee, Fla.--have
fought to attract low-fare carriers. A few have succeeded without
dipping into public funds. Many others have spent freely on
incentives, buying the airlines equipment or picking up the tab for
aggressive ad campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   The latest, and most controversial, trend: deals, like Wichita's,
that promise the airlines a certain profit in their first year or two
of service--with any shortfall to be made up by the city.</TE>
<TE>   The wheeling and dealing for budget airlines has raised tensions
in some cities. But there's also a great deal of enthusiasm, because
when the deals work, they work spectacularly--driving air fares down
as much as 40% and attracting more fliers in a surge of spending that
ripples through the local economy. Business booms for local
restaurants, hotels and taxi services. Airport parking fees,
concession sales and rental-car taxes soar. As Duane Patrick, a
county commissioner from central Kansas, said with a grin: "You can't
fleece 'em if they're not here."</TE>
<TE>   As full-fare carriers cut flights, add fees, even edge toward
bankruptcy, attracting discount airlines is "taking on a new sense of
urgency" in cities hoping for economic growth, said Jamie Baker, an
airline analyst with JPMorgan.</TE>
<TE>   "Smaller communities are desperate for the service," added Elise
Eberwein, a vice president of low-budget Frontier Airlines.</TE>
<TE>   Wichita was one of them. The city of 315,000 has been served by
half a dozen major carriers. But fares were among the highest in the
nation. A last-minute trip to St. Louis, a flight of barely one hour,
cost more than $1,200. A vacation to Tampa, Fla., purchased well in
advance, would set you back $1,500.</TE>
<TE>   Fares were so high that even executives on expense accounts
routinely drove three hours to airports in Oklahoma or Missouri.
"This market has been raped and pillaged," said Tom Ritchie, who runs
a construction company.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the No. 1 topic in Wichita," added Mayor Bob Knight. "It
was enraging to anyone who had to fly."</TE>
<TE>   Vowing to "do whatever it takes" to win discount flights, Knight
pledged to cover up to $3 million of AirTran's losses in its first
year of service and up to $1.5 million the second year. He promised
to subsidize the airline's fuel if the price rises. And he committed
$600,000 to promote the new service with ads, billboards and even an
e-mail newsletter. The enticements worked: AirTran launched service
to Atlanta and Chicago in May.</TE>
<TE>   A second discount carrier, Frontier JetExpress, will begin flights
to Denver today, supported by a $500,000 subsidy, plus $100,000 in
ads.</TE>
<TE>   Since AirTran began flying, the bland beige halls of Mid-Continent
Airport have hummed with record traffic. The last-minute trip to
Chicago that used to cost $1,300 is now $315. The $1,500
advance-purchase flight to Tampa is now $227. Officials estimate that
passengers will save a total of $60 million over the next year. In a
turnabout that has folks here chuckling, residents of Oklahoma are
now driving to Wichita to catch flights.</TE>
<TE>   Yet a handful of sharp critics here and around the nation are
raising objections to deals like the one that has transformed
Mid-Continent Airport.</TE>
<TE>   For years, airport authorities have offered to upgrade terminals
or write off some landing fees to attract coveted carriers, such as
Southwest. Guaranteeing an airline a profit on each flight, however,
seems to some a quite different--and quite dangerous--proposition.</TE>
<TE>   "We aren't venture capitalists with money to throw at a
prospective carrier that thinks there might be a market here but
doesn't want to take the risk to find out," said Mike LaPier,
director of the Central Illinois Regional Airport in Bloomington,
which does not offer airlines incentives.</TE>
<TE>   "The jury is still out on these deals," added David Beckerman, an
airline industry consultant. "They can be successful. But if the
community doesn't have a strong economy to begin with, it won't work.
It's not a panacea."</TE>
<TE>   Beckerman helped negotiate an incentive package for AirTran in
Tallahassee: The city paid a $1.5-million subsidy, spent $250,000 on
advertising and covered $350,000 worth of airport expenses, such as
renting counter space. That won the city an initial year of service.
Officials are still negotiating a pact for next year.</TE>
<TE>   And critics are still angry.</TE>
<TE>   "Am I upset that my taxes are providing a revenue guarantee for a
multimillion-dollar company? Yes," said Tallahassee resident Marshall
Baldwin, the manager of a talk radio station.</TE>
<TE>   Spokespeople for the major carriers talk little about the
subsidies handed out to their competitors. Their employees, however,
are not so circumspect. They point out that the discount airlines
that tend to attract the most subsidies are also the only American
carriers reporting profits these days.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't mind these airlines coming in, but make it a fair playing
field," fumed one United Airlines worker in Wichita who would not
give her name. "We've been serving here for 25 years. Can't they at
least give us the same kind of break?"</TE>
<TE>   Especially disturbing to some are the taxpayer-funded ad
campaigns, complete with glowing endorsements from civic leaders.
Such "marketing partnerships" are a staple of incentive packages
across the country.</TE>
<TE>   In Wichita, for instance, a prominent executive, Troy Carlson,
called it "almost a patriotic city duty" to fly the subsidized
airlines. To clinch the deal for Tallahassee, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush
designated AirTran the "preferred carrier" for state employees.</TE>
<TE>   In many other cities, airport directors and elected officials make
regular rounds of Rotary Club suppers and Chamber of Commerce mixers,
urging business travelers to fly the new airlines--even if they're
less convenient.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't tell people to go to McDonalds instead of Wendy's, so
why should they tell people to fly AirTran instead of American?"
demanded Austin, the Wichita pilot. "It puts the city in a bad spot."</TE>
<TE>   City officials respond that they'd be in a worse spot if they
didn't promote the discount services they worked so hard--and often,
spent so much--to woo.</TE>
<TE>   Full-service carriers usually match, or even beat, the discount
prices when an AirTran or JetBlue comes into town. And passengers
often snap up those deals. Some may prefer a familiar airline, such
as American or United. Others are eager to keep accumulating miles in
frequent-flier accounts.</TE>
<TE>   The result: The budget airlines introduced with such fanfare have
trouble filling their planes.</TE>
<TE>   It happened in Wichita in the mid-1990s, when Vanguard Airlines
introduced discount service. It was hailed as the answer to the
city's high fares, but the carrier lasted just two years.</TE>
<TE>   In Springfield, Ill., incentives offered in the spring of 2001
brought both full-service carrier Northwest and low-budget ATA to the
Illinois capital (population 111,000). Northwest's service to its
Memphis, Tenn., hub lasted barely a year. ATA is struggling to fill
seats to Chicago's Midway Airport as passengers stick by the
tried-and-true United flights to O'Hare International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to tell our community, please, diversify your travel,
spread it out among the airlines so everyone wins. But habits are
hard to break," said Eric Frankl, the executive director of
Springfield Capital Airport.</TE>
<TE>   To force travelers to try the new airlines instead of sticking
with familiar names, many communities have established "travel
banks." Executives are asked to deposit a chunk of their firms'
travel budget in a special account. Participation is voluntary. But
once the money's in the account, firms can withdraw it only to buy
tickets on the newest airline in town. That forces business travelers
to fly on ATA or JetBlue even if American is matching the discount
fares.</TE>
<TE>   Wichita ran an aggressive travel bank campaign, with hundreds of
volunteers walking door to door, asking business owners to
participate. The bank collected a record $7.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Even with such overwhelming support--and the city-funded
promotions--AirTran has faltered out of the gate. In its first four
months of service, the airline has billed Wichita for close to $3
million in losses, burning through a subsidy that was supposed to
last a year.</TE>
<TE>   Worse still, AirTran's passenger load slumped 11% in August, even
as the airport recorded its second-busiest month, suggesting that
travelers have abandoned the budget carrier in favor of other
airlines that matched its discounts.</TE>
<TE>   AirTran is bound by contract to stay in Wichita for two years, and
city officials said they don't intend to offer additional subsidies
to offset the carrier's heavy losses.</TE>
<TE>   Still, they are starting to express concern, as they watch the
airline run through its public financing without gaining loyal
customers. They know only too well that if Wichita can't support a
discount carrier, there are plenty of other cities waiting, with
incentives, in the wings.</TE>
<TE>   As AirTran spokesman Tad Hutcheson put it: "There are more
airports to serve than we have airplanes."</TE>

<HD>Montanans Fulfill a Dying Man's Wish</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HELENA, Mont.</DL>
<LD>Sharon Smith wanted badly to grant her dead husband's wish to have
his ashes spread in his favorite state. But Montana is a long way
from Interlachen, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   With the help of a Montana newspaper columnist, a rural county
sheriff and the U.S. mail, her husband's dying wish is being granted.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday morning, Smith packed up the ashes of her husband,
Clarence, who died in August, took them to the post office in
Interlachen and had him shipped--by registered mail--to Treasure
County Sheriff Steve Wilkins in the small town of Hysham, about 70
miles east of Billings.</LD>
<TE>   Wilkins was one of more than 400 people who got in touch with
Smith after her story appeared in a Sunday column by Ed Kemmick of
The Billings Gazette.</TE>
<TE>   Kemmick had written of Smith's desire to grant her husband's wish,
but she had no friends or relatives in Montana and no means of making
the trip herself.</TE>
<TE>   The day the column appeared, her phone wouldn't stop ringing with
calls from Montanans, even from people in neighboring Wyoming, who
wanted to help. They flooded her with e-mails too.</TE>
<TE>   But it was Wilkins with whom Smith finally entrusted her husband's
ashes after listening to the message he left.</TE>
<TE>   "He's somebody that my husband would like to have known," she said
Tuesday. "I just wanted to make sure it was done proper. Everybody
else had the concern, but it was something you can't describe,
something you feel when you talk to him. I guess that's why he's a
sheriff."</TE>
<TE>   "I just thought it was neat that this gentleman, her husband,
wanted to have his ashes spread over some nice area in Montana,"
Wilkins said.</TE>
<TE>   "She sounded like somebody who needed help and I felt if I could
help her, I should."</TE>
<TE>   Clarence Smith, who died of cancer at age 56, had lived in Montana
for 15 years and had tried unsuccessfully to convince his wife they
should move here after they married in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   His wife resisted. "I said, 'You're not putting me up there on the
side of a mountain,' " Smith said. "He'd just look at me and shake
his head, and say, 'You just don't realize....' "</TE>
<TE>   Wilkins said he expects to receive the ashes in less than a week
and intends to spread them Sept. 29 at one of his own favorite
hunting spots.</TE>
<TE>   Smith and Kemmick, the columnist, said they were surprised at the
number of calls the column generated.</TE>
<TE>   "Quite frankly, I was just pleased, as I always am, to find
something to write about," Kemmick said.</TE>

<LD>A mail carrier who donated a kidney to one of the customers on his
LaVale, Md., route has been selected as Hero of the Year by the
National Assn. of Letter Carriers.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Wagoner, 42, of Short Gap, W. Va., will be honored at
ceremonies today in Washington, the mail carriers' union said.</LD>
<LD>   The award is one of several given annually to mail carriers who
come to the aid of people, usually in fires or crime victims.</LD>
<TE>   In this case Wagoner decided to donate a kidney after learning of
the longtime illness of one of his regular customers, Dave Phillips.
The successful transplant was performed May 25, 2001, at the
University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore, the union said.</TE>

<LD>   The appeal, filed in Hartford, cited 26 issues, plus a catchall
27th issue that left open the door for additional arguments. It did
not appear to raise any arguments that had not been put forth
earlier, most of which were rejected by the trial judge.</LD>

<HD>Stalled Defense Bill Irks Bush</HD>
<DH>Congress: The president wants quick passage of the
Pentagon's annual appropriation. To do otherwise would be to 'play
politics,' he says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Tuesday prodded Congress to act quickly on annual
spending for the Pentagon, arguing that to do otherwise would be to
"play politics" with the defense bill in the midst of the war on
terrorism and the brewing conflict with Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   The measure is one of the 13 annual appropriations bills that has
yet to clear Congress, even as the start of the new federal fiscal
year looms on Oct. 1. Traditionally, at least a few would have been
signed into law by now. This year, however, a variety of political
squabbles has stalled the budgeting process.</LD>
<LD>   The defense bill is among the furthest along; the House and Senate
each has passed a version of the measure and lawmakers are expected
to hammer out their differences and emerge with a compromise soon.
But by singling out defense spending, Bush called attention to a
sluggish budget process that is clearly becoming a source of
frustration for the administration.</LD>
<TE>   In a wide-ranging speech at a Republican political fund-raiser in
Tennessee, Bush reviewed his efforts to thwart terrorism and confront
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, whose regime he called one of the
"true threats" to peace.</TE>
<TE>   After praising Congress for bipartisan support for his previous
military spending requests, he scolded lawmakers for not having
passed the pending defense bill.</TE>
<TE>   "They need to act," he said. "The leadership in Washington needs
to move a defense bill to my desk as quickly as possible. They ought
not to play politics with the defense appropriations bill in the
midst of a war--a war that will define civilization itself."</TE>
<TE>   He noted that he is seeking the largest increase in defense
spending since the Reagan administration. That increase is needed, he
said, to "send a message to friend and foe alike that the United
States is not going to relent in our quest for freedom; that we're in
this deal for the long haul; that there's not a calendar on my desk
that says by such and such a date, we quit."</TE>
<TE>   The Senate passed a $355.4-billion defense appropriation bill in
early August that would add $34.4 billion to the Pentagon budget. The
House approved a $354.7-billion version of the bill in June.</TE>
<TE>   A $10-billion war contingency fund is under negotiation between
the Bush administration and Congress and could be approved
separately.</TE>
<TE>   Turning to another dispute with Congress, Bush repeated his pledge
to veto a measure to create a Department of Homeland Security--one of
his top domestic priorities--if the Democratic-led Senate does not
give the agency greater freedom in hiring and firing employees than
is allowed by federal law.</TE>
<TE>   The administration argues that such latitude is needed to ensure
the department's effectiveness in responding to security threats. But
Senate Democrats say that the White House is exaggerating the need
for loosening the employees' labor rights and that they are fighting
to preserve the civil service protections.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to make good on my promise that if the flexibility is
not in the bill ... I'm going to use my veto power," Bush said. "I
will not accept a lousy bill that makes it impossible for the
president, this president or future presidents, to do what the
American people expect, and that's to protect the homeland."</TE>
<TE>   In response, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) noted
that Bush had resisted Democratic calls for a separate homeland
security agency before unveiling his proposal in June. "Had [Bush]
supported homeland security legislation when the Democrats first
offered it last [year], we probably would have completed it by now,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush spoke at a luncheon that raised $800,000 for the Senate
campaign of Republican Lamar Alexander, and an additional $300,000
for the state Republican Party.</TE>
<TE>   The visit to Tennessee took Bush to a state he won--over Al Gore,
a Tennessee native--by almost 4% in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Alexander is a former Tennessee governor who served as Education
secretary in the first Bush administration and who unsuccessfully
sought the GOP presidential nomination in 1996 and 2000.</TE>
<TE>   He is running against Rep. Bob Clement, a Democrat, for the Senate
seat being left vacant by Republican Fred Thompson's retirement.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, as he has at nearly every turn of his crowded travel
schedule this year, mixed politics and policy on his Tennessee
trip--in this case delivering a speech at a local school encouraging
students to focus on U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   The White House announced a series of grants intended to encourage
the teaching of U.S. history and civic education, and another program
to make the documents compiled by the National Archives available on
the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   During his stop at the school, Bush took part in a nationwide
recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance that commemorated the 215th
anniversary of the signing of the U.S. Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   "This pledge takes on a special meaning in a time of war. Our
enemies hate these words," he said.</TE>

<HD>Firm Says Fund Cheats Its 9/11 Survivors</HD>
<DH>Assistance: Federal rules on financial aid deny 'full
compensation' to families, Cantor Fitzgerald charges. The claim is
disputed by special master.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Cantor Fitzgerald, the bond brokerage that lost 658 employees in the
attack on the World Trade Center, charged Tuesday that the federal
victims compensation fund cheats survivors of its employees out of
hundreds of millions of dollars.</LD>
<LD>   Under the rules of the fund, "the vast majority of Cantor
Fitzgerald families would not receive full or appropriate
compensation for their economic losses," the firm said in a report
submitted to Kenneth Feinberg, the fund's special master.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers for victims' families said the report could discourage
some from accepting federal aid as an alternative to seeking
compensation through lawsuits.</LD>
<TE>   The report charges that the fund underestimates the lost earning
potential of the victims, is biased against single and younger
employees and illegally bases awards on after-tax income.</TE>
<TE>   It also challenges what it says are limits on compensation to
families.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Tuesday, Feinberg insisted the fund does not place
a cap on awards.</TE>
<TE>   He offered to meet with Cantor Fitzgerald families to demonstrate
that the program is fair.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that their effort is well-intentioned, but I think it is
incorrect to say that the rules of this program will arbitrarily
prevent the individual claimants from getting a fair award," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cantor Fitzgerald lost two-thirds of the 1,050 people employed at
its headquarters near the top of the north tower of the trade center.
The toll was nearly a quarter of all those killed in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   The report, which was posted on Cantor's Web site, lists numerous
objections to the way Feinberg has calculated the payments.</TE>
<TE>   Basing payments on after-tax income instead of gross earnings is
"a very clear-cut mistake" that violates New York state law, said
Karen Valihura, a lawyer with the firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meagher &amp; Flom, which assisted Cantor Fitzgerald in preparing the
report.</TE>
<TE>   The report also said the government's earnings growth estimates
are too low, in part because it averaged three years of earnings to
compute compensation.</TE>
<TE>   The salary, bonuses and fringe benefits for Cantor employees rose
dramatically in three years, from $134 million in 1999 to $284
million in 2001, the firm said.</TE>
<TE>   New York lawyer Lee Kreindler, whose firm represents 40 Cantor
families, said the report could delay proceedings because "the
families will be reluctant to accept something that may change."</TE>
<TE>   The fund's awards are based on a formula that includes earning
potential plus a $250,000 award for pain and suffering.</TE>
<TE>   An additional $100,000 is added for a spouse or each dependent
child. Life insurance and workers' compensation payments are
deducted.</TE>
<TE>   Feinberg said in March that the average payment to victims'
families would be about $1.85 million before deductions.</TE>
<TE>   Families that choose to participate in the fund must relinquish
the right to sue the airlines and other entities.</TE>

<HD>Senate to Vote on Iraq Resolution Before Election</HD>
<DH>Congress: Democratic leaders drop resistance to Bush's
request. The action is likely to bolster the president's hand with
allies overseas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Senate Democratic leaders on Tuesday agreed to vote before the
midterm elections on a resolution supporting action against Iraq,
dropping their complaints that they were being rushed to judgment
before the Bush administration had fully made its case.</LD>
<LD>   The action came as Iraqi arms experts and U.N. weapons inspectors
agreed to meet in two weeks to prepare for the inspectors' return to
Baghdad. U.S. officials have dismissed Iraq's offer to admit
inspectors, and President Bush, speaking Tuesday at a school in
Tennessee, warned that the world must not be fooled by Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's latest offer.</LD>
<LD>   "You've got to understand the nature of the regime we're dealing
with," Bush said. "This is a man who has delayed, denied, deceived
the world."</LD>
<TE>   After weeks of raising questions and voicing caution about Bush's
request that Congress move quickly to support action in Iraq, Senate
Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) embraced the aim of holding a
vote on Iraq policy before Congress adjourns in mid-October for the
elections.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there will be a vote well before the election," said
Daschle, who will join other congressional leaders at the White House
today to discuss the resolution's timing and wording. "The real
question is what will the resolution say."</TE>
<TE>   That shift by Senate Democrats blunts one of the few sources of
domestic political resistance to Bush as he has moved toward a
confrontation with Hussein. And it is likely to strengthen Bush's
hand as he tries to rally the international community and the
American public behind his initiative against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Attention now turns to the question of what the resolution will
say, a debate that will likely force the Bush administration to be
more specific about its strategy. Republicans met with Vice President
Dick Cheney in the Capitol on Tuesday to discuss the measure and to
rally GOP support for the president.</TE>
<TE>   White House and congressional authors of the resolution face
questions about just how broad or detailed it should be in
authorizing Bush to act against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The president wants broad authority; some Democrats want a more
limited measure supporting the initiative that Bush unveiled at the
United Nations last week. In his U.N. speech, Bush urged the
international community to join the United States in demanding that
Iraq destroy its weapons of mass destruction, allow arms inspections
and comply with other past U.N. resolutions--and to be prepared to
mete out consequences if Iraq refuses to comply.</TE>
<TE>   Many Democrats had wanted to postpone a vote until after the
elections; Daschle has repeatedly warned that a preelection vote
risked politicizing the issue. But in a shift, Daschle said he was
now calling for early action because Bush had complied with most of
the requests that lawmakers had made: to consult with Congress, seek
support from the U.N. and to more explicitly make the case for action
against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle said he was encouraged by Bush's speech to the U.N. and by
signs of growing global support for Bush's efforts. He said he still
did not think there was "conclusive evidence" about the threat posed
by Iraq, but he no longer insisted such evidence be provided as a
prelude to rallying behind Bush.</TE>
<TE>   The new support for quick action by Congress came even as some
lawmakers were questioning whether such a vote should be delayed
after Iraq's announcement Monday that it would allow U.N. weapons
inspectors unconditional access to suspected weapons sites.</TE>
<TE>   "A few weeks is well worth waiting if it allows us to avoid a
war," said Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.).</TE>
<TE>   But most lawmakers said that they had little faith in Hussein's
willingness to allow unfettered inspections and that Congress should
not be diverted from acting on its own. Indeed, Sen. Richard G. Lugar
(R-Ind.) said a vote of support by Congress could help the U.S. win
tougher action by the U.N.</TE>
<TE>   Jockeying over the timing of any vote on Iraq has been laden with
political overtones because of the elections, in which both parties
are laboring fiercely for control of the House and Senate. Many
Democrats have been concerned that a protracted debate over Iraq
would cast a long shadow over the agenda of issues they believe work
to their advantage--the economy and other domestic issues.</TE>
<TE>   But some have argued that the sooner the issue is disposed of, the
more time Democrats will have to spotlight other issues in the
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   While the White House is consulting congressional leaders on what
the resolution will say, House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas)
said the key decisions remain Bush's to make.</TE>
<TE>   Stuart Roy, a spokesman for House Majority Whip Tom DeLay
(R-Texas), said the administration was seeking a resolution with "as
few strings as possible, and that's what we plan to pursue: approval
for the use of force regardless of what the U.N. may or may not do."</TE>
<TE>   However, many Democrats are likely to resist giving Bush unchecked
authority.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) said: "I don't want an
open-ended Gulf of Tonkin resolution," a reference to the
controversial measure that allowed expanded U.S. involvement in
Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   Dodd said he would prefer to see a resolution focused on
eliminating weapons of mass destruction. Although he would not
necessarily oppose efforts to promote regime change, "My goal here is
to deal with the weapons of mass destruction. If regime change is an
added benefit to all of this, then fine. But if you get regime change
and you have weapons of mass destruction in place, then what have you
gained?"</TE>
<TE>   Some Republicans who have been slow to accept Bush's case against
Iraq also showed new willingness to move more aggressively. "We can't
condition our action on what may or may not transpire in the U.N.,"
said Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine).</TE>

<HD>Pilot Faulted in Copter Crash</HD>
<DH>Accident: A lack of power was also among the factors
contributing to the accident during a high-altitude rescue on Mt.
Hood, military says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Pilot error and a lack of power caused an Air Force Reserve
helicopter to crash while performing a high-altitude rescue mission
on Mt. Hood in May, military investigators said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators said several factors contributed to the crash of the
Pave Hawk helicopter at 10,700 feet, including failure to follow
proper procedure when calculating how much power the helicopter
needed and the pilot's slow reaction time when the aircraft began to
falter.</LD>
<LD>   The investigators said the helicopter did not malfunction.</LD>
<TE>   The incident on May 30 began when several climbers lost their
footing on Oregon's highest mountain and began sliding down a glacier
about 800 feet below the 11,245-foot summit. They collided with two
other parties of climbers, sending nine people into a crevasse.</TE>
<TE>   Three people--49-year-old William Ward and 48-year-old Richard
Read, both of Forest Grove, and John Biggs, 62, of Windsor,
Calif.--died in the accident.</TE>
<TE>   Five hours later, the Air Force Reserve helicopter was hovering
above the climbers--and was preparing to haul one up by cable--when
it started rocking and moving backward, losing control in the icy
mountain air.</TE>
<TE>   The nose of the helicopter crashed into the slope, thrusting its
body into the mountain and shattering its rotors as it rolled 200
feet down the slope. Four of six crew members were tossed out of an
open side door. All of the crew members were injured, but only one
seriously.</TE>
<TE>   A series of mistakes led to the crash, investigators said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Flight engineers miscalculated how much power the chopper needed
to complete the rescue by about 6%, they said. In addition, flight
engineers made the first power calculations using manual charts, but
they did not perform a second manual calculation as required by Air
Force procedure.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the flight engineers used a flight instrument that had
been decertified since January to verify their manual calculations,
said Col. Stephen Duresky, the lead investigator.</TE>
<TE>   Duresky said dramatically changing headwinds could have
complicated the situation. When the chopper took off, winds were
blowing at 12 to 15 knots, but they got stronger quickly, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Once the helicopter began losing power and faltering in the air,
the pilot's slow reaction time caused it to go into a nose dive,
Duresky said.</TE>
<TE>   The pilot should have immediately released the cable attached to
the stretcher holding the injured climber below, turned to the left
and circled back. Instead, Duresky said, crewmen didn't release the
cable until the helicopter--out of control--attempted to land, but
instead crashed.</TE>
<TE>   "The one decision the pilots make is, 'Can we do the mission or
can't we?' They decided they could and made an error," Duresky said.</TE>
<TE>   Although it will cost $4.7 million to repair, Duresky said the
Pave Hawk will fly again.</TE>

<HD>Illinois Death Row Feud Hits Court</HD>
<DH>Legal: Attorney general files suit to keep the governor
from holding clemency hearings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SLATER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Illinois Atty. Gen. Jim Ryan filed suit Tuesday in an effort to
prevent the governor and the State Prisoner Review Board from holding
clemency hearings for 157 inmates on death row.</LD>
<LD>   The move comes as Gov. George Ryan--who is not related to the
attorney general--is considering commuting the sentences of all the
state's death row inmates to terms of life in prison. Thirteen death
row inmates have been freed in the last three years after the
discovery of exonerating evidence, often through DNA analysis.</LD>
<LD>   The governor, a Republican who is not seeking a second term, and
the attorney general, also a Republican, have been feuding for two
years over how to deal with problems in the state's system of capital
punishment. The attorney general is vying for the statehouse in
November against Democratic Rep. Rod R. Blagojevich.</LD>
<TE>   Accompanied by relatives of some of those murdered by death row
inmates, the attorney general announced the suit at a downtown
Chicago gathering Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Ryan said a proposed 15-minute time period for each hearing
would be unfair to the families of the victims and a de facto end run
around the judicial process. Families of the victims would not be
able to make a fair case against clemency during the brief hearing,
the attorney general argued in the case, filed in Springfield.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney general, in a second suit filed Tuesday, argued that
32 of the 157 inmates are not eligible for the hearings because they
did not file their petitions properly or because they are awaiting
re-sentencing after their death sentences were overturned.</TE>
<TE>   In a pointed response to the suit, the governor said he welcomed
the attorney general's "newfound concern for fairness and justice."</TE>
<TE>   "But with a capital punishment system operating at an accuracy
rate as arbitrary as the flip of a coin, the governor believes
nothing short of a comprehensive review of the entire system will
do," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hounded by a federal investigation into corruption in the
secretary of state's office when he led that agency, Gov. Ryan, 68,
announced in August that he would not seek a second term.</TE>
<TE>   A one-time proponent of the death penalty, the governor instituted
a moratorium on capital punishment in January 2000 after evidence
emerged that several inmates were on death row despite findings that
they were probably innocent of the crimes that had put them there.</TE>

<HD>Detention Hearing Linked to Release</HD>
<DH>Court: Federal judge rules that Islamic charity co-founder
accused of funding terrorists must be freed unless the U.S. holds
open proceeding.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>A federal judge said Tuesday that the Justice Department must release
the co-founder of an Islamic charity accused of funneling money to
terrorists unless it holds a new and open detention hearing for the
man within 10 days.</LD>
<LD>   Rabih Haddad, a Lebanese citizen who had been living in Ann Arbor,
Mich., has been in federal custody since his Dec. 14 arrest on a visa
violation. Since then, his detention hearings have been closed to the
public and the news media.</LD>
<LD>   "An open detention and removal hearing will assure the public that
the government itself is honoring the very democratic principles that
the terrorists who committed the atrocities of 9/11 sought to
destroy," U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds said in her 12-page
ruling.</LD>
<TE>   A Justice Department spokesman said the agency was reviewing the
ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Federal attorneys have argued that opening such hearings could
give terrorists insight into the government's strategy in the war on
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The American Civil Liberties Union, several newspapers and Rep.
John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) have sued to open the proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Edmunds said Tuesday that Haddad must receive a new hearing within
10 days of her order and that the hearing must be open to the public.</TE>
<TE>   "The government has failed to make a particularized showing that
its interests in fighting terrorism are implicated in Haddad's case,"
Edmunds wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Ashraf Nubani, an attorney for Haddad, said he was ecstatic over
Tuesday's ruling, but he still expected the government to urge the
new judge to close the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nonsense," Nubani said. "Pastor Haddad has never in any
sense of the word posed a threat to the nation's security or had any
involvement with the events of Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>   The same day Haddad was arrested, the U.S. Treasury Department
froze the bank accounts of his Global Relief Foundation and agents
raided its suburban Chicago office.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has said it suspects Global Relief of
having ties to terrorism, but no criminal charges have been filed
against Haddad or the foundation, which Haddad helped found in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Global Relief, based in Bridgeview, Ill., says it provides food,
emergency relief, medical aid and education training in more than 20
countries, including Pakistan, Iraq and Chechnya.</TE>

<HD>Reno Admits Defeat and Goes Home</HD>
<DH>Politics: Ex-attorney general wasted a big lead in losing
the Democratic gubernatorial primary. She has no political future,
experts agree.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>On Tuesday, a full week after Florida's chaos-plagued election and
onset of a prolonged ballot count, Janet Reno conceded defeat, and
drove off into the political twilight.</LD>
<LD>   From now on, Reno told glum-faced supporters, she is a "private
citizen."</LD>
<LD>   It almost certainly was a career-ending move for the former U.S.
attorney general, who is 64, suffers from Parkinson's disease and
squandered a lead of monumental proportions to upstart attorney Bill
McBride, who beat her in Florida's Democratic primary for governor.</LD>
<TE>   "This is going to be a lesson in every campaign manual on how not
to run a campaign," said Larry Sabato, director of the Center for
Politics at the University of Virginia. "You do have to try to lose a
30-point lead. You have to work at it, every day. And she did."</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Sabato said, "we now can write Reno's political
obituary. Unless she wants to run for state agriculture commissioner
or state attorney general."</TE>
<TE>   At the wheel of her red Ford Ranger pickup, Reno ran a unique
brand of campaign, raising little money, forgoing widespread use of
television advertising and ignoring many state Democratic elders.</TE>
<TE>   Though one of the best-known members of the Clinton presidency and
a high-profile attorney general, Reno campaigned as a populist and
outsider in a state where, according to analysts, neither of those
types of politicians do well anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Ignoring opinion polls and eschewing a television ad blitz in
favor of pressing the flesh in one-on-one encounters with voters,
Reno put 60,000 miles on her truck's odometer, but, observed the
Tampa Tribune, it was ultimately a "road trip to nowhere."</TE>
<TE>   For her mistakes, as well as her achievements, the native Miamian
can credit her celebrated bullheadedness, say people who are close to
her.</TE>
<TE>   "No one who really knows Janet Reno would try pressuring her to
get her to do something," a high-ranking member of the Florida
Democratic Party said last week. "This is a woman who knows her own
mind."</TE>
<TE>   A recount of some ballots in South Florida showed her main
opponent, Tampa lawyer McBride, with a shrunken but still
unbridgeable lead of about 4,800 out of more than 1.3 million votes
cast. So Tuesday, the deadline for submitting results to Tallahassee,
Reno announced she had called McBride to concede, to congratulate him
and to pledge her support.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Bill can lead us," an upbeat Reno told crestfallen
loyalists at her campaign headquarters in Miami Lakes. She said she
thought the former Marine Corps officer and head of the state's
largest law firm had the qualities to be one of Florida's "greatest
governors."</TE>
<TE>   Many in her party were coming to view Reno as someone who could
not successfully challenge the Republican incumbent, Gov. Jeb Bush,
the president's brother, and were relieved that she lost, observers
said.</TE>
<TE>   In the general electorate, not only does Reno bear the animus of
many for having served Clinton for nearly the entire two terms of his
presidency, but she is disliked, even detested, for specific actions
as attorney general, such as sending a 6-year-old boy home to Cuba
and the attack that killed 63 people near Waco, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "This really is the leftover from the 2000 elections," said
Sabato, referring to the controversy that still rankles over which
presidential candidate won Florida. "Democrats are really angry and
they want to beat Bush. That helped McBride. As time went by, more
and more people who sat down and thought about this realized Reno was
weak and McBride would do better against Bush."</TE>
<TE>   Being forced to face McBride in the general election, rather than
the more polarizing Reno, is "Jeb Bush's worst nightmare come true,"
is how Democratic state Rep. Bob Henriquez of Tampa sized up the
primary's result.</TE>
<TE>   Reno, who lives in the Kendall home her mother built with her own
hands, will not withdraw entirely from the public eye. She made clear
Tuesday she will be happy to campaign for McBride, and that she plans
to file a lawsuit over the election day glitches that her staff
believes cost her precious votes.</TE>
<TE>   "As a private citizen," Reno said, "I want to do everything in my
power to see that the people of the state of Florida have the right
to vote, the right to vote in a timely fashion, to vote for the
candidate of their choice, the right to have their vote counted in an
accurate and timely fashion."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, her campaign manager, Mo Elleithee, said Reno was ready
to take Bush to court over the widespread troubles with touch-screen
voting machines and other problems that marred the Sept. 10 primary.
Republicans blame the problems on the election supervisors in Broward
and Miami-Dade counties, one a Democrat, the other
Democratic-appointed.</TE>
<TE>   Unless she settles for a second-tier job, Reno, who began public
life with a losing bid for the Florida Legislature in 1972 then was
elected five times as chief state prosecutor in Miami, doesn't have
many options for elective office.</TE>
<TE>   Both Florida senators are Democrats, and even if McBride were to
lose to Bush on Nov. 5, he would stand a better chance at being
nominated four years from now than Reno would.</TE>
<TE>   If Reno had any regrets, they were invisible Tuesday afternoon as
she warmly thanked her backers in Miami Lakes for having made
politics "an activity of joy" for her.</TE>
<TE>   As early as today, when the state will officially certify the
election results, McBride is expected to announce his choice for
running mate. Associated Press quoted sources close to the campaign
Tuesday evening as saying state Sen. Tom Rossin, the Florida Senate's
Democratic leader, would be tapped to run for lieutenant governor.</TE>

<HD>9/11 Probe Frustrates Lawmakers</HD>
<DH>Terror: With hearings set to begin, key senators favor an
independent investigation into the intelligence agencies' failure to
foil attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>As long-delayed hearings on intelligence failures surrounding the
Sept. 11 attacks finally get underway on Capitol Hill today, key
lawmakers are voicing frustration with the failings of the
investigation itself.</LD>
<LD>   Several members of the Senate Intelligence Committee say they now
favor creating an independent commission to do a more thorough
examination of the government's failure to prevent the attacks--a
proposal vehemently opposed by the White House but increasingly
likely to clear the Senate, perhaps as early as this week.</LD>
<LD>   The congressional probe has been sidetracked by staff changes as
well as an ongoing FBI investigation into whether lawmakers leaked
classified material to the media.</LD>
<TE>   Members continue to accuse the White House and intelligence
agencies of dragging their heels in turning over information,
declassifying material and making witnesses available.</TE>
<TE>   And with a relatively small team of investigators facing a
February deadline for a final report, several key senators said
Tuesday that they are simply running out of time.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we might be in position to do a searching, definitive
job," said Sen. Richard C. Shelby, the ranking Republican on the
Senate Intelligence Committee. "I do not feel that way anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, defended the investigation, saying he is confident it will
produce a comprehensive report that will spell out reforms needed to
prevent future intelligence breakdowns.</TE>
<TE>   But even Graham acknowledged Tuesday that his committee can't
answer all the lingering questions from Sept. 11, 2001. He said that
if there is a vote this week on creating an independent commission,
he is "leaning" toward voting yes.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that there is new momentum for an independent commission
underscores the extent to which the investigation is still stumbling
seven months after its inception.</TE>
<TE>   Today's hearing is designed to provide the public with its first
glimpse of investigators' progress. Much of the session will be
devoted to an overview of the investigation by Eleanor Hill, a former
federal prosecutor and Defense Department inspector general hired in
June to direct the probe. The committee is also expected to release a
30-page report of preliminary findings.</TE>
<TE>   A congressional source familiar with the probe said the report
will include newly declassified intelligence materials showing that
U.S. spy agencies had more warning than they have previously
acknowledged that terrorists might attack U.S. soil and use aircraft
as weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The source said investigators have not found evidence that any
government agency had information specific enough to detect and
disrupt the Sept. 11 plot. But the source indicated that the report
contains information that could undercut claims by CIA Director
George J. Tenet and others that the intelligence community was fully
mobilized against Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden long before the
Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The report, which also includes previously reported disclosures of
intelligence breakdowns, is based on investigators' reviews of more
than 400,000 documents and interviews with about 500 people, the
source said. But even as some close to the panel sought to tout the
report, others dismissed it as little more than a terrorism timeline
pieced together largely by the CIA.</TE>
<TE>   One congressional aide familiar with the investigation said that
only two investigators have been assigned to the CIA, and that they
have been outnumbered and outmaneuvered by agency officials. The
information in the report, the aide said, was "spoon-fed" to
investigators by CIA officials.</TE>
<TE>   Even the decision to hold public hearings has been a source of
friction within the committee. Some argued that staging such sessions
is sapping committee resources that would be better spent pursuing
new leads.</TE>
<TE>   Today's session is to open with testimony from relatives of
victims of the Sept. 11 attacks. Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) said he
believes it is important for members of Congress to meet with
victims' families, but he questioned how it would advance the
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "Why does the intelligence committee have to have a public hearing
to have these people tell their story?" Kyl asked. "We don't dispense
benefits to survivors."</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether the committee can still produce a meaningful report,
Kyl said, "Hope springs eternal," but he suggested that he expects a
more disappointing product.</TE>
<TE>   One of his main concerns, he said, is that the panel has spent too
much energy producing a Sept. 11 chronology, and not enough probing
more complicated matters, including breakdowns in how intelligence
agencies set priorities and allocated resources before the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The final report "will be very interesting reading and an
important historical document," Kyl said. "But I'm not sure what [it
will accomplish] beyond that."</TE>
<TE>   Others voiced similar concerns. "I'm hoping we can begin to
discuss some of the macro issues," including whether the intelligence
community should be reorganized, said Sen. Mike DeWine (R-Ohio). But
with Congress set to recess in less than a month, and the report due
shortly after members return at the beginning of next year, DeWine
said, "I don't think there's going to be enough time."</TE>
<TE>   The House and Senate Intelligence panels have been under pressure
to finish their work by February, because that is when many
members--including the ranking members in each chamber--are scheduled
to rotate out of their Intelligence assignments.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation was also sidetracked last spring when its first
staff director, L. Britt Snider, was forced out after hiring an
employee who had failed a CIA polygraph test. Hill took over in June.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI recently launched an investigation into whether members of
the joint committee leaked classified information to the media. As
part of that unusual probe, lawmakers responsible for examining the
FBI's role in Sept. 11 have been asked by agents whether they would
be willing to submit to polygraph tests and provide telephone records
and other documents.</TE>
<TE>   The investigations' struggles have buoyed prospects for a bill
sponsored by Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) and John McCain
(R-Ariz.) that would create an independent commission to examine
various government agencies' performance leading up to Sept. 11. The
bill calls for the creation of a 10-member panel that would include
intelligence experts, but exclude elected officials.</TE>
<TE>   For much of the year, the bill appeared to be doomed by fierce
opposition from the White House and the reluctance of influential
lawmakers, including Shelby, to approve a separate investigation
while Congress was pursuing its own.</TE>
<TE>   But with Shelby and others now on board, Lieberman and McCain have
been looking for an opportunity to attach their bill as an amendment
to homeland security legislation being considered by the Senate this
week. Asked whether there are now enough votes for a commission,
McCain said Tuesday, "We'll win."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Listeria infections have killed at least 13 people in the Northeast,
and although health officials say contaminated food is the likely
cause, they're still trying to determine the source of the infection.</LD>
<LD>   Since an outbreak was first noticed in Pennsylvania in early
September, cases have been detected in New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut.</LD>
<LD>   Four people have died in Pennsylvania, four in New Jersey and five
in New York state. One apparently related death was also reported in
Michigan.</LD>
<TE>   Because a specific food associated with the cases had not been
identified, health officials recommended that children, the elderly
and people with weakened immune systems avoid certain foods,
including soft cheeses, hot dogs and luncheon meats (unless
reheated), and unpasteurized milk.</TE>
<TE>   Listeria can cause serious, sometimes fatal, food poisoning. In
adults, it can cause meningitis. In less-severe cases, it can cause
headache, high fever, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea. Listeria
sickens about 2,500 people and kills about 500 each year in the
United States, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention.</TE>
<TE>   Pennsylvania has had 25 cases of listeriosis in the last two
months, compared to a normal rate of about 24 cases a year, state
Health Department spokesman Richard McGarvey said.</TE>
<TE>   McGarvey said genetic fingerprinting indicated 10 of the nonfatal
cases in Pennsylvania were caused by the same bacteria strain.
Testing had not been completed to determine whether the four deaths
were also caused by the strain, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The four Pennsylvania residents who died were older than 65. The
deaths occurred before Labor Day, and the most recent case there was
found last week, McGarvey said.</TE>
<TE>   Two New York City residents who died were among eight New Yorkers
who contracted the same strain of the disease found in Pennsylvania.</TE>

<HD>Study Finds Misreadings in Breast X-Rays</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Radiologists examining mammogram X-rays gave false-positive cancer
readings up to 15.9% of the time, with the youngest and most recently
trained doctors having two to four times the false-positive rate of
older radiologists, a study finds.</LD>
<LD>   The study, in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, found
that the rate of false positives could be reduced significantly if
radiologists could compare films from previous mammograms.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Joann Elmore of the University of Washington School of
Medicine in Seattle said that the rate of false positives--breast
cancer mammogram screenings that require follow-up tests--is becoming
increasingly common in the United States but that it should not
discourage women from having annual screenings.</LD>
<TE>   "Mammography is not a perfect test [for breast cancer], but it is
the best test we have," said Elmore, first author of the study.
"Women should realize that they have a 10% chance of being called
back for additional tests."</TE>
<TE>   The results of the study, she said, carry this message: Women
should continue to have mammograms, but they should try to return to
the same testing facility each time so radiologists can compare past
test films. False positives are reduced by about 70% when
radiologists compare current films with past images, Elmore said.</TE>
<TE>   The study involved an evaluation of mammogram readings from 2,169
women by 24 radiologists in a community clinic practice from 1985 to
1993, which gave time for follow-up studies of the patients. The
study analyzed the rate of false-positive interpretations by the
doctors, then related that to the experience and training of the
radiologists and to the patients' ages and other characteristics.</TE>
<TE>   It found that the false-positive rate ranged from 2.6% to 15.9%.
But when this rate was adjusted for the effect of patient
characteristics, such as age, the false-positive rate was 3.5% to
7.9%. Age affects the false-positive rate because breast tissue is
denser in younger women, which makes their mammograms more difficult
to interpret.</TE>
<TE>   The study found that doctors who graduated from medical school in
the last 15 years had false-positive rates two to four times higher
than more experienced doctors. Elmore suggested that the young
doctors may have had training that concentrated on finding cancer
without emphasizing that false positives "can cause a lot of women
who don't have breast cancer to be called back" for more tests. Older
doctors also have more experience, she said, and "experience
matters."</TE>
<TE>   "Radiologists who have been reading mammograms for 20 to 30 years
have seen a lot of cases and hopefully learned," she said.</TE>

<HD>Treasurer Wins Mass. Gubernatorial Primary</HD>
<DH>Politics: Shannon O'Brien holds off three others and will
face GOP's Mitt Romney in November.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>State Treasurer Shannon O'Brien scored a strong victory Tuesday in
Massachusetts' Democratic gubernatorial primary, setting up a
November battle with GOP candidate Mitt Romney in a state that hasn't
had a Democratic governor since Michael Dukakis left office in 1991.</LD>
<LD>   O'Brien, the Democratic front-runner for months, held off former
U.S. Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, state Senate President Tom
Birmingham and former state Sen. Warren Tolman to win the nomination.</LD>
<LD>   With 87% of precincts reporting Tuesday night, O'Brien had 33% of
the vote. Reich was next with 25%. Birmingham had just under 25% and
Tolman had about 17%.</LD>
<TE>   O'Brien was boosted throughout her campaign by key endorsements
and money from women's groups. Romney, the former Salt Lake City
Olympics chief and son of former Michigan Gov. George Romney, faced
no primary opponent.</TE>
<TE>   In Oklahoma, meanwhile, state Sen. Brad Henry scored a surprising
runoff victory over restaurateur Vince Orza in the Democratic
gubernatorial race.</TE>
<TE>   Orza had finished first by 16 percentage points in the Aug. 27
primary and had been favored in the runoff. But with all precincts
reporting, Henry had 52% of the ballots, to Orza's 48%.</TE>
<TE>   "The pundits said we couldn't do it. But I'm here to say we won,"
said Henry, 38.</TE>
<TE>   Henry advances to the November election against GOP former Rep.
Steve Largent. GOP Gov. Frank Keating is barred by state law from
seeking a third term.</TE>
<TE>   Also in Oklahoma, former Gov. David Walters defeated lawyer Tim
Boettcher for the Democratic Senate nomination. He will face GOP Sen.
James M. Inhofe in November. With all precincts reporting, Walters
had 57%, to 43% for Boettcher.</TE>
<TE>   In Massachusetts, O'Brien is seeking to end a recent trend of GOP
domination: The last Democrat to serve as governor was Dukakis, who
did not seek re-election in 1990 after his failed presidential bid.</TE>
<TE>   O'Brien is also trying to become the first woman elected
Massachusetts governor, succeeding GOP acting Gov. Jane Swift, the
lieutenant governor who moved up when Paul Cellucci was named
ambassador to Canada. Swift, who was plagued by personal and
political controversies, dropped out of the race hours before Romney
announced his candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   Reich mounted a strong campaign, but his late entry in January
hurt his fund-raising. Birmingham relied on labor support but was
linked to an unpopular Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the primary, O'Brien and Romney were swapping charges.</TE>
<TE>   O'Brien, who is married to a former Enron lobbyist, complained
that Romney's supporters went too far by showing her photo next to
disgraced Enron and WorldCom executives. She called Romney a bully--a
sensitive issue, since some accused him of "elbowing" Swift aside.
The Romney campaign responded by calling O'Brien a bully for
challenging Romney's state residency and trying to keep him off the
ballot.</TE>

<HD>Study Is More Than a Wash</HD>
<DH>Conservation: A trip to Washington is the reward after a
test of a water-saving appliance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>They spent four months doing 20,000 loads of laundry, and this week,
an entire Kansas town earned a free trip to the nation's capital.</LD>
<LD>   Tiny Bern, Kan., was the testing ground for a new washing machine
designed to save water and energy. Conducted by the U.S. Department
of Energy and Maytag, the study required residents to weigh each load
before and after it was washed. Maytag threw in the machines for
free.</LD>
<LD>   "In a rural community, I think you just naturally tend to cut
back," said Mavis Heiniger, who owns the town grocery store with her
husband, Mark.</LD>
<TE>   Maytag flew Heiniger and other Bern residents, about 270 in all,
to Washington for a two-day visit where they received special
recognition by the U.S. Department of Energy and a small plaque
commending the town for joining the study and for leading in water
conservation efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Water problems in the northeast Kansas town date to a drought in
1860. Officials in recent years have discouraged too much use by
tripling water rates and imposing strict rules, such as requiring
pond water for livestock.</TE>
<TE>   They even brought in experts to explore for more water, prompting
legal wrangling with the state of Nebraska and eventually resulting
in a new well across state lines.</TE>
<TE>   Elmer Ronnenbaum, general manager of the Kansas Rural Water Assn.,
nominated the town and the local water district to conduct the study.</TE>
<TE>   Maytag provided scales and easy-to-read monitors. In the 103
households that joined the study, residents said the work amounted to
a few extra seconds each time.</TE>
<TE>   The study demonstrated that the Maytag Neptune washer used 40%
less water and 60% less energy.</TE>

<HD>West Nile Virus Reportedly Causes 3 More Deaths in Illinois</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Illinois, the state hardest hit by West Nile virus, Tuesday reported
three more deaths from the mosquito-borne illness, bringing its death
toll to 21 this year.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, Colorado officials said a 42-year-old unidentified man
from the Denver area has become the first person in that state to be
infected with the virus.</LD>
<LD>   The Illinois victims were two women, aged 78 and 88, and a
64-year-old man, all from the Chicago area, the state Department of
Public Health said. The 78-year-old woman died Tuesday. The others
died last week.</LD>
<TE>   Illinois leads the nation in West Nile deaths and in the number of
human cases--399 so far, according to state figures.</TE>
<TE>   The man in Colorado was bitten by a mosquito while on a hunting
trip in eastern Colorado and has recovered, Cindy Parmenter,
spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Public Health and

<HD>Interior Secretary Is Held in Contempt Over Indian Fund</HD>
<DH>Court: Judge says Norton is 'unfit,' assails her for not
fixing a problem with royalty payments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A federal judge on Tuesday called Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton
an "unfit" government representative and held her in contempt for
failing to follow his order to fix the system that has deprived
Native Americans of billions of dollars in royalties.</LD>
<LD>   Norton has acknowledged major problems with the trust fund, which
was established in 1887 to manage mineral and timber development on
lands apportioned to individual Indians and distribute royalties from
them.</LD>
<LD>   But in his 267-page opinion, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth
declared her effort to solve them a "deceitful and disingenuous"
failure.</LD>
<TE>   "The agency has indisputably proven to the court, Congress, and
the individual Indian beneficiaries that it is either unwilling or
unable to administer competently the ... trust," Lamberth wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "Worse yet, the department has now undeniably shown that it can no
longer be trusted to state accurately the status of its trust reform
efforts. In short, there is no longer any doubt that the secretary of
the Interior has been and continues to be an unfit trustee-delegate
for the United States," Lamberth added.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department, which is arguing the case for the Interior
Department, disagreed with Lamberth's decision. "We ... are
evaluating it to consider all the options for appeal," said Robert D.
McCallum Jr., assistant attorney general in charge of the civil
division.</TE>
<TE>   The trust collects oil, gas, coal, timber and grazing royalties
from more than 11 millions acres of land west of the Mississippi
River for about 300,000 Indians.</TE>
<TE>   Government officials decided to take control of these funds more
than a century ago because they feared the Indians would squander the
money.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to distribute the funds to their rightful owners,
Lamberth appointed a "master monitor" to oversee the department's
efforts to account for the funds. He also ordered Norton to come up
with a plan to fix the system by January and scheduled a trial for
May to determine how to conduct an accounting of the government's
debts to individual Indians.</TE>
<TE>   The judge also told the department to cover legal fees for the
case.</TE>
<TE>   Norton inherited the problems from the Clinton administration,
whose Interior and Treasury secretaries, Bruce Babbitt and Robert E.
Rubin, were also held in contempt by Lamberth for failing to make
good on the debt to Native Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Babbitt and Rubin were not punished personally and neither has
Norton.</TE>
<TE>   Lamberth found four specific instances of fraud committed by the
Interior Department. In one, he charged that the department pretended
to gather information about how to do a historical accounting of the
money owed the individual trustees.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, he said, the department always intended to account for
the funds through a statistical sampling.</TE>
<TE>   Lamberth called it an "unconscionable scheme" and criticized the
department's lawyers for playing a key role in it.</TE>
<TE>   "The court is very disappointed that attorneys, particularly those
that worked for the government, would engage in such subterfuge," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs were ecstatic about the ruling and expressed
confidence that the department would have to give them a much greater
say in the resolution of this decades-old fiasco.</TE>
<TE>   The lead attorney for the plaintiffs, Dennis Gingold, said he
believed the strict timeline in the judge's decision set the stage
for payments to the beneficiaries as early as next year.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>An insurance executive who killed two co-workers and himself had
recently received an e-mail from one of the victims ending their
relationship, investigators said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The shootings took place at Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield's
offices near Times Square, where the health insurance company
temporarily relocated after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
The employees found dead had escaped from the World Trade Center.</LD>
<LD>   John Harrison, a former FBI agent and assistant vice president at
Empire Blue Cross, apparently called subordinates Vincent LaBianca,
34, and Isabel Munoz, 36, into his office Monday morning, well before
most employees had arrived.</LD>
<TE>   Wielding two semiautomatic pistols, Harrison, 53, fired more than
a dozen shots before killing himself.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Harrison had been in a relationship with Munoz.
Shortly before the shootings, Munoz sent Harrison an e-mail saying,
in effect, that she had not wanted him to leave his wife and that she
did not want their affair to continue, investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said Harrison had recently moved out of his family's
New Jersey home and into an apartment so he could continue the affair
with Munoz.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, investigators had said Monday's shooting stemmed from
an apparent love triangle. However, a police official speaking to
Associated Press on condition of anonymity said Tuesday that
detectives had found no evidence suggesting Munoz and LaBianca had
any romantic connection.</TE>
<TE>   Unable to find any evidence to support the love-triangle theory,
Harrison's motive for killing LaBianca remained unclear, the police
source said.</TE>
<TE>   The three colleagues worked in the company's fraud investigation
unit.</TE>

<HD>Parents Warned on Pot's Toll</HD>
<DH>Health: Drug policy chief says the effects of pot on youths
have been downplayed. An ad campaign is planned to alter perceptions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The nation's drug policy director warned parents Tuesday against
trivializing the dangers of marijuana to their kids, warning them
that more teens are addicted to pot than to alcohol or to all other
illegal drugs combined.</LD>
<LD>   Many parents and children have outdated perceptions about
marijuana, said John Walters, director of the Office of National Drug
Control Policy. They believe marijuana is not addictive, that it's
less dangerous than cigarettes or that it has few long-term health
consequences.</LD>
<LD>   In reality, more teens enter rehabilitation centers to treat
marijuana addiction than alcohol or all illegal drugs combined,
Walters said.</LD>
<TE>   "Our effort is to correct the ignorance that is the single biggest
obstacle to protecting our kids," he said as he announced an
advertising campaign by his office and 17 education, public health,
anti-drug and family advocacy groups.</TE>
<TE>   The national effort will include advertisements on television,
radio and print media, along with ones that will air in NFL stadiums
and appear inside game programs. "For too long, our nation's teens
have been getting the wrong message about marijuana," Walters said.</TE>

<HD>Top Democrats Back Bush on Waging Iraqi War</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Hawkish consensus among possible presidential
contenders could boost fortunes of Vermont Gov. Howard Dean.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In rapid succession, the leading Democrats considering a race against
George W. Bush in 2004 are lining up behind the president's push for
possible military action against Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Since Bush's speech last week to the United Nations, Sens. Joseph
I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) and John Edwards (D-N.C.) have made clear they
would back the use of force against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein,
while House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) has suggested
he would, as well.</LD>
<LD>   Sources close to former Vice President Al Gore, the 2000
Democratic presidential nominee, say he will shortly endorse the
prospect of military action. Even Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.), who
has consistently raised questions about a potential strike against
Iraq, appears to be moving toward supporting force, sources close to
him say.</LD>
<TE>   This hawkish consensus could leave an opening for a so-called
peace candidate in the developing Democratic race. At the moment,
Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who's openly exploring a presidential
candidacy, appears the most likely to audition for that part. The
little-known Dean has been more critical of possible military action
than any other potential candidate.</TE>
<TE>   That could help him gain a foothold in Iowa, site of the first
caucus in January 2004 and traditionally a state where antiwar
sentiments run high among Democratic activists. But, on both
substantive and political grounds, most leading Democrats appear to
have concluded that opposing action against Hussein could be an
insurmountable burden to carry into a 2004 race.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an opportunity in the primaries for an antiwar
candidate, particularly in Iowa, but that disqualifies you for the
general election," said a top aide to one of the likely 2004
candidates.</TE>
<TE>   That sentiment--which has quickly become conventional wisdom among
Democratic strategists working with the possible 2004
contenders--represents a marked change from 1991. At that time, many
leading Democrats opposed then-President George Bush when he sought
congressional approval for the use of force to dislodge Iraq from
Kuwait, which it had invaded.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, several factors have shifted the Democratic attitudes
about confronting Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   One is the successes of the U.S. military in the 1990s: After the
armed forces' decisive performances in the Persian Gulf War,
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo and Afghanistan, few officials in either
party are expressing the concern that a war with Iraq could become a
"quagmire"' or another Vietnam--a common contention from critics
before the Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   "This is likely to turn out more painful than people anticipate,
but nobody believes it is going to last indefinitely," said a former
top national security official in President Clinton's administration.</TE>
<TE>   Second, Clinton's use of force in Bosnia and Kosovo--added to the
sheer passage of time--has eroded the resistance to military
intervention burned into the party by Vietnam. "There was much more
of a reflexive view that we're not the party of war" during the Gulf
War debate, said Bruce Reed, president of the centrist Democratic
Leadership Council. "The shadow of Vietnam was still there, and I
don't sense any of that anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, and perhaps most important, the terrorist attacks of last
year have convinced many Democrats that it is too dangerous--both
politically and substantively--to permit Hussein to move toward
development of weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   This change in emphasis is most apparent among the Democrats
considering the 2004 race.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the president asked the U.N. to demand Iraq's
compliance with resolutions requiring disarmament and to authorize
"action" if Hussein resists.</TE>
<TE>   Within hours of Bush's speech, Edwards delivered a statement on
the Senate floor declaring that he would support unilateral military
action to remove Hussein from power if the United Nations balks.</TE>
<TE>   That same day, Gephardt--who earlier this year had endorsed
military intervention--said the U.S. must "deal with this ...
diplomatically if we can, militarily if we must."</TE>
<TE>   One day later, Lieberman, who has been perhaps the most aggressive
Democratic advocate of a military strike, endorsed military action
with or without the U.N. "If we lead, I am confident that many other
nations will come to our side," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gore, who supported the resolution authorizing force in the Gulf
War as a senator, hasn't spoken publicly about Iraq since Bush's
speech.</TE>
<TE>   In a speech earlier this year, Gore urged a "final reckoning" with
Hussein. But in an appearance before college students this summer, he
struck a more cautious note. While he said he would support replacing
Hussein, he warned, "if the rest of the world does not see what it
regards as a sufficient provocation to justify an invasion by the
United States, then the diplomatic costs would be extremely high."</TE>
<TE>   Now, sources close to Gore say he is planning to declare support
for military action, but to urge that the United States act with a
coalition of allies.</TE>
<TE>   Kerry, in interviews and articles, repeatedly has urged Bush to
work through the U.N. and to exhaust all other possibilities before
going to war. In a television interview Sunday, Kerry argued that
Congress should consider Iraq in stages, first approving a resolution
urging the U.N. to act, then debating an American attack only if U.N.
intervention fails. But Kerry has never ruled out the use of force if
other options fail. As he put it on "Face the Nation" on Sunday, "You
have to exhaust the possibilities here, so that you have a legitimacy
in your actions."</TE>
<TE>   Aides say all indications are that Kerry will support a resolution
authorizing Bush to use force against Iraq, even if the Senate, as is
likely, rejects his two-stage authorization idea.</TE>
<TE>   Dean, in an interview Tuesday, said flatly that he did not believe
Bush has made "the case that we need to invade Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Dean said he could support military action, even outside the U.N.,
if Bush could "establish with reasonable credibility" that Hussein
had the capacity to deliver either nuclear or biological weapons
against the United States and its allies. But he said that the
president, to this point, hadn't passed that test.</TE>
<TE>   "He is asking American families to sacrifice their children, and
he's got to have something more than, 'This is an evil man,' " Dean
said. "There are a lot of evil people running countries around the
world; we don't bomb every one of them. We don't ask our children to
die over every one of them."</TE>
<TE>   Such dissenting views could find an audience in the Democratic
primary; polls have consistently found rank-and-file Democrats more
skeptical of invading Iraq than other Americans.</TE>
<TE>   But Rob Tully, a former Iowa Democratic chairman, said that even
in his state, the calculus may have changed.</TE>
<TE>   The terror attack has "done a lot to change a lot of people's
views as to what we should do and how we should look at security
within and outside our borders," Tully said.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Weighs Heightened Role for Special Operations</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Rumsfeld sees the elite group leading in some
missions, independent of Central Command.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Senior Pentagon officials are planning to hand the U.S. Special
Operations Command a lead role in some missions in the war on
terrorism, giving the elite command a measure of independence from
the U.S. Central Command, which has been directing the effort,
defense officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Army Gen. Tommy Franks, the head of Central Command, has been the
top military commander in the war in Afghanistan, where special
operations soldiers have played a leading role that military analysts
call unprecedented. But after discussions between Defense Secretary
Donald H. Rumsfeld and senior military and civilian leaders on ways
to intensify the search for Osama bin Laden and lingering members of
his Al Qaeda terrorist organization, Rumsfeld is expected to give
some autonomy to the Special Operations Command, or SOCOM.</LD>
<LD>   '"There will be instances in which SOCOM has the lead," Pentagon
spokeswoman Victoria Clarke said late Tuesday. "There will be many
instances where SOCOM doesn't have the lead. But it would be wrong to
say that SOCOM will be the supported command going forward."</LD>
<TE>   The unusual proposed arrangement is separate from larger
organizational shifts in the Pentagon and is apparently rooted in an
effort by Rumsfeld and senior military leaders to bring in more
high-profile Al Qaeda leaders, such as Ramzi Binalshibh, the man
believed to have been the lead coordinator of the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks, who was captured in a raid in Pakistan last week and is now
in U.S. custody.</TE>
<TE>   "People have got to redouble their efforts," Clarke said.</TE>
<TE>   She emphasized that Rumsfeld has not made a final decision on the
proposed change, and would not elaborate on when SOCOM would take the
lead over the regional command. The move, first reported in today's
editions of the Washington Post, would transfer decision-making in
some instances from one end of MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla.,
where both commands are located, to another.</TE>
<TE>   Special operations include an elite group that consists of Army
Special Forces, or Green Berets; the Delta Force, a group so secret
the Army officially does not acknowledge it exists; Navy SEALs; and
Air Force combat controllers and search-and-rescue airmen. The
low-profile fighters have gained newfound clout through their success
in leading Afghan forces to a rapid victory over the Taliban. They
worked closely with local fighters in Afghanistan but reported to
Central Command. Under the proposed arrangement, the top
decision-maker would be the SOCOM commander, Air Force Gen. Charles
Holland.</TE>
<TE>   The elite soldiers have played a lead role in maintaining
relationships with Afghan warlords and scouring the porous tribal
region of Pakistan along the Afghan border. They have also been
providing personal security for Afghan Prime Minister Hamid Karzai.
The 12-man groups of special operators linked with Northern Alliance
generals in the north marched into Kabul with Mohammed Qassim Fahim
and led Karzai to sweep the region surrounding the Taliban's last
stronghold of Kandahar.</TE>
<TE>   The new arrangement could allow them to direct those or other
efforts more quickly and without going through another layer of
approval from Central Command.</TE>
<TE>   The basic role of special operations is unlikely to change, Gen.
Paul V. Hester, who works under SOCOM as commander of the Air Force
Special Operations Command, said in an interview earlier this month.
Although the proposed arrangement would grant special operation
commanders more control, they have traditionally sought to remove
their soldiers as soon as possible once their mission ends.</TE>
<TE>   In Afghanistan, some special operation soldiers have expressed a
desire to move on to other duties, although instability in the nation
and their close working relationships with local warlords have kept
many there long after the last major battle ended in March.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to concentrate to capitalize on that trained work in the
battlefield," Hester said in the Sept. 9 interview. "And when that
special training is not needed--when you can hand off to the
conventional forces--you needed to do that as quickly and as
seamlessly as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the fighting in Afghanistan is now in the hands of
conventional military units, such as the Marines and the Army's 101st
Airborne and 10th Mountain divisions.</TE>
<TE>   "Special operations was there, handed off to the [conventional]
corps and moved ahead to do special ops things," Hester said, noting
that Franks has kept special operation soldiers on special missions.
"I think he still sees in some of those unique places in the caverns
and in the caves and in the mountains--places for special operators
to go and use their talents."</TE>
<TE>   Central Command's mission has been stretched in contingency
planning for a possible war with Iraq. The command announced last
week that it would send 600 soldiers from Tampa to Al Udeid Air Base
in the Persian Gulf nation of Qatar, where an air war might later be
directed against Iraq. Central Command officials described the move
as an exercise to test the readiness of newly designed mobile
communication facilities.</TE>

<HD>Panel Voids a 3rd Nevada Death Sentence</HD>
<DH>Law: Appeals court says instructions to jury may have
biased it to condemn a man in the killing of a Las Vegas prostitute
in 1986.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court overturned a Las Vegas murderer's death
sentence Tuesday, ruling the man who stabbed a prostitute 45 times in
1986 did not get a fair trial.</LD>
<LD>   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said unconstitutional
instructions to the jury may have prejudiced jurors to vote for a
death sentence after they already had convicted John Valerio.</LD>
<LD>   It is the third Nevada death sentence overturned for the same
reason, and 16 of the 85 condemned inmates on Nevada's death row
assert similar claims on appeal, said Michael Prescetta, a federal
public defender in Las Vegas.</LD>
<TE>   "The result seems positive for us," he said. "When a jury is
deciding when to make someone eligible for the death penalty, they
have to have objective standards."</TE>
<TE>   Valerio, who will remain in prison pending the outcome of further
litigation, was convicted of murdering Karen Blackwell, also of Las
Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Her body, with 45 stab wounds, was found in the trunk of a car
wrapped in bedding from Valerio's apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Valerio's bedroom was spattered with blood, and
Blackwell's keys and address book were found in his jacket pocket.
His name was on a list of customers she kept in her address book.</TE>
<TE>   Valerio denied guilt.</TE>
<TE>   A Clark County jury convicted him in 1988 and found the murder
involved "torture, depravity of mind or mutilation."</TE>
<TE>   But the 9th Circuit ruled that "depravity of mind" was too vague
for jurors to understand what it was they were voting for.</TE>
<TE>   The decision reverses U.S. District Judge Howard D. McKibben and
the Nevada Supreme Court, which upheld the death verdict on grounds
the victim suffered torture or serious physical abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we're very disappointed and we're considering where we
go from here," said Robert Wieland, Nevada senior deputy attorney
general.</TE>
<TE>   The Nevada Legislature eliminated the "depravity of mind" factor
in 1995, 15 years after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the factor
was too vague and prejudicial to capital defendants.</TE>
<TE>   The decision also reverses a 2000 decision from the 9th Circuit,
which upheld Valerio's execution 3 to 0 without ruling on the merits
of his appeal. The circuit reheard the case with 11 judges, and set
aside the death sentence Tuesday on a 7-4 vote.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling means Valerio cannot immediately be executed. But it's
up to prosecutors whether they wish to appeal to the U.S. Supreme
Court or ask a new jury to issue a death sentence.</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit also asked a federal judge to determine whether
Valerio got a fair trial when jurors were weighing whether to convict
him.</TE>
<TE>   The case is Valerio vs. Crawford, 98-99033.</TE>

<LD>A judge dismissed manslaughter charges Tuesday against a man accused
of causing his 20-month-old granddaughter's death by leaving her in a
hot car for nearly eight hours while he went to work.</LD>
<LD>   Municipal Judge Seamus P. McCaffery said he didn't believe that

<HD>At Home in War on Terror</HD>
<DH>Viet Dinh has gone from academe to a key behind-the scenes
role. Conservatives love him; others find his views constitutionally
suspect.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LORETTO, Pa.</DL>
<LD>Viet Dinh is working the room. Viet Dinh, it seems, is always working
a room.</LD>
<LD>   The room itself isn't much, at least not by the standards of one
of the rising stars of the Bush administration. A hundred or so
faculty members and supporters at Saint Francis University in rural
Pennsylvania are lunching in a nondescript student center to hear
Dinh, advisor to U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft and a point man in the
war on terrorism, philosophize about how liberty and freedom can
thrive even in a time of national crisis.</LD>
<LD>   But look closer, and the Vietnamese-born, Southern California-bred
Dinh has a more immediate agenda. Seated at lunch next to him is a
local district judge, D. Brooks Smith, whose promotion to a federal
appellate court has been imperiled by protests over his civil rights
record. Literally and figuratively, Dinh is at Smith's side.</LD>
<TE>   Amid Dinh's broad legal colloquies and historical references to
Nathan Hale and William Penn, he delivers an impassioned endorsement
of Smith. He steps up the drumbeat for local television reporters
after his speech, decrying the "liberal activists" who have
threatened to derail President Bush's nominee.</TE>
<TE>   The scene is typical of Dinh and his remarkable ascent to power:
Part law school professor, part political pit bull, Dinh has
navigated seamlessly between the worlds of Ivory Tower academia and
sharp-elbowed Washington politics to leave his imprint on a wide
array of policy decisions.</TE>
<TE>   If Ashcroft and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld are the face
of the Bush administration's anti-terrorism campaign, Dinh and a
small cadre of other behind-the-scenes advisors have emerged as its
brain trust.</TE>
<TE>   At age 34, he already has filled a resume befitting a man twice
his age: boat refugee from Vietnam, Oregon fruit picker, Orange
County burger-flipper, Harvard Law School graduate, U.S. Supreme
Court clerk, Georgetown Law School professor, constitutional scholar,
lawyer to a high-powered congressional committee. His is "a
spectacular American story," Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-N.M.) said in
introducing Dinh to the Senate during his confirmation hearings 16
months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Dinh's current role as an assistant attorney general clearly has
given him his most important platform yet. At first a somewhat
obscure player in Ashcroft's Justice Department, his prominence in
recent months has made him both a darling of the conservative
movement and a lightning rod for criticism from liberal-leaning
politicians and civil rights activists who assert that his views run
roughshod over the Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   On topics as far-ranging as gun control, cyber pornography, human
trafficking and the selection of new federal judges, Dinh has played
an increasingly critical role in shaping federal law enforcement
policy. But nowhere has his impact been felt more keenly than in the
Bush administration's highest priority: its aggressive war on
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Crafted Patriot Act</TE>
<TE>   Dinh was the chief architect of the USA Patriot Act, the
legislation approved by Congress in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks
that gives law enforcement agencies vastly expanded powers to track
terror suspects. He has been the official responsible for crafting a
series of anti-terrorism initiatives that would, among other things,
require the fingerprinting of potentially tens of thousands of
visiting foreigners from Middle East countries and would put foreign
students on a much tighter leash.</TE>
<TE>   He revamped the law enforcement guidelines that Ashcroft announced
in May to give FBI agents new powers to snoop in mosques and surf the
Internet. And he is now working on a plan to promote better
coordination within the Justice Department and with agencies such as
the CIA, a task aimed at preventing the communication breakdowns that
preceded Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "I did not sign up for a war," Dinh said in an interview. "But
it's a privilege, a profound honor really, to serve your country in a
time of crisis. I can't imagine a better place for me to be right
now."</TE>
<TE>   What is perhaps most surprising to Justice Department observers is
that Dinh has achieved such influence as one of 11 assistant
attorneys general in charge of the Justice Department's Office of
Legal Policy. The office was once a low-profile, somewhat nebulous
operation chiefly concerned with federal judicial nominations--''a
backwater,'' one former employee, who worked for the department
during Janet Reno's tenure, called it. But with Ashcroft's blessing,
Dinh has expanded the office's reach into areas once considered far
outside its domain.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft's a Fan</TE>
<TE>   Dinh, a wiry, energetic man who spews out ideas and legal theory
at a furious staccato clip, has turned his boss into one of his
biggest fans.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to point to a part of this department," Ashcroft said
in an interview, "that isn't related to sound legal policy, so [Dinh]
has become an integral part of virtually every decision we make....
He operates on a gold-medal level."</TE>
<TE>   Dinh recalls the instructions Ashcroft gave him when he took over
the job last year.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me: 'The art of leadership is the redefinition of the
possible. I want you to be the think tank to help me redefine the
possible for the Department of Justice.' That was a great charge for
an academic," Dinh said.</TE>
<TE>   Some Republicans even speculate that Dinh could someday be a
candidate for the first Asian American justice on the Supreme Court.
But with success and visibility have come a growing chorus of critics
who attack his policies and politics.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats on Capitol Hill have publicly chastised Dinh for
disregarding the privacy rights of law-abiding Americans. An
irritated former Secretary of State Warren Christopher challenged him
at a law conference last summer by suggesting that the
administration's refusal to identify terrorist detainees reminded him
of Argentina's notorious practice of simply making prisoners
"disappear." And gun control advocates accuse Dinh of serving as
Ashcroft's buffer on 2nd Amendment issues, helping to scale back
regulations for enforcing gun laws.</TE>
<TE>   "John Ashcroft has put together the most right-wing legal team in
modern Justice Department history, and Viet Dinh is, by all accounts,
a principal player. His impact has been felt across the department,"
said Ralph Neas, president of People for the American Way, a liberal
civil rights group.</TE>
<TE>   Where Bush administration loyalists see an aggressive
counterattack on terrorism, civil rights activists see an
infringement on American liberties. Where supporters see well-crafted
public policy, critics see far-reaching edicts made under a veil of
secrecy.</TE>
<TE>   "When you start acting by executive fiat, that's what leads to
governmental abuses," Neas said, "and that's why I'm so worried about
what Viet Dinh and John Ashcroft have been doing in the last year."</TE>
<TE>   Emotional Memory</TE>
<TE>   Nearly a quarter-century later, Dinh still becomes emotional when
remembering one scene: his mother in a Malaysian port, wielding an ax
that seemed bigger than she was, whacking holes in the side of the
vessel so she and five of her children would not be sent back out to
sea.</TE>
<TE>   It was 1978. Dinh was 10. His father was being held as a political
prisoner in the family's war-ravaged homeland, when his mother, Nga
Thu Nguyen, tried to escape by sea with Viet and the other children.
They were among 85 people crammed on a 15-foot-long boat, but as
Dinh's mother recalled in a recent telephone interview from her
Garden Grove home, "after three days, the boat was broken. After
seven days, there was no more food or water."</TE>
<TE>   After 12 days, she had lost nearly all hope. But they came upon a
Thai fishing crew who gave them food and gas, helped fix the boat and
pointed them toward land. They reached Malaysia--only to be met by
gunshots from a patrol boat. The Malaysians didn't want them. Their
boat managed to dock, but Nguyen realized that the port police would
force them to leave the next morning, so she crept back out to the
boat alone that night with an ax, she said. "I just hit it and hit it
and made holes everywhere," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Dinh, recounting the events last year before the Senate Judiciary
Committee as his nomination was considered, said it demonstrated for
him the "incredible courage" of his mother and the "incredible
lengths" to which people will go in search of freedom.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's critics now find it ironic that Dinh, a
refugee himself and an inspiration to many Asian Americans in
Southern California, would advance policies that civil libertarians
say place many Arabs and Arab Americans under a cloud of suspicion.
But Dinh counters that his experience has given him a "special
sensitivity to what it means to be an American" and how important it
is to apply the law equally, regardless of race or ethnicity.</TE>
<TE>   After six months as refugees in Malaysia, Dinh's family made it to
Oregon for Thanksgiving of 1978. They picked strawberries for menial
wages, sending money back to Dinh's father and a sibling hiding out
in Vietnam. After Mt. St. Helens erupted in 1980, the crop damage
forced his family to relocate to Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, the teenager worked with his mother in a sewing
shop and put in time at fast-food restaurants after school. The
family's persistence paid off in 1983 when Dinh's father finally made
it to America. Dinh's parents wanted him to be a doctor. But politics
was his passion, an interest fueled by his mother.</TE>
<TE>   ''He had a hatred of the Communists because I made him understand
it was the Communists who had taken his father away from the house
and put him in prison,'' Nguyen said. ''I instilled that in him early
on.''</TE>
<TE>   Like many Vietnamese immigrants, Dinh's emotional experience in
his homeland steered him toward the Republican Party because of the
GOP's hard-line stance against communism.</TE>
<TE>   Youthful Volunteer</TE>
<TE>   Garden Grove Councilman Van Tran remembers Dinh, just out of
Fullerton High School, volunteering to work the phone banks at an
Asian American voter registration center set up by then-Rep. Robert
K. Dornan.</TE>
<TE>   "He used to call me anh, or 'elder brother.' He stood out even
then as a lanky 18-year-old because he was someone who was very quick
and very witty," Tran said.</TE>
<TE>   Dinh's reputation as affable, bright and politically astute would
follow him through Harvard University and Harvard Law School, which
he attended with the aid of scholarships and graduated magna cum
laude, and to the U.S. Supreme Court, where he clerked for Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a wonderful law clerk," O'Connor recalled recently. "I was
so fascinated by his background and the fact that he had arrived on
our shores with nothing but the clothes on his back, yet somehow he
had persevered."</TE>
<TE>   By 1999, Dinh had firmly established his Republican credentials as
a lawyer for two of the most bitterly partisan initiatives in
Washington, working first for Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.) in the
Senate investigation into President Clinton's Whitewater dealings in
the mid-1990s, and later for Domenici during Clinton's impeachment
trial.</TE>
<TE>   When the 2000 presidential election led to a landmark lawsuit,
Dinh was there to write a friend-of-the-court brief before the U.S.
Supreme Court on behalf of a group of Florida voters who backed
Bush's position.</TE>
<TE>   When Ashcroft's nomination as attorney general ran into widespread
opposition in January 2001 over his record on civil rights and other
issues, Dinh wrote an op-ed piece in the Washington Post extolling
Ashcroft's "deep compassion" for minorities.</TE>
<TE>   And when Dinh was nominated a few months after that article to
become one of Ashcroft's top deputies, he contacted Tran and asked
him to call Rep. Loretta Sanchez (D-Garden Grove) to see whether she
would be willing to introduce him at his Senate confirmation
hearings, even though he was a Republican nominee, Tran said. Dinh's
nomination was confirmed by a 96-1 vote in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Dinh was feted as a returning hero at a Vietnamese American
festival in Orange County last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Sanchez understood right away the political significance of such
a gesture, and Viet got a bipartisan introduction" before the Senate,
Tran said. "I thought it was a brilliant move on his part."</TE>
<TE>   Too brilliant, some of his Democratic detractors on Capitol Hill
say. While demanding anonymity because of frayed relations with
Ashcroft's office, several Democratic officials describe Dinh in
terms such as "rawly political," and have even coined a derisive
nickname to describe his aggressive politicking: "Viet Spin."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats whisper that during his days on the Whitewater
investigation, Dinh was suspected of leaking confidential information
to the news media in order to hurt Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   Dinh vehemently denies the charge, but Democrats say lingering
resentments over his Whitewater days--Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton
(D-N.Y) was the only senator to vote against his confirmation--have
hurt his relations on Capitol Hill and caused tensions as the
Ashcroft administration has pushed to expand its law enforcement
powers.</TE>
<TE>   No Time for Golf</TE>
<TE>   If such political sniping has bothered Dinh, he doesn't show it.
Indeed, about the only regret that Dinh, a bachelor, confesses is
that his hectic pace has given him time to hit the golf links only
once or twice since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   After reaching a pinnacle in his career, he insists his mind is
squarely focused on the task at hand: revamping federal law
enforcement to confront the threat of terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   That has to be "the overriding priority," Dinh said. "The day that
we relax is either the day that we have definitely won this war or
the day that I get somebody else to continue my job."</TE>

<HD>Czar of Cyber Security Defends Easing of Rules</HD>
<DH>Policy: He tells critics of his strategy that industry, and
not government, has the right answers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PILLER and JUBE SHIVER JR.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Federal cyber security czar Richard Clarke fired back Tuesday at
critics who have lambasted his national strategy for cyberspace
security as weak and meaningless, saying that government regulation
would only make the problem worse.</LD>
<LD>   "Why are we requesting that industry help us, rather than
demanding it?" Clarke asked. "Industry frequently knows better than
government about the [information technology] infrastructure."</LD>
<LD>   Clarke argued that the problem of cyber security is so complex
that it defies a centralized approach. Any regulatory process would
be outdated before it took force in the fast-moving world of
technology.</LD>
<TE>   The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace, set for release today,
and previewed Tuesday to some experts and members of the media,
emphasizes recommendations for better security practices and
guidelines for detecting and repelling hackers. It contains no
proposals for tax incentives, regulations or legislation to compel
businesses or other organizations to safeguard their networks, and
thereby increase the nation's overall cyber security.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say there has been a litany of similar reports in recent
years, and Clarke's 65-page document adds few new ideas or incentives
for industry to patch its security holes.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration backed away from several tougher steps,
including requiring Earthlink, America Online and other Internet
service providers to include security technology with their software,
said Michael A. Aisenberg, a director of public policy for VeriSign
Inc., a leading security software firm.</TE>
<TE>   White House officials also dropped plans to restrict the use of
wireless networks because of rampant security holes, according to
industry sources.</TE>
<TE>   Critics have charged that Clarke abandoned those initiatives
because of intense lobbying from technology firms, which have wanted
to remain free of potentially costly government restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   Clarke denied allegations of undue pressure but would not comment
further on earlier drafts of the report.</TE>
<TE>   Some leading security experts rejected the entire report as
irrelevant.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a law. Who cares what it says?" said Bruce Schneier,
chief technology officer for Counterpane Internet Security, based in
San Jose. "A bunch of voluntary recommendations won't work," given
financial pressures in a down economy.</TE>
<TE>   The report, which will be sent to the president in about two
months, urges increased public awareness and personal responsibility
as a way to create market pressure for better security products and
services.</TE>
<TE>   The strategy repeatedly mentions the vulnerability of America's
computer networks to cyber attacks by terrorists; much of the urgency
behind the report was generated by fears that terrorist organizations
may use cyberspace to enhance their attacks in the physical world--a
point some security experts say has been vastly exaggerated by
government officials.</TE>
<TE>   But Clarke downplayed the terrorist threat as one among many.</TE>
<TE>   "Stop worrying about threats and start worrying about
vulnerabilities," he said, noting that perpetrators for many of the
most destructive computer viruses and worms--such as Nimda, which was
unleashed one year ago and caused billions of dollars of damage--have
never been discovered.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't really matter if the person who attacked your
operation is Al Qaeda ... a criminal cartel or a nation state," Clark
added.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Paller, research director for the Sans Institute, a
cooperative nonprofit security research organization that works with
industry and government agencies, applauded the new emphasis on
vulnerabilities and praised the report as a good first step.</TE>
<TE>   But he remains skeptical that a purely voluntary approach will
have enough impact in the long run.</TE>
<TE>   Cyber attacks are increasing year by year, despite prior warnings,
in part because "whenever there is a perceived conflict between self
interest and the national interest, industry has acted in its self
interest," he said.</TE>

<HD>A Fair Job of Milking a Camel</HD>
<DH>Pomona: Dairy owner shows his techniques. But the product
still needs FDA approval.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How many people does it take to milk a camel?</LD>
<LD>   Gil Riegler, owner of Oasis Camel Dairy, can answer that. Two--one
to actually milk the camel and the other to distract its calf, which
must be present for the camel to drop her milk.</LD>
<LD>   "Milking a camel is very tricky," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Riegler, 41, who lives with fiancee Nancy Kobert and 12 camels in
Ramona, demonstrates the proper technique several times a day at the
Los Angeles County Fair in Pomona.</TE>
<TE>   Many factors make milking a camel tougher than milking a cow, or
even a goat, said Riegler.</TE>
<TE>   First is the requisite speed. "Because camels are nomadic, they
only drop their milk for about 90 seconds, probably so the female is
able to keep up with the herd," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Second is the presence of the camel's calf. Unlike cows, camels
won't give milk unless their teats are stimulated by their offspring.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as the milk is there, you push the baby out of the
way--he gets some grain--and then you milk as fast as you can for 90
seconds," said Riegler, displaying a pail full of frothy white
camel's milk.</TE>
<TE>   In Middle Eastern deserts that are the one-hump dromedary's
natural habitat, nomads who keep camels can get about two liters of
milk a day, he said. "We've been combining a lot of techniques from
around the world, and we can get up to 12 liters."</TE>
<TE>   Riegler began working with camels about a decade ago, while
training animals as part of a program for the disabled that offered
riding and other activities.</TE>
<TE>   He discovered that if treated properly, camels weren't nasty and
rarely spit. Riegler studied dromedary husbandry in Israel, which has
camel dairies as do other Middle Eastern nations.</TE>
<TE>   At this stage, the Oasis Camel Dairy is more idea than working
dairy. Tuesday, when two dozen of the curious gathered in front of
the exhibit to see Goldie milked, Riegler told them, "We can't let
you taste it yet, because the FDA would be very angry with us."</TE>
<TE>   He hopes to have the dairy up and running, and blessed by the Food
and Drug Administration, by the end of next year. He already has the
stock (females like Goldie cost about $8,000) and plans to build
facilities on a 34-acre spread near Escondido.</TE>
<TE>   Riegler figures he's $70,000 away from selling ice-cold bottles of
camel's milk. Meanwhile, he shares the milk, and the occasional batch
of homemade camel cream cheese, with his friends.</TE>
<TE>   Esther Murphy, an exotic-animal trainer, who is helping Riegler
show the animals at the fair, gushes about Goldie's milk.</TE>
<TE>   "It tastes just like cow's milk to me, except it's a little
sweeter and lighter," said Murphy, 29. "On top of that, it's better
for you. It's lower in fat.... It's lower in sugar, higher in protein
and has about triple the amount of vitamin C."</TE>
<TE>   Julie Dantonoli, 46, of Garden Grove sought out the camel dairy
exhibit because she had heard that dromedary milk was low in fat and
highly nutritious.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be, like, the perfect food," she said. "I was
thinking of raising llamas, but I might try a couple of camels
instead."</TE>
<TE>   For now, the Oasis Camel Dairy is only marketing one product,
camel milk soap. There are six varieties, including one called Gold,
Frankincense &amp; Myrrh.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the one that people buy for stocking stuffers," Murphy
said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Arcelia Chavez carried her 4-year-old niece into the North Hollywood
police station last year and declared that she had drowned, a Los
Angeles police officer testified Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Officer Lizette Makarenko said she was working the front desk at
the station on Sept. 28, when Chavez walked in carrying a bundle in a
pink blanket. "She said, 'Help me. She drowned,' " she testified.</LD>
<LD>   But prosecutors allege that Chavez, 48, of North Hollywood, beat
Maria Isabel Cervantes to death because she spit out food and later
urinated in her pants.</LD>
<TE>   Chavez, who has pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and
assaulting a child causing her death, faces 25 years to life in
prison if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   In her opening statement, Deputy Dist. Atty. Maureen Green said
Chavez was in the dining room of her home feeding Maria Isabel a late
afternoon meal when the child began to spit out the food and Chavez
began hitting her.</TE>
<TE>   "Arcelia Chavez was getting more and more angry," Green said.</TE>
<TE>   Then the child wet her pants, and Chavez gave her a bath while
delivering "karate-like chops to the child," the prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   Each time she hit Maria Isabel, the girl would go underwater and
Chavez would drag her up by her hair, Green said.</TE>
<TE>   After Maria Isabel died, Chavez prepared a makeshift altar with a
candle and dressed her in a white dress, placing a doll next to her,
Green said.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, Chavez's daughter discovered her mother and the
dead child in a bedroom and urged the older woman to call
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez brought the child, still in the white dress and wrapped in
a pink towel, to the North Hollywood police station, Green said.</TE>
<TE>   There, Makarenko said Chavez told her that she didn't call for
help because she didn't have a phone.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez also complained of constant headaches and said she wanted
to die with the child, Makarenko testified. The officer testified
that Chavez said she had never lost her temper like this but that she
didn't elaborate on what she'd done when she lost her temper.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez's attorney, Dennis G. Cohen, did not make an opening
statement Tuesday. Testimony is set to continue today before Superior
Court Judge Leland Harris.</TE>

<HD>Panel Talks of Chief Candidates</HD>
<DH>LAPD: The Police Commission tries to narrow the field of 13
to its top three choices to lead the department.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Members of the Los Angeles Police Commission spent much of the day
Tuesday discussing their choices for the next chief of the LAPD, but
adjourned without reaching a decision on their top three choices.</LD>
<LD>   The commission is expected to convene again Thursday to try to
narrow the list of 13 contenders.</LD>
<LD>   "We are going to keep going at it until we get it right," said
commission President Rick Caruso. "We've been debating back and
forth, and I think it's starting to come together."</LD>
<TE>   Caruso added that the commission remains undecided, and disputed a
report that the panel had reached agreement. "It's just wrong," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the LAPD insiders being considered for the job are Assistant
Chief David Gascon, Deputy Chiefs David Kalish and Margaret York, and
Cmdrs. George Gascon, James McDonnell and Sharon Papa.</TE>
<TE>   Candidates from outside the department include two former LAPD
deputy chiefs: Portland, Ore., Police Chief Mark Kroeker and Oxnard
Police Chief Art Lopez.</TE>
<TE>   Also in the running are Sacramento Chief Art Venegas, Santa Ana
Chief Paul Walters, former New York Police Commissioner William
Bratton, Cambridge, Mass., Chief Ronnie Watson and former
Philadelphia Police Commissioner John Timoney.</TE>
<TE>   The commission began interviewing candidates two weeks ago. After
the commissioners finish their deliberations, they will forward their
list of three finalists to Mayor James K. Hahn, who will make the
final decision--subject to City Council confirmation.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso said the commission spent hours in closed session Tuesday
going over extensive background checks. They also received a briefing
from Hahn's chief of staff, Tim McOsker, who interviewed former
colleagues of the outside candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "We're taking a lot of time because we want to be very
deliberate," Caruso said. The city began the search for a new chief
in April, after the commission voted not to grant Bernard C. Parks a
second five-year term. Fifty-one people applied for the job. The list
was first narrowed to 21, then to 13.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn kicked off a media campaign this week to prepare the city for
his selection. In an Op-Ed piece and radio and TV appearances
Tuesday, Hahn said he is looking for a strong leader, someone who can
reduce the crime rate, boost morale, recruit new officers and reform
the department. He also said he wants a chief with whom he can have a
solid working relationship.</TE>
<TE>   Some are watching his decision for its potential ramifications on
Hahn's own future.</TE>

<HD>Maritime School Anchors Its Teaching in Practicality</HD>
<DH>Students at a Northern California academy get hands-on
training on voyage to South Pacific.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Her eyes glow even when describing her most menial shipboard tasks,
but it is the isolation that calls Makahla Moss to the sea.</LD>
<LD>   A senior at the California Maritime Academy, Moss is able to
indulge her enthusiasm for the water during the three international
cruises required of every student--a sort of driver's training for
aspiring sailors.</LD>
<LD>   After their first and third years, the students travel on the
school's training ship, a former Navy vessel dubbed the Golden Bear,
which this year steamed from the Vallejo school to the South Pacific
and back.</LD>
<TE>   During the two-month trip, the 140 students on board the 500-foot
vessel do most of the work, with staff members on hand to advise.</TE>
<TE>   As the boat cruised from Long Beach to Catalina on a recent
morning, Moss and a handful of others loaded the ship's mooring lines
hand-over-hand into the ship's belly while some monitored the gauges
in the engine room's steamy heat. On the bridge, the ship's control
center, three students kept watch as one steered and two pored over
navigation charts of the San Pedro Channel.</TE>
<TE>   Even as she labored, Moss frequently turned her sunburned face to
the water, grinning spontaneously as the sun rose over the calm
expanse of turquoise ocean.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so beautiful," said Moss, 23, of Benicia. "You just see out
to the horizon with nothing in front of you but endless seclusion."</TE>
<TE>   Moss' passion for the sea is echoed by most of the students on
track for one of the school's five bachelor's degrees, including
marine engineering and marine transportation. Many of the students'
tasks are below deck: toilet repair, for example, or cafeteria
cleanup and engine room duty.</TE>
<TE>   The California Maritime Academy, part of the California State
University system, is one of the country's seven college
degree-granting marine schools and the only one on the West Coast.
After taking the seamanship classes along with the usual college
regimen including English and history, students graduate from the
academy with a bachelor's degree and a ship's license allowing them
to operate almost any vessel afloat.</TE>
<TE>   A license can take twice as long to earn if a student goes
straight into the work force, and many students said they didn't want
the commitment of joining the military. The academy says it has a
nearly 100% job placement rate for its graduates, whose careers
include piloting cruise ships as well as working onshore in
marine-related businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Aboard the Golden Bear, a handful of students in blue jumpsuits
keep constant watch on the ship's speed and the dozens of gauges that
cover the back wall and a 20-foot center console.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Golden Bear is docked in Vallejo during the school year
for training exercises, students become familiar with the machinery
well before the ship leaves shore. But it takes seeing the ship in
action--whether cruising at full speed or curving slowly around
coastlines--to grasp how it all works, sophomore Trevor Rafferty
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, I knew conceptually what all these things should do, but
I didn't really have any idea what was going on," said Rafferty, 20,
of San Diego. "Now I feel comfortable with doing pretty much anything
down here."</TE>
<TE>   That kind of hands-on experience gives students an invaluable
opportunity to physically learn what they read about in the
classroom, said ship Capt. Paul Leyda, the university's marine
manager.</TE>
<TE>   "You can do it on a chalkboard, you can even go do practical
training on a boat alongside the school, but this is the real thing,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the 12-year-old Golden Bear has some out-of-date
equipment, Leyda said training on the ship prepares students for any
kind of seagoing experience.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to adapt to a particular vessel, but seamanship is
seamanship," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The staff members on board tend to cluster in the bridge area,
watching closely as the students shout commands and providing extra
pairs of eyes for those keeping watch. The professionals spot small
skiffs and other objects when they're just shadows on the horizon,
patiently pointing them out to the squinting students.</TE>
<TE>   Even those with little or no prior boating experience learn
quickly once the ship is under their control, instructor Terry Ruff
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just here to answer questions," he said. "The only time I
step in is when something's going sour."</TE>
<TE>   More than the ship duties, it's the leadership opportunities that
change the students during their cruise, Ruff said.</TE>
<TE>   "The growth is amazing," he said. "They come in all fresh-faced
and bright-eyed, and by the end, they're real sailors."</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore Melany Weaver said commanding others has transformed her
from timid to confident.</TE>
<TE>   "At first I would give orders and my voice would squeak, so no one
listened," said Weaver, 19, of Lodi. "Now I feel like a different
person."</TE>
<TE>   Although only about 20 of the students aboard are female, most of
the students said that gender doesn't matter once the work starts.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you show that you can work hard and make an effort, no one
notices if you're a girl," Weaver said. "When you're out here
everyone is depending on each other. All people notice is if you're
not pulling your weight."</TE>
<TE>   More than the disproportion in gender, visitors to the ship are
often struck by an atmosphere of uniforms and stringent rules that
some students call "pseudomilitary." All students are called cadets,
and most only get 1 1/2 days of shore leave when the ship docks.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a pleasure cruise," said senior Kevin Freese, wearing
a starched white dress uniform with a wry smile that reveals a
pierced tongue he admits is very much against regulations.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he added, there is no better preparation for the marine
industry than going to a maritime academy. "You're going to be way
ahead of the best in your field," said Freese, 21, of Benicia.</TE>
<TE>   For sophomore Hank Peretti, a former Merchant Marine from Boston
who has worked on boats for 12 years, the degree will advance his
career so he will be able to get his officer's license more quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm getting to skip a lot of steps on the ladder," said Peretti,
26.</TE>
<TE>   With experience, he handles some of the tasks normally reserved
for upperclassmen, such as directing a crane maneuvering a load of
alcohol and food onto the boat for an administrator reception.</TE>
<TE>   When they're not working, the students rest in their rooms,
gathering at night on the ship's rear deck to lie under the stars.</TE>
<TE>   Like Moss, Bob Humann enjoys the water even as he works--although
as one of the watch keepers, he's thinking more about possible whale
collisions than the beauty of the sun-dappled waves.</TE>
<TE>   The 19-year-old from Lafayette said cruising on the Golden Bear
was what sold him on a career at sea.</TE>
<TE>   "You can decide right here and now if this is what you want for
your life," he said.</TE>

<HD>Davis Signs 2 Key Measures Against Crime</HD>
<DH>Legislation: One restores the Son of Sam law. Another
allows the forcible taking of DNA samples from inmates.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation Tuesday to restore the so-called
Son of Sam law in California and to authorize the forcible extraction
of DNA specimens from prisoners who may have committed other
long-unsolved crimes.</LD>
<LD>   "I guarantee you, when we have those samples, a host of crimes
will be solved," Davis said as he signed the DNA bill by Senate
Republican leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga. "It will bring
peace of mind and closure to victims."</LD>
<LD>   The governor also signed a bill by Sen. Bruce McPherson (R-Santa
Cruz), a candidate for lieutenant governor, that will allow crime
victims to sue their attackers in civil court if the felon tries to
profit by selling an account of the crime to a book publisher or
moviemaker.</LD>
<TE>   Last spring, the state Supreme Court struck down California's Son
of Sam law on grounds it was so broad that it violated the free
speech rights of convicts.</TE>
<TE>   The new measure (SB 1887) bypasses the 1st Amendment issue.
Instead, it is designed to prevent felons from profiting by
authorizing their victims to sue for any funds produced by ventures
arising out of the crime.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuits can be filed up to 10 years after a felon finishes
parole.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just not right for a criminal to profit from his crime," an
emotional McPherson said at a bill-signing ceremony in Los Angeles.
His own son, Hunter, 27, was murdered on a San Francisco street in
November.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses at the ceremony included Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee
Baca, Orange County Sheriff Michael S. Carona, Dist. Atty. Paul J.
Pfingst of San Diego County and victims' rights activists.</TE>
<TE>   The DNA bill (SB 1242) authorizes county jail and state prison
authorities to use "reasonable force" to extract DNA samples from
criminals who refuse to give them up voluntarily.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, officials must get a court order at a cost of about
$15,000 each to forcibly extract a specimen.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Corrections said there are about 400 such felons
in state prisons, down from about 900 earlier in the year.</TE>
<TE>   It is a misdemeanor for a prisoner to refuse to provide a DNA
sample from blood and saliva as well as a thumb and palm print. But a
misdemeanor conviction has virtually no impact on a convict already
serving a long prison sentence, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Brulte predicted the bill could lead to breakthroughs in
potentially thousands of "cold case" crimes that have gone unsolved
because prisoners refused to voluntarily provide DNA specimens that
could implicate them.</TE>
<TE>   In the last four years, officials say, the state's DNA databank
has connected 83 cases of unsolved violent crimes to felons who
served time behind bars.</TE>
<TE>   The governor also signed legislation on energy-related issues,
including a bill (SB 1269) by Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon) that
would try to stabilize the state's electric energy supply by
requiring power plant developers to actually build new plants or risk
losing their permits.</TE>
<TE>   State officials contend that the power supply has been jeopardized
by a speculative market for power plant permits, in which developers
buy and sell the licenses without ever building a plant.</TE>
<TE>   The bill will require developers who acquire project permits to
begin construction within a year. If a company doesn't begin a
project, the state public power authority is authorized to seize the
permit and build the plant or seek a private partner to proceed with
the project.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Supervisors' Hands Tied in D.A. Case</HD>
<DH>Government: An outside legal review says grand jury's
allegations can be addressed only by the state attorney general
because the board lacks authority to intervene.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Board of Supervisors doesn't have the authority to take action
against Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas despite a grand
jury report accusing him of political favoritism and intervening on
behalf of campaign contributors, a report released Tuesday said.</LD>
<LD>   An outside legal review, commissioned by the board, found that
county supervisors cannot intervene because Rackauckas is an
independently elected official with separate powers under the state
Constitution. Only the state attorney general can supervise his
office, the review concluded.</LD>
<LD>   "For this reason, we are forwarding a copy of the grand jury
report and our response to the attorney general, so that his office
may address any issues that he feels warrant his attention," the
report said.</LD>
<TE>   Nathan Barankin, a spokesman for Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer's office,
said he knows of no current investigation involving Rackauckas.</TE>
<TE>   The county report backs up the view of several legal and public
policy experts who have said the Board of Supervisors would have
difficulty acting on the grand jury's findings. The board approves
the office's annual budget, but the district attorney answers to
voters and not to the supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   The board could pass a resolution criticizing or censuring the
district attorney, but the move would have only symbolic
significance.</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury report, prepared with assistance from Lockyer's
office, accused Rackauckas of intervening in criminal cases at the
request of political supporters, hiring family members of friends
over more-qualified candidates and using public resources for
personal business.</TE>
<TE>   One of the panel's recommendations is to bar the district attorney
from hiring decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Rackuackas has defended his record, saying the grand jury was
misled by disgruntled employees who backed his political foes. In his
own 153-page response, Rackauckas said the grand jury presented a
"one-sided" view of his office.</TE>
<TE>   The board's response, released Tuesday, was prepared by the San
Leandro law firm of Meyers, Nave, Riback, Silver &amp; Wilson. It will be
discussed by supervisors at next Tuesday's meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors were reviewing the findings Tuesday. Supervisor Todd
Spitzer, who has been outspoken in his concerns over the grand jury
report, declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors hired the firm in July to respond to the grand jury,
which detailed 92 findings and made 42 recommendations after
interviewing 68 witnesses and viewing 400 exhibits.</TE>
<TE>   The responses to most of the findings conclude that the district
attorney has sole authority and broad discretion to run his office,
hire employees and determine the means of prosecuting crimes. Many of
his employees are "at-will" and don't have the same protections as
regular county employees.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's authority was confirmed, the review said,
by a 1975 lawsuit filed against Orange County by then-Dist. Atty.
Cecil Hicks, who successfully challenged a plan by the Board of
Supervisors to reorganize his office.</TE>
<TE>   The county review could not respond to some of the grand jury's
findings because the conclusions were subjective, such as whether
certain hiring decisions were fair or certain prosecutorial decisions
were appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   The county wasn't given copies of the grand jury testimony, the
review said, and had no independent knowledge of the alleged
misdeeds.</TE>
<TE>   "Such [responses] should not suggest that we condone conduct which
is contrary to good public administration or that we pass judgment on
the work of the grand jury," the review said.</TE>
<TE>   The review concurred with a finding by the grand jury that a plan
to give wallet badges to contributors to a foundation established by
Rackauckas "exhibited poor judgment."</TE>
<TE>   That plan was ill-advised "to the extent that the use of such
badges could confuse the public," the board review said. The badge
idea was considered but never pursued, Rackauckas said in his
response.</TE>

<HD>Candidates Stake Out Common Ground</HD>
<DH>Politics: Bill Simon Jr. and Peter M. Camejo aim attacks at
the governor rather than each other.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a debate most notable for the absence of Gov. Gray Davis,
Republican gubernatorial nominee Bill Simon Jr. and Green Party
candidate Peter M. Camejo took pains Tuesday to find common ground as
they laid out radically different agendas for California.</LD>
<LD>   On immigration, civil rights, crime and other issues, Simon and
Camejo avoided attacks on one another and pounded the Democratic
incumbent instead.</LD>
<LD>   Davis has "put a for-sale sign on Sacramento," Camejo said,
echoing one of Simon's main campaign themes. "It's all based on
money."</LD>
<TE>   Simon used the Beverly Hills debate to elevate the stature of a
Green Party candidate who has barely registered in the polls, but who
could siphon votes from Davis, a centrist Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   The debate produced the unlikely spectacle of Simon, a
self-described "conservative Republican," heaping praise on a onetime
Berkeley radical who favors legalization of marijuana and higher
taxes on the rich.</TE>
<TE>   "Peter is in this race for the right reasons," Simon said. "He
cares about people, and he cares about making sure that he's got real
ideas and real solutions."</TE>
<TE>   The debate was sponsored by New California Media, an association
of ethnic media organizations, and the Greenlining Institute, a
coalition of minority groups that promotes economic development in
the state's urban areas.</TE>
<TE>   Greenlining Institute leaders criticized Davis for rejecting their
invitation to debate, saying it showed disrespect.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sad to report that Gov. Davis has consistently snubbed
minorities," said Paul Turner, senior program manager at the
Greenlining Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Davis spokesman Roger Salazar said the governor had shown respect
to minority voters with his actions, including a minimum wage hike
and expanded access to health care and higher education. He said
Davis would debate Simon once or twice in October.</TE>
<TE>   "Respect doesn't have anything to do with whether you show up to a
Greenlining event," Salazar said.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the debate focused on racial issues. Both Camejo and Simon
spoke out against traffic stops based upon race.</TE>
<TE>   "It's against everything our country was founded on," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   But on other issues, Camejo and Simon offered contrasting
opinions.</TE>
<TE>   On immigrant rights, Camejo said he would sign two bills awaiting
Davis' signature or veto: One would provide driver's licenses to
undocumented workers, and the other would give farm workers the right
to mediation of stalled contract talks with growers.</TE>
<TE>   Camejo said he would sign them "in protest," because the
Legislature had "watered down" both measures at Davis' behest.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, however, said he opposed both bills. He said he could not
sign the driver's license measure in the absence of "comprehensive
immigration reform." He also said there was already an "appropriate
balance" between farm workers and growers in contract talks.</TE>
<TE>   More broadly, Camejo called for legalization of undocumented
immigrants to abolish the "caste system" in California. Simon said he
favored a guest worker program advocated by President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   One question stumped both candidates: What was their stand on the
Nov. 5 ballot proposals for the secession of Hollywood and the San
Fernando Valley from Los Angeles?</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't been able to really figure it out," said Camejo, who
lives outside Oakland in Walnut Creek.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad you said that, Peter," Simon interrupted.</TE>
<TE>   "Honesty once in a while is good," Camejo responded.</TE>
<TE>   "That was what you learned in the '60s," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   Camejo, chief executive of the Progressive Asset Management
investment firm, said he leans against secession for fear it could
harm the poor. But Simon, who moved to Los Angeles from New Jersey 12
years ago, took no position on secession.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly absent from the debate was one of the main lines of attack
Davis has used against Simon: allegations that the GOP nominee has
been an incompetent businessman. Davis' argument was blunted last
week when a judge tossed aside a fraud verdict against Simon's family
investment firm--a case Simon mentioned when asked to define
corporate misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad it's not last week at this time," Simon responded with a
chuckle. "I would say that corporate misconduct is well-defined in
the laws."</TE>
<TE>   Simon also borrowed a Davis campaign tactic on the state budget.
After weathering criticism that he had failed to say how he would
balance the books amid a $24-billion deficit, Simon asked Camejo
where he would find funding for his proposals, which include
universal health care.</TE>
<TE>   Camejo's response: higher taxes for the rich and a windfall of up
to $3 billion from the legalization of marijuana. He did not explain
how he arrived at the figure.</TE>
<TE>   On crime, Simon reiterated his support for the death penalty,
which Camejo opposes. But Simon also said he could "understand why
people would consider" a moratorium on capital punishment.</TE>
<TE>   The debate sponsors did not invite any of the other minor-party
candidates: Iris Adam of the Natural Law Party, Gary David Copeland
of the Libertarian Party, and Reinhold Gulke of the American
Independent Party.</TE>

<HD>Fans Urge Fair Board to Keep Raceway Open</HD>
<DH>Recreation: Dozens turn out to ask for renewal of Seaside
Park contract. A subcommittee will be formed to negotiate with the
promoter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA BLANCHARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Calling the Ventura Raceway an integral part of the community, dozens
of supporters urged the Ventura County Fair Board on Tuesday to renew
the contract between the operator of the racetrack and the county
fairgrounds.</LD>
<LD>   Following a four-hour hearing in a packed room of Seaside Park's
Derby Club, board members postponed a decision on whether to renew
the contract, which expires in December. Instead, they voted to form
a subcommittee to negotiate with raceway promoter Jim Naylor.</LD>
<LD>   Naylor vowed to work with the board to keep the raceway operating
by finding ways to reduce noise at the track and addressing other
concerns, such as generating more revenue for the fairgrounds.</LD>
<TE>   "We're never going to make a lot of money for you," Naylor told
board members. "But we care a lot about the place, and you can't
weigh that."</TE>
<TE>   Board members are creating a master plan for Seaside Park and have
said one of their primary goals is to find ways to raise more money
and better serve county residents.</TE>
<TE>   The panel has several options to consider, including limiting the
number of races for the 2003 season or discontinuing Naylor's
contract.</TE>
<TE>   About 50 people spoke during Tuesday's hearing, most describing
the racetrack as an important attraction for both tourists and the
community.</TE>
<TE>   "Car racing is an important part of the fabric of Southern
California life," said Steve Wilson, a racing enthusiast who supports
renewing Naylor's contract.</TE>
<TE>   He said the weekly races pump thousands of dollars into the local
economy, as people travel from miles around to attend races at the
only dirt track in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Speakers also cited the lack of other low-cost, family-friendly
activities available locally on the weekends.</TE>
<TE>   And they questioned the logic of removing the raceway before an
alternative revenue-generating business had been lined up to take its
place.</TE>
<TE>   Earl McPhail, a former fair board member from Santa Paula, told
panel members that they should hold off on taking any action until
they complete their master plan.</TE>
<TE>   "This is family entertainment at its absolute best," he said.
"Really consider what you're doing today."</TE>
<TE>   A handful of speakers said they wouldn't miss the racetrack if it
were closed.</TE>
<TE>   "The noise level has gone up dramatically in the last few years,
and it's not just ambient noise," said Doug Halter, a longtime
downtown resident. "It pretty much flies in the face of [downtown]
revitalization efforts."</TE>
<TE>   Sandra Sanders agreed that the noise is a problem. "I do not find
the roar of the motors enjoyable," she said, adding that she also
opposes the idea of holding more concerts at Seaside Park. "The
sounds generated in the park should stay there."</TE>
<TE>   But Roger Gibbs, the park's CEO and general manager, said
atmospheric conditions make it nearly impossible to prevent
occasional noise.</TE>
<TE>   "Fairgrounds generate noise no matter what we do," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He noted steps that the park and Naylor have taken to lower noise
levels, such as planting trees to block sound, monitoring noise
levels throughout the city during the races and attempting to install
mufflers on the cars.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Mayor Brian Brennan offered several suggestions, including
establishing independent monitoring of noise levels at the
fairgrounds and discontinuing mid-week practice racing during the
evenings.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue is not getting rid of racing," he said. "It's the noise
stupid."</TE>

<LD>   In a moment meant to stoke feelings of national unity and purge
the somber hangover of the terrorist attacks, students across the
country were asked to recite the Pledge of Allegiance at exactly 11
a.m. Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   While some schools were unaware of the second annual pledge drill,
students at places like George S. Patton Elementary in Garden Grove
had prepared for the event and Tuesday followed the lead of President
Bush, who marked the occasion by saluting the flag at the East
Literature Magnet School in Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   "It was fun to sing together," said Sarah Zito, 11, one of nearly
1,000 students who gathered with Principal Barb Gibbons to recite the
pledge and, with a prompt from a tape player, sing the national
anthem.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't as uptight as the ceremony we did for Sept. 11 last
week," Sarah said. "It was a little more relaxed. I'm relieved."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Secretary of Education Rod Paige urged students to
participate in the second annual Pledge Across America but left the
final decision with principals. Some chose not to mark the moment
while others weren't even aware the patriotic event had rolled around
again.</TE>
<TE>   Seen as a way of channeling the roiling emotions of students in
the wake of the terrorist attacks, the synchronized pledge was first
held last Oct. 12. It fulfilled the dream of Villa Park resident
Paula Burton, who 10 years earlier began a campaign for a nationally
coordinated pledge as a vow of unity.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Delaine Eastin, state superintendent for public
instruction, sent notices to school administrators in support of the
ceremony but emphasized that the patriotic drill was voluntary. Also,
the pledge was moved forward to Sept. 17--Constitution Day.</TE>
<TE>   "It's another way for educators to talk about American ideals,
such as freedom and citizenship and the words of the Pledge of
Allegiance," said Nicole Winger, a spokeswoman for the state
Department of Education.</TE>
<TE>   Winger said the national pledge had nothing to do with the legal
battle over the phrase "under God" in the oath. In June, the U.S. 9th
Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the phrase unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   California public schools are required to conduct daily
appropriate patriotic exercises, and the pledge is one way, Eastin's
letter noted. Still, she urged caution among educators and school
employees to heed the religious and personal beliefs of students who
might not want to participate.</TE>
<TE>   At Oxnard Street Elementary School in North Hollywood, all 750
students recited the oath together, but 50 minutes after the official
start time. Although the school felt compelled to participate in the
national pledge, reading lessons came first.</TE>
<TE>   Some educators say the event is a chance to bring up challenging
topics.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fine to say the pledge in a synchronized fashion, but
teachers should use the event as a springboard into a discussion
about its meaning," said Chuck Quigley, executive director of the
Center for Civic Education. "What's the meaning of 'liberty and
justice for all'? Should we have a pledge?"</TE>
<TE>   For Kaya Vyas, the Pledge Across America was unquestionably a vow
of unity for youths.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always been separated by grade level during these school
assemblies," said Kaya, 11. "This is the first time our whole school
has really come together to celebrate patriotism and togetherness.
I'm still in awe from it."</TE>

<HD>Van Dams Agree With Jury Decision</HD>
<DH>Penalty: Death for her daughter's killer is 'right,' but
life in prison without parole would be acceptable, mother says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The mother of slain 7-year-old Danielle van Dam said Tuesday that she
believes it is right that the jury recommended death for her
daughter's killer--David Westerfield--but that she is prepared to
accept a sentence of life in prison without parole.</LD>
<LD>   "What mattered most was that this monster could never again hurt
another innocent child," a tearful Brenda van Dam told reporters
gathered at La Jolla Shores, a seaside park that had been a favorite
of Danielle's.</LD>
<LD>   "We feel that the justice system revealed the truth and that
Danielle's murderer has been held accountable," said Van Dam, with
her husband, Damon, by her side. "That was our hope--that Danielle's
death would not go unanswered."</LD>
<TE>   As witnesses at the trial, the Van Dams were prohibited from
discussing the case until after the penalty phase.</TE>
<TE>   The same jury that on Aug. 21 convicted Westerfield, 50, a former
neighbor of the Van Dams, of kidnapping, murder and possession of
child pornography also recommended Monday that he be executed.
Superior Court Judge William Mudd, who still could reduce the
sentence to life in prison, set Nov. 22 for sentencing.</TE>
<TE>   Legal analysts say it is highly unlikely that Mudd will reject the
jury's recommendation. In nine of 10 death-penalty cases in the last
eight years in San Diego, judges have affirmed the sentence. Mudd did
so in the only other death-penalty case in his court.</TE>
<TE>   After reading a statement, the Van Dams answered questions,
including one about the impact of having defense attorney Steven
Feldman make an issue of their use of marijuana and experimentation
with extramarital sexual relations.</TE>
<TE>   Feldman asserted that the Van Dams' lifestyle may have left
Danielle vulnerable to attack from someone who had been invited to
the home for illicit purposes.</TE>
<TE>   Feldman quizzed the couple on their use of marijuana, whether
Brenda had been "dirty dancing" with Westerfield, and which of their
friends they had slept with and how many times.</TE>
<TE>   "It was difficult to actually answer all those questions," Brenda
van Dam said. "But we knew in our hearts it was irrelevant to the
case. We knew the right thing to do was to get out there and get past
it so [the jurors] could see what the case was made of: all that
evidence."</TE>
<TE>   Two jurors said Monday that they had been particularly influenced
by Danielle's blood found on Westerfield's jacket, other forensic
evidence tying him to the crime, and his rambling and inconsistent
comments to police about his whereabouts the weekend Danielle
disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   Damon van Dam, 36, a software engineer, and Brenda, 39, a
self-employed book distributor, attended the trial each day,
including when gruesome autopsy photos were being displayed. Damon
van Dam was banned for several days when bailiffs suggested he was
"mad-dogging" Westerfield outside court and might pose a threat.</TE>
<TE>   Van Dam said that the bailiffs had misunderstood his intentions
and that he never meant to threaten Westerfield. "I just wanted to
let him know I was there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Feldman declined to comment Tuesday on possible appeal issues.
Appeals are automatic in California death-penalty cases.</TE>
<TE>   One possible appeal basis is Mudd's rejection of the defense bid
to have the misdemeanor charge of possession of child pornography
separated from the murder and kidnap case. Feldman argued vehemently
that the child pornography would so prejudice the jury against his
client that he could not get a fair trial.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield did not testify at the trial or in the penalty phase.
"We really wanted David Westerfield to speak to us and give us what
his state of mind was," one juror said.</TE>

<HD>New Campaign, Free Hotline Target Graffiti</HD>
<DH>Vandalism: Mayor and transit officials promise that any
tagging will be erased within 24 hours. Funds will come from MTA
budget.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Under a new anti-graffiti campaign launched Tuesday, any graffiti
reported to a toll-free number, (800) 611-2489, will be removed
within 24 hours.</LD>
<LD>   That was the promise made by Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn and
transit officials gathered at Sierra Park Elementary School in El
Sereno to kick off the campaign.</LD>
<LD>   "Graffiti is something that makes people mad when they see it,"
Hahn told scores of children at the ceremony. "It's put there by
people who don't like the neighborhood."</LD>
<TE>   Appearing to support the drive was Los Angeles Galaxy soccer star
Cobi Jones, who said he grew up in the city and believes graffiti "is
very important to stop."</TE>
<TE>   A three-month campaign sponsored by the Los Angeles Department of
Public Works, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the
Galaxy will use panels on the sides of buses.</TE>
<TE>   John Catoe of the MTA said the agency spent more than $5 million
last year repairing damage done by graffiti vandals, including etched
bus and train windows, torn seats and other damage. The campaign will
be financed from the agency's anti-vandalism budget.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to send a message loud and clear to the vandals who get
their kicks destroying our equipment," Catoe said. "You're hurting
your family, friends and neighbors who depend on public
transportation. You will get caught and you will pay."</TE>
<TE>   Penalties for a first offense range from 12 months' summary
probation to detention in a youth facility or up to 1,000 hours
community service. Multiple offenders can be fined $450 and receive
five days in jail or 2,000 hours of community service.</TE>

<HD>Mary Lou Heard, 57; Longtime Owner of Noted O.C. Nursery</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mary Lou Heard, the longtime proprietor of a popular Westminster
nursery called Heard's Country Garden, has died after a two-year bout
with cancer. She was 57.</LD>
<LD>   Heard, of Midway City, was a struggling single mother who'd moved
to Southern California from Ohio in her early 20s to seek a better
life. She was 31 and being treated for depression when she developed
a passion for horticulture.</LD>
<LD>   "I was busy and productive," she later told a Times reporter. "I
tied up the sweet peas; I asked for some flowers and over the course
of months I planted them.</LD>
<TE>   "When you're preoccupied, you have time to heal."</TE>
<TE>   She began attending horticulture classes at Orange Coast College
and, on weekends, selling baskets of herbs at the swap meet on the
Orange County Fairgrounds. That eventually led to the vacant lot on
Westminster's Edwards Street--site of a former chinchilla farm--where
she opened her nursery in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   An immediate hit, the nursery became widely known as a place to
get unusual perennials--the kinds of untamed, extravagant and odd
plants that were just beginning to have a wide appeal in gardening
circles in the mid-1980s.</TE>
<TE>   "There were no guidelines," she later said of the early years at
the nursery, often described as old-fashioned and eclectic.</TE>
<TE>   "I was allowed to grow slow. My focus was not on money, but rather
on that packet of unusual seeds."</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the nursery garnered some major accolades. This
year, Los Angeles magazine listed it as No. 41 in its Best of L.A.
issue: "an American dream of an English garden club, knowledgeable,
chatty and open to all."</TE>
<TE>   And Sunset magazine frequently highlighted its stock.</TE>
<TE>   "More than any other nursery I know, Heard's was stamped with the
owner's personality," Sharon Cohoon, a senior garden writer for
Sunset, recently told The Times. "Mary Lou saw no reason you couldn't
have a slightly wild, slightly country garden in the middle of
suburbia."</TE>
<TE>   After being diagnosed with colon cancer two years ago, Heard began
taking stock.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, she closed the nursery after conducting a weeks-long
final sale.</TE>
<TE>   "One woman drove up from San Diego and spent all of her vacation
money," Lisa Spruill, Heard's daughter, said Tuesday. "Instead of
taking a vacation this year, she spent it on plants."</TE>
<TE>   Then the well-known lover of greens settled down to spend the
summer with her family.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not called upon to think about how close to death we are,"
she told The Times last month, "but rather to consider the gifts that
have been given to us."</TE>
<TE>   "I had no idea that my mom had touched so many people," Spruill
said. "Any time you drive by and see an amazing garden, you can know
that she had a hand in bringing flowers like that to people's lives."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to her daughter, Heard is survived by two
grandchildren--Shelby, 10, and Cailey Spruill, 8--and son-in-law
Steve Spruill.</TE>
<TE>   Visitation is scheduled Thursday, 4 to 8 p.m. at Heritage Memorial
Services in Huntington Beach, followed by services Friday at Calvary
West Grove in Garden Grove and interment at Westminster Memorial
Park.</TE>
<TE>   A scholarship fund for horticulture students has been set up in
Heard's name by the California Assn. of Nurserymen.</TE>
<TE>   Donations to the Mary Lou Heard Scholarship Fund for the Study of
Horticulture should be mailed to 3947 Lennane Drive, Suite 150,
Sacramento, CA 95834-1973.</TE>

<HD>Businesses Clash Over Downtown Santa Ana Strategy</HD>
<DH>Dispute: Effort by merchants group and city to woo more
diverse shoppers will 'bleach' area, Latinos say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Merchants in downtown Santa Ana have engaged a mediator to help
resolve deep-seated differences over public relations and advertising
campaigns intended to draw more diverse shoppers to their
predominantly Latino business district.</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Ana Downtown Business Assn. has severely cut back on
advertising in Spanish-language newspapers and radio, instead
directing the trade group's dues to improvements such as more
lighting and landscaping, cleaner sidewalks and benches. Business
owners with mostly Latino clienteles say they depend on such
advertising to survive.</LD>
<LD>   The dispute pits an old guard of merchants against newer leaders
of the 635-member trade group, and it comes as tensions are rising
downtown because of the city's promotion of the nascent Artists
Village and its offers of incentives to certain companies and
developers to do business downtown.</LD>
<TE>   The Orange County Human Relations Commission has set up a
mediation session Sept. 25, said Rusty Kennedy, the commission's
executive director.</TE>
<TE>   Many merchants say the association and city officials are trying
to "bleach" the downtown by de-emphasizing Latino merchants in favor
of the multi-block area of shops, galleries and restaurants
attracting mostly non-Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   "We are too ethnic for Santa Ana," said Louis Pescarmona, who has
owned the Joyeria Guadalajara jewelry store for 27 years. "There are
people with political and social muscle who want to put the pressure
on us. They want to remake downtown. Instead of being 80% to 90%
Latino, they want us to be a small part of the downtown. What we have
now works. What they are proposing is a maybe."</TE>
<TE>   Arturo Lomeli, a downtown dentist and president of the business
association, said the unhappy merchants are trying "to exclude
everyone but immigrants."</TE>
<TE>   "They are crying wolf that everyone wants to eliminate them,"
Lomeli said. "Can you imagine a group of [white] merchants in Irvine
saying they only want a certain kind of customer? It would cause
quite an uproar."</TE>
<TE>   Downtown Development Manager Matthew Lamb said he hoped the
mediation would lead to a "common goal that will make a stronger
downtown."</TE>
<TE>   But Lamb said opponents of promoting Artists Village are
represented on the 22-member association board that voted on how the
downtown is marketed. Lamb serves as the association's executive
director but does not vote.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the city has invested ... millions and millions of
dollars into the Fiesta Marketplace, a Latino shopping area"
downtown, he said. "We need new catalysts for redevelopment so
downtown has a lot of different textures.... We are competing for
everybody's dollars. The more you can make your downtown a diverse
and multilayer experience, the better off you are."</TE>
<TE>   But Pescarmona, who said he pays $1,000 in annual dues to the
business association, resents a new policy that nearly eliminates
Spanish-language advertising.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Romero, owner of a Roman Catholic gift shop, also complained
that the city and the association are "not including us in decisions.
They are not even promoting the fact that we are here."</TE>
<TE>   Pescarmona, who formed a Concerned Merchants Committee a year ago,
went so far as to make buttons and posters with slogans such as "Say
No to Ethnic Quotas," referring to the city's efforts to bring more
diversity downtown.</TE>
<TE>   But jeweler Teresa Saldivar said they misinterpret the trade
group's mission. "What's so ugly about this is that they are in the
United States," Saldivar said. "They fail to understand that as a
board of directors, you have to serve all the constituencies. They
are only concerned about their businesses. They want Hispanic radio,
Hispanic newspapers. Our argument is that we need more than that."</TE>
<TE>   Lomeli estimated that over the past 16 years, more than $75,000 of
annual business association dues was spent on Spanish-language
advertising to promote downtown events. This year, less than $15,000
will go toward advertising, and part of that will be spent on
English-language media, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Each business pays an annual business license fee, and that money
is given to the association. A medium-sized business pays about $300.
In the past, any dues not spent on advertising were donated to
nonprofit groups, said Lomeli, who became the association's president
three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the association will spend $120,000 on a three-year,
$400,000 street-improvement plan. Next year, it plans to put $80,000
more into the project, with the city picking up the remaining
$200,000.</TE>
<TE>   The work will begin next month on 4th Street from Broadway to Main
Street. New trees will replace old ones in corner plazas. Irrigation
systems and lighting to illuminate the trees will be installed.
Benches have been placed at the corners.</TE>
<TE>   "We see these improvements ... as a form of advertising," Lomeli
said. "It's not a traditional type of advertising, but people will
see it. We want to attract all kinds of people. These kind of
improvements ... do just that."</TE>

<HD>Science Educators Strike It Rich</HD>
<DH>Awards: Million-dollar grants go to 20 U.S. scholars,
including four in California.</DH>

<LD>Sometimes, Manuel Ares might say from his own unhappy experience,
scientific study can be a little too exciting.</LD>
<LD>   Eight months ago, an overnight fire of unknown origin swept
through Ares' laboratory at UC Santa Cruz, destroying strains of
genetic material and data the biology professor had accumulated and
studied for 14 years.</LD>
<LD>   The loss devastated Ares and his research team, whose work in
genetic function within cells is related to the Human Genome Project,
the national effort to map the genes in human DNA.</LD>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the biology professor, his work largely back on track,
got exciting news of a more positive nature: He is among 20 U.S.
scholars announced as winners of $1-million awards aimed at making
science more engaging for undergraduate students.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been an amazing year," Ares said, chuckling a little, after
the announcement of his award and others by the Howard Hughes Medical
Institute, a nonprofit medical research organization based in
Maryland. "After what we went through, it's very nice to enjoy the
good things like this."</TE>
<TE>   Ares was one of four California scientists to win. Two winners
work at UCLA and one is at Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   The Hughes institute has a long history of supporting science
education at U.S. colleges and universities, awarding nearly $500
million to that end during the last 10 years. But it had never before
given individual awards for undergraduate teaching.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Cech, a Nobel Prize-winning biochemist who heads the
institute, said its aim is to help overcome a staleness that has
crept into science education nationwide, despite the quickening pace
of scientific discovery.</TE>
<TE>   "Science has become very much a big lecture course topic and it's
lost touch with the way scientists really operate--by bouncing around
exciting ideas in small groups and thinking of ways to contest them,"
Cech said. "We want to recapture that excitement."</TE>
<TE>   Announcement of the awards comes just a week after the release of
a report by the National Research Council urging universities to
overhaul their undergraduate biology teaching.</TE>
<TE>   One of the authors of that report applauded the new awards
Tuesday. "The transformation we need will only occur through
grass-roots efforts like this," said Stanford neurobiology professor
Lubert Stryer.</TE>
<TE>   The award winners were nominated by their universities and asked
to submit extensive proposals to the institute. About 150 were
nominated, Cech said.</TE>
<TE>   All of the winners, he said, are gifted professors who exhibit a
talent for teaching and research. "Their lectures tend to be a lot of
fun," Cech said.</TE>
<TE>   The winners at UCLA were Robert Goldberg, a biology professor
whose research focuses on seeds, and colleague Utpal Banerjee, who
uses fruit flies to study the nature of cell communication. Both men
came from the department of molecular, cell and developmental
biology.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just absolutely delighted," said Fred Eiserling, UCLA's
dean of life sciences. "For one institution to get two of these
awards, we hope, will help dispel the idea that a big public
university can't have outstanding teaching."</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg, a 27-year veteran of the UCLA faculty, will focus partly
on non-science majors, bringing them into the lab to learn how to
make seeds from genetic raw material.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll learn how to make these seeds, look at all the genes
involved in how seeds grow and develop," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His aim, he said, is to help these undergraduates understand how
science affects them.</TE>
<TE>   "If people aren't educated about this, how can they make informed
decisions?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   Banerjee, now the department chair, has been at UCLA since 1988.
Both he and Goldberg have won teaching awards at the university, as
well as awards given by UCLA alumni for excellence in teaching,
research and service.</TE>
<TE>   Banerjee's project involves bringing undergraduates into his lab
in relatively large numbers, about 100 each year, to study the eyes
and blood of mutant fruit flies.</TE>
<TE>   "So many bright students never find out what research is all about
until just before they graduate," he said. "The research is so
exciting, it tends to transform them."</TE>
<TE>   Stanford's winner, Timothy Stearns, is an associate professor of
biological sciences, studying how cells divide. Stearns was traveling
in Europe when the awards were announced Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Colleagues described him as a gifted teacher--and musician--who
hopes to target students interested in science and technology who may
have been turned off by the typical pre-med focus in many biology
departments.</TE>
<TE>   At UC Santa Cruz, Ares says he will focus on a project that will
allow undergraduates to use advanced instruments not typically
available to them, including one involved in genetic splicing. He
intends to bring students together in an interdisciplinary research
team.</TE>
<TE>   "It'll be a lot of fun," he said.</TE>

<LD>A suspected narcotics violator led Anaheim police on a chase Tuesday
with his girlfriend's 18-month-old daughter in the car with him,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Christopher Finley, 28, of Fullerton was arrested after crashing
his vehicle near Brookhurst Road and Valencia Drive in Fullerton. He
suffered a minor head injury but the child was unhurt, officials
said. "As soon as the pursuit ended, police got her out of the car,"
said Sgt. Rick Martinez of the Anaheim Police Department.</LD>
<LD>   The chase began about 2:15 p.m. near Brookhurst Street and Orange
Avenue in Anaheim when narcotics investigators tried to pull the man
over. Instead of stopping, he fled at speeds up to 110 mph in his
black four-door Pontiac Grand Am, authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   As soon as they saw the baby in the car, Martinez said, police
backed off. A short time later, Finley's car collided with another
vehicle. The driver of that car, Martinez said, suffered injuries to
her shoulder but was not hospitalized.</TE>

<LD>Smogdance 2002, Pomona's most prominent film festival, is just two
months away, and the deadline for applications is Oct. 1.</LD>
<LD>   The prizes for first place, $25, aren't enough to finance the next
Julia Roberts movie, but at least there is no entry fee.</LD>
<LD>   And popcorn also is free for the auteurs.</LD>
<TE>   Still, the event seems to attract a lot of starving artists,
judging from the subjects of the competition. The Best Film award
last year went to L.A. director Douglas Bennett for a short about
four filmmakers who become stranded in the snow en route to the
Sundance Film Festival and "take a culinary interest in one another."</TE>
<TE>   While we're on the subject: A recipe of Creamy Spam Broccoli
Pastry Shells by Cheryl Ankeney of Anaheim was awarded first place in
the Spam cooking competition at the L.A. County Fair. Ankeney wins a
Spam apron and $150, but no free popcorn.</TE>
<TE>   She is a two-time winner in this competition, incidentally, having
won in 1993 for her entry of, of--it's difficult for me to write the
words--Spam cheesecake.</TE>
<TE>   Could be the subject of a horror movie at Smogdance.</TE>
<TE>   The war on potheads continues: After reading a description of a
power outage notification, Bob Moss of Saugus asked: "What type of
business is Southern California Edison in, anyway?" (see
accompanying)</TE>
<TE>   Now spell it 100 times on the blackboard ... Tony Plaia of
Westlake Village notes that no matter how many times the name of one
school was written on the side of the cup, the last word came out
wrong (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   No time to be Sleepy: Larry Herbst of Pasadena took this shot from
the Disney Studios in Burbank of a nearby brush fire and thought of
the lyric: "Hi ho, hi ho, it's up in flames we go." (see photo)</TE>
<TE>   Identity crises: "The pressure of reading the news well is so
great you can forget who you are," observes newsman Ron Fineman. His
media Web site reports that KABC-TV anchor Phillip Palmer, doing some
substitute work, recently opened a newscast this way: "I'm Gene Glee
....I'm Phillip Palmer, in for Gene Gleeson."</TE>
<TE>   The ronfineman.com Web site previously caught Michele Ruiz
experiencing the same problem at KNBC-TV. Ruiz started to introduce
herself as Colleen Williams while subbing for Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Even the late Chick Hearn, the longtime Lakers broadcaster, was
subject to this sort of slip. He once signed off a game, "For Chick
Hearn, I'm Stu Lantz," paused, then said, "No, I'm not!"</TE>
<TE>   Proof that every L.A. story has a traffic angle: During the
Dodgers' post-game radio show on KXTA-AM (1150) the other night,
caller after caller celebrated a dramatic win over the Giants. All
but one, who phoned to say that the Harbor Freeway was jammed with
cars.</TE>
<TE>   Remembering Aggie: My mention here of Aggie Underwood, the late
L.A. Herald-Examiner editor, brought a note from another Herald
alumna, Gloria Walls Seelye. Underwood, I had written, liked to keep
her staff awake by occasionally firing a starter's pistol in the city
room. But retirement called for an even grander gesture, obviously.
On Underwood's last day, Seelye recalled, "she lit a string of
firecrackers in the executive dining room under the chair of
Publisher George Hearst Jr.</TE>
<TE>   "What a gal!"</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Travel writer Norm Sklarewitz says, "It's bad enough
that filmmakers go off to Canada to make movies supposedly taking
place in L.A." But now he's received a press release announcing that
an Australian vintner and a wine magazine have organized a
"California Wine Experience"--in Las Vegas.</TE>

<HD>Pot Advocates Face Up to 40 Years</HD>
<DH>Courts: Federal charges are filed against Lockwood Valley
couple who admit growing and using marijuana for medicinal purposes.
Trial set for Oct. 22.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lockwood Valley residents Lynn and Judy Osburn, medical marijuana
advocates repeatedly targeted by authorities for growing pot, have
been charged in federal court in a case that could land them in
prison for up to 40 years.</LD>
<LD>   A federal prosecutor said Tuesday he is preparing his case against
the couple following their most recent arrest, in which U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration agents seized 32 marijuana plants at the
Osburns' northern Ventura County ranch.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles-based Assistant U.S. Atty. Patrick Fitzgerald declined
to comment on the case other than to say that growing and possessing
pot is a federal crime despite a medical marijuana initiative
approved by California voters in 1996.</LD>
<TE>   Marijuana activists, who are following the case closely, say they
are concerned about the couple's fate.</TE>
<TE>   "They're up against an awful serious disaster here, and it's going
to be very difficult for them to make an argument," said Scott Imler,
former president of the now-closed Los Angeles Cannabis Resource
Cooperative, for which the Osburns have admitted they supplied
marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   According to a federal grand jury indictment returned Aug. 28, the
couple were charged with growing marijuana, conspiracy and
maintaining a drug house. Lynn Osburn was also charged with being a
felon in possession of a firearm.</TE>
<TE>   Because of strict federal guidelines in narcotics cases, Lynn
Osburn, 52, is being held without bail in a federal jail in Los
Angeles. His wife, 49, was allowed to post a $150,000 bond in late
August.</TE>
<TE>   Their trial is scheduled for Oct. 22. If convicted, the Osburns
each face a minimum mandatory sentence of five years in prison and a
maximum of 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   The case is the culmination of a two-year effort by federal
narcotics agents and the Ventura County Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   The agencies have worked together to seize marijuana plants from
the couple on several occasions without filing charges against them.</TE>
<TE>   Since the passage in 1996 of the state's Proposition 215, which
allows seriously ill people to smoke pot with a doctor's
recommendation, local authorities have been reluctant to prosecute
such cases.</TE>
<TE>   County law enforcement officials in June officially adopted a set
of guidelines that allow a legitimate medicinal user to possess six
plants of any size or 1 pound of dried pot.</TE>
<TE>   In July, the state Supreme Court ruled unanimously that residents
who grow marijuana for personal medical use are protected from state
prosecution if they have their doctor's approval.</TE>
<TE>   Under federal law, however, marijuana possession is illegal. In a
U.S. Supreme Court case last year, justices rejected a medical
necessity argument made by an Oakland marijuana cooperative.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Nishimoto, a spokesman for the Sheriff's Department, declined
to explain how the county's case against the Osburns became a federal
case. Attorneys for the Osburns were not available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The case against the Osburns, who are well-known activists and
authors of "Green Gold: the Tree of Life," a history of pot use in
major religions, was built on evidence gathered in three raids at the
60-acre farm where they have lived for 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   In the largest seizure, county sheriff's deputies confiscated 342
marijuana plants on Aug. 4, 2000. The couple and two colleagues were
arrested but later released. Charges were never filed.</TE>
<TE>   During the raid, authorities also seized two pistols, two
revolvers, a shotgun and a rifle owned by Lynn Osburn. Federal
authorities contend he is not allowed to possess such weapons after
being convicted in 1989 of growing pot and possessing a machine gun.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 10, 2001, federal authorities joined local deputies in the
seizure of 273 pot plants at the ranch as the couple stood by and
watched. No charges were filed, but local authorities announced that
the case would be forwarded to federal officials for review.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the second bust, the Osburns told authorities they
were growing the pot for the Los Angeles cannabis club's 900
medicinal patients. In October 2001, federal agents raided the
cannabis club and seized everything inside, effectively shuttering
the operation for good, Imler said.</TE>
<TE>   The couple allegedly replanted after the 2001 raid and on Aug. 13,
federal and local authorities returned and seized what the Osburns'
supporters contend was the couple's personal supply of 35 plants.</TE>
<TE>   Lynn Osburn uses marijuana to ease severe back pain from a
swimming accident several years ago, and his wife smokes to relieve
constant muscle spasms in her lower back. Both claim to be legitimate
patients.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm surprised they replanted. It was a risk," said Imler, who
emphasized his strong support for the couple. "At a certain point,
you've got to take 'no' for an answer and live to fight another
battle and see another day."</TE>

<HD>Education, Insurance, Controller Candidates Face Off in
Debates</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A slew of candidates running for three of California's statewide
races faced off Tuesday in a series of debates that marked their
first showdowns of the general election and that displayed their
varied views of how best to manage the offices they seek.</LD>
<LD>   In one debate after another, the candidates traded opinions about
one another's records and the approaches they would bring to the
offices of state controller, insurance commissioner and
superintendent of education.</LD>
<LD>   During the insurance commissioner forum, hosted and taped by Santa
Monica-based Adelphia Communications for rebroadcast several times
this week on cable stations statewide, Republican Gary Mendoza
repeatedly accused Democrat John Garamendi of failing during his
original tenure as commissioner in the early 1990s.</LD>
<TE>   "You did more damage to consumer interests than Chuck
Quackenbush," Mendoza told Garamendi, referring to the former
insurance commissioner who resigned after a corruption scandal two
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Garamendi defended his record and attempted to deflect his
challenger. "Gary," he said at one point, "be polite."</TE>
<TE>   The heated back-and-forth between those two candidates began even
before the debate when Mendoza, a former commissioner of corporations
and onetime Los Angeles deputy mayor, held a news conference outside
the cable station. There, he accused Garamendi of harming thousands
of Executive Life policyholders when the insurance commissioner took
over the troubled insurance company in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a number of reasons why Garamendi is unfit to be
insurance commissioner, but none more poignant than his handling of
Executive Life and what it did to tens of thousands of families,"
Mendoza said.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP nominee was joined by Arizona residents Sue and Vince
Watson, whose disabled 22-year-old daughter lost $1 million in
annuity payments after Garamendi sold the bankrupt insurance company
to a group of French investors.</TE>
<TE>   Garamendi said his office originally structured a proposal that
would have returned the entire investment of every policyholder, but
the plan was rejected by the courts.</TE>
<TE>   "At that point, we had no option but to reduce payouts for the
larger policyholders, of which the Watsons were among," he said.
"This is a sad situation. It's a situation that was driven by a court
decision, not by my decision."</TE>
<TE>   During the debate, Garamendi said that he built "the best consumer
protection agency in America" when he headed the Department of
Insurance from 1991 to 1995.</TE>
<TE>   As the two men squabbled and interrupted each other, Green Party
candidate David Sheidlower and Libertarian candidate Dale Ogden tried
to lay out their platforms.</TE>
<TE>   Sheidlower said he would aggressively defend consumer interests,
push to end the use of ZIP Codes to determine auto insurance rates
and work to create universal health care. Ogden said he would
drastically pare down the Department of Insurance, roll back
regulation of insurance rates and try to end mandatory auto
insurance.</TE>
<TE>   The debate between the two candidates running for education
superintendent was more amiable. Democratic state Sen. Jack O'Connell
and Republican Katherine Smith voiced their opposition to school
vouchers and support for two bond measures that would provide more
money for school facilities and after-school programs.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, a member of the Anaheim Union School District board, said
she would push for a return to basic instruction such as phonics,
rote math and spelling: "We have to go back to teaching the basics."</TE>
<TE>   O'Connell focused on his experience as a teacher and in the state
Legislature, where he served on several education committees and
wrote class-size reduction bills.</TE>
<TE>   "I can use my experience," he said. "I can hit the ground
running."</TE>
<TE>   During the debate among three of the candidates running for
controller, Republican state Sen. Tom McClintock said he would
establish a waste commission to cut unnecessary spending, and accused
his Democratic opponent, Steve Westly, of being beholden to large
corporations.</TE>
<TE>   Westly, a former EBay executive, countered that his experience in
business and as a manager makes him the best qualified for the post.</TE>
<TE>   He said he would rein in state spending through aggressive audits,
and he touted his support from a broad spectrum of groups, including
environmental and women's organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Green Party candidate Laura Wells said she believes her party's
policy of not accepting corporate contributions will resonate with
voters who have been turned off by the influence of special-interest
groups.</TE>
<TE>   Added Wells: "I have a favorite Green Party bumper sticker that
says, 'Democracy: Great idea. When do we start?' "</TE>

<LD>Back in a time, I guess, when such things didn't matter, my Omaha
high school was nicknamed the Bunnies. If being linked to a cuddly,
furry creature bothered any of our athletes, I don't recall them
saying so. Not that such a nickname didn't have implications.</LD>
<LD>   One cold winter's night, during a basketball game against our
longtime rival North High School (the Vikings), a dead rabbit came
flying from the stands and landed at midcourt. That prompted a short
interruption of the game, along with an announcement that, please, no
more dead bunnies on the floor.</LD>
<LD>   Since we were unwilling to respond in kind by slaying a Viking and
hurling his corpse onto the court the next time we played North, we
let the incident go unanswered.</LD>
<TE>   Lesson learned: Bunnies are more cultured than Vikings.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't count for much these days, and I note with some
sadness that the Laguna Beach High School Artists are now the Laguna
Beach Breakers. Driven, apparently, by football players who found it
hard to be an Artist and still want to knock someone's head off, the
student body has voted to change the nickname.</TE>
<TE>   There's nothing wrong with Breakers. It's not like the kids wanted
to be the Stompin' Marauders. The school's teams were first
identified, for 19 months in the 1930s, as the Breakers. Then, in a
nod to the artist colony that defined the city, students voted to
rename themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Athletic director Mario Morales says he's fine with the idea,
because schools exist for the students and the name change proceeded
through proper channels. He doesn't want people thinking the idea
came from athletes. But Frank Aronoff, the school's "unofficial
statistician," says it did.</TE>
<TE>   "The big thing behind it were the football players," says Aronoff,
a parent and booster who's compiled team records dating to 1934. It's
a small school that plays much larger schools, and the players felt
the Artists nickname "was one more thing they have to overcome,"
Aronoff says.</TE>
<TE>   While football and basketball teams have fared poorly in recent
years, the school's more successful sports teams--like volleyball and
water polo--didn't feel diminished by the nickname, Aronoff says.</TE>
<TE>   The issue has percolated for years. A friend of mine who lives
there wonders why the school's athletic teams didn't settle things by
calling themselves the "Fighting Artists."</TE>
<TE>   Morales says 72% of the school's 800 students voted, with 65%
going for Breakers. The Artists drew a measly 5%, with votes split
among other entries.</TE>
<TE>   So, the students have spoken.</TE>
<TE>   However, alumni are yelping through phone calls and letters,
Morales says. In just his second year at the school, Morales doesn't
have a strong feeling about the debate and says, "If the students
feel changing the mascot will help, by all means I'll support it, but
I don't think it's going to change their performance on the field or
on the court."</TE>
<TE>   The football team has had five winning seasons since 1980 and only
one in the last 14 years, according to Aronoff's statistics. The
basketball team has had nine winning seasons since 1980 but has gone
17-56 the last three seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "They probably feel it's been kind of a namby-pamby name," Aronoff
says. Still, many alumni, no doubt, have fond memories of the school
mascot from a generation ago--a student in a smock and beret and
carrying a paintbrush.</TE>
<TE>   True, that isn't likely today to inspire fear in an opponent or
rally the home team, but somewhere down the road, I suspect students
will regret their decision to end the school's long tradition of
having an iconoclastic nickname.</TE>
<TE>   "I can see it both ways," Aronoff says. "I don't know how menacing
a wave is, but it's still better than being an artist. I think that's
probably where the guys in football are coming from."</TE>

<HD>Two Small Planes Collide Near Carlsbad; Three Die</HD>

<LD>Two small planes collided over rugged backcountry near
McLellan-Palomar Airport in Carlsbad on Tuesday afternoon, killing
the pilot in one plane and an instructor and a student pilot in the
other.</LD>
<LD>   The identities of the victims were withheld pending notification
of relatives.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said the pilots were men and the student was a woman.</LD>
<TE>   The planes, a single-engine Mooney M20E and a twin-engine
Beechcraft Duchess, were in the airport's arrival-and-departure
pattern when the collision occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Although pilots in the pattern are required to be in radio contact
with the airport, it is their responsibility to "see and avoid" other
aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   The registered owner of the Mooney is a pilot with a residence in
Auburn, Calif. The registered owner of the Beechcraft is Pinnacle
Aviation Academy, a flight school at the airport.</TE>
<TE>   George McJimsey, president of the flight school, said the student
pilot and her instructor had taken off from the airport, heading
west, about 1 p.m. McJimsey said the Beechcraft made a U-turn to the
right and was heading east in the pattern, parallel to the runway,
when it collided with the Mooney, which apparently was entering the
pattern in preparation for landing.</TE>
<TE>   The planes were about 1,200 feet above ground when they collided
over an unpopulated area. One plane fell into a ravine near a real
estate development site being graded about a mile northeast of the
airport. The other came down on a hillside several hundred yards from
the ravine. Although both planes were crushed by the impact, neither
caught fire.</TE>
<TE>   The Carlsbad Police Department said the bodies were found in the
wreckage.</TE>

<HD>Diving Coach Is Arrested in Child Porn Case</HD>
<DH>Crime: Authorities say they found suggestive photos and

and Agoura high schools.</DH>

<LD>A Thousand Oaks diving coach, who worked at Newbury Park and Agoura
high schools last spring, has been arrested on suspicion of
possessing images of minors in sexual situations and of intent to
distribute child pornography.</LD>
<LD>   William Glinton Douglas III, 45, was arrested Monday at his
Thousand Oaks home, four months after his home computer was seized in
a search for evidence.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators said they found more than 2,000 suggestive photo and
video images in the computer, many of them showing naked boys and
girls engaged in sexual activity. Deputy Dist. Atty. Howard Wise said
inappropriate images of children were also found in Douglas' home and
van.</LD>
<TE>   Officials said they have uncovered no evidence suggesting Douglas
molested any students or swimmers involved with Dive Thousand Oaks, a
private diving club he operates.</TE>
<TE>   At a court appearance Tuesday, Superior Court Judge Kevin J. McGee
set Douglas' bail at $150,000 and barred him from unsupervised
contact with anyone under 18, and from accessing the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas has been charged with one felony count of possessing
obscene photos of children with intent to distribute them and two
misdemeanor counts of possessing child pornography. Douglas agreed to
postpone his arraignment until Sept. 24.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas was identified earlier this year as a member of a Yahoo
chat group that catered to those interested in child pornography,
authorities said. Operation Candyman, a federal crackdown on online
obscenity, resulted in scores of arrests in 20 states in March.
Subsequent investigation led authorities to Douglas.</TE>
<TE>   One parent involved with Dive Thousand Oaks said Douglas' arrest
came as a shock to those who know him.</TE>
<TE>   "It was absolutely, totally out of the blue. There has never been
any complaint or allusion to a complaint," said Peggy Rosenberg of
Thousand Oaks, a member of Dive Thousand Oaks' governing board.</TE>

video images in the computer, many of them showing naked boys and
girls engaged in sexual activity. Deputy Dist. Atty. Howard Wise said
inappropriate images of children were also found in Douglas' home and
van.</LD>
<TE>   Officials said they have uncovered no evidence suggesting Douglas
molested any students or swimmers involved with Dive Thousand Oaks, a
private diving club he operates.</TE>
<TE>   At a court appearance Tuesday, Superior Court Judge Kevin J. McGee
set Douglas' bail at $150,000 and barred him from unsupervised
contact with anyone under 18, and from accessing the Internet.
Douglas later posted bail.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas has been charged with one felony count of possessing
obscene photos of children with intent to distribute them and two
misdemeanor counts of possessing child pornography. Douglas agreed to
postpone his arraignment until Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Howard Wise said inappropriate images of
children were also found in Douglas' home and van.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas was identified earlier this year as a member of a Yahoo
chat group that catered to those interested in child pornography,
authorities said. Operation Candyman, a federal crackdown on online
obscenity, resulted in scores of arrests in 20 states in March.
Subsequent investigation led authorities to Douglas.</TE>
<TE>   FBI Special Agent Leane Blevins said Douglas is the first Ventura
County resident arrested as part of Operation Candyman. Her office
worked with the Southern California High Tech Task Force, which
includes representatives from the Ventura County district attorney,
the Sheriff's Department, the U.S. Secret Service and the state
Department of Motor Vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   After checking with the schools where Douglas worked and with
parents of some divers, Blevins said there was no evidence "that he
has met with a child, traveled to meet with a minor or has molested a
child." Blevins asked anyone with information related to the
investigation to contact her at the Ventura FBI office at 677-7357.</TE>
<TE>   One parent involved with Dive Thousand Oaks said Douglas' arrest
came as a shock to those who know him.</TE>
<TE>   "It was absolutely, totally out of the blue. There has never been
any complaint or allusion to a complaint," said Peggy Rosenberg of
Thousand Oaks, a member of Dive Thousand Oaks' governing board.</TE>
<TE>   A Las Virgenes School District official confirmed that Douglas
worked at Agoura High School for the first time earlier this year as
a walk-on diving coach.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas has worked as a part-time employee of the Conejo Unified
School District since 1988, most recently as a diving coach at
Newbury Park High School during the spring semester, said Jody
Dunlap, the district's assistant superintendent for personnel
services. In spring 1999, Douglas worked at both Thousand Oaks and
Westlake high schools, Dunlap said..</TE>

<HD>Shooting Trial Begins</HD>
<DH>Court: Prosecutors say driver shot passenger in another
vehicle after a heated exchange. An accident, defense says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a heated exchange with another driver, a Los Angeles woman
followed the other vehicle in her van, shot a passenger in the head,
then tried to flee the Panorama City crime scene, a prosecutor said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Oreyda Paramo, a 39-year-old self-employed mother of two, is on
trial in Van Nuys charged with attempted murder, two counts of
assault with a semiautomatic firearm and shooting into an occupied
vehicle. The first-time offender could face life in prison.</LD>
<LD>   Her attorney, Ronald White, said the shooting was accidental.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors disagree. Deputy Dist. Atty. Paul Bronstein told
jurors in his opening statement that on Jan. 19 Paramo was blocking
an eastbound lane of Parthenia Street with her van, when Emma
Rodriguez of Pacoima tried to pass in her car.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez stopped and yelled at Paramo to move her car, Bronstein
said. Paramo, whose 11-year-old son was in the back seat, responded,
"Or what?"</TE>
<TE>   Paramo allegedly pointed a 9-millimeter handgun at Rodriguez's car
and Rodriguez sped away, the prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   According to Bronstein, Paramo followed Rodriguez and fired a
single shot into the right passenger windshield, hitting Rodriguez's
brother, Edwin Saltorrez, 37, of New York, in the head. The bullet
pierced Saltorrez's skin and landed in the lap of Rodriguez's
10-year-old son, Joseph Slack, who was not injured, Bronstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Saltorrez had been shot, he did not realize it
immediately and his sister followed Paramo's vehicle until she got
the attention of police, Bronstein said.</TE>
<TE>   A Los Angeles police officer saw the pursuit and followed until he
could stop both vehicles to investigate. The officer noticed the
bullet hole in Rodriguez's windshield, saw that Saltorrez had been
shot and found a shell casing on the floorboard of Paramo's vehicle,
Bronstein said. Saltorrez was transported by paramedics to a
hospital, where he was treated for a minor head wound.</TE>
<TE>   Paramo, who was arrested at the scene, has been held at the Twin
Towers Correctional Facility in downtown Los Angeles in lieu of
$500,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   But White said in his opening statement that Rodriguez and her
passengers waited for Paramo a block away and threatened her with
violence. He said a defense witness would testify that he saw
Saltorrez with a gun, then heard the shot fired.</TE>
<TE>   He said Paramo's fiance, a Los Angeles firefighter, had planned to
go to a firing range that day but didn't. He left his handgun, which
he told Paramo was not loaded, on the floorboard of the van, which
Paramo drove later that day.</TE>
<TE>   After Paramo's confrontation with Rodriguez, "she grabbed the
firearm, figuring, 'I'm going to scare those people,' " White said.</TE>
<TE>   She allegedly saw Saltorrez with a gun and when Rodriguez drove
toward her, Paramo picked up the weapon, the defense lawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Trial is set to continue today.</TE>

<LD>Police arrested a suspected narcotics violator Tuesday after he led
them on a high-speed chase through city streets, ending in a crash
with his girlfriend's 18-month-old daughter in tow.</LD>
<LD>   Christopher Finley, 28, of Fullerton suffered a minor head injury
in the accident near Brookhurst Street and Valencia Avenue in
Fullerton, but the girl wasn't hurt. "As soon as the pursuit ended,
police got her out of the car," said Anaheim Police Sgt. Rick
Martinez.</LD>
<LD>   The chase began about 2:15 p.m., when narcotics investigators
tried to pull the man over, but he fled at speeds up to 110 mph.</LD>
<TE>   When they saw the girl in the car, Martinez said, police pulled
back from the chase. But it ended in a crash anyway when Finley
collided with another car. The driver of that car suffered minor
injuries.</TE>

<LD>The county government is bracing for an additional $10-million budget
cut, a loss that could result in the closure of health clinics and
the slashing of social service programs for the area's neediest
residents, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Preliminary estimates released Tuesday by County Executive Officer
Johnny Johnston's office show the county could lose up to $10 million
because of reduced funding in the state's recently passed budget.</LD>
<LD>   Although precise figures won't be known for two weeks, county
managers already are preparing to cut services for mentally ill
adults, recipients of food stamps and oversight of children in
protective custody because of suspected abuse or neglect.</LD>

<LD>Reports of farm workers poisoned by pesticides are declining, but
labor advocates say tougher state laws and more enforcement are
needed to protect the people picking and packing crops.</LD>
<LD>   An average of 475 farm workers were reported poisoned each year
from 1997 to 2000, according to state figures cited in a report by
Californians for Pesticide Reform.</LD>
<LD>   That is down from an average of 665 a year from 1991 to 1996, the
report says.</LD>
<TE>   Glenn Brank of the state Department of Pesticide Regulation agreed

<HD>L.A. Test Scores Rise for 1st Grade</HD>
<DH>Education: Stanford 9 improvement is downplayed by some,
but Supt. Romer calls it a vindication of the district's efforts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Standardized test scores for first-graders in the Los Angeles Unified
School District rose this year, according to figures released
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The California Department of Education does not require
first-graders to take the Stanford 9 exam because studies have shown
that test results for children under age 8 are unreliable.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles school district Supt. Roy Romer, however, touted the
rising Stanford 9 test scores as vindication of parents' efforts,
better teacher training programs and the district's highly scripted
Open Court reading program.</LD>
<TE>   Sixty-one percent of first-graders in L.A. Unified scored at or
above the national average in reading, up 4 percentage points from
last year. In math, 52% were at or above the national average, up 5
percentage points; in language the figure was 49%, up 3 points; and
in spelling the figure was 59%, up 4 points.</TE>
<TE>   The Stanford 9 scores for higher grades were released in Los
Angeles and statewide over the last month.</TE>
<TE>   District officials said the test results for first grade were
released separately because they were only recently available.</TE>
<TE>   Few other California school districts report first-graders' scores
on the Stanford 9 because many of those children lack the skills to
take such exams, said Paul Warren, the state Education Department's
deputy superintendent for accountability.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Stecher, an education researcher at the Rand Corp. think
tank in Santa Monica, said many children at that age don't even know
how to manipulate a pencil.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the shortcomings of testing first-graders, Ronni Ephraim,
the district's assistant superintendent for instruction, said the
results will help educators determine where to focus resources and
attention.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that the most critical years for reading are kindergarten
and first grade," she said. "So it is important that, early on, we
see a picture of schools' strengths and weaknesses."</TE>
<TE>   For example, she said 28 of the district's 445 elementary schools
scored well below the national average and would be targeted for
increased scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   Board of Education member David Tokofsky said the tests offer an
opportunity to push for more preschool and kindergarten programs, but
he downplayed the significance of the scores.</TE>
<TE>   He likened the early testing to the Stanley Kaplan preparation
courses for college entrance exams. "These scores don't give us any
tremendous data," he said. "But it's good practice."</TE>

<HD>NAACP Valley Chapter Leader Backs Secession</HD>
<DH>Cityhood: His announcement comes on the same day the
state's oldest black Democratic club comes out against breakup.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Breaking from African American leaders outside the San Fernando
Valley, the president of the NAACP's Valley chapter said Tuesday he
supports secession because it would improve the lives of all Los
Angeles residents.</LD>
<LD>   The Rev. Zedar E. Broadous made the announcement on the same day
the oldest black Democratic club in the state came out against the
proposed breakup of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Broadous, who also is chairman of the Black Chamber of Commerce of
the San Fernando Valley, said some African American leaders opposed
to secession are resistant to political change and may not understand
the needs of Valley minorities.</LD>
<TE>   One problem secession might solve, Broadus said, involves rules
requiring areas served by federal programs to be contiguous. Those
rules, he said, shortchange blighted parts of the northeast Valley,
an area miles from pockets of poverty elsewhere in the city.</TE>
<TE>   "The northeast Valley has not gotten the kind of attention other
parts of Los Angeles have," said Broadous, a Pacoima minister and
graphics consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Broadous said if voters approve secession, residents of the
remainder of Los Angeles would gain the same smaller-city benefits
that Valley residents would enjoy.</TE>
<TE>   "We in the Valley will have better access to our government, more
representative government and control over our own resources,"
Broadous said.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley chapter of the NAACP has more than 1,000 members. While
his position on secession is not the official stance of the chapter,
Broadous said he is urging the organization to back secession. He
said he also has asked the chamber to endorse a breakup.</TE>
<TE>   Secession leaders said Broadous' support is especially valuable
because his family has played a prominent role in Valley history.
Broadous Elementary School is named for his father, who founded the
Valley chapter of the NAACP.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a very well-respected leader in the Valley," said Richard
Katz, co-chairman of the Valley Independence Committee. "He would be
a very important part of our coalition."</TE>
<TE>   Kam Kuwata, who is running Mayor James K. Hahn's anti-secession
campaign, said Broadous will have little effect because, he said, his
position is out of step with most black leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "With anything, you are going to get individuals here and there
who disagree, but the vast majority are certainly coming out against
secession," Kuwata said.</TE>
<TE>   The NAACP's Los Angeles chapter and several other African American
groups outside the Valley are opposed to the Valley and Hollywood
secession measures on the Nov. 5 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Broadous joined the secession group Valley VOTE in 2000 as a
neutral observer.</TE>
<TE>   He said Tuesday he decided to support a breakup, in part, because
of the candidacy of Mel Wilson, an African American who is a leading
candidate for Valley mayor on the secession ballot, and a study by
the Rose Institute of State and Local Government that found Los
Angeles lags other cities in receiving state and federal funds.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose report, financed by secessionists and released Tuesday,
also found the Valley receives less money for redevelopment and
policing than do other areas of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Although African Americans represent just 5.6% of registered
voters in the Valley, Broadous said he believes a Valley city would
elect blacks, including Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   Bobbie Jean Anderson, president of the New Frontier Democratic
Club, the oldest African American club in the state, said Broadous is
wrong about secession. The group has 320 members in South Los
Angeles, Inglewood and Compton.</TE>
<TE>   "Los Angeles is going to be losing 30% of its tax base, and
services are going to have to come from somewhere, so we will have to
make up the difference," Anderson said.</TE>

<HD>Trial Begins on Simon S&amp;L Suit</HD>
<DH>Court: The family of the gubernatorial candidate says
change in federal rules led to firm's failure. U.S. blames the
thrift.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN PETERSON and ROBERT PATRICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A U.S. attorney Tuesday cited "poor management and board oversight"
for the 1993 collapse of Western Federal Savings and Loan, a
California thrift that was controlled by the family of Bill Simon
Jr., the Republican gubernatorial candidate, along with other
investors.</LD>
<LD>   But lawyers representing the thrift's parent company blamed a
misguided shift in government regulation for sinking Western Federal
in 1993 rather than strengthening the beleaguered savings and loan.</LD>
<LD>   "The evidence will show the government ... got it backwards," said
Rowan D. Wilson, an attorney for WestFed Holdings, parent firm of
Western Federal, which was based in Marina del Rey.</LD>
<TE>   The conflicting views unfolded on the first day of a trial in
which the Simon family and other investors seek to recover damages
arising from the thrift's demise. The shutdown of Western Federal
cost taxpayers $122 million.</TE>
<TE>   The demise of Western Federal has taken on broader interest,
because Gov. Gray Davis has sought to turn Simon's business track
record into a campaign issue, arguing that Western Federal's woes
cast doubt on Simon's ability to run the vast state of California.</TE>
<TE>   Simon was one of a handful of board members for the thrift and
later the holding company. In those capacities, he shared
responsibility for overseeing the top managers who handled day-to-day
operations.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, lawyers for the WestFed investors contended that a
1989 change in how thrifts must count their assets was a fatal blow
to Western Federal, and that the shutdown was unrelated to the
competence of management. Simon's name did not come up in opening
arguments.</TE>
<TE>   In a political ad unveiled last week, Davis zeroed in on Western
Federal, noting that Simon has repeatedly sought to distance himself
from the imbroglio. "If he can't take responsibility for his
business, how can he run California?" the ad asked.</TE>
<TE>   But Simon campaign officials emphasized Tuesday that the current
trial is over how much compensation the Simon family and other
investors may deserve. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims ruled in
March that the government's change in accounting rules amounted to a
breach of contract.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a suit by Simon and many other investors to recover
damages from the government for failing to keep its word," said Mark
Miner, Simon's press secretary.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the Davis ad, Miner said: "The only way Gray Davis can
win this election is to resort to negative, false and misleading
attack ads not backed up by the truth."</TE>
<TE>   The Western Federal case is the second noteworthy legal matter
involving Simon in recent days. Just last week, a Los Angeles
Superior Court judge ruled that the Simon family did not defraud a
business partner to take control of a pay phone company--overturning
a $78-million jury verdict against the family.</TE>
<TE>   In the savings and loan case, a group of investors led by Simon's
father, William E. Simon Sr., the late Treasury secretary, and
including such financial luminaries as Preston Martin, former vice
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, took control of
Western Federal in the late 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   The Simon family claimed damages of $40 million; the figure
claimed by the entire investor group is more than $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   Government attorneys, trying to limit the size of damages, sought
Tuesday to hold Western Federal's management accountable for much of
the institution's financial woes.</TE>
<TE>   Jane M.E. Peterson, a U.S. attorney, cited "poor management and
board oversight, all of which plagued the thrift for a number of
years."</TE>
<TE>   The government has sought Simon's testimony, but Judge Emily C.
Hewitt ruled in August that he would not have to testify until three
days after the Nov. 5 election. The case is scheduled to run for
several weeks.</TE>

<HD>Killer of Prosecutor Is Sought</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BAKERSFIELD</DL>
<LD>Detectives trying to solve the stabbing death of Kern County's No. 2
prosecutor said Tuesday that they are not close to an arrest, but
insisted that they are aggressively following a number of leads.</LD>
<LD>   Among them, Kern County Sheriff's Cmdr. Martin Williamson said,
are reports that Stephen M. Tauzer may have had a house guest
recently. Indicating that they have not ruled out the possibility
that he was killed for something he did in the courtroom, Williamson
said investigators also are looking at certain cases Tauzer handled
in which one or the other party left court in a rage.</LD>
<LD>   But Williamson said detectives are not focusing on any specific
theory yet, or even narrowing down their inquiry to Tauzer's personal
or professional life. Tauzer, a workaholic perfectionist who handled
some of this area's biggest criminal cases, was stabbed at least once
in the head last weekend in the garage of his northwest Bakersfield
home. The Kern County coroner's office has not released the autopsy
findings on specific injuries, saying only that there was other head
trauma besides the stab wound. Williamson said detectives want that
information held back as an investigative tool.</LD>
<TE>   While the high-profile killing has shocked this neighborly oil and
agricultural town and thrown a pall over the district attorney's
office, authorities were at pains to make it clear this may be a
difficult case to solve. "We're still in the fact-finding process,"
Williamson said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about reports by neighbors that Tauzer, who lived in a
tree-shaded house with redwood siding, had a roommate, Williamson
said, "We are hearing that, but we're not corroborating it. We've
been told that in the recent past he's been living by himself."</TE>
<TE>   Tauzer, 57, was unmarried and had worked for the prosecutor's
office for three decades. Among his controversial cases was the
investigation into corruption in the cities of Taft and Arvin. The
grand jury, under Tauzer's direction, handed down indictments against
the Arvin police chief, a city councilman and a top city contractor.
Tauzer got convictions in two cases, but the trial of Councilman
Julio Perez ended in a hung jury.</TE>
<TE>   In an unrelated development, Arvin Councilman Robert Brennan, who
had cooperated with Tauzer in the investigation, announced that he
will resign and move out of the city. Brennan said Tauzer's slaying
will cripple the continuing investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The retrial of Perez is scheduled for next month, but Dist. Atty.
Ed Jagels said Tauzer was not going to handle it. His health was not
up to it, Jagels said. Tauzer narrowly survived a massive heart
attack two years ago.</TE>

<HD>Cal State OKs Tighter Smoking Rules</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California smokers have long complained that overzealous health nuts
are choking off every chance they have to inhale. But a new
regulation passed Tuesday by the California State University system
has cigarette puffers really put out.</LD>
<LD>   State law requires smokers to stand 5 feet away from the entrances
of public buildings before lighting up, but Cal State's regulation
would allow campuses to bump up that distance by 20 feet or more.</LD>
<LD>   The regulation, passed unanimously by Cal State's Board of
Trustees, encourages the system's 23 campuses to tighten outside
smoking bans. The final decision is up to each school president,
after input from students.</LD>
<TE>   "It is insane," said Megan Brophy, 22, who attends Cal State
Northridge. "There's no smoking in buildings. We can't smoke in
class. But now they don't want us to smoke outside in a public
place."</TE>
<TE>   Joey Abbene, 18, agreed. "There's a lot of stress in college,"
said Abbene, who frequently turns to cigarettes to unwind. "I don't
understand people who complain about that."</TE>
<TE>   Many people have indeed complained. A coalition of public smoking
opponents from eight Cal State campuses came together under the
acronym COUGH--Campuses Organized and United for Good Health--to push
for tightened smoking regulations at every Cal State campus.</TE>
<TE>   Cal State trustee Fred Pierce said the board's actions set a
strong example for other universities, and he encouraged trustees to
go further in their efforts by supporting a universitywide rule
requiring smokers to move at least 20 feet from buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Two Cal State campuses already have smoking regulations that are
stronger than state law requires, according to a university
spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Northridge requires all smokers to remain 30 feet from
entrances to campus buildings, and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo requires
smokers to stand 15 feet from residence halls.</TE>
<TE>   In California, restrictions on smoking have steadily increased. In
1995, the Legislature passed a ban on smoking in most indoor
workplaces, which was expanded to include bars, casinos and
restaurants a year later. Last year, a law was passed banning smoking
on playgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   Excessive public condemnation has made a mockery of smokers,
Brophy said. "We're the rebels. The outcasts of society," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Brophy said she once was smoking inside her car with the windows
rolled down, stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic, when a person in the
car next to her yelled for her to put out the cigarette or roll up
the windows.</TE>
<TE>   "People need to chill," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Quezada, 20, a Marlboro Red-smoking student at Cal State
Los Angeles, recalled puffing away on the outdoor patio of a bar when
a group nearby muttered "smoke kills."</TE>
<TE>   The invasion of gruesome anti-smoking commercials has made life as
a smoker even more unpleasant, Brophy said.</TE>
<TE>   She said she feels queasy while watching some television ads, and
resents that women are portrayed as unattractive if they have a
cigarette hanging from their mouths.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the die-hards vow not to be deterred by more regulations.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like you have to sit by me," Quezada said. "Go sit
somewhere else."</TE>

<HD>Manslaughter Plea Mystifies Family</HD>
<DH>Courts: Woman is unhappy over a deal that could result in a
year in jail for a truck driver who killed her son in an Anaheim
Hills crash.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The evidence seemed stacked against him: The trucker was under the
influence of methamphetamine and driving an overloaded big rig with
bad brakes when he barreled through a red light, killing an Anaheim
Hills optometrist.</LD>
<LD>   But this week, in a deal that has left the victim's family
surprised and disappointed, Anthony Saiz of Lakewood pleaded guilty
to vehicular manslaughter while under the influence of drugs. He
faces a one-year sentence in county jail. The charge might still be
declared a misdemeanor.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think it's justice. I don't see how it could be," said
Laverne Larkin of Rossmoor, the mother of victim Kenneth Michael
Larkin, 53, who died instantly in the March 2001 crash in Anaheim
Hills.</LD>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Jennifer Contini declined to discuss details of
the case until the sentencing Nov. 21. She said there are still
issues to be determined during sentencing, including the length and
terms of probation. Saiz also has agreed to forfeit his commercial
license, she said.</TE>
<TE>   While there is no dispute that Saiz was under the influence of
drugs, it is unclear whether it played a role in the accident.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the penal code does not define the level at which
drug use impairs driving, as it does for alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   Saiz saw the red light and tried to stop, but the brakes failed.
He waved his arms to alert motorists and also hit the air horn to
warn motorists to avoid the truck's path.</TE>
<TE>   His attorney did not return phone calls Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Saiz careened through a red light at the bottom of a steep hill
March 8, setting off a 12-vehicle collision that killed Larkin and
injured six others. The accident, near two schools, sparked rallies
and outrage from neighbors who had long complained about speeding
trucks.</TE>
<TE>   Police immediately cracked down and cited truckers, but the
222-page report into the investigation found problems that had
nothing to do with speed.</TE>
<TE>   Seven of the eight brakes on Saiz's truck, owned by Peterson
Brothers Construction, were found to be faulty. The truck's load
weighed more than 2,000 pounds more than the acceptable limit.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Saiz tested positive for both methamphetamine and
morphine. Police did not seek charges against the construction
company, but a civil lawsuit is pending against Saiz and the company.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Wylie Aitken, who filed the lawsuit on behalf of Larkin's
wife, said the family is "mystified" by the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Aitken said he knows it is difficult to prosecute a driver under
the influence of drugs because the penal code does not define
measurable limits of drug use. That was likely to be a major issue
presented by Saiz's attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Despite that, Aitken said he believes there was plenty of blame to
go around, including against Saiz's employer, Peterson Brothers
Construction.</TE>
<TE>   After the accident, the company received an unsatisfactory rating
from California Highway Patrol inspectors, and later said it was
overhauling its truck safety and inspection programs.</TE>

<HD>Probe Debunks Need for Blackouts</HD>
<DH>Energy: A year in the making, PUC report says five plant
owners had the capacity to produce enough power. Industry calls the
findings wrong.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Southern California could have avoided all hours of blackouts in
2001, and Northern California most of them, if the state's five big,
private power plant owners had produced as much electricity as they
were capable of generating through the worst of the state's
electricity crisis, according to a state report released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The report, by Public Utilities Commission investigators, does not
challenge the claims of energy companies that power plants were shut
down because of mechanical troubles or air pollution rules. But even
assuming that every reported shutdown was legitimate, the report
concluded, the five companies withheld between 37% and 46% of their
available capacity to generate electricity from November 2000 to May
2001.</LD>
<LD>   "Sufficient generating capacity for California's families and
businesses existed," concludes the report, which was a year in the
making and has not been reviewed by the full commission. "But
blackouts and service interruptions occurred because generators Duke,
Dynegy, Mirant, Reliant and AES/Williams did not produce needed power
even though their plants could have met California's electricity
needs."</LD>
<TE>   Energy company officials refuted the report, saying there are many
valid reasons they would not have offered to sell electricity to the
California Independent System Operator, which must buy last-minute
power supplies to avoid blackouts.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Mullen, spokesman for Duke Energy, operator of three major
power plants, called the report blatantly misleading.</TE>
<TE>   For example, he said, the report says that Duke's unused power
alone could have prevented blackouts on May 8, 2001. But the Duke
plants that the PUC describes as idle were on that day under the
control of state grid operators, who could alter their output as
needed to keep the transmission system stable, Mullen said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is alleged that somehow we weren't doing all we could," said
Mullen. "In fact, all our units were maxed out ... or they were under
the control of Cal-ISO."</TE>
<TE>   The generators also dismissed the report as an attempt by
California regulators to derail federal efforts to set standard rules
for electricity markets across the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "This report emerges out of the ether after a year and a half,"
said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of Independent Energy
Producers, an association of power plant owners. "Clearly, the target
here is to affect standard market design in Washington, which is an
actual attempt to fix the problem."</TE>
<TE>   Released with little notice Tuesday by PUC President Loretta Lynch
at a legislative hearing, the report does not resolve an enduring
electricity crisis mystery: Did power plant owners deliberately
curtail production in order to create scarcity and drive up prices?
Or, as the generators claim, were aging power plants plagued by a
rash of breakdowns from having run so hard to keep electricity
flowing through the summer of 2000?</TE>
<TE>   The power market California created in an attempt at deregulation
began to unravel in May 2000. Wholesale prices spiked up. Starting in
November, so did the number of power plants shut down for what owners
said was maintenance or repairs. In February 2001, for example, twice
as many megawatts of capacity were idle in California as in February
1999.</TE>
<TE>   That plummet in power production threw Cal-ISO grid operators into
turmoil as they struggled each day to match supply and demand on the
transmission system reaching customers of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric,
Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric.</TE>
<TE>   Cal-ISO didn't get full authority from the federal government to
force power plant owners to deliver needed power until June 2001.
Between November 2000 and then, Cal-ISO triggered blackouts statewide
on four days and in Northern California alone on three days. For 38
days, electricity reserves hovered at dangerously low levels.</TE>
<TE>   No Direct Conclusion</TE>
<TE>   The new PUC report draws no direct conclusion about why power
plant owners did not offer more electricity for sale to state grid
operators. It does, however, state that "generators bear considerable
responsibility for blackouts."</TE>
<TE>   The report offers many examples of power plant owners refusing to
offer power to Cal-ISO, haggling with Cal-ISO over price and delaying
repairs. A confidentiality agreement prevented the PUC from
identifying the companies, Lynch said.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 6, 2000, for example, the report describes how a
"generator H" was asked by Cal-ISO to generate 580 megawatts. The
unidentified company refused to do so without a guaranteed price from
Cal-ISO. When grid operators insisted the electricity was needed to
avoid blackouts, the company called back minutes later to report that
the plants were not available due to air quality restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana), chairman of the committee to
investigate price manipulation of the wholesale energy market, asked
PUC lawyers to speculate as to why so many megawatts were "off the
table."</TE>
<TE>   Generators Refuted</TE>
<TE>   Gary Cohen, PUC general counsel, responded that the "only reason
it's imaginable" that generators would fail to generate "is because
they thought that by withholding capacity from the market, they would
drive the price up."</TE>
<TE>   He said the report refutes generators' claims that the chief cause
of soaring prices and blackouts was a lack of power supplies to meet
demand.</TE>
<TE>   "This report shows that those excuses simply were untrue," Cohen
said. "There was enough capacity to avoid almost all of the
blackouts. Except that the companies that were in control of the
plants chose, for whatever reasons they had of their own, not to
generate."</TE>
<TE>   Smutny-Jones questioned the accuracy of the Cal-ISO data upon
which the report is based and noted that often power plant owners
keep some generating units idle as a backup so that they can fulfill
their contracts to deliver electricity.</TE>

<HD>In Santa Cruz, an Official Handout of Medicinal Pot</HD>
<DH>Protests: The action comes after federal drug authorities
busted a local marijuana club.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Officials in the ultra-liberal seaside town of Santa Cruz may not be
marijuana smokers themselves, but on Tuesday they became pot
purveyors with a political cause.</LD>
<LD>   In a display of defiance triggered by a recent federal bust of a
local medical marijuana club, Mayor Christopher Krohn and numerous
City Council members met outside City Hall to join workers from the
Women's Alliance for Medical Marijuana in dispensing the drug to sick
patients.</LD>
<LD>   Several hundred residents filled the town's City Hall plaza to
cheer speakers and throw an old-fashioned anti-government rally.</LD>
<TE>   Santa Cruz Vice Mayor Emily Reilly said suppliers drew names from
a hat to symbolically hand out pot prescriptions to a dozen patients
who would have normally picked up their medication in private
Tuesday. Each time the drug was dispensed, she said, the crowd went
wild.</TE>
<TE>   "What was best were the speeches," Reilly said. "There were
medical marijuana attorneys, doctors and even a county supervisor.
And the message was about love and healing and trying to alleviate
suffering."</TE>
<TE>   Six of seven council members appeared, along with Krohn.</TE>
<TE>   But Richard Meyer, a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman in
San Francisco, was not amused.</TE>
<TE>   "We're dismayed that the City Council and the mayor of Santa Cruz
would condone the distribution of marijuana," he said. "I don't know
what they're thinking, but they're flaunting federal law. And we here
at the DEA take violations of the law very seriously."</TE>
<TE>   Marijuana--medical or otherwise--is illegal under federal law. But
under California law, the drug is legal if it is recommended by a
doctor. Meyer would not say whether DEA agents had attended the rally
and would not discuss whether any arrests had been made.</TE>
<TE>   Police referred all media calls to City Hall on Tuesday, but local
authorities said they did not plan to arrest anyone who showed up
with a marijuana prescription.</TE>
<TE>   Reilly said she saw no federal officers on the ground, "but there
was a helicopter overhead that we assumed was full of them."</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 5, federal agents raided a Santa Cruz medical marijuana
collective, arrested three people and confiscated 130 plants.</TE>
<TE>   The move was met with outrage by residents of this surfers' haven
and college town 75 miles southwest of San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Four years before state voters approved Proposition 215, allowing
marijuana for medicinal purposes, Santa Cruz residents--by a margin
of 77%--approved a measure ending the prohibition of medical
marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Santa Cruz authorities have cooperated with local
collectives, helping set standards for medicinal marijuana use,
issuing IDs and looking the other way as suppliers provided free,
organically grown marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   No one answered the phone at the Women's Alliance for Medical
Marijuana on Tuesday, but a recording stressed that the event was not
a "free pot giveaway" and that the drug would be distributed only to
"certain patients with support of many city officials."</TE>
<TE>   The message described Tuesday's gathering as a "wonderful, quiet
and orderly vigil in honor of seriously ill and dying patients."</TE>
<TE>   Several other states have legalized medical marijuana, and Meyer
said all those areas were possible sites of similar DEA raids.</TE>
<TE>   "Like the officials in Santa Cruz, I'm sure they know that federal
law supersedes state law, and under federal law, marijuana is
illegal," he said. "Drugs are not something to joke about, especially
the city-sanctioned distribution of marijuana."</TE>
<TE>   Reilly said: "We don't think it's funny either. We take this issue
very seriously."</TE>

<HD>Supervisors' Hands Tied in D.A. Case</HD>
<DH>Government: An outside panel says O.C. Grand Jury
allegations against Tony Rackauckas can be addressed only by the
state attorney general.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Board of Supervisors doesn't have the authority to take action
against Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas despite a grand
jury report accusing him of political favoritism and intervening on
behalf of campaign contributors, a report released Tuesday said.</LD>
<LD>   An outside legal review, commissioned by the board, found that
county supervisors cannot intervene because Rackauckas is an
independently elected official with separate powers under the state
Constitution. Only the state attorney general can supervise his
office, the review concluded.</LD>
<LD>   "For this reason, we are forwarding a copy of the grand jury
report and our response to the attorney general, so that his office
may address any issues that he feels warrant his attention," the
report said.</LD>
<TE>   Nathan Barankin, a spokesman for Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer's office,
said he knows of no current investigation involving Rackauckas.</TE>
<TE>   The county report backs up the view of several legal and public
policy experts who have said the Board of Supervisors would have
difficulty acting on the grand jury's findings. The board approves
the office's annual budget, but the district attorney answers to
voters and not to the supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   The board could pass a resolution criticizing or censuring the
district attorney, but the move would have only symbolic
significance.</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury report, prepared with assistance from Lockyer's
office, accused Rackauckas of intervening in criminal cases at the
request of political supporters, hiring family members of friends
over more-qualified candidates and using public resources for
personal business.</TE>
<TE>   One of the panel's recommendations is to bar the district attorney
from hiring decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas has defended his record, saying the grand jury was
misled by disgruntled employees who backed his political foes. In his
own 153-page response, Rackauckas said the grand jury presented a
"one-sided" view of his office.</TE>
<TE>   The board-ordered review was prepared by the San Leandro law firm
of Meyers, Nave, Riback, Silver &amp; Wilson. It will be discussed by
supervisors at next Tuesday's meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors were reviewing the findings Tuesday. Todd Spitzer, who
has been outspoken in his concerns over the grand jury report,
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors hired the firm in July to respond to the grand jury,
which detailed 92 findings and made 42 recommendations after
interviewing 68 witnesses and viewing 400 exhibits.</TE>
<TE>   Most responses conclude that the district attorney has sole
authority and broad discretion to run his office, hire employees and
determine the means of prosecuting crimes. Many of his employees are
"at-will" and don't have the same protections as regular county
employees.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's authority was confirmed, the review said,
by a 1975 lawsuit filed against Orange County by then-Dist. Atty.
Cecil Hicks, who successfully challenged a plan by the Board of
Supervisors to reorganize his office.</TE>
<TE>   The county review could not respond to some of the grand jury's
findings because the conclusions were subjective, such as whether
certain hiring decisions were fair or certain prosecutorial decisions
were appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   The county wasn't given copies of the grand jury testimony, the
review said, and had no independent knowledge of the alleged
misdeeds.</TE>
<TE>   "Such [responses] should not suggest that we condone conduct which
is contrary to good public administration or that we pass judgment on
the work of the grand jury," the review said.</TE>
<TE>   The review concurred with a finding by the grand jury that a plan
to give wallet badges to contributors to a foundation established by
Rackauckas "exhibited poor judgment."</TE>
<TE>   That plan was ill-advised "to the extent that the use of such
badges could confuse the public," the board review said. The badge
idea was considered but never pursued, Rackauckas said in his
response.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, attorneys for Rackauckas filed a lawsuit
asking a judge to provide him with the grand jury's investigative
files. Specifically, he asked for evidence provided by a former top
deputy and two other employees who went to state prosecutors with
allegations of wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas said he needed the information to defend himself
against a wrongful-termination suit filed by former prosecutor Mike
Jacobs.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs was dismissed after he and two other employees provided
letters and documents to Lockyer's office that accused Rackauckas of
giving favorable treatment to campaign contributors.</TE>

<HD>Vendors at LAX Face Disruption</HD>
<DH>Airport: Up to 20% of concession space could be demolished
to add security checkpoints.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The city agency that operates Los Angeles International Airport may
have to demolish up to one-fifth of the facility's lucrative
concession space to accommodate additional security checkpoints
necessitated by new federal security standards.</LD>
<LD>   The airport agency plans to start construction this month to
increase the number of security checkpoint lanes at LAX by 25%.</LD>
<LD>   The work may require the relocation of 13 concessions in Terminals
1, 3 and 6 and the Tom Bradley International Terminal. Shops and
restaurants in the five other terminals will not be affected.</LD>
<TE>   The most visible change is likely to come at Terminal 1, home to
America West, Southwest Airlines and US Airways, where one of the
airport's most profitable food courts and one of its most popular
bookstores could be replaced by two new security lanes. The
additional lanes are needed to ease long lines that often snake
outside from Terminal 1 to Terminal 2.</TE>
<TE>   Concession operators and workers said the proposed changes come as
they are struggling to recover from a downturn in travel and new
security procedures that allow only ticketed passengers past security
checkpoints.</TE>
<TE>   Souvenir shops, bookstores and restaurants displaced by
construction would be moved elsewhere in the airport. The targeted
concessions, which occupy about 20,000 square feet, generate about
$20 million in sales each year, resulting in $2.8 million in fees for
the airport agency. Most of the concessions are operated by
conglomerates such as W.H. Smith and H.M.S. Host. Some are contracted
out to smaller businesses owned by women and minorities.</TE>
<TE>   Officials emphasized that the demolition plans must be cleared by
the federal Transportation Security Administration.</TE>
<TE>   Airport officials still hope to negotiate a compromise that would
not necessitate demolishing all 13 concessions, or that would allow
them to relocate the businesses before construction begins.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a worst-case scenario," said Airport Commission President
Ted Stein. "We would like the ability to negotiate with the TSA to
try to save as many concession spaces as possible."</TE>
<TE>   The commission voted unanimously Tuesday to give the airport
agency's executive director the authority to displace the 13
concessions. The agency said more security checkpoints are necessary
to decrease congestion and to minimize security breaches.</TE>
<TE>   "We're working with concessionaires to accommodate their
businesses in other areas," said Paul Haney, an airport spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "We want the concessions to continue to be available to the
traveling public, and we want to preserve concession worker jobs and
the revenue stream coming to the airport."</TE>
<TE>   Concession operators said even if "half the worst-case scenario"
comes true, relocation efforts could lead to hundreds of thousands in
lost revenue, and require anywhere from three to six months to move
stores. "This could take away anywhere from 10% to 20% of our gross
revenue. That's a pretty substantial hit," said Clark Davis,
president of C.S. Davis Co. and a lobbyist for W.H. Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Construction plans could affect six of W.H. Smith's holdings at
LAX, including its top-and third-grossing stores: the American
Collection gifts store in the Bradley terminal and Waterstone's
Booksellers in Terminal 1, respectively, Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   At the commission meeting, union organizers expressed concern
about what will happen to the 200 or so employees who work for W.H.
Smith and other vendors.</TE>
<TE>   "There are still many questions to be answered, such as what will
the full impact be on workers and on their long-term job security?"
said Maria Loya, director of public policy and advocacy for the Los
Angeles Alliance for a New Economy.</TE>
<TE>   About half of the 200 workers are employed by restaurants in a
food court in Terminal 1, including Gordon Biersch Brewery, Boudin
Sourdough Bakery, California Pizza Kitchen, Naked Juice and
Starbucks. For many of these employees, it is the second time in a
year that they have had to worry about layoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "I was laid off after 9/11 for six months and I maxed out my
credit cards. I couldn't pay my mortgage," said Lotus Silva, who
works as a bartender at Gordon Biersch Brewery. "If I'm laid off
again, how am I going to get basic things for my two little girls,
like food and health care?"</TE>
<TE>   Concessionaires said that they hope to avoid layoffs, but that
they could become necessary if their shops and restaurants are
relocated to areas that aren't as profitable as their current
locations.</TE>

<HD>Tension Builds in Latest Police Drama: Who'll Lead LAPD?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This search for a new chief of the LAPD, one of the most notorious
departments in the history of guns and badges, is getting more
entertaining by the day.</LD>
<LD>   Author James Ellroy, who wrote "L.A. Confidential," has cast his
vote for a guy who was barely on the radar screen (see LAPD Capt.
James McDonnell).</LD>
<LD>   Superstar scribe Tom Wolfe once called another candidate "a cop's
cop," and--who would have thunk it?--"an intellectual" (see
ex-Philadelphia Commissioner John Timoney, who worked in the New York
precinct featured in Wolfe's "Bonfire of the Vanities").</LD>
<TE>   And law professor Erwin Chemerinsky was knocked out by yet a third
candidate, but poses a question Joe Friday never would have asked:
"Is L.A. ready for a gay, Jewish police chief?" (see LAPD Deputy
Chief David Kalish).</TE>
<TE>   See what I mean? This sort of headhunting can be a dull enterprise
in other locales, but we've got drama and suspense under a bright
September sun.</TE>
<TE>   The bravest thing Jim Hahn has done so far as mayor of Los Angeles
was get rid of LAPD Chief Bernard Parks. But that was the easy part.</TE>
<TE>   Now the mayor, and the Police Commission, which will narrow the
field of candidates from 13 to three, have to figure out which one
can rescue us from a history of corruption scandals, sinking morale
and nationally televised batting practice.</TE>
<TE>   Do we stick with one of the six current LAPD officials on the
theory that a cranky rank and file will torpedo any outsider?</TE>
<TE>   Do we go with one of two former LAPD officials on the theory that
what's needed is an outsider who knows the city and the department?</TE>
<TE>   Or do we pick one of the five outsiders on the theory that only a
fresh breeze can deodorize the place?</TE>
<TE>   The Hahn crew seems to have a crush on Philadelphia's Timoney, as
do a lot of people in and out of law enforcement. Hahn sent a
lieutenant to the City of Brotherly Love to ask questions about the
ex-chief, who is now in private security.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor didn't return my call, so I'm not sure he's heard about
the Timoney blunder.</TE>
<TE>   First the good news from Philadelphia:</TE>
<TE>   Timoney--who once lectured a college class on Dostoevsky's "Crime
and Punishment"--took over a backward Philadelphia Police Department
in 1998 and began to clean house.</TE>
<TE>   The Ireland-born cop, who was part of New York's legendary
crackdown on crime in the mid-1990s, became an overnight rock star in
Philadelphia, patrolling the streets on his bicycle. During the
Republican National Convention, he cold-cocked a demonstrator who was
trying to overturn a police car.</TE>
<TE>   But Timoney, a reformer in many ways despite charges that he had
been too protective of gung-ho cops in New York, had struck out in
one of his first moves in Philadelphia. When the local Inquirer dug
up the case and decorated its front page with the details last year,
it was the beginning of the end for Timoney.</TE>
<TE>   One night in 1998, a prominent Philadelphia homicide cop got
blitzed, plowed into another car and kept on going, inflated air bag
and all. The whole affair was covered up by cops, then investigated
internally, and the disciplinary action fell to Timoney.</TE>
<TE>   Arrest and prosecution? Dismissal? Demotion?</TE>
<TE>   No. A 20-day suspension.</TE>
<TE>   When the story broke last year, Timoney defended his decision
until the mayor cracked down on him in public. The drunken cop was
later fired and indicted.</TE>
<TE>   When I talked to Timoney Tuesday by phone, he admitted he made a
mistake.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just a bad call on my part," he said, explaining that it
was one of 500 carry-over cases from the previous administration, and
he didn't pay close enough attention.</TE>
<TE>   When I asked L.A. Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook if he knew about
Timoney's bad call, he didn't answer. Instead, he lectured me about
how I was the guy who first told him about Timoney when Parks was
dumped. "This was your candidate," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At least I bothered to check him out. Do I have to do everything
for these guys?</TE>
<TE>   They might be better off without Timoney, anyway. The man's got
charisma and personality, and Hahn would be standing in his shadow by
Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it'd be nice to have a chief who can point out to the LAPD
that "Crime and Punishment" was not the Rodney King story.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, the insider candidates have all the baggage that comes
with being insiders, and the two former insiders have their problems,
too. One's got some deadly-force issues in his community (see Chief
Art Lopez in Oxnard), and the other spewed anti-gay nonsense (see
Chief Mark Kroeker in Portland).</TE>
<TE>   Chemerinsky, the USC law professor who's teaching at Duke
University this semester, said he doesn't think it much matters
whether Hahn picks an insider or outsider. What's more important is
finding the candidate with the best plan to overhaul the culture of
the LAPD, open the force up to outside review, dole out disciplinary
action with greater consistency, and rally cops out of their funk.</TE>
<TE>   Chemerinsky says three of the candidates currently with the LAPD
called him this summer to share their plans and get his feedback.</TE>
<TE>   "Two were really impressive," he says, withholding their names.
"But I was extremely impressed by Kalish in terms of his commitment
to reform, his recognition of the problems, and his having a detailed
agenda. It was one of those breakfast meetings that keeps going on
and on, because he had an extremely specific level of detail."</TE>
<TE>   With Kalish, who came out about his homosexuality this summer, you
sort of get an insider who's out, which might be better than an
outsider who wants in.</TE>
<TE>   Is L.A. ready for it?</TE>
<TE>   The fact that we're asking tells you we've come a long way since
Daryl Gates.</TE>

<HD>Baca Finds Little Unity in Homelessness Fight</HD>
<DH>Aid: The sheriff has been a lonely voice on issue. Most
local leaders won't attend summit he called.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA RIVERA and JOCELYN Y. STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As sheriff of Los Angeles County, Lee Baca has often expressed
outrage at the plight of people living "like animals" on dirty
sidewalks and under freeway overpasses.</LD>
<LD>   He also has publicly acknowledged that his own department--which
each day releases scores of homeless people back onto the streets
from jail--is a major contributor to the problem.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, Baca will host a summit on homelessness at which he
hopes the region's social service activists, civic officials and
business leaders will present possible solutions for one of Los
Angeles' most intractable challenges.</LD>
<TE>   But the event, at the Central Library in downtown Los Angeles, is
likely to also point out the divisions and cross purposes with which
the county has historically tackled the issue.</TE>
<TE>   For example, as Baca is convening his meeting, Los Angeles Mayor
James K. Hahn is scheduled to be in Van Nuys discussing the city's
affordable housing trust fund and has no plans to attend the
homelessness summit. And except for Los Angeles City Council members
Jan Perry, who represents downtown and is co-hosting the meeting, and
Eric Garcetti, none of the 15 council members were scheduled to
attend, with most citing time conflicts with other events. Of the
five county supervisors, only Yvonne Brathwaite Burke has confirmed
her attendance, summit organizers say.</TE>
<TE>   For many advocates for the homeless, the competing events
symbolize how the lack of coordination hampers efforts to address the
issue and obtain for Los Angeles County its rightful share of federal
homeless dollars.</TE>
<TE>   The 'How' Is the Rub</TE>
<TE>   Homeless service providers frequently compete among themselves for
scarce resources and squabble over philosophies. A schism exists
between affordable housing advocates, who place a priority on
expanding low-income housing stock, and homeless activists who push
the need for mental health, drug recovery and other social services.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone agrees that people need to get off the streets but how
we should get them off is the question that divides all sides," said
Mark Casanova, executive director of the nonprofit group Homeless
Healthcare, who said he will attend Baca's meeting.</TE>
<TE>   With a dizzying array of city, county, state and federal agencies
involved in homeless issues, "it's quite easy for officials to
basically not participate in developing a policy," added UCLA law
professor Gary Blasi, a housing expert. "The city can say [the
problem] is the county's welfare and mental programs, the county can
say it's the city's redevelopment policies."</TE>
<TE>   For several years, Baca has been the highest-profile official to
address homelessness in the area. His interest has been applauded by
advocates who nonetheless remain wary of some of his ideas such as
erecting an encampment near the Twin Towers jail for street people
who resist social-service provisions.</TE>
<TE>   Baca maintains that his and the mayor's cross-city events do not
represent a conflict between him and Hahn and that the timing was
probably a coincidence. "I'm glad the mayor is moving aggressively on
the subject and I'm motivated by what he's doing," said Baca. "I
don't expect other elected officials to flock to my conference any
more than I expect them to flock to the mayor's conference."</TE>
<TE>   But Baca is also frustrated that more elected officials have not
taken on his cause.</TE>
<TE>   "It is time for other public officials besides myself and
Councilwoman Perry to start pressing and forcing this issue," Baca
said. "Excuses have run out."</TE>
<TE>   Housing advocates, meanwhile, say Hahn has displayed heightened
awareness of homelessness and housing issues compared to the previous
city administration. Hahn's biggest initiative is support of an
affordable housing trust fund that will grow to $100 million over
time for the creation of low-income housing. As yet, though, no money
has been allocated from the fund.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn was unavailable for comment about the homelessness summit,
but an aide said the mayor will send a member of his staff to the
Baca meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "The mayor has a lot of things that he's facing right now, with
the breakup of the city and the appointment of a new [police] chief,"
said special assistant Eric Brown. "It's not that he's not being
supportive, he's very busy. He is very supportive." Hahn recognizes
that the county and the city must work together on the issue, Brown
added.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, a city agency,
recently commissioned several studies to help develop a 10-year
strategic plan for the region. Hahn has agreed to chair a related
committee that is expected to include Baca and other county officials
and begin meeting in the near future.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County has among the highest numbers of people without
shelter, according to several studies. An estimated 11,000 people are
homeless in downtown's skid row and at least 25,000 countywide,
according to the Institute for the Study of Homelessness and Poverty,
which is affiliated with the Weingart Center, a downtown homeless
agency. That skid row population presents tough realities to the
developers, business leaders and new loft owners who are trying to
remake downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Baca said he hopes the summit will illuminate living conditions
that, if caused by natural disaster, would be viewed as a calamity.
"It should be an emergency when the numbers of people we have in Los
Angeles County go without shelter each night," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Grist for Discussion</TE>
<TE>   Activists and others were asked in advance for ideas to be
presented at Thursday's meeting, which starts at 8:30 a.m. and is
open to the public. Baca said he will suggest that every county
resident contribute at least $100 to a fund dedicated to help the
homeless get off the streets. Other proposals urge churches to adopt
and aid the homeless in their communities, cities to set up systems
of portable shelters and agencies to establish a computerized log of
clients and what social services they received.</TE>
<TE>   One of the challenges for Baca's summit and any other effort is a
homeless population that defies easy categorization; it includes
women, children, families, people who have fallen into homelessness
as a result of illness or job loss, the severely mentally ill, drug
addicts and opportunists engaged in criminal behavior. Moreover,
their numbers could increase soon, if, as predicted by many
advocates, the ranks are swelled by welfare recipients cut off from
cash aid early next year because of federal time limits.</TE>
<TE>   Summit planners say they want to make the issue relevant to county
residents who rarely encounter street people in the numbers prevalent
downtown.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously some council districts are more impacted by
homelessness than others," said Perry. "I can tell you from
experience that there are significant pockets of homelessness
throughout our city, not just in skid row, but in Venice, in the San
Fernando Valley around Hansen Dam, in Pico Union. It's a citywide
issue. Actually, it's a regional issue."</TE>
<TE>   For example, in Santa Monica, long considered tolerant toward its
large homeless population, officials next week will consider whether
to restrict charity groups from feeding people in public parks.</TE>
<TE>   Business leaders from downtown Los Angeles want to make sure that
their concerns are not ignored at the summit.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people don't want to recognize the economic impact as an
important concern," said Central City Assn. executive Carol Schatz,
who will address Baca's session. "If people are uncomfortable going
to a restaurant because they are hit up by someone they perceive as
homeless, or if they're uncomfortable walking along the streets, they
don't want to come back."</TE>

<HD>Budget Loss Up to $10 Million Feared</HD>
<DH>Government: While exact figures aren't known, Ventura
County casualties could include health clinics and social service
programs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County government is bracing for an additional $10-million
budget cut, a loss that could result in the closure of health clinics
and the slashing of social service programs for the area's neediest
residents.</LD>
<LD>   Preliminary estimates released Tuesday by County Executive Officer
Johnny Johnston's office show the county could lose up to $10 million
because of reduced funding in the state's recently passed budget.</LD>
<LD>   Although precise figures won't be known for two weeks, county
managers are already preparing to cut services for mentally ill
adults, recipients of food stamps and oversight of children in
protective custody due to suspected abuse or neglect.</LD>
<TE>   Barbara Fitzgerald, director of the Human Services Agency, said
she has been holding positions vacant for several months with the
assumption she would fill them once the county's true financial
health became clear.</TE>
<TE>   But the magnitude of the proposed cuts means she won't be able to
hire anyone, Fitzgerald said, leaving the remaining workers with too
much to handle. Fitzgerald called Gov. Gray Davis' decision to cut
funding for child-protective services "irrational."</TE>
<TE>   "It means fewer caseworkers and it may mean fewer visits" to check
the welfare of abused children, Fitzgerald said.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to put children at risk."</TE>
<TE>   The Human Service Agency's share of the cuts is $3.8 million.
Health care programs would take an even larger hit at $4.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Health Care Agency Director Pierre Durand was not available for
comment Tuesday. But the funding cuts fall hardest on programs that
help mentally ill adults get by on their own. The state has targeted
the adult Systems of Care programs for $2 million in reductions.</TE>
<TE>   The Behavioral Health Department already incurred a $3-million cut
in an earlier round of budget slashing by the Board of Supervisors.
At that time, officials were proposing to cut the Port Hueneme Mental
Health Clinic unless additional revenue was found.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors will have to decide what programs are priorities for
restored funding--if the revenue can be found.</TE>
<TE>   One option is for supervisors to dip into tobacco settlement
money. But that most likely would draw resistance from an advisory
group that makes recommendations on how the $11 million in annual
funding is spent.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of new health care programs--including smoking-cessation
efforts--have been created in the county as a result of the advisory
group's work. Advisory leaders have said it would be a mistake to gut
the programs because of a temporary budget problem in county
government.</TE>
<TE>   But board Chairman John K. Flynn said it may be necessary to look
at the funds.</TE>
<TE>   "That's really the only place where there's a bag of money. And
it's a very big bag," Flynn said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are fundamentally responsible for providing basic human
services. Anyone who comes to the hospital door has to be served. So
we can't cut those services."</TE>
<TE>   Flynn said he would also suggest looking at "inefficiencies" in
the Human Services Agency, the department that administers social
service programs.</TE>
<TE>   It may also be possible to draw some money from First 5 Ventura
County, an independent public commission that distributes $12 million
annually in tobacco tax funding, Flynn said.</TE>
<TE>   That money is reserved for programs serving children up to age 5.</TE>
<TE>   The $10 million in reductions comes on top of $17 million
supervisors trimmed from the county budget in June. Fiscal managers
warn that even with the next round of cuts, the pain may not be over.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento legislators were able to patch together a $99-billion
budget, but it relies on accounting maneuvers and financial
assumptions that may not pan out, said Bert Bigler, deputy county
executive officer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to be optimistic," Bigler said. "It may be that the
toughest stuff has just been put off a year."</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carlos Guillen hit a two-out single that scored pinch-runner Jose
Offerman in the bottom of the 10th inning and the Seattle Mariners
defeated the Texas Rangers, 3-2, Tuesday night.</LD>
<LD>   Seattle is seven games behind Oakland in the American League
wild-card race with 11 games left.</LD>
<LD>   John Olerud led off the 10th with a single against Rich Rodriguez
(3-2) and Offerman pinch ran. He took second on Bret Boone's
sacrifice, moved to third on an infield out and scored on Guillen's
drive against C.J. Nitkowski, which bounced off the center-field
wall.</LD>
<TE>   Seattle had runners on first and second with nobody out in the
eighth, but Guillen and pinch-hitters Ruben Sierra and Desi Relaford
fouled out.</TE>
<TE>   Texas starter Chan Ho Park gave up two runs--one earned--five hits
and eight walks in eight innings.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle's Ryan Franklin, making his 10th career start, struck out
a career-high nine and walked two in 8 1/3 innings. He retired the
first 14 batters before Carl Everett's looping single into shallow
left field.</TE>
<TE>   Boone got his 99th run batted in when he walked with the bases
loaded in the first after Park walked two batters and hit another.
Olerud had a sacrifice fly in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 7, Detroit 4--The Twins won at Detroit despite losing
outfielders Torii Hunter and Jacque Jones, and third baseman Corey
Koskie to injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Jones had four hits, including a homer leading off the game,
before spraining his left ankle on an awkward slide into second.
Hunter had a bruised left triceps after being hit by a pitch and
Koskie bruised his right shin after fouling a ball off his leg.
X-rays didn't show any major injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Luis Rivas tied a career high with four hits, and Brad Radke (9-4)
sent Detroit to its 21st loss in 26 games.</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Guardado pitched the ninth for his 42nd save, tying the team
record shared by Jeff Reardon and Rick Aguilera.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 4, Cleveland 2--Tim Wakefield won his fourth consecutive
start, giving up five hits in eight innings at Boston, and Manny
Ramirez hit his seventh homer in 11 games, an eighth-inning drive.</TE>
<TE>   Wakefield (11-5) also got support from Benny Agbayani's
run-scoring single in the second and Rey Sanchez's two-run double in
the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   The home run was Ramirez's 33rd and he reached 100 runs batted in
for the fifth consecutive season despite sitting out 39 games after
breaking his finger May 11.</TE>
<TE>   Ugueth Urbina earned his 36th save. Jim Thome hit his 46th home
run for Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 10, Toronto 4--Chris Singleton hit two of the host
Orioles' season-high five home runs, and Australian rookie John
Stephens (2-4) earned his second major league victory, giving up four
runs, six hits and four walks in six-plus innings.</TE>
<TE>   Singleton hit solo homers in the fourth and seventh innings. It
was his second career two-homer game, the first coming in September
1999 against the New York Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   Stephens overcame a rocky start to win for the first time in five
starts since Aug. 17.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 6, Kansas City 1--Mark Buehrle (18-11) gave up six hits in
seven innings at Chicago and became the first White Sox left hander
to win 18 games since Britt Burns finished 18-11 in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   With two starts left, Buehrle has a chance to become the White
Sox's first 20-game winner since Jack McDowell in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Thomas and Magglio Ordonez hit consecutive homers. Mike
Sweeney homered for the Royals, who have lost 15 of 20.</TE>

<HD>Yankees Are Left Waiting for Relief</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Soriano has five hits, but New York bullpen can't
hold lead and Devil Rays win, 9-7.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The New York Yankees' bullpen finally let one get away.</LD>
<LD>   Alfonso Soriano went five for five with his 39th home run for New
York, but John Flaherty hit a tiebreaking double in the eighth inning
that lifted the Tampa Bay Devil Rays over the Yankees, 9-7, Tuesday
night.</LD>
<LD>   Flaherty's two-out, two-run double against Steve Karsay capped a
four-run rally. Carl Crawford had a run-scoring grounder against
Ramiro Mendoza (8-4) and Aubrey Huff had a run-scoring single in the
eighth.</LD>
<TE>   New York's bullpen had converted all 12 save opportunities during
closer Mariano Rivera's stint on the disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been spoiled ... we haven't given any of those away,"
Yankee Manager Joe Torre said. "It felt strange, and I hope it
continues to feel strange."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Stanton, Mendoza and Karsay gave up five runs and six hits in
two innings in relief of Orlando Hernandez.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees' magic number to clinch the American League East title
remained at four. Shortstop Derek Jeter left because of a bruised
right wrist shortly after being hit by Paul Wilson's pitch in the
seventh, and was examined after the game.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll be in there [today]," Torre said. "He's OK. That was just
precautionary. If we're in a different situation, he's staying in."</TE>
<TE>   Soriano tied his career high for hits, and homered in his third
consecutive game. He needs one more homer to become the fourth player
to have 40 homers and 40 steals in a season.</TE>
<TE>   Soriano hit his 48th double, most by a Yankee right-handed hitter.
Bob Meusel had 47 in 1927.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez, pitching to catcher Jorge Posada for the first time
since throwing a punch at his teammate in a clubhouse scuffle
Saturday, gave up four runs and 10 hits in six innings.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Posada has long caught Hernandez, they often disagree
on what pitches to throw, and frequently get angry at each other in
the dugout.</TE>

<HD>Heart, Sole for Angels</HD>
<DH>Baseball: They are alone in first after Washburn goes eight
strong innings on three days' rest and Salmon hits home run in 10th
to beat A's, 1-0.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>Play this one in October, and Jarrod Washburn and Tim Salmon are
legends of the fall. And, thanks to the September heroics of Washburn
and Salmon, the Angels crept ever closer to appearing on the playoff
stage, the one on which legends are born.</LD>
<LD>   For most of Tuesday evening, Washburn and Mark Mulder ascended to
greatness, putting dueling zeros up on the scoreboard amid
playoff-type intensity, in which one mistake could lose the game. In
the 10th inning, one mistake did cost the Oakland Athletics the game,
with Salmon hitting a home run off closer Billy Koch that gave the
Angels an exhausting and exhilarating 1-0 victory.</LD>
<LD>   "I've never been to the playoffs," Angel closer Troy Percival
said, "but I can't imagine anything much more adrenaline-filled."</LD>
<TE>   Added Salmon: "I've never been to the playoffs, but I can't
imagine any more intensity than this."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels won for the 17th time in 19 games, reclaiming a
one-game lead over Oakland in the American League West and reducing
their magic number for clinching a playoff spot to four. Their 95
victories are the most in the league, one more than the A's and New
York Yankees, and if they maintain that distinction they would clinch
home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. The 95 victories also
match the Atlanta Braves for most in the majors.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn, pitching on three days' rest for the first time since
double-A ball in 1997, threw eight shutout innings. Mulder threw nine
shutout innings, tying a career-high with 12 strikeouts.</TE>
<TE>   "It was almost like a prize fight," Angel Manager Mike Scioscia
said. "They just kept coming and coming."</TE>
<TE>   They fought to a draw through nine innings, and through the first
out of the 10th. Koch threw all fastballs to Salmon, all from 95 to
97 mph. Salmon worked the count full, then crushed a 97 mph fastball,
launching it high and deep into the left-field bleachers.</TE>
<TE>   "It wouldn't have gone out if the fence had been another 100 feet
back," Koch said.</TE>
<TE>   The victory was not secured easily. The Angels handed the 1-0 lead
to closer Troy Percival, who struck out Jermaine Dye for the first
out. David Justice walked, and the A's then employed Greg Myers as a
pinch-hitter.</TE>
<TE>   Myers hit a game-winning pinch-homer off Percival here in April,
and he came within five feet of another. He drove a ball 400 feet, to
the deep part of a spacious center field.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland's Miguel Tejada jumped out of the dugout and threw his
hands up in anticipation, then threw his hands down in frustration as
Darin Erstad made the catch on the warning track. Terrence Long flied
out for the final out, giving Percival his 40th save this season and
the 250th of his career.</TE>
<TE>   But Percival was quick to tip his cap to the starters, in respect
and almost in awe.</TE>
<TE>   "It was probably the best-pitched ballgame, on both sides, that I
think I've ever seen," Percival said.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn, quelling any concern about working on three days' rest,
pitched one of the most dominant games of his career. He gave up
neither a hit nor a walk to the final 17 batters he faced. Of those
17, the only batter to reach base did so after striking out, when
strike three was so nasty it skidded past catcher Bengie Molina for a

<HD>Celebrating Is Not a Priority</HD>

<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>For all the Angels, but particularly for those who have served the
longest, this should be a time of great anticipation. Any day now,
the Angels should clinch their first playoff berth in 16 years.</LD>
<LD>   For the first time in their careers, outfielders Garret Anderson
and Tim Salmon and pitcher Troy Percival ought to enjoy a clinching
celebration. But the Angels are unlikely to erupt in wild glee on
securing at least a wild-card playoff berth, because they still will
be chasing the American League West championship.</LD>
<LD>   "I see this team not responding at all until we clinch the
division," Percival said, "or until we clinch that we can't. We're
going to be happy we're in the playoffs, but we're focused on winning
the division and giving our fans the home-field advantage."</LD>
<TE>   The traditional clinching is accompanied by raucous celebration
and champagne showers, with the everyday players given the next day
off. The Angels did not pack champagne Sunday, when they left on this
11-day trip, and they do not plan to rest all the regulars the day
after they clinch.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not thinking wild card," Anderson said, "and I'm sure
Oakland's not either."</TE>
<TE>   Salmon, whose decade of service makes him the senior Angel, said
players have not looked far enough ahead to discuss how to celebrate.</TE>
<TE>   "You might call that superstitious," he said, "but that's part of
the success of this club."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels plan to use four starters in the playoffs, with Jarrod
Washburn pitching the opener. Kevin Appier and Ramon Ortiz would
start the next two games, although the order could be reversed.
Rookie John Lackey would start the fourth game, if necessary, with
Washburn available for a possible fifth game.</TE>
<TE>   Lackey has failed to complete six innings in three of his last
four starts. He surpassed the 200-inning mark Monday for the first
time in his pro career. Lackey is expected to start as scheduled
Saturday, after which the Angels could consider giving him extra
rest.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are leaning toward carrying 10 pitchers on their
playoff roster, with Percival, Brendan Donnelly, Scott Schoeneweis
and Ben Weber assured of bullpen spots. Scot Shields almost certainly
will join them, probably leaving one spot for either Mickey Callaway,
Dennis Cook, Al Levine or Aaron Sele.</TE>
<TE>   Sele, trying to return despite a partially torn rotator cuff,
threw 45 pitches in a simulated game Tuesday and is expected to throw
again Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I'm ready to pitch in a game," Sele said, "but it's
not my call."</TE>

<LD>Jon Gruden's new nickname at Tampa Bay is "311."</LD>
<LD>   It's a reference to the new time he awakes each morning, six
minutes earlier than he used to set his alarm when coaching the
Oakland Raiders.</LD>
<LD>   Gruden says he continues to be an earlier riser because he doesn't
consider himself as smart as other coaches.</LD>
<TE>   "Those guys deserve to be called geniuses. I'm just a grunt, know
what I mean? I'm just trying to get another four or five plays into
the script, as you can see I wouldn't be getting up this early if I
was a genius, man."</TE>
<TE>   Your modesty is touching, Jon.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who was the first UCLA player to play in the Super
Bowl?</TE>
<TE>   Three Point University: In its 25-23 victory over Michigan on
Saturday, Notre Dame (3-0) scored its first offensive touchdown of
the season. Touchdowns were so hard to come by--at least by the
offense--that Bob Molinaro of the Norfolk Virginia-Pilot said: "The
Irish may have to erect a statue of Field Goal Jesus."</TE>
<TE>   Coach's quips: A wisecrack from Abe Lemons, the late quotable
college basketball coach: "What do you call a coach who finishes last
in his conference? A loser. What do you call a student who finishes
last in medical school? A doctor."</TE>
<TE>   Back to earth: Cleveland Brown defensive end Kenard Lang, a
280-pounder, returned an interception 71 yards to set up a pivotal
touchdown in a 20-7 victory over Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw the end zone and at first ... I felt like Carl Lewis," Lang
said. "Then I felt like the Pillsbury Doughboy."</TE>
<TE>   Big spenders: From the New York Post: "Yankees David Wells, Jason
Giambi, Rondell White and Shane Spencer ran up a $1,900 food bill at
Tao, and left an $800 tip."</TE>
<TE>   A new look: California was 1-10 last season, but receiver LaShaun
Ward got the first hint his life was about to change in the spring
when new Coach Jeff Tedford called him into his office and asked for
some fashion advice.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'We're thinking about changing the uniforms. You got any
suggestions?' " Ward recalled. "I didn't know what to say. I started
making a sketch. The coaches we used to have never would have asked
us about something like that."</TE>
<TE>   The Golden Bears are 3-0 for the first time since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1954, UCLA opened the season with a
67-0 rout of the San Diego Naval Training Center. The Bruins had a
9-0 record that season and won their only football national
championship.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back again: On this day in 1976, USC routed Oregon, 53-0,
at Eugene. The Trojans had a 10-1 record and defeated Michigan, 14-6,
in the Rose Bowl game.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Linebacker Don Shinnick with the Baltimore Colts in
1969.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Rodney Peete, the former USC quarterback, who is 36
and didn't throw a pass while with the Oakland Raiders the last two
seasons, to the Detroit Free Press after passing for 310 yards in the
Carolina Panthers' victory over the Lions: "I thought I was coming
down here to hold the clipboards, help the young guys. But it's like
'The Godfather.' Every time I try to get out, they pull me back in."</TE>

<HD>Andretti to Put IRL Before CART</HD>
<DH>Motor sports: Franchitti and Kanaan also switching to Tony
George's circuit next season on Andretti team.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Andretti, the winningest driver in CART history, announced
Tuesday that he was taking fellow CART drivers Dario Franchitti and
Tony Kanaan with him to the Indy Racing League next year as part of
the new Andretti Green Racing team.</LD>
<LD>   It is the latest blow to CART, the older of the two open-wheel
racing sanctioning bodies, which has been troubled by a lack of teams
and drivers for this season's races and the loss of two of its engine
suppliers next year. Last year it lost Roger Penske and his two
drivers, Gil de Ferran and Helio Castroneves, to the IRL.</LD>
<LD>   Chris Pook, president of CART, is in Europe but said in a prepared
statement, " ... today's announcement expedites the decision-making
process that will allow our current and prospective teams and drivers
to finalize their plans for what will be a very exciting and
competitive 2003 racing season. We will concentrate our focus on
growing the CART FedEx Championship Series and cultivating the
talented drivers and teams that are coming up through the CART ladder
system of driver development."</LD>
<TE>   Honda, one of its major engine manufacturers before it broke with
CART (Championship Auto Racing Teams) earlier this year after a
change in specifications, was the key to the move. Honda, after
announcing it was dropping out of CART in 2003, surprised the motor
sports community by switching to the IRL exclusively beginning next
season.</TE>
<TE>   All three drivers have driven Honda-powered cars this year,
Andretti and Franchitti with Team Green and Kanaan with Morris Nunn
Racing. Andretti has won 42 races, most recently the Long Beach Grand
Prix last April. Franchitti has won nine CART races, including last
Saturday's at Rockingham, England. Kanaan has won once, in a
Honda-powered car in the 1999 Michigan 500.</TE>
<TE>   The new team's engines will be maintained and developed in an
exclusive relationship with Honda Performance Development in Santa
Clarita.</TE>
<TE>   "Honda is excited to be extending our partnership with Andretti
Green Racing," said Robert Clarke, Honda Performance Development's
general manager. "We've enjoyed a fruitful association with Team
Green and Dario since 1998, one that was significantly enhanced when
Michael came on board a couple of years ago. Honda has also shared in
some of Tony's successes over the years and we're delighted he'll be
part of the Andretti Green Honda program."</TE>
<TE>   Andretti, speaking from his home in Nazareth, Pa., said the
decision was made not totally because of Honda, but with a unanimous
agreement by all the team's sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   "Rumors that Honda is financing the whole thing are just not
true," he said. "Certainly it's great for us to stay involved with a
company like that, but all our major sponsors--Motorola, Archipelago,
7-Eleven and Klein Tools--felt that the IRL was the place to be in
open-wheel racing.</TE>
<TE>   "All you had to do was watch the last two IRL races, at Chicago
and last Sunday at Texas, to understand why. I would have loved to
have been in them. It's unbelievable racing."</TE>
<TE>   Sam Hornish Jr. won the IRL championship with victories in two of
the closest races in history in the final two events, nosing out Al
Unser Jr. at Chicago and Castroneves at Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a good rules package that makes for really competitive
racing," Andretti said, "and that is what makes it exciting for
everybody."</TE>
<TE>   This is a complete turnaround for Andretti, who with his father,
Mario, had been among the IRL's harshest critics since Tony George
broke away from CART in 1994 to start his own series.</TE>
<TE>   "I admit it, Tony has definitely changed my thinking," Andretti
said. "I apologized to him, to his face, for what I said in the past.
Right now, I'm glad to be a part of his program."</TE>
<TE>   The defection of Andretti to George's 7-year-old IRL leaves CART
with only one American driver, Jimmy Vasser. Also leaving CART is
Christian Fittipaldi, who announced earlier that he would drive next
year for the Petty Enterprises team in NASCAR's Busch series.</TE>
<TE>   Mario Andretti is not involved in his son's team and announced
recently that he would like to field a team in CART, contingent on
finding a sponsor.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Tracy, the third Team Green driver this year, will remain
with CART and join Jerry Forsythe's Player's Ltd. team with fellow
Canadian Patrick Carpentier as his teammate. Kool, major sponsor of
the cars driven by Franchitti and Tracy for Team Green this season,
is uncommitted for 2003, amid rumors that it may drop out of racing.</TE>
<TE>   Rumors that Cristiano da Matta, winner of five CART races this
year and the series points leader, might be planning a move to
Toyota's Formula One team have quieted down. Carl Haas holds the
contract for Da Matta's services next year and, according to sources
close to the team, his asking price for the Brazilian's contract is
more than Toyota wants to pay, especially because it can wait a year
until Da Matta is a free agent.</TE>
<TE>   "Fernandez Racing, Team Rahal, Newman-Haas, Player's Forsythe
Racing and Walker Racing have all recently committed to CART for
2003," said Adam Saal, CART vice president of communications. "We
were hoping that Andretti Green would join this group, but Michael
made it clear from the day that he announced his team earlier this
year that his sponsor partners would decide where he would race.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe Michael, and certainly not Dario and Tony,
necessarily want to leave CART, but the biggest decision most likely
came from Honda. CART will focus on what is good for its teams,
promoters, sponsors and drivers. The teams we have [amount to] a
strong nucleus. There are a lot of good drivers in the pipeline. Our
job is to find additional teams and sponsors. It's time to move on."</TE>
<TE>   One team yet to commit for 2003 is Target Chip Ganassi Racing,
which this season had Indy 500 pole-sitter Bruno Junqueira and former
500 winner Kenny Brack in CART, and former motocross champion Jeff
Ward in the IRL.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's announcement makes Andretti, Franchitti and Kanaan
lame-duck drivers for the remaining four CART races--Oct. 6 in Miami,
Oct. 27 in Australia, Nov. 3 at California Speedway and Nov. 17 in
Mexico City.</TE>

<HD>Olowokandi Deadline May Not Produce Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Clippers and center Michael Olowokandi on Tuesday were no closer
to reaching an agreement on a long-term contract extension worth more
than $80 million. Olowokandi's agent, Bill Duffy, set a deadline for
today for re-signing with the team.</LD>
<LD>   Neither Duffy nor the Clippers would comment Tuesday, but the
deadline is expected to come and go without an announcement of a new
contract. Clipper General Manager Elgin Baylor is believed to be
interested in completing a deal, but he is awaiting the approval of
owner Donald Sterling.</LD>
<LD>   Duffy said last week he issued the ultimatum because he doesn't
want Olowokandi to concern himself with contract negotiations after
training camp begins Oct. 1. Duffy also indicated that Olowokandi
would seek offers from teams other than the Clippers when he is
eligible to become an unrestricted free agent next summer.</LD>
<TE>   Duffy did not rule out re-signing with the Clippers next summer.</TE>
<TE>   Teams have until Oct. 31 to re-sign players in contract situations
similar to Olowokandi's. In addition to Olowokandi, the Clippers have
four other players eligible for long-term contract extensions.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers say they are focused on re-signing only Olowokandi
and power forward Elton Brand before next month's deadline. Brand's
agent, David Falk, said Tuesday that talks continue for a new deal.</TE>

<LD>Kentucky and Alabama lost again Tuesday when the NCAA rejected
appeals to reduce sanctions against the programs because of
recruiting violations.</LD>
<LD>   An infractions appeals committee upheld a one-year postseason ban
placed on Kentucky. It was one of several penalties levied against
the school in January.</LD>
<LD>   Alabama sought restoration of six scholarships and its bowl
eligibility. The NCAA placed Alabama on five years' probation Feb. 1,
tacking on the six scholarship cuts to the university's self-imposed
reduction of 15, and banning the team from participating in a bowl
game for two years.</LD>

<LD>   What: "Through a Diamond: 100 Years of Japanese American Baseball"</LD>
<TE>   Author: Kerry Yo Nakagawa</TE>
<TE>   Publisher: Rudi Publishing, San Francisco</TE>
<TE>   Price: $35</TE>
<TE>   The tradition and history of Japanese American is captured in this
132-page coffee-table book that is filled with fascinating text and
pictures. On the cover is a picture of Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth
posing with four Japanese players. It was taken in 1927 in Fresno,
during a barnstorming tour by Gehrig and Ruth.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the Japanese players, who were all members of a semipro
team, are the uncles of Kerry Yo Nakagawa. It was a photo Nakagawa
saw often as a child growing up in Fresno. While coaching his son's
Little League team in 1994, Nakagawa became inspired to learn more
about Japanese American baseball.</TE>
<TE>   Nakagawa's inspiration turned into a full-time avocation. He
compiled this marvelous book, which includes a lot of general
baseball history. Fresno native Tom Seaver wrote the foreword.
Nakagawa also started the Nisei Baseball Research Project (Nisei
refers to second-generation Japanese Americans), and it resulted in
an exhibit, Diamonds in the Rough, which has been shown in such
locations as Cooperstown, N.Y., and Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   Nakagawa is part of a symposium on baseball and race in America
that will be held Friday at 7 p.m. at the Natural History Museum at
900 Exposition Blvd. in Los Angeles. The panel will include former
major leaguers Dave Winfield and Orlando Cepeda, Negro League legend
Buck O'Neil, and Sharon Robinson, daughter of Jackie Robinson.</TE>

<HD>Dodgers in a Real Fix, for Starters</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Daal can't get out of the second inning, and
Giants win, 6-4, to take one-game lead in wild-card race.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kazuhisa Ishii suffered a fractured skull Sept. 1, and Dodger Manager
Jim Tracy turned to Kevin Brown. Brown went down with a season-ending
back injury Monday, and Tracy turned to Kevin Beirne.</LD>
<LD>   Now Omar Daal and Andy Ashby are mired in horrendous pitching
slumps, and who will Tracy turn to next? Giovanni Carrara? Guillermo
Mota? Robert Ellis? Victor Alvarez? The options are dwindling, and so
are the Dodgers' playoff hopes because of their patchwork rotation.</LD>
<LD>   Daal put the Dodgers in an early four-run hole Tuesday night, and
the San Francisco Giants held on for a 6-4 victory before 40,161 in
Dodger Stadium to take a one-game lead over the Dodgers in the
National League wild-card standings with 11 games remaining.</LD>
<TE>   Barry Bonds, taking advantage of a rare opportunity to swing the
bat, keyed a four-run second inning with a two-run double, and
catcher Benito Santiago had a pair of RBI singles and a double, as
the Giants evened a critical four-game series, one game apiece.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants gained some breathing room in the top of the ninth with
a run against Eric Gagne, and San Francisco closer Robb Nen retired
the side in order in the bottom of the ninth for his 39th save.</TE>
<TE>   "The way our bullpen has been going, you'd like to think we could
get more quality starts like [Hideo] Nomo gave us Monday," Tracy
said. "But tonight ... we didn't pitch well at any time to any hitter
in the first 1 2/3 innings of the game. This is not the way the
Dodgers have had success this year. We don't crawl out of many big
holes early."</TE>
<TE>   Starting pitching was the strength of the team for more than four
months, but the Dodger rotation has combined for a 3-7 record and
7.14 earned-run average in the last 11 games, an 8.31 ERA if you take
away Nomo's two starts.</TE>
<TE>   Daal (11-9) went 4-0 with a 1.87 ERA during an eight-start stretch
from July 20-Aug. 31, but the left-hander has been shredded for 14
runs and 21 hits in 10 innings of his last three starts, all losses,
and he didn't make it out of the second Tuesday night, giving up five
runs on five hits in 1 2/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Starting pitching isn't the Dodgers' only concern. Gagne, who
entered with a one-run deficit in the ninth and gave up a run, has
thrown 69 pitches in the last three games, which could affect his
availability for the final two games of the series.</TE>
<TE>   "We were only trailing by a run, we knew Robb Nen was coming into
the game, and we knew we could ill afford to give up another run,"
Tracy said of his decision to go to Gagne. "He's only had a couple
days worth of work.... He'll be ready [tonight]."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers nearly overcame their pitching problems. Paul Lo Duca
tagged from third on Shawn Green's first-inning pop to deep second
base, scoring when a stunned Jeff Kent hesitated before throwing high
to the plate, to tie the game, 1-1.</TE>
<TE>   After San Francisco's four-run second, Cesar Izturis' RBI single
in the bottom of the second made it 5-2. Marquis Grissom's solo homer
in the fifth, his 16th of the season, made it 5-3, and a punishing
hit by Brian Jordan broke up a double play to give the Dodgers
another run in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca made a spectacular play in the top of the seventh,
sprinting toward the third-base dugout for pinch-hitter Ryan Minor's
foul pop, sliding before the top step to make the catch and landing
feet-first on the sunken floor of the Dodger dugout.</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca then came to bat with two outs and two on in the bottom of
the seventh, but he swung at reliever Felix Rodriguez's first pitch
and tapped weakly to second, ending the threat.</TE>
<TE>   Relief pitching was a bright spot: Carrara replaced Daal in the
second and blanked the Giants over 3 1/3 innings, Mota added two
scoreless innings, and Paul Quantrill threw a scoreless eighth to
keep the Dodgers close.</TE>

<HD>Grissom's Catch Not Out of the Blue</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As spectacular as Marquis Grissom's game-saving catch was Monday
night, when the center fielder leaped to rob Rich Aurilia of extra
bases--and probably a home run--to lead off the ninth inning of the
Dodgers' 7-6 win over the Giants, it seemed almost routine to
Grissom.</LD>
<LD>   "I might make that catch five times a day," Grissom said. "It all
begins with the jump. You can't make that catch unless you practice
it."</LD>
<LD>   And you can't practice it unless you have a patient coach who is
handy with a fungo bat.</LD>
<TE>   Grissom has that in first-base coach John Shelby, who spends
several minutes during batting practice most days hitting balls from
behind second base toward the wall, so Grissom can hone his home
run-robbing skills.</TE>
<TE>   "You sacrifice a lot of baseballs [that go over the wall], but
that's something I do with a lot of center fielders," Shelby said.
"He's worked on it quite a bit."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It had been more than 14 years--July 9, 1988, to be exact--since
Bonds homered off Jesse Orosco, but the two-run shot Bonds hit off
Orosco in the seventh inning Monday night--home run No. 611--had a
familiar ring to it.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the same pitch [as the 1988 home run to Bonds], a fastball
right down the middle," Orosco said. "I figured, hey, we won [the
World Series] in 1988, let's see if it works out that way again."</TE>
<TE>   The home run, which pulled the Giants within 6-5 at the time, was
only Bonds' fourth hit in 25 at-bats against Orosco. Bonds' previous
homer against Orosco came as a member of the Pittsburgh Pirates.</TE>
<TE>   "He got me, but we'll keep battling over and over," Orosco said.
"I've won the battle for a long time--I'm just glad we didn't lose
the game because of it [Monday night]. I've had a great run against
Barry, but you can't go out there and think you're going to win that
battle every time."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The 10th man came into play Monday night for the Dodgers when
Giant right fielder Tom Goodwin, the former Dodger, fumbled Adrian
Beltre's fifth-inning foul ball at the rail and had a fan swipe it
from his glove.</TE>
<TE>   After the play, Goodwin leaned back against the wall in foul
territory while the fan verbally berated him.</TE>
<TE>   "He was screaming at me," Goodwin said. "I told him I felt like I
was still a Dodger, I was getting booed so much. I had to check my
uniform."</TE>
<TE>   Beltre, getting a second chance, hit a two-run double to give the
Dodgers a 6-3 lead.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Grissom was nominated Tuesday as a finalist for the 2002 Roberto
Clemente Award, which recognizes the player who best exemplifies the
game of baseball, sportsmanship, community involvement and the
individual's contribution to his team. One nominee was selected from
each of the 30 major league clubs, and the winner is announced during
the World Series.</TE>

but the Dodgers gave up three runs in the seventh and lost, 5-4.

<DL></DL>
<LD>During the Paul Kariya-Steve Rucchin-Teemu Selanne years, the Mighty
Ducks searched long and hard for a second line combination to assume
a portion of the scoring burden, with limited success.</LD>
<LD>   The latest such effort may be taking shape.</LD>
<LD>   The last two days, Kariya, center Adam Oates and winger Mike
Leclerc have skated on the top line, and Rucchin, left wing Andy
McDonald and Petr Sykora, acquired from New Jersey in a trade, have
formed the second line.</LD>
<TE>   "It's all about balance," Leclerc said.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to find the right chemistry, with guys who go to the
net, playmakers and shooters.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to spread your talent around."</TE>
<TE>   Trouble was, there was never enough talent to go around.</TE>
<TE>   Other than Kariya, Selanne and Rucchin, the Ducks have never had a
forward who scored more than 52 points.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Mike Babcock plans to team two players consistently on a
line and mix and match with the third. He said Oates and Kariya would
be linked but is undecided on the other sets. Rucchin and Sykora, who
has averaged 28 goals the last four seasons, seem a likely pair.
Rucchin has missed 108 of 162 games the last two seasons because of
injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "Andy and Mike are the keys to having two offensive lines,"
Rucchin said.</TE>
<TE>   "They have developed into good offensive players, and if they
continue we will have some production."</TE>
<TE>   Leclerc, after struggling through injuries for two seasons, had a
breakthrough year last season with 20 goals and 44 points. McDonald
had seven goals and 28 points in 53 games after he was called up from
minor league Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks, after splitting into an NHL group and a minor league
group, went to work on the power play Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Oates, Kariya, Rucchin, Sykora and defenseman Fredrik Olausson
formed the No. 1 power-play unit. Oates and Olausson, both free-agent
signings, were brought in specifically to bolster the power play,
which ranked last during the 2001-02 season.</TE>
<TE>   Veterans Jason York, German Titov and Denny Lambert worked with
the minor league group. Also in that group was prospect Stanislav
Chistov, the team's No. 1 pick in 2001. Babcock said there would
probably be movement between the two groups Monday, after the Ducks
have played three weekend exhibition games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Joffrey Lupul, the Ducks' top draft pick in June, will undergo
medical tests today to determine if he can begin practicing with the
team. He has been limited to skating because of a hairline fracture
in a lower vertebra, which required him to spend five weeks in a cast
this summer.</TE>
<TE>   If cleared to play, Lupul will begin drills but will be held out
of scrimmages and games until next week, Babcock said.</TE>
<TE>   The late start has lessened Lupul's chance of making the team.</TE>
<TE>   He has missed rookie camp and the first six days of training camp.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be tough, but making the team is my goal," Lupul
said.</TE>

<LD>Rocky Bar knows only one way to go, and his fast and furious approach
makes him the one to catch in today's $50,000 Aprisa Handicap. The
colt is the race high weight and will be giving two to seven pounds
to five rivals.</LD>
<LD>   Rocky Bar has never run over this tricky five-eighths-mile oval
but he has speed to burn and will pose an elusive target with regular
rider Garrett Gomez making a rare trip to the fair. The Kory Owens
trainee has posed for snapshots after five of his 15 starts, most
recently at Hollywood Park in July where he went coast-to-coast over
the turf. He'll be gunning for his second stakes decision, having won
the Harry Henson last season.</LD>
<LD>   On paper, FJ's Pace, with Scott Stevens riding, figures to be
right with Rocky Bar. The gelding has clicked nine times and is
coming off a strong runner-up effort in a race at Del Mar won by
Avanzado.</LD>
<TE>   Look for Rapidough to play the spoiler. Claimed after his last
start for $62,500 by trainer Cliff Sise, he has a stalking style and
figures to be there if a fast pace wears down the two speedsters.</TE>
<TE>   Completing the six pack are Hyder, who has been popular at the
claim box this year; La Bandera, who eyes the hat trick while moving
up in class, and Mistakenly Special, who returns to the short game.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Crown of Lites. 2. Amender. 3. Magnificent Max. 4.
Proud Patrolman. 5. No Love Song. 6. Foxy Johnny. 7. Primacy. 8.
Wisdom's Mark. 9. Ultimate Prize. 10. Rocky Bar. 11. The Seth Bomber</TE>

<KH>No. 11 USC AT No. 25 KANSAS STATE</KH>
<HD>Second Effort</HD>
<DH>With Michigan heartbreaks behind him, USC's Fargas has his
last chance at a dream season</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was only one play. One carry. One glimpse.</LD>
<LD>   And it caused one big stir along USC's sideline last Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Trojan tailback Justin Fargas was not supposed to play against
Colorado. A strained hamstring had hobbled the senior transfer from
Michigan throughout training camp and forced him to miss the opener
against Auburn.</LD>
<TE>   But Fargas, more than most, knows that persistence pays off.</TE>
<TE>   His right leg was broken so severely during his freshman season at
Michigan, doctors pondered amputating his foot. Fargas came back from
two major leg surgeries and another on his toe to play again for the
Wolverines. He transferred to USC in the spring of 2001, served as a
tackling dummy on the scout team last fall, then moved up to No. 1 on
the depth chart in spring practice.</TE>
<TE>   After overcoming so many obstacles, persuading Kennedy Pola, USC's
running backs coach, to put him in against Colorado was a snap. With
just more than six minutes left in the first quarter, Fargas went in,
took a hand-off from quarterback Carson Palmer and ran for four
yards.</TE>
<TE>   The yardage was insignificant. The milestone it represented was
not.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just happy to get that first carry out of the way," Fargas
said after the Trojans' 40-3 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Pete Carroll was not as thrilled. He pulled Fargas
immediately and ordered equipment personnel to confiscate his helmet.</TE>
<TE>   But Fargas will be a full-fledged member of USC's suddenly crowded
tailback rotation on Saturday, when the 11th-ranked Trojans play No.
25 Kansas State at Manhattan, Kan. USC players and fans, and a
national television audience, will finally get an extended look at
the 6-foot-1, 210-pound running back who gained 6,357 yards and
scored 82 touchdowns in three years at Sherman Oaks Notre Dame High.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm excited to see the guy get his chance," Carroll said. "He has
fought real hard to create this opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Fargas, a former state 100-meter track champion, said his goals
have changed only slightly during the last four years.</TE>
<TE>   "When I came into college, my dream was to win a championship," he
said. "I wanted to get a degree, I wanted to play in the NFL and if I
could get a Heisman Trophy along the way, that was in the plan too.</TE>
<TE>   "I still want to be a great college running back, and I still want
to win a championship and graduate and play in the NFL."</TE>
<TE>   Fargas' college career is ending at the same place it almost
began.</TE>
<TE>   He committed to former Trojan coach John Robinson in 1997, but
signed with Michigan after Robinson was fired and replaced by Paul
Hackett.</TE>
<TE>   Fargas became a starter a few games into his freshman season in
Ann Arbor and gained 120 yards against Northwestern. But on Nov. 14,
1998, after taking a hand-off against Wisconsin, he bulled his way
into the line and heard a loud crack as both bones in his lower right
leg splintered.</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, surgeons inserted two titanium rods and 12 screws
into the leg. Four months after the operation, doctors at Henry Mayo
Newhall Memorial Hospital broke the leg again because the bones were
not healing properly and inserted two metal plates. Fargas also
underwent a procedure to repair tendon damage in his big toe during
the summer.</TE>
<TE>   He red-shirted during the 1999 season, working through what a
longtime Michigan trainer once described as "the longest recovery
from the worst injury I've ever seen."</TE>
<TE>   All the while, Fargas pointed toward a game the next season
against UCLA at the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to focus on something to get through," Fargas said. "I
didn't want to believe that I couldn't make it. I had to come back
and prove that I could still play."</TE>
<TE>   Fargas returned in the 2000 season and had gained 77 yards in 14
carries going into the UCLA game. He envisioned getting 15 to 20
carries against the Bruins and showing hometown fans he could still
perform like the high school player who once dived onto a pile of
linemen, somersaulted onto his feet and ran for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   However, his dream of a storybook homecoming did not come true.
Anthony Thomas and Chris Perry were Michigan's primary ballcarriers.
Fargas gained eight yards in four carries and played on special teams
in a 23-20 defeat.</TE>
<TE>   After the game, he requested and was granted a switch to safety.
By the end of the season, he pined again for a chance to run the
ball.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to do something bigger," he said. "At USC, I saw
potential of what could be if I came in and put the work in."</TE>
<TE>   Fargas packed his car before the Wolverines' 2001 Citrus Bowl game
and drove home to Encino. He and his father, Antonio, eventually met
with Carroll.</TE>
<TE>   "He told Justin, 'We can give you the opportunity to write the
last act in your career ... with all the drama involved,' " recalled
Antonio, an actor who played the role of Huggy Bear in the 1970s
television series "Starsky &amp; Hutch."</TE>
<TE>   Fargas underwent another surgery on his toe in March 2001. It did
not take long for him to make an impression once he got on the field
for training camp last fall. Scout team players usually absorb
punishment. Fargas dispensed it.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though he had the scout line and we got to the holes and got
to him pretty quick, he didn't care at all," defensive tackle Shaun
Cody said. "He was breaking tackles and doing everything he could to
get out of there.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a wild-man. It didn't matter if he was going against NFL
players or the scout team. He's a competitor."</TE>
<TE>   Fargas gained 139 yards in one scrimmage and 111 in another last
spring to win the top spot on the depth chart going into fall
practice. His bid to start the opener ended when he strained his
right hamstring before the first fall scrimmage.</TE>
<TE>   This week, Fargas will compete for playing time and carries with
seniors Malaefou MacKenzie and Sultan McCullough, sophomore Darryl
Poston and freshman Hershel Dennis. That quartet helped the Trojans
rush for 181 yards against Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Trojan linemen welcome Fargas back into the mix.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a power runner," left tackle Jacob Rogers said. "He gives
defenses a different look."</TE>
<TE>   Fargas said he is just happy to be back on the field where he can
contribute.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the season I'll carry with me forever," he said. "Fans,
coaches, and others can say, 'Oh, that was a bad team.' Or a good
one. They'll go on and have others. I'm a senior, so this is the one
I'll take with me. I want to make it memorable."</TE>

<HD>Ratcliff Finds Way at North Hollywood</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brad Ratcliff is savoring North Hollywood's 20-14 victory last Friday
over Granada Hills for a number of reasons.</LD>
<LD>   It was a rare victory for the Huskies over a traditionally solid
program, and it adds some legitimacy to the Sunset Six League, which
many consider the weakest in the City Section.</LD>
<LD>   Sunset Six teams had a combined 8-19 nonleague record last season,
and the league champion, Grant, was routed by Crenshaw, 48-6, in the
first round of the playoffs.</LD>
<TE>   "Our league is like the doormat of the City," Ratcliff said. "It
was important for us as a Sunset Six team to beat a team from the
West Valley."</TE>
<TE>   It was also a personal victory for Ratcliff, who had a rough
three-year stretch as coach at Granada Hills. A number of the
school's better players transferred immediately after he was hired in
the spring of 1995. He also had trouble keeping coaches from year to
year.</TE>
<TE>   His teams had a record of 3-27 and he resigned after the 1997
season. Ratcliff stayed on as a teacher at Granada Hills the next
year before taking over the North Hollywood freshman-sophomore team.</TE>
<TE>   Now in his third season as head varsity coach, he appreciates the
job co-coaches Darryl Stroh and Tom Harp have done in restoring the
Granada Hills program.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very gratifying in that respect," he said of the victory.
"I struggled at Granada for a lot of different reasons. I have no
regrets. It was a very, very good experience."</TE>
<TE>   Ratcliff said he thought his North Hollywood team could handle a
stronger schedule because of its maturity. The offensive line--made
up of seniors Jose Guillen, Hernan Sebastiani and Edwin Torres, the
center, and juniors Joe Solis and Sammy Flores--averages 270 pounds
and includes four returning starters.</TE>
<TE>   Justin Tyler, who scored the game-winning touchdown on a
three-yard run with 56 seconds left, teams with Marlon Lucky and
fullback German Perez to give the Huskies an effective running game.</TE>
<TE>   They will get a major test Friday when they play at Banning, which
is coming off a 48-8 victory over Locke.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the win over Granada made our kids believe in themselves
a little more," Ratcliff said. "Banning is a tough team, but I think
we've got a shot."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Fernando Coach Sean Blunt sensed something special was
occurring when Carlos Velazquez took the ball at his one-yard line
and broke into the clear. Bill Frazer, a longtime supporter of the
Tiger program, sensed it too.</TE>
<TE>   Velazquez broke a 40-year-old school record when he returned a
kickoff 99 yards in the third quarter of San Fernando's 48-21 victory
Friday over Mission Hills Alemany. Frazer, who carries a book that
has all of San Fernando's records, quickly verified that the play
broke the 98-yard return set by Bill Marsh in 1962.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you break a record that has been standing since 1962,
that's worth noting and telling someone about," Blunt said. "The kid
was real pumped up about it. The guys did a real good job of blocking
in front of him and he did the rest."</TE>
<TE>   Matthew Nevarez, whose brother, Ruben, threw for a school-record
2,856 yards last season, had a strong debut. The sophomore completed
13 of 17 passes for 197 yards and three touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "He did a phenomenal job," Blunt said. "That will help his
confidence going into the next game."</TE>
<TE>   San Fernando plays host to Grant on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The City Section introduced an addendum to Rule 234 regarding the
participation of an ineligible player in the postseason. Approved by
the Interscholastic Athletics Committee in June, the rule states that
if it is discovered that a team has used an ineligible player after
the playoff seeding meeting has taken place, that team will remain in
the playoffs but will be ineligible for the playoffs the next season.</TE>
<TE>   City Section Commissioner Barbara Fiege said the rule change,
which corresponds to a similar rule in the Southern Section, was
prompted by the situation last year in which Westchester officials
questioned the eligibility of a few Dorsey players after a loss to
the Dons in the quarterfinals. Section officials ruled Dorsey out of
the playoffs, but their decision was reversed a day later when it was
determined the players were indeed eligible.</TE>
<TE>   The rule will continue to penalize teams that use ineligible
players but it will also serve as a deterrent to schools withholding
information until they deem it best serves their interests, Fiege
said.</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey Coach Paul Knox, whose team withstood the distraction and
won the title, said it is a fair solution.</TE>
<TE>   "If they beat that team, they wouldn't say anything," Knox said.
"But when you lose, all of a sudden you tell on them. Now you don't
have that advantage."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Damian Bryant stands only 5 feet 7 and weighs 165 pounds, but
he'll have a big say in how well Palisades does this season.</TE>
<TE>   The senior rushed for 287 yards in 40 carries and scored three
times in the Dolphins' 28-14 victory over Reseda Cleveland on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "He's strong as a bull and he has a great work ethic," said Jason
Blatt, Palisades' first-year coach.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   City top 10: 1. Taft (1-0); 2. Carson (1-0); 3. Fremont (1-0); 4.
Dorsey (1-0); 5. Birmingham (0-1); 6. Banning (1-0); 7. San Pedro
(1-0); 8. Crenshaw (0-1); 9. Venice (1-0); 10. Sylmar (0-1).</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Kings' much-hyped rookie foursome of 20-year-olds Michael
Cammalleri, Alexander Frolov, Jared Aulin and Yanick Lehoux has drawn
the most attention in training camp, but an even younger player also
has left an impression.</LD>
<LD>   Petr Kanko, an 18-year-old winger from Czechoslovakia, has shown
enough in camp that he will be in the lineup when the Kings open
their exhibition season Thursday night against the San Jose Sharks at
Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it's basically a carry over from our summer camp, where
he was one of our top two players," Coach Andy Murray said of Kanko,
a third-round pick in the June entry draft. "He's strong on his
skates and really competitive....</LD>
<TE>   "I just like the way he plays the game, with a bit of an edge."</TE>
<TE>   Frolov and Aulin also are expected to be in the lineup against the
Sharks, with Cammalleri and Lehoux playing in a rookie game against
the Mighty Ducks earlier in the day at the Arrowhead Pond. Cammalleri
and Lehoux probably will face the Ducks again Sunday night in an
exhibition game at Bakersfield.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A day after defenseman Mattias Norstrom signed a four-year,
$14.5-million contract, Murray was surprised to see the team captain
riding an exercise bike in the weight room at 6 a.m. "I said, 'Is
that part of the contract?' " the coach said of their Sunday morning
encounter. " 'Are you paid by the hour now?' " ... If nowhere else,
the Kings are set in goal with Felix Potvin and Jamie Storr, who will
split time in the exhibition season. "I don't think we're going to
try the other guys at all," Murray said of prospects B.J. Boxma,
Cristobal Huet, Alexei Volkov and Travis Scott.... Ken Belanger has
not yet practiced because of a sore back and Adam Deadmarsh has sat
out since Saturday because of knee tendinitis.... The Kings will take
the day off today to host their annual charity golf tournament,
starting at noon at Robinson Ranch in Santa Clarita. The event is
sold out.... Murray hopes to make his first cuts Monday, reducing the
roster by as many as 10 players.</TE>

<TE>   Right wing Mark Recchi will be sidelined three to five weeks with
a sprained right knee, an injury that could cause him to miss the

Panther defenseman Paul Laus had surgery on his right wrist and won't
be ready to start the season. Laus missed 34 games last season after
breaking the wrist in a fight with Atlanta's Jeff Cowan on Jan. 19.
Laus is the last remaining original Panthers' player.</TE>

<HD>Glaus Reading His Future Well</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>He has scored 93 runs, driven in 104, slugged 28 homers and, oh boy,
he hears people say, if he could only cut down on his strikeouts,
shorten and level his swing and use his power to hit to the opposite
field more often.</LD>
<LD>   Troy Glaus is 26, in only his fourth full season as the Angel
third baseman after not even one season of minor league preparation,
already has a home run title and 416 runs batted in on his resume,
and if he is learning on the fly ... well, says Glaus,
"Theoretically, we're all learning on the fly because the learning
never stops. I don't know of anybody who has licked [the game]. If
you're asking if I'd like to be more consistent, the answer is, of
course, but consistency comes with time."</LD>
<LD>   The Angels are eyeing the playoffs for the first time in 16 years.</LD>
<TE>   The process becomes easier when Glaus is producing with a measure
of that elusive consistency, but adjusting his naturally long and
uppercut swing to make it more disciplined and effective is not an
easy process for the 6-foot-5, 240-pound Glaus.</TE>
<TE>   As batting coach Mickey Hatcher strives patiently to accelerate
the learning curve, he has received assistance recently from an
unexpected source--me.</TE>
<TE>   That is not to say that the third baseman's power resurgence--he
homered in each of his last three at-bats Sunday and again in his
first at-bat Monday night--reflects the power of the pen.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the facts are what they are.</TE>
<TE>   About a month ago, through a circuitous route, Hatcher acquired an
article on Philadelphia Phillie third baseman Mike Schmidt that I had
written for The Times in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   Schmidt, en route to the Hall of Fame with 548 home runs and 1,549
RBIs, would win his third and last most-valuable-player award that
season.</TE>
<TE>   In the article, Schmidt talked about the mental and mechanical
adjustments of his early years, the emphasis he put on a focused
batting practice in which he didn't try to hit 60-mph pitches out of
the park, and the benefits of a short, level swing aimed at hitting
down on the ball and producing line drives.</TE>
<TE>   If much of it echoed the themes Hatcher had been voicing to Glaus,
he was not alone in that opinion.</TE>
<TE>   Third base coach Ron Roenicke, a Philadelphia teammate of
Schmidt's, had been discussing with Angel shortstop David Eckstein
the similarities between the young Glaus and young Schmidt, and how
Glaus could improve by using some of Schmidt's techniques.</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein told Roenicke that his brother, Rick, the batting coach
at Georgia, had an article on Schmidt that he often shared with his
hitters and that he would get a copy of it for Roenicke.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the one Angel coach saw in it the same things that the
other Angel coach did, and they gave Glaus (and several other Angels)
a copy, with the following Schmidt quote circled:</TE>
<TE>   "Think about it. Most hits are either ground balls or line drives.
The more times you attempt to hit it on a line, the more hits you are
apt to get."</TE>
<TE>   For Glaus, the article "simplified things, gave me a different
perspective. I mean, when you think about getting on top and hitting
hard ground balls, it makes sense. But I also believe that the
situation in the game, the type of pitch you get, dictates the type
swing you try to put on the ball. The picture-perfect swing would be
flat for four or five feet through the hitting zone, but is it
feasible for anyone to do that on a consistent basis? I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   It is definitely easier to read and think about than to put into
consistent practice.</TE>
<TE>   If Glaus is also saddled with a bit of stubbornness, that too is
something on which the Angels are working.</TE>
<TE>   "No one is asking Troy to cut down on his home runs," Roenicke
said. "Schmidt believed he could raise his batting average and
ribbies without hurting his home runs, and he hit more than 500.
Short, level swing. Center the ball. Hit down on it. Troy is putting
in the effort. He works with Mickey every day. He'll reach the point
where it becomes automatic."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels believe Glaus will eventually find the consistency
enabling him to reduce those inevitable periods when he struggles.</TE>
<TE>   He was batting .286 at the end of May, then hit .182 in June and
.217 in July. He hit .276 in August, when he received the article,
and he has hit six homers and driven in 15 runs in the first 16 games
of September.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not there every time," Hatcher said, "but he's working hard
at staying inside the ball with a nice, short swing. He's using his
hands, trying to stay on top, trying to hit it [to the opposite
field] when the pitch is there. This is definitely the right time for
him to get it going."</TE>
<TE>   Glaus was hitless Tuesday night as the Angels defeated the A's,
1-0, in what had been a brilliant pitching duel between Jarrod
Washburn and Mark Mulder before Tim Salmon won it with a home run off
Billy Koch in the 10th. Glaus is now hitting .249 with 19 fewer home
runs than he hit in 2000 and 13 fewer than last year, primarily the
result of his midsummer slump.</TE>
<TE>   Hatcher and Roenicke believe there's no reason he can't hit .270,
.280, which would mean that many more RBIs and, perhaps, home runs,
but Glaus said, "People put too much weight on average and home runs.
Aside from wins, the only statistics that matter to me are runs and
runs driven in. The only thing that matters are your numbers at the
end. If we win, I'll be satisfied with my year."</TE>
<TE>   Said Darin Erstad, the Angels' unofficial captain: "Troy has
struggled at times this year and he's still driven in more than 100
runs, still may hit 30 home runs. It just shows how talented he is
and how good he's going to be. I mean, people forget how quickly he
came up. He's had to take his bumps under the bright lights."</TE>
<TE>   Schmidt encountered similar bumps. It's all there for the reading.</TE>

<LD>Suzy Whaley became the first woman to qualify for a PGA Tour event,
earning an exemption to next year's Greater Hartford Open by winning
a PGA Section Championship on Tuesday at Ellington, Conn.</LD>
<LD>   Whaley, also the first woman to win a Section Championship, shot a
one-under-par 71 to finish at five-under 211 after shooting 68-72-71
at the Ellington Ridge Country Club to win the Connecticut Section
title.</LD>
<LD>   Whaley, 35, was the first woman to qualify for the National Club
Professional Championship in June. She said she hasn't decided
whether to play at the Greater Hartford Open. Her husband is the
general manager at the TPC at River Highlands, where the GHO is held
each summer.</LD>
<TE>   "My household has a lot of discussing to do on that," she said.</TE>
<TE>   GHO Chairman Dan Baker said the tournament reserves a spot for the
section champ and makes no distinction with regard to gender.</TE>
<TE>   He said Whaley, who played Tuesday from tees 10% closer than men's
tees, would have to play the Hartford event from the same tees as the
men.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With the wail of bagpipes filling the cathedral and his coffin
covered in white lilies and roses, Johnny Unitas was remembered as
"the greatest," a quarterback who made the impossible possible.</LD>
<LD>   With more than 2,000 relatives, fans and friends in attendance,
the Hall of Famer was honored Tuesday in Baltimore as a leader who
forever changed the NFL and made everyone around him better. Unitas
died Wednesday of a heart attack at 69.</LD>
<LD>   Former Baltimore Colt receiver Raymond Berry, Unitas' most
frequent target, told the crowd his teammate was a
"once-in-a-lifetime quarterback."</LD>
<TE>   "You elevated all of us to unreachable levels, whether we were in
the stands or on the field," Berry said.</TE>
<TE>   Berry was joined at the Cathedral of Mary Our Queen by NFL
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, Baltimore Raven Coach Brian Billick and
players Ray Lewis, Peter Boulware and Michael McCrary. Also attending
were former Baltimore Colt teammates Art Donovan and Tom Matte.</TE>
<TE>   "He was mythic," Tagliabue said. "He symbolizes football and, more
importantly, he symbolizes leadership."</TE>
<TE>   The memorial service and funeral Mass were open to the public. The
coffin was closed and the body was to be cremated.</TE>
<TE>   Unitas played for the Colts from 1956-72, and for the San Diego
Chargers in 1973. He set 22 NFL passing records, was the league's
most valuable player three times and was selected for the Pro Bowl 10
times. He won three championships.</TE>

<TE>   The Minnesota Vikings signed kicker Gary Anderson two days after
Doug Brien missed two extra points and a field goal in an overtime

<TE>   Anderson, 43, is the NFL's oldest active player, in his 21st
season, and is the league's leading scorer with 2,133 career points.</TE>
<TE>   The Vikings signed him as a free agent in 1998 and he played with
the team through last season.</TE>

<HD>Maddux Gets Closer to Victory Milestone</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Greg Maddux didn't think his previous start was that bad, and he
wasn't convinced this one was anything special.</LD>
<LD>   The numbers told a different story.</LD>
<LD>   Maddux rebounded from one of the worst starts of his career,
giving up four hits in seven innings to help the Atlanta Braves beat
the Philadelphia Phillies, 2-1, Tuesday night at Atlanta.</LD>
<TE>   Maddux (14-6), pitching on three days' rest, moved within one
victory of joining Cy Young as the only pitchers to win 15 games or
more in 15 consecutive seasons. Maddux is scheduled to make two more
starts.</TE>
<TE>   "If we hadn't clinched already, it would be very important," he
said. "Obviously, I want to win. When there's so much at stake for
your team, who cares, really--other than me?"</TE>
<TE>   In his previous game, Maddux gave up seven runs and seven hits in
two innings against the Florida Marlins, including a career-high six
runs in the first inning. He threw only 41 pitches in that game,
enabling him to move up in the rotation.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think I pitched too bad the last time," Maddux said. "I
pretty much threw the same pitches tonight, they just hit them at
somebody. Defensively, we had a very good game."</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 3, Arizona 2--Adam Eaton combined with three relievers
on a four-hitter in his best start since elbow surgery in August 2001
to lead host San Diego.</TE>

<HD>Salt Lake's Profit Soars</HD>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The 2002 Salt Lake Winter Olympic Games generated a $100.1-million
surplus, organizers will announce today, nearly doubling a prior
profit projection in what is sure to serve as a boost for any future
bid from a U.S. city to stage the Games.</LD>
<LD>   In April, the Salt Lake Organizing Committee said the Games had
yielded a $56-million surplus.</LD>
<LD>   Now, in preparing the books for today's final meeting of SLOC's
board of directors and the organizing committee's Oct. 31
going-out-of-business date, officials said Tuesday that the $56
million projection was low, citing a wide variety of accounting,
legal, marketing and charitable matters. The revised accounts include
$16 million in "available funds" from such sources as unused
contingency accounts and savings in venue restoration and litigation
costs, and $9 million in surplus telecommunications and copying
support.</LD>
<TE>   "We've demonstrated anew that not only can we show the world
magical Games but we can do it in a very successful financial
system," Fraser Bullock, the current SLOC chief executive officer,
said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The next time the Games can come back to the U.S. is in 2012. Two
U.S. cities are vying to be the sole U.S. candidate for those Games,
New York and San Francisco. The U.S. Olympic Committee will choose in
November. The International Olympic Committee will choose the 2012
site in 2005. Moscow, Madrid and a number of other cities are also
expected to seek the 2012 Games.</TE>
<TE>   The odds of the United States playing host to the Games in 2012
remain long. The Olympics have already been staged here four times in
the last 22 years--in Lake Placid, N.Y. (1980, winter), Los Angeles
(1984, summer), Atlanta (1996, summer) and in Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, a current of anti-U.S. sentiment runs within the
IOC--a sentiment exacerbated in recent years by the corruption
scandal tied to Salt Lake's winning bid for the 2002 Games.</TE>
<TE>   Also, in the aftermath of last September's terrorist attacks,
security concerns have emerged as a major factor in staging the Games
in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the IOC depends heavily on U.S.-based corporations.
Seven of 10 U.S. companies are among the IOC's top sponsors and its
chief financial backer is NBC.</TE>
<TE>   And, at $100.1 million, the magnitude of the Salt Lake surplus
adds to the U.S. legacy for staging financially robust Games. The
1984 L.A. Games resulted in a $232.5-million surplus. The 1996
Atlanta Games yielded a slight surplus, about $10 million; the
Atlanta organizing committee, however, decided to build a stadium and
then reconfigure it after the Games for baseball.</TE>
<TE>   At the height of the corruption scandal, in early 1999, the SLOC
board hired venture capitalist Mitt Romney to take over as CEO. He
brought in Bullock, another venture capitalist, and together they
wooed sponsors while trimming the budget. Revenue ultimately totaled
about $1.3 billion.</TE>

<HD>Challenging Bonds Isn't Worth Risk</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This is not an advice column, and I am not a major league manager,
and logic may be drowning in the growing sweat stain of this pennant
race, but there is something I must get off my chest.</LD>
<LD>   It's about Barry Bonds.</LD>
<LD>   WALK HIM!</LD>
<TE>   He is the most hated player for this town's most hated rival,
people pay big money to see him strike out, people fill the
left-field bleachers to see him boot line drives, thousands joyously
curse his name, and I don't care.</TE>
<TE>   WALK HIM!</TE>
<TE>   I'm not talking about only in the ninth inning with first base
open, or only in the eighth inning with a runner on third and two
out, or only when it seems like your pitcher can't handle him.</TE>
<TE>   I'm talking about all of it. Every time. Every plate appearance.
Every time he steps out of the dugout during the final two games of
this series.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers, who fell one game behind the San Francisco Giants in
the wild-card race after a 6-4 loss Tuesday, have no choice when
facing the Giants' best player.</TE>
<TE>   WALK HIM!</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jim Tracy needs to do it when he's leading, when he's
trailing, when he's filling out his lineup card. Paul Lo Duca needs
to stick out four fingers the minute Bonds drives up.</TE>
<TE>   You would have thought the Dodgers would have learned their lesson
before this week, when Bonds hit five homers against them in 15
previous games this season.</TE>
<TE>   Then, for Babe's sake, you thought they would have been reminded
Monday night when, allowing him to bat with first base open in the
seventh inning, he hit his sixth homer against them and pulled the
Giants to within one run in the Dodgers' eventual 7-6 win.</TE>
<TE>   But no.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday night, second inning, Omar Daal embarrassingly struggling,
runners on first and third with two out, Dodgers already trailing,
2-1.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of intentionally walking Bonds, the Dodgers hope that Daal
would pitch around him. But Daal is not precise enough to pitch
around him, and leaves a 2-and-0 pitch out over the plate, and Bonds
smacks it into left-center field to score two more runs.</TE>
<TE>   WALK HIM!</TE>
<TE>   "As hard as it is for me to say, given the way I've managed this
time, you'd have to highly consider something like that," said Tracy,
when asked about walking Bonds every time.</TE>
<TE>   Good thinking.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds is a man who, when he has come to the plate, a graphic has
appeared showing his place on the all-time home run list. In case
you've forgotten, the list goes like this:</TE>
<TE>   Hank Aaron. Babe Ruth. Willie Mays. Barry Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   This is a man who may not only be the best baseball player of our
generation, but any generation, a Hall of Famer who is having a
second consecutive MVP season.</TE>
<TE>   This is a man who every other other team has determined should be
walked at all costs. On Monday, he broke his major league record for
walks in a season with his 179th. He also extended his major league
record for intentional walks with 60.</TE>
<TE>   This is a man who another team once walked with the bases loaded,
and then showed the statistics to prove that it was a smart move.
This is a man batting in front of 80-year-old Benito Santiago.</TE>
<TE>   WALK HIM!</TE>
<TE>   Some feel that, by walking Bonds on every plate appearance, they
would be chicken. I say they would be courageously foolish.</TE>
<TE>   Claiming that Bonds should be engaged in the competitive spirit of
the game is like saying that a hitter should swing at a 3-and-0 pitch
for the same reason.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball is a sport where batters can take first base on
strikeouts, and runs can score on fly outs, and every year somebody
gets nailed with a hidden ball trick.</TE>
<TE>   So even if it doesn't seem sporting to give a guy first base, if
it helps your team, you swallow your pride and you do it.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, one study showed that Bonds reached base 1.1 times
per plate appearance. Meaning, if you played by the book, you would
walk him every time.</TE>
<TE>   After Bonds' second-inning double Tuesday, Tracy had apparently
seen enough, and intentionally walked him in the fourth and sixth
innings with nobody on base.</TE>
<TE>   But in the eighth, with Jeff Kent on first and the Giants clinging
to a 5-4 lead, Tracy ordered Paul Quantrill to pitch to him. With
40,000 breaths held, Bonds flied out.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers won that time. But is it a battle worth fighting at
least eight more times? Is it a battle worth losing a playoff spot
over? If you can beat Barry Bonds with your wits, do you have to also
prove you can beat him with your arm?</TE>

<HD>Hard to Believe Playoffs Could Be Dodger Payoff</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There were 12 games to go when I arrived at Dodger Stadium on Tuesday
night to visit the Choking Dogs, a little surprised to run into team
officials and TV personnel, who said they were setting up camera
locations for postseason play.</LD>
<LD>   I was surprised. I never thought the Dodgers would be so
considerate, throwing open their park for the benefit of Angel fans
to watch their team in the playoffs on the big-screen Dodger Stadium
scoreboard rather than make the trek to Anaheim.</LD>
<LD>   "No, we're talking about our own postseason games here," said a
Dodger official, and I must acknowledge, that never crossed my mind.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   APPARENTLY I'M not alone. The Choking Dogs put Division playoff
tickets on sale recently for Saturday and Sunday games (Oct. 5-6) to
be played in Dodger Stadium after making Division, League
Championship Series and World Series tickets available to season
ticket holders. And I have a hook hanging on my wall for when I win a
Pulitzer Prize.</TE>
<TE>   Now I know there are a lot of crazies in town, or one guy who has
100,000 different e-mail monikers, because I hear from die-hard
Dodger fans all the time and I figured every seat to the playoffs
already had been sold.</TE>
<TE>   But a team spokesman said season ticket holders purchased 17,000
tickets, and then the public bought another 10,000, accounting for
somewhere between 26,000 and 30,000 tickets sold to date for the Oct.
5-6 playoff games--leaving more than 20,000 empty seats.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets average $19 with some available at $10, so price shouldn't
be a deterrent, and Chad Kreuter doesn't figure to play, so that
can't be the excuse to stay home. I know I've got the Dodgers pegged
as Choking Dogs, but I can't believe there aren't 60,000 fans in
greater Los Angeles counting on the guys to luck out.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I BELIEVE in miracles--after all, USC and UCLA are undefeated--so
I went to Dodger Stadium hoping I could help the Choking Dogs, and
that's when Manager Jim Tracy pounced on me.</TE>
<TE>   "Man, where have you been? This isn't the time for anniversary
celebrations; with all the advice you have given us this season, you
should be here now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy looked as if he hadn't shaved in days, the gray beard a
reminder of what it's like to watch Paul Shuey pitch these days, and
I asked him with all the playoff pressure if he could contain himself
from over-managing any more than what he has already.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy gave me one of those James Bond laughs that Goldfinger got
with the laser crawling up the table between his legs like he was
going to wiggle out of this interview unscathed.</TE>
<TE>   "I did OK [Monday night], didn't I?" he asked, and I guess if you
agree he should have brought Jesse Orosco in to deliver a gopher ball
to Barry Bonds, he did just fine.</TE>
<TE>   I asked Manager [Shawn] Green if he agreed Tracy should have
brought in Orosco, and the kiss-up said, "Yes, I do, and I think he's
doing a great job."</TE>
<TE>   Then I asked Manager [Eric] Karros, and he said: "I walk him, I
walk him, and I walk him. I don't know if he's the best player to
ever play the game, but if there is a better player--that would be a
sight to see. What Bonds is doing at this level is equivalent to what
a Major League player would do if he was playing with his Little
League team. That's what a joke it is."</TE>
<TE>   Now in this instance I happen to agree with Manager Green,
although Karros was more eloquent, knowing Bonds could not tie the
score with a swing of the bat. But I worry now there are going to be
more difficult decisions in the next week, and how the Dodgers'
micro-manager might handle them.</TE>
<TE>   If I'm Tracy, of course, I don't start Omar Daal against the
Giants on Tuesday night because I know the Giants are going to rock
him for five runs before the end of the second inning. Don't ask me
how; I just know these things. I also would never start a game with
Dave Roberts on the bench, but despite the positive impact it would
have on the team, I'd look silly wearing the uniform a manager has to
wear.</TE>
<TE>   "You're worried about me, aren't you?" Tracy said, and it has been
at least a month since I've called him "Knucklehead," so I have no
idea where he got that notion. "I do a lot of work in my office, do a
lot of research and remember things I've seen. I'm prepared for
this."</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis Manager Tony La Russa, who had to contend with the death
of Darryl Kile, is probably going to be the manager of the year in
the National League if the Cardinals win the division, but a miracle
finish could vault Tracy to runner-up for a second consecutive year.
Another third-place finish behind the Diamondbacks and Giants, and
that would be something else.</TE>
<TE>   At the least we're going to find out how Tracy reacts under
playoff pressure, and with every move scrutinized by Plaschke. I was
going to say I feel sorry for Tracy, but obviously that wouldn't stop
Plaschke from writing about him.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FORMER DODGER general manager Kevin Malone is now "assistant to
the president" at The Master's College in Santa Clarita. Right now
he's probably trying to convince the president to hire Kevin Brown to
work with the alumni. It'll probably involve the use of a private
plane, however, to seal the deal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Mike Shotwell:</TE>
<TE>   "Every so often I make an attempt to read your column (like
Tuesday's anniversary column), but the experience usually leaves me
frustrated. I shouldn't have to grit my teeth and gird my loins every
time I look at the center of page D2."</TE>
<TE>   Why should you be any different than everyone else?</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Clint Mathis created a stir when he showed up for the World Cup with
a funky red Mohawk haircut, reminding pro wrestling fans of the Red
Rooster. But it's Mathis' recent raging WWE-like personality on the
field that has his coach worried to the point where he's recommending
Mathis see a psychologist.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it would in the best interests of Clint and this
organization to address that problem," New York/New Jersey MetroStar
Coach Octavio Zambrano told the Associated Press on Tuesday. "This is
strictly a situation where the player needs to handle energy in a
positive way."</LD>
<LD>   Mathis was red-carded in the 30th minute of the MetroStars' 2-1
loss Saturday to D.C. United after he had accidentally stepped on
United midfielder Jose Alegria. Zambrano, who coached Mathis when
both were with the Galaxy in 1998 and '99, intimated that he has seen
the forward yell at officials, opponents and teammates.</LD>
<TE>   Mathis told the Herald News of West Patterson that he believed
Zambrano was using the psychologist angle as motivation.</TE>
<TE>   "Octavio believes there is a problem there and the only reason he
is bringing it up publicly is to get my attention," Mathis said.
"That's fine. We'll do whatever we have to do to fix it."</TE>
<TE>   Said Zambrano: "I firmly believe he has taken the first step,
which is agreeing to [counseling]. I think he is going to be back on
the national team and be the Clint we all know and love in addressing
this."</TE>
<TE>   Real Madrid Rolls</TE>
<TE>   No Ronaldo? No matter.</TE>
<TE>   Real Madrid, the top-ranked club in the world, began defense of
its European Champions League title Tuesday in spectacular fashion,
shutting out AS Roma on its home turf, 3-0.</TE>
<TE>   With the Brazilian striker, who came to Real Madrid in a
$44.5-million transaction earlier this month, in Spain to work on his
fitness, Real Madrid toyed with its hosts.</TE>
<TE>   Guti had two goals, in the 41st and 74th minutes, and Raul had
another in the 56th minute for Real Madrid, which has won four
Champions Cup titles in the last six years and nine overall.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Brazilian soccer legend Pele thinks that worries about
Ronaldo's right knee, which bothered him throughout his five-year
stint at Inter Milan, are baseless and he expects his countryman to
have a successful run.</TE>
<TE>   "He will score a lot of goals for Madrid," Pele told Spanish
media. "His performance at the World Cup will have cleared the doubts
of those people who claimed that he was almost lame before the
tournament started. He scored goals and was a really important player
in the Brazilian team."</TE>
<TE>   It has been reported that Ronaldo, a two-time FIFA player of the
year, will make his Real Madrid debut in next Wednesday's Champions
League match against Belgium's Racing Genk at Santiago Bernabeu
stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear that [Ronaldo] will have to be a little more cautious
than before he suffered the knee injury," Pele said, "but his quality
is obvious and there should be no doubts about him."</TE>
<TE>   Mexican History Made</TE>
<TE>   When Mexican clubs Morelia and Pachuca meet today at Mexico City
in the final of the CONCACAF Champions Cup, it will be the first time
in the tournament's 40-year history that teams from the same country
are playing for the title in a winner-take-all championship match.</TE>
<TE>   It will be the first continental championship for whichever team
wins but a record 20th time that the title will go to a Mexican club.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico, though, has had a three-year drought in the tournament,
Necaxa having last won the tournament for its country in 1999 with a
3-2 victory over Alajuelense of Costa Rica.</TE>
<TE>   Teams from the same country have met in the competition's final
stage before--in 1995 when Costa Rica's Deportivo Saprissa and
Alajuelense reached the final four and in 1996 when Mexico's Cruz
Azul and Necaxa did the same. But that was when the champion was
determined in a round-robin format.</TE>

<HD>Kournikova's Chances No Longer So Remote</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Conventional wisdom, 1998: Anna Kournikova not only will win a
tournament, but she has to be considered a Grand Slam contender.</LD>
<LD>   Conventional wisdom, 2001. Kournikova seems destined never to win
a tournament, much less contend at a Grand Slam.</LD>
<LD>   Conventional wisdom, 2002. Kournikova will eventually win a
tournament, though Tier I aspirations are another matter, as long as
Serena and Venus Williams remain interested in tennis.</LD>
<TE>   So, what is it? Kournikova's progress has resembled an overvalued
tech stock on the NASDAQ board. Wild optimism and high hopes are
followed by a drastic plunge into the abyss. Then, finally, there's a
modest upswing after investors find a few assets among the wreckage.</TE>
<TE>   Her progress came under scrutiny again after another near miss in
the Far East on Sunday. For the fourth time in her career--the first
time since 2000--Kournikova reached the final of a WTA tournament.
This one, in Shanghai, perhaps more than the others, seemed ready for
the taking.</TE>
<TE>   After all, her final opponent in this modest Tier IV event was not
somebody named Williams, Martina Hingis or Lindsay Davenport. It was
Anna Smashnova of Israel, and Kournikova had defeated Smashnova in
their last two meetings, most notably at Carlsbad in the summer.</TE>
<TE>   Though newspaper space went up, and magazine pages were cleared
for the possible breakthrough, there was no Shanghai surprise.
Smashnova played determined tennis, winning, 6-2, 6-3, and Kournikova
criticized herself for not going to the net more often.</TE>
<TE>   In her first final more than four years ago, against Venus
Williams at Key Biscayne, Fla., Kournikova was close to a
straight-sets victory before a hobbled Williams fought back, winning,
2-6, 6-4, 6-1. In those days, the Williams sisters and Kournikova
were considered up-and-coming threats to then No. 1-ranked Hingis.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Venus and Serena have combined for eight Grand Slam
titles and the 21-year-old Russian is still searching for her first
WTA title.</TE>
<TE>   The closely followed numbers are fairly stunning: 117 main-draw
events without a singles championship. Not included, according to the
WTA, are four ITF futures events, the 1996 Olympics and three
tournaments in which Kournikova lost in qualifying.</TE>
<TE>   Credibility, for better or worse, seems to be linked to a
tournament victory. A win in Shanghai would have pulled Kournikova
away from her status as a human punch line on cable TV and talk
radio.</TE>
<TE>   Which comes back to the basic question: Can she simply win a
title, anywhere?</TE>
<TE>   The word "never" should probably be erased from the sports
vocabulary after the U.S. Open. The strongest evidence rests on the
tour this year. If Martina Sucha, Fabiola Zuluaga and Svetlana
Kuznetsova can all win tournaments, as they have in 2002, then
Kournikova has a reasonable chance to break through before her
winless total hits 200.</TE>
<TE>   Future Watch</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Open champion Pete Sampras and his wife, actress Bridgette
Wilson, appeared on the CNN show "Connie Chung Tonight" last week and
Sampras indicated he would continue playing next year.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still enjoying what happened last week. I will tell you I
love to compete, and I love to play," he told Chung. "It's fun again,
playing the way I did last week. I plan on being back next year,
having a full schedule and enjoying Wimbledon one more time. I didn't
want to end it the way it ended this year.</TE>
<TE>   "I plan on being back. It's what I love to do. Still thinking
about it, but there's a good chance I'll be back."</TE>
<TE>   Tournament officials in Basel, Switzerland, announced last week
that Sampras was among those entered in that indoor event Oct. 21-27.
He won the tournament in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Double Vision</TE>
<TE>   That was no misprint. Martina Navratilova and Serena Williams were
doubles partners Monday in the first round of the Tokyo Princess Cup
in Japan. They beat Conchita Martinez and Nicole Pratt, 6-1, 4-6,
6-2.</TE>
<TE>   Serena had never played with anyone other than her older sister
Venus in doubles competition on the WTA Tour, and although they've
played sparingly, they have won a Grand Slam in doubles.</TE>
<TE>   The Martina-Serena pairing doesn't look bad either, though.
Between them, they have 22 Grand Slam singles titles, 18 for
Navratilova and four for Williams.</TE>
<TE>   According to wire reports, Venus was uninjured in a minor car
accident in Florida over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Locally</TE>
<TE>   Merv Griffin's celebrity tournament will be held at the Beverly
Hills Country Club on Saturday. The charity event will benefit
Childhelp USA.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bruin cornerback Ricky Manning  has no intention of avoiding felony
prosecution by pleading to a lesser misdemeanor charge, his attorney
said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Manning, charged with assault stemming from an April 24 incident
outside a Westwood bar, is building a criminal defense and
considering civil action against Bryan Herbert, 34, and Seth Spiker,
26.</LD>
<LD>   Manning and co-defendant Tremaine Mitchell, brother of
Philadelphia Eagle and former UCLA receiver Freddie Mitchell, have
pleaded not guilty. Manning is scheduled to appear Oct. 16 at a
preliminary hearing.</LD>
<TE>   Daniel Davis, Manning's attorney, believes there are discrepancies
in the version of events Herbert and Spiker reported to authorities
and that Manning was responding to racial epithets when the fight
erupted outside Madison's Neighborhood Grill in Westwood.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't intend to dispose of this case with any plea," Davis
said. "As a college football player with a bright future, Ricky is
not willing to have any blemish on his record.</TE>
<TE>   "The evidence I have collected shows that [Herbert and Spiker]
were highly intoxicated and making racial remarks to Ricky and
Tremaine inside the bar."</TE>
<TE>   Davis said he has interviewed witnesses that include Madison's
employees.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Police Department investigators did not seek statements from
Manning before his arrest Aug. 27. The police report reflects only
the statements of Herbert and Spiker, both of whom work as security
guards at the Hollywood Athletic Club.</TE>
<TE>   "There was an opportunity in the early stages of the investigation
for the police to say, 'Let's go out and ask the people who are being
accused,' " Davis said. "That was not done. The police took the first
version as the premise of the case, then let time pass. Not only did
Ricky Manning lose out, the prosecution lost out as well."</TE>
<TE>   Herbert and Spiker told police that Manning and Mitchell waited
outside the bar and assaulted them in the parking lot. Although
neither man sought medical attention until the next afternoon,
Herbert suffered a facial injury and Spiker suffered a concussion,
two black eyes and broken teeth.</TE>
<TE>   But Davis believes the charge is baseless and that Manning's
reputation has been damaged.</TE>
<TE>   "Ricky has said he does not want to sue anybody," he said. "But he
is suffering the stigma of going through a prosecution when he was
not the aggressive assailant. We are sorry anybody was hurt. But it
was not egged on by my client."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coaches put the Bruins through more tackling drills than normal
Tuesday because Colorado is expected to run the ball. "We had a real
physical practice to prepare for that," linebacker Spencer Havner
said.... Defensive tackle Steve Morgan participated in drills Tuesday
but remains questionable because of a sprained knee.</TE>

<LD>Ryan Killeen was recruited by USC to boot kickoffs into the end zone,
a job the sophomore transfer from Mt. San Antonio College is
performing well through two games.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, in the aftermath of kicker David Davis' troubles
during a 40-3 victory last Saturday at Colorado, Killeen practiced
with the field-goal unit.</LD>
<LD>   Davis, a senior, missed an extra-point attempt and had a
field-goal and extra-point attempt blocked against the Buffaloes.</LD>
<TE>   "He deserves a chance to compete for the job," USC Coach Pete
Carroll said of Killeen.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Senior Zach Wilson is on track to start at right guard Saturday
against Kansas State, Carroll said. Wilson, a three-year starter,
suffered a strained foot on the first day of training camp and missed
the opener against Auburn. He played three series against Colorado
and worked with the first-team offense Tuesday.... Cornerback Ronald
Nunn sat out most drills after feeling pain in his broken right
thumb. After practice, Nunn got his cast reset so that it extends
past the tip of his thumb. "It feels 100% better," he said....
Cornerback Marcell Allmond also is wearing a cast for a right wrist
fracture suffered against Colorado on a punt-return play.... USC's
game against Oregon State on Sept. 28 at the Coliseum will begin at
3:30 p.m. and will be televised by Fox Sports Net.... Linebacker
Melvin Simmons, who made nine tackles against Colorado after being
hospitalized for two days because of an infection in his lower left
leg, was held out of most drills.</TE>
