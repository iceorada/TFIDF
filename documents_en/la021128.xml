<HD>Pointing to Christmas</HD>
<DH>'The Nutcracker' is an enduring reminder of what the
holiday was before video games and licensed toys.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hillary Johnson</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once upon a time, weary parents heaved a resigned sigh when the
Christmas decorations went up the day after Thanksgiving; now the
sighs are deeper and come sooner, as the garish ads and incentives
begin to appear right after Halloween. But just when consumerism
seems likely to swamp us, along comes the sweet, gentle "Nutcracker,"
which is all about the true magic of gift-giving and gift-getting.</LD>
<LD>   "The Nutcracker," in all its quaint, sugary splendor, reminds us
that there are ordinary gifts like silk ties, golfing gloves,
miniature trains and Easy-Bake Ovens, Cabbage Patch Kids and Tickle
Me Elmos, and then there are the gifts we are given by more
mysterious forces: the gift of a loving home, of a crystal-clear day
or of a child's budding talent for the dance.</LD>
<LD>   When Tchaikovsky's 1891 ballet had its U.S. premiere in the 1940s,
it received lukewarm reviews from dance critics, who thought the
music was lovely but that the opportunities it created for dancers
were exceedingly bland. How surprised they would have been to learn
that, some 70 years later, "The Nutcracker" has come to embody the
holiday spirit for hundreds of thousands of families across the
nation, especially for the those whose ballet-crazy daughters go to
sleep at night dreaming of someday dancing the role of the Sugar Plum
Fairy.</LD>
<TE>   This year there are at least 14 productions of "The Nutcracker" to
choose from in the region, from the American Ballet Theater's
professional version to productions mounted by ballet school students
and their parents and teachers. (And if you think the soccer mom is a
fanatically devoted creature, you have yet to meet a ballet dad.)</TE>
<TE>   For the children involved in these productions, and all the Cub
Scouts, Brownies and Indian Guides who flock to see their brothers
and sisters onstage, "The Nutcracker" is as relevant today as it was
a hundred years ago. The details of the plot vary from production to
production, but at its root is a simple tale: Clara receives the gift
of a wooden nutcracker from her godfather Drosselmeyer, and the toy
sparks her imagination and opens her heart. When her pesky little
brother Fritz breaks it, Clara is brokenhearted, but at night she
dreams that the nutcracker has come to life -- looking a lot like
Herr Drosselmeyer's handsome nephew, by the way. Together, Clara and
the Nutcracker Prince defeat the evil Mouse King and go on to take
the fairyland equivalent of a United Nations goodwill tour through
lands populated by Russians, Chinese, Spaniards and other assorted
cultural groups (including, of course, the land of candy, which is
ruled by the graceful Sugar Plum Fairy). Clara, who went to sleep a
child, wakes from her dream as a young woman.</TE>
<TE>   For the young girls who dance the role of Clara, "The Nutcracker"
is also a rite of passage. Hilary Heinke, 13, has been cast as Clara
in Ballet Pacifica's production this year. She started dancing at age
3 and was a mouse in her first "Nutcracker."</TE>
<TE>   To her, the story and the happy chaos it brings to her life every
year are "magical." "Every year when you audition, you dream of
getting a certain part, and it's the same as the story of Clara's
dream," Hilary says. "You feel just like you're there in Clara's
shoes. When she gets the nutcracker, it's like getting your solo."</TE>
<TE>   For Hilary, the visions of sugarplums dancing in her head are as
real as any GameCube or Xbox, and much more soul-satisfying. Hilary's
counterpart at the SoCal Dance Theatre is a 13-year-old named Hailey
Davis. Her single mother, Terri, is an operations assistant with the
sheriff's department. Terri grew up in a large, financially
struggling family in Long Beach and never expected that her daughter
would be a ballerina.</TE>
<TE>   Hailey practices for an hour and a half every day, then comes home
and dances some more to a videotape from the previous year's
production. "Sometimes I dance without music," she says. "Wherever I
am, whenever I feel like it, I dance."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a way of life," Terri adds. "It's changed our whole family.
I just enjoy riding on her coattails. Sometimes I can't believe how
much I know about ballet."</TE>
<TE>   Across town at the Westside Ballet School's hectic Saturday
afternoon rehearsal, Jim Brunet, one of the ballet dads, has been
through the Clara experience and beyond. "After Clara comes the zone
of death," he says. "Clara is the last big role they can play that is
not on pointe. From there the real work begins when they get their
toe shoes and disappear into the anonymity of the corps de ballet."</TE>
<TE>   At Westside and other ballet schools, parents must commit to many
hours of volunteer work, sewing costumes, producing fliers and
selling cookies. Brunet is handling the program as well as making a
behind-the-scenes video. His 15-year-old daughter, Gillian, has been
dancing at Westside Ballet for 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   "We spend all our lives here," Gillian says, just as an impish
little girl dressed as a boy in corduroy knickers and a porkpie hat
leaps into her arms. "This is Indigo," Gillian says, laughing. "I
play her mother."</TE>
<TE>   The girls in the studio are affectionate with one another during
rehearsal, but only one can land the coveted role of Clara -- or two,
if the role is alternated between performances -- and the agony of
competition is said to be fierce in early September.</TE>
<TE>   At Westside Ballet, younger girls have even been known to grapple
over costumes believed to confer luck on the wearer. A certain yellow
dress has been worn by three girls who went on to dance the Clara
role, and it is much sought after among the 10- and 11-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   But the competition begins even earlier. "There's one very tiny
mouse who is left onstage alone after the king gets killed, and he
cries onstage all by himself," explains the school's artistic
director, Yvonne Mounsey. "The little ones, they all want to be the
crying mouse."</TE>
<TE>   Mounsey, who was one of George Balanchine's original dancers at
the New York City Ballet, shakes her head again and again while a
Spanish dancer tries out a move, then simply steps in and
demonstrates how it's done. Mounsey is 84 years old.This is the 33rd
year in a row she has mounted a full production of "The Nutcracker."</TE>
<TE>   "Every year I think, 'Oh, my God, another 'Nutcracker!' " she
cries, throwing up her hands.</TE>
<TE>   "And then I end up enjoying it so much. We have our moments, like
the night one of our cavaliers left his dog in the dressing room and
it wandered onto the stage."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the cast of the first act gathers in the main rehearsal
space, including several parents dressed as 19th century party-goers.
Jim Camparo's two daughters have grown up and left the school, the
younger to train with the Pacific Northwest Ballet, but he still
comes back every year out of nostalgia.</TE>
<TE>   "It wouldn't be Thanksgiving or Christmas without the
'Nutcracker,' " he says, shrugging.</TE>
<TE>   While the adults and little ones rehearse the party scene, limber
teenage girls in black leotards and pink tights sit in groups of
three or four along the mirrored wall like so many birds at rest.
Every one of them wears her hair in a neat chignon at the nape of her
long neck. They look like a painting by Degas.</TE>
<TE>   Only a very few boys mingle among them, and they don't necessarily
want to let their secret out. Being the only boy among so many girls
is "awesome," according to Abe Cohen Hoffing.</TE>
<TE>   And 14-year-old E.J. Camp agrees, saying that ballet helps him
with his other activity: boxing. "It can help you with anything. It
works both your mind and your body."</TE>
<TE>   Incredibly, these young ladies and gentlemen are as graceful and
composed within as they are on the outside. While their seemingly
ageless teacher has the verve and suppleness of a teenager, these
teens have the poise of much older people.</TE>
<TE>   "I relate my life to a four-leaf clover," explains 13-year-old
Chelsea Rooke, who has come straight from her 8-year-old sister
Carra's soccer practice, when asked how she juggles it all.</TE>
<TE>   "Each leaf is an area of my life: dance, family, friends and
school." She proceeds to hold forth for a while on how much learning
the discipline of dance has helped her with things like memorizing
vocabulary in Spanish and how she plans to attend Princeton if she
doesn't get on with a major dance company.</TE>
<TE>   This is a young lady who clearly feels at home in any era, be it
past, present or future. And that is the "Nutcracker's" best gift of
all, that sense of universal connection between generations, of
continuity from one era to the next through basic principles like
generosity, wonder and community.</TE>
<TE>   Out on the rehearsal floor, Herr Drosselmeyer, wearing khaki
Dockers, a polo shirt and a cape, presents young Clara with her
nutcracker, and she pirouettes in a timeless gesture of delight, just
as hundreds of Claras are doing on this same Saturday afternoon
throughout the country and the world.</TE>
<TE>   And whether we're celebrating Christmas, Hanukkah, Eid or Kwanzaa
or simply exchanging gifts in the pure spirit of nondenominational
love, "The Nutcracker" is always there, reminding us ever so gently
of the holidays' true meaning.</TE>

<HD>Scientists dig for answers about army ant habits</HD>

<LD>Have you ever looked for one thing and found something else? Isaac
Asimov, a well-known writer, once said, "The most exciting phrase to
hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not
'Eureka!' [I found it!] but 'That's funny....' "</LD>
<LD>   One day, two scientists at UCLA Stunt Ranch Reserve were watching
colonies of honey-pot ants and they found something funny.</LD>
<LD>   As they dug up a nest entrance, they saw small, blind, yellowish
worker ants and larger soldier ants. Could these be army ants? The
funny part was that these kinds of ants are rarely seen in
California.</LD>
<TE>   They showed samples to another scientist. He agreed that they were
a species of army ants whose scientific name is Neivamyrmex leonardi.</TE>
<TE>   Army ants are known for eating anything in their path. For food
they raid other ant or termite colonies. Little else is known about
them because they live underground and hunt mostly at night.</TE>
<TE>   The scientists will continue to study the ants and observe how
they relate to other ants at Stunt Ranch.</TE>
<TE>   The UCLA Stunt Ranch Reserve is a 310-acre outdoor classroom and
living laboratory homesteaded by the Stunt family in 1885. It is home
to a variety of animals and insects, including the ants described
here. You can learn more by taking part in one of the environmental
programs offered for grades K-12 by the Cold Creek Docents. For more

<LD>Maria and Alfonso were spending Thanksgiving weekend in the mountains
with Uncle Ruben, who worked as a nature guide.</LD>
<LD>   Uncle Ruben was explaining how the American Indians of the East
Coast taught the first pioneers to survive the harsh weather.</LD>
<LD>   "The Indians who lived on the East Coast were masters of the
woods. See this cup?" asked Uncle Ruben, pulling a small birch-bark
cup out of his pack.</LD>
<TE>   "It looks funny," said Alfonso. "Where did you buy it?"</TE>
<TE>   "I made it from the bark of a birch tree," said Uncle Ruben, "and
the Indians who met the early pioneers used bark to make canoes,
hats, baskets, cups and cooking pots -- even to cover their homes.</TE>
<TE>   "Native Americans had a lot to share. They knew all about the uses
of plants for food and medicine, how to use the woods and rocks for
their tools. They respected all of nature."</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't know those things," said Alfonso. "Did they actually
eat turkey on the first Thanksgiving?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, but it was a wild turkey, not the big fat bird you buy at
the grocery store."</TE>
<TE>   "What about cranberry sauce?" asked Maria with a smile.</TE>
<TE>   "It is possible that they ate cranberry at their first
Thanksgiving. Wild cranberry will grow in even the poorest soil.
However, the cranberry that grows on the East Coast is bitter, so it
would have had to have been cooked and sweetened."</TE>
<TE>   "What about mashed potatoes?" asked Alfonso.</TE>
<TE>   "Probably not," said Uncle Ruben</TE>
<TE>   "Wow," said Maria, "thanks for sharing all that with us. This will
be our best Thanksgiving ever!"</TE>
<TE>   Friday: "How to Make a Cattail Pillow."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Shania Twain's first album in five years, "UP!," entered the national
sales chart at No. 1 on Wednesday after selling 874,000 copies last
week -- the second-highest first-week total of the year. Only
Eminem's "The Eminem Show," which sold 1.3 million in its first full
week in May, topped Twain's total.</LD>
<LD>   In "UP!," the country-pop singer includes two discs for the price
of one -- one featuring country-music arrangements of 19 new songs,
the other featuring pop arrangements of the same tunes.</LD>
<LD>   Twain's last album, "Come On Over," has sold more than 14 million
copies, the most of any album in a decade.</LD>
<TE>   Twain's collection led a parade of new Top 10 entries, including
the "Now 11" hits compilation, which finished No. 2 by selling
316,000 copies. The other Top 10 newcomers: Ja Rule's "The Last
Temptation" (237,000 copies, No. 4), Matchbox Twenty's "More Than You
Think You Are" (178,000 copies, No. 6), and rock band Audioslave's
"Audioslave" (162,000 copies, No. 7).</TE>
<TE>   George Harrison's posthumous "Brainwashed" finished No. 18 in its
first week, selling 74,000 copies.</TE>

<HD>Stylish castoffs from the casts</HD>
<DH>At It's a Wrap in Burbank, you can dress like the stars,
buying the clothes for a song that they wore for TV soaps, sitcoms
and even movies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Carpenter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>

<LD>MIKE CONNOR was laughing as he paid the checkout clerk. He'd just
spent a ridiculously low $71 for nine shirts and a sweater--one of
them Armani, two of them Hugo Boss, all of them barely, if ever,
worn.</LD>
<LD>   Connor, 33, is a regular shopper at It's a Wrap, a clothing store
in Burbank that inhabits a unique niche in the Hollywood market: It
sells secondhand wardrobe items from television shows and movies.</LD>
<LD>   "I can look really good for a tenth of the price," said Connor, a
singer and actor who goes there twice a month to find designer duds
at bargain-basement prices.</LD>
<TE>   Judging by the racks of cut-rate jackets and skirts on the
sidewalk, It's a Wrap looks like pretty much any other secondhand
clothing store from the outside.</TE>
<TE>   But step inside, and you'll see rows and rows of today's top
fashions, all of them marked with coded tags indicating from which
studio they came. Warner Bros., New Line Cinema, HBO, CBS, Disney.
The list of production houses and their programs goes on and on, from
"7th Heaven" and "General Hospital" to "Charmed" and "All My
Children."</TE>
<TE>   "We don't hide it from customers. They know what it is," said
Janet Dion, the store's founder and owner. "It's only the hot shows
that we have to be careful with."</TE>
<TE>   "Friends," for example, isn't labeled with the show's name, only
the studio. That's to prevent shoppers from reselling items on EBay
for more money. After the holidays, Dion said, she'll be selling
wardrobe from "Austin Powers," but New Line asked that she refrain
from specifying that on the tags.</TE>
<TE>   Because filming in the city is year-round, merchandise changes
constantly. But unlike in regular stores, the clothes don't always
match the season. Pawing through the racks one afternoon, shoppers
found cashmere sweaters and knit caps within arm's reach of the
miniskirts.</TE>
<TE>   "They could go to Australia and make a surfing movie, and we'll
get [the swimsuits] in February," said Dion, 66, modestly dressed
except for her rhinestone-rimmed glasses.</TE>
<TE>   Men's sizes run the gamut, but because so many female actresses
are slender and petite, women's items can run small.</TE>
<TE>   Still, larger sizes can be found -- on the racks of size 10 and 12
suits worn by talk show host Sally Jesse Raphael, for example, or
among the sweaters and jackets.</TE>
<TE>   Clothing from television shows is almost always in better
condition than clothing that comes from movies, Dion said. "TV is
just fashion shows galore. It's the films. Sometimes we can't sell
anything if it's very violent."</TE>
<TE>   If clothes come to her with bullet holes and bloodstains, she
tosses them out. That's only 10% to 15% of what she gets, however.</TE>
<TE>   Most items are either gently used or were never worn, having been
given to the studios by clothing manufacturers who want the free
publicity. With "Baywatch," Dion said, "you can't imagine the bathing
suits they had but never used. There were hundreds of them."</TE>
<TE>   All of the items Dion sells are on consignment from the studios,
and Dion takes a percentage of the sale. Still, some pieces are not
available to customers--the "Saturday Night Live" coneheads, for
example, or the iconic red swimsuit that made Pamela Anderson a star.
That's displayed in a glass case on the wall, alongside Brad Pitt's
tie from "Seven" and Mel Gibson's leather bomber jacket from "Forever
Young."</TE>
<TE>   Why? "That's a personal thing."</TE>
<TE>   Dion, who runs the shop with her daughter and son-in-law, founded
the store in 1981. "I thought if we could find a way to sell
wardrobe, it would be a nice thing because it wouldn't be yucky old
used clothes. It would be something that the middle-class girl could
buy with dignity."</TE>
<TE>   Middle-class girls like Adrienne Gee, a 28-year-old from Burbank
who was shopping with her daughter for "stuff to wear around the
house."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a mom, so I get a lot of stains and spots. I [got] this last
time I was here," she said, pulling on the strap of a sexy white tank
top. "I could go to Mervyn's and it's $8 or $10, but with this I'm
not worried about it. I paid a dollar."</TE>

<LD>Toil and trouble for the Warlocks</LD>
<LD>   In the seven weeks they were on the road, the Warlocks blew out
their transmission in Texas, sideswiped a Lexus in New York and hit a
deer in Montana, which finally totaled their van. So the Echo Park
eight-piece was relieved to pull into town Sunday , even if it was to
play the first of seven consecutive nights. According to bass player
Bobby Martine, "We've been so busy touring for so much of the last
year that we've been neglecting our hometown." Spanning everything
from space jams to make-out music to "really angry god rock," the
Warlocks will perform their swirling psychedelia at the Three of
Clubs tonight and the Smell on Saturday, supporting their new record,
"Phoenix" (Birdman).</LD>

<TE>   Punks, tune in</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-two years since they sprouted roots in Cerritos, the boys
from Channel 3 are finding out that tight, fast, old-school punk is
never out of vogue. Supporting its new release "CH3," the band plays
Friday night at the Galaxy Theatre in Santa Ana. "We're amazed that
people don't boo us off the stage for being old men," says guitarist
Mike Magrann, buoyed by the response the band got last week in New
York at CBGB's. "First time we played there was in 1981 -- and they
haven't cleaned the bathrooms since."</TE>

<TE>   Singer-songwriter Jason Falkner, working on a batch of songs for
an album next year, performs with a full band Wednesday at the
Troubadour .... Members of Sunday's Best  have decided "to disband in
order to pursue other projects," the band announced in an e-mail
Monday.</TE>

<LD>He has given everything he has for his art</LD>
<LD>   Most of those in the crowd at John Freyer's book reading had
bought something from him -- a vintage "Planet of the Apes" record, a
beat-up red chair. The 29-year-old author of "All My Life for Sale"
(Bloomsbury) had, after all, done exactly that -- sold everything he
owned.</LD>
<LD>   In a series of online auctions that began in August 2000 and ended
a year later, Freyer relieved himself of more than 600 items ranging
from the mundane (a can of soup) to the quirky (his answering-machine
tape) to the downright bizarre (a pair of used false teeth and a bag
of shaved-off sideburns). His total take: $4,906.52.</LD>
<TE>   There are more time- and cost-efficient means of ridding oneself
of materialistic possessions, but Freyer is an artist. Sure, he
wanted to get rid of some stuff; but once he did, he realized he was
also interested in finding out where that stuff was going.</TE>
<TE>   When he shipped what he sold, he also sent along notes asking that
the buyers send him pictures. When they did, he started inviting
himself over to visit.</TE>
<TE>   In his computer slide show at Book Soup recently, Freyer shared
stories and showed pictures of many of his former possessions -- and
their new owners.</TE>
<TE>   Among them was a man wearing Freyer's blue work jacket, a mother
and daughter with his saltshaker, and his girlfriend, Sasha, to whom
he sold a table and with whom he now lives in Iowa City, Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   The night ended with a live auction of a T-shirt Freyer had made.
On its front was a homemade iron-on of one of the items he'd sold: a
canned Danish ham. It went for $20.</TE>

<HD>Griffith Park: It's central to L.A.</HD>
<DH>The 4,100-acre tract is brimming with activities and, in
the middle of it all, solitude.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Rommelmann</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's 5:50 a.m., and sunlight finds Edward "Eddie" Landry sitting
alone at a picnic table beneath a canopy of oak trees along Griffith
Park Drive. Somewhere in his 60s, maybe, Landry tunes a battered
transistor radio to an AM standards station, lights a cigarette and
begins to tap a pair of drumsticks against the bench, a slightly
arrhythmic beat he will keep for the next several hours.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm trying to learn how to drum; I been coming here 15, 20 years,
every day." He wears an old red 49ers cap and the layered-jacket look
of someone who sleeps outside. "I used to live in the neighborhood,
now I live up on the mountain," he says, lifting his chin to the
west. "I have a blanket up there, go up at night and come down in the
morning." Why does he drum at this table? The retired North American
aircraft worker thinks a moment before saying, "It makes a good
sound."</LD>
<TE>   Landry is one of more than 10 million people who go to Griffith
Park each year to exercise their enthusiasms. Like to hike? Griffith
Park, situated in the eastern Santa Monica Mountains and one of the
country's largest urban park, has destinations that range from world
famous (the Hollywood sign) to scenic (an apex where one can see
downtown Los Angeles, Mt. Wilson and Catalina Island) to oddball (a
bust of James Dean with a cashew-shaped head). Need a movie location?
So did D.W. Griffith (for whom the park is not named), who filmed
parts of "Birth of a Nation" here, as did the producers of the
"Batman" TV show, who placed the mouth of the Bat Cave in Bronson
Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   Ah, Griffith Park. You drive by every day, you've been there a
thousand times. Like many of us, you tend to take it for granted.</TE>
<TE>   So, then you know what's happening at the Griffith Observatory?
They're ... renovating. Actually, all systems and elements of the
observatory will be rehabilitated to their original 1935 grandeur.
The Planetarium Theater will be completely refurbished and
reconfigured, and the observatory will be expanded to provide more
public program space, including the Leonard Nimoy Theater. While you
can't go up there until 2005, there's the Satellite -- the
"observatory in exile," where they have astronomy exhibits, a
planetarium theater (opening in 2003), and a telescope to view the
moon, stars and planets at night.</TE>
<TE>   The bridge entryway to the Los Angeles Zoo was recently demolished
to make way for the first of the zoo's six Master Plan exhibits: the
Zoo Entry Plaza, which incorporates the Children's Discovery Center,
an interactive learning center, and Sea Lion Cliffs, an outdoor
saltwater exhibit for California sea lions, where visitors can see
these native animals frolic above and below water. The zoo is also
breaking ground on Pachyderm Forest, a 4.5-acre tropical environment
for the elephants and hippos, which features an underwater
"hippoquarium."</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Water &amp; Power is donating more than $20 million
in improvements to the zoo and the park. In conjunction with the
Bureau of Engineers, it is preparing to install "solar trees"--steel
structures with canopies of solar panels and photovoltaic cells --
that collect energy, power the zoo and send the surplus to the mother
grid. The agency is also responsible for the 7th Annual DWP Light
Festival, which is, in the words of Director of Recreation and Parks
Manuel Mollinado, "one of the best light shows on the West Coast."</TE>
<TE>   Well, of course he's going to say that; he wants you to come. And
why shouldn't he? The park is gorgeous this time of year: The weather
is perfect, a perennial Indian summer; the oaks trees are changing
colors; there's a new koala at the zoo and, soon, a pair of golden
monkeys from China. And you can always catch the show near the ranger
station on Crystal Springs Drive every Sunday morning, an impromptu
drumming session where dozens of people bang out a beat on steel
drums.</TE>
<TE>   And there are all the familiar reasons to rediscover -- or
discover for the first time -- Griffith Park. Want to throw a
birthday party? Stage a charity run? See exotic animals? Visit
museums and attend concerts? Play tennis? Golf? Ride a horse? Or
maybe you just want to spend as many hours as it would take to
traverse Griffith Park's 4,107 acres in solitude, which -- against
all logic in a major city -- you can do. For despite accommodating
the masses and whatever else is visited upon it (including brush
fires, which flare up each year with the regularity of the tax man),
Griffith Park is an easy place to walk for hours on trails
overlooking the city and never see another human being.</TE>
<TE>   Though one may run into a pack of ibex, but more on that later.</TE>
<TE>   In the beginning ...</TE>
<TE>   "It must be made a place of recreation and rest for the masses, a
resort for the rank and file, for the plain people. I consider it my
obligation to make Los Angeles a happier, cleaner and finer city." So
said Col. Griffith Jenkins Griffith, for whom the park is named, when
he offered the land to the city of Los Angeles in 1896.</TE>
<TE>   Griffith was a seminal Hollywood character: His military title was
likely a sham, he was alternately lauded and vilified for the money
he made in mining and real estate and during a jealous rage he shot
his wife in a Santa Monica hotel room. In any case, the city didn't
want the land, which was referred to by one newspaper as a "rock
pile," but did covet the water rights and access to the Los Angeles
River and so accepted Griffith's largess. Fast-forward 100 years, and
a tributary statue of Griffith is erected at the corner of Riverside
Drive and Los Feliz Boulevard, the busiest of the park's nine
entrances, where today amid the sound of traffic is an anachronistic
whinnying of horses and blowing of train whistles....</TE>
<TE>   Kid stuff</TE>
<TE>   The pony ride is just past the Los Feliz entrance to the park, and
from a distance what one sees are the tops of bobbing toddlers'
heads, moving around the small corral. A different kind of ride is
next door, aboard the Griffith Park Southern Railroad, a miniature
train that wends past weathered "Western" installations (a saloon, a
native village, a plastic fawn) and, during the holidays, makes a
stop in the North Pole, where kids can alight and have their picture
taken with Santa.</TE>
<TE>   Also during the holidays (through Dec. 26, from 5 to 10 p.m.) is
the annual Department of Water and Power Light Festival, along
Crystal Springs Drive. The massive illuminated arrangements -- from a
plane taking off at LAX to Lakers players -- are hokey and gorgeous,
and cruising the half-mile route is about as winter wonderland as
L.A. gets. (Avoid peak hours, however, or the magical 20-minute ride
can turn into a
two-hours-of-merciless-traffic-was-it-worth-it-to-see-Shaq-rendered-i
n-twinkle-lights? experience.)</TE>
<TE>   The merry-go-round, built in 1926, features 68 beautifully carved
horses with jewel-encrusted bridles and a brass organ that plays more
than 1,500 selections of marches and waltz music. Another kind of
old-fashioned treat can be had at the Travel Town Museum, with its
collection of locomotives, some dating to 1864. Kids are welcome to
climb in and around the cars; parents can wander through and become
nostalgic for train travel and Hitchcock movies.</TE>
<TE>   And don't miss the inside of this museum, which features milk
wagons and antique automobiles, as well as this early 20th century
ad: "Rambler Breaks Los Angeles-San Diego Record -- Three hundred and
thirty miles in ten hours and thirty-two minutes and not a single
stop for repairs." More trains near Travel Town: another branch of
the Southern Railroad and L.A. Live Steamers, a local club devoted to
the preservation of locomotives through scale models. Rides are
offered free to the public on Sundays when the trains are running.</TE>
<TE>   This sporting life</TE>
<TE>   Any given morning finds runners of every speed huffing over the
hills of Griffith Park. On weekends, they share the road with charity
road races, such as the Jimmy Stewart Relay Marathon, Run for a Green
L.A. and the Pedigree Great L.A. Dog Walk. The park is also training
ground for more serious running groups, such as the Los Feliz Flyers
and the National AIDS Marathon Training Program, whose trainees, many
of whom start out potato-shaped but aching to help a good cause, can
be seen running in packs every Saturday; after 26 weeks, they run a
marathon.</TE>
<TE>   Those who prefer to go off-road have more than 53 miles of trails,
at elevations from 384 to 1,625 feet above sea level. There are many
well-worn fire roads to such notable places as the Hollywood sign and
the summit of Mt. Hollywood, the highest peak in the park, which
affords spectacular views of the entire Los Angeles Basin. People
whose idea of a good time is scrambling up rock-covered ridges in the
dark can check out the thrice-weekly Sierra Club-led night hikes.
These hikes, which draw up to 500 participants in summer, start at 7
p.m. and meet in the second parking lot above the merry-go-round.
They last about two hours and range in difficulty from an easy walk
on a flat, paved road (Level 1), to shinnying up crevasses and
sliding down muddy runnels butt-first (Level 6).</TE>
<TE>   Other athletic activities include 28 public tennis courts, at
three locations: Griffith-Riverside Pay Tennis and Vermont Pay
Tennis, where courts are $8 an hour, and four free first-come,
first-served courts just below the merry-go-round (whose calliope
music adds a wacky touch to play).</TE>
<TE>   There are four municipal golf courses: Harding (18-hole;
6,536-yard, par 72), where there's also a full-size driving range;
Roosevelt (nine-hole; 2,400-yard, par 33); Wilson (18-hole;
6,942-yard, par 72); and Los Feliz, a par-three course that's scruffy
and perfect for beginners. The Tregnan Golf Academy, a program run in
conjunction with the city of Los Angeles, offers golf clinics, camps
and tournaments to kids 7 to 18, regardless of ability.</TE>
<TE>   "The Plunge" is Griffith Park's public pool, open only during the
summer. John Ferraro Athletic Field is a 26-acre facility with two
soccer and rugby fields, home to umpteen local tournaments. The
Equestrian Center is open year-round and includes boarding, training,
livery and stable rentals and indoor and outdoor show arenas. Sunset
Ranch Hollywood offers day and moonlight rides through the park. And
armchair explorers can turn on their computers and take a virtual
geologic field trip through Griffith Park or see a satellite photo of
the Hollywood sign from space.</TE>
<TE>   This land is their land</TE>
<TE>   While Griffith Park is truly an egalitarian environment, its roads
and paths shared with equanimity by joggers, equestrians, cyclists
and golf carts, it is also a wild place, home to red-tailed hawks,
turkey vultures, coyotes, opossums, lizards and rattlesnakes. Deer
are so comfortable nibbling grass along the roadside that they barely
look up when motorists pass. There's a bird sanctuary in a wooded
canyon with a small stream on Vermont Canyon Road, and a pair of
golden eagles has been spotted (by yours truly) perched on an
eye-level fence on parkland abutting the L.A. River.</TE>
<TE>   The aforementioned band of ibex is less habituated. Eight of these
mountain goats native to Asia Minor arrived at the Los Angeles Zoo in
1984 -- and jumped a fence shortly thereafter. Perfectly suited to
life in a rocky tableau, the ibex are presumed to still live in the
park, with one reportedly spotted as recently as last year.</TE>
<TE>   Other forms of wildlife include the gazillion picnickers-birthday
partyers who pack the park on weekends and holidays. There are public
barbecues, tables and, sometimes, playground equipment in many of the
zoo's five picnic areas, the nicest perhaps being the Old Zoo Picnic
Area, which features obsolete animal cages from the park's old zoo.</TE>
<TE>   Other scenes, also thrive in certain areas of the park.
Early-morning joggers and other visitors should be wary lest they
stumble upon lovers in tryst along Vermont Canyon as well as in cars
pulled along the shoulder beneath the overpasses where the 5 and 134
freeways meet.</TE>
<TE>   "The [park] rangers do run into situations, people drinking up in
the hills at night, but overall, the park is safe," says Mollinado.
"The biggest complaints we have are traffic congestion and finding a
picnic table on the weekends. And yes, there are different pockets in
the park where you have sexual activity; there seem to be different
areas for homosexual and heterosexual activity, and it's not the kind
of experience you want people running into when they visit the park,
but we have 4,200 acres, so, that's a lot of area to keep watch
over."</TE>
<TE>   The greater scope</TE>
<TE>   The 6,162-seat outdoor Greek Theatre plays host from May through
October to every sort of musical act, from rock and R&amp;B to Ukrainian
song-and-dance troops. The acoustics are such that the music washes
downhill and over Los Feliz, so that early slumbering residents hear
Neil Young or the Go-Gos in their dreams.</TE>
<TE>   The Griffith Observatory, arguably the most dramatic location in
Los Angeles, isclosed for renovations until 2005, though a modest
display of astronomy exhibits, called the Griffith Observatory
Satellite, is on display elsewhere in the park. From certain vantage
points and on foot, one can still see the observatory's magnificent
view of the millions of lights along the avenues, gem necklaces that
stretch for miles and then drop into the sea.</TE>
<TE>   What one cannot, unfortunately, get near (because the area under
construction is hard-hat only) is the stun-one-into-silence
Astronomers Monument, a 37-foot-high statue depicting Copernicus,
Hipparchus, Galileo, Kepler, Newton and Herschel and, balanced atop
their wise and massive heads, an armillary sphere meant to represent
the universe. There are few pleasures as exhilarating as running
through the grass surrounding the monument on a dark, windy night.</TE>
<TE>   Gene Autry has gotten a lot of play lately as the late owner of
the World Series champion Anaheim Angels. The singing cowboy should
also get props for the Autry Museum of Western Heritage, which, aside
from preserving cowboy and Indian art and artifacts, hosts Western
exhibits from jaunty and unusual angles, such as the current show,
"Jewish Life in the American West," and last year's "How the West Was
Worn," which featured a stunning array of Western wear, from
intricately beaded buckskins to rhinestone suits.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Zoo earlier this month introduced its newest
acquisition, a koala from Australia, named Baz by one of the zoo's
trustees, in honor of the Australian film director Baz Luhrmann.
Other news at the zoo includes half a dozen new exhibits breaking
ground, from a tropical forest for the pachyderms to an outdoor
saltwater exhibit for sea lions. One zoo attraction that cannot be
seen but that has a positive effect on the park and beyond is the
riverine transition zone surrounding the zoo's parking lot. This
channel, replete with native California plants, collects rainwater,
filters it and delivers it back to the L.A. River. More eco-news from
the zoo parking lot: The Bureau of Engineers and the DWP are
preparing to install tree-shaped solar panels that collect energy and
send it back to the DWP mother grid.</TE>
<TE>   It's sunset, and at the far end of the zoo parking lot, Phil Young
holds a Highland bagpipe, an enormous instrument with several
bladders. "I come out here and blow the pipes a few times a week,"
says Young, an animator for Disney who plays with a pipe and drum
outfit called Sons of the Desert. A few cyclists stop and wait for
him to begin. Do passersby often watch him play? "Yes -- but it's not
only me. There are other bagpipers known to play here. We come to the
zoo parking lot because it's away from residential areas -- and far
enough away so we don't give the animals heart attacks."</TE>
<TE>   With that, he begins a Scottish ballad called "Victoria Harbor."
The sound is as heavy as a bag of blood, steadfast and exultant.
Then, the sound is forced into harmony with another; there is an
evangelist standing on a spit of median, eyes closed, holding a Bible
overhead and preaching in Korean to cars entering the 5. Both sounds
-- utterly dissimilar and yet not at odds -- rise together into the
mountains.</TE>

<HD>New England on the half shell</HD>
<DH>Seafood is the specialty at Menemsha, though it hasn't
quite found its sea legs yet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Entrepreneur Brad Johnson has had a hand, as partner, in the Sunset
Room, Roxbury and the late Georgia -- all venues more notable for
their star-struck youthful patrons than for anything the kitchen put
out. But the New York native has been working up to opening his own
place for a while now. Just what does he have in mind?</LD>
<LD>   A few weeks ago, Johnson launched Menemsha. The sprawling
restaurant, on Washington Boulevard near Abbot Kinney Boulevard in
Venice, is named for the tiny fishing port on Martha's Vineyard where
Johnson spent summers as a kid. Menemsha is famous for its sunsets
and the superb lobsters, clams and fish the boats haul in from cold
Atlantic waters there.</LD>
<LD>   With its wood-lined bar and nautical lights, Menemsha the
restaurant has a vaguely New England look. Upfront is a raw seafood
bar (not yet open on the evening I visited). The main room features a
fireplace framed in gray stone and a lobster tank of modest
proportions (just bubbles, no crustaceans hanging out that night).
The place also has a sleek outdoor patio, which is where I'm going to
ask to be seated next time. That may be the only choice if you plan
on any conversation over dinner: inside, the noise from an exuberant
weekend crowd is deafening.</LD>
<TE>   Read off a few of the items on the moderately priced menu to
homesick New Englanders. I'll bet they head for Menemsha that night
in pursuit of cherrystone clams on the half shell, steamers, lobster
rolls, stuffed quahogs and New Bedford cod cakes.</TE>
<TE>   Main courses include oven-baked bluefish and Maine lobster bake,
and also simply grilled or broiled fish for the minimalist crowd. But
it's not all fish. You can also get a Yankee pot roast or a grilled
rib-eye steak. Blue plate specials include New England boil
(Wednesday), Cabernet braised lamb shank (Thursday), prime rib with
steak fries (Friday) and, on Sunday, country buttermilk-fried
chicken.</TE>
<TE>   I suspect the raw shellfish, ordered by the dozen or as part of an
elaborate tiered seafood platter, will be the big draw here.
Menemsha's clam and oyster shuckers will have to get up to speed,
though. Our order seemed to take forever, and service wasn't much
faster for any of the other items we ordered. The staff was so
overwhelmed on a busy weekend night we even had trouble getting bread
-- anything to stave off hunger after a long day. Hopefully, they'll
get their sea legs soon, before the crowd gets tired of waiting and
moves on to the next new thing.</TE>

p.m. on Friday and Saturday nights). Full bar. Valet parking.</TE>

<TE>   Also in Hollywood and Pasadena. $8.</TE>
<TE>   What do you drink with a delicate tray of sushi? Is beer too
heavy? Wine too complex? In the bar at Sushi Roku there's an
alternative that's as light and cool as a spring zephyr. It's called
"The Fusion," and its mix of soju, vanilla Stoli and sake, infused
with pineapple and watermelon, is served on the rocks or straight up.
Although it sounds like a fruit salad, it tastes more like cucumber
juice, but with a definite kick that will stand up to the fire of
that spicy tuna roll.</TE>

<LD>The architect who heads the firm Morphosis is one of the founders of
the Southern California Institute of Architecture. He co-wrote "L.A.
Now, Volume Two: Shaping a New Vision for Downtown Los Angeles: Seven
Proposals." His vision for the weekend is family gardening.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Soft landing</LD>
<TE>   I have a really chaotic life. I'm on a plane every week in various
parts of the U.S. and Europe, and I'm working in Korea, Taipei and
Japan. And then we travel. That's our passion.</TE>
<TE>   For our family, that's been our connecting tissue with my two
boys. So, when I get home, I just want simplicity, stability and
routine. Just walking our dog, Isis, going to get a cup of coffee and
looking for heirloom tomatoes at the Santa Monica Farmers Market.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chores</TE>
<TE>   We have a house that I have been working on for the last 10 years.
I just kind of muck around in the garden, flipping, cutting, pruning
and watering.</TE>
<TE>   I've found if you live an upper-middle-class life in the U.S.,
especially in L.A. maybe, the children don't do anything. I came from
a Midwest background. I spent my summers on my grandmother's farm and
you work since you're 6 years old.</TE>
<TE>   So, I have very consciously kept certain things that I don't want
to have serviced like gardening, so that they can work with me. When
I wake my son up at 1 p.m. we're going to do some work on the bamboo.
It's a combination of a family ethic with my kids and my own
enjoyment of working in the garden.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Salmon with strawberries</TE>
<TE>   8:30 on a Saturday night will usually find us at Table in Venice,
a new restaurant opened by David Wolfe of 2424 Pico fame.</TE>
<TE>   The place is funky and laid back, very '70s Venice. You bring the
wine. But the food is sophisticated, quality ingredients, very clean,
while imaginative. One night, our wild salmon was served with a salsa
containing fresh strawberries, delicious. Surfer son Cooper often
accompanies us on this one as he's an adventurous eater and loves
David's cooking.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Books about buildings</TE>
<TE>   I must plug Form Zero in downtown, a place I admire and support.
It's not just a great architectural bookstore, but an institution.
They moved there about six months ago and they have shows and a
lecture series.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Breathe deeply</TE>
<TE>   I had real severe back problems about 10 years ago. I couldn't
bend over to put my own shoes on. I went to all kinds of specialists,
and it's amazing, they can't really do that much for you. So my wife,
Blythe, got me going to yoga. Just about without fail we go to our
yoga studio on Main Street in Santa Monica for a 1 1/2-hour yoga
class with Saul David Raye at least three times a week. My back
problems have gone away. But I'm not at all into yoga as a spiritual
thing.</TE>

recording for a few major-market concerts this week, including one
Friday at the Palladium. The quartet is working on a new album that
will consist of four parts, each overseen by separate producers. The
band has a strong work ethic: The recording and touring comes on the
heels of last month's release of its "Vale Callampa" EP, a four-song
tribute to Chile's celebrated but recently disbanded Los Tres.</LD>

<TE>   Heartfelt escape</TE>
<TE>   For most of the 20th century in Australia, half-caste Aboriginal
girls were ripped from their families and sent to work as domestic
servants. "Rabbit-Proof Fence," based on Doris Pilkington's book,
tells the story of three girls who make a daring escape and cross the
continent in an attempt to return to the outback. Kenneth Branagh
co-stars. Directed by Phillip Noyce.</TE>

<TE>   Miguel Harth-Bedoya returns this week to lead the Los Angeles
Philharmonic in colorful music by Vivaldi and Respighi. In "The Four
Seasons," four soloists from the orchestra are featured in Vivaldi's
most familiar set of concertos. Respighi's "Fountains of Rome" and
"Roman Festivals" complete the program. On opening night, the Casual
Fridays format is without intermission, and "Fountains" will not be
played.</TE>

<TE>   THEATER</TE>
<TE>   A soldier's true story</TE>
<TE>   Opera noir, indeed. "Woyzeck," director and visual designer Robert
Wilson's striking collaboration with songwriters Tom Waits and
Kathleen Brennan, was originally written by playwright Georg Buechner
in the 1800s. It's based on the true story of a soldier who went mad
and murdered his girlfriend in Leipzig, Germany. Waits describes his
music as "scary, horror, lullabies, Weill-ish theatrical, chanson,
vaudeville distorted, parlor songs, broken-mirror music." If Waits'
theatrical work, "The Black Rider," is any indication, it should be
as towering as a storm cloud.</TE>
<TE>   "Woyzeck," Freud Playhouse, 405 Hilgard Ave., Westwood. Opens
Tuesday, 8 p.m. Runs Tuesday-Saturday, 8 p.m.; Sunday, 7 p.m.; ends
Dec. 15. $70; opening night, $60. (310) 825-2101.</TE>

<TE>   Singing  the blues</TE>
<TE>   Singer Barbara Morrison loves the blues, and jazz audiences love
her. She's drawn favorable comparisons to such divas as Dinah
Washington, Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan and Etta James, among
others. Morrison invests her singing with a joie de vivre that is
infectious. On Friday, she returns to one of her long-standing gigs
and her most familiar crowds as she takes up the mike at Loews on the
beach in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Morrison &amp; the Daniel May Trio, Loews Santa Monica Beach

<TE>   Will Gwen Stefani and her No Doubt mates flash their recently
bestowed keys to the city of Anaheim at the final Southland stops on
their tour? Find out Friday in Long Beach and Saturday at the
Arrowhead Pond as they give hometown fans two more chances to revel
in their varied punk-ska-rock-pop music. If Stefani hadn't already
established this tour as the leader in tough-but-beautiful
female-fronted rock bands, opening the show with Garbage's Shirley
Manson and the Distillers' Brody Armstrong would make the bill seem
like an onstage confab that blows away all the stereotypes. With New
Found Glory also on the bill, it might be a night thin on timeless
anthems or deep emotional connection, but it's sure to be full of
raw, fast, sweaty rock distraction.</TE>
<TE>   No Doubt with Garbage, the Distillers, Long Beach Arena, 300 E.

<LD>   More visits with 'Mark Twain'</LD>
<LD>   It might stand to reason that a 47-year-old one-man show could be
littered with redundancy, if not be as stale as cardboard.
Fortunately, Hal Holbrook has committed so many hours of material to
memory that his venerable "Mark Twain Tonight!" performances remain
deftly topical and incisive, full of the irascible humorist's similes
and still-cogent political insight.</LD>
<TE>   Hal Holbrook in "Mark Twain Tonight!" Saturday, 8 p.m.: Thousand
Oaks Civic Arts Plaza, Kavli Theatre, 2100 E. Thousand Oaks Blvd. $32
to $47. (805) 449-ARTS. Wednesday and Dec. 5, 8 p.m.: Lobero Theatre,
33 E. Canon Perdido St., Santa Barbara. $40 and $50, (805) 963-0761.</TE>

<KH>MUSIC REVIEW</KH>
<HD>For Coleman, it's all about the tunes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was barely a pause in the opening set by Steve Coleman's Five
Elements at Rocco's Tuesday night. Yet the 90-plus-minute performance
unfolded with a seemingly unending parade of fascinating music.</LD>
<LD>   Did it matter that it was unfamiliar, that Coleman elected to say
nothing about any of the music, that some of the pieces were filled
with offbeat rhythms and thorny melodies? Not at all. And it is to
Coleman's credit that he possesses the invention and imagination to
justify his determination to have the music speak for itself.</LD>
<LD>   Over the course of the set, the majority of solo passages were
taken by the saxophonist, still a relatively low-visibility figure,
despite the extraordinary work he has produced in the nearly two
decades since he founded Manhattan's avant-garde M-Base Collective.
And that's a bit hard to understand, since he plays with a
consistently warm and engaging sound, even in his fast-fingered,
horn-scouring runs. And the presence of a subtle seasoning of Chicago
blues elements -- both in his playing and in occasional groove-driven
compositions -- makes his music all the more accessible.</LD>
<TE>   Coleman was joined in the front line by trumpeter Jonathan
Finlayson, who added his own often fiery excursions, sometimes via
countering lines, at other times combining with Coleman in sudden
rushes of furious, two-horn explosiveness. Supporting everything,
generating galvanizing rhythms that shifted unexpectedly from quiet
tranquillity to hard-edged funk to disjunct Eastern rhythms, drummer
Sean Rickman and bassist Rich Brown kept the music's lifeblood
flowing.</TE>
<TE>   For the packed house Coleman's band's performance seemed to be a
powerful experience, generating intense physical movements and
enthusiastic cheers. That's not what one usually experiences at
cutting-edge jazz programs, suggesting that Coleman, by making the
music his primary concern, may be taking a path other artists would
do well to consider following. Unfortunately, he was only booked for
one more night at Rocco's. Surely it's time for a full-week run by
this extraordinary artist.</TE>

<HD>Drowning art's voice in an ocean of chatter</HD>
<DH>Openings are occupational hazards for critics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Pagel</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I had been teaching all day and was in no mood for chitchat. As I
drove toward the gallery near Venice Beach, a selfish fantasy filled
my head: I was alone in a brightly lighted room filled with new
paintings.</LD>
<LD>   My fantasy shattered as I turned a corner and pulled into a line
of cars waiting for valet parking. The opening-night crowd spilled
out of the gallery's entrance, filled its courtyard and spread across
the sidewalk.</LD>
<LD>   More visitors were visible through a big window on the stairway to
the second floor, gripping their plastic-cup cocktails like NFL
running backs determined not to fumble.</LD>
<TE>   I felt like punting, but I set my jaw and carried on.</TE>
<TE>   You might wonder why I even tried. Art openings aren't about the
art. In the popular imagination, they are glamorous affairs,
exclusive soirees where stylish sophisticates rub shoulders with
artists from the fringe.</TE>
<TE>   In truth, they're mundane occasions. Imagine a year-end office
party held every month and you'll get the idea. Anyone can go; just
read the newspaper listings or pick up an announcement at a gallery's
front desk.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to look at art during an opening is a lot like watching a
movie with a theater full of people who have no qualms about nudging
your shoulder and pushing a bag of popcorn in your face.</TE>
<TE>   For art critics like me, openings are occupational hazards.
Sometimes a deadline or a social reason or shameless curiosity draws
me in. Or maybe I'm so eager to see a new body of work that putting
up with the crowd is a small price to pay.</TE>
<TE>   But you have to be in the right mood.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, all the conditions applied except the last one. I decided
I'd take a peek at each painting, say some hellos and come back in a
few days for a longer look.</TE>
<TE>   At every turn, I was reminded why not to go to an opening.</TE>
<TE>   As I entered the courtyard, I heard my name. I didn't waver. I
figured that the noisy party would let me pretend I hadn't heard
anything.</TE>
<TE>   But a hand touched my elbow. It was the artist's mother, a
gracious woman whose homemade treats I often ate at her son's studio.
We exchanged friendly greetings. When we parted, I felt creepy for
having tried to avoid her -- like a Hollywood wannabe whose eyes
never stop scanning the room for someone more powerful to talk to.</TE>
<TE>   Two steps inside the front door and my guilt diminished. Ambushed
again, this time by an overeager inquisitor whose well-practiced
air-kisses didn't prevent her from getting right to the point. "Isn't
this amazing?" she exclaimed in a way that turned the question into
an assertion that wasn't worth arguing over.</TE>
<TE>   I wanted to say, "I have no idea. I can't see a wall, much less a
painting hanging on it. And you should know that, since you're
blocking my path like a security guard bucking for promotion."</TE>
<TE>   But I erred on the side of politeness. I said I'd be right back
after taking a look for myself. We both knew I was lying.</TE>
<TE>   I managed to get a glimpse of each painting. But I spent more time
looking at the backs of heads and shoulders. It's hard to focus on
art when people are stepping on your toes.</TE>
<TE>   I didn't have a calm moment until I was at the curb, waiting for
my car.</TE>
<TE>   A few days later I was back, and my fantasy was much closer to
coming true. I stood and scanned the installation; swooped in for
close-ups; and, walking back and forth between works, compared and
contrasted. Listening to the pictures converse with themselves, I
heard the rhythms of their shouts, whispers and silences.</TE>
<TE>   When looking at art, solitude isn't absolutely necessary, but it
sure sweetens the experience.</TE>

<HD>Rosey reveals true hues</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Hochman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Dirty Child," the recent debut album by singer-songwriter Rosey,
casts her as a hybrid of Fiona Apple and Macy Gray, with perhaps a
bit of Alanis Morissette tossed in. The album was even produced by
Gray's collaborator, Darryl Swann, who pumped its aura with layers of
urban grit and hipster sass.</LD>
<LD>   But when Rosey stripped off those layers for an acoustic
performance at the AlterKnit Lounge on Tuesday, it was clear just how
miscalculated the album's approach was. Though her singing shares
some qualities with both Apple's and Gray's, she's an ill fit in
their sonic clothing. In her own wardrobe, though, she's a real find.</LD>
<LD>   Casual and earthy, the New York-raised L.A. resident opened the
hourlong set with the luscious Harry Warren-Mack Gordon standard "At
Last," showing off a honey-and-sand voice that's the rare combination
of power and character. It was a perfect compass for the set.
Accompanied just by guitarist Josh Lopez (and occasionally her own
six-string), she mixed in a few more jazz-pop oldies, but also showed
a classic orientation in much of her own material.</LD>
<TE>   A lot of her thematic content, though, is very much of today. She
does name names (one song Tuesday included an unflattering reference
to Maverick Records executive Guy Oseary) and lyrically bares, well,
everything. Ultimately the show suggested that the best setting for
her might be fronting a small combo. But the presentation here,
unlike the album, allowed her to be really Rosey.</TE>

<HD>As a series, dinosaur drama is worthy of extinction</HD>
<DH>Unlike last season's miniseries, this 'Dinotopia' offers
few thrills.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<LD>It's no wonder that ABC took so long getting its new "Dinotopia"
series on the air. Watching it is dinotorture, especially compared
with the fun of last season's "Dinotopia" the miniseries, from which
this low-action drama was spun.</LD>
<LD>   The weekly series has a different cast and a drag of a
double-sized premiere that creeps forward laboriously for two hours.
By the time those lumbering carnivores, the Tyrannosaurus rexes,
advance en masse on the Dinotopian capital of Waterfall City, you may
be fleeing along with the residents.</LD>
<LD>   This is really bad, from low-tech special effects to an opening
script that could have been written by one of the show's own
theropods.</LD>
<TE>   The inspiration here is the art and juvenile books of James
Gurney, the setting a utopian paradise where veggie-eating humans and
animals co-exist benevolently. It's on this lost continent that
teenage Scott brothers Karl (Erik von Detten) and David (Shiloh
Strong) were stranded after the plane carrying them and their dad,
Frank (Michael Brandon), crashed into the Caribbean. Now Frank, too,
is a castaway and antsy to leave.</TE>
<TE>   He is also more than a little thick. This is not cerebral Patrick
McGoohan hatching ingenious escape plans in "The Prisoner." You know
immediately that Frank's cockamamie attempt to get off the island
will sink. Why doesn't he?</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Le Sage (Lisa Zane) and her fellow renegades are up to
no good, and Dinotopia's protective sunstones are mysteriously on the
fritz, making it vulnerable to attack by the T. rexes.</TE>
<TE>   But forget suspense. Although the T. rexes snack on a few humans,
it's obvious that the Scotts will survive, along with Dinotopia's
leader-in-training, Marion (Georgina Rylance) and her parents, Mayor
Waldo (Jonathan Hyde) and Rosemary (Sophie Ward).</TE>
<TE>   A rule of thumb here: If it roars and has tiny front legs and long
sharp teeth, it's trouble. But enough about the producers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Dinotopia"</TE>
<TE>   "Dinotopia" will be shown at 8 p.m. Thursdays on ABC. The network
has rated it TV-PG (may be unsuitable for young children).</TE>

<HD>With their fingers on the club pulse</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Kastle Waserman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nightclubbing may be for the young and young at heart, but in the age
of quick-edit trends and ever-changing music tastes, what kind of
club really draws the 18- to 25-year-olds? For almost 20 years,
Michael Stewart and Bruce Perdew have run clubs catering to young
alternative crowds. They have kept a hold on the 18-plus cohort with
cutting-edge entertainment that incorporates music, visuals and
offbeat fashions.</LD>
<LD>   Moving from Scream club in the mid-'80s to the Gothic industrial
club Helter Skelter through the '90s, their "Evil Club Empire," as
they call it, now spans nearly every night of the week with
Perversion (Thursdays at the Ruby), Clockwork Orange (Fridays at the
Ruby), Dungeon (Saturdays at Blue), Blue Mondays (Mondays at Blue)
and Velvet (Sundays at 7969).</LD>
<LD>   Here's their take on what the youthful crowd thrives on:</LD>
<TE>   Question: Your core crowd is 18 to 20. What attracts them?</TE>
<TE>   Stewart: The music we play is more cutting edge.</TE>
<TE>   Q: But most of the music is from the '80s.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart: In the '90s all you had was hip-hop and grunge, and those
didn't really fit for kids who wanted to dance. The '80s stuck around
because that music is more alternative dance stuff. You can still
play Siouxsie, and people still like it.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You've got a lot of Goth going. Define that today.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart: In the beginning it was death rock and punk rock and glam
rock. Now Goth is just a term; it's a catchall. I think it's more of
a look that people go for.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Dungeon, your fetish club, is open to young clubgoers. Does
that concern you?</TE>
<TE>   Perdew:  Our shows don't show any nudity; it's more of an
exhibition. We keep a close eye on that show. We have someone there
who monitors the show and doesn't let anything get out of control.
It's just a performance, just entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What's the life span of a club?</TE>
<TE>   Perdew: The life span's usually about six months to a year,
sometimes two years, then they go on to other things.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart: It's a weird process. You go to a club, you make it your
own, you enjoy it, but eventually, no matter how much fun you're
having, after a year or two you feel you need to move on to something
new.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Why do you cater to young crowds?</TE>
<TE>   Stewart: I just think that's the age people go to clubs the most
in their lifetime. People start changing between 25 and 30. When you
get in your 30s, you start going to restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Perdew: Older crowds usually only go out once or twice a week, as
opposed to the younger crowd going out four or five nights a week.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How do you stay in touch with the youth culture?</TE>
<TE>   Stewart: I still like the music and the fashion. I think we relate
to the crowd because that's what we like, and they like what we do.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What makes a good DJ?</TE>
<TE>   Perdew: A lot get into DJing because they want to play music, but
they're not really playing music for the crowd, they're playing it
for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart: They have to pay attention to what's going on. There's
been a big movement in the last few years that everyone has to mix
and be real technical. That's great, but if you're just mixing a
bunch of songs that aren't popular or fun, the crowd isn't going to
dance. I think it's more of an ability to read a dance floor.</TE>

<HD>A hobby that rocks</HD>
<DH>Those who collect stones dig -- and create -- local
treasures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Brenda Rees</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Emma Mayer's two young sons recently traded in their Pokemon cards
for a new collection that's stashed in egg cartons, pushpin
containers and assorted boxes scattered around the house. "They just
love collecting rocks," says Mayer, who lives in Ventura. "They like
being outdoors, getting really dirty and coming home with 'cool
stuff.' "</LD>
<LD>   In Southern California, rock hunting can be a family hobby that is
cheap, fun and educational. Local beaches, mountains and especially
deserts are prime locales for rocks, minerals and the occasional
fossil.</LD>
<LD>   Materials are simple: a good shovel and bucket -- maybe a pick
hammer, map or guidebook. Probably the biggest expense for rock
hunting is gasoline for getting to and from remote destinations.</LD>
<TE>   "Southern California is quite a good area for gemstones,
especially in San Diego County," says Tony Kampf, curator of mineral
sciences at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. "I
recommend that the best way to find these places is for people to
join a rock club, since there are so many limitations and
restrictions on where you can go nowadays."</TE>
<TE>   Overall, says Kampf, there are two types of rock collectors:
"those who self-collect and those that find specimens at [rock]
shows. Most collectors, however, are a little bit of both."</TE>
<TE>   Rock collecting seems to be instinctive for kids. As long as she
can remember, 14-year-old Cathy O'Campo has been picking up rocks.
"Whenever my mom and dad took me places, I would always bring home
rocks," says the Anaheim resident.</TE>
<TE>   O'Campo recently joined the Searchers Gem and Mineral Society and
attends monthly field trips, accompanied by her parents. "It's fun to
go to new places and look for rocks," she says. "Our last trip was at
Clear Creek [near Coalinga], and I was looking for serpentine, jade
and black-green garnet."</TE>
<TE>   At weekly club meetings, O'Campo gets the opportunity to transform
her rock and gem findings into jewelry. She's learning wire wrapping,
polishing and even the art of the silversmith from a 92-year-old
member.</TE>
<TE>   "I also write a column in our monthly newsletter," she adds. "This
time, I'm writing about birthstones."</TE>
<TE>   The club offers other Rocking Kid activities, such as visits to
local museums, archeological sites and additional field trips to view
private collections. At the Ventura Gem and Mineral Club, Mayer
organizes children's weekly meetings for the Pebble Pups. Adult
members usually bring in samples of their collections and talk about
different aspects of the hobby.</TE>
<TE>   "We also have a hands-on activity with the kids," adds Mayer.
"It's fun to see adults sharing their hobby with the little ones."</TE>

<LD>Spitfire Grill: Three hard-luck women heal their broken spirits after
they're thrown together running a small-town diner. It's a simple
premise for an upbeat script. But "The Spitfire Grill" was developed
in two directions -- the 1996 film by Lee David Zlotoff, and a more
sentimental and sunnier 2000 musical by composer James Val and
lyricist Fred Alley. The musical is making its first West Coast
appearance in a superb staging by Nick DeGruccio. Despite the
artifice inherent in the musical format -- contrasted with the
grittier surface reality of the movie -- it's the stage version that
emerges as the more coherent and convincing of the two.</LD>

<LD>"Yule Be Wiggling"</LD>
<LD>   HIT Entertainment</LD>
<LD>   DVD: $16.99; ages 2 to 6</LD>
<TE>   An irresistible dance-along video from the Wiggles, the hit
children's quartet from Down Under. Greg, Murray, Jeff and Anthony
and their zany pals make spirits bright with effervescent pop-style
original and traditional songs, comic banter and colorful visuals.
Even adults may be moved to work off those extra holiday calories.</TE>

<TE>   Elmo learns about Kwanzaa, Hanukkah and Christmas traditions, and
celebrates the holiday with his goldfish friend Dorothy in this first
"Elmo's World" holiday special. The comic highlight: Prairie Dawn
directs a problem-fraught Muppet Christmas Pageant.</TE>

<TE>   Scholastic/West Woods New Video</TE>
<TE>   DVD: $14.95; ages 2 to 8</TE>
<TE>   Holiday gold from Weston Woods' rich video library of children's
literature, new on DVD, is brought to the screen by fine animators,
composers and often the authors and illustrators themselves. In
addition to the Clement Clarke Moore classic poem, this charming
stocking stuffer includes stories by Rosemary Wells, Jane Yolen,
Tomie DePaola and Gary Soto.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your Tiny Noel</TE>
<TE>   Warner Home Video</TE>
<TE>   VHS: $12.95; ages 3 months to 3 years</TE>
<TE>   Live-action scenes of toddlers in holiday frolics are the best
thing about this baby-centric video that shows how Christmas is
celebrated in different countries. The charm doesn't extend to the
unattractive Muppet-style puppets, including the video's tour guide,
Murray the Monkey, whose vacant-eyed stare is creepy.</TE>

<HD>An edgy, epic collaboration</HD>
<DH>Director Akira Kurosawa and Toshiro Mifune made 16 films
together; 13 will be screening at the Nuart.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AKIRA Kurosawa and Toshiro Mifune were arguably the greatest
director-star team in the history of the movies. Between 1948 and
1965, they made 16 films that put Japanese cinema on the
international map, and established Kurosawa as an all-time great
filmmaker and Mifune as Japan's greatest international star, never
equaled to this day. The Nuart will present fresh 35-millimeter
prints of a dozen of their films Friday through Dec. 12; then, a new
35-millimeter print of "Seven Samurai" (1954) with newly translated
English subtitles will screen Dec. 13-19.</LD>
<LD>   Both Kurosawa and Mifune were men of impressive dignity and
presence. At over 6 feet tall, Kurosawa was a commanding figure,
sometimes distant, sometimes affable, but always cordial. Mifune was
a warm man, direct, unpretentious and thoughtful. Both were capable
of considerable humor, and both had some understanding of English but
preferred to rely on an interpreter. Film historian Audie Bock served
Kurosawa well in many instances in this capacity, while actress Miiko
Taka, Marlon Brando's co-star in "Sayonara," translated for him
frequently over the years.</LD>
<TE>   Hideko Takamine, for decades one of Japanese cinema's top stars,
urged Kurosawa to look in on an audition one day in June 1946. He
came upon Mifune, a war veteran desperate for any work at the studio,
expressing "anger" for the judges by behaving like a wounded or
trapped animal. Sensing that the jury was more offended than
impressed, Kurosawa intervened, and the rest was history.</TE>
<TE>   Kurosawa recalled that he had "stopped dead in amazement" at his
first encounter with Mifune, an instinctive actor of vivid
imagination. Once they started working together, Kurosawa feared he
could not control his new star but also did not want to "smother his
vitality."</TE>
<TE>   Such creative tension between director and star resulted in an
array of indelible performances in a string of memorable films, a
number of which have become classics. In what is regarded as the
first major accomplishment of both men, "Drunken Angel" (1948)
presented Mifune as a wickedly handsome but tubercular gangster in a
corrupt postwar Tokyo. They followed this with the ambitious "Stray
Dog" (1949), in which Mifune's young police detective can regain his
manhood only by scouring a war-ravaged Tokyo in a determined attempt
to retrieve his stolen gun.</TE>
<TE>   As the almost comically ferocious bandit in the feudal-era
"Rashomon" (1950), Mifune attacks a highborn lady (Machiko Kyo) and
her husband (Masayuki Mori) as they travel through a forest. Mifune
was so strong a presence that he was not overwhelmed by Kurosawa's
boldly innovative style. The film became a classic that took the top
prize at Venice in 1951 and opened Japanese cinema to the West.</TE>
<TE>   Mifune's range was such that he could play the Macbeth character
in "Throne of Blood" (1957) or an elderly man transfixed by the
possibility of nuclear warfare in Kurosawa's "I Live in Fear" (1955).</TE>
<TE>   For many audiences, particularly in the West, Mifune became the
definitive screen samurai in the films of many important directors,
but it was as the shrewd, scruffy and humorous ronin (masterless
samurai) in Kurosawa's "Yojimbo" (1961) and its sequel, "Sanjuro"
(1962), that he established himself abroad as the John Wayne of
Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Sergio Leone shamelessly stole the plot of "Yojimbo," in which
Mifune pitted rival gangs against each other as they disrupted a
small town, for his landmark spaghetti western "A Fistful of
Dollars," which lifted Clint Eastwood from TV series renown to
international big-screen stardom. George Lucas has acknowledged that
the exuberant Kurosawa-Mifune swordplay adventure "Hidden Fortress"
(1958) was a key inspiration for "Star Wars."</TE>
<TE>   The culmination of Kurosawa and Mifune's swordplay pictures is the
sublime "Seven Samurai" (1954), one of the greatest of screen epics,
in which Mifune played the key figure among seven ronin hired by a
small village to ward off attacks by bandits. While the film is
famous for Kurosawa's dynamic use of the zoom lens, what lingers is
the deep bond that grew between the ronin and the villagers.</TE>
<TE>   Although Mifune will be always be best remembered as the samurai,
he was equally outstanding in two stunning black-and-white Kurosawa
contemporary dramas of the '60s, "The Bad Sleep Well" (1960), playing
an idealistic businessman bent on exposing top-level corporate
corruption, and "High and Low" (1963), in which he is a shoe
manufacturer facing the moral dilemma of being asked to ransom his
chauffeur's small son, who the kidnapper had mistaken for his own.</TE>
<TE>   By the mid-'60s, Mifune had grown increasingly frustrated with
being a world-famous star who wasn't getting the compensation of his
Hollywood counterparts, and with the seemingly interminable and
arduous shooting of "Red Beard" (1965), in which he played an
aristocratic 19th century doctor who has devoted his life to serving
the poor at his rural clinic.</TE>
<TE>   This led to a break with Kurosawa that Mifune initially insisted
was temporary, but eventually dismissed with bitterness when it
looked to become permanent.</TE>
<TE>   Both star and director suffered from the rupture.</TE>
<TE>   Mifune continued working almost until he died in 1997, at 77, but
rarely in projects worthy of him. Kurosawa, who died in 1998 at 88,
fared considerably better. After faltering in the '70s, he regained
his footing in the '80s with "Kagemusha," a complex and glorious
feudal epic with breathtaking battle scenes, and with "Ran," an
equally dazzling reworking of "King Lear." Even though both starred
the accomplished and commanding Tatsuya Nakadai, it was impossible to
watch these two films without envisioning the more leonine and virile
Mifune up there on the screen.</TE>
<TE>   When Mifune died, Clint Eastwood acknowledged that Mifune's
performance in "Yojimbo" was "definitely an inspiration for me. I
only met him once, but to meet him was like meeting the Asian
equivalent of Clark Gable. He will always be the great samurai for
us."</TE>

<DH>A mural in Santa Monica gives students a new way to think
about the importance of waterways in our lives.</DH>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>

<LD>WHAT happens when you take a museum, a mall, an artist, an idea and
200 kids and put them together? The first installation from the Santa
Monica Museum's "Wall Works" program, a 19-foot mural whose
components are surprisingly varied, an imaginative collage of shapes
and images, from frogs to turtles, lizards, fish and serpents.</LD>
<LD>   The mural, on display at the Santa Monica Place Mall just outside
the third floor of Robinsons-May, is a collaboration of the museum,
Santa Monica Place, L.A. artist Alison Saar and 231 students at nine
schools. Constructed of strung-together wood shingles, each piece
painted in shades of gold, white, blue and black, the public art
project offers a little respite from the crowds, tinsel and Santas
that otherwise populate the mall during the holidays.</LD>
<LD>   "We felt that taking an art collaboration directly into the
classrooms would be an interesting thing to do. It sprang from
talking with the teachers directly and feeling out what their needs
were. And it grew from there," says Asuka Hisa, the museum's
education director. "There were so many people involved with this
first project, and I tried to find an artist who would work
particularly well with this kind of collaboration."</LD>
<TE>   To initiate the program, Hisa asked Saar to create the project
that became known as "Undercurrents."</TE>
<TE>   Drawing on the same inspirations that fuel her own work (which
explores her African American heritage and folk art and utilizes
found and organic objects), Saar created a lesson plan that combines
literature, environmental awareness, history and art in one neat
package. "I had been working quite a bit with rivers in my own work,"
Saar says, "and thinking in general about rivers and what they mean
to communities. I had also been reading the Langston Hughes poem 'The
Negro Speaks of Rivers.' So I had the students read the poem and
think about those ideas and explore what has happened to our own L.A.
River. I saw it as a very loose theme that could tie in a lot of
things at once."</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Monica Museum provided students with an "art kit" filled
with supplies, a lesson plan and video created by Saar and wood
shingles hand-cut by the artist. After a classroom reading of the
Hughes poem, students were asked to express their interpretations and
thoughts visually.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole project was interesting," says Sue Li, a student at
Culver City High School. "We learned about the importance of rivers
and of how rivers became the source of civilization, and it was
interesting to see what people did with their pieces. A lot of people
did work that related to fish and to water."</TE>
<TE>   Li's art teacher, Kristine Hathawacka, found "Undercurrents" to be
"such a full experience, each facet of the program was great. It's
unusual to be able to have an exhibit and to have the kids be able to
contribute individually to a larger whole."</TE>
<TE>   Justine Fassino, another Hathawacka student, says, "It was an
individual thing, but at the end it all came together, so it was kind
of an 'individual collaboration.' It was fun doing it on your own,
but I saw other people's work in the class, and it looked really
good, so it will be exciting to see how it all turned out with the
pieces together."</TE>
<TE>   It is exactly this collaboration -- the joint effort of schools,
artists, students and the museum -- that Hisa sees as the "Wall
Works" program's strongest offering.</TE>
<TE>   "It provides a great sense of 'united we are greater than the sum
of our parts,' " she says, "and I think it gives everyone a sense of
having participated in a much larger event."</TE>

<KH>A NIGHT AT 'THE TOLEDO SHOW'</KH>
<HD>Divine decadence</HD>

<AU>Heidi Siegmund Cuda</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The blond in the trashy lingerie is writhing above your table. With
each perfectly crafted bump and grind, she draws you further into the
fishnets-and-cigarettes world of "The Toledo Show," a Thursday night
scene at the Sunset Room in Hollywood. As she's joined by four other
vamping vixens, they each slink their way to the ringmaster, a lanky
jazzman cradling a 1940s microphone and puffing on a cigarillo.</LD>
<LD>   "The Toledo Show," Hollywood's favorite dirty little secret, is in
full effect. Orchestrated by cult icon Toledo Diamond, an Angeleno
alley cat who's lived nine lives, "The Toledo Show" takes you to the
other side of Tinseltown's tracks with master choreography and
scat-like vocals.</LD>
<LD>   Backed by a live and loose jazz combo, Diamond spits his vocals
into the mike and commands his "dames" around the room. And what a
room: The Sunset is an opulent beauty with a classic sense of style.
After a four-year run at the Union club in the mid-'90s, Diamond's
been bouncing from joint to joint. For the
ex-junkie-turned-choreographer, it took a lot of sin and a decade of
redemption to finally find a venue that's perfect for his show, which
now takes place in the Sunset's spacious dining room that also has a
comfortable bar area. There's never a cover -- a rare treat in
Hollywood -- and it's becoming a destination for people who enjoy a
bit of eroticism with their tuna tartare.</LD>
<TE>   The Sunset Room's retro vibe and Diamond's evocative maneuverings
add up to a great choice for a first date. The "dames" could stir
anyone's libido. Dressed in fishnet stockings, dominatrix shoes,
vintage lingerie and the occasional bondage ensemble, the dancers
fill the room with sexually charged energy.</TE>
<TE>   With music-video choreography credits that include Paula Abdul's
famed "Straight Up" video, Diamond's also worked with such artists as
George Michael and Janet Jackson. But he really shines brightest when
it's his turn to dance. Like a puppet on invisible strings, he
loosely shakes and quivers, kicks his legs up and down the stage's
steps, does back flips over chairs and then cradles the mike, lets
out a howl and it starts all over again. The blonds are creeping,
slinking, shivering, quivering -- and it's not even time for dessert.</TE>

<DH>The action's restrained but charmingly classy at three
hotel bars in Beverly Hills.</DH>

<LD>Beverly Hills night life: Although not quite an oxymoron, it isn't
exactly a term we throw around every day. The sister city to Cannes
is known for many things, but a vibrant late-night scene isn't one of
them. Perhaps it's time to reconsider. After all, the city's swanky
hotel bars got it going on.</LD>
<LD>   Although few of us can afford to plunk down the big bucks required
to overnight at one of these spots, an overpriced cocktail is within
most of our budgets.</LD>
<LD>   And it isn't like you don't get certain extras with that cocktail:
gratis snacks that put pretzels to shame, nicely appointed women's
rooms (without a wait), and a chance, perhaps, to bask in celebrity.</LD>
<TE>   On a recent Friday night, the spacious Windows Lounge at the Four
Seasons on Doheny was jamming, in a most refined Beverly Hills way.
In the rear room, a trio of musicians backed a soulful lounge singer.
Men in navy blazers or black leather worked the smartly dressed women
at the bar. The bright, unmistakable sound of ice on metal -- another
martini being made -- could be heard over the din. And there, in the
front room, in a white T-shirt and white hat, was LL Cool J, eating
salmon filet with a friend.</TE>
<TE>   The two middle-aged men drinking tea nearby knew something was up
when a giddy female patron went up to Mr. Cool J to comment on his
abs. (She had seen him, and them, earlier in the day in a music
video.)</TE>
<TE>   "I like this," said Anne Reid, who, at 22, might have been the
youngest person in the room. "You get dressed up and have a
good-quality time. It's a classic goodness, but trendy at the same
time."</TE>
<TE>   Reid, who works in promotions at Paramount, also gave high marks
to the sour apple martini. As for the price tag? "Honestly," she
confided, "I don't have $14 to spend on drinks. My date has good
taste in places to go. I could never come here on my own. But it
makes a girl feel good."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, there's something almost cinematic about the scene here.
Real, day-to-day life doesn't exist. Welcome to the charmed life. Not
bad for $14.</TE>
<TE>   The feeling is equally luxurious, if a bit more restrained, at the
Regent Beverly Wilshire's handsome wood-paneled bar. (Women: If you
own pearls, here's your chance to put them to good use. Although not
required, they are definitely at home.) On most weekend nights, Tony
Cobb, a theatrical singer and pianist and a fixture at the hotel,
serves up everything from Frank Sinatra to Billy Joel. Small groups
of friends gather around the cocktail tables to catch up. There are
also two semiprivate alcoves, perfect for that discreet tete-a-tete.
Each one features a fabulous-looking, silky gold, oversized tufted
couch.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike at the typical Sunset Strip bar, there is a wide age range.
An older woman sitting quietly with her husband sips a blue creme de
menthe cocktail. A few feet away, a young couple, perhaps hotel
guests, settle in. Granted, most of us have no interest in partying
with our parents. But it's a welcome change to go somewhere where not
everyone is 25, or on the make.</TE>
<TE>   While the Regent's bar has a regal, manly feel -- cognac seems
more right here than a cosmo -- the Polo Lounge at the Beverly Hills
Hotel, a.k.a. the Pink Palace, has a palpable feminine side. This,
despite the mainly dark-green interior and the image of polo ponies
behind the bar. There are pale, rose-colored lamps on each table and
lots of greenery. The picture windows look out at the rear garden
patio illuminated by twinkle lights.</TE>
<TE>   Because the bar itself here is much smaller than, say, the one at
the Four Seasons -- there are only seven stools -- there is less
interaction between patrons. The booths are deep and outfitted with
phones. Most people arrive in pairs or parties -- not that you
couldn't come solo.</TE>
<TE>   Hotel bars lend themselves to parties of one. They feel safe. And
because each of these hotels attracts travelers from around the
world, you gain a certain anonymity. You could be anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Unless, of course, you're LL Cool J.</TE>

<HD>Reclaiming the blues -- with soul</HD>

<LD>Whether it's a neighborhood bar band or any of the supposed guitar
prodigies that are being pushed on the public these days, white
musicians have so bastardized the blues over the years that many of
today's best and brightest young artists shy away from the term. It's
hard to blame them when most of the bands passing themselves off as
the blues these days are so sanitized that they've left out the
genre's most important ingredient: soul. A handful of young, urban
and predominantly white bands are proving they can get it right. The
Black Keys (a soulful stomp duo out of Akron, Ohio), the North
Mississippi Allstars (a rootsy collective from Memphis) and Mr.
Airplane Man (two Boston women who were so enamored of Howlin' Wolf
that they named their band after one of his songs) are among a
growing cluster of acts that like their blues primitive and a little
rough around the edges. They take cues from Son House, not Eric
Clapton. Their inspiration is Junior Kimbrough, not Stevie Ray
Vaughan.</LD>
<LD>   "Ninety-nine percent of blues is just horrible," said Black Keys
guitarist-vocalist Dan Auerbach. "I'm totally embarrassed by it, so
it's hard for us to even say to people, 'Oh, we play the blues,'
because God knows what they're thinking. We just say we play rock 'n'
roll."</LD>
<TE>   No artist likes to be pigeonholed, but rock is a much more
forgiving term. It's much broader, allowing for influences as varied
as punk, R&amp;B, country, folk, hip-hop -- all of which can also be
heard in these bands' songs, whether it's the Motown leanings of the
Black Keys' "I'll Be Your Man" or the sassy punk inflections of Mr.
Airplane Man's "Like That."</TE>
<TE>   "All music goes sour after a while if it's not reinvented," said
Auerbach. The new blues movement might not exist if it weren't for
Fat Possum Records, the tiny Oxford, Miss., label that's as much a
public service as a commercial enterprise. Over the last decade, it's
been keeping Mississippi Delta blues alive, releasing records by R.L.
Burnside, T Model Ford and other aging legends -- and in the process
bringing the music to a new audience that is predominantly young and
urban. Many credit the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion for this when, in
the mid-'90s, the New York City funk-and-punk blues trio folded
Burnside into their songs.</TE>
<TE>   "It helped the whole scene. When you get that cross-cultural,
cross-racial collision, that is powerful," said Luther Dickinson, son
of legendary producer Jim Dickinson and front man for the North
Mississippi Allstars.</TE>
<TE>   It's ironic that it took a New York group to introduce Dickinson
and his bandmate brother, Cody, to the music when "right in my
backyard was Junior Kimbrough's juke joint. R.L. Burnside and his
whole family. Otha Turner and his whole family," said Dickinson, who
now lives in Memphis.</TE>
<TE>   But once he and his brother were turned on to the simple,
repetitive rhythms of the hill country blues, the Allstars were
hooked. The group's first record, 2001's critically acclaimed "Shake
Hands With Shorty" (Artemis), is made up entirely of covers, most of
them penned by Fat Possum artists like Burnside and Fred McDowell.</TE>
<TE>   The Black Keys' Auerbach had a similar experience. After hearing
the bare-bones rhythms of T Model Ford, he became such a fan that he
made a pilgrimage from Akron to Oxford to find him in 1999. It took
him a day to track Ford down, but when he did, the seventysomething
blues man was more than gracious. He played with Auerbach all
afternoon, then invited him to play some more at a juke joint later
that night.</TE>
<TE>   Like Ford, who performs with only one other musician (his drummer,
Spam), the Black Keys are also a duo. It's just Auerbach on guitar
and Patrick Carney on drums. The two, who have been playing together
since high school, tried to incorporate a bass player when recording
their first record, "The Big Come Up" (Alive), earlier this year, but
it didn't work out.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Airplane Man, also a guitar-and-drums two-piece, tried the
same thing, but "we couldn't find anybody who got it," said drummer
Tara McManus. "The Blues Explosion was an influence in realizing you
didn't have to have a bass. T Model Ford is just a guitar and drums.
It really made us both realize that we don't have to feel held back
because we can't find someone to play with."</TE>
<TE>   BUT for the North Mississippi Allstars, their sound didn't come
together until they added bass player Chris Chew, who grew up playing
in church and "brings this uplifting, Southern Baptist feeling" to
the music, Dickinson said. "My brother and I grew up playing together
our whole life. Rock 'n' roll is about playing with other people."</TE>
<TE>   The Allstars have played and recorded with a variety of artists,
including the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion's Judah Bauer, whose side
project, 20 Miles, was among the first of this new wave of blues
bands. Now they're springing up all over the country, most notably in
Memphis and in Detroit, where the blues-influenced White Stripes
jump-started a rock revival.</TE>
<TE>   "When young white kids play black music," said Dickinson, "it
turns into rock 'n' roll. That's what rock 'n' roll is."</TE>

<HD>Backstreet Boys file $100-million suit against label</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Backstreet Boys have filed a $100-million breach-of-contract suit
against the Zomba Music Group, contending that the label
procrastinated in releasing their latest record.</LD>
<LD>   The delay, members claim, harmed their careers, cost them a
$5-million contractual advance and prevented them from going out on
tour, which could have generated "tens of millions of dollars."</LD>
<LD>   Filed in Manhattan's U.S. District Court on Monday, the suit
contends that Zomba, recently acquired by BMG for $2.74 billion,
dragged its feet in approving new songs for the record, knowing that
the advance was contingent on delivering the album by April 30.</LD>
<TE>   The suit also alleges that Zomba focused instead on a solo project
by group member Nick Carter, making him unavailable to complete the
group's album.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the $75 million, the Backstreet Boys are asking for
termination of their recording deal with Jive Records, a division of
Zomba, and an injunction against further interference from the label.
A Zomba representative declined to comment, citing company policy.</TE>

<LD>"The Osbournes" didn't quite pick up where they left off, as viewing
of the second-season premiere Tuesday totaled 6.6 million viewers --
impressive by MTV's standards, but about 1.2 million short of the
audience that tuned in for the unscripted show's finale last spring.</LD>
<LD>   The show did face original network fare, including CBS' "Judging
Amy," which won the time period with 14.7 million viewers, per
Nielsen Media Research estimates, while a prime-time showcase for
"Today" host Katie Couric, "Katie at Night," drew a mere 9 million.</LD>
<LD>   That said, the "Osbournes" episode ranks as the most-watched
program on basic cable this fall, according to MTV.</LD>

<HD>Two journeys into the Chinese psyche</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ning Ying's captivating "Railroad of Hope" and Jiang Wen's
idiosyncratic "Devils on the Doorstep," continues UCLA Film Archives'
New Chinese Cinema series on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Set in China late in World War II, Jiang's film opens in a rocky
mountain village hard by a Japanese blockhouse. Late at night, a man,
most likely a Chinese resistance fighter, bursts into a shack and
thrusts two outsized gunnysacks onto an understandably alarmed
peasant, played by Jiang. Inside the sacks are a terrified Japanese
soldier (Teryuki Kagawa) and his Chinese interpreter (Yuan Ding). The
peasant is ordered to interrogate the two prisoners and hold them
until their captor returns at New Year's, five days away. But six
months later they're still there.</LD>
<LD>   "Devils" is a raucous, pitch-dark satirical comedy ever teetering
on tragedy, and Jiang keeps us imaginatively off balance throughout.
He evokes a timeless sense of brotherhood emerging between captors
and captives, only to suggest how truly fragile it can be. This
ambitious film ran afoul of Chinese censors, who deemed it
unpatriotic and insisted on more than 20 minutes of cuts from its
160-minute running time before it could be shown at Cannes, where it
was the second-place Grand Prix winner in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   What this ironic picture actually depicts is people caught up in a
volatile predicament and uncertain whether to respond to their worst
or best instincts. Even though Jiang bowed to pressure and made the
cuts, the censors banned the film in China and forbade Jiang from
appearing in or directing any films for seven years, acts that
express perfectly the movie's sense of absurdity and paranoia.</TE>
<TE>   Preceding "Devils," at 7:30 p.m. in Melnitz Hall's James Bridges
Theater, the 56-minute documentary "Railroad of Hope" follows
hundreds of peasants from Sichuan as they jam-pack a train for the
1,900-mile ride to pick cotton in Xinjiang in northwestern China.</TE>
<TE>   The passengers are among several thousand agricultural workers who
hope to earn more in two months picking cotton than in harvesting
grain at home. Many have never been aboard a train or even away from
home, and almost certainly they have never been interviewed for a
film. They are refreshingly outspoken (but have not been asked
directly what they think of politics and government) and unassumingly
self-sacrificing. Time and again, they say they are making the long
journey for the sake of their children or parents.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone agrees that taxes are too high in Sichuan in proportion
to the meager profits in harvesting cereal grains, and an older man
and woman assert that hardship stems from the corrupt local
government in Sichuan. Among numerous people Ning speaks to in this
most ingratiating and graceful film is a man who says that what is
most important to him is autonomy and "living in dignity and honesty,
even if modestly."</TE>

<HD>A 'Bayadere' without bravado</HD>
<DH>The staging by the once-mighty Bolshoi Ballet is both
sparse and uninspired.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lewis Segal</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's been 15 years since the Bolshoi Ballet looked like one of the
world's great companies, and its under-rehearsed, under-powered and
strangely underpopulated "La Bayadere" at the Orange County
Performing Arts Center on Tuesday couldn't begin to restore its
former glory.</LD>
<LD>   Rechoreographed in 1991 by the company's longtime artistic
director, Yuri Grigorovich, this version of the 1877 Marius Petipa
war horse replaced a number of mime passages with dancing, added
solos for the hero Solor and the second ballerina Gamzatti and tacked
on a four-minute finale in place of the lost last act.</LD>
<LD>   Where some of the original Petipa dances succumbed to
pseudo-exotic kitsch, Grigorovich refocused them as classical
showpieces or neutralized their gaucheries -- as in the blackface
dance, which is still there choreographically, but happily without
the minstrel-show makeup.</LD>
<TE>   Less defensible: the decision to place a number of sequences on
the forestage, in front of an act curtain, to allow scenery to be
shifted during the action.</TE>
<TE>   Set in ancient India, "La Bayadere" should be a cast-of-thousands
spectacle. But the trickle of Bolshoi dancers crossing the performing
arts center's apron at the beginning of the Act 2 engagement scene
Tuesday simply looked paltry compared with the "Bayadere" brought by
Paris Opera Ballet, the Universal Ballet of Korea, the Kirov Ballet
and American Ballet Theatre to Southland stages.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, ragged dancing took place all evening long, with lots of
mistimings by the corps in the engagement divertissement and many
different ideas about how high legs should be raised in the
celebrated "Kingdom of the Shades" entrance ensemble. Russian
training and coaching guaranteed a certain level of technical
reliability, but the question Tuesday was whether the company was
ready to open.</TE>
<TE>   As Gamzatti, Maria Allash proved stylish but progressively
cautious as her bravura challenges increased toward the end of Act 2.
As Solor, Andrey Uvarov displayed his customary buoyancy and noble
classical line, but the partnering passages seldom looked comfortable
or smooth.</TE>
<TE>   As the Golden Idol, Morihiro Ivata fell prey to shaky
terminations, and as the Act 1 slave, Kirill Nikitin also struggled
with technical control.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, "La Bayadere" should belong to the ballerina cast as
the loving, doomed Nikiya, but Nadezhda Gracheva lacked the majesty,
individuality and interpretive sharpness the role demands.</TE>
<TE>   In the big lovelorn solo of Act 2, it mattered far less that she
finished one of her variations off balance than that she had never
thought through and accounted for major shifts in tempo and attack.
Her dancing in the Shades scene also looked dutiful and generalized,
the product of a great school, but it offered nothing of her own.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, flamboyant subsidiary performances dominated the
evening -- the head fakir (Yan Godovsky) and the raucous drum dancers
(led by Irina Zibrova, Georgy Geraskin and Denis Medvedev), who
supplied the freest dancing, just as the High Brahmin (Alexy
Barsegian) contributed the strongest pantomime.</TE>
<TE>   In the pit, Alexander Kopylov carefully led the Pacific Symphony
through the tinkly, tacky, often downright unlistenable score by
Ludwig Minkus. Three hours of "La Bayadere" always seems like
music-deprivation torture, but on Tuesday, the heart, soul and
bravado of the old Bolshoi were missing as well.</TE>

<LD>For months I had been hearing beautiful piano music as I walked my
dog in my new neighborhood. Finally one day I asked a neighbor where
the music was coming from. "From that house," she said, pointing to a
home cater-corner from hers. "An Italian concert pianist lives there.
Would you like to meet him?"</LD>
<LD>   Like most women, I have a weak spot for musicians. When she added,
"He is yummy," that decided it. "Sure," I said, and she took me
across the street to meet "Guido."</LD>
<LD>   He seemed like a nice enough guy, if a bit energetic and
enthusiastic. Not really my type, but maybe he could help me with my
piano playing, I thought. We exchanged cards.</LD>
<TE>   I finished walking the dog, and when I got home, there was already
a message from Guido: "Hey Samantha, it was great meeting you. It's
always great to meet an attractive new neighbor. If you need
anything, let me know. There's a great coffee shop near here; maybe
we could go sometime."</TE>
<TE>   Well, that was flattering. I left for work.</TE>
<TE>   Phone rings at work. It's Guido.</TE>
<TE>   "Will you meet me for coffee tomorrow?"</TE>
<TE>   Me: "Um, OK." We agree to meet from 11:30 to noon. He has to leave
for a gig by noon.</TE>
<TE>   I get to the coffee shop at 11:40. He is waiting. He buys me a
latte and we chat. Rather, he chats. He lays all his cards on the
table. And it is a double-deck.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been divorced for six years and really, all I'm interested
in is having sex with as many women as possible. I have a problem
with monogamy," he says. Charming!</TE>
<TE>   Next, he says he is a compulsive gambler who flies to Vegas once a
week. Then he tells me all the psychotropic medications he's on. I'm
thinking, this guy is breaking all the rules of Therapy 101.</TE>
<TE>   And clearly, he is a player in more ways than one.</TE>
<TE>   He leaves for his gig. I go to work a little later. Where the
phone rings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's Guido. I'm calling from the studio. I just can't stop
thinking about you."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh?"</TE>
<TE>   "Can I take you to Geoffrey's in Malibu?"</TE>
<TE>   I don't think this is a good idea. But the little Devil Samantha
appears on my shoulder and says, "What harm could one incredibly
expensive dinner do?"</TE>
<TE>   "Well, OK," I say, "but I can't go till a week from Thursday" --
hoping he'll have cooled his jets by then. He agrees.</TE>
<TE>   At home that night, there is not one, not two, not three, but four
messages from him. This guy is like Pepe Le Pew on speed.</TE>
<TE>   The Little Accountant Samantha appears on my shoulder and says:
"Risk clearly outweighs benefit here. Withdraw funds and invest
elsewhere."</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, when I know he is at the studio, I call and
leave a message: "You are moving way, way too fast. You're scaring
me. You need to back off a bit."</TE>
<TE>   When I get home from work that night, there is not one, not two,
but three messages. "I'm sorry, you're right," he says on the first.
"I just got really excited. You know, I'm a guy. But I'm like an
average guy times 1,600.... I won't call you again. I'll wait for you
to call me."</TE>
<TE>   Beep. "I know I said I wouldn't call you again, but I feel like
you got the wrong impression of me. I'm really not a scary guy. It's
just this transition period from my divorce. I have all of these
issues I'm dealing with. I won't call you again...."</TE>
<TE>   Beep. "I know I said I wouldn't call you again. But I was really
hoping we could just go to lunch sometime and talk about all of
this...."</TE>
<TE>   The next day:</TE>
<TE>   Beep. "I know I said I wouldn't call you again. But I just really
feel the need to explain myself .... Please call me back, just so
I'll know you got the messages...."</TE>
<TE>   Beep. "Hey, I got some free CDs from my record company. If you
want some, stop by...."</TE>
<TE>   The following day:</TE>
<TE>   Beep. "Hey, I hope I'm not bugging you. I really am not a scary
person. I am getting the message loud and clear that you don't want
to talk to me. OK, I can respect that.... But I really wish you would
call me back, because I really just need some closure."</TE>
<TE>   Closure?</TE>
<TE>   I may have to shoot the piano player.</TE>

<LD>YOU might be tempted to call it a crash course for the ravers, but at
four hours plus, a new two-disc DVD collection of David Bowie's music
videos and other filmed performances weighs in more like a full-scale
graduate course. By the time of your "Best of Bowie" finals, you
might be ready to propose a revisionist perspective on the singer's
reputation as a video visionary.</LD>
<LD>   A pioneer he was, no doubt about that. The three staged,
lip-synced performances produced and directed by photographer Mick
Rock in 1972 -- "John, I'm Only Dancing," "The Jean Genie" and "Space
Oddity" -- are among the early leaflets that would spark the video
revolution, even if the fairly static footage isn't very interesting.</LD>
<LD>   But for a complex, groundbreaking musician who's invariably
described as a trend-setting force in a multitude of media and for
someone whose involvement with the art world has taken him to the
queasy cutting edge of contemporary visual expression, Bowie compiled
is surprisingly bland, at least once the dust settles from his
blazing arrival and before a burst of renewed inspiration toward the
end of the line.</LD>
<TE>   It's easy to figure out why when you look at the song list. The
bulk of the material is drawn from Bowie's output in the 1980s, the
most artistically barren stretch of his career. Even though some of
the videos -- notably "Let's Dance," with its evocative, enigmatic
depiction of Third World and modern world in uneasy contact -- make
something out of very little, most of the work from the "Let's Dance"
and "Tonight" albums is mired in cliched images and self-absorbed
performances.</TE>
<TE>   Not so in the early going. The set opens with three songs taped
for the BBC show "Old Grey Whistle Test," with Bowie and his band the
Spiders From Mars in their "Ziggy Stardust"-era iconic finery.</TE>
<TE>   Bowie's unfiltered charisma and the understated urgency of "Oh!
You Pretty Things" and "Five Years" make it obvious how this
ambitious androgyne was able to seduce a generation. Maybe the
liveliest clip from this period is a "Rebel Rebel" for Dutch
television, with a bee's-eye fragmentation lens looming behind Bowie,
who's done up as an eye patch-wearing, foppish buccaneer. Ah,
Amsterdam.</TE>
<TE>   "Young Americans," from a 1974 "Dick Cavett Show" appearance,
marks the flowering of Bowie's black music infatuation (a young
Luther Vandross is one of the backup singers) and is the first of
several times that the Englishman dresses up to suggest Frank
Sinatra.</TE>
<TE>   The landmark "Low" and "Heroes" albums yielded few of the
collection's videos, and they're followed by that long, dry stretch
in the '80s. The gaudy surrealism of "Ashes to Ashes," with Bowie in
his harlequin guise, is one bright spot. His cavorting with Mick
Jagger on "Dancing in the Street" is not.</TE>
<TE>   Gus Van Sant and Julien Temple are two of the name directors
represented in the set. David Lynch isn't, but it's his spirit that
hovers over the disquieting imagery in some of its newest entries.
Bowie turned from empty commercialism to challenging obscurity in his
'90s music, and the creep-out videos for such songs as "The Heart's
Filthy Lesson" and "Little Wonder" have the energy and fearless
invention you expect from the ostensible master of sound + vision.</TE>

<LD>At homes across America this morning, kitchens are already in high
gear in preparation for the traditional Thanksgiving feast. Tables
are being set, houses are being tidied up, and the most serious
eaters are already rummaging their closets in search of outfits with
extra wiggle room.</LD>
<LD>   The folks at the Food Network, meanwhile, see this day as their
supreme challenge. They're aware that, for most people, dining
becomes the ultimate participatory sport on Thanksgiving, but
nevertheless, they're moving forward with a slate of programming that
they hope will tempt you to fire up the tube along with the double
oven.</LD>
<LD>   "Sara's Thanksgiving Secrets" gets things underway at 7 a.m.,
offering last-minute recipes for procrastinating cooks. Martha
Stewart checks in at 8 with more of the same in her "Thanksgiving
Celebrations From Martha's Kitchen," and that most ebullient of
chefs, Emeril Lagasse, follows with "Turkey Treasures" at 9.</LD>
<TE>   "Thanksgiving Unwrapped" serves up turkey-day trivia at 10, and
then from 11 to 5 p.m., there's a block of a dozen episodes of the
fun "$40 a Day" program hosted by perky Rachael Ray that shows you
how to dine out in style on a budget, all while touring the globe. In
addition to stops in Amsterdam (3:30 p.m.), Rome (4 p.m.) and Paris
(4:30 p.m.), there's even a visit to several L.A. restaurants (1:30
p.m.).</TE>
<TE>   The day's special programming is capped from 5 to 8 p.m. with
hourlong episodes of "Extreme Cuisine," featuring segments on "Food
as Art," "Guilty Pleasures" and "Rarest Foods."</TE>
<TE>   Bon appetit.</TE>

<DH>An art show at the bar Star Shoes blends disparate scenes.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>THE black-garbed, slinky models wore matching masks that covered
their lovely features but accentuated their extravagant sculpture
jewelry. Perched on the walls, next to the vintage shoes always on
display here, moving photographs of ballerinas, fairies and a
pregnant woman with blue body paint on her belly graced the room in
old wood frames. All around them, 60 or so funky monkeys hung on the
walls, and some of the sober partygoers swore these simians were
talking.</LD>
<LD>   The eclectic art exhibition on a recent Wednesday was part of Star
Shoes owner Johnny Nixon's dream of melding the city's film, fashion,
music and art scenes to create a cultural club night where revelers
can do more than just party. And what better setting than his sleek
year-old bar, which offers antique shoes and shines along with music
and booze.</LD>
<LD>   "Since we opened, this is something I've wanted to provide," said
Nixon, a native Angeleno, "a social environment that's both urban and
upscale and combines a hybrid between the people who have always
lived here and the ones who recently came here. I want this to be a
platform for their dreams."</LD>
<TE>   It didn't take long for artist Jason Hooper to fulfill his fantasy
of introducing his monkeys, which depict different aspects of his
zany personality, to the City of Angels. Hooper, 31, moved from San
Francisco to Los Angeles on the day of his show.</TE>
<TE>   "What an introduction to the city," the native New Yorker said
while standing in front of one of his monkeys. Using pastels on gold,
white or blue latex mixed with acrylic, Hooper draws monkeys because
in his loneliest hours in Brooklyn, they became his closest friends.
"I was pretty miserable and lonely living in this apartment in
Brooklyn, and I just started drawing them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The monkeys spoke to fashion designer Jose Angel Castro when he
came across them in San Francisco. So Castro, who was host of the
Star Shoes event, talked Hooper into bringing them south and named
the show "Pure Monkey Lovin'," which will periodically return to Star
Shoes.</TE>
<TE>   "Jose gets along very well with my artwork," says Hooper. Castro,
who designs clothes for his private clientele, met Nixon at a fashion
show at the bar in May.</TE>
<TE>   The two began working on plans for an occasional artsy night at
Star Shoes.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether it was paintings or sculptures or videography, we wanted
to make something impactful without the pretension," said Castro, who
was sporting a sexy denim sarong over his gray slacks. "By mixing the
urban social set with the artistic set, which both can have equal
brands of pretension, we figured the pretension would be eliminated,
and we'd be left with the truth."</TE>
<TE>   The models who showcased jewelry from Sculpture to Wear were
instructed to interact nonverbally with guests. One unrelenting man
broke the rules by writing notes to a model whose phone number he
wanted.</TE>
<TE>   In the women's bathroom, a paparazzo wannabe snapped shots of
women (and later some men) holding a sign that read "I'm a Girl
Hollywood." Outside, Hooper and photographer Lisa Candela mingled.</TE>
<TE>   Candela used recycled wood from a barn that was razed and
90-year-old glass from a house that was torn down to frame her
eye-catching portraits. "Glowing," her sensual black-and-white shot
of a naked woman, is her bestseller. "It just goes to show you that
everyone in L.A. is perverted," she joked.</TE>
<TE>   Jenny Castillo, 23, and Beth Vanrood, 25, fans of Candela's work,
said they appreciate Nixon's efforts to present art to the community
in a fun setting.</TE>
<TE>   "This bar is eclectic and always offers something fresh," said
Castillo, a Cal State Fullerton public relations student. "It has
such a good energy. You can actually talk to people in this club. And
now you can come appreciate good art, too."</TE>

<DH>A songwriter puts her money where her passion is for a film

<SE></SE>
<AU>James Verini</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>PERHAPS you've heard of Carol Connors. A singer-songwriter and scorer
of movies, she was once a member of Phil Specter's first hit
concoction, the Teddy Bears, who scored in 1958 with "To Know Him Is
to Love Him." She dated Elvis Presley for nearly a year. Later in
life, she was responsible for such classics as "Gonna Fly Now," the
Oscar-winning title theme from "Rocky," and of course that soundtrack
to televised insomnia, "Champagne Wishes and Caviar Dreams" from
"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous." Then again, perhaps you haven't
heard of Carol Connors.</LD>
<LD>   Truth be told, Carol Connors doesn't much care if you've heard of
her. Connors is more concerned that you've heard of her cats.</LD>
<LD>   That's why, last March, she sought out the services of Tribute
Films, a documentary production company in Santa Monica that
specializes in the filmed memorialization of pets, and paid more than
$10,000 for a film about her two Abyssinians, Music and 'NLyrics
("It's like 'N Sync, because I wanted him to feel comfortable in the
21st century"). The result is "Carol Connors and Her Cats," a
testament to Connors' ailurophilia: love of felines.</LD>
<TE>   "Hugh Hefner once took some pictures of me," said Connors, who
would not reveal her age. "He said, 'Carol, I want to do this so you
can look back and see how beautiful you were.' Well, that's what I
want to do. I want people to see how beautiful my cats are."</TE>
<TE>   "Carol is an amazing polymath," said Sebastian Doggart (that's his
real name), director and head of Tribute Films. "She's a bit bonkers
too -- and she knows it and revels in it."</TE>
<TE>   Tribute (www.tributefilms.com) offers pet-lovers looking to
connect with eternity two avenues: the Paw Print Package, which
includes a short film of photographs and footage of the animal, and
the Purrfect Package, which might be called the Cadillac of filmed
pet memorials. It includes unlimited actuality and archival footage,
music, location shooting, the works. It starts at $10,000. Needless
to say, Connors got the Purrfect Package.</TE>
<TE>   "Carol Connors and Her Cats" premiered to great acclaim last
Thursday at a luncheon party in the cavernous Century Club in Century
City. A private room upstairs had been done over in leopard print:
leopard-print tablecloths, leopard-print snap bracelets on each
plate, and at least one leopard-print item or accessory on each of
the two dozen or so immaculate Holmby Hills doyennes and
semi-starlets of yesteryear whom Connors counts among her friends.</TE>
<TE>   Doggart introduced the film as an "epic tale of ambition and
desire and cats."</TE>
<TE>   Connors stood by, petite and clamorous in skin-tight leopard-print
knickers and jacket, heckling herself. "You're going to see a lot of
rocky moments in this film!" she cracked, as the "Rocky" theme played
over the opening credits.</TE>
<TE>   It was all there, the whole story of Connors and her cats. Her
first encounter with an Abyssinian -- she keeps only Abyssinians and
has had six in all over the course of 25 years -- in the early 1970s,
when she was too poor to afford a home of her own, much less a
special Egyptian breed of house pet to keep in it. The dream she had
auguring the death of her first cat, Songbird, and the arrival of its
successor, Harmony. The glory years of post-"Rocky" royalties with
her favorite, Minstrel. "He was my soul mate, my Clark Gable," said
Connors, who has never been married.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, it was an 18-minute A&amp;E-style melange of home video,
zoomed-in stills, gold records and cat paraphernalia, and it provoked
constant laughter and not a few stray tears. "This is the saddest
thing I've ever seen," moaned Charlene Tilton, during the segment
commemorating the late Minstrel (1985-2001). You may remember Tilton
as the paramour who stole J.R. from Sue Ellen on "Dallas." Then
again, you may not. Not five minutes earlier, Tilton had pronounced
the film the funniest thing she'd ever seen.</TE>
<TE>   After the film, Connors' friends opened up about their pets. Barbi
Benton, a former Playboy playmate and live-in companion of Hugh
Hefner, admitted that her primary residence in Aspen abuts an elks
reserve, so she cannot have dogs, a fact that saddens her. But she is
considering engaging Tribute Films to commemorate her husband, George
Gradow, the trailer-park magnate.</TE>
<TE>   Deanna Lund, of short-lived '60s sci-fi series "Land of the
Giants" fame, has two Wheaton terriers, given to her by Larry King,
to whom she was engaged briefly years ago. But would she pay $10,000
to make a movie about them? "No," said Lund, summarily.</TE>
<TE>   Cheryl Post, one of the original Mousketeers, felt differently.
"If my Australian sheepdog Schroder was still alive, I'd do it in a
flat second," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Doggart, 32, conceived of Tribute Films while having a picnic in
the Hollywood Forever cemetery. An Eton- and Cambridge-educated
documentarian whose typical previous projects included a series on
the history of Christianity made for British television, Doggart
wanted to get into more personal filmmaking. "You get to know someone
so well doing this," he said. "It's like a love affair."</TE>
<TE>   In Connors' case, probably even more so. "Outside of my music, I
love my cats," she said. "I love them and they love me."</TE>

<TE>   The British comedian, who refers to himself as an executive
transvestite, a male tomboy and a male lesbian, shines in his Emmy
Award-winning one-man show, which was shot in 1998 in San Francisco
and debuted on HBO in 1999. Decked out in frosted blond hair, tons of
makeup, a colorful tunic shirt, leather pants and heels, Izzard waxes
comedic about Hitler, England's colonial years, JFK, Easter, Italians
and their motorcycles, and the Anglican Church. The DVD features
another Izzard one-man show, "Dress to Circle," which he shot in
Paris and performs in French. Izzard supplies commentaries for both
of his shows but is rather subdued, although he keeps saying that
despite his penchant for women's clothing, he is definitely straight.</TE>

<TE>   "Ice Age"</TE>
<TE>   Animated</TE>
<TE>   Fox, $25 VHS; $30 DVD</TE>
<TE>   Charming, funny and sentimental, this computer-animated film set
during the Ice Age is sort of a "Three Prehistoric Animals and a
Baby." Three misfits -- a fast-talking, dimwitted sloth named Sid
(voiced by John Leguizamo), a woolly mammoth named Manny (Ray Romano)
and a saber-toothed tiger named Diego (Denis Leary) -- come together
to return a human baby boy to his father.</TE>
<TE>   The two-disc DVD, available in both pan-and-scan and wide-screen,
also features such goodies as commentary with director Chris Wedge
and co-director Carlos Saldanha, six deleted scenes with Wedge's
commentary, a multi-angle look at the animation progression, Wedge's
Oscar-winning short, "Bunny," and Sid riffing about his scenes in the
movie. The DVD-ROM features several interactive games and numerous
printables.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Men in Black II"</TE>
<TE>   Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith</TE>
<TE>   Columbia TriStar; $25 VHS;</TE>
<TE>   $29 DVD</TE>
<TE>   Despite the return of the two charismatic stars and director Barry
Sonnenfeld, this big-budget sequel to the 1997 sci-fi comedy hit is a
drag. The humor quickly wears out its welcome, and several of the
special effects look cheesy, at least on the wide-screen DVD. Even
the cameo by Michael Jackson fizzles. The movie's best performance
comes from the cute little pug that plays the wisecracking agent,
Frank. In fact, Sonnenfeld says that the little dog was a one-take
wonder that always hit his mark.</TE>
<TE>   The two-disc digital edition includes Sonnenfeld commentary, a
dreadful alternate ending, a blooper reel -- a very cute animated
short "The Chubbchubbs" and 14 passable production featurettes.</TE>

<TE>   Rebecca Miller, the daughter of Arthur Miller and wife of Daniel
Day-Lewis, made her feature directorial debut with this award-winning
1995 film about a 10-year-old girl (Ryne) with an active fantasy
life. The digital edition includes talent files and sharp, amusing
commentary from Miller.</TE>

<HD>Genuity Agrees to Sell Assets to Level 3</HD>
<DH>The high-speed Internet service provider files Chapter 11.
The buyer would pay $242 million for its operations and customer
base.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jessica Hall</AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Genuity Inc., a high-speed Internet service provider, said Wednesday
that it filed for bankruptcy protection and agreed to sell its assets
for about $242 million to Level 3 Communications Inc., a rival backed
by billionaire investor Warren Buffett.</LD>
<LD>   Level 3, based in Broomfield, Colo., recently got an infusion of
$500 million in funding from a group led by Buffett and has made no
secret of its interest in using that money to fund acquisitions.</LD>
<LD>   With the Genuity deal, Level 3, a high-speed communications
company, would gain Internet access services, more than 3,000
customers such as America Online Inc., and one of the oldest
pedigrees in the industry. In 1969, Genuity's predecessor, BBN Corp.,
designed and helped build Arpanet, the basis for today's Internet.</LD>
<TE>   Genuity, which provides data transmission, Internet access and
security services and Web site hosting, is the latest communications
company to buckle under the weak economy, slim demand from corporate
customers and a glut of high-speed network capacity.</TE>
<TE>   Woburn, Mass.-based Genuity defaulted on its debt in July after
Verizon Communications Inc., its former parent company, decided not
to rescue the money-losing company. Verizon was forced to spin off
Genuity as a condition of the merger of Bell Atlantic Corp. and GTE
Corp., which created Verizon in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Genuity, which has been in talks for several months to renegotiate
the terms of its debts, has $1.9 billion in assets and $4 billion in
debts, according to the Chapter 11 filing in the U.S. District Court
for the Southern District of New York.</TE>
<TE>   Genuity's creditors would receive the money Level 3 pays for
Genuity's assets, as well as additional cash on Genuity's balance
sheet after the close of the transaction.</TE>
<TE>   With more than $800 million in cash to fund the company's
operations, Genuity said it would continue to operate without
interruption during the transitional period.</TE>
<TE>   Level 3 said the deal would preserve its fully funded status. It
said the similarities between service offerings and geographical
reach would allow it to cut costs and increase sales.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts expect other communications network operators to merge as
the industry grapples with an abundance of capacity and weak demand.</TE>
<TE>   Level 3 and Genuity expect the deal to close in the first quarter
of 2003, pending Bankruptcy Court approval. Under the bankruptcy
proceedings, a new suitor could emerge during an auction of Genuity's
assets.</TE>
<TE>   Level 3 would acquire Genuity's brand name, its high-speed data
network and operations and its customer base, including lucrative
accounts with Verizon and America Online.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Genuity fell 20 cents to 26 cents, and Level 3 rose 41
cents to $5.60, both on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>MGM Mirage Settles Race Bias Lawsuit With EEOC</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Decker</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>MGM Mirage has agreed to pay more than $1 million to settle a federal
lawsuit accusing the casino operator of discriminating against black
and Latino job applicants at its Mirage Hotel and Casino on the Las
Vegas Strip.</LD>
<LD>   A group of black and Latino applicants will get $840,000 in cash
compensation, and the rest of the money will pay for new training
programs at the Las Vegas-based company, the U.S. Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission said Wednesday. The agency filed the lawsuit
and announced the settlement at the same time.</LD>
<LD>   The allegations of discrimination date from Jan. 1, 1996, to May
31, 1997, a period before what was then called MGM Grand Inc. bought
Mirage Resorts Inc., the EEOC said. MGM Mirage agreed to undergo EEOC
monitoring for three years to ensure such discrimination doesn't
happen again.</LD>
<TE>   "In addition to providing a substantial amount of monetary relief
to the victims, the settlement puts in place extensive mechanisms to
help prevent discrimination in the future," Olophius Perry, director
of the EEOC's Los Angeles office, which has jurisdiction for Nevada,
said in a statement that was jointly distributed by the EEOC and MGM
Mirage.</TE>
<TE>   Debbie Thomas, vice president of human resources for the Mirage,
said the company in 2000 implemented "the industry's first formal
diversity program" and more than half the employees are of minority
backgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   "We are proud of our record on diversity and look forward to
supplementing our existing training efforts with those agreed to as
part of this settlement," Thomas said in the statement.</TE>
<TE>   Las Vegas-based MGM Mirage also operates the MGM Grand Las Vegas
and the New York-New York Hotel and Casino as well as other hotel and
casino resorts.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of MGM Mirage climbed $1.48 to close at $34.10 in New York
Stock Exchange trading.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co. won a judge's approval for a $28.6-million
settlement of a lawsuit by shareholders who claimed Compaq Computer
Corp. executives made false, optimistic statements about the stock
while selling their shares.</LD>
<LD>   Stockholder Mark Berger filed the class-action lawsuit in 1998
against Compaq, now part of Hewlett-Packard, in federal court in
Houston. The suit claimed that the drop in Compaq's share price after
the executives' statements hurt investors who bought stock between
July 1997 and March 1998.</LD>
<LD>   Hewlett-Packard shares rose 84 cents to $19.59 on the NYSE.</LD>

<LD>Securities regulators obtained an order barring a California man and
a telemarketing operation he ran from offering securities in a
purported auto-service and maintenance company.</LD>
<LD>   Joseph Sanfellipo and California AutoCare Corp. allegedly told
investors through telemarketing pitches that they would make 400%
when the company went public in 30 to 60 days, the Securities and
Exchange Commission said.</LD>
<LD>   Sanfellipo, 53, of Laguna Beach, along with AutoCare and
co-defendants James Gasper, 64, Kimball Vance, Jr., 49, and Elihu
Sigal, 55, agreed to an order barring them from selling unregistered
stock, and to pay back an as yet undetermined amount of gains plus
penalties. They could not be reached for comment.</LD>

<HD>Treasury Yields Rise on Upbeat Data, Stock Rally</HD>
<DH>With more hints of an economic recovery, investors move
quickly to dump bonds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Treasury bond investors are growing increasingly worried that their
long bull run is over.</LD>
<LD>   The raft of better-than-expected economic statistics on Wednesday
sent yields on longer-term Treasury securities soaring, as investors
dumped bonds on fears that the next big move for yields is up.</LD>
<LD>   Figures on jobs, manufacturing and orders for big-ticket items
"solidified the view that the economy's not as bad as it was
perceived to be, and that's making it a nasty day for Treasuries,"
said Gary Cooper, who helps invest about $4.3 billion at Assante
Asset Management Ltd. in Winnipeg, Canada.</LD>
<TE>   The yield on the 10-year Treasury note jumped to 4.25% from 4.07%
on Tuesday, and now is the highest since Oct. 22. The yield on the
five-year T-note surged to 3.31% from 3.12%, and now is the highest
since Aug. 27.</TE>
<TE>   The Treasury sold $27 billion of new two-year notes Wednesday at a
yield of 2.12%. That was up from the recent low yield of 1.67% on
notes of that term on Oct. 9.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, yields on shorter-term Treasuries, such as three-month
and six-month T-bills, were little changed Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   And the average seven-day yield on money market mutual funds fell
to 0.96%, down from 1.01% last week and the lowest ever, according to
money-fund tracker IMoneyNet Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Reserve controls short-term rates, and the Fed's
half-point cut in its benchmark rate on Nov. 6, to 1.25%, guarantees
that shorter-term yields will stay at or near current levels until
the central bank decides otherwise, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   But longer-term yields are set by the marketplace. And if
investors figure the economy is improving, they also may bet that
demand for money -- and inflation -- will rise in 2003. Either or
both of those factors could drive longer-term yields up.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, many investors who have piled into Treasury bonds
over the last two years, seeking safe haven as the stock market has
crumbled, may be inclined to shift their capital back into stocks or
other riskier assets if they believe the economy will be OK, analysts
said.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper said he sold all of his Treasury holdings last month in the
belief that 10-year yields had reached their lows for the year.</TE>
<TE>   Many experts caution that the economic outlook remains murky, and
that it may be premature to predict an extended rise in long-term
yields.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still not convinced this is the start of the long-awaited
economic recovery," said Ethan Harris, economist at Lehman Bros. in
New York. Even so, he said, "It's hard for the bond market to ignore"
upbeat data such as Wednesday's reports.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg News and Reuters were used in compiling this report.</TE>

<HD>FASB to Look Into Pension Standards</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Accounting rule makers may change how companies must account for
pension income and expenses, as pension assets pummeled by tumbling
stock markets burn a hole in corporate pocketbooks.</LD>
<LD>   The Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets accounting
rules for U.S. companies, will discuss whether to improve pension
accounting rules in upcoming meetings with its advisory arm, Chairman
Robert Herz said this week.</LD>
<LD>   In recent weeks, pension liabilities have moved up on corporate
America's list of woes as the stock market, in danger of suffering
its third straight losing year, leaves pension plans underfunded and
pension costs start biting into earnings.</LD>
<TE>   Overly optimistic assumptions about the returns companies expect
to earn from their pension assets, which in turn can soften the blow
to earnings, have also begun to draw scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   The accounting board, in particular, is reaching out to financial
statement users such as analysts and fund managers to help decide
whether it should add a project on pension accounting to its agenda,
which is already crammed with other "hot button" issues, including
stock options and bringing U.S. rules in line with international
standards.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Herz makes no bones about how the current pension
accounting rules in the United States leave much to be desired.</TE>
<TE>   "It is complex, it's somewhat opaque," Herz said, adding that he
had received mixed opinions on whether to modify current rules.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not too fond of pension accounting."</TE>
<TE>   Any new rules on pension accounting -- if the accounting board
decides to head down that path -- will not be produced anytime soon.
The board will not add such a project to its agenda at least until
next year, Herz said.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, several companies, including IBM Corp. and
General Motors Corp. have said their pension plans are underfunded.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of this year, 98% of traditional pension funds, also
known as defined benefit plans, at the 346 Standard &amp; Poor's 500
companies that have such plans, are expected to be underfunded,
Merrill Lynch estimates.</TE>

<TE>   Merrill Lynch Issues Settlement Checks</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. has sent checks totaling roughly $100 million
to 48 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, under an agreement
negotiated this year with New York state to settle charges its
analysts misled investors.</TE>
<TE>   The checks were cut Monday and have either been received by most
states or will be shortly, a Merrill spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill, the nation's largest brokerage, agreed to the fine in May
after a 10-month investigation by New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer
that uncovered e-mails from Merrill analysts disparaging stocks they
publicly praised, allegedly to win lucrative investment banking
business. The agreement forced the firm to separate research from its
investment banking division, a move mirrored by Citigroup last month.</TE>
<TE>   Under the terms of Merrill's settlement, New York received the
highest payout with $48 million because it took the lead in the
investigation, said Marc Beauchamp, executive director of the North
American Securities Administration Assn., an umbrella group for state
securities regulators.</TE>
<TE>   Beauchamp's group received $2 million, while the remaining $50
million went to the other states, with the largest amounts going to
those with the most people. California, for instance, took in $5.6
million, while Wyoming received $500,000, a floor set for the smaller
states.</TE>
<TE>   The lone holdouts not signing off on the national settlement with
Merrill are Arizona and Missouri, slated to be paid $854,732 and
$932,128, respectively, when they hammer out their differences with
Merrill, NASAA and Merrill said.</TE>

<HD>Ruling Could Force Theater Alterations</HD>
<DH>Judge finds that AMC chain's stadium-style seating layout
violates disabilities law.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Bates</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AMC Entertainment Inc., the giant movie theater chain, said Wednesday
that it plans to appeal a recent federal court decision that its
popular stadium-style seating violates the Americans with
Disabilities Act.</LD>
<LD>   Last week's ruling by U.S. District Judge Florence-Marie Cooper in
Los Angeles stemmed from a 1999 lawsuit brought by the Justice
Department. It broke a string of successful legal victories by the
theater industry, which claims to have complied with the 12-year-old
law by providing other, unobstructed views for moviegoers in
wheelchairs.</LD>
<LD>   In her decision Cooper said wheelchair users are segregated into
separate areas, usually close to the screen, that are inferior for
movie viewing. The judge concluded that AMC theaters violated the
disabilities act by failing to "provide lines of sight comparable to
those for members of the general public."</LD>
<TE>   "It's a great victory for common sense," said Larry Paradis,
executive director of Disability Rights Advocates in Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   AMC's offices in Kansas City, Mo., closed early on Wednesday and
executives could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   But AMC said in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission earlier in the day that it planned to appeal Cooper's
decision.</TE>
<TE>   AMC noted in the filing that other courts had approved the kind of
seating AMC provides for the disabled, and added that Cooper's ruling
does not suggest any specific remedies.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, AMC said, it was impossible to know the effect the
ruling could have on both the company and on the movie exhibition
business as a whole. Industry experts said, however, that the judge's
decision could force theater owners to revamp their seating plans,
potentially costing them millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Stadium seating is a relatively new innovation that gives
moviegoers a clear view of the screen without having to look past the
head of the person in front of them. Rows of seats rise sharply on
tiered levels, in contrast to the gently sloping seating that
theaters traditionally have offered.</TE>
<TE>   AMC first installed stadium seating in Dallas in 1995, court
papers show. It since has made stadium seating a key part of its
marketing, advertising that seats "virtually suspend the moviegoer in
front of the wall-to-wall screen" and that all seats are "the best in
the house."</TE>
<TE>   Because stadium seating is accessible by stairs, theaters usually
set aside an area below for those in wheelchairs.</TE>
<TE>   Law professor Mark Kelman of Stanford University said that
Cooper's decision was significant because it questioned the notion
that the disabled should sit in another area away from most others to
watch a movie. The disabilities act was intended to break down those
barriers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not about how much worse the line of sight is, but about
segregation," Kelman said</TE>
<TE>   Law professor Chai Feldblum of Georgetown University in Washington
said providing more equal seating is a reasonable request for
theaters.</TE>
<TE>   "If I really care about getting a good seat in a theater, I have
the power to get there early and get a good seat," said Feldblum, who
helped write the disabilities act. "But if I use a wheelchair, I can
never have the access those who don't use wheelchairs have."</TE>
<TE>   AMC shares were unchanged Wednesday at $9.70 on the American Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Buffett Denies Rumors He Is Seeking to Buy Burger King
Chain</HD>
<DH>The billionaire investor responds to newspaper ad, accusing
others of spreading false reports.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barry Bedlan</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Billionaire investor Warren Buffett doused speculation that he was
exploring buying fast-food giant Burger King and accused others of
spreading false reports.</LD>
<LD>   "Obviously there are people, sometimes, who have a financial
interest in spreading rumors in our supposed interest in a business
or security when no such interest exists," Buffett said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Berkshire Hathaway Inc., the Omaha-based company headed by
Buffett, had been mentioned as being among possible bidders for the
Miami-based Burger King chain of restaurants.</LD>
<TE>   The chain is being sold by its parent company, Diageo of London,
which wants to concentrate on its beverage business.</TE>
<TE>   Buffett and other Berkshire Hathaway officials in recent weeks
have declined to comment on what they described as "only
speculation."</TE>
<TE>   Buffett said he was forced to comment on the Burger King reports
after cholesterol fighter Phil Sokolof ran an ad in the Omaha
World-Herald on Tuesday asking Buffett not to purchase the restaurant
chain. An Omaha businessman, Sokolof has spent millions of dollars
urging people to stay away from fatty food.</TE>
<TE>   "We never confirm nor deny such rumors. In this case, we made an
exception because of Phil Sokolof's ad," Buffett said.</TE>

<HD>Economy Shows Signs of Regaining Strength</HD>
<DH>Consumers flex their muscles in October as orders for
durable goods rise and jobless claims fall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Warren Vieth</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Government statisticians on Wednesday gave the nation something to
savor along with Thanksgiving dinner, reporting new signs of economic
strength at the shopping mall, on the factory floor and in the
unemployment office.</LD>
<LD>   Consumer spending rose 0.4% in October, the biggest gain in three
months. Orders for communication gear and other durable goods surged
2.8% after two consecutive declines. Initial claims for jobless
benefits fell to the lowest level since February 2001. Other
indicators provided reinforcement, fueling a powerful, pre-holiday
rally on Wall Street.</LD>
<LD>   Economists said that the new statistics suggest the recovery is
proceeding, albeit at a creeping pace, and that the risk of a second
round of recession is considerably lower than many had feared.</LD>
<TE>   "The numbers are fantastic," said economist Brian Wesbury at
Griffin, Kubik, Stephens &amp; Thompson Inc., a Chicago investment
banking firm. "It appears the odds of a double dip are virtually
zero."</TE>
<TE>   Although there were a few sour notes, such as a 38-year low in
help-wanted advertising, the performance of key indicators helped
propel the stock market to big gains. Meanwhile, yields on
longer-term Treasury bonds surged as investors bet that a stronger
economy could mean greater demand for money in 2003, driving rates
higher.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the financial markets' way of saying that maybe the
economists finally do have it right and the recovery really is on
track," said Richard Yamarone, chief economist at Argus Research Co.
in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer spending has provided the economy with critical support
during the downturn that began in March 2001, and the latest figures
show it has continued to hold up in the face of rising unemployment.
October's 0.4% increase was the biggest since July, the Commerce
Department said, and erased a September decline of 0.4%, which turned
out to be smaller than reported a month ago.</TE>
<TE>   Personal income grew 0.2% in October, the smallest gain in three
months, but it followed nearly a year of improvement in the category
(excepting a slight income dip last July).</TE>
<TE>   "You cannot fight the strength of this consumer," Yamarone said.
"The consumer has three things going for him right now: low interest
rates, low inflation and rising incomes."</TE>
<TE>   There were indications Americans would continue to dig deep during
the upcoming holiday shopping season. The University of Michigan's
consumer confidence index rose 4.4% in November, its first increase
in six months. Although economists had been hoping for a slightly
stronger rebound, a big increase in expectations of future conditions
contributed to Wednesday's ebullience.</TE>
<TE>   "After going through a period where we had a run of relatively bad
news, it's nice to be on the other side," said economist Chris
Varvares at Macroeconomic Advisers, a St. Louis consulting firm.
"We're in a game of catch-up."</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts were more impressed by the increase in orders
received by U.S. factories for cars, appliances, machinery and other
durable goods. October's 2.8% gain was more than double the consensus
forecast of 1.3%, and ended a losing streak that began in August, the
Commerce Department said.</TE>
<TE>   Orders for communications equipment posted the biggest percentage
increase, soaring 65.2%. Vehicle orders rose 3.9%, and machinery rose
3.3%. Computer orders fell 1.3%, commercial aircraft slipped 3.3%,
and defense aircraft fell 5.9%.</TE>
<TE>   "We got a positive feast of economic data today, but the icing on
the cake was the durable goods numbers," Merrill Lynch economist
Gerald Cohen said. "It definitely suggests that companies are
starting to invest again."</TE>
<TE>   More evidence of a manufacturing rebound was provided by a survey
of Midwest purchasing managers. The managers' association said a
monthly index of business activity climbed to 54.3 in November from
45.9 in October. A reading above 50 is considered a sign of
expansion.</TE>
<TE>   In Hammond, Ind., the manufacturing recovery has not shown up in
the order books of Berlin Metals, a major supplier of sheet steel
used by makers of finished products. "I've seen neither a downturn
nor an improvement," President Roy Berlin said. "Things have been
relatively stable."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Berlin cited signs of change in his own
behavior. "I refinanced my house," he said. "I had a little extra
cash, so I spent a little of it. I bought some furniture. I bought a
new DVD player. So I'm probably one of those guys who helped the
economy a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   There were even signs of hope on the employment front, where
economic recoveries are generally slow to produce tangible results.
First-time claims for unemployment benefits declined to 364,000 last
week, the lowest level since February 2001, the Labor Department
said.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Vitner, senior economist with Wachovia Corp. in Charlotte,
N.C., said the new statistics indicate the economy's weakness during
the fall was attributable primarily to temporary factors. They
include the 10-day West Coast port lockout that ended Oct. 9, a spate
of severe weather, the Washington area sniper attacks and a
Securities and Exchange Commission crackdown on corporate accounting,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "All of those things worked together to slow new factory orders
and reduce hiring, and now they've been largely cleared up," Vitner
said. "We've moved past that temporary lull in the economy."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, some analysts interpreted the latest soundings with
caution, noting that not all of the numbers were positive. A cautious
Federal Reserve report on Wednesday said the economy "grew slowly, on
balance, in late October and early November."</TE>
<TE>   Also, the Conference Board's help-wanted advertising index fell to
40 in October, the lowest level since February 1964.</TE>
<TE>   "There are still some dark tints to the data," said Mark Zandi,
chief economist at Economy.com, a Philadelphia-area consulting firm.
"Firing may have abated a bit, but hiring hasn't yet picked up. We
need to see some hiring soon, otherwise consumers may pull back and
the recovery may falter."</TE>

<HD>Guess Founder May Sell Shares</HD>
<DH>Trust controlled by Armand Marciano seeks to divest his
nearly 15% stake in the firm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Debora Vrana</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fashion jean designer and retailer Guess Inc. said Wednesday that
co-founder Armand Marciano may sell most of his nearly 15% stake in
the Los Angeles company after going on medical leave.</LD>
<LD>   The move is unlikely to mean a major ownership shake-up for Guess,
which is controlled by Maurice, Paul and Armand Marciano, the three
brothers who collectively own about 80% of the firm's stock,
according to company officials.</LD>
<LD>   Founded in 1981, Guess is one of the nation's premier clothing
brands and designs, markets and licenses apparel, accessories and
other fashion merchandise. It has more than 4,000 employees.</LD>
<TE>   A trust controlled by Armand Marciano, the oldest of the brothers,
requested that the company file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission to sell 6.49 million shares owned by the trust, Guess
said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not going to change anything in the business," said
Carlos Alberini, president and chief operating officer of Guess. He
did not elaborate on Armand Marciano's illness.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nothing serious. Hopefully, he will get better soon and be
back," Alberini said.</TE>
<TE>   He said a replacement will be named to take over for Armand
Marciano, a senior executive vice president who oversees distribution
in Los Angeles and a new distribution center being built in Kentucky.
He is expected to return from his leave in March, Alberini said.</TE>
<TE>   Armand Marciano recently put his Mediterranean-style villa in
Beverly Hills on the market for $8.9 million because he and his wife,
Marie, are moving to a new house, which took seven years to build.</TE>
<TE>   Guess made the announcement after the stock markets closed. Its
shares rose 29 cents to $5.45 in New York Stock Exchange trading on
Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Enquirer Owner to Buy Weider Publications</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Holly M. Sanders</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>American Media Inc., owner of the National Enquirer and the Star,
said Wednesday that it would buy fitness publisher Weider
Publications for $350 million to expand into consumer magazines.</LD>
<LD>   Boca Raton, Fla.-based American Media, which has pursued Weider
since September, would gain seven magazines, including Shape, Flex
and Men's Fitness. The transaction, expected to close in the first
quarter, would add immediately to American Media's earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Annual revenue would
grow to $550 million from $375 million, the firm said.</LD>
<LD>   Closely held Weider, based in Woodland Hills, was founded more
than 60 years ago by bodybuilder Joe Weider.</LD>
<TE>   The purchase doesn't include Weider Nutrition International Inc.,
a vitamin and nutritional supplement business that is publicly
traded.</TE>
<TE>   American Media is building a consumer magazine division as
circulation declines at its tabloids. The company reported this month
that tabloid sales fell 4% in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Higher prices and more advertising have helped newsstand sales,
the company said.</TE>
<TE>   "The good thing is they have been able to raise prices and people
are still buying," said Matthew Cox, an analyst for KDP Investment
Advisors Inc. "But there's not a lot of growth potential there."</TE>

<HD>Stocks Stage Rebound Amid Upbeat Reports</HD>
<DH>Dow surges 255 points as portfolio managers jump aboard the
rally.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street bounced back Wednesday, more than recouping the previous
day's losses, as a string of upbeat economic reports helped the
market regain its recent momentum.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow industrials, which tumbled 173 points Tuesday, rose more
than 250 points, and other indexes staged equally strong rebounds.
The surge was fueled not only by the day's economic news, analysts
said, but also by portfolio managers jumping aboard the rally in an
effort to trim their losses before year's end.</LD>
<LD>   "Mutual fund managers are behind their benchmarks," said Russ
Koesterich, equity strategist at State Street Global Markets.
"Everyone is playing catch-up, trying to make up as much ground as
possible. They're chasing momentum."</LD>
<TE>   The Dow jumped 255.26 points, or 2.9%, to 8,931.68; the broader
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index rose 25.56 points, or 2.8%, to 938.87;
and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite gained 43.51 points, or 3%, to
1,487.94.</TE>
<TE>   Winners swamped losers by about 3 to 1 on the New York Stock
Exchange and Nasdaq. Volume, although not heavy, was solid for a day
that traditionally features light trading. Markets are closed today
for Thanksgiving and will close early Friday, at 10 a.m. PST.</TE>
<TE>   Investors were encouraged by the government's report that
consumers increased their spending in October, reversing September's
drop and slightly exceeding expectations. Retail stocks got a lift,
including Home Depot, up $1.07 to $26.09; Best Buy, up $1.41 to
$27.03; and Target, up $1.72 to $35.30.</TE>
<TE>   Positive reports on new jobless-benefit claims, durable-goods
orders during October and manufacturing activity in the Midwest this
month were taken as further evidence of a rebounding economy.</TE>
<TE>   "The numbers suggest the economy is indeed resilient and the
consumer has stayed on track where spending is concerned," said Kevin
Caron, strategist at Ryan, Beck &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts also attributed the day's equity gains to "short
covering," in which traders with bearish bets scramble to buy shares
to minimize their losses, adding juice to a rally.</TE>
<TE>   Koesterich said simple momentum has played a pivotal role in the
rally since stock indexes sank Oct. 9 to five-year lows: Portfolio
managers have been buying volatile, rising stocks regardless of
fundamentals, he said, so as not to be left behind.</TE>
<TE>   Momentum buying could fuel further gains before year's end, even
though many money managers still fear this move is just another sharp
bounce within the bear market that began in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   But major indexes are approaching key levels. The S&amp;P 500 has
climbed 20.9% since early October. If it rises more than 21.4%, the
gain will exceed the best advance of any of the previous rallies
since the bear market began.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the most volatile stocks already have doubled or tripled
in the current surge. Telecom equipment maker Corning, for example,
which rose 37 cents on Wednesday to $4.12, has zoomed 270% in seven
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Money managers are desperate to avoid notching a third consecutive
losing year, Koesterich said. Even with the recent gains, that will
be a tough feat for many. The average U.S. stock fund was down 18.9%
year to date through Tuesday, according to data tracker Morningstar.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, bond yields rose as Wednesday's stock surge and
economic reports encouraged investors to shift assets out of
fixed-income securities.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Semiconductor equipment maker Novellus Systems shot up $2.95 to
$37.43, sparking a rally in the chip sector, after saying
fourth-quarter orders seem to be improving. The SOX index of chip
stocks surged 6.7%.</TE>
<TE>   * Eli Lilly jumped $5 to $69 after regulators approved two of its
drugs and Standard &amp; Poor's upgraded its rating on the stock to "buy"
from "hold." Elsewhere in the drug sector, Transkaryotic Therapies
plunged $4.70 to $9.56 after saying its kidney disease treatment was
disappointing in early trials.</TE>
<TE>   * Better-than-expected profit reports boosted several stocks,
including Michaels Stores, up $3.71 to $38.61, and Hughes Supply, up
$1.30 to $32.65. But Dollar General slid $1.20 to $12.86 after
falling shy of third-quarter expectations.</TE>

<HD>San Diego, Russian Firms Shoot for the Moon in a Race to
Profit in Space</HD>
<DH>TransOrbital is selling room aboard a craft for photographs
and personal messages.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J. Michael Kennedy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a 30-year hiatus, the United States looks to be going to the
moon again.</LD>
<LD>   Only this time, the government will have nothing to do with it.
And instead of trying to touch down gently on the lunar surface, the
idea now is to crash the craft, scattering business cards and
bric-a-brac everywhere.</LD>
<LD>   San Diego-based TransOrbital Inc. came one step closer to its
long-planned moon mission Tuesday when it signed a $20-million
contract with Russian space company Kosmotras. The deal calls for a
test flight that will blast off from the former Soviet republic of
Kazakhstan and put a satellite into Earth orbit Dec. 20. The launch
vehicle will be a mothballed rocket that once carried nuclear
warheads aimed at U.S. targets.</LD>
<TE>   TransOrbital President Dennis Laurie said the actual moon shot,
scheduled for October 2003, would cost about $40 million.</TE>
<TE>   The point of the mission? Profit.</TE>
<TE>   TransOrbital is selling space aboard the moon-bound spacecraft --
not for people but for items such as business cards, photos or
personal messages at $2,500 a gram. The craft also will carry a list
of people who have staked "claims" to lunar acreage.</TE>
<TE>   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration declined to
comment on the Trans- Orbital project. But NASA officials have been
critical of the company in the past, accusing TransOrbital of "taking
pot shots at the moon" and possibly causing "ethical and ecological"
problems.</TE>
<TE>   If successful, TransOrbital would become the first commercial
venture to go to the moon. Backers say it could open the floodgates
to business ventures there, ranging from a resting place for cremated
remains to a luxurious vacation spot for the very rich.</TE>
<TE>   Other lunar advocates talk of the moon as the ultimate depository
of knowledge, to guard against a time when a cataclysmic event might
wipe out life on Earth.</TE>
<TE>   They also speak of the moon as the perfect place to train space
travelers as they prepare to explore even deeper into the universe.</TE>
<TE>   "My estimate is that in eight to 10 years, you should have tours
going to the moon," said Laurie, who came on board the project two
years ago. "It doesn't take any longer to go to the moon than it does
to drive across the country."</TE>
<TE>   But there are serious doubters, among them former astronaut and
moon walker Alan Bean, who called the venture nothing more than a
"pipe dream."</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way to make any money going to the moon and back,"
said Bean, who makes a portion of his living painting moonscapes.
"Someday, it will be an excellent business, but not now. If you do it
once it would be nice, but there's no way to recover the costs.
Someday there will be traffic between us and the moon, but it's
probably 200 or 300 years away."</TE>
<TE>   In 1969, the United States became the first nation to put men on
the moon. But manned moon exploration stopped three years later, and
no one has been to Earth's satellite for the 30 years. Part of the
reason has been that NASA has set different priorities since then and
has virtually written off the moon as a lifeless body that needs no
further exploration.</TE>
<TE>   In short, been there, done that.</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, remain infatuated with the idea of eventually
colonizing the moon, then spreading mankind to the outer reaches of
space.</TE>
<TE>   "Think of the government as the Lewis and Clark of space," said
Rick Tumlinson, founder of the Space Frontier Foundation, an
organization whose members are proponents of space settlement. "Now
it's time to hand off to the settlers and shopkeepers that will make
it a new domain."</TE>
<TE>   Commercial space flight is not new. Satellites by the dozen circle
Earth, performing tasks that include communication and spying. But
all the commercial rocket launches have been for orbital work, not
landing anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   "Admittedly, there is a pretty high giggle factor to the project,"
said Paul Blase, chief technical officer for TransOrbital.</TE>
<TE>   Blase, who is based in Trans- Orbital's Virginia office, said the
project began when he and several others teamed up via the Internet
to discuss what kind of moon mission could be commercially viable. He
said the launch will take place in Kazakhstan because the Russians
offered the lowest price quote.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the business cards and other cargo, the satellite, called
Trailblazer, will orbit the moon for three months. One project will
be to map the surface using high-definition cameras. It also will
attempt to photograph hardware left over from U.S. and Russian space
missions.</TE>
<TE>   Blase said the most difficult part of the project was obtaining
clearances from U.S. officials. The State Department had to be
convinced that the project would not export valuable technology to
the Russians.</TE>
<TE>   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration needed, among
other things, assurances that the lunar module and its contents would
not contaminate the moon. The process of getting through both
bureaucracies took two years before final approval was granted in
September.</TE>
<TE>   "The big breakthrough was when we finally got the export license,"
Blase said. "With that, it turns from a wild idea to something that
may be feasible. It's the legislative and procedural barriers that
are the hardest to overcome."</TE>
<TE>   Laurie said the company has "thousands" of orders already, with
some people asking about sending cremated remains to the moon.
"They'd like to have some part of a family member in a place that
they can see every day," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Laurie said that at one point he was contacted by a representative
of a prominent Middle Eastern family. The request: to transport a
chair to the moon.</TE>
<TE>   "It turned out that it was a throne, not a chair," Laurie said.
"We had to pass on that one."</TE>
<TE>   One thing the satellite is set to transport is a compact disc
containing the names of people who have purchased land on the moon
from Dennis Hope, who laid claim in a clever entrepreneurial move to
all the known planets and moons in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, he has been busy selling land on those celestial
bodies for $19.99 an acre. He's also been selling space on the disc
that will be sent on the first mission.</TE>
<TE>   Hope, who calls himself the Head Cheese, said actually having
their names on the moon strengthens buyers' claims of ownership.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a claim of property with the intent to occupy," Hope said,
deadpan.</TE>
<TE>   TransOrbital isn't the only company that wants to go to the moon.</TE>
<TE>   LunaCorp hopes to have its own orbiter by as early as 2005. It
scored something of a coup recently when it negotiated a deal for
Radio Shack to film a commercial at the International Space Station.
But David Gump, the company president, said the major difficulty in
the space business is the tremendous cost.</TE>
<TE>   "Money's tight," he said. "Space suffers from the fact that most
projects have at least two more zeroes than sponsors want to pay."</TE>
<TE>   For TransOrbital, an even bigger headache may be the fallout that
would come when its satellite slammed into the moon.</TE>
<TE>   NASA received a lot of criticism when its last probe, the Lunar
Prospector, mapped the moon in 1998 and then crashed into it. That
apparently upset the Navajo Nation, which holds the moon sacred.</TE>

<HD>Roxio Completes Purchase of Napster System</HD>
<DH>The $5-million sale is approved after judge dismissed
last-minute objections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joseph Menn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The brand name, Web site and technology of pioneering file-swapping
service Napster Inc. were sold to Silicon Valley software firm Roxio
Inc. on Wednesday after a bankruptcy judge dismissed an unorthodox
last-minute objection by Napster's first boss.</LD>
<LD>   Record labels and other creditors will no doubt fight over the
sale proceeds and may pursue legal means to collect more money, but
the sale essentially ends the brief, dramatic life of Napster Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Napster's system, the first to popularize technology known as
peer-to-peer, connected tens of millions of computer users who
swapped digital song files for free.</LD>
<TE>   Roxio made minor changes to the purchase arrangement to overcome
objections by Napster creditors during a daylong hearing and then
closed the sale for $5 million in cash and warrants to buy 100,000
Roxio shares. It will put something on the Napster.com site soon,
with details about its plans due in the next few months.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very, very happy about this," said Roxio General Counsel
Bill Growney.</TE>
<TE>   Shares in Roxio, which makes software for recording compact discs
from music stored on computers, rose 9 cents to $5.37 on Nasdaq
before the ruling, which came after the close of regular trading.</TE>
<TE>   The record labels won a series of court rulings against Napster,
and the company wasn't able to release a system that allowed for
payments to copyright holders before it filed for bankruptcy in June.
Successor networks are less centralized and have been difficult to
attack legally, spawning a raft of proposed federal legislation and
new digital rights technology.</TE>
<TE>   Napster's sudden and controversial rise made the software's
principal author, Shawn Fanning, now 22, a household name. But it was
his uncle John Fanning who had registered the Napster.com,
Napster.net and Napster.org domain names, incorporated Napster Inc.,
and kept majority control in its first months.</TE>
<TE>   Fanning tried to block the sale to Roxio this week by saying he
still owned some of Napster's assets.</TE>
<TE>   In a Wilmington, Del., Bankruptcy Court filing Monday, Fanning
argued that he had never executed an agreement transferring the
rights to Napster's Internet addresses when he formed the company in
May 1999. And he said that even if he had, it was a temporary license
that should have expired when Napster filed for bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Fanning said he never signed an asset-transfer agreement
drafted around the time of Napster's main venture financing round in
May 2000. He said that a signature page of another document from
months earlier had been improperly substituted.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Fanning never entered into any valid and binding agreement
with Napster or any other debtors to assign to sell the intellectual
property sought," Fanning wrote. "Mr. Fanning remains the rightful
owner of the domain names."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to Fanning's previous filing in the bankruptcy case,
which described him as the "reputed owner" of the Napster.net domain
name and the Napster logo, no lawyer submitted Monday's document on
Fanning's behalf. Fanning signed the six-page document himself.</TE>
<TE>   But Fanning did not appear in court Wednesday, leaving his lawyer,
Robert Wilcox, with no witnesses to back up the claims.</TE>
<TE>   "The judge was not very happy about his attorney showing up
without a witness," said Rick Chance, an investment banker who
testified Wednesday on his efforts to sell Napster's assets.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Peter Walsh also asked why Fanning hadn't objected earlier,
when Napster's assets were nearly sold to German media firm
Bertelsmann. Noting that there was substantial evidence that Fanning
had signed the documents in question, Walsh ultimately ruled that the
sale to Roxio could proceed.</TE>

<KH>HOLIDAY SHOPPING 2002</KH>
<HD>Banking on the Promotions</HD>
<DH>Retailers try just about everything to get customers into
the stores this season</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Leslie Earnest</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Using sex, cheap champagne and bargain-priced bracelets as bait,
retailers around California and across the country are hoping to lure
consumers out of the shopping doldrums and into stores this holiday
season.</LD>
<LD>   A year ago, retail industry experts were calling the 2001 holiday
season the most promotional ever. But many now say this year could be
even more intense as consumers remain reticent about spending, the
prospect of war with Iraq looms and a calendar shift has trimmed
almost a week from the number of shopping days between Thanksgiving
and Christmas.</LD>
<LD>   Predicting sales is tricky because consumers can react emotionally
to economic news, good or bad, and to world events. After the
terrorist attacks stunned the nation last year, analysts were
downbeat about the holidays, but shoppers picked up the pace.
November and December sales rose a combined 5.6% compared with sales
in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   This year, the National Retail Federation predicts that sales will
rise 4% during the holiday shopping season, which officially launches
Friday. That would be the smallest increase in five years.</TE>
<TE>   Snagging consumers early has become increasingly important because
people now shop in only half as many stores during the holiday season
as they did five years ago. But once consumers visit a store, they
usually return before Christmas, said Britt Beemer, a consumer
behavior expert.</TE>
<TE>   Scrambling to get ahead of the pack, retailers are trying a gamut
of promotions to lure shoppers.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco-based Gap Inc., the nation's largest specialty
retailer, mailed out "mystery holiday cards" for the first time this
year, promising discounts worth "up to $100," while withholding the
exact amount until the shopper gets in the store. The least valuable
cards will take $5 off a purchase, Gap says.</TE>
<TE>   Wet Seal Inc., an Orange County company that sells trendy clothes
to girls and young women, is promising free two-way pagers to
customers who spend at least $35 in its stores over the Thanksgiving
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Pushing the envelope a little further will be Abercrombie &amp; Fitch.
The youth-apparel merchant is reportedly planning to trot out male
models stripped down to their underwear to greet customers when they
enter some A&amp;F stores.</TE>
<TE>   Lingerie retailer Victoria's Secret used the opposite sex to tempt
buyers, with a prime-time display of scantily clad women during a
televised fashion show last week. And Frederick's of Hollywood has
rolled out catalogs featuring Santa teddies and red velvet bras with
jingle bells on the cups.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Hayward, Calif.-based discount retailer Mervyn's, a
division of Target Corp., is hoping to plant itself in shoppers'
psyches with an ad campaign that begins today featuring photographer
William Wegman's Weimaraners -- the chocolate-colored, floppy-earned
hounds -- dressed in Mervyn's clothes.</TE>
<TE>   "What we hope to do is cement in their minds that Mervyn's is a
fun place to shop," said Steve Moylan, group manager of marketing,
planning and operations.</TE>
<TE>   In a tactic that seems to be working, Stein Mart Inc., a
Florida-based gift chain that is beefing up its presence in Southern
California, is selling diamond bracelets for $19.99. The diamonds are
so tiny that the company has to call them "diamond accents," said
Gwen Manto, chief merchandising officer for the discount retailer.
Stein Mart can't make a profit, she noted, unless shoppers who buy
the bracelets also buy something else.</TE>
<TE>   "You hate to call it a loss leader, but we sell it below our
typical profit margin," Manto said. "If we can get them in our stores
and we have the right things, then we'll win."</TE>
<TE>   At the Stein Mart in Huntington Beach, customers snapped up the
bracelets so quickly that manager Jacqui Spates-Teston had to hold
back a handful -- and borrow 40 from another store -- so she'd have
some left to sell on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "I was lucky to get what I could off the floor," Spates-Teston
said. "I've never seen such a hot item."</TE>
<TE>   Besides trinkets and other promotions, experts say, good prices
also will be needed to attract shoppers.</TE>
<TE>   "Retailers are going to find out this year, probably more than any
other year, you've got to give the customer exceptional values," said
Beemer, chairman of market analysis firm America's Research Group.
"Consumers have not been in the spirit to want to spend a lot of
money."</TE>
<TE>   Although discounts can hurt retailers' profits -- and did in the
third quarter -- the effect has been buffered somewhat because
wholesale prices on many items have been declining, said Michael
Niemira, a senior economist with Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.</TE>
<TE>   Apparel prices dropped 1% to 2% this year compared with last year,
and prices on other items, such as radios and televisions, have
declined much more, he pointed out.</TE>
<TE>   Beemer suggested, however, that some retailers may delay too long
before offering consumers the kinds of deals they're hungry for. "I'm
afraid they're going to try to wait till the last weekend or two to
give the customer real bargains," he said, "and if they do, we're
going to have a disastrous Christmas."</TE>
<TE>   Almost 80% of consumers queried in a recent American Express
survey said they would do some holiday shopping at mass
merchandisers, such as Wal-Mart and Target, this year. And 86% said
their shopping decisions would be driven by sales, spokeswoman Joanne
Fisher said.</TE>
<TE>   "Among those people surfing the Internet, there's an even higher
incidence of bargain hunting," she said. Of the online shoppers
questioned, 95% said they had been surfing for low prices. Further,
65% of those surveyed said they would set up a budget this year, up
from 60% last year.</TE>
<TE>   Warehouse stores, such as Costco Wholesale Corp. and Sam's Club,
also are increasingly attracting holiday shoppers.</TE>
<TE>   Costco says it doesn't advertise or slash prices during the
holidays because the store's prices already are low. But it has
stocked up on its best sellers, including clothes, TV sets and
barbecue grills.</TE>
<TE>   "At any one time, we've probably got about 30% more apparel on the
floor than we did last year," said Bruce Greenwood, senior vice
president of the Los Angeles region.</TE>
<TE>   Explaining how abundance can serve as a sort of in-store
promotion, Greenwood said one Costco recently heaped eight pallets
with Levis and sold $27,000 worth of the jeans in a week.</TE>
<TE>   "We think [shoppers] look at it and say, 'If they have that much
out, they must sell a lot and it must be a good deal and I'm buying a
pair,' " Greenwood explained. "It makes it more impulsive."</TE>
<TE>   Greenwood expects that established Costco stores in this region
will see an 8% sales increase in November and December compared with
last year.</TE>
<TE>   One product that Costco anticipates moving briskly in Southern
California is Dom Perignon champagne, which it sells for $79 a
bottle, about a third off the regular retail price. In fact,
frills-free Costco sells more Dom Perignon than any other retailer,
according to Greenwood, and the L.A. area accounts for 35% of its
sales.</TE>

<HD>California Regulator Draws Fire for Dissent</HD>
<DH>States' securities officials say Boutris signed off on key
elements of analysts deal he is criticizing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas S. Mulligan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A tussle between state regulators intensified Wednesday as some of
those negotiating a settlement over Wall Street analysts' conflicts
of interest openly criticized California's top securities cop for
speaking out against the proposed deal.</LD>
<LD>   A key negotiator for the state regulators, Maine's Christine
Bruenn, said she was "taken aback" by Demetrios A. Boutris' public
questioning this week of the proposed accord because his own staff
had signed off on the key elements.</LD>
<LD>   Bruenn is president of the North American Securities
Administrators Assn. and a member of the group negotiating a
settlement with a dozen Wall Street brokerages that is expected to
result in fines of more than $1 billion against the firms. The group
includes states' securities regulators and representatives of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the New York Stock Exchange and
the NASD (formerly the National Assn. of Securities Dealers).</LD>
<TE>   "I was with their representative on Monday, and they [California
officials] were in full agreement with the negotiating position we
had taken," Bruenn said in an interview Wednesday. Sources have said
that most of the companies are being asked to pay fines ranging from
$25 million to $75 million, with Citigroup Inc. and Credit Suisse
First Boston paying considerably more.</TE>
<TE>   However, Boutris told The Times on Monday that the proposed
settlement was too lenient and that every firm included in the deal
should pay at least $100 million in cash penalties. Boutris,
commissioner of the state's Department of Corporations, reiterated
the position Tuesday in news interviews.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just really surprised," Bruenn said. "This negotiating
position in public isn't the same as we were hearing in private." She
declined to discuss the firms or dollar amounts involved.</TE>
<TE>   Boutris, through a spokeswoman, declined to comment on Bruenn's
remarks. However, his top deputy, William Kenefick, said Wednesday
that he and his boss believed all along that penalty amounts being
discussed for some firms were too low.</TE>
<TE>   In a conference call last weekend with Bruenn and other
regulators, Kenefick said, he was asked to make "an accommodation"
regarding one specific investment bank. "I said, 'OK, $75 million --
firm,' " he recalled. Ultimately, Kenefick added, "we weren't getting
any support for that," and the issue was dropped.</TE>
<TE>   Bruenn and other regulators were surprised to hear Boutris then
declare that $100 million ought to be the minimum.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think California's position at all represents the
mainstream in these negotiations," Indiana Securities Commissioner
Bradley Skolnik said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer, whose initial
investigation of conflicts at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and other Wall
Street firms paved the way for the states' effort, also distanced his
office from Boutris' position.</TE>
<TE>   Despite California's opposition, "There is tremendous consensus
for a 'global' settlement," Spitzer's spokeswoman, Juanita Scarlett,
said.</TE>
<TE>   Even as Boutris was leveling his criticism this week, a spokesman
for his office said California wasn't considering withdrawing from
the settlement or taking steps to derail it.</TE>
<TE>   It would be difficult to reach a truly comprehensive agreement
without California's participation, one regulator said Wednesday, in
part because the brokerage firms may balk at a deal that leaves them
open to more strictures and cash penalties from the nation's
most-populous state.</TE>
<TE>   Other state regulators were cautiously optimistic that California
ultimately would join the fold. They said it would be expensive and
risky for the state to undertake its own investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Big as it is, they said, California probably would lack the
negotiating clout to get more money on its own than it could win as a
share of the global settlement.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, California long has been regarded as a maverick
in its dealings with other state regulatory agencies, one state
securities chief said.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, he conceded, Boutris' contrarian position could
ultimately result in the Wall Street firms paying more money into the
settlement pot.</TE>

<HD>Universal Music to Redo Royalties</HD>
<DH>Firm becomes second to respond to concerns about the
industry's accounting practices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chuck Philips</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Universal Music Group is planning to revamp its royalty accounting
process, becoming the second major record corporation in less than a
month to respond to artists' concerns about whether they are being
shortchanged by their labels.</LD>
<LD>   Universal executives declined to comment Wednesday. But sources
said part of the royalty proposal goes even further than one
introduced last week by Bertelsmann Music Group, which was aimed at
eliminating outdated deductions to clarify the accounting process.</LD>
<LD>   According to an internal memo, first reported Wednesday in the
Wall Street Journal, Universal will now give auditors for artists
access to manufacturing documents.</LD>
<TE>   Record labels previously had barred artists from examining such
records. Audits were limited to royalty statements only.</TE>
<TE>   Various acts have accused their labels of selling albums
manufactured overseas but not accounted for in royalty statements.</TE>
<TE>   "Our contracts require us to pay artists on records sold, not
manufactured, and we have always provided auditors with all necessary
books and records to determine those sales," said the memo, dated
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "However, it became clear to us that not making manufacturing
records available is causing unnecessary suspicion and adding a
negative perception," the memo said.</TE>
<TE>   Other changes expected to go into effect at Universal, according
to the memo, are:</TE>
<TE>   * The size of the audit staff will be doubled, allowing the
company to be more responsive to issues raised by artists.</TE>
<TE>   * Royalty workshops will be held twice a year to help artists
familiarize themselves with their royalty statements.</TE>
<TE>   * A bevy of contract restrictions that hamper an artist's ability
to audit a label's books and records will be waived.</TE>
<TE>   "We are dedicated to building stronger ties and relationships with
our artists, and, to that end, we have begun a series of meetings
with major auditors to establish a dialogue in order to understand
what we can do to improve our systems and the auditing process," the
memo said.</TE>
<TE>   "While there are undoubtedly times where there may be inadvertent
errors in the [royalty] statement, we do our best to always ensure
that our artists are paid accurately and in a timely fashion
according to terms of their contracts," the memo continued. "In the
overwhelming number of cases, we succeed."</TE>
<TE>   The changes at Universal, like those at BMG, come as lawmakers in
California and New York have begun to scrutinize complaints from
recording artists about questionable accounting practices in the
industry.</TE>
<TE>   There also have been a number of lawsuits, including one recently
settled by singer Courtney Love.</TE>
<TE>   "After listening to outside auditors and testimony at legislative
hearings, we have decided to initiate a number of changes in our
royalty reporting process to make it more efficient, responsive and
easier to understand," the Universal memo said.</TE>
<TE>   Among Universal's top acts are Eminem, No Doubt and Jay-Z.</TE>

<HD>Lilly Sues to Block Osteoporosis Generic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eli Lilly &amp; Co. filed a lawsuit seeking to block Barr Laboratories
Inc. from selling a generic form of Lilly's osteoporosis drug Evista,
which had about $665 million in sales last year.</LD>
<LD>   Pomona, N.Y.-based Barr filed for Food and Drug Administration
approval to make a generic form of Evista in June, and notified Lilly
in October.</LD>
<LD>   Lilly, in a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday in its Indianapolis
hometown, said the generic treatment would infringe four patents
related to the drug.</LD>
<TE>   Lilly has said that its patents can protect its U.S. rights until
at least 2012. Barr contends the Evista patents are invalid or
wouldn't be infringed by its version of medication.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Lilly were up $5, or 7.8%, at $69 on the NYSE after the
FDA approved the drugs Strattera for attention-deficit disorder and
Forteo, a bone-building drug designed to help prevent fractures in
osteoporosis patients. Barr shares rose $1.20 to $66.12, on the NYSE.</TE>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Transkaryotic Therapies Inc. said a study showed its Replagal
medicine doesn't improve kidney function in patients with a rare
metabolic condition. Transkaryotic shares tumbled as much as 41%.</LD>
<LD>   The biotechnology company's test found no difference between
Replagal and a placebo in patients with the hereditary disorder
called Fabry disease. The condition, which destroys major organs and
causes severe pain, affects about 5,000 people worldwide.</LD>
<LD>   The findings are a second setback in Transkaryotic's race against
Genzyme Corp. to win the first U.S. approval for a Fabry drug.
Transkaryotic shares tumbled 62% on Oct. 3, when regulators said a
test of Replagal's effects on pain wasn't enough to merit clearance.</LD>
<TE>   Transkaryotic shares fell $4.66 to $9.60 on Nasdaq after falling
to a record low of $8.41.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Tariff Plan Raises Concerns</HD>
<DH>Some countries and industries say they have little to gain
from the proposal to eliminate levies on manufactured products by
2015.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Blair Pethel</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. proposal to end tariffs on manufactured products by 2015 may
meet resistance from countries and industries that see little gain
for the sacrifice.</LD>
<LD>   Poor countries that need tariff revenue and want to export more
agricultural goods say the United States, Japan and European Union
need to end protections for their farmers first. Makers of protected
U.S. goods such as textiles and trucks say ending trade barriers
other than tariffs must take precedence.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal probably will revive talks at the World Trade
Organization on opening global markets for industrial goods, services
and farm products, a spokesman for the Geneva-based organization
said.</LD>
<TE>   "It's very ambitious," said Keith Rockwell, spokesman for WTO
Director General Supachai Panitchpakdi. "Some developing countries
will have a problem with this, but it's equally true that even those
countries critical of this proposal would benefit greatly from
enhanced access to the U.S. market."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick said Tuesday that the
United States will cut to zero its tariffs on everything from apparel
and electrical goods to furniture and consumer housewares by 2015 as
long as the 143 other members of the WTO agreed to do the same.</TE>
<TE>   Rubens Barbosa, Brazil's ambassador to the U.S., was guarded about
the proposal, saying the details are what matter.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have thought there would be in the proposal something
related to the developing countries," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The November 2001 declaration in Doha, Qatar, that launched the
WTO negotiations contains a paragraph that says "special
consideration" will be given to developing countries in negotiations
on industrial tariffs.</TE>
<TE>   "If the proposal is across the board, without taking this into
consideration, it will make our life difficult," Barbosa said.</TE>
<TE>   The average U.S. industrial tariff is 4%. In Brazil it's almost
20%, meaning his country will have to do more, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Gresser, a former official in the office of the U.S. trade
representative and now an analyst at the Democratic Party-backed
Progressive Policy Institute, said that's an unreasonable excuse.</TE>
<TE>   "If very, very poor countries have a problem because of lost
revenue, then they have legitimate concerns that should be
addressed," said Gresser, whose study this year detailing the
benefits of ending industrial tariffs was cited by Zoellick as one of
the motivating factors behind the U.S. plan.</TE>
<TE>   "For very big, wealthy economies -- Brazil, India -- it's probably
politically difficult, but I don't have that much sympathy with the
fiscal argument," he said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. industries that would lose protections also have reservations
about the tariff-elimination plan.</TE>
<TE>   Auggie Tantillo, Washington coordinator of the American Textile
Trade Action Committee, said the proposal does nothing to advance the
textile industry's interests abroad.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not tariffs for us so much, although they're important," he
said. "How is the U.S. going to address the nontariff barriers that
are being used to keep our products out?"</TE>
<TE>   Tantillo cited testing regimes in India and Pakistan, mandated
distribution systems in China, customs-clearance processes around the
world and other foreign impediments to U.S. apparel and textile
makers.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Reinsch, president of exporter group the National Foreign
Trade Council, said U.S. car and truck makers face the same problems.</TE>

<LD>One of Hollywood's biggest movie producers sued Universal Studios for
fraud Wednesday, alleging that he was cheated out of money on the
Kevin Spacey movie "K-Pax" because Universal botched the foreign
distribution of the film.</LD>
<LD>   Lawrence Gordon, whose films include "Die Hard" and "Field of
Dreams," claimed in Los Angeles Superior Court that Universal's
decision to involve a German tax shelter in the financing of "K-Pax"
meant that the movie had an incompetent foreign distributor,
"insuring that 'K-Pax' would not be properly exploited in the
international film market." Gordon alleges that the decision cost him
millions of dollars because his pay was tied to the film's
performance worldwide.</LD>
<LD>   A Universal spokeswoman said the studio does not comment on
pending litigation.</LD>
<TE>   German money once fueled many Hollywood projects, but began to dry
up when the stock prices of German media firms fell and the German
government soured on the tax breaks that made the deals attractive.</TE>

<DH>At Thanksgiving and Ramadan, let us celebrate peace.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diana Abu-Jaber</AU>
<BD>Diana Abu-Jaber is a writer in residence at Portland
State University. Her first novel, "Arabian Jazz," won the Oregon
Book award; her next novel, "Crescent," will be published by W.W.
Norton in April.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thanksgiving at our house means a roasted turkey, stuffed either with
breadcrumbs, celery and onions because my mother is American or with
rice, pine nuts and ground lamb because my father is Jordanian.</LD>
<LD>   From year to year, you never know which it will be. There are
bowls of creamy hummus next to the cranberry sauce, candied yams
beside stuffed grape leaves, vibrant green bean casserole, steaming
rounds of fresh pita, roasted chestnuts and smoky baba ghanouj.</LD>
<LD>   When more of our relatives lived in the United States,
Thanksgiving meant lots and lots of family, several generations
worth, from several countries. There were always visiting friends and
foreign exchange students that my Jordanian professor-uncle invited
because no one should miss out on such a good idea as Thanksgiving.</LD>
<TE>   We had a crowded table. In my father's culture -- which
understands the scarcity of the desert -- you feed your guests amply,
even if you go hungry; you offer bites of food from your own
fingertips; you tell the cook, "Bless your hand"; you urge everyone
to eat more and more, as much as they can; you tell them they're too
skinny.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Thanksgiving will be falling during the Muslim
monthlong celebration of Ramadan. Both events have to do with
recollection and celebration. The Muslims fast from sunrise till
sunset, my father says, to remind them of those who have no food, to
remind them to be compassionate and generous, to remind them to be
grateful. When you break the fast, you have a meal of celebration,
giving thanks for the plenty of the Earth, for divine grace.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes my life gets rushed and frantic and I forget to give
thanks, though in my heart I am grateful.</TE>
<TE>   This sort of Thanksgiving may sound familiar to many people,
especially to anyone from immigrant ancestors or who are themselves
immigrants. Everyone who has ever studied or felt close to another
culture, an older culture, will understand the joy of ancient ritual,
its graceful confluence with the rites of a newer world and the pride
we take in seeing them intermingle.</TE>
<TE>   When I enter Portland's newest, sprawling supermarket, I am
stunned by the profusion of beautiful, glimmering foods in every
aisle. It's undeniable how good it is to know there is enough, that
there are no economic sanctions, no shortages of food, medicine or
other necessities. I look at people shopping, chatting in a
bookstore, enjoying their coffee. I think: How good it is to talk, to
visit, to know that you and your children are safe, to live freely
and without fear. And I wonder what the mothers, sisters, sons and
grandfathers in Baghdad are feeling.</TE>
<TE>   This Thanksgiving, this Ramadan, I hope that we all feel gratitude
for what we have because that is what reminds us of what is most
important. I give thanks for bravery and nobility, for every time
that men and women -- elected representatives or private individuals
-- find the courage to defy political expectations or social pressure
to speak out on behalf of the innocent of the world.</TE>
<TE>   This month, Iraq's acceptance of the new U.N. resolution allowing
the return of weapons inspectors was an opening to clarity: I am
grateful for each chance we're given to avert war.</TE>
<TE>   I give thanks for every day in which someone stands up and says:
War is serious, debilitating, expensive; war compromises American
integrity and security the world over.</TE>
<TE>   This month, the London Guardian stated, "There is still no
evidence that Iraq presents an immediate threat to the rest of the
world." Now we have been given the opportunity to really test that
statement. Vague rumors, mistrust, innuendoes, dislike, biases,
grudges -- even revenge -- are unpleasant feelings, but they are not
sufficient reason for the terrible immensity of waging war. Donald
Rumsfeld's "the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence" is an
empty tautology when confronting the immensity of war. To be
provoked, war demands a shout in the face, not a whisper in the wind.</TE>
<TE>   This Ramadan, this Thanksgiving, I will remember those less
fortunate, and I will give thanks for the strength, wisdom and
compassion of the United States, and for this invitation that the
United States has been given.</TE>
<TE>   Only the weak lash out in fear and desperation, only the timid
agree with what they do not really believe, only the cowardly depend
on unjust and brutal force. And only the foolish would ever turn away
from a real prospect for peace.</TE>
<TE>   I give thanks that the United States, in its deepest heart, is
none of these things.</TE>

<DH>Relationships fray, nerves get raw. It's all part of a
precious beauty.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The other day, my daughter Jane, my son Sam and I set out to explore
an abandoned barn, about a mile away from our house, that we'd spied
from the street.</LD>
<LD>   It was quite a sweet autumn day in the hills of southern
Pennsylvania: temps in the 60s, ground soaked by a morning drizzle
and the leaves at their most saturated, in a continuum from the
deepest scarlet to yellow.</LD>
<LD>   We walked through the fallow fields and poked around the weathered
wood structure and the older, related stone foundations, peeked
inside at a couple of beat-up chicken coops and the layered remnants
of ancient hay and the rake that had been used to gather it.</LD>
<TE>   On that day, I found myself actually giving thanks, though I don't
know to whom, or even, exactly, for what.</TE>
<TE>   After all, Sammy tripped and kind of scraped his hand on a corn
stalk. We had to pick our way through a variety of trash: everything
from a six-pack of Smirnoff Ice empties -- left there perhaps by a
rural teenager nursing his baby alcoholism -- to a couple of '70s
Sprite bottles, broken. We heard a tractor, a dirt bike, a siren,
some gunshots.</TE>
<TE>   By the time we got there, Jane wanted to leave. She was tired,
maybe her diaper was wet. The grass was too high and she kept falling
down. She started crying.</TE>
<TE>   The edges of our lives are fraying. There's always a corner that's
coming unraveled while you work on the others. It costs 500 bucks
every time you take the car to the shop; you're leaking money. You
missed the dentist. Why does this thing jam all the time?</TE>
<TE>   Relationships fray, too. Your nerves get raw, your love gets
tarnished. The teenagers are irritated, and the toddler thinks its
funny to bash you with that block. Married people wear on one
another, or erode each other into something partial and
disintegrating.</TE>
<TE>   If we really want to give thanks for being alive in this world,
we've got to figure out a way to make its and our disintegration part
of what we love. If we love the world only here and there and in
spite of its impurities, we don't love the world at all.</TE>
<TE>   There is beauty in purity: of the austere mathematical equation or
Greek sculpture, of virginity and virtue. But there is a beauty, too,
that arises in use, a beauty of things that, like us, become and are
constantly in the process of slipping away into time, like a tattered
flag into the wind, losing the thread.</TE>
<TE>   That is the beauty of Billie Holiday's voice, wearing thin with
pain but still surrounding a center of intense life. It's the useful
beauty of the hay rake, rusted almost black, that we saw in that
barn. It's the round of Jane's life -- eating, fussing, falling,
making a mess, sleeping, losing a toy, retreating in pleasure to her
mother's lap, playing, dancing, bathing.</TE>
<TE>   It's our stupidities, our arbitrariness, the jaggedness of our
edges, our mixed feelings about ourselves, our incompleteness. It's
the beauty of the leaves today, further into the autumn, stripped
trees on the rises, the rest of the foliage merging toward yellow
brown, and falling.</TE>
<TE>   And it's our love for each other that each irritation weathers,
that is carved into our faces now, that knows too much. The fraying
fabric, faded, is lovely too: What we've lost is lovely, but so is
what remains and keeps giving itself over -- abandoning itself not
ecstatically, but steadily -- what, in us, keeps disintegrating into
one another.</TE>

<HD>Big Food Has Become a Big Problem</HD>
<DH>Politicians and health officials must address pandemic
obesity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ellen Ruppel Shell</AU>
<BD>Ellen Ruppel Shell, author of "The Hungry Gene: The
Science of Fat and the Future of Thin" (Atlantic Month Press, 2002),
is co-director of the Knight Center for Science and Medical
Journalism at Boston University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Al Roker, the amiable "Today" show weatherman, and Rep. Jerrold
Nadler, a Manhattan Democrat, recently revealed that they had
undergone stomach-reduction surgery for their morbid obesity. They
had struggled with obesity all their lives and had tried many
remedies without success. So they each took extreme surgical measures
because, like an increasing number of Americans, they saw no
alternative.</LD>
<LD>   Each year, obesity claims about 300,000 American lives and soaks
up about $120 billion in health-care costs. Yet, as a nation, we have
done almost nothing to combat it.</LD>
<LD>   That Nadler's twin brother is also obese is not surprising.
Scientists have known for decades that obesity has an important
genetic component, a fact made irrefutable by the discovery of the
obese gene at Rockefeller University in 1994. Subsequent research
points to the increasing role of genetic factors.</LD>
<TE>   Yet with more than 30% of Americans obese and fully two-thirds
overweight, we continue to consider obesity a lifestyle choice rather
than the public health disaster it has so clearly become.</TE>
<TE>   Gastric bypass surgery is increasingly being performed on
children, a practice whose potentially dangerous consequences are
unknown. What we do know is that American children are becoming
overweight and obese at an alarming rate, with fully 15% in the
danger zone. As a consequence, obesity-linked disorders are
increasingly common in the young, among them Type II diabetes, a
devastating and costly disorder that until just a couple of decades
ago was almost unheard of in children.</TE>
<TE>   In "Illness as Metaphor," Susan Sontag wrote: "Any important
disease whose causality is murky, and for which treatment is
ineffectual, tends to be awash in significance." Obesity fits the
bill. Mythology shrouding the disorder has muffled sensible discourse
and, until the past decade, stymied research.</TE>
<TE>   But in recent years, obesity science has exploded, offering
startling new insights into the genetic, prenatal and environmental
factors underlying body weight regulation. We now know that obesity
is the consequence of environment acting on genetic inclination, and
that genetic predisposition combined with an increasingly
"obesegenic" environment underlies the current pandemic.</TE>
<TE>   Some of us are more vulnerable to the environmental effects than
others, but none of us is immune.</TE>
<TE>   Anemic public service messages such as eat "five a day" (referring
to servings of vegetables and fruits) do little to counter the
temptations launched -- and aggressively marketed -- by a rabidly
competitive processed-food industry.</TE>
<TE>   Big Food is a cunning manipulator of public opinion,
characterizing its critics as a conspiracy of "food cops, vegetarian
activists and meddling bureaucrats" intent on using "junk science" to
build a "nanny state."</TE>
<TE>   But eating decisions, like all decisions, are molded by available
information. Advertising is by far the most potent source of
information when it comes to food. It's time to counter industry
influence with a vigorous public information campaign based on the
new science of appetite regulation.</TE>
<TE>   Big Food argues that Americans are free to make healthy food
choices, knowing full well that its incessant and cleverly designed
messages are dissuading a growing number of us from doing so.</TE>
<TE>   In the last decade, the restaurant and processed-food industries
have increased substantially the sugar and fat load of their
offerings. Cheap fat and sweeteners bulk up portion sizes, giving the
perception of value at very low cost to producers. The marketing of
these products, especially to children, has grown from vigorous to
relentless.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists now believe that eating large quantities of fat and
sweeteners may -- for at least some -- muffle biochemical signals
that tell the brain when we have eaten enough and that this effect is
magnified by a sedentary lifestyle. This effect is probably
genetically mediated, and some of us will feel the brunt of it more
than others.</TE>
<TE>   But as the food supply becomes increasingly rich, and our lives
increasingly sedentary, more and more of us will have difficulty
regulating our appetites and controlling our weight.</TE>
<TE>   By regulating food advertising to children and subsidizing the
production of fruits, vegetables and other unprocessed foods,
government could go far toward reversing this vicious cycle; studies
make clear that all of us make food choices based partially on cost.</TE>
<TE>   Obesity is not just an individual problem but a tragedy of the
commons. Getting a grip on this costly pandemic will require making
tough personal choices, certainly, but also tough public ones.
Aggressive public health efforts must become the first line of
defense. It is time for public servants such as Rep. Nadler to make
the personal political.</TE>

<HD>Forget Consultants -- the Democrats Need a Speech Therapist</HD>
<DH>It's not what they say that's annoying, it's how they say
it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Norah Vincent</AU>
<BD>Norah Vincent is a columnist in Yardley, Pa.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Conventional wisdom says that Democrats lost this month's elections
because they had no ideas. They offered no alternative to the Bush
agenda, settling instead for disparaging it.</LD>
<LD>   This diagnosis makes some sense. Who, after all, can vote for a
negation? But it isn't the whole story.</LD>
<LD>   Democrats didn't really lose the midterm elections because they
had no ideas. They lost them for the same reason they lost the
presidency in 2000: They have a tone problem.</LD>
<TE>   Nothing could have made this clearer than the onslaught return of
Al Gore, who blanketed the media like a pall last week on a tour
promoting his new book.</TE>
<TE>   So inauspicious was the former vice president's showing that a Los
Angeles Times poll revealed that even Democratic Party insiders had
little enthusiasm for a Gore bid in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Why such slim support? Again, common wisdom says that Gore, though
he presents himself as a remade man, is still too stiff a customer to
win, still too script-dependent and -- on key issues like the war in
Iraq -- too fickle and self-contradictory to persuade voters that he
stands for anything. It's clear to all and sundry that his touted new
insouciance is just a put-on.</TE>
<TE>   Though it is true that Gore is too circumspect to be natural and
not strong enough on the issues to show conviction, these aren't the
killer ingredients. The real problem with shallow Al is still what it
has always been: his condescending, supercilious, sanctimonious,
officious, overbearing tone of voice. The man is convinced he's
better than the rest of us, and he's no good at hiding it. No matter
how hard he tries, he sounds like a middle-school principal doling
out detention slips. Is it any wonder he didn't get elected?</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't his policies that alienated voters in 2000. It was the
thought of having to listen to that righteous, reprimanding drone for
the next four years. Nobody likes to be lectured. Which is probably
why the electorate turned on Democrats en masse this season.</TE>
<TE>   The wormwood of Gore's defeat embittered and ultimately poisoned
every motion the party made. Democrats vulgarized the death of
Minnesota Sen. Paul Wellstone, for example, when they allowed liberal
kooks to enshroud it in conspiracy theory and turned the very public
memorial service into a wild-eyed party congress. Goodwill curdled
with angry speechifying.</TE>
<TE>   Then, of course, there was the election eve debate in which
substitute candidate Walter Mondale, impotent and cantankerous as
King Lear, cast his dotty aspersions at Republican challenger Norm
Coleman. A beacon of his party's moral superiority complex, Mondale
sank that eminently winnable race in one outing with the dead weight
of his leaden indignation.</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, Democrats' sour mood has only worsened since Nov. 5. Blame
is the order of the day, and it is being taken to absurd lengths.
Last week, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle told reporters that he
held conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh in part responsible for
driving "an emotional movement" among listeners who are then
"energized to go out and hurt somebody."</TE>
<TE>   The Democrats already look bad because they lost again when they
shouldn't have. Now Daschle's outburst and other such obvious
displays of feckless rancor are only making them look worse, like
sore losers kicking the dog.</TE>
<TE>   If the Democrats are going to have a chance in 2004, they're going
to have to make a serious attitude adjustment because so long as they
present themselves as the wronged party, they will never helm the
winning party, no matter what their ideas.</TE>

<HD>A Bigger Wilderness Jewel</HD>

<LD>In light of the Bush administration's increasing hostility to the
environment, including its move Wednesday to roll back wildlife
safeguards in the national forest system, congressional passage of a
bill to add wilderness protection to nearly 55,000 acres of the Big
Sur coast in Central California is a happy surprise. But the job will
not be finished until President Bush signs HR 4750, the Big Sur
Wilderness and Conservation Act of 2002. He should follow the example
of his father, who as president signed into law earlier Big Sur
protection.</LD>
<LD>   The bill, by Rep. Sam Farr (D-Carmel), adds 10 parcels totaling
about 37,000 acres to the Ventana Wilderness and two of 17,000 acres
to the Silver Peak Wilderness, both in the Los Padres National
Forest, and one small tract to wilderness in the Pinnacles National
Monument south and east of Salinas. The land already is publicly
owned.</LD>
<LD>   The measure provides added protection to rugged and bountiful
regions that include habitat for the California condor, the mountain
lion and endangered steelhead trout. Under the Wilderness Act of
1964, these areas would become permanently off-limits to motorized
travel and permanent structures. But they would remain open to
hiking, camping, fishing and horseback riding.</LD>
<TE>   The Big Sur additions had been included in Sen. Barbara Boxer's
(D-Calif.) proposed California Wild Heritage Act, which would add
more than 2 million acres of wilderness in the state. But they were
moved as separate legislation that had a better chance of passage.
The huge Boxer measure will be far more controversial than Farr's.</TE>
<TE>   Farr carefully lined up support in his district for his Big Sur
bill. Boxer and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) worked to get Farr's
measure through the Senate shortly before Congress adjourned for the
year. Prospects for Boxer's bill dimmed with the swing to Republican
control of the Senate in the Nov. 5 election. GOP senators who
control critical committees have been generally hostile to ambitious
wilderness measures.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 45 million federally owned acres in California, about 14
million are classified as wilderness, ranging from foggy Humboldt
County in the north to desert lands along the Mexican border and from
the central and north coasts to the spine of the Sierra and eastward
through the Mojave.</TE>
<TE>   As a whole, the California wilderness contains the most varied
geography in the nation, including Mt. Whitney, at 14,495 feet the
highest point in the lower 48 states, and Death Valley, 282 feet
below sea level. Much more deserves protection from increasing
population and development. For now, however, Bush can add a few
small jewels to California's lovely diadem of wilderness.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Thanksgiving is an annual act of American appreciation that tends
toward the personal. We think thankfully of our health, our family,
our blessings, perhaps even our presence in a land so blessed. Do
that today. But right afterward, ponder for one moment sharing your
bounty with others less fortunate, perhaps those at Hollygrove, a
home for abused and neglected children.</LD>
<LD>   Think about not having a family gathering like yours today. Think
about the familiar foods and aromas of your home, the familiar faces,
the familiar happiness and excitement, the familiar compliments and
the familiar fullness after such a meal. You can even think about
your uncle's familiar jokes, which he tells every year as if they
were new.</LD>
<LD>   And then think about the 68 kids who have no loving family to
witness, lean on, listen to, laugh with and be hugged by in front of
others as if they were somehow special. And consider sharing, not
your jokes or memories but your money, through The Times Holiday
Campaign. This is the annual effort by the Times Family Fund, part of
the McCormick Tribune Foundation, which will match your donation 50
cents on the dollar. Last year, the fund (which absorbs all
administrative costs) raised $653,000 and granted it to 56 charities
serving all kinds of youth needs across five Southern California
counties.</LD>
<TE>   One recipient was Hollygrove, originally called the Los Angeles
Orphans Home Society, in the Hollywood area. There, boys and girls
ages 6 to 13 live awhile after unsuccessful experiences in foster
homes. They receive not just warm shelter and good food but schooling
and many hours of therapy, including music, dance, art, recreation
and group talks.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the children have been abused and appear to have failed at
being a child in several homes. Few know anything about receiving
compliments -- on their clothes, their stories, their hair or
behavior. Self-esteem, like the feeling that comes from getting a hug
for no reason whatsoever, hasn't much meaning in their lives yet.
Think about hugs you got. Most of the Hollygrove children are angry
in defensive ways. It can take two years to work through the full
therapy. From a child's perspective, it's a challenge to take the
situation any way but personally.</TE>
<TE>   You can't change it all, of course. But you can help with a
tax-deductible donation. Checks or money orders can be sent to the
Los Angeles Times Holiday Campaign, File 56986, Los Angeles, CA
90074-6986. Credit card donations can be made at www
.latimes.com/holidaycampaign; gifts of more than $25 will be
acknowledged in The Times unless donors request otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   Give yourself an outgoing blessing to think about today while
awaiting the incoming pie. And on this Thanksgiving Day, thanks.</TE>

<LD>Forget for a moment the sins of the fathers. Concentrate on the toys
of the fathers, and mothers, about to be visited on unsuspecting
children honing wish lists to whisper in Santa's ear.</LD>
<LD>   This holiday season will be about culling Christmas presents from
the ghosts of Christmas past. Barbie got another face lift. GI Joe
reenlisted. Care Bears and Tickle Me Elmo are plotting comebacks.
Even the venerable Uno cards and Magic 8 Ball are back.</LD>
<LD>   A year ago, holiday shopping carts were filled with comfort foods,
scented candles and board games designed to bring families together.
Sales of fireman and paramedic action dolls soared. Unseasonably warm
weather couldn't dampen demand for fireplace logs among Americans
trying to rekindle holiday spirit.</LD>
<TE>   The season's retro toys come courtesy of a toy industry that
failed in the annual mad dash to identify a gotta-have gizmo to set
children nagging and parents frantically searching. Manufacturers are
stealing a page from Hollywood and seeking shelter in sequels -- in
effect, betting that "Citizen Kane's" Rosebud will blossom again for
a new generation.</TE>
<TE>   Magic 8 Ball eschews one-size-fits-all advice for the lovelorn and
instead offers the octagonal wit and wisdom of Homer Simpson.
Old-fashioned Uno cards wear Spiderman graphics. Barbie has doffed
Rapunzel's wig. Lovable Elmo climbs back on the toy shelf as Chicken
Dance Elmo.</TE>
<TE>   It might sound like child's play, but toy sales are a
$29-billion-a-year business, and the biggest season of the retail
year officially begins Friday. Absent a Barney or Cabbage Patch doll
to lead the charge, a grizzled GI, a dancing fur ball and other
play-bin veterans are being forced into the breach.</TE>
<TE>   The toy industry has revved up its marketing machine. Commercials
during the Saturday morning cartoon shows shout "new and improved" in
the hope that Play-Doh and battery-powered Star Wars light sabers
will bridge the generation gap. Toy company executives, meanwhile,
cross their fingers and offer desperate prayers that finicky children
won't simply turn up their noses at yesterday.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood has made fortunes by going back to the future, so who's
to say Davy Crockett coonskin caps won't soon be riding high on our
heads? That said, there are valid reasons to leave the past in, well,
the past. Are the arbiters of all things fashionable serious about
returning shag carpet and fondue pots to the spotlight? Turn over
that Magic 8 Ball and see what Homer has to say. "D'oh!"</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Saudi Funds Raise New Fears on Hill," Nov. 25: With regard to the
possibility that Saudi Arabia may have provided financial aid to
terrorists inside the U.S., you only have to go back to about a month
after Sept. 11, 2001, to see a foreshadowing of this current
controversy.</LD>
<LD>   During a visit to New York, a Saudi prince made a comment
suggesting there was a moral equivalence between what the terrorists
had done and the plight of the Palestinians. Then he took out his
checkbook and tried to buy Rudy Giuliani for $10 million. To his
credit, the mayor refused the buyoff.</LD>
<LD>   The members of the Saudi Arabian royal family have been trying to
have it both ways. They want a relationship with the West, but they
also have a domestic need to mollify the Islamic extremists who have
been incubating in their mosques and schools for the last 20 years.
Fence-straddling, of course, only delays the inevitable. One way or
the other, the Saudis will have to make a choice. Do they want to
return to the Dark Ages or join the rest of the modern world?</LD>

<HD>State Legislators to Davis on Budget: 'You First'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis is one of the most incompetent governors we've had in
scores of years and, unfortunately, we are stuck with him for another
four years ("Legislators Letting Davis Lead on Budget," Nov. 24). He
took a state budget awash in surplus and, with lack of foresight and
proven incompetence, reduced the surplus to a $21-billion deficit.
And our elected legislators are going to leave it to this same man to
solve the problem? How hard will that be for him to accomplish? He'll
cut costs by $5 billion and increase taxes and fees by $16 billion.
Problem solved.</LD>
<LD>   Did we elect our legislators to solve problems or to stand around
and hope that we won't notice that they are unwilling to try to help
solve the problems confronting the state? Any fool can stand around
and do nothing. I hope the electorate is paying attention and will
have the good sense to vote these cowards out of office.</LD>

<TE>   Re "State Taxes: Bite the Bullet," editorial, Nov. 23:</TE>
<TE>   We do not need tax increases to balance our state budget. The
current budget crisis presents an excellent opportunity to reconsider
the organization and scope of our bloated and inefficient state
government. For example, the entire Department of Education is an
unnecessary and expensive burden on our school system. Local school
districts are major enterprises that are fully capable of operating
without having the burden of a state education bureaucracy over them.</TE>
<TE>   The state should also sell property it does not need now, while
real estate prices are high. For example, Caltrans owns hundreds of
rental houses that should be auctioned off to the highest bidder. Any
politician who proposes tax increases is simply a lazy coward who is
unwilling to cut out wasteful spending and stand up to the
bureaucrats and special interests.</TE>
<TE>   F. Stephen Masek</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In urging higher taxes to bail out California's one-party
government, The Times urges extending the sales tax to "lawyer fees,"
claiming they now are "oddly exempted." Sales tax on top of
astronomical legal fees? Then why not sales tax on visits to the
doctor and dentist, prescriptions and all hospital stays? Or on auto
and fire insurance? On apartment rents? What is "odd" is having to
pay sales tax right now, with already income-taxed dollars, to the
government for the privilege of buying clothing, toothpaste, aspirin,
soap, ad infinitum. We need sales tax exemptions -- for clothing,
just for starters -- not ridiculous increases like sales tax on
lawyers' fees. Only adherents of Karl Marx would think it normal to
illogically charge sales tax for professional fees.</TE>

<TE>   In reading "Indian Casinos on a Roll" (Nov. 22), that Indian
casinos in California are poised to give Nevada a run for its money,
my heart bleeds for Nevada, although, unfortunately, it is only a
very small dent and not really a concern for that state -- unless
California finally wakes up and legalizes gambling statewide. Your
article further points out that Californians account for 35% of
Nevada's revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Davis has warned that our 2003-04 budget shortfall will soar
beyond the staggering $21.1 billion projected earlier this month,
which will undoubtedly result in service cutbacks and, despite
denials, higher taxes of one sort or another.</TE>
<TE>   So why do our governor, legislators and influential citizens not
urgently call for a referendum or other means to legalize gambling in
California to partially offset our serious budget deficits, as well
as alleviate our unemployment? Other states have legalized gambling,
why not California?</TE>

<LD>Re "Stadium Site Still Tough to Pin Down," Nov. 25: I'd like to pose
one simple question: Who asked for the NFL in L.A.? It seems to me
that the only people pushing for the NFL in L.A. are (1) the NFL; (2)
grubby developers looking to make a buck on building a stadium; (3)
half-wit politicians looking to not only line their pockets but put
such an item on their resume. I say forget about the NFL if it
doesn't care for the Coliseum or the Rose Bowl. And forget about
Councilman Nick Pacheco. Why doesn't he find something more fruitful
for his constituents?</LD>
<LD>   Overall, I think most of metro Los Angeles is perfectly content
with three professional basketball teams, one being repeat world
champions, two playoff-contending hockey teams, two baseball teams
(one of which is a world champion), a championship soccer team and
arena football for those who just aren't as satiated as I am from
watching the Oakland Raiders or the San Diego Chargers on TV. We
don't need the NFL and we can't afford to spend ridiculous amounts of
tax dollars to appease it.</LD>

<TE>   I just attended the UCLA-USC game at the Rose Bowl. I felt safe,
parking was good (except there were 91,000 people), freeways
adjacent, view of the field excellent. To me the only thing the Rose
Bowl needs are the corporate or luxury boxes. I can't figure out why
the Rose Bowl doesn't get better play.</TE>

<TE>   Once again our local officials are attempting to foist a white
elephant upon the taxpayers of Los Angeles in the guise of a sports
center for millionaire football team owners. L.A. already has a venue
for such an enterprise -- it's called the Coliseum. This site has
been successfully used for Olympic Games and restored, at great
public expense, after the Northridge earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   Our local leaders would be well advised to use their efforts to
increase the economic base of the city by bringing in businesses that
would contribute to the growth of Los Angeles. If, as our leaders
claim, L.A. is a world-class city, why have corporate headquarters
left the city? There are a number of solutions to acquiring a sports
center for Los Angeles. Let the team owners of the football (and
baseball) leagues combine forces to build a multiuse stadium and have
the city assist the process by simplifying the permits and procedures
to facilitate location and construction. If the team owners do not
want to risk their capital, they might consider bringing in some of
the players with multimillion-dollar salaries as investors in such a
project. Failing that, the players could form a corporation to build
a stadium. Let the people who stand to profit the most from a new
stadium assume the risk.</TE>
<TE>   Let our city leaders try leading for a change and bring corporate
America back to L.A. Let them help by creating a permanent base for
business that will create more long-lasting jobs than seasonally
parking cars and selling hot dogs and beer.</TE>

<LD>It was refreshing and encouraging to read a positive article about
the Catholic Church community in Los Angeles ("Church Reopens
Stronger Since '99 Fire," Nov. 24). The parishioners of St. Thomas
the Apostle Catholic Church showed deep faith, perseverance, trust
and dedication in rebuilding the burned edifice. A testament to the
Gospel values of sharing and service to those in need was expressed
by the other parishes in the area, and especially St. Sophia Greek
Orthodox Cathedral, in offering their facilities to St. Thomas
parishioners. Scandals, money problems, threats of war cannot dampen
the spirits of those who believe in God. Thank you for printing this
article of good news.</LD>

<LD>Re "Riordan Puppetry in Action," Commentary, Nov. 24: The effort by
Eli Broad and Richard Riordan to unseat school board member David
Tokofsky reveals an unholy nexus of money and politics and helps
explain why the Los Angeles Unified School District remains so wildly
dysfunctional. In the aftermath of the accounting scandals, directors
in the private sector are presumed negligent if they don't ask tough
questions of staff. In the LAUSD, questioning by a board member is
characterized as "micromanagement" and Tokofsky's independence means
he's not a "team player."</LD>
<LD>   There is little comfort in knowing that several of the LAUSD's
trustees owe their positions to the backing of two men who, however
public-spirited, have neither taught nor run a school. Who advises
these gentlemen about what is best for the LAUSD?</LD>
<LD>   Broad and Riordan did not invent hubris, but Tokofsky's
constituents should be offended that powerful outsiders are scheming
to co-opt their franchise. They are fortunate that, this time at
least, the manipulators could not keep their effort covert.</LD>

<LD>Re "Extended Jobless Aid Threatened," Nov. 21: Why is the federal
government paying people not to work? We already pay six months of
unemployment insurance for workers. But that is not enough. We have
up to an additional 13 weeks of payments. Now the additional 13 weeks
of "extended benefits" may go away -- three days after Christmas. Why
was Christmas listed as a factor? So we will feel sympathy and give
away more of my tax money?</LD>

<HD>Baby Given Up Under State Safe Haven Law</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times staff writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A healthy newborn was dropped off at a fire station in Wilmington on
Wednesday under the state's Safe Haven law, which allows parents to
surrender babies with no questions asked rather than abandon them.</LD>
<LD>   The 7-pound boy, who was believed to be about an hour old, was
delivered to Fire Station 38 at 8:40 a.m. by a woman who said she was
the mother's cousin, fire officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Firefighters checked to make sure he appeared healthy and took him
to a hospital.</LD>
<TE>   "We are pleased that in a time of duress, a troubled parent would
see the warmth and safety of a fire station as preferable to a
doorstep or worse," said department spokesman Brian Humphrey. He said
the firefighters accepted the baby in a calm, nonjudgmental manner.</TE>
<TE>   In effect since 2001, California's Safe Haven law allows for the
anonymous surrender of babies at hospitals within 72 hours of birth
without criminal prosecution. It also provides for a 14-day period in
which the mother may change her mind and reclaim her baby.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County expanded the law to include county Fire
Department stations as drop-off sites. Several of the county's 88
cities have added their municipal fire stations. The city of Los
Angeles has yet to formally include its stations, but city
firefighters were instructed about the law.</TE>
<TE>   More than 20 babies have been turned in statewide.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously this mother has done the right thing," said John
Musella, a spokesman for county Supervisor Don Knabe.</TE>

<HD>George Christian, 75; Presidential Press Secretary</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>George Christian, a former press secretary to President Lyndon B.
Johnson and an aide to two Texas governors, died Wednesday night at
an Austin hospital. He was 75.</LD>
<LD>   The cause of death was not announced, but Christian was diagnosed
with lung cancer in October 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson hired Christian to work in his administration in 1966 and
made Christian his press secretary when Bill Moyers left later that
year.</LD>
<TE>   It was a time when much of Johnson's domestic legislation had been
passed and the Vietnam War was raging.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson enjoyed dealing with the press, even when he was angry at
the news coverage of his administration, Christian once recalled.</TE>
<TE>   "He was an exacting boss: amusing, scary, ferocious, kind,
mercurial, generous, hateful -- all within about five minutes,"
Christian wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Christian was closely involved with Johnson's decision not to seek
another term in 1968. He and Lady Bird Johnson urged Johnson not to
run again.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him that I thought he could get the nomination, he could
get elected, but it wouldn't be worth it, that the country would be
almost impossible to govern," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Christian was known for his calmness during his White House days
and was well-liked by politicians of both parties.</TE>
<TE>   "I have done my best to avoid making blood enemies, and I think I
can honestly say that I don't hold grudges," Christian once told the
Austin American-Statesman. "I do my best not to disparage people,
even when we have disagreements."</TE>
<TE>   At a party at the LBJ Library and Museum to celebrate Christian's
birthday in January, admirers praised his friendship and loyalty.</TE>
<TE>   "He's one of one," said Larry Temple, a friend and former Johnson
aide. He called Christian "a unique guy in the history of this
state."</TE>
<TE>   Friends said he displayed a calm demeanor as he faced his fatal
illness.</TE>
<TE>   Christian grew up in Austin. His father was a state judge and
active in political circles, sometimes taking his son on campaign
trips on behalf of friends.</TE>
<TE>   After serving in the Marines in World War II, Christian returned
home and attended the University of Texas on the GI Bill. He became
sports editor for the Temple Telegram and then a reporter for
International News Service in Austin.</TE>
<TE>   Former U.S. Rep. Jake Pickle, an Austin Democrat, helped persuade
Christian to leave journalism for politics.</TE>
<TE>   Christian was hired by Pickle in 1956 to work for the
gubernatorial campaign of then-U.S. Sen. Price Daniel. In 1962,
Christian went to work for Gov. John Connally.</TE>
<TE>   After the White House years, Christian returned to Austin and
worked in lobbying and public relations.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Jo Anne; six children, and 11
grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Garden Grove Waters Down Regulations for Cyber Cafes</HD>
<DH>Curfew is loosened, and businesses are allowed to stay open
later. The city had beefed up its laws in a bid to end violence, but
some owners sued.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mai Tran</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Threatened by a lawsuit contending that city officials are trying to
shut down cyber cafes, the Garden Grove City Council on Tuesday
loosened regulations on computer game businesses and settled with two
owners.</LD>
<LD>   City officials agreed to revise what they had touted as the
toughest ordinance in Orange County for cyber cafes.</LD>
<LD>   The new regulations ease the curfew for minors and expand
operating hours for the businesses, which will no longer be required
to keep a log of customer names.</LD>
<TE>   "We've reached out to make the ordinance as effective as possible
and make them realistic and require them to be responsible
businesspeople," said City Manager George Tindall. "You can't deny
that we've had substantial police calls at these places. We needed to
step up to the plate and get something done."</TE>
<TE>   Officials reviewed the city's ordinance after an outbreak of
violence at some of its two dozen cyber cafes. Police have been
called to the businesses 289 times since June. That month,
14-year-old Edward Fernandez was followed home from a cyber cafe and
shot to death.</TE>
<TE>   Five cyber cafe owners filed a lawsuit after the city tightened
the ordinance, saying they were being unfairly blamed for
gang-related crimes.</TE>
<TE>   A judge in August blocked the ordinance, which required minors to
leave by 8 p.m., limited operating hours and required security guards
after 6 p.m., among other restrictions. The judge ordered business
owners and city officials to come up with a compromise.</TE>
<TE>   City officials reviewed the ordinance with merchants and agreed to
extend curfews to 10 p.m. and allow them to stay open until 2 a.m. on
weekends. The cafes must still have security guards, but they don't
have to keep a log of visitors.</TE>
<TE>   The new regulations led one of the five owners to drop out of the
lawsuit and two others to settle. The two remaining plaintiffs will
have a hearing in January.</TE>
<TE>   Diane Vo, owner of Vietnam Internet Center, said she should not be
punished for the actions of gang members.</TE>
<TE>   "Garden Grove should fight crimes and should not fight the cyber
cafe owners," Vo said. "We did not do anything wrong and should not
be punished for making an honest living."</TE>

<HD>Forest Activist Ends Her Hunger Strike at Capitol</HD>
<DH>Legislators' agreement to hold a hearing on old-growth
trees brings 52-day protest to a close.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Bailey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>On Thanksgiving eve, forest activist Susan Moloney ended her 52-day
hunger strike after lawmakers agreed to convene a hearing on the
continuing harvest of old-growth trees in California.</LD>
<LD>   Moloney, 40, began her fast on the Capitol steps Oct. 7 to protest
what she said was Gov. Gray Davis' refusal to uphold a 1998 campaign
promise to spare the state's dwindling ancient trees.</LD>
<LD>   Davis did not back down under the pressure, but Moloney agreed to
halt her hunger strike -- which caused her weight to drop more than
20 pounds -- when two top lawmakers pledged to hold a hearing on the
issue in January.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm willing to give my life for the forest," Moloney said, "but
I'm not willing to give my life for a governor who refuses to keep an
important promise."</TE>
<TE>   Moloney, who said she has subsisted on a mix of water, herbal tea,
broth and juice, plans to resume her strict vegan diet very slowly,
so her digestive system has time to restart. Her first meal: fresh
diced papaya.</TE>
<TE>   "I look forward to regaining my strength so we can continue this
struggle," Moloney said from outside the Capitol before returning
home to Garberville, in Humboldt County, for the holidays. "Gov.
Davis has not seen the last of me."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Maviglio, a Davis spokesman, said the governor was pleased
that Moloney had ended the strike and appreciated "her passion for
what she believes in." Maviglio said Davis looks forward to "engaging
in a dialogue" with her and state lawmakers on how best to preserve
old growth.</TE>
<TE>   State Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco) made
the pitch for a legislative hearing intended to push the Davis
administration toward more stringent limits on old-growth harvests.</TE>
<TE>   "Old-growth trees are part of California's heritage, part of our
rich history," Burton said in a letter to Sen. Sheila Kuehl, a Santa
Monica Democrat who agreed to be chairwoman of a special hearing with
the natural resources committee, which she heads.</TE>
<TE>   "It's refreshing to know we have allies like this in the Capitol,"
Moloney said.</TE>
<TE>   She was joined this week in her hunger strike by Julia Butterfly
Hill, the tree sitter whose two-year vigil in the branches of redwood
ended in 1999. Hill said she welcomed a hearing. As for the governor,
she said, "this does not even remotely let him off the hook."</TE>
<TE>   On March 14, 1998, Davis was quoted by the Associated Press as
declaring to the state Planning and Conservation League in Sacramento
that, if elected, he would ensure that "all old-growth trees are
spared from the lumberjack's ax."</TE>
<TE>   Maviglio said Moloney and the media had misconstrued that message
from the campaign stump and that Davis had done more for old-growth
trees than any other governor in history.</TE>
<TE>   Davis played a key role in the state's 1999 purchase of the
Headwaters grove in Humboldt County, sparing 7,400 acres of ancient
forest. On Davis' watch, the state has also altered logging rules to
require an environmental review before old-growth trees are cut,
Maviglio said, and purchased more than 30,000 acres of second- and
third-generation forest in Del Norte and Mendocino counties.</TE>
<TE>   Moloney says Davis' pledge was unequivocal and that an estimated 7
million old-growth redwood, Douglas fir and other marketable trees
remain in peril around the state.</TE>
<TE>   As executive director of the Campaign for Old Growth, Moloney is
continuing to push for a statewide ban on cutting trees older than
the state, which was admitted to the union in 1850. The group sought
a statewide vote on the issue, but failed to get a measure onto this
month's ballot. Now the organization hopes to qualify its proposal
for the March 2004 ballot or win approval in the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   "Cars are considered antiques at 20 years; homes can be registered
as historic landmarks at 50," Moloney said. "Yet a tree that is 150
years old can be cut and holds no historical value."</TE>

<HD>Facility Faces 3rd Suit Over Sexual Abuse</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A West Hills psychiatric hospital is confronting its third negligence
lawsuit in two years stemming from allegations of inappropriate sex
encounters between employees and patients.</LD>
<LD>   But the plaintiff's attorney, David Ring, learned Wednesday that
the lawsuit has been stayed indefinitely because Pine Grove
Hospital's parent company, Arizona-based Doctors Community Healthcare
Corp., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy earlier this month. Another
lawsuit against the hospital that Ring is also handling has also been
stayed.</LD>
<LD>   Doctors Community additionally owns Pacifica Hospital in Sun
Valley. Officials for both Pacifica and Pine Grove said that the
hospitals' operations will not be affected as the company reorganizes
its debts.</LD>
<TE>   Pine Grove and Doctors Community were named in a civil complaint
filed Wednesday by Ring on behalf of a 15-year-old girl who had sex
with a former hospital employee after she was released from the
facility.</TE>
<TE>   Ring filed a similar lawsuit on behalf of a 13-year-old girl
earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   An adult patient who claims she was sexually assaulted by a
patient filed another negligence lawsuit against the hospital and
Doctors Community in March 2001. That case has been settled,
according to court records.</TE>

<HD>Navy, Port of Hueneme to Share Wharf</HD>
<DH>Deal will let the harbor district use the military dock for
cargo ships in exchange for percentage of revenues, mostly in the
form of services.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregory W. Griggs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Port of Hueneme struck a 30-year deal with the U.S. Navy on
Wednesday for joint use of a Navy wharf that has the potential of
increasing port revenues by one-third.</LD>
<LD>   The deal, which adds a sixth berth to the only deep-water harbor
between Los Angeles and San Francisco, was praised by port officials.</LD>
<LD>   "I am very thankful," said William J. Buenger, Oxnard Harbor
District executive director. "I'm going to eat double turkey."</LD>
<TE>   In the works for eight years, the arrangement allows the harbor
district to use the Navy's 1,000-foot Wharf 3 and 25 acres of
adjacent land for 15 years in exchange for 39.5% of the revenue
generated by commercial customers. The contract, approved this week
by the Secretary of the Navy's office, allows three five-year
extensions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of those unique situations that you run across only so
often that is a win for everyone around," said Rep. Elton Gallegly,
who attended a no-frills contract-signing ceremony Wednesday morning
in Port Hueneme. "It's even a win for L.A. Harbor," he said, since
excess traffic could be diverted from San Pedro and Long Beach to the
Port of Hueneme.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, the Simi Valley Republican included a provision in a
military construction bill that authorized the Navy to begin
negotiating with the harbor district to permit long-term commercial
use of one of its infrequently used wharves next to the port's north
terminal.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a win for us, because we get some income out of it," said
Cmdr. Doug Boothe, who is in charge of facilities and infrastructure
at Naval Base Ventura County. "In peacetime, allowing a joint use
allows us to get a little income from that wharf and for them to
generate extra income for the harbor district."</TE>
<TE>   Buenger estimates that the shared wharf will permit about 30
additional ships to call at Port Hueneme each year, adding $2 million
to $2.5 million to port revenues, now at about $7.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   The land behind the wharf contains several World War II-era wooden
sheds and warehouses.</TE>
<TE>   Final conditions for using Wharf 3 must still be worked out,
Buenger said.</TE>
<TE>   The harbor district had limited use of the Navy facility under a
licensing agreement dating back to the early 1980s and had brought in
up to 17 ships annually.</TE>
<TE>   The docking of commercial ships was suspended after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, however, and that suspension is still in effect.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole thing will hinge on how accessible it will be,
considering the Navy's security," Buenger said. "This contract has
not changed, at all, their security requirements.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not overly optimistic that the world situation and the Navy's
security requirements are going to change overnight," he said. "I
think we're going to be living with that for some years to come. But
what we have is a lot better than what we had, and we're really happy
about it."</TE>
<TE>   The harbor district's earlier licensing agreement also allows it
to temporarily operate at Navy wharves 4, 5 and 6 as needed when they
are not in military use. The advantage of Wednesday's joint-use
agreement is that the Navy will be compensated primarily in
maintenance, repair and construction services rather than cash
payments, of which only 50% goes to the local base, according to
Boothe.</TE>
<TE>   Gallegly said that keeping 100% of the benefit from the
collaboration inside Ventura County is especially important.</TE>
<TE>   "Rather than the money just going to the Navy, it is earmarked for
Port Hueneme operations," he said. "It doesn't go to Washington,
D.C., but stays at the base for local infrastructure improvements and
operations."</TE>

<HD>White Supremacist Leader Pleads Guilty to Charges of
Perjury, Weapons Violation</HD>
<DH>John Frederick Steele II, head of the California-based
'Brandenburg Division' of the Aryan Nations, gets a 4-month term.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Haldane</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A white supremacist leader arrested last week on perjury and weapons
charges pleaded guilty in Orange County Superior Court on Wednesday
and was sentenced to four months in jail.</LD>
<LD>   John Frederick Steele II, 29, of Long Beach, was also placed on
three years' probation and ordered not to associate with white
supremacist groups, said Michelle Emard, a spokeswoman for the Orange
County district attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   Steele, leader of the California-based "Brandenburg Division" of
Aryan Nations, was arrested Nov. 18 and charged with perjury in
connection with financial statements made to law enforcement
officials while he was on probation for an earlier crime. He was also
charged with owning weapons in violation of that probation.</LD>
<TE>   Two other people arrested at the same time -- Christine Greenwood
and her boyfriend, John Patrick McCabe -- have been arraigned on
charges of possessing bomb-making materials in the Anaheim apartment
they shared. Greenwood was recently released on bail, Emard said, and
McCabe was transferred to Orange County Jail from a state prison,
where he was serving time for an unrelated crime.</TE>
<TE>   Both are scheduled to appear at a pretrial hearing Monday, Emard
said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the materials authorities said they found in the couple's
apartment in 1999 were 50 gallons of gasoline, BBs, razor blades, 16
nails that could be used as shrapnel and clocks that could operate as
timers.</TE>
<TE>   A more recent search of Steele's home, they said, uncovered a
letter addressed to the white supremacist Christian Defense League
that urged members to align themselves with Palestinians who target
Jews.</TE>

<HD>Karel Reisz, 76; Director Was 'New Realism' Pioneer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis McLellan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Karel Reisz, an influential figure in British cinema's new-realism
movement whose best-known work as a director includes "Saturday Night
and Sunday Morning," "Isadora" and "The French Lieutenant's Woman,"
has died. He was 76.</LD>
<LD>   The Czech-born Reisz died of undisclosed causes Monday in London.</LD>
<LD>   A leading figure in Britain's Free Cinema movement, which
attempted to give a voice to working-class England in the 1950s
through documentaries, the former film critic made his feature film
debut in 1960 with "Saturday Night and Sunday Morning," a gritty
portrayal of working-class life that marked the film debut of Albert
Finney.</LD>
<TE>   Reisz also introduced Vanessa Redgrave to movie audiences in
"Morgan: A Suitable Case for Treatment," an offbeat 1966 comedy that
earned her a best-actress Academy Award nomination.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, she starred in Reisz's "Isadora," which was based
on the life of modern dancer Isadora Duncan, which earned Redgrave
another best actress Oscar nomination.</TE>
<TE>   Reisz made his American film debut in 1974 with "The Gambler," an
intense drama starring James Caan as a gambling-addicted professor,
which Reisz followed in 1978 with "Who'll Stop the Rain," starring
Nick Nolte.</TE>
<TE>   Meryl Streep earned a best actress nomination for Reisz's 1981
screen version of John Fowles' novel "The French Lieutenant's Woman,"
as did Jessica Lange for "Sweet Dreams," Reisz's 1985 film about
country music legend Patsy Cline.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, Reisz directed his last movie, "Everybody Wins," which
was adapted by Arthur Miller from his play "Some Kind of Love Story"
and starred Nolte and Deborah Winger.</TE>
<TE>   Reisz then directed plays in London, Dublin, Paris and New York.</TE>
<TE>   Although a revered name to many movie buffs, Reisz remained
largely unknown to the average American moviegoer. He directed only
nine films in 30 years, once prompting fellow director Sidney Lumet
to jokingly lament to the low-key Reisz: "Why must you be so boring
and picky?"</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Thomas, a film writer for The Times, said Reisz was "one of
the major directors" to emerge from the British cinema's era of new
realism in the late '50s and early '60s.</TE>
<TE>   But, he said, Reisz went beyond that as a filmmaker.</TE>
<TE>   "He was not chained to the working-class grit of, say, 'Saturday
Night and Sunday Morning,' " Thomas said. "He could move superbly to
the romanticism and the epic sweep and grandeur of 'Isadora' and her
incredible life and so superbly played by Vanessa Redgrave. And 'The
Gambler,' I think, is an absolute masterpiece. It's really a bold
picture."</TE>
<TE>   Film historian Richard Schickel, a movie critic for Time magazine,
said Reisz for a time in the '60s was "a figure to be reckoned with
in the movie business."</TE>
<TE>   "The spirit of the time matched his sensibility: a director trying
to make movies that didn't fit the conventional mold. But it was a
relatively brief moment where people took him with great seriousness.</TE>
<TE>   "The trouble with cinema is you have to make at least a few really
successful movies -- commercially and generally accepted movies. If
you look at the rest of his filmography, excepting 'French
Lieutenant's Woman,' most of his movies were very marginal."</TE>
<TE>   A self-described "film fanatic," Reisz was born in Ostrava,
Czechoslovakia, in 1926. The son of a Jewish lawyer, he emigrated to
England before the Nazi invasion when he was 12. His parents, who
remained in Czechoslovakia, died in a concentration camp.</TE>
<TE>   Reisz, who spoke little English when he arrived, graduated from
the Quaker school that had sponsored him in England. He served as a
fighter pilot in the Czech squadron of the Royal Air Force near the
end of the war.</TE>
<TE>   Reisz, who earned a bachelor's degree in science from Emmanuel
College, spent two years after college teaching working-class grammar
school students in London. He once said it "was my first taste of
social reality," but he quit to become a freelance writer. He was a
movie critic for the influential film journals "Sight and Sound" and
"Sequence" and was program director for the National Film Theatre in
London from 1952 to 1955.</TE>
<TE>   While a student at the British Film Academy in the early '50s, he
was commissioned to write "The Technique of Film Editing," which is
considered a classic study of the history, theory and practice of
editing.</TE>
<TE>   In 1955, Reisz made his film debut as co-director, with Tony
Richardson," of "Momma Don't Allow," a documentary short. He went on
to make instructional and promotional movies for Ford Motor Co. and,
in 1957, co-produced Lindsay Anderson's documentary "Every Day Except
Christmas."</TE>
<TE>   Reisz later produced Anderson's 1963 feature movie "This Sporting
Life."</TE>
<TE>   Reisz's first solo directing credit was for a 1959 documentary
about a London youth club, "We Are the Lambeth Boys," which he also
produced.</TE>
<TE>   Having cast a virtually unknown Jeremy Irons as Streep's co-star
in "The French Lieutenant's Woman" and providing the film debuts of
Finney and Redgrave, Reisz was often credited with spotting talented
actors.</TE>
<TE>   "And one takes the credit happily, but it's not really true," he
told The Times in 1985. "All those people I used in my films already
had reputations onstage. But I do like using fresh faces. They have a
kind of innocence of the camera that gives them a freedom to express
themselves that they'll lose later on when they become canny."</TE>
<TE>   Reisz is survived by his wife of 40 years, actress Betsy Blair;
three sons, Toby, Matthew and Barney; and a stepdaughter, Kerry.</TE>
<TE>   Services are pending.</TE>

<LD>A federal appeals court declined Wednesday to bar Penthouse from
redistributing photos that the magazine claimed in error to show
tennis player Anna Kournikova topless.</LD>
<LD>   Kournikova asked a Los Angeles judge to bar Penthouse from further
distribution of the photos, but he declined. The U.S. 9th Circuit
Court of Appeals also declined to act.</LD>
<LD>   The appeals court said the issue was "largely moot" because the
publisher had stopped distributing that issue.</LD>

<LD>The city has petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a lower
court ruling requiring it to make sidewalks accessible to disabled
people. The case is expected to be a test of whether the 1990 federal
Americans with Disabilities Act applies to sidewalks.</LD>
<LD>   City officials say they're concerned about the cost of the
repairs, which would include rebuilding some sidewalks and moving bus
benches and utility poles out of the way.</LD>
<LD>   But advocates for the disabled say the bigger issue is their right
to move freely in their daily lives.</LD>

<LD>A federal appeals court agreed Wednesday with a lower court's
decision to throw out a civil rights lawsuit brought by the first man
convicted of murder after testimony based on repressed memories.</LD>
<LD>   George Franklin was convicted in 1990 after his daughter, Eileen
Franklin Lipsker, said more than 20 years after the murder that she
recalled seeing her father crush 8-year-old Susan Nason's skull with
a rock.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals also partially cleared
Lipsker of liability in a lawsuit that fueled national debate about
the legal reliability of repressed memory.</LD>

<HD>Oxnard OKs Retail Project for Downtown</HD>
<DH>The $12-million complex, including a 12-screen theater, is
touted as the key to reviving city's central area.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sandra Murillo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It took three tries, seven years and countless hours of negotiation,
but it looks like Oxnard will finally get a downtown theater.</LD>
<LD>   The City Council unanimously approved an agreement Tuesday with
developers to build a 12-screen, 2,200-seat theater and retail
complex touted as the key to reviving Oxnard's dreary downtown.</LD>
<LD>   If the $12-million theater and retail complex is built as planned,
downtown Oxnard would become a bazaar of restaurants, bookstores,
shops and cultural festivals, developers said. The shopping and
entertainment zone will be called the International Marketplace, said
developer Dave White, a principal partner in the new Strand Cinema
corporation.</LD>
<TE>   The theater and shops are expected to be built over the next 18
months between A and B streets, facing the city's landmark Plaza
Park. After that, White said, his group plans to erect a second set
of 10 shops on the same parcel. Once those shops are leased, the plan
calls for more stores, offices and restaurants playing off the
International Marketplace theme.</TE>
<TE>   "This city is an exciting place with a lot of opportunities,"
White said in an interview. "I think the people of Oxnard want their
downtown to succeed."</TE>
<TE>   White is a partner in both the 416-home River Ridge golf course
expansion in north Oxnard and the $750-million RiverPark project
along the Ventura Freeway, the largest mixed-use development in
Ventura County history.</TE>
<TE>   Downtown merchants, city leaders and developers could barely
contain their excitement Tuesday night. They shook hands, patted one
another on the back and congratulated one another for a job well
done.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to break out the champagne," downtown property owner Tila
Santana-Estrada said. "Some people laugh because they're saying all
the theaters are going broke. But, come on, we have the people to
make this work. You've got to have guts and pride. We can't settle
for mediocrity anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's council vote is the closest this sprawling city of
185,000 residents has been to getting its new downtown theater.</TE>
<TE>   A city theater deal last year with Burbank developer Victor
Georgino fell through after neither side would agree to pick up an
extra $1.8 million in costs because builders were required to hire
workers at the so-called prevailing wage, not the lowest possible
wage for labor in the local market.</TE>
<TE>   It was the third deal since 1995 to go nowhere.</TE>
<TE>   But this time, city leaders are convinced they finally have the
perfect project. "The idea has always been to have the theater be a
catalyst for activity downtown," city redevelopment manager Brian
Pendleton said. "But it's also been a concern that we not just build
a theater by itself."</TE>
<TE>   White's proposal, Pendleton said, "brought the whole thing
together."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike previous deals in which developers would have received the
theater site for free, White and his partners have agreed to buy the
site -- nearly one square block -- for $800,000. And they will pay
the city an additional $1 million over time.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange, the city must immediately erect a 545-space downtown
parking garage at an estimated cost of $4 million to $5 million. The
city must also guarantee the $1.6-million annual lease payments to
San Carlos Cinemas, based in Sonoma County.</TE>
<TE>   White said he is sure the complex will be successful.</TE>
<TE>   "The participation of the city makes it a lot less risky," White
said. "Basically, everybody had to invest something. And I've got my
whole reputation on the line here."</TE>

<LD>Verne H. Winchell, who launched a nationwide doughnut franchise
business from one drive-through restaurant he opened in 1948 in
Temple City, has died. He was 87.</LD>
<LD>   Winchell died of cardiac arrest Tuesday at Summerlin Hospital
Medical Center in Las Vegas, the Clark County coroner's office said.
Family members said he collapsed after exercising, which he did
daily, on the treadmill at his home.</LD>
<LD>   Winchell had retired as chief executive and president of Denny's
Inc., which bought Winchell's Donut Houses in 1968.</LD>
<TE>   He was also a leading horse owner and breeder who started three
horses in the Kentucky Derby: Classic Go Go, who finished fourth in
1981; Sea Cadet, who finished eighth in 1991; and Valiant Nature, who
finished 13th in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   In all, Winchell bred more than 60 stakes winners and raced more
than 40. He had 25 broodmares at 320-acre Oakwind Farm, a Lexington,
Ky.-area property that he bought in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   Winchell was born Oct. 30, 1915, in Bloomington, Ill., and his
family moved to California when he was 9. After graduating from
Alhambra High School and attending Pasadena City College, he worked
for General Motors for a time. But wanted to own his own business.</TE>
<TE>   He had already tried two others -- Winchell Music (a jukebox
business) and Winchell Motors (used cars) -- when a friend told him
there was a high profit margin on doughnuts. Winchell took a $27,000
stake and turned a piece of commercial property he owned into his
first Winchell's doughnut shop.</TE>
<TE>   "That first shop did very well, so I opened a couple more," he
told The Times in 1960. "They didn't do so good."</TE>
<TE>   Soon, however, the doughnut shops took off, and Winchell expanded
his operation throughout California. In 1976, according to
BusinessWeek magazine, sales at Winchell's nationwide were $99
million, although the chain was by then a distant second to Dunkin'
Donuts.</TE>
<TE>   By that time, Winchell had sold his operation to Denny's in
exchange for stock. In 1970, he became chairman of the troubled
Denny's Restaurants (later Denny's Inc.).</TE>
<TE>   Winchell was generally credited with bringing the company back to
life with his low-key, professional style.</TE>
<TE>   He said the key to his success was careful management, good
merchandising and advertising, proper locations and quality products.</TE>
<TE>   "We decided to stop selling franchises in 1971 and instead
concentrate on earning a profit from our operations," he said about
his oversight of Denny's. "Quick profits from the sale of franchises
didn't appeal to us anymore."</TE>
<TE>   In 1984, Winchell left the doughnut and restaurant business when
he sold his stock in Denny's for a reported $600 million.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he was thrilled several years later to win $110,000 with
his 4-year-old colt Wild Wonder at Longacres Mile in Auburn, Calif.
"I'm happy I came up here, not only to win, but just being here," he
said as he took his place in the winner's circle.</TE>
<TE>   Winchell became interested in horses in the 1930s. One of his
first winning horses was Mr. Eiffel, for which he paid $10,000 only
to see it laid up for 10 months. But the horse came back to win
$57,000 in two races.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Winchell owned horses named Donut King (also his
own nickname), Mr. Tower, Mr. America, Ancient Mariner, Mira Femme,
Tight Spot, On Target, Call Now, Amerique, Future Quest, Olympio,
Ronnie's Baby and Sea Cadet.</TE>
<TE>   Donut King, the first horse Winchell bought at auction, was among
the favorites for the 1954 Kentucky Derby but was injured the week of
the race and didn't run.</TE>
<TE>   "That would have been our best chance to win," said Winchell's
longtime trainer, Ron McAnally.</TE>
<TE>   Ronnie's Baby, which was bred by Ronald Reagan and purchased from
Desi Arnaz, didn't amount to much.</TE>
<TE>   Sea Cadet, for whom Winchell paid $2,800 in 1989, won more than
$1.7 million during the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Besides horse racing, Winchell also enjoyed movies -- he told The
Times his favorite was "Casablanca," although you "can't beat the
older violent movies like 'Terminator' for the sound of the
explosions."</TE>
<TE>   He and his wife, Joan, built a $60,000 screening room -- if you
didn't count the additional custom work -- in their San Marino home.
They called the home theater The Bijou.</TE>
<TE>   Winchell had survived at least one other heart attack. He told the
story that 40 years ago, when his daughter was driving him to one of
his doughnut shops in Alhambra, he suffered an attack in the car.</TE>
<TE>   "We were approaching an automobile accident where an ambulance had
already come," he said. "The ambulance took both me and someone from
the accident to the hospital. If that ambulance hadn't been there, I
was told later, I never would have made it."</TE>
<TE>   A longtime resident of Las Vegas, he is survived by his wife; two
sons, Richard and Ronald; two daughters, Christina Winchell and Linda
Schumacher; five grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren. Sisters
Barbara Ogden and Eloise Wills, both of Los Angeles, also survive
him.</TE>

<LD>A West Hills psychiatric hospital is confronting its third negligence
lawsuit in two years stemming from allegations of inappropriate
sexual encounters between employees and patients.</LD>
<LD>   But attorneys say the latest lawsuit has been stayed because Pine
Grove Hospital's parent company, Doctors Community Healthcare Corp.,
filed for bankruptcy earlier this month.</LD>
<LD>   Pine Grove and Doctors Community were named in a suit filed
Wednesday on behalf of a 15-year-old girl who had sex with former
hospital employee Angel Vargas. The incident is one of five in three
years involving the alleged sexual molestation of Pine Grove patients
and former patients.</LD>

<HD>Carson Official Seeks Reforms, Ethics Panel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jose Cardenas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Carson city councilman called Wednesday for the creation of an
ethics task force in response to last week's arrest of current and
former council members accused of extorting bribes from companies
seeking contracts for waste hauling and other jobs.</LD>
<LD>   During a news conference attended by a crowd of Carson residents,
Councilman James Dear said the charges should serve as a catalyst for
cleaning up the city's government.</LD>
<LD>   "We need a revolution of reform in Carson," said Dear, one of two
current council members who are not charged in the case.</LD>
<TE>   Dear said the city should begin work immediately on formation of a
task force that would include private citizens willing to put in
months of meetings and research.</TE>
<TE>   He said creation of the task force should be the first in a series
of reforms that should include establishing tough campaign
contribution guidelines and a code of ethics for council members.</TE>
<TE>   But not all in the crowd were impressed with his talk of reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Some said they had been fruitlessly calling for the formation of
such a group since word of the corruption probe surfaced several
months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Some portrayed Dear as a Johnny-come-lately trying to advance
himself, now that his colleagues have been charged.</TE>
<TE>   "He's an opportunist," said Dianne Thomas, a member of the Carson
Neighborhood Council.</TE>
<TE>   That group, she said, has been calling since June for an ethics
committee that would include private citizens, business people, a
council member and journalists.</TE>
<TE>   She said that, at a City Council meeting, a majority of the
council had dismissed her group's suggestion for a committee and that
Dear had not spoken in her favor.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we have had indictments, and here he is having a press
conference," Thomas said.</TE>
<TE>   The charges against the city officials and others stem from an FBI
investigation into the awarding of city contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, authorities arrested Carson Councilman and Mayor Daryl
Sweeney and former Mayor Pete Fajardo. They were charged with
extorting money from businesses over the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   Charged with related crimes were City Councilwoman Raunda Frank
and former City Councilman Manny Ontal.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say that Ontal worked under cover while the FBI
investigated. He agreed to plead guilty to one count of accepting a
$5,000 payoff from a city contractor and of failing to report $33,000
in consultant's income on his tax return.</TE>
<TE>   The grand-jury indictment portrayed Sweeney, 45, as the
ringleader.</TE>
<TE>   Others investigated by the FBI:</TE>
<TE>   * Robert Dennis Pryce Jr. -- Sweeney's personal lawyer -- charged
with helping to arrange some of the bribes.</TE>
<TE>   * Garland Hardeman -- a former Inglewood councilman and former Los
Angeles police officer -- charged with attempting to arrange bribes
for council members. Court records show he has agreed to plead
guilty.</TE>
<TE>   * Two Browning-Ferris Industries executives -- charged with
agreeing to pay nearly $600,000 in bribes through Pryce late last
year.</TE>
<TE>   * Michael Aloyan -- president of Compton-based Hub City Solid
Waste -- alleged to have agreed to pay a $1.5-million bribe to Ontal.
Court documents show that he has agreed to plead guilty and cooperate
with authorities.</TE>
<TE>   After the news conference, Dear dismissed the accusations that he
had not shown interest in reforms before.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm inviting them to participate," he said about the community
members who have been working on the issue.</TE>

<KH>TIMES HOLIDAY FUND</KH>
<HD>Young Moms Receive Job Training</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jose Cardenas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This was Erika Lopez's reality at age 15:</LD>
<LD>   She was a single mom, getting little help from her baby's father.
She lived with her mother in Montebello. She had no skills with which
to get a good job and support her child.</LD>
<LD>   Then she was referred to Project Amiga, a nonprofit organization
that, among other things, teaches computer skills to teen mothers at
its Boyle Heights and South El Monte centers.</LD>
<TE>   After teaching her computer skills, the organization helped Lopez
get a job as a Spanish translator at Queen of Angels-Hollywood
Presbyterian Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   Now 18, she credits Project Amiga for launching her into a
brighter future.</TE>
<TE>   "Before I came to Project Amiga, I knew that, just with a high
school diploma, I still didn't have any job experience that would get
me a good job," she said. Now "it feels really good to be able to pay
for things on your own -- not depending on men to support you."</TE>
<TE>   Project Amiga received a $5,000 donation from last year's Times
Holiday Campaign.</TE>
<TE>   During this season's fund-raising effort, The Times is featuring
the kinds of agencies and programs that benefit from its grants.</TE>
<TE>   Project Amiga served about 1,000 people last year, said Executive
Director Irene Portillo. The group is branching out to also serve
boys, she said. Its programs include, besides the computer lessons,
sessions on such subjects as health and parental skills.</TE>
<TE>   Another Project Amiga success story is Juanita Segura, 19, whose
experience in the program led to a job in the office of Los Angeles
Mayor James K. Hahn as a constituent service representative.</TE>
<TE>   After becoming a teen mom and before encountering Project Amiga,
she said, "I was in denial, thinking there was no way out."</TE>
<TE>   Brenda Ramos, 17, said the program "made me feel good because, for
the first time, there was something that I completed." She's a mother
too, and also will be working at Queen of Angels hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "I learned a lot in those classes," she said. "I know I'm going to
get somewhere in life later on."</TE>
<TE>   Agencies helped by the Times Holiday Campaign provide a range of
services to disadvantaged children and youths, including food,
clothing and shelter, childhood literacy programs, services for
developmentally delayed and disabled children and programs to prevent
drug abuse, violence and teen pregnancy.</TE>
<TE>   Fifty-six Southern California charities received grants from funds
raised during last year's holiday appeal.</TE>
<TE>   The Holiday Campaign was established in 2000, and is a part of the
Los Angeles Times Family Fund, a fund of the McCormick Tribune
Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation matches the first $700,000 raised at 50 cents on
the dollar, and the foundation and Los Angeles Times absorb all
administrative costs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HOW TO GIVE</TE>
<TE>   Checks or money orders supporting the Times Holiday Campaign
should be sent to L.A. Times Holiday Campaign, File 56986, Los
Angeles, CA 90074-6986.</TE>
<TE>   Please do not send cash. Credit card donations can be made on the
Web site www.latimes.com/holiday campaign.</TE>
<TE>   All donations are tax-deductible. Contributions of $25 or more
will be acknowledged in The Times, unless a donor requests otherwise.
Acknowledgment cannot be guaranteed for donations received after Dec.
18. For more information, call (800) LATIMES, Ext. 75771.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Six Antelope Valley residents have been arrested in a rash of
identity and mail thefts totaling tens of thousands of dollars,
authorities said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The names of the five men and one woman arrested Tuesday and
Wednesday were not released because investigations into the thefts
are ongoing, said Lt. Ed Dvorak of the Los Angeles County sheriff's
Palmdale station. There were more than a dozen victims, authorities
said.</LD>
<LD>   While serving several search warrants at residences this week,
sheriff's deputies and U.S. Postal Service inspectors seized stolen
mail and computer equipment used to create false identifications.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the thefts occurred along the western edge of Palmdale in
the rural communities of Leona Valley, Elizabeth Lake and Lake
Hughes, where mailboxes are typically clustered together away from
homes, Dvorak said.</TE>
<TE>   The six suspects are being held on varying bail amounts on charges
including identity theft, mail theft and forgery. They are expected
to be arraigned Monday in Los Angeles Superior Court and may also
face federal charges, Dvorak said.</TE>

<LD>Dick Chun read in the Mammoth Times about a police citation that
surely would make some pet owners growl. The crime log reported: "Dog

Wearing it around the owner's neck? Geez -- at least allow it to be
carried in a wallet or purse.</LD>

hot dry Santa Anas that come down through the mountain passes and
curl your hair and make your nerves jump and your skin itch. On
nights like that every booze party ends in a fight. Meek little wives
feel the edge of the carving knife and study their husbands' necks."</TE>
<TE>   And husbands start acting peculiarly on freeways? Not sure, but
perhaps the Santa Anas account for a couple of strange sightings I
received.</TE>
<TE>   David Grudt of Long Beach saw a driver reach for a guitar on the
605, and when Grudt pulled alongside he observed the guy "playing it
while controlling the car, I think, with his knees." If "controlling"
is the correct word.</TE>
<TE>   And Chuck and Arliene Hillinger of Rancho Palos Verdes were
slogging along in slow traffic on the San Diego Freeway when they
spotted a driver who "was beating away on his steering wheel with a
couple of drumsticks and steering with his knees. We kept seeing him
on and off for the next 15 minutes. He never missed a beat."</TE>
<TE>   Some commuters' Xmas wish: Isn't it only a matter of time before
automotive parts stores take heed of all the freeway musicians here
and start selling knee pads that attach to the steering wheel?</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of offbeat: Ralph Merrill of Long Beach came upon an
announcement for a carwash that sounded interesting (see
accompanying). Maybe the workers were playing musical instruments
while they toiled.</TE>
<TE>   MiscelLAny: Who says you can't take it with you? O'Ray Davis of
Torrance saw an ad that seemed to indicate you can even add to your
bank account in the hereafter (see accompanying).</TE>

<HD>Court Reinstates Suit on Field Lab Contamination</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean Guccione</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal appellate court reinstated a lawsuit Wednesday against two
aerospace companies accused of contaminating the environment around
the Santa Susana Field Laboratory near Chatsworth and causing
neighbors to become sick.</LD>
<LD>   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 2-1 decision, found
that newspaper articles on contamination at the site could not be
used to throw out 18 of the 52 claims against Boeing North American
and Rockwell International Corp. The remaining claims were rejected
for other reasons.</LD>
<LD>   The court ruled that jurors, not judges, should determine as an
issue of fact whether the plaintiffs knew or should have known about
contamination on and around the lab site within the statutory
limitations for filing such a suit.</LD>
<TE>   "None of the publicity from this period suggested that available
evidence established contamination from the Rocketdyne facilities as
the likely cause, among many possible causes, of public health
problems," Judge Richard A. Paez wrote for the majority. "The media
reports and expressions of community concern about the contamination
were, at best, equivocal about such a link."</TE>
<TE>   The opinion reversed an earlier decision by U.S. District Judge
Audrey B. Collins. She had ruled the plaintiffs were barred by the
one-year statute of limitation from proceeding to trial because they
should have suspected earlier that industrial contamination from the
test site had made them ill. She based that decision on newspaper
articles between 1989 and 1991 on the laboratory and alleged
contamination around the site.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara litigator A. Barry Cappello, who represented the
plaintiffs, said the ruling is significant not only for his clients
but for California residents who file federal claims against alleged
polluters.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing spokesman Dan Beck said company officials were considering
whether to appeal.</TE>

Angeles Police Officer Chris Zine stops traffic at Sherman Way and
Eton Avenue in Canoga Park, where there is a "smart" crosswalk. Smart
crosswalks have flashing lights that warn drivers when a pedestrian

start at $170. At right, Officer Troy Williams stops a driver.</CP>

<HD>Suit Says Dating Service Is Running a Con Game</HD>
<DH>An online firm is accused of using bogus love letters to
entice men to pay a monthly fee.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Monte Morin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Wouldn't it be great if you could just punch in all the qualities
you wanted in a girlfriend?" asks the computer dating Web site
Ineedanewgirlfriend.com. "Now you can!"</LD>
<LD>   But a class-action lawsuit filed Wednesday in Orange County
Superior Court accuses the service of defrauding users -- not to
mention breaking their hearts.</LD>
<LD>   Consumer attorney Neil B. Fineman contends that the dating service
e-mailed bogus love notes to lonely bachelors to get them to pony up
the $25-a-month membership fee. Though men can post personal profiles
on the Web site for free -- listing their age, occupation, likes and
dislikes -- they must pay to reply to messages from prospective
dates.</LD>
<TE>   The lawsuit says that bogus e-mails with photos of beautiful women
were sent to men asking them for a reply or for a date. Once the men
paid their membership fees and e-mailed the women, they never heard
back, it says. The plaintiff in the suit, a 35-year-old paralegal,
says he was suckered into paying the membership fee after he received
a steady stream of e-mails with photos of attractive women. He wants
a refund.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of the Web site did not return e-mails or phone
calls seeking comment Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   To prove his client's contention, Fineman says, he concocted a
handful of cyber straw men -- false profiles of men he believed no
woman would want to be involved with. They were the Internet's most
ineligible bachelors, he said: hard-drinking, overweight, out-of-work
men. Their goal, he stated in their profiles, was to meet rich,
beautiful women who would support them.</TE>
<TE>   The offers came rolling in.</TE>
<TE>   "You sound HOT!" stated one reply, which included a photo of an
attractive woman in a bikini. "I have a never-ending amount of money
that my parents left me and would like to spend it on you. We can
vacation year-round and stay drunk the whole time. Please say you
will meet me."</TE>
<TE>   Fineman said "women" who responded to his bogus profiles had
varying backgrounds. "One claimed to have strong Christian values and
was looking for a man to go on long walks on the beach," the lawyer
said. "Another woman worked for a company selling adult toys and was
interested in 'experimenting.' "</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, the plaintiff's made-up profiles generated
identical replies, although the names and photos were different, the
lawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way these beautiful women could have actually been
interested in the jerks we made up," Fineman said.</TE>
<TE>   Fineman's client is identified in court papers only as E.A.B.; he
did not use his full name, he said in an interview, because he's
embarrassed about his predicament. He will be required by the court
to identify himself once the case goes to depositions -- if it is not
settled before then.</TE>
<TE>   "They're taking advantage of a very vulnerable class of people,"
the man said. "A lot of us aren't doing very well in the dating
scene. What they're doing is putting a hook in front of your face
with a worm on it, but it's not a worm, it's a pretty girl."</TE>
<TE>   The Web site bills itself as a tool for men to meet women with
similar interests. "Avoid the bar scene! Or the endless blind date
fix-ups from 'concerned' friends and relatives!" the site proclaims.
"How long can you leave everything to chance?"</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiff said he was surprised -- and a little suspicious --
at the number of e-mails he received from women when he posted his
profile. With other computer dating services, he said, he has only
occasionally received unsolicited e-mails from women. And messages
from women with model-like features are even rarer.</TE>
<TE>   After getting e-mails from three women, he decided to pay for a
membership, he said, but the nascent romances fizzled immediately
when nobody messaged him back.</TE>

<HD>Davis Asks Bush to Aid County Health System</HD>
<DH>Governor seeks waiver of U.S. regulations in bid to keep
local hospitals open.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeffrey L. Rabin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Faced with a worsening state budget crisis, the Davis administration
formally asked the federal government Wednesday to provide additional
resources to stabilize Los Angeles County's financially ailing public
health system.</LD>
<LD>   The request came in a formal application to the Bush
administration for a waiver of federal Medicaid regulations to allow
more creative use of federal funds to provide health care for the
state's poor. No dollar amount was put on the request, but state
officials hoped that it could amount to more than $300 million over
the next three years.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis and top state health officials said the financial
crisis that threatened to close two public hospitals and health
clinics in Los Angeles cannot be solved without Washington's help.</LD>
<TE>   "We're hopeful the federal government will respond positively to
that request," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   State and county officials hope to have face-to-face negotiations
with their federal counterparts in Washington next month, but no
meeting has been scheduled yet.</TE>
<TE>   After dishing up pre-Thanksgiving meals for the poor on Los
Angeles' skid row, Davis told reporters that the state simply does
not have any extra money to assist the county health system.</TE>
<TE>   "The county knew full well that we did not have any extra money,"
Davis said. "They did not ask us for extra money."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Davis said, the state and county have adopted a joint
approach, asking that the federal government approve the waiver so
the state can use Medicaid funds more creatively.</TE>
<TE>   Officials in Sacramento and Los Angeles are hopeful that the Bush
administration will look favorably on the request because it
incorporates elements suggested by Tom Scully, a top federal health
official.</TE>
<TE>   Scully, who heads the federal Medicaid program, toured the two
full-service county hospitals threatened with closure -- Harbor-UCLA
Medical Center near Torrance and Olive View-UCLA Medical Center in
Sylmar -- the day after the Nov. 5 election.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors postponed until mid-January any move to close the two
hospitals after voters this month overwhelmingly approved a property
tax increase designed to keep the county's trauma centers open.</TE>
<TE>   Zev Yaroslavsky, chairman of the county Board of Supervisors, said
the federal assistance would allow the county to keep its four major
hospitals open, as well as maintaining a network of outpatient
clinics and health centers.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very modest proposal. This proposal is not the silver
bullet that is going to solve the county's health-care crisis,"
Yaroslavsky said.</TE>
<TE>   But the federal help, combined with the $170 million a year the
county will receive from the property tax increase, would avert
draconian cuts in the health-care system.</TE>
<TE>   The county health services director, Dr. Thomas Garthwaite, said
during a telephone conference call with the governor and state
officials that the federal assistance would stabilize the county
health system for five years and avoid significant cuts in services.</TE>
<TE>   It is now up to the federal government to act on the request.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Scully said the state's proposal had not arrived
and he would have no comment on the request until it had been
analyzed fully.</TE>
<TE>   Grantland Johnson, the governor's secretary of health and human
services, told reporters that the federal government needs to work as
the senior partner with the state in providing the flexibility needed
to use Medicaid funds.</TE>
<TE>   "We simply can't provide that kind of assistance to Los Angeles
County and other counties," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the complicated proposal submitted to Washington, the state
is requesting federal approval to contract with select hospitals for
services provided to poor patients covered by the Medicaid program,
known in California as Medi-Cal.</TE>
<TE>   If the request is granted, state officials believe, it will be
possible for the county to receive $100 million a year for the next
three years.</TE>
<TE>   The state is also calling on Washington not to penalize counties
for trying to move patients from expensive inpatient care at
hospitals to less costly outpatient treatment at health centers and
clinics.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal would allow a county health system that treats a
disproportionate share of poor people to maintain its current level
of funding, even as its volume of hospital patients declines. The
money saved on hospital care could be used to cover outpatient
services.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Jack Lewin, chief executive officer of the California Medical
Assn., praised the package being sent to Washington and said the
trauma care crisis in Los Angeles is now on the governor's radar
screen.</TE>
<TE>   But Supervisor Mike Antonovich was less charitable about the
governor's proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "In the tradition of David Copperfield, the governor has performed
a great illusion in advocating this health plan," Antonovich said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a half-measure for the governor and it's very
disappointing," he added.</TE>

<HD>Nurses Accuse Cedars-Sinai of Blocking Union Bid</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Y. Hong</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nurses at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on Wednesday urged Atty. Gen.
Bill Lockyer to investigate possible violations of state laws by the
hospital, saying Cedars-Sinai managers have illegally tried to thwart
a union organizing drive.</LD>
<LD>   Nurses at the West Los Angeles hospital are scheduled to vote next
month whether to join the California Nurses Assn. Some allege that
since September, when nurses successfully petitioned for a union
election, the hospital has required them to attend meetings they
describe as "union-busting sessions."</LD>
<LD>   Cedars-Sinai nurses and the California Nursing Assn. say the
hospital hired labor relations consultants to conduct the meetings
and advise managers on fighting the union drive. Because the hospital
receives state funds, the union contends Cedars-Sinai used public
money including Medi-Cal reimbursements to pay for an antiunion
campaign, which would violate state law.</LD>
<TE>   Jean Flores, a senior vice president at Cedars-Sinai, said the
hospital is trying to persuade nurses to oppose the union in the
elections to be held Dec. 11-13, but is doing so legally.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in a campaign. We do not believe a union is in the
organization's or nurses' best interest, and we are making that
position clear. But we are doing so within the limits of the law,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Three nurses from the hospital, joined by half a dozen union
members, met with Lockyer at his downtown Los Angeles office. Lockyer
spokesman Nathan Barankin said the office is investigating the union
claim, but as yet there is "no determination any law was broken."</TE>
<TE>   The union and nurses also filed a complaint with the National
Labor Relations Board, saying the hospital broke federal labor laws.
They allege the hospital interrogated nurses about the union drive,
conducted surveillance of nurses and threatened to fire employees
supporting the union.</TE>
<TE>   Cedars-Sinai vice president Flores said the charges are "without
merit," but declined to address specific allegations. "We will
respond to the NLRB when we see the evidence," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The California Nurses Assn. seeks to represent about 1,500 of the
2,000 registered nurses at the hospital. The union is seeking a
pension for the nurses, and has pointed out numerous limits on wages
and benefits in the last several years as reasons nurses should
unionize.</TE>
<TE>   Flores said due to antitrust restrictions, the hospital cannot
disclose the average pay of its registered nurses. Rosanna Grigorian,
an operating room nurse who was among those who met with Lockyer,
estimated registered nurses at the hospital earn an average of $32 an
hour.</TE>
<TE>   Grigorian and colleagues said that since the union organizing
effort began, they have been called to numerous meetings in which
managers distributed antiunion literature and argued against forming
a union. In some meetings, nurses were shown a video documentary
about a strike by registered nurses last month at Long Beach Memorial
Medical Center. Nurses there voted in November 2001 for
representation by the California Nurses Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Sharlyn Santa Romana, a neonatal nurse at Cedars-Sinai, said the
only Long Beach Memorial nurses featured in the video were those
critical of the union. She said the video was part of an hourlong
"union-busting meeting" she was required to attend.</TE>
<TE>   Cedars-Sinai vice president Flores said the hospital has conducted
two types of meetings concerning unionization for nurses. She said
Chief Executive Thomas Priselac and Chief Nursing Officer Linda
Burnes Bolton have held more than 40 voluntary informational meetings
with small groups of nurses. Nurses have also been required to attend
classes on wages and benefits and labor law.</TE>
<TE>   When asked about the video screenings on the Long Beach nurses'
strike, Flores said the documentary was shown during regular staff
meetings. "I do not know if they were voluntary or mandatory, but
other issues were discussed as well.... Managers meet with staff all
the time."</TE>

<HD>For Some, Feast Is a First</HD>
<DH>Immigrants are treated to traditional Thanksgiving dinners
in Santa Ana.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claire Luna and Jennifer Mena</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's been a while since the first Thanksgiving, but Cecilia Michua
still sees the parallels between her family and the group of English
immigrants who celebrated a good harvest 381 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Michua's family came to Santa Ana eight years ago from Colima,
Mexico, in search of greater opportunities but never had enough set
aside to celebrate the holiday.</LD>
<LD>   But Wednesday night, Michua, along with her sister, mother and
three children, devoured plates of turkey, stuffing and mashed
potatoes in their first-ever Thanksgiving, courtesy of the Santa Ana
Boys &amp; Girls Club.</LD>
<TE>   Many said the club's event, which served about 800 low-income
families, gave them their first opportunity to celebrate the holiday.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have the money to follow this tradition on our own,"
said Michua, 31, alternately eating, then tending to her toddler
sons. "But it means a lot to be able to participate in something that
is such a big part of American history. It's like we're the Pilgrims
and the people at the club are the Indians."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Wednesday, another group of immigrants learned the meaning
of Thanksgiving at an event sponsored by Cambodian Family, a
nonprofit organization in Santa Ana that serves refugees from many
countries. About 200 ate a traditional turkey dinner before watching
a dance by a woman in a Cambodian dragon costume and a play in which
adult students learning English played the parts of Pilgrims and
Indians.</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Ana, where more than 22% of the city's roughly 340,000
residents came to this country just in the last decade, volunteers
said the charity events are more about introducing immigrants to
strong U.S. traditions than about serving a token meal to the poor.</TE>
<TE>   "With a lot of the laws and policies passed in regard to
immigrants, I could easily see them wondering if they're really
wanted here," said Bob Coyle, a Boys &amp; Girls Club board member, using
his hands to tear apart one of the 60 turkeys bought for the event.
"This is a way to show them that we do."</TE>
<TE>   Families heard about the Boys &amp; Girls Club event through
invitations issued by teachers in the Santa Ana Unified School
District. They came in half-hour waves throughout the evening,
consuming 60 pumpkin pies and 120 pounds of mashed potatoes along
with the turkeys.</TE>
<TE>   At the Cambodia Family-sponsored event, it was only the first or
second Thanksgiving celebration for some of the guests, who came from
Mexico, Cambodia, Vietnam and Russia. Many live in the nearby Minnie
Street apartments, once the most troubled in Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   "This holiday is about an American story. It's one that I am a
part of now," said Serey Ky, who emigrated from Cambodia last month
with his wife and daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Ky will join his sister's family today for turkey, but the family
will also eat a traditional curry dish of potatoes and vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   Children were a vital part of both events. Preschoolers sang
Thanksgiving songs after the Cambodia Family dinner, and each adult
at the club was accompanied by children.</TE>
<TE>   Juana Ortega, 32, a mother of two, came to the United States 11
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The Cambodia Family event allowed her to introduce her children to
an American tradition.</TE>
<TE>   "It does not have a big meaning for me, but I want them to know
they are from here and that Thanksgiving can be theirs too," Ortega
said.</TE>
<TE>   Today, she will prepare turkey Mexican style, with chiles and
served with tortillas, rice and beans.</TE>
<TE>   Like the Michua family, Francesca Frieoros had never celebrated
Thanksgiving before Wednesday night's event at the Boys &amp; Girls Club.
Sitting around a table festooned with balloons in the club's gym, the
25-year-old ate with her aunt and two sons.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to finally have a chance to get into the American
spirit," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We were never fortunate enough to do our own Thanksgiving before,
but now we have the chance to share the tradition with the whole
family."</TE>

<HD>Bail Set for Suspect With Famous Clients</HD>

<LD>Over the objections of prosecutors, a judge set bail Wednesday for a
celebrated private investigator suspected of possessing explosives
and of hiring a man to threaten a Los Angeles Times reporter.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Court Magistrate Fernando M. Olguin set bail at
$400,000 for Anthony Pellicano, who has worked for celebrities such
as Elizabeth Taylor and Michael Jackson. His lawyer predicted he
would make bail and be released in time for Thanksgiving dinner at
home.</LD>
<LD>   "I think he will have a pretty good Thanksgiving," Donald M. Re,
Pellicano's attorney, said after the bail hearing in federal court in
Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   A scruffy-looking Pellicano, bound with waist chains and
handcuffs, declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Olguin rejected a contention by prosecutors that Pellicano is a
danger to the community. The magistrate said he agreed to set bail
after reviewing letters of support for the defendant from friends and
relatives, many of whom attended the hearing, and because Pellicano
had no criminal record.</TE>
<TE>   Olguin noted that he was concerned about "weight of the evidence,
which, like the government says, is strong."</TE>
<TE>   Pellicano has been charged with possession of two unregistered
hand grenades, which were reportedly discovered by federal agents in
a safe at his Hollywood office on Sunset Boulevard. Assistant U.S.
Atty. Daniel Saunders said Pellicano had conceded that he owned the
safe and that he was the only one with the combination.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said they also found military plastic explosives,
blasting caps, about $200,000 in cash, gold bullion and jewelry.</TE>
<TE>   They found those items while searching for evidence of Pellicano's
alleged involvement in a plot to threaten a Times reporter, Anita
Busch, who was investigating actor Steven Seagal. A search warrant
affidavit states that authorities believed Pellicano hired and paid
Alexander Proctor, 59, to burn the car of Busch, who had been
investigating the relationship between Seagal and a reputed Mafia
associate.</TE>
<TE>   Proctor has been accused of placing a dead fish, a rose and a
one-word sign reading "Stop" on Busch's car.</TE>
<TE>   In a secretly recorded conversation, Proctor allegedly told an FBI
informant that he had been paid by Pellicano to carry out the threat
on behalf of Seagal, who has denied involvement.</TE>
<TE>   The evidence was not discussed Wednesday. The judge refused to
allow prosecutors to discuss the threats unless they released the
sealed search warrant affidavit to defense attorneys. Olguin said the
alleged threats were not relevant to the weapons charges on which
Pellicano is being held.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, he cut Saunders off when the prosecutor noted that
Pellicano had been quoted in a news story as saying he uses fear
tactics only when he has to.</TE>
<TE>   Saunders argued unsuccessfully that illegal possession of
explosives made Pellicano a danger to the community.</TE>
<TE>   Saunders argued that Pellicano had offered no good explanation for
having the devices.</TE>
<TE>   Re said Pellicano had forgotten about some of the explosives, that
he had obtained them from a client and that he had intended to find a
way to safely discard them.</TE>

<HD>Hospital Faces 3rd Suit Over Sexual Abuse</HD>
<DH>The claim is stayed, however, as Pine Grove psychiatric
facility's parent company files for bankruptcy protection.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Fausset</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A West Hills psychiatric hospital, already facing possible sanctions
from Los Angeles County mental health officials, is confronting its
third negligence lawsuit in two years stemming from allegations of
inappropriate sexual encounters between employees and patients.</LD>
<LD>   But the plaintiff's attorney, David Ring, learned Wednesday that
the lawsuit has been stayed indefinitely because Pine Grove
Hospital's parent company, Arizona-based Doctors Community Healthcare
Corp., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this month.
Another lawsuit against the hospital that Ring is also handling has
also been stayed.</LD>
<LD>   Doctors Community additionally owns Pacifica Hospital in Sun
Valley. Officials for both Pacifica and Pine Grove said that the
hospitals' operations will not be affected as the company reorganizes
its debts.</LD>
<TE>   Pine Grove and Doctors Community were named in a civil complaint
filed Wednesday by Ring on behalf of a 15-year-old girl who had sex
with former hospital employee Angel Vargas shortly after she was
released from the facility.</TE>
<TE>   The incident is one of five that law enforcement authorities have
investigated in the last three years involving the sexual molestation
of Pine Grove patients and former patients.</TE>
<TE>   Three suspects -- Vargas, fellow health worker Quincy Crawford and
a 17-year-old male patient -- were convicted of sexually assaulting
teenage girls they met at Pine Grove. Two other former employees were
investigated for separate molestation allegations but were not
prosecuted.</TE>
<TE>   According to court records, Vargas, 38, propositioned the mentally
ill girl while she was a patient in August 1999. After the girl left
the hospital, Vargas met her for sex in a Santa Clarita park in early
2000.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas was released last week from a Los Angeles County jail,
where he served two months of a four-month sentence after pleading
guilty to unlawful intercourse with a minor. He had been fired from
his job in June 2000 for unrelated reasons, court papers show.</TE>
<TE>   The civil action accuses Vargas of unlawful sex with a minor and
infliction of emotional distress. It also alleges that the hospital
failed to properly train workers such as Vargas in dealing with
vulnerable girls.</TE>
<TE>   The girl, who is now 17, was admitted to the hospital in August
1999 to be treated for suicidal tendencies, split personality
disorder and manic depression. In the complaint filed in Los Angeles
County Superior Court, her family claims Vargas provided counseling
to the victim, then manipulated her into having sex with him.</TE>
<TE>   "He used his position as a mental health worker to manipulate [the
victim's] feelings and emotions at a time in her life when she was
particularly vulnerable," the complaint states.</TE>
<TE>   Ring filed a similar lawsuit on behalf of Crawford's victim, a
13-year-old girl, earlier this year. That case was set to go to trial
Jan. 21.</TE>
<TE>   An adult patient who claims she was sexually assaulted by a
patient filed another negligence lawsuit against the hospital and
Doctors Community in March 2001. That case has since been settled,
according to court records.</TE>
<TE>   The state Department of Health Services began an investigation
into the hospital's policies and practices in October. That probe
could result in a number of sanctions for Pine Grove, from stricter
state monitoring to a ban on federal welfare payments.</TE>
<TE>   After a separate inquiry last month, the county Department of
Mental Health announced that it planned to strip the hospital of its
ability to treat some patients, citing inadequate supervision.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital is appealing that decision. County officials said
they will issue a final ruling on the matter next week.</TE>

<HD>Manager Sought for Preserve</HD>
<DH>City is seeking bids from conservation agencies to oversee
1,300 acres in Chatsworth.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A conservation organization is needed to manage the 1,300-acre
Chatsworth Reservoir nature preserve, Los Angeles officials said on
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The city is seeking bids from qualified organizations to manage
the preserve, which is home to deer, bobcats and ancient Native
American ritual sites, said the Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power, the land's owner.</LD>
<LD>   "I am extremely pleased that finally we have reached this crucial
stage in our continuing efforts to find a qualified
conservation-oriented agency to run this great natural resource,"
said Councilman Hal Bernson, who spearheaded the move to have the
city declare Chatsworth Reservoir a nature preserve about three years
ago.</LD>
<TE>   The new custodians of the land would maintain the property and
also create an environmental education program for the public, said a
spokesman for Bernson, who represents the area.</TE>
<TE>   The DWP has scheduled a meeting with interested parties on Dec. 19
at the agency's downtown headquarters.</TE>

<HD>Priest's Slander Suit Is Rejected</HD>
<DH>A judge dismisses an Orange County cleric's action against
a woman alleging sexual advances.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Anton and Chris O'Connell</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>A judge Wednesday threw out a slander suit brought by a prominent
Orange County priest against a woman who this year received a
$1.2-million sexual-abuse settlement from the Roman Catholic Church.</LD>
<LD>   The case began after Lori Haigh, who had contended she was
molested and impregnated by a priest as a teenager in Orange County,
won the settlement. At an April news conference, she said a second
priest -- Msgr. Lawrence Baird, now spokesman for the Diocese of
Orange -- had made sexual advances 20 years ago when she sought help
with the molestation. Within two weeks, Baird sued for slander.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco Superior Court Judge A. James Robertson said he was
dismissing the slander suit because Baird had made himself a public
figure by holding his own news conference to defend himself against
Haigh's accusation. Public figures, by law, must show there had been
a reckless disregard for the truth to win -- a standard that the
judge found Baird was unable to meet.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think that if he hadn't made the press conference that I
would be finding this," Robertson said. Baird will also have to pay
Haigh's legal bill.</TE>
<TE>   Haigh said she hopes the ruling "gives strength to other victims
not to be intimidated. Because of my youth, my fear, I kept silent
for the longest time."</TE>
<TE>   .... Thank God it's the end of a long process."</TE>
<TE>   Baird, who has denied any wrongdoing, declined to comment. His
attorney, Robert C. Baker, said there are no immediate plans to
appeal. "We're disappointed, obviously," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At Wednesday's hearing, Baker argued that Baird was thrust into
the public eye by Haigh and that he had no choice but to call his own
news conference to defend himself. "It is Lori Haigh that injected
him into the controversy by holding the press conference," Baker
said.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's ruling was granted in response to Haigh's motion that
Baird's suit violated California's anti-SLAPP law -- Strategic
Lawsuits Against Public Participation -- designed to protect
activists from frivolous lawsuits that seek to scare them away.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a lawsuit that should never have happened," Mark
Goldowitz, Haigh's attorney, said after the hearing. "It was brought
to shut her up and to force her to recant. The judge's ruling is a
sign that he's not going to let this happen."</TE>
<TE>   The ruling was praised by victims' advocates, who hope it will
stop priests from suing or threatening to sue their accusers. About
half a dozen such cases have been brought by priests nationwide in
the last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Hallelujah!" said David Clohessy, executive director of the
Chicago-based Survivors Network for those Abused by Priests. "I think
there's nothing more despicable or hurtful than church leaders who
sue victims. People like Lori deserve and need to be praised by
church leaders, not sued."</TE>
<TE>   But Baird's defeat is a blow for priests who are falsely accused
and may have turned to the civil courts as the only way to defend
themselves and their reputations, said Father Robert Silva, president
of the National Federation of Priests Councils.</TE>
<TE>   "It will discourage them" from filing lawsuits, Silva said.
"Priests across the board are feeling very, very vulnerable right now
and no one has come to their defense. They've become the bad guys in
society."</TE>

<HD>Santa Ana's 'Ambassador' McGuigan Steps Down</HD>
<DH>After 21 years on the City Council, its first female member
returns to private life. But she'll stay involved by aiding public
causes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jennifer Mena</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Patricia A. McGuigan, a self-described homemaker on five Santa Ana
City Council election ballots, stepped down Tuesday after nearly 21
years in office.</LD>
<LD>   To many people, she has been much more than her modest ballot
description.</LD>
<LD>   She has been an ambassador from City Hall to cut ribbons and
attend community events. She has helped build parks and develop the
city's downtown Artists Village.</LD>
<TE>   "We will really miss Pat. She makes a great presence. She serves
as a great ambassador," said Councilman Jose Solorio.</TE>
<TE>   McGuigan was Santa Ana's first female council member when elected
in 1981. She retired once in 1992, was appointed to fill a vacancy in
1993 and only stepped down now only because she is not allowed to
serve a third consecutive term. Although she could run again in four
years, McGuigan said she is unlikely to seek another term on the
council or a higher office.</TE>
<TE>   Other council members will have to work to fill the void she
leaves. McGuigan was the only council member who did not have another
job. She also was the council's strongest link to the city's growing
Asian community.</TE>
<TE>   She delivered a farewell speech at a meeting Tuesday when
Councilman Mike Garcia was sworn in.</TE>
<TE>   With Garcia's election, Latinos will constitute a council majority
for the first time in Santa Ana, a city with one of the nation's
highest percentages of Spanish speakers.</TE>
<TE>   But elected officials here like to downplay the new Latino
majority. Similarly, McGuigan -- who has watched Santa Ana's
demographic transformation from City Hall -- has never understood why
ethnicity is a big issue.</TE>
<TE>   "We all want the same things: pride in our neighborhood and
education for our children," said McGuigan, the daughter of Irish
immigrants who came to California from Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   Her biggest moment on the council was when Salgado Community
Center opened in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   The center, which includes a gym, meeting room and pool, was named
after a parks commissioner she had named to the post.</TE>
<TE>   "I had been pushing for the money for years. When it was
dedicated, it was a big day for me," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She also helped develop the Asian-Pacific Advisory Council to help
Vietnamese and Cambodian refugees learn how to get help from City
Hall and become active in city government.</TE>
<TE>   "She has continuously been of great support to the Asian
community," said Rifka Hirsch, executive director of Cambodian
Family. "It's unusual. She took a lot of time and made a long-term
commitment to the Asian community."</TE>
<TE>   McGuigan also takes pride in her role in converting boarded-up
buildings downtown into a thriving commercial district that includes
the Artists Village.</TE>
<TE>   No one expects the 68-year-old widow to go home and watch soap
operas. A mother of four and grandmother of seven, she will probably
keep busy and seek opportunities to promote personal causes.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike in previous Decembers, she'll be absent from the National
League of Cities meeting this year.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, she'll put up the Nativity scene that never seemed to get
out of the box. And maybe she'll even send Christmas cards.</TE>
<TE>   But come 2003, she expects to be serving the public in some way.
"I do not think we have heard the last of Pat McGuigan," said Asian
activist Roy Uno. "She will not rest."</TE>
<TE>   McGuigan agrees: "I don't want to waste my experience. I am going
to find a way to use it so that it continues to help the community."</TE>

<HD>Complaint Against Lab Reinstated</HD>
<DH>Appellate court allows the action, which alleges industrial
pollution sickened neighbors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean Guccione</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal appellate court reinstated a lawsuit Wednesday against two
aerospace companies accused of contaminating the environment around
the Santa Susana Field Laboratory near Chatsworth and causing
neighbors to become sick.</LD>
<LD>   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal, in a 2-1 decision, found
that newspaper articles on contamination at the site could not be
used to throw out 18 of the 52 claims against Boeing North American
and Rockwell International Corp. The remaining claims were rejected
for other reasons.</LD>
<LD>   The court ruled that jurors, not judges, should determine as an
issue of fact whether the plaintiffs knew or should have known about
contamination on and around the lab site within the statutory
limitations for filing such a suit.</LD>
<TE>   "None of the publicity from this period suggested that available
evidence established contamination from the Rocketdyne facilities as
the likely cause, among many possible causes, of public health
problems," Judge Richard A. Paez wrote for the majority.</TE>
<TE>   "The media reports and expressions of community concern about the
contamination were, at best, equivocal about such a link," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The opinion reversed an earlier decision by U.S. District Court
Judge Audrey B. Collins. She had ruled the plaintiffs were barred by
the one-year statute of limitation from proceeding to trial because
they should have suspected earlier that industrial contamination from
the test site had made them ill.</TE>
<TE>   She based that decision on newspaper articles between 1989 and
1991 on the laboratory and alleged contamination around the site.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara litigator A. Barry Cappello, who represented the
plaintiffs, said the 37-page ruling is significant not only for his
clients but for California residents who file federal claims against
alleged polluters.</TE>
<TE>   Cappello applauded the court's application of the less restrictive
federal standard that requires a plaintiff to have "reasonable
knowledge" that injuries were caused by environmental contamination
and not "mere suspicion" as state law requires.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing spokesman Dan Beck said company officials were considering
whether to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   He declined to discuss the potential impact of Wednesday's ruling
except to say that the aerospace giant expects to win at trial.</TE>
<TE>   "We still feel that the plaintiffs' case is without merit or
scientific proof," Beck said.</TE>

<HD>Teen's Shoe Donation Program a Runaway Hit</HD>
<DH>The Thousand Oaks student has collected 1,100 pairs of
athletic footgear for the needy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Chawkins</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the Radnotis' house in Thousand Oaks, the Thanksgiving table will
be laden with the usual goodies, but the garage will be stuffed with
the old shoes of strangers.</LD>
<LD>   It's an incongruity that makes perfect sense if you are
17-year-old Kristina Radnoti and you have founded a group that give
shoes to the homeless.</LD>
<LD>   So far, her drive -- Sole Purpose -- has delivered nearly 1,100
pairs of used athletic footgear to shelters in Ventura County and Los
Angeles. They come from running clubs and track teams, from police
officers and firefighters, from veteran marathoners and Sunday
strollers. They go to poor people a world away from power walks and
fun runs.</LD>
<TE>   Kristina, a senior at Thousand Oaks High School, ran five miles a
day until she was sidelined by surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Now she is a pole vaulter on the school's track team. Her father,
chemical engineer Robert Radnoti, coaches the team, and her brother,
Tom, runs for it. Her mother, Jan, is an avid jogger and met her
husband at a track meet.</TE>
<TE>   So it's not surprising that Kristina would see something of value
where other people might see only tired sneakers moldering in a
closet.</TE>
<TE>   Making a pickup at the East County Sheriff's Station in Thousand
Oaks one recent afternoon, Kristina opened a Santa-sized sack and out
clattered a cornucopia of Nikes, Adidases and New Balances.</TE>
<TE>   "Practically new!" she said, admiring a spotless pair of
gel-cushioned, yellow-trimmed, extra-wide cross trainers.</TE>
<TE>   The booty was bound for her garage. Shoes that are too far gone
will be thrown away. The others will accumulate in the garage along
with piles collected by a few pals in what Kristina calls her "shoe
crew."</TE>
<TE>   When they reach a critical mass as gauged by Kristina's mother,
they will be taken to the shelters.</TE>
<TE>   "Last week we had 181 pairs of shoes out there," Jan Radnoti said
as she cooked dinner for the Thousand Oaks High School girls
cross-country team one recent evening. "I'd reached my limit."</TE>
<TE>   In Camarillo, that meant a windfall for some of the homeless
families living at the shelter run by the Ventura County program
called RAIN, or River-dwellers Intercity Aid Network.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an enormous number of kids and adults in need of simple
things like shoes," said Diana Vogelbaum, the shelter's director.
"They're on their feet all the time. When they sleep out in the open,
they're nervous about taking their shoes off because someone might
steal them."</TE>
<TE>   When Kristina and her friends made a delivery to the shelter a few
months ago, a couple of children couldn't find anything that fit. The
students helped them out with a quick trip to a discount shoe store.</TE>
<TE>   Sole Purpose started in February. Kristina and her mother were
touched by a news show on poverty in Afghanistan. About the same
time, Kristina was casting around for a community-service project to
list on college applications.</TE>
<TE>   "We started brainstorming," Kristina said. "We wanted to deliver
shoes to the Afghans but didn't know how to get them there."</TE>
<TE>   Thinking locally was at first just as frustrating. Going door to
door for old shoes was a bust. Asking to place an empty box and a
sign at a big sporting-goods store meant trying to navigate corporate
bureaucracies.</TE>
<TE>   But it turned out that neighbors holding garage sales couldn't
wait to give away shoes by the bagful. And a local running store --
Future Track in Agoura Hills -- eagerly assisted, setting up a box
for the also-ran shoes of serious runners.</TE>
<TE>   Kristina set up a table at local races. She printed fliers. She
set up a Web site -- www.solepurpose.com. She caught the eye of
Sheila Cox, a Sheriff's Department management assistant who collects
footgear for the cause both at work and in her condo complex.</TE>
<TE>   "People think it's a great idea," Cox said. "Everyone's real happy
to get rid of shoes."</TE>
<TE>   After a while, Kristina developed a zest for marketing. She offers
an iron-on Sole Purpose decal to anyone who brings in a bounty of 50
pairs of shoes. With a note to Runner's World magazine, she was
awarded the publication's monthly "Golden Shoe Award" and a blurb on
her effort.</TE>
<TE>   "We got over 50 e-mails from 22 states," she said, with many
respondents thinking about setting up similar programs in their
communities.</TE>
<TE>   It's too soon to tell whether that will happen, or even if Sole
Purpose will remain afoot after Kristina goes off to college.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the case, the effort has underscored some sad truths for
Kristina and her family.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone asked me if there's still a need for more shoes," Jan
Radnoti said.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought to myself: They must be living in some kind of bubble."</TE>

<HD>New Rules for Schools Criticized</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Doug Smith</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles school officials criticized as unworkable new federal
regulations that will require school districts to offer transfers to
students in low performing schools -- whether or not there is space
for them at better schools.</LD>
<LD>   The rules also will demand that all new teachers assigned to those
underachieving schools be fully credentialed, another daunting goal
for local schools.</LD>
<LD>   "These regulations are a mistake in both those regards for L.A.,"
said Roy Romer, Los Angeles Unified School District superintendent.
"Obviously I can't tell you how we'll handle it at this point."</LD>
<TE>   Romer said he will vigorously lobby Secretary of Education Rod
Paige to set rational goals for implementation. Paige in the past has
praised academic improvements by the nation's second-largest school
district.</TE>
<TE>   "For the secretary to compliment us and to put us in a position
that would drive us backward doesn't make sense," Romer said. "So I
assume there is room for negotiations."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Department of Education officials previously had indicated
that regulations implementing the No Child Left Behind Act signed by
President Bush in January might allow highly crowded school districts
such as L.A. Unified to deny transfers because of lack of space. But
the regulations, which were released Tuesday, said there would be no
cause for denial of a transfer.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, the rule could apply to about 150,000 students in
115 schools identified by the district as low performing based on
test scores.</TE>
<TE>   Theodore Alexander Jr., who heads the district's integration
programs, said a letter informing parents of the transfer option will
go out next week as part of the annual brochure advertising magnet
schools.</TE>
<TE>   Based on past experience, Alexander said, he does not anticipate a
large response because most parents want their children to stay close
to home.</TE>
<TE>   But if there are too many responses, the district cannot comply,
he said. "We cannot give them what is not there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some school districts in Los Angeles County have already sent
letters to parents in their poor performing schools.</TE>
<TE>   Dick Van Der Laan, spokesman for the Long Beach Unified School
District, said only 31 parents, out of 6,700 who received notices,
requested transfers.</TE>
<TE>   About half of them withdrew the requests after being informed that
the school they selected was full, he said, and the district found
space for the other half.</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena schools sent letters to the parents of about 3,000
students in six eligible schools, district spokesman Erik Nasarenko
said.</TE>
<TE>   It received 39 requests for a transfer. Only three were granted.
The remainder were rejected because of lack of space, Nasarenko said.</TE>
<TE>   The credentialing rule not only requires districts to immediately
begin hiring only fully-qualified teachers in low performing schools,
but also sets a deadline for 2005-06 for all teachers to be
credentialed.</TE>
<TE>   This presents a high hurdle for L.A. Unified, where about 8,000
teachers lack credentials.</TE>

<HD>'Railfans' Make Tracks to Admire Engineering Oddity</HD>
<DH>Trains in the Tehachapi Loop run through a tunnel, then a
circle, climbing to cross above themselves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Pool</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What goes around comes around when you talk technology in Tehachapi.</LD>
<LD>   Not the 21st century kind, depicted by the 5,000
futuristic-looking turbine propellers that line mountaintops east of
town and spin in unison in the wind to generate electricity.</LD>
<LD>   But the 19th century type: the stretch of rail track north of town
that causes locomotives to cross over the cars they are pulling.</LD>
<TE>   The Tehachapi Loop is a 3,799-foot-long rail circle that was built
in 1876 to allow trains to cross the Tehachapi Mountains and travel
between Los Angeles and the Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   Southbound trains making the Loop pass through a tunnel and then
complete a tight, counterclockwise loop, gently climbing 77 feet
before crossing back over the tunnel -- and above themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The Loop conquered a troublesome ridge near the top of the
4,000-foot Tehachapi Summit by keeping the track grade at 2.2% -- the
maximum that rail firms were willing to make steam engines climb.</TE>
<TE>   Southern Pacific Railroad engineer William Hood designed the Loop
as part of a 16-mile mountain track segment that included 18 tunnels
totaling 8,240 feet in length.</TE>
<TE>   Hood's feat is observed everywhere in Tehachapi, located 115 miles
north of Los Angeles in Kern County.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago the city of 6,780 dedicated its first historic
mural: a 60-foot-wide, panoramic painting of the Loop on the side of
the Tehachapi Lumber Co. that shows post-World War II locomotives
passing over it. The depiction of that era is also a nod to another
seminal event in Tehachapi: a disastrous 1952 earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Caboose restaurant includes a coin-operated model of the
Loop. A photographic history and Tehachapi Loop factoids cover the
dining room wall of Kelcy's Restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   About 3,000 laborers from Canton, China, constructed the tracks.
They were paid $26 a month and used 500 one-horse carts on the
project.</TE>
<TE>   The white cross in the center of the Loop (which is privately
owned ranchland) is more contemporary. It was erected by railroad
workers in memory of conductor Everett Crown and brakeman Allen
Riess, killed in a 1989 derailment in San Bernardino.</TE>
<TE>   At the corner of F and Haynes streets, a collection of old
railroad signals stands in the backyard of the late Bill Stokoe, a
railroad worker who collected them from the Loop and elsewhere along
the summit track.</TE>
<TE>   The antique semaphores and mechanical arms will be relocated to a
railroad museum planned for the Tehachapi train station, said Doug
Pickard, who runs the Trains Etc model train shop across the street
from the faded building. Locals hope to refurbish the wooden station
and finish the museum by 2004, the depot's 100th anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   The Loop itself is Tehachapi's biggest draw. Pickard said that
"railfans" -- hobbyists who photograph trains, collect locomotive
numbers and count boxcars -- come from all over the world to see it.</TE>
<TE>   "In four days guys will fly in from Japan, watch trains and then
turn around and go home," said Pickard, a former Long Beach aerospace
engineer. "One man from the Bay Area comes every Labor Day and
Memorial Day and hires a porta-potty for the other railfans to use
down there."</TE>
<TE>   Tehachapi history buff Marjorie Miller said she and other locals
are continually amazed by how devoted outsiders are to the Loop,
whose 60 to 65 trains a day are said to make it the world's busiest
single-tracked mainline.</TE>
<TE>   "It's mind-boggling how many people go out there and sit and
photograph them," she said. "There are a tremendous number of
railroad enthusiasts out there."</TE>
<TE>   On a hill overlooking the Loop, Nick Collins, a software
administrator from Santa Clara, and John Pavelchak, a mall property
manager from Lodi, N.J., watched reverently as a mile-long train
passed over itself.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen this place on movies and videos. Now I'm here," said
Pavelchak. "It's so beautiful," Collins added.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Hoeser, a Durand, Wis., pharmacist, was videotaping trains
crossing the Loop for a friend in Australia. He had made a brief
visit four years ago and failed to see any trains.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew that day that they were doing track work and trains would
not be running. But I wanted to be able to say I'd been here in case
I never got back here again," he explained.</TE>
<TE>   But like others, Hoeser was concerned that this visit might be his
last.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last month, railroad officials have tightened security
near tracks in response to reported terrorist threats to the nation's
transportation system. Train crews have been instructed to report
"suspicious-looking" people to railroad police or local authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Railfans across the country have reported being questioned and in
some cases detained for taking pictures of trains and making notes of
equipment and cargo they've seen.</TE>
<TE>   One Texas train hobbyist was grilled by police and the FBI for
five hours.</TE>
<TE>   "I can understand authorities being concerned. But train crews
ought to be able to pretty much tell who the good guys are," Hoeser
said of his fellow railfans.</TE>
<TE>   John Bromley, a spokesman for Union Pacific Railroad, which
operates the Tehachapi Loop tracks, said crews have been asked "to be
vigilant and report trespassers and anything unusual." But he said no
railfan problems at the Loop have been listed on his company's daily
incident report.</TE>
<TE>   Spokeswoman Lena Kent of Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe, whose
trains also use the Loop, declined to comment on security measures.</TE>
<TE>   But Ron Pettit, the Union Pacific manager in charge of the Loop,
said train buffs should expect no trouble if they don't trespass on
railroad property.</TE>
<TE>   "If I tried to stop people from taking pictures at the Loop I'd
probably be lynched," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "You should see the place on a holiday like Memorial Day. People
are parked around it, watching trains. It looks like a KOA
campground."</TE>

at 2.2%, the maximum that railroad companies were willing to make
steam engines climb. The Loop attracts railroad buffs from around the

<HD>New Security Gets a Stamp of Approval</HD>
<DH>Travelers praise precautions as federal screeners work
their first holiday weekend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Caitlin Liu, John L. Mitchell and Hugo Martin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the start of the busiest holiday travel weekend, an army of new
federal airport security screeners Wednesday handled a passenger
traffic flow that was moderately higher than a year ago with few
reported snags and generally positive reviews from travelers.</LD>
<LD>   This Thanksgiving weekend is expected to be the first big test for
the nation's 30,000 new federally trained and hired security
screeners, who were deployed over the last few weeks. But the
normally long holiday lines at airports throughout Southern
California were for the most part painlessly short and passengers for
the most part were accepting of the new workers and the extra
security measures.</LD>
<LD>   "The screeners are very professional," said Alan Olson, 55, who
was traveling to Las Vegas from Los Angeles International Airport on
Wednesday. "They seem to know what they are doing, and I travel all
the time."</LD>
<TE>   Some passengers who quit flying after Sept. 11, 2001, said they
have slowly regained their faith in air travel, partly because of
improvements in screening and security throughout the airline
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Passenger Beverly Wright of Lake Forest in southern Orange County
said she stopped flying for nine months after the terrorist attacks.
But on Wednesday, she was getting ready to board a plane for Dallas
from John Wayne Airport to visit relatives for Thanksgiving.</TE>
<TE>   "I like all the precautions and security measures," she said. "The
airlines seem more attentive about safety now. The federal screeners
seem better trained. It gives you a good feeling."At Los Angeles
International Airport, the world's fifth-busiest airport, officials
predicted that 800,000 travelers would pass through this weekend, up
16% over last year's 690,000 passengers. But the increase won't
offset the dramatic decline since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
During Thanksgiving 2000, LAX served a record 925,000.</TE>
<TE>   Airport officials in Burbank, San Diego, Ontario and San Francisco
expected an increase of 5% to 7% in travelers over last year.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, John Wayne Airport is expected to handle almost
100,000 passengers for the Thanksgiving travel period, which runs
from Wednesday to Sunday. About 97,000 travelers passed through the
facility at this time last year.</TE>
<TE>   Automobile travel this holiday weekend is expected to increase by
1.2% over last year, according to the Automobile Club of Southern
California. The most popular destinations for Southern Californians
include Las Vegas, Disneyland and Palm Springs.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the travel industry, in particular the airlines, continues
to suffer the lingering effects of the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The airlines' share of security costs has soared since the
attacks, and those costs are one reason the airline industry is
suffering one of its worst periods in history. The airlines have been
pressing Congress for help in paying for their higher security and
insurance expenses.</TE>
<TE>   The industry lost more than $7 billion last year and is expected
to lose at least that much this year. US Airways is operating under
Bankruptcy Court protection, and United Airlines, the largest
operator at LAX and San Francisco International Airport and the
nation's second-largest carrier after American, may file for
bankruptcy reorganization within the next few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the increase in passenger volume at Southern California
airports, officials said the new security measures were adding five
to 10 minutes to the waiting time for passenger boardings.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new measures, passengers at most airports must get a
boarding pass or ticket before they can enter the security screening
area. Checked luggage is scanned with an X-ray machine. Most carry-on
luggage is closely searched by hand. Many travelers are instructed to
remove their shoes, belts and hats for closer scrutiny. A passenger
who sets off a stationary metal detector must be searched by
screeners using hand-held metal detectors.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Moyer, a 38-year-old software engineer who was flying home
to Spokane, Wash., from Burbank, said he was pleasantly surprised by
the increased security measures.</TE>
<TE>   He said screeners scanned his saxophone case through an X-ray
machine and were able to tell that is was not just a saxophone but
that it was an alto sax. "I look back now and it was a joke....
Security is real now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone was happy with the increased measures.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Sanchez, a 17-year-old West Hills resident who was flying out
of Burbank to Seattle to visit family, complained that a screener
ordered him to remove his shoes, belt and a gold chain around his
neck.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a jerk," Sanchez said of the screener. "He gave me
attitude."</TE>
<TE>   Satik Mannoki Massihi, 44, of Glendale and Teresa Larena, 46, of
Atwater Village have more profound reasons to be unhappy with the new
screeners.</TE>
<TE>   The two women, both single mothers, lost their jobs as screeners
at Burbank Airport to the new federal workers.</TE>
<TE>   Both women earned about $12 an hour but lost the jobs because
neither is an American citizen. Their last day is Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "The holiday will be a problem for me," said Larena, who has a
9-year-old son. "I don't have a job. No money. No nothing."</TE>

<HD>A Second Miracle Bonds Twins' Family</HD>
<DH>With mother and father living in the hospital room, four
people have formed a tight unit.</DH>

<LD>The homesick parents of formerly conjoined twins were disappointed
when doctors at UCLA abruptly postponed their return to Guatemala
last month. But nurses and social workers said this week that the
time in the hospital has brought about something almost as amazing as
the surgical feat of separation.</LD>
<LD>   Amid the fluorescent lights and clicking machines of the pediatric
ward, the twins and their parents, who had not lived together before
June, have become a close-knit family.</LD>
<LD>   "They have come into their own as parents," said social worker
Nancy Hall. "I don't know how they've done it. I'm used to this
country, and I speak English, and I don't know that I could have done
as good a job."</LD>
<TE>   Maria de Jesus and Maria Teresa Quiej Alvarez, 16 months old,
arrived in Los Angeles in June with their mother, Alba Leticia
Alvarez, 22. Their skulls were fused at the top of the head, their
bright brown eyes facing opposite directions. They had spent most of
their lives in a Guatemala City hospital, and their parents had been
able to visit them only a few times a month, after an arduous
five-hour bus ride from their village.</TE>
<TE>   In August, a team of UCLA surgeons took Las Maritas, as they are
known in Guatemala, into the operating room for a marathon 22-hour
separation.</TE>
<TE>   The surgery, donated by UCLA and costing more than $1.5 million,
drew worldwide attention. It prompted prayer vigils across Guatemala
and sent the media stampeding to the doorstep of the overwhelmed
parents, who social workers say were already suffering from culture
shock.</TE>
<TE>   After the separation, the girls improved slowly. They stopped
reaching their little hands over their heads searching for each other
and began to take delight in looking into each other's eyes.</TE>
<TE>   The connection between the girls stuns their nurses. When Maria
Teresa, who has been slower to recover than her sister, is not
feeling well, Maria de Jesus will refuse to eat too. Each girl is
also keenly aware of how much attention the other receives, and if
one seems to get more than her share, the other will make her
displeasure known, nurses said.</TE>
<TE>   They are endlessly fascinated by each other's faces. One day,
nurse Margo Goldman walked over to Maria Teresa with the other twin
in her arms. The girls stared at each other for more than 10 minutes,
Goldman said, while she barely breathed. Then Maria de Jesus' face
burst into a grin and she laughed in delight.</TE>
<TE>   "They are amazing girls," Goldman said. "They give so much love,
it's unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   Michaela Franco, a nurse who has cared for the girls since they
arrived, said this is why she became a nurse.</TE>
<TE>   "When we were told we were going to admit Guatemalan conjoined
twins, we did not expect to have two clever, beautiful ... vibrant
separate beings with poignantly distinct personalities," she said.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 27, Maria de Jesus moved from the intensive care unit to
a room on the pediatric floor. Her sister followed shortly after, and
their parents left a relatives' house in Culver City and moved into
the girls' room.</TE>
<TE>   That's when the second miracle occurred, nurses and social workers
say.</TE>
<TE>   Until this fall, Alvarez had never consistently diapered her
babies or fed them. The girls were more accustomed to the hospital
workers in Guatemala, who were their day-to-day caregivers. It was
the same with their father, Wenceslao Quiej Lopez, 21.</TE>
<TE>   All that has changed.</TE>
<TE>   Maria de Jesus typically wakes first, nurses said, and her father
is right there with her. More outgoing than his wife, he is trying to
learn English, and practices it with Maria de Jesus as he puts her in
her high chair and gives her a bottle.</TE>
<TE>   "Good morning," he says. "Not cry ... OK?"</TE>
<TE>   De Jesus, as her nurses call her, usually responds with a giggle.
Before the separation, she was the smaller and quieter of the twins,
but she has blossomed into an extroverted toddler who loves imitating
others' expressions and reaching out to grab their noses.</TE>
<TE>   After breakfast, the parents bathe their girls together and then
dress them from an array of freshly laundered dresses.</TE>
<TE>   Their days then pass in a blur of physical and occupational
therapy.</TE>
<TE>   The girls have a tendency to tilt their heads because their
muscles and bones had grown that way. In part, this caused the delay
in their homecoming. Maria de Jesus' tendency to sleep on one side
put pressure on the skin graft on her head and prevented it from
healing. In the last few weeks, she has been given special cushions,
has had her head repositioned while she sleeps and has been treated
with a growth factor to accelerate healing.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, doctors also have discovered that Maria Teresa has
suffered hearing loss in one ear, perhaps as a result of the surgery.</TE>
<TE>   They caution that both girls still face significant rehabilitation
back home in Guatemala.</TE>
<TE>   But a new life awaits them there. In the works are a possible new
job for their father, a donated apartment in Guatemala City and a new
house in Belen, their impoverished hometown on the country's south
coast.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the family will mark Thanksgiving in the pediatric ward.</TE>
<TE>   Plastic surgeon Henry Kawamoto said the family "should reach
Guatemala in plenty of time to hear their relatives sing, 'Feliz
Navidad.' "</TE>

<HD>Lakers Still Off on Road</HD>
<DH>Bryant matches McGrady with 38 points, but Orlando hands
L.A. its seventh loss in a row away from home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>In the aftermath of another Laker loss, Kobe Bryant was defiant
again.</LD>
<LD>   Shaquille O'Neal sat not far away, with his elbows on his thighs,
in this town he calls home, and said the Lakers need to be better,
soon.</LD>
<LD>   Phil Jackson, 20 minutes before, had said he was disappointed by
the effort in Wednesday night's 112-102 loss to the Orlando Magic, a
game played frantically by Bryant and Tracy McGrady -- each scored 38
points, most on each other's heads.</LD>
<TE>   But only Bryant was outwardly angry, at his teammates, at what the
Lakers' first month has become, at loss after loss in pursuit of a
fourth consecutive NBA title.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are 5-11. They have lost seven consecutive road games
for the first time in 28 seasons. They are 0-for-Florida after going
0-for-Texas last week, and they continue to drift with Golden State
at the bottom of the Pacific Division, and it might be amusing if it
weren't so near December.</TE>
<TE>   "We can still win 71," Jackson said, jamming square humor into
round gloom. "But we'll have to turn it around."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, who scored 28 points in 36 minutes, was supposed to solve
this, but he's a work in progress, and then so are the Lakers, and in
the meantime it's getting worse before it gets better.</TE>
<TE>   In the game, Bryant stood opposite McGrady, two of the league's
prolific scorers, Bryant seemingly carrying the weight of the Lakers
on every jumper, McGrady not quite so anchored.</TE>
<TE>   "It had nothing to do with him playing defense," Bryant said. "It
had nothing to do with us battling. It had everything to do with us
trying to win the game. That's the reason I play the game. Guys were
out of rhythm. Shots weren't falling. Shaq's out of the game. I can't
sit back and let these guys have a 10-0 run on us, stay in the
triangle and swing the ball around and miss wide-open shots. That
can't happen. I gotta get to the free-throw line, I gotta be more
aggressive, try to put an end to their run."</TE>
<TE>   They weren't Jackson's favorite moments, probably, but they were
unforgettable anyway; McGrady posting Bryant on the left block,
holding him off with his left arm, begging for the basketball and
getting it; Bryant, already with the ball on the right wing, nose to
nose with McGrady, measuring his first step.</TE>
<TE>   In an enthralling sequence in the second quarter, McGrady faked
left, Bryant went with him and then stumbled, leaving McGrady open
for a 17-foot turn-around jumper that fell as the crowd gasped and
then roared.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant took the ball back, rocked 20 feet from the rim, stepped
left and then went baseline, where he rose up for a two-fisted dunk
and screamed, having left McGrady at the three-point arc.</TE>
<TE>   "Kinda fun to watch," Magic Coach Doc Rivers said.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant said he did not play for offensive vengeance. Other than
the dunk.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt that was totally necessary," he said. "He made a nice
move, I slipped, the homeboys don't care if you slip or not. So, I
had to go down there and retaliate."</TE>
<TE>   In all, Bryant took 31 shots and made 14. McGrady was 12 for 28.
O'Neal, defended by the likes of Shawn Kemp, Andrew DeClercq and Pat
Burke, took 20 shots and made 11.</TE>
<TE>   "Tracy is one of the top two players in the league," O'Neal said.
"Him and Kobe.... They are the two best. No one is even close. The
rest are in the clouds."</TE>
<TE>   Said Brian Shaw: "It doesn't have anything to do with Kobe or
Shaq. It's the rest of us."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes it has to be about the theater, Bryant's heart in the
right place if not his head.</TE>
<TE>   Afraid Bryant had gone too far, Jackson sat him for two minutes
late in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   None of it really worked. The Lakers never led. O'Neal fatigued.
And while Bryant blasted them, Rick Fox made six of eight field-goal
attempts, Derek Fisher was four for eight and Shaw was three for six.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just trying to keep us in the ballgame," Bryant said.</TE>

<LD>Winston Cup champion Tony Stewart will be at Irwindale Speedway
tonight, for the Lucas Oil Turkey Night race, but most NASCAR drivers
are taking the holiday off.</LD>
<LD>   Elliott Sadler will be in the woods.</LD>
<LD>   "When I'm not driving a race car, my favorite thing to do is to
deer hunt," Sadler said. "I will spend almost every day from November
to January hunting. I don't even come out of the woods for
Thanksgiving."</LD>
<TE>   Sadler said he'd probably eat dinner with his family when he was
finished hunting. Hope they like venison.</TE>
<TE>   Lions Day: One person who doesn't have today off is CBS
commentator Phil Simms, who along with Greg Gumbel will be announcing
this morning's game between the New England Patriots and Detroit
Lions at Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Simms isn't complaining.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always fun working the Thanksgiving Day games," he said.
"It's such a family tradition. Everywhere we go in Detroit, we hear
people talking about it.</TE>
<TE>   "Our sideline guy, Armen Keteyian, grew up in the Detroit area and
it's great to hear him tell stories about going to the games with his
father, family and friends. Even for an outsider like myself, you
feel it when you're there."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: What was significant about the USC-UCLA game played
at the Coliseum in 1938?</TE>
<TE>   Hits and misses: Atlanta Falcon cornerback Ray Buchanan, a guest
on Fox Sports Net's "Best Damn Sports Show Period," had this to say
about the fines being levied against NFL players for hard hits:</TE>
<TE>   "I am tired of all these fines that they are putting on brothers.
Pretty soon offensive players will be wearing pumps, skirts and
lipstick."</TE>
<TE>   Well-fed: Buchanan on Falcon owner Arthur Blank: "One thing he did
on Friday was feed the boys lobster and steak, and he was the guy
serving us. What owner have you heard of do something like that? Now
we are going to continue to win for this man because if we continue
having lobster on Fridays, everyone will go out there and bust their
butt."</TE>
<TE>   The truth, period: Tom Arnold, interviewed by Newsweek, was asked
how Fox Sports Net came up with the name "Best Damn Sports Show
Period."</TE>
<TE>   "They had this whole list of titles and decided to go with the
worst one possible."</TE>
<TE>   Bright side: Asked if it bothered him that he'd always been known
as Roseanne's former husband, Arnold said, "Yeah, but it's sure
better than being known as her current husband."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: It was the last time USC played on Thanksgiving
Day. The Trojans won, 42-7.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Bob Ryan of the Boston Globe makes this point about
Shaquille O'Neal, whom he calls "the greatest force in the known
basketball world:"</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure Shaq is thinking that he is quite good enough as he is,
so what benefit would he gain by taking the time and putting in the
effort to be the very best he could be?</TE>
<TE>   "Would it be naive to suggest Shaq should have sufficient pride to
find out what would happen if he truly gave it his all for an entire
season?</TE>
<TE>   "Start with this: Do you know how many rebounding titles Shaq has
won during his first 10 years in the league? NONE! That is shameful."</TE>

<LD>   Loyola Marymount (2-0) vs. Villanova (1-1) at Alaska Anchorage,
6:30 p.m., KXLU-FM (88.9)--Both teams have relied on touted
recruiting classes entering this first-round game in the Great Alaska
Shootout. Loyola received contributions from five freshmen, most
notably guards Brandon Worthy and Wes Wardrop, in victories over
Loyola Chicago and Sacramento State. Villanova's leading scorers are
freshmen guards Allan Ray and Randy Foye, averaging 15.5 and 14.5
points, respectively. The Wildcats defeated Drexel after losing their
opener to No. 13 Marquette.</LD>

<LD>Coach Alvin Gentry watched a videotape of the Clippers' 99-94 loss
Tuesday to the Utah Jazz four times before the team re-grouped
Wednesday morning for its practice at Los Angeles Southwest College.</LD>
<LD>   What stood out, troubling Gentry most, was the Clippers' inability
to make shots during crunch time. They missed point-blank shots and
free throws while getting outscored, 15-4, in the final 3 1/2
minutes.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not like we're losing by 25 points or playing bad ball
except for the Portland and Orlando games," he said, referring to
20-point-plus losses. "We just haven't made plays down the stretch.
We're getting good shots. We're getting to the foul line."</LD>
<TE>   Gentry rejected the notion that the Clippers lack a go-to player
capable of leading the team to victory. He also said the team is not
in the throes of an identity crisis because of injuries to Lamar Odom
and Corey Maggette.</TE>
<TE>   "I think when you're out there at the end of the game, if you've
got the ball, you're the go-to guy," Gentry said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gentry offered this advice to Andre Miller, whistled twice late in
the last two games for stepping over the free-throw line on his
attempts: stand still.</TE>
<TE>   "I said to Andre, 'If they're going to call it, you're going to
have to adjust,' " said Gentry, who couldn't resist a critical
comment about the timing of such calls. "He doesn't shoot them any
different in the first quarter than he does in the fourth quarter.
It's strange to me that the violation comes at the end of the game."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Backup forwards Melvin Ely and Cherokee Parks might play for the
first time this season tonight against the New Jersey Nets. Ely has
had a sprained left foot. Parks simply hasn't played.</TE>

<LD>Don't worry about North Carolina getting carried away by Wednesday
night's 67-56 victory over No. 2 Kansas in the semifinals of the
Preseason National Invitation Tournament at New York.</LD>
<LD>   Where do the Tar Heels go from here, freshman sharpshooter Rashad
McCants was asked.</LD>
<LD>   "We've got practice tomorrow," McCants said.</LD>
<TE>   North Carolina (4-0) is halfway to last season's total of eight
victories. Coach Matt Doherty survived that nightmare season and
imported a roster of freshmen who seem determined to turn things
around.</TE>
<TE>   McCants sent that message, shooting 10 for 15 from the field and
scoring 25 points.</TE>
<TE>   The loss ended a win streak at 14 in the Preseason NIT for Kansas
(2-1).</TE>
<TE>   Stanford 69, No. 7 Florida 65 -- Stanford's Matt Lottich made two
three-point baskets down the stretch and Rob Little added 14 points
to help lift the Cardinal (4-0) past the Gators in a Preseason NIT
semifinal. Matt Bonner had 19 points for the Gators (3-1).</TE>
<TE>   No. 19 Indiana 70, Virginia 63 -- Bracey Wright scored 21 points
and fellow freshman guard Marshall Strickland added 15 to lift the
Hoosiers (3-0) to the championship of the Maui Invitational at
Lahaina, Hawaii. Travis Watson had 14 points and 11 rebounds for the
Cavaliers (3-1).</TE>
<TE>   In other Maui Invitational games:</TE>
<TE>   No. 15 Kentucky 80, No. 20 Gonzaga 72 -- Keith Bogans scored 18
points and the Wildcats (2-1) held off a comeback by the Bulldogs in
the third-place game. Blake Stepp had 24 points for Gonzaga (2-2).</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State 83, Utah 79 -- Curtis Millage scored 26 points in
his season debut as the Sun Devils (3-1) held off the Utes (2-2) in
overtime in the fifth-place game. Nick Jacobson had 22 points for
Utah (2-2). Millage missed the first three games while questions
about his academic eligibility were cleared up with the NCAA.</TE>
<TE>   Massachusetts 69, Chaminade 55 -- Anthony Anderson had 20 points
and nine assists to lead the Minutemen (1-2) in the seventh-place
game. It was the 30th consecutive loss for the Silverswords (0-4) in
the tournament they have played host to since 1984.</TE>
<TE>   In other games:</TE>
<TE>   No. 1 Arizona 101, Northern Arizona 66 -- Luke Walton sprained his
right ankle in the first half, but the Wildcats (2-0) won easily at
Tucson as Jason Gardner scored 24 points. The Lumberjacks (1-2)
trailed by only 44-39 at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   No. 3 Texas 76, Texas Arlington 45 -- James Thomas had 14 points
and 15 rebounds as the Longhorns (3-0) crushed the Mavericks (1-3) at
Austin, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   No. 5 Pittsburgh 69, St. Francis, Pa. 46 -- Brandin Knight had 10
points, nine assists and eight rebounds as the Panthers (2-0) cruised
past the Red Flash at Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   No. 11 Maryland 97, Citadel 49 -- Drew Nicholas scored 17 of his
career-high 28 points in the first half as the Terrapins (2-0)
cruised past the Bulldogs (1-2) at College Park, Md.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia Tech 83, No. 17 Georgia 77 -- Sophomore guard B.J. Elder
scored 24 points to lift the Yellow Jackets (2-0) past their rivals
at Atlanta. Jarvis Hayes had 20 points for the Bulldogs (1-2).</TE>

<LD>   What: "I Remember Tom Landry"</LD>
<TE>   Authors: Denne H. Freeman and Jaime Aron</TE>
<TE>   Publisher: Sports Publishing L.L.C.</TE>
<TE>   Price: $17.95</TE>
<TE>   When owner Clint Murchison Jr. awarded Tom Landry a 10-year
contract extension in 1963, in the wake of four miserable losing
seasons -- the first four of the Dallas Cowboys' existence -- it was
one of the biggest acts of faith ever in sports. And it was rewarded
almost immediately.</TE>
<TE>   After two NFL championship-game losses over the next four years to
Green Bay in 1966 and '67, the Cowboys went on to play in five Super
Bowls from 1970-78, winning two -- over Miami in 1971 and Denver in
'78 -- and losing the three others by a total of 11 points.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of Murchison's gutsy move, Landry, a World War II
bomber pilot and former University of Texas halfback and intramural
boxing champion, had a combined record of 18-46-4.</TE>
<TE>   "Tom was the kind of person that never gave up," says Roger
Staubach, who wrote the foreword to "I Remember Tom Landry," a
266-page paperback book by Texas sportswriters Denne H. Freeman and
Jaime Aron. "He was our rock, our hope, our inspiration."</TE>
<TE>   Even at the twilight of his 29-year career in Dallas, when he was
on the verge of being fired by new team owner Jerry Jones, Landry,
who died of leukemia in February 2000 at 75, made a major impact on
the future of "America's Team."</TE>
<TE>   "I Remember Tom Landry" comprises stirring anecdotes and
testimonies from those close to "the Man in the Hat." The memories
come from his family, former players, assistant coaches, opposing
coaches, media members, and other Cowboy personnel from 1960-88.</TE>

<HD>Pressed, so Ducks Fold</HD>
<DH>They blow two-goal lead in the final two minutes of
regulation and settle for a 2-2 tie with the Coyotes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There seems to be nothing as precarious as a two-goal lead by the
Mighty Ducks.</LD>
<LD>   There is certainly nothing more frustrating and, possibly so
damaging, as the rerun of events that played at the Arrowhead Pond
recently.</LD>
<LD>   The Ducks had a victory picked from their back pocket for the
second time in as many games. The Phoenix Coyotes scored two goals in
the final two minutes of regulation to salvage a 2-2 tie in front of
an announced 11,386 Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   Brian Savage knocked in a goal at 18 minutes 27 seconds. Daniel
Briere then finished off a two-on-one rush, whipping a shot past
goalie Martin Gerber with 45 seconds to go.</TE>
<TE>   This was the second time in as many games that the Ducks lost a
victory in the closing seconds. It was the fourth time this season
that they have wasted a two-goal lead in the third period.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're up two with under five minutes left, that's game
over," said team captain Paul Kariya, who nearly won the game in
overtime with two blistering shots on one play.</TE>
<TE>   A recent amendment seems to exclude the Ducks from that rule of
thumb.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, they let a 4-2 lead slip away in a 4-4 tie with
Florida. On Wednesday, the outcome was the same, the scenario a
little more painful.</TE>
<TE>   Celebrating a gritty victory was close at hand. Adam Oates
returned to the lineup and assisted on the Ducks' first goal. Pavel
Trnka gave the Ducks the lead 7:34 into the third period. Kariya's
power-play goal at 12:15 seemed to seal it. Gerber was having a solid
night in his first start since Oct. 28.</TE>
<TE>   But the Ducks were skating on thin ice and knew it as soon as
Savage chipped his shot at the net. Defenseman Keith Carney had
fallen on the play. The puck then went off Duck defenseman Kurt Sauer
and into the net.</TE>
<TE>   "Keith Carney doesn't fall down very often," Coach Mike Babcock
said. "You can tell by the panic level by our team as soon as they
got one goal, that we haven't done enough winning."</TE>
<TE>   Events overtook the Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   Andy McDonald raced up ice to prevent an icing call with less than
a minute left. Too many of his teammates had an up-close view of that
effort, having drifted too far up ice.</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, Landon Wilson and Briere had a two-on-one rush.
Wilson passed to Briere, who redirected the puck for a goal.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks cried foul.</TE>
<TE>   "The [play on] their tying goal was offside by two feet," Babcock
said. "When you watch that on video that frustrates the living hell
out of you. A goal being offside, that's unacceptable that can happen
at this level."</TE>
<TE>   There was a bigger issue.</TE>
<TE>   "How do you get a two-on-one?" Kariya said. "That's bad hockey. We
outplayed them."</TE>
<TE>   Oates, who had missed 15 games with a broken left hand, was a big
part of that effort. He got back to doing what he does best, setting
up goals. This assist -- No. 1,031 of his career -- wasn't one for
the scrapbook, but it was significant.</TE>
<TE>   Oates took a pass from Matt Cullen, then nudged the puck out to
Trnka at the blue line. Trnka whipped a wrist shot that went off
Phoenix's Deron Quint and slid under Brian Boucher's pads.</TE>
<TE>   Kariya than scored off a pass from Steve Rucchin and all seemed
well ... including Oates' hand.</TE>
<TE>   "The hand felt fine," Oates said. "I'm pretty pumped about it
actually."</TE>

<LD>Kevin Sawyer wandered up the high road Wednesday, offering little
response to the challenge laid down by Phoenix's Darcy Hordichuk.</LD>
<LD>   Hordichuk, fresh off a 10-game suspension, played the pre-game
goon Monday, saying that he had watched video of Sawyer's "memorable
fights" with his boxing instructor.</LD>
<LD>   Sawyer, however, refused to rise to the bait.</LD>
<TE>   "I will prepare for the game the same way I always do," Sawyer
said after the morning skate. "The guys who do this role around the
league respect each other because we know how hard it is. All I will
do is be professional, play the way I always do and be ready for
anything."</TE>
<TE>   The first shift Hordichuk and Sawyer shared Wednesday, Hordichuk
got in a good check.</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, he skated at Sawyer, then fell to the ice.
Hordichuk was given a minor penalty for diving.</TE>
<TE>   Sawyer is third in the NHL with 85 penalty minutes, behind
Buffalo's Eric Boulton (100) and Minnesota's Matt Johnson (90).</TE>

<TE>   Duck defenseman Ruslan Salei left Wednesday's game after the
second period because of back spasms and a bruised left elbow....

<LD>USC and Notre Dame coaches won't total 50 hours of sleep this week as
they prepare for Saturday's big game at the Coliseum.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, in Iowa City, Iowa, Coach Kirk Ferentz may not get out
of his pajamas until after the Saturday morning cartoons. That'll be
him in his driveway, stifling a yawn as he picks up the morning
paper.</LD>
<LD>   While Florida and Florida State go knuckles down this weekend, and
Nebraska seeks revenge against Colorado, and No. 1 Miami plays at
Syracuse, Iowa will be doing ...</LD>
<TE>   "Absolutely nothing," Ferentz said this week, being kind enough to
set aside his crossword puzzle and take a phone call.</TE>
<TE>   Only in college football can a team wrap up the regular season on
Nov. 16 and have to wait a minimum of 46 days to play its next game.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine, in the NFL, playing the conference title games on Jan. 28
and then holding the Super Bowl in mid-March.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa, which clinched a share of the Big Ten title almost two weeks
ago, doesn't know for certain where it's playing its next game,
although it's almost a cinch to be in the Rose Bowl, or what team
it's going to face, likely Washington State or USC.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa's fate will be decided by other teams on television while its
players are fighting over the remote control and eating spongecake.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa is like the golfer who posts a low score in the morning and
has to wait around in the clubhouse to see if it holds up.</TE>
<TE>   Ferentz, who in four seasons has taken Iowa from 1-10 to 11-1,
hasn't even tried to keep his players focused on the next game. Six
weeks from now is a light year for a 20-year-old kid.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, get this, he gave his team two weeks off and told them to
do exactly what players are not supposed to do: rest on their
laurels.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Let everyone tell you what a great job you've done,' " Ferentz
told his guys. " 'When you go home for Thanksgiving, let everyone pat
you on the back.' They should. Because our guys have really deserved
it. To go from 0-8 in the league to 8-0 in a matter of four years,
that's something to be very, very proud of. Then, I'll be all over
their butts when they get back here in December."</TE>
<TE>   Iowa played 12 consecutive weeks without a bye and finished its
season while some teams still had three regular-season games
remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa could be in limbo until Dec. 8, the day bowl bids become
official. The Hawkeyes are likely Rose Bowl bound, but there's still
a remote chance they could end up in the Fiesta or get bounced out of
a bowl championship series game.</TE>
<TE>   It's tough to say how dormancy affects the Hawkeye cause. Brad
Banks, the team's brilliant quarterback, can't hurt himself in the
Heisman Trophy race, but he can't help himself either.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to Washington State's loss last Saturday, and other
mathematical blips, Iowa hopped two spots, from No. 7 to No. 5, in
this week's BCS standings.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine that, cracking the top 5 while you're getting a start on
Christmas cards.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, the USC-Notre Dame winner this weekend is likely going to
take Iowa's No. 5 spot in the BCS. The real danger in too much
goof-off time is having to hold another orientation when players
return to campus.</TE>
<TE>   Excuse me, the name escapes me, but weren't you our left
cornerback?</TE>
<TE>   Florida State discovered in 1998 what it's like to go stale. The
Seminoles wrapped up the regular season on Nov. 21 against Florida. A
few weeks later, Coach Bobby Bowden awoke from a Dec. 5 catnap to
discover all heaven had broken loose and Florida State was going to
play Tennessee for the national title.</TE>
<TE>   Seminole players entered the Fiesta Bowl like bears just out of
hibernation and suffered an error-filled title-game loss.</TE>
<TE>   Ferentz says he isn't worried.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm totally confident our guys will get back into it," he said.
"I'm not worried about who we're playing either, or any of that
stuff. We'll have plenty of time come December as far as looking at
an opponent."</TE>
<TE>   Iowa could probably start breaking down film of Washington State
or USC, but Ferentz isn't interested in viewing rough cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "All that would do is screw up our game plan, if we got a jump
that early," he said. "For sure, we'd botch it."</TE>
<TE>   With so much time to kill, Ferentz this week did something coaches
almost never do from August to the bowl games.</TE>
<TE>   "I went out to dinner with my family last night, all the stuff
that normal people do," he said. "It's great. I'm trying to figure
out what I'm going to do this week to justify my existence around
here."</TE>
<TE>   Hey, anyone up for a game of dominos?</TE>
<TE>   Making Plans</TE>
<TE>   Pacific 10 officials were in Iowa City this week paving the way
for Iowa's probable trip to the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   There are only two scenarios in which Iowa does not get to
Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   One is a terrific alternative; the other stinks.</TE>
<TE>   It is remotely possible that Iowa could play for the national
title against Ohio State in the Jan. 3 Fiesta Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   This would require Miami, Oklahoma and Georgia losing and Iowa
jumping to the No. 2 spot in the BCS standings.</TE>
<TE>   You say nothing that crazy could ever happen -- except it happened
last year.</TE>
<TE>   After getting crushed by Colorado in Boulder the day after
Thanksgiving, Nebraska fell to No. 6 in the BCS, but ended up in the
national title game because of a stunning sequence of "overs:"</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma State over Oklahoma, Tennessee over Florida, Louisiana
State over Tennessee in the Southeastern Conference championship game
and Colorado over Texas in the Big 12.</TE>
<TE>   The second way Iowa gets knocked out of the Rose Bowl is pure bowl
politics.</TE>
<TE>   It could happen if the Orange Bowl takes Notre Dame even if the
Irish lose to USC.</TE>
<TE>   Let's say Washington State beats UCLA to win the Rose Bowl bid and
USC clinches an automatic BCS berth by finishing No. 4 in the final
standings.</TE>
<TE>   If Miami finishes No. 1 in the BCS, the Orange Bowl would get the
first at-large pick.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa loses if the Orange Bowl takes Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   If the Orange Bowl takes Iowa, the Rose Bowl loses out on both Big
Ten champions, Ohio State and Iowa, which isn't what Pasadena had in
mind when it agreed to join this alliance.</TE>
<TE>   So what should Iowa fans be rooting for?</TE>
<TE>   A Notre Dame win over USC clinches the BCS at-large spot for the
Irish while it knocks USC out of BCS contention, meaning the Orange
Bowl can take Notre Dame and the Rose Bowl can pick Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   If USC beats Notre Dame, Iowa must hope the Trojans win so
convincingly that the Irish drop out of the BCS top 12, which would
make them ineligible for a major bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "Quite frankly, I'm trying to figure out what the hell this BCS
means," Ferentz said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our athletic director had me totally confused this morning."</TE>
<TE>   Welcome to the club.</TE>
<TE>   Riot Acts</TE>
<TE>   The time-honored tradition of fans storming the field after
victories has degenerated from a genuine form of expression to a
gratuitous excuse to wreak disorder.</TE>
<TE>   Let's establish some ground rules. It is OK to rush the field if:</TE>
<TE>   You haven't defeated Notre Dame since the 1960s. Thus, the day
Navy pulls it off, we'll cut the Midshipmen some slack.</TE>
<TE>   It was terrific when Kansas State fans rushed the field in 1998
after defeating Nebraska for the first time in 30 years, not terrific
last weekend when three-loss North Carolina State defeated four-loss
Florida State.</TE>
<TE>   You know how long it had been since North Carolina State beat
Florida State?</TE>
<TE>   Twelve months.</TE>
<TE>   You could almost understand why Buckeye fans went nuts after
Saturday's win over Michigan. Those were real, pent-up emotions, a
dam-break for a football town that hasn't celebrated a national title
since 1968.</TE>
<TE>   But storming the field just isn't enough anymore, and the mayhem
in Columbus that night led to overturned cars and more than 50
arrests.</TE>
<TE>   After the game, someone asked Coach Jim Tressel whether he could
issue a plea for calm.</TE>
<TE>   "Is this a PSA [public service announcement]?" Tressel quipped.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone laughed, but what happened was no joke.</TE>
<TE>   Hurry Up Offense</TE>
<TE>   The hair-trigger dismissal of Florida State quarterback Adrian
McPherson set off our "Whoa Nellie" alarm. This is the same coach who
has, historically, given troubled players several benefits of doubt.
"If I had a player commit murder," Bowden once said, "well, now, I
would just have to let him go."</TE>
<TE>   Anything short of that, however.... Remember Bowden's 1999 defense
of receiver Peter Warrick, who received that great five-finger
discount at Dillard's? Bowden wondered how come he couldn't get that
kind of deal.</TE>
<TE>   You'd hate to think the difference between Warrick and now is that
Florida State was in a national title race then but is 8-4 now.
McPherson was arrested Wednesday on charges of stealing a blank check
and receiving nearly $3,500 after it was cashed.</TE>
<TE>   BCS matters: No. 3 Oklahoma cut No. 2 Ohio State's lead to 4.88
points in this week's standings. Ohio State's lead over Oklahoma last
week was 7.05. Remember, Oklahoma has no mathematical chance of
overtaking Ohio State for the No. 2 spot -- at least that's what
we've been told.</TE>
<TE>   This week marks the unhappy anniversary of Nebraska's demise. The
Cornhuskers are 7-7, with no victory over a ranked opponent since
last year's 62-36 loss at Colorado.Things are so bad in Lincoln the
Cornhuskers may not place a player on the Big 12 all-conference team.
With a 7-5 record and two games remaining -- this weekend's grudge
match against Colorado and a bowl game -- Nebraska's string of 40
consecutive winning seasons is also in jeopardy.</TE>
<TE>   This week's note from the how-bad-is-Rutgers file: In two trips to
Notre Dame, in 1996 and last weekend, the Scarlet Knights have been
outscored, 110-0.</TE>
<TE>   What a drag: Notre Dame had the nation's No. 5 schedule strength
two weeks ago before playing Navy and Rutgers. Victories against the
two schools dropped the Irish to No. 29.</TE>

<LD>Former Florida State quarterback Adrian McPherson was arrested
Wednesday on charges of stealing a blank check and receiving nearly
$3,500 after it was cashed.</LD>
<LD>   McPherson, kicked off the team Monday by Coach Bobby Bowden,
surrendered to police and was later released after posting bail.</LD>
<LD>   The sophomore, who started the last four games for the Seminoles,
was charged with misdemeanor theft for stealing a blank check from

<HD>Kings Left Short-Changed</HD>
<DH>Yushkevich's inability to play is the first of several
problems L.A. faces in 5-2 loss to Florida.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Kings believed they were plugging a hole in their defense Tuesday
when they traded for Dmitry Yushkevich of the Florida Panthers.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, they created one.</LD>
<LD>   Less than an hour before Wednesday night's game against the
Panthers, the veteran defenseman was found to have a ruptured blood
vessel in his right eye and told he couldn't play, leaving the Kings
a man short.</LD>
<TE>   They came up short on the scoreboard too, the Panthers ending an
eight-game winless streak with a 5-2 victory in front of 16,782 at
Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Adding insult to injury: Jaroslav Bednar, traded from the Kings
along with defenseman Andreas Lilja, assisted on two Panther goals.</TE>
<TE>   Almost nothing went right for the Kings, who already were without
injured regulars Jason Allison, Adam Deadmarsh, Ian Laperriere and
Lubomir Visnovsky before learning that Yushkevich would be sidelined
too.</TE>
<TE>   They scored first ... but then gave up four consecutive goals.</TE>
<TE>   "We played a bad game," defenseman Aaron Miller said. "One guy
short doesn't mean we should fall apart like that, so no one's happy
with our effort."</TE>
<TE>   The Panthers hadn't won since Nov. 9, a 3-0 victory over the
Calgary Flames, but they'd picked up seven points during their
0-1-5-2 slide. Nine of their previous 11 games had gone into
overtime, including their last four.</TE>
<TE>   "Unbelievable," King Coach Andy Murray said before the game. "That
shows that they're not going to go away and they're a young, brash,
hard-working team that hangs in there and finds a way to get points."</TE>
<TE>   The Panthers got younger when they traded Yushkevich, 31, for
Lilja, 27, and Bednar, 26, both of whom figure to play more with
their new team.</TE>
<TE>   Bednar scored four goals in 37 games with the Kings, none in 15
this season, but Murray said before the game that he could be a
30-goal scorer.</TE>
<TE>   "We've really got to watch him," he said. "He can light it up on
any given night and he'd like nothing better than to get three or
four goals against us."</TE>
<TE>   Lilja, meanwhile, would have liked to make it through the game
without spending time in the penalty box. But that's where he was,
sent off for holding Michael Cammalleri, when the Kings opened the
scoring with a power-play goal.</TE>
<TE>   Mathieu Schneider's blast from the blue line gave the Kings a 1-0
lead 4 minutes 11 seconds into the second period.</TE>
<TE>   But the Panthers pulled even 31 seconds later, Ivan Novoseltsev
scoring from the right faceoff circle after goaltender Felix Potvin
had stopped a shot by Ryan Johnson. With Potvin on his side,
Novoseltsev lifted the puck into the net.</TE>
<TE>   At 15:51 of the second period, Bednar notched his 10th assist of
the season and first for his new team, poking the puck from behind
the net to Kristian Huselius, who rifled a shot from the left faceoff
that gave the Panthers a 2-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   This after the Panthers were outshot, 10-3, in the first period.</TE>
<TE>   "Personally, I don't think we showed Florida enough respect in the
second period," King defenseman Mattias Norstrom said. The Panthers
padded their lead with a power-play goal at 4:38 of the third period,
Brad Chartrand in the penalty box for hooking Niklas Hagman.</TE>
<TE>   Attempting to clear puck out of the King zone, Mikko Eloranta sent
it around the end boards from the left corner. It went straight to
the stick of defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh, who made the score 3-1 with
a shot from the right point.</TE>
<TE>   Bednar fed Marcus Nilson at 11:01, leading to a shot from the
right circle that increased the Panthers' lead to 4-1.</TE>

<LD>The Kings' push to speed up the announcement of Tuesday's trade with
the Florida Panthers backfired Wednesday night when Dmitry
Yushkevich, the player they acquired in the deal, was unable to play
against his former teammates.</LD>
<LD>   The Russian defenseman was held out of the lineup after doctors
discovered a ruptured blood vessel in his right eye, leaving the
Kings a player short. Because of injuries, they dressed 17 skaters,
one fewer than NHL rules allow.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, defenseman Andreas Lilja and winger Jarolav Bednar,
jettisoned by the Kings a day earlier, were in the lineup for the
Panthers.</LD>
<TE>   Originally, King Coach Andy Murray said, the clubs agreed to
announce the deal during Wednesday night's game, holding the traded
players out so they wouldn't have to face their former teams.</TE>
<TE>   But when King defenseman Lubomir Visnovsky suffered back spasms
during Tuesday's practice, a recurring injury that sidelined him
against the Panthers, the Kings decided they needed Yushkevich right
away.</TE>
<TE>   In a pregame physical, however, doctors discovered Yushkevich's
injury, suffered Friday in the second period of a 3-3 tie with the
Phoenix Coyotes when a slap shot struck his face, breaking his nose
and opening a cut on his nose that required about 35 stitches to
close. He returned in the third period against the Coyotes, and he
played nearly 20 minutes Sunday in a 4-4 tie with the Mighty Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   Yushkevich said he hopes to play as soon as Friday against the
Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ian Laperriere, suffering from a possible concussion after a
Saturday night collision with Derian Hatcher of the Dallas Stars, sat
out because of injury for the first time since the 2000-01 season.</TE>
<TE>   Laperriere sat out one game last season to attend the birth of his
son.</TE>

<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Kobe Bryant said he's hurt too.</LD>
<LD>   His ankle. His shin.</LD>
<LD>   But he's not on the injured list and he's playing 46 minutes a
night while the first month of the Laker season burns.</LD>
<TE>   Nearly an hour after the Lakers lost, 112-102, to the Orlando
Magic, he continued to gasp for breath, so near was he to anger.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to Mike Tyson any of you guys," he said, almost
playful. "You know, I love the game so much. You guys can see that
when I'm out there. I play extremely hard every single minute.</TE>
<TE>   "I expect my teammates to play the same way. When they don't, it's
frustrating. I play every minute like it's my last. Especially guys
coming off the bench. They have to play that way. You only get one
shot."</TE>
<TE>   Two key players -- Samaki Walker and Devean George  -- are injured
and inactive.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to get guys healthy," he said. "I understand Samaki has
some back problems and he's hurting, but he's not hurting any more
than I am. I'm out there playing my butt off every single night.
Hurt. Bad ankle. Can't walk. Don't matter. I'm out there playing.
They should be out there playing as well. Devean George, he'll be
back shortly. We have to get our core guys out there playing
basketball right now."</TE>
<TE>   Also, Bryant had a problem Wednesday with the Laker reserves.</TE>
<TE>   "Guys are coming off the bench, their heads are not in the game,"
he said. "That can be much better."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal is off the injured list and dominating games in
very short periods, but the process of rebuilding his game on
surgically repaired feet will take time, Coach Phil Jackson said
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, O'Neal is adjusting to new orthotics not yet a
week old.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaq's not feeling as well as I'd like him to be feeling,"
Jackson said. "There's a few things that are going on that he's still
adjusting to, but he's doing, you know, he's getting the job done."</TE>
<TE>   In his first four games back, O'Neal, suffering from mild
tendinitis in his knees, had his minutes increased from 21 to 28 to
32 to 36 Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Asked when he expected Shaq to be Shaq again, Jackson smiled and
said, "Well, it was the seventh game of the playoffs last year before
he started. ... But, no, I think the activity level is so important.
Mark Madsen's back, that helps. It gives Shaq somebody to chase
things down out there. Robert [Horry], Rick [Fox] and Shaq in the
lineup together, we need a hound dog out here chasing loose balls
around."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Laker traveling party planned to bus today to O'Neal's mansion
at Isleworth, the exclusive Orlando community whose other rich folk
include Tiger Woods and Ken Griffey Jr., where O'Neal's chef will
serve Thanksgiving dinner.</TE>
<TE>   The kind of food made no difference to Madsen.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want there to be a lot," he said. "I know that won't be a
problem at Shaq's."</TE>

<HD>Finley's Shooting Puts Dallas at 14-0</HD>
<DH>He has career-high 42 points and Mavericks beat Detroit,
102-82, to pull within one victory of tying an NBA record.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>AUBURN HILLS, Mich.</DL>
<LD>Michael Finley couldn't be stopped by the league's best defensive
team, leading the Dallas Mavericks within one victory of matching the
best start in NBA history.</LD>
<LD>   Finley was at his best Wednesday night, scoring a career-high 42
points before leaving with more than eight minutes left and the
Mavericks on their way to a 102-82 victory over the Detroit Pistons.</LD>
<LD>   With a 14-0 record, the Mavericks will be looking to match the
best start in NBA history -- 15-0 by Washington in 1948-49 and
Houston in 1993-94 -- when they play tonight at Indiana.</LD>
<TE>   "We'll have our hands full in Indiana," Coach Don Nelson said. "If
we get beat, it's no big deal."</TE>
<TE>   The big deal against Detroit was the way Finley scored almost at
will.</TE>
<TE>   Finley was 13 for 28 from the field and 15 for 17 from the
free-throw line. He had 10 rebounds, two assists and two steals as
the Mavericks steamrolled the Pistons for the second time this month.</TE>
<TE>   After leading by as many as 52 points in a 114-75 victory over
Detroit on Nov. 9, the Mavericks turned this one into a laugher
during the third quarter. The Mavericks ran three consecutive
isolation plays for Finley in the fourth quarter so he could try to
surpass his previous career high of 39 points.</TE>
<TE>   Finley reached 40 on a fadeaway from the corner over Corliss
Williamson with 10:05 to play. When Dallas ran the same play and
Finley faked Williamson off his feet, Williamson flagrantly fouled
Finley, bruising Finley's shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Finley made both free throws to reach 42 points, and Williamson
got a huge ovation on Dallas' next possession when he finally was
able to keep Finley from scoring on the same play.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's taking some time, but Kevin Garnett believes the Minnesota
Timberwolves are starting to develop a killer instinct.</LD>
<LD>   Garnett had 20 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists for his second
triple-double this season , and the Timberwolves ended the Sacramento
Kings' winning streak at six with a 90-74 victory Wednesday night at
Minneapolis.</LD>
<LD>   "We have a younger team," Garnett said. "A lot of the guys don't
have the cutthroat, the step-on-the-throat attitude yet. But we're
getting there."</LD>
<TE>   Chris Webber had 19 points and 11 rebounds for Sacramento, which
has lost nine of its last 10 at Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, already depleted by injuries to Mike Bibby and Peja
Stojakovic, might have lost Hedo Turkoglu for up to two weeks because
of a sprained right wrist.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like we get more short-handed every time we turn
around," Coach Rick Adelman said.</TE>
<TE>   Memphis 117, Seattle 99 -- Jason Williams scored a season-high 28
points and the host Grizzlies won their second in a row.</TE>
<TE>   The Grizzlies, who started the season 0-13, shot 59.3% from the
field and had six players score in double figures, including rookie
Drew Gooden, who had 23 points.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 112, Cleveland 80 -- Sam Cassell scored 30 points at
Milwaukee and the Bucks sent the Cavaliers to their 12th consecutive
loss.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Redd had a season-high 25 points for the Bucks, who played
without starters Ray Allen (sprained right ankle) and Anthony Mason
(strained left hamstring).</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 99, Denver 68 -- Stephen Jackson scored 22 points to
lead the Spurs at San Antonio, where the Nuggets set an NBA record by
scoring only three points in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Nuggets missed 14 consecutive shots after taking a 2-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The three points broke the previous first-quarter record of four
by Sacramento against the Lakers on Feb. 4, 1987.</TE>
<TE>   The Nuggets tied the mark for the second-lowest quarter in NBA
history since the shot clock was introduced for the 1954-55 season.</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans 106, Atlanta 94 -- Baron Davis had 16 points and 11
assists, and the Hornets improved to 9-0 at home.</TE>
<TE>   The Hawks have given up 100-plus points in five consecutive games,
four of them losses.</TE>
<TE>   New York 87, Toronto 81 -- Allan Houston scored 30 points and the
Knicks won their first road game and spoiled Vince Carter's return to
the Raptor lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Carter scored 16 points in his first game after sitting out 10
because of a strained quadriceps.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 83, Miami 74 -- Allen Iverson scored 13 of his 36
points in the fourth quarter, making the 76ers 9-0 at home and
leading them to their fifth consecutive victory.</TE>

Battie had 16 points and nine rebounds to help the host Celtics win

during the winning streak by averaging 29 points and 11 rebounds in
that stretch. The Celtics have won 10 of 12.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 82, New Jersey 75 -- Shawn Marion had 22 points and 10
rebounds to lift the Suns at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets made only three field goals in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Kidd, a former Sun, was booed throughout the first half. He

<HD>UCLA Sends LMU Packing Once Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lauren Peterson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The UCLA men's soccer team did everything but actually tell Loyola
Marymount to, "Take this." And take that, and that, and that.</LD>
<LD>   But the third-seeded Bruins defeated the Lions, 4-2, in an NCAA
tournament second-round game Wednesday night at Drake Stadium that
spoke volumes about their intentions. The more experienced Bruins
(14-3-3), making their 20th consecutive NCAA tournament appearance,
matched Loyola's physical play and took the fight out of the Lions
each time they attempted a comeback.</LD>
<LD>   The victory also avenged a regular-season nonconference loss the
Bruins suffered Sept. 22, when Loyola (15-4-2) handed UCLA a 2-0
loss, the Bruins' first after they began the season 4-0-1, and it
sent UCLA on to the third round of the NCAA tournament, where it will
play host to California at 7 p.m. Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   "I was just really excited to go out," said junior midfielder
Adolfo Gregorio, who had two goals and an assist for UCLA. "We wanted
to go out and prove that game was just that game. I think we took the
game to them this time. Tonight we were on our game, whereas last
time, I think we were a step slow."</TE>
<TE>   Loyola, making its second appearance in the NCAA tournament,
earned its first postseason victory last weekend with a 1-0 shutout
of Cal State Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA also knocked Loyola out of the NCAA tournament in the first
round last year with a 3-2 double-overtime victory.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, we'll get a little bit of a rivalry going," said
Loyola Coach Paul Krumpe, a former UCLA player and assistant coach.
"But I think next year, we'll switch and lose the regular-season game
and hopefully win the postseason one."</TE>

<LD>NEW ENGLAND AT DETROIT</LD>
<LD>   Kickoff: Today, 9:30 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   TV: Channel 2.</LD>
<TE>   The line: New England by 5 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Given his options, Mornhinweg decides not to cook the
turkey.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: It's going to take everyone some time to figure out just
what Detroit Coach Marty Mornhinweg was thinking during overtime
Sunday -- and unfortunately for the Lions, four days is all they get.
Winning the toss and electing to kick. Accepting a penalty against
Chicago when the Bears were facing fourth down and a probable punt.
Unable to overcome these self-inflicted setbacks, Detroit lost,
20-17, to extend its road losing streak to 14. On the bright side,
the Lions are 3-2 at home and 9-4 on Thanksgiving during the last 13
years. Then again, Mornhinweg's still their coach. Thanks a lot.</TE>

<TE>   WASHINGTON AT DALLAS</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Today, 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 11.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Washington by 1.</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: The streak ends here.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Sunday, for the first time in 2002, the Cowboys and the
Redskins won on the same day. Dallas defeated Jacksonville, 21-19,
after Fred Taylor fumbled at the goal line and the Jaguars missed a
40-yard field-goal try. Washington upset St. Louis, 20-17, by forcing
a last-second fumble after the Rams had bypassed a tying chip-shot
field-goal attempt. Someone will have a two-game winning streak after
today, although the Redskins are bucking some bad history. Washington
is 0-9 against Dallas since November 1997 and winless at Texas
Stadium since 1995. Old habits are hard to break, but it is possible:
Steve Spurrier called 39 rushing plays against the Rams.</TE>

on Maui.</LD>
<LD>   Love shot 69 and Leonard closed with a 72 in the 36-hole event for
this year's major champions.</LD>
<TE>   PGA champion Rich Beem finished last at one-over 145 after a 73.</TE>

<HD>Detmer Is Out Two to Five Weeks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Philadelphia quarterback Koy Detmer is expected to be out two to five
weeks because of a dislocated left elbow.</LD>
<LD>   Detmer, playing in place of the injured Donovan McNabb, was
injured in the third quarter of the Eagles' 38-17 victory over the
San Francisco 49ers on Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   An MRI exam on Wednesday revealed no ligament damage.</LD>
<TE>   A.J. Feeley, a fifth-round pick last season who started only eight
games at Oregon, takes over as the starter and Tim Hasselbeck, who
was on the practice squad, becomes the backup. Former Pittsburgh
quarterback Tee Martin was signed to the practice squad.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh quarterback Kordell Stewart took most of the snaps at
practice, a strong sign that he'll start for the Steelers on Sunday
at Jacksonville.</TE>
<TE>   Tommy Maddox, Pittsburgh's starter until an injury Nov. 17 at
Tennessee that left him briefly paralyzed, said he's ready to play
but doctors have advised him to take another week off.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart isn't ready to read anything into what happened at
practice.</TE>
<TE>   "The only indication that is going to allow me to know if I'm
starting on Sunday is if Coach [Bill] Cowher says it," Stewart said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis quarterback Kurt Warner showed up at practice with his
throwing hand wrapped in a plastic bag filled with ice.</TE>
<TE>   But ice was more of a precaution for Warner, who sat out five
games because of a broken pinkie.</TE>
<TE>   Warner threw well in practice despite the sore hand, but didn't
take any snaps.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Denver quarterback Brian Griese and tight end Shannon Sharpe made
it through practice without any setbacks and could be ready for
Sunday's game against San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Griese sprained his left knee against Seattle on Nov. 17. Sharpe
had been expected to be out for at least a month after partially
dislocating his right elbow against Oakland on Nov. 11.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chicago quarterback Jim Miller couldn't throw during practice, but
insists he'll be ready Sunday at Green Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, who hasn't thrown in practice for two weeks, might even
sit out pregame warmups at Lambeau Field, hoping not to overextend
his arm.</TE>
<TE>   Miller has shoulder and elbow tendinitis. He replaced Chris
Chandler in the third quarter Sunday and led the Bears to a 20-17
overtime victory over Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Chandler has a sore ankle and is not expected to be ready.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dallas put safety Darren Woodson on injured reserve because of an
abdominal injury, meaning he won't play again this season.</TE>
<TE>   Woodson, who has more tackles than any Cowboy in history, was
injured in the Cowboys' 20-3 loss to Indianapolis on Nov. 17.</TE>
<TE>   The Cowboys filled his roster spot Tuesday by signing rookie Woody
Dantzler off the practice squad.</TE>
<TE>   Dantzler, a former standout quarterback at Clemson, will return
kicks today against Washington.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati released receiver Michael Westbrook, ending his short
and unhappy stay with the NFL's worst team.</TE>
<TE>   Westbrook, 30, was among the Bengals' top off-season acquisitions,
along with former Washington Redskin teammate Gus Frerotte.</TE>
<TE>   Frerotte lost the starting quarterback job after only three games
and Westbrook never made much of an impact on an offense that has
gone through three starting quarterbacks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota running back Michael Bennett, who sprained an ankle
against New England, was upgraded to probable for the Vikings' game
against Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York Giant quarterback Kerry Collins walked off the field at
practice because of a back spasm.</TE>
<TE>   Collins, on the verge of making his 50th consecutive
regular-season start for the Giants, downplayed the problem, saying
he intended to be at work today.</TE>
<TE>   The last Giant quarterback to start 50 regular-season games in a
row was Phil Simms from 1984-87.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Houston quarterback David Carr, limping slightly on his left
ankle, was listed as probable and said he expects to play Sunday at
Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Carr, the No. 1 overall draft pick this year, slightly sprained
his left ankle in Houston's 16-14 victory over the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former Dallas kicker Richie Cunningham was signed by Jacksonville
to replace another former Cowboy, Tim Seder, who was released Tuesday
after missing four of 12 field-goal attempts in five games.</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham has been out of the league for the last two seasons
after a five-year career.</TE>

<HD>LeClair Is Injured in Flyers' Defeat</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pittsburgh goalie Jean-Sebastien Aubin had a good view of the
league's top-ranked power-play unit Wednesday night, and even he was
shaking his head.</LD>
<LD>   "Our power play," said Aubin, "has been amazing."</LD>
<LD>   Mario Lemieux had three of his four assists on the power play and
the Penguins converted four of six chances to beat the slumping
Philadelphia Flyers, 7-2, at Pittsburgh and tie the Flyers for first
place in the Atlantic Division.</LD>
<TE>   To make matters worse for the Flyers, they lost left wing John
LeClair because of a dislocated right shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   LeClair, who has 11 goals and 17 points in 21 games, was injured
when he collided with Marc Bergevin late in the first period and fell
awkwardly.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is ligament damage, then we have something to worry
about," Coach Ken Hitchcock said. "We just have to pray that there is
no damage so that we can avoid surgery."</TE>
<TE>   Aubin stopped 41 shots to earn victories in consecutive games for
the first time since March 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 3, New Jersey 2 -- Kris Draper scored 1:55 into overtime
at Detroit, just over a minute after the Devils had a goal by John
Madden disallowed because it went in off his skate.</TE>
<TE>   Vancouver 3, Carolina 2 -- The Canucks set a franchise record with
their eighth consecutive victory after Daniel Sedin scored the
go-ahead goal with 11:15 to play at Raleigh, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Edmonton 3, Columbus 1 -- Ryan Smyth scored two goals 19 seconds
apart in the first period at Columbus, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 4, Calgary 2 -- Michael Nylander had a goal and three
assists, and Sergei Gonchar scored twice for the Capitals at
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Washington's Jaromir Jagr (groin) and Peter Bondra (back spasms)
sat out the game.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 1, Buffalo 1 -- Fredrick Modin scored the tying goal
4:37 into the third period to give the Lightning a tie at Buffalo,
N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 2, New York Islanders 2 -- Radek Bonk's power-play goal in
the third period helped the Senators extend their unbeaten streak at
New York's Nassau Coliseum to 15 games, dating to 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Nashville 4, San Jose 2 -- Andreas Johansson scored three goals,
two on the power play, and had an assist at Nashville to lead the
Predators to only their third victory.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 5, Minnesota 0 -- Mike Modano and Ulf Dahlen scored
power-play goals, and the Stars remained unbeaten at home in
regulation.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 4, Colorado 4 -- Mike Keane scored the tying goal in the
third period, and Joe Sakic had a goal and two assists to help the
Avalanche earn a tie at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Todd Simpson of Phoenix and Wade Belak of Toronto were suspended
by the league.</TE>
<TE>   Simpson will sit out three games for high sticking Rob DiMaio of
Dallas on Monday. He will lose nearly $25,000 in salary because of
the suspension.</TE>
<TE>   Belak was suspended for two games and will lose more than $8,500
for elbowing Washington's Brendan Witt on Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>Keino Reflects on Legendary Race</HD>
<DH>Now 63 and an IOC member, ever-humble Kenyan takes a lap
around Mexico City track where he ran memorable 1,500.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alan Abrahamson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>This is where the legend of Kip Keino began, in 1968 at Olympic
Stadium, and for the first time in 34 years the legend himself made a
pilgrimage Wednesday to the stadium where he first won Olympic gold.</LD>
<LD>   If anyone is entitled to boast about what he did in the Olympic
Games so long ago, it is Keino. Winner of one of the most celebrated
1,500-meter races ever at the 1968 Mexico City Games. Winner of three
other Olympic medals -- another one in 1968 and two in 1972.</LD>
<LD>   But that has never been the Keino way. Upon seeing the track,
Keino, now 63 and the International Olympic Committee member in his
native Kenya, bounded out of a tour bus, trotted down the ramp into
the stadium -- wearing a green print shirt, long dark pants and shoes
not made for running -- and spontaneously ran a lap. "It's an honor
for me," he said, still humble. "A great honor for me to be here
after 34 years."</LD>
<TE>   In opening the IOC's 114th session Wednesday evening, Jacques
Rogge, the current president, provided a sobering reminder of the
times in which we live and the challenges confronting international
sport.</TE>
<TE>   Security is "the No. 1 priority" for any sports organization, he
told an audience that included Mexican President Vicente Fox and
numerous other dignitaries. Terrorism seeks "to bring peoples,
cultures and religions into conflict." The world, Rogge made it
plain, hungers for what sport can give: "The values that inspire us."</TE>
<TE>   In short, more memories like those of Keino in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   Heading into those Games, most attention was focused on American
Jim Ryun. Ryun -- now a U.S. congressman from Kansas -- hadn't lost
at the 1,500 or the mile in more than three years. Yet Ryun had been
slowed before the Games by mononucleosis earlier in the summer.</TE>
<TE>   Keino was known by only a few track and field experts. But he had
an advantage that now is well appreciated but at the time was little
understood -- he had been training long distances in the thin air at
high altitude in Kenya. Mexico City sits at more than 7,000 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Keino, however, had his own difficulties -- a gall-bladder
infection. In his first race, the 10,000 meters, he doubled over in
pain, fell onto the infield and when the stretcher-bearers came to
get him, got up and, though he was by then disqualified, finished his
final two laps.</TE>
<TE>   Four days later, he won silver in the 5,000 meters.</TE>
<TE>   The day of the 1,500, he was stuck in a traffic jam and jogged the
last mile to the stadium.</TE>
<TE>   On the second lap, Keino poured it on, passing the 800-meter mark
in, as Olympic historian David Wallechinsky puts it, a "seemingly
suicidal" 1:55.3. Everyone waited for Keino to wilt. He didn't.
Instead, he won by 20 meters in a then-Olympic record 3:34.9, Ryun
taking silver.</TE>
<TE>   After the race, as he was taking his victory lap, he neared the
long-jump pit. There, awestruck at what he had done, was American Bob
Beamon, who had just leaped 29 feet 2 1/2 inches -- one of the most
memorable Olympic performances ever, a record that would last for 23
years. "He couldn't say a word," Keino recalled.</TE>
<TE>   That same day in Kenya, Keino's wife, Phyllis, gave birth to their
third daughter. The Keinos have since adopted scores of children;
they run an orphanage and a school in Eldoret, Kenya.</TE>
<TE>   In honor of Beamon, Keino took a joyful leap Wednesday off the
long-jump path, into the pit. So did Charmaine Crooks, a Canadian IOC
member who, running in the relays in the 1984 Los Angeles Games, won
silver.</TE>
<TE>   Then it was time to go -- to get dressed up in evening clothes to
listen to Rogge, to think about what lies ahead while remembering
what has come before, and to be mindful of another lesson about
Olympic greatness. "He's always been so humble," Crooks said of
Keino. "That humility -- it's something every athlete could learn
from."</TE>

<HD>Kimble Has Heart Condition</HD>
<DH>After collapsing at practice Tuesday, Pepperdine center is
diagnosed with potential life-threatening ailment, forcing him to
quit basketball.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rob Fernas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Will Kimble, starting center for the Pepperdine men's basketball
team, has left the squad after being diagnosed with a heart condition
that caused him to collapse during practice Tuesday, Wave assistant
coach Gib Arnold said.</LD>
<LD>   Arnold said Kimble told teammates and coaches Wednesday he
probably would not play basketball again because of his condition,
which Arnold described as a thickening of an artery that could be
life-threatening if Kimble participates in rigorous exercise.</LD>
<LD>   "Doctors told us he's lucky to be alive," Arnold said. "Usually
when things like this happen, the person doesn't wake up. We feel
very fortunate that he's still with us."</LD>
<TE>   Kimble, who could not be reached for comment, passed out at
practice Tuesday and went into convulsions, Arnold said. Teammates
noticed him laying face down near the base of a basket, where he had
gone to sit.</TE>
<TE>   He regained consciousness within a few minutes and was treated by
a trainer before being taken to UCLA Medical Center, where he
underwent tests and was examined by cardiologists, Arnold said.</TE>
<TE>   Kimble was released and is spending the Thanksgiving holiday with
his family in San Bernardino, Arnold said. Kimble, whose mother is a
doctor, is expected to seek additional medical opinions.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine players reacted emotionally Wednesday when told that
Kimble was leaving the team.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a lot of teary eyes," Arnold said. "We'll bounce back,
but it's a blow."</TE>
<TE>   Kimble, a 6-foot-10, 230-pound junior, was expected to be a key
player for the Waves this season, his first as a starter.</TE>
<TE>   "He's our best low-post scorer and our best rebounder," Arnold
said. "He put up some good numbers in the off-season and in our
exhibition games."</TE>
<TE>   Kimble had two points and six rebounds before fouling out Friday
in a 95-81, season-opening loss in overtime to Bradley at Peoria,
Ill.</TE>
<TE>   He was a reliable reserve last season, when Pepperdine tied
Gonzaga for the West Coast Conference regular-season title and
reached the NCAA tournament. He averaged 5.4 points and 3.7 rebounds
for the 22-9 Waves.</TE>
<TE>   Arnold said until Tuesday, Kimble had never been diagnosed with a
heart problem and had never passed out from playing basketball. He
had passed all of his physicals.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine Coach Paul Westphal could not be reached for comment.
The Waves (0-1), considered the co-favorite in the WCC with No.
21-ranked Gonzaga, play Saturday at 7:30 against UC Irvine at
Firestone Fieldhouse in Malibu.</TE>
<TE>   Kimble was an All-San Andreas League selection as a senior at San
Bernardino Pacific High in 2000. He averaged 15.7 points, 12.6
rebounds and four blocks.</TE>

<LD>FIRST HOLE</LD>
<LD>   Walter Donaldson lowers himself on to a faded, dew-covered picnic
table, the moisture seeping through the bottom of his jeans.</LD>
<LD>   He slips on a tattered white golf glove until the tips of his
fingers are visible through the cracks.</LD>
<TE>   He slides into a pair of brown golf shoes with the initials VAGC
written into the side, and the size 11 1/2 written on the heels.</TE>
<TE>   He picks up a soiled, sour green golf bag filled with mismatched
ladies clubs.</TE>
<TE>   With the stare of Tiger Woods and the gait of a king, Donaldson
then marches to the first tee.</TE>
<TE>   It is 6:45 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   There is nobody else here.</TE>
<TE>   For 27 years, there has never been anybody else here.</TE>
<TE>   In the early mornings on this tiny nine-hole golf course hidden in
a corner of the sprawling Veterans Administration hospital grounds in
West Los Angeles, the first twosome is usually Donaldson and his
fears.</TE>
<TE>   A man using our gentlest game to battle the turmoil of
schizophrenia and addiction.</TE>
<TE>   "Fore!" he shouts into the empty mist.</TE>
<TE>   SECOND HOLE</TE>
<TE>   Today we give thanks for things far more important than games. Yet
there is a 55-year-old Vietnam veteran who can remind us of their
place.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in the dining room of his boarding house, Donaldson will
give thanks for sports, because he believes a sport has kept him
alive.</TE>
<TE>   Donaldson is a golfer, only not like the ones you see on
television or at the country club.</TE>
<TE>   He uses clubs and a bag he found in a dumpster.</TE>
<TE>   He plays with balls given to him by patrons at a Pico Boulevard
diner.</TE>
<TE>   His ball markers are bus tokens.</TE>
<TE>   His shoes are rentals that the VA finally just donated to him.</TE>
<TE>   And in his entire life, he has only played one course.</TE>
<TE>   For nearly three decades, nearly every day, Donaldson has played
the postage-stamp VA public course as consistently as he once heard
voices and used drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "With his medication, he behaves like any other person, you would
never notice anything unusual," said Dr. Rochelle Reno, manager of
the VA's Dual Diagnosis Treatment Program. "He just loves golf."</TE>
<TE>   He plays it in the morning before his daily routine of workshops
and therapy in the treatment program.</TE>
<TE>   He might play in the afternoon during a break.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes he plays four rounds in a day.</TE>
<TE>   In all, he has played more than 6,000 rounds on the same nine
holes.</TE>
<TE>   Never once breaking par.</TE>
<TE>   "But I'm getting better, getting closer," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Donaldson has been around here so long that workers in the rusted
Quonset hut that serves as a pro shop ask him to help newcomers and
beginners navigate the sometimes confusing track.</TE>
<TE>   One day this summer, he walked nine holes with a teenage boy who
was so moved, he wrote me a letter about it.</TE>
<TE>   I phoned the course and read parts of the letter to a man who
laughed.</TE>
<TE>   "So," said Dave Wall, "somebody finally found him."</TE>
<TE>   The folks here refer to Donaldson as one of their treasures.</TE>
<TE>   On the second hole this chilly fall morning, you can see why.</TE>
<TE>   He hits his tee shot over a hill, into a seemingly impenetrable
cluster of bushes.</TE>
<TE>   All these years, and sometimes he still can't put it on a fairway.</TE>
<TE>   Yet all these years he's never lost a ball.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll find it," he says cheerfully, scurrying down a steep hill
and off the course, a 6-foot-5 man hunched over a tiny bag like it
was an oversized purse.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think so," I say, a lazy sportswriter standing next to
his pull cart.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll play it," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see how," I say.</TE>
<TE>   He finds it. He plays it. Knocks it out of the weeds and on to the
green.</TE>
<TE>   Because his larynx was partially paralyzed during lung surgery
several years ago, his words run together like a stream over rocks.
Initially, he is difficult to understand.</TE>
<TE>   But listen long enough, and you figure it out. Listen long enough
and you realize he is saying something worth hearing.</TE>
<TE>   He taps his dirt-specked ball into the hole.</TE>
<TE>   "A man can do a whole lot with faith," he says.</TE>
<TE>   THIRD HOLE</TE>
<TE>   The voices began sometime after the end of the bombing and
gunfire.</TE>
<TE>   Donaldson grew up on 74th and Avalon in south L.A., joining the
Air Force shortly after graduating from Fremont High because he
thought his parents could no longer afford to care for him.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it would be better if I wasn't around," he recalls.</TE>
<TE>   Soon he found himself stationed outside Saigon, listening to
battle rage nightly, one of thousands of kids forced to grow up too
soon.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just 20," he remembers. "It was too much."</TE>
<TE>   When he returned home in 1969 after a year in combat, everything
changed. He heard things that weren't there. He saw things that
didn't exist.</TE>
<TE>   "He came back a totally different person," says his mother, Annie.
"I believe it was Vietnam that messed him up."</TE>
<TE>   Donaldson's marriage fell apart, his wife and child remained home
in Canada while he returned to Los Angeles to live an itinerant life
in shelters and labor camps.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what I was like, but I know it wasn't right," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   One day in 1975, discovering him incoherent on the streets, his
father finally took him to the VA hospital for help.</TE>
<TE>   That day, during tests that would diagnose him as a person with
schizophrenia, he wandered out of the large brown buildings to the
golf course.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, his trembling hands picked up a club.</TE>
<TE>   Nine holes and one hour later, he had calmed.</TE>
<TE>   "I hit one ball, and I haven't stopped since," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The emotion he felt that first day still erupts 27 years later, on
this third hole, when he sinks a 30-foot putt for birdie.</TE>
<TE>   "Ha-ha-ha-ha!" he bellows, his huge mouth opening wide around a
thrusting tongue that has been compromised with medication.</TE>
<TE>   He then sticks out his hand, not for a high-five or fist tap, but
a gentlemanly handshake, because this is golf.</TE>
<TE>   FOURTH HOLE</TE>
<TE>   His day begins at 4 a.m., in a twin bed nudged into a matchbox
room at a board-and-care facility on Pico.</TE>
<TE>   He rises before his four housemates turn on the blaring television
behind the paper-thin wall above his head.</TE>
<TE>   He rises before the traffic outside his window fills his room with
noise the decibel equivalent of a train station.</TE>
<TE>   There is a stained coffee mug on his nightstand that reads, "I
putt better than I drive."</TE>
<TE>   Next to it is a golf etiquette calendar. Today's topic: scuffs and
spike marks.</TE>
<TE>   He has no phone. He has no car, nor a driver's license. His
disability and social security check, minus his room and board,
equals about $126 a month in spending money.</TE>
<TE>   He grabs his clubs out of the corner and boards a bus to a coffee
shop named Rae's. "When the people on the bus see me with my clubs,
they call me 'Tiger Woods,' " Donaldson says.</TE>
<TE>   It is the only time that anyone would make that comparison.</TE>
<TE>   At Rae's, he will drink four cups of coffee for $1.03 and load up
on balls handed to him by golfers headed to a country club. After
spending a half-hour on the same counter stool, he boards another bus
for the VA facility, where he will be the first one to arrive at the
course.</TE>
<TE>   There, sometimes in the dark, he waits until somebody shows up so
he can sign in.</TE>
<TE>   "I never play until I sign in," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The patio outside the Quonset hut would never be mistaken for a
clubhouse. There are a few weathered chairs and ashtrays, a tiny
detached bathroom with a creaky door.</TE>
<TE>   The entire 1,144-yard course, with its tiny green and small
fairways, is invisible to most of the golf-mad city.</TE>
<TE>   Just as Donaldson is invisible to them.</TE>
<TE>   He knocks a tee shot alongside the fourth green, and shrugs.</TE>
<TE>   "Out here you're reminded, it's about just you and the ball."</TE>
<TE>   FIFTH HOLE</TE>
<TE>   Donaldson has only four golf shirts and two caps, but one of those
caps says it all.</TE>
<TE>   "Golf Is My Therapy" it reads.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that golf has been his lifeline, and I am so grateful for
that," says Dr. Reno. "Every patient needs a passion that lights up
his life. Without golf, Walter's life would be much emptier and
difficult."</TE>
<TE>   Where did it come from?</TE>
<TE>   Donaldson is asked that question as he tees up on a fifth hole
that does not have a tee box or markers. After all these years, he
knows exactly where to start.</TE>
<TE>   "Golf is struggle, but if you work hard enough, you can achieve
something in it," he says. "I need that. I need something I can work
for. Something I can accomplish."</TE>
<TE>   Golf is the quietest thing in his life. It is the most consistent
event of his day. It does not criticize or judge.</TE>
<TE>   Golf is one of the few things that allows Donaldson to be happy
with who he is.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-seven years, and only once has he even stepped on a
different course.</TE>
<TE>   It was recently, when he accompanied a group of VA members to an
18-hole course in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Donaldson never left the driving range.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't feel right," he says. "It wasn't me."</TE>
<TE>   SIXTH HOLE</TE>
<TE>   Late last summer, a teenage boy and his mother stopped by the VA
for the best deal in town, a quick round of golf for eight bucks a
person.</TE>
<TE>   As they were standing on the first tee, up walked a lanky,
gray-haired man with a wandering tongue and mottled speech.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'Mind if I join you?' " Margaret Foster Dubbins recalls.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a little scary," Andrew Dubbins, now 14, says.</TE>
<TE>   Not knowing the course, and not being very good at the game, they
agreed to let him join.</TE>
<TE>   An hour later, there were tears in the mother's eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Donaldson had worked his strange magic.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an amazing experience," Margaret Foster Dubbins recalls.</TE>
<TE>   Donaldson accompanied them around the course, telling them about
his past, giving tips about the game, showing them every nook and
cranny in the landscape and his life.</TE>
<TE>   Recounting the round on the drive home, the boy became so moved
that the mother encouraged him to write about it.</TE>
<TE>   So Andrew Dubbins, now an eighth-grader at Corpus Christi school
in Pacific Palisades, wrote me an essay about his experience.</TE>
<TE>   On the sixth hole during our round, I ask Walter about Andrew.</TE>
<TE>   "What a nice boy," he says while sinking a par putt. "Young people
today, they don't listen. That was a boy who listens."</TE>
<TE>   SEVENTH HOLE</TE>
<TE>   With several groundskeepers watching on the seventh tee, Donaldson
skulls his tee shot.</TE>
<TE>   He smiles, waves to them, walks toward his ball.</TE>
<TE>   "Golf teaches you to handle anything," he says.</TE>
<TE>   I walk ahead to my ball. A few minutes later, he joins me. After
he sinks his putt, I pull out the scorecard.</TE>
<TE>   "A four?" I say.</TE>
<TE>   "A five," he says.</TE>
<TE>   EIGHTH HOLE</TE>
<TE>   He has never shot better than a 29 on this par-27 course.</TE>
<TE>   But as Donaldson deftly places his eighth tee shot close to the
cup, he mentions that he has done something that few people have done
in a lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   And he has done it twice.</TE>
<TE>   "Two holes in ones!" he exclaims.</TE>
<TE>   Both were in 1987. One was in a club tournament, the other was
during a daily round. In neither case did he save the ball.</TE>
<TE>   "The club gave me the ball when I started the round," he says.
"After I finished, I turned it back in. It was their ball."</TE>
<TE>   NINTH HOLE</TE>
<TE>   At the edge of the ninth tee box is a club-handle monument to the
course's former golf volunteer instructor, Anthony "Tony" Costello.</TE>
<TE>   He first showed Donaldson the game. He has since died. Before
Donaldson tees off here, he walks to the monument, puts his hands
around the club handle, and bows his head.</TE>
<TE>   "This game saved my life from destruction," he says. "I will never
forget the man who taught me."</TE>
<TE>   He finishes the round by sinking a 40-foot birdie putt, howling in
glee, shaking the hand of his playing partner.</TE>
<TE>   When the round started, I thought I could beat this crooked old
man by a dozen strokes.</TE>
<TE>   Turns out, he beat me by five.</TE>
<TE>   I tell him this as he sits back on a picnic bench and carefully
sticks his borrowed shoes into his dumpster golf bag.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh yeah?" says Walter Donaldson, looking confused for the first
time this morning. "I didn't know we were keeping score."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>This is a nice story about Lyle, the tuba player; a Notre Dame
stronghold located in Sherman Oaks, an absurd NCAA rule and a kind
deed by USC Athletic Director Mike Garrett.</LD>
<LD>   I'm sure the Vatican will proclaim that last part about Garrett
performing a kind deed, and having it mentioned in this space, a
certified miracle.</LD>
<LD>   I also know that's what it's probably going to take for the Irish
to beat the Trojans on Saturday in the Coliseum, but then that's a
different, and very ugly, story for the morning newspaper later this
week.</LD>
<TE>   Today there is very good reason to give thanks, because Saturday,
due to the thoughtfulness and extra effort expended by Garrett, fans
will be able to hear "The Irish Clog" played after each Notre Dame
touchdown in the Coliseum. (I'll betcha Garrett hums that tune to
himself all the time.)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FOR THE last 20-some years, the Notre Dame High band from Sherman
Oaks has been playing in the Coliseum on behalf of the University of
Notre Dame in one of those big football-game traditions that has just
been taken for granted -- unless you're one of the band members like
Lyle, the tuba player, who calls it "just the best thing that can
happen" to a tuba player.</TE>
<TE>   But this year the NCAA fiddled with some kind of off-the-wall
rule, and suddenly it became a recruiting violation -- and I'm not
making this stuff up -- for the visiting team to invite a high school
band from the home team's area to entertain fans.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as the University of Notre Dame heard about this, it
informed the high school to stop the music. For the last 10 Notre
Dame-USC games in the Coliseum, the university reimbursed the high
school for buses and food, while getting the kids folding chairs to
sit on in the end zone, but no more.</TE>
<TE>   "When I delivered the news to the kids," said John Combes, the
band's director for the last 35 years, "there was just absolute
silence in the room, and for that to happen with this group, that's
amazing."</TE>
<TE>   Someone familiar with the situation, T. McKimmey, e-mailed me and
so jokingly on Page 2 -- and I don't like to make a habit of telling
jokes in such a serious sports section because the last time I did
that after getting an e-mail, Dodger Boy got canned -- I suggested,
"I'm sure there's a lot of competition for Notre Dame High's tuba
player, but I'd hate to see this whole thing end on a sour note,
preventing him and his friends" from going to the game.</TE>
<TE>   Well, who knew Garrett had a sense of humor? "I understand the
tuba player is one of the best nose tackles in the country," Garrett
joked, and without hesitation after hearing of the band's plight, he
checked to see if there was a way for USC to invite the high school
band to the Notre Dame game.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in the education business, and it's just what you do for
young people when you can," he said. "We know they're playing for
Notre Dame, but it's been a tradition for this band to be a part of
this game, and to not fulfill that tradition wouldn't be fair to all
of us. We'd like to give these kids a good experience."</TE>
<TE>   If that's the case, I said, then it'd be helpful if it was
arranged so Notre Dame wins Saturday -- no reason to send the high
school kids home unhappy.</TE>
<TE>   OK, so Garrett doesn't always have a sense of humor.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE THANKS go to Garrett, however, for making sure almost 150 band
members from Notre Dame High will be in the Coliseum on Saturday
playing the four Irish fight songs they've been practicing and
practicing and practicing.</TE>
<TE>   "They're supposed to play 'Fight On,' I believe," Garrett said
with a laugh, which seriously would qualify as cruel and inhumane
punishment -- especially if you're wearing a navy blue Notre Dame
sweatshirt. "I would imagine they'll also be wearing cardinal and
gold...."</TE>
<TE>   I ran that by the band after an afternoon practice, and the kids
laughed, so I guess I'm not the only one who thinks Garrett has the
makings of a real comedian. In fact, I took a poll, and only one
student raised his hand and professed to being a Trojan fan. Andres
Diaz explained that his brother and sister have USC roots, or else
he'd also be cheering for the right school like everyone else in the
room.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE BAND will pay its own expenses now that the University of
Notre Dame can't be linked to the kids, but according to another
funky NCAA rule, it cannot play music for football fans in Exposition
Park before the game, as it has done in the past.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't aware of that," Garrett said. "Listen, I think they
should go play if they want to play for the people. It's the right
thing to do, and if someone considers it a violation, then I guess
both ND and us would have to self-report it as a violation."</TE>
<TE>   Now that's really going the extra mile for the kids, and I can
only hope the NCAA hears about it, rules immediately and keeps Carson
Palmer from playing against the Irish on Saturday. Then the Notre
Dame band will have really done its job.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "I WANT that tuba player," Garrett said, and I think he was still
kidding.</TE>
<TE>   For whatever reason, I always seem to be delivering bad news to
Garrett, and so I told him junior Lyle Leitelt, the tuba player, is a
fan of the Fighting Irish, who lists UCLA, Cal and Notre Dame as his
colleges of choice at this time.</TE>
<TE>   And what a great kid. He's playing the tuba because the band
needed a volunteer to fill a tuba void, and so he picked up the
35-pound instrument, and anyone who knows anything about a band knows
all the band members tune their own instruments to the sound of the
tuba. He has got to be on his game.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really a neat thing to be a part of this band," he said, and
Friday night -- if the exact count is correct -- the band will be
making its 385th consecutive appearance at a Notre Dame High football
game, dating to 1968.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all excited about the ND-USC game, and it's really nice of
USC to let us play in the Coliseum," he said. "It's so much fun to be
a part of something so big."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the parents, unable to land tickets, will stay home to
catch a glimpse of their kids on TV -- even if it's from the overhead
blimp.</TE>
<TE>   "It's our tradition, and we'll be ready," Combes said. "It's just
a tremendous thing for these high school kids to get the chance to
play at a Division I football game and at a game as big as this."</TE>
<TE>   And they certainly owe a big debt of thanks to Garrett. I just
hope they get the chance to serenade him with a really happy
heartfelt rendition of the Notre Dame victory march when the game is
over.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from David:</TE>
<TE>   "My grandfather continues to live on a farm in southeastern
Nebraska, and I find some offense in your occasional harping on
residents of that state."</TE>
<TE>   Hey, tell him "gobble, gobble, gobble" for me; I know he'll
understand.</TE>

<HD>Scolari Will Tackle Coaching Portugal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Luis Felipe Scolari, the no-nonsense coach who led Brazil to its
fifth World Cup triumph less than five months ago, has reached an
agreement to be Portugal's national coach through the 2004 European
Championship, which is in Portugal.</LD>
<LD>   Word of the agreement came from Scolari's agent, Asaz Felenger,
who Wednesday told the Lisbon radio station TSF that Scolari and
Gilberto Madail, chairman of the Portuguese soccer federation, had
come to terms during a recent meeting.</LD>
<LD>   "Each gave the other his word," Felenger said. "Scolari will be
Portuguese national coach until July 2004, until after Euro 2004."</LD>
<TE>   A federation spokesman declined to confirm the report, saying only
that "talks are going well and ... we may announce a deal within
days."</TE>
<TE>   Athens 2004</TE>
<TE>   The men's and women's soccer gold-medal matches at the Athens 2004
Olympic Games could take place in the port city of Piraeus after the
Hellenic Olympic Committee agreed Wednesday to lease historic but
derelict Karaiskakis Stadium back to its former occupant, the Greek
first division club Olympiakos, for 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of the deal, Olympiakos will pay for the cost of
refurbishing the stadium, which will seat 33,000 when complete.</TE>
<TE>   Evangelos Venizelos, Greece's minister of culture, said the
stadium would be a front-runner to stage the gold-medal games, but
the final decision will be up to FIFA.</TE>
<TE>   A Wizard Tour</TE>
<TE>   Major League Soccer's Kansas City Wizards will travel to South
Africa for a three-game tour, Feb. 4-17, with matches being planned
against teams from the South African Premier League.</TE>
<TE>   The Wizards, MLS champions in 2000, will play the Moroka Swallows
in Mafeking on Feb. 12 and Ajax Cape Town on Feb. 15 in Cape Town.
Details are being completed for a game in Johannesburg.</TE>
<TE>   USA Schedule</TE>
<TE>   Although no announcement has been made by U.S. Soccer, the U.S.
national team will play Argentina in Miami on Feb. 8 and Jamaica in
Kingston on Feb. 12, according to reports from those countries.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Ole, an Argentine sports daily, reported that Coach
Marcelo Bielsa's squad would play Mexico in Los Angeles on Feb. 4 and
the U.S. in Miami four days later.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the Jamaica Gleaner newspaper Tuesday quoted Horace
Burrell, president of the Jamaican soccer federation, as saying that
the Reggae Boyz will play host to the U.S. at the National Stadium in
Kingston on the afternoon of Feb. 12.</TE>
<TE>   Champions League</TE>
<TE>   Thierry Henry, Arsenal's French striker, scored a hat trick
Wednesday as the English champions routed AS Roma, 3-1, in the
European Champions League in front of 70,000 at the Olympic Stadium
in Rome.</TE>
<TE>   Arsenal fell behind to a fourth-minute shot by Antonio Cassano
that went in off the post, but Henry tied it two minutes later and
put the game away with goals in the 70th and 75th minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Newcastle United, another English Premier League team, was soundly
beaten, 4-1, on its own ground by Inter Milan, after Welsh striker
Craig Bellamy was ejected for a retaliatory foul on Marco Materazzi
only five minutes into the match.</TE>
<TE>   "It was irresponsible and unprofessional, and for that the club
has suffered," Newcastle Coach Bobby Robson said of Bellamy's red
card. "Those only are the only two words I would use."</TE>
<TE>   Inter's goals came from Domenico Morfeo, Matias Almeyda, Hernan
Crespo and Alvaro Recoba. Newcastle got a consolation goal from
Peru's Nolberto Solano.</TE>
<TE>   Barcelona stretched its unbeaten run in the Champions League to
nine games when it defeated Bayer Leverkusen, 2-1, in Germany, where
Javier Saviola and Marc Overmars scored in the second half to offset
Dimitar Berbatov's goal for Leverkusen.</TE>
<TE>   In Spain, Ajax Amsterdam got an 88th-minute goal from Zlatan
Ibrahimovic and appeared set for victory, but Miguel Angel Angulo
scored in the final minute to earn Valencia the 1-1 tie.</TE>

<HD>Stewart Ready to Talk Turkey</HD>
<DH>Winston Cup champion will change gears and spend his
Thanksgiving driving in Midget Grand Prix at Irwindale.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Shav Glick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What does a champion race driver do for a vacation? If he's Tony
Stewart, he goes racing.</LD>
<LD>   The newly crowned Winston Cup champion, who will collect almost $4
million next Friday in New York as his reward, will be at Irwindale
Speedway tonight to race in the U.S. Auto Club's 62nd Turkey Night
Midget Grand Prix.</LD>
<LD>   Stewart won the race in 2000 and missed it last year only because
NASCAR scheduled a race in New Hampshire, postponed because of the
Sept. 11 terrorist attack, on that weekend.</LD>
<TE>   The switch isn't something everyone can do -- from 3,400-pound,
800-horsepower stock cars to 900-pound, 300-horsepower midgets -- but
Stewart revels in it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of like taking off a pair of street shoes and slipping
into a comfortable pair of old shoes," Stewart said of the
transition.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time I can find the time to run a USAC midget, I'm going to
do it. My roots are in USAC, and racing midgets is my way of having
fun. So, I will be there."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart also has ties to the race through Cary Agajanian, his
business agent whose family owns the USAC sanction to the
Thanksgiving night race, and to car owner Steve Lewis, a Laguna Beach
racing entrepreneur who provided him with a midget car in 1995 with
which he won the series crown. He was also in Lewis' car for his 2000
Irwindale win, and he'll be in the same car tonight.</TE>
<TE>   After tonight's 100-lap race, Stewart will race Saturday night in
Las Vegas and then head east for a weeklong NASCAR promotional tour
of Washington and New York that will culminate in the Winston Cup
awards banquet Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   Indianapolis 500 winners often drove in the Turkey Night race in
the 1950s and '60s, but this will be the first time a Winston Cup
champion has been in the race.</TE>
<TE>   Indy winners Bill Vukovich, Johnnie Parsons, A.J. Foyt and
Parnelli Jones all won both events, and 500 winners Sam Hanks, Rodger
Ward and Mario Andretti drove in Thanksgiving Night races but never
won.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart will be part of a five-car Ford-powered team entered by
Lewis. His teammates are J.J. Yeley, USAC Silver Crown champion; Dave
Darland, USAC midget champion; Kasey Kahne, former USAC midget
champion and current Busch series driver; and Bobby East, whose
father, Bob, built the Beast chassis for Lewis' cars.</TE>
<TE>   Darland holds an 83-point lead over Yeley in defense of his midget
championship after finishing 10th last week in Tucson; Yeley was
ninth. Only two races remain, tonight and Saturday in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Steele, last year's Turkey Night winner, will be back in
another of East's cars, but powered by Mopar. Steele also won the
richest midget event in history last September, sweeping a
doubleheader at Indianapolis Raceway Park that paid him $60,280.</TE>
<TE>   "I like Irwindale; I always run pretty good there," said Steele,
who won the first midget car race ever on the half-mile paved oval,
March 27, 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a whole lot different from IRP, so we'll just fine tune
the car a bit and be ready to race."</TE>
<TE>   Brothers Cole and Dana Carter, third-generation Turkey Night
drivers, are in the entry, which includes nearly every ranking midget
driver in the country. Duane Carter, their grandfather, finished
third in 1945 behind Danny Oakes and Duke Nalon, and Pancho Carter
finished second in 1974 to Danny McKnight. Pancho, a 17-time starter
in the Indy 500, is now managing his sons' careers.</TE>
<TE>   There will also be a 40-lap sprint car race and a 20-lap Ford
Focus race. Qualifying will start at 4:30 p.m. with racing at 7.</TE>

<HD>Mourning After</HD>
<DH>With UCLA's big hole at center, things probably will get
worse before they get better for Lavin and inexperienced Bruins.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Go ahead, UCLA fans. Boo your voices raw as you did after the
25-point exhibition loss two weeks ago.</LD>
<LD>   Jeer the players as you did after the second exhibition loss one
week ago.</LD>
<LD>   Yell insults at the coach as you did after the overtime loss to
San Diego on Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   It's a catharsis. Let it all out. But don't think it will change a
thing.</TE>
<TE>   Neither will a blowout by Duke on Saturday, or by Kansas in
December, or by Arizona in January.</TE>
<TE>   Better hunker down and become accustomed to mediocrity for the
time being, as distasteful as that prospect might be.</TE>
<TE>   Barring a dramatic off-the-court incident, Steve Lavin is going to
remain as coach, at least through this season. College coaches don't
get dumped mid-season, certainly not by first-year athletic
directors.</TE>
<TE>   And the Bruins aren't going to get dramatically better soon. Lavin
is the first to admit the team has serious flaws that only time and
experience can fix.</TE>
<TE>   Among them:</TE>
<TE>   * Freshman post players Michael Fey and Ryan Hollins are light
years from filling the void left by last season's center, Dan
Gadzuric.</TE>
<TE>   Fey played three minutes against San Diego and made an ill-advised
pass for a turnover the first time he touched the ball. Hollins
played two minutes, just long enough to commit a turnover and a foul.
Neither center had a point or a rebound.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a big-time learning experience for me right now," Fey
said.</TE>
<TE>   Lavin faces a coaching quandary: The freshmen won't improve unless
they play, yet they shouldn't play because they aren't ready.</TE>
<TE>   With forward T.J. Cummings masquerading as a center, UCLA got
pushed around by San Diego post players Jason Keep and Jason Blair,
who combined for 47 points and 31 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Silver lining: There are no dominant centers in the Pacific 10
Conference this season. Fey and Hollins could progress enough to
become moderately effective by the time conference play begins, and
power forwards Josiah Johnson, Andre Patterson and Marcedes Lewis
could help.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, a sophomore, had a career-high nine points against San
Diego. Patterson, a sophomore who is considered the team's best
rebounder, will join the team in mid-December provided he makes
sufficient academic progress this fall. Lewis, a freshman, is a tight
end on the football team.</TE>
<TE>   * Point guard Cedric Bozeman has yet to prove he can control the
tempo and do what it takes to protect a lead.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-6 sophomore is tentative in key moments and missed an
open follow shot from the paint that would have beaten San Diego in
regulation. Also, it isn't clear whether he has improved his horrid
28.6% free-throw shooting of a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Silver lining: Bozeman equaled career highs with 13 points and
eight assists against San Diego and had only one turnover.</TE>
<TE>   * The players are out of shape. Despite the plodding pace of the
San Diego game, Bozeman and senior forward Jason Kapono suffered leg
cramps in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Kapono, the leading scorer the last three seasons, missed six of
his last seven shots, including two potential game-winners at the end
of regulation. Afterward, he said the weakness in his legs affected
his shot.</TE>
<TE>   Bozeman left the game to have a trainer rub out his calf late in
the second half while his teammates frittered away a lead.</TE>
<TE>   Silver lining: Kapono and Bozeman each played 40 or more minutes
because reserve guard Ryan Walcott must sit out the first two games.
Walcott's return should help keep everyone fresh.</TE>
<TE>   "What's really clear is that we are a team in serious transition,"
Lavin said. "Until you play the games, you are not as fully aware of
how dramatic a transition it is. We're behind where I want to be at
this point. But I'm also encouraged about glimpses of potential. I
think we will be a good team by the end of the season."</TE>
<TE>   Teams have improved under Lavin before. The Bruins are 3-4 in
openers since he became coach in 1996, yet advanced to the Sweet
Sixteen in five of the previous six seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we've ever had a good start," he said. "It's about
incrementally getting better, finding out about your team early so
you can be good late. That's the approach, the blueprint you build
your team with."</TE>
<TE>   It's also an approach that doesn't win over fans that don't want
to pay to watch a team that essentially treats nonconference games as
exhibitions.</TE>
<TE>   Attendance at Pauley Pavilion has declined in recent years. But
the number of fans loudly expressing their displeasure is rising.</TE>
<TE>   Those trends will continue as long as the team struggles. But this
roster, under this coach, is not going to transform into a crisp,
mistake-free unit overnight.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it does by March might determine how much longer Bruin
fans must endure this pattern.</TE>

<KH>UCLA REPORT</KH>
<HD>A Gimpy Gesser Could Face UCLA</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jason Gesser has more than an ankle sprain, which should give UCLA a
greater chance to win its regular-season finale Dec. 7.</LD>
<LD>   The Washington State quarterback is among the nation's most
dangerous players when sound. But his ability to scramble will be
severely compromised -- if he is able to play.</LD>
<LD>   "Ligaments are messed up in my ankle," Gesser said. "It's a high
ankle sprain combined with something else. I really don't know.</LD>
<TE>   "[Doctors] are still doing a lot of tests on me, waiting for the
swelling to go down to see a lot of the things they want to see. Once
the swelling gets out, they can do more tests on it and see what
really is wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Gesser, who has passed for 2,922 yards and 25 touchdowns, was
injured during the Cougars' triple-overtime loss to Washington on
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of guys are saying it is a two- to six-week thing, from 20
days to 35 days," he said. "I'm still in limbo over what the whole
verdict is going to be."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA knows that should Gesser play, he would be forced to utilize
the shotgun formation on most pass plays.</TE>
<TE>   "They wouldn't be able to use certain formations," Bruin Coach Bob
Toledo said. "But they go from the shotgun a lot, anyway. His ability
to elude people is what makes him special, and he might lose some of
that."</TE>
<TE>   The backup is Matt Kegel, who has completed 26 of 39 passes for
203 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a terrific passer and he's going to be our quarterback next
year, anyway," Cougar Coach Mike Price said.</TE>
<TE>   Gesser isn't the only key Cougar injured. Jermaine Green, the
Cougars' leading rusher, is questionable because of a groin injury.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Objections from the victim's family delayed a possible plea
bargain in C.J. Niusulu's felony battery case in Barstow. A trial
date will be set unless the freshman defensive tackle reaches an
agreement with prosecutors by Dec. 17.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office is eager to reach an agreement on
misdemeanor battery, which would allow Niusulu to remain on
scholarship at UCLA. But the family of Danny Walker is resistant.</TE>
<TE>   Niusulu punched Walker in the face in July at a Barstow drive-in
theater. Walker, a ticket-taker at the drive-in, suffered a broken
jaw and broken nose. Niusulu, who played well as a reserve in five
games, underwent an appendectomy last week and is out for the season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA is off until Monday.</TE>

<HD>Mourning After</HD>
<DH>Bibby, facing possible punishment for his comments, would
like to replay final seconds of USC's loss to Rhode Island.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Pacific 10 Conference will consider punishing USC Coach Henry
Bibby for comments he made about game officials after the Trojan
basketball team's 73-71 overtime loss Tuesday night at Rhode Island.</LD>
<LD>   Assistant Commissioner Jim Muldoon said Wednesday that any action,
most likely a reprimand, probably will come next week.</LD>
<LD>   But Bibby, a cross-country flight obviously having failed to sooth
his angst, made it clear Wednesday afternoon he is not finished
fighting.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not accepting a reprimand in the Pac-10," he said. "They need
to look into the situation and find out what happened. I have a
right, in this country, to voice my opinion. Should I get reprimanded
for voicing my opinion? No.</TE>
<TE>   "Am I to be reprimanded for telling the truth?"</TE>
<TE>   Bibby's version of the truth makes him want to file a protest over
what happened in the final 2.2 seconds of overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Rhode Island, playing its first game in $54-million Ryan Center,
took the lead on a Dustin Hellenga basket as the shot clock expired.
The buzzer led the Rams to believe that the game was over and the
team and several fans stormed the court.</TE>
<TE>   USC quickly passed the ball in and Desmon Farmer made a
three-point basket at the other end of the court, after which the
Trojans, believing they had won at the buzzer, celebrated as they ran
to their locker room.</TE>
<TE>   Utilizing a new rule that allows referees to watch replays of
game-ending plays, the officials determined that the ball was still
in Farmer's hand when time expired and the Rams were declared
winners.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby doesn't dispute that Farmer's shot was late. But he says
Rhode Island should have been assessed a technical foul before that.</TE>
<TE>   "If the shot wasn't good and the clock went off, that's the rules
of the game," Bibby said. "But if there are more than five players on
the floor ... that are impeding the progress of us getting the
basketball in, then that's a technical foul."</TE>
<TE>   Had a technical been called, USC would have received two free
throws and possession.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, Bibby said, whistles were blown as the Trojans brought the
ball up court, which should have stopped play and, thus, given USC a
chance to inbound the ball and play the final 2.2 seconds after
clearing the court.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby said the three-man Atlantic 10 Conference officiating crew
of Joe DeMayo, Murph Shapiro and Bill McCarthy never gave him an
official reason for the final decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I think one of the officials' explanation was that the [extra
Rhode Island] guys on the floor did not stop the progress of the
play," Bibby said. "How ludicrous is that? That's not for him to say.
It's for him to call the rules.</TE>
<TE>   "The rules are that if there are more than five people on the
floor and the ball is in play, it's a technical foul. That's what
should have been called."</TE>
<TE>   So what does Bibby think will happen if USC files a protest?</TE>
<TE>   "Probably nothing would happen," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But what would he like to see happen?</TE>
<TE>   "To play the 2.2 seconds over again and we shoot the technical and
get the ball and play from there," Bibby said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not realistic, but in all fairness to USC and in all
fairness to the kids that played the basketball game, that played
their hearts out, that's fair."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the next ruling about the game might come from the
Pac-10, which has jurisdiction when any of its coaches chooses to rip
a game official, as Bibby did after the game.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the worst-officiated game I've ever seen since I've been
coaching basketball, since 1981," Bibby said of a game in which the
Trojans were called for nine more fouls, 25-16, and attempted 11
fewer free throws, 21-10, than the Rams.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby, who said after the game that the officials wanted Rhode
Island to win the first game in its new, on-campus arena, said the
experience has soured him on playing East Coast games -- even if they
do give his program more national recognition.</TE>
<TE>   "It just wasn't a fair game," he said. "It's tough to want to go
back East to play when you're in situations like that."</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anthony Davis predicted a few scoring runs but could not imagine the
results. Or the reaction.</LD>
<LD>   Not every day. Not after 30 years.</LD>
<LD>   In restaurants. In airports. In almost any social or business
situation that Davis finds himself, the subject invariably comes up.</LD>
<TE>   Six touchdowns in one game.</TE>
<TE>   Two on spectacular kick returns.</TE>
<TE>   Against Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   "That game changed my life," said Davis, the former USC running
back who became the Fighting Irish's arch-nemesis with his
performance at the Coliseum in 1972. "It's amazing how it carries on
with me."</TE>
<TE>   Davis, 50, will be on the Coliseum sidelines Saturday when
sixth-ranked USC plays seventh-ranked Notre Dame in the
regular-season finale for both teams. The game, the most significant
in the storied rivalry since 1988, includes several potential
game-breakers.</TE>
<TE>   But it is unlikely that any player will produce like the
high-stepping Davis did on Dec. 2, 1972, when the top-ranked Trojans
defeated the No. 10 Irish, 45-23, en route to an unbeaten season and
undisputed national championship.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, a 5-9, 185-pound sophomore from San Fernando High, returned
the opening kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown and also scored on a
one- and five-yard runs in the first quarter. He added a four-yard
touchdown early in the third quarter and a back-breaking 96-yard
kickoff return late in the period after Notre Dame pulled to within
25-23. His final touchdown came early in the fourth quarter on an
eight-yard run.</TE>
<TE>   Davis finished with 368 all-purpose yards, 218 from kickoff
returns. He also rushed for 99 yards and led the Trojans with three
receptions for 51 yards.</TE>
<TE>   After the game, USC Coach John McKay said, "I've never seen a
greater day by an individual than Anthony Davis' performance today."</TE>
<TE>   Said Notre Dame Coach Ara Parseghian: "The worst part about him is
that I have to look at him the next couple of years."</TE>
<TE>   Davis also scored a touchdown in a loss to Notre Dame in 1973 and
four more in USC's legendary 55-24 comeback victory over the Fighting
Irish in 1974. But the 1972 game started his legacy.</TE>
<TE>   "I was fortunate to be on a team with so many great players that
season," said Davis, now a real estate developer. "That team was
probably the best in the history of USC. Maybe the history of college
football."</TE>
<TE>   So talented were the Trojans, Davis began the season third on the
depth chart behind junior Rod McNeill and sophomore Allen Carter.</TE>
<TE>   "A.D. was lost in the shuffle a little bit initially," said John
Robinson, the Trojans' running backs coach at the time. "He was cocky
and not exactly an establishment guy, but he was good."</TE>
<TE>   Davis had to be to play on a team that included tight end Charles
Young, fullback Sam Cunningham, offensive tackle Pete Adams,
linebacker Richard Wood and defensive tackle John Grant, all of whom
were All-Americans that season. Young, Cunningham and Adams were
chosen in the first round of the 1973 NFL draft and flanker Lynn
Swann and offensive tackle Steve Riley were first-round picks in
1974.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't a boastful team, but we knew what we could do,"
Cunningham said. "Even when our offense had an off day, our defense
shut people down. We would beat people up and the defense would beat
people up. It really didn't make a difference."</TE>
<TE>   USC, coming off consecutive 6-4-1 seasons, opened at Arkansas.</TE>
<TE>   "We could have easily gone down there and laid an egg," recalled
Mike Rae, the Trojans' quarterback and kicker who was selected as the
team's most valuable player. "Instead, we went down and destroyed
them."</TE>
<TE>   USC won, 31-10, and reeled off six more victories with McNeill and
Carter doing the bulk of the ballcarrying. But injuries to both
provided Davis with his first career start against Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   On a wet field in Eugene, Davis rushed for 206 yards in 25 carries
and scored on runs of 48 and 55 yards as the Trojans won, 18-0.</TE>
<TE>   "The next week, John Robinson walked into the hotel room before
the game and said, 'You're starting,' " Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   After victories over Washington State and UCLA, the Trojans had
two weeks to prepare for Notre Dame. The previous season, USC and
Notre Dame brawled on the field in South Bend, Ind., during a 28-14
Trojan victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I can remember us being worried," Robinson recalled. "It was like
you can run on everybody but you can't run on the Irish."</TE>
<TE>   Davis wasn't concerned.</TE>
<TE>   "They're big and strong," Davis had told The Times' Jeff Prugh,
"but if I can get outside -- get into the open -- I think I can go
all the way a few times."</TE>
<TE>   USC players emerged from the Coliseum tunnel riding a wave of
emotion from a pregame speech delivered by assistant Marv Goux. After
the starters were introduced to the national television audience,
teammate Charles "Sugar Bear" Hinton approached Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'I'm going to try and get you a good block so we can get
good field position,' " Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis caught Cliff Brown's kick at the three, got a block from
Hinton and burst through Notre Dame's coverage to the end zone. "I
got there so quick, I went untouched," Davis said. "I got to the 10
and I was thinking, 'Well, I said I was going to score. That's one.'
"</TE>
<TE>   USC led, 19-10, at halftime, but the Irish pulled to within 25-23
on a touchdown with two minutes left in the third quarter, setting
the stage for Davis' second return.</TE>
<TE>   Parseghian had Brown try a squib kick to keep the ball away from
Davis, but the ball went out of bounds. Instead of trying another
squib kick, Parseghian told Brown to kick the ball deep.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to pin them down in their own territory," Parseghian
said afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Davis caught the ball at the four, then started up field and broke
toward the left sideline. A Notre Dame player hit him on the foot at
the 35 but Davis kept his balance.</TE>
<TE>   The last player between Davis and the goal line was Notre Dame
defensive back Tim Rudnick. Davis faked to the inside at the 25 and
then cut back the other way, leaving Rudnick behind with a move
teammates dubbed "The Funky Chicken."</TE>
<TE>   "I saw Parseghian and it looked like he was going to jump off the
sideline and get me," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis scored his sixth touchdown early in the fourth quarter three
plays after the Trojans intercepted a pass. Cunningham scored USC's
final touchdown as the Trojans completed an 11-0 regular season
before hammering Ohio State, 42-17, in the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think any of the players were aware at the time that he
had scored six touchdowns," Rae recalled. "We were concentrating on
the game. If I had known, I would have said to Anthony, 'You have
five of them. How about I get one?' "</TE>
<TE>   Davis finished the season with 1,191 yards and averaged 5.8 yards
a carry. He was an All-American in 1974 and Heisman Trophy runner-up
and ranks third on the Trojans' career rushing list with 3,724 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that was so great about Anthony, and something I
haven't seen since Marcus Allen, was the way he knew how to set up
his blocks," said Allan Graf, who started at guard from 1970-72 and
was also a high school teammate of Davis'. "He was a lineman's dream.
He knew how to help himself by helping the people blocking for him."</TE>
<TE>   Davis did not duplicate his college feats in the pros. He was
selected by the New York Jets in the second round of the 1975 draft
but signed instead with the Southern California Sun of the World
Football League. He also played in the Canadian Football League, and
with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Houston Oilers and Los Angeles Rams in
the NFL before finishing his pro career with the Los Angeles Express
of the U.S. Football League.</TE>
<TE>   "That game against Notre Dame followed me to the pros," Davis
said. "Guys would tackle me and say, 'You're not scoring six
touchdowns on us, you S.O.B!' "</TE>
<TE>   Davis is enjoying USC's revival this season and anticipates
another classic game between the Trojans and Fighting Irish on
Saturday. The Coliseum is sold out. Both teams are ranked in the top
10.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to bring back a lot of memories," Davis said. "The
kind that nobody forgets."</TE>

<HD>Fargas Feels History Is on His Side</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Justin Fargas will be carrying the ball along with the weight of
USC's tailback tradition Saturday when sixth-ranked USC plays
seventh-ranked Notre Dame at the Coliseum.</LD>
<LD>   With Mike Garrett in USC's athletic director's box, Anthony Davis
on the sidelines and Charles White and Marcus Allen also possibly in
attendance, Fargas said he is thankful for the opportunity.</LD>
<LD>   "The guys that have played this position before and done so many
great things, you have to know they're watching," Fargas said.
"There's not much more motivation you need."</LD>
<TE>   Fargas is expected to play a key role against an opportunistic
Notre Dame defense that features one of the best secondaries USC will
have faced.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to establish a rhythm running the ball and control the
clock," Fargas said.</TE>
<TE>   Fargas has gained 473 yards in 121 carries and scored five
touchdowns. Playing before a sellout crowd in the Coliseum is exactly
what he dreamed about when he decided to transfer from Michigan for
his senior season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be the ultimate football experience -- I already
know it and can feel it," he said. "Just the rivalry and tradition
and everything that's at stake. You couldn't ask for a better stage."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans went through a spirited practice that featured senior
guard Zach Wilson tangling with defenders in two incidents.</TE>
<TE>   Midway through the workout, Wilson emerged from the bottom of a
pile without his helmet on his head.</TE>
<TE>   "I pulled it off because my chin strap was up in my mouth and it
didn't feel very good," Wilson said.</TE>
<TE>   Did someone help put it there?</TE>
<TE>   "Oh yeah, everyone is just hyped up and ready to go," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coach Pete Carroll said center Norm Katnik will practice today to
test the high ankle sprain that has prevented him from participating
in contact drills this week. Derek Graf worked again with the
first-team offense.... Tight end Gregg Guenther did not practice
because of a sore left knee but will play Saturday, Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC officials are advising fans to arrive early for Saturday's
game, which is a sellout. Once the public parking lots around the
Coliseum are full, cars will be directed to the USC campus, the USC
Parking Center and the Shrine Auditorium lots. Parking is also
available at the Convention Center's South Hall and Venice parking
structures, on Figueroa Street between Venice Boulevard and Pico
Boulevard, for $10. Free shuttles will begin running at noon and will
drop passengers at Figueroa and Exposition Boulevard. After the game,
the shuttles will run until midnight.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carla Bennett had 15 points and Drake's defense made three stands in
the final minute as the Bulldogs defeated No. 20 Iowa State, 63-61,
Wednesday night at Ames, Iowa.</LD>
<LD>   Iowa State (1-1), which defeated Drake by 30 points each of the
last two seasons, suffered its first loss in a nonconference
regular-season game at home since Drake won at Hilton Coliseum on
Dec. 7, 1994.</LD>
<LD>   "We had a lot of wide-open shots that we missed," said Iowa State
Coach Bill Fennelly, who had been 39-0 against nonconference foes in
the regular season. "With a team like we have, we have to execute to
win and we didn't do that."</LD>
<TE>   Anne O'Neil led Iowa State with 16 points.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Nicole Denmon added 14 points for Drake.</TE>

<HD>Second-Half Surge a Winner for Venice</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Yoon, Ben Bolch</AU>
<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It took a while for the vaunted Venice offense to get going Wednesday
night, but once it started rolling, it didn't stop.</LD>
<LD>   Venice scored on all four of its second-half possessions and
cruised to a 44-35 victory over Roosevelt in a City Championship
quarterfinal game at Venice.</LD>
<LD>   Quarterback Eddie Miller completed 14 of 22 passes for 238 yards
and had touchdown passes of 23, 65 and 63 yards for Venice, which had
244 of its 376 total yards in the wild second half.</LD>
<TE>   When the fourth-seeded Gondoliers (10-2) face Taft next week, it
will be the first semifinal appearance for Venice in the
upper-division playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "We started a little slow in the first half, but this offense is
bound to get going sooner or later," Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, the last play of the first half jump-started the
offense. Venice took possession with a 10-6 lead and eight seconds
left in the first half. Instead of running out the clock, the
Gondoliers ran a hook-and-lateral.</TE>
<TE>   Miller hit receiver B.J. Vickers for an 11-yard gain. Vickers, who
finished with five catches for 93 yards and a touchdown, then pitched
to Gerold Rodriguez, who raced 31 yards for a touchdown and a 17-6
halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez caught four passes for 11 yards and scored a career-high
three touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Fifth-seeded Roosevelt (10-2) pulled to within 17-14 on its first
drive of the second half, but Venice took control after that. The
Gondoliers scored in two plays, forced a punt, then scored in four
plays for a 31-14 lead with 4:57 left in the third quarter. Venice
led, 44-27 until Roosevelt scored a touchdown and two-point
conversion with 12 seconds left in the game.</TE>
<TE>   Zach Owens led Roosevelt with 110 yards and a touchdown in 18
carries. Chris Hurtado added 95 yards rushing in 14 carries and Jody
Adewale had 66 yards and two touchdowns in 10 carries for the Rough
Riders, who had 322 yards rushing and 56 passing.</TE>
<TE>   -- Peter Yoon</TE>
<TE>   Lake Balboa Birmingham 35, Fairfax 14 -- Chad Green caught
touchdown passes of 19 and 36 yards and returned an interception 102
yards for a touchdown to rally Birmingham from a 14-0 deficit in a
City Championship quarterfinal game at Birmingham.</TE>
<TE>   The sixth-seeded Patriots (9-3) play host to No. 7 Gardena in the
semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   A lucky bounce started the unraveling of Fairfax (7-4) at the end
of the first half. On a fourth-and-four play from the Fairfax 37,
Birmingham quarterback Ryan Lombardo had a pass bounce off the hands
of defensive back Marques Floyd. Dennis Keyes caught the ball and ran
into the end zone for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Lombardo completed 16 of 34 passes for 271 yards and three
touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Fairfax, which lost three fumbles and had a second pass
intercepted, was led by Derrick Hill, who rushed for 139 yards in 32
carries. Kareem Dennis scored Lion touchdowns on a three-yard run and
19-yard reception.</TE>
<TE>   -- Eric Sondheimer</TE>
<TE>   Gardena 38, Jefferson 14 -- The host Panthers capitalized on seven
turnovers to avenge an earlier loss to the Democrats and advance to
their first City Championship semifinal since 1983.</TE>
<TE>   DeAndre Hughes rushed for 138 yards and three touchdowns in 22
carries for Gardena (9-3), which overcame five lost fumbles.
Linebacker Milo Otis made two of the Panthers' four interceptions,
returning one 30 yards for a score.</TE>
<TE>   Jefferson, coming off a rousing first-round upset of second-seeded
Carson, trailed, 28-0, at halftime and didn't convert a first down
until there was 3:15 left in the third quarter. The Democrats (6-6)
could muster only 106 yards of offense, including 82 yards in the
second half with the game already decided.</TE>

<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Glenn Thompkins, the first-year football coach at Rialto Eisenhower
High, was arrested Tuesday on suspicion he had a sexual relationship
with an underage female student.</LD>
<LD>   Thompkins, 26, was taken off campus about 2:30 p.m. and booked
into West Valley Detention Center in Rancho Cucamonga. He posted
bail, which was set at $10,000.</LD>
<LD>   "He has not been formally charged, and won't be until there is a
final determination that charges will be filed," said Richard
Maxwell, chief deputy district attorney for San Bernardino County.
"The only significant event that has happened is that he bailed out."</LD>
<TE>   Thompkins has been placed on paid administrative leave until
police and school investigations are complete. Rialto Unified School
District spokesperson Marilyn Cardosi confirmed that the school will
conduct its own investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Eisenhower advanced to a quarterfinal game Friday against Long
Beach Poly in the Southern Section Division I playoffs. Assistant
coaches conducted practice Tuesday and Athletic Director Tom Hoak,
who coached football for 19 seasons before retiring last year, will
supervise the coaches and team.</TE>
<TE>   The investigating officer, Det. Kris Arthur of the Rialto Police
Dept., opened the case about 10:30 a.m. on a complaint from the
parents of a 17-year-old student. He arrested Thompkins in the
administration building after an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Thompkins is a graduate of Eisenhower and was quarterback for the
1993 team that won the Southern Section Division I championship. He
was chosen the division's player of the year and went on to play at
UCLA, from where he graduated in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   -- Martin Henderson</TE>
<TE>   It's rare for a cross-country team to be without its top runner
because of an injury yet still produce an individual section
champion.</TE>
<TE>   That's what happened Saturday when freshman Bridget Ballard of
North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake won the Division IV girls' race in
the Southern Section championships at Mt. San Antonio College.</TE>
<TE>   Ballard was Harvard-Westlake's No. 2 runner behind junior Lindsay
Flacks. But when a groin injury forced Flacks to drop out of the
section preliminaries on Nov. 16 and kept her from running in the
section finals, Ballard stepped forward to win the title that Flacks
won last year.</TE>
<TE>   Ballard's time of 18 minutes 6 seconds over the 2.91-mile course
broke the school record of 18:09 set by Flacks last year, cut 35
seconds off Ballard's previous best at Mt. SAC and led
Harvard-Westlake to second place behind defending state champion Oak
Park.</TE>
<TE>   "I think she's been content to be our No. 2 runner,"
Harvard-Westlake girls' Coach Kim Hieatt said of Ballard. "But with
Lindsay out, she was able to relax and show her talents."</TE>
<TE>   Flacks is expected to run in the state championships in Fresno on
Saturday.</TE>

<HD>Tustin Finds Playoff Success After Living on the Edge</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With two games left in the regular season, Tustin was looking at a
losing record and needing to win those games to qualify for the
Southern Section Division VI playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Myron Miller told his players if they lost either game and
needed a coin flip to gain the Century League's last playoff berth
that he wouldn't even allow them that opportunity.</LD>
<LD>   At-large teams must have at least a .500 record to be eligible.</LD>
<TE>   "I came from a time when only league champs went [to the
playoffs]," Miller said. "If we don't make it because we're not .500,
I don't want to be in the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   Tustin won out, finished 5-5 overall, 4-1 in the Century League,
and was seeded fourth.</TE>
<TE>   The Tillers won their first-round game over Norwalk Glenn
convincingly, 53-8, on Saturday behind Terrell Harris' four
touchdowns and play at Placentia Valencia in a quarterfinal game on
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Tustin got in its do-or-die situation because of its 1-4 record in
nonleague games. The regular-season record of its nonleague opponents
-- Santa Ana Foothill, Compton Dominguez, Anaheim Servite, Anaheim
Western and Mission Viejo -- was a combined 39-11.</TE>
<TE>   But Miller said it isn't easy to schedule opponents, especially
because of his team's double-wing offense, which few teams run and is
difficult to replicate in practice, and because the Tillers play very
physically. Tight end Chris Barrett and offensive lineman Sam Baker
are two of the top prospects in the country.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody really wants to play us unless it's a team that's not
afraid of anybody," Miller said. "I don't get to play the teams that
other guys are playing because they're using spread-out offenses and
it's basically touch football.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not all by design. I was just tired of going out to
Riverside every week, so I took on some people who were pretty dang
tough."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Division XII quarterfinal game Friday between top-seeded
Mammoth Lakes Mammoth (11-0) and rival Bishop (6-5) is set to become
the biggest sporting event in region history. It will be broadcast on
four radio stations and two TV stations.</TE>
<TE>   "We're expecting maybe 5,000 people," said Bishop Coach Bill Egan,
whose team will host the game. "If we get a crowd that big, it will
be the biggest crowd that's ever seen anything in this town except
for Mule Days."</TE>
<TE>   Mammoth, located 150 miles south of Reno and 200 miles north of
Lancaster, played before the largest crowd in school history, about
3,000, last Friday, scoring a 37-14 victory over Redlands Arrowhead
Christian.</TE>
<TE>   This week's game pits one of the Southland's leading rushers,
Bishop's Ralph Cataldo (2,238 yards, 32 touchdowns), against its
top-ranked passer, Mammoth's Juan Prieto (28 yards per completion, 15
touchdowns), and running back R.J. Flamson (1,376 yards, 19
touchdowns).</TE>
<TE>   Bishop holds a 21-4-1 record in head-to-head meetings, but Mammoth
has won three of the last five.</TE>
<TE>   "These are rugged individuals who live here -- fishermen and
hunters and snowboarders, skiers and rock climbers -- and this is the
first real team sport where the community has gotten excited about
it," said Egan, former coach of the U.S. men's ski team. "We have a
football frenzy at the moment, especially in Mammoth."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pomona's 21-7 victory over Garden Grove Rancho Alamitos at Ganesha
High in a Division IX first-round game was delayed 90 minutes
Saturday because there was no on-site doctor, a state requirement for
playoff games.</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff was delayed for the same reason for the Division I game
between Anaheim Servite and Rialto Eisenhower.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a team doctor, but unfortunately, he was out of town,"
Pomona Coach John Capraro said. "Rancho had a team doctor, but he was
out of town."</TE>
<TE>   At Eisenhower, the public address announcer asked if there were
any doctors in attendance. No one responded.</TE>
<TE>   Eisenhower Athletic Director Tom Hoak said the doctor got lost on
the way, but arrived at about 7:40 p.m. -- 10 minutes after the
scheduled kickoff.</TE>
<TE>   "The official was not going to allow us to play the game," Hoak
said. "He wanted to see the doctor face to face or he was going to
cancel the game."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Traveling goes hand in hand with the playoffs, but some top teams
will be on the road this week ... and then some.</TE>
<TE>   * Monrovia (11-0), the second-seeded team in Division X, will
travel 159 miles to play at Lompoc (8-3).</TE>
<TE>   * Mission Viejo, the top-seeded team in Division II, plays at
Canyon Country Canyon (10-1), an 82-mile trip.</TE>
<TE>   * Newhall Hart (9-2), the second-seeded team in Division II, has
to travel 62 miles to play Chino Hills Ayala (9-2).</TE>
<TE>   Higher-seeded teams host first-round games. After that, the home
team is determined by whichever team has hosted fewer games, or by
coin flip if both have hosted the same number.</TE>
<TE>   Championship games are at neutral sites. It is that way in all
section playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, we were the No. 2 seed and we played two of our three
games [before the championship] on the road," Hart Coach Mike
Herrington said. "I've got no complaints. I've been involved with
this so long, I don't even think about it anymore. It's just the way
it is."</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't have to be that way. School principals, who make up the
Southern Section Council, can change the rules.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's interest in changing the format and adjusting it to
where higher-seeded teams remained at home, or [other] options that
seem most fair, it's up to the membership to make those changes,"
said Rob Wigod, Southern Section assistant commissioner in charge of
football. "If they want to change it, it could be in place by next
year."</TE>

<HD>Taft Dominant in City Playoffs</HD>
<DH>Toreadors romp past Dorsey, 30-6, in avenging last season's
loss in title game and appear bound for a championship.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Stephens</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The path to the City Section football championship appears devoid of
challengers to unbeaten Woodland Hills Taft.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike last season, when the Toreadors lost the City title to
Dorsey on the last play of the game -- a blocked punt that was
recovered in the end zone as time ran out -- it doesn't appear
there's a team in the City that can stay close to Taft.</LD>
<LD>   The Toreadors (12-0) dispatched visiting Dorsey, 30-6, on
Wednesday in a City Championship quarterfinal game. Up next is
pass-happy Venice, which beat Roosevelt, 44-35.</LD>
<TE>   Taft beat West Valley League rival Lake Balboa Birmingham, 30-, in
the regular-season finale. The Patriots, who whipped Fairfax, 35-14,
in another quarterfinal, are favored to advance to the final from the
lower half of the draw.</TE>
<TE>   As much as Taft's coaches and players downplayed the matchup this
week, preparing for the Dons put the Toreadors on edge.</TE>
<TE>   "After suffering last year's loss we didn't even want to put
ourselves in that same position," senior wide receiver Steve Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Taft has used that experience to sharpen itself for another title
run. The Toreadors have reeled off 12 consecutive victories and have
rarely been tested along the way. Their core of skill players is
considered to be unmatched in the Southland.</TE>
<TE>   "They're as loaded as any team I've seen in the last few years,"
said Jefferson Coach Doi Johnson, whose Democrats knocked off
second-seeded Carson in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to stop Taft's offense is a daunting task. To wit:</TE>
<TE>   * If you try to double-cover wide receivers Steve Smith, the
reigning City Section player of the year, and fleet-footed Noah
Smith, how do you account for Paul Pratt over the middle?</TE>
<TE>   Steve Smith had the biggest offensive numbers Wednesday, catching
seven passes for 141 yards.</TE>
<TE>   * If you add extra defensive backs, are there enough linebackers
to stop tailbacks Ian Bell and Litrele Jones? Jones had the big night
Wednesday, rushing for 123 yards and a touchdown in 19 carries.</TE>
<TE>   * If you blitz quarterback Cary Dove, how do you keep from getting
burned by his quick release or scrambling ability? Dove completed 10
of 18 passes for 183 yards and touchdown. He also ran for a score.</TE>
<TE>   If you're lucky enough to slow down the Toreador offense, you
might have problems with their defense, which is led by Lance Broadus
at linebacker. Taft held Dorsey (5-7) to 175 yards and intercepted
four passes -- Pratt returned one 39 yards for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "We know defense wins championships," Taft Coach Troy Starr said.</TE>
<TE>   Banning Coach Ed Lalau considers the California-bound Dove a
better talent than Matt Moore, the former Newhall Hart and current
UCLA freshman quarterback. Dove threw for a career-high 389 yards
against the Pilots in Taft's 42-14 first-round victory.</TE>
<TE>   "He's one of the best quarterbacks I've seen in the City in the
last two decades," Lalau said. "He can run and he's got a great
release. And it helps that he has a great receiving corps to
complement him."</TE>

<HD>Shippers Could Share Hollywood Park Spotlight</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A pair of shippers are expected to make their presence felt in
today's holiday card at Hollywood Park.</LD>
<LD>   Julie Jalouse is the 5-2 favorite in the $70,000-added Waya
Handicap at 1 1/2 miles on the turf. The ungraded race is the fifth
on an eight-race card that has an early first post time of 11 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   After winning two of seven starts in Ireland, Julie Jalouse came
to the United States early in the year and won her first time out.
The chestnut filly, owned by Skymarc Farm, Inc. and trained by
Christophe Clement, got up to beat Sweetest Thing by a neck in the
Orchid Handicap, a Grade II, on March 24 at Gulfstream Park. Since
then, she has won once in three starts.</LD>
<TE>   All four of her career wins are at the Waya distance.</TE>
<TE>   Two races later, River Rush, another import, is the 2-1
morning-line choice against five older horses going a mile on the
turf. The 4-year-old gelded son of Strodes Creek comes west for owner
Gold Spur Stable and trainer Lisa Lewis with six wins in 17 career
starts.</TE>
<TE>   Races of the day: Well Fancied is among 10 scheduled to go six
furlongs in the $100,000 Fall Highweight Handicap at Aqueduct. At
Churchill Downs, Take Charge Lady seeks her sixth graded win of the
year in the $250,000 Falls City Handicap at 1 1/8 miles.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Eddie Martin Jr. The jockey, who won 120 races at last
season's Fair Grounds meet, is hoping to pick up today where he left
off as the Louisiana track opens an 85-day meet.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Jose Rivera Jr. The apprentice jockey won three of his
first 58 at Golden Gate Fields.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Two Four Dancer and
Candita in the fourth, Julie Jalouse and Garden in the Rain in the
fifth and Bel Air Belle, Starship Saratoga and Farah Love in the
sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/37. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $7.80/$204.20. Total money bet: $268.</TE>

<KH>Robyn Norwood ON COLLEGE BASKETBALL</KH>
<HD>It Could Be a First-Class Group</HD>

<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Now that Dajuan Wagner is a distant college basketball memory, it's
time for a look at this season's best freshmen.</LD>
<LD>   Some of them might even stick around for their sophomore years.</LD>
<LD>   No player has been a more dramatic surprise than Florida's Matt
Walsh, the latest disciple of the Jason Kapono-style white headband.</LD>
<TE>   No group of freshmen has been more impressive than the North
Carolina trio who led the upset of No. 2 Kansas on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Walsh figured to be a third wheel to freshman teammates Anthony
Roberson and Christian Drejer, but with Drejer's debut delayed by
injury, Walsh has made perhaps the most unexpected debut in the
country.</TE>
<TE>   An early-season top 10, in alphabetical order:</TE>
<TE>   Hassan Adams, Arizona -- The first basket of his career was a
rim-rattling one-handed dunk off a pass from Jason Gardner. Adams, a
guard from Westchester High, scored 22 points on nine-of-12 shooting
in 17 minutes off the bench in his debut for the No. 1 Wildcats in a
rout of Western Kentucky. Coach Lute Olson says Adams and his
roommate, Andre Iguodala, might be the best pair of wing players to
arrive at Arizona together.</TE>
<TE>   Carmelo Anthony, Syracuse -- He's a 6-foot-8 forward who averaged
27.5 points and 10.5 rebounds in his first two games. "He reminds me
of Billy Owens as a freshman," Coach Jim Boeheim said. "He's got a
chance to be real special. [But] like all freshmen, you worry about
the hype getting too much." Maybe you also worry how long he'll stay
in school.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Bosh, Georgia Tech -- Granted, it was against Arkansas Pine
Bluff, but who is to sneeze at a 26-point, 14-rebound performance
with 10 offensive rebounds? The 6-10 left-hander's debut was the best
by a Yellow Jacket since Kenny Anderson's 28-point debut against
Georgia State in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Raymond Felton, North Carolina -- The questions about whether
three freshmen could possibly bail out Coach Matt Doherty after a
hideous 8-20 season seem to be answered already. With Felton at the
point and averaging almost eight assists, North Carolina looks like
North Carolina again.</TE>
<TE>   Torin Francis, Notre Dame -- The team belongs to point guard Chris
Thomas, but it's hard to ignore the 20 rebounds Francis had against
Bucknell. He was much less of a factor in a loss to Creighton,
however.</TE>
<TE>   Rashad McCants, North Carolina -- He scored 28 points in his debut
as Felton's partner in the backcourt. No North Carolina player -- not
Michael Jordan, not James Worthy, not Vince Carter -- ever scored
more in his first game.</TE>
<TE>   Sean May, North Carolina -- You can't leave the son of Scott May
-- star of Indiana's unbeaten 1976 national championship team -- off
the list. Not when the beefy big man with the quick feet is averaging
close to a double-double in points and rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Shavlik Randolph, Duke -- Freshmen such as Randolph, a forward,
and guard J.J. Redick are part of the reason the Blue Devils can lose
Jason Williams, Mike Dunleavy and Carlos Boozer and still be in the
top 10. After two games, Randolph is averaging 20 points and 9.5
rebounds and has made 11 of 20 shots, and he and Redick are the Blue
Devils' leading scorers, just ahead of triple-double threat Chris
Duhon.</TE>
<TE>   Bracey Wright, Indiana -- This Texan didn't consider playing for
the former Indiana coach now residing in Lubbock, Texas. Instead, he
headed for Bloomington, where he is starting in the backcourt
alongside Tom Coverdale and Kyle Hornsby. A shooter and slasher, he
had 15 points in the Hoosiers' victory over Gonzaga and 21 against
Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   Walsh, Florida -- He shoots from all over the court, passes,
drives and has marvelous basketball sense. A 6-6 swingman, he had 26
points, five assists, four steals and three rebounds in his debut
against Louisiana Tech. "Crazy," he told the Orlando Sentinel. "I
mean, Dick Vitale? You see him on TV, then there you are, he's
interviewing you." Might happen a lot, from the looks of it.</TE>
<TE>   Shark Warning</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Tarkanian is retired, but Fresno State is in deepening
trouble with the NCAA in the aftermath of his seven seasons at the
school.</TE>
<TE>   The Fresno Bee reported this week that former player Tito Maddox
admitted accepting about $30,000 from a relative of Las Vegas sports
agent Ron Delpit during the 2000-2001 season.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the paper reported, former player Terrance Roberson
said he accepted several hundred dollars during the 1999-2000 season
from Nate Cebrun, a figure with ties to several college scandals who
was close to Tarkanian at Nevada Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Tarkanian, who retired after last season, told the Bee he was
"sick" and "heartbroken" about the reports, and said Maddox lied to
Fresno coaches when asked if he had accepted money.</TE>
<TE>   Among further incriminating evidence reported by the Bee was an
admission by Delpit's son-in-law, Baron Bower, that he repeatedly
gave envelopes from Delpit to Maddox that he "assumed" contained
cash. Delpit denied the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   In the case involving Roberson, the Bee reported records show
agent Robert Walsh's name and signature on pass lists compiled by the
Fresno coaching staff during the 1999-2000 season. Cebrun told the
Bee the money he gave Roberson came from Walsh.</TE>
<TE>   Cebrun, who said he occasionally rode the Fresno State team bus,
earlier purchased a UNLV championship ring after the Rebels won the
1990 NCAA title.</TE>
<TE>   He also was involved in the illegal payment of $2,500 to former
Auburn star Chris Porter when Porter was an NBA prospect. Cebrun was
convicted for his involvement in the 1993 Florida State football
scandal.</TE>
<TE>   "We took every effort we could to monitor the players," Tarkanian,
who no longer is close to Cebrun, told the Bee. "We had institutional
control."</TE>
<TE>   In any case, because of the legacy of the Tarkanian era, new
Fresno State Coach Ray Lopes, formerly Kelvin Sampson's top assistant
at Oklahoma, appears poised to endure probation.</TE>
<TE>   Around the Rim</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi State's status as a Top 25 team depends on an NCAA
decision expected next week on the eligibility of center Mario
Austin. Austin is being held out as the NCAA reviews his high school
academic record after saying Austin, a junior, mistakenly was ruled
eligible as a freshman. Without him, Mississippi State is 1-1,
including a loss to Louisiana Lafayette. An attorney for Austin --
who briefly declared for the NBA draft after last season before
returning to school -- said he is prepared to sue the NCAA if Austin
is ruled ineligible.... Among other teams that might be hard-pressed
to live up to preseason expectations: Western Kentucky. Seven-footer
Chris Marcus still is recovering from off-season foot surgery.
Although the Hilltoppers played well without Marcus when he was
injured last season, they suffered another blow during a
season-opening 107-68 loss to Arizona when starting forward Todor
Pandov was lost for the season after suffering a knee injury.... More
mid-major blues: Ball State senior Theron Smith, best remembered for
leading the upsets of Kansas and UCLA last season, is seeking a
medical redshirt season because of continuing tendinitis after major
knee surgery. He will not play this season.</TE>

<LD>UNITED NATIONS -- After a four-year absence, international inspectors
resumed their search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq on
Wednesday, and a U.N. team leader in the field called the initial
cooperation by Iraqi authorities "a good sign."</LD>
<LD>   But even as the inspections began without incident, the Bush
administration shifted its war planning into high gear. A senior
administration official said Wednesday that the White House will
dispatch a handful of key envoys across the globe over the next few
weeks to close deals with potential allies in a possible war with
Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz leaves Sunday on the
first mission in the new campaign to build a war coalition prepared
to act if Iraq fails to satisfy the inspectors that it has
surrendered its suspected arsenal. Wolfowitz is scheduled to visit
NATO headquarters near Brussels, as well as Britain and Turkey. The
administration plans additional trips to potential allies in Russia,
East Asia, South Asia and Iraq's neighbors in the Middle East and
Persian Gulf.</LD>
<TE>   The high-level diplomatic effort underscores the administration's
determination to be ready to rapidly attack if Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein fails to cooperate with the weapons inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   The first day of inspections appeared to go smoothly. The 17
monitors who began their work Wednesday were divided into two groups,
with six inspectors concentrating on potential nuclear sites and 11
on possible biological or chemical weapons-related complexes.</TE>
<TE>   In Baghdad, Jacques Baute -- leader of inspectors from the
International Atomic Energy Agency, the team in charge of nuclear
arms -- said: "We have not sensed anything which obstructed us. We
were welcomed in a polite and professional manner, and we were able
to do the job."</TE>
<TE>   Baute's team spent three hours at Al Tahadi, a scientific research
center in northern Baghdad, which Iraqi officials said manufactures
motors and has never been part of the nation's nuclear program.</TE>
<TE>   The other group of inspectors, a convoy of United Nations
monitors, visited a military-run graphite plant and an adjacent
missile-testing facility at the Al Rafah science research center, 15
miles southwest of Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   Military guards quickly opened the gate to the compound, and the
inspectors disappeared inside. They emerged about five hours later to
say only that they had been granted immediate access.</TE>
<TE>   The sites selected Wednesday had been scrutinized during
inspections years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "It went according to plans altogether," chief U.N. inspector Hans
Blix said at the world body's headquarters in New York after
receiving reports from staff members conducting the searches. "We are
on a firm path forward."</TE>
<TE>   Promising more inspections "in all shapes and forms," Blix
emphasized the surprise nature of the searches: "We aren't telling
anyone in advance where we are going."</TE>
<TE>   Early today, four cars carrying inspectors left the monitors'
headquarters in Baghdad to begin a second day of work at an
undisclosed location.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. resolution passed unanimously by the Security Council on
Nov. 8 authorizes the inspectors to go anywhere at any time. The
resolution includes a series of deadlines, and an important one comes
Dec. 8, when Baghdad must declare any weapons of mass destruction. By
Jan. 27, the inspectors are required to issue their first report to
the Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   In Paris on Wednesday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan told
Europe 1 radio that "the only way to avoid a military conflict" is
for Iraq to cooperate with the searches.</TE>
<TE>   He added, "I do not believe war is inevitable."</TE>
<TE>   The United States, however, is continuing to prepare for war. The
diplomatic effort that begins this weekend ratchets up conversations
the administration has already initiated with potential allies,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a natural extension of the process" that began with
sending cables to U.S. embassies two weeks ago, asking what help the
administration could expect from their host countries, a senior State
Department official said Wednesday. That process continued with
President Bush's approaches to European allies at last week's North
Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in the Czech Republic, the
official said.</TE>
<TE>   "We know from 12 years of dealing with Saddam Hussein that the
best way to avoid armed conflict -- perhaps the only way -- is to
keep the pressure up," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey is the most important stop on Wolfowitz's schedule.
Pentagon planners believe they need only limited military support
from well-trained forces in nations such as Britain but seek as broad
a coalition as possible, the senior administration official said.</TE>
<TE>   The new campaign is aimed largely at uncommitted but potentially
crucial allies -- such as Turkey -- who could supply basing and
overflight rights and at those who could help in peacekeeping and
other postwar tasks.</TE>
<TE>   The 15-0 vote in the Security Council requiring Iraq to disarm
"was much more than [U.S. officials] hoped for," said Edward B.
Atkeson, a former Army and CIA intelligence official who is now a
NATO expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies,
a Washington policy institute. "I imagine they thought, 'Who else is
interested?' "</TE>
<TE>   Many nations have already pledged support in the event of war, the
administration official said, but some have suggested that they would
back an invasion only under the auspices of the United Nations .</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials who are expected to make the journeys
include Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage; Marc Grossman,
undersecretary of State for political affairs; Deputy National
Security Advisor Stephen Hadley; and Douglas J. Feith, undersecretary
of Defense for policy.</TE>
<TE>   Wolfowitz's visit to Turkey comes when the nation stands at a
significant juncture. It is both looking westward, aspiring to join
the European Union, and adjusting to the governance of the newly
elected Justice and Development Party, which has strong Islamic
roots.</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration envoys have in recent months lobbied Turkish
President Ahmet Necdet Sezer, the military and others within the
secular government's bureaucracy. They now must make their case with
the new government.</TE>
<TE>   That government has promised to maintain close ties to the West
but is expected to face intense pressure not to join non-Muslims in a
war against Iraq. Turkish officials are particularly concerned that
after a war, the Kurdish-dominated northern portion of Iraq would
become an independent Kurdistan, possibly fomenting unrest among
Turkish Kurds across the border. Previous envoys have assured the
Turks that the U.S. opposes an independent Kurdish nation.</TE>
<TE>   During his visit to the Turkish capital, Ankara, Wolfowitz is
expected to argue that Turkey would make political, security and
economic gains after Hussein was toppled. Turkey, whose new
government came to power promising to lift the nation out of its
recession, holds a natural advantage in trading with Iraq if U.N.
sanctions against Iraq are lifted.</TE>
<TE>   Wolfowitz is also expected to discuss how and when the United
States and Turkey can decide on an alliance against Iraq. At the very
least, he will be looking to secure U.S. access to Turkish bases at
Incirlik and elsewhere. The U.S. and Britain are already using
Turkish bases to patrol the "no-fly" zone over northern Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "We depend very, very heavily on the bases there -- and we've got
to make sure that they're with us in this in all respects," Atkeson
said. "We don't know whether we'll have Saudi Arabia or not, and you
can't put everything in Kuwait."</TE>
<TE>   Patrols in the no-fly zones over northern and southern Iraq
appeared to have come under increasing fire in recent weeks as the
inspections neared.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, an air raid siren sounded several hours after the
initial inspections, as a vapor trail from what Iraqi officials
called "a hostile flight" was seen over Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not a coalition aircraft. It was not a U.N. aircraft,"
said Lt. Col. Dave Lapan, a Pentagon spokesman. "It seems strange
that a hostile aircraft would fly over Baghdad and they would not
shoot at it."</TE>
<TE>   At times, the first day's inspections resembled a movie chase as
about 100 journalists in cars pursued the monitors, who were in
convoys of white U.N. vehicles along with escorts from Iraq's
National Monitoring Directorate.</TE>
<TE>   Two press cars bumped into each other, and at one point a massive
traffic jam occurred as police held back ordinary drivers to allow
the convoys to proceed.</TE>
<TE>   After the inspections at the graphite site, Dimitri Perricos, the
U.N. team leader, said graphite could be used to make pencils as well
as missile batteries and the cone of a missile.</TE>
<TE>   In October, the CIA, citing analysis of satellite photos, charged
that Iraq was erecting a large test stand for prohibited long-range
missiles at the missile-testing facility.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein's government countered that the structure was designed
only for the engines of shorter-range missiles, which are permitted
under U.N. arms control resolutions.</TE>
<TE>   Perricos said his team discovered that monitoring equipment
previously placed at Al Rafah had been taken away or destroyed. He
said the instruments still intact would be collected and examined .</TE>
<TE>   Plans call for about 100 inspectors to be ready to work in Iraq by
Christmas. Blix said an additional training course was scheduled in
January that could increase to 300 the number of available arms
control experts.</TE>
<TE>   The events Wednesday constituted a significant new chapter in what
has been a difficult, dangerous and often frustrating effort that
began in April 1991 when the Security Council established a special
commission to search for and destroy Iraq's most deadly armaments.</TE>
<TE>   That month, Iraq's foreign minister sent a letter to U.N.
headquarters stating that the country possessed no forbidden nuclear
items and no biological weapons. It listed some chemical munitions
and a limited arsenal of Scud missiles.</TE>
<TE>   The initial letter quickly proved to be false. But more than 11
years later, the question of the full extent of Iraq's stockpile
remains to be resolved.</TE>

<HD>Drop in Interest Rates Hits Retirees in the Pocketbook</HD>
<DH>Older Americans' income plunges as yields fall on bank CDs
and money market accounts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kathy M. Kristof and Tom Petruno</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kenneth Jarosch fired his lawn service and canceled his magazine
subscriptions. He and his wife are such avid users of grocery coupons
that the store pays them to shop, he jokes.</LD>
<LD>   But still, the 60-year-old retiree is worried about his financial
future. And it's because of the same plunge in interest rates that
has many younger Americans cheering.</LD>
<LD>   The decline in rates to 40-year lows, a drive engineered by the
Federal Reserve, has made mortgages and car loans cheap for
consumers.</LD>
<TE>   On the other side of the equation are people such as Jarosch.
Their income has been slashed over the last two years as yields have
tumbled on bank savings certificates and other conservative accounts
favored by retirees.</TE>
<TE>   The average yield on money market mutual funds this week fell
below 1% for the first time since the funds were created in the early
1970s. Two years ago the funds were paying 6%.</TE>
<TE>   Unless savings rates head back up soon -- which many experts
consider unlikely -- Jarosch said he will have to start tapping his
principal to pay living expenses.</TE>
<TE>   "We have cut expenses to the bone. Absolutely everything that's
not essential has had to go," said Jarosch, who lives in St. Paul,
Minn. "But we have nowhere to hide. Instead of living off cash flow,
I will have to dig into savings."</TE>
<TE>   Older Americans have faced low interest rates before, but not
since the late 1950s have yields on basic savings instruments been so
low. For most of the 46 million Americans age 60 or older -- many of
whom live on fixed incomes -- the paltry rates available on bank CDs,
money funds and similar accounts are unprecedented.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, savings and investment returns have been poor for more
than just older people in recent years. The stock market's decline
since March 2000 has wiped out trillions of dollars of small
investors' wealth.</TE>
<TE>   The difference is that younger people may have time to make up
lost savings. For many retirees, the nest egg they have now must last
as long as they live. And some say the deep decline in savings rates
is threatening to systematically impoverish them.</TE>
<TE>   "The reduction in interest income is affecting the way I have to
spend and think, because it means I have to get into the principal
that's generating the income," said Jim Daugherty, a retired
aeronautical engineer in Memphis, Tenn. "That defeats itself. The
more you reduce your savings, the more you reduce your income. It
becomes a vicious cycle of your expenses eating up your savings."</TE>
<TE>   At age 82, Daugherty said he's not too worried about outliving his
money as long as he continues to live frugally. "But if I were age
65, I'd be mightily concerned."</TE>
<TE>   Younger retirees, such as Bob Ring of Laguna Woods, say they see
few options but to cut back on spending. Ring, 69, says he used to go
to sporting events several times a year and he and his wife normally
plan a big vacation once every three years. This year, he hasn't gone
to any sporting events and the trip to Australia that he's been
pining for since 2000 has been indefinitely tabled.</TE>
<TE>   "When I know that income and outgo are running awfully close or
negative, the first thing that gets cut are the luxuries," Ring said.
"Give us another year of this, and the cuts are going to start
getting noticeable."</TE>
<TE>   The financial reality for many seniors is at odds with the Federal
Reserve's basic goal in pulling shorter-term interest rates down to
current levels: The central bank is trying to help the economy, not
hurt it.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed, under Chairman Alan Greenspan, began slashing the cost of
money early in 2001 as the economy slumped into the first recession
since 1990.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed controls short-term interest rates by pumping money into
the banking system or by removing it. By lowering borrowing costs,
the Fed has sought to keep the recession from snowballing.</TE>
<TE>   Even as the economy has recovered this year the central bank has
kept rates down, and it cut them again Nov. 6. With the stock market
suffering its worst losses since the 1930s, the Fed has feared that
the decline could tip the economy back into recession, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   But "had there been no interest rate cuts, the economy would be
better off," groused octogenarian Frank Brier of Philadelphia.
"Millions and millions of people with bank accounts, CDs, annuities,
bonds and other interest-bearing vehicles would have more money to
spend."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the sum in bank CDs and basic savings accounts totals $3.6
trillion, according to Fed data. Small investors have $900 billion in
money market mutual funds. The total of those accounts far exceeds
the $2.7 trillion in stock mutual funds.</TE>
<TE>   "When the Fed is lowering rates, it is hurting the people who lend
and helping the people who borrow," said Alan Blinder, a Princeton
University professor and former Fed vice chairman. "The Fed knows
that. But basically, that's the only weapon they've got" to fight a
recession, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The central bank also understands another financial reality: The
U.S. economy is far more dependent on the spending of younger and
middle-aged people than older people.</TE>
<TE>   The average household headed by 65-to-74-year-olds spends $30,800
a year, according to a government survey in 2000. But that pales
compared with the $45,150 average of households headed by people 35
to 44, said Susan Sterne, head of Economic Analysis Associates in
Greenwich, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   People 65 and older account for 14% of spending in the economy,
Sterne said. "They are a very small share of total consumer
spending," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Some economists also point out that although short-term interest
rates are extremely low in nominal terms, the situation for many
savers was worse in the 1970s because inflation was far higher --
eating up savers' purchasing power.</TE>
<TE>   But many seniors say their personal inflation rates today don't
jibe with the government's statistics that say the rate of inflation
is about 2%. Rising living costs compound the pain of the drop in
interest earned on savings instruments, they say.</TE>
<TE>   "Our biggest problem has been the rise in medical insurance
premiums," said Lonell Spencer of Arcadia, a retired machinist.
"Three years ago, we paid $107 a month. Last year, our premium went
to $191. This year it went to $602 and next year they said they won't
cover us at all."</TE>
<TE>   Jarosch said his medical insurance premiums have jumped nearly 53%
this year, his property taxes are up 16% and his homeowner's
insurance premiums have risen 47%.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, his money market account interest income is down 85%
over the last two years, and his pension and Social Security income
has risen by less than 2% over the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the economy is showing signs of picking up steam, many
economists believe the Fed will be reluctant to raise short-term
interest rates until well into 2003, for fear of stalling the
recovery. That was the Fed's pattern in 1992 and 1993: It kept rates
low for most of that period, waiting for the economy to rebound
decisively.</TE>
<TE>   "I think these low rates are going to persist for a while,"
Blinder said.</TE>
<TE>   That prospect offers little hope to savers who had planned on the
yields of a few years ago continuing indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   For those who seek to boost their income from savings or
investments, the choices are difficult. The only way to get a better
return is to take more risk -- for example, by investing in the stock
market or in corporate bonds.</TE>
<TE>   But for someone like Jarosch, "the problem is that the risk level
that he would have to reach to meet his income requirements would
probably not be prudent given his age," said Christopher Orndorff,
portfolio manager at Payden &amp; Rygel, a Los Angeles investment firm.</TE>
<TE>   Some financial advisors say it's almost imperative that retirees
with a long time horizon have at least a modest portion of their
assets in stocks, which over periods of decades still are expected to
produce the highest returns of all financial assets.</TE>
<TE>   Retirees "naturally are very gun-shy of having any risk in their
portfolios," said Steve Norwitz, an officer at mutual fund giant T.
Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore. "But the risk of running out of
money if you have a long time horizon can be greater than the risk of
having another down year in the market."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Norwitz acknowledged that it's tough to sell that message
to many Americans, including retirees, given the stock market's
losses of the last 2 1/2 years.</TE>
<TE>   "You tell this to somebody who has lost 40% of their account value
over the past two years, and they say, 'Yeah, right. Let's stack your
graph against my recent account statement and see what's more
convincing.' "</TE>

<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>The dean of UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall, one of the nation's top law
schools, said Wednesday that he would resign from the university
because of a sexual harassment allegation lodged by a former student.</LD>
<LD>   John P. Dwyer, Boalt's dean since July 2000, announced his
resignation in a letter to faculty, staff and students, surprising
many of them as they prepared to leave for Thanksgiving.</LD>
<LD>   In the letter, Dwyer said he and the female student, "had a single
encounter two years ago that was consensual, but there is no
allegation that any form of sexual intercourse occurred. Nonetheless,
I acknowledge that this reflected a serious error in judgment on my
part and was inappropriate."</LD>
<TE>   Dwyer said that the woman who filed the complaint was never a
student in his classroom. The woman, who has graduated from the
school, filed her complaint Oct. 11, university officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The episode throws a harsh light on the problem of improper sexual
encounters between faculty and students on university campuses, which
many experts believe take place far more often than is reported.</TE>
<TE>   The incident also derails the academic career of Dwyer, 50, an
environmental law expert and a popular dean who had shown enormous
promise since early in his career. Dwyer, who is divorced, graduated
from Boalt in 1980 and was only the second graduate of the school to
serve as its dean in its 108-year history. His resignation as dean
takes effect Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   University spokeswoman Janet Gilmore said the university began an
internal investigation immediately after the former student filed her
complaint. Gilmore said the probe is continuing and confirmed that it
focuses on a single encounter. She declined to provide further
details, saying that the matter is confidential.</TE>
<TE>   At some universities, any sexual relationship between a faculty
member and a student is forbidden on the grounds that the difference
in power and status between the two people can lead to exploitation
even if the relationship begins consensually.</TE>
<TE>   UC Berkeley's policies are apparently less specific, and officials
Wednesday were unable to say precisely how they applied in Dwyer's
case.</TE>
<TE>   The campus' sexual harassment policy has a 90-day limit for filing
complaints, which faculty members say may have prevented its
application. The university's code of conduct for teachers, which
faculty members said has a three-year statute of limitations,
requires professors to "avoid any exploitation, harassment or
discriminatory treatment of students." In addition, it bars
discrimination against students for reasons related to sex, sexual
orientation and other areas covered by civil rights law.</TE>
<TE>   UC Berkeley Chancellor Robert M. Berdahl declined to be
interviewed about the matter, and Dwyer did not return phone calls
left at his office and home.</TE>
<TE>   Sexual harassment allegations are becoming more common on
university campuses, partly because of poor training of staff and
faculty, said Jan Salisbury, a consultant and researcher who advises
universities and other organizations on sexual harassment issues.</TE>
<TE>   "Most colleges and universities lag far behind workplaces in the
way they prevent and resolve harassment and discrimination
complaints," she said, adding that faculty members usually aren't
required to receive training to handle potential sexual harassment
issues. That is changing at some universities as court decisions over
the last two decades have expanded the scope of sexual harassment law
and led to a spate of judgments against schools and other employers.</TE>
<TE>   Salisbury saw little irony in a law school dean being accused of
sexual harassment, saying, "These issues aren't about somebody
understanding the law. That's a small part of it. It's about
understanding power" and gender dynamics. Managing those kinds of
gender issues, she said, "isn't taught in law school."</TE>
<TE>   At Boalt, faculty and students seemed surprised by Dwyer's letter;
the incident and investigation had been kept quiet even within the
law school.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks to me like it happened overnight," said Jan Vetter,
associate dean at Boalt.</TE>
<TE>   Some faculty and students expressed dismay that a single
encounter--one that occurred two years ago with a student who wasn't
in a class taught by Dwyer--would lead to the dean's resignation.</TE>
<TE>   "What you have here maybe is the university leaning over backward
to be politically correct," said Stephen Barnett, a professor at
Boalt Hall for 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Ironically, one of the things [Dwyer] has been doing well at is
healing some of the gender divisions on the faculty, building bridges
between the men and women."</TE>
<TE>   Boalt professors widely praised Dwyer's performance as dean.
"Everyone I have talked to really feels sadness and shock," said
Charles D. Weisselberg, a Boalt professor who runs the school's
clinical education programs. "It feels really raw. It came completely
out of left field."</TE>
<TE>   Students were generally complimentary of Dwyer. ''He seemed like a
good dean, and he was successful at fund-raising," said second-year
student Stephanie Pham-Quang, 26. "But he's a suave guy. Everyone
compares him to Clinton."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Recchia, 30, a second-year Boalt student, questioned why
Dwyer would resign for "a single sexual indiscretion."</TE>
<TE>   "It's graduate school. It's not high school," Recchia said.
"Everyone is 21 years or older. It's not like they're little girls
who are fawning over him."</TE>
<TE>   Second-year student Gabrielle Raymond, 23, characterized Dwyer as
committed to the students and to a variety of causes, including the
International Human Rights Law Clinic that Raymond participates in.
The clinic represents refugees seeking asylum and other rights law
cases.</TE>
<TE>   Dwyer's career until now had been successful. He graduated Phi
Beta Kappa from DePauw University in Indiana and then earned his PhD
in chemical physics at Caltech before heading to Boalt.</TE>
<TE>   He was a standout student, which led to prestigious clerkships
with Judge Harry T. Edwards on the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Washington and then with Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.
He worked as a public defender in Washington, D.C., for two years and
returned to Boalt in 1984. He taught environmental law, energy law
and property law. In 1992, he became associate dean for academic
affairs. In 1997, he received the law school's Rutter Award for
Excellence in Teaching.</TE>

<HD>Kissinger to Lead 9/11 Inquiry</HD>
<DH>He is given a mandate to 'uncover every detail.' George
Mitchell is named vice chairman.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Gerstenzang</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Wednesday named Henry A. Kissinger the chairman of
an independent commission that will investigate last year's terrorist
attacks, giving one of America's most famed diplomats a broad mandate
to probe the deadliest assault on American soil.</LD>
<LD>   "His investigation should carefully examine all the evidence and
follow all the facts, wherever they may lead," Bush said in making
the announcement. "We must uncover every detail and learn every
lesson of Sept. 11."</LD>
<LD>   Congressional Democrats named former Senate Majority Leader George
J. Mitchell, a Maine Democrat, to be the vice chairman of the
10-member National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United
States.</LD>
<TE>   Kissinger, 79, is a controversial figure rooted in the nation's
foreign-policy establishment for more than three decades. A Nobel
laureate, he brings to the panel extensive experience in national
security issues as well as personal distance from the events the
panel will investigate.</TE>
<TE>   He pledged that the commission would not be "restricted by any
foreign-policy considerations."</TE>
<TE>   This was a reference, only slightly veiled, to the risk that the
investigation could turn up information embarrassing to the
administration and its allies. Saudi Arabia, for instance, has been
buffeted by questions about possible financial links between its
government officials and the Sept. 11 hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   Kissinger has long been a lightning rod for critics of U.S.
foreign policy, reaching back to his service as national security
advisor and secretary of State during the Nixon and Ford
administrations. His background caused some to question whether the
commission's work would remain independent of the administration and
whether its findings would be credible.</TE>
<TE>   Kissinger was President Nixon's key foreign-policy aide during the
secret bombing of Cambodia and the U.S.-backed coup that overthrew
Salvador Allende, Chile's leftist president.</TE>
<TE>   Referring to questions about Kissinger's role in both events,
Steven Aftergood, who oversees a project on government secrecy at the
Federation of American Scientists, said: "He has no shortage of
secrets of his own, and therefore seems like an unlikely candidate to
be uncovering the secrets of this investigation."</TE>
<TE>   Aftergood questioned whether Kissinger would be willing to support
issuing subpoenas for members of the president's staff to obtain
information that they did not want to reveal. This is relevant
because one of the key questions about the period leading up to the
attacks is what warning, if any, Bush had received about a threat.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), a leading sponsor of the
legislation creating the commission, said he expected that the panel
would question the president.</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Bush does not
envision testifying.</TE>
<TE>   Kissinger was noncommittal on that issue, saying, "One doesn't
start with the president of the United States, and so I don't want to
make a judgment until we have all the facts, until we have other
commissioners."</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Lake, who served as President Clinton's national security
advisor and who worked on Kissinger's staff before parting company
with him over the 1970 invasion of Cambodia, praised the selection.</TE>
<TE>   "He will do a serious job," Lake said. "He has great experience.
He has been a consumer of intelligence but never a part of the
intelligence community, and he hasn't been a participant in recent
administrations, so he may have a degree of separation that may be
useful."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), another key supporter of the panel,
said Kissinger's "depth of experience and broad knowledge of both
intelligence and government will undoubtedly help to achieve the
commission's objectives."</TE>
<TE>   Kissinger's selection generated some surprise in Washington,
partly because he has not had a prominent government post since
President Ford left office in 1977 and partly because he has not been
closely linked to Bush.</TE>
<TE>   But Robert F. Ellsworth, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO, noted
that Kissinger was close to Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld,
whose office as Ford's White House chief of staff was a few paces
down from Kissinger's suite.</TE>
<TE>   Ellsworth said Kissinger shares Rumsfeld's views on the need to
overhaul the nation's intelligence operations -- likely to be a
central focus of the inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to reporters outside the White House, Kissinger said the
commission's recommendations would "contribute to the safety of
America, to the future of America and to the avoidance of any future
tragedies."</TE>
<TE>   Bush, he said, "has said publicly, and he has told me privately,
that he has every intention to carry out the recommendations of the
commission."</TE>
<TE>   Although best-known since he left government for his extensive
writings on foreign affairs, Kissinger also has been a consultant to
businesses operating overseas.</TE>
<TE>   A White House spokesman said it was unclear whether he would be
required to disclose personal financial information that senior
government appointees make public.</TE>
<TE>   In public remarks and writings since the Sept. 11 attacks,
Kissinger has called on the nation to examine the work of the
intelligence agencies, to determine whether they missed details that
could have signaled an attack. But he has also warned against
excessive oversight.</TE>
<TE>   Writing in The Times three days after the attack, he said, "There
should be an initial sweeping review of intelligence procedures and
organization."</TE>
<TE>   But a week later, he said in a speech in Sacramento: "What we
should remember is that we have been harassing our intelligence
agencies for the last 20 years, at least, and submitted them to
endless inquiries."</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell, 69, served as a diplomatic troubleshooter for Clinton
after he gave up his Senate seat in 1994. He sought to broker peace
in the Middle East and played a key role in negotiations that
produced the 1998 Good Friday peace accord in Northern Ireland.</TE>
<TE>   The panel has been given responsibilities similar to commissions
that investigated the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 and the
assassination of President Kennedy in 1963.</TE>
<TE>   A joint congressional committee quickly launched a probe of
intelligence lapses leading up to the Sept. 11 attacks. But both
lawmakers and relatives of victims of the attacks pushed for the
independent commission, arguing that it would not be as limited as
the congressional inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration initially opposed the idea, saying it
feared the panel could distract and demoralize intelligence officials
working to prevent another terrorist assault. But as the
congressional committees unearthed more and more examples of
intelligence lapses, the administration reversed its stance.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the panel's existence was not resolved until the final days
of the congressional session that ended last week, when differences
between Republicans and Democrats over how the panel members would be
appointed were resolved.</TE>
<TE>   Under the compromise, the commission will be made up of five
Democrats and five Republicans. It will be empowered to issue
subpoenas upon agreement of the chairman and vice chairman or a
majority of the members. Lawmakers have until Dec. 15 to name the
other eight members.</TE>
<TE>   Along with intelligence failures by government agencies, the panel
will look into such areas as funding of terrorist networks,
diplomacy, immigration policies and aviation security.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said the Kissinger panel would build on the work of the joint
congressional inquiry. That investigation found poor communication
between the FBI and CIA in tracking terrorist threats.</TE>
<TE>   Bush announced his choice of Kissinger as he signed legislation
creating the panel and authorizing annual spending for the nation's
intelligence agencies. Moments later, the president left the White
House to spend the Thanksgiving holiday at his ranch outside of
Crawford, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said he hoped the commission would work quickly, issuing its
report before the 18-month deadline specified by the legislation
creating it.</TE>
<TE>   "The sooner we have the commission's conclusions, the sooner this
administration will act on them," the president said.</TE>

<HD>Storm of Bad Economic News Slams N.Y.</HD>
<DH>Tax hikes, potential bond rating drop remind many of 'bad
old days' of 1975.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Getlin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>As the first blast of wintery weather hit Wednesday, bringing rain
and slush, New Yorkers were already grappling with a different kind
of gloom.</LD>
<LD>   Just in time for the holidays, the city has been rocked by a
blizzard of bad economic news, ranging from the biggest property tax
increase in New York's history, to stories about growing homelessness
and the threat of a crippling subway shutdown.</LD>
<LD>   The long-range forecast is for even chillier conditions, with the
promise of more tax hikes, painful service cutbacks -- such as public
schools, day care and senior centers -- and the possibility that the
city's bond rating might be downgraded.</LD>
<TE>   "It sure seems like the bad old days are coming back," said office
clerk Anita Thompson, hurrying to catch a train out of town for the
Thanksgiving holiday. "Everywhere you turn, there doesn't seem to be
much good news about New York."</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in seven years, a majority of New Yorkers have
a decidedly downbeat view about their city's future, according to a
Quinnipiac Poll released this week. More than 54% said they are
dissatisfied with life here, and pollster Maurice Carroll, director
of the survey, suggests it's easy to understand why.</TE>
<TE>   "The honeymoon is over," he said, referring both to plunging
ratings for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg as well as the $6-billion
budget deficit projected for next year. "When you combine tax
increases with so much other bad economic news, people begin to get
very unhappy, and the whole tone of the city can begin to change."</TE>
<TE>   New York's fiscal problems mirror those of other cities and
states, which are also struggling to plug record deficits. But the
troubles plaguing the nation's largest city are heightened by the
lingering effect of last year's terrorist attacks and the fact that
20 months ago the economic outlook was so sunny.</TE>
<TE>   Under former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, New York enjoyed a
renaissance of economic growth, surging Wall Street profits and a
plunge in the crime rate that outstripped all other big cities.</TE>
<TE>   Crime is still down, but as the economy sours, so has the mood of
New Yorkers who wonder if these bad times presage a return to the
dark days of 1975, when the city flirted with bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   For most residents, the most recent spate of bad news began last
weekend, when Bloomberg reached a deal with the City Council to hike
property taxes 18.5%. The increase will take effect Jan. 1, and it is
part of a plan to help close a $1-billion budget gap in the fiscal
year ending June 30. The mayor has warned that additional tax
increases might follow if the city does not get help from Albany and
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   New York's deficit was caused by the terrorist attacks -- which
either ruined or drove many taxpaying businesses out of the city --
as well as a major downturn in the national economy and setbacks
suffered by Wall Street firms, which traditionally generate fat tax
revenues. Although the federal government has earmarked $20 billion
in aid to New York, the money is intended mainly for the physical
reconstruction of Lower Manhattan and has little to do directly with
boosting the city's fiscal condition.</TE>
<TE>   To balance the budget, as required by law, Bloomberg opted for tax
hikes instead of layoffs and huge reductions in programs. "New
Yorkers won't leave town due to a tax increase," the mayor said,
defending the property tax hike he once opposed. "But they will if
services are cut."</TE>
<TE>   The city can raise property taxes on its own, but the balance of
Bloomberg's bailout plan hinges on legislative proposals that may not
pass. Given such uncertainty, the credit-rating agency Standard &amp;
Poor's said it might downgrade the city's bond rating, which would
make borrowing costlier.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg, for example, has asked legislators to reinstate a city
tax on suburban commuters. Upstate officials have said that measure
would be "dead on arrival." He has asked state leaders to take over
the city's $4-billion annual share of Medicaid costs, an idea that
has also been dismissed. Failing that, Bloomberg says New Yorkers may
have to prepare for an increase in city income tax rates.</TE>
<TE>   "No way!" said Rich O'Leary, a deliveryman fighting his way up
Manhattan's 6th Avenue on a bike. "There's just so much pain that
this city can take."</TE>
<TE>   For months, the city's doomsday economic scenarios have seemed
like abstract threats to many New Yorkers. But now that the property
tax hike is real, everyday residents are beginning to feel the pain.
Homeowners are looking at an average rise of $500 to $800 in annual
payments; the increase could be closer to $1,000 for condominium and
co-op owners, according to city statistics. Meanwhile, renters are
bracing for hefty increases passed on by landlords.</TE>
<TE>   "I really didn't expect anything like this," said literary agent
Lisa Queen, who recently purchased an expensive co-op on Manhattan's
Upper West Side, spent thousands of dollars refurbishing the unit --
and now is looking at a huge tax increase. "You make a lot of
[economic] plans for your family, you plan ahead, but this tax
increase is bad news for a lot of people."</TE>
<TE>   As Queen stood on Broadway, hailing a cab to take her downtown,
Amereles Rosario wandered through the basement kitchen of the Church
of St. Paul and St. Andrew a block away, eyeing shelves of groceries
in one of the city's largest food pantries. The West Side Campaign
Against Hunger allows people like Rosario to pick out food, instead
of pre-prepared bags of groceries, but the city's stunning growth in
homelessness and hunger has strained the agency's resources.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people think that, around the holidays, hunger is just a
quaint part of the New York City landscape, like the Hudson River or
the rocks in Central Park," said Joel Berg, of the Coalition Against
Hunger. "But this is the richest city on Earth, and the fact that so
many people don't get enough food here is an outrage."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, more than 350,000 people were turned away from New
York's estimated 1,000 kitchens and pantries for the poor, Berg said
-- an increase of 45% over two years earlier. Most of the increase
has come from working families teetering on the edge of homelessness
as employment conditions worsen, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rosario, a mother of two, lost her longtime baby-sitting job
several months ago, and she has had to fend for her family in city
shelters when she can't stay with friends. Through a translator, she
said it's getting more difficult for her to make ends meet -- or make
any long-range economic plans.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot more of us on the streets now," she said,
referring to the city's homeless population, which is estimated to be
37,000, an all-time high.</TE>
<TE>   Rosario's sense of gloom may soon spread to the subways and buses
used by millions of New Yorkers. The Metropolitan Transportation
Authority has said that a basic-fare increase from $1.50 to $2 is a
virtual certainty, given the agency's budgetary squeeze and city
officials' refusal to cut back daily services.</TE>
<TE>   As if that weren't bad enough, Transportation Workers Union
representatives now speak openly of striking by Dec. 15. The mayor
has warned that such a walkout would be a catastrophe.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of New York City subway and bus service disappearing 10
days before Christmas is "truly wild, it's crazy, something that must
never be allowed to happen," said photographer Mike Castellano,
standing in front of Macy's department store on 34th Street.</TE>
<TE>   As he spoke, final preparations were underway for the store's
famous Thanksgiving Day Parade, which will be broadcast live
nationally this morning. The event traditionally projects an image of
happy New Yorkers kicking off the holiday season, but the reality,
Castellano concedes, is quite different.</TE>
<TE>   "Life seemed to change here after 9/11, and it was great that
people rallied together," he said. "I'm hoping, really hoping, that
we'll come together once again."</TE>
<TE>   But rallying to plug a $6-billion budget gap may not be as easy as
it was to fight back against terrorism, he added. And the city's
current economic problems are not likely to generate national
sympathy as they did after the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "This time," Castellano said, "New York City is on its own."</TE>

<HD>A Lot of Bad News for Bears</HD>
<DH>A warming trend keeps the animals from their winter ice

is high.</DH>

<DL>CHURCHILL, Canada</DL>
<LD>It's been a busy year at the polar bear jail. Tubby's there again,
and Whiskers is back for the fourth time.</LD>
<LD>   Each fall, hundreds of polar bears migrate past this chilly
hamlet, waiting for Hudson Bay to freeze over so they can venture
onto the sea ice to pounce on unsuspecting seals.</LD>
<LD>   In good years, that means million of dollars for the town of
Churchill, which mobilizes a small army of bus-size Tundra buggies to
haul tourists for a few hours of viewing these fuzzy white Lords of
the Arctic.</LD>
<TE>   But in bad years, when the weather is off and the bears start
ambling into town out of hunger and curiosity, Churchill can look
more like a snowy version of "The Wild One" -- instead of bikers,
it's lumbering white carnivores wandering the streets or growling
behind bars as they wait their turn to be airlifted to a distant part
of the tundra.</TE>
<TE>   Lately, there have been a lot of bad years.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, instead of disappearing into carpets of wildflowers
that blanket the tundra, polar bears were pawing through the town
dump, wandering near the airport runway and snoozing on front
porches.</TE>
<TE>   Revelers leaving the Seaport Hotel lounge at the town's busiest
intersection have been repeatedly startled by the mammoth beasts
lumbering out amid parked trucks, and kitchen workers at the Northern
Lights Lodge have grown used to the sight of bears sniffing at
kitchen exhaust vents.</TE>
<TE>   "The bears are just coming all the time," said town council member
Verna Flett, 44, a school counselor born and raised in Churchill.
"The bears are out and about and unpredictable."</TE>
<TE>   Residents and scientists alike blame this furry invasion on
climate change, particularly a shift in the sea ice schedule rippling
through the ecosystem. A long-term study of the bears here by
Canadian Wildlife Service biologist Ian Stirling shows that a
long-term warming trend since 1950 has changed their behavior and
left them in poorer condition. They are skinnier, have fewer cubs and
linger in unlikely places.</TE>
<TE>   Similar changes are being seen across the Arctic. Delayed freezing
of the Beaufort Sea off Alaska's North Slope means more bears than
usual are congregating on the coastline, said Scott L. Schliebe, who
heads the polar bear program for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</TE>
<TE>   Inuit hunters in the northernmost Canadian territory of Nunavut
who are allowed to harvest a limited number of bears each year are
skinning the thinnest animals seen in memory. "One 3-year-old bear
had almost no fat on him," said Dinos Tikivik, a hunter from the
Nunavut capital, Iqaluit. "We were surprised. Healthy polar bears
have lots of nice white fat on their bodies."</TE>
<TE>   But the toll is most obvious in Churchill -- a town of 1,000 at
the southern extent of the Arctic, a point where the Churchill River
empties into Hudson Bay.</TE>
<TE>   The intersection of these waters has long attracted animals, from
beluga whales to caribou to polar bears. The richness of wildlife is
a point of pride for the people here. It's one reason they call their
town the "The Polar Bear Capital of the World" -- and why they worry
about the changing weather and the loitering bears.</TE>
<TE>   "We are concerned," said Churchill mayor Mike Spence, the son of a
fur trapper. "We don't want to be known as the mauling capital of the
world."</TE>
<TE>   Close Encounters</TE>
<TE>   Most who live here can tell stories about close encounters of the
bear kind. Some have nearly walked into bears while exiting the
Northern Store. Others have driven into the animals during
snowstorms. Home "redecoration" by truck-sized polar bears is not
unheard of.</TE>
<TE>   "Bear in cabin, it's a disaster," said longtime resident Mike
Macri, 52. "They go through a window, renovate the place and go out
through a wall."</TE>
<TE>   The hardy denizens of this town -- tough enough to withstand
howling prairie winds and winter temperatures that dip to 40 below --
are actually more charmed than afraid of their bears. The largest
carnivores on land, the animals can weigh as much as 1,500 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   When a bear recently wandered through an open door at the
members-only Royal Canadian Legion Hall, a manager calmly shouted:
"You're not a member." The bear scrammed.</TE>
<TE>   They have become such regulars at the town dump, the refuse pile
is labeled on maps as the "Polar Bear Cafe." It is almost impossible
to deter bears from feasting there. Even when trash is being burned,
groups of bears, their coats blacked by soot, can be seen daintily
picking their way through the orange flames.</TE>
<TE>   On Halloween, the one night children are allowed to go out after
dark, volunteers drive firetrucks, ambulances and pickup trucks
around the edges of town to scare off the bears. People are advised
not to dress as ghosts -- or anything big and white for that matter
-- lest they be mistaken for a bear and shot.</TE>
<TE>   The Hudson Bay bears are a unique bunch. Most polar bears spend
their lives on or near Arctic waters north of Canada, Alaska, Russia
and Greenland, where the ice remains much of the year, providing a
constant supply of ringed seals.</TE>
<TE>   But the Hudson Bay bears inhabit an area hundreds of miles south,
at about the same latitude as Aberdeen, Scotland. They survive
because the surface of Hudson Bay is frozen from mid-October through
mid-April. During these months, the bears live like their northern
cousins that don't face a dramatic loss of ice each summer: They hunt
seals at breathing holes, pounce on seal pup lairs, sleep on ice
floes and swim in frigid waters.</TE>
<TE>   In late spring, when the ice disappears, the bears come ashore.
While they don't hibernate, their metabolism slows markedly. They
fast for six months and lose hundreds of pounds, enough that their
thick, yellowish pelts hang loosely off their broad shoulders and
hips.</TE>
<TE>   Survival of Fattest</TE>
<TE>   Long winters produce fat polar bears. In 1992, the year after Mt.
Pinatubo's eruption slightly cooled the planet, an extra-long ice
season resulted in the fattest bears Hudson Bay researchers had seen
for years. They are still called the Pinatubo bears.</TE>
<TE>   Short winters, however, are a disaster. In this struggle for life
-- a survival of the fattest -- bears that have not packed on enough
weight during winter can starve to death by fall.</TE>
<TE>   Biologist Stirling, who has studied polar bears for more than two
decades, reported in 1999 that a 50-year warming trend caused spring
ice to break up earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Bears have had less time to fatten up. Polar bear sows have had
less time to pack on the roughly 450 extra pounds they need to
sustain pregnancy and provide fat-rich milk to their cubs. Stirling's
work showed bears missing just two weeks of crucial spring feeding
can lose 8% of their weight.</TE>
<TE>   Those that survive the summer are at their most ravenous -- and
dangerous. Starving bears often lose their natural wariness and
wander into town.</TE>
<TE>   Remarkably, only two people have been killed by polar bears in
Churchill in recent decades. The first was a native Inuk teenager
mauled in 1968 after harassing a bear. Then in 1983, an Inuk resident
was killed after he scavenged through the ruins of a burned-down
hotel and stuffed his pockets with unspoiled meat from a freezer.</TE>
<TE>   The low number of deaths is a tribute to both the discerning
palates of bears, which seem to prefer fat seals to bony people, and
to the town's 32-year-old "Bear Alert" program. Residents can call
675-BEAR, day or night, to report errant bears. Manitoba Conservation
officer Richard Romaniuk and his crew will shoot the bear with a
tranquilizing dart and haul it to jail.</TE>
<TE>   It is not uncommon for the men to capture four bears in a day. To
keep the animals from associating humans with food, they are not fed
in jail. The bears are kept behind bars until the bay freezes and
they can start hunting. If the 21 cinder-block cells fill up, as they
already have twice this year, the bears are airlifted by helicopter
and taken north.</TE>
<TE>   Leg snares and traps baited with seal blubber are set around the
town's perimeter. Other interlopers are caught on the tundra outside
of town.</TE>
<TE>   "The program has two objectives. The first is to protect the
people from the bears. The second is to protect the bears from the
people," Romaniuk said. "The last thing we want to do is put a polar
bear down."</TE>
<TE>   Hunting of bears in Manitoba is not allowed. Killing one in
self-defense is legal but rarely occurs, Romaniuk said.</TE>
<TE>   The town has good reason to keep them alive. Rough estimates
indicate the province of Manitoba earns well over $300 million each
year from bear tourism, a good share of that going to businesses in
town.</TE>
<TE>   "Bears are the backbone of our economy," said town manager Darren
Ottaway.</TE>
<TE>   While Ottaway is concerned about an abundance of hungry bears
coming to town in the short term, he is even more worried that global
warming may mean no bears here at all one day.</TE>
<TE>   "If the floor was to fall out of the bear industry, we'd need to
diversify to survive," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For three weeks during bear season, sleepy Churchill blooms as
about 15,000 tourists stream through town hoping to get close-up
views of the animals from caravans of heated "Tundra Buggies."
Several chartered jets unload bear-gazers at the Churchill airport
each day. Hotels and restaurants shuttered during the bleak winter
fill to capacity. Gift shops do a brisk business selling polar bear
puppets, earrings and pajamas.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything just goes crazy," said town councilor Flett.</TE>
<TE>   During the eight years he has been mayor, Spence has already seen
the effects of climate change on the bear industry. He said the
season used to end by early November, when the bay froze and the
bears spread out across Hudson Bay, out of the reach of tourists.
Now, the bay sometimes stays open until late December.</TE>
<TE>   "If warming continues as projected, it is likely that in 30 to 50
years there may not be many bears in Hudson Bay," Stirling said.</TE>
<TE>   'Local Extinction'</TE>
<TE>   Polar bears are not currently an endangered species. Their total
population is estimated to be from 22,000 to 27,000. But the 1,200
Hudson Bay bears could face what scientists call a "local extinction"
-- they could produce fewer cubs and eventually die out. The bears
won't travel to colder places because those areas are occupied by
bears likely to defend their territory.</TE>
<TE>   Officials and business leaders in Churchill have already begun
planning for warmer and possibly bear-free days.</TE>
<TE>   Ottaway is pushing beluga whale watching, wildflower photography
and bird-watching as summer attractions. And he is delighted that
Japanese tourists are willing to brave the bone-chilling cold of
winter to view the Aurora Borealis.</TE>
<TE>   Some, according to the Japan Travel Bureau, are interested in
conceiving a child under the lights to ensure the child a fortunate
life. A few sites have plexiglass domes for cozy indoor viewing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's super news for us," Ottaway said of the potential Japanese
tourist boom.</TE>
<TE>   Warmer weather, Ottaway said, could also extend the shipping
season on Hudson Bay and attract more filmmakers. The science-fiction
classic "Iceman" was filmed nearby as well as an upcoming film, "The
Snow Walker."</TE>
<TE>   "When people talk about climate change, you have to look at the
benefits too," Ottaway said.</TE>
<TE>   But residents like Flett, who are used to the company of bears,
feel differently. They have lived side by side with the animals,
watched the timeless spectacle of mothers emerging from dens with
cubs in tow, profited from their predictable fall schedules and
occasionally fled from them in terror. To them, it's like living in a
cozy small town where everyone knows your name -- even if half the
residents could tear you apart with their claws.</TE>
<TE>   Flett has been so upset at the sight of starving bears that she's
pondered the possibility of killing seals on the unfrozen bay and
hauling the meat back for the bears -- a kind of ursine public
assistance program.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been in our community for years and years," Flett said.
"They're like neighbors."</TE>

<LD>Mexico said it had agreed to extradite alleged drug kingpin Miguel

<HD>N. Korea Zone Chief Charged</HD>
<DH>Chinese tycoon tapped to run capitalist enclave faces
allegations of 'commercial crimes.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Henry Chu</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>A Chinese entrepreneur who was supposed to oversee a fledgling
capitalist enclave in North Korea has been charged with offering
bribes, faking contracts and committing other "commercial crimes" in
China, state media reported Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Flower magnate Yang Bin, once named the second-richest man in
China by Forbes magazine, had been under detention at his home in
Shenyang in northeastern China since early October on suspicion of
economic misdeeds. On Wednesday, he was formally placed under arrest
there, where his company, Euro-Asia Agricultural Holdings Co., is
based, the New China News Agency said.</LD>
<LD>   Yang is accused of running shady investment schemes, offering
illegal payoffs, drawing up fraudulent contracts and occupying land
illegally, the news agency reported.</LD>
<TE>   Although his arrest was not unexpected, it throws into doubt a
plan by North Korea, China's neighbor and close ally, to experiment
with market-oriented reforms in the city of Sinuiju, on the border
with China. In a move that surprised observers two months ago, North
Korea announced the creation of a special economic zone in Sinuiju
and then tapped the flamboyant Yang, 39, to head the enclave.</TE>
<TE>   Yang, who holds Chinese and Dutch citizenship, set to the task of
running Sinuiju with the same verve that helped him build an
orchid-exporting business into a multimillion-dollar corporation.
Apparently without consulting either Beijing or the North Korean
leadership, he promised to bring in foreign experts to help
administer the free-market zone and declared that anyone with a
foreign passport could immediately begin crossing freely into and out
of Sinuiju.</TE>
<TE>   Those would have been astounding changes for North Korea, which
remains an insular, Stalinist state, but none of them came to pass.
Instead, Yang was bundled off by Chinese police for questioning.</TE>
<TE>   He has not been seen in public since his Oct. 4 detention. The
Chinese government later said Yang was under a form of "house
supervision" while authorities conducted an investigation into his
dealings.</TE>
<TE>   Before his detention, Yang acknowledged owing $1.2 million in back
taxes, but he told reporters that he was on the verge of settling the
matter.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his own fate, that of his company now seems
uncertain. The firm's main telephone line in Shenyang has been
disconnected. Euro-Asia owes money to creditors. It was not clear
what would happen to a quirky, Dutch-themed real estate development
-- complete with canals like those in Amsterdam -- that Yang had been
building in Shenyang.</TE>
<TE>   Yang's case is one of a string of high-profile official probes
into the dealings of some of China's wealthiest businesspeople, which
some analysts say is a populist effort by the Communist regime to
appear on the side of ordinary, hard-working Chinese. Disenchantment
is widespread over the widening income gap between highfliers such as
Yang and workers who have lost their jobs or farmers who find
themselves eking out a meager existence.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Yang, a well-known Chinese actress and a
businessman who heads one of China's biggest auto makers have been
under investigation. The auto executive, Yang Rong, fled China for
Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Turkish Cypriot Leader Ready to Negotiate on Reunification</HD>
<DH>Greek faction had already accepted U.N.-sponsored plan as
basis for talks to bring both sides together into one country.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash informed U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Wednesday that he was prepared to negotiate on the
basis of a U.N. plan to reunify the divided island of Cyprus.</LD>
<LD>   Denktash replied to Annan's Nov. 11 request for an initial
reaction to his 137-page plan to unify the Mediterranean island into
a single country with two equal states and a loose federal government
with a rotating presidency, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.</LD>
<LD>   Greek Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides had already accepted the
plan as a basis for negotiations.</LD>
<TE>   Annan had been waiting for a reply from Denktash, who is
recovering from surgery in a New York hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "The important thing is we now have an answer from Mr. Denktash
saying he is willing to move forward to negotiate on the basis of the
plan," Dujarric said.</TE>
<TE>   Annan on Tuesday made a new request to both leaders to provide
more detailed comments, suggestions and requests regarding the plan
by Saturday "to enable the process to move forward," Dujarric said.</TE>
<TE>   The secretary-general is pushing for an agreement before a key
European Union summit Dec. 12 to approve the entry of Cyprus and nine
other prospective EU members by 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot south and a
Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded the island in 1974 after
a short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece. A breakaway
Turkish Cypriot state in the north is recognized only by Turkey,
which maintains 40,000 troops there.</TE>
<TE>   If the two sides fail to agree, the European Union is committed to
admitting only the Greek Cypriot part of the country. Turkey has
warned that Ankara then might annex the north.</TE>
<TE>   In the Turkish sector of the divided capital, Nicosia, meanwhile,
a crowd estimated at between 12,000 and 20,000 marched to urge
Denktash to accept Annan's plan.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking on Turkish television, Denktash discussed his plans to
relay points he opposes in the plan: "They're forcing us to create
one nation from two nations; what I'm seeking is a partnership with
two sovereignties."</TE>

<HD>Doctor Says Bin Laden Was Healthy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LAHORE, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>A prominent Pakistani doctor who admitted treating Osama bin Laden
and other Al Qaeda leaders before and after the Sept. 11 attacks said
Wednesday that the terrorist mastermind was in excellent health and
showed no signs of kidney failure.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Amer Aziz, recently released after being held incommunicado
and interrogated for a month by FBI and CIA agents, said he knew
nothing of Al Qaeda's plans and rejected allegations that he helped
the organization in its efforts to obtain weapons of mass
destruction.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking at his clinic in Lahore, Aziz said he met Bin Laden twice
-- in 1999 after Bin Laden hurt his back falling off a horse in
southern Afghanistan and in November 2001, two months after the
attacks on New York and Washington, when Aziz was summoned to treat
another senior Al Qaeda leader, Mohammed Atef, in Kabul, Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   Bin Laden was in strong health on both occasions, said Aziz, a
British-educated orthopedic surgeon. He said he saw no evidence that
Bin Laden had kidney disease, as has been widely reported, or that he
was on dialysis.</TE>
<TE>   "He was walking. He was healthy. He just told me to give good
treatment to his man, that he was a very important man," Aziz said of
the November meeting, at which No. 2 Al Qaeda leader Ayman Zawahiri
was also present.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are on dialysis, you have a special look. I didn't see any
of that," Aziz said, adding that he gave Bin Laden a complete
physical in 1999 and found no signs of kidney problems.</TE>
<TE>   Reports of Bin Laden's poor health -- and his deteriorating
appearance in videotapes released shortly after U.S. bombing began in
Afghanistan in October 2001 -- fueled speculation that he might have
died. Intelligence officials now say an audiotape released last month
was recorded recently and contained Bin Laden's voice.</TE>
<TE>   Aziz said that when he went to Afghanistan last November to set up
a surgical unit at the University of Jalalabad, near the border with
Pakistan, he had no idea that he was going to meet Bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   A day after he treated Atef for a slipped disk, the Al Qaeda
military chief was killed by U.S. bombing, Aziz said, adding that he
attended Atef's funeral.</TE>
<TE>   Aziz, who speaks fluent English, said it never occurred to him to
turn in Bin Laden. He said he had been traveling to Afghanistan since
1989 to give medical support to Islamic fighters, a time when it was
"kosher for everyone to support the moujahedeen," or holy warriors.
In those days, anti-Soviet fighters in Afghanistan were supported by
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "Different countries have since made a somersault, but I had no
plans to do so myself," he said. "Anyone who is fighting for what is
right, it is my duty to treat them."</TE>

<HD>Troubled Italian Held in Hijack Attempt Over Alps</HD>
<DH>The ex-policeman has a history of mental illness and had
commandeered a plane and a train in the past, authorities say. No one
is injured.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sebastian Rotella</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>A former Italian policeman with a history of mental illness and
hijacking attempts threatened to blow up a passenger jet Wednesday,
causing the plane to land in the French city of Lyon, police said. He
was subdued without anyone being injured.</LD>
<LD>   Police found no weapons on the man, who had claimed to have a bomb
and brandished a television remote control that he said was a device
to trigger an explosion. Although he declared aboard the plane that
he was an Al Qaeda terrorist, law enforcement officials said the
incident had no connection to Al Qaeda or any other terrorist
organization.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, authorities said Stefano Savorani, 29, was apparently
driven by the same psychological torments that caused him to
commandeer an Italian train in 1998 and an Air France flight from
Marseille to Paris in 1999.</LD>
<TE>   "Oh no, he's done it again," Savorani's mother, Orella, exclaimed
when she learned of her son's arrest, according to the Italian news
agency ANSA. "I've been anxious for hours because he didn't come home
for lunch."</TE>
<TE>   Press reports quoted her as saying her son, who is from a town
near Bologna, Italy, had received treatment for schizophrenia.
Savorani spent six years with the Italian investigative police but
was dismissed in 1998 because of mental problems, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the bloodless resolution, the incident aboard the
Paris-bound flight from Bologna caused widespread alarm. As warnings
about terrorist plots and arrests of suspected Al Qaeda members
multiply, Europeans are on high alert.</TE>
<TE>   France is considered a prime target because of the longtime
presence of Islamic extremists in the country. Italians worry about
an increase in terrorism and about a recent threat in which Al Qaeda
leader Osama bin Laden named Italy along with other West European
countries.</TE>
<TE>   The ordeal aboard the Alitalia MD-80 began soon after the plane
took off for Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris. When the plane was
over the Swiss Alps, Savorani allegedly got up and began making
threats, French authorities said. He said he would blow up the plane,
ranted about Al Qaeda and Bin Laden and demanded to talk to
journalists, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   French police said the jet carried 67 passengers and a crew of
seven, while Alitalia reported that there were 57 passengers.</TE>
<TE>   After a conversation with Savorani, the pilot advised the tower at
Lyon's Saint Exupery Airport that he intended to land there.</TE>
<TE>   When the plane landed, the hijacker allowed all but two hostages
to disembark using emergency slides, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Savorani was among the last to emerge. He was quickly overpowered
by the SWAT team at the bottom of a slide, said Yves Guillot, a
public safety administrator in Lyon. "This man did not surrender. He
came down behind two people who he said were his hostages, and he was
holding what he said was a bomb ready to explode."</TE>
<TE>   Italy's civil aviation director said that because Savorani did not
have a weapon, the incident did not result from deficiencies in
airport security. However, questions were raised about whether
airlines or airports should be able to detect a passenger with a
record of hijacking attempts.</TE>

<HD>Netanyahu Challenge to Sharon Sputtering</HD>
<DH>Israeli ex-leader appears to have failed in effort to
attract Likud's hard-right core away from the premier. The party
primary is today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilkinson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>It says something about how far to the right Israel has moved when
veteran warhorse Ariel Sharon is cast as a moderate in the race for
leadership of his party and of the nation.</LD>
<LD>   Moderate only because the prime minister's opponent is Benjamin
Netanyahu, who is staking out far-right positions in an increasingly
long-shot bid to replace Sharon.</LD>
<LD>   The two men vie for election as head of their Likud Party today,
and the winner will almost certainly become the next prime minister
of Israel in a Jan. 28 vote -- the country's third national contest
in less than four years.</LD>
<TE>   Four opinion polls Wednesday gave Sharon leads in excess of 20
percentage points over Netanyahu.</TE>
<TE>   Netanyahu, who is usually considered to be the possessor of
unrivaled charisma and politicking talent, has apparently fallen
short when it comes to a quality Israelis see in the former prime
minister's longtime political nemesis: trustworthiness.</TE>
<TE>   As the influential newspaper Haaretz put it in a headline
Wednesday: "It's the Credibility, Stupid."</TE>
<TE>   In the final days of a brief but nasty campaign, Netanyahu
launched a none-too-subtle assault on Sharon and his policies. In
interviews, ads and campaign rallies, he accused Sharon of failing to
protect Israelis from Palestinian attack and blamed Israel's dire
economic straits on Sharon's lack of vision.</TE>
<TE>   "The government under Sharon's leadership lowered the level of
expectations to grass-high," Netanyahu told Israel's largest daily,
Yediot Aharonot. "Despair is eating away at everything good in this
people.</TE>
<TE>   "I am asking for the support of those who believe that we can get
out of this situation. I have solutions."</TE>
<TE>   Among those solutions, he said, is to "seize and cleanse" all
Palestinian territory and oust the current Palestinian leadership. He
favors expelling Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat and
opposes the creation of a Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   But the silver-tongued politician known as Bibi has failed to sway
Likud voters.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon largely ignored the competition, especially Netanyahu, who
became his foreign minister in the lame-duck government created last
month when the departure of the center-left Labor Party triggered the
need for new elections. Instead, the 74-year-old sheep rancher and
veteran of every Israeli war portrayed himself as a trusted commander
best able to guide the nation through tough times.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon is widely perceived among the public as reliable, including
by those who complain bitterly about deepening poverty and a
skyrocketing death toll in Israel's battle with the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "[Sharon] has attained an unprecedented status in which the worse
things get, the more the people trust him," said political
commentator Yoel Marcus of Haaretz.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli unemployment and poverty rates are reaching unprecedented
levels. Israelis are dying in political violence on a scale not seen
for decades. Yet Sharon is admired by many Israelis for cracking down
aggressively against the Palestinians, for pushing measures --
controversial among human rights organizations -- such as targeted
killings and the reoccupation of Palestinian territory, and for doing
it without provoking much outcry from other governments.</TE>
<TE>   The reality is that Sharon and Netanyahu's political differences
are minor, the clash of their personalities and private rivalries
enormous. When Netanyahu was elected prime minister in 1996, he made
Sharon squirm by initially refusing to find a place for him in the
Cabinet. When Netanyahu fell three years later, Sharon very publicly
picked up the pieces of a party that was a shambles.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, following the destruction of a commuter bus by a
Palestinian suicide bomber, resulting in the death of 11 passengers,
Sharon didn't invite Netanyahu to emergency security consultations
involving senior Cabinet ministers. Netanyahu got back by making a
high-profile visit to a hospital to comfort survivors, TV cameras and
foreign ambassadors in tow.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon shot back Sunday at the weekly Cabinet meeting,
congratulating Netanyahu for his "PR work."</TE>
<TE>   In a rather implausible sally, Netanyahu sought to portray Sharon
as something just short of a closet leftist. He said there was really
very little difference between Sharon and the new leftist head of the
Labor Party, Amram Mitzna, who advocates a series of conciliatory
gestures toward the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon called on the trappings of his office and the remarkably
good relations he enjoys with the White House as his campaign
backdrops.</TE>
<TE>   He has suggested in newspaper interviews that Netanyahu endangers
the special Israeli-U.S. relationship by making inflammatory
anti-Palestinian statements at a time when Washington needs
international support for any war against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "You need tenacity in this war," Sharon said. "Good judgment.
Responsibility, not shouting. Not slogans. You need to speak less.</TE>
<TE>   "I am good for difficult situations."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's landslide victory in February 2001 over then-Prime
Minister Ehud Barak was a final, long-sought vindication for one of
Israel's most controversial figures. Reviled by the Arab world and
officially blamed for failing to stop a 1982 massacre of Palestinian
refugees, Sharon fought back to achieve the land's highest position
long after his political career had been written off by pundits.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon, in contrast to Netanyahu, is seen as a man of his word,
even to those on the opposite end of the political spectrum. He has
never made a secret of his world view that today's conflict with the
Palestinians is part of a 100-year continuum, nor of his desire to
destroy the Palestinian Authority and replace Arafat with malleable
leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Where Netanyahu is sometimes seen as glib and too slick, Sharon is
an authority figure who commands respect.</TE>
<TE>   Many Likud supporters, in addition, are averse to toppling a
sitting prime minister. The prevailing attitude is to stick with a
winner, especially in the middle of turmoil. Polls show Sharon would
easily defeat Labor's candidate and carry the party to a
near-majority in the Knesset, Israel's parliament.</TE>
<TE>   Pollster Rafi Smith said his surveys indicate that Likud could
nearly double the number of seats it has in the Knesset, to 40 in the
120-member body. At that point, it wouldn't be difficult to invite
several smaller parties into a coalition and form a majority-holding
government.</TE>
<TE>   "Sharon has managed to grasp more of the middle ground," Smith
said. "He is seen as more moderate than he looked in the past. That's
been his main achievement, creating this perception."</TE>
<TE>   Netanyahu, on the other hand, appears extremist, Smith said.
Netanyahu had hoped to carve out his following from Likud's
hard-right core, including Jewish settlers who brook no compromise
with the Palestinians over territory or rights.</TE>
<TE>   But he may have failed to take into consideration several factors.
For one, Likud organizers conducted a massive signature drive earlier
this year, doubling party rolls to more than 300,000 people. The
majority are said to be Sharon supporters and, like him, accept,
however grudgingly, that an eventual Palestinian state is inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   Second, the upcoming national election reverts to a strict
parliamentary system. Netanyahu benefited in 1996 when Israelis cast
a separate ballot for the prime minister. Personality mattered more.</TE>
<TE>   This time voters are simply choosing the party.</TE>

<HD>An African 'Renaissance' Gone Awry</HD>
<DH>Nigeria is riven by corruption, religious strife and
economic malaise. Many blame the president, who they say has been
ineffectual.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Davan Maharaj</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>LAGOS, Nigeria</DL>
<LD>After ending 15 years of unbroken military rule in 1999, Nigerian
President Olusegun Obasanjo pledged to lead a "genuine renaissance"
to stamp out violence, despair and rampant corruption in a country
that prides itself in being called the giant of Africa. Today Nigeria
is, by most accounts, still the continent's most corrupt nation. Its
129 million people -- who make up the largest black population in the
world -- are as bereft of hope as ever.</LD>
<LD>   And the religious, ethnic and communal violence that has claimed
more than 10,000 lives during Obasanjo's tenure was spotlighted last
week when Miss World organizers abandoned Abuja, the Nigerian
capital, as the site of their December beauty pageant. Three days of
Muslim-Christian clashes left more than 200 people dead and part of
the northern city of Kaduna in ruins.</LD>
<LD>   Under Obasanjo, whom many Nigerians describe as an arrogant leader
who is largely out of touch with his people, the divisions between
the country's Muslim north and Christian south have deepened. A dozen
northern states have embraced Sharia, or Islamic law, setting up
bloody clashes between Muslims and Christian minorities there.</LD>
<TE>   Northern leaders have used Sharia's popularity to improve their
standing with their constituents and to mount an opposition to
Obasanjo. But critics say Obasanjo is also to blame for the crisis
because he has allowed conflicts arising from Sharia to fester. The
Nigerian leader has said little about the controversy -- only that he
would weep if a death sentence was carried out against Amina Lawal, a
single woman who has been sentenced to stoning for having sex out of
wedlock.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say Obasanjo's handling of the Sharia issue is reflective
of his presidency. Since assuming power, Obasanjo's administration
has failed to institute reforms, prosecute corrupt military leaders
or recover any significant amount of the billions of dollars looted
from the country's treasury.</TE>
<TE>   For the last few months, lawmakers have been lining up to impeach
him, colleagues in his own party have been mounting challenges to his
campaign to be reelected in March, and Nigerians have been growing
increasingly frustrated with his leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Obasanjo has cited as an achievement the fact that Nigeria -- a
country with more than 250 ethnic groups and languages -- has
survived.</TE>
<TE>   Karl Maier, author of the acclaimed "This House Has Fallen:
Midnight in Nigeria," conceded that, yes, Nigeria has not fallen
apart under Obasanjo. "But it is certainly in worse health than when
he took office," he said. "Nigeria is in danger of going critical."</TE>
<TE>   Obasanjo's election was supposed to mean a new beginning for
Nigeria. It was his second chance at running the country.</TE>
<TE>   In 1979, Obasanjo, then an army general, became the first African
military leader to hand over power to a civilian government. Twenty
years later, the favor was returned to him -- thanks to backing from
the military's top brass and mainly northern Muslims who voted for
him en masse.</TE>
<TE>   "Nigeria is wonderfully endowed by the Almighty with human and
other resources," Obasanjo said at his inauguration ceremony,
attended by then-South African President Nelson Mandela, the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, Prince Charles and more than a dozen African heads of
state. "It does no credit to us or the entire black race if we fail
in managing our resources for quick improvement in the quality of the
lives of our people."</TE>
<TE>   Nigeria is one of the world's largest oil producers. Its lucrative
oil shipments make it the largest African trading partner of the
United States. After his election, Obasanjo set about repairing
Nigeria's image to attract foreign investment and win much-needed
debt relief.</TE>
<TE>   But critics said Obasanjo began to fancy himself as a world
leader, ignoring the massive problems at home.</TE>
<TE>   In his first 3 1/2 years in office, Obasanjo has made more than
100 foreign trips, racking up more frequent flier miles than
President Bush. He has been dubbed "the absentee president" by human
rights activist Gani Fawehinmi, who recently released a pamphlet
declaring that the Nigerian leader had spent 340 days abroad between
March 1999 and June 10 this year.</TE>
<TE>   "As the Nation Bleeds, Our President Goes to Jamaica Again,"
screamed a headline over a front-page editorial in a Lagos daily
about Obasanjo's junket in August to Jamaica, Barbados and Senegal.
"At a time when dark clouds are gathering all over Nigeria, this trip
is a flight in irresponsibility."</TE>
<TE>   Members of Nigeria's House of Representatives -- led by top
lawmakers of his own party -- recently cited Obasanjo's globe
trotting and his failure to control mounting violence among grounds
for his impeachment.</TE>
<TE>   Obasanjo ridiculed the move as "a joke taken too far," but when
the Senate threw its weight behind the impeachment, Obasanjo had to
rely on mediation by two former heads of state to halt the
proceedings. Now an independent panel is investigating whether
several lawmakers accepted bribes to drop their support for
impeachment.</TE>
<TE>   "The impeachment threat was just that -- a threat to rattle him
and bring him down to earth," said Pat Utomi, a professor at the
Lagos Business School. "But when momentum for impeachment built up,
these [lawmakers] started believing that they could really do it."</TE>
<TE>   Critics say last week's decision by Miss World organizers to
abandon Abuja was the latest slap to the president, and to first lady
Stella Obasanjo, who poured millions of dollars in taxpayer money
into promoting the pageant.</TE>
<TE>   Nigeria, about twice the size of California, is a country beset by
horrific crime, colossal traffic jams and crumbling infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone who truly thought that hosting the beauty pageant in a
country with a powerful Muslim community at this fragile time of
worldwide Muslim-Christian relations [was a good idea] is lost in
space," said Maier, the author.</TE>
<TE>   Maier, Utomi and other Nigeria watchers foresee more violence as
Nigeria approaches next year's election. The field of candidates is
not yet determined, but serious challenges to Obasanjo could come
from his vice president, Atiku Abubakar, and former military ruler
Ibrahim Babangida.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent poll, only a third of Nigeria's top business leaders
said they expected Obasanjo to be reelected, according to Utomi. In a
country ruled by the military for all but 13 years since its 1960
independence from Britain, many people, including Maier, say they
aren't even certain that the voting will occur as planned.</TE>
<TE>   "I could remotely see a scenario of escalating violence and
Obasanjo declaring martial law," Maier said. "If there is an
election, I think the odds are with Obasanjo to win it, but I am far
from sure there will be a vote."</TE>

<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>British intelligence allowed two World War II double agents nicknamed
Mutt and Jeff to bomb two buildings in Britain to maintain their
cover, according to wartime documents from the MI5 agency released
today.</LD>
<LD>   The previously classified papers, released by the Public Records
Office, show that a power station and a food store were bombed to
convince the Germans that the two agents they believed were theirs
were operating effectively.</LD>
<LD>   In reality, the agents had been captured and "turned" by MI5, the
papers show.</LD>
<TE>   The double agents also fed the Germans false information,
including that Britain was planning to invade Norway.</TE>
<TE>   The agents involved were identified as Norwegians Helge Moee and
Tor Glad, who arrived in Britain by rubber dinghy at a beach in
northern Scotland.</TE>
<TE>   The documents stated, "It was obvious that if the case were to be
kept going, a faked act of sabotage would have to be committed."</TE>
<TE>   Security officials warned people away before the store was bombed.
At the power station in Bury St. Edmunds in eastern England, an
incendiary device was placed in an area not likely to cause serious
damage.</TE>
<TE>   There were no casualties in either bombing.</TE>

<HD>Witness Says He Guarded Terrorist</HD>
<DH>Bin Laden bragged before 9/11 of thousands of future
American deaths, Jordanian states at a trial in Germany.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dirk Laabs</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>HAMBURG, Germany</DL>
<LD>A Jordanian who claims to have briefly been Osama bin Laden's
bodyguard told a German court Wednesday that the Al Qaeda leader
bragged long before the Sept. 11 attacks that his group would kill
thousands of Americans.</LD>
<LD>   Shadi Abdalla, 25, said he spent four months in early 2000 in two
Al Qaeda camps near Kandahar, the former Taliban stronghold in
southern Afghanistan. During that time, he said, he heard Bin Laden
lecture several times.</LD>
<LD>   Once, according to Abdalla, Bin Laden said: "We will hit America's
spine soon. Thousands will die. We will hit them hard."</LD>
<TE>   Bin Laden didn't elaborate, Abdalla said. On another occasion,
Abdalla said, Bin Laden asked a group of recruits to pray for his
fighters, who had just begun an attack he didn't specify.</TE>
<TE>   Abdalla was testifying in the trial of Mounir Motassadeq, a
Moroccan accused of providing logistical support to the Sept. 11
hijack teams. Prosecutors say Abdalla is one of their most important
witnesses in the trial, although he created considerable confusion by
his apparent inability to remember the timing of events.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Abdalla said he saw Motassadeq at a camp in
Afghanistan at a time when Motassadeq was believed to be in Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Abdalla was arrested in Germany in April and has been in custody
since. He is awaiting trial on charges that he was a member of a
terrorist group that planned attacks inside Germany, according to
German investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators have interrogated Abdalla nearly 30 times and
indicate that they have been able to corroborate some of his
information, according to people with knowledge of the
interrogations.</TE>
<TE>   Abdalla came to Germany in 1995 from Jordan and received political
asylum. In late 1999, the Muslim missionary sect Tabligh paid for him
to make a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. Abdalla said he met one of Bin
Laden's sons-in-law there and was persuaded to travel to Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Abdalla said he traveled through Pakistan to Kandahar, where he
stayed in an Al Qaeda guest house under the supervision of Mohammed
Atef, Al Qaeda's military leader, who was killed last year in the
U.S. bombing campaign in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Abdalla then trained in a military camp for 20 days and was
transferred to a camp near the Kandahar airport, where, he said, he
met Bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   When Bin Laden later left for another camp, Abdalla was chosen to
be one of his personal guards. Abdalla said his main qualification
for the job was his size. He is a large man, about 6-foot-4 and
stocky.</TE>
<TE>   "They were afraid at that time that [Bin Laden] may be attacked
any time soon," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden spoke often about the jihad, or holy war, against the
Americans, Abdalla said. The 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania were discussed openly in the camps, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Abdalla testified that he saw defendant Motassadeq three times in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Motassadeq has admitted attending an Al Qaeda camp but said that
it was purely for military training and that the camp had no
political orientation.</TE>

<HD>Iraq Will Give, but Not Give In</HD>
<DH>U.S. expects Hussein to cooperate and buy himself time
while concealing weapons.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Doyle McManus</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Iraq's response to U.N. inspections of potential chemical, biological
and nuclear sites is just what the Bush administration feared,
officials said Wednesday: initial compliance but little evidence that
Saddam Hussein is genuinely ready to disarm.</LD>
<LD>   With just one day of inspections completed, U.S. officials and
experts outside the government said they expect Iraq to continue to
cooperate even as it attempts to conceal ongoing weapons programs.</LD>
<LD>   They point out that Iraq, even as it agreed to allow inspectors
back after a four-year hiatus, insisted that it has nothing to hide.
But that assertion flies in the face of evidence the U.S., Britain,
France and other governments say their intelligence agencies have
amassed that Iraq is pursuing nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons programs.</LD>
<TE>   "What they've been doing is complying, but grudgingly ... in a way
that portends bad things to come," a senior Bush administration
official said in an interview on condition he not be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq watchers outside the government largely agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "The Iraqis are very confident in their ability to continue to
hide this stuff from the inspectors," said Kenneth M. Pollack, a
former CIA expert on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Pollack, who served on President Clinton's National Security
Council staff, argues in his book "The Threatening Storm" that the
only reliable way to disarm Iraq is through military action.</TE>
<TE>   "They know it's simply a waiting game," Pollack said. "They've
waited out the international community once, and I think they're
confident they can do it again."</TE>
<TE>   "[Hussein] will do everything possible to delay, protract, draw
the process out in hope that something will happen to derail us,"
said David L. Mack, a former State Department official and Iraq
expert. "His whole history is based on believing that something will
happen that allows him to escape."</TE>
<TE>   Teams of U.N. inspectors carried out their first inspections of
Iraqi facilities Wednesday and met with no apparent resistance from
the Baghdad government.</TE>
<TE>   The inspectors did not report any immediate findings, but they
were not expected to. Their initial forays were intended largely as
trial runs, in part to test whether the Iraqis would put obstacles in
their path.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush and his aides have made it clear for weeks that
Iraq's level of cooperation with the inspectors was a key early test
and that, if the Iraqis failed, a U.S.-led invasion would shortly
follow.</TE>
<TE>   That's still the case, the senior official said Wednesday. "The
only way this is going to work is if Iraq is willingly complying," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   He said Iraqi officials had allowed the inspectors to enter the
country and begin their operations unhindered. But more significant,
he said, were Baghdad's repeated statements arguing that the
inspections regime is unfair.</TE>
<TE>   "They continue to say there are no weapons of mass destruction in
Iraq," the official said. Inspections chief Hans Blix "has told them
you need to prove that's true."</TE>
<TE>   The next major test will come Dec. 8, when Iraq is due to submit
an "accurate, full and complete declaration" of any nuclear, chemical
and biological programs. There, the experts say, Hussein faces
several options -- and they disagree over which he is most likely to
choose.</TE>
<TE>   He may say he has nothing to declare, that Iraq has no weapons
programs beyond the ones it has already acknowledged. Or he may try
to guess what the CIA and other Western intelligence agencies know
about his weapons programs and declare a little more. Or he may
declare everything -- and drown the U.N. in paper by including every
chemical and biological laboratory in the country, from weapons
programs to veterinary stations and high schools.</TE>
<TE>   The most likely scenario, government officials believe, is the
first one: a declaration that Baghdad has already revealed all its
weapons of mass destruction -- issuing, in effect, a challenge to the
U.N. to find whatever it can.</TE>
<TE>   "The conundrum will be if they stand pat" on previous declarations
to the U.N., or if they say, 'We had [a weapon] but we destroyed it,
and the records were destroyed too,' " the senior official said.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, it will be up to the U.N. inspectors, aided by
Western intelligence, to prove the declaration wrong.</TE>
<TE>   But some analysts think the difficulty could come from the
opposite direction -- if Hussein gives the inspectors too much data.</TE>
<TE>   "He could give them a lot of meaningless stuff to make it look
like he's softening," warned Judith Yaphe, a scholar at the National
Defense University. "He'll say, 'Of course we'll comply.' But his
objective will be to slow the process down, be patient, and expect to
get it all back someday."</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. resolution requires Iraq to declare not only military
facilities but also civilian programs that involve chemical,
biological or nuclear technology. The Iraqis have complained that
this requires them to declare such things as petrochemical plants
that manufacture plastic sandals, and they have warned that they
might not meet the deadline.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N., with U.S. approval, has responded that it might accept
belated declarations of purely civilian facilities but not military
programs, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Several experts said they expect Hussein to choose the middle
option: a declaration that includes some new information about
military programs but not everything in Iraq's secret arsenal.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm inclined to think [the declaration] will be pretty thorough,"
said Mack, who oversaw Iraq policy at the State Department during the
Persian Gulf War a decade ago. "They will probably make some
confessions of oversight.</TE>
<TE>   "But he'll try to hold on to something.... The weapons of mass
destruction are important to his image with the senior generals and
the intelligence people in his own regime. His survival in power does
depend on being able to intimidate other people internally, and that
depends on an image of being able to outsmart the United States and
the U.N.</TE>
<TE>   "Cooperation might win him praise from the international
community, but it has a definite downside for him inside Iraq," Mack
said.</TE>
<TE>   "His strategy is always going to be: 'What can I do to drive a
wedge between those people who have lined up against me? How can I
split off the weak-kneed?' " said Joseph C. Wilson, a former U.S.
diplomat in Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Hussein "had a change of heart and decided that he wanted
to comply completely" with the U.N. resolution, Wilson said, Iraq's
national security needs could get in the way.</TE>
<TE>   "Disarmament is a wonderful goal, but the Iraqis didn't build
their weapons of mass destruction because they hate America," he
said. "They built them because they are in a tough neighborhood. They
built them because they are afraid of three strong countries nearby:
Israel, Turkey and Iran."</TE>

<HD>Over-the-Counter Sale of Allergy Drug Approved</HD>
<DH>FDA action is expected to cut monthly cost from $60 to
under $20.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Vicki Kemper</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved
over-the-counter sales of the drug Claritin, clearing the way for
allergy sufferers to buy the popular antihistamine without a doctor's
prescription as soon as next month.</LD>
<LD>   The FDA action will directly benefit consumers -- particularly
those with no health insurance and those whose insurance does not
cover prescription drugs.</LD>
<LD>   A month's supply of Claritin sold over the counter will probably
cost less than $20, industry experts said, and generic versions are
likely to be even less expensive. A Claritin prescription now costs
$60 or more.</LD>
<TE>   Perhaps even more significant, however, the government's decision
could signal a new phase in efforts to control health-care spending,
one that pits the insurance industry against pharmaceutical
manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   The decision "sets an important precedent for all of us striving
to protect the affordability of prescription drugs," said Robert
Seidman, chief pharmacy officer of WellPoint Health Networks, the
Thousand Oaks-based insurer that first petitioned the government
about Claritin's status.</TE>
<TE>   WellPoint, whose 13 million members include 6 million in
California, spent more than $40 million on Claritin prescriptions
last year. On top of that, WellPoint members spent $15 to $17 in
co-payments for each prescription.</TE>
<TE>   Prescription drug spending is, at roughly 16% a year, the
fastest-growing component of overall health-care costs. Brand-name
drug manufacturers have strongly resisted congressional and
regulatory efforts to make medications more affordable.</TE>
<TE>   More than 41 million Americans have no health coverage, and rising
health costs -- including double-digit premium increases that are
being passed from insurer to employer to employee -- are likely to
leave even more Americans uninsured, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Claritin was introduced in 1993 as a medication that could relieve
sneezing, runny noses and other allergy symptoms without causing
drowsiness.</TE>
<TE>   Its manufacturer, Schering-Plough Corp., marketed Claritin as a
major advance in allergy treatment, and it soon became the company's
top-selling drug.</TE>
<TE>   By 2000, only eight other drugs were prescribed more often than
Claritin, and only two -- the anti-inflammatory Vioxx and the
anti-ulcer Prilosec -- were marketed more heavily.</TE>
<TE>   WellPoint officials have for years monitored drug use very
carefully, Seidman said, because "we have a responsibility to provide
broad access to affordable health care."</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, the insurer became the first non-pharmaceutical concern
to petition the FDA to change the status of a drug.</TE>
<TE>   WellPoint also asked the agency to make not only Claritin but also
the antihistamines Allegra and Zyrtec available over the counter.</TE>
<TE>   While those so-called second-generation antihistamines account for
as much as 7% of all U.S. spending on prescription drugs, WellPoint
officials argued that the drugs clearly met the FDA's standards for
over-the-counter sales.</TE>
<TE>   Federal regulations require that drugs that are sold over the
counter must treat a condition that patients can diagnose and manage
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The drugs must also be safe for a consumer to use without medical
supervision, and they must have labels that clearly explain what side
effects the drugs might have and how they should be taken.</TE>
<TE>   In a vote last year, an FDA advisory committee agreed with
WellPoint that all three drugs met these standards.</TE>
<TE>   But the agency took no action until Wednesday. And even then, it
acted only on Claritin, and officials stressed that the decision was
related not to the petition from WellPoint but to an application made
by Schering-Plough.</TE>
<TE>   The drug manufacturer, whose U.S. sales of Claritin totaled $2.7
billion last year, initially resisted the WellPoint petition.</TE>
<TE>   But in February, Schering-Plough won FDA approval of Clarinex, a
drug it is marketing as even better than Claritin because it can
treat symptoms caused by indoor, as well as outdoor, allergens.</TE>
<TE>   In March, Schering-Plough announced that it was "pushing FDA to
move Claritin to over-the-counter," company spokesman William
O'Donnell said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The company's patent on Claritin expires Dec. 19.</TE>
<TE>   There is no timetable for the FDA to decide whether Allegra and
Zyrtec should be made available over the counter, Dr. Robert Meyer,
the agency's director on nonprescription drug evaluations, said
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   But Aventis, the maker of Allegra, said Wednesday that it was
"working to expand its range of new formulations and potential uses"
of the drug.</TE>

<HD>Resort Hotel in Kenya Bombed; Missiles Fired at Israeli
Airliner</HD>
<DH>Deaths and injuries are reported at the Paradise Mombasa,
frequented by Israelis. No one aboard the plane is hurt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alissa J. Rubin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>A bomb exploded early today in the lobby of a Kenyan resort hotel
frequented by Israelis, injuring an unknown number of people at
almost the same time that two missiles were fired at a plane used by
the Israeli charter company Arkia.</LD>
<LD>   An owner of the hotel who was there, Aaron Hamill, said in an
Israeli television interview: "The place is torched, burned to the
ground. I can see seven bodies." He could not determine their
nationality.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli television reports said there were roughly 60 casualties,
including injured.</LD>
<TE>   Early reports by Israeli radio said the hotel, the Paradise
Mombasa, which is operated at least in part by an Israeli company,
was on fire. The resort is widely advertised in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The missiles missed the plane and no one was injured, said
spokesmen for the Israeli Foreign Ministry and for Arkia, which
operated the aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   "Two missiles were fired at the Arkia plane as it took off; both
missed," said Jonathan Peled, the Foreign Ministry spokesman. The
plane had just dropped off a group of passengers who had gone to the
hotel, according to Itzak Mamman, one of the operators of the company
in Tel Aviv, who was interviewed on Israeli radio.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, there was an explosion at the hotel. "We think it was
a car bomb. We know there are injuries, we don't know how many or the
nationalities," Peled said.</TE>
<TE>   The pilot reported seeing two flashes of light shortly after the
plane took off from Mombasa about 7 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   More than 270 passengers and 10 crew members were aboard the
plane.</TE>
<TE>   The attacks came just a day after Yasser Arafat's top deputy said
taking up arms against Israel has been a mistake for the Palestinians
and must be stopped because the use of weapons has held up
Palestinian independence and led to a reoccupation of West Bank
cities by Israeli troops.</TE>
<TE>   The comments by Mahmoud Abbas, a possible successor to Arafat, the
Palestinian Authority president, were made at a private meeting of
party leaders last month and constitute the harshest criticism a
senior Palestinian figure has leveled at militants since violence
erupted in September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "Many people diverted the uprising from its natural path and
embarked on a path we can't handle, with the use of weapons ... such
as mortars, grenades and shooting from houses and populated areas,"
Abbas said at the Oct. 24 meeting with activists of Arafat's Fatah
movement.</TE>
<TE>   "If we do a calculation of the gains and losses ... we will see
without any doubt that what we lost was big and what we gained was
small," he said.</TE>

<HD>Inspectors Include Man With Leadership Role in Sex Fetish
Clubs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The United Nations' Iraq weapons inspections team includes a
53-year-old Virginia man with no specialized scientific degree and a
leadership role in sadomasochistic sex clubs.</LD>
<LD>   The U.N. acknowledged that it did not conduct a background check
on Harvey John "Jack" McGeorge of Woodbridge, Va., who was in New
York waiting to be sent to Iraq as a munitions analyst.</LD>
<LD>   McGeorge was picked for the diplomatically sensitive mission over
some of the most experienced disarmament sleuths in the world. A U.N.
spokesman said McGeorge was part of a group recommended by the State
Department, which in turn said it was merely forwarding names for
consideration.</LD>
<TE>   "As the United Nations, with people applying from many countries,
we do not have the capability to do that," Ewen Buchanan, a spokesman
for the inspection commission, said of background checks.</TE>
<TE>   McGeorge is a former Marine and Secret Service specialist who
offers seminars on "weaponization of chemical and biological agents"
for $595 a session. Since 1983, he has been president of his own
firm, Public Safety Group Inc., which sells anti-bioterror products
to governments.</TE>
<TE>   McGeorge does not possess a degree in one of the specialized
fields -- such as biochemistry, bacteriology or chemical engineering
-- that the United Nations says it seeks in its inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   An Internet search of open Web sites conducted by the Washington
Post found that McGeorge is the co-founder and past president of
Black Rose, a Washington-area S&amp;M group, and the former chairman of
the board of the National Coalition for Sexual Freedom. He is also a
founding officer of the Leather Leadership Conference Inc., which
"produces training sessions for current and potential leaders of the
sadomasochism/leather/fetish community," according to its Web site.
Several Web sites describe McGeorge's training seminars as involving
various acts conducted with knives and ropes.</TE>
<TE>   McGeorge said Friday that a State Department official invited him
to apply and he was not asked about his S&amp;M background. But he said
he would tender his resignation if the Washington Post printed a
story.</TE>
<TE>   "I have been very upfront with people in the past about what I do,
and it has never prevented me from getting a job or doing service,"
McGeorge said. "I am who I am. I am not ashamed of who I am, not one
bit. But I cannot allow my actions, as they may be perceived by
others, to damage an organization which has done nothing to deserve
that damage."</TE>
<TE>   McGeorge defended his training and experience, saying: "I was a
military ordnance explosive disposal specialist. I was very well
trained on chemical and biological agents."</TE>
<TE>   Half the 100 inspectors picked so far were recommended by

<HD>Scouts to Check Backgrounds of New Volunteers</HD>
<DH>The national Boy Scouts council reacts to abuse cases in
the organization and elsewhere.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Boy Scouts of America will require criminal background checks of
all potential volunteers to screen out those convicted of violent
crimes, drug offenses or sexual abuse of children, the national
organization's executive council said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The decision comes after a series of recent child abuse cases
involving adult volunteers and Scouts that prompted concerned parents
to demand better protection for their children, Boy Scout officials
said.</LD>
<LD>   The move is part of a national trend to demand more accountability
from organizations that function in parental roles.</LD>
<TE>   Some of the nation's largest youth sports groups, such as the
California-based American Youth Soccer Organization and California
Youth Soccer Assn., as well as the YMCA of Metropolitan Los Angeles,
are among the organizations that already have instituted fingerprint
checks for volunteers and employees.</TE>
<TE>   "It started a long time ago, but the dramatic growth has come very
recently," said Tom DeCair, spokesman for the Josephson Institute of
Ethics in Marina del Rey, which has urged all youth organizations to
require background checks for coaches. The move started after
harrowing abuse allegations surfaced at day-care facilities in the
1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Background checks "can't be a bad idea," he added. "If you're
reluctant to do it, maybe you shouldn't be around kids."</TE>
<TE>   But relying on background checks is an incomplete protection, said
Larry Rosen, president and chief executive of the YMCA of
Metropolitan Los Angeles. To begin with, the checks turn up only
those who have a criminal record.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps more important, in the vast majority of reported child
sexual molestation cases, the abuser is a family member, other
relative or neighbor, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services says that 88% of
reported sexual abuse cases were perpetrated by parents or other
relatives of victims, and only 2% by adults in other care-taking
relationships.</TE>
<TE>   . "The people who you should look at are family, relatives and
people in the neighborhood," Rosen said. Nonetheless, parents
increasingly are demanding background checks from organizations that
care for children, and those groups generally have decided that the
costs and delays -- checks can take at least two weeks -- are worth
the effort.</TE>
<TE>   At the YMCA, supervisors are told to screen prospective employees
using known behavior patterns associated with sexual predators, as
well as their own instincts.</TE>
<TE>   The move by the Scouts was motivated by sexual scandals within the
organization and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   For example, in September a singing instructor who had been barred
from a Costa Mesa boys chorus was also barred from volunteering with
the Boy Scouts after his arrest on suspicion of molesting a teenager
over a four-year period. Last year, an Irvine man was convicted of 16
felonies for sexually molesting three boys he met through Boy Scouts
and Big Brothers programs.</TE>
<TE>   Boy Scouts spokesman Gregg Shields said individual councils always
have been able to screen applicants informally, though many did not
do so because of limited resources and technology.</TE>
<TE>   "There was not one single repository where you could collect
information about a person's criminal history," he said. "That has
changed now and gotten to the point where we can reliably use this
information to screen applicants."</TE>
<TE>   Background checks, the executive council said Wednesday, are the
next logical step toward ensuring the safety of the group's members.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always been concerned about child abuse within our
organization," Shields added. "And this gives us another tool to
ensure that our children are safe."</TE>
<TE>   The organization has enlisted ChoicePoint, a background-checking
division of the consumer data management company Equifax, to perform
federal, state and county criminal checks on prospective volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   Boys Scout chapters will begin performing checks April 1, when the
group expects to have distributed new application forms and explained
the policy changes to all volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   A warning on the new forms says: "By submitting this application
you are authorizing a criminal background check of yourself. This
check will be made from public record sources. You will have an
opportunity to review and challenge any adverse information disclosed
by the check."</TE>
<TE>   There are 1.2 million adult Scouting volunteers, Shields said. The
organization does not plan to screen existing volunteers but may do
so in the future, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Shields acknowledged that the new requirement may keep some people
from volunteering, but that "is a risk that we are willing to take"
to ensure the safety of Scouts, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Only the chief executive of a regional Scouting council would tell
the local council if an applicant did not pass the check, Shields
said. The applicant then would be allowed to appeal the decision.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction to the edict among Los Angeles Scouting officials was
difficult to gauge Wednesday. Rafael Ruiz, a Scout leader from
Whittier, said that in theory, background checks sound great, but
that he wants to hear more about how they will work.</TE>
<TE>   "When you consider the enormous responsibility in looking after
our Scouts, almost anything along that line sounds great," he said.
"On the other hand, one has to take a very close look to make sure
the benefits to our Scouts are being looked after."</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz added that he thought the background checks might make
parents more comfortable with enrolling their children in the Scouts.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in the country, Scoutmaster Steve Vaughan, whose West
Texas chapter has 4,500 children from 18 counties, said he always was
vigilant about those he allows to volunteer in his troop, but seldom
could enlist the help of local authorities.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody has skeletons in the closet that they just don't want
people to know about," he said.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Prisoner Seeks Exoneration</HD>
<DH>Former policewoman who served time for murder and fled jail
awaits DNA test results.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>Former Police Officer Laurie Bembenek, who fled to Canada more than a
decade ago while serving time for killing her husband's ex-wife, will
soon know whether DNA testing proves her innocence, her attorney
said.</LD>
<LD>   A hearing is scheduled Dec. 16 for Bembenek, who has always
maintained innocence in the May 1981 death of Christine Schultz,
attorney Mary L. Woehrer said.</LD>
<LD>   Bembenek was convicted of murder in 1982 and sentenced to life in
prison. She escaped from prison in 1990 by crawling out a window but
was captured months later in Ontario, where she was working as a
waitress.</LD>
<TE>   She sought asylum in Canada, but reached a deal with prosecutors
in 1992 in which she pleaded no contest to second-degree murder and
was immediately released.</TE>
<TE>   Her highly publicized story was made into a book and a TV movie
starring Tatum O'Neal, "Woman on the Run: The Lawrencia Bembenek
Story."</TE>
<TE>   In August, after the former Milwaukee officer completed a 10-year
probation, she asked the court for DNA testing of items including a
sexual assault evidence kit, fingernail clippings with blood on them,
sheets and blankets, two guns, a bullet retrieved from Schultz's body
and the clothing Schultz was wearing when she was killed.</TE>
<TE>   A judge granted Bembenek's request last month. Results had been
expected by Wednesday, but the lab said that it needed a few more
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The "Dr. Phil" television show agreed to pay for the tests in
exchange for Bembenek's appearance on the show.</TE>
<TE>   Bembenek charged that police colleagues framed her because she was
assisting a federal investigation into corruption and sex
discrimination in the Milwaukee department.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Forester to Change Plea to Guilty</HD>
<DH>Terry Barton is charged with setting Colorado's largest
wildfire.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Terry Barton, the former U.S. Forest Service employee accused of
starting the largest wildfire in Colorado history, filed documents in
federal court Wednesday saying she plans to change her plea to
guilty.</LD>
<LD>   Barton, 38, pleaded not guilty in June to four federal charges,
including arson and injuring a firefighter. Combined, the counts
could result in a prison sentence of as long as 60 years and $1
million in fines.</LD>
<LD>   The 137,000-acre blaze started about 40 miles southwest of Denver
and destroyed 133 homes.</LD>
<TE>   Jeff Dorschner, spokesman for U.S. Atty. John Suthers, confirmed
that the government had reached a plea agreement with Barton, but
would not comment on the terms.</TE>
<TE>   Jessica Leto of the public defender's office said Barton will
appear in court Dec. 6, and U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch must
approve the change before approving the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Leto said Barton's attorney, Warren Williamson, was unavailable
for comment on the filing.</TE>
<TE>   A federal grand jury in June charged the 18-year Forest Service
veteran with setting fire to timber in a national forest, damaging
federal property, injuring a firefighter and using fire to commit a
felony.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighter Ryan Beyer broke his arm while fighting the fire,
which cost more than $29 million to control.</TE>
<TE>   Barton initially told investigators she accidentally started the
fire while burning a letter from her estranged husband. Authorities
believe she intentionally set the blaze.</TE>
<TE>   She was fired June 22 from the Forest Service, six days after
being arrested. She had been a seasonal employee for 18 years and a
probationary full-time employee for a year. Her responsibilities
included patrolling a section of the Pike National Forest for illegal
fires.</TE>

<HD>Latinas Found to Get Cervical Cancer More Often</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Latinas contract cervical cancer almost twice as often as other
women, indicating that not enough of them are having Pap tests,
federal officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also
found that older women of all ethnic groups were more likely to show
advanced cases of the disease when first diagnosed.</LD>
<LD>   These women sometimes lack easy access to screening tests because
of their age, low education, low income or lack of health insurance,
the CDC's Dr. Sidibe Kassim said.</LD>
<TE>   "We really need to reach those women," Kassim said.</TE>
<TE>   For the study, the CDC analyzed 14,759 new invasive cervical
cancer cases from 1992 to 1999. The disease was found at a rate of
16.9 per 100,000 Latinas 30 and older, compared with 8.9 per 100,000
non-Latinas.</TE>
<TE>   Forty percent of the patients were diagnosed with advanced cases
of the disease; among women 50 or older, the rate rose to 52%.</TE>
<TE>   The government noted that the high rates came in the face of a 50%
drop in cervical cancer cases among all American women in the last
three decades. Better cervical cancer education, screening and
treatment led to that decline, Kassim said.</TE>
<TE>   The CDC estimates 13,000 new cases of invasive cervical cancer
will be diagnosed this year and 4,100 women will die from the
disease.</TE>
<TE>   The Pap test identifies precancerous lesions and leads to early
treatment. Screening programs for cervical cancer exist in each
state, but some women may not realize they need to be tested, Kassim
said.</TE>
<TE>   The tests are recommended every three years for women who are
sexually active. Cervical cancer is virtually always caused by the
human papilloma virus, which is transmitted sexually.</TE>

<HD>Disney Cancels Cruise After More Passengers Fall Ill on
Ship</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Disney canceled the next voyage of a cruise ship Wednesday after
dozens of people got a flu-like stomach illness this week -- the
ship's second successive voyage on which passengers got sick.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of embarking on a weeklong Caribbean cruise Saturday, the
Disney Magic will remain docked in Port Canaveral while crews clean
"every surface throughout the ship that a guest would come in contact
with," Disney Cruise Lines spokeswoman Marilyn Waters said.</LD>
<LD>   The Disney Magic was in Cozumel, Mexico, on Wednesday with about
2,400 passengers and 950 crew members. Of those, 104 passengers and
19 crew fell ill, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention.</LD>
<TE>   The ship was disinfected as recently as Saturday, after 275 people
got sick on its previous seven-day voyage.</TE>
<TE>   A CDC test confirmed that those passengers had the Norwalk virus,
which can cause diarrhea, stomach pain and vomiting. The CDC said the
virus probably had spread by personal contact.</TE>

<HD>Cheney Loses a Round on Disclosure</HD>
<DH>Judge orders him to surrender papers detailing meetings
that led to U.S. energy policy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard A. Serrano</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A federal judge has ruled that Vice President Dick Cheney soon must
turn over documents detailing who he met with last year in forming
the administration's energy policy -- specifics sought by
special-interest groups that contend that the industry heavily
influenced plans for more oil and gas drilling and a revived nuclear
power program.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan, in a ruling made late
Tuesday and released Wednesday, gave the vice president two weeks to
release the documents or more clearly explain why they should be
withheld from public inspection.</LD>
<LD>   Jennifer Millerwise, a spokeswoman for Cheney, said his office
would have no comment on the ruling and referred the matter to the
Justice Department. Justice officials could not be reached for
comment.</LD>
<TE>   The administration is expected to appeal the decision.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit was filed by the Sierra Club and Judicial Watch,
urging full disclosure over who met with Cheney and how they may have
influenced his "super-secretive" energy task force in spring 2001.
Both groups called the judge's ruling a significant victory.</TE>
<TE>   David Bookbinder, senior attorney with the Sierra Club, said the
decision "brings the American people one step closer to finding out
just who the vice president's energy task force met with in drafting
its dirty, dangerous energy plan."</TE>
<TE>   He added, "The vice president should take this as a sign that the
game is up and come clean."</TE>
<TE>   Soon after the Bush administration took office, Cheney was tapped
to convene the National Energy Policy Development Group and search
for ways to make the country less dependent on foreign energy
sources.</TE>
<TE>   In May 2001, the group released a policy paper advocating more
domestic oil and gas drilling and that the nation should look again
at doing more with nuclear power.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental groups complained that they were basically shut out
of participating in the group's work.</TE>
<TE>   When they asked for an accounting of which large energy companies
were involved, Cheney refused to release that information.</TE>
<TE>   The vice president has contended that the executive branch of the
government has a right to meet privately with companies and
individuals as it sees fit.</TE>
<TE>   The Sierra Club and Judicial Watch, a legal watchdog group, filed
suit.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Sullivan ordered the White House to turn over the
documents or produce a detailed explanation about what paperwork it
still wanted to withhold from the public.</TE>
<TE>   The administration asked permission from the judge to appeal his
order now rather than wait for the lawsuit to be resolved.</TE>
<TE>   But the judge denied that request in Tuesday's order, directing
the administration to comply with his October ruling for release of
the documents in two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney and the White House, Sullivan said, "have simply failed to
establish the factual and legal predicates justifying" an appeal at
this time.</TE>
<TE>   He added that "once again the defendants have misrepresented
precedent" in arguing that the work of the energy task force was an
extraordinary event that called for executive privilege by the White
House.</TE>
<TE>   Bookbinder of the Sierra Club said the energy policy put out by
the administration "has serious impacts on the health and safety of
American communities. The public deserves to know who drafted that
policy."</TE>
<TE>   Larry Klayman, chairman and general counsel for Judicial Watch,
added, "The vice president is not above the law and should obey court
orders like every other American citizen."</TE>
<TE>   In a separate lawsuit still pending, the General Accounting
Office, a congressional watchdog agency, also is asking Cheney to
reveal who he met with while the energy policy was taking shape.</TE>

<HD>Wildlife Protections Lost in New Forest Rules</HD>
<DH>Industry hails changes as being long overdue, but
environmentalists charge the White House is doing the bidding of the
timber companies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Shogren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration Wednesday proposed removing wildlife
protections in the national forest system as it moved to streamline
20-year-old rules that govern how much logging, grazing and mining
can be approved.</LD>
<LD>   The new rules would give forest managers new flexibility as they
weigh competing uses of national forests. No longer would they be
required to ensure the survival of native mammal, bird, reptile,
amphibian and fish species when planning development."The Forest
Service wants ... to spend its available resources doing real work on
the land and not disproportionately on planning and analysis," said
Sally Collins, associate chief of the Forest Service, the agency of
the Agriculture Department that manages national forests.</LD>
<LD>   Matt Mathes, a spokesman for the Forest Service in California,
said no one need worry that any species would face new peril in the
state's 18 national forests.</LD>
<TE>   "We have a moral and a legal obligation to keep animals off of the
threatened and endangered species list," Mathes said. "That has been
the bottom line for a number of years and will continue to be the
bottom line."</TE>
<TE>   He said the proposal would not affect the changes underway to the
Sierra Nevada Framework, which governs the management of 10 national
forests in California. But it could influence individual plans for
these forests over the next several years.</TE>
<TE>   It could also have an effect on the planning processes underway at
the four national forests in Southern California -- the Angeles, Los
Padres, San Bernardino and Cleveland, Mathes said.</TE>
<TE>   Timber and paper companies and their supporters in Congress
praised the administration, saying it was re-injecting common sense
into forest planning.</TE>
<TE>   "The rule provides our on-the-ground Forest Service professionals
the tools and flexibility they need to manage America's forests and
grasslands and to protect the environment," said Sen. Larry E. Craig
(R-Idaho).</TE>
<TE>   But environmentalists charged that the administration was doing
the bidding of timber companies, which want to increase logging in
the national forests.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not just undoing something the Clinton administration
did, they are undoing two decades of national forest manage
practice," said Rodger Schlickeisen, president of Defenders of
Wildlife, a national environmental group.</TE>
<TE>   Altogether, national forests and grasslands cover 191 million
acres, an area larger than Texas. Unlike national parks, where most
economic activities are forbidden, national forests were created in
part to ensure a steady supply of timber.</TE>
<TE>   In recent decades, public concern about widespread clear-cutting
and its effect on wildlife has led to steady increases in
environmental protections in the forests.</TE>
<TE>   Within months of taking office, however, the Bush administration
canceled a requirement, proposed by the Clinton administration, that
forest planners for the first time elevate environmental concerns
over all others in the national forests.</TE>
<TE>   The forest announcement is the Bush administration's second major
rollback of long-standing environmental protections since the Nov. 5
elections. On Friday, the administration relaxed a provision of the
Clean Air Act. Critics charged that the administration was waiting
until after voters had made their choices.</TE>
<TE>   "This is part of an ongoing and systematic assault by the
administration on our natural resources and environmental
protections," said Rep. Nick J. Rahall II of West Virginia, the
senior Democrat on the House Resources Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Rahall and others accused the administration of releasing the news
the day before Thanksgiving to try to minimize the number of
Americans who hear about it. A New York Times poll this week showed
that, despite President Bush's high popularity, a majority of
Americans disapprove of his environmental policies.</TE>
<TE>   The new regulations could take effect after a three-month public
comment period. They would overhaul the implementation of the 1976
National Forest Management Act and modify the rules, adopted under
the authority of that law in 1982 during the Reagan administration,
designed to protect vertebrate species in the forests.</TE>
<TE>   The act required the Forest Service to prepare plans every 15
years for managing each of the nation's 155 national forests and 20
national grasslands. The plans determine which lands are targeted for
mineral development, grazing or timber harvests and which are
reserved for wildlife, recreation or wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   Timber and paper companies said the proposal would help force the
Forest Service to balance environmental concerns against economic and
social interests.</TE>
<TE>   "What we've seen is a great shift away from balance to giving
ecological considerations priority," said Michael Klein, a spokesman
for the American Forest &amp; Paper Assn., a national trade group for
forest products companies. "What was announced today is one more step
toward restoring some of that balance."</TE>
<TE>   If adopted, the proposal would free the Forest Service to manage
its land more aggressively to prevent fires that decimate not only
public but private forests, Klein said.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's proposal reflects the administration's desire to
reduce regulations that impede business and bureaucrats.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, it would waive the requirement for a thorough
environmental assessment of forest management plans that did not
significantly affect the "quality of the human environment." It would
also reduce the public comment period on forest plan revisions from
135 days to 60 days.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists opposed both changes because they would reduce
the opportunity for the public and forest service employees to be
heard if they thought that a plan could imperil wildlife, clean water
or wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists also criticized the Bush administration for
failing to convene a scientific committee to review the rule changes
as every other administration from Reagan to Clinton had done when
making alterations to the 1976 National Forest Management Act.</TE>
<TE>   But the change that stirred the most protest from
environmentalists was the proposal to remove the requirement to
ensure the survival of species.</TE>
<TE>   "Without a viability requirement, the California spotted owl in
the Sierra Nevada would have been an endangered species by now," said
Jay Watson, California director of the Wilderness Society. "The goal
of the viability requirement was to prevent species from becoming so
rare that they had to be protected under the Endangered Species Act."</TE>

<HD>An Influence Felt Far and Wide</HD>
<DH>Henry A. Kissinger, a foreign-policy institution, remains a
controversial figure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Richter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Henry A. Kissinger has been out of government for a quarter of
century, yet as a consultant, lecturer and pillar of the U.S.
foreign-policy establishment, the former secretary of State remains
influential and controversial.</LD>
<LD>   The 79-year-old Nobel laureate, perhaps the best-known diplomat of
recent decades, is as he always has been a sought-after source of
advice for Republican and Democratic administrations. He lectures,
writes influential newspaper columns and heads a consulting firm,
Kissinger Associates, with a roster of blue-chip clients.</LD>
<LD>   Yet Kissinger, who was chosen Wednesday to head the independent
commission that will investigate last year's terrorist attacks, also
continues to be hounded by critics of his foreign-policy stewardship
during the Nixon and Ford administrations. His harshest critics
charge that he was a "war criminal."</LD>
<TE>   Kissinger, a refugee from Nazi Germany, began his career as a
Harvard professor and entered government in 1969 as President Nixon's
national security advisor. He eventually served the unusual dual role
of national security advisor and secretary of State under both Nixon
and President Ford.</TE>
<TE>   He shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 1973 with North Vietnamese
diplomat Le Duc Tho for bringing about a cease-fire that led to the
Vietnam War's end.</TE>
<TE>   Since leaving government at the end of the Ford administration in
January 1977, Kissinger has written a dozen books, including memoirs
and foreign-policy analyses.</TE>
<TE>   His continuing influence was clear in August, when top Republicans
were debating the Bush administration's increasingly aggressive
posture toward the regime of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
Kissinger drew wide notice with an Aug. 12 newspaper column that said
an attack against the regime was appropriate, although he urged
President Bush to continue diplomatic efforts to try to force
inspections of Iraq's suspected weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Robert F. Ellsworth, a longtime Republican foreign-policy expert
and former U.S. ambassador to NATO, said Kissinger's opinions are
regularly weighed when Republican leaders formulate policy. "He's the
institutional memory; he's the institutional insight," he said. "They
know he's influential, they know he's a Republican, and they know
he's trustworthy, and not going to go off into the wild blue yonder."</TE>
<TE>   Kissinger began his consulting firm, Kissinger Associates, two
decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   With its headquarters in New York, the firm "provides strategic
advisory and advocacy services" for international clients, according
to its promotional literature.</TE>
<TE>   This means that Kissinger and his associates are so-called door
openers who can put companies in touch with the officials they know
overseas, and they can give them advice on the politics and economics
of the countries they have done business with. The firm does not
lobby the U.S. government.</TE>
<TE>   Its client list has included such firms as Merck &amp; Co. Inc., the
Coca-Cola Co., the Anheuser-Busch Cos. and Revlon Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "Few people would not return Henry's phone call," John Muse, of
the Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst Inc. buyout firm, told a British
newspaper earlier this year as the firm announced it was retaining
Kissinger.</TE>
<TE>   The firm has been criticized for advising clients doing business
with foreign countries, such as China and Indonesia, while Kissinger
was offering foreign-policy commentaries advocating improved trade
relations with these countries.</TE>
<TE>   Kissinger prefers to say little about his business activities.
Aides at his offices in New York and Washington declined Wednesday to
discuss his business activities and said neither he nor others at the
firm would be made available to discuss them.</TE>
<TE>   Kissinger's critics have focused most intently on his leadership
of the U.S. military effort in Indochina, including the secret
bombing of Cambodia, and the U.S. role in the 1973 overthrow of
leftist Chilean President Salvador Allende by the dictator Augusto
Pinochet.</TE>
<TE>   The critics contend Kissinger was too willing to work with corrupt
governments to advance what he saw as U.S. interests.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, judges in Argentina, Chile and France said they
wanted to question Kissinger about what he knew of human-rights
abuses committed during the Pinochet years. When Kissinger visited
Cork, Ireland, in February, protesters at University College Cork
carried banners denouncing him as the "Milosevic of Manhattan," in a
reference to the brutal former leader of Yugoslavia.</TE>

<HD>Germany, France to Aid Moussaoui's Prosecution</HD>
<DH>Countries to give U.S. trial evidence provided it's not
used to back defendant's execution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Germany and France agreed Wednesday to provide evidence and
information for the trial of Zacarias Moussaoui after U.S. officials
promised the material would not be used to support his execution.</LD>
<LD>   Both countries have banned capital punishment and refuse to submit
material that could lead to a defendant's execution in other nations.</LD>
<LD>   Moussaoui, a French citizen, faces the death penalty if convicted
of conspiring with the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers to commit terrorism and
aircraft piracy. Any French and German evidence could conceivably be
used in the guilt or innocence phase of the case, but not in the
separate penalty phase if Moussaoui is convicted.</LD>
<TE>   "The United States of America has assured that the evidence and
the information submitted by Germany will not directly or indirectly
be used against the defendant nor against a third party toward the
imposition of the death penalty," the German government said in a
statement released by its embassy here.</TE>
<TE>   The French Justice Ministry issued a similar statement and said
the two countries agreed on a joint position at a meeting between
French Justice Minister Dominique Perben and Germany's federal
justice minister, Brigitte Zypries.</TE>
<TE>   Zypries said exchanges of information between U.S. and German
officials have reached an unprecedented level.</TE>
<TE>   She hailed the agreement as a "further contribution in our joint
fight against international terrorism." She said countries
participating in the anti-terrorism coalition should "support each
other in the area of criminal proceedings, as far as each of their
national constitutions allow."</TE>
<TE>   A Justice Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said: "This is what we asked for. We're happy with it."</TE>
<TE>   FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III visited Berlin in September to
confer with German law enforcement officials and Hamburg
investigators probing the terror cell that participated in the Sept.
11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing we all have to recognize is no one country can address
terrorism on its own," Mueller told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Germans allege Moussaoui was chosen by the Hamburg cell leader
Mohamed Atta to be the fourth pilot of the hijacked airplanes, and
that they traced a money transfer for flight school in Minnesota to
Hamburg.</TE>
<TE>   However, U.S. officials said recently that Ramzi Binalshibh, an Al
Qaeda operative now in custody, has told interrogators that Moussaoui
was a backup in the plot.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment against Moussaoui said that from July 29 to Aug. 4,
2001, in Norman, Okla., Moussaoui made several telephone calls from
public phones to a number in Duesseldorf, Germany.</TE>
<TE>   When he was arrested Aug. 16, 2001, the indictment said,
Moussaoui's possessions included a notebook listing the German phone
number, a second German phone number and the name "Ahad Sabet." The
indictment said "Sabet" actually was Binalshibh, who wired Moussaoui
$14,000 from Duesseldorf and Hamburg on or about Aug. 1 and Aug. 3,
2001.</TE>

<HD>Governor's Ex-Paramour Accuses State</HD>
<DH>Tina Conner says regulators fabricated records to force her
nursing home into bankruptcy after she ended her affair with Kentucky
Gov. Paul Patton. He denies doing anything to harm her business.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LOUISVILLE, Ky.</DL>
<LD>The owner of a bankrupt nursing home accused state regulators
Wednesday of fabricating violations and altering records to close
down the home in retaliation for her decision to end an affair with
Gov. Paul Patton.</LD>
<LD>   The state is trying to revoke Birchtree Healthcare's license --
which expires Dec. 31 -- for "continued and substantial failure" to
meet minimum requirements.</LD>
<LD>   Tina Conner alleges that state inspectors hounded the nursing home
into bankruptcy after she ended a two-year affair with Patton. She
alleges it was Patton's way of retaliating -- a charge under state
and federal investigation.</LD>
<TE>   The debt-ridden nursing home, which has only 11 residents left,
never recovered from losing Medicare and Medicaid funding during the
summer.</TE>
<TE>   During a federal bankruptcy hearing Wednesday, Conner and
Birchtree administrator Dan Dabney alleged that a member of the
state's survey team altered a patient's medical record during an
October inspection, causing the patient to take medication later than
prescribed.</TE>
<TE>   Dabney has filed a complaint with the attorney general's office. A
spokeswoman there said the office has subpoenaed the records.</TE>
<TE>   The state Cabinet for Health Services declined to comment, but
inspector Linda Tinsley testified that regulators didn't change the
chart.</TE>
<TE>   Conner and Dabney deny that the facility had serious violations
and say they worked to improve care. "I have never said there weren't
legitimate problems," Conner said. "They were not of that magnitude."</TE>
<TE>   Conner said she has given investigators a tape of a conversation
in which a state official says she is working to close down
Birchtree.</TE>
<TE>   Patton acknowledged his affair with Conner but denied doing
anything to aid or ruin her business. Cabinet officials deny that
their scrutiny of Birchtree was politically motivated.</TE>

<HD>Georgia Nut Growers Get a Shellacking</HD>
<DH>Pecans can be fickle anyway, but dry season, torrents of
rain too late equal a tough harvest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ken Ellingwood</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>FORT VALLEY, Ga.</DL>
<LD>Even when it is good, the pecan is a fickle nut.</LD>
<LD>   Its growing properties make it especially prone to swings in
output -- a plentiful pecan crop one year often presages a lean one
the next. Throw in a long growing season and the whims of nature --
too little rain, or too much -- and you have a nut that is tricky to
manage long before it is time to bake it into a Thanksgiving pie.</LD>
<LD>   Which explains the sour mood of Georgia's pecan farmers, who are
enduring a slow harvest after getting smacked by an off year in
production, then months of no rain when they needed it and buckets
when they didn't. During the pre-Thanksgiving stretch that represents
the peak of the pecan harvest and the holiday buying rush, some
growers say their haul will be scarcely a third of last year's in a
state that is the nation's leading pecan producer.</LD>
<TE>   "Everybody's got the same story. Anyone who is solely in pecans
really got their feelings hurt this year," said longtime grower Al
Pearson, standing in a grove of towering 40-year-old pecan trees
whose yield has been especially miserly. "There's just not enough
volume -- at any price. It's just one we want to get behind us."</TE>
<TE>   Pearson represents the third generation in his family to farm
pecans here in central Georgia, an area better known as the heart of
peach-growing country. Most of Georgia's pecan industry, which
produces an average of 88 million pounds yearly, is centered in the
southern portion of the state.</TE>
<TE>   There are several reasons for this season's drastic downturn,
besides the on-again, off-again growth cycle. The main factor is the
farmer's usual bane. "It's the weather," said Darrell Sparks, a
horticulture professor at the University of Georgia who studies
pecans.</TE>
<TE>   First, it was very dry. Amid four years of drought, the
April-to-September growing season saw almost no rain -- a factor
contributing to nuts that were smaller and less meaty than usual,
farmers say. That came after a winter that didn't get cold enough for
the trees to fully bud once spring arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Then, just when it was time to harvest the nuts in October, the
rains finally fell. And fell. Central Georgia received nearly 5
inches of rain in October, more than twice the usual amount. November
brought further soaking -- more than 4 inches by early this week,
well above normal.</TE>
<TE>   The rains flooded some pecan orchards, turning sections into muddy
ponds and preventing growers from maneuvering their tractors amid the
trees. Pecans typically are shaken to the ground by machines that
reach out with a hydraulic arm and a giant, vibrating claw. Once
freed from the limbs, the pecans are swept into the middle of the
rows by a different machine and scooped into trailers along with
fallen leaves, branches and dirt. The pecans are then sorted from the
debris and packed.</TE>
<TE>   In some areas, high winds blew the pecans to the ground, where the
fallen nuts began to sprout or decay in the rainy warmth, making them
useless. Gathering the pecans became a messy enterprise as wet leaves
and mud accompanied the nuts into the trailers. At Pearson's farm,
the trailers had to be placed under blowers for hours to dry out the
heap before the nuts could be cleaned and sorted.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been very frustrating trying to get the stuff harvested. By
the time it gets dry enough to harvest, it rains again," said Buddy
Leger, a grower in Cordele who chairs the state's pecan commission.</TE>
<TE>   He said farmers could have used the rain a few months earlier to
supplement irrigation. "You're hard-pressed to say you'd wish it
would quit raining after four years of drought," Leger said. "It's a
double-edged sword."</TE>
<TE>   The rains have remained at bay for more than a week, making it
easier to gather what remains of the pecan yield. But it won't be
enough. At Pearson's Big 6 Farm, the processing shed would normally
be humming at top speed this week. Instead, workers can take
leisurely lunch breaks and some groves may not get a second shaking,
making for an abbreviated harvest.</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, the harvest may amount to about 50 million pounds this
year -- less than half of last year's yield of 110 million pounds. A
50% drop is not unusual following an abundant pecan crop, such as
last year's. But some growers expect the drop to exceed even that
decline. One of the state's largest growers, Chop Evans, said he will
probably harvest about 2 million pounds this year, compared with
nearly 6 million last year.</TE>
<TE>   If there is a bright spot in the fall gloom, it is that prices
paid to pecan farmers held up during the critical pre-Thanksgiving
run-up, though a decline is expected as Christmas gift orders get
filled. Retail-quality pecans have been fetching about $1.30 per
pound, although that reportedly dropped recently. A stockpile of
pecans from last year's crop should shield consumers from price
jumps, Leger said.</TE>
<TE>   At Pearson Farms, the family's roadside store, workers this week
were roasting premium Elliot pecans, some of which were salted while
others were sprinkled with a piquant mixture of garlic and
Worcestershire and Tabasco sauces. Shelves brimmed with decorative
tins and bags of pecans, though most are sold via catalog and,
increasingly, the Internet. Those sales were expected to hold steady.</TE>
<TE>   The family works about 2,000 acres of pecans and a smaller area of
peaches. Pearson, 52, said he will take a loss on pecans this year.
But he has been farming long enough to keep a sense of humor about
the fluctuating fortunes of the tasty nut, which for the most part
has been kind to the family over the years.</TE>
<TE>   "I've said in the past that if I could change my peaches to
pecans, I would," Pearson said. "This year, I'm glad I didn't."</TE>

<HD>Bad Times Over a Judge's Rhymes</HD>
<DH>Pennsylvania Supreme Court justice's practice 'reflects
poorly' on the bench, two peers say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>A state Supreme Court justice given to writing opinions in rhyme was
criticized by two fellow justices who said his style reflected poorly
on the court.</LD>
<LD>   Seven stanzas from Justice J. Michael Eakin, and complaints about
them from Chief Justice Stephen A. Zappala and Justice Ralph Cappy,
appeared in a decision Wednesday involving a dispute concerning a
prenuptial agreement.</LD>
<LD>   Susan Porreco's lawsuit claims the agreement she signed with Louis
Porreco should have been voided because he allegedly misrepresented
the engagement ring as a diamond.</LD>
<TE>   In his opinion, Eakin wrote rhymes including:</TE>
<TE>   "A groom must expect matrimonial pandemonium</TE>
<TE>   when his spouse finds he's given her a cubic zirconium</TE>
<TE>   instead of a diamond in her engagement band,</TE>
<TE>   the one he said was worth twenty-one grand."</TE>
<TE>   "The filing of an opinion that expresses itself in rhyme reflects
poorly on the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania," Zappala wrote. "No
matter addressed by this court is frivolous."</TE>
<TE>   Cappy wrote that judges have the right to express themselves, but
expressed concern about "the perception that litigants and the public
at large might form when an opinion of this Court is reduced to
rhyme."</TE>
<TE>   Eakin, through his secretary, said Wednesday that it would be
inappropriate to comment on what Zappala and Cappy wrote.</TE>
<TE>   In Wednesday's decision, the Supreme Court overruled a trial court
that agreed with Susan Porreco that the prenuptial agreement was
fraudulent. The high court sent the case back, saying Porreco could
have had the ring appraised before signing the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Eakin was among the judges dissenting in the 4-2 decision.</TE>

<HD>'An Awe-Inspiring Moment' Aloft for Native American
Astronaut</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The first Native American astronaut said Wednesday that he is
inspired and humbled to be flying -- and walking -- in space.</LD>
<LD>   John Herrington, a member of the Chickasaw Nation, helped install
a $390-million girder on the international space station Tuesday
during a seven-hour spacewalk.</LD>
<LD>   "It was an awe-inspiring moment to be able to go out of the hatch
and to see the Earth's horizon and see the space station against
that," he said in an interview.</LD>
<TE>   When asked by the Chickasaw Times how his perspective on
Thanksgiving would be affected by going out on a second spacewalk

<HD>Bush Readying Smallpox Plan</HD>
<DH>Mandatory shots likely for troops. Vaccinations would be
urged for emergency workers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush is expected to urge smallpox vaccinations for 500,000
emergency workers most likely to be exposed to the virus in a
bioterrorist attack and order 500,000 military personnel to get the
shots, White House officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Eventually, the vaccine will be made available to all Americans,
although the government will probably not encourage them to get it,
senior officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Bush does not plan to announce his policy for at least a week, and
details could change, said the officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.</LD>
<TE>   Barring a change, Bush plans to order vaccines for half a million
military personnel. On the civilian side, where his thinking is less
certain, he is inclined to accept recommendations to urge inoculating
about 500,000 medical and emergency-response workers.</TE>
<TE>   For months, officials have pondered who should be offered the
vaccine, which carries risks including possible death, and whether to
recommend it or just make it available.</TE>
<TE>   Smallpox was wiped out worldwide two decades ago, but experts fear
the contagious, often fatal disease could return through a terrorist
attack or war. Routine vaccinations ended in the U.S. in 1972,
meaning nearly half the population lacks any protection from the
virus. Officials aren't sure whether those vaccinated decades ago
have residual protection.</TE>
<TE>   The new vaccine would be offered in stages, beginning with those
most likely to encounter a smallpox patient. That would include
people on state response teams and people who work in hospital
emergency rooms. In a second phase, the shot could be offered to
other health-care workers and emergency workers, such as police,
firefighters and emergency medical technicians.</TE>

<HD>Bush OKs Expanded Routes for Mexican Truckers in U.S.</HD>
<DH>Under NAFTA, the vehicles were to have full access in 2000,
but Congress delayed action.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Wednesday gave the go-ahead for Mexican trucks to
travel U.S. roads beyond commercial border zones where they have been
restricted while inspection sites and new regulations were being put
in place.</LD>
<LD>   The decision comes nearly a year after Bush said he wanted to
allow Mexican trucks on U.S. roads, in compliance with a provision of
the North American Free Trade Agreement.</LD>
<LD>   The president "has made very clear we feel we have an important
obligation to our neighbors to the south to live up to our
international obligation and also have an important obligation to
ensure American roads are safe, and his action today takes both of
those into account," White House spokeswoman Claire Buchan said.</LD>
<TE>   The trucks and buses won't be on U.S. highways until the
Department of Transportation can review applications from carriers.
It must then grant qualifying carriers provisional operating
authority, the department said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Longo, a Transportation Department spokesman, said the first
Mexican trucks could be on U.S. roads "within a month or so."</TE>
<TE>   "President Bush has made good on his commitment to open the border
to international trucking and cross-border regular route bus service.
This will help increase trade between our countries," Transportation
Secretary Norman Y. Mineta said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's decision comes after a visit by Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell with President Vicente Fox in Mexico, where immigration and
other issues were discussed.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's action Wednesday modifies a 1982 moratorium that banned
Mexican trucks from the United States.</TE>
<TE>   In response, Mineta ordered the Transportation Department's
Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration to act on 130
applications received so far from Mexico-based carriers and bus
companies that want to move cargo across the border or provide
regular service between Mexico and the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "Mexican carriers and drivers must meet the same standards as U.S.
operators," Mineta said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year an estimated 63,000 Mexican trucks crossed the
U.S.-Mexico border, making 4.3 million crossings, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican trucks were to have gained full access to U.S. roads
beginning in 2000 under NAFTA, signed in 1993 by the United States,
Mexico and Canada.</TE>
<TE>   But Congress delayed their entry twice amid concerns about safety
and pressure from labor groups.</TE>
<TE>   An arbitration panel ruled in 2000 that the U.S. was violating
NAFTA by refusing to comply with that provision, but it also allowed
the United States to impose safety measures.</TE>
<TE>   Bush pledged to comply with NAFTA, and Congress agreed after much
debate. But Congress also required that more inspectors be hired and
full inspection sites be built at busy ports. It also required Mexico
to limit truckers' driving hours and create a commercial driver's
license database.</TE>
<TE>   Carriers will be required to have alcohol and drug testing in
place to pass the safety audit.</TE>
<TE>   The Transportation Department's inspector general also had to
certify that safety measures were in place and Mineta had signed off
on the assessment.</TE>
<TE>   "This objective has been met by having in place a sufficient
number of inspectors, adequate facilities and space for inspections,
measures to ensure that licenses are valid and that motor carrier
firms pass safety and compliance reviews," Transportation Department
Inspector General Kenneth Mead said.</TE>

<HD>Evidence Said to Link Suspect to Dead Girl</HD>
<DH>Oregon man's prints were on tape used to conceal
13-year-old's body, affidavit says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Martelle</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Fingerprints belonging to the suspected killer of two Oregon
schoolgirls were found on tape sealing one of the victims' bodies
inside cardboard boxes and plastic sheeting that had been fitted
together like nesting dolls, according to a newly filed affidavit.</LD>
<LD>   The other body was found similarly wrapped in black plastic, but
inside a barrel buried beneath a concrete slab behind the Oregon
City, Ore., home of Ward Weaver. The first body was in a shed a few
feet away.</LD>
<LD>   Weaver, 39, was denied bail this week by Clackamas County Circuit
Judge Robert Herndon because the "presumption is strong" that Weaver
is guilty. Weaver's attorney, William T. Lyons, declined to comment.</LD>
<TE>   Weaver is scheduled to go to trial in September. The affidavit,
filed by prosecutors before the bail hearing, included fresh details
that investigators said they uncovered through interviews with
Weaver's sons and during a search of his home.</TE>
<TE>   Among the revelations: At least one of the victims, 12-year-old
Ashley Pond, had consumed alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators considered Weaver, a shipping-and-receiving clerk, a
suspect shortly after Pond disappeared Jan. 9. She had left her
family's apartment that morning, headed for a school bus stop about
50 yards from Weaver's home. But the bus driver told investigators
that he had not seen the girl that day, and school officials reported
that she never arrived there.</TE>
<TE>   According to the affidavit, Weaver told investigators nine days
later that he and his 13-year-old daughter were at home that morning,
and that he did not get to work until 9:30 a.m. because of problems
with a burglar alarm system. The daughter, however, told police she
wasn't at home that morning.</TE>
<TE>   In March, Miranda Gaddis, 13, disappeared in similar fashion,
leaving the Newell Creek Apartments complex and failing to board the
local school bus.</TE>
<TE>   The girls' bodies were found in August after Weaver was arrested
in connection with the alleged rape of a woman who is the mother of
his 2-year-old grandson. Weaver's son and the father of the toddler,
Francis Paul Weaver, then called police to say his father had
admitted to him that he had killed the two girls.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators found Miranda's body inside the layered boxes. The
affidavit said she was naked except for socks.</TE>
<TE>   Ashley's body was found clothed inside a barrel beneath the slab
Weaver said he had poured as the foundation for a hot tub.</TE>
<TE>   Both bodies were bound with electrical and phone cords, which a
medical examiner determined had been done after the girls were dead.
The affidavit said the exact cause of the girls' deaths had not been
determined.</TE>
